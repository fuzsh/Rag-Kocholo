[NTRODUCTORY To all Hindus the important position occupied l>y the Sacred Condi (Turbhtilhi pyrum, Linn.), the Sankha of Sanscrit literature and the Sanku or Chanku of Tamil speech, in their religion is a commonplace of everyday knowledge ; few, however, are aware of the intimate relationship it bears to a hundred common incidents in the ordinary life of the people in many localities and among widely sundered races, tribes, and castes. In the following pages an attempt will be made to survey this little known by-way in the life and history of the Indian world, to show how superstition looks upon the Sankha as an amulet against the powers of evil, how this belief is among the oldest and most tenaciously held by Animist and Hindu, by Muhammadan and by Buddhist ; to indicate the way this belief has brought the shell into prominence in the Hindu religion, and to detail how it subserves as well, a hundred different uses in the daily lives of millions of Indians—how it is associated with infancy, marriage and death, and finally how its employment in the form of ornamental bangles was once the subject of an important industry in several widely separated parts of India, prominent being Kathiawar and Gujarat where to-day all memory of it has vanished. In connection with this latter point I trust that the attention now drawn to it, may result in the revival in Kathiawar of an industry that has more good things than usual in its favour if we consider other aims than that of mere money-making ; no objects manufactured in India are more artistic and pleasing than the handsome milk-white bangles made in Dacca workshops for the ladies of Bengal. In the course of collecting the materials for this essay, difficult problems have taken form. Some we can solve, but others remain obscure ; among the latter may be mentioned the unknown cause for the cessation and disappearance of the chank bangle industry in Kathiawar, Gujarat and the Deccan, and the question whether the use of chank bangles among a few sections of several castes in South India is in the nature of a survival of a once universal custom. Another point to which I wish to draw attention is the bearing upon the antiquity of trade relations between India and the Persian Gulf in the recognition I made last year of several exhibits in the Louvre as consisting of objects carved from the shell of the Indian conch. True it is that they go back only some 500 years B.C. but it is some-\n\n13. HORNELI THE INDIAN CONCH 3 thing definitely accomplished when we can say with certainty that at this date we have positive evidence of the employment of the Indian chank, probably in religious service, in one of the great capitals of the Achsemenid dynasty of Persia. An examination of remains from Babylonian and Assyrian sites with a view to discover articles cut from this shell might well have profitable and important historical results. I am well aware of the many lacunae in the story I offer, particularly in regard to ancient references to the Sankka preserved in the Sanscrit classics ; there may also be many valuable passages in ancient Gujarati works ; these were sealed books to me and I can but hope that others with the necessary qualifications may make good what is wanting in the present account. LIFE-HISTORY AND LOCAL RACES The Indian Conch, Turbinella pyrum, Linn., is a handsome gastropod mollusc found in Indian waters in large numbers in comparatively shallow water. Its geographical distribution is peculiar ; on the west coast of India large numbers are fished off the Kathia- war coast, but southward of this, we find no trace of the chank till we reach the southern coastline of Travancore where this shell again appears and forms the object of a small fishery. On the East Coast of India its distribution is more extensive, being found and fished everywhere from Cape Comorin to Madras City. The northern limit on this coast may be placed at the mouths of the Godaveri, where I have found a few shells, all marked by stunted growth—individuals living in an unfavourable environment. The northern shores of Ceylon, from Puttalam in the north-west to Trincomalee on the north-east, yield large numbers of this shell ; it is also to be found at the Andaman Islands. The bottom most favoured of Turbinella pyrum is a sandy one containing a moderate proportion of mud ; this character of bottom is admirably suited to the luxuriant growth of tube-building polychset worms which constitute the main food supply of the chank. These polycheets are of several genera, the most abundant being Terebellids. In some places in the Gulf of Mannar, square miles of sea-bottom are monopolised by these Terebellids and the chanks and echinoderms which prey upon them ; a veritable Tere- bella—Turbinella—Echinoderm formation. The edges of rocky reefs and the sandy patches interspersed among the rocks are other favourite haunts of chanks as the worms on which they prey are usually abundant there. a -2\n\n14. I OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY—PART II Tlio shell o!' the adult chank is characteristically thick-walled and massive; in the live condition the exterior is covered with a dense brown and velvety horny layer, the periostracum ; after death this dries, becomes brittle and eventually peels off, so that shells exposed for any length of time on the sea-shore or buried for any considerable period, become naked and reveal the characteristic snowy-white porcellaneous nature of the shell clearly. In fully grown shells the rows of chestnut brown spots which are normally very distinct on the outer surface in the immature, tend to disappear and often heroine entirely obliterated. Around the mouth, especially along the inner edge of the lip, a faint pink tint is often seen in fully mature shells, while occasionally the whole interior surface of the mouth may assume a brick-red colouration particularly in shells from certain localities. Characteristic of this genus are the three strong columella!' plications or ridges upon the columella ; the trace of a fourth is also frequently present. Local races.—So considerable are the divergences in external form and colour shown by shells of normal individuals of Turbinella pyrum that conchologists have made several pseudo-species out of the principal variations. Intimate acquaintance, extending over a period of upwards of ten years, with all the chank-producing localities on the coasts of India and Ceylon, together with the advantage of having scrutinised several hundred thousand shells, convince me that all the so-called species of Turbinella found in Indian seas are referable to a single species — T. pyrum—and constitute, at the most, varieties of the nature of emphasized local races. Three types exist which may be conveniently described as the obtuse, the central and the elongate. All three forms have their own particular geographical distribution and characteristic physical and biological environment. Normally they respectively occupy well-defined localities. Intermediate forms linking the different main varieties frequently occur, especially where the habitats of two varieties march, forming a debat- able land where it becomes difficult or even impossible to assign the shells there found to one or other variety, so evenly are the respective characteristics balanced. But the vast bulk of the shells fall readily into one or other of the three types. (a). The central variety preponderates largely over the other two ; both numeri- cally and industrially it is the most important and most valuable, being the form specially valued by the shell-bangle manufacturers of Bengal for the purposes of their trade. This type forms the bulk of the immense number fished off the Indian coast of the Gulf of Mannar and around the north of Ceylon, a number averaging some lj million annually. Its range on the Indian coast is straitly limited on the north, where Pamban Pass and the north coast of Rameswaram Island at the head of the Gulf of .Mannar mark the boundary, thence southward it extends along the shores of the Ramnad and Tinnevelly Districts. North-westward of Pamban Pass this variety inarches with that which I shall term obtusa. Off Ceylon this central form is restricted to the northern coasts from the Pearl Banks and Mannar round to Trincomalee on the north-east coast.\n\n16. MARINE ZOOLOGY OF OKHAMANDAL, Pt.

HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 5 The central type has a heavy massive shell, with a well-proportioned and well- defined apical spiral. Apart from the chestnut coloured surface-markings which are extremely variable and tend to disappear with age, these shells are of an opalescent lily-white colour, porcellaneous in texture and slightly translucent when cut into sections. Unlike var. obtusa the colour of the body at the mouth is not deeply tinted ; usually it is of a very pale flesh tint or even quite white, whence comes the Tamil name Vel-vayan or \" white-mouth \" used to designate this variety, which again is split into several local races whereof the principal are known locally as (1) big-bellied chanks and (2) small-bellied chanks. The former come from the beds lying off the mouth of the Tam- braparni River, the other chiefly from the northern beds off Tuticorin. A second location of the central type is found on the coast of Kathiawar, separated from the Gulf of Mannar and Ceylon area by hundreds of miles of sea bottom from which all forms of Turbinella pyrum are absent. (b). Turbinella pyrum, variety obtusa, is very distinctive in shape and sometimes in colouration. The apical spire is emphatically abbreviated, the whorls appearing as though telescoped while the colouring of the body at the mouth opening is frequently of a dark brick-red in shells from the Tanjore coast, most distinctive when compared with the delicate pallor of this region in shells of the central type. The distribution of the obtusa variety includes the littoral waters of the eastern coast line of the Madras Presidency from Pamban Pass in Palk Bay to the delta of the Godaveri River in the north ; the chief fishing grounds are situated in Palk Bay and off the Tanjore coast, where this variety furnishes annually about 200,000 shells to the Calcutta market. The shortening of the apical whorls often becomes extreme and so abbreviated as to be subtruncate and to approach in general form the aboral appearance of a typical Conus. This extreme form appears to arise when the environment is highly unfavourable, such as life in a muddy sea co-ordinated with scarcity of food ; it re- presents an extreme form of stunting, analogous to that seen on those pearl banks where dense over-population reduces the available food supply to a degree insufficient to meet the normal individual requirements. (c). Variety elongata is a much elongated spindle-shaped form found in the Andaman Islands. As var. obtusa is the extreme in variation in the coniform direction so dongata approaches to the long-drawn-out spiral of Fusus. (PI. II., fig. 4). Shells of this variety are very rare on the coast of the Indian mainland but I cannot accept it as anything more than a very well-marked variety of Turbinella pyrum. The anatomy of the body of Turbinella pyrum follows closely the lines of such a typical gastropod as Buccinum (Whelk), and it is unnecessary to go into any details here, save to mention that the sexes are separate, the proboscis much elongated, and the columellar muscles extremely powerful. It is well nigh an impossibility to extract the animal intact from its shell even after death ; the ordinary methods which are readily\n\n18. 6 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY PART TI successful in the case of linednmn are ineffective here, and the aid of a sledge hammer has to lie evoked if we require to dissect the animal. The ova arc deposited in a many-chambered chitinous egg-capsule of striking and peculiar appearance. In general form it is an elongated loosely spiral annulated cylinder, divided transversely by partitions into a number of compartments ; it reminds one of a corrugated and loosely twisted rani's horn. When newly formed it is pale opaque yellow in colour ; with age it darkens and becomes covered with low growths of algse. It stands upright on the sea-bottom, the lower and first formed end rooted in the sand bv means of a broad flange-shaped basal disc. The lower end is narrow, the chambers there small ; these gradually increase in size, till at a point about one-third of the length from the base they attain a maximum size, which is maintained thence to the abruptly truncate summit. Considerable complexity is introduced by the fact that the partitions between the chambers are double and separated by a slight space except along the hinder edge. The partition which forms the floor of each compartment has a crescentic slit parallel with the front edge, hence when the capsule sways to the current the partitions between the chambers gape slightly and so allow a circulation of sea-water within each compartment, thus providing the aeration needed by the larvae. The transverse partitions arc much thinner than the outer wall of the capsule. In each chamber a considerable number of fertilised ova are deposited, embedded in a transparent colourless gelatinous nutritive matrix which entirely fills the chamber. In this nutritive jelly, the stronger of the embryos develop rapidly ; in each chamber an average of six reach the larval stage characterised by the possession of a larval external shell or protoconch ; those that do, grow rapidly and soon pass beyond the protoconch stage, and assume the semblance of adult form provided with a brown-flecked shell measuring eventually slightly over half an inch in length, inclusive of the two and a half whorls of the protoconch which persists both here and into adult life. By the time this size is attained all the nutritive contents of the incubatory chamber, including the remains of the weaker of the brethi'en, have been eaten up by the ravenous young who now find it necessary to leave home in search of food. Their fust step is to eat through the partitions dividing the chambers, a proceeding that results in the bringing together of the whole surviving family numbering usually from 200 to 250 in all. The stronger next eat a way through the outer wall and the whole brood follow to scatter over the adjacent sea-bottom to lead independent lives. The breeding season, when the capsules are fashioned and rooted in the sand, extends throughout January, February and the first half of March. Some divers assert that new capsules are also to be found in June and July, but I have had no opportunity to test this statement. The sexes being separate the divers have several stories to tell anent the breeding habits. Among others they assert that the females are the larger and are attended each by a number of smaller males, who assist in the making of the capsule —\n\n19. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 7 a manifest impossibility. The post-larval rate of growth is quite unknown. On grounds where the food supply is abundant, it appears to be very rapid, for beds which are ex- hausted of adult shells measuring over 2 inches diameter in one year are found the succeeding year with plenty of shells, 3 inches and over in diameter. The chank is an excellent instance of the acquisition by an animal of characters which appear for all practical purposes absolutely perfect to enable it to hold its own with ease in its struggle for existence. Against every one of its known enemies it has evolved suitable means of defence. The massive strength of the shell protects it from the attacks of all ordinary fishes ; the density and thickness of its periostracum give during youth and maturity adequate protection against the insidious attack of the boring sponge, Cliona, and its shell-burrowing congeners ; the strong capsule it constructs for its young gives them adequate protection till they reach a self-supporting stage endowed even at this early period with a fairly strong and resistant shell—one cannot crack it between one's finger and thumb. Its semi-burrowing habits give it great protection against those fishes which have the habit of snapping off the protruded feet of gastropods. Finally the pale yellowish-brown periostracum assimilates closely in colouring to the sand and should be a further protection against its discovery by foes ; to this form of protection I am, however, not inclined to assign great value, for chank divers can distinguish the presence of a chank even when half buried in the sand, and if they can, I feel assured that predatory fish are equally clever. On rare occasions chank shells are found with the larger whorls crushed in ; this is believed to be the work of the great goggle-eyed Ray, Rhinoptera adsjjersa, which has the most powerful milling teeth of any Indian ray or shark. As chanks grow old, their resisting powers diminish, the protecting periostracum receives damage and the burrowing sponge Cliona obtains a lodgment in the shell. Once there, it runs its branching tunnels everywhere in the substance of the shell, converting it into a honey-comb mass. I greatly doubt if this contributes except very occasionally to the death of the chank. This probably occurs usually from senile decay on beds that are not fished commercially. It is noteworthy that beds which have not been fished for some years, contain great numbers of Cliona-burrowed shells, whereas on beds fished regularly the proportion of \" wormed \" shells is so low as to be practically non- existent.\n\n20. II SOURCES OF INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY Every year many lakhs of chank shells are required by the shell-bangle manufac- turers of Dacca. To supply this demand hundreds of fishermen and divers, from Kathia- war in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, search the reefs and scour the sand- flats within the 10-fathom line during the fine weather season ; in some places they wade about in the shallows, in others they bring their catch to the surface in nets, or they may descend themselves to the bottom and hunt it by sight as they swim. Six distinct chank fisheries are carried on at the present day in India seas ; ranked in their geographical order they are situated in the following localities : — (a). Kathiawar ; (b). Travancore ; (c). The Gulf of Mannar (usually called the Tuticorin Fishery) ; (d). Palk Strait (known generally as the Rameswaram and Ceylon Fisheries) ; (c). The Coromandel Coast, from Point Calimere to Madras City. Without exception the chank fishery in each of these localities is considered as a royal prerogative, the monopoly of Government. In practice this prerogative is vari- ously exercised. In the Gulf of Mannar and on the Indian side of Palk Strait, the Madras Government work the fishery departmental] v through an officer of the Fish- eries Department styled the Superintendent of Pearl and Chank Fisheries. On the Coromandel coast the exclusive right to collect is farmed out to a renter for a term of years. The latter administration of the prerogative is also in force in Okhamandal (Kathiawar), where His Highness the < iaekwar of Baroda exercises sovereign rights in the local fishery. In Ceylon the renting system was in force till ]S!io, when it was abandoned in favour of an export duty, a method of securing Government revenue from this source which has continued ever since. In Travancore the dues of Government are collected in the same manner as now prevails in Ceylon. The shells fished off the Kathiawar coast are of good quality, well esteemed in the Bengal trade where they are known as Surti shells—an echo of the day when Surat was the great emporium of the Kathiawar and Konkan coasts. To-day the shells are sent to Bombay, whence they are shipped to Calcutta. The quantity yielded is approximately 200 to 250 bags per annum.\n\n21. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 9 Okhamandal, the north-western extremity of Kathiawar, which forms an outlying portion of the Gaekwar of Baroda's dominions, furnishes a considerable proportion of this export. The right to collect the shells is leased out at intervals for a term of years. Unlike other Indian chank fisheries the shells on this coast are all collected at spring tides when great areas of the littoral are uncovered at the time of low water. A certain proportion of the shells are sold to pilgrims who resort to the holy shrines at Bet and Dwarka, the district of Okhamandal from its association with Krishna forming one of the holy lands of the Hindus, who delight to take home as a sacred souvenir one of the shells loved of this god. Full details of this fishery and of the enactments made to safe- guard it, are to be found in Part I of the present Report. Were diving for these shells to be introduced on the Kathiawar coast a great increase in the yield should be possible. As it is, the warm weather when alone diving can be systematically carried on is unfortunately that when the monsoon is most violent. The chief centres of supply at' the present day are the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay where physical and climatic conditions permit of diving being ultilised to an extent impossible in any of the other fisheries. Indeed chank-diving in these waters has been the regular calling of hundreds of the fishing population from time immemorial and references in Tamil classics make it clear that this fishery was prosecuted with vigour under Pandyan rule as long ago as the beginning of the Christian era ; in those days the headquarters of the industry was at Korkai, an important emporium with a population composed, we are told, in the main of traders, jewellers, pearl-fishers and chank divers. This city, the Kolkhoi of Greek geographers, was situated at the mouth of the Tambra- parni which then entered the sea some 12 miles south of the present-day port of Tuticorin. The relative importance of the various centres is shown clearly in the following table compiled from the Bengal customs returns for the eight years from 1905-1913. Table showing the Value of Imports of Chank Shells into Calcutta from 1905 to 1913.\n\n22. 10 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY—PART II The export from Bombay consists solely of shells fished on the Kathiawar coast, BO far as I am able to learn. These \" Surti \" shells, as they are known in trade circles, share with the Tuticorin and Rameswaram shells the honour of being esteemed of first quality. To-day these shells command an average price of not less than Rs. 180 per 1,000 in the wholesale market at Calcutta. From the foregoing facts it is abundantly clear that, barring the pearl fisheries of the Gulf of Mannar, the chank fishery is beyond comparison the most important of Indian shell-fish industries. Year in and year out the chank fishery produces regularly from 2 to 2| lakhs of rupees per annum (£13,300 to £16,600) whereas the pearl fishery may prove wholly unproductive for many years together, though when it does yield a return, it does so with no niggard hand. The pearl fishery owes much to the chank- fishery ; the latter is the school where boys and men of the fisher population pass their apprenticeship and qualify for the feverish days of a pearl fishery—a time when a gambler's lust for gain enters the diver's breast and makes him forget or ignore danger, and despise sleep and comfort in the race to gather the pearly treasures put at his disposal for an all-too-brief season, counted by days, and limited by the tempest.\n\n23. Ill THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE CHANK IN INDIAN RELIGION AND LIFE (1). Legendary and Historical. When and how the cult of the chank as a religious symbol originated in India are questions going back so far beyond any traditions now existing that the utmost diffi- culty confronts us when we seek to find their solution. One main fact alone seems certain and that is the non-Aryan origin of this symbol. The Aryan-speaking hordes which descended upon the Punjab through the N.W. passes perhaps 2,000 years or more B.C., certainly did not bring the custom with them. They, the warrior ploughmen and herds- men of the plains of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, had never seen the sea; they knew not as yet the deep sonorous boom of the snow-white chank—a note on a curved cattle- horn was with them the signal between scattered bands, while their hymns tell us that in music they used the drum, the flute and the lute. Vishnu, the God whose emblems include the chank, is barely mentioned in the Rig-Veda and the few Vedic hymns to him were probably composed after long intercourse had been established with the Dravi- dians, the chief race whom the invaders found in possession of the new land. He is almost certainly one of the gods borrowed from the indigenous people as his complexion is characteristically represented as dark-hued whenever his image is shown in colour. I am strongly of opinion that the key to the problem is to be sought in the custom prevalent among animists—the worshippers of evil spirits—of employing noise to scare the demons they fear. At the present day Bengali Hindus make a practice of sounding the conch which each household keeps for religious rites whenever an eclipse or an earth- quake occurs. Clearly this is a survival of the use of loud blasts on a shell to scare away evil spirits—the demon intent on devouring the moon or the sun, or shaking in fury the foundations of the world. This custom at once conferred religious significance upon the shell whose noise frightens the evil spirit and restores peace ; thenceforward the shell would be honoured and held sacred. Probably it was associated with one particular god, the prototype of Vishnu, and, with his adoption into the Aryan Pantheon, his emblem and weapon against the powers of evil would accompany him, and become endowed with still greater and deeper religious significance. When the hungry swarms of Aryan tribesmen descended upon north-west India, the whole land, with the exception of the north-east corner, was occupied by a long-\n\n24. 12 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY—PART II settled aboriginal population, split into many states and tribes vastly differing in civili- sation. Many tribes, particularly those living in the mountains and dense forests and less accessible districts, were in the lowest possible stage, naked savages living on fruits and small game and maintaining a precarious defence against wild beasts by means of rude stone weapons and cudgels. In the south, especially in the maritime districts, a high civilisation developed at a comparatively early date and when the Aryan invaders were lighting their wav into the Punjab against wild and semi-savage tribes, in appearance and customs probably much like the Santals 50 years ago, the men of the south were then or shortly later engaged in commercial relations with Babylon and the coastal districts of the Persian Gulf and Red Sea; partly through the stimulation received from this intercourse with these seats of ancient civilisation and partly from indigenous effort these southern Dravidians were evolving a language unsurpassed for its richness and flexibility and its power to express with perfect felicity the highest flights of imagina- tion which poets and philosophers can reach, together with a material civilisation of no mean order. It is to these coastal Dravidians settled in the prosperous sea-ports situated on the western shore of the Gulf of Mannar or to men of the same race living on the Kathiawar coast that the first use of the chank must be traced. Both localities were the seats of pearl fisheries and the centres whence much oversea traffic flowed coastwise to Persia, Egypt and the adjacent Semitic lands. The chank and the pearl-oyster are usually associated in Indian waters, the chank on the sandy patches interspersed with the rocky patches which form the habitat of the pearl-oyster ; pearl fishers often bring chanks ashore and thus the beauty of their snowy white porcelain-like massive shells would early become familiar to the merchants gathered from many lands to purchase pearls. The word itself, in its chief forms of chanku or sanhu in Tamil and sankha in Sanscrit, appears to be of Aryan origin ; the Indian names are all obviously variants of one root and this is identifiable with the Greek kmgche (xoyxv) and the Latin concha, both meaning a shell. It is probable that when the Aryans swarmed into India they applied their generic name for shells to the great white conch so conspicuous an object in the hands of their enemies, and so it is that, just as Christians in calling their scriptures by the Greek word for book (Biblos) imply thereby that it is \" The Book \" pre-eminent and supreme, so the Aryans appear to have similarly lauded the chank as \" The Shell \" and considered no qualifying term necessary. To them it was the shell of shells the one shell above all others worthy of honour and even of worship. In the oldest Tamil literature the word is found in its present-day form but almost as often the shell is termed valai the latter is probably the original Tamil or Dravidian name, a term which has now come to be displaced by one derived from the Sanscrit sankha. We may infer that when these ancient poems were written the Brahmans had alreadv acquired great influence and were engaged in forcing Aryan forms and Sanscrit terms into the language of the Tamil country by virtue of their religious and literary\n\n25. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 13 ascendancy. As the religious leaders of the country, Sanscrit terms in constant use in their prayers and services would soon become dominant and be absorbed into the language of the country, in the way that Norman culinary terms readily found acceptance in the English language because of the superiority of the Normans to the Saxons in this particular art. Thus it has happened that the Sanscrit term for Turbinella pyrum gradually but surely ousted the indigenous Tamil term. Finally it is worthy of note that the English word \" conch \" is again another variant of the words chanku and sankha. The earliest notices of the use of the chank are entirely of a secular nature, and occur in the two great Indian epics, the Eamayana and the Mahabharata. In these we get frequent reference to the employment of the chank as a martial trumpet by the great warriors whose more or less mythical exploits are recounted. Particularly is this the case in the Mahabharata, where in the Bhagavat-Gita we find the heroes endeavouring to terrify their foes with loud blasts on their battle-conchs, even as their forefathers scared away the evil-working spirits of the village. Each hero has his famous conch distinguished by some high-sounding name, just as the famous swords of European legendary heroes were frequently given names that have become immortal in song and story. The beautiful Excalibur wielded by Arthur in many glorious fights, Charlemagne's famous Joyeuse, and the magic Tyrfing so oft the theme of Viking sagas, have their parallels in the names of the conchs of the Mahabharata heroes. When the opposing hosts of Kauravas and Pandavas confronted each other on the field of Kurukshetra, we read in the Bhagavat-Gita (verses 11 to 19) how the prelude to battle was the deafening clamour sounded by the leaders on their great conchs. \" The Ancient of the Kurus, the Grandsire (Bhisma), the glorious, sounded on high his conch, ' The Lion's Roar.' \" Then conchs and kettledrums, tabors and drums and cowhorns suddenly blared forth with tumultuous clamour. \" Stationed in their great war-chariot yoked to white horses, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) blew their divine conchs. '' Panchajanya was blown by Hrishikisha (Krishna) and Devadatta by Dhananjaya (Arjuna). Vrikodara (Bhima) of terrible deeds blew his mighty conch, Paundra. \" The king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew Anantavijaya ; Nakula and Saha- deva blew their conchs Sughosha and Manipushpaka. \" And Kashya of the great bow, and Shikhandi, the mighty carwarrior, Dristadvuinna and Virata and Satykai, the unconquered. \" Drupada and the Draupadeyas, Lord of Earth, and Saubhadra, the mighty- armed, on all sides their several conchs blew. ' That tumultuous uproar rent the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra, filling the earth and sky with sound.\" Here the names of the conchs possessed by all the five Pandava brothers are given,\n\n26. II OKHAM M>.1, MA I; INK ZOOLOGY—PART II —Paundra, Devadatta, Anantavijaya, Sughosha and Manipuslipaka. Paundra appears to have been named from l'undra, a demon killed by Bhima ; the others signify re- spectively God-given, Eternal Victory, Sweet Voice or Honey-tone, and Jewel-blossom. Here too we hear for the first time the name Panchajanya given to the conch of Krishna, King of the Ya< lavas, who had espoused the Pandavan cause. Around this famous shell many legends have gathered and now we see it held on high in most figures of Vishnu, who is considered by Hindus to have been re-incarnated in Krishna, the wise and good king of the Yadavas. According to one legend Panchajanya was originally the shell home of a terrible marine demon, Panchajana, so named as he was a foe to the five kinds of beings (jano), to wit, gods, men, gandharvas, serpents and ghosts or non-incorporated spirits. Panchajana lived on the sea bottom and at last filled the measure of his misdeeds by seizing the son of Sandipani, who had taught Krishna the use of arms. The God, fearless of consequences, rushed to the help of the child, assuming the form of a fish ; after a terrible struggle he vanquished the demon and brought away his shell as a trophy, since accounted one of the emblems of Vishnu and Krishna. Tod, the author of the famous Amials of Rajasthan, in his \" Travels in Western India,\" published 1839, in describing his visit to Dwarka and its neighbourhood gives a variant of this story and as the passage is most interesting no apology is needed for its reproduction in full. Under date January 1, 1823, he writes, \"Crossed over to the Pirates' isle, emphatically called Bate, or ' the island,' but in the classic traditions of the Hindu, Sankhodwara, or ' the door of the shell,' one of the most sacred spots of his faith. It was here that Crishna 1 or Kanya acted the part of the Pythian Apollo, and redeemed the sacred books, slaying his hydra foe, Takshac, who had purloined and con- cealed them in one of those gigantic shells whence the island has its name. The whole history of Kanya, or Crishna, who assumed the form of Vishnu, is allegorical, but neither devoid of interest nor incapable of solution. There is no part of their mythology more easy of illustration than this, which is allusive to the sectarian warfare carried on at this period between the new sect of Vishnuvites and the more ancient one of Budha. The races who supported the religion of Crishna are typified under his emblem, Garuda, or the eagle ; while their wily adversary, the Budhist, is figured by the Tacshac, Naga, or serpent, a denomination given to the races of northern origin, which at various periods overran India, and of which were Taksiles (the friend of Alexander, the site of whose capital is still preserved in the Memoirs of Baber) and the still more famed Tacshac Salivahan, the foe of Vikrama. In the legend of the Yadu (Yadava) prince, Crishna (himself a seceder from the faith of Budha Trivicrama to that of Vishnu, if not its founder), receiving the sacred volumes from his hydra foe at this 1 Tod notes \"Kanya, or Vishnu, resembles the sun-god of the Egyptians in name as well as symbols. K an was one name of the sun in Egypt, and his eagle-head is a well known type.\" With regard to the extract given in the text, it has d> he remembered that Tod's mythological explanations are not always reliable.\n\n27. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 15 remote point of Hinduism, as well as his first combat with him in the Jumna, we have but the continuance of the same sectarian warfare, in which Crishna was in this instance successful, driving them before him both in the north of India and here : thus, his title of Rinchor was given on his defeat by Jarasindha, the King of Magadha, of the heretical faith, and at length these religious and civil conflicts led to his death, and the dispersion of the Yadu race of which he was the chief support. These Yadus, I surmise to have been all originally Budhists, and of Indo-Getic origin, as their habits of polyandrism alone would almost demonstrate ; and when we find the best- informed of the Jains assuring us that Nemnat'h, the twenty-second Budha, was not only Yadu, but the near kinsman of Crishna, all doubt is at an end ; and I am strongly inclined to pronounce decidedly, what I have before only suggested, that the Yadus are the Yute, or ancient Getes of the Jaxartes, amongst whom, according to Professor Newmann from Chinese authorities, one of the Shamanean sages sprung, eight hundred years before Christ. Both Nemnat'h and Sham-nat'h have the same personal epithets, derived from their dark complexions, the first being familiarly called Arishta-Nemi, ' the black Nemi,' the other Sham and Crishna, both also meaning ' dark-coloured ' ; and when this is not only confirmed by tradition, but the shrine of Budha itself is yet preserved within that of Crishna at Dwarica we have no reason to question that his faith, prior to his own deification, was that of Budha.\" Always is Krishna's chank represented as a sinistral abnormality, and legend pic- tures to the mind of the devout Hindu every shell of this rare form when alive as a marvellous production receiving the homage of thousands of chanks of ordinary form, which crowd around it on all sides. Another myth is related by Baldaeus, the chaplain to the Dutch forces which wrested Ceylon from the Portuguese, to the effect that Garuda, the eagle vehicle or attendant (almost certainly the hawk-headed deity of Assyria) of Vishnu flew in all haste to Brahma and brought to Krishna \" the chianko or kink- horn twisted to the right.\" : Vishnu derives several of his alternative names from his chank symbol, as Chankapani, the \" chank-armed,\" and Chankamenthi, the \" chank- bearer.\" Krishna, when represented as a herdsman under the form of Govinda or Gopala, usually bears a conch in his hand and possibly the origin of this may be sought in the use a herdsman may make of it to call together his scattered charge just as the shepherds of Corsica and Sardinia at the present day use a great Triton shell (Tritoniitm nodu- liferum) for a like purpose. A curious and most significant fact is that the twenty-second Tirthankar of the Jains, Nemi or Nemnath, who, legend says, was the son of King Samudravijaya of the race 1 With the contradiction which exists between East and West in so many matters, the abnormal twist in these shells is termed the left-handed or sinistral by Europeans, whereas Indians term it right- handed. They view it from the mouth end, we from the apex, and accordingly confusion is frequent in conversation on this subject with Indians.\n\n28. 16 <>K HA MANDAL MARTNE ZOOLOGY—PAKT TI nl Hariyansa and a cousin to Krishna, has a conch as his emblem and is represented in .lain statues as being of a black colour. The black image of Xemi in the Xemnath temple on Mount Girnar in Kathiawar is a well-known example. The dark hue under which Vishnu and Krishna are always represented by Hindus and the black colour of his cousin Nenii. the .lain Tirthankar, go far to show that these gods and teachers belonged not to the Aryan race but to nations of I bavidian origin in the forefront of the earliest indigenous civilization in North India or Hindustan. With them in particular. is the conch most definitely associated ; there is strong presumption on this and other grounds already referred to. to believe that it was the Dravidians who first employed the chank as a battle-conch and that this custom was adopted by the Aryan invaders as blood connections began to be formed in increasing numbers with the Dravidian nobility of the land and when certain of the Dravidian gods were admitted to the Aryan pantheon. The Aryans would be particularly eager to acquire fine conchs both for use and ornament; their deep-voiced boom would prove their utility as battle-trumpets to enspirit and to give signals, while their rare white beauty would appeal to the religious sense as making them fit vessels wherewith to offer libations to their gods. To an inland people the beautiful products of the sea assume a double value from their strangeness and rarity and mysterious origin. To-day the people of Tibet, cut off from all know- ledge of the sea, esteem pearls and red coral, tortoise-shell and amber, among the greatest treasures within their knowledge. The wild Nagas of the Assam hills equally prized the snow-white chank shell itself till some 50 years ago, using it as part of their accepted currency at the rates enumerated on page 43. As the Aryan hosts advanced into India they must have captured numbers of battle conchs from time to time and there can be no doubt they early adopted them in place of their own less sonorous cow-horns. Indeed the boom of the conch has been the battle signal throughout the ages in India, and this custom has lasted almost to the present day. Ancient Tamil and Rajput poems descriptive of battles and raids continually refer to the clamour of the conchs blown as the opposing parties approached each other ; the etiquette of old Indian chivalry required a prelude of challenging conch-blowing before the serious fight was begun ; the long-drawn hollow sonorous note of the chank often greeted early British commanders as they led their forces to the assault; until the beginning of last century Marathi and Pindari chiefs called their followers together and heartened them for the fray by loud blasts on conch-horns. Even in very recent days the chank's voice has called our enemies to the attack, and this too by other foes than Hindus. The graphic pen of Percival Landon in his \" Lhasa \"—an account of the British Mission to Thibet in 190.3 4. in describing a night cannonade of the British Commissioner's post outside of Gyantse by the Thibetans, paints a word picture worthy of quotation:—\" As one peers out into the warm night a long monotone is faintly droned out from the darkness ahead. It is one of the huge conch shells in the jong and it may only mean a call to prayer the ' hours ' of Lamaism are unending—but as the moaning note persists softly and steadily\n\n29. HORNELL—THE TNDIAN CONCH 17 a vivid speck of flame stabs the darkness across the river. A second later the report of the gun accompanies a prolonged ' the-e-es' overhead.\" From the earliest times the conch has also been used in India to call the people to their sacrifices and other religious rites, as an instrument of invocation to call the attention of the gods to the ceremonies to be performed, and as a means to keep evil spirits at a distance and to prevent their entry into houses and temples. With this intimate association with the chief religious rites, the people gradually came to reverence the instrument itself, and to adore and invoke it (see p. 22 for details), as is also done with regard to many other instruments or articles of sacrifice in Hindu rites at the present day ; these latter do not, however, appeal in equal measure to the religious feelings of the multitude, for around them have not been woven the myths and legends pertaining to the chank. In the ceremonies attending the coronation of great kings the chank naturally played an important part. At the time when the Mahabharata was put into its present form, this custom was fully developed to judge from the description of the coronation of King Yudhistira given in the Shantiparwa of that epic. To quote from an interesting summary by Rao Sahib P. B. Joshi 1 \"Kings of different countries, learned Brahmans and sages were invited for the ceremony. A Yedi or sacrificial altar was prepared. There were brought Samidhas or pieces of sacred wood, five kinds of sacrei leaves, waters of the holy rivers and of the four seas, seven kinds of holy earth, the sacred conch shell, a white umbrella, and white Chamars. The horses and elephants used in connection with the coronation ceremony were also white. Yudhistir was then made to sit on a throne of gold, and other members of the royal family sat on seats made of ivory, and close by sat the king's spiritual guide and other sages. The king was now requested to touch such auspicious articles as corn, white flowers, swastika, gold, silver aud jewels. The king's ministers and other high functionaries were now brought betore him by the royal priest and they all paid their homage to their sovereign. The sacred fire was then kindled, the king and queen sat in front of the holy fire on seats covered over with tiger's skin, and made offerings to the fire. Shri Krishna then got up, took in his hand the sacred conch-shell, which was filled with holy water, sprinkled the water over the heads of the king and queen and said : ' I sprinkle this holy water over you to indicate that from this day you have become the paramount sovereign of Bharat Varsha.' At this time dhundubi and other musical instruments were sounded, drums were beaten, the king's bards sang the praise of the king and wished him victory and long life.\" In Bengal every marriage conducted according to Hindu ceremonial includes the placing of chank-bangles, lacquered red, upon the bride's wrists. An iron bangle placed on the left wrist is also essential to the ceremony. Elsewhere this particular marriage custom is scarcely ever practised, but sufficient instances are recorded among a few widely scattered castes and caste-sections of the existence of a similar marriage custom 1 The Times of India Illustrated Weekly, 20th September, 1911. I!\n\n30. 18 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY—PART II elsewhere to tempt us to believe thai at one time it was the general custom of all rally Hinduised castes throughout India. Finds of fragments of chank-bangles in places w here the use of these ornaments is non-existent at the present day strengthen the theory. Legendary lore can also he quoted in support. For instance, among the Balijas tit Telugu districts, who there constitute the chief trading caste, a legend is current (Thurston, I. p. 137) that \" Oil one occasion Siva wanted his consort Parvati to appear before him in all her glory. But. when she stood before him, fully decorated, he laughed and said that she was not as charming as she might be. On this, she prayed that Siva would help her to become so. From his braid of hair Siva created a being who descended on the earth, bearing a number of bangles and turmeric paste, with which Parvati adorned herself. Siva, being greatly pleased with her appearance, told her to look at herself in a looking-glass. The being who brought the bangles is believed to have been the ancestor of the Gazula Balijas.\" The latter sub-division of the Balijas peddle glass bangles only at the present day, but it is reasonable to suppose that before the discovery of glass, their stock in trade consisted instead of chank bangles. It is indeed probable that the introduction of glass dealt a heavy blow to the employment of the chank shell in feminine adornment in certain districts, particularly, for instance, in those where, as in Vizagapatam, glass factories being established, glass bangles were put on sale at a fraction of the cost of the compara- tively expensive chank ones, which require the expenditure of much time and labour to render them attractive. Another legend, prevalent among the Sangukatti Idaiyans, the great pastoral or shepherd caste of Tamil India, narrates that when Krishna desired to marry Rukmani, her family insisted on marrying her to Sishupalen. When the wedding was about to take place, Krishna carried off Rukmani and placed a bangle made of chank-shell on her wrist (Thurston, II, p. 354). These particular Idaiyans belong to one of the sections of this caste which to-day require their married women to wear these bangles—now a very rare custom in South India. Indian sources give the barest indications of the traffic in chank shells that must have been brisk for 3,000 years or more between the fisheries in the (Julf of Mannar and on the Kathiawar coast and the inland nations of the Deccan and Hindustan. (2) Present Day Uses. (a) in religious ceremonial (including marriage and death rites), and vulgar superstition. We have already seen that the chank is one of the two most important symbols — the other being the wheel or chakram—associated by Hindus with Vishnu, the second person in the Brahmanic trinity or Trimurthi. The majority of the avatars or incar-\n\n31. HORNELI THE INDIAN CONCH 19 nations of Vishnu are also occasionally represented as holding a chank in the hand : Matsya, in the form of a fish, Kurma the tortoise, Varaha the boar, and Narsingha the man- lion, are avatars sometimes sculptured holding Vishnu's chank : more frequently Krishna is thus depicted. Narayana, the god dwelling in the sun, another form of Vishnu, is similarly represented in human form with a chank in one hand and a discus (chakram) in the other. On rare occasions Siva is also depicted as holding a chank in one hand. In all these instances the chank represented is of the sinistral or left-handed form, a rarity so choice and valuable as to be worthy to form an adornment of a god. No more fitting gift to a deity can be imagined ; as the symbol of the god who divides with Siva the worship of the Hindu world, as a production of nature so scarce as to appear once only in several millions of normally shaped shells and as an emblem of purity, could Hindu find more fitting offering at the shrine of his god ? Thus it is that the pious wealthy have from time to time dedicated these shells to favourite temples—particularly to those that are in high esteem at centres of Hindu pilgrimage. Chanks are held in special veneration at those shrines where the cult of Krishna is the predominant feature of worship, and in those localities rendered sacred to Hindus because of their reputed association with this deity while sojourning on earth. Chief among the former is the great religious centre of the Madhva sect at Udipi in South Canara. There around a temple dedicated to Krishna are disposed eight mutts, or religious colleges, whereof the priesthood is a peregrinating fraternity, who tour the country to confirm in their faith the scattered members of their community— a procedure which consists in branding with hot irons the deity's symbols of the chank and the wheel upon the arms of the faithful. Usually the priests of seven mutts are on tour ; the head of one mutt takes charge in rotation of the Udipi temple and for a period of two years carries on the services and provides the funds necessary for the lavish charity dispensed daily by the temple. The members of this sect have a great reputation for active piety and the priesthood of each mutt vie with those of the others in collecting precious vessels for use in the service of the deity. The sinistral chank is the principal of these, and so it comes about that in the eight mutts at Udipi is gathered an unique collection of these rarities. During a recent visit to this place the Swamiyar or high-priest was good enough to show me the four which belong to his mutt—the Puttige mutt. Of these, two were handsomely mounted in richly chased gold, the others in silver. All were rather small in size and one appeared to be of the sub-fossil description frequently found buried in muddy deposits in shallow lagoons in the north of Ceylon. A census of the sinistral shells possessed by the whole eight mutts was not possible, but from the information received from the high priest there cannot be less than thirty of these shells in the town, allowing the low average of three to each mutt and six for those possessed by wealthy Hindus who are not of the priesthood. After Udipi, probably the largest number of sinistral chanks are to be found in the B •_»\n\n32. 20 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY PART II temples of the Bacred land of Kathiawar, rich in its association with the later life of Krishna : while in Bet in 1906, I found richly ornamented sinistral chanks in the Shank Xaravan. Lakhsmi and Satya Bhamaji temples. (Plate I.) That in the last named is a particularly large and handsome shell, probably the finest sinistral chank in existence and consequently an almost priceless treasure. The shell possessed |>y the Shank Narayan temple is a small elongated specimen offered at the shrine some twenty years ago by a Bat hia from Zanzibar : that of the Laksmi temple is a short broad one of small size with handsome arabesque ornamentation on the mounting—it lias been in the possession of the temple since Samvat 1890 (A.l). 1835). At Benares, temple treasures include similar examples, while in the south of India, where opportunities to obtain these shells are great, a considerable number of the temples of that devout land possess one or more. Those at Rameswaram, Trichendur and Madura may be instanced. The temple at Rameswaram, one of the four most holy places of pilgrimage among Hindus, possesses four shells ; of these three are very ancient and date from the days when the munificence of the Madura and Ramnad rulers endowed this temple with a share of the produce of the local pearl and chank fisheries. The shells in the Trichendur Temple, a towering pile overlooking a sea where chank fishing still flourishes, are derived likewise from a privilege share possessed formerly by the temple in this fishery. It is noteworthy that although Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu, is especially associated with the Rameswaram temple, the actual deity represented in the inmost shrine is the phallic lingani of Siva. On important religious festivals water is poured into the sinistral chanks, and after Vedic chants have been sung and prayers offered, the water thus consecrated is poured over the lingam. It is remarkable also and indicative that this custom has not originated with modern Hinduism, that sinistral chanks are objects of adoration among northern Buddhists. Sarat Chandra Das, the intrepid survey officer who spent some perilous years in Thibet, mentions (Journey to Lhasa. London, 1902) that in the Sakya Monastery lying to the south-west of Shigatze there is preserved in the temple a chank of this rare form. Its history is invested with more than ordinary interest, for the monastic records state that it was a present from Kublai Khan, the great Tartar conqueror of China and patron of the Polos, to Phagpa, a hierarch of Sakya whom Kublai made ruler of Thibet in the second half of the thirteenth century. Sarat Chandra Das mentions that this famous shell is blown by the lamas only when the request is accompanied by a present of seven ounces of silver, but to have it blown \" is held to be an act of great merit.\" In Thibet these left-handed chanks are called Ya chrii dung-kar and in Chinese )n hsuan pai-lei. The people of both countries consider such shells as treasures of inestimable value. In 18(i7, one was known to be kept at Fuchu by the Ti-tuh (Peking Gazette, February 23rd, 18(i7) and one at Lhasa (fide an editorial note in Das, \" Journey to Lhasa,\" above quoted). At one time the value of these shells is said to have been assessed at their weight in\n\n33. HORN ELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 21 gold and this statement is probably correct. To-day they are less valuable and small and imperfect ones occasionally change hands in the north of Ceylon at Rs. 60 to Rs. 90 each (say £4 to £6) ; such shells are usually sub-fossil ones found buried in deep mud. Large good-conditioned sinistral shells obtained alive, and therefore of good colour, still command high rates- anything from Rs. 400 to Rs. 5,000 or more—so infrequently are they found. The method of estimating the approximate value of these latter shells is as follows — if the shell be of 100 rupees' weight or over (one standard coin weighs exactly one tola ; 2 tolas = one ounce) the value is calculated at the rate of Rs. 50 per tola or rupee's weight ; thus a shell of 110 rupees' weight would be estimated accordingly to this method at Rs. 5,500. When the weight is between 30 and 100 tolas then the rate per tola may be taken at Rs. 30/- to Rs. 40/- according to size and quality ; a 50 tola weight shell would be worth from Rs. 1 ,500 to Rs. 2,000. If of 25 tolas' weight the rate may vary from Rs. 5/- to Rs. 20- per tola. Wealthy Hindu Rajahs and Zamindars also aspire to possess these sacrosanct shells, the orthodox in order that they may use them to perform abeyshekmn ' in their family shrine and others for the ostentatious pride of possession and because of the superstition generally current which accounts the ownership of a Valampuri chank as conferring prosperity upon the household owning it. I know also a wealthy Muhammadan Marakkayar who has refused offers of several hundreds of rupees for one of these shells ; to him the shell is a mascot, the bringer of good luck. The result of my inquiries indicates that there exist at present in India not less than 120 sinistral chank shells. I know the actual whereabouts of 60 and I am well satisfied that it is improbable that I have overestimated the remainder at an equal number. The chank shell is so massive and strong as to be practically indestructible under ordinary circumstances. I have found chank artifacts in the ruins of Korkai, the Kolkhoi of the old Greek and Egyptian geographers, which though over 1,000 years old are in- distinguishable except in colour from fragments cut in Dacca workshops to-day. Hence the sinistral shells now found in Hindu temples should represent the aggregate catch of this abnormality for several hundreds of years. If we place the period at the conser- vative limit of 300 years we shall find the percentage borne by sinistral to normal dextral shells an extremely small one. Elsewhere (Madras Fisheries Bulletin, No. 7) I have shown that the average catch of chank shells off the Indian and Ceylon coasts aggregates 2,500,000 per annum. There is reason to believe that a hundred years ago the average was considerably higher but some allowance must be made for interruptions in the fishery due to political unrest in the troublous times prior to the coming of the Pax Britauaica. 2| millions of shells are therefore probably a fairly accurate approxi- 1 The worship of the gods with libations.\n\n34. 22 OK II AM AN DAL MA KINK ZOOLOGY—PART II matron. At this rate the produce of the past 300 years would amount to a total of 750,000,000 shells ; the 120 sinistral shells believed to exist now thus give the infinitesimal latin (if one shell to <i{ millions of normal ones, and this proportion undoubtedly gives a substantially accurate idea of the great rarity of the abnormal form. Among the ignorant who usually have never even seen a Yalampuri chank, the belief is prevalent in Tamil South India that it blows of its own accord during the night ; even the Roman Catholic chank- divers of Tuticorin entertain this quaint superstition, and say that the shell is specially clamorous on Tuesday and Friday nights ! A yogi when controlling or retaining his breath is also credited with hearing the sound of a Valampuri chank blowing within his abdomen though why the rumbling should be that of a Valampuri ami not of an ordinary chank is hard to answer. Worship of the chank as one of the three essential articles used in domestic worship among Brahmans should occupy an important part in the daily liturgy of this priestly caste ami in the Brahma Karma, the work which sets forth in minute detail the order and phrasing of the sacred rites of the Brahmans, the prayer to the sacred chank may be translated as follows : — Taking the chank in his hand the Brahman recites : \" At the mouth of this shell is the God of the Moon, on its sides is Varuna. on its back Prajapati, and on its apex the Ganges, the Safasvati, and all the other sacred rivers of the three worlds in which they make ablutions according to the command of Vasudeva. 1 In this chank is the chief of the Brahmans (Brahmendra or Brahmanaspati). This is why we must worship the sacred (hank, (ilorv to thee, sacred shell, blessed by all the gods, born in the sea, and formerly held by Vishnu in his hand. We adore the sacred chank and meditate upon it. .May we be filled with joy ! \" I offer (to the chank) everything needful for worship—perfumes, rice and flowers.\" Here they make the sign of the chank, but Bourquin (\" Annales du Musee < unmet,\"' Vol. VII, p. -45). from whom I quote, says he was never able to discover the manner of making this sign and I have had a like ill-success. While the above is a portion of the liturgy which the head of each Brahman family is theoretically bound to recite daily, under present-day conditions this is impossible, and in fact it is only on specially important puja or holy days that even a greatly curtailed version of this and the accompanying prayers is recited by the head of the family, and this, too, only in thoroughly orthodox families. The curtailed prayer usually runs, \" < >h. chank shell, thou wast produced in the sea and art held by Vishnu in his hand. Thou ait worshipped by all the gods. Receive my homage.\" In this connection an interesting chank legend centres round the temple tank in Tirukalikundram, a holy Saivite village in the Chingleput District, some 37 miles south- ward of Madras. The village munsiff. Mr. T. A. Vedachala Gurukkal, to whom I am in- debted for the following particulars, states that once every twelve years a chank rises 1 < >ue of the names <if Krishna.\n\n35. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 23 to the surface of the large sacred bathing tank called Sanku Theertham. Three days before this marvellous occurrence, the water in the tank is greatly agitated, foaming and boiling to the accompaniment of considerable noise. On the appearance of the chank the foam subsides and the sound ceases. Then the chank comes to the side where it is picked up, purified and holy water sprinkled upon it. Thus consecrated it is carried in solemn procession through the village to the Vethagiriswarar temple, where it is placed in the treasury with the rest of the temple treasures. Locally this chank is considered superior to all other chanks in the world and the origin of the periodic miracle is narrated as follows : — When the sage Markkandeya was visiting the sacred places with his disciple, the latter forgot to bring the Siva puja-box containing the chank required for the libation necessary in the ritual of worship. The sage took his bath in the tank and as puja time was fast approaching he prayed to be helped in this misfortune. As a result of his prayer and by the special grace of the deity, a chank appeared in the tank. Then he placed a lingam before him and, with the help of the chank miraculously provided, performed his worship in an acceptable and proper manner. He also prayed that a chank might appear each day he should worship at this tank. The Puranas say that this request was granted and has been since continued until the present day. In this connection my informant remarks that it is to be noted that twelve ordinary years constitute one divine day. Thousands of pilgrims resort to the Tirukalikundram shrines each year and the marvel of this story is one of the great assets of the place just as is the periodic lique- faction of blood to the shrine of San (xennario in Naples. In temple worship, the chank fulfils important service. The ordinary and sinistral forms are both employed whenever the temple possesses them. The former is used in the menial duty of summoning the god's attention, announcing the commencement of the principal rites as well as in calling the devout to worship ; such are among the general explanations given for its employment, but some ethnologists hold that the innate and primitive significance of the use of the blowing chank in temple worship is to scare away hostile and evil-working spirits. This is a reasonable belief as there is little or no doubt that the chank was used originally as a horn or trumpet by tribes holding animistic beliefs prior to the development of the Brahman religion which appears to have adopted the use of the chank in religious ceremonies together with many other rites from the devil-fearing tribes who gradually came into the fold of the new and higher religious belief. In this connection should be mentioned the custom which prevails largely in Bengal of keeping blowing chanks in the houses of the better class people for use in family worship. Mr. A. R.' Banerji, I.C.S., the late Dewan of Cochin State, informs me that it is a general custom in Bengal to turn out with these shells during eclipses and earthquakes and to keep up a continuous blowing till the eclipse or earthquake be over. A rather strking effect is produced when the chank is used in temple ritual as a\n\n36. 24 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY—PART II sort of rlivtliiiiical accompaniment when it plays the part of kannagolu or talavinyasa.' hi Hindu temples the four daily services take place before dawn, at noon, at sunset, and at !t oi 1<» P.M. Ar those times the Ochchans, the caste entrusted solely in the Tamil country with the duty of chank-blowing in temples, announce the commencement of each service and punctuate the various rites with the drone of their shell according to the customary ritual. Among the Triyas the corresponding caste of temple servants is that of the Ravulos, whose caste duty is to sound the chank during services in Saivite temples when the god is being taken in procession as also to prepare garlands of Mowers lor the adornment ol the god. hike the Ochchans, they are not usually whole-time servants of the temple, but while the former earn money as musicians at weddings, performing upon a long silver trumpet, the Kfivulos make and sell garlands to the laity. The Ochchans never use the chank except in the temples, whereas the Ravulos are em- ployed to sound it at Brahmans' weddings. It is a rule among the latter that they must possess at least two blowing chanks, lest, losing one, the temple service should suffer in consequence. In Bengal, the Ramavat sect of Vaishnavas pay particular attention to the call of the ehank. By them all forms of worship except the unceasing repetition of the name Rama or Hari are deemed useless, but in every akhara or monastery of the sect an idol is tended at regular hours to the sound of chank shells and gongs, while offerings of fruit and flowers are presented by the laity (Risley, II, p. 340). ('hanks to be used as wind instruments are chosen of as large size as procurable, often 8 inches long by 4 inches in diameter. The only preparation they require is to have the extreme apex removed, usually by hammering. No tune properly so called can be played, but the tone is capable of much modulation by the lips, and the long drawn notes as they drone clear and mellow on the evening breeze have a haunting charm that clings sweet and seductive in the memory ; it has a mystic wail perfect in appropriateness to its religious use before the shrines of the gods of a profoundly philosophical creed. Sinistral shells whenever possessed by a temple, are usually mounted in handsomely decorated golden settings and used as libation vessels in the service of the god. Whether the god he Siva in the form of a lingam, or Vishnu or other deity represented in anthropomorphic shape, the officiating priests must lave it with water rendered sacred by being poured from the mouth of a chank.- On certain auspicious days cow's milk- is used for libations in lieu of water. And if the doubly sacred sinistral chank is not possessed by the temple, then a choice example of the ordinary form must be used. In family devotions the chank is also employed as a libation vessel by strictly devout Brahmans, both Saivites and Vaishnavites.

HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 25 the Brahman head of the family, after taking his bath, prostrates himself before the family shrine and then, chanting some hymns from the Vedas, pours water over the image of the deity from the mouth of a chank shell. Then he dresses the god and commences his prayers. In Thibet the call of the chank is amongst the most familiar sounds to be heard in the monasteries and temples of the Lamaistic faith. The writings of travellers in that most priest-ridden of countries, contain frequent mention of the custom. Sven Hedin for example, when describing the opening ceremonies of the Losar or new year festival which he saw in the great monastery of Tashilunpo in Shigatze—the seat of the Tashi Lama, says : —\" Suddenly from the uppermost platforms on the roof ring out deep, long drawn-out blasts of horns over the country ; a couple of monks show themselves against the sky ; they blow on singular sea-shells, producing a penetrating sound, which is echoed back in shrill and yet heavy tones from the fissured rocks behind the convent : they summon the Gelugpa, the brotherhood of yellow monks, to the festival.\" Tea-drinking among the Lamas must never be missed ; the monks partake of it even in the midst of the most important ceremonies, and to prevent the terrible misfortune of a brother being too late for any distribution of tea, the departure of the novices from the kitchen bearing their loads of hot tea in large copper vessels on their shoulders, is signalled to all in the various halls and cells by a loud call upon a chank-horn from the temple roof. Sven Hedin also describes (\" Trans-Himalaya,\" Vol. II, p. 19) a cave inhabited by a hermit reputed to be one hundred years old, who passed his days crouching in a niche in the wall continually saying his prayers and occasionally blowing a faint blast on a chank. And when a monk, no longer able to answer the shell's call to gather with his brethren round the teapots and the bowls of tsamba, passes quietly away, the same sound summons those who remain to attend his funeral mass. In the purer Buddhism of Ceylon the chank cult also finds place, and figures pro- minently among the musical instruments employed to lend eclat to the periodic procession (pcrahera) of the tooth relic at Kandy. (b) —BRANDING. All Sri Vaishnavite Brahmans, irrespective of profession, are expected to undergo a ceremony of initiation into Vaishnavism after the Upanayanam ceremony of invest- ment with the sacred thread, in the belief that it is the duty of all of their creed to carry throughout life a memorial of their god upon their person. To effect this, resort is had to branding with heated copper seals made in the conventional form of the various symbols of Vishnu. Members of this sect are not compelled to undergo this ordeal more than once\n\n38. 26 OKHAMANDAL MAKINK Z(><>I,o<;Y PART II dining their lifetime, but the Madhva sect which comprises chiefly Canarese-speaking Brahmans, have to submit to it as often as they visit their Guru. .Men of other castes who become followers of a Vaishnava ora Madhva Acharya (Guru) are expected to present themselves before the < ruru for the purpose of being branded. But the ceremonyis optional and not compulsory as in the case of a Brahman. Even the women in Vaishnavite Families must submit to this branding ; in their case it takes place after marriage in the case of Sri Vaishnavites, while among the Madhvas one form of branding should be performed at any age before marriage should the Guru visit the neighbourhood, and a more formal one again after marriage. Regarding Sri Vaishnavites, Thurston (I. 370) states that \" the disciples after a purificatory bath and worship of their gods, proceed to the residence of the Acharya, or to the mutt where they are initiated into their religion, and branded with the chakra on the right shoulder and with the ehank on the left. The initiation consists in imparting to the disciple, in a very low tone, the Mula Mantram. the word Xanionara-yanfiya, the sacred syllable Dm, and a few man- trams from the Brahma Rahasyam (Secrets about God). A person who has not been initiated thus is regarded as unfit to take part in the ceremonies which have to be per- formed by Brahmans. Even close relations, if orthodox, will refuse to take food prepared or touched by the uninitiated.\" As Vaishnavite Gurus are few in number, it is necessary for them to peregrinate the country, halting at suitable centres to brand those of their followers living in the neighbourhood just as a Bishop in certain Christian churches tours his diocese to afford confirmation (i.e., initiation) services at periodical intervals. Jn populous districts where Vaishnavites are in numerical strength the scene at each of the Guru's halting places is intense with interest. Thousands of his disciples gather round eager to be branded. Brahmans are there in force, but men of many other castes and even Parai- yans are there. The ceremonies begin by the making of a fire in a mud pot (homa kunda), accompanied by the chant of hymns and the offering of prayer to Vishnu. As Brahmans present themselves for the rite the Guru lifts the copper brands which have lie. mi heating meanwhile in the fire and applies them to the shoulders of the people, the chakra on the right and the chank on the left. As each stamp is made the Guru's assistant, usuallv a Dasari or Vaishnavite mendicant, smears the burnt spots with a paste of namakhitti, the same white clay vised by Vaishnavites when painting the namam or sect mark (improperly called caste mark) on their forehead. Paraiyans and low caste disciples may not be branded directly by the Guru ; in their case he heats the instruments and hands them to the Dasari, his assistant, who performs the actual operation. With regard to the branding customs of Madhva Vaishnavites, who believe that to carry a lasting outward and visible sign of their deity on their body helps them to obtain salvation through him, Thurston (I, pp. 371-373) supplies an interesting account: Madhvas have four mutts to which they repair for the branding ceremony, viz.. Vaya-\n\n39. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 27 saraya, Sumathendra, and Mulabagal in Mysore, and Uttaraja in South Canara. The followers of the Uttaraja mutt are branded in five places in the case of adult males, and boys after the thread investiture. The situations and emblems selected are the chakra on the right upper arm, right side of the chest, and above the navel ; the chank on the left shoulder and left side of the chest. Women and girls after marriage, are branded with the chakra on the right forearm, and the chank on the left. In the case of widows, the marks are impressed on the shoulders as in the case of males. The disciples of the three other mutts are generally branded with the chakra on the right upper arm, and chank on the left. As the branding is supposed to remove sins committed during the interval, they get it done every time they see their Guru. There is with Madhvas no restriction as to the age at which the ceremony should be performed. Even a new- born babe, after the pollution period of ten days, must receive the mark of the chakra, if the Guru should turn up. Boys before the upanayanam, and girls before marriage are branded with the chakra on the abdomen just above the navel. The copper or brass branding instruments (mudras) are not heated to a very high temperature, but sufficient to singe the skin, and leave a deep black mark in the case of adults, and a light mark in that of young people and babies. In some cases, disciples who are afraid of being hurt, bribe the person who heats the instruments ; but as a rule, the Guru regulates the temperature so as to suit the individual. If, for example, the disciple is a strong well-built man, the instruments are well heated, and, if he is a weakling, they are allowed to cool somewhat before their application. If the operator has to deal with babies, he presses the instrument against a wet rag before applying it to the infant's skin. Some Matathipathis (head priests of the mutt) are, it is said, inclined to be vindictive, and to make a very hot application of the instruments if the disciple has not paid the fee (guru- kanika) to his satisfaction. The fee is not fixed in the case of Sri Vaislmavas. whereas Madhvas are expected to pay from one to three months' income for being branded. Failure to pay is punished with excommunication on some pretext or other. The area of skin branded generally peels off within a week, leaving a pale mark of the mudra, which either disappears in a few months, or persists throughout life. Madhvas should stamp mudras with gopi paste1 daily on various parts of the body. The names of these mudras are chakra, chank or sankha, gatha (the weapon of war used by Bhima, one of the Pandavas), padma (lotus), and Narayana. The chakra is stamped thrice on the abdomen above the navel, twice on the right flank, twice on the right side of the chest above the nipple, twice on the right arm, once on the right temple, once on the left side of the chest, and once on the left arm. The chank is stamped twice on the right side of the chest, in two places on the left arm, and once on the left temple. The gatha is stamped in two places on the right arm, twice on the chest, and m one spot on the forehead. The padma is stamped twice on the left arm, and twice on the left side of the chest. Narayana is stamped on all places where other mudra marks have been made. 1 Properly gopi chandiram, a paste made of white kaolin mixed with sandalwood.\n\n40. 28 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY—PART II Sometimes it is difficult to put on all the marks after the daily morning hath. In such cases, a single mudra mark, containing all the five minims, is made to suffice. Some regard the chakra mudra as sufficient on occasions of emergency.\" So far as I can learn the branding instruments which are employed to sear the two chief Bymbols, chank and chakra. by means of heat are usually made of copper. In other localities brands of different metals appear to he used as Risley (II, p. 330) states that the Uamanuja. a Yaishnavite sect in Bengal, when undergoing the initiatory rite (tapta-mudra) are branded with the chakra on the right shoulder and the chank on the left, by means of a brand made of eight metals (ashta-dhatu) -gold, silver, copper, hrass. tin. lead, iron, and /inc. Various deviations from the standard ceremonial exist in certain districts: among these is that followed by the Bedar or Boya caste of the Southern Deccan, a caste which largely constituted the old fighting stock of this district. Among them the men are branded on the shoulders by the priest of a Hanuman shrine with the sign of the chank and of the chakra, in the belief that this will enable them to go to swarga (heaven). Fem<rfe Bedars who are branded become Basavis (temple women) and are dedicated to a male deity and called (Jandu Basavis or male Basavis (Thurston, I, p. li)4). This branding of temple girls, or Deva-dasi as they are termed in the Tamil country, with symbols of the chank and chakra is always an essential feature in the ceremonies which mark their dedication to the god of their temple, whom thenceforward they serve with dance and song. Allied to branding is tattooing. The Tandans of Malabar, a caste about the level of the Tiyyans, adopt this method to show devotion to the deity, and among the religious symbols worked into the skin of their arms is that of the chank (Thurston, VII, 10). (c) THE MENDICANT'S CONCH. Beggars throughout India occasionally use the chank shell as a musical instru- ment, and with certain castes of religious mendicants it is an essential part of their pro- fessional paraphernalia, so much so that a Tamil proverb likens things in continual association to \" the breech of the chank and the mouth of the mendicant.\" The Dasari. who belongs to a caste of Vaishnavite mendicants well represented in the Madras Presidency, is often seen in North Arcot and the Southern Deccan, announcing his arrival in a village by blasts on the chank-shell which in that part of the country is one of his five insignia. In Telugu districts the Dasaris are more secular and less reli- gious, and the caste is known as Sanku Dasari or vulgarly Sanku jadi, the ehank-hlowing caste. A mendicant's conch sometimes has the apical orifice mounted in brass; temple concha are usually without any ornamentation, but the Udipi temple owns one very handsomely mounted in brass and this is sounded whenever the god (Krishna) is carried in procession in the temple car.\n\n41. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 29 (<1) DEDICATION OF TEMPLES AND HOUSES. Wherever a new temple is built, or when a new shrine or god is established and added to the number already there, its dedicatory ceremonies include as one of the most important a special libation to the god from the mouths of 108 chanks, or better still, from 1,008 chanks if so many can be afforded, filled with water and flowers. The building of an ordinary house in the Tamil country must also have its ceremonial dedication at the time the foundation trenches are dug, though among low caste people the rite consists merely of a superstitious act to ensure good luck or to baulk the evil eye. It is carried out with the help of the sacred chank which thus is seen to touch the lives of the people at every point from the cradle to the grave. Before a single stone in the foundation is laid, the ceremony is carried out on a day carefully chosen as being highlv auspicious. A chank is then buried beneath the first stone laid. An old reference to this occurs in a petition quoted by Wheeler (fide Thurston, III, p. 147) from two natives of Madras, in connection with the founding of a village called Chintadrepettah, now a populous division of Madras City. The entry runs :— ' Expended towards digging a foundation where chanks were buried with accustomary ceremonies.\" Roman Catholic converts from low castes follow this custom, as well as Hindus ; in Tuticorin, if a Roman Catholic Parayan desires to build a house, the carpenter employed by him chooses an auspicious day by reference to a native calendar, a chank is bought in the bazaar and on the day chosen, having dug a foundation trench and prepared at the bottom a bed of coral stone and mortar, the chank is laid thereon. In the cavity of the shell small fragments of five metals (panjalokam), gold, silver, copper, iron and lead, are placed, turmeric and sandalwood water is sprinkled over, and then the whole is hidden under a mass of sweet-smelling flowers. The ceremony is ended ; the first stone may now be lowered into place upon the chank and its contents, and good luck is believed to be assured to him who will inhabit the house. It may, however, happen that in spite of every precaution, an inauspicious site appears to have been chosen as shown by a sequence of misfortunes happening to the householder. In such cases Hindus may perform a special ceremony called Chank- usthabanam to remedy the evil. A chank-shell is filled with water and incantations made for forty-five days. At the end of this period of propitiation, the chank is buried under the house wall. (Winslow, \" Tamil and English Dictionary,\" p. 390, Madras 1862.) Among the Parawa caste living in Tuticorin and other coast towns and villages in Tinnevelly and Ramnad, misfortune is often sought to be averted from the individual by almost completely burying a chank shell in the floor of the hall (kudam), about two feet on the inner side of the doorway to the street. A small portion of the back of the shell shows as a patch of white on the surface of the floor. The explanation of the custom current among Parawas is that the shell is so placed that when an inmate leaves\n\n42. 30 OKHAMANDAL MARINE ZOOLOGY—PART II the house, he must pass over it. usually touching it, and this will prevent misfortune happening to him. (c) MARRIAGE CEREMONIES. The dunk has important hut variable Functions to perform at weddings among all Hindu non-Brahman castes in the districts of the south of India, where this shell is blown by the barber (ambattan) particularly at or immediately after the tying of the tali or marriage badge around the bride's neck ; the bridal couple usually occupy a raised platform, and round and round this the barbel walks while blowing his chunk. In Bengal this custom of chank-blowing during weddings is even more general ; a common formula which runs \" Ganga ka pani samundra ki sank Bar kanva jag jag anand.\" i\" May Ganges water and sea-chank betide Enduring Miss to bridegroom and bride.' ) is usually recited during the marriage (Risley, II, p. 11G) with reference to the blasts on the conch which accompany the ceremonies—the equivalent of the marriage bells in Christian ritual. In Telugu districts .the chunk is not used by any caste, non-Brahman as well as Brahman, during weddings, as this is considered inauspicious because chank-blowing i- specially ussociated with funeral ceremonies. I Isually a man of a special caste is engaged to blow the chank at the customary times ; in the Tamil country the caste barbers (ambattans) perform this duty ; among the Telugus the chank blower is usually a Dasari, among the Iriyas, a Ravulo. Sometimes, however, women of the family or of the caste perform the chunk-blowing duty. Among Bengal Brahmans, for instance, one section of the elaborate and lengthy marriage ceremonies consists of a procession of seven married ladies headed by the bride's mother going round the bridegroom seven times, some sprinkling libations of water and vociferating the hymeneal cry of ulu-ulu. < >ne of the seven carries a conch and blows it as she goes (Risley, 1, p. 150). A custom somewhat akin to the above prevails among the Kalian caste of Tanjore, Madura, Trichinopoly and Tinnevelly. < hi the wedding day the sister of the bridegroom goes to the house of the bride, accompanied by women, some of whom carry flowers, coconuts, paddy, turmeric, milk, ghee, etc. On the way two of these women blow chunk shells. (Thurston, J 1 1, p. 80.) In passing it is interesting to note that a section of this caste, the Puranialai nadu Kalians, practise the rite of circumcision probably as a survival of a forgotten forcible ((inversion to Muhammadanism. The rite is carried out in a grove or plain outside the village and en mule to the place, and throughout the ceremony a chank is blown at fre- quent intervals. (Thurston, III, p. 74.) It is noteworthy that Brahmans in the Tamil and Telugu districts do not employ the\n\n43. HORNELL—THE INDIAN CONCH 31 chank dining marriage ceremonies though their brethren in Bengal do. Among Telugu Brahmans living in Uriya districts the custom of Bengal used to be followed at marriages, but this is gradually dying out ; as one Brahman in Berhampur (Ganjam) remarked \" The present day Brahmans here have more regard for the magic flute than for the divine voice issuing from the chank.\" hi Bengal the association of the chank with marriage is more intimate and deep than elsewhere ; no Bengali lady is properly or legally married unless chank bangles, which should be lacquered red, be placed upon her wrists. In the Madras Presidency, marriage bangles are used only by a few sections of the agricultural and pastoral castes (Vellalans and Idaiyans). One of the most interesting facts brought to light during the present research is the weighty evidence we have that in former days the tali, the essential marriage symbol among Tamils, was directly connected with the chank, either composed of a piece of the shell or of a metal ornament in the form of a miniature chank shell. We find this marriage badge named specifically sarikhu tali among four castes widely separated both geographically and in status and civilisation. First are the Chanku tali Vellalans, a section of the great Vellalar caste, who wear, according to Winslow (\" Tamil and English Dictionary,\" Madras, 1862), a representation of the chank on either side of a central symbol. Unfortunately, apart from this reference. I have been unable to trace the location of these Vellalans at the present day, or to obtain any details of the custom. Two other castes with the same marriage badge occur on the West Coast, and it is significant that one is undoubtedly of Tamil origin. This is an immigrant branch of the Idaiyans known locally as Puvandans, settled in Travancore. On ceremonial occasions the women wear the Tamil Idaiyan dress while in ordinary life they attire themselves after the fashion of Nayar women. Their tali is known eissank/tu tali and a small ornament in the form of a chank is its most conspicuous feature. (Thurston, II, 366.) The other West Coast caste using a sankhu tali is that of the Thandan Pulayans, a small division of the Pulayans who dwell in South Malabar and Cochin. The women dress in a leaf skirt made from the stems of a sedge called thanda, which are cut into equal lengths, woven at one end and tied round the waist so that they hang down below the knees. According to Ananthakrishna Aiyar (Thurston, VII, p. 23.) : \"At the marriage ceremony, the tali (marriage badge) is made of a piece of a conch shell (Turbi nella rapa) which is tied on the bride's neck at an auspicious hour. She is taken before her landlord, who gives her some paddy, and all the coconuts on the tree beneath which she happens to kneel To ascertain whether a marriage will be a happy one, a conch shell is spun round. If it falls to the north, it predicts good fortune ; if to the east or west, the omens are favourable ; if to the south, very unfavourable.\"' Lastly, and most interesting of all, we find a caste calling their marriage badge"
