While pursuing his M.S., in Chennai, he was involved in many free eye camps. This led him to develop an interest in community ophthalmology and Eye Banking.\n\nThen, through his association with Lions’ Club Vison services, he conducted innumerable eye camps and provided free eye care for thousands over a 20 year period. In addition, he participated in School Health Eye Care in Visakhapatnam district, for over a period of 22 years.\n\nUntil the turn of this century, corneal transplantation was not available in Visakhapatnam. One had to go to Hyderabad or Chennai for this service. Dr. Chetty worked relentlessly, appealed to his classmates, and friends and generated funds in order to avail the people in and around Visakhapatnam, easy access to corneal transplant.\n\nIn 2001, with financial support from Mohsin Brothers Foundation, he and several prominent ophthalmologists in the city, established the VEBART, (Visakhapatnam Eye Bank and Research Training Trust) a non profit organization). VEBART’s Mohsin Eye Bank is one of the top 25 successful eye banks in India. Today it is the leading Eye Bank in the two Telugu speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Dr. Chetty is the Founder / Trustee and Board Member of VEBART. He also served as the Chairman of the organization. With the help of Dr. Sasiprabha, then the Superintendent, he started the corneal retrieval program at KGH in 2001.\n\nDr. Chetty attended cornea retrieval calls 24 hours a day for the first 5 years after the Eye Bank was established. Through this program, he organized over 11,000 Total Corneal Retrievals, and helped with 6600 Corneal Transplants.He conducted numerous awareness programs regarding Eye care, Cornea donation and Eye Banking at various schools, colleges, nursing homes, and hospitals. Personally, he presented 300+ audiovisual demonstrations on Eye Donation and Eye Banking.\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Chetty took up the Mohsin School Health Eye Care Project for the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation. Within one year, about one and half lakh children, between the ages of 5-15 years, received eye screening and free eye glasses were given to 2884 children with refractory errors. He helped 24 children with intraocular lens implantation for congenital cataract, totally free of charge. He worked closely with the Regional Eye Hospital, Visakha Eye Hospital and L.V. Prasad Institute for the implantation procedures and other intra-ocular surgeries.\n\nDr. Chetty won numerous awards and accolades from community organizations as well as spiritual leaders.\n\nDr. Chetty is a simple man.

Thangaraj, the superintendent of the hospital and a renowned surgeon. Though he had no formal surgical training, he persevered, learnt complex surgical procedures from Dr. Thangaraj and himself became an expert in reconstructive surgeries, in the two year period that he spent at the TLM.\n\nSubsequently, he received a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from University of Liverpool in 1979. In 1983, he spent one month at the Microsurgery Research Unit at the St. Vincent Hospital in Melbourne, Australia and received training in microsurgery for a very brief period.\n\nAfter he left Salur, he spent ten years at each of the other 3 TLM centers namely Allahabad, Kolkata and Delhi, mostly performing reconstructive procedures. He became one of the fastest and most sought after leprosy reconstructive surgeons and trainers in the world. During his illustrious career, spanning almost 50 years, he dedicated his life to the much neglected segment of Indian society, the leprosy community. Through Leprosy Mission of India, he conducted critical reconstructive surgeries all over India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Nepal, Nigeria and West Africa. He has performed more than 25,000 tendon transfer surgeries to correct leprosy deformities, several reconstructive procedures on non-leprosy patients and many lagopthalmos surgeries to restore normal eyelid function. He also trained several leprosy surgeons in India and abroad. He retired in 2006 as the Deputy Director of The Leprosy Mission, but he never stopped correcting deformities.\n\nHe is a simple and humble man. He received many awards and numerous accolades. He was approached several times by friends and coworkers to consider sending his nomination for the prestigious Padma awards but he declined. To him, his rewards are his successful surgeries and the happiness of his patients.\n\nDr. Vijayakumar’s awards:\n\nHe received many awards and numerous accolades. Some of them are listed below.\n\nDr. C. Vyaghreswarudu Memorial Oration, IMA, Vizag- 1994\n\nBest Leprosy Worker, Delhi State Government- 2004\n\nDr. D.

Sudhakar, former Principal of AMC and Superintendent of KGH, a reconstructive and plastic surgeon and an academician has tremendous respect and adoration for Dr. Vijaya Kumar\n\nHe wrote “ Dr Vijay Kumar is bestowed with extraordinary surgical skills. The first time I saw him operating in Kakinada, I had a feeling that his hands are computerized. Taking up a subject like Leprosy reconstructive surgery which many shy away from and dedicating his entire life is phenomenal. Restoring the function in tens of thousands of leprosy patients with deformities is a true testimony of his commitment.\n\nTrue to the saying of ‘ Manava sevaye Madhava Seva’ , he continues operating in his seventies. I had the unique privilege of working with him in hundreds of surgeries. He conducted live workshops on leprosy reconstructions on every 15th of July for seven consecutive years, on Plastic Surgery Day at Andhra Medical College / KGH, when I was heading the Department of Plastic Surgery, until the Covid-19 pandemic started. Scores of my Residents and colleagues benefited rom his expertise. I always feel blessed to be his friend and associate.🙏”\n\nHe lives with his wife Sheba Vasanthi in Visakhapatnam. He has two sons and 4 grandchildren.\n\n* History of The Leprosy Mission (TLM)\n\nIn December 1869, Wellesley Bailey, a young Irishman who was working as a teacher in Punjab came across a row of huts inhabited by men and women with serious disabilities and deformities. He was told that they were suffering from Leprosy. He and his wife raised funds and started The Leprosy Mission. The program then extended to several countries. In India, there are several TLM hospitals , including the one in Salur, A.P. Then, in the 1940s, in South India, Paul Brand pioneered medical research and reconstructive surgery on leprosy deformities on the hands and feet.\n\nWith Princess Diana\n\nWith Mother Teresa\n\nDr. Pinakapani was born at Priya Agraharam in Srikakulam on August 3, 1913. He joined Andhra Medical College in Visakhapatnam in 1932 and earned his M.B.B.S degree in 1939. Graduating at the top of his class, Dr. Pinakapani was the only one from his batch to acquire an MD degree. He completed M.D. in general medicine in December 1945 from Andhra Medical College. He then worked as an Assistant Professor at Madras Medical College from 1945 to 1949 and then moved to Andhra Medical College. He held the position of Professor of Medicine at Andhra Medical College from 1954 to 1957. Later, he moved to Kurnool Medical College where he retired as professor of medicine in 1968. He passed away in 2013, a few months before his 100th birthday. He had three sons and one daughter. Chinmayi Sripada, the popular singer, is his granddaughter. While he excelled in the medical profession and held high positions, much of his glory and stellar public image came from Carnatic music. As a medical student, he used to practice music at 4 AM everyday in the hostel verandah and on the beach in Visakhapatnam. While advancing his medical profession, he continued to learn Carnatic music from famous gurus in Tamil Nadu. His voice was rich and he created a wholesome vocal style of his own. People who knew him called it the ‘Pani Bani’.\n\nHe had a successful career singing at major festivals and concerts and he continued to perform and teach music all through his medical career and afterwards.\n\nDr. Pinkapani was a musical visionary and a great guru. His disciples include carnatic vocalists, Nedunuri Krishnamurthy, Nookala Chinna Satyanarayana, Malladi Suribabu, Malladi brothers, Voleti Venkateswarlu, Seeerangam Gopalaratnam, and many others. More than teaching, he made great contributions to creative music. He was considered the “healer of malady’’ (as a doctor) and “producer of melody” (as a musician). He composed six varnams on his own and tuned 108 keertanas of Annamacharya in a wide range of ragas.\n\nDr. Pinakapani was a writer par excellence. He wrote several books on music. His books on Carnatic music include “ Sangeetha Sourabhamu”, Sangeetha Yatra, “Melaraga Malika, “Manodharma Sangeetam”, and “Pallavi Gana Sudha”.\n\nDr. Pinakapani was felicitated with many honors and awards. Apart from Sangita Kalanidhi, he received the title of Sangeeta Kalasikhamani from the Indian Fine Arts Society of Madras, the award of the Central Sangeet Natak Academy, and the much coveted Padma Bhushan from the Government of India in 1984. He was appointed as the asthana vidwan of the Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanams on August 3, 2012, on his 99th birthday. He was the recipient of the first \"Telugu Velugu\" award from the cultural council of Andhra Pradesh. He was bestowed with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Chicago based Saint Annamacharya Project of North America in 2004.\n\nA master of many trades, he was a wrestler and a tennis player too. Dr. Sripada Pinakapani lived at Kurnool until he left for the heavenly abode. Even though his health forced him to stay in bed for many years, he never stopped singing or discussing music. To this day, the Pani bani lives on, in the music of his devoted disciples. A documentary titled ‘Gana Rishi’ captured the essence of Dr. Pinakapani’s life filled with music. Ms. Mala Mohan, who made this film, focused on bringing out the unique personality of the Gana Sanjeeva. She presents the musician-physician’s innate curiosity vividly, and throws light on a career that smoothly combined his interests in two noble professions\n\nIn a tribute to a great guru, his disciple Smt. Jayalakshmi Sekhar writes, \"the great musician taught me so much of his high discipline – teaching, writing books, notating, and even learning. He never felt he was too great to learn from anyone who had some song that he did not know. The humility in him is something I can never forget. He would scold me if I offered him fees. He accepted only one rupee from me. He was fond of naming three professions we should not make money from – medicine, teaching Sanskrit and teaching music\".\n\nIn essence, Dr. Pinakapani was the modern Dhanvanthari, Narada and above all, a real yogi.\n\nWhat makes Dr. Jayaraju stand out among his peers, is his laser sharp focus on comprehensive rural community development and advancement of the backward classes. He spent his free time, vacation, sick leave and his own funds, as needed, to accomplish them. He joined the public sector and started his work at The Leprosy Mission hospital providing eye care for leprosy patients at Salur. Then, as a medical officer at KGH, he had the opportunity to observe the Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai. He was awestruck at the way, a gigantic community hospital could function with such efficiency. He learnt some strategies there and decided to apply them in his own backyard. He had the ophthalmic mobile units from KGH upgraded and conducted eye camps in 5 districts, from Srikakulam to West Godavari, nearly 200 days a year.\n\nAll through his career, he continued to obtain additional training, be it in advanced surgical procedures of the eye, Rural Development, or formulating strategies to awaken oppressed people through education and literature\n\nIn 1992, he, along with his wife, Smt. Padmavathi, established a Charitable Institution called the Organization for Comprehensive Rural Community Development (OCRCD) in Visakhapatnam. Through OCRCD, he worked relentlessly to promote rural literacy, and instill leadership qualities among the rural folk. Soon after, he started the Ashoka Eye Hospital in Gajuwaka, Visakhapatnam. With sponsorships from Municipal Corporations, and Voluntary Organizations like the Rotary and Lions Club, he used Ashoka Hospital as a conduit to organize eye camps in several rural and urban communities for the poor. Some of his camps include ITDA Paderu, Visakha Co-Op diary, Life Line Express Vizianagaram ( on the train), Greater Visakha Leprosy Center and Bhagavatula Charitable Trust, Dimili. Through these camps, school eye screenings were done, free reading glasses were given, and cataract surgeries and intraocular lense implantation surgeries were done on every Sunday for over two decades. He attributes his success to the other eye specialists who shared his vision in restoring vision to the needy.\n\nAs the Ashoka hospital building became unfit, in due course of time, for routine operations, Dr. Jayaraju moved to Ramabhadrapuram in 2006, to carry on with his health care mission. As the saying goes, \" Man proposes and GOD disposes\", he could not continue with his ambitious agenda due to personal health issues. He suffered myocardial infarction and had coronary by-pass, which forced him to retire from community based health care initiatives. Nonetheless, the zeal in him is very much alive and he continues to write and participate in educational activities to help his community.\n\nDr. Jayaraju wrote several books in Telugu, their aim being community development and advancement of oppressed rural people. He wrote a book \" కన్ను -విధులు-వ్యాధులు-వైద్యము, -in 1994 and revised it in 2000. He wrote a motivational book called \"విజయం కోసం పయనం\" in 2004. The other books he penned are, “ ఓటు\", \"అగ్ర రాజ్యంగా భారత దేశం\", and \"Madigaas of Andhra Pradesh and their struggle for Social Justice\".\n\nHe received several awards and his works, both in health care, and literature were cited in News papers and other media platforms. He was recognized and honored for his community service by the Ministry of Welfare, and Ministry of Health of Government of India.\n\nDr. Jayaraju has a son, and a daughter and three grand children. His wife, Smt. Padmavathi retired as a HR manager from Bharat Heavy Plates and Vessels. She also authored a book titled \" మద్యపానం మానడం ఎలా?\"\n\nCurrently, Dr. Jayaraju lives with his wife, in Visakhapatnam.\n\nDr. Shyam worked in the Central Health Services, New Delhi and took voluntary retirement in 2010 as the Senior Chief Medical Officer and Professor in the Division of Nephrology at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi. During his career, he focused on prevention of Non communicable diseases, mainly diabetes and chronic Kidney disease. He did pioneering work in the epidemiology of CKD and advocated routine screening for renal disease, and training of physicians and nephrologists in epidemiological aspects of CKD. He lobbied for Government supported Dialysis centers for End Stage Renal Disease and to include CKD in the non communicable disease prevention programs such as diabetes, hypertension, etc., In 2007, he led a team of experts from Delhi which investigated the disproportionate burden of CKD that occurred in a short period of time in a small town called Uddanam, in Srikakulam district of A.P. On his team’s recommendation, ICMR subsequently conducted a 6- center study, nationwide. Dr. Shyam is a member of several professional organizations including the National Academy of Medical Sciences, and American College of Epidemiology. He is a Life Member of Indian Society of Nephrology, Fellow of Indian College of Physicians and Fellow of Indian Academy of Medicine. He was on the panel of reviewers for Indian Journal of Medical Research, and an advisor to Union Public Service Commission for recruitment of medical officers. Dr. Shyam is a great story teller. He wrote several short stories which were published in reputable Telugu magazines. He does not write stories as a hobby. He only writes when there is a compelling story to tell or a strong message to convey. His stories are effectual gadgets. They are without a doubt, powerful bullets. They never miss their targets. A collection of his short stories was released in a book form titled, “ శ్యామ్ యానా” which received wide acclaim in Telugu literary world. “ మెడికో శ్యామ్ మహా గడసరి. కథకుడికి, సినీ రచయితకి మధ్య సింబయోసిస్ నివెండితెర వెనుక వినిపించగలడు. “ ICCU” కథలో గోడ గడియారం చేత ఐదు బెడ్ల మీదపేషంట్స్ అంతరంగాన్ని, అంతర్యాలని, ఐదు కథల ఏకత్వంగా గంటలు మోగించగలిగినవాడు శ్యామ్. వంగూరి ఫౌండేషన్ వారి కీర్తి కిరీటంలో, మరీ పొడవైన మణి తురాయిశ్యామ్ యానా” అంటూ ప్రశంసించారు ప్రముఖ తెలుగు రచయిత విహారి గారు ( జొన్నలగడ్డ సత్యనారాయణ మూర్తిగారు). “ అందరూ చూసేవి అందరికీ సాధ్యపడని విధంగా దర్శించి, అందరికీ అన్వయించేలావిశ్లేషించి కొందరికే అర్థమయ్యేలా రచిస్తే, అవి మెడికో శ్యామ్ కథలయ్యే అవకాశంఅనంతం” అన్నారు పాపులర్ తెలుగు రచయిత వసుంధర ( జొన్నలగడ్డ రాజగోపాలరావు, రామలక్ష్మి దంపతులు). “ పేరుకే అది కథా సంకలనం కాని అది రచయిత ఆలోచనల ట్రైన్ లో ఒక ప్రయాణం. శ్యామ్ యానా అంటే అతనొక్కడే వెళతాడా అంటే ఉహూ.. మనల్ని కూడా లాక్కుపోతాడు. వద్దు మొర్రో అని అనలేకపోవడం మన బలహీనత కాదు, రచయిత బలం. ఆ వేగానికి, ఆ మాట విరుపులకు, పాత్రల ధోరణికి, మనం అలవాటు పడాల్సిందే. తానుచూసిన వాటికి తన కలంతో ఫోటో తీసి, ఒక “షామియానా” కట్టి వాటినందులో పెట్టి, కథలనుకోమంటాడీయన. అవి మెత్తని ఊహలనీ, వెచ్చని స్పందనలనీ మీలో రేకిస్తాయి.” - an excerpt from the review of his book శ్యామ్ యానా in Andhra Jyothi. “ శ్యాం కథల్లో కథ నడుస్తున్నంత సేపూ, అడుగడుగునా కథకుడి reflection mood కదులుతూనే ఉంటుంది. అవి నాలుగు కాలాలు ఉండే కథలు; అందరూ చదవాల్సినకథలు. స్ఫూర్తినిచ్చే కథలు” అంటూ విశ్లేషించేరు, ప్రసిద్ధ తెలుగు రచయిత్రి చాగంటి తులసిగారు. Dr. Shyam wrote stories in English also. Many of his stories were translated into other languages. “ ముక్కు పుడక” is one such story translated into English by Mr. N.S. Murthy, a well respected Telugu literary critic. “ A doctor encounters an attendant during his routine rounds at the hospital. There is nothing special about her except for her nose stud. That nose stud triggers some memories and the doctor develops an aversion for the woman. Despite knowing that his prejudice against her was unfair, his behavior toward her makes things worse. What unfolds in the climax is not a twist but a logical consequence of the narrative. Dr. Shyam has an excellent narrative technique which is simple, lyrical and riveting” writes Mr. Murthy. Dr. Shyam was recognized a number of times for his literary works as well as his public health endeavors.\n\nHe is a repository of information and knowledge and very resourceful. Currently he lives in Texas, USA.\n\nShe received B.A. from Madras University and her medical degree from Madras Medical College, with a gold medal in midwifery. She obtained advanced training in Obstetrics and Gynecology at London and Dublin, and secured a membership in the Royal College of Surgeons, before returning to India. Dr. Lazarus worked for the Indian government under British rule from 1917-1947. From London, she was appointed as the chief medical officer of the Women’s Medical Services in India, and later as the assistant director-general of the women’s branch of Indian Medical Service. In 1940, she started her career as the Principal of the Lady Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, which was established in 1916. Lady Harding was the only medical institution in the country which offered comprehensive and full medical training, exclusively to women. The only other women’s medical college in the country was Missionary Medical School for Women in Vellore, which was founded by Dr. Ida Sophia Scudder in 1918, with grants received from the US. Dr. Scudder was the daughter of a second-generation medical missionary physician from the Dutch Reformed Church in the United States of America (US), who served in India. To her horror, she witnessed three women who declined medical care from her physician father and then succumbed to child birth at home, due to lack of women midwifery practitioners to care for them. In the beginning, MMSW offered only “licensure to practice medicine” training to women. It was , later transformed to a full fledged, co-educational medical institution in 1945, and was renamed Christian Medical College. Dr. Lazarus was a respected member of the interdenominational Vellore council, which together with North American and British sections of the Governing Board, helped in the transition from Missionary Medical School for women to the co-educational Christian Medical College in Vellore. She became the Principal of Christian Medical College in 1947, where she served for 7 years. “ She seems to have practiced and defended forms of overt evangelism that many medical missionaries had by then eschewed in favor of a more informal approach” wrote Arthur Jayakumar, in History of Christianity in India: Major Themes. Dr. Lazarus faced many administrative, political and financial challenges to obtain full affiliation for CMC with the University of Madras as a recognized professional medical college. She undertook a four-month tour of North America as a fundraiser for CMC. Under her leadership, several major developments took place at CMC. The first degree-granting nursing program was started at CMC, along with neurosurgery, leprosy sanatorium and a mental hospital. Dr. Lazarus was a great task master. She took mission hospitals and their home boards to task for being slow to appoint Indian doctors to leadership positions and grant them the same privileges available to the missionaries. She retired after 7 years of remarkable career at CMC, in 1954. At her retirement, the CMC council stated that through the things she had done for Vellore, as it’s Principal and Director, Dr. Lazarus had “helped raise this institution to the unique position it now occupies in India”. Even after retirement, she continued to help CMC. She gave away her retirement pension money to be put toward the year’s budget. Later in life, she donated one third of her estate to CMC. Yet, no buildings, wards or other facilities have been named in her honor. It’s Dr. Scudder’s name which is written all over the institution as the pioneer. However, Dr. Lazarus’ legacy as the first Indian director of the institution started by missionaries at Vellore, is found in indigenizing a professional institution for future India, while maintaining its strong Christian identity. Dr. Lazarus was one of the three women who served on the Bhore Committee, India’s Health Survey and Development committee, headed by Sir Joseph Bhore. The Bhore Committee report submitted in 1946, recommended a national health system for delivery of comprehensive, preventive and therapeutic allopathic services through a multilevel public system, financed by the government, to all citizens, irrespective of their ability to pay. It is not clear about the time period during which she served at AMC and KGH, but it appears that she had her strong presence in the midwifery program of the AMC between 1954 and 1970. It was mentioned in some online sources that she served as the Principal of AMC and the Superintendent of KGH as well, but no authentic records are available to confirm her professional association with the medical institutions in Visakhapatnam. There is a Lazarus ward at the Victoria Ghosha hospital, named in her honor which might explain her commitment to maternal and child care in Visakhapatnam. She was the president of the Managing Board of CBM High School in 1970s. She considered CBM High School as her own and left a large portion of her property for the development of the school. She was a member of the London Mission Memorial Church and donated money for the Gladys Memorial Hall in the same compound, in memory of her older sister who was a social worker. The Waltair Main Road in front of Waltair Club, St.Paul’s Church and Circuit House was named after her but the Vizag Municipal corporation added another name to it, a few years later. She learnt several languages including Sanskrit, though her mother tongue was Telugu. It is believed that she authored a book on her experiences as a doctor. In 1961, she received the Padma Shri award for her contributions to women’s health and maternal care in India. She also received several awards from the British Government, namely, the Member of the Venerable Order of St. John by King George VI in 1941, the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal from the British Government in 1942, and the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE ) in 1946.\n\nDr. Lazarus remained single and dedicated her life to medical care and midwifery services with her zeal and missionary appeal. She died in 1978 in Visakhapatnam.\n\nShe championed for their cause and worked relentlessly to muster enough support from her community for a program to enrich the lives of these elders. She founded the India Home, a non-profit organization, dedicated to addressing the needs of, and empowering the South Asian senior immigrant community in New York City. She registered India Home in the state of New York, in 2007.\n\nAfter her medical education, Dr. Vasundhara worked as a lab scientist in the department of molecular biology in Paris, and in New York for almost a decade before she did her residency in psychiatry and subsequently specialized in geriatric psychiatry. For two decades, she practiced psychiatry in New York, where she was recognized as an outstanding physician.\n\nHowever, her mind was pulled toward the issues plaguing the seniors in her community and she spent a lion’s share of her time in the development, expansion and management of India Home and its programs. As the founder and executive director of the program, she forged alliances with community stakeholders and skillfully carved a marvelous non-profit program which became one of its kind in New York.\n\nFor the first nine years, India Home, a secular project, collaborated with existing senior centers and temples and held programs on a weekly basis.\n\nGradually, more and more centers opened their doors to India Home for the benefit of the seniors in their communities. Initially, the services were provided by dedicated volunteers with donations from generous patrons.\n\nIn 2014, India Home was invited by NYC congressman, Rory Lancman to start a senior center for the Bangladeshi community in Jamaica., NY. As an integral part of the India Home, Dr. Vasundhara and her team started the Desi Senior Center in collaboration with the Jamaica Muslim Center in New York. Over the next few years, India Home received grants from the local city, state, as well as the federal governments, for the amount of $ 7.5 million dollars, to continue with its mission of caring for the aged population with its multi pronged approach. In 2020, India Home purchased a small condominium in Jamaica Estates, to carry out its administrative work and some of its programs on site. In 2022, India Home bought a single family home for several seniors to live together ( Coliving Home) and also purchased land to develop 50-60 units of enriched housing and assisted living facilities for the seniors.\n\nCurrently, India Home is well established with its own board of directors and paid staff to ensure smooth functioning of the organization. Its current annual budget is 3 million dollars. It has 18 full time and 9 part time employees. India Home raised more than $10 million since its inception, including the grants from the government.\n\nAt India Home’s centers, these seniors find resources through a diverse range of programs and activities such as group meals, creative aging programs, assistance with citizenship, benefits access, service referrals, and educational sessions on health, nutrition, financial safeguards and legal matters, on a daily basis at different centers. They also celebrate major festivals as observed by its congregation, such as Diwali.\n\nThrough grants from CDC and the federal government, COVID prevention education, vaccination, and Colon screening are also being made available to the beneficiaries of India Home.\n\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Vasundhara and her team, India Home collaborated with Brown University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Harvard University for clinical research and academic studies in the area of mental health in the South Asian aging population.\n\nIndia Home has been considered as a top rated non-profit program and Dr. Vasundhara attributes its success to the enthusiastic professionals and volunteers who joined her and persevered on their journey to build the program to its current state.\n\nDr. Vasundhara received numerous awards, and honors from various prestigious organizations. The most notable are,\n\nPBS Next Avenue Influencers on aging\n\nRising Star award from the Council of senior centers and services, New York\n\nFred Meyers Community Partner Award\n\nAward by National Indo-American Association for senior citizens\n\nAward of Excellence by TANA at the 22nd conference in Washington DC\n\nCurrently, Dr. Vasundhara works part time as a psychiatrist but India Home is her second home, where she is a full time homemaker. She has a daughter, a son and two grandchildren. She lives in Glen Oaks, NY with her husband, Dr. Srinivasa Rao, Ph.D., a New York based biomedical scientist.\n\nAfter obtaining her M.D. degree in Obstetrics and Gynecology, she set up her private practice in Visakhapatnam. Dr. Prabha is a woman of pride and sharp intellect. She is academically inclined and kept abreast of new developments, and practiced the state of the art medicine available to her. However, she has been part of the activities organized by Satya Sai SEWA samiti all her life. Ten years into her practice, she started feeling that her life should have a special meaning and a purpose. She remained single in order not to have to leave her comfort zone to accommodate someone else’s whims and fancies but her being single, made it easy for her to pursue her life’s mission.\n\nShe had a highly successful medical practice but she made time for free clinics organized by Satya Sai SEWA samiti in Visakhapatnam, as well as the tribal area camps in Visakhapatnam district and Satya Sai taluka, Puttaparthi, conducted by Easwaramba Trust. Unfortunately, over the years she was afflicted by chronic medical conditions which made it difficult for her to travel for voluntary clinical services. She suffered from depression when her spiritual father, Bhagavan Satya Sai left his mortal coil in 2011. But, before long, her unflinching devotion and faith helped her to get back into the service arena.\n\nIn 2018, she decided to leave her practice in order to fulfill her mission. She sold all the properties that she ever owned and donated the proceeds, in entirety, to Prashanti Bala Mandira Trust and moved to Satya Sai Grama Ashram in Muddanahalli in the district of Chikkaballapur in Karnataka. Currently, she lives in the ashram as an in-house caregiver and provides free medical care to the women at the Sri Satya Sai Sarla Memorial Hospital.\n\nSri Satya Sai Sarla Memorial Hospital in Muddanhalli stands tall as a beacon of hope by offering free of cost speciality care to millions of rural and underprivileged sections of the society. The hospital was named after Mrs. Sarla Indulal Shah, a devotee of Sri Satya Sai Baba, who dedicated her life to the service and upliftment of women and children. The hospital project was conceptualized and brought to fruition by Sadguru Sri Madhusudan Sai, a disciple of Bhagavan Satya Sai Baba. The outpatient department opened in 2018 and the multi-specialty hospital was inaugurated in August of 2021. Dr. Prabha works at the hospital from morning till evening, 6 days a week, and spends the rest of her time in spiritual activities.\n\nWhen asked about her future goals, she laughs and says, “this is my goal. I hope to be liberated here.. when the time comes”.\n\nLater, he did a Clinical Research Fellowship at Heinrich Hertz Stiftung, Technical University, Aachen, Germany, 1991-1992.

Along with like-minded philanthropists, he was instrumental in establishing the Mahatma Sri Ramachandra Centenary Memorial Hospital in Hyderabad, in 1999. The objective of the hospital is to provide modern medical services, at a very affordable cost, to the common man. He and his wife Smt.

He lives in Hyderabad, with his wife, Srivalli.\n\nIn 1977, when Dr. Raju had a routine visit to a rural area in India, he came across a poor farmer who requested him to check his eyes. Dr. Raju did not have any equipment with him to do the eye exam. It was then he realized that there are many in India, particularly in rural areas, who could not afford even a routine eye exam. That encounter served as the impetus for Dr. Raju to organize the first free eye camp in a remote village in India. To his surprise, most of the attendees of the camp were young children brought by their mothers, begging Dr. Raju to fix the eye problems of their little ones. Majority of the children were afflicted with conditions that could lead to blindness, unless corrected in a timely manner. It dawned on Dr. Raju that there are millions of babies and young children in India and across the world, who suffer from preventive blindness and timely intervention can, indeed, have a huge impact on their future. His motto became “ If blindness is preventable, let’s do it BIG”.\n\nDr. Raju founded the “Eye Foundation of America” in 1977 and went on his mission to prevent “avoidable blindness”. Very soon, he performed his first bilateral corneal transplants on a 2 year old Srinu and restored his vision completely. As a result, Srinu was able to successfully complete his doctorate degree in pharmacy from Rutgers’ University. Subsequently, many such children with congenital cataracts, strabismus and other conditions were operated on, by Dr. Raju and had their vision completely restored. Due to his efforts and perseverance, EFA was able to muster support from Rotary International and many such community based organizations, as well as from philanthropists with their magnanimous donations. Dr. Raju himself contributed millions of dollars to EFA. Through EFA, he and his team were able to examine more than 3 million children, train 200 ophthalmologists, perform 300,000 vision restoration surgeries in 21 countries, including India, Nepal, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Africa, in the last four decades. Dr. Raju is still actively involved in the eye camps and vision restoration surgeries. Under his direction and guidance, the Gautami eye institute, a Rs/- 20 crore project is taking shape for outreach activities, in Rajahmundry with 11 peripheral centers.\n\nDr. Raju is an academician, as well. He has about 80 publications to his credit and 8 chapters in textbooks of ophthalmology. He served as a peer review committee member for the journal, Ophthalmologic Surgery and a consulting editor for Indian Journal of Ophthalmology. He is actively involved in training and teaching of residents and students at the West Virginia university. He also participated, over the years, in various clinical research projects. He gave more than 200 invited talks both in the US and India. On May 11, 2023, he was invited to be the keynote speaker at the Young Ophthalmologist Society of India, which Dr. Raju considers as the highest honor he was ever bestowed with. He also authored a book titled, Musings on Medicine-Myth and History- India’s legacy.\n\nHe was a member of numerous professional societies both at local and international level. He served as the Executive Committee Member of Monongalia General Hospital, Morgantown, West Virginia; Member of the Prevention of Blindness Committee, American Associations of Physicians of Indian Origin; Member of the Board, Ocular Surface Research and Education Foundation; Member of the Board of International Ocular Surface Society; President, West Virginia Academy of Ophthalmology; President of American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery; Councilor, American Academy of Ophthalmology, Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists, American Medical Association, American College of Surgeons, International Society of Refractive Surgery, Paton Society, All India Ophthalmology Society, and Cogan Ophthalmic History Society; and Director of International Ocular Surface Society.\n\nDr. Raju received about 60 awards and honors in the US and India.

He has a daughter and a son and two grandchildren. He lives with his wife, Rani in Morgantown, West Virginia.\n\nD. Raju with his wife Rani\n\nFor Dr.Prakash, it began at a young age with the death of several family members who were very dear to him. Questions arose in his mind such as “What is the meaning of life?”. If death is the fact of life, what should be its purpose, he wondered. His own answer took him on a path of volunteerism and social work at Bharat Vikas Parishad. His marriage with Dr. Kameswari in 1995, led to a shared purpose as she was also looking for a meaningful life. In their relationship, they are one. She is the strength, and he is the courage. With a fulfilled life, and earned good, they are the richest doctors who own no house, land, property, or a bank balance. They live in a rental house. Dr. Kameswari provides out-patient services and charges a nominal fee from patients who can afford it. He works on their social welfare projects, supported by their own financial resources and all his effort.\n\nDr. Prakash with a master’s degree in health administration from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, worked at the Catholic Health Association of India until 1999 before taking a plunge into social work, full time. With creative thinking, the couple designed separate avenues to help people with different needs, be it food, education, or health. It appears, they were made to enrich the lives of others, especially the marginalized.\n\nDr. Kameswari was born in Palakollu, and had her education in Visakhapatnam, Godavari, and Krishna districts. After she completed M.B.B.S.,as one of the top students in her class, she did her Diploma in Gynecology and Obstetrics from Osmania University. At the Government Maternity Hospital at Nayapul, she was involved in dealing with thousands of challenging patients in obstetrics and gynecology. This triggered her passion and dedication to the preventive aspect of women's health.\n\nOn her visit to the Child in Need Institute in Calcutta, run by Dr. Sameer Chowdhury in 1999, she realized that she could do meaningful women's health work in the community. In the same year, she and her husband Dr. Prakash, were invited by Dr. Verghese of Jeevodaya Social Center, to provide maternity and preventive women's health care at Sadasiva Peta in Medak district. While working there, she noticed that many women had hysterectomies at a very young age, some even in their 20s, without any indication. That was the seed for Dr. Kameswari’s “Save the uterus” campaign. She continued her service there for five years and worked for medical insurance companies as a freelancer to support her family, financially.\n\nIn order to channel their ideas into action, the couple started and registered a non-profit organization under the name- Life-Health Reinforcement Group (Life-HRG) in 1999. The goal of the organization is to promote the value of Sharing food, Sharing knowledge and Sharing responsibility through innovative strategies and reinforcements. Life-HRG has 4 projects and their goals are to be met through four separate portals, one for each of the goals and they funded them from their own resources.\n\nThe first \"Share the Food\" project began with the help of a banana vendor cart and the slogan, “Each one, eat one, and share one”. Dr. Prakash, bless him, used to push the banana cart on the streets of Hyderabad, urging people to share a banana; thousands did. He was compassionate without pride in working for a noble cause. The project was a success and it soon led to the establishment of Andari Illu.\n\nThe Life-Health Reinforcement Group has four initiatives:\n\nAndari Illu / Open House\n\nAndari Pustakam/Spreading Light - Books\n\nAndari Swasa\n\nAndaroo Bagundali Manavontuna.\n\nAndari Illu, established in June 2006, is an open house and a social emergency unit for anyone who is hungry and in need of food or a place to rest. Since then, it has served hundreds and thousands of students, unemployed people, victims of domestic violence and those suffering from emotional and psychological issues. It proved to be a haven for anyone unfortunate enough to need it. At Andari Illu, the food ingredients, utensils, and stoves are available free for self cooking; the utensils are to be kept clean for the next person who comes to utilize them. It also has a library for quick reference or leisurely reading and a place for people to rest. It currently operates in Kothapet, Hyderabad, and is open from 5:00 AM till 1:00 AM past midnight. Anyone, regardless of their background, can stop by, and cook their meal. They can rest, read a book, or take a shower but are not provided for overnight stay. The building houses a clinic for medical consultation also. Inspired by the services provided by Andari Illu, similar projects were started in Visakhapatnam, and Tirupathi. Andari Illu was covered in the national news in South Africa, Germany, and Spain, and the concept was utilized to start a similar project in Kenya.\n\nAndari Pustakam is an initiative to promote Book reading and sharing. The project was started in 2011 as mini libraries with several books and a space for people to sit and read. These libraries are supported by the Central Library in Chintal, Qutbullapur Municipality, Hyderabad and also serve as training and rehabilitation units for Women. There are about 74 Little libraries in Hyderabad and 4 medium sized ones in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and an additional 26 in other southern states. Inspired by these libraries, many libraries were established in Chittoor district and rural areas around Bangalore.\n\nAndari Swaasa is a program designed to help the community to stay healthy. This initiative is geared toward nutrition, weight loss, mental and physical health etc.; but a more direct help is provided through the women’s health initiative, both in Dr. Kameswari’s clinic, as well as in her rural camps. Her clinic is in the same building as Andari Illu.\n\nAndaroo Bagundali Manavonthuna was started in 2016. Its motto is “Love and Honesty” and its principal aim is to promote issues such as environment, education, spirituality, and history, and to address domestic violence, alcohol, etc.\n\nThere were instances when Dr. Kameswari and Dr. Prakash provided medical care to those involved in serious conflicts and riots. Their work was risky, their situation was precarious and twice they narrowly escaped personal injuries from direct attacks and gunshots.\n\n“Save the uterus”- (గర్భసంచిని కాపాడుకుందాం):\n\nEarly during her community work, Dr. Kameswari noticed that about one fifth of the women population in the rural Andhra, and Telangana areas are undergoing hysterectomies and in some cases, both the ovaries were removed; majority of them were younger women and many were unnecessary. As a result, these women had early menopause which adversely affected their bone, cardiac and emotional health. Dr. Kameswari noticed that lack of understanding and underestimating the effects of unnecessary surgical procedures led these women to undergo such drastic measures, just to get rid of their menses related pain, heavy bleeding and obstacles to intimacy in their married life. She worked in about 100+ rural areas to counsel and educate women repeatedly about the risks associated with unnecessary hysterectomies and removal of the ovaries.\n\nDr. Kameswari brought this medical malpractice issue to the Human Rights Commissions in 2003. With the help from the Department of Biotechnology, and National Institute of Nutrition, she did systematic research, collected data from 2008-2011, and documented the ill effects of unnecessary hysterectomies, including bone loss as determined by DEXA scans. She also participated in the Knowledge in Civic Society Project, to study the socioeconomic impact of premature menopause, from 2008-2012. With the help of Mrs. Chaya Ratan, a then IAS officer, Dr. Kameswari was able to determine that about 26,000 unnecessary hysterectomies were paid for, by the Aryogyasri scheme. In 2013, she submitted the hysterectomy related documents to Narendra Gupta of the National Family Health Survey and had hysterectomy included in the routine national survey questionnaire. Dr. Kameswari’s meticulous work and documentation was so compelling that the Supreme Court issued a judgment against hysterectomies in women under 40 years of age, in 2020.\n\nEducational Campaigns:\n\nWith the help of Mahila Samajam, Dr. Kameswari was able to stage an interactive playlet, titled “గర్భ సంచి ముచ్చట్లు “ to communicate with young women and make them understand the importance of reproductive organs.\n\nIn 2016, she and Dr. Prakash held a 70-day educational campaign on unnecessary hysterectomies.\n\nIn 2018, Dr. Kameswari took part in 122 programs in many colleges in Yadadri and Bhuvaneswari Districts in Telangana, and discussed the importance of the uterus and why it should not be removed unless indicated.\n\nDr. Kameswari is known for her remarkable work with infertility. She helps women achieve pregnancy through natural means, after identifying the underlying factors such as PCOS, low sperm counts, and endocrine related issues. She focuses on nutrition, fertility awareness education, weight loss, and other natural methods. Dr. Kameswari says, with a smile, that she was able to help about 20,000 women get pregnant without resorting to ovulation induction methods.\n\nDr. Kameswari authored a Telugu book titled “Madhu Malathi”- which contains detailed discussions on infertility related issues, written in Telugu. She followed it up with another book, “Save the Uterus”, also in Telugu.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Dr. Prakash and Dr. Kameswari were recognized by many organizations and the media through interviews and with prestigious awards.\n\nA list of the most notable awards for Dr. Suryaprakash include,\n\nPotti Sreeramulu Telugu University: Great Service to Humanity Award: 2016\n\nManava Seva Dharma Samvardhani National Award: 2007\n\nSpecial Postal Cover was released on 4th October 2021 on Aldari Illu/ Open House\n\nJournalist Diary Award: 2023\n\nDoctor of Divinity: Henry Martyn Institute: 2022\n\nA list of the most notable awards among many for Dr. Kameswari includes,\n\nSadguru Gnanananda Award for Families in Social Work: 2007\n\nAndhra Pradesh Government Award to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the International Women’s Day.\n\nVasundhara Award given by ETV: 2019\n\nFelicitation by Governor of Telangana: 2020\n\nDoctor of Divinity: Henry Martyn Institute: 2022\n\nDr. Surya Prakash and Dr. Kameswari have a daughter and a son, and both of them are following the path laid by their parents.\n\nThe Endocrine and Diabetes Centre, located in Krishna Nagar, Visakhapatnam, has been at the forefront in providing state of the art medical care, in carrying out research and reaching out to the public about endocrine diseases and diabetes mellitus. EDC is among, if not the first, organizations in India to seamlessly transfer to an in-house electronic medical record system from 1992. Currently it has a live database of more than 90,000 subjects with endocrine diseases. The remarkable aspect of the electronic medical record system at the EDC is that its origin, evolution, and future prediction of the growth has been widely published in peer-reviewed journals and in textbooks.\n\nNot only have a number of research publications resulted, but broad and deep collaboration with other areas of science as well as humanities was made possible. Integrated research was performed, and the results widely published in the fields of diabetes, thyroid disorders, psychology, bioinformatics, neural networks, and pharmacology.\n\nDr. Sridhar was born in Visakhapatnam and had his schooling there.
