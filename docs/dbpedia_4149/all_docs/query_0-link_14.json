        "text": "A DIVINE COUPLE\n\nSRI BALA CHARANAM.\n\nMarch 18, 2009\n\nA Divine Couple:\n\nSri Ezhilmani and Smt. Nagalakshmi\n\nSri Bala Peetam, Nemili.\n\nSri Bala interrupted my meditation this morning and said “ I want you to publish on the blog site that pencil sketch you did recently of my son, Ezhilmani and his wife and write a short article about how this drawing came to be executed”.\n\nSo, I sat in front of my computer and prepared to type. Hardly had I typed in the first word when I was interrupted by the doorbell. For the next half hour I was kept busy doing a few chores.\n\nThe relaxed mood was gone and when I sat down in front of my laptop once again, I didn’t feel like writing anything. Closing my eyes I tried to shut off all thoughts, including that of Bala.\n\nI told her I wasn’t in the mood to talk to her just then. However, a plaintive voice kept interrupting the silence. “ Please don’t fight with me. I want you to write up this piece today and publish that drawing on the website. Please do this task for my sake. Mentally, I could see a little child dragging me reluctantly by my hands.\n\nWiping away my tears, I remarked rather grudgingly “ Ok Bala, I’ll do this for you today. However, You must tell me what to write. I am simply not in a suitable frame of mind to type an article for my website”.\n\nSwiftly came the response “ I’m glad you listened to me. Don’t worry, you will only put down what I want you to write”.\n\nSo here I am, giving you this little prelude to the topic of today’s blog.\n\nWhy did I draw a pencil sketch of Sri Ezhilmani and his wife?\n\nWell, a week ago, I received a CD from Sri Bala Peetam at Nemili containing some photos taken at Sri Ezhilmani’s 71st birthday celebrations. I also received two of the CD’s that had been released on that day. The first one “ Elimaye Ezhil” contained songs in praise of Ezhilmani, highlighting the fact he is an embodiment of simplicity. In fact, there is a song in this CD sung by a young child praising the Peetathipadhi. When I listened to it I felt here was Sri Bala herself , happily singing in praise of her son!\n\nThe second CD called “ Ezhilmani’s Isai Yathirai” contains a collection of songs in praise of Pillayar, Murugan, Shiva, Vishnu, Ayyappan, Amman, etc. The listener is taken on a virtual pilgrimage to all the famous temples dedicated to the above mentioned deities culminating in a visit to Sri Bala Peetam.\n\nI listened to these two CD’S over and over again savouring the lyrics and music , mentally thanking the many singers who had put in so much effort in rendering these lilting melodies.\n\nThe photo album containing some 300 photos taken during the two days of Sri Ezhilmani’s birthday transported me to the venue where this function was hosted and made me feel fulfilled as if I had virtually attended the event and received the divine couple’s blessings.\n\nIt was at this moment Sri Bala asked me to do a painting of her son and his wife. However, there were so many photographs and I didn’t know which one to choose . Here too, Bala was in command. She seemed to sit in my thoughts so firmly that day. Without hesitation, I picked out just one photo of the couple. That was it! My drawing would be based on this solitary photograph of the smiling couple.\n\nThe moment I made this choice, a parcel was slipped through my letter box. This contained the little pamphlet called “ Bala Vijayam”, a monthly newsletter from the Peetam. Opening it I flipped through the pages and at the end, there were some photos of the birthday function. It was hardly a surprise to find that the photo I picked ( or rather, chosen by Bala) was the one posted right at the end , with the caption , “ end of the function”.\n\nI decided to go to the nearby internet café to print out this photo on a larger sheet of paper, so I could see the details more clearly. It was a bright and sunny afternoon, albeit cold. My husband and I decided to walk up to the shop as it would be a good 30 minute exercise. We had hardly proceeded for five minutes before the skies turned ominously dark. Thunder clouds scudded across the sky. I quickened my pace hoping to reach the shop before the heavens opened up. I was not lucky. There was a huge bolt of lightening, followed by an ear splitting crackle of thunder and rain started pelting down in the form of hail stones.\n\nI opened the tiny, emergency umbrella tucked inside my handbag but this provided no protection whatsoever as the winds were too strong.\n\nWe were already half way up to the shop. Taking shelter in the foyer of a nearby restaurant, I suggested to my husband we should turn back. However, he insisted that we should be able to make it to the internet shop.\n\nMeanwhile, even as I stood at the entrance of that restaurant, soaking wet and my shoes squelching with water, I heard Bala distinctly . She said “ Don’t think that its all that easy to do this drawing. This rain is a sign of blessing to you because you are chosen to draw it. It also indicates the power exuded by this divine family. The rain will stop exactly the moment you print out this photo”.\n\nWe waited ten minutes hoping for the rain to abate. It did not seem to be lessening in strength. Finally, my husband and I just ran the remaining distance, entering the internet café , with water dripping from our faces and coats.\n\nWithin a few minutes, I finished the task of enlarging the photo of Sri Ezhilmani and printed it out on an A4 sheet of paper. Contrary to my expectations, the color quality wasn’t very good at all. However, that was the best resolution I could get that day!\n\nMy mind was whirling with many conflicting thoughts. Perhaps, I shouldn’t really do this drawing. I have never done portraits before. I wasn’t too sure if I could copy and portray these lovely people to Bala’s satisfaction.\n\nJust as the sheet of paper was ejected from the printer, I looked out of the shop window. The rain had stopped completely!!\n\nThere was not a trace of it; no drizzle, nothing. The sun was coming out! I paid for my photo and walked out of the shop into sunshine. My husband who had remained quiet thus far, remarked “ Wow, that’s really amazing. I’ve never, ever experienced such an unnatural phenomenon before.”\n\nWe could see too, that many people on the street had been caught out totally unprepared for this sharp, sudden downpour.\n\nAfter I reached home that day and got out of my wet clothes, I immediately set about the task of drawing this picture.\n\nAlthough I was extremely skeptical of my ability to do a portrait, I placed all my trust in Bala and she has guided me step by step to complete this drawing. The result as you can witness is as She intended. Sri Ezhilmani is an extremely simple and humble person despite his high status as the head of Sri Bala Peetam. As if to reinforce this particular virtue, Bala asked me to present this drawing as a very plain pencil sketch even though I initially wished to depict this portrait in color. Similarly, Smt Nagalakshmi or “Baby Amma” as everyone calls her is an extremely cheerful lady, a personification of calmness and grace. The warmth and affection with which she greets all visitors to the Peetam and the hospitality she extends are greatly appreciated by one and all!\n\nI sincerely hope that a glance of the shining and serene faces of this lovely couple brings happiness and joy in all your lives.\n\nNinth Image Of Sri BALA\n\nSRI BALA CHARANAM.\n\nIMAGE NINE\n\nVERSE NO: 69 ( SRI BALA ANDHADHI)\n\nTO EXCEL IN EDUCATION\n\nOH beautiful lady, even the sun that revolves in this universe\n\nSeeks to reach only your sacred feet\n\nMy very Life I am prepared to sell\n\nTo have the talent of weaving your image into my poems\n\nAnd entice you into my heart\n\nEven the fiercest of ascetics who have renounced everything\n\nJostle each other to be the first to reach you\n\nJust to catch a glance of your enchanting smile!\n\nSri Bala’s message:\n\n“ I shine brighter than the Sun! I have created this entire Universe , planets and the constellation of stars. Yet, no single star can shine more brightly than me. I radiate warmth and love and my tenderness to devotees is as cool and gentle as the deep blue sea. I sit here in my abode watching my devotees as they carry on their lives. Sometimes, I laugh when I see the antics they perform or when they forget Me! Nemili is my resting place, my Home from where I activate this universe and those people who belong in my “little” world. All the skills are at my pleasure and command. I endow different people with the ability to write, paint, sing and dance so I can be happy. I take great enjoyment in listening to music as well as seeing myself portrayed in various colorful images. However, don’t forget, these skills are given to you by me for My pleasure”.\n\nMy thoughts on the painting:\n\nThis drawing was my second attempt to depict Sri Bala on a swing. I did it because I wasn’t too happy with the earlier picture. Unmistakably, precise directions (mental suggestions) were given by Bala regarding this drawing. For example, the wavy, star-like pattern of her billowing skirt as well as using the color blue in the center of this image. The use of Gold color in the background was also suggested by Sri Bala. It was only after I read the Andhadhi verse she had selected for this drawing, did I realize the significance of this painting and the colors.\n\nIt is quite clear that Sri Bala was meant to be portrayed as residing inside a vast, golden star! The “blue” color is to depict her “cooling” grace on the devotees.\n\nAn enchanting smile was the final touch! Words cannot describe my feelings as I read the Andhadhi verse, pre selected for this image.\n\nThere’s another small incident that happened on the day I drew this picture. Now, it so happened that it was Pournami or Full Moon on the day I was completing this picture. Since I was in London at that time, I had made arrangements through a friend in Chennai to send some sweets and savouries to Sri Bala Peetam at Nemili. My friend called me after collecting the edibles and asked me if there was anything else she should take with her. I thanked her for helping me but said nothing else was required and disconnected the phone. The moment I put the phone down, I heard Bala’s voice “ Send a blue saree and a blue silk dhothi for my son and his wife”.\n\nNot hesitating for a minute, I called my friend once more. When she came on the line, something made me tell her “ Go to the saree shop and buy the first saree that the sales person throws down. You’ll see this is a blue saree. Just buy it and get a dark blue silk dhothi for Sri Ezhilmani Mama as well”.\n\nMy friend called me from “Nalli’s” within half hour. She said in a voice choked with amazement\n\n“ How on earth would you know that the first saree would be a blue one. I am standing here in this crowded shop and this guy has just thrown down a beautiful blue saree”!\n\nLater, after my friend had delivered this precious cargo at Bala’s house in Nemili, she called me from the Peetam and I was able to talk to Sri Ezhilmani. I told him “Mama, I hope you can use this dark blue Veshti. I sent that for you and the blue saree for Baby Amma, because Bala kept insisting on it”.\n\nSri Ezhilmani handed over the phone to his wife, who said “ It is no mere coincidence. On Thursday, this week we are celebrating Mama’s 71st birthday, as you know. But Bala has just told all of us to wear blue. I was just asking my daughter in law to check if I had any saree in that color. Your gift came just in time. I will wear it on that day “.\n\nThis is just one more example of Bala’s divine, mischievous Lila!\n\nSri Bala Charanam\n\nGazing at Sri Bala with her enchanting smile in this picture, where she shines more lustrous than a star, all your latent abilities will be activated, so you can excel in whatever field of education or profession you have chosen!\n\nFebruary 25, 2009."
