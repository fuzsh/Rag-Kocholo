        "text": "#newdaynewchapter Chapter 1224: July 7,2024 During the wandering young days of Swami Vivekananda, he once went to Varanasi. There, he visited the Kashi Vishvanath temple. When he was returning from the temple, on the way, a troop of monkeys was sitting there. On seeing Swami ji, the monkeys attacked him. Frightened, the Swami started running away from the monkeys. However, as he was running away from them, the monkeys became more and more violent. He became helpless. Just then came a voice from behind. ‘Stop Running, face the brutes’. Swami ji, moved by these words, stopped and stood boldly. Suddenly, the monkeys stopped chasing him and finally retreated. So he learnt a lesson face the brutes boldly or they will chase you\" It is ghor kali yuga, and most Hindus themselves are not performing their own Dharma rituals, because their intellect has reduced, and they have collectively become adharmi. They also lack the will/courage to act as per Dharma because 'Artha'(money) has become more important. Ask yourself, where have the great builders and architects of the ancient fantastic [temple] monuments all around us, gone? With the exception of the latest Ayodhya Ram Mandir, what extraordinary combination of art and science did they pursue to build such historical monuments that will last the ages of time? Because we don't believe that we are United Hindus. We divide ourselves geographically like South Indians, North Indians etc or linguistically apart from caste & creed hence we are at most disadvantage despite being a majority. There are Shaiva, Vaishnavs, Jains, Vaniya, Dravids, Kshatriya and what not. And our politicians keep playing each other's caste in order to get voters bank! Because the most educated person with highest degree stays away from voting sensibly. Because we have multiple government Reservation system in getting education and jobs for disadvantaged population and when higher caste Hindu asks about the quota he is taught lessons on Secularism! Today the Hindu community is in the same condition. The brutes like the separatists, the secular liberals, the jihadists are chasing us and we are running away from them. We never retaliate and that's our real problem. We have forgotten our inner strength.We have neglected the great wisdom of our Shastras and culture. Therefore, Arise! awake! Hindus and do not stop till you realise your dreams of creating Akhand Hindu Rashtra Bharat. Read your Shastras, realise your strength and face these brutes before they attack you and silence them with unity. Take Care and God Bless 🙏\n\nAs nominated distinguished guest from the Ministry, witnessed the fabulous National launch by the President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu of the ‘Spiritual Empowerment for a Clean and Healthy Society’ organised by Brahma Kumaris in New Delhi at Bharat Mandapam. #spiritual #bharatmandapam #president It was pleasure to observe, the President as she emphasized on the golden chapters of world history and the history of nations, and importance of spiritual values. World history is witness to the fact that disregarding spiritual values and adopting only the path of material progress has ultimately proved disastrous. Holistic well-being is possible only on the basis of a healthy mentality. A truly healthy person meets all three dimensions - physical, mental and spiritual. Such individuals create a healthy society, nation and world community. It is concluded that spiritual empowerment is the real empowerment. When the followers of any religion or sect deviate from the path of spirituality, they become victims of fanaticism and suffer from unhealthy mentality. Spiritual values connect people of all religions to each other. let's connect for collective wellbeing. #spirituality #connect #india #bharat Brahmakumaris News Brahmakumaris Nepal Brahmakumaris - India #spiritualpower #power #rajyog #wellbeing\n\nUnshakable Faith – Everything Happens for a Reason Today is Guru Purnima and I would like to express my deep sense of gratitude and bow down to my Guru - Rev. Pandurang Shastri Athavale, Founder of Swadhyay Movement whom we fondly call “Dada”. He was conferred with Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership in 1996, Templeton Price for Progress in Religion in 1997 along with India's second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan Award, in 1999. He introduced us to Universal Way of Life, Way of Worship and Way of Thinking for each one to achieve Spiritual Height. Inspired from Dadaji’s teachings, I would like to share Key learning’s that has become part of my DNA and in case if it helps any one of you 1. Human Efforts + God Grace – Both are equally important. 2. God helps those who help themselves – Nothing comes easy in life. 3. I Can Do Attitude – Proves that youth in you is still alive irrespective of age. 4. Everything happens for a Reason – Have 100 % Unshakeable Faith in Divine Farsightedness whatever you are put through (Good, Bad, Ugly). 5. Change starts with “Me” - Leading to change in Family, Society, Country and World. 6. God resides in Me – My body is Temple of God. I need to be mindful of my thoughts, feelings and action. 7. Swadhyay is regular study of self – “Appointment with God” As Dadaji mentions – to cleanse heart and mind with positive thoughts inspired from our Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagwat Gita in presence of likeminded people. In today’s world filled with multiple distractions, emotional pollution and stress, I find my solace in Swadhyay and Unshakable Faith – “Everything Happens for a Reason” #Gratitude #cando #faith #selfstudy #guru #swadhyay #solace\n\nVaranasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote : “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together”. The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Manikarnika Ghat is one of the holiest cremation grounds among the sacred riverfronts, located on the Ganges, in the city of Varanasi in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. In Hinduism, death is considered a gateway to another life marked by the result of one's karma. Spirituality is a broad concept with room for many perspectives. In general, it includes a sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves, and it typically involves a search for meaning in life. As such, it is a universal human experience—something that touches us all. People may describe a spiritual experience as sacred or transcendent or simply a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness. #spiritual #enjoy #peacebuilding #peaceofmind #alone ##fabrication #momentum\n\nDid you know the Bhagavad Gita isn’t the only “Gita” in Hinduism? ---> Here’s a fascinating twist: the celebrated dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna didn’t gain prominence until Adi Shankaracharya, in the 8th century, wrote a detailed commentary, elevating it as a key text for Vedanta followers. Why did it take so long to catch the public's eye? Well it's still a mystery. Interestingly, it was the British who, puzzled by Hinduism’s rich variety, spotlighted the Bhagavad Gita, likening it to the Bible of Hindus. They viewed its 700 verses through a Christian lens, missing the deeper, multifaceted wisdom it offers. But one of the key reasons Bhagwad Gita did not come under the spotlight before 8th century was that Hindu texts are full of other “Gitas”—over 60 have been identified, with more than 15 in the Mahabharata alone! From the Vyadh Gita to the Devi Gita, each offers unique mind-blowing insights. Here’s a gem: Bhishma reveals nine intriguing Gitas to the Pandavas, including the \"Prostitute’s Song\" (Pingala Gita) and the \"Swan’s Song\" (Hansa Gita) at the end of Mahabharata. And this will surprise you: After the Mahabharata war, Arjuna asks Krishna to repeat the Bhagavad Gita. Instead, Krishna offers him the 'Anu Gita,' a concise summary! Our rich Indian heritage is packed with such surprising tales and mysteries. Truly, Atulya Bharat! #HistoryOfBhagavadGita #BhagavadGita #AncientIndia #IncredibleIndia #AtulyaBharat #Mahabharata #AncientWisdom #IndianKnowledgeSystems\n\nOn this auspicious and historic moment of the Prana Pratishtha of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya Dham, the whole world is in celebration mood. The life of Shri Rama provides a rich source of moral and spiritual guidance, and individuals often turn to his teachings for inspiration and guidance in navigating the complexities of life. I feel, if each one of us could adopt and follow at least just 1 learning of Prabhu Shri Rama, then India can transom itself and rule the world again. Spare some time to go through. 1. Duty First: He emphasizes the importance of fulfilling our responsibilities without attachment to personal gains. 2. Respect Parents: Give love and respect to our parents and honour our commitments to them. 3. Compassion Matters: Be compassionate and forgiving, even in challenging situations. 4. Good Leadership: Lead with fairness, justice, and consideration for the well-being of others. 5. Self-Control: Practice self-control, stay composed, and detach from unnecessary desires. 6. Stay Humble: Despite any achievements, always remain humble and treat everyone with respect 7. Follow Dharma: Shri Rama teaches us to always do what is right and follow moral principles. 8. Ideal Marriage: The relationship between Rama and Sita teaches us about trust, loyalty, and devotion in marriage. #rammandir #shreeram #ayodhya #ayodhyarammandir #learning\n\nHi Friends, These are three books in the Series \"Understanding Hinduism\".
