        "text": "Preface\n\nOriginally I wrote Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in the form in which it is presented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and without explanations for most of the original verses of the Çrémad Bhagavad-gétä. In all of my other books— Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Éçopaniñad, etc.—the system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration, word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning self-evident. I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my original manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gétä As It Is considerably increased, I was requested by many scholars and devotees to present the book in its original form. Thus the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full paramparä explanation in order to establish the Kåñëa consciousness movement more soundly and progressively.\n\nOur Kåñëa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized, natural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is. It is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world, especially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming interested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for my leading the Kåñëa consciousness movement throughout the entire world.\n\nSome of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have started the Kåñëa consciousness movement in America. But actually the Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\noriginal father of this movement is Lord Kåñëa Himself, since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic succession. If I have any credit in this connection, it does not belong to me personally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Oà Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja Prabhupäda.\n\nIf personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried to present Bhagavad-gétä as it is, without any adulteration. Before my presentation of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, almost all the English editions of Bhagavad-gétä were introduced to fulfill someone’s personal ambition. But our attempt, in presenting Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, is to present the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Our business is to present the will of Kåñëa, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or scientist, for they have very little knowledge of Kåñëa, despite all their other knowledge. When Kåñëa says, man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru [Bg. 18.65] , etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that Kåñëa and His inner spirit are different. Kåñëa is absolute, and there is no difference between Kåñëa’s name, Kåñëa’s form, Kåñëa’s qualities, Kåñëa’s pastimes, etc. This absolute position of Kåñëa is difficult to understand for any person who is not a devotee of Kåñëa in the system of paramparä (disciplic succession). Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers, and svämés, without perfect knowledge of Kåñëa, try to banish or kill Kåñëa when writing commentary on Bhagavad-gétä. Such unauthorized commentary upon Bhagavad-gétä is known as Mäyäväda-bhäñya, and Lord Caitanya has warned us about these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone who tries to understand Bhagavad-gétä from the Mäyävädé point of view will commit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that the misguided student of Bhagavad-gétä will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back to home, back to Godhead.\n\nOur only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in order to guide the conditioned student to the same purpose for which Kåñëa descends to this planet once in a day of Brahmä, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is stated in Bhagavad-gétä, and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\npoint in trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä and its speaker, Lord Kåñëa.\n\nLord Kåñëa first spoke Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god some hundreds of millions of years ago. We have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical significance of Bhagavad-gétä, without misinterpretation, on the authority of Kåñëa. To interpret Bhagavad-gétä without any reference to the will of Kåñëa is the greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense, one has to understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was directly understood by Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa’s first disciple. Such understanding of Bhagavad-gétä is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human society in fulfilling the mission of life.\n\nThe Kåñëa consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it offers the highest perfection of life. How this is so is explained fully in the Bhagavad-gétä. Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of Bhagavad-gétä to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people regarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should know how God, or Kåñëa, is great, and everyone should know the factual position of the living entities. Everyone should know that a living entity is eternally a servant and that unless one serves Kåñëa one has to serve illusion in different varieties of the three modes of material nature and thus wander perpetually within the cycle of birth and death; even the so-called liberated Mäyävädé speculator has to undergo this process. This knowledge constitutes a great science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own interest.\n\nPeople in general, especially in this Age of Kali, are enamored by the external energy of Kåñëa, and they wrongly think that by advancement of material comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the material or external nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly bound by the stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service to the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nthis, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad-gétä. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point, and because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad-gétä must take help from the Kåñëa consciousness movement for practical understanding of Bhagavad-gétä under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad-gétä As It Is as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our attempt a success.\n\nA.

It is the essence of Vedic knowledge and one of the most important Upaniñads in Vedic literature. Of course there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gétä, and one may question the necessity for another one. This present edition can be explained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an English translation of Bhagavad-gétä. Of course in America there are so many editions of Bhagavad-gétä available in English, but as far as I have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gétä as it is.\n\nThe spirit of Bhagavad-gétä is mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä itself. It is just like this: If we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the directions written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly, Bhagavad-gétä should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker Himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gétä is Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is mentioned on Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nevery page of Bhagavad-gétä as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän. Of course the word bhagavän sometimes refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod, and certainly here bhagavän designates Lord Çré Kåñëa as a great personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great äcäryas (spiritual masters) like Çaìkaräcärya, Rämänujäcärya, Madhväcärya, Nimbärka Svämé, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in India. The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gétä, and He is accepted as such in the Brahma-saàhitä and all the Puräëas, especially the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, known as the Bhägavata Puräëa ( kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-gétä as it is directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself. In the Fourth Chapter of the Gétä (4.1–3) the Lord says:\n\nimaà vivasvate yogaà\n\nproktavän aham avyayam\n\nvivasvän manave präha\n\nmanur ikñväkave ’bravét\n\n[Bg. 4.1]\n\nevaà paramparä-präptam\n\nimaà räjarñayo viduù\n\nsa käleneha mahatä\n\nyogo nañöaù parantapa\n\n[Bg. 4.2]\n\nsa eväyaà mayä te ’dya\n\nyogaù proktaù purätanaù\n\nbhakto ’si me sakhä ceti\n\nrahasyaà hy etad uttamam\n\n[Bg. 4.3]\n\nHere the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga, the Bhagavad-gétä, was first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, and Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nManu explained it to Ikñväku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one speaker after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the course of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, this time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.\n\nHe tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because Arjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely the jïäné, the yogé and the bhakta, or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparä (disciplic succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish, therefore, to establish another paramparä in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in understanding the Bhagavad-gétä. So we see that Bhagavad-gétä is instructed to Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of Kåñëa, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gétä is best understood by a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different ways:\n\n1. One may be a devotee in a passive state;\n\n2. One may be a devotee in an active state;\n\n3. One may be a devotee as a friend;\n\n4. One may be a devotee as a parent;\n\n5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.\n\nArjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material world. This is transcendental friendship, which cannot be had by everyone. Of course everyone has a particular relationship with the Lord, and Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nthat relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service. But in the present status of our life, not only have we forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we have forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord. Every living being, out of the many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular relationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svarüpa. By the process of devotional service, one can revive that svarüpa, and that stage is called svarüpa-siddhi —perfection of one’s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a devotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.\n\nHow Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gétä should be noted. His manner of acceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter (10.12–14):\n\narjuna uväca\n\nparaà brahma paraà dhäma\n\npavitraà paramaà bhavän\n\npuruñaà çäçvataà divyam\n\nädi-devam ajaà vibhum\n\nähus tväm åñayaù sarve\n\ndevarñir näradas tathä\n\nasito devalo vyäsaù\n\nsvayaà caiva bravéñi me\n\nsarvam etad åtaà manye\n\nyan mäà vadasi keçava\n\nna hi te bhagavan vyaktià\n\nvidur devä na dänaväù\n\nArjuna said: You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate abode, the purest, the Absolute Truth. You are the eternal, transcendental, original person, the unborn, the greatest. All the great sages such as Närada, Asita, Devala, and Vyäsa confirm this truth about You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me. O Kåñëa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your personality.\n\nAfter hearing Bhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nArjuna accepted Kåñëa as paraà brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every living being is Brahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Paraà dhäma means that He is the supreme rest or abode of everything; pavitram means that He is pure, untainted by material contamination; puruñam means that He is the supreme enjoyer; çäçvatam, original; divyam, transcendental; ädi-devam, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ajam, the unborn; and vibhum, the greatest.\n\nNow one may think that because Kåñëa was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna was telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this kind of doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad-gétä, substantiates these praises in the next verse when he says that Kåñëa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead not only by himself but by authorities like Närada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsadeva. These are great personalities who distribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all äcäryas. Therefore Arjuna tells Kåñëa that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect.\n\nSarvam etad åtaà manye: I accept everything You say to be true. Arjuna also says that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He cannot be known even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord cannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how can a human being understand Lord Çré Kåñëa without becoming His devotee?\n\nTherefore Bhagavad-gétä should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One should not think that he is equal to Kåñëa, nor should he think that Kåñëa is an ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So according to the statements of Bhagavad-gétä or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä, we should at least theoretically accept Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with that submissive spirit we can understand the Bhagavad-gétä. Unless one reads the Bhagavad-gétä in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand Bhagavad-gétä, because it is a great mystery.\n\nJust what is the Bhagavad-gétä? The purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to deliver mankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty in so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nof Kurukñetra. Arjuna surrendered unto Çré Kåñëa, and consequently this Bhagavad-gétä was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of anxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the atmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by nonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into asat. Asat refers to that which does not exist.\n\nOut of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are actually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put into this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position of questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all suffering, then one is not to be considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is awakened in one’s mind. In the Brahma-sütra this inquiry is called brahma jijïäsä. Athäto brahma jijïäsä. Every activity of the human being is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute.\n\nTherefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they shall go after death are proper students for understanding Bhagavad-gétä. The sincere student should also have a firm respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.\n\nLord Kåñëa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who awaken, there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position, and for him this Bhagavad-gétä is spoken. Actually we are all swallowed by the tigress of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living entities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gétä, making His friend Arjuna His student.\n\nBeing an associate of Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but Arjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to question Lord Kåñëa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain them for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life.\n\nThe subject of the Bhagavad-gétä entails the comprehension of five basic Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\ntruths. First of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional position of the living entities, jévas. There is éçvara, which means the controller, and there are jévas, the living entities which are controlled. If a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane.\n\nThe living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life.\n\nSo in the Bhagavad-gétä the subject matter deals with the éçvara, the supreme controller, and the jévas, the controlled living entities. Prakåti (material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed. The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are engaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä we must learn what God is, what the living entities are, what prakåti is, what the cosmic manifestation is, how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.\n\nOut of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä it is established that the Supreme Godhead, or Kåñëa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or Paramätmä—you may use whatever name you like—is the greatest of all. The living beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in the later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä. Material nature is not independent. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kåñëa says, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram: This material nature is working under My direction. When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the automobile’s engineering arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction everything is working. Now the jévas, or the living entities, have been accepted by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and similarly we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\ncontroller, éçvara, or Bhagavän, Lord Çré Kåñëa, have all the qualities of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute éçvaras, subordinate éçvaras. We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kåñëa.\n\nBut although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should know that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in Bhagavad-gétä.\n\nWhat is material nature? This is also explained in Gétä as inferior prakåti, inferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prakåti. Prakåti is always under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti is female, and she is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the husband. Prakåti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the predominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated, controlled by the Supreme Lord. According to the Gétä, the living entities, although parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakåti.\n\nThis is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Apareyam itas tv anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm/ jéva-bhütäm: \"This material nature is My inferior prakåti, but beyond this is another prakåti—jéva-bhütäm, the living entity.\"\n\nMaterial nature itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview of eternal time there are activities, which are called karma. These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my money in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma.\n\nÉçvara (the Supreme Lord), jéva (the living entity), prakåti (nature), käla (eternal time) and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. Out of these five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal.\n\nThe manifestation of prakåti may be temporary, but it is not false. Some Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nphilosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but according to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä or according to the philosophy of the Vaiñëavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes grains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then disappears. Such are the workings of prakåti. But this cycle is working eternally. Therefore prakåti is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as\n\n\"My prakåti. \" This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, although they are not separated but eternally related. So the Lord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal.\n\nHowever, the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of karma may be very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or our activity, and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities, but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gétä.\n\nThe position of éçvara, the Supreme Lord, is that of supreme consciousness.\n\nThe jévas, or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as prakåti, the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jéva, is conscious. The other prakåti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore the jéva-prakåti is called superior because the jéva has consciousness which is similar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supreme consciousness, however, and one should not claim that the jéva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious.\n\nThe living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection, and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be, but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.\n\nThe distinction between the jéva and the éçvara will be explained in the Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nThirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord is kñetra-jïa, conscious, as is the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body, whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular jévas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Paramätmä, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone’s heart as éçvara, as the controller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he desires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the actions and reactions of his own karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters another type of body, as we put on and take off clothes. As the soul thus migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed.\n\nConsequently, karma is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items ( éçvara, jéva, prakåti, time and karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not eternal.\n\nThe supreme conscious éçvara is similar to the living entity in this way: both the consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental.\n\nIt is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the Bhagavad-gétä.\n\nConsciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material circumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected. Lord Kåñëa says, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù [Bg. 9.10] . When He descends into the material universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were so affected, He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in the Bhagavad-gétä. One cannot say anything about the transcendental world without being free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is not materially contaminated. Our consciousness, at the present moment, however, is materially contaminated. The Bhagavad-gétä teaches that we have Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nto purify this materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness, our actions will be dovetailed to the will of éçvara, and that will make us happy.\n\nIt is not that we have to cease all activities. Rather, our activities are to be purified, and purified activities are called bhakti. Activities in bhakti appear to be like ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter. They are transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should know, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.\n\nWhen we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned. False consciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material nature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily conceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken to liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this position in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become free from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti, or liberation, means freedom from material consciousness. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also the definition of liberation is given. Muktir hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù: mukti means liberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä are intended to awaken this pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the Gétä’s instructions that Kåñëa is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified consciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified consciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior modes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls.\n\nWhat is this consciousness? This consciousness is I am. Then what am I?\n\nCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn contaminated consciousness I am means I am the lord of all I survey. I am the enjoyer. The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed.\n\nFor instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes, and so on are all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach.\n\nSimilarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be satisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic world.\n\nWe shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-gétä that the complete whole is comprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic manifestation, eternal time and karma, or activities, and all of these are explained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete whole, Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nand the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete whole and the complete Absolute Truth are the complete Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. All manifestations are due to His different energies. He is the complete whole.\n\nIt is also explained in the Gétä that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate to the complete Supreme Person ( brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham). Brahman is more explicitly explained in the Brahma-sütra to be like the rays of the sunshine.\n\nThe impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Paramätmä. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruñottama, is above both impersonal Brahman and the partial realization of Paramätmä. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sac-cid-änanda-vigraha. The Brahma-saàhitä begins in this way: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/ anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam. Govinda, Kåñëa, is the cause of all causes. He is the primal cause, and He is the very form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.\n\nImpersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His sat (eternity) feature.\n\nParamätmä realization is the realization of sat-cit (eternal knowledge). But realization of the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is realization of all the transcendental features: sat, cit and änanda (eternity, knowledge, and bliss) in complete vigraha (form).\n\nPeople with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal, but He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic literatures. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm. ( Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13) As we are all individual living beings and have our individuality, the Supreme Absolute Truth is also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the Personality of Godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features in His complete form. The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if He is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our experience, otherwise it cannot be complete.\n\nThe complete whole, Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies ( paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate). How Kåñëa is acting in different potencies is Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nalso explained in Bhagavad-gétä. This phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to Säìkhya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe.\n\nThere is nothing extraneous, nor is there anything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small complete units, namely the living entities, to realize the complete, and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the complete. So Bhagavad-gétä contains the complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.\n\nAll Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be complete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and according to småti, or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal he has to take a bath to purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is considered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be contradictory, but it is accepted because it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by accepting this, one will not commit a mistake; subsequently it has been proved by modern science that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic knowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes, and Bhagavad-gétä is the essence of all Vedic knowledge.\n\nVedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-gétä, by the paramparä (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Çré Kåñëa, accepts everything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of Bhagavad-gétä and not another. No. We must accept Bhagavad-gétä without interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. The Gétä should be taken as the most Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nperfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself.\n\nThe words spoken by the Lord are called apauruñeya, meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge.\n\nVedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was imparted unto the heart of Brahmä, the first created living being, and Brahmä in his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he originally received it from the Lord. The Lord is pürëam, all-perfect, and there is no possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One should therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only proprietor of everything in the universe and that He is the original creator, the creator of Brahmä. In the Eleventh Chapter the Lord is addressed as prapitämaha [Bg. 11.39] because Brahmä is addressed as pitämaha, the grandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything; one should accept only things which are set aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance.\n\nThere are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä. In the beginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of Kurukñetra. This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This decision was based on the body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on. Therefore he wanted to satisfy his bodily demands. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by the Lord just to change this view, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord when he says, kariñye vacanaà tava [Bg. 18.73] : I shall act according to Your word.\n\nIn this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs. Men Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nmust be intelligent to realize the importance of human life and refuse to act like ordinary animals. A human being should realize the aim of his life, and this direction is given in all Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in Bhagavad-gétä. Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals.\n\nAnimals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä, then our whole life will become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky. [Bg. 15.6]\n\nThat destination is called the sanätana sky, the eternal, spiritual sky. In this material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays for some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is the law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another world of which we have information. That world consists of another nature, which is sanätana, eternal. Jéva is also described as sanätana, eternal, and the Lord is also described as sanätana in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one—the sanätana-dhäma, or sky, the sanätana Supreme Personality and the sanätana living entities—the whole purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to revive our sanätana occupation, or sanätana-dharma, which is the eternal occupation of the living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of these activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called our pure life.\n\nThe Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both sanätana, as are the living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the living entities in the sanätana abode is the perfection of human life. The Lord Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nis very kind to the living entities because they are His sons. Lord Kåñëa declares in Bhagavad-gétä, sarva-yoniñu. .. ahaà béja-pradaù pitä: I am the father of all. Of course there are all types of living entities according to their various karmas, but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them.\n\nTherefore the Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls, to call them back to the sanätana eternal sky so that the sanätana living entities may regain their eternal sanätana positions in eternal association with the Lord. The Lord comes Himself in different incarnations, or He sends His confidential servants as sons or His associates or äcäryas to reclaim the conditioned souls.\n\nTherefore, sanätana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of religion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with the eternal Supreme Lord. Sanätana-dharma refers, as stated previously, to the eternal occupation of the living entity. Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya has explained the word sanätana as that which has neither beginning nor end, so when we speak of sanätana-dharma, we must take it for granted on the authority of Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya that it has neither beginning nor end.\n\nThe English world religion is a little different from sanätana-dharma.\n\nReligion conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but sanätana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity. Sanätana-dharma is eternally integral with the living entity. When we speak of sanätana-dharma, therefore, we must take it for granted on the authority of Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya that it has neither beginning nor end. That which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that sanätana-dharma is also sectarian, but if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible for us to see that sanätana-dharma is the business of all the people of the world—nay, of all the living entities of the universe.\n\nNon- sanätana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nhuman history, but there is no beginning to the history of sanätana-dharma, because it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living entities are concerned, the authoritative çästras state that the living entity has neither birth nor death. In the Gétä it is stated that the living entity is never born and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the concept of sanätana-dharma, we must try to understand the concept of religion from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma refers to that which is constantly existing with a particular object. We conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.\n\nWhen Sanätana Gosvämé asked Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu about the svarüpa of every living being, the Lord replied that the svarüpa, or constitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya’s, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living beings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B\n\nmaster, B serves C master, and C serves D master and so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves the family, and the family serves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being.\n\nIn this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nconstant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being.\n\nYet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or an adherent of any other sect. Such designations are non— sanätana-dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change his faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, Muslim or Christian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to profess a particular type of faith is not to profess one’s sanätana-dharma. The rendering of service is sanätana-dharma.\n\nFactually we are related to the Supreme Lord in service. The Supreme Lord is the supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created for His enjoyment, and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy otherwise. It is not possible to be happy independently, just as no one part of the body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible for the living entity to be happy without rendering transcendental loving service unto the Supreme Lord.\n\nIn the Bhagavad-gétä, worship of different demigods or rendering service to them is not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth verse: kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù\n\nprapadyante ’nya-devatäù\n\ntaà taà niyamam ästhäya\n\nprakåtyä niyatäù svayä\n\nThose whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures. Here it is plainly said that those who are directed by lust worship the demigods and not the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. When we mention the name Kåñëa, we do not refer to any sectarian name. Kåñëa means the highest pleasure, and it is confirmed that the Supreme Lord is the Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nreservoir or storehouse of all pleasure. We are all hankering after pleasure.\n\nÄnanda-mayo ’bhyäsät ( Vedänta-sütra 1.1.12). The living entities, like the Lord, are full of consciousness, and they are after happiness. The Lord is perpetually happy, and if the living entities associate with the Lord, cooperate with Him and take part in His association, then they also become happy.\n\nThe Lord descends to this mortal world to show His pastimes in Våndävana, which are full of happiness. When Lord Çré Kåñëa was in Våndävana, His activities with His cowherd boyfriends, with His damsel friends, with the other inhabitants of Våndävana and with the cows were all full of happiness. The total population of Våndävana knew nothing but Kåñëa. But Lord Kåñëa even discouraged His father Nanda Mahäräja from worshiping the demigod Indra, because He wanted to establish the fact that people need not worship any demigod. They need only worship the Supreme Lord, because their ultimate goal is to return to His abode.\n\nThe abode of Lord Çré Kåñëa is described in the Bhagavad-gétä, Fifteenth Chapter, sixth verse:\n\nna tad bhäsayate süryo\n\nna çaçäìko na pävakaù\n\nyad gatvä na nivartante\n\ntad dhäma paramaà mama\n\nThat supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.\n\nThis verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a material conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun, moon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky there is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti, the rays emanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach other planets, but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the Supreme Lord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-saàhitä (5.37) it is beautifully described: goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù. The Lord resides eternally in His abode Goloka, yet He can be approached from this world, and Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\n\nto this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, sac-cid-änanda-vigraha\n\n[ Bs. 5.1] . When He manifests this form, there is no need for our imagining what He looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and exhibits Himself as He is, as Çyämasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent deride Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being.\n\nBut because of this we should not consider the Lord one of us. It is by His omnipotency that He presents Himself in His real form before us and displays His pastimes, which are replicas of those pastimes found in His abode.\n\nIn the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets floating. The brahmajyoti emanates from the supreme abode, Kåñëaloka, and the änanda-maya, cin-maya planets, which are not material, float in those rays.\n\nThe Lord says, na tad bhäsayate süryo na çaçäìko na pävakaù/ yad gatvä na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama [Bg. 15.6]. One who can approach that spiritual sky is not required to descend again to the material sky. In the material sky, even if we approach the highest planet (Brahmaloka), what to speak of the moon, we will find the same conditions of life, namely birth, death, disease and old age. No planet in the material universe is free from these four principles of material existence.\n\nThe living entities are traveling from one planet to another, but it is not that we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement. If we desire to go to other planets, there is a process for going there. This is also mentioned: yänti deva-vratä devän pitèn yänti pitå-vratäù [Bg. 9.25] . No mechanical arrangement is necessary if we want interplanetary travel. The Gétä instructs: yänti deva-vratä devän. The moon, the sun and higher planets are called Svargaloka. There are three different statuses of planets: higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The earth belongs to the middle planetary system. Bhagavad-gétä informs us how to travel to the higher planetary systems (Devaloka) with a very simple formula: yänti deva-vratä devän. One need only worship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to the moon, the sun or any of the higher planetary systems.\n\nYet Bhagavad-gétä does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this material world, because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet, through some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l.

But one who wants to approach the supreme planet, Kåñëaloka, or any of the other planets within the spiritual sky, will not meet with these material inconveniences. Amongst all of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka Våndävana, which is the original planet in the abode of the original Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. All of this information is given in Bhagavad-gétä, and we are given through its instruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky.\n\nIn the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, the real picture of the material world is given. It is said there:\n\nürdhva-mülam adhaù-çäkham\n\naçvatthaà prähur avyayam\n\nchandäàsi yasya parëäni\n\nyas taà veda sa veda-vit\n\nHere the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside"
