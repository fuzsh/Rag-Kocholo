        "text": "Actor Anupam Kher has appeared in hundreds of successful films in his native India and became recognized all over the world for his roles in critically acclaimed films like \"Bend It Like Beckham\" (2002), \"Lust, Caution\" (2007) and \"Silver Linings Playbook\" (2012). Born and raised in the Indian city of Shimla, Kher grew up in relatively modest upbringings. However, he always had a desire to become a professional actor. Thus, when he was of age Kher moved to New Delhi to study acting at the prestigious National School of Drama. After graduation Kher moved to Mumbai to pursue his acting career in earnest. The early days of his career were full of intense struggle and sacrifice. While attempting to chart his own course in the thriving Indian film industry, Kher had no money and had to sleep on train station platforms because he couldn't afford an apartment. His luck would change, however, in 1982 after he landed his first role in the Indian film \"Apmaan\" (1982). It was the beginning of a thriving film career that would include hundreds of roles in Indian films over the course of the next thirty-plus years. By the early 2000s, with his film acting in career in India thriving, Kher began widening his appeal by appearing in international films. In addition to appearing in the critically acclaimed \"Bend It Like Beckham,\" Kher also nabbed parts in the equally as popular \"Lust, Caution\" (2007) and \"Silver Linings Playbook.\" With his acting career in both India and throughout the world on the rise, Kher continued working steadily throughout the 2010s. In the United States he became a recognizable face for his recurring part on the Netflix science fiction series \"Sense8\" (Netflix, 2015-18), as well for his supporting role in the 2017 Oscar-nominated comedy-drama \"The Big Sick\" (2017). Furthermore, Kher added to his resume of appearing in English language films and television shows by appearing in a recurring role on the BBC mini-series \"Mrs. Wilson\" (BBC, 2018). \"Mrs. Wilson,\" which is set in both India and London throughout the 1930s to the 1960s, premiered on the BBC in 2018."
