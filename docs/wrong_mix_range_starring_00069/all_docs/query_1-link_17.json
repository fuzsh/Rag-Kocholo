        "meta_description": "Abstract. Mineral dust is an important component of the climate system, affecting the\nradiation balance, cloud properties, biogeochemical cycles, regional\ncirculation and precipitation, as well as having negative effects on\naviation, solar energy generation and human health. Dust size and composition\nhas an impact on all these processes. However, changes in dust size\ndistribution and composition during transport, particularly for coarse\nparticles, are poorly understood and poorly represented in climate models.\nHere we present new in situ airborne observations of dust in the Saharan Air\nLayer (SAL) and the marine boundary layer (MBL) at the beginning of its\ntransatlantic transport pathway, from the AERosol\nProperties â Dust (AER-D) fieldwork in AugustÂ 2015,\nwithin the peak season of North African dust export. This study focuses on\ncoarse-mode dust properties, including size distribution, mass loading,\nshape, composition, refractive indices and optical properties. Size\ndistributions from 0.1 to 100âÂµm diameter (d) are presented, fully\nincorporating the coarse and giant modes of dust. Within the MBL, mean\neffective diameter (deff) and volume median diameter (VMD) were 4.6 and 6.0âÂµm respectively, giant particles with a mode at\n20â30âÂµm were observed, and composition was dominated by quartz and\nalumino-silicates at dâ>â1âÂµm. Within the SAL, particles\nlarger than 20âÂµm diameter were always present up to 5âkm altitude, in\nconcentrations over 10â5âcmâ3, constituting up to 40â% of\ntotal dust mass. Mean deff and VMD were 4.0 and 5.5âÂµm\nrespectively. Larger particles were detected in the SAL than can be explained\nby sedimentation theory alone. Coarse-mode composition was dominated by\nquartz and alumino-silicates; the accumulation mode showed a strong\ncontribution from sulfate-rich and sea salt particles. In the SAL, measured\nsingle scattering albedos (SSAs) at 550ânm representing dâ<â2.5âÂµm were\n0.93 to 0.98 (mean 0.97). Optical properties calculated for the full\nsize distribution (0.1â<âdâ<â100âÂµm) resulted in lower\nSSAs of 0.91â0.98 (mean 0.95) and mass extinction coefficients of 0.27â0.35âm2âgâ1 (mean 0.32âm2âgâ1). Variability in SSA was mainly\ncontrolled by variability in dust composition (principally iron) rather than\nby variations in the size distribution, in contrast with previous observations\nover the Sahara where size is the dominant influence. It is important that\nmodels are able to capture the variability and evolution of both dust\ncomposition and size distribution with transport in order to accurately\nrepresent the impacts of dust on climate. These results provide a new SAL\ndust dataset, fully representing coarse and giant particles, to aid model\nvalidation and development.",

This has financial implications for the aviation industry and results in increased fuel burn with climate impacts. Here we quantify dust ingestion by aircraft engines at airports worldwide. We find Dubai and Delhi in summer are among the dustiest airports, where substantial engine degradation would occur after 1000 flights. Dust ingestion can be reduced by changing take-off times and the altitude of holding patterns.\n\nA near-global multiyear climate data record of the fine-mode and coarse-mode components of atmospheric pure dust\n\nEmmanouil Proestakis, Antonis Gkikas, Thanasis Georgiou, Anna Kampouri, Eleni Drakaki, Claire L. Ryder, Franco Marenco, Eleni Marinou, and Vassilis Amiridis\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 3625–3667, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3625-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3625-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new four-dimensional, multiyear, and near-global climate data record of the fine-mode (submicrometer diameter) and coarse-mode (supermicrometer diameter) components of atmospheric pure dust is presented. The dataset is considered unique with respect to a wide range of potential applications, including climatological, time series, and trend analysis over extensive geographical domains and temporal periods, validation of atmospheric dust models and datasets, and air quality.\n\nSensitivity of global direct aerosol shortwave radiative forcing to uncertainties in aerosol optical properties\n\nJonathan Elsey, Nicolas Bellouin, and Claire Ryder\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4065–4081, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4065-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4065-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols influence the Earth's energy balance. The uncertainty in this radiative forcing is large depending partly on uncertainty in measurements of aerosol optical properties. We have developed a freely available new framework of millions of radiative transfer simulations spanning aerosol uncertainty and assess the impact on radiative forcing uncertainty. We find that reducing these uncertainties would reduce radiative forcing uncertainty, but non-aerosol uncertainties must also be considered.\n\nLong range transport of coarse mineral dust: an evaluation of the Met Office Unified Model against aircraft observations\n\nNatalie Georgina Ratcliffe, Claire Louise Ryder, Nicolas Bellouin, Stephanie Woodward, Anthony Jones, Ben Johnson, Bernadett Weinzierl, Lisa-Maria Wieland, and Josef Gasteiger\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-806,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-806, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge mineral dust particles are more abundant in the atmosphere than expected and have different impacts on the environment than small particles, which are better represented in climate models. We use aircraft measurements to assess a climate model representation of large dust transport. We find that the model underestimates the amount of large dust at all stages of transport and that fast removal of the large particles increases this underestimation with distance from the Sahara.\n\nThe key role of atmospheric absorption in the Asian Summer Monsoon response to dust emissions in CMIP6 models\n\nAlcide Zhao, Laura Wilcox, and Claire Ryder\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3075,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3075, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models include desert dust aerosols, which interact with radiation and can change circulation patterns. We assess the effect of dust on the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons through multi-model experiments where dust emissions are doubled, isolating the effect of dust for the first time. We find that dust results in an enhanced Indian summer monsoon and a southward shift of equatorial rainfall. Our results show the importance of accurate dust representation in climate model.\n\nThermal infrared dust optical depth and coarse-mode effective diameter over oceans retrieved from collocated MODIS and CALIOP observations\n\nJianyu Zheng, Zhibo Zhang, Hongbin Yu, Anne Garnier, Qianqian Song, Chenxi Wang, Claudia Di Biagio, Jasper F. Kok, Yevgeny Derimian, and Claire Ryder\n\nAtmos. Chem.

It reveals climatological coarse-mode dust transport patterns and regional differences over the North Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the North Pacific.\n\nModeling coarse and giant desert dust particles\n\nEleni Drakaki, Vassilis Amiridis, Alexandra Tsekeri, Antonis Gkikas, Emmanouil Proestakis, Sotirios Mallios, Stavros Solomos, Christos Spyrou, Eleni Marinou, Claire L. Ryder, Demetri Bouris, and Petros Katsafados\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12727–12748, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12727-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12727-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nState-of-the-art atmospheric dust models have limitations in accounting for a realistic dust size distribution (emission, transport). We modify the parameterization of the mineral dust cycle by including particles with diameter >20 Î¼m, as indicated by observations over deserts. Moreover, we investigate the effects of reduced settling velocities of dust particles. Model results are evaluated using airborne and spaceborne dust measurements above Cabo Verde.\n\nBelow-cloud scavenging of aerosol by rain: a review of numerical modelling approaches and sensitivity simulations with mineral dust in the Met Office's Unified Model\n\nAnthony C. Jones, Adrian Hill, John Hemmings, Pascal Lemaitre, Arnaud QuÃ©rel, Claire L. Ryder, and Stephanie Woodward\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 11381–11407, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-11381-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-11381-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs raindrops fall to the ground, they capture aerosol (i.e. below-cloud scavenging or BCS). Many different BCS schemes are available to climate models, and it is unclear what the impact of selecting one scheme over another is. Here, various BCS models are outlined and then applied to mineral dust in climate model simulations. We find that dust concentrations are highly sensitive to the BCS scheme, with dust atmospheric lifetimes ranging from 5 to 44 d.\n\nHow well do the CMIP6 models simulate dust aerosols?\n\nAlcide Zhao, Claire L. Ryder, and Laura J. Wilcox\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2095–2119, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2095-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2095-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe CMIP6 models' simulated dust processes are getting more uncertain as models become more sophisticated. Of particular challenge are the links between dust cycles and optical properties, and we recommend more detailed output relating to dust cycles in future intercomparison projects to constrain such links. Also, models struggle to capture certain key regional dust processes such as dust accumulation along the slope of the Himalayas and dust seasonal cycles in North China and North America.\n\nObservation and modeling of the historic âGodzillaâ African dust intrusion into the Caribbean Basin and the southern US in June 2020\n\nHongbin Yu, Qian Tan, Lillian Zhou, Yaping Zhou, Huisheng Bian, Mian Chin, Claire L. Ryder, Robert C. Levy, Yaswant Pradhan, Yingxi Shi, Qianqian Song, Zhibo Zhang, Peter R. Colarco, Dongchul Kim, Lorraine A. Remer, Tianle Yuan, Olga Mayol-Bracero, and Brent N. Holben\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 12359–12383, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12359-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12359-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study characterizes a historic African dust intrusion into the Caribbean Basin in June 2020 using satellites and NASA GEOS. Dust emissions in West Africa were large albeit not extreme. However, a unique synoptic system accumulated the dust near the coast for about 4 d before it was ventilated. Although GEOS reproduced satellite-observed plume tracks well, it substantially underestimated dust emissions and did not lift up dust high enough for ensuing long-range transport.\n\nOptimal use of the Prede POM sky radiometer for aerosol, water vapor, and ozone retrievals\n\nRei Kudo, Henri DiÃ©moz, Victor EstellÃ©s, Monica Campanelli, Masahiro Momoi, Franco Marenco, Claire L. Ryder, Osamu Ijima, Akihiro Uchiyama, Kouichi Nakashima, Akihiro Yamazaki, Ryoji Nagasawa, Nozomu Ohkawara, and Haruma Ishida\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3395–3426, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3395-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3395-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new method, Skyrad pack MRI version 2, was developed to retrieve aerosol physical and optical properties, water vapor, and ozone column concentrations from the sky radiometer, a filter radiometer deployed in the SKYNET international network. Our method showed good performance in a radiative closure study using surface solar irradiances from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network and a comparison using aircraft in situ measurements of Saharan dust events during the SAVEX-D 2015 campaign.\n\nModels transport Saharan dust too low in the atmosphere: a comparison of the MetUM and CAMS forecasts with observations\n\nDebbie O'Sullivan, Franco Marenco, Claire L. Ryder, Yaswant Pradhan, Zak Kipling, Ben Johnson, Angela Benedetti, Melissa Brooks, Matthew McGill, John Yorks, and Patrick Selmer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 12955–12982, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12955-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12955-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMineral dust is an important component of the climate system, and we assess how well it is predicted by two operational models. We flew an aircraft in the dust layers in the eastern Atlantic, and we also make use of satellites. We show that models predict the dust layer too low and that it predicts the particles to be too small. We believe that these discrepancies may be overcome if models can be constrained with operational observations of dust vertical and size-resolved distribution.\n\nAn overview of and issues with sky radiometer technology and SKYNET\n\nTeruyuki Nakajima, Monica Campanelli, Huizheng Che, Victor EstellÃ©s, Hitoshi Irie, Sang-Woo Kim, Jhoon Kim, Dong Liu, Tomoaki Nishizawa, Govindan Pandithurai, Vijay Kumar Soni, Boossarasiri Thana, Nas-Urt Tugjsurn, Kazuma Aoki, Sujung Go, Makiko Hashimoto, Akiko Higurashi, Stelios Kazadzis, Pradeep Khatri, Natalia Kouremeti, Rei Kudo, Franco Marenco, Masahiro Momoi, Shantikumar S. Ningombam, Claire L. Ryder, Akihiro Uchiyama, and Akihiro Yamazaki\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 4195–4218, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4195-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4195-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper overviews the progress in sky radiometer technology and the development of the network called SKYNET. It is found that the technology has produced useful on-site calibration methods, retrieval algorithms, and data analyses from sky radiometer observations of aerosol, cloud, water vapor, and ozone. The paper also discusses current issues of SKYNET to provide better information for the community.\n\nCoarse and giant particles are ubiquitous in Saharan dust export regions and are radiatively significant over the Sahara\n\nClaire L. Ryder, Eleanor J. Highwood, Adrian Walser, Petra Seibert, Anne Philipp, and Bernadett Weinzierl\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 15353–15376, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15353-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15353-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMineral dust is lifted into the atmosphere from desert regions, where it can be transported over thousands of kilometres around the world. Dust impacts weather, climate, aviation, and air quality. We evaluate new aircraft observations of dust size. We find that the largest particles typically omitted by models have a significant impact on the interactions of dust with radiation and therefore climate. We also find that large dust particles are retained in the atmosphere longer than expected.\n\nUnexpected vertical structure of the Saharan Air Layer and giant dust particles during AER-D\n\nFranco Marenco, Claire Ryder, Victor EstellÃ©s, Debbie O'Sullivan, Jennifer Brooke, Luke Orgill, Gary Lloyd, and Martin Gallagher\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17655–17668, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17655-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17655-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe AER-D airborne campaign characterised Saharan dust in the eastern Atlantic. We report an instance of unusual vertical structure of the Saharan Air Layer during an intense event, showing a large radiative impact and correlated with anomalous lightning activity. Moreover, we report a significant presence of giant dust particles. This is important because most models would miss the giant particles. Our findings may change the way we represent dust transport and deposition in the Atlantic.\n\nNet radiative effects of dust in the tropical North Atlantic based on integrated satellite observations and in situ measurements\n\nQianqian Song, Zhibo Zhang, Hongbin Yu, Seiji Kato, Ping Yang, Peter Colarco, Lorraine A. Remer, and Claire L. Ryder\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 11303–11322, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11303-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11303-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMineral dust is the most abundant atmospheric aerosol component in terms of dry mass. In this study, we integrate recent aircraft measurements of dust microphysical and optical properties with satellite retrievals of aerosol and radiative fluxes to quantify the dust direct radiative effects on the shortwave and longwave radiation at both the top of the atmosphere and the surface in the tropical North Atlantic during summer months.\n\nCan explicit convection improve modelled dust in summertime West Africa?\n\nAlexander J. Roberts, Margaret J. Woodage, John H. Marsham, Ellie J. Highwood, Claire L. Ryder, Willie McGinty, Simon Wilson, and Julia Crook\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 9025–9048, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-9025-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-9025-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe summer Saharan dust hotspot is seasonally tied to the occurrence of convective storms. Global weather and climate models parameterise convection and so are unable to represent their associated dust uplift (haboobs). However, this work shows that even when simulations represent convection explicitly: (1) dust fields are not strongly affected, (2) convective storms are too small, (3) haboobs are too weak and (4) the land surface (bare soil and soil moisture) is dominant in controlling dust.\n\nThe effect of South American biomass burning aerosol emissions on the regional climate\n\nGillian D. Thornhill, Claire L. Ryder, Eleanor J. Highwood, Len C. Shaffrey, and Ben T. Johnson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 5321–5342, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5321-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5321-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the impact on the regional climate of different amounts of smoke emission (aerosol) from the burning of vegetation in South America using a climate model. We looked at differences between high and low smoke emissions and found impacts from the higher smoke emissions on the amount of cloud cover, solar radiation reaching the surface, wind patterns and rainfall. This means the local climate may be affected if there is more deforestation and more smoke from burning of vegetation.\n\nAircraft and ground measurements of dust aerosols over the west African coast in summer 2015 during ICE-D and AER-D\n\nDantong Liu, Jonathan W. Taylor, Jonathan Crosier, Nicholas Marsden, Keith N. Bower, Gary Lloyd, Claire L. Ryder, Jennifer K. Brooke, Richard Cotton, Franco Marenco, Alan Blyth, Zhiqiang Cui, Victor Estelles, Martin Gallagher, Hugh Coe, and Tom W. Choularton\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 3817–3838, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-3817-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-3817-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article presents measurements of aerosol properties off the coast of west Africa during August 2015. For the first time, an airborne laser-induced incandescence instrument was deployed to measure the hematite content of dust. The single scattering albedo of dust was found to be influenced by the hematite content, but depended on the dust source and potential dust age. This highlights the importance of size-dependent composition in determining the optical properties of dust.\n\nThe early summertime Saharan heat low: sensitivity of the radiation budget and atmospheric heating to water vapour and dust aerosol\n\nNetsanet K. Alamirew, Martin C. Todd, Claire L. Ryder, John H. Marsham, and Yi Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 1241–1262, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-1241-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-1241-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper quantifies the radiative effects of dust and water vapour in the Saharan heat low. Dust has a warming effect at the top of the atmosphere while cooling the surface. Water vapour has a warming effect both at the top of atmosphere and the surface. We find dust and water vapour have similar effects in driving the variability in the top-of-atmosphere radiative budget, while dust has a stronger effect than water vapour in controlling day-to-day variability of the surface radiative budget.\n\nA detailed characterization of the Saharan dust collected during the Fennec campaign inÂ 2011: in situ ground-based and laboratory measurements\n\nAdriana Rocha-Lima, J. Vanderlei Martins, Lorraine A. Remer, Martin Todd, John H. Marsham, Sebastian Engelstaedter, Claire L. Ryder, Carolina Cavazos-Guerra, Paulo Artaxo, Peter Colarco, and Richard Washington\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 18, 1023–1043, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-1023-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-1023-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present results of ground-based measurements and subsequent laboratory analysis of Sahara dust samples collected in Algeria and Mauritania during the Fennec campaign in 2011. The results show that the sampled dust has low absorption characteristics and exhibits a distinct spectral bow-like shape. We find distinctive differences in the composition and optical characteristics of the dust from the two sites, corroborating with other studies that not all Saharan dust is the same.\n\nA case study of the radiative effect of aerosols over Europe: EUCAARI-LONGREX\n\nAnna R. Esteve, Eleanor J. Highwood, and Claire L. Ryder\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 7639–7651, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7639-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7639-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radiative effect of aerosols over Europe during the EUCAARI-LONGREX campaign has been calculated using measurements made by the FAAM BAe-146 aircraft and radiative transfer modelling. For one specially designed flight, simulated irradiances have been compared to radiation measurements to explore the validity of model assumptions. We have quantified the uncertainties in our calculations due to the way in which aerosols and other parameters are represented in a radiative transfer model.\n\nThe contrasting roles of water and dust in controlling daily variations in radiative heating of the summertime Saharan heat low\n\nJohn H. Marsham, Douglas J. Parker, Martin C. Todd, Jamie R. Banks, Helen E. Brindley, Luis Garcia-Carreras, Alexander J. Roberts, and Claire L. Ryder\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 3563–3575, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-3563-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-3563-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe roles of water, clouds and airborne dust in controlling the heating of the Sahara are uncertain, which has major implications for the West African monsoon. Observations from the Fennec project, with satellite data, show that total atmospheric water content provides a far stronger control on total radiative heating than dust does, but dust provides the stronger control on surface heating. Therefore major heating errors in global models are likely due to known errors in water transport.\n\nAdvances in understanding mineral dust and boundary layer processes over the Sahara from Fennec aircraft observations\n\nC.

Novel observations were made by the Fennec climate programme during June 2011 and 2012 using ground-based, remote sensing and airborne platforms. Here we describe the airborne observations and the contributions they have made to furthering our understanding of the Saharan climate system.\n\nIntercomparison of shortwave radiative transfer schemes in global aerosol modeling: results from the AeroCom Radiative Transfer Experiment\n\nC.

Here, a satellite-based dataset of FLCs, reanalysis data and machine learning are used to systematically analyze FLCs persistence under different aerosol loadings. Aerosol plumes are shown to modify local thermodynamics which increases FLC persistence. But fully disentangling aerosol effects from meteorological ones remains a challenge.\n\nAircraft engine dust ingestion at global airports\n\nClaire L. Ryder, ClÃ©ment BÃ©zier, Helen F.

This has financial implications for the aviation industry and results in increased fuel burn with climate impacts. Here we quantify dust ingestion by aircraft engines at airports worldwide. We find Dubai and Delhi in summer are among the dustiest airports, where substantial engine degradation would occur after 1000 flights. Dust ingestion can be reduced by changing take-off times and the altitude of holding patterns.\n\nLong-term evaluation of commercial air quality sensors: an overview from the QUANT (Quantification of Utility of Atmospheric Network Technologies) study\n\nSebastian Diez, Stuart Lacy, Hugh Coe, Josefina Urquiza, Max Priestman, Michael Flynn, Nicholas Marsden, Nicholas A.

The data cleaning method was successful in improving the inter-sensor variability among the Atmotube Pro sensors data. This study showed 62.5 % of the sensors used for the study exhibited greater precision in their measurements. The overall performance showed the sensors passed the base testing recommended by USEPA using one-hour averaged data.\n\nA near-global multiyear climate data record of the fine-mode and coarse-mode components of atmospheric pure dust\n\nEmmanouil Proestakis, Antonis Gkikas, Thanasis Georgiou, Anna Kampouri, Eleni Drakaki, Claire L.

However, in many weather and climate models cloud ice is not linked to aerosol that are known to nucleate ice. Here we report the first steps towards representing ice-nucleating particles within the UK's Earth System Model. We conclude that in addition to ice nucleation by sea spray and mineral components of soil dust we also need to represent ice nucleation by the organic components of soils.\n\nAtmospheric ice-nucleating particles in the eastern Mediterranean and the contribution of mineral and biological aerosol\n\nMark D.

We found that the INP activity is typically dominated by K-feldspar mineral dust but that air masses passing over regions of fertile soils correlated with high INP concentrations and indicators of biological activity. This suggests that these fertile regions could be sporadic sources of warm-temperature biogenic INPs and warrants further study of these areas.\n\nThe first microwave and submillimetre closure study using particle models of oriented ice hydrometeors to simulate polarimetric measurements of ice clouds\n\nKarina McCusker, Anthony J. Baran, Chris Westbrook, Stuart Fox, Patrick Eriksson, Richard Cotton, Julien DelanoÃ«, and Florian Ewald\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 3533–3552, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3533-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3533-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPolarised radiative transfer simulations are performed using an atmospheric model based on in situ measurements. These are compared to large polarisation measurements to explore whether such measurements can provide information on cloud ice, e.g. particle shape and orientation. We find that using oriented particle models with shapes based on imagery generally allows for accurate simulations. However, results are sensitive to shape assumptions such as the choice of single crystals or aggregates.\n\nCharacterisation of particle single-scattering albedo with a modified airborne dual-wavelength CAPS monitor\n\nChenjie Yu, Edouard Pangui, Kevin Tu, Mathieu Cazaunau, Maxime Feingesicht, Landsheere Xavier, Thierry Bourrianne, Vincent Michoud, Christopher Cantrell, Timothy B.

This study reports the results in the laboratory and an aircraft campaign over Paris and its surrounding regions. The results demonstrate A2S2's reliability in measuring aerosol optical properties at both wavelengths and its suitability for future aircraft campaigns.\n\nHigh ice-nucleating particle concentrations associated with Arctic haze in springtime cold-air outbreaks\n\nErin N.

We measured INP concentrations over the Norwegian and Barents seas in weather events where cold air is ejected from the Arctic. These concentrations were among the highest measured in the Arctic and it is likely that the INPs were transported to the Arctic from distant regions. These results show it is important to consider hemispheric-scale INP processes to understand INP concentrations in the Arctic.\n\nThe evolution of warm rain in trade-wind cumulus during EUREC4A\n\nGary Lloyd, Alan Blyth, Zhiqiang Cui, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Martin Gallagher, Michael Flynn, Nicholas Marsden, Leif Denby, and Peter Gallimore\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-142,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-142, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClouds that develop in the tropical trade-wind regions are extensive and persistent in nature. They are important for understanding how the magnitude of warming by these cloud systems might change in a warming climate. This paper describes measurements of common cloud types in these regions (shallow cumulus clouds) and the way in which they produce rainfall. During different periods, with different amounts of particulate in the air, the characteristics of the clouds were very different.\n\nObservationally constrained regional variations of shortwave absorption by iron oxides emphasize the cooling effect of dust\n\nVincenzo Obiso, MarÃ­a GonÃ§alves Ageitos, Carlos PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a-Pando, Jan P.

Linking dust absorption at solar wavelengths to the varying amount of specific minerals (i.e., iron oxides) improves the modeled range of dust single scattering albedo compared to observations and increases the global cooling by dust. Our results may contribute to improved estimates of the dust DRE and its climate impact.\n\nDeep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX) coordinated aircraft and ground observations: microphysics, aerosol, and dynamics during cumulonimbus development\n\nDeclan L.

The campaign coordinated a broad range of instrumentation measuring aerosol, cloud physics, radar signals, thermodynamics, dynamics, electric fields, and weather. The project's objectives included the utilisation of these data with satellite observations to study the anvil cloud radiative effect.\n\nEfficient droplet activation of ambient black carbon particles in a suburban environment\n\nPing Tian, Dantong Liu, Kang Hu, Yangzhou Wu, Mengyu Huang, Hui He, Jiujiang Sheng, Chenjie Yu, Dawei Hu, and Deping Ding\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation fraction of BC was higher than for all particles, suggesting higher CCN activity of BC, even though its hygroscopicity is lower. Our research reveals that the evolution of BC's hygroscopicity and its CCN activation properties through atmospheric aging can be effectively characterized by the photochemical age.\n\nThe radiative impact of biomass burning aerosols on dust emissions over Namibia and the long-range transport of smoke observed during the Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) campaign\n\nCyrille Flamant, Jean-Pierre Chaboureau, Marco Gaetani, Kerstin Schepanski, and Paola Formenti\n\nAtmos.

This study suggests that the radiative effect of biomass burning aerosols needs to be taken into account to properly forecast dust emissions in Namibia.\n\nIce-nucleating particles active below -24 °C in a Finnish boreal forest and their relationship to bioaerosols\n\nFranziska Vogel, Michael P.

We present 2 months INP measurements in a Finnish boreal forest using a new semi-autonomous INP counting device based on gas expansion. These results show strong variability in INP concentrations, and we present a case that the INP we observe are, at least some of the time, of biological origin.\n\nSensitivity of global direct aerosol shortwave radiative forcing to uncertainties in aerosol optical properties\n\nJonathan Elsey, Nicolas Bellouin, and Claire Ryder\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4065–4081, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4065-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4065-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols influence the Earth's energy balance. The uncertainty in this radiative forcing is large depending partly on uncertainty in measurements of aerosol optical properties. We have developed a freely available new framework of millions of radiative transfer simulations spanning aerosol uncertainty and assess the impact on radiative forcing uncertainty. We find that reducing these uncertainties would reduce radiative forcing uncertainty, but non-aerosol uncertainties must also be considered.\n\nMeasurement report: The Fifth International Workshop on Ice Nucleation Phase 1 (FIN-01): Intercomparison of Single Particle Mass Spectrometers\n\nXiaoli Shen, David M.

Intercomparison of SPMSs was conducted. All instruments reported similar size ranges and common spectral features. The instrument-specific detection efficiency was found to be more dependent on particle size than type. All instruments differentiated secondary organic aerosol, soot, and soil dust, but had difficulties differentiating among specific minerals and dusts.\n\nLong range transport of coarse mineral dust: an evaluation of the Met Office Unified Model against aircraft observations\n\nNatalie Georgina Ratcliffe, Claire Louise Ryder, Nicolas Bellouin, Stephanie Woodward, Anthony Jones, Ben Johnson, Bernadett Weinzierl, Lisa-Maria Wieland, and Josef Gasteiger\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-806,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-806, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge mineral dust particles are more abundant in the atmosphere than expected and have different impacts on the environment than small particles, which are better represented in climate models. We use aircraft measurements to assess a climate model representation of large dust transport. We find that the model underestimates the amount of large dust at all stages of transport and that fast removal of the large particles increases this underestimation with distance from the Sahara.\n\nCALOTRITON: a convective boundary layer height estimation algorithm from ultra-high-frequency (UHF) wind profiler data\n\nAlban Philibert, Marie Lothon, Julien Amestoy, Pierre-Yves Meslin, SolÃ¨ne Derrien, Yannick Bezombes, Bernard Campistron, Fabienne Lohou, Antoine Vial, Guylaine Canut-Rocafort, Joachim Reuder, and Jennifer K.

CALOTRITON is partly based on the principle that the top of the convective boundary layer is associated with an inversion and a decrease in turbulence. It is evaluated using ceilometer and radiosonde data. It is able to qualify the complexity of the vertical structure of the low troposphere and detect internal or residual layers.\n\nLidar depolarization characterization using a reference system\n\nAlkistis Papetta, Franco Marenco, Maria Kezoudi, Rodanthi-Elisavet Mamouri, Argyro Nisantzi, Holger Baars, Ioana Elisabeta Popovici, Philippe Goloub, StÃ©phane Victori, and Jean Sciare\n\nAtmos.

It uses three-parameter equations to compare VDR between two co-located lidars at dust and molecular layers. It can be applied retrospectively to existing data acquired during campaigns. Its application to Cimel CE376 corrected VDR bias at high- and low-depolarizing layers.\n\nThe Co-benefits of a Low-Carbon Future on Air Quality in Europe\n\nConnor J. Clayton, Daniel R. Marsh, Steven T. Turnock, Ailish M. Graham, Kirsty J. Pringle, Carly L. Reddington, Rajesh Kumar, and James B. McQuaid\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-755,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-755, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate that strong climate mitigation could lead to vastly improved air quality in Europe, however, only minimal benefits are seen following the current trajectory of climate mitigation. We use a model that allows us to see where the improvements are greatest (Central Europe) and analyse what sectors are most important for achieving these co-benefits (agriculture/power).\n\nSignificant Influence of UV-vis Irradiation on Cloud Activation Efficiencies of Ammonium Sulfate Aerosols under Simulated Chamber Conditions\n\nAnil Kumar Mandariya, Junteng Wu, Anne Monod, Paola Formenti, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Picquet-Varrault, Mathieu Cazaunau, Stephan Mertes, Laurent Poulain, Antonin Berge, Edouard Pangui, Andreas Tilgner, Thomas Schaefer, Liang Wen, Hartmut Herrmann, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos.

The irradiated clouds clearly showed a gradual activation of seed particles into droplets. In contrast, non-irradiated clouds faced a flash activation. This paper will lay the foundation for multiphase photochemical studies implying water-soluble volatile organic compounds and particulate matter formation during cloud formation-evaporation cycles.\n\nThe Puy de DÃ´me ICe Nucleation Intercomparison Campaign (PICNIC): comparison between online and offline methods in ambient air\n\nLarissa Lacher, Michael P.

Here we compare three cloud chambers and seven methods for collecting aerosol particles on filters for offline analysis at a mountaintop station. A general good agreement of the methods was found when sampling aerosol particles behind a whole air inlet, supporting their use for obtaining data that can be implemented in models.\n\nMicrophysical view of development and ice production of mid-latitude stratocumulus during an extratropical cyclone\n\nYuanmou Du, Dantong Liu, Delong Zhao, Mengyu Huang, Ping Tian, Dian Wen, Wei Xiao, Wei Zhou, Baiwan Pan, Dongfei Zuo, Xiange Liu, Yingying Jing, Rong Zhang, Jiujiang Sheng, Fei Wang, Yu Huang, Yunbo Chen, and Deping Ding\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-314,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-314, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy conducting in-situ measurements of the microphysical properties, we investigated the ice production and phase transformation of stratocumulus during an extratropical cyclone over the North China Plain. We find the key factors in controlling secondary ice production, and the microphysical properties of clouds with convective cells under different stages are elucidated, which will improve the understanding of the key processes in controlling the cloud glaciation and precipitation process.\n\nThe key role of atmospheric absorption in the Asian Summer Monsoon response to dust emissions in CMIP6 models\n\nAlcide Zhao, Laura Wilcox, and Claire Ryder\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3075,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3075, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models include desert dust aerosols, which interact with radiation and can change circulation patterns. We assess the effect of dust on the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons through multi-model experiments where dust emissions are doubled, isolating the effect of dust for the first time. We find that dust results in an enhanced Indian summer monsoon and a southward shift of equatorial rainfall. Our results show the importance of accurate dust representation in climate model.\n\nJet aircraft lubrication oil droplets as contrail ice-forming particles\n\nJoel Ponsonby, Leon King, Benjamin J.

For the first time, we experimentally investigate the freezing behaviour of water droplets formed on jet lubrication oil aerosol. We show that they can activate to form water droplets and discuss their potential impact on contrail formation. Our study has implications for contrails produced by future aircraft engine and fuel technologies.\n\nData supporting the North Atlantic Climate System: Integrated Studies (ACSIS) programme, including atmospheric composition, oceanographic and sea ice observations (2016–2022) and output from ocean, atmosphere, land and sea-ice models (1950–2050)\n\nAlexander T.

Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-481,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-481, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for ESSD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nParticles from deserts and semi-vegetated areas (mineral dust) are important for the Earth climate, and the human health, notably depending on their size. In this paper we collect and made de synthesis of a body of those observations since 1972 in order to provide researchers modelling the Earth climate as well as researchers developing satellite observations from space a simple way of confronting their results and understanding their validity.\n\nFractional solubility of iron in mineral dust aerosols over coastal Namibia: a link to marine biogenic emissions?\n\nKarine Desboeufs, Paola Formenti, Raquel Torres-SÃ¡nchez, Kerstin Schepanski, Jean-Pierre Chaboureau, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Stefanie Feuerstein, Benoit Laurent, Danitza Klopper, Andreas Namwoonde, Mathieu Cazaunau, Servanne Chevaillier, AnaÃ¯s Feron, CÃ©cile Mirande-Bret, Sylvain Triquet, and Stuart J. Piketh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1525–1541, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the fractional solubility of iron (Fe) in dust particles along the coast of Namibia, a critical region for the atmospheric Fe supply of the South Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest a possible two-way interplay whereby marine biogenic emissions from the coastal marine ecosystems into the atmosphere would increase the solubility of Fe-bearing dust by photo-reduction processes. The subsequent deposition of soluble Fe could act to further enhance marine biogenic emissions.\n\nMeasurement report: The ice-nucleating activity of lichen sampled in a northern European boreal forest\n\nUlrike Proske, Michael P. Adams, Grace C. E. Porter, Mark Holden, Jaana BÃ¤ck, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2780,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2780, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce nucleating particles aid freezing of water droplets in clouds and thus modify clouds' properties. During a campaign in the boreal forest in Finland, substantial concentrations of biological ice nucleating particles were observed, despite many of their potential biological sources being snow covered. We sampled lichen in this location and tested its ice nculeation ability in the laboratory. We find that indeed the lichen harbours INPs, which may be important in such snow covered environments.\n\nProminent role of organics in aerosol liquid water content over the south-eastern Atlantic during biomass burning season\n\nLu Zhang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Caroline Dang, Junying Sun, Ye Kuang, and Paola Formenti\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2319,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2319, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study examined the interaction between atmospheric particles and moisture over the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning seasons in Africa. We found that organic components of these particles play a more important role in aerosol-moisture interactions than previously expected. This discovery is important as such interactions impact radiation and climate. Current climate models might need better representations of the moisture-absorbing properties of organic aerosols.\n\nBiomass-burning smoke's properties and its interactions with marine stratocumulus clouds in WRF-CAM5 and southeastern Atlantic field campaigns\n\nCalvin Howes, Pablo E.

The model transports and mixes smoke well but does not fully capture some important processes. These include smoke chemical and physical aging over 4–12 days, smoke removal by rain, sulfate particle formation, aerosol activation into cloud droplets, and boundary layer turbulence.\n\nAircraft ice-nucleating particle and aerosol composition measurements in the western North American Arctic\n\nAlberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Sarah L. Barr, Ian T. Burke, James B. McQuaid, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13819–13834, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13819-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13819-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe sources and concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the Arctic are still poorly understood. Here we report aircraft-based INP concentrations and aerosol composition in the western North American Arctic. The concentrations of INPs and all aerosol particles were low. The aerosol samples contained mostly sea salt and dust particles. Dust particles were more relevant for the INP concentrations than sea salt. However, dust alone cannot account for all of the measured INPs.\n\nAerosol hygroscopicity over the South-East Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season: Part I – From the perspective of scattering enhancement\n\nLu Zhang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Caroline Dang, Junying Sun, Ye Kuang, Paola Formenti, and Steven Howell\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2199,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2199, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing airborne measurements over the South-East Atlantic, our study explored how aerosols—tiny atmospheric particles—interact with moisture over the ocean, especially during the biomass burning season. We noticed unique patterns in their behavior at different altitudes and introduced a predictive model for this moisture interaction. Our results aid our understanding of aerosol-moisture interactions and benefit the research of aerosol radiative effect in this climatically significant region.\n\nAerosol optical depth climatology from the high-resolution MAIAC product over Europe: differences between major European cities and their surrounding environments\n\nLudovico Di Antonio, Claudia Di Biagio, Gilles Foret, Paola Formenti, Guillaume Siour, Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin, and Matthias Beekmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 12455–12475, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12455-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12455-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong-term (2000–2021) 1 km resolution satellite data have been used to investigate the climatological aerosol optical depth (AOD) variability and trends at different scales in Europe. Average enhancements of the local-to-regional AOD ratio at 550 nm of 57 %, 55 %, 39 % and 32 % are found for large metropolitan areas such as Barcelona, Lisbon, Paris and Athens, respectively, suggesting a non-negligible enhancement of the aerosol burden through local emissions.\n\nConcurrent photochemical whitening and darkening of ambient brown carbon\n\nQian Li, Dantong Liu, Xiaotong Jiang, Ping Tian, Yangzhou Wu, Siyuan Li, Kang Hu, Quan Liu, Mengyu Huang, Ruijie Li, Kai Bi, Shaofei Kong, Deping Ding, and Chenjie Yu\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Chem. Phys., 23, 9385–9399, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9385-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9385-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study for the first time found large amounts of liquid–liquid phase separation particles with soot redistributing in organic coatings instead of sulfate cores in the eastern Tibetan Plateau atmosphere. The particle size and the ratio of the organic matter coating thickness to soot size are two of the major possible factors that likely affect the soot redistribution process. The soot redistribution process promoted the morphological compaction of soot particles.\n\nA bin microphysics parcel model investigation of secondary ice formation in an idealised shallow convective cloud\n\nRachel L. James, Jonathan Crosier, and Paul J. Connolly\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9099–9121, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9099-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9099-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSecondary ice production (SIP) may significantly enhance the ice particle concentration in mixed-phase clouds. We present a systematic modelling study of secondary ice formation in idealised shallow convective clouds for various conditions. Our results suggest that the SIP mechanism of collisions of supercooled water drops with more massive ice particles may be a significant ice formation mechanism in shallow convective clouds outside the rime-splintering temperature range (−3 to −8 °C).\n\nPollution slightly enhances atmospheric cooling by low-level clouds in tropical West Africa\n\nValerian Hahn, Ralf MeerkÃ¶tter, Christiane Voigt, Sonja Gisinger, Daniel Sauer, ValÃ©ry Catoire, Volker Dreiling, Hugh Coe, Cyrille Flamant, Stefan Kaufmann, Jonas Kleine, Peter Knippertz, Manuel Moser, Philip Rosenberg, Hans Schlager, Alfons Schwarzenboeck, and Jonathan Taylor\n\nAtmos.

Radiative transfer simulations, based on the measured cloud properties, reveal that these low-level polluted clouds radiate only 2.6 % more energy back to space, compared with a less polluted cloud. The corresponding additional decrease in temperature is rather small.\n\nThermal infrared dust optical depth and coarse-mode effective diameter over oceans retrieved from collocated MODIS and CALIOP observations\n\nJianyu Zheng, Zhibo Zhang, Hongbin Yu, Anne Garnier, Qianqian Song, Chenxi Wang, Claudia Di Biagio, Jasper F.

Our results show that the imaginary part of the complex refractive index of Icelandic dust is at the upper end of the range of low-latitude dust. Furthermore, we observed that Icelandic dust is more absorbing towards the near-infrared, which we attribute to its high magnetite content. These findings are important for modeling dust aerosol radiative effects in the Arctic.\n\nEditorial: Aerosol Research â a new diamond open-access journal covering the breadth of aerosol science and technology\n\nJonas Elm, AladÃ¡r Czitrovszky, Andreas Held, Annele Virtanen, Astrid Kiendler-Scharr, Benjamin J.

They can consist of different chemical species, including crystalline nitric acid hydrates. We found that mineral dust or meteoric ablation material can efficiently catalyse the formation of a specific phase of nitric acid dihydrate crystals. We determined predominant particle shapes and infrared optical properties of these crystals, which are important inputs for remote sensing detection of PSCs.\n\nSimulating organic aerosol in Delhi with WRF-Chem using the volatility-basis-set approach: exploring model uncertainty with a Gaussian process emulator\n\nErnesto Reyes-Villegas, Douglas Lowe, Jill S.

The volatility basis set (VBS) approach, implemented in air quality models such as WRF-Chem, can be a useful tool to describe primary OA (POA) production and aging. However, the main disadvantage is its complexity. We used a Gaussian process simulator to reproduce model results and to estimate the sources of model uncertainty. We do this by comparing the outputs with OA observations made at Delhi, India, in 2018.\n\nImpact of HO2 aerosol uptake on radical levels and O3 production during summertime in Beijing\n\nJoanna E.

In less polluted regions, atmospheric models over-predict HO2 concentrations. In this modelling study, the impact of heterogeneous uptake of HO2 onto aerosol surfaces on radical concentrations and the ozone production regime in Beijing in the summertime is investigated, and the implications for emissions policies across China are considered.\n\nComparison of dust optical depth from multi-sensor products and MONARCH (Multiscale Online Non-hydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry) dust reanalysis over North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe\n\nMichail Mytilinaios, Sara Basart, Sergio Ciamprone, Juan Cuesta, Claudio Dema, Enza Di Tomaso, Paola Formenti, Antonis Gkikas, Oriol Jorba, Ralph Kahn, Carlos PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a-Pando, Serena Trippetta, and Lucia Mona\n\nAtmos.

We assess the performance of the reanalysis needed to reproduce dust optical depth using dust-related products retrieved from satellite and ground-based observations and show that it reproduces the spatial distribution and seasonal variability of atmospheric dust well.\n\nThe importance of acid-processed meteoric smoke relative to meteoric fragments for crystal nucleation in polar stratospheric clouds\n\nAlexander D. James, Finn Pace, Sebastien N. F. Sikora, Graham W. Mann, John M. C. Plane, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We find that material which could fragment on atmospheric entry without melting is unlikely to be present in high enough concentration in the stratosphere to contribute to observed crystalline clouds. Material which ablates completely then forms a new solid known as meteoric smoke can provide enough nucleation to explain observed clouds.\n\nIntercomparison of airborne and surface-based measurements during the CLARIFY, ORACLES and LASIC field experiments\n\nPaul A.

Often measurements take place in isolation, but here we compared data from two aircraft and one ground-based site. This was done in order to understand how well measurements made on one platform compared to those made on another. Whilst this is easy to do in a controlled laboratory setting, it is more challenging in the real world, and so these comparisons are as valuable as they are rare.\n\nMultiyear emissions of carbonaceous aerosols from cooking, fireworks, sacrificial incense, joss paper burning, and barbecue as well as their key driving forces in China\n\nYi Cheng, Shaofei Kong, Liquan Yao, Huang Zheng, Jian Wu, Qin Yan, Shurui Zheng, Yao Hu, Zhenzhen Niu, Yingying Yan, Zhenxing Shen, Guofeng Shen, Dantong Liu, Shuxiao Wang, and Shihua Qi\n\nEarth Syst.

Our results suggest a northern HLD belt at 50–58Â° N in Eurasia and 50–55Â° N in Canada and at >60Â° N in Eurasia and >58Â° N in Canada. Our addition to the previously identified global dust belt (GDB) provides crucially needed information on the extent of active HLD sources with both direct and indirect impacts on climate and environment in remote regions, which are often poorly understood and predicted.\n\nBelow-cloud scavenging of aerosol by rain: a review of numerical modelling approaches and sensitivity simulations with mineral dust in the Met Office's Unified Model\n\nAnthony C.

Many different BCS schemes are available to climate models, and it is unclear what the impact of selecting one scheme over another is. Here, various BCS models are outlined and then applied to mineral dust in climate model simulations. We find that dust concentrations are highly sensitive to the BCS scheme, with dust atmospheric lifetimes ranging from 5 to 44 d.\n\nSensitivity analysis of an aerosol-aware microphysics scheme in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) during case studies of fog in Namibia\n\nMichael John Weston, Stuart John Piketh, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Burnet, Stephen Broccardo, Cyrielle Denjean, Thierry Bourrianne, and Paola Formenti\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 22, 10221–10245, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10221-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10221-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn aerosol-aware microphysics scheme is evaluated for fog cases in Namibia. AEROCLO-sA campaign observations are used to access and parameterise the model. The model cloud condensation nuclei activation is lower than the observations. The scheme is designed for clouds with updrafts, while fog typically forms in stable conditions. A pseudo updraft speed assigned to the lowest model levels helps achieve more realistic cloud droplet number concentration and size distribution in the model.\n\nThe ice-nucleating activity of African mineral dust in the Caribbean boundary layer\n\nAlexander D. Harrison, Daniel O'Sullivan, Michael P. Adams, Grace C. E. Porter, Edmund Blades, Cherise Brathwaite, Rebecca Chewitt-Lucas, Cassandra Gaston, Rachel Hawker, Ovid O. KrÃ¼ger, Leslie Neve, Mira L. PÃ¶hlker, Christopher PÃ¶hlker, Ulrich PÃ¶schl, Alberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Andrea Sealy, Peter Sealy, Mark D. Tarn, Shanice Whitehall, James B. McQuaid, Kenneth S. Carslaw, Joseph M. Prospero, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9663–9680, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9663-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9663-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe formation of ice in clouds fundamentally alters cloud properties; hence it is important we understand the special aerosol particles that can nucleate ice when immersed in supercooled cloud droplets. In this paper we show that African desert dust that has travelled across the Atlantic to the Caribbean nucleates ice much less well than we might have expected.\n\nBiomass burning and marine aerosol processing over the southeast Atlantic Ocean: a TEM single-particle analysis\n\nCaroline Dang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Lu Zhang, Paola Formenti, Jonathan Taylor, Amie Dobracki, Sara Purdue, Pui-Shan Wong, Athanasios Nenes, Arthur Sedlacek III, Hugh Coe, Jens Redemann, Paquita Zuidema, Steven Howell, and James Haywood\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9389–9412, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9389-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9389-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTransmission electron microscopy was used to analyze aged African smoke particles and how the smoke interacts with the marine atmosphere. We found that the volatility of organic aerosol increases with biomass burning plume age, that black carbon is often mixed with potassium salts and that the marine atmosphere can incorporate Na and Cl into smoke particles. Marine salts are more processed when mixed with smoke plumes, and there are interesting Cl-rich yet Na-absent marine particles.\n\nLight absorption by brown carbon over the South-East Atlantic Ocean\n\nLu Zhang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Caroline Dang, Arthur J. Sedlacek III, Ernie R. Lewis, Amie Dobracki, Jenny P. S. Wong, Paola Formenti, Steven G. Howell, and Athanasios Nenes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9199–9213, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9199-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9199-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWidespread biomass burning (BB) events occur annually in Africa and contribute ~ 1 / 3 of global BB emissions, which contain a large family of light-absorbing organics, known as brown carbon (BrC), whose absorption of incident radiation is difficult to estimate, leading to large uncertainties in the global radiative forcing estimation. This study quantifies the BrC absorption of aged BB particles and highlights the potential presence of absorbing iron oxides in this climatically important region.\n\nThe MONARCH high-resolution reanalysis of desert dust aerosol over Northern Africa, the Middle East and Europe (2007â2016)\n\nEnza Di Tomaso, JerÃ³nimo Escribano, Sara Basart, Paul Ginoux, Francesca Macchia, Francesca Barnaba, Francesco Benincasa, Pierre-Antoine BretonniÃ¨re, Arnau BuÃ±uel, Miguel Castrillo, Emilio Cuevas, Paola Formenti, MarÃ­a GonÃ§alves, Oriol Jorba, Martina Klose, Lucia Mona, Gilbert MontanÃ© Pinto, Michail Mytilinaios, Vincenzo Obiso, Miriam Olid, Nick Schutgens, Athanasios Votsis, Ernest Werner, and Carlos PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a-Pando\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 2785–2816, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2785-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2785-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMONARCH reanalysis of desert dust aerosols extends the existing observation-based information for mineral dust monitoring by providing 3-hourly upper-air, surface and total column key geophysical variables of the dust cycle over Northern Africa, the Middle East and Europe, at a 0.1° horizontal resolution in a rotated grid, from 2007 to 2016. This work provides evidence of the high accuracy of this data set and its suitability for air quality and health and climate service applications.\n\nEvolution of source attributed organic aerosols and gases in a megacity of central China\n\nSiyuan Li, Dantong Liu, Shaofei Kong, Yangzhou Wu, Kang Hu, Huang Zheng, Yi Cheng, Shurui Zheng, Xiaotong Jiang, Shuo Ding, Dawei Hu, Quan Liu, Ping Tian, Delong Zhao, and Jiujiang Sheng\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 6937–6951, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-6937-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-6937-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe understanding of secondary organic aerosols is hindered by the aerosol–gas evolution by different oxidation mechanisms. By concurrently measuring detailed mass spectra of aerosol and gas phases in a megacity online, we identified the primary and secondary source sectors and investigated the transformation between gas and aerosol phases influenced by photooxidation and moisture. The results will help us to understand the respective evolution of major sources in a typical urban environment.\n\nAn evaluation of the heat test for the ice-nucleating ability of minerals and biological material\n\nMartin I. Daily, Mark D. Tarn, Thomas F. Whale, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 2635–2665, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2635-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2635-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMineral dust and particles of biological origin are important types of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) that can trigger ice formation of supercooled cloud droplets. Heat treatments are used to detect the presence of biological INPs in samples collected from the environment as the activity of mineral INPs is assumed unchanged, although not fully assessed. We show that the ice-nucleating ability of some minerals can change after heating and discuss how INP heat tests should be interpreted.\n\nSmoke in the river: an Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) case study\n\nCyrille Flamant, Marco Gaetani, Jean-Pierre Chaboureau, Patrick Chazette, Juan Cuesta, Stuart John Piketh, and Paola Formenti\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 5701–5724, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-5701-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-5701-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRivers of smoke extend from tropical southern Africa towards the Indian Ocean during the winter fire season, controlled by the interaction of tropical easterly waves, and westerly waves at mid latitudes. During the AEROCLO-sA field campaign in 2017, a river of smoke was directly observed over Namibia. In this paper, the evolution and atmospheric drivers of the river of smoke are described, and the role of a mid-latitude cut-off low in lifting the smoke to the upper troposphere is highlighted.\n\nMeasurement report: Introduction to the HyICE-2018 campaign for measurements of ice-nucleating particles and instrument inter-comparison in the HyytiÃ¤lÃ¤ boreal forest\n\nZoÃ© Brasseur, Dimitri CastarÃ¨de, Erik S.

We provide an overview of the campaign settings, and we describe the measurement infrastructure and operating procedures used. In addition, we use results from ice nucleation instrument inter-comparison to show that the suite of these instruments deployed during the campaign reports consistent results.\n\nAerodynamic size-resolved composition and cloud condensation nuclei properties of aerosols in a Beijing suburban region\n\nChenjie Yu, Dantong Liu, Kang Hu, Ping Tian, Yangzhou Wu, Delong Zhao, Huihui Wu, Dawei Hu, Wenbo Guo, Qiang Li, Mengyu Huang, Deping Ding, and James D. Allan\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions and CCN activation measurement enable a detailed analysis of BC-containing particle hygroscopicity and its size-dependent contribution to the CCN activation. The results presented in this study will affect future models and human health studies.\n\nThe 2019 Raikoke volcanic eruption â Part 2: Particle-phase dispersion and concurrent wildfire smoke emissions\n\nMartin J. Osborne, Johannes de Leeuw, Claire Witham, Anja Schmidt, Frances Beckett, Nina Kristiansen, Joelle Buxmann, Cameron Saint, Ellsworth J. Welton, Javier Fochesatto, Ana R. Gomes, Ulrich Bundke, Andreas Petzold, Franco Marenco, and Jim Haywood\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2975–2997, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2975-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2975-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing the Met Office NAME dispersion model, supported by satellite- and ground-based remote-sensing observations, we describe the dispersion of aerosols from the 2019 Raikoke eruption and the concurrent wildfires in Alberta Canada. We show how the synergy of dispersion modelling and multiple observation sources allowed observers in the London VAAC to arrive at a more complete picture of the aerosol loading at altitudes commonly used by aviation.\n\nThe effect of BC on aerosolâboundary layer feedback: potential implications for urban pollution episodes\n\nJessica Slater, Hugh Coe, Gordon McFiggans, Juha Tonttila, and Sami Romakkaniemi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2937–2953, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2937-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2937-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper shows the specific impact of black carbon (BC) on the aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) feedback and its influence on a Beijing haze episode. Overall, this paper shows that strong temperature inversions prevent BC heating within the PBL from significantly increasing PBL height, while BC above the PBL suppresses PBL development significantly through the day. From this we suggest a method by which both locally and regionally emitted BC may impact urban pollution episodes.\n\nHigh concentrations of ice crystals in upper-tropospheric tropical clouds: is there a link to biomass and fossil fuel combustion?\n\nGraciela B. Raga, Darrel Baumgardner, Blanca Rios, Yanet DÃ­az-Esteban, Alejandro Jaramillo, Martin Gallagher, Bastien Sauvage, Pawel Wolff, and Gary Lloyd\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2269–2292, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2269-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2269-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) is a small fleet of commercial aircraft that carry a suite of meteorological, gas, aerosol, and cloud sensors and have been measuring worldwide for almost 9 years, since late 2011. Extreme ice events (EIEs) have been identified from the IAGOS cloud measurements and linked to surface emissions for biomass and fossil fuel consumption. The results reported here are highly relevant for climate change and flight operations forecasting.\n\nHow well do the CMIP6 models simulate dust aerosols?\n\nAlcide Zhao, Claire L. Ryder, and Laura J. Wilcox\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2095–2119, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2095-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2095-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe CMIP6 models' simulated dust processes are getting more uncertain as models become more sophisticated. Of particular challenge are the links between dust cycles and optical properties, and we recommend more detailed output relating to dust cycles in future intercomparison projects to constrain such links. Also, models struggle to capture certain key regional dust processes such as dust accumulation along the slope of the Himalayas and dust seasonal cycles in North China and North America.\n\nMeasurements of ice crystal fluxes from the surface at a mountain top site\n\nWaldemar Schledewitch, Gary Lloyd, Keith Bower, Thomas Choularton, Michael Flynn, and Martin Gallagher\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-69,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-69, 2022\n\nPublication in ACP not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce crystals on the surface of ice and snow covered terrain are thought to be transported into clouds that cover the surface. This has important implications for the properties of clouds in these regions. This research measured the potential transport of surface based ice crystals into the surrounding clouds at a mountain top site.\n\nSynergistic radar and sub-millimeter radiometer retrievals of ice hydrometeors in mid-latitude frontal cloud systems\n\nSimon Pfreundschuh, Stuart Fox, Patrick Eriksson, David Duncan, Stefan A. Buehler, Manfred Brath, Richard Cotton, and Florian Ewald\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 677–699, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-677-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-677-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe test a novel method to remotely measure ice particles in clouds. This is important because such measurements are required to improve climate and weather models. The method combines a radar with newly developed sensors measuring microwave radiation at very short wavelengths. We use observations made from aircraft flying above the cloud and compare them to real measurements from inside the cloud. This works well given that one can model the ice particles in the cloud sufficiently well.\n\nMulti-thermals and high concentrations of secondary ice: a modelling study of convective clouds during the Ice in Clouds Experiment â Dust (ICE-D) campaign\n\nZhiqiang Cui, Alan Blyth, Yahui Huang, Gary Lloyd, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Paul Field, Rachel Hawker, and Lindsay Bennett\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1649–1667, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh concentrations of ice particles were observed at temperatures greater than about –8 C. The default scheme of the secondary ice production cannot explain the high concentrations. Relaxing the conditions for secondary ice production or considering dust aerosol alone is insufficient to produce the observed amount of ice particles. It is likely that multi-thermals play an important role in producing very high concentrations of secondary ice particles in some tropical clouds.\n\nLook−up tables resolved by complex refractive index to correct particle sizes measured by common research−grade optical particle counters\n\nPaola Formenti, Claudia Di Biagio, Yue Huang, Jasper Kok, Marc Daniel Mallet, Damien Boulanger, and Mathieu Cazaunau\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2021-403,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2021-403, 2021\n\nPublication in AMT not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper provides with standardized correction factors for the measurements of the most common instruments used in the atmosphere to measure the concentration per size of aerosol particles. These correction factors are provided to users with supplementary information for their use.\n\nModel emulation to understand the joint effects of ice-nucleating particles and secondary ice production on deep convective anvil cirrus\n\nRachel E. Hawker, Annette K. Miltenberger, Jill S. Johnson, Jonathan M. Wilkinson, Adrian A. Hill, Ben J. Shipway, Paul R. Field, Benjamin J. Murray, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 17315–17343, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe find that ice-nucleating particles (INPs), aerosols that can initiate the freezing of cloud droplets, cause substantial changes to the properties of radiatively important convectively generated anvil cirrus. The number concentration of INPs had a large effect on ice crystal number concentration while the INP temperature dependence controlled ice crystal size and cloud fraction. The results indicate information on INP number and source is necessary for the representation of cloud glaciation.\n\nA weather regime characterisation of winter biomass aerosol transport from southern Africa\n\nMarco Gaetani, Benjamin Pohl, Maria del Carmen Alvarez Castro, Cyrille Flamant, and Paola Formenti\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16575–16591, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16575-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16575-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring the dry austral winter, biomass fires in tropical Africa emit large amounts of smoke in the atmosphere, with large impacts on climate and air quality. The study of the relationship between atmospheric circulation and smoke transport shows that midlatitude atmospheric disturbances may deflect the smoke from tropical Africa towards southern Africa. Understanding the distribution of the smoke in the region is crucial for climate modelling and air quality monitoring.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties of black carbon and organic matter from different combustion and photochemical sources using aerodynamic aerosol classification\n\nDawei Hu, M.

These have allowed us to quantify the changes in shape and chemical composition of different soots according to source and variables such as the moisture content of wood.\n\nControls on surface aerosol particle number concentrations and aerosol-limited cloud regimes over the central Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nHeather Guy, Ian M. Brooks, Ken S. Carslaw, Benjamin J. Murray, Von P. Walden, Matthew D. Shupe, Claire Pettersen, David D. Turner, Christopher J. Cox, William D. Neff, Ralf Bennartz, and Ryan R. Neely III\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15351–15374, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15351-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15351-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the first full year of surface aerosol number concentration measurements from the central Greenland Ice Sheet. Aerosol concentrations here have a distinct seasonal cycle from those at lower-altitude Arctic sites, which is driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Our results can be used to help understand the role aerosols might play in Greenland surface melt through the modification of cloud properties. This is crucial in a rapidly changing region where observations are sparse.\n\nReduced volatility of aerosols from surface emissions to the top of the planetary boundary layer\n\nQuan Liu, Dantong Liu, Yangzhou Wu, Kai Bi, Wenkang Gao, Ping Tian, Delong Zhao, Siyuan Li, Chenjie Yu, Guiqian Tang, Yunfei Wu, Kang Hu, Shuo Ding, Qian Gao, Fei Wang, Shaofei Kong, Hui He, Mengyu Huang, and Deping Ding\n\nAtmos.

The results show that, from surface to the top of the planetary boundary layer, the oxidation state of organic aerosol had been significantly enhanced due to evaporation and further oxidation of these evaporated gases.\n\nHeterogeneous ice nucleation ability of aerosol particles generated from Arctic sea surface microlayer and surface seawater samples at cirrus temperatures\n\nRobert Wagner, Luisa Ickes, Allan K.
