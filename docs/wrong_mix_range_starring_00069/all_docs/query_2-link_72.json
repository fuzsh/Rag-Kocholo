Whenever he had some rashes or rough lips or anything else, his mother would always put a dab of Nivea cream on the affected area.\n\nAt the age of 17, he started modelling and achieved the stardom of a supermodel by the age of 20.\n\nHis wife Mehr was also a supermodel of 90s and was the winner of the Femina Miss India in 1986.\n\nDuring his struggle as a model, Fashion designer Rohit Bal met him at an industry party and was so much impressed by his looks that he helped Arjun to establish his career as a famous model.\n\nIn 1994, he became the “Society’s Face Of The Year.”\n\nHe is the cousin of Bollywood actress, Kim Sharma.\n\nIn his debut Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat, he was first offered the role of Aftab Shivdasani, but when Bobby Deol denied his role, the role went to Arjun. His performance was critically acclaimed by the audience.\n\nArjun’s performance in the film Don was a turning point in his acting life; as before he had many flops in a row.\n\nHe set up his own production company named “Chasing Ganesha Films” and his first film under this banner was “I See You”, in which he played the lead role.\n\nFor his film Rock On!!, he was trained under Chandresh from the band ‘Dream out Loud’. He also told that he used to play the guitar on a tennis racket prior to learning it properly for the movie. His performance in this movie is considered one of his best performances in the film industry.\n\nHe denied to play the negative role in the film “Om Shanti Om” because he thought that his part was too evil, but later Shah Rukh Khan convinced him and he agreed.\n\nHe is an avid animal lover and also supports PETA.\n\nHe was the first choice for the role of Karan in the film Lakshya, but due to the shortage of shooting dates, the role went to Hrithik Roshan.\n\nHe is a fitness freak.\n\nIn 2012, he launched his signature fragrance collection, Alive.\n\nHe is the co-owner of a nightclub, Lap in Mumbai where sometimes he plays as a DJ.\n\nArjun always carries a camera, along with him, whenever he goes on a shoot; he loves being clicked during a shoot.\n\nIn 2017, he played the role of Mumbai’s gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli in the film Daddy.\n\nOn 28 May 2018, he and his wife Mehr declared their mutual separation in a joint statement.\n\nHe was #1 in the Times 50 Most Desirable Men of 2012 with 7.01 lakh votes received online.\n\nOn 19 November 2019, Arjun Rampal ended his 21-year-long marriage with Mehr Jesia legally, after a family court in Bandra granted them divorce by mutual consent."
