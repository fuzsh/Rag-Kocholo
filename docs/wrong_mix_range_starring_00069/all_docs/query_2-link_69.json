Why was she ever given any roles?\n\nShe was always unpleasant to watch.\n\n9. Ernest Borgnine. Another one who almost always played\n\nan unpleasant character. EXCEPTION: As the voice of\n\n\"Mermaid Man\" on Spongebob Squarepants. His best role.\n\n8. Charlton Heston. Wooden, dull, ponderous.\n\n7. Jack Nicholson. Just a walking self-parody. Hasn't had\n\na good part since Chinatown.\n\n6. Al Pacino. Not really a bad actor, but directors allow\n\nhim far too much leeway and he just chews up the scenery\n\nand spits out pap. Scarface: Laughably horrible or\n\nhorribly laughable? Scent of a Woman: \"Hooah\" is the\n\nsound of someone vomiting as he watches this one.\n\n5. Marlon Brando. His only good role was as Vito\n\nCorleone; everything else was self-absorbed, pretentious\n\ncrap.\n\n4. Robert De Niro. Plays the same character over and\n\nover, just doesn't realize it. Last good role was Vito\n\nCorleone... hmmm.\n\n3. Julia Roberts. She's not actually a bad actress, but\n\npretty she ain't! She is one of the homeliest women in\n\nHollywood. BEST ROLE: Alice Sutton in Conspiracy Theory.\n\n2. Jack Lemmon. Used to be first on my list. I am still\n\nagog when this guy is spoken of so highly. If you were\n\nwatching a Jack Lemmon movie, you could be sure at least\n\none character (his) would be supremely annoying and\n\nunfunny, especially in his incredibly depressing so-\n\ncalled \"comedies\". Just want to heave a brick through the\n\nscreen anytime he's on it. EXCEPTION: His role as Jack\n\nGodell in China Syndrome was the best part of the movie.\n\n1. Johnny Depp. Why does anyone hire this guy? This rat-\n\nfaced little creep couldn't act himself out of a\n\nrestaurant that just served him a deep-fried kitten with\n\na fly on it. As for his part in Chocolat, he was\n\nobviously only in it to provide the de rigueur American\n\npresence so it could play in the U.S.A. Almost ANYONE\n\nelse would have been better in the part. A cardboard\n\ncutout (not even necessarily life-size) would have been\n\nat least as good. Was his ludicrous slurring in Pirates\n\nof the Caribbean supposed to be an \"accent\"? BEST ROLE:\n\nMort Rainey in \"Secret Window\". Not a great movie, and\n\nterrible hairdo, but he wasn't actually too bad in this\n\none.\n\nhttp://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.14413\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nI disagree about DeNiro. But Meryl Streep deserves to be\n\n#1.

Barbara Stanwyck. Why was she ever given any roles?\n\nShe was always unpleasant to watch.\n\nA strong actress and easy enough on my eyes.\n\n9. Ernest Borgnine. Another one who almost always played\n\nan unpleasant character. EXCEPTION: As the voice of\n\n\"Mermaid Man\" on Spongebob Squarepants. His best role.\n\nHe played a lot of sympathetic characters as well (like MARTY and\n\nMCHALE), but he was peerless as a brutish villain (esp. in FROM HERE TO\n\nETERNITY and EMPORER OF THE NORTH POLE).\n\n8. Charlton Heston. Wooden, dull, ponderous.\n\nA great actor -- Lutique's confusing \"dullness\" with inner strength.\n\n7. Jack Nicholson. Just a walking self-parody. Hasn't had\n\na good part since Chinatown.\n\nCHINATOWN stunk.\n\nNicholson livened up LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and gave his best\n\nperformance in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. But on the whole, I\n\nhave to agree that he's been playing a parody of a Jack Nicholson\n\ncharacter for .... decades.\n\n6. Al Pacino. Not really a bad actor, but directors allow\n\nhim far too much leeway and he just chews up the scenery\n\nand spits out pap. Scarface: Laughably horrible or\n\nhorribly laughable? Scent of a Woman: \"Hooah\" is the\n\nsound of someone vomiting as he watches this one.\n\nAl Pacino is unwatchably bad. I've never seen anything by him that I\n\ndidn't hate.\n\n5. Marlon Brando. His only good role was as Vito\n\nCorleone; everything else was self-absorbed, pretentious\n\ncrap.\n\nBrando turned in some great performances in THE MEN, THE WILD ONE, THE\n\nFUGITIVE KIND, THE NIGHT COMERS, THE MISSOURI BREAKS and APOCALYPSE\n\nNOW. He could also be pretentious, but he's got enough strong roles\n\nbehind him warrant his great actor status.\n\n4. Robert De Niro. Plays the same character over and\n\nover, just doesn't realize it. Last good role was Vito\n\nCorleone... hmmm.\n\nAgreed -- except that I don't think much about THE GODFATHER either.\n\n3. Julia Roberts. She's not actually a bad actress, but\n\npretty she ain't! She is one of the homeliest women in\n\nHollywood. BEST ROLE: Alice Sutton in Conspiracy Theory.\n\nI've never seen the attraction to her either. I wouldn't call her\n\n\"homely\" -- just plain.\n\n2. Jack Lemmon. Used to be first on my list. I am still\n\nagog when this guy is spoken of so highly. If you were\n\nwatching a Jack Lemmon movie, you could be sure at least\n\none character (his) would be supremely annoying and\n\nunfunny, especially in his incredibly depressing so-\n\ncalled \"comedies\". Just want to heave a brick through the\n\nscreen anytime he's on it. EXCEPTION: His role as Jack\n\nGodell in China Syndrome was the best part of the movie.\n\nJack Lemmon would be counted among the greats if the only thing he'd\n\never done was Ens. Frank Th. Pulver in MISTER ROBERTS. He's had a lot\n\nof other good roles as well (BELL BOOK AND CANDLE, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH,\n\nDAYS OF WINE AND ROSES, THE ODD COUPLE).\n\nHis solo comedy efforts from the later 60s and 70s could be on the\n\ndepressing side, and I've always felt that he worked best as a\n\nsupporting actor (and he always stole the show when he did).\n\n1. Johnny Depp. Why does anyone hire this guy? This rat-\n\nfaced little creep couldn't act himself out of a\n\nrestaurant that just served him a deep-fried kitten with\n\na fly on it. As for his part in Chocolat, he was\n\nobviously only in it to provide the de rigueur American\n\npresence so it could play in the U.S.A. Almost ANYONE\n\nelse would have been better in the part. A cardboard\n\ncutout (not even necessarily life-size) would have been\n\nat least as good. Was his ludicrous slurring in Pirates\n\nof the Caribbean supposed to be an \"accent\"? BEST ROLE:\n\nMort Rainey in \"Secret Window\". Not a great movie, and\n\nterrible hairdo, but he wasn't actually too bad in this\n\none.\n\nHe was likeable enough as Ed Wood, and treated the late filmmaker with\n\nsome degree of respect. Unfortunately his offscreen personality is\n\nenough to put him on anybody's hate list (anyone who isn't French, that\n\nis).\n\nm***@aol.com\n\nPost by Dr. Jai Maharaj\n\n3. Julia Roberts. She's not actually a bad actress, but\n\npretty she ain't! She is one of the homeliest women in\n\nHollywood. BEST ROLE: Alice Sutton in Conspiracy Theory.\n\nI've never seen the attraction to her either. I wouldn't call her\n\n\"homely\" -- just plain.\n\nYet she routinely makes the People Magazine 50 most beautiful people\n\nlist, and usually winds up on the cover. I would guess she has been on\n\nmore People magazine covers over the past 15 years than any other\n\nHollywood personality. Get her some Alpo, please.\n\nW. Lydecker\n\nStanwyck overrated?

Barbara Stanwyck. Why was she ever given any roles?\n\nShe was always unpleasant to watch.\n\n9. Ernest Borgnine. Another one who almost always played\n\nan unpleasant character. EXCEPTION: As the voice of\n\n\"Mermaid Man\" on Spongebob Squarepants. His best role.\n\n8. Charlton Heston. Wooden, dull, ponderous.\n\n7. Jack Nicholson. Just a walking self-parody. Hasn't had\n\na good part since Chinatown.\n\n6. Al Pacino. Not really a bad actor, but directors allow\n\nhim far too much leeway and he just chews up the scenery\n\nand spits out pap. Scarface: Laughably horrible or\n\nhorribly laughable? Scent of a Woman: \"Hooah\" is the\n\nsound of someone vomiting as he watches this one.\n\n5. Marlon Brando. His only good role was as Vito\n\nCorleone; everything else was self-absorbed, pretentious\n\ncrap.\n\n4. Robert De Niro. Plays the same character over and\n\nover, just doesn't realize it. Last good role was Vito\n\nCorleone... hmmm.\n\n3. Julia Roberts. She's not actually a bad actress, but\n\npretty she ain't! She is one of the homeliest women in\n\nHollywood. BEST ROLE: Alice Sutton in Conspiracy Theory.\n\n2. Jack Lemmon. Used to be first on my list. I am still\n\nagog when this guy is spoken of so highly. If you were\n\nwatching a Jack Lemmon movie, you could be sure at least\n\none character (his) would be supremely annoying and\n\nunfunny, especially in his incredibly depressing so-\n\ncalled \"comedies\". Just want to heave a brick through the\n\nscreen anytime he's on it. EXCEPTION: His role as Jack\n\nGodell in China Syndrome was the best part of the movie.\n\n1. Johnny Depp. Why does anyone hire this guy? This rat-\n\nfaced little creep couldn't act himself out of a\n\nrestaurant that just served him a deep-fried kitten with\n\na fly on it. As for his part in Chocolat, he was\n\nobviously only in it to provide the de rigueur American\n\npresence so it could play in the U.S.A. Almost ANYONE\n\nelse would have been better in the part. A cardboard\n\ncutout (not even necessarily life-size) would have been\n\nat least as good. Was his ludicrous slurring in Pirates\n\nMort Rainey in \"Secret Window\". Not a great movie, and\n\nterrible hairdo, but he wasn't actually too bad in this\n\none.\n\nhttp://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.14413\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nI disagree about DeNiro. But Meryl Streep deserves to be\n\n#1. She stunk in everything except the Deer Hunter, IMO.\n\nPosted on 2/04/2005 6:16:56 AM PST by pissant\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nEnd of forwarded message\n\nJai Maharaj\n\nhttp://www.mantra.com/jai\n\nOm Shanti\n\nHindu Holocaust Museum\n\nhttp://www.mantra.com/holocaust\n\nHindu life, principles, spirituality and philosophy\n\nhttp://www.hindu.org\n\nhttp://www.hindunet.org\n\nThe truth about Islam and Muslims\n\nhttp://www.flex.com/~jai/satyamevajayate\n\n\"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not so send\n\npeace, but a sword.\n\n\"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the\n\ndaughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in\n\nlaw.\n\n\"And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\n\n- Matthew 10:34-36.\n\no Not for commercial use.
