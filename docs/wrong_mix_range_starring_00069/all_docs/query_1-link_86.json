Before the German invasion of Russia in June 1941 and the Allied occupation of Iran in August 1941, Germany not only maintained active commercial exchanges with Iran, but was also engaged in industrial construction work, some of which involvedthe transit of goods through Soviet Russia and brought German technicians close to the Soviet-Iranian border, The Soviets tried to hinder German-Iranian trade and to slow down the shipment of Iranian exports to Germany, presumably 1.-?:?\"cp, they suspected that thce activities prrwirig.r1 e-rwpr for the Mc.* During this pre-occupation period the following German intelligence operatives were using commercial cover in Iran: frill ALLARDT Dr, fnu TISMER fnu WOEHPL fnu KTTNDERT Dr. P-aul LEvERKuEHN, 1 2..

Iraq was the Arab nationoon which the GIS expended the most effort and met with the most willing response. As a leading oil producer Iraq was a natural primary target even before the Second World War and, helped by ties which had been developed during the First World War, the GIS began building up contac:s there in the early 1930's. Since 1939, Iraq was the spiritual center of the Pan-Arab nationalist movement, not only because Iraqis themselves were ardent supporters of the movement, but also because many radical Arab nationalists had fled there. This added to the country's attractiveness as a GIS target. 2. A German archeological expedition began excavations at Warka in 1931. In 1941, Professor Dr. Adam FALKENSTEIN, Helmut BOHTZ, Dr. Ernst HEINRICH, and Dr. Heinz LENZEN, who had participated in that expedition were suggested for intelligence work in the area. Docu- ments show that some members of this team were recruited but fail to indicate their spec*f=tc names and their mission. Other German nationals active in Baghdad were teachers at local schools, including Dr. (fnu) HUOBER, Professor Dr. (fnu) JORDAN, leader of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) group in Baghdad, and Dr. Gustav HAT SCHEK, an eye surgeon in Mosul. 3.

At GROBI3A's suggestion, the GIS approached Ahmet Veil Bey MENGER (see Chapter on Turkey), who was then in Berlin, and requested his assistance in shipping arms through Turkey with a Slovak firm as intermediary. MENGER felt that the shipment could be accomplished by using his contacts in Turkey and by drawing upon the experience of Abdul Asis MUWAFFAQ, brother-in law of Iracli Minister of Finance Nadi i MUWAFFAQ, who had been the Iraqi Charge d'Affaires in Paris at the time of the Spanish Civil War, had smuggled arms to Spain from France. At the time this plan was being worked out GIS assets in Iraq (besides the above mentioned HADDAD) consisted of a very small hase in Baghdad Leaded by (fnu) EBERT, assisted by w/t operator (fnu) FRANK. Von HENTIG in Syria and the GIS bases in Teheran and Tabriz were expected to provide support to the Baghdad base3.

Fieldmarshal Erwin ROMMEL's successes in Egypt inspired a temporary renewal of Iraqi nationalist activities which were, however, quelled in July 1942, when the British arrested the Governor of Baghdad, Galal KHALED; Police Commander Abulla AUNI; lawer Rafael BATTI; ex-commander of Kirkuk Kazem MAKSUD; and a number of other promi- nent Iraqis. As in other Arab countries, ever-increasing German military reversals resulted in a sharp decline in sympathizers and usable contacts in Iraq, which in turn necessitated a drastic curtailment of GIS activity. This state of affairs, conveniently played up by overt and covert Allied propaganda encouraged Premier Nuri AL-SAID to declare war on the Axis powers7. 11. In October 1943, most Arab GIS agent were expelled from Turkey. Following this, there is no record in GFM files of further GIS operations in iraq8.
