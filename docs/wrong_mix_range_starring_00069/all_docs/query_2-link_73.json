They are designed to get peopleâ€™s attention and to make them want to find out more about the film. They are always in the style of the film and normally include the tagline, starring actors and the title of the film.\n\n3. TV INTERVIEWS Another way that the film industry promote their film is by booking lots of talk shows and interviews for the stars to go on in order to make the movie well known. In America stars go on shows such as Saturday Night Live, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Late Late Show with James Cordon. In the UK stars are normally interviewed on shows such as The Graham Norton Show, Alan Carr: Chatty Man and The Jonathan Ross Show. This gets the film out to the wider audience and makes the film well known, before it has come out.\n\n4. Billboards Billboards are used by most films as a way to get the films out to the general population. They are normally in a place with a high amount of traffic meaning that they get seen by as many people as possible. This gives the film more exposure, they have to be eye catching and get the message across in a matter of seconds."
