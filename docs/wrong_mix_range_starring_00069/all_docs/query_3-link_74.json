        "text": "Veteran actor Manoj Kumar is seeking damages over certain scenes in Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s 2007 film Om Shanti Om.\n\nNew Delhi: Veteran actor Manoj Kumar filed a lawsuit against superstar Shah Rukh Khan and film producers Eros International in a Mumbai court today. Manoj Kumar is seeking damages over certain scenes in 2007 film Om Shanti Om, which lampooned him. The film was recently released in Japan with the scenes intact.\n\nThe magistrate's order is expected on April 6.\n\n\"The film was released in Japan without deleting those scenes. I had forgiven them twice but not this time. They have disrespected me. They also face contempt of court as in 2008 the court had asked them to forever and from all prints and broadcast material, delete those scenes,\" Manoj Kumar told PTI earlier.\n\n\"I would file civil and criminal proceedings against the producers (Shah Rukh Khan and Eros International) for seeking damages to the tune of Rs 100 crore for showing Om Shanti Om in Japan without removing objectionable scenes as ordered by Mumbai civil court in 2008\", the actor said.\n\nMr Kumar also said that he has no hard feelings for Shah Rukh Khan but that he could not ignore an insult. He told PTI, \"I don't have any personal clash with Shah Rukh Khan. He is a nice person, but when it comes to my self-respect, then I can't compromise on it.\"\n\nManoj Kumar, star of films like Upkar and Purab Aur Paschim, took the producers of the film to court in 2008 over the scenes that spoofed him in Om Shanti Om.The court had asked the makers to remove all the scenes that were found distasteful by the actor from all the prints as well as broadcast material forever.\n\nOm Shanti Om, a 2007 musical romcom had Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone in the lead. It was produced by Shah Rukh Khan and Eros International and directed by Farah Khan.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
