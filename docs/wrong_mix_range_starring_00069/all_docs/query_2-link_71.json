My room mates were studying at NYU film school. They used to give\n\nme their scripts to read. I would read and give them my ideas. So I became a script doctor and it\n\neven earned me some pocket money. It was then that I realized I enjoyed doing this and maybe\n\nI should come back to New York and study film making. But Ashok Mehta had already offered me\n\nMoksh. Shekhar Kapoor (film maker) was also very insistent that I do it. So when I came back to\n\nIndia the first person who called me was ironically Ashok Mehta.\"\n\n\"I don’t think they were accidents. I believe in destiny – certain things are predestined. When they\n\ncome along you have to be aware enough to see them. Most things that I have believed in life have\n\ncome true. I believe in energies and that’s the kind of energies you attract. I don’t know how I became\n\nan actor. A boy born in Jabalpur, brought up in Nasik, comes to Mumbai and has the opportunity to\n\nwork with the biggest stars and the biggest movies …it must be predestined.\"\n\n\"I think you should be a part of a different kind of cinema as long as you have conviction in it and you\n\ncan believe in it. I would like to be a part of comedy, provided I think it is very funny. The films, which\n\nI chose, are the films, which I would like to watch...\"\n\n\"I see myself evolving from film to film. It is good to be in that space. I am enjoying that part...\"\n\n\"I look at what's my scene and part. I need to see what is the starting point of my character and where\n\ndoes he reaches. If I can identify with the journey, then I go ahead. This is for all films...\"\n\n\"It is about the film - what is the director trying to say and if he is able to do this without the film\n\nbecoming dry and boring. When you are working with good actors, it makes your job easier...\"\n\n\"Age doesn't mean anything. It's all in your head. Men get sexier with age. They also get wiser and get\n\nexperienced. As long as you don't go through mid-life crisis where you are 40 and want to play an\n\n18-year-old character on screen, I think you are okay.\"\n\n\"I look at fitness as a necessity in the same way as how you drink water, eat food, one should look at\n\nfitness in a dedicated way. People will look fresh and happy. If you are happy you in a way look fit.\"\n\n\"The most important thing is to figure out Your goal in life. If Your intentions and methods are correct,\n\nthere is no way You will not achieve it.\"\n\n\"Both my paternal and maternal grandfathers were in the army but my maternal grandfather Brigadier\n\nGurdayal Singh designed the first artillery gun for the Indian army post-independence.\"\n\n\"I do intimate scenes only when they are required. These kind of scenes require a lot of concentration\n\nand I am scared about how people will react later.\"\n\n\"Shooting is the most fun part of making films.\"\n\n\"I like to surprise the people I love.\"\n\n\"For me, love is the number one emotion, and then comes everything else.\"\n\n\"Films that lack good scripts but are made on big budgets, are not my cup of tea any more. I need to\n\nwork in a film that has a smart screenplay.\"\n\n\"All my films are commercial in nature. The purpose of making a film is to educate, entertain and\n\nrecover its money back. And it should have takers for satellite rights.\"\n\n\"I have decided not to do bad films. It has taken a lot of effort to connect with real cinema.\"\n\n\"I still wonder why (actresses get insecure), as they don't sit on edit table, or discuss budget, or are\n\npresent in producer's meeting, or involved at scripting stage, they sit with hair and make-up done.\n\nWhile an actor will get into all areas so that he can get into direction or production or write a movie.\n\nI think one learns a lot of things while doing a film.\"\n\n\"I have gone through low phases in my career too. Films don’t work, you hit the rough road and people\n\nlose confidence in you. This happens because you make the wrong choices. One should take it as a\n\nlearning lesson.\"\n\n\"Today I’m in a position to choose the kind of movies I want to do. For me, cinema is special and\n\npious. It’s about doing the right film. I want to do films I’ll be proud to show my children and\n\ngrandchildren. My focus is to create a credible body of work. I’m getting good roles and people believe\n\nI can play difficult characters. Of course, I have got my due.\"\n\n\"You don’t change friends like you change clothes. I have formed friendships with people I have\n\nworked with. The industry is like a family.\"\n\n\"Who’s not insecure? Insecurities help you stay focused. They can make you negative as well because\n\ninsecurity is a type of fear. It’s stems from lack of confidence You should overcome this fear. Like\n\nyou’re afraid to walk in the dark as a child, but you do walk in the dark once you grow up. You don’t\n\nfear ghosts or witches then. Above all, your life is what you make of it. You shouldn’t wish bad for\n\nanyone or be happy at someone else’s downfall. When you remain positive, insecurity gives way to\n\nconfidence. And when you have confidence in yourself, others too gain confidence in you.\"\n\n\"I love fame. I know how to respect it. When someone comes to me for an autograph I never refuse.\n\nPersonally I would be painfully shy to go up to someone to ask for an autograph. It must really take\n\na lot of courage to go up to somebody and ask for an autograph. I would be very very embarrassed\n\nif I walk around and no one recognizes me or comes to me for an autograph.\"\n\n\"When I saw Amitji (Bachchan) for the first time, I behaved like a fan myself. So I know how a fan\n\nbehaves. I respect my fans. They are important for me. If I step out and no one notices me, I’d\n\nget upset.\"\n\n\"I do one film at a time and that’s why you see different looks of mine. I take at least two or three\n\nweeks off between films so that I don’t get exhausted. I’m not in any rush to do many films.\"\n\n\"I can’t see my own films. I am horribly critical. I don’t enjoy watching my own films. I always feel I\n\ncould have done better. Most often I am not even looking at the film but at the people and seeing\n\ntheir reaction.\"\n\n\"From now onwards, it’s a conscious decision – what I realised is that one day I’ll die or I’ll be old,\n\nsitting at home with my grandchildren and children and if I had to put on a DVD and show them what\n\nkind of work I did, I shouldn’t be cringing. I would like to be remembered for my past. So I choose\n\ncharacters and parts to be recognised. The kind of films I do make me happy. If you don’t feel\n\nsatisfied as an actor after working on a film, then how can you satisfy anybody else?\"\n\n\"I don’t trust anybody blindly. I trust people for what they are, or what I can see them to be.\"\n\n\"I love my wife’s cooking and I love food, but I’ve never starved myself for a six pack!\"\n\n\"I think John (Abraham) has always had a great body. And he worked out really hard for Dostana to\n\nget much leaner. But I compete from the ‘front’, that’s why I don’t look him as a rival. Ha ha!\"\n\n\"No butts for me. I’d rather let my acting do the talking!\"\n\n... READ MORE ARJUN RAMPAL QUOTES\n\n--- Connect With Arjun ---\n\nHome address: 104 Hill Post, Shirley Rajan Road, Opp. Stringfield High School, Bandra.
