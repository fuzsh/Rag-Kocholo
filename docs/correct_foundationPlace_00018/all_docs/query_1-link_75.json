It has been an incredible honour, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have played a role in the growth and success of Wipro. During my tenure as CEO and MD, we have witnessed a significant transformation within the company that has not only driven financial growth but has also positively impacted our associates, clients, and shareholders. I will be available to the company till May 31, 2024. I wish the company continued success and prosperity in the future.\"\n\nPallia, who's assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director at Wipro Limited has had an illustrious career spanning over three decades, boasting a comprehensive understanding of Wipro's diverse geographies, functions, service lines, and business units, enriching his leadership role with a wealth of knowledge and insight.\n\nHaving commenced his journey with Wipro in 1992, he has occupied various leadership positions, notably serving as the President of Wipro's Consumer Business Unit and as the Global Head of Business Application Services. Most recently, he excelled as the CEO for Americas 1, Wipro's largest and fastest-growing market, where he spearheaded a diverse portfolio of industry sectors, crafting their strategic vision and executing growth initiatives with precision.\n\nHis academic credentials include a bachelor's degree in engineering and a master's in management studies from the prestigious Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Additionally, he has enriched his expertise through executive programs at renowned institutions such as Harvard Business School's Leading Global Businesses program and the Advanced Leadership Program at McGill Executive Institute."
