Especially with the emergence of generative AI, we expect a fundamental shift up ahead, for all industries. New business models, new ways of working, and new challenges, too,” said Thierry Delaporte, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Wipro.\n\n“This is exactly why Wipro’s ai360 ecosystem places responsible AI operations at the heart of all our AI work,\n\n“It’s meant to empower our talent pool and be ubiquitous across all our operations and processes, as well as our solutioning for clients. We are ready for the AI-driven future,” he added.\n\nWith responsible AI at its core, Wipro ai360 will bring together the 30,000 Wipro experts in data analytics and AI with Wipro’s technology and advisory ecosystem from four global business lines.\n\nCapabilities across cloud and partnerships; data, analytics and AI; design and consulting; cybersecurity; as well as engineering will be leveraged to develop new solutions and embed AI into all processes and practices.\n\nWipro’s new global business line model will enable new levels of agility, speed, and depth in delivery.\n\nFurthermore, Wipro’s innovation hub Lab45 will be a core part of the Wipro ai360 ecosystem, providing clients with the talent, training, scale, as well as the research and co-innovation capabilities needed to accelerate AI adoption.\n\nWipro is a technology services and consulting company focused on building innovative solutions that address clients’ most complex digital transformation needs.\n\nThe firm has over 250,000 employees and business partners across 66 countries."
