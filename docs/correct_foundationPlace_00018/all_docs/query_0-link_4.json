        "text": "Right now we are facing one of the biggest challenges of our lifetime - the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to hundreds of thousands of deaths, and millions of job losses, we have seen the closure of schools, families in underserved communities struggling to gain access to basic essentials, and the emotional and physical toll taken on first responders.\n\nWipro Ltd, Wipro Enterprises Ltd and Azim Premji Foundation are using our resources, technical expertise, and network, to provide pandemic-related support. We first took action in India; as the nation went into lockdown, we committed a combined $148 million to provide frontline medical and service professionals with essential supplies and resources. Moreover, early in the crisis, we opened our Bangalore cafeterias to the public, serving meals to 40,000 migrant workers in the first 24 hours after lockdown, and, since then, providing sustenance to more than half a million people every day. In May, Wipro will repurpose one of its information technology campuses in Hinjewadi, Pune to a 450-bed intermediary care COVID-19 hospital. This is an independent, isolated COVID-19 dedicated complex that also includes 24 well-appointed rooms to accommodate doctors and medical staff.\n\nGiving back is an ingrained part of Wiproâ€™s culture, carried out not only by Wipro, but also by Wipro employees. To this end, we have expanded our efforts by providing Wiproites around the world with opportunities to give back in partnership with leading charities, First Book, Food Banks Canada, Hunger Free America, Save The Children, Oxfam, and Project Hope. In addition to working from home, Wiproites are now volunteering from home. They're are also making financial donations to designated COVID-19-related aid organizations, which Wipro is matching 2-to-1.\n\nWipro and its employees are proud to be partnering with these organizations to provide support to those effected by COVID-19. Wipro employees in India can donate to Wipro Cares."
