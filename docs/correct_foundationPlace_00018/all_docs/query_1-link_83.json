Thus the initial stages of the organization are very important for it. The company is required to make its mark and establish itself in these years. The company has to make itself known in the market and build a reputation. It has to attract the customers and retain them by building trust and relationship with them.\n\nThe above mentioned points make the initial stages of the company very crucial for its survival.\n\nThe company can survive its initial stages by:\n\n· Optimum allocation of resources:\n\nWhen the organization is established, it has to take special care in allocating its resources the company has to do an optimum allocation of resources. They have to make the best use of the resources available to them and forecast the demand for the resources as well. The resources available to the organization like the financial resources, the labor etc has to be utilized at the optimum level.\n\nThe organization needs to take into account that the resources are not over used or over utilized which can harm the organization.\n\n· Innovation\n\nTo survive in the competitive market, it is necessary for the organization to keep innovating.

It is necessary to have a good R&D department do that the organization can provide new and better product and services that the customer demands.\n\n· Differentiate the products\n\nTo survive in the market, it is very important to attract the right customer at the right time. One of the ways of doing do is by providing differentiated products and services to them. The organization will not be able to survive if it offers me- too products. Thus differentiating the product becomes very important for the organization.\n\n· Provide Customized products\n\nThe company needs to be flexible and provide the products that meet the needs of the customers. For this the company has to customize its products and services. By doing so it will be able to attract more customers, satisfy them and build long term relationship with them.\n\nWhy and how customers are convinced to award first ITO/BPO project to the company?\n\nIt is very important for the company that its customers are convinced and satisfied about the work that the company is doing.\n\nThe customers can be convinced about the company by the following ways:\n\n· Products & Services provided by the company\n\nThe various services provided by the company play the key role in selecting the company. The customer looks for the best service at the best price. Another factor that differentiates the company is that how far is the service differentiated from that of its competitors or is it the me- to product. Wipro has provided the best services at the best prices to its customers. It provided them with the differentiated products to meet the needs and to satisfy the customers.\n\n· Companies Values and policies:\n\nThe organizational values play an important role.

A business model describes the core aspects of a business, like its value proposition, customers, market segmentation, revenue generations, and operational practices and policies, etc.\n\nWipro Technologies’ revenue streams consist of telecom, telecom service providers, embedded, finance, retail, energy & utilities and others.\n\nA business model needs to be changing as per the requirements by the environment and situation. A business model will change and evolve overtime. A business model results from technological inputs to economic outputs and differs from strategy as a business model focuses on creating value. A business model does not deliver that value to the shareholder, and it assumes a limited economic knowledge.\n\nATTRACTING, HIRING AND RETAING IT BUSINESS STAFF\n\nEvery company requires quality IT employees to stay in the organisation for a long period of time contributing their skills and talent for the betterment of the company. Wipro needs to hire those employees who are committed to the long term vision of the company so that it saves money, time and other valuable resources in not re- hiring employees.\n\nFor making a good hiring decision the company needs to prepare an attractive job description by proper planning, research and analysing what exactly the company expects from the employees and what are the requirements of the company.\n\nThe job description requires proper planning and research in terms of what are the business goals and objectives of the company, what are the expectations of the company from the employees , take advice from IT consultants and if necessary use contacts of IT recruiters to get quality IT employees to apply for the jobs.\n\nIt is critical for the company to mention in its job description that it requires the employees to be an expertise in more than one IT career field and mention job titles of the respective fields. This increases the chance of the company to find more qualified candidates for the job.\n\nThe goal of every organisation is to retain the IT employees in the company for a long term as they are valuable assets and therefore the company should provide right salary with right incentives to prevent them from joining the competitors and sharing valuable information with competitors.\n\nThe following points need to be mentioned in the job description to keep the employees aware and to attract them to apply for the jobs in the company:\n\nJob Duration\n\nPreferred Years of Experience\n\nEducation Level\n\nSalary range\n\nTypes of technology the company requires\n\nRelocation Information\n\nTravel Information\n\nSecurity Clearance Information\n\nSummary Of the IT Job description.\n\nIn Wipro high growth opportunity, good working environment, corporate governance and company values and ethics attracts the IT employees.
