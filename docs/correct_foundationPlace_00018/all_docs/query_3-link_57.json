        "text": "Thierry Delaporte, who joined Wipro as CEO in 2020, launched the $10 billion IT services and consulting company on a massive transformation journey. We recently talked about the Wipro culture, the transformation and the impact of global trends he’s seeing.\n\nKaren Walker: You served in multiple C-suite positions before you came to Wipro. Out of all the options that you had, why did you choose this position at this company?\n\nThierry Delaporte: I would say that what has driven my career has been constant exposure to something I didn't know. It’s my desire to learn more in different areas.\n\nI spent 25 years in the same company in different roles living in many countries. I felt it was time for me to move on. I decided to leave the company, and to go on a six months’ sabbatical to take a transatlantic trip with my wife. Afterwards, I was going to dedicate time to a unique project.\n\nBut then, I met with Azim Premji, Wipro’s founder and chairman. Azim is an incredible human and entrepreneur, and, at the same time, a philanthropist.\n\nThen I spent three or four hours with the current chairman—and Azim’s son—Rishad Premji. The relationship between the CEO and the chairman is incredibly critical. When we met, I felt that we were speaking the same language and that we shared values and priorities. We certainly shared a common ambition. That completely changed my thinking about my future, and I took the CEO role.\n\nWalker: People talk about purpose being the center of their company, but I was fascinated to learn this is in Wipro’s DNA. As I understand, two-thirds of the company were pledged to a philanthropic initiative. It’s the world’s fifth largest endowment, with roughly tens of billions in the fund.\n\nDelaporte: Yes, the purpose is built into the company’s DNA. There is a Wipro Foundation, and then there is an Azim Premji Foundation. Every time we deliver a particular volume of profit, a portion of that profit gets distributed to the Foundation. It directly impacts all the programs that the Foundation operates.\n\nFor example, we have large campuses in India, but because of Covid, most of them were either closed or empty. So, we turned one of our campuses into a hospital. We were able to supplement a struggling medical system during the Covid crisis. We also served over 600 million meals during the year.\n\nWalker: You joined Wipro near the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nDelaporte: I joined Wipro in July 2020. To prep for this role, I talked with Rishad, the chairman, almost daily for a month and a half prior to coming aboard. Tell me more about the culture. Tell me more about the organization, the clients and everything. Before knowledge, before technology, before all the assets we have, it’s our culture. This company was, in some ways, not growing as fast as others, but the values were there. It hadn't been pushed to its potential.\n\nWalker: What was your vision for what could happen here? I know you've said success looked like having a market impact as a competitor and being a leader in the industry.\n\nDelaporte: I'm a people person. I love connecting with people. I was not able to gather people in the same room when I joined. I was alone in my office in Paris, I couldn’t travel, and my teams were everywhere.\n\nEven so, we very rapidly aligned on an ambition reset. It felt like a team who had lost too many games and suddenly felt a lack of confidence working on the pitch. The work became resetting the level of ambition for Wipro.\n\nI think the strategy was there. But the ambition was lacking. We needed to say that we are not only here to serve our clients, but we are here to advise, guide and partner with them. I felt that we needed to turn from a waiter providing services to being a chef. We needed to provide the client with proactive solutions and ideas, and act as a partner.\n\nWe agreed that we could not be the best at everything, so the focus is important, as is building the team. Once we have that, we ask, “Do we have the right model? Do we have the right organization?” We’ve gone through the most extensive organizational redesign of the company in the last 25 years. We've re-injected ambition, boldness, proactivity, high energy, a passion for clients and an absolute obsession for growth in all its aspects.\n\nWalker: This is not a trivial task even for a small company, but for something at that scale - over 240,000 employees - it’s hard to imagine the reorganization, never mind all the people-related change. Your employees had to understand, “What does this mean to me? What's my part? How do I contribute?”\n\nDelaporte: The most significant risk is to underestimate the task. Or to think, after a year or two, that because the results are good, “This is it,” and you've done your transformation.\n\nWalker: Over the last couple of years, you've generated tremendous growth, but you were helped by the high demand for digital and cloud computing services as clients embraced digital transformation at an accelerated pace because of the pandemic. There’s also been a shift from GSI power to cloud provider power at a strategic level. Are these trends impacting you, and if so, how are you responding?\n\nDelaporte: The need for technology has driven us to an exceptionally high period of growth. Yes, it will slow down. There is no question. And I think the macro environment today, between the oil crisis, inflation and so on, will undoubtedly cause the economy to slow down.\n\nI speak to clients every day. They tell me that even if they are slowing down and must cut costs, they will still need us to help them become more agile, more productive, and streamline their operating model. So, we are more a solution than a problem, more an investment than a cost.\n\nThe power shift from the GSIs to the cloud providers isn’t new to me. But they are in the product business. We are in the people business. We are an orchestrator to integrate the cloud into the environment of our clients, so the partnerships we are building with the providers are strong.\n\nWalker: Tell me about the role of curiosity in leadership and how it has improved your ability to grow as a leader and to lead successfully.\n\nDelaporte: I'm smiling because I think it's been paramount in my career. Curiosity and a low fear of failing.\n\nLet me give you a couple of examples. I studied political science and law, so I’m not particularly a technology person. I started in finance. I was a CFO for many years, then I moved into sales. Later I moved into running operations, which was very unusual. Every time I went into a space where I had to learn, I loved it. One day I was asked to lead my previous company’s banking and financial services business. I had never worked in this market before, and suddenly I was leading a team of 70,000-80,000 people. I had to learn.\n\nSo, it's all about curiosity. It's about accepting that you don't know everything. It's about having enough humility to learn from others and not constantly feeling that you need to have all the answers. It's about listening as much as it is about deciding, and it's about learning from your own mistakes. It’s been an ongoing process for me."
