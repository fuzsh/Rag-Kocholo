The center's major goal will be to assist fundamental and applied research in the field of generative AI. It will also work on R&D projects and assess the economic potential of innovations developed by students at IIT Delhi's Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence (ScAI).\n\nREAD MORE|Ph.D. is not mandatory for teaching positions in colleges or universities, according to the UGC\n\nWipro's $1 billion commitment to develop and accelerate AI-led innovation as part of the Wipro ai360 ecosystem is reflected in the relationship. \"We are excited to partner with IIT Delhi to foster accelerated innovation in some of the most exciting emerging areas of technology,\" stated Wipro Limited Chief Technology Officer Subha Tatavarti. \"This collaboration will not only strengthen our R&D capabilities in emerging areas such as generative AI but will also connect us with a talent pool that will assist us in developing advanced solutions to address existing and emerging business problems.\"\n\nIn order to address at-scale real-world issues, the CoE will act as an R&D hub, bringing together Wipro researchers with ScAI faculty members and graduate students. Wipro CoE teams will collaborate to develop novel solutions based on AI, ML (machine learning), and other technologies.\n\n\"Collaborating with the eminent and multidisciplinary faculty at IIT Delhi and its research partner ecosystem will help us realize our vision of Engineered Prosperity faster,\" stated Dr. Ajay Chander, Wipro Limited's Head of Research and Development.\n\nProfessor Mausam, Head of the Yardi School of AI at IIT Delhi, remarked, \"Through the establishment of this Centre of Excellence, our students will gain valuable insight into industry-relevant problems and will learn firsthand how their technical know-how transfers to commercial environments.\" Finally, our collaboration with Wipro will benefit everyone and significantly contribute to India's progress in these key new technological domains.\"\n\nREAD MORE| AICTE Organizes Second Edition of Inventors Challenge for Semiconductor Innovation\n\nShare :"
