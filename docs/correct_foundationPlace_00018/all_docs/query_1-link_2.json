        "text": "Wipro (stylized in lower case as wipro) is an Indian multinational corporation that provides information technology, consultant and business process services. It is one of the leading Big Tech companies. Wipro's capabilities range across cloud computing, computer security, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analytics, and other technology consulting services to customers in 167 countries.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly years\n\nThe company was incorporated on 29 December 1945 in Amalner, India, by Mohamed Premji. In 1966, after Mohamed Premji's death, his son Azim Premji took over Wipro as its chairperson at the age of 21.\n\nShift to IT[]\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted its focus to new opportunities in the IT and computing industry, which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western India Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited. In 1982, the name was changed again, from Wipro Products Limited to Wipro Limited. In 1999, Wipro was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[In 2004, Wipro became the second Indian IT company to earn US$1 billion in annual revenue.\n\nWipro Technologies is an information technology service company, the global IT services arm of Wipro Limited (in operation since 1945, incorporated in 1946). It is headquartered in Bangalore.\n\nIn 2012, Wipro demerged its non-IT businesses into a separate company called Wipro Enterprises. Prior to this demerger, these businesses, mainly in the consumer care, lighting, furniture, hydraulics, water treatment, and medical diagnostics, contributed about 10% of Wipro's total revenues.\n\nIn March 2023, Wipro opened its American international headquarters at Tower Center in East Brunswick, Middlesex County, New Jersey."
