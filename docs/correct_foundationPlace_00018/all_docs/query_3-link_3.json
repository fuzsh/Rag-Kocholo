        "text": "Education\n\n-\n\nAavishkaar\n\nVision: To nurture curious, creative, and critical-thinking citizens of tomorrow. We encourage children to question to understand the world around them. Curiosity and interest often lead to the creation of new ideas. We want students to never stop exploring and not be afraid to make mistakes. We encourage children to be observant and justify their opinions with evidence.\n\nEducation\n\n11/01/2019 - On Going\n\nAdhvan\n\nAt Adhvan, we envision a world where every child has access to good quality education that fosters their development as complete human beings. We work to support the education of marginalized children through democratic library centric interventions that raise readers, support literacy, and enhance life skills; empowering them to discover their voice, realize their potential, and build their agency.\n\nEducation\n\n01/01/2019 - On Going\n\nAlternative Strategies for the Handicapped (ASTHA)\n\nA large number of persons and children with disabilities reside in the urban slums and resettlement colonies of Delhi, and belong to migrant families engaged in unskilled work and are employed in the unorganized sectors. This is the vulnerable population often left behind during a humanitarian crisis. It is with these persons and children with disabilities residing in the urban slums and resettlement colonies of Okhla, Tughlakabad, Govindpuri etc. in Delhi that ASTHA has been working with for their rehabilitation for three decades now.\n\nEducation\n\n10/01/2021 - On Going\n\nApni Shala\n\nThe vision of Apni Shala is to build social and emotional competencies among individuals to constructively engage with society and have a harmonious coexistence. Our mission is to increase access to Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) for the larger community. Apni Shala’s work is positioned at the intersection of education and mental health. Mental Health, within the ambit of our work, is understood as a state of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. Our initiatives are aimed at students in educational systems, with a primary focus on public education systems. We make efforts to develop awareness about SEL competencies. To this end, we undertake psychosocial therapy and counseling, as appropriate.\n\nEducation\n\n04/01/2018 - On Going\n\nArmy Navy Air Force Wives Activity Trust (ANAWA)\n\nANAWA Trust is a not-for-profit organization in the field of education since 1994. The target beneficiaries are the children of families with low income, migrant daily wageworkers, petty vendors, domestic help, rickshaw pullers and the like. The trust runs classes from LKG to Class VIII, and thereafter ensures that most students leaving after Class VIII complete their Class X & XII exams through NIOS.\n\nEducation\n\n-\n\nArtSparks Foundation\n\nArtSparks Foundation (www.art-sparks. org) is an educational nonprofit that supports the development of 21st century learning and life skills in children through visual art and design. ArtSparks also supports the professional development of teachers and educators, encouraging them to reflect on their teaching practice, and explore new ways to enrich their students’ learning ‘EdSparks Collective’ is a one-of-a-kind, 12-session professional development program run by ArtSparks for those interested in exploring the full potential of the visual arts to transform student learning.\n\nEducation\n\n03/01/2016 - On Going\n\nAseema Charitable Trust\n\nAseema Charitable Trust is a non-governmental organization established in 1997 with a mandate to protect and promote human rights of underprivileged children. We see education as a right of every child and as an instrument of change; we recognize the urgency with which quality education must be made available to all. The word ‘Aseema’ means limitless. This is how we view the child’s potential – as a great strength that can soar in the right environment. We strive to create that environment and sustain a nurturing relationship with every child.\n\nEducation\n\n08/01/2018 - On Going\n\nASHA Foundation\n\nASHA Foundation was established in 1998. At that time, the global HIV/AIDS pandemic was at its height and there was concern that India was going to be the next flash point after Africa. There was also intense stigma and discrimination towards HIV population. So, ASHA Foundation was established by two doctors to complement the government’s efforts and contribute to it.\n\nEducation\n\n-\n\nAshayen\n\nVision: To create a healthy space for every child living on the streets to reach their full potential.\n\nMission: To ensure education for every child living on the streets and connect them with the mainstream. To expand their opportunities to reach their full potential in terms of skill, talents and interest.\n\nEducation\n\n01/01/2016 - On Going\n\nAshray Akruti\n\nAshray Akruti, a voluntary organization, has been working for the people with disability since 1996 with an aim to improve the lives of people with disability and other marginalized sections of society. The organization strongly believes in the potential of persons with disability and envisions a society where people with disability lead a life of dignity as equal citizens with equitable access to opportunities and services.\n\nEducation\n\n04/01/2017 - On Going\n\nAssociation for the Welfare of Persons with a Mental Handicap – AWMH\n\nAWMH-Maharashtra is one of the first parents’ associations in India, initiating the Parents Movement for the acceptance, welfare, and rehabilitation of their children. Started initially as a place for counseling parents devastated with the birth of a child with intellectual disability, and guiding them over to acceptance and empowerment, AWMH has grown into an institution, administering therapy to around 100 children with neuro-developmental delay every month at its Early Intervention Centers.\n\nEducation\n\n-\n\nAvaniti Education and Training Foundation\n\nResearch in neurosciences has confirmed that early childhood is a critical stage in the development of the brain. This period influences the pathways of physical, and mental health and behavior throughout the life cycle. More than 80% of human brain development takes place during this stage provided that the child is exposed to a stimulating and caring environment.\n\nHowever, in India, more than 40% of children belonging to the ages of 3 to 6 years are not enrolled in any kind of preschool (Kaul and Shanker, 2009) and more than 30% of these children belong to ST and SC communities (Centre for budget and policy). 30% of Children enrolled in government Anganwadis and preschools do not have desirable cognitive and emotional skills, as per the ASER 2018 ECE report."
