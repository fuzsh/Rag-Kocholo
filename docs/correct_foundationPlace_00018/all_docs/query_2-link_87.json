        "text": "Synopsis\n\nModelled on lines of Harvard management co, the trust will fund Premji's philanthropic activities. It may be funded by sale of promotor equity in Wipro.\n\nBANGALOREL: Wipro’s billionaire founder, Azim Premji, will launch an endowment trust, modelled on the lines of the world-famous Harvard Management Company, to fund all his philanthropic activities. The trust, which will eventually have a billion-dollar corpus, will be operational in January next year and could be funded by the sale of a small chunk of promoter equity in Wipro, India’s third-biggest software services exporter.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nThe trust will largely focus on leading the education initiatives strongly favoured by Mr Premji, according to people close to the development.\n\nElevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteMIT xPROMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisitIIT DelhiCertificate Programme in Data Science & Machine LearningVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisit\n\n“(Mr) Premji could use proceeds from his sale of around 4.52% stake in Wipro to fund this corpus,” said a person familiar with the development, but who requested anonymity. This will also help Mr Premji bring down his holding in the company and comply with the new finance ministry rule that mandates companies listed in India must increase their public shareholding to 25%.\n\nThe trust will be led by KR Lakshminarayana (Lan), the current chief of Wipro’s strategy and mergers & acquisitions. He declined to comment on the developments.\n\nMr Premji’s office also did not respond to an email query sent by ET on September 8. A spokesman for the company said more details will be shared only after January 2011, when Lan’s new role becomes effective.\n\n“The endowment needs to be large, and selling his Wipro stake to comply with Sebi rules is among top options to fund the trust,” said a second person familiar with the process.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nIn many ways, the fund would be similar to the $27.6-billion endowment corpus managed by Harvard Management Company, which supports the educational and research objectives of Harvard University.\n\n“It’s early to talk about what investment strategies this fund would have, but the idea is to make it self-sustained,” the second person quoted earlier said. “Given the special needs to be addressed and the expansion at hand, the fund will need to be liquid,” the person added.\n\nPhilanthropic foundations, such as the Wadhwani Foundation set up by technology entrepreneur Romesh Wadhwani, typically follow a networking approach when funding specific non-profit initiatives. “Foundations that are well-endowed can have a significant impact on the social sector,” said Ajay Kela, president & CEO of the Wadhwani Foundation. The foundation recently made a $5-million grant to set up the Wadhwani Research Centre in Biosciences and Bioengineering at IIT-Bombay.\n\n“If we invest $50 million in a programme that requires a total of $500 million to be sustainable, we engage other agencies such as governments and corporates who can provide additional funding to ensure the long-term success of the initiative,” Mr Kela added. In contrast, the Premji Foundation, which draws its capital from a single source, will focus on supporting all of Mr Premji’s philanthropic activities, the majority of which will be in the area of education.\n\nFor such a model to be robust in the long term, the management of funds will necessarily have to be very conservative, say industry experts, particularly as not-for-profit funds that draw their corpus from multiple sources have not had a very successful run in India.\n\n“There has to be less of an IRR (internal rate of return) approach to the way they manage their money in the beginning,” said Vijay Angadi, managing director, Novastar Funds, a global fund that invests capital from high networth individuals across publicly-listed small cap stocks. “The very aggressive approach to investing by Mr Premji’s family office is not a model that this philanthropic endowment trust can follow,” he added.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nMr Premji, estimated to be worth around $17 billion, already has over $1 billion being managed by his family office Premji Investments.\n\nElevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIT DelhiCertificate Programme in Data Science & Machine LearningVisitIndian School of BusinessProfessional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisit\n\nSetting up this endowment trust is seen as a crucial move to ensure continuity of his philanthropic initiatives. “The university can be big, if we are successful we can be duplicating this in other states. It can be a very scaled operation. There are 6 million teachers in primary education in our country, see the skies of the challenge. Now there is a spate of private education coming in the villages, so already about 20% of primary education in villages is becoming private. I think they will pay for quality education even in the villages, which means that these schools can afford to hire and pay more to teachers. So talent will be sought after,” he told ET in an interview earlier this year.\n\nAt the end of March quarter, the Wipro chairman held around 79.52% of the company’s shares. In order to comply with the new regulation, Mr Premji will have to divest 4.52% of his holding.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
