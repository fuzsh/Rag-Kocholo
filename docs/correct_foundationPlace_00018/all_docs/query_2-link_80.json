The company is endeavouring to expand the business to other parts of the country under which offices are being expanded in five cities including Bhopal and Coimbatore. Besides helping the company to deliver consultancy, delivery and support services promptly to clients, the new regional office will act as a nerve centre for its activities in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
