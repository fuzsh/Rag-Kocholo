        "text": "Overview\n\nWe are facing multiple educational challenges in our country. These range from high dropout rates, poor learning-levels, inequity in access to quality education, high prevalence of rote-learning and marks orientation, lack of accountability, to inadequate teacher preparation. These issues are systemic and addressing them requires deliberate, long-term, and sustained planning to build capacities within the system and create public awareness and engagement.\n\nWipro Education Program has been engaged in building the capacities of important actors in the school education system to bring about the desired reform for close to two decades. We firmly believe that education is an enabler of social change. We envision a democracy where every citizen is empowered, not only in an individual capacity but also believes in the ethics of equity, the essentiality of diversity, the ethos of justice, and is driven by social sensitivity. Schools have to be the spaces that nurture these principles, capabilities, and values.\n\nGood education must ensure the holistic development of the child in multiple dimensions to fulfill and expand their potential as they become active, contributing, and concerned citizens of the world. The numerous dimensions of development include cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and ethical abilities. Learning-to-learn, critical thinking, problem-solving, conceptual understanding, etc., are some of the other important facets of an effective education system.\n\nApproach\n\nCivil Society Organizations (CSOs) and public institutions have played a critical role in improving school education through sustained work and a wide range of creative interventions. Their work has had a direct impact on the ground and has also led to shifts in educational discourse and practices. However, there is a continuing need for CSOs to address the evolving challenges of school education in the country."
