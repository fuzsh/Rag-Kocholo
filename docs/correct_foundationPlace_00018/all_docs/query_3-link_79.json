        "text": "Globalworth, the largest investor in the CEE, has completed the fit-out project for its tenant, WIPRO, a leading global information technology, consulting and business process services company. The fit-out project lasted several months Globalworth Square, the most technologically advanced building in the landlord’s portfolio. This office building obtained the BREEAM Outstanding certification, with 99% scoring, the 3rd highest worldwide.\n\nSuch innovating results led to a fit-out to match the new WIPRO office. The nearly 11,000 square meters area is a literal representation of the office of the future: flexible workspaces, ergonomic furniture, relaxation areas, warm colours and plenty of game areas, amphitheatres, fresh materials. Let’s not forget the curved walls, creative lighting fixtures, glazed partitions and plasterboard lining with an exposed concrete finish.\n\nThe project covers 5 floors (floors 9 – 13 of Globalworth Square) and over 1,000 workstations and hosts a total of 100 meeting room seats. Assisted by the PROGRAPHIC concept design architects, the Workplaces Globalworth team has managed to create a contemporaneous environment, where the WIPRO teams develop their projects and come up with new ideas every day.\n\nOne of the key fit-out elements was the integration of nature in the workspace. To us, smart buildings are necessarily green buildings, and the technologies in which we invest have an inherent care for the environment or biophilia, as the concept is known. In the WIPRO space, we have used a remarkable number of natural plants. In addition to the visual aspect, which is a plus, these plants also act as a biofilter, improving air quality and reducing the carbon dioxide in the environment, releasing fresh oxygen.\n\nWe have truly enjoyed working for a partner like WIPRO. Extremely open to our suggestions, they have always encouraged and supported us. We are grateful for their trust and our fantastic collaboration! It is extremely satisfactory to see the result and we are glad that this space is used by WIPRO, a company that has been in the Globalworth community for many years. Out of the work put in by our team, a creative, vibrant and unconstrained project came out. An office where employees feel creative, inspired and free. An office of the future, built and fitted out in the present, said Dimitris Pergamalis, MRICS, Group Head of Workplaces at Globalworth.\n\nAbout Globalworth Square\n\nWith this project, located in the middle of the Globalworth District, the largest business community in Bucharest, the landlord is creating a new standard when it comes to responsiveness, well-being, sustainability, and reduced costs of occupancy. Since technology plays a central role in the office of the future, a trend accelerated by the pandemic, Globalworth is bringing the future closer with a series of unique innovations. An important part of the energy consumption will be provided by the photovoltaic roof and to increase safety, direct contact with the surfaces will be limited by implementing touchless solutions with IR sensors in all the sanity facilities, while the access to the building and office spaces will be available through Bluetooth and NFC technologies.\n\nGlobalworth Square has an innovative health and safety feature, increasing the air filtration and UVC light disinfection for a hygienic office environment: a system that disinfects the air introduced in the office area as well as in the common spaces with the help of UV-C lamps installed on the inlet connections of the air-treatment stations. This system ensures efficient and effective reduction of microorganisms by up to 99%, even in very confined spaces, and it works against viruses such as Covid-19 and other pathogens. Another innovation is the building’s cooling system, consisting of a heat pump, R1234ze ecological freon chillers and a boot storage, designed to generate low energy consumption. The implementation of the ice storage system is unique for a class A office building in Romania."
