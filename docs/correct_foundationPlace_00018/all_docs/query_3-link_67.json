        "text": "Wipro’s Edgile Acquisition: Another Step in the Right Direction for Wipro’s Cybersecurity Aspirations\n\nIT service providers are looking to own the end-to-end cybersecurity adoption cycle and be part of the executive decision-making. This implies going beyond regular implementation and managed security services and offering consultancy and advisory services. Through Edgile, Wipro aims to achieve the following two goals: move up the value chain by playing an influential role in the initial stages of deals, which involve decision-making at the board or CXO leveland position itself as an end-to-end service provider by augmenting its cybersecurity consulting capabilities and covering the entire value chain.\n\nFebruary, 2022"
