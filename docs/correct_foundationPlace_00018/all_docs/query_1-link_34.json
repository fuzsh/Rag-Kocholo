        "text": "Across all industries, strategic imperatives are deeply connected to the opportunities developing alongside emerging technologies. The companies that invest in digital transformation at the optimal pace and scale are the ones that win the market. As we enter 2024, leaders from Wipro Consulting forecast how technologies like GenAI, digital twins, and industry clouds will impact companiesâ€™ growth agendas across various industries. Only by proactively seizing the initiative and taking advantage of leading-edge technologies will your company evolve and future-proof its business models.\n\nAt Wipro, we understand the importance of tracking and disclosing an organization's impact on all its capitals, including natural, social, and human capital. That's why we have developed Wipro Impact Intelligence. Our solution helps clients establish standardized accounting and valuation principles to accurately measure and disclose their impact. Take the first step towards a more sustainable future by downloading 'The Rise of Impact Accounting' report.\n\nArtificial intelligence is making a significant impact on the financial sector, and there is much more to come. This edition examines practical applications of AI across our industry, including banking and fintechs, asset management, investment advice, credit rating, software development and financial ecosystems.\n\nEnhancing the passenger experience has become a top priority for busy airports around the world seeking to increase non-aero revenue. They key is finding ways to leverage vast amounts of underutilized data to create personalized offerings that redefine travelers' relationship with the airport.\n\nThe latest Designit interview reinforces that innovation doesn't happen inside a computer, but inside our minds and imagination. But the pressure to adapt quickly to market changes makes it difficult to focus on the right types of innovation, which presents both opportunities and challenges.\n\nCapco's research sheds light on the role of data and personalization as insurers map their optimal path forward. The insights and recommendations gleaned from input by 13,750 respondents can help insurers navigate an increasingly digitized and competitive marketplace.\n\nChatbots and other virtual assistants will soon be much more ubiquitous across the employee experience. Change management will de-risk their implementation and promote broader acceptance.\n\nCarbon-reduction initiatives are expanding in scope and will inevitably evolve further in the future. While decarbonizing the value chain may seem like a burden, viewed through the proper lense and strategic vision, it can bring exciting opportunities for new business models and growth."
