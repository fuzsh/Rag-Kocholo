In a piece titled ‘Latika Vihar: more like real life,’ she shares her experiences as a member of the team, which sustains Latika Vihar as an inclusive learning space open to all children by keeping play at the center. https://lnkd.in/geJ9eWZw This article was first published in an issue of ‘Samuhik Pahal,’ which focused on the theme of ‘Learning spaces in schools, outside the classroom.’ This issue carries articles that look at the totality of the experience of schooling, and not just learning in classrooms. The pieces discuss, from multiple perspectives and spaces of practice, how these spaces outside the classroom can be used to help students become sensitive, responsible and engaged human beings and learners.

The course is a part of the Bedrock series, which provides comprehensive understanding regarding the foundations of education. ‘Perspectives on Learning’ will enable learners to make connections between what is being taught, educational practice on the ground, and to appreciate the relationship between the two. It will discuss different conceptions and debates regarding “the child” and “childhood” and their implications for understanding the developing child in school and non-school contexts. It will take a life-span and developmental perspective to emphasize the continuity of development and learning. The course is designed to address educators’ capabilities. They will learn how their approach, behavior, ability to connect with children, and insights into the child’s developmental stages, could help them guide the child’s learning better. The course will be organized in-person in Jaipur. The language of instruction will be English. Last day to receive nominations: July 5, 2024 To nominate individuals from your organization for this course, please visit: https://lnkd.in/gEf3bqMb The application process for organizations includes a nomination of the potential participants by the organization's leader/founder. We hope this will allow for a more deliberate and conscious decision-making, aligned with each organization's internal capacity building needs and trajectories.\n\nVambay Housing Colony in Hyderabad's Singareni area is a government-built project for low-income families. It was established about 20 years ago. The buildings, spanning ground and three storeys, face issues like broken drainpipes, damaged balconies, and contaminated drinking water. Garbage piles at street corners attract animals and mosquitoes. Efforts to address these challenges gained momentum through the 2023 iLOCAL idea contest, supported by Wipro Foundation, and organized by Hyderabad Urban Lab Foundation (HULF). Swachh Singareni, a finalist team led by young architects like Ayesha Ateekh, proposed transforming a site into a clean, educational area. The idea was further reinforced by senior architects Pingali Naga Praveen and Nithish Punna. Learn how collaborative efforts involving CSOs, including volunteers from SAFEE, the Dalit Women’s Collective, and partnerships with the local residents, were instrumental in addressing the community's waste management needs. https://lnkd.in/gDn4Wf68\n\nAlong the shores of Inayawan, Cebu City, the Philippines, coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to environmental degradation and marine pollution. Plastics and microplastics have become a threat to marine ecology and human health in their region. As part of their efforts to spread awareness about ocean health, a group of students from Inayawan Dumpsite ALS Community Learning Center embarked on a journey to become environmental stewards and foster positive changes within their community. Today, on World Oceans Day, we are proud to share the work of Inayawan Dumpsite ALS Community Learning Center students, who have drawn attention to the issue of plastic pollution. The students emerged as one of the winners in the inaugural edition of \"The Famous Challenge: Action for Oceans.\" In January 2024, Wipro earthian partnered with The Famous Project to launch \"The Famous Challenge: Action for Ocean.\" The challenge invited students from India, the Philippines, and France to create engaging videos emphasizing the importance of ocean conservation. #WorldOceansDay"
