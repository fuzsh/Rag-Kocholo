        "text": "Wipro Limited, a leading global information technology, consulting and business process services company, unveiled its Texas Technology Center in Plano, Texas. Wipro also plans to ramp up its headcount in Texas to 2000 over the next few years from 1400 now.\n\nThe Texas Technology Center is focused on developing niche capabilities in new and emerging technologies for Wipro’s clients, which include some of the nation’s most innovative companies. The new facility will primarily house Wipro’s US cyber security center, as well as serve as a hub for advanced analytics. The state-of-the-art 45,000-square feet center is designed to promote collaboration, spur creativity and enhance productivity. To begin with, this center will employ 150 people and plans are on the anvil to further increase the workforce at this facility.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott and senior officials of the state’s administration visited Wipro’s Electronic City facility in Bengaluru.\n\n“With more than 1,400 employees in Texas and major operations now in Plano, Dallas and Houston, Wipro is playing an important role in the Texas economy,” said Governor Abbott. “From investing in the future of the Texas communities to supporting us in the Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, Wipro is a valued partner in Texas. I thank Wipro for their investments in the Lone Star State, and today’s visit to their headquarters in Bengaluru will serve to fortify our already strong partnership.”\n\nWipro has forged strong relationships with local universities as part of its effort to attract and recruit the best of the next generation talent. Over the past year, Wipro has recruited 120 graduates from local universities, including the University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas), University of Houston, Rice University, and University of North Texas (UNT). Prior to working on client projects, these new recruits are put through a rigorous three month-long technology boot camp where they are trained on leading-edge technologies."
