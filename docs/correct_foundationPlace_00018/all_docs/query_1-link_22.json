As soon as practicable after receipt of notice of any meetings or solicitation of consents or proxies of holders of shares or other deposited securities, our Depositary shall fix a record date for determining the holders entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights. The Depositary shall then mail to the holders of ADSs a notice stating (a) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and any solicitation materials, (b) that each holder on the record date set by the Depositary therefore will be entitled to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any, pertaining to the deposited securities represented by the ADSs evidenced by such holders of ADRs, and (c) the manner in which such instruction may be given, including instructions to give discretionary proxy to a person designated by us. On receipt of the aforesaid notice from the Depositary, our ADS holders may instruct the Depositary on how to exercise the voting rights for the shares that underlie their ADSs. For such instructions to be valid, the Depositary must receive them on or before a specified date.\n\nThe Depositary will make all reasonable efforts, and subject to the provisions of Indian law, our Memorandum of Association and our Articles of Association, to vote or to have its agents vote the shares or other deposited securities as per our ADS holders’ instructions. The Depositary will only vote or attempt to vote as per an ADS holder’s instructions. The Depositary will not itself exercise any voting discretion.\n\nFor physical holdings, please send a letter, duly signed by the first holder, stating the new address and folio numbers of the shares you own to our Registrar and Share Transfer Agents, KFin Technologies Private Limited.

The address is as above After verification, they will issue a fresh check.\n\nTo avoid this problem in the future, you can use the ECS facility in which the dividend amount is automatically credited to the bank account of your choice. To avail of this facility, give your request to KFin Technologies Private Limited in writing.\n\nAlso, you might consider dematerializing your holdings through a Depository Participant. This would not only eliminate the issues of storage and risk of loss of paper certificates but also ensure automatic crediting of dividends to your bank account. Click on the links to the see the list of Depository Participants empaneled with each of the two depositories in India – NSDL and CDSL.\n\nAs per RBI notification, with effect from October 1, 2009, the remittance of money through ECS is replaced by National Electronic Clearing Services (NECS) and banks have been instructed to move to the NECS platform. This is in addition to the existing facility of ECS in other locations. NECS essentially operates on the new and unique bank account number, allotted by banks pursuant to implementation of Core Banking Solutions (CBS) for centralized processing of inward instructions and efficiency in handling bulk transaction.\n\nIn this regard, shareholders holding shares in electronic form are requested to furnish the new 10-digit Bank Account Number allotted to them by your bank,(after implementation of CBS), along with photocopy of a cheque pertaining to the concerned account, to your Depository Participant (DP). Please send these details to the Company/Registrars, if the shares are held in physical form, immediately.\n\nMembers who hold shares in the dematerialized form and want to change/correct the bank account details should send the same immediately to their concerned Depository Participant and not to the Company. Members are also requested to give the MICR Code of their bank to their Depository Participants. The Company will not entertain any direct request from such members for change of address, transposition of names, deletion of name of deceased joint holder and change in the bank account details. While making payment of Dividend, Registrar and share transfer agent is obliged to use only the data provided by the Depositories, in case of such demat shares.\n\nWeb based Query Redressal System;\n\nMembers may utilize this facility extended by KFin Technologies Private Limited, the Registrars and Transfer Agents for redressal of their queries.\n\nPlease visit https://karisma.kfintech.com/ and click on “Investors” option for query registration through free identity registration to log on. Investors can submit the query in the “QUERIES” option provided on the web site, which would give the grievance registration number. For accessing the status/ response to your query, please use the same number at the option “VIEW REPLY” after 24 hrs. The investors can continue to seek answers to additional queries relating to the case till they are satisfied. Investors could also send their queries to KFin Technologies Private Limited by post/e-mail to the following address:\n\nKFin Technologies Private Limited,\n\nUnit: Wipro Limited\n\nSelenium Tower B, Plot 31-32, Gachibowli, Financial District,\n\nNanakramguda,\n\nHyderabad: 500 032\n\nShareholders can also send e-mail to the designated e-mail id: einward.ris@kfintech.com\n\nIn order to make a nomination, please submit a duly filled in and signed nomination form (Form SH 13) in duplicate. If you hold shares along with other holders, then all holders are required to sign the nomination form. Nomination Form is to be submitted in duplicate.\n\nNomination in respect of shares held in physical form can be sent to the Company. After the Company receives the form and finds it in order, a registration number will be allotted to the nomination. A duplicate copy of the nomination form submitted by you will then be returned to you with an endorsement indicating the registration number and date.\n\nIn case of dematerialised shares, your nomination has to be recorded with your Depository Participant.\n\nIn case of shares held by sole holder, upon the death of the shareholder, the nominee, to the exclusion of any other legal heir/beneficiary, is the only person in whom the shares vest. In other words, in case of a valid nomination, the Company will not entertain any claim from legal heirs or beneficiaries and the shares will be transmitted only in favour of the Nominee.\n\nIn case the nomination is made by joint-holders, it will come into play only upon the death of all the joint holders. Therefore, if one of the joint shareholders dies, the shares will devolve on the surviving shareholders to the exclusion of the nominee. In this case, the surviving shareholders may make a fresh nomination if they so desire.\n\nUpon the demise of a shareholder, the nominee is entitled to have the shares transmitted in his favour. He/she is required to submit a notice in writing to this effect along with the original share certificate and an attested copy of the death certificate of the deceased shareholders.\n\nIf a nominee opts for registration of shares in his/her name, he/she has to submit a Transmission Form along with a copy of the pan card and proof of address, e.g. copy of passport, driving license, voter’s identity card or such other proof, to the satisfaction of the Company.\n\nUpon scrutiny of the documents submitted by the nominee, shares will be transmitted in his/her favour and share certificates will be returned to him/her duly endorsed.\n\nInvestor Relations:\n\nMr. Abhishek Kumar Jain\n\nGeneral Manager, Investor Relations\n\nTel.: +91 80 6142 6143\n\nEmail: abhishekkumar.jain@wipro.com\n\nRegistrar and share transfer agent:\n\nKFIN Technologies Limited\n\nSelenium Building, Tower-B,\n\nPlot No 31 & 32,Financial District,\n\nNanakramguda, Serilingampally,\n\nHyderabad, Rangareddy, Telangana, India - 500 032\n\nEmail ID : einward.ris@kfintech.com\n\nToll Free/ Phone Number : 1800 309 4001\n\nWhatsApp Number: (91) 910 009 4099\n\nKPRISM (Mobile Application) : https://kprism.kfintech.com/\n\nKFINTECH Corporate Website : https://www.kfintech.com\n\nRTA Website : https://ris.kfintech.com\n\nInvestor Support Centre (DIY Link): https://ris.kfintech.com/clientservices/isc\n\nContact person:\n\nMs. Swati Reddy\n\nE-mail id: swati.baireddy@kfintech.com\n\nMs. Rajitha Cholleti\n\nE-mail id: rajitha.cholleti@kfintech.com\n\nIn the case of dematerialized holdings, please write to your Depository Participant (DP) intimating them of the change and ask for a confirmation that their records reflect the new address.\n\nName and address of the overseas depositary for ADS:\n\nJP Morgan Chase Bank\n\n60, Wall Street\n\nNew York, NY 10260\n\nTel: +1 212 648 3208\n\nFax: +1 212 648 5576\n\nName and address of the custodian in India for the purpose of ADS:\n\nJP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.\n\n6th Floor, Paradigm, B Wing\n\nBehind Toyota Showroom\n\nMindspace, Malad (W)\n\nMumbai 400 064\n\nTel: +91 22 66492588\n\nFax: +91 22 66492509"
