        "text": "BENGALURU : Wipro Limited (NYSE: WIT, BSE: 507685, NSE: WIPRO), a leading technology services and consulting company, today announced a collaboration with the Centre for Brain Research (CBR), an autonomous, non-profit research organization, hosted at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). This partnership will focus on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analytics to develop new technologies that will provide precision support towards the prevention and management of long-term health disorders.\n\nWipro’s research & development (R&D) team, part of Lab45, will design and develop a personal care engine – an AI that will take into account an individual’s health history, desired health state, and other behavioral responses – to promote healthy aging, positive lifestyle changes, and psycho-social wellbeing to meaningfully improve an individual’s health over time.\n\nThe personal care engine will focus on reducing and managing the risk of cardiovascular disease and correlated neurodegenerative disorders, by using AI to personalize its interaction with users, optimizing for their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\nWipro will test the engine through a digital app-based trial in collaboration with CBR at IISc. This trial will generate valuable evidence regarding the engine’s effectiveness for contexts that are deeply relevant for long-term health outcomes.\n\nWipro’s technological expertise combined with CBR’s leading brain science research will unlock new possibilities for patient care and cognitive and overall health. The combined R&D prowess of both institutions will develop systems that deliver better health outcomes at population scale.\n\nSubha Tatavarti, Chief Technology Officer, Wipro Limited, said, “Wipro is committed to transforming the landscape of healthcare through technological innovation, and we are delighted to be partnering with the CBR and IISc on this journey. Our personal care engine enables wide-ranging applications and benefits for health management. It has the potential to mitigate lifestyle-related conditions and even enhance cognitive and psychosocial functioning.”\n\nDr. Ajay Chander, Head of Research and Development, Wipro Limited, said, “Our collaboration with CBR will pioneer solutions at the intersection of computing and cognitive sciences, bringing scalable personalized care support for some of the most chronic health challenges globally. Cardiovascular conditions are a particular focus for us, because of their strong association with long-term cognitive issues and the potential for broad health and wellbeing benefits at lower costs.”\n\nFurther emphasizing the importance of this partnership, Professor K.V.S. Hari, Director, Centre for Brain Research, said, “Working with Wipro allows us to amplify our scientific expertise through large-scale digital applications. This partnership will accelerate the path from research to real-world solutions in cognitive and overall health.”"
