        "text": "Delta Airlines recently adopted some new procedures for passengers who carry firearms in their checked luggage. Checked bags containing firearms will receive special tags.\n\nThese tags are intended to alert baggage handlers not to put the bags carrying firearms on carousels with other types of luggage. Instead the checked bags containing the firearms will go directly to a baggage service agent.\n\nThe changes per news articles are as follows:\n\nOwners will be required to show proof of identification to pick up their luggage\n\nThe baggage service agent will use zip ties to secure the bag before releasing the bag to its owner\n\nA police officer will be at the location when the passenger picks up the baggage [at some airports]\n\nDelta's requirements outlined\n\nShooting Equipment\n\nShooting equipment is allowed as checked baggage only. It must fit within the very specific criteria as outlined here:\n\nDeclare to the Delta representative that you are checking a firearm\n\nDeclare the existence of a firearm to security personnel if there's a security checkpoint before the Delta counter\n\nAll firearms must be declared by the passenger to a Delta representative at the main ticket counter\n\nPresent firearm(s) unloaded and sign a \"Firearms Unloaded\" declaration\n\nFirearms must be packed in a locked manufacturer's hard-sided container specifically designed for the firearm, a locked hard–sided gun case or a locked hard-sided piece of luggage. Handguns may be packed in a locked hard-sided gun case and then packed inside an unlocked soft-sided piece of luggage [a Conditional Acceptance Tag is required in this case]\n\nMaintain entry permits in your possession for the country or countries of destination or transit\n\nEnsure small arms ammunition is packed in the manufacturer's original package or securely packed in fibre, wood, plastic or metal boxes and provide separation for cartridges\n\nYou are responsible for knowledge of and compliance with all Federal, State or local laws regarding the possession and transportation of firearms. [For more information about this regulation you can visit the TSA website]\n\nIf you are transporting a firearm to the United Kingdom, a permit from the United Kingdom is specifically required. You must contact the United Kingdom for more information about securing this permit\n\nUntil further advised, passengers departing Brussels [Belgium] are not allowed to check weapons including, antique, sporting, hunting or toy rifles in their checked baggage\n\nAll firearms checked as baggage must be picked up at the Baggage Service Office upon arrival\n\nThe following types of ammunition are not accepted:\n\nGun powder such as Pyrodex or Black Powder\n\nAmmunition with explosive or incendiary projectiles\n\nAmmunition [including case] exceeding 11 pounds (5 kg) gross weight per passenger\n\nPistols and accessories must be included in one case and contain:\n\nPistol telescopes\n\nNoise suppressors\n\nA small pistol tool case\n\nNo more than 11 lbs. (5 kg) of ammunition [including case]\n\nRifles and shotguns must be packaged as follows:\n\nOne hard sided case containing up to four rifles, shotguns, shooting materials, tools\n\nThe case must completely secure the firearm from being accessed. All areas designed to be locked must be locked\n\nLocked cases that can be easily opened are not permitted. Be aware that the container the firearm was in when purchased may not adequately secure the firearm when it is transported in checked baggage\n\nOne hard sided case containing up to five handguns, one scope, tools\n\nOne bow and quiver of arrows and maintenance kit enclosed in a case or container strong enough to protect the bow and quiver from accidental damage\n\nNo more than 11 lbs. (5 kg) of ammunition [including case]\n\nAn excess baggage fee will apply if checking more than one gun case\n\n*Visit Delta’s website to read the original instructions - scroll down to Sports Equipment and then to Shooting Equipment.\n\nPer information from the Safari Club International (SCI), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has not issued any requirement for any airline to adopt these procedures even though TSA does impose some similar requirements. While all airlines regulate the carriage of firearms in checked bags, per SCI they are not aware of any other airline requiring customers to pick up luggage containing firearms at a special location, using zip ties to secure such luggage, or having law enforcement at the special baggage office."
