Since our first flight between Boston and Provincetown in 1989, Cape Air has provided year-round service to some of the most beautiful destinations in the world.\n\nShortly after that first flight, we expanded our service across southern New England to Hyannis, Nantucket, New Bedford, Marthaâ€™s Vineyard and Providence, RI. We have since expanded our wings across the Northeast with hubs at both Boston Logan International Airport and JFK. From 1993-2013 we provided flights between South Florida and the Keys, and in 1998, our Caribbean route took flight. From 2004-2018, we serviced Micronesia with two ATR-42's, which served our routes between Guam, Rota, and Saipan. In 2009, we began operating out of our Midwest region with current hubs in St. Louis, Chicago, and Nashville. In December of 2013, we added the Montana region to our network serving five rural communities in Northeast Montana with direct flghts from our hub in Billings.\n\nCape Air expanded its fleet in September of 2019, ushering in the newest aircraft type, the industry-changing Tecnam P2012 Traveller. Now, Cape Air operates a fleet of 64 Cessna 402s, 4 Britten-Norman Islanders and 30 Tecnam P2012 Travellers.\n\nWherever we fly, Cape Air is recognized for our outstanding customer service and convenient flight schedules. We have ticket and baggage agreements with most major airlines which means smooth connections and money-saving joint fares for our passengers.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your trip on Cape Air and we aim, as our mantra encourages, to MOCHA HAGoTDI. It means to Make our Customers Happy and Have a Good Time Doing It.\n\nRead about Cape Air's President and CEO, Linda Markham."
