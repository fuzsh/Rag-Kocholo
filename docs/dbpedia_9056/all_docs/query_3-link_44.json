        "text": "This page introduces Gibbs free energy (often just called free energy), and shows how it can be used to predict the feasibility of reactions. If you have already read the page about how to do this with total entropy changes, you will find a little bit of repetition on this page.\n\nStandard Gibbs free energy change, ΔG°\n\nCalculating ΔG°\n\nThis is how standard Gibbs free energy change is calculated:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nThat's all you need to know. Learn it!\n\nIf you know (or can work out) the enthalpy change for the reaction, and you know (or can work out) the entropy change, and you know the temperature (in kelvin), then it would seem to be really easy to work out ΔG°.\n\nThere is an easy mistake to be made though! You have to remember that the entropy change is calculated in energy units of joules, but ΔG° and ΔH° are both measured in kJ.\n\nBecause you are calculating ΔG, your answer will be in kJ mol-1. You must remember to change the entropy change value into kJ before you start, otherwise you will get the calculation completely wrong.\n\nOn an earlier page in this section, we calculated the entropy change for the reaction\n\nΔS° worked out as -242.2 J K-1mol-1.\n\nBefore you do anything else, convert this to kJ by dividing by 1000.\n\nΔS° = -0.2422 kJ K-1mol-1.\n\nThis reaction is actually the combustion of methane, and so we can just take a value of this from a Data Book. But you should, of course, know how to calculate this from enthalpy changes of formation.\n\nΔH° = -890.4 kJ mol-1.\n\nSo if you had to calculate the Gibbs free energy change at, say, 298 K, you can just slot the numbers in:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nΔG° = -890.4 - 298(-0.2442) = -817.6 kJ mol-1\n\nIt is easy as long as you remember to convert the entropy change value into kJ.\n\nFeasible (spontaneous) changes\n\nIn everyday life, something is spontaneous if it happens of its own accord, without any input from outside. The same thing is true in chemistry, but there is one major difference which defies everyday common sense.\n\nIf you drop marble chips (calcium carbonate) into dilute hydrochloric acid, there is an immediate fizzing. You don't need to do anything else - the reaction happens entirely of its own accord. It is a spontaneous change.\n\nBut in chemistry, a spontaneous change doesn't have to be rapid; in fact, it can be very, very, very slow indeed - even infinitely slow!\n\nFor example, carbon burns in oxygen to make carbon dioxide, but a piece of carbon will stay totally unchanged however long you keep it unless you first heat it. The energetics are right for a reaction to happen, but there is a huge activation energy.\n\nChemistry counts the reaction between carbon and oxygen as spontaneous! Personally, I think that is daft, and I prefer the word \"feasible\", which is often used in this topic. Throughout this topic I shall use the word \"feasible\", but if your examiners expect you to use the word \"spontaneous\", that is what you should do.\n\nFeasible changes and ΔG\n\nI am dropping the \"standard\" symbol after ΔG from now on, because most of the time we shall be using it at non-standard temperatures.\n\nWhether or not a reaction (or other physical change) is feasible depends on the sign of ΔG. If ΔG is positive, then the reaction isn't feasible - it can't happen.\n\nFor a reaction to be feasible, ΔG has to be negative.\n\nRemember that although it may be feasible, the reaction may not actually happen in any sensible time scale if there is a high activation energy barrier.\n\nFor a reaction to be feasible, the value of ΔG has to be less than 0. In mathematical terms, it is feasible if:\n\nΔG < 0\n\nBecause ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, that means that for a feasible reaction:\n\nΔH - TΔS < 0\n\nIf you know values for ΔH and ΔS, then you can work out a value for T which makes this expression less than 0.\n\nIn the case we are looking at\n\nΔH = +178 kJ mol-1, and\n\nΔS = +0.1604 kJ K-1 mol-1\n\nPutting those values into the expression ΔH - TΔS < 0 gives\n\n178 - T x 0.1604 < 0\n\nYou can treat the \"less than\" sign just like an equals sign, and so rearranging this gives:\n\n178 < T x 0.1604\n\n178 / 0.1604 < T\n\n1110 < T\n\nThat's a strange way of looking at it, of course (\"1110 is less than T.\"). But that is just the same as saying that T has to be greater than 1110 K.\n\nWorking out the effect of temperature without doing calculations\n\nLook again at the equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nRemember that for a reaction to be feasible, ΔG has to be negative.\n\nΔH could be negative (an exothermic reaction) or positive (an endothermic reaction). Similarly ΔS could be either positive or negative.\n\nThere are four possible combinations of the signs of ΔH and ΔS. I want to look at those in turn.\n\nWhere ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive\n\nIn the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS:\n\nΔH is negative. TΔS is positive, and so -TΔS is negative.\n\nBoth terms are negative irrespective of the temperature, and so ΔG is also bound to be negative. The reaction will be feasible at all temperatures.\n\nWhere ΔH is positive and ΔS is negative\n\nIn the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS:\n\nΔH is positive. TΔS is negative, and so -TΔS is positive.\n\nBoth terms are positive irrespective of the temperature, and so ΔG is also bound to be positive. The reaction will not be feasible at any temperature.\n\nWhere ΔH is positive and ΔS is positive\n\nIn the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS:\n\nΔH is positive. TΔS is positive, and so -TΔS is negative.\n\nNow increasing the temperature will change things. At higher temperatures, -TΔS will become more and more negative, and will eventually outweigh the effect of ΔH.\n\nThe reaction won't be feasible at low temperatures, but if you heat it, there will be a temperature at which it becomes feasible, because ΔG becomes negative.\n\nThe decomposition of calcium carbonate is a case like this, and we have done three calculations around it.\n\nWhere ΔH is negative and ΔS is negative\n\nIn the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS:\n\nΔH is negative. TΔS is negative, and so -TΔS is positive.\n\nAgain there will be a temperature effect. As temperature increases, -TΔS will become more and more positive, and will eventually outweigh the effect of ΔH.\n\nAt low temperatures, ΔG will be negative because of the effect of the negative ΔH, but as you increase the temperature, the effect of the positive -TΔS will eventually outweigh that. The value of ΔG will then become positive, and the reaction will no longer be feasible.\n\nIn summary\n\nI really wouldn't suggest you tried to learn this - it is too confusing. Make sure that you understand it, so that when a question comes up you can work it out at the time.\n\nYou should where possible practise by finding questions from past papers from your examiners, checking them carefully against the mark schemes and examiner's reports if they are available. That way you will get a feel for what they think is important.\n\nBut it isn't too difficult to make up questions for yourself which would help you through the whole topic. Choose a simple reaction where you can find entropy values for everything involved. Use a data book if you have one, or find the equivalent information online, and avoid anything which involves solutions.\n\nUse enthalpies of formation to work out the enthalpy change for the reaction. (If you use combustion reactions, for example, then you can just look up the enthalpy of combustion to save you the bother!)\n\nThen work out the entropy change during the reaction. Decide what the effect of temperature will be on the feasibility of the reaction, and then work out values of ΔG at some widely different temperatures to see if you are right. (When you are doing those calculations, don't forget to correct the entropy change value from joules to kJ!)"
