        "text": "What are the signs of \\(\\Delta S, \\Delta H,\\) and \\(\\Delta G\\) for the sublimation of dry ice (solid \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\) ) at \\(25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} ?\\)\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nAnswer: For the sublimation of dry ice at 25°C: - ΔS: positive - ΔH: positive - ΔG: positive\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nDetermine the sign of ΔS (entropy change)\n\nIn the sublimation process, solid CO2 turns directly into gaseous CO2. The gaseous state has more disorder than the solid state, so the entropy (the measure of disorder) increases. Therefore, for the sublimation of dry ice, the entropy change, \\(\\Delta S\\), is positive.\n\n02\n\nDetermine the sign of ΔH (enthalpy change)\n\nIn order to cause the solid CO2 to sublimate, we must provide energy to break the bonds between the CO2 molecules in the solid lattice structure. This energy input means the enthalpy is increasing. The enthalpy change, \\(\\Delta H\\), is positive for the sublimation of dry ice.\n\n03\n\nDetermine the sign of ΔG (Gibbs free energy change)\n\nWe can use the formula for the Gibbs free energy change, \\(\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S\\), where \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin. The temperature is given as \\(25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\), which is equivalent to \\(298 \\ \\mathrm{K}\\). Since both \\(\\Delta H\\) and \\(\\Delta S\\) are positive, the sign of \\(\\Delta G\\) will depend on the relative magnitudes of the two terms. For a spontaneous process, \\(\\Delta G\\) must be negative. The sublimation process is not spontaneous at room temperature; it requires energy input. As a result, the energy input required (\\(\\Delta H\\)) is greater than the increase in disorder (\\(298 \\ \\mathrm{K} \\times \\Delta S\\)), and \\(\\Delta G\\) is positive for the sublimation of dry ice at \\(25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\).\n\n04\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the sublimation of dry ice at \\(25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\): - \\(\\Delta S\\): positive (increase in disorder) - \\(\\Delta H\\): positive (energy input required) - \\(\\Delta G\\): positive (not a spontaneous process at room temperature)\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nEntropy Change (ΔS)\n\nEntropy, symbolized as ΔS, is a measure of the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. When a substance undergoes a phase change, like the sublimation of dry ice where it converts from solid to gas, it experiences a change in entropy. During sublimation, the molecules in the solid state, which are relatively well ordered, disperse into a gaseous state where they are much more disordered. This results in an increase in entropy, hence ΔS is positive.\n\nUnderstanding entropy is crucial because it relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that for any spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe increases. So, if a process like the sublimation of dry ice were to occur spontaneously, you would expect an overall increase in entropy. It's important to consider that although the entropy of the system (the dry ice) increases, the overall entropy change, when factoring in the surroundings, would dictate the spontaneity of the process.\n\nEnthalpy Change (ΔH)\n\nEnthalpy change, represented by ΔH, is related to the heat content of a system. It is a measure of the total energy, both kinetic and potential, contained in the chemical bonds of the substances involved in a reaction or phase change. In the case of the sublimation of dry ice, energy must be supplied to overcome the attractive forces holding the CO_2 molecules in place in the solid form.\n\nThis energy breaks the intermolecular forces, resulting in a transition to the gaseous state, which is a higher energy state due to the increased movement of the gas molecules. As a result, the enthalpy change is positive, indicating an endothermic process where the system absorbs heat from the surroundings. The endothermic nature of the sublimation of dry ice underscores the need for an external energy source for this phase change to occur under typical conditions.\n\nGibbs Free Energy Change (ΔG)\n\nGibbs free energy change, denoted as ΔG, is a thermodynamic property that can predict the direction of chemical processes. In essence, the sign of ΔG tells us if a process is spontaneous (ΔG < 0) or non-spontaneous (ΔG > 0) under constant pressure and temperature. For sublimation of dry ice, the ΔG is crucial in determining if the process will occur without outside intervention.\n\nUsing the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, with both ΔH (enthalpy change) and ΔS (entropy change) being positive in the case of dry ice sublimation, the sign of ΔG will depend on the relative size of these two terms. Since sublimation at room temperature requires added energy, it implies that the enthalpy term (ΔH) will outweigh the temperature-multiplied entropy term (TΔS), making ΔG positive. A positive ΔG reflects a non-spontaneous process at 25°C, necessitating energy input for the sublimation to proceed. Thus, while increased disorder (positive ΔS) favors spontaneity, it is the larger energy requirement (positive ΔH) that ultimately causes sublimation to be non-spontaneous at this temperature."
