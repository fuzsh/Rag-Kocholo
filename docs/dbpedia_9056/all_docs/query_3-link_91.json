        "text": "In summary, the relationship between free energy and equilibrium constant is given by ΔGo = -RT ln K. By measuring the pH at various temperatures, the temperature-dependent Kb for NH3(aq) was determined to be 1.34 X 10-5 at 283K, 1.42 X 10-5 at 293K, and 1.50 X 10-5 at 303K. The enthalpy and entropy can be estimated by plotting lnKb as a function of temperature and using the slope and y-intercept to find ΔH and ΔS. The x-axis is temperature and the y-axis is lnKb.\n\nRelated to Esimating delta S and delta H from temp and Kb\n\n1. What is the formula for calculating delta S and delta H from temperature and Kb?\n\nThe formula for calculating delta S is ΔS = nRln(T2/T1), where n is the number of moles of the substance and R is the gas constant. The formula for calculating delta H is ΔH = -nRTln(Kb), where Kb is the equilibrium constant at a given temperature.\n\n2. How do you determine the number of moles in a substance for calculating delta S and delta H?\n\nThe number of moles can be determined by dividing the mass of the substance by its molar mass. This can be found using the periodic table or by using a molar mass calculator.\n\n3. Can delta S and delta H be calculated for any chemical reaction?\n\nYes, delta S and delta H can be calculated for any chemical reaction, as long as the temperature and equilibrium constant (Kb) are known. These values can also be experimentally determined through calorimetry.\n\n4. How does temperature affect the values of delta S and delta H?\n\nAs temperature increases, the value of delta S also increases. This is because at higher temperatures, particles have more energy and are more disordered, leading to a larger change in entropy. However, the value of delta H may increase or decrease depending on the direction of the reaction and the value of the equilibrium constant.\n\n5. How can the values of delta S and delta H be used to predict the spontaneity of a reaction?\n\nIf the value of delta S is positive and the value of delta H is negative, the reaction is spontaneous at all temperatures. If both values are negative, the reaction is non-spontaneous at all temperatures. If delta S is negative and delta H is positive, the spontaneity of the reaction depends on the temperature and the magnitude of the values. A positive delta S and a positive delta H indicate a spontaneous reaction at high temperatures, but non-spontaneity at low temperatures."
