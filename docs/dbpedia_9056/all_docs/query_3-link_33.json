Our Close the Gap strategy aims to ensure the representation of women, Black talent and Latin and Hispanic talent in leadership roles accurately reflects the broader employee population. Our talent programs work to remove unnecessary barriers, like four-year-degree requirements, to certain roles across the organization to widen internal and external talent pipelines. Delta's 12 Business Resource Groups influence and drive business strategies and help create solutions that have a significant impact on Delta people, customers and the communities we serve.\n\nReturning 1% of the company's annual net income to the communities where we live, work and serve. Even more importantly, Delta people are making a difference in their communities by devoting their time and talents to a wide array of Delta's nonprofit and charitable partners.\n\nDelta is America's most-awarded airline thanks to the dedication, passion and professionalism of its people. In addition to the awards from J.D. Power and Cirium, Delta has been recognized as the top U.S. airline by the Wall Street Journal; among Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies; the World’s Most Admired Airline and one of the Best 100 Companies to Work For according to Fortune; and as one of Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work.
