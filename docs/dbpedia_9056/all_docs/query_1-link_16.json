        "text": "Generation Alpha, term used to describe the generation of people born (or who will be born) between 2010 and 2025. Some researchers, however, consider slightly different ranges. The term was introduced by Australian social researcher Mark McCrindle in a 2008 report on the subject. Generation Alpha is often linked with the millennial generation (also called Generation Y), as most members of Generation Alpha have millennial parents, and they are sometimes called “mini millennials.” Following Generations X, Y, and Z, Generation Alpha is the first generation to be named with a Greek alphabet letter instead of a letter from the Latin alphabet.\n\nGeneration Alpha can be difficult to describe demographically because they are still being born. They will likely be a very large segment of the population. The quick population growth of the baby boom years led to the millennial generation (whose members were born between 1981 and 1996) also being very populous, as they are mostly children of baby boomers (who were born between 1946 and 1964). This trend continues with Generation Alpha, who are largely the children of millennials (along with younger members of Generation X [who were born between 1965 and 1980]). Globally, it is estimated that more than 2.8 million members of Generation Alpha are being born each week, and by 2025 they are expected to number more than 2 billion.\n\nBecause members of Generation Alpha are still children, they are under the influence of their parents, who are typically millennials. Millennials’ habitual use of social media, including to share photographs, videos, or stories of their children, means that much of Generation Alpha will be online from birth. They are the first generation to experience remote classrooms, tablet computers, and ubiquitous streaming services from early childhood. They will also likely be affected by the emerging use of artificial intelligence (AI), both through voice assistants like Siri or Alexa and natural language processing tools like ChatGPT."
