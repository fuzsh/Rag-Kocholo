        "text": "The direction of spontaneous change is the direction in which total entropy increases. Total entropy change, also called the entropy change of the universe, is the sum of the entropy change of a system and of its surroundings:\n\nDSuniv = DSsys + DSsurr\n\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the universe, Suniv must always increase for a spontaneous process, that is, DSuniv>0.\n\nFree Energy and Free Energy Change—the Gibbs free energy, G, is used to describe the spontaneity of a process.\n\nG = H - TDS\n\nThe free energy change, DG is equal to -TDSuniv and it applies just to a system itself, without regard for the surroundings. It is defined by the Gibbs equation:\n\nDG = DH - TDS\n\nFor a spontaneous process at constant temperature and pressure, DG must be negative. In many cases, we can predict the sign of from the signs of DH and DS.\n\nStandard Free Energy Change, DGo —the standard free energy change, DGo can be calculated (1) by substituting standard enthalpies and entropies of reaction and a Kelvin temperature into the Gibbs equation or (2) by combining standard free energies of formation through the expression\n\nSummary of Gibbs free energy\n\nProblems:\n\n1) In the Haber process for the manufacture of ammonia\n\nAt what temperature will the reaction above become spontaneous?\n\nThe fact that both terms are negative means that the Gibbs free energy equation is balanced and temperature dependent:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nbelow this temperature the reaction is spontaneous.\n\n2) Determine the Delta G under standard conditions using Gibbs Free Energies of Formation found in a suitable Thermodynamics table for the following reaction:\n\n4HCN(l) + 5O2(g) ---> 2H2O(g) + 4CO2(g) + 2N2(g)\n\nCheck to make sure the equation is balanced\n\nLook up the Standard Free Energy of Formation of H2O(g) and multiply by its coefficient(2) in the equation.\n\n2 moles ( -237.2 kj/mole) = -474.4 kj = Standard Free Energy of Formation for two moles H2O(l)\n\nLook for the Standard Free Energy of Formation of CO2(g) and multiply by its coefficient (4)\n\n4 moles ( -394.4 kj/mole) = -1577.6 kJ = Standard Free Energy of Formation for four moles CO2\n\nLook up the Standard Free Energy of Formation of N2(g) and multiply by its coefficient(2)\n\n2 moles(0.00 kj/mole) = 0.00 kJ = Standard Free Energy of Formation for 2 moles of N2(g)\n\nAdd the results of steps 2,3, and 4 to get the Standard Free Energy for the products\n\n(-474.4 kJ) + (-1577.6 kJ) + 0.00 = -2052 kJ = Standard Free Energy for Products\n\nLook up the Standard Free Energy of Formation for HCN(l) and multiply by its coefficient(4)\n\n4 moles ( 121 kj/mole) = 484 kJ = Standard Free Energy for 4 moles HCN(l)\n\nLook up the Standard Free Energy of Formation of O2(g) and multiply by its coefficient(5)\n\n5 moles (0.00 kJ/mole) = 0.00 kJ = Standard Free Energy of 5 moles of O2(g)\n\nAdd the results of steps 7 and 8 to get the Standard Free Energy of the Reactants\n\n(484) + (0.00) = 484 kJ = Standard Free Energy for Reactants\n\nSubtract the result of step 9 from the result of step 5 to get the Standrad Free Energy Change for the Reaction\n\nSum of Free Energy of Products - Sum of Free Energy of Reactants = (-2052 kJ) - (484 kJ) = -1568 kJ = Standard Free Energy Change for the Reaction.\n\n3) For the following reaction using the Thermodynamics table:\n\nCoCl2(g) ---> CO(g) + Cl2(g)\n\nCalculate at 127°C the DG\n\nCalculate the Temperature when the above reaction is at equilibrium (DG = 0)\n\nAt what temperature will this reaction be spontaneous?\n\nCheck to see if the equation is balanced\n\nDetermine the Delta H of the Reaction using Hess Summation Law and Standard Enthalpies of Formation\n\nDelta H = Sum of Delta Hf of products - Sum Delta Hf of Reactants\n\nDelta H = [ 1(-110.5) + 1(0.00)] - [ 1(-220)]\n\nDelta H = -110.5 - (-220) = +110.5 kJ\n\nDetermine Delta S for the reaction using Standard Molar Entropies and Hess Law of Summation\n\nDelta S = Sum Standard Molar Entropies of Products - Sum of Standard Molar Entropies of Reactants\n\nDelta S = [ 1 mole(197.5 J/mole-K) + 1 mole(223) J/mole-K] - [ 1 mole(283.7 J/mole-K)]\n\nDelta S = 420.5 J/K - 283.7 J/K = 136.8 J/K\n\nConvert Delta S from J/K to kJ/K\n\n136.8 J/K X 1 kJ / 1000 J = 136.8 / 1000 = .1368 kJ/K\n\nConvert 127 C to K\n\nK = C + 273 = 127 + 273 = 400 K\n\nPlug results of step 2 and 4 into Gibbs Helmholtz Equation along with Kelvin Temperature to get Delta G of the Reaction\n\nDelta G = Delta H - T(Delta S)\n\nDelta G = 110.5 kJ - 400 K(.1368 kj/K)\n\nDelta G = 110.5 - 54.72 kJ = + 55.78 kJ\n\nBecause this reaction has a positive Delta G it will be non-spontaneous as written.\n\nName of Species Delta Hf(kJ/mole) Delta Gf(kJ/mole) S(J/mole-K)\n\nCO2(g) -393.5 -394.4 213.7\n\nCH3OH(l) -238.6 -166.2 127\n\nCOCl2(g) -220 -206 283.7\n\nCO(g) -110.5 -137.2 197.5\n\nC2H2(g) 227 209 200.9\n\nCl2(g) 0 0 223\n\nHCN(l) 105 121 112.8\n\nH2O(g) -241.8 -228.6 188.7\n\nH2O(l) -285.8 -237.2 69.9\n\nHNO3(aq) -206.6 -110.5 146\n\nN2(g) 0 0 191.5\n\nNO2(g) 33.2 51 239.9\n\nNO(g) 90.3 86.6 210.7\n\nO2(g) 0 0 205\n\nCS2 151\n\nH2 0 0 130.6\n\nCH4 -74.8 -50.8 186.3\n\nH2S -20.17 -33.01 205.6\n\nSO2 248.1\n\nFree Energy and Equilibrium.\n\nBecause DG is a measure of how favorable a reaction is, it also relates to the equilibrium constant.\n\nA reaction with a negative DG, is very favorable, so it has a large K.\n\nA reaction with a positive DG is not favorable, so it has a small K.\n\nA reaction with DG = 0 is at equilibrium.\n\nThere are several different DG's. It is important to distinguish between them.\n\nDGo (a delta G, with a superscript o), is the free energy change for a reaction, with everything in the standard states (gases at 1 bar, and solutions at 1 M concentration), and at a specific temperature (usually 25°C)\n\nDG (just delta G). This is the free energy change for a reaction that is not at the standard state.\n\nThe DG's are related as follows. KNOW THIS EQUATION and understand how to use it:\n\nDG =DGo + RT ln Q\n\nWhere Q is the same Q we used for calculating equilibrium (K is the special case for Q when at equilibrium.)\n\nSpontaneity and Speed of Reactions. This section simply points out that there is not any direct relationship between DG and the speed of a reaction (kinetics).\n\nProblem:\n\nStarting with the change in free energy at constant temperature: DG° = DH° - TDS°, and with the relation between DG and equilibrium constant, K: DG° = -RT lnK, derive a linear equation that expresses lnK as a function of 1/T (a linear equation is of the form y = mx + b).\n\n(b) The equilbrium constants for the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate at pH 7 is provided:\n\nCalculate DG° at 25°C.\n\n(c) What is the concentration of each isomer of phosphoglycerate if 0.150 M phosphoglycerate reaches equilbrium at 25°C.\n\nb) For T = 25ºC, using the equation of the graph, lnK = -1.8557 and K = 0.1564.\n\nc)"
