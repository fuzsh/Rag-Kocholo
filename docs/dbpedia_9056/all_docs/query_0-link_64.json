When the rail-to-trail project is complete, it will be an astounding 84.5-miles long. To date, there are 69.8 miles of trail completed. The completed northern corridor is 41.7 miles from Lexa to Snow Lake. The completed southern corridor is 28.2 miles from Yancopin to Arkansas City, including 15 miles of shared-use roadway on the Mississippi River Mainline Levee. Eventually, the trail will cross the White and Arkansas rivers.\n\nThere are currently ten trailheads at Lexa, Barton, Lick Creek, Lake View, Elaine, Mellwood, Snow Lake, Watson, Rohwer, and Arkansas City. Trailhead restrooms are available at Barton, Elaine, Mellwood, Snow Lake, Arkansas City, Watson, and Rohwer. (See trail map in green Brochure/Map section.)\n\nThe Delta Heritage Trail State Park's visitor center is located at the Barton trailhead, near the northern end. There are 24-hour access restrooms (no showers), five primitive campsites with tent pads, picnic tables, standing grills, and a community water spigot. The visitor center also has a gift shop. Bikes are available to rent and interpretive programming is offered. The Pedal & Paddle Tour is a bike ride from Barton to Lake View (about 12 miles one way), then kayaking on Old Town Lake, and then a bike ride back to Barton. Call the park for more information.\n\nThe Arkansas City Trailhead, at the trailâ€™s southern end, includes a multi-use building designed in the style of historic rail depots that houses administrative functions, bathhouse facilities, and an open pavilion. Visitors can also enjoy picnic areas, a water fountain, and a bicycle repair station. Interpretative elements provide information on the DHT, background about the town's history, and local recreational offerings. Also at the Arkansas City trailhead is the newly-built John H. Johnson Commemorative Plaza which memorializes the contributions of publishing magnate John H. Johnson who was born in Arkansas City.\n\nThe trail is being built in phases by Arkansas State Parks. When completed, the rails to trails portion will stretch from six miles west of Helena to Rohwer. From there, the trail will extend via the Mississippi River Levee to Arkansas City.\n\nYou can print the map to the complete Delta Heritage Trail by clicking here. It is also Geo-Enhanced and can be downloaded for use with smartphone application like Avenza Maps. Please refer to the application instructions for use. Here are the segments of the trail:"
