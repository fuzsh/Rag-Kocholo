        "text": "If you can’t find enjoyment in this city, I’m not convinced that you’re truly looking. Situated in the Western Cape of beautiful South Africa, Cape Town presents a warm, inviting and diverse community, breathtaking sights and appeals to all of the senses.\n\n“This city has a special appeal. Not only for myself but for South Africans and overseas visitors,” said Delta Regional Sales Manager – Africa Jimmy Eichelgruen.\n\nA native South African born in Durban, Eichelgren grew up in South Africa and spent much of his adult life there. Though he now lives in London, his work and passion keeps him closely connected to home country. His advice and perspectives helped shape my recent visit to help celebrate the launch of Delta’s between Atlanta, Cape Town and Johannesburg.\n\nTowering over the “Mother City” is the grandiose landmark of Table Mountain, beckoning to residents and tourists alike to give in to the temptation of adventure and take in glorious views. From Table Mountain’s unrivaled vantage point, you’re able to gaze across the seemingly endless line of coast, which brings about a sea breeze that fuels the vibrant yet relaxed vibe and personality of the city.\n\nFrom the fertile soil the city rests upon come the vineyards that make Cape Town a destination for the world’s wine connoisseurs. All told, this is a place not with a singular claim to fame, but one that rather truly contains multitudes of “only here” types of experiences.\n\nDuring my first visit, hikes around Table Mountain, a visit to the serene Beau Constantia wine estate, taking in views of False and Camps Bay and strolls around the famed V&A Waterfront quickly filled my personal calendar. Other “must do” items on my list for a return visit include a trip to the historic Robben Island and the Cape of Good Hope, not to mention the Boulders Beach to see the famed colony of African Penguins.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere residents should keep in mind that our winter season means South Africa is experiencing a wonderful summertime, offering an escape from the cold at home. “The summer season means beautiful, hot weather and crowded beaches,” Eichelgruen said. “There is a real buzz in the air.”\n\nThat said, Eichelgruen suggests preparing for anything during the winter months. “Cape Town winters have changeable weather conditions, and you can have all four seasons in one day! This includes rain, wind and sunshine.”\n\nHow to get there\n\nAs of Dec. 17, Delta operates seven weekly nonstop flights from both Atlanta and Cape Town, in addition to the airline’s existing daily service from Atlanta to Johannesburg, both on Delta’s flagship A350 aircraft. The expanded Cape Town service represents a 67% increase in capacity to South Africa over last year.\n\nFor South Africans, the direct link to Atlanta presents the opportunity to easily connect to more than 200 destinations from Delta’s global hub, while those traveling from the U.S. have more opportunity to connect with one of the world’s treasures.\n\nHow to eat (and drink) your way around\n\nThe opportunities to experience the flavors of Cape Town are on just about every corner throughout the city. It is a true carnivore’s paradise with a plethora of options ranging from the traditional braai (the Afrikaans word for barbeque) to the much less-traditional offerings of wild game meats.\n\nWhether it is enjoying the staple bar snack of biltong (cured, dried meats with a South African blend of seasoning) or the local sandwich staple loaded full of meats, sauce and chips (french fries), local flavors abound.\n\nThe multicultural influence is not lost on Cape Town’s culinary scene, however. Stemming from the United Kingdom’s colonial ties and India’s influence on the country, foods like fish and chips and curries also feature prominently in local eateries.\n\nTo say that wine-lovers will have no shortage of opportunities to rejoice would be quite the understatement. En route to the Beau Constantia wine farm on a tour across the Mother City, our tour guide exclaimed that Cape Town, and the Western Cape alone, is home to more than 100 wine farms.\n\nTravelers can experience some of the more traditional staples of tourism in the Stellenbosch and Franschhoek regions, equally enjoy a more boutique winery experience, or find any suitable experience in between.\n\n“Cape Town has a natural beauty, unique charm, diverse cultures and friendly locals,” Eichelgruen said. With so many options, limits to exploration in the world of wine, culture, adventure and discovery never prove elusive."
