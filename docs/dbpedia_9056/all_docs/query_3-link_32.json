        "text": "Video transcript\n\nWhen it comes to our understanding of spontaneous versus non spontaneous reactions were gonna say that the variable of gibbs free energy is right in the center of everything. If we know what the sign of delta G is, then we can determine if a reaction is spontaneous, non spontaneous or at equilibrium. Now we're gonna say here spontaneous reactions can occur without any outside energy being invested while non spontaneous reactions cannot occur unless you do put in energy for it to work. Now, we're gonna say here, we have spontaneous non spontaneous and reactions that are at equilibrium when it comes to reactions that are spontaneous. We're gonna say when it comes to our energy diagram, our y axis will be delta G, which is our free energy and then our X axis is just the progress of the reaction itself. We're gonna stay here for a spontaneous reaction. Your products at the end will have lower overall energy, which is meaning it's more stable. Lower energy for your compounds means more stable compounds here, for delta G, delta G. Here would be products minus react ints. And because your products are at a lower level, that means that delta G here will be negative, meaning that it is an Xr organic process. So, for spontaneous reaction, DELTA G will be less than zero. When you're a spontaneous reaction, your reactant go to completion. So you have a solid arrow going forward, meaning that you make 100% of your products. If you're a spontaneous reaction, according to the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the universe has to be greater than zero. If you're a spontaneous reaction, it also means that your equilibrium constant, K has to be greater than one. Finally, if you're a spontaneous reaction, it means your reaction quotient Q will be less than K. Now Q is basically a way of determining if you write equilibrium or not wherever Q is, It will shift in a direction necessary to get to equilibrium, which is K. So if you're a spontaneous reaction, Q is less than K. You'll have to move in the four direction to get to K equilibrium over time. So all these things can be said about a spontaneous reaction. We can say that the delta S of the universe is greater than zero gibbs. Free energy is less than zero. The equilibrium constant K. Is greater than one Q. Is less than K. And therefore the ford direction is favored, which is why the arrow goes in the forward direction and being a negative delta G. Means your eggs organic. Now, here, if we look at a non spontaneous reaction, exact opposite for almost everything. So here are entropy of our universe will be less than zero. Gibbs. Free energy will be greater than zero, meaning your products at our are at a higher energy state than your reactant, which is not favorable. So here would be positive, which means that this is an ender gone IQ process where energy has been absorbed. So that's why your products are at a higher energy state and then your equilibrium K would be less than one, Q would be greater than K, which is why our reaction favors the reverse direction. Okay, so we're gonna say here for non spontaneous process, the four direction is not favored. So the four direction is non spontaneous, which is not favored, which means very little product is being formed. Notice the difference in a row sizes, The four direction arrow is much smaller than the reverse direction. That's because if you're non spontaneous in one direction, you're spontaneous in the exact opposite direction. So here going in the reverse direction, we have a larger era to show that the reverse direction is favored. Finally, if you're an equilibrium, we're gonna say The entropy of our universe is equal to zero. Delta G is equal to zero. Therefore the difference in energy between my reactant and products um is zero. There is no difference. The same energy state. K will be equal to one and Q will be equal to K. So there will be no shifting of my chemical reaction in either direction because we've reached equilibrium status. Now, in addition to this, we can say that gibbs free energy can be calculated through the use of various equations here are some of the most common ones here, we have delta G gives free energy equals delta H, which is my entropy minus temperature in kelvin times entropy which is delta S here. It can be under nonstandard conditions or it could be under standard conditions where we have the little zero. Now, standard conditions means that my pressure is one atmosphere, My temperature is 25°C and my concentration is one molar. So that's what standard condition means. And that's when we have these little zeros here. Up top. Now, we can also say we can calculate gibbs free energy under nonstandard conditions. A second way where we use the gibbs free energy under standard conditions plus R. T times L N Q. R is our constant, which is 8.314 jewels over most times K T. Is temperature in kelvin. Que is just simply our reaction quotient. Remember your reaction quotient as well as your equilibrium constant. Both equal products. Overreact ints. Both of them ignore solids and liquids. Finally, we can have Gibbs. Free energy under standard conditions equals negative. R T L N. K. Again, R is the same 8.314 jewels over most times K. Constant. So just remember when it comes to determining spontaneity of a process, gives free energy is a great variable to use to determine the overall spontaneity of everything. It's more useful than taking a look at delta H and delta S alone because it can incorporate both those variables within its equations. Now that we've gotten this out of the way, we'll take a look at the example given below in the next video attempted on your own. But if you get stuck, don't worry, come back and see how we approach that same example question.\n\nVideo transcript\n\nSo, recall that a spontaneous reaction is one that happens naturally without the need of outside energy, whereas a non spontaneous reaction is one that doesn't normally occur unless some outside forces in play. So, if we take a look here, we have to figure out which of the following is an example of a non spontaneous process. Alright, so first we have ice melting at room temperature. Now we know that as long as the temperatures above zero degrees Celsius, which room temperature is, ice will naturally melt because this happens in real world scenarios, it is a spontaneous process. Next sodium metal reacting violently with water. Uh this one probably not as well known, just remember here that when it comes to group one A and two, a metals, because of the low number of valence electrons they have, they will violently react with water in order to lose an electron to become more like a noble gas. So here this is true, because it happens naturally in the real world. It's a spontaneous process here rusting of iron at room temperature. So, old cars when it rains, they can rust. This is a natural process that happens every day. And because of that, it's a spontaneous process, a ball rolling downhill. So a ball can naturally roll down a hill using its momentum as well as gravity to push itself down that hill, we can see that this happens um just by imagining it, you can take a ball and throw it down a hill, you'll see it roll down naturally. So it's a spontaneous process. Now, even if you weren't able to determine if the initial four were spontaneous or not, you should know that E is a non spontaneous process here. It says water freezing at room temperature, Room temperature is much too warm for water to freeze. Water has to be at 0°C or lower in order to begin to freeze. So we should know that this makes no sense. It's not a natural occurrence. It could only happen if we invested some outside energy. For example, we have a refrigerator where we put a nice tray in the refrigerator is in a room at room temperature, but inside the refrigerator it's much lower than that. They're therefore water could freeze. So the last option here, we're going to say, does not naturally occur. Water will not freeze at room temperature under natural conditions. Therefore, it is the process that is non spontaneous. Also remember, as we set up above, spontaneous reactions move in the four directions, they never move in the in the reverse direction, because if it's spontaneous, it's gonna move forward. It is non reversible or irreversible. Non spontaneous processes are not spontaneous in the four direction, so they tend to move in the reverse direction to become spontaneous. So non spontaneous processes are reversible\n\nVideo transcript\n\nSo here it says consider the decomposition of a metal oxide to its elements or M represents a generic metal. So here we have M 304 solid decomposes to give us three moles of em solid plus two moles of oxygen gas were also given the Gibbs free energies of formation. So delta G. F. Here Of these four separate compounds. Now, if we look at Part one, it says what is the standard change and gives energy for the reaction as written in the forward direction. So they're asking us to find delta G of the reaction. And standard here means that we have this little circle here. So remember whether you're looking for delta G of reaction delta S of reaction or delta H of reaction. All of them equal products minus react ints. So products minus react ints, realize here that the gibbs free energy of formation for em solid and oxygen gas are both zero. That's because when an element is in its natural standard state, it's gibbs Free energy will be zero, just like its entropy would be zero. So here we're gonna say we have three moles of em solid which really isn't gonna change anything. And the three comes from here times zero plus two moles. Oh, to each one is also zero minus, we have one mole of em 304. It's gibbs free energy of formation is this negative 9.50 killer jewels per mole. Okay, so all of this here is zero, so we can ignore that and we have a negative of a negative which comes out to a positive. So that's a positive 9.50 killer jewels because you're the most cancel out now for part two, it says what is the equilibrium constant of this reaction as written in the four direction? At 298 kelvin. So from the previous page we've seen that delta G can be connected to our equilibrium constant K. By this formula. So delta G equals negative R. T. L. N. K. But here's the thing, we don't want to find delta G. We already found out in Part one. Now, in part two, we're looking for what our equilibrium constant K. Is finding K means we rearrange the equation now to become K equals E. Which is the inverse of the natural log to the negative delta G. Zero, divided by R. T. So this is the equation we're gonna use now. So it's E to the negative are here has isn't jewels. So we're gonna have to convert the delta julie found earlier also into jewels. So remember, one killer jewel is equal to 1000 jewels. So that's 9500 jewels. So 9500 jewels Per mole here divided by 8.314 jewels over most times K. Which is the value of our our constant. And the temperature here is 298 Kelvin here, Mosul cancel out jewels will cancel out and kelvin's will cancel out, meaning that our equilibrium constant has no units. So this becomes E to the negative 3.8344. And when you plug that into a calculator, that's gonna give you 2.16 times 10 to the negative two for my value for my equilibrium constant. K. So now that we found that we finally figure out the last portion parts part three. So what is the equilibrium pressure of 02 over M solid at 298 kelvin. Alright, so now we're being asked to figure out the equilibrium pressure of this gas now here because they're using the coin, the terminology of equilibrium pressure or equilibrium concentration, that means we're gonna have to use the equilibrium constant. We just found so K equals products. Overreact ints. Remember your equilibrium constant ignores what it ignores solids and liquids. So this is a solid. So it's ignored, this is a solid. So it's ignored. So that means that your equilibrium constant is just equal to 02 Because there's a coefficient of two in front of that 02 in the equation that becomes the power. So it's 02 squared. All we do now is and we're gonna stay here since we're looking for equilibrium pressure. This is actually K. P. Now we're gonna say here K. P. Is the K. That we found here. That's 2.16 times 10 to the negative two equals The pressure, vote two squared. Okay, so technically because we're looking for the equilibrium pressure, we should have done this, We use that those brackets to represent concentration. If we're dealing with finding the equilibrium concentration of 02. So here now all we do is we take the square root of this side and the square root of this side. And what's left will be .147. When we're dealing with K. P. The units are at atmospheres, This represents the equilibrium pressure of 0.2 gas. If we're asked to find equilibrium concentration we would have used K. C. And it would have looked like this in that case when we took the square root of both sides, we have found our answer in polarity but again, we're looking for equilibrium pressure here and not equilibrium concentration. So realize these are the fundamental steps you need to take whether you're looking for the gift free energy of a reaction, your equilibrium constant or either equilibrium pressure or equilibrium concentration of any given compound within your balanced equation. So keep these in mind As you approach questions like this later on now that you've seen this example. Look to see if you can do example to that's given below remember we have the equations that relate Delta G2 different variables on the previous page utilize one of those equations to help answer example to once you've done that you can come back and see how I approach that same example to question\n\nVideo transcript\n\nSo here we're told for the reaction of two moles of carbon graphite reacting with one mole of hydrogen gas produces one mole of ethylene gas. Here we're told that gives free energy under standard conditions is 209.2 killer jewels at 25 degrees Celsius. Now we're also told that if the partial pressure of hydrogen gas equals 100 atmospheres and the partial pressure of ethylene gas equals 0.10 atmospheres, calculate gibbs free energy under nonstandard conditions for the reaction. So here we're dealing with gibbs free energy under standard conditions and nonstandard conditions. So the equation that connects them together is gibbs, free energy under nonstandard conditions equals gives free energy under standard conditions plus R T L N Q. Remember Q is just your reaction quotient, it's equal to products overreacting, just like your equilibrium constant and just like your equilibrium constant, we're gonna ignore solids and liquids. So here this would be C two H two Divided by H two. Here we're gonna plug in their partial pressures, technically again we're dealing with pressure. So technically we should only reserve brackets when we're dealing with concentrations. So technically it's P C two, H two. And then ph two here on the bottom. So here my Q would be 0.10 divided by 100 for Q. Now here are has jewels in its units. So we should convert the 209.2 killer jewels into jewels. So remember, one killer jewel is equal to 1000 jewels. So that's 209,200 jewels. So take that number plug it in. Plus our which is 8.314 jules over moles. Times K Temperature has to be in Kelvin. So to the 25°C, you add to 73.15 Which comes out to 298.15 Kelvin And then Ln of 0.10 divided by 100. So here When you work this out, that's gonna come out to be 19, jules as our units. But all the answers here are in killed jules. So we do one more conversion. So remember one killer jewel is equal to 1000 jewels. So that's 192.077 killer jewels which rounds up to 1 92.1 killer jewels. Making option A are correct choice. So just remember in this question, we're dealing with gibbs, free energy, both under standard conditions and nonstandard conditions. So you just have to recall what equation connects those two variables together and then plugging desired units to find your answer at the end"
