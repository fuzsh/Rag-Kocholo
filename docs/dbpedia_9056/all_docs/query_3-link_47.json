It does not mean that this will happen fast. In fact, it could take hundreds of years for a spontaneous reaction to occur.\n\nThe way to predict spontaneity is by calculation Gibbs Free Energy or deltaG. When delta G is negative that means the reaction is spontaneous, and positive means nonsponatenous.\n\nLet's note that when a reaction is spontaneous in one direction, it will be nonspontaneous in the opposite direction.\n\nTo calculate delta G, we can use the formula: deltaG = deltaH- T deltaS, where delta H is enthalpy and delta S is entropy.\n\nOther ways to predict spontaneity are:\n\n1. delta S universe is positive (entropy, or disorder of universe). Delta S universe = deltaS surroundings + delta S system.\n\n2. K is greater than 1, K is the equilibrium constant. Its connected to delta G by the equation: deltaG = -RTlnk\n\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant and T is temperature in Kelvin (Celsius + 273.15). Ln of a number great than 1 will give us a positive number, and therefore will result in negative delta G.\n\nTo learn more chemistry with our incredible chemistry tutors in Brooklyn, NYC and online call 646-407-9078.
