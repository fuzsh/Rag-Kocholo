        "text": "Finish by learning a new language in the 53-week Special Forces Qualification Course which also includes Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) exercises, Advanced Special Operations Techniques (ASOT), and a staged invasion of the fictional country of Pineland.\n\nEarn the right to wear the Green Beret and the Special Forces Tab after overcoming intense training and challenges to graduate as a Special Forces Soldier.\n\nWhile citizenship is a requirement for passing a secret security clearance, Lawful Permanent Residents can begin training for 18X right away. If you've had a valid Green Card (officially known as an I-551 Permanent Resident Card) for at least six months, you can apply for expedited naturalization and candidacy for the Special Forces through MOS 18X. Work with a recruiter to get started.\n\nYes. In addition to Basic Combat Training, Soldiers must have completed Advanced Individual Training (AIT) and U.S. Army Airborne School to be eligible to begin Special Forces training.\n\nIf you are not ultimately selected to join Special Forces during training, you will be assigned to a unit as a qualified specialist based on Army needs. In most cases, you’ll work in the Army job you performed prior to applying to Special Forces—called Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).\n\nSpecial Forces Soldiers carry the most advanced equipment in order to complete the most sensitive missions. While the gear and weapons vary based on the mission and team, Special Forces Soldiers use equipment such as: the lightweight all-terrain Ground Mobility Vehicle, the shoulder-fired, gas-operated MK17 SCAR select fire modular weapon system with a free-floating barrel, the advanced ram air parachute specially designed for severe environmental conditions, night vision technology, the Re-Breather underwater breathing device to navigate rivers and streams unnoticed, the M-4 Carbine rifle, and the Nett Warrior situational awareness system for use during combat operations.\n\nSpecial Forces Soldiers receive special duty assignment pay, language pay, parachute pay, and special-skills pay such as military free-fall, combat diver, or demolition pay. Their total benefits package includes more than $50,000 toward education, 30 days of vacation yearly, complete medical and dental care, initial entry and reenlistment bonuses, and more.\n\nThe first Special Forces unit was officially established during the 1950s, after several notable operational successes during World War II. However, unconventional warfare, a staple of small-unit operations, has its roots since before the Revolutionary War."
