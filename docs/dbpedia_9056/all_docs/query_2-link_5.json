        "text": "Suggs went on to attend Rutgers University majoring in Economics. It was during his freshman year that he began hosting weekly dance parties at the local Down Under nightclub while working daily at a local record shop. Suggs graduated from Rutgers in 1998.\n\n​\n\nIt was that summer that Suggs discovered a new location for his party promotions. Napolitano’s Restaurant, located in a beautiful historic building in New Brunswick, NJ. Suggs and his then fiance Coretta King quickly turned the ailing restaurant into a trendy social lounge on the weekends. His promotional efforts were so successful that then owner, Mike Napolitano decided to sell the property.\n\n​\n\nThe two quickly seized the moment and with the help of the SBA, they purchased the building, a liquor license and began planning Delta’s. A restaurant with great traditional soulfood served upscale in an inspired chic backdrop. By the winter of 1999 the restaurant was ready to open. Customers poured in from across the tri-state region to feast on Macaroni and Cheese and enjoy fabulous live music. Suggs focus was not only to serve incredible food but to create a complete soul experience. Guests could experience live R&B and Jazz while enjoying Happy Hour, Dinner, Brunch, or a private event all night long.\n\n​\n\nIn June 2003, Josh and Coretta received their first award from the NAACP for Entrepreneurs of the year. That would be followed by two trips to Steve Harvey’s “Hoodie Awards” for Best Soulfood in the Nation and a feature in the Black Enterprise Wealth for Life section.\n\n​\n\nDeltas has truly become a reflection of the exquisite experience Suggs wanted to enjoy when dining out or lounging. He has continued to hone all aspects of the space and operations making Delta’s one of the most iconic southern brands in the Nation from the food to the decor and the music. Delta’s Southern Cuisine & Cocktails is the kind of restaurant where your expectations are crucial to how much you’ll enjoy yourself. If you’re looking for no-nonsense soulfood like your mom made, in an upscale atmosphere, with prices to match then you are in luck."
