RECOMMENDATIONS ON THERMODYNAMIC TABLES\n\nThe papers by Alberty (ref. 5) and Alberty and Goldberg (ref. 7) show four types of tables of thermodynamic properties of biochemical reactants: (1) G o and H o for species at 298.15 K, 1 bar (0.1 MPa), I = 0. (2) G o and H o for species at 298.15 K, 1 bar, I = 0.25 M. (3) G 'o and H 'o for species at 298.15 K, 1 bar, pH = 7, pMg = 3, and I = 0.25 M. (4) G 'o and H 'o for reactants (sum of species) at 298.15 K, 1 bar, pH = 7, pMg = 3, and I = 0.25 M. Table 1 contains the most basic information for calculating G o and H o for reference reactions at I = 0 and corresponds with the NBS and CODATA Tables. Table 4 is the most convenient for calculating G 'o and H 'o under normal experimental conditions of 298.15 K, 1 bar, pH = 7, pMg = 3, and I = 0.25 M. Currently, thermodynamic information in biochemistry is stored as K ' and H 'o when pH and pMg are specified and as K and H o for reactions in terms of species. In order to calculate K ' and H 'o or K and H o for a reaction that has not been studied, it is currently necessary to add and subtract known reactions. It would be more convenient to be able to look up reactants in a table and add and subtract their formation properties to calculate K ' and H 'o or K and H o, as is usually done for chemical reactions. One reactant can be involved in hundreds of reactions, and so it is more economical to focus on the reactants. The usefulness of such a table increases rapidly with its length. As mentioned in Section 4.3, columns for H(i ) and Mg(i ) can be included so that thechange in binding of H and Mg at specified T, P, pH, pMg, and I can be readily calculated by use of equations 30 and 31.\n\nThe choice of 298.15 K, 1 bar, pH = 7, pMg = 3, and I = 0.25 M is arbitrary, but these conditions are often used. Tables can be constructed for other conditions (T, pH, pMg, and I) if sufficient information is available. H2O has to be included in this table because its G 'o(H2O) and H 'o(H2O) have to be included in the summations in equations 40 and 41 when it is a reactant, even though H2O is omitted in the expression for the apparent equilibrium constant.\n\nThe most basic principle is that thermodynamic tables on biochemical reactants at pH = 7 and pMg = 3 should be consistent with the usual thermodynamic tables to as great an extent as possible. A great deal is already known about the thermodynamics of reactions in aqueous solution, and this is all of potential value in biochemistry. The standard transformed formation properties of inorganic phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate at pH = 7 and pMg = 3 can be calculated since the standard formation properties of inorganic phosphate and glucose are well known and the properties of glucose 6-phosphate can be calculated from G 'o and H 'o for the glucose 6-phosphatase reaction. This is true for many other biochemical reactants. Sometimes it is necessary to use the convention that G o = H o = 0 for a reference species, as described in the discussion of the ATP series. It is difficult and expensive to obtain these missing data because biochemical reactants are often rather large molecules and contain a large number of elements. The methods described here make it possible to calculate G 'o and H 'o for Pi , glucose 6-phosphate, adenosine, AMP, ADP, and ATP at temperatures in the approximate range 273-320 K, pH in the approximate range 3-10, pMg in the range above about 2, and ionic strengths in the approximate range 0-0.35 M. Since the choice of reference species is arbitrary to a certain extent, it is desirable to have international agreement on these choices. This agreement is required so that thermodynamic properties in different tables of this type can be used together.\n\nFor many biochemical reactants, the acid and magnesium complex dissociation constants have not been measured, but this does not mean that these reactants cannot be included in a table of G 'o and H 'o at 298.15 K, pH = 7, pMg = 3, and I = 0.25 M. What is required is that the apparent equilibrium constant K ' for a reaction involving this reactant (or pair of reactants) with reactants with known properties has been determined at pH = 7, pMg = 3, and I = 0.25 M at more than one temperature. If the pKs of a reactant are unknown, there is a problem in calculating the equilibrium pMg, but this uncertainty may not be large if the concentration of Mg2+ is controlled by a buffer with known binding properties and the equilibrium concentration of the reactants is low.\n\nThe fact that biochemical reactions are often organized in series will facilitate the construction of thermodynamic tables. When a series starts or ends with a reactant with known formation properties, knowlege of the apparent equilibrium constants in the series makes it possible to calculate G 'o for reactants in the series at pH = 7. For example, consider glycolysis for which the apparent equilibrium constants for the 10 reactions have been known for some time. Since the standard transformed thermodynamic properties of glucose in aqueous solution are known, the G 'o values for the 17 reactants at pH = 7, including pyruvate, can be calculated with just one problem. Since G o is not known for NAD or NADH, one of the species has to be assigned G o = H o = 0. Since the thermodynamic properties of pyruvate are known, this provides a check on the calculation of Gi 'o of the reactants in glycolysis.\n\nThe following conventions are recommended:\n\n1. When a reactant exists only in an electrically neutral form at pH = 7 and pMg = 3 and G o and H o for that form in dilute aqueous solution are known, the values of G 'o and H 'o are calculated by adjusting for the content of H. An example is glucose.\n\n2. When a reactant exists in a single ionized form in the neighborhood of pH = 7 and pMg = 3, the values of G o and H o for that form in the usual tables (which apply at I = 0) have to be adjusted to I = 0.25 M with the extended Debye-Hückel theory and adjusted for H to obtain the entry to the table of G 'o and H 'o values. Obviously, thermodynamic properties of H+ and Mg2+ will not be found in the table of G 'o values. Also, ions like Ca2+ which bind significantly with multiply charged negative species of biochemical reactants cannot be put in the table because they require treatment like Mg2+. Values of G o and H o for Krebs cycle intermediates that exist at pH = 7 and pMg = 3 in a single ionic form calculated by Miller and Smith-Magowan (Appendix, ref. 8) can be adjusted for H and Mg and used in the proposed table after the values have been corrected to I = 0.25 M. An example is succinate.\n\n3. When a reactant exists in several ionized or complexed forms that are at equilibrium at pH = 7 and pMg = 3 and the standard thermodynamic properties of all of the ionized and complexed forms are known, the values of G 'o and H 'o of reactants at pH = 7, pMg = 3 , I = 0.25 M can be calculated using isomer group thermodynamics. Examples are inorganic phosphate (Pi), pyrophosphate, carbonate, citrate, and glucose 6-phosphate.\n\n4. When a reactant exists in several ionized or complexed forms with known dissociation constants and G o and H o are not known for any species of the reactant, G 'o and H 'o for the species can only be calculated by assigning one of them G o = H o = 0 in dilute aqueous solution. The G o and H o values of the various species have to be adjusted to an ionic strength of 0.25 M, and adjusted for H and Mg, so that G 'o and H 'o can be calculated for the reactant (sum of species) by use of isomer group thermodynamics, as illustrated here for the ATP series. NAD and NADH also provide an example, which is a little different because the acid and magnesium complex dissociation constants are believed to be identical.\n\n5. If acid dissociation and magnesium dissociation constants are not known for a reactant, it can still be put into a table at pH = 7 and pMg = 3 if apparent equilibrium constants have been measured under these conditions for a reaction involving this reactant with other reactants whose transformed thermodynamic properties are known. Examples are the many reactants in glycolysis other than glucose, ATP, ADP, Pi, NAD, NADH, and H2O.\n\n6. It is not necessary to have columns in tables for S 'o and S o because these can be treated as dependent properties and can be calculated from equations 25 and 42.\n\n7.
