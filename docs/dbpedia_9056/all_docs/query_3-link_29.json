        "text": "Deltas areÂ wetlands that form as rivers empty their water andÂ sedimentÂ into another body of water, such as an ocean, lake, or another river. Although very uncommon, deltas can also empty into land.\n\nA river moves more slowly as it nears itsÂ mouth, or end. This causes sediment, solid material carriedÂ downstreamÂ byÂ currents, to fall to the river bottom.\n\nThe slowingÂ velocityÂ of the river and the build-up of sediment allows the river to break from its singleÂ channelÂ as it nears its mouth. Under the right conditions, a river forms aÂ deltaic lobe. A mature deltaic lobe includes aÂ distributaryÂ networkâa series of smaller, shallower channels, called distributaries, that branch off from theÂ mainstreamÂ of the river.\n\nIn a deltaic lobe, heavier,Â coarser material settles first. Smaller, finer sediment is carried farther downstream. TheÂ finest material is deposited beyond the river's mouth. This material is calledÂ alluviumÂ or silt.Â SiltÂ is rich inÂ nutrients that helpÂ microbes and plantsâthe producers in theÂ food webâgrow.\n\nAs silt builds up, new land is formed. This is the delta. A delta extends a river's mouth into the body of water into which it is emptying.\n\nA delta is sometimes divided into two parts: subaqueous and subaerial. The subaqueous part of a delta is underwater. This is the most steeply sloping part of the delta, and contains the finest silt. The newest part of the subaqueous delta, furthest from the mouth of the river, is called theÂ prodelta.\n\nThe subaerial part of a delta is above water. The subaerial region most influenced by waves and tides is called theÂ lower delta. The region most influenced by the river's flow is called theÂ upper delta.\n\nThis nutrient-rich wetland of the upper and lower delta can be an extension of the river bank, or a series of narrow islands between the river's distributary network.\n\nLike most wetlands, deltas are incrediblyÂ diverseÂ and ecologically importantÂ ecosystems. DeltasÂ absorb runoffÂ from bothÂ floods (from rivers) andÂ storms (from lakes or the ocean). Deltas alsoÂ filterÂ water as it slowly makes its way through the delta's distributary network. This can reduce the impact ofÂ pollutionÂ flowing from upstream.\n\nDeltas are also important wetlandÂ habitats. Plants such as lilies and hibiscus grow in deltas, as well asÂ herbs such as wort, which are used in traditional medicines.\n\nMany, many animals areÂ indigenousÂ to the shallow, shifting waters of a delta. Fish,Â crustaceans such as oysters, birds, insects, and evenÂ apex predators such as tigers and bears can be part of a delta's ecosystem.\n\nNot all rivers form deltas. For a delta to form, the flow of a river must be slow and steady enough for silt to be deposited and build up. The Ok Tedi, in Papua New Guinea is one of the fastest-flowing rivers in the world. This river becomes a tributary of the Fly River. (The Fly, on the other hand, does form a rich delta as it empties into the Gulf of Papua, part of the Pacific Ocean.)\n\nA river will also not form a delta if exposed to powerfulÂ waves. The Columbia River in Canada and the United States, for instance, deposits enormous amounts of sediment into the Pacific Ocean, but strong waves and currents sweep the material away as soon as it is deposited.\n\nTides also limit where deltas can form. The Amazon, the largest river in the world, is without a delta. The tides of the Atlantic Ocean are too strong to allow silt to create a delta on the Amazon.\n\nTypes of Deltas\n\nThere are two major ways of classifying deltas. One considers the influences that create theÂ landform, while the other considers its shape.\n\nInfluence\n\nThere are four main types of deltas classified by the processes that control the build-up of silt: wave-dominated, tide-dominated, Gilbert deltas, and estuarine deltas.\n\nIn a wave-dominated delta, the movement of waves controls a delta's size and shape. The Nile delta (shaped by waves from the Mediterranean Sea) and Senegal delta (shaped by waves from the Atlantic Ocean) are both wave-dominated deltas.\n\nTide-dominated deltas usually form in areas with a largeÂ tidal range, or area betweenÂ high tideÂ andÂ low tide. TheÂ massiveÂ Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, in India and Bangladesh, is a tide-dominated delta, shaped by the rise and fall of tides in the Bay of Bengal.\n\nGilbert deltas are formed as rivers deposit large, coarse sediments. Gilbert deltas are usually confined to rivers emptying into freshwater lakes. They are usually steeper than the normal flatÂ plainÂ of a wave-dominated or tide-dominated delta. This type of delta was first identified by theÂ geologist Grove Karl Gilbert, who described mountain streams feedingÂ ancientÂ Lake Bonneville. (Utah's Great Salt Lake is the onlyÂ remnantÂ of Lake Bonneville.)\n\nEstuarine deltas form as a river does not empty directly into the ocean, but instead forms an estuary. AnÂ estuaryÂ is a partly enclosed wetland that features aÂ brackish waterÂ (part-saltwater, part-freshwater) habitat. The Yellow River forms an estuary, for instance, as it reaches the Bohai Sea off the coast of northern China.\n\nShape\n\nThe term delta comes from the upper-case Greek letter delta (Î), which is shaped like a triangle. Deltas with this triangular or fan shape are calledÂ arcuateÂ (arc-like) deltas. The Nile River forms an arcuate delta as it empties into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nStronger waves form aÂ cuspateÂ delta, which is more pointed than the arcuate delta, and is tooth-shaped. The Tiber River forms a cuspate delta as it empties into the Tyrrhenian Sea near Rome, Italy.\n\nNot all deltas are triangle-shaped. AÂ bird-foot deltaÂ has few, widely spaced distributaries, making it look like a bird's foot. The Mississippi River forms a bird-foot delta as it empties into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAnother untraditional looking delta is the inverted delta. The distributary network of an inverted delta is inland, while a single stream reaches the ocean or other body of water. The delta of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River in northern California is an inverted delta. The rivers and creeks of the Sacramento and San Joaquin distributary networks meet in Suisun Bay, before flowing to the Pacific Ocean through a singleÂ gapÂ in the Coast Range, the Carquinez Strait.\n\nInland deltas, which empty into a plain, are extremely rare. The Okavango delta in Botswana is probably the most well-knownâand so unusual it is recognized as one of the \"Seven Natural Wonders of Africa.\" Water from the Okavango River never reaches another body of water. The delta spreads water and silt across a flat plain in the Kalahari Desert before beingÂ evaporated.\n\nAnÂ abandoned deltaÂ forms as a river develops a new channel, leaving the other to dry up orÂ stagnate. This process is calledÂ avulsion. Avulsion occurs when the slope of a channel decreases and the sediment build-up increases. These forces allow the channel to overflow its banks orÂ levees and find a steeper, more direct route to the ocean or other body of water. The process of avulsion in deltaic lobes is calledÂ delta lobe switching. Over time, delta switching can create entirely new deltaic lobes. Delta switching has resulted in seven or eight distinct deltaic lobes of the Mississippi River over, at least, the past 5,000 years.\n\nDeltas and People\n\nDeltas are incredibly important to theÂ human geographyÂ of a region. They are important places forÂ tradeÂ andÂ commerce, for instance.\n\nThe booming city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, sits on the delta of the Fraser River as it empties into the Strait of Georgia, part of the Pacific Ocean. The Fraser delta helps make Vancouver one of the busiest, mostÂ cosmopolitanÂ ports in the world, where goods from the interior of Canada areÂ exported, and goods from around the world areÂ imported.\n\nThe Pearl River Delta, sometimes called the Delta of Guangdong, is another heavilyÂ urbanized river delta. The Pearl River delta is one of the fastest-growing centers of China's economy. The Pearl River delta includes both of China's two special administrative regions, the former BritishÂ colonyÂ of Hong Kong and the former Portuguese colony of Macau. Hong Kong and Macau are welcoming to western business, and provide an entryway to the ChineseÂ market. The Pearl River delta region is growing so quickly, it frequently experiencesÂ laborÂ shortages asÂ immigrants from the Chinese interior settle in the area, seeking a better life and higher wages.\n\nDeltas have a richÂ accumulationÂ of silt, so they are usuallyÂ fertileÂ agricultural areas. The world's largest delta is the GangesâBrahmaputra delta in India and Bangladesh, which empties into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh sits almost entirely on this delta. Fish, other seafood, andÂ crops such as rice and tea are the leading agricultural products of the delta.\n\nSimilarly, the inverted delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers in northern California is one of the most agriculturally rich areas in the U.S. TheÂ soilÂ supports crops from asparagus to zucchini, wine grapes to rice.\n\nDisappearing Deltas\n\nExtensiveÂ river managementÂ threatens deltas. River management involvesÂ monitoring andÂ administering a river's flow (often through the use ofÂ dams). River management increases the amount of land available for agricultural or industrialÂ development, and controls access to water for drinking,Â industry, andÂ irrigation.\n\nEngineers and government officials must consistently debate the interests of agriculture, industry, theÂ environment, and citizen safety and health when putting delta wetlands at risk.\n\nRiver management in Egypt hasÂ radicallyÂ altered the way land is farmed around the Nile delta, for instance. Construction of the Aswan Dam in the 1960s reduced annual flooding of the delta. This flooding had distributed silt and nutrients along the banks of the Nile. Today, Egypt is much more reliant onÂ fertilizers and irrigation. The Nile delta is also shrinking as a result of the Aswan Dam and other river management techniques. Without silt and other sediments toÂ fortifyÂ it in a prodelta, the waves of the Mediterranean Sea are eroding the delta faster than the Nile can replace it.\n\nIn the United States, dams on the Colorado River nearly prevent it from reaching its delta on the Sea of Cortez, Mexico. The ecosystem (what was once the world's largestÂ desertÂ estuary) has been reduced to a fraction of its former area, and many indigenous species are vulnerable, threatened, or endangered.\n\nFinally, decades of river managementÂ preventÂ the Mississippi River from naturally flowing through its delta wetlands. Like the Nile delta, the Mississippi delta is also eroding. According to Drawing Louisianaâs New Map 62 square kilometers (24 square miles) of wetland was lost each year between 1990 and 2000âthat's about one football field of mud washed into the Gulf of Mexico every 38 minutes. This situation contributed to the devastation caused byÂ Hurricane KatrinaÂ in 2005."
