Secondary to waist size, if you notice your thighs exceed the limit on our chart you may need to go up a size.\n\nTHIGH MEASUREMENT:\n\nMeasure around the widest area of the thigh.\n\nHIP MEASUREMENT:\n\nMeasure around the largest area of your hips, encapsulating the roundest part of your gluteus.\n\nMEASURING TIPS:\n\nFor the most accurate measurements, we suggest measuring as close to the skin as possible while wearing a non-padded, non-compression bra.\n\nCHEST MEASUREMENT:\n\nWrap the measuring tape around the widest point of the chest starting at the front and center of the torso.\n\nWAIST MEASUREMENT:\n\nMeasure around the body where the waistband of your pants normally sits.\n\nMEASURE YOUR RIB CAGE:\n\nMeasure around your rib cage just under your bust. Round down to the closest inch. This is your rib cage measurement, which you’ll need to figure out your band and cup size.\n\nFIGURE OUT YOUR BAND SIZE:\n\nTake your rib cage measurement from step 1 and read across the chart below to find your band size.\n\nFIGURE OUT YOUR CUP SIZE - THIS IS A 2-STEP PROCESS:\n\nFirst, measure around the fullest part of your bust. Keep the tape straight across your back. Round up to the nearest whole number. This is your bust measurement.\n\nNow, subtract your rib cage measurement (step 1) from your bust measurement (step 3). The difference in inches is your suggested cup size. If you’re between sizes, round up.\n\nFIT GUIDELINES:\n\nEvery bra serves a different purpose for different activities and we recommend referencing each specific bra product description to determine the best bra for your body and sport. Our bras should generally fit snug. Wearing the bras too loose will not likely provide adequate support.\n\n***Please note, a majority of our sports bras are medium support and medium coverage. If you are looking for the highest impact support that we offer; check out the X-Factor, Intensity or Moxie Sports Bra!\n\nMEASURING TIPS:\n\nWe have determined that your waist measurement will most likely dictate your size. Right on the edge between two sizes? You can utilize your thigh and hip measurements as secondary guidelines to help you find the perfect size.\n\nWAIST MEASUREMENT:\n\nMeasure around the smallest part of your torso, keeping the measuring tape as horizontal as possible.\n\nTHIGH MEASUREMENT:\n\nMeasure around widest area of the thigh.\n\nHIP MEASUREMENT:\n\nMeasure around the largest area of your hips, encapsulating the roundest part of your gluteus."
