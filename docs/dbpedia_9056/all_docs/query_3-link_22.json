        "text": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics\n\nIn the quest to identify a property that may reliably predict the spontaneity of a process, we have identified a very promising candidate: entropy. Processes that involve an increase in entropy of the system (ΔS > 0) are very often spontaneous; however, examples to the contrary are plentiful. By expanding consideration of entropy changes to include the surroundings, we may reach a significant conclusion regarding the relation between this property and spontaneity. In thermodynamic models, the system and surroundings comprise everything, that is, the universe, and so the following is true:\n\n[latex]\\Delta {S}_{\\text{univ}}=\\Delta {S}_{\\text{sys}}+\\Delta {S}_{\\text{surr}}[/latex]\n\nTo illustrate this relation, consider again the process of heat flow between two objects, one identified as the system and the other as the surroundings. There are three possibilities for such a process:\n\nThe objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the hotter to the cooler object. This is always observed to occur spontaneously. Designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the definition of entropy yields the following:\n\n[latex]\\Delta {S}_{\\text{sys}}=\\dfrac{-{q}_{\\text{rev}}}{{T}_{\\text{sys}}}\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad\\Delta {S}_{\\text{surr}}=\\dfrac{{q}_{\\text{rev}}}{{T}_{\\text{surr}}}[/latex]\n\nThe magnitudes of qrev and –qrev are equal, their opposite arithmetic signs denoting the loss of heat by the system and the gain of heat by the surroundings. Since Tsys > Tsurr in this scenario, the entropy decrease of the system will be less than the entropy increase of the surroundings, and so the entropy of the universe will increase:\n\n[latex]\\lvert \\Delta S_{sys} \\rvert < \\lvert \\Delta S_{surr} \\rvert [/latex]\n\n[latex]\\Delta S_{univ} = \\Delta S_{sys} + \\Delta S_{surr} > 0 [/latex]\n\nThe objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the cooler to the hotter object. This is never observed to occur spontaneously. Again designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the definition of entropy yields the following:\n\n[latex]\\Delta {S}_{\\text{sys}}=\\dfrac{{q}_{\\text{rev}}}{{T}_{\\text{sys}}} [/latex] and [latex]\\Delta {S}_{\\text{surr}}=\\dfrac{-{q}_{\\text{rev}}}{{T}_{\\text{surr}}}[/latex]\n\nThe arithmetic signs of qrev denote the gain of heat by the system and the loss of heat by the surroundings. The magnitude of the entropy change for the surroundings will again be greater than that for the system, but in this case, the signs of the heat changes (that is, the direction of the heat flow) will yield a negative value for ΔSuniv. This process involves a decrease in the entropy of the universe.\n\nThe objects are at essentially the same temperature, Tsys ≈ Tsurr, and so the magnitudes of the entropy changes are essentially the same for both the system and the surroundings. In this case, the entropy change of the universe is zero, and the system is at equilibrium.\n\n[latex]\\lvert \\Delta S_{sys} \\rvert \\approx \\lvert \\Delta S_{surr} \\rvert [/latex]\n\n[latex]\\Delta S_{univ} = \\Delta S_{sys} + \\Delta S_{surr} = 0 [/latex]\n\nThese results lead to a profound statement regarding the relation between entropy and spontaneity known as the second law of thermodynamics: all spontaneous changes cause an increase in the entropy of the universe. A summary of these three relations is provided in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. The Second Law of Thermodynamics ΔSuniv > 0 spontaneous ΔSuniv < 0 nonspontaneous (spontaneous in opposite direction) ΔSuniv = 0 reversible (system is at equilibrium)\n\nFor many realistic applications, the surroundings are vast in comparison to the system. In such cases, the heat gained or lost by the surroundings as a result of some process represents a very small, nearly infinitesimal, fraction of its total thermal energy. For example, combustion of a fuel in air involves transfer of heat from a system (the fuel and oxygen molecules undergoing reaction) to surroundings that are infinitely more massive (the earth’s atmosphere). As a result, qsurr is a good approximation of qrev, and the second law may be stated as the following:\n\n[latex]\\Delta {S}_{\\text{univ}}=\\Delta {S}_{\\text{sys}}+\\Delta {S}_{\\text{surr}}=\\Delta {S}_{\\text{sys}}+\\dfrac{{q}_{\\text{surr}}}{T}[/latex]\n\nWe may use this equation to predict the spontaneity of a process as illustrated in Example 1.\n\nThe Third Law of Thermodynamics\n\nThe previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal (W = 1). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero.\n\n[latex]S=k\\text{ln}W=k\\text{ln}\\left(1\\right)=0[/latex]\n\nThis limiting condition for a system’s entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.\n\nCareful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance’s entropy and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions. Standard entropies ([latex]{S}^{\\circ}[/latex]) are for one mole of substance under standard conditions (a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 298.15 K. The standard entropy change (ΔS°) for any process may be computed from the standard entropies of its reactant and product species like the following:\n\n[latex]\\Delta S ^{\\circ} =\\sum \\nu {S}^{\\circ }\\text{(products)}-\\sum \\nu {S}^{\\circ }\\text{(reactants)}[/latex]\n\nHere, [latex]\\nu[/latex] represents stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation representing the process. For example, ΔS° for the following reaction at room temperature [latex]m\\text{A}+n\\text{B}\\longrightarrow x\\text{C}+y\\text{D}[/latex] is computed as the following:\n\n[latex]=\\left[x{S}^{\\circ }\\left(\\text{C}\\right)+y{S}^{\\circ }\\left(\\text{D}\\right)\\right]-\\left[m{S}^{\\circ }\\left(\\text{A}\\right)+n{S}^{\\circ }\\left(\\text{B}\\right)\\right][/latex]\n\nTable 2 lists some standard entropies at 298.15 K. You can find additional standard entropies in Standard Thermodynamic Properties for Selected Substances.\n\nTable 2.
