        "text": "Editor's note: Delta shared several updates to its SkyMiles Program on Oct. 18, modifying some of the changes announced in September and adding several new benefits. Read the full story at the link below:\n\nDelta is simplifying its award-winning SkyMiles Program, with Medallion Qualification Dollars serving as the only qualifier for Medallion Status.\n\nAs you learn about all the ways to earn those MQDs toward Status —with flights, the MQD Boost benefit on select American Express Cards, car rentals and stays and Delta Vacations experiences — here are several things you should remember about the program and what changes for you.\n\nThese changes won’t impact your 2024 Medallion Status — just how you earn for 2025.\n\nStatus for 2024 is earned in 2023. These changes are first applicable in 2024 toward 2025 Status.\n\nMembers won’t lose any Rollover MQMs accrued — you’ll have options to convert them.\n\nIn early 2024, SkyMiles Members will be given a choice of converting any Rollover MQMs earned during 2023 to redeemable miles, MQDs, or a combination of both. Links to the selection page will be shared with Members via email, and customers will also be able to access the conversion page through the My SkyMiles page on Delta.com and the Fly Delta app.\n\nMillion Milers move up in Complimentary Upgrade priority.\n\nDelta has refreshed its Complimentary Upgrade process for 2024, and Million Miler Status will move up in the hierarchy for Complimentary Upgrades to the third priority position.\n\nMillion Miler Status will calculate through lifetime flight miles.\n\nBeginning Jan. 1, 2024, miles toward Million Miler Status will calculate through lifetime flight miles and no longer through MQMs. We will continue to track the miles you fly with us, and those who accumulate 1 million flight miles will be invited to join the Million Miler Program. Members’ MQM balances already earned toward Million Miler Status will remain, and flight miles will be added to these.\n\nFor Delta SkyMiles American Express Card Members: MQD Waiver and Status Boost will end on Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nGiven the streamlined changes to the Program and the introduction of the new MQD Boost benefit for select Delta SkyMiles American Express Cards, both the MQD Waiver and Status Boost benefits will end on Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nFor the first time, SkyMiles Members living outside of the U.S. will now earn Status via MQDs.\n\nUntil now, Members outside the U.S. earned Status based on MQMs or MQSs. Starting Jan. 1, currencies convert to USD at the standard exchange rate and will then convert from $1 USD to $1 MQD."
