You will have a redress number if you have applied for DHS TRIP.\n\nBooking Travel with a Redress Control Number\n\nIf you don't have a redress number and an airline or a travel site asks for your redress number, you can leave it blank.\n\nIf you do not have a redress number, you will still be able to make reservations and travel as normal. The redress number is an optional field and is not relevant for most travelers\n\nYou may provide your redress number when you make a reservation or when updating your airline profile."
