N2 - Two approximate methods, K-matrix (91 channels) and Normalized Born (13 channels), are discussed and applied to the calculation of excitation cross sections and rate coefficients for transitions from excited states n = 2, 3 to states with n' = 2, 3, 4 in He atoms. The ionization cross sections are also calculated by the Normalized Born method. Cross sections and rate coefficients for transitions from n = 2 are compared with those obtained by the simple Born and the more sophisticated convergent close-coupling method.
