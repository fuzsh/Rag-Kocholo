Suzy (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to attend ballet school. When she arrives, late on a stormy night, no one lets her in, and she sees Pat (Eva Ax√©n), another student, fleeing from the school. When Pat reaches her apartment, she is murdered. The next day, Suzy is admitted to her new school, but has a difficult time settling in. She hears noises, and often feels ill. As more people die, Suzy uncovers the terrifying secret history of the place.

This Dario Argento horror classic was remade in 2018 in a very different, but also critically acclaimed version by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me By Your Name) and has already been featured on FanFare.

This film, while Italian made, was shot in the international/multi-language style that was the norm for Italian genre films of the time. That is to say, American actors like Harper spoke their lines in English, German actors spoke in German, Italian actors spoke in Italian. There is no single "original" language version as every version features at least some actors dubbed.

The original is rated 93% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.

What makes [Suspiria] especially effective is how they use horror to make a point about educational institutions' enforcement of gender hegemony to interrogate conventional femininity. - Alyx Vesey, Bitch Media

What lingers is not a sense of evil but exhilaration in how far Argento and his fellow filmmakers were willing to go to shock and delight; the movie's sheer exuberance is the cinematic equivalent of a blood transfusion. - Adam Nayman, The Ringer

There are horror films that scare and there are horror films that quake the senses; Suspiria still rattles twenty-five years after its original release. - Ed Gonzalez, Slant Magazine
