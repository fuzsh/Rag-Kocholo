        "text": "The original UK cinema version was cut by the BBFC with edits made to the opening heart stabbing murder, Sara's throat being slashed, and a dog savaging the blind man's throat, and the 1990 Entertainment In Video release featured the same print. The 1998 Nouveaux video was uncut but suffered from a poor print transfer, and all later releases were widescreen and intact.\n\nSome prints featuring the 95-minute American edit of the film (with the most extreme moments of violence removed) also feature another segment cut out of the film: the scenes where Daniel's dog attacks the little boy off-screen and Daniel is thrown out of the school (approximately three minutes in total, compared to the uncut 98-minute version) are completely missing, therefore making the reason for his death a mystery.\n\nThe original (and only) version released in Italy is approx. 95 minutes long (98 minutes including credits). Contrary to popular belief there is no longer 107 minutes director's cut: this rumor started because of an erroneous publicity slogan on some US trailers. The US posters for the movie featured the tagline \"The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 80\" (80+12 = 92 minutes, i.e. the approx. length of the original US theatrical release, minus credits). The voiceover on some US trailers misread the quote as \"The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92\", thus suggesting that the complete film was 12 minutes longer than it really is. Some reviewers took this as an indicator that the film had originally been available in a longer version and circulated the 107 minutes version myth (107=95+12). The trailer with the wrong '12+92' slogan is included on the Japanese DVD version."
