        "text": "Hey, guys. My name is Dice Rollen. Today we’re going to be taking a look at some facts you didn’t know about the Argento classic that brought us witches, ballet and technicolor nightmares. Suspiria was written and directed by Dario Argento and follows an American student as she attends a German ballet academy with a sinister secret.\n\nSo without further ado, these are some things you didn’t know about Suspiria.\n\nONSCREEN\n\nArgento had Luciano Tovoli watch Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarves to give him an idea of the color scheme he wanted for Suspiria.\n\nThe dance academy wasn’t real. It was constructed on a studio lot in Rome and was based on a late-gothic landmark in Freiburg known as Haus zum Walfisch. Or Whale House.\n\nThe whispering voice we hear throughout Golbin’s scoring belongs to Claudio Simonetti who has said that he was just saying gibberish.\n\nYou may have noticed a certain child-like quality to the students in the ballet school. The reason for this is that Dario Argento had planned for the academy to be for girls 12 or younger. However due to the concept of children being involved with violence Salvatore Argento made him change this. And Argento did, but didn’t alter his script. Something else that he included was having the doorknobs in the school level with the actress’s heads to make them seem smaller and more child-like.\n\nDuring the scene in which maggots fall onto the actress’s heads the crew used rice instead of real creepy crawlies.\n\nFor the swimming pool scene Argento told Harper and Casini to disturb the water as little as possible. This was to give the scene a more tranquil look.\n\nIn the scene in which Sara in ensnared in barbed wire no actual barbed wire was used. However Stefania Casini still got pinched quite a lot by the wire.\n\nUdo Kier really didn’t get much time to prepare for his role. In order to help him with his lines a crew member laid behind the bench that he and Jessica Harper sat on and read Kier’s lines to him.\n\nThe phrase that Professor Milius uses, ‘Quoddam semper, quoddam ubique, quoddam ab omnibus creditum est’ translates to ‘Always, everywhere, some are believed by all’.\n\nSpeaking of translations and meanings, suspiria means ‘to sigh’, ‘sighed’ or ‘whispered’.\n\nWhile the movie is set in Freiburg, Germany there are some distinct Munich landmarks. Such as the BMW tower and Königsplatz.\n\nThe glass bird figure that Suzy knocks over and takes a tail feather from to use as a weapon could be a nod to The Bird with the Crystal Plumage.\n\nLela Svasta, who played Helena Markos, was not an actress. She was a 90 year old former prostitute that Argento picked out in Rome.\n\nSuspiria serves as the first in Argento’s trilogy of the Three Mothers. The others are Inferno and Mother of Tears.\n\nBTS\n\nOne of the reasons why Argento decided to make Suspiria was because he was inspired by Nicolodi’s grandmother. She had told him that she fled from a German music academy because witchcraft was being secretly practiced there.\n\nMore inspiration came from a dream that Nicolodi herself had. In this dream she came across an invisible witch and a panther that was in the room exploded. And in the finale of the film there is a porcelain panther that explodes.\n\nEva Axén was on set for over a week to finish her scenes.\n\nThe role of Suzy Bannion was originally written for Daria Nicolodi, but the studio requested that the character be played by an American actress for it to be more marketable. Nicolodi still made an appearance during the airport scene and even did some voice acting for Helena Markos.\n\nTina Aumont was offered the role of Suzy Bannion, however she declined due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nAccording to Argento there are two main reasons why he chose Jessica Harper for the role of Suzy. One is because he saw her in Phantom of the Paradise and the other is because of her big eyes.\n\nAnd Harper turned down a part in Annie Hall in order to take the role.\n\nOne of the reasons that Argento cast Joan Bennett was due to her previous association with Fritz Lang as Argento admired him.\n\nDavid Wilde, Joan Bennett’s husband urged her to accept the part of Madame Blanc because he was a fan of The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. Bennett wasn’t thrilled about the violence in the script, but took the role anyway. Wilde essentially gave her an all-expenses paid trip to Italy in return. But the Italian film-making process wasn’t a terribly great experience for her as one day she was ready for shooting by 12:30pm. But had to wait five hours before the crew was prepared.\n\nGerman and Italian were the primary languages spoken by the actors which caused some language barriers between them. However this wasn’t a problem for the film otherwise since, as is common for Italian movies, all dialog was dubbed in post. Because of this the sound quality on set during shooting didn’t matter which. For Jessica Harper this was quite strange.\n\nArgento would blast Goblin’s music at full volume on set in order to get a truly unsettled and scared reaction from the actors.\n\nBarbara Magnolfi has stated that she believes Olga was a witch in training. There was actually a scene that was in the script, but not filmed, where she performed with the Bolshoi while the other students were in town.\n\nRudolf Schündler didn’t speak English or even Italian so in order to let Jessica Harper know when he finished his line he would lightly tap his foot against her leg. Harper stated that she did her best to not only mess up her lines, but to keep a straight face during this scene.\n\nJessica Harper has stated that for her the most frightening part of the movie was during the climax. Where a variety of things are exploding and shattering around her as she ran. A number of the rigged explosions went off close to her.\n\nSuspiria was shot in a little over four months.\n\nA common misconception about how Suspiria was shot is that the three-strip Technicolor process was used. This isn’t quite the case as it was filmed using Eastmancolor Kodak and printed using the Technicolor process.\n\nAfter the movie was finished Technicolor Rome dismantled the only remaining three-strip equipment.\n\nDario Argento believes that Suspiria is a lesbian story. He’s stated that he ‘wasn’t primarily interested in the theme of motherhood but, rather, in women’s lives. In fact, if you want to give a deeper reading of the film, it can be seen as a vaguely lesbian story; where lesbianism has a certain importance, or, more precisely, where the relationships between women are sometimes of a lesbian nature and are characterized by power struggles. There aren’t any male characters to speak of in the film. All there is are power relations between women.’"
