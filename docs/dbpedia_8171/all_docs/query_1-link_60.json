        "text": "No one will argue that Suspiria is the greatest story ever told. It’s plot - about a dance school run by a coven of witches - is dreamlike (or, more accurately, nightmarish) at best and borderline incomprehensible at worst. But many - myself included - believe that it’s perhaps the most gorgeous horror film ever put on celluloid. Between the colorful lighting, the opulent production design, and the extravagant set pieces, any frame of Suspiria could be hung on a wall and appreciated as a piece of art.\n\nSuspiria is directed by Italian master of horror Dario Argento (Deep Red, Tenebrae), who co-wrote the script with his then-partner and frequent muse, Daria Nicolodi. Both before and after his 1977 opus, Argento predominantly made films in the giallo genre, the Italian murder-mystery thrillers that he helped popularize. Stylistically, Suspiria feels like an extension of his giallo work, down to the elaborate murder sequences. Rather than an intricate procedural story, however, Suspiria explores the supernatural and embraces a fairy tale-style narrative.\n\nThe simplistic plot follows Suzy Bannon (Jessica Harper, Phantom of the Paradise), an American ballet student who enrolls in a prestigious German dance academy. The moment she arrives, a pair of students are viciously murdered in the elaborate opening set piece. Odd occurrences continue to revolve around Suzy throughout the film, ranging from death and disappearance to maggots and razor wire to drugs and witchcraft. While Harper carries the film with her childlike innocence, other notable faces in the cast include Joan Bennett (Dark Shadows), Udo Kier (Blade), and Rudolf Schündler (The Exorcist).\n\nSuspiria has been painstakingly restored and remastered in 4K from the uncut Italian 35mm camera negative by Synapse Films. Director of photography Luciano Tovoli (Murder by Numbers, Single White Female) supervised the process, which included a new, more accurate color correction. The film’s memorable lighting has never shone so vibrantly. Inspired by Disney’s classic animated version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Luciano bathed the frame in vibrant primary colors.\n\nAlthough not mentioned quite as often as the lighting, Giuseppe Bassan’s (Deep Red, Tenebrae) production design is equally as stunning and integral to the majestic beauty of Suspiria. The particular wallpaper patterns, M.C. Escher-style geometrical murals, ornate architecture, and unique props that adorn each room in the academy make every set interesting to look at before a character even steps into frame. The baroque details are even more apparent in the new transfer.\n\nBeyond a visual masterpiece, Suspiria’s individuality extends to its sound design. The diverse soundtrack by frequent Argento composers Goblin (Dawn of the Dead, Deep Red) includes grooving prog rock, pounding tribal music, screeching synthesizers, wailing voices, ominous whispers, and the lullaby-esque main theme, which is peppered throughout the film. The enveloping audio is presented in a 4.0 English-language LCRS sound mix, not heard since the original theatrical release, along with the Italian 5.1 surround sound mix.\n\nLike most Italian pictures of the era, Suspiria was largely filmed without sync sound. This allows for production to work at a more efficient pace, but it necessitates all of the voices to be dubbed in during post-production. Harper thankfully provided her own voice, but the majority of the other actors - several of whom spoke in their native Italian or German on set - were dubbed by American actors. This disconnect, despite occasionally adding unintended camp to the performances, only furthers the film’s surreal quality.\n\nSynapse released its long-awaited Suspiria restoration as a limited edition SteelBook in late 2017. It quickly sold out, so the company has re-issued the transfer as a two-disc Blu-ray edition. It includes all the same special features sans the bells and whistles (no SteelBook packaging, soundtrack CD, or collector’s booklet). It features cover art by Joel Robinson, with the original poster art on the reverse side. Standard, single-disc Blu-ray and DVD versions are also available.\n\nIn addition to the option to play the film with either the original Italian or English opening and closing credit sequences via seamless branching, the first disc of Synapse Films’ Blu-ray set offers two new audio commentaries. One features expert/author Troy Howarth, while the other has scholars Derek Botelho and David Del Valle. Despite some overlap in content, both are well-researched and informative listens.\n\nThe second disc is dedicated to extras. Actress Barbara Magnolfi, who plays Olga, is the only cast or crew member involved, but she gives a solid interview. A new, 27-minute retrospective finds various experts - ranging from journalists to authors to industry professionals - analyzing and appreciating the film. There’s also a thorough, 30-minute visual essay by Michael Mackenzie; a featurette highlighting the film’s German shooting locations and connections; original trailers, TV spots, and radio spots; and the alternate U.S. opening credits featuring the memorable “breathing letters.”\n\nIn the aforementioned visual essay, the author waxes poetic about being unable to replicate his first viewing of Suspiria. While it’s true that being engulfed by Argento’s sensory overload is a singular experience, watching Synapse Films’ presentation is like seeing Suspiria for the first time again. More than just one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year, this remarkable restoration marks a milestone of the format."
