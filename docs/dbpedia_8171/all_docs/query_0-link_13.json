        "text": "How rubbish: not another remake? Hold on, though, hold on. Luca Guadagino is in a rich vein of form, with I Am Love (2010), with Tilda Swinton, A Bigger Splash (2015), with Tilda Swinton again and Dakota Johnson and itself a remake of the French picture La Piscine and the widely liked Call Me By Your Name (2017). Originally he nabbed the English-language remake rights and passed the directorial chair to David Gordon Green but Green’s film fell through and Guadagino got his A Bigger Splash screenwriter David Kajganich, someone with form for writing horror and soon to adapt Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, to hammer out his own script.\n\nI can’t remember much about the Dario Argento original other than the colours, the rain and that I really enjoyed it. The early Argento films seem full of life and derangement and remember that he also had a hand in the script for Once Upon A Time In The West for Leone back in 1968. There was a recent poll for the BBC of the best foreign language films ever made and plenty of critics seemed very taken with his Suspiria, putting it in their own top 10. The version that I’ve seen was all in English, to match Jessica Harper’s dialogue, but Italian films at the time were often dubbed in later, due sometimes to laziness or it being just the way, so as to avoid having to worry about capturing sound on location, but, in this case, due also to the filming between actors all speaking their own languages at each other so there’s probably an Italian-language version that’s been widely seen too.\n\nIt’s impossible to know for sure but I suspect that many critics – given the wide ‘love it or hate it’ reactions to this new film – have been reviewing Argento’s original at least as much, if not more, than this new version. This kind of comes with the territory if you’re going to remake a film so you’re making a rod for your own back but I wonder whether my lack of familiarity with Argento’s version helped me to love this re-do?\n\nGuadagino calls it a ‘cover version’ more than a remake and it being about an hour longer suggests that it used Argento’s film as somewhat of a jumping off point more than a sacred text. It’s set again in the Berlin of 1977 and there’s the wall in the background (I’ve never been to Berlin so I’m guessing that some parts of the wall were protected under historical purposes) and there’s a lot about the Red Army Faction (make sure to watch Uli Edel’s The Baader Meinhof Complex for more background) in the media.\n\nNever trust a trailer but the first trailer made me excited in that it seemed like the film, this 2018 version, was marinated in 1970s film conventions. That can only give me joy since my favourite film period is the late 1950s to 1977 (ending with Sorcerer, once Star Wars came into view) and Suspiria did prove out as such in the finished film. I’d imagine Berlin, especially the 1970s Berlin of Bowie’s Low, “Heroes” and Lodger (although only “Heroes” was entirely written and created in Berlin, with Low mainly in France and Lodger mainly made in Switzerland, I think), as this grey and this washed out, as opposed to the vibrant colour schemes in Argento’s work.\n\nThis is Tilda Swinton’s third film with Guadagino, and – having learned Italian for ‘I Am Love’ and then speaking German, French, along with her English here – her fourth language. Other non-natives also speak a convincing German and sometimes French. I love this technique; this serious application. One of my bugbears is American or British films that place native characters in other countries but they have them speaking accented English to each other. It’s a convention; it’s a device; it’s commonplace so you get over it, like sitting next to someone on crowded public transport and they smell: you just tune it out like an uninteresting radio station but it can be an irritant. David Fincher’s The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo has a lot going for it but Swedish characters, in Sweden, speaking English with each other? I say no.\n\nThere are ways around it. Often you get native characters speaking to each other in their native language but then switching to English when interacting with our protagonist (our eyes and ears). Or you have other tricks, like John Huston’s The Kremlin Letter wherein the character talks but then overdubs their dialogue in English on top of it. Or The Hunt for Red October, where characters start talking in Russian; the camera tracks in on their mouth and then, once it tracks back, they magically start speaking in English. Or in Valkyrie, you have Tom Cruise’s character’s voiceover in German gradually start to fade away, replaced by English.\n\nI don’t know: I once asked Juliette Binoche whether she got annoyed by playing a French character, in France, but speaking English in ‘Chocolat’ and she said that it wasn’t important; she didn’t think about it. That’s her right, I suppose, since she received snide remarks for her very pronounced French-accented English in 1992’s Wuthering Heights and she turned around, worked hard, and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar a couple of years later, acting in English for The English Patient. Also, it might help to think of a film as a play. A production on the stage in, say, Oxfordshire might be set in Japan or Russia and you’ve got to have only accented-English or else the thing won’t work at all. Yet I think that the time will come soon when having a native character speak accented English might seem as painfully anachronistic as a white actor playing Shakespeare’s Othello in blackface, as done by Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier and others. Even prestige TV takes this seriously now, with Killing Eve’s antagonist speaking a number of different languages.\n\nOne of the matrons in Suspiria was played by French-Italian actress Sylvie Testud and she learned German, sign language and the clarinet for her film Beyond Silence (1996) and, if memory serves, she learned some Japanese for for ‘Fear and Trembling’. The hilarious documentary, about the abortive attempt by Terry Gilliam to film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote the first time, called Lost In La Mancha, told us that late French actor Jean Rochefort spent nine months learning English for the part. It can go the other way, if more rarely. A post-Secrets and Lies Brenda Blethyn learned French for her role in ‘London River‘, for example.\n\nMaybe I’ve got a complex about this due to being a Briton and seeing my country fall for the three card monte of Brexit. I feel that one of the main drivers of this national self-punishment was British feelings of inadequacy at hearing others speak languages with ease. I once read somewhere that only three out of ten Brits can hold a conversation in a second language whereas over the rest of Europe, it’s more like seven out of ten. Language learning is poor in this country. Hopefully it’ll be one area in which there’ll be a vast improvement in order to fight back against Brexit. Even if Brexit doesn’t happen the underlying causes will still need urgent attention. I’m making my own contribution by studying Spanish and French for myself. Still, I once heard a story about two women trying to understand each other on the phone: one was from Newcastle, the other from Exeter but they somehow fell into speaking French to each other and found that easier to communicate than speaking their native English.\n\nAll of the British and American performers who speak languages other than English in this 2018 film entirely convince. I bet Juliette Binoche still has an English-language consultant on speed dial since it’s one thing to speak a language and another thing to act in it and no doubt they were also on the set of Suspiria here too.\n\nDakota Johnson also took classes in ballet and other dance. So when you hear actors drone on about the preparation and research – all on ‘someone else’s dime’, as the Americans say – sometimes actors really do do the work. After all, why not? Imagine being able to learn a new skill and charging it to your employer instead of you? How brilliant.\n\nAnyway, what you’re looking at here is a supernatural horror so, straight away, this won’t be for everyone but I thought that it worked very well and although I don’t subscribe to identity politics any longer, it is refreshing that it is also is a compelling film with women in the lead and supporting roles, with very few men around to do the heavy lifting. It’s very violent but women might more in touch with those feelings than many think, considering that it’s they who go through the turmoil of giving birth, not men. It is long, though. The film is looooooooooooong. Nothing against long films, per se. Every film has its own internal rhythm. The Godfather Part II; Lawrence of Arabia; Shoah: these are all inordinately long films which never, ever felt to me like they were marking time or were any longer than they should have been but you do find yourself dancing from one buttock to the other buttock as you try to make your way over the finishing line so be prepared.\n\nThat aside, I liked the film greatly and want to see both this again and Argento’s original. As a sidebar, for another great film set in Berlin, try the magnificent ‘Possession‘. Oh, and Thom Yorke does some sterling work in his musical score, following in the footsteps of Radiohead compadre Jonny Greenwood’s work for Paul Thomas Anderson’s films but on the way home I played Tago Mago by German giants ‘Can’. Although it’s a favourite, it never sounded so apposite, having seen Suspiria: all of the funk; drum-thunder; Gregorian chanting; violin-sawing; noise; screaming and madness sounded most appropriate after that two and a half hours.\n\n*************************\n\nMoney and the Hammer’s Main Pages"
