        "text": "Captivating, bizarre, yet disturbing, the movie Suspiria takes you into the realm of evil. Although it’s a good film for horror fans, the movie doesn’t deliver fast enough to excite and frighten lovers of the genre. Instead, the witchcraft that’s implied gets lost in the beauty and rigor of the dance. That said, when you do finally get to the terror, for the target fans it’s a good presentation of typical gore and extreme evil violence.\n\nDancer Patricia (Chloe Grace Moretz) has been lead performer for Markos Dance Academy in 1977 West Berlin under the tutelage of Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton) for some time. However, she has become unhinged from being completely engrossed in her dance character and a fear that the school is involved in witchcraft. To her troupe of dancers, Blanc tells them Patricia has gone missing and possibly joined the revolution taking place in the city. Patricia no longer with the dance troupe, Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) from Ohio, USA gets noticed by Blanc for her ferocious dance style. She envisions her as a possible lead role in her new dance recital “Volk”. She offers her a chance to join the troupe and Susie gives a convincing performance.\n\nThe film goes on from there adding a side story involving Psychotherapist Jozef Klemperer and his involvement with the Academy through both Patricia and then a Russian dance student named Olga (Elena Fokina). Director Luca Guadagnino utilizes Tilda Swinton’s abilities beyond Madame Blanc to perform the roles of Klemperer, and later the witch conveyer Mother Helena Markos a disgusting aged woman covered in awful skin growths and evil cankers.\n\nUsing a lot of dance to introduce the subjects and setup the future finale, Guadagnino introduces his characters in rehearsals and recitals. The beauty of the dance should attract upcoming ballerinas, but only if they think modern and combative. The music will wears on the average viewer and combined with the repetitious movements of the dancers turn into a metronome for monotony. However, unless you are a die hard modern dancer or someone looking for another Black Swan, it should deliver a somewhat adventurous spirit.\n\nSwinton actually caries the film on her back with a “trio” of performances that are terrific. She’s Madame Blanc, the “mother” of the troupe, and with that comes a stern face that rarely cracks a smile (unless it’s an evil one). Her demeanor embodies her character with a malevolent streak, especially showing when the girls are working the routine of “Volk” being played out on the rehearsal floor.\n\nAs the elderly German psychotherapist Klemperer who escaped the holocaust, Swinton shows his sadness in his eyes while he interviews subjects from Madame Blanc’s dance group. Later it turns to happiness when his mysterious wife comes into play. But, there’s more to that character I’d like to know, but even with a two and a half hour film, Klemperer is just a sidebar in the script.\n\nDressing in a ghastly rubber suit as the primordial Mother Helena Markos, there’s not much for Swinton to do except flay her arms around letting the fake skin do all the work. I will say, however, it would have made a super Halloween costume for sure. And congrats to the costume/make-up crew as it actually looks as professional as Jabba the Hutt.\n\nBONUS FEATURES:\n\n“The Making of Suspiria” director Luca Guadagnino explains the movie and why he wanted to make the film. Actors Mia Goth, Renee Southendijk, Dakota Johnson,\n\n“The Secret Language of the Dance” choreographer Damien Jalet, Dakota Johnson, Mia Goth talk about the main dances that are shown in the film.\n\n“The Transformations of Suspiria” prosthetics artist Mark Coulier, talk about the prosthetics special effects and make-up of the broken arms, pulling opening a chest, blood squirting out of a neck, and much more.\n\nSuspiria has been rated R by the MPAA for disturbing content involving ritualistic violence, bloody images and graphic nudity, and for some language including sexual references. Not for the squeamish or fearful the film does achieve points of cruel depravity, pernicious nudity and bone snapping body parts. The film has just been released on Blu-ray.\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS: Horror fans should stick with it for an ending surprise. (3 out of 5 Stars)"
