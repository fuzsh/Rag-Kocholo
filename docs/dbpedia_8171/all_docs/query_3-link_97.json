        "text": "A couple of Twitter reactions to the first footage shown at CinemaCon. More at the link. Was trending briefly so it must have made quite an impression.\n\n[quote]Ummm I am traumatized after seeing a scene from \"Suspiria\" in which Dakota Johnson controls the body of another woman as she dances. The woman's body literally cracks in half. She is like, torn apart. Spitting, urinating, bleeding. It's... A lot.\n\n[quote]Someone at my table threw their napkin down, said “uh, no”, and walked out.\n\n[quote]Ummm I am traumatized after seeing a scene from \"Suspiria\" in which Dakota Johnson controls the body of another woman as she dances. The woman's body literally cracks in half. She is like, torn apart. Spitting, urinating, bleeding. It's... A lot.\n\nThis yawnfest scene is supposed to happen in an exclusive dance academy? The original scene of Alida Valli barking orders to Suzy (in badly dubbed English) over strange music while she had a nose bleed was truly terrifying.\n\nR16 I just don't see the point of a remake unless it is to capitalise on what made the original so good and try to push beyond that. Add your own touch, sure, but why not just make a new movie and plot if you're going to change everything about the original?\n\nThe only way I could understand it is if the original was based on a book or something, and they went back to the source material to reinterpret it.\n\nThe poster is HORRIBLE! Is that supposed to make people excited to see it?\n\nHowever, the description of the clip sounds kinda nuts and I like nutty movies. I think the best way to remake a movie like Suspiria is to take the basic story \"American goes to international dance school and crazy, witchy shit happens\" and run with it. It's not like the original script was some great work of art. It was just a skeleton to hang some incredibly impressive and creepy set pieces on. In fact, if we're being honest, it's one of Argento's worst scripts. Deep Red and Tenebrae are actually fairly clever and well written.\n\nThe script was based on a tale Daria Nicolodi's grandmother used to tell her as a child. The school it was based on was a Rudolph Steiner academy of music and arts near the French/Swiss boarder.\n\n[quote] Once upon a time, a teenage girl named Yvonne was sent away from home to attend a boarding school. Her parents believed she was going to a reputable place, a stolid institution where a budding talent like hers would receive valid instruction in the arts. The girl arrived, wide-eyed and innocent, and was terrified to realize she had been delivered into a witches' den, a school of Black Magic. She turned tail and ran. Unlike her fairy tale counterparts Hansel and Gretel, Yvonne was a real girl, and she escaped to tell her tale. This she did, to her own granddaughter, an actress and screenwriter by the name of Daria Nicolodi. As it happened, Nicolodi was the creative and romantic partner of Italy's dark wizard of cinema, Dario Argento, so Yvonne's tale was destined for bigger things.\n\nDakota Johnson is Hollywood Royalty and will probably end up with an Oscar.\n\nShe is rather unremarkable but then again so was her mother in anything other than WORKING GIRL.\n\nHopefully Dakota will get a vehicle like that to catapult her.\n\nSure, millions of people love spending time in the dark with nudity-friendly Dakota Johnson but she needs better material and some acting classes.\n\nAlmost no chance of any subtlety happening here. The two original films were filled with subtext (the squeal Inferno has enough subtext for 10 different films), like the scene where Sarah is at the creepy old library looking for the book, or when the sinister butler gives Daria Nicolodi an enormous injection of what appears to be some kind of heavy drug, but I read somewhere that it was actually meant to be a B-vitamin injection her was administering to her and it was left up to the audience to read that something evil was happening in the scene.\n\nRio hasn't been filmed yet R73 but it's expected to start soon.\n\nI'm all for this new, revamped Suspiria. For fans of the original, and I count myself as one of them, it's a treat to get a remake that's, after all, a polar opposite in some key aspects and doesn't try (and fail) to imitate the original. Maybe we'll hate it, who knows, but I love how different it looks.\n\nYeah, what the fuck happened to Argento?\n\nI mean, he has a very impressive run for two decades and then he TOTALLY hits the wall and EVERY film is TERRIBLE... I mean, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was one of the worst films ever (that dubbing and the \"acting\"!) and they all have sucked donkey balls since then. STENDAHL SYNDROME was OK, SLEEPLESS was OK and THE CARD PLAYER had some decent moments, but stuff like GIALLO and MOTHER OF TEARS and DRACULA 3D are putrid compared to his earlier work (or anything else for that matter). It makes no sense how someone could go from so good to so bad. It's mind-boggling.\n\nI don't know how I feel about it. As a fan of the original, I'm glad they're going in another direction, because if they'd sampled aped the original film, they'd have lost right out of the gate. This has potential to be something interesting. I just hope it doesn't turn into pretentious bullshit. It definitely gives me an entirely different feeling of unease. I do like that. It seems more to be about the evil lurking in the mundane, everyday world which is a different kind of scary.\n\nI do feel for Dario. I think his last really great, stylish film was Opera in '87. After that, most of his films took on this cheesy, made for TV look. They became very bland. Maybe he didn't have the energy or the budgets to accomplish what he had in the 70's and 80's. I can say that I at least enjoy everything he made from Bird With the Crystal Plumage to Opera. Trauma, Stendhal, and Sleepless all have their moments, but everything else is pretty awful. Mother of Tears had so much potential, but it was shot like a bland American action movie with no color or style and it just didn't work. Plus, I remember Asia making for a rather unlikable heroine. I'm not sure why, but she seemed bitchy and like she didn't want to be there the entire time. Don't even get me started on Daria Nicolodi's pathetic cameo with that ridiculous CGI ghost shit. Yikes! Still, the film is bonkers enough that it's not a total waste of time.\n\n[quote] I hope they kept the over the top Art Nouveau style. I loved that. And the voice dubbing of the Germans made it seem surreal.\n\nThe actress who dubs Olga in the original version has a very distinctive, droll and melancholic voice. I think she also dubs several other characters in the movie. It only adds to the surrealness. I think it sounds a little like Daria Nicolodi without using her accent, or maybe even Jessica Harper. Nicolodi is almost certainly the voice of Helena Markos in the English version.\n\n[quote]Nicolodi got to use her real voice only in Opera and it's excellent. I love her deep, husky voice. I wish she'd been allowed to dub herself in Argento's other films.\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nThat's why I prefer the Italian language versions of Argento's 1970s movies because Nicolodi's own voice is so superior that that comparatively higher pitched, perky (I would even add grating) voice in the dubbed English language versions of Susperia and (especially) Deep Red.\n\nFor you Argento fans out there, do yourselves a favor and check out the Italian language versions of his '70s films if you haven't already done so.\n\nI'm excited, because I really have no idea where this is going to go. I can only assume they're going in a more Rosemary;'s Baby/Stepford Wives route where Suzy slowly uncovers the conspiracy at the school instead of loud, baroque horror coming left and right like the original. It should be interesting. Whoever cut that trailer deserves an award, because they enticed me without spoiling huge chunks of the movie. That's rare these days.\n\nHopefully, the Halloween trailer coming this Friday will be equally as good and I'd say we'll have a pretty good year for horror.\n\nI remember working with a group of Yugoslavian refugees in the late 90s who had fled from Milosevic's Serbia with no money, no property, no pensions, essentially just the clothes on their backs and livelihoods intact, sometimes not even that. Many had degrees that they could not secure work with so were grateful for whatever menial jobs they could get. The work ethics of these people was just astounding, some would work several jobs and run their own businesses at the same time (even ones in their 60s) and would NEVER complain no matter what. Virtually none went on benefits. And how quickly they got their lives together! Becoming pillars of the community, amassing new wealth and prosperity from nothing in just a couple of short years.\n\n[quote] had the biggest crush on Jessica Harper, a lot of it had to do with her singing voice in movies like Phantom of the Paradise and Shock Treatment. She seemed to disappear from movies in the 80s but became an author of children's books and composer of children's music.\n\nShe has an pretty cool resume, Phantom of the Paradise, Suspiria, Shock Treatment, two for Woody Allen, Love and Death and Stardust Memories, Pennies from Heaven, My Favorite Year, Inserts. In the 80's she married Tom Rothman, a movie executive who was the Chairman of 20th Century Fox who greenlit Titanic and Avatar and five Best Pictures. Now he is the head of Sony Pictures. She left to raise a family with guest star parts here and there. She is in the new Suspiria but it could be a cameo for anyone knows right now. Wish she would do some autograph shows but she hardly needs the money.\n\nI saw her a a few years ago on Valerie Bertnielli's cooking show when she entertained her book club.\n\nThey really need to remake Mother of Tears. I watched all 3 movies 2 nights ago and while Suspira and Inferno were amazing, Mother of Tears was a mess. For a theatrical film made in 2007 it looked more like a television film made in 1997. Poor CGI and special effects. Atrocious dubbing. It was a worse finale to an amazing film series than Phantasm: Ravager was.\n\nThe colors and visuals in the 4K restoration of Suspira look absolutely amazing. Now if only they could do a 4K restoration of Inferno.\n\nDargento is rather a mystery. The first 15 minutes of Suspiria are perfection, it is like a fairy tale on crack. He makes the automatic doors of the airport menacing and he manages too keep a crescendo of horror, without any pause whatsoever, for like an hour. The last 20 minutes or so are a bit disappointing but few movies can keep that sort of thing up. Together with Deep Red and Tenabrae, and his early ones, he had everything to be a cult movie untouchable. But in the last 10 to 15 years his movies are abominable to the point of making you wonder if he is the same person. But his legacy still stands.\n\nGood for you, R165! You may inspire me to do the same.\n\nThe Christmas-set opening sequence of PROFUNDO ROSSO aka DEEP REED with the quick pan through the hallway (and the SPOILER hidden surprise) is masterful filmmaking... I can't remember what it was, but this shot has been ripped off quite famously since then with the subtle hidden image in plain view. Plus, the whole trans subtext of it all (ditto TENEBRAE) are way ahead of their time... while SUSPIRIA and DEEP RED are my favorites, there's something about TENEBRAE that keeps me coming back. I think it may be the best story of the three, as well, and the single-take murder with the lesbians in that crazy modern apartment, plus that final shot and the endless screaming over the credits. Brilliant. They are definitely my top 3 Argento films, as much as I love INFERNO, BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET, OPERA and PHENOMENA.\n\nBTW it is interesting to note that TENEBRAE is inspired by Argento's own obsessive fan who used to call him constantly claiming the damaging effects that his films had had on him. Also intriguing is that the film was set in the near future (filmed in 1982) and it is intentionally ultra modern and post-apocalyptic. Subtle, but very evident if you know that going in. The trans whore on the beach is the most unsettling part of the film to me, nonetheless. Great casting (she actually still had a dick at that time, dunno if she ever got the surgery). I'd say TENEBRAE could be remade brilliantly if we're doing Argento reboots.\n\n[bold]Luca Guadagnino Shares Quentin Tarantino’s ‘Suspiria’ Rave Reaction: ‘He Was Crying and Hugged Me’[/bold]\n\n[quote]Luca Guadagnino’s “Suspiria” is still four months away from opening in theaters, but it now has the blessing of none other than Quentin Tarantino. Speaking to the Italian publication La Repubblica, Guadagnino revealed he showed his adaptation of Dario Argento’s horror classic to Tarantino last fall and the “Pulp Fiction” director had a strong emotional reaction.\n\n[quote]“I showed it to Quentin Tarantino. We’ve been friends since our jury duty at the Venice Film Festival,” Guadagnino said. “I was nervous but eager to hear his advice. We saw it at his place and his reaction warmed me. He was enthusiastic about it, in the end he was crying and hugged me. Because it’s a horror movie but also a melodrama, my goal was to make you look at the horror without being able to take [your eyes off the screen] because you’re captivated by the\n\nR154 The story ended up being re-written so many times over the decades, the original 3rd Mother filming screenplay was very beautiful and ambitious, and dealt with \"the fall of Rome\" as its theme. What they filmed was very rushed and cheap looking. The gore was over the top, but not beautiful like in Suspiria. Especially the death of the two lesbians.\n\nThere had been another version of \"The Third Mother\" in the planning stages since at least 1984. Daria Nicolodi was involved in the story early on and some of her ideas were recycled into the film \"Profundis\" or \"The Black Cat\" in 1989, which is a semi-legit follow up to Suspiria. That full version of that film is linked. TBC has some of the radical color scheme and a pretty soundtrack, I only wish Dario could have directed it. It's low budget but actually has some interesting ideas. (Also \"Olga dubber\" is the voice of the lead actress).\n\nI don't really think the script for Mother of Tears was the issue. I think it was a budget thing. It's a far more coherent script than Suspiria or Inferno if we're being honest. I remember hearing about several major set pieces being changed or cut completely due to budget issues. Even someone like Dario Argento has a hard time getting a film funded these days. I still don't understand the bland color scheme, though. Are light gels THAT expensive, Dario? C'mon! I also remember Asia being a sorta unlikable heroine. There was something about her that turned me off. I remember when they were in talks with Sienna Miller for the role. I'm trying to imagine if that would have been better or worse.\n\nMother of Tears was a disaster. Asia was at her worst, the scary parts were hilariously bad, and don't get me started on Daria Nicolodi playing the \"ghost mom\". I couldn't believe i was finally watching the final part of this amazing trilogy (i love Suspiria and Inferno) and the result was THAT. Also, the main witch in this was played by Moran Atias, who at the time was a hot tv soubrette here in Italy. So it was like watching Pamela Anderson playing the Babadook. A huge misfire.\n\nI wasn't upset at the casting of the Mother of Tears herself, but what they dressed her in (that fucking t-shirt with glitter pen artwork) was horrible. Give the bitch some class. She was always said to be the most beautiful and evil of the three mothers, so couldn't we class her up a bit.\n\nDaria's cameo was hysterically funny and I don't think that's what they were going for. I got confused, too, because it looked like she was wearing the same nightgown and hairstyle as her character in Inferno. Were they supposed to be the same person?\n\n+++++++++SUSPIRIA 2018 WITH SPOILERS++++++++\n\nSusie Bannion, an american dancer, arrives at a Berlin Dance Academy led by Madame Blanc. The school is in turmoil because the night before a girl, Patricia, ran away. Everybody thinks she joined a terrorist group: we are in the full 70s \"German Autumn\" crisis, and the country is in chaos. Patricia seems deranged, she talks to her psychiatrist about some shady shit happening at the Academy. Susie befriends Sara, another dancer, and becomes Blanc's pet, as she learns a new difficult choreography right away. Then the basic plot of old Suspiria ensues (with less gore and MUCH more talking about modern dance). Sara begins to suspect that the Academy might be a cover for a terrorist cell, but soon finds out it's much worse: they are witches (against the pathriarchy) and they need new blood to save their \"mother\" Helena Markos. Susie will be the victim of the sacrifice. The main difference with old Suspiria is that Susie apparently is very ok with this, she WANTS to be sacrificed to Helena. But when everything is ready for the rituals, the twist: Susie reveals herself as the REAL Mother of Tears. She kills all the witches who were on Helena Markos' side, and becomes the master of the dance Academy. There's a big subplot about the old psychiatrist (the one maybe also played by Tilda Swinton), but it's not that intriguing. Also, a lot of talking about history: the 70s turmoil, the Berlin Wall, the Communist regime. It has a couple of seemingly scary scenes, but reading the script i think this will be an arthouse movie about Germany's troubled past.\n\nSounds as shitty and overrated as the original. Never got the praise for the original SUSPIRIA. Am I missing something?\n\nI totally enjoy thrillers and old fashion horror films. I don't enjoy torture porn such as HOSTEL and film seeing people tortured, I enjoy old school horror films and current horror such as the films about the creepy doll (forgot the titles) and possession, the one about the kid possessed in England was really good. The Dubbuyk box film, The Possession, was also good.\n\nI like Japanese horror films too, but SUSPIRIA, IMHO, was total schlock. Why is this film always cited as the epitome of great horror? It even looked cheaply made.\n\nSuspiria played Fantastic Fest tonight and people are praising it. There's one tweet of someone who's not buying the effusive praise.\n\n@zigglesbarlow Your #Suspiria review makes you sound like a bad parent making excuses for your terrible child's terrible behavior.\n\nOh look, a picture of everyone tripping over their dicks to write a #Suspiria praise hot take. Blow my mind, you flowery worded shithead, prove to me how smart you are by liking a movie that obviously isn't any good. You rebel!\n\nI'm nervous about the run time and all the political bullshit I've heard is in there. Does anyone want to see a political remake of a Dario Argento movie? Argento's movies are the definition of style over substance. It sounds like this one might be filled with too much padding and fluff.\n\nHow about someone remake Deep Red and have it take place during Vietnam? Maybe Tenebrae during the fall of Berlin Wall will add juicy layers of subtext. Give me a fucking break.\n\nI saw it and I have some questions.\n\nWas any of this actually satanic? The coven or the dance company ... or whatever it is ... what is their religion? Who or what is their god?\n\nDid Dakota replace Tilda as the main witch at the end?\n\nAlso, was that old naked saggy woman at the end ceremony with the sunglasses Gwyneth Paltrow?\n\n[quote] Was it obvious that one of the leads was being played by a person of the opposite gender from the character? Did the audience realize it? I'm trying to avoid a spoiler for those who haven't heard about it.\n\nIt was obvious to me because of her features. She had no lines so it was not a plot point. Same with the John C. Reilly/ Joaquin Phoenix film \"The Sisters Brother\". One character is played by a trans woman but she is playing it as a biologically born woman. Her voice gives her away, though.\n\nUnfortunately the film not doing too well in its opening weekend, it barely made the top 20. I guess people would rather see Bohemian Rhapsody, kids--The Nutcracker, urban audiences--Nobody's Fool.\n\nEverybody else probably went to see Venom, A Star is Born, or Halloween.\n\nI really thought Suspiria would at least break the top 10.\n\nUnfortunately the film not doing too well in its opening weekend, it barely made the top 20.

It did remind me of Neon Demon, but at least that movie had stunning visuals and grabs you in the first 5 minutes. This one took forever to get going, and every scene felt meandering and pointless, the music didn't evoke nostalgia or horror, and most disappointingly the visuals fell flat. Even the effects looked cheap. The choreography was very good as were the locations but aside from a few callbacks to Argento's colorful style, the movie was not stylized at all. Nobody was frightened by the climax as much as they were trying to figure out what was going on. Not sure why they had Chloe for such a pointless role. The scenes with old man just dragged the film further down. An absolute mess of a movie. If the actresses started defecating on screen, it would have failed to get a reaction from the audience based on how bemused and disengaged they were.\n\nI don't think Amazon had any faith in this movie, especially when they knew it would be competing with Halloween during the holiday which, I think, did way better than anyone was expecting. It still hasn't played anywhere near me and probably won't.\n\nI think Amazon got scared after The Neon Demon which was similar in style and story to Suspiria. Very art house-y and no one went to see it (and a lot of the mainstream audiences that did hated it and told their friends not to see it). And that one DID play near me for about a week.\n\nI just don't understand why they'd drop 20 mil on a movie they knew would have a very limited audience. Dropping 1-5 mil is understandable, but c'mon. Maybe they hope it can snag some nominations for Best Makeup or Best Score or something.\n\nI assume this will hit Amazon Prime by January and be free for Prime subscribers just like all of Amazon's other movies. Certainly, they can't be making too much money off of that.\n\nAmazon has zero confidence in this, but I think they're right. They don't want a Mother! situation where they open this weird, goofy arthouse horror movie wide and audiences tear it apart, they lose tons of money, and the movie's pulled out of theaters in a week.\n\nI'm just curious as to why they financed this movie and for SO much money, too. 20 mil? That's a lot of money to spend on a movie you know will never play anywhere but arthouses. Seems like they'd know it'd be a losing situation. Or maybe they were hoping to cash in on the critical success of Call Me By Your Name.\n\nR312, I think Amazon is just like Netflix was a couple of years ago, in their eagerness to be associated with major cinematic talent. And one of the ways to attract that talent is to throw a ton of money at them to do whatever they want. Netflix has backed off of that a bit, and HBO backed off from it years ago, but Amazon is playing catch-up, and they're probably viewing it as an investment in their brand that will pay off in prestige/future possibilities, even if it doesn't at the box office. So yeah, I think they had people keeping an eye out, took note of Call Me By Your Name's critical success and got involved. Of course, Netflix has lost a TON of money this way, so I don't know how great of an idea it actually is.\n\nWatched it last week on DVD from Netflix. What a piece of pretentious, tedious crap. Not scary for one moment. It's one of those films that tries to be about a lot of different things, but fails to be engaging or convincing at any of them.\n\nAt least Argento had one basic thing in mind - the scare the crap out of you.\n\nGreat review, r291, agree completely. I so wanted to like this. I love the first half of the original, which is a truly original movie, though the ending is bad. This, however, was terrible. It had so much talent and some good ideas but pretensiouness won. It is boring and the only scene remotely scary/upsetting is the bones breaking dance, which is actually the first horror scene in the movie. Stangely, I think Dakota was quite good for the role, she had an ambiguous quality that seemed to suggest dumbness which worked.\n\nI was surprised by how much I liked Dakota in this, too. She wasn't half bad. Chloe Moretz was fucking useless as always, though. Mia Goth was great, as was Tilda. It just needed to trim at least 30 minutes. The shrink stuff should be first on the chopping block. I get that he was the apparent emotional center of the film, but all his scenes felt like they were from a totally different movie. There really is a pretty good 100 minute movie in here waiting to get out. Someone should try doing one of those fan cut things and see if it would work.\n\nHoly Mary Mother of God this has to be the most boring movie ever made. Zero tension, even the bone breaking scene was boring. Watching on Amazon Prime who produced this mess and it looks terrible. All washed out in browns. I had heard the cinematography was gorgeous, well it ain't. Halfway thru....so Moretz was in it only for the first ten minutes? Still haven't seen Jessica Harper who I really like unless I actually went into an instantaneously temporary coma due to boredom.\n\nIt had its moments, but it needed an editor. So much potential and a great cast. Why did they decide to stick in that pretentious subplot about the psychiatrist? It was like something from one of those awful student films or shorts you see at a film festival that thinks it's super deep, but it's not. Cut that out and it would have been halfway decent.\n\nR120\n\nIT IS TILDA.\n\n\"In October 2018, Swinton told The New York Times that Dr. Klemperer was played by Lutz Ebersdorf and Ebersdorf was played by her.\n\nWhen asked why she played Ebersdorf, she said, \"for the sheer sake of fun above all... The intention was never to fool anybody. The genius of [makeup artist] Mark Coulier notwithstanding, it was always our design that there would be something unresolved about the identity of the performance of Klemperer.\"\n\nSwinton asked the makeup department to make a prosthetic penis, which she wore during filming.\n\nSwinton wrote Ebersdorf's IMDb biography herself.\n\nGuadagnino stated in a subsequent interview in Vulture that several of the actors in the film believed Ebersdorf to be a real person, specifically Ingrid Caven, who was unaware it was Swinton in disguise until after filming wrapped filming.\""
