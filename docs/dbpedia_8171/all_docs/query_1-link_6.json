        "text": "Look, I know how to write serious movie reviews. I know how to formulate a coherent synopsis, how to critique direction and performance an score. And I was completely set on writing a serious review for the new remake of Suspiria — mainly because I had a giallo phase in high school, and have seen Dario Argento’s original numerous times. But any and all of those intentions flew out the window when I found out which characters (emphasis on the plurality) Tilda Swinton played in the movie.\n\nFor those who never delved deep into Italy’s thriller genre, Suspiria — in most simplest of synopsise — is a movie about Susie Bannion, a young girl who moves to attend, and live in the dormitories of, a world-renowned dance company. Witches, nightmares, dance, women. This movie has it all. The original Suspiria was never a favourite of mine, but it is crucial to acknowledge the important role it played — along with Deep Red and Mario Bava’s Blood and Black Lace — in maintaining the memory and essence of the giallo genre. But a thinkpiece regarding the genre, as well as a deep analysis of Suspiria’s psychoanalytic themes, is for a different time. I want to write now about Tilda Swinton because if anyone deserves my time and energy, it’s her.\n\nThe 2018 remake of Suspiria begins with a scene in a psychologist’s home office, as the old Dr. Klemperer, speaking mainly in German, listens to the paranoid ramblings of one of his patients. Dr. Klemperer is a key character for the remainder of the two and a half hour movie, and is credited as being played by “Lutz Ebersdorf”. The elusive Ebersdorf had only (what looked like) a stock picture to his name, and no film titles listed on IMDB, other than Guadagnino’s latest. This was very suspect. And for good reason, as now, it has been reported that Lutz Ebersdorf doesn’t exist and that the old man was actually played by — you guessed it — Tilda Swinton herself.\n\nTo say I was shocked would be an understatement: the longer the word, the more significant the surprise, so let’s just say I was incredibly flabbergasted. Astonished. Dumfounded. I’ve exhausted the thesaurus — if a longer word for stunned exists, please let me know.\n\nThanks to makeup, it’s easy to jump genders in cinema, nowadays. The makeup department did a stellar job in transforming Swinton into a man whose age seemed seeped into every last wrinkle. But Swinton’s transformation is startling not because of the appearance, but because of the performance. Not only is her German incredible, but when she speaks English, she maintains a consistent German accent. Her enunciation and pronunciation are impeccable — take this from a linguistics student.\n\nSwinton’s desire, and subsequent success in execution, of metamorphosis — that is to say, the transformation of appearance, age, voice, and language — is keeping the spirit of performance alive. Her willingness to delve so deep into pageantry, embodies the very heart of cinema. A good story is told through good performance which is derived from a good transformation from a good actor.\n\nWith the advancement of cinematic technologies, it is easy to compartmentalize film into different subjective categories. Some are concerned with literary elements — story development, plot — others with more technical aspects — cinematography, special effects. Performance has been derived into a category of its own: take most of Meryl Streep films, particularly the Iron Lady, and see whether the story is as riveting as the main star. These movies are mainly Oscar vehicles — incepted with the intention of getting its leading roles Academy Awards — and are content with being remembered as “blank’s most amazing performance” and as nothing more. This year’s A Star is Born is guilty of doing this very thing; it’s almost obnoxious how obvious the film’s intentions of getting Lady Gaga an Oscar are (and I’m a fan of her! I spent two hundred dollars on concert tickets for god’s sake).\n\nBut when we separate performance from story, and story from technology, we inhibit cinema from being as exciting as it could be; as exciting as it should be. The best films — and our own, personal favourites — usually are successful melanges of the three. Think of how much more impactful James Cameron’s Avatar would be if its special effects were used in support of a more original story.\n\nAnd this is not to say that a successful performance comes from a stark physical transformation. Swinton was captivating in her role as the German doctor because of the way she spoke, walked, and even breathed. Her commitment to character transformation is just as evident in Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin, where she forgoes a gender and a language switch, but retains the metamorphosed character.\n\nTilda Swinton deserves an Oscar for her performance in Suspiria, but I’ve come to the conclusion that she deserves an Oscar following every movie I’ve seen of hers, so this is not a new nor a profound sentiment. Tilda Swinton deserves an Oscar, but she doesn’t need it. She doesn’t really need anything (as a side note: she already has an Oscar for her performance in Michael Clayton). She does however deserve our respect, reverence, and gratitude. Tilda Swinton is the greatest actress of this generation, and hopefully she inspires current and future directors, actors, and filmmakers, to commit to the reconciliation of story and performance."
