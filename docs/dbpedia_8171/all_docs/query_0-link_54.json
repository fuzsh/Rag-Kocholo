        "text": "Synapse has gone back to the 4K scans that served as the source for their widely acclaimed Blu-ray presentation of the film and started from scratch in order to fully take advantage of the opportunities created by UHD. Synapse President Don May, Jr. says, “We went back to the original 4K files and did a new color correction that took full advantage of the UHD format’s expanded color and high dynamic range capabilities.” You might have seen SUSPIRIA in the past, but now you can experience it in a whole new way!\n\nJessica Harper (PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE, PENNIES FROM HEAVEN) stars in this frightening tale of a young student who uncovers dark and horrific secrets within the walls of a famous German dance academy. What spirals out from that simple premise is one of the most powerful and hallucinatory nightmares ever captured on celluloid! Dario\n\nArgento’s SUSPIRIA comes to home video from Synapse Films in an exclusive new 4K restoration from the original uncut, uncensored 35mm Italian camera negative with the original theatrical 4.0 English surround sound mix. Synapse Films’ beautifully restored version of Dario Argento’s SUSPIRIA was completed with the supervision and approval of the film’s Director of Photography, Luciano Tovoli. Now available for the FIRST TIME EVER on home video in a true 2160p 4K presentation with High Dynamic Range and a new Dolby Atmos remix!”\n\nDario Argento, Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Barbara Magnolfi, Alida Valli, Joan Bennett, Udo Kier ”\n\nThe Blu-ray edition courtesy of Synapse Films arrives with a phenomenally gorgeous high-def presentation that will simply astound and amaze the most loyal fans, and the brand-new lossless mix is also the best one could possibly imagine or have hoped for… the definitive version of the cult giallo classic and highly-recommended for devoted followers.” – HighDefDigest.com\n\n“It looks… well, perfect. The colors finally look dead on, detail is immaculate, and the whole film has an intensity you’re unlike to experience anywhere outside of a freshly struck 35mm print.” – Mondo Digital\n\n“To say that the wait for Synapse Films’ U.S. Blu-ray debut of Suspiria was well worth it would be a gross understatement. This is one of the most beautiful horror films ever made and this release is one of the most beautiful Blu-ray releases ever mounted by any distribution company, big or small… this is the definitive release of the film to own, bar none.” – The Digital Bits”\n\nWidescreen Anamorphic 2.39:1\n\nUHD 4K BLU-RAY SPECIFICATIONS:\n\nVIDEO: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.39:1\n\nAUDIO: English Dolby Atmos and DTS-HD MA 4.0, Italian DTS-HD MA 5.1\n\nSUBTITLES: English\n\nNOT RATED – COLOR – 98 MINS.\n\nUHD All Region\n\nBlu-Ray of Extras – All Region\n\nA new 4K restoration of the original uncut, uncensored Italian 35mm camera negative exclusively done by Synapse Films, with color correction supervised and approved by SUSPIRIA Director of Photography, Luciano Tovoli\n\n• Original 4.0 1977 English language LCRS sound mix not heard since the theatrical release in 1977, presented in high-resolution DTS-HD MA 96kHz/24-bit audio, with newly translated removable English SDH subtitles\n\n• All-new Dolby Atmos Remix and High Dynamic Range Presentation\n\n• Italian 5.1 surround mix, with removable English subtitle translation\n\n• Two audio commentaries by authors and Argento scholars, Derek Botelho, David Del Valle and Troy Howarth\n\n• Do You Know Anything About Witches? – 30 minute SUSPIRIA visual essay written,edited and narrated by Michael Mackenzie\n\n• Suzy in Nazi Germany – Featurette on the German locations from SUSPIRIA\n\n• A Sigh from the Depths: 40 Years of SUSPIRIA – All-new anniversary retrospective on the making of the film and its influence on cinema\n\n• Olga’s Story – Interview with star Barbara Magnolfi\n\n• Original theatrical trailers, TV spots and radio spots\n\n• “International Classics” English “Breathing Letters” opening credit sequence from the U.S. release\n\n• Alternate All-English opening and closing credits sequences, playable via seamless branching\n\n• Reversible cover art by Wes Benscoter"
