        "text": "A white, female, barefoot dancer with long auburn hair in a messy bun stands in gray sweatpants and a crimson leotard in front of three dance teachers in a paneled, mirrored studio. Initiating with her right arm and flattened hand, she slices the empty space to her left with a direct, sharp motion, curving her back and emptying out her lungs with a resounding exhalation (Photo 1). Throughout her dance, the breathing accompanies nearly every movement, not only assisting with her technique but also becoming the audible soundtrack—exuding both confidence and exasperation. Intermittent and slow zoom reaction shots of the teachers intensify the atmosphere and their empathy. As the dancer performs numerous turns, the camera takes on this disorienting and dizzying perspective. Upon finishing this move, the dancer suddenly sees the reflection of a fourth teacher, the leader of the dance company, suddenly appear in the left corner of the studio.\n\nThis scene features the dance audition of the character Susie Bannion for the Markos Dance Company in West Berlin in the Italian director Luca Guadagnino's horror film Suspiria (Guadagnino Reference Guadagnino2019), inspired by the 1977 version by Dario Argento. Guadagnino's remake is set during the German Autumn in 1977, which was characterized by terrorist attacks and kidnappings by the Red Army Faction in West Germany. The motive for shooting this film derived from the director's viewing of an all-female trio dance called Les Médusés (2013) by the Belgian choreographer Damien Jalet, which had incidentally also been inspired by Argento's cult film. Meanwhile, after having watched a video of German Expressionist dancer Mary Wigman's Hexentanz II, Suspiria's American screenwriter, David Kajganich, began researching her, tracing her lineage of other dancers and choreographers—Martha Graham, Pina Bausch, and Sasha Waltz (Guiducci Reference Guiducci2018).\n\nWith their similar artistic interests in ambiguity and ambivalence, Guadagnino, Jalet, and Kajganich collaborated to create a feature film that highlights and experiments with dance not as a complimentary dimension but as a powerful and transformative medium thoroughly interwoven with the narrative. While most literature on Suspiria—predominantly online magazine outlets (Crimmins Reference Crimmins2019; Crucchiola Reference Crucchiola2018; Guiducci Reference Guiducci2018; Kourlas Reference Kourlas2018)—merely points to aesthetic similarities with the dance styles of the aforementioned choreographers, none closely analyzes the choreography and filming from a dance studies, film studies, and German studies perspective. This article examines the filmic representation of dance as an aesthetic and political performance steeped in the discourse surrounding the RAF (Red Army Faction), the West German far-left militant organization, and fascism. Led by Ulrike Meinhof, Gudrun Ensslin, and Andreas Baader, this group upheld Marxist ideology and heavily critiqued the futile attempts of denazification of West German officials. Their early protests later developed into terrorist acts and kidnappings.\n\nWhile the leader of the Markos Dance Company, Madame Blanc, presents an intellectualism associated with her Expressionist choreography during and after the war, her ideals, like the RAF, turn radical by resorting to Nazi-like terrorism—through constant surveillance, behavioral control through torture, and elimination of disobedient dancers—in order to sustain matriarchal control of her coven. Visually inhabiting the body of a young, strong-willed dancer, Susie embodies the complex and conflicted nature of Blanc's choreography in the dance piece Volk (1948). She dismantles the matriarchy by integrating her own ideas upon revealing that she is Mater Suspiriorum, one of the three witch mothers. Even while Susie falls into the same trap as Blanc by destroying half the coven at the end of the film, she represents a younger generation who maintains occult ideologies of an elemental Mater Suspiriorum in a new kind of Expressionist dance.\n\nBesides visually, aurally, and tactilely absorbing information in her new environment, the most prominent feature of the film is Susie's use of breath as a primary sensorial mode to facilitate her elemental return. I argue that the new dance utilizes breaths and sighs not only to engage the torso by inhaling and exhaling, but also, introspectively, to take in and critically survey the past and current situation as a form of Vergangenheitsbewältigung (in this form, coming to terms with the past during the post-1945 period in West Germany, particularly the Holocaust). By inhaling, Susie embodies Blanc's dance, Volk, and can literally feel the movement and the vexed choreographic history behind not only the dance but also the ambivalent legacy of German modern dance. I would like to call this practice “historical breathing.” While contemporary dance frequently engages with breath for choreographic and sonic purposes, Guadagnino furthers its dimension by highlighting its historical surveying power. The film suggests that this superhuman mode is made possible through the combination of dance and breath. As a result, I trace how influences of the occult, the nineteenth-century practice of Turnen (gymnastics), Ausdruckstanz, and Nazism created a path to a new dance practice seen in Volk. Despite having the superpower of historical breathing, Susie's actions overwhelmingly perpetuate the cycle of violence. Thus, she ultimately chooses destruction over deep critical engagement and peaceful reform. While there are several dance scenes in the film, I will focus on two—Susie's audition and her destructive dance with Olga.\n\nDavina Quinlivan's The Place of Breath in Cinema (Reference Quinlivan2012) highlights the audiovisual elements related to breath by complicating the porous border between the visible and the invisible, using the term “(in)visible” (3). She argues that breathing functions as a mode of embodiment and therefore empathy for the viewer (5) as well as a narrative device and aural signifier (6). One reason for foregrounding the breath in film is to awaken “a contemplation or thoughtfulness towards the film that may preserve our subjectivity as viewers, rather than inviting us to lose ourselves entirely to it” (33). Also, in the horror film genre, she argues that the focus on breath conveys more emotional expression and affect: “The horror genre's exploitation of heavy breathing, silence and the repression and final release of the scream” (24). Guadagnino's Suspiria, however, does not explicitly subscribe to this practice, but rather subverts this convention of apprehension by using historical breath to continually convey the energetic presence of Mater Suspiriorum as an intellectual power surveying the academy space. This reading suggests that the viewer also embodies Susie through her haunting breath and embrace of a new Expressionist dance through the medium of screendance, yet we can remain critical of her actions. While positioning her as a sympathetic character to identify with, we must also ultimately grapple with her violent decisions. Film scholars Alexander Howard and Julian Murphet argue that Guadagnino aggressively highlights the concept of “transference” from other sources like Argento's Reference Argento and Spettacoli1977 version and Wigman dance practices, which permeates the entire structure of the film (Reference Howard and Murphet2022, 64). By drawing from Argento's Suspiria and then going astray artistically, this transference also “stages the present, ambivalently, as a compulsive repetition of the past it has forgotten” (65). As a result, even Susie's ultimate attempt to overthrow this matriarchy with her own still perpetuates violence."
