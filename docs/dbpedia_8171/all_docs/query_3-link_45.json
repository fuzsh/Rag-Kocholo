        "text": "Italian filmmaker (born 1971)\n\nLuca Guadagnino (Italian: [ˈluːka ɡwadaɲˈɲiːno]; born 10 August 1971) is an Italian film director and producer.[1] His films are characterized by their emotional complexity, eroticism, and sumptuous visuals. Guadagnino has received numerous accolades, including a Silver Lion, alongside nominations for an Academy Award and three BAFTA Awards.\n\nBorn in Palermo, Guadagnino spent part of his childhood in Ethiopia, but the family moved back to Italy to escape the Ethiopian Civil War. Guadagnino began his career directing short films and documentaries. He made his feature-film debut with The Protagonists (1999), the first of his many collaborations with actress Tilda Swinton. His follow-up Melissa P. (2005) was a commercial success in Italy but was met with mixed critical reception.\n\nGuadagnino gained further acclaim with his Desire trilogy, which consists of the films I Am Love (2009), A Bigger Splash (2015), and Call Me by Your Name (2017). The latter brought him international recognition. Suspiria (2018), a remake of the 1977 film, was Guadagnino's first foray into the horror genre. It was a box office failure and polarized critics. Guadagnino's next projects were We Are Who We Are (2020), a coming-of-age miniseries for HBO, the romantic horror film Bones and All (2022), and the romantic sports film Challengers (2024).\n\nGuadagnino directed several documentaries including Bertolucci on Bertolucci (2013) and Salvatore: The Shoemaker of Dreams (2020). Aside from filmmaking, he has been involved in the world of fashion, directing advertisements for brands like Fendi and Salvatore Ferragamo. In 2012, Guadagnino founded the production company Frenesy Film Company. He also produced Belluscone: A Sicilian Story (2014), The Truffle Hunters (2020), Salvatore: The Shoemaker of Dreams (2020), Holiday, and Enea (2023).\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nGuadagnino was born on 10 August 1971 in Palermo.[2] His Algerian mother grew up in Casablanca, Morocco, and his Italian father was from Canicattì, Sicily.[3][4][5][6] Guadagnino spent his early childhood in Ethiopia, where his father taught history and Italian literature at a technical school in Addis Ababa.[4][7] The family left Ethiopia for Italy in 1977 to escape the Ethiopian Civil War and settled in Palermo.[6]\n\nGuadagnino became interested in film making from around the age of nine, and started making amateur films after receiving a Super 8 camera from his mother.[6] He developed a passion for cinema in earnest during adolescence and programmed VHS recordings of films shown on television.[6] Some of the films cited as his early influences include Psycho (1960), Suspiria (1977) and Starman (1984).[6] He also developed a particular fondness for the films of Ingmar Bergman.[7] As a teenager, Guadagnino was a registered member of the Italian Communist Party, and wrote for the Palermo youth wing newspaper. He resigned his membership after a dispute with the newspaper editor, over the content of one of his interviews.[6]\n\nGuadagnino studied literature at the University of Palermo.[7] He then transferred to the Sapienza University of Rome and completed his degree in literature and cinema history,[7] with a thesis on the American filmmaker Jonathan Demme.[8] At Sapienza he met actress Laura Betti and would often attend her parties and cook for guests, such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Valerio Adami. Guadagnino would later describe that experience as his \"film school\".[7][6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly work (1999–2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nGuadagnino made his directorial debut with the feature film The Protagonists (1999), which was presented at the Venice Film Festival. The film also marks his first collaboration with actresses Tilda Swinton, Fabrizia Sacchi, and editor Walter Fasano.[9][10] In 2002, he directed Mundo Civilizado, a musical documentary, presented at the Locarno Film Festival in 2003.[11] His 2004 documentary film Cuoco Contadino, which follows Italian chef Paolo Masieri, was presented at the Venice Film Festival.[12] His second feature film, erotic drama Melissa P. starring Spanish actress María Valverde, made a successful debut the following year.[13]\n\nDesire trilogy and other work (2009–2017)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2009, he directed, wrote, and produced the cult hit I Am Love. The first installment in Guadagnino's self-described Desire trilogy,[14] was co-produced, and developed by Tilda Swinton—who also stars in the film—over a 7-year period.[15] Presented at a number of international festivals, the film was an immediate success with critics and audiences alike. In 2010, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film, and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[16][17][18]\n\nIn 2011, Guadagnino directed Inconscio Italiano, a feature-length documentary film presented at the Locarno Film Festival.[19] He also worked on the documentary Bertolucci on Bertolucci (2013), which was shown at the Venice Film Festival, the London Film Festival and Paris Cinemathèque, and 50 other festivals in 2013 and 2014. Co-directed with Walter Fasano, the documentary was made from archival material and received top international accolades.[20][21]\n\nGuadagnino was a producer on the well-received short film Diarchia (2010), directed by Ferdinando Cito Filomarino and starring Guadagnino collaborator Alba Rohrwacher, the short won the Pianifica prize at the Locarno Film Festival, received a special mention at the Sundance Film Festival in 2011, was nominated for Best Short Film at the European Film Awards, and won the prize for Best Director of a Short Film at the Nastri d'Argento.[22][23] Two years later he produced Edoardo Gabbriellini's feature film The Landlords, presented at the Locarno Film Festival. In 2015, Guadagnino produced Filomarino's debut feature film Antonia, a biopic about Italian poet Antonia Pozzi. Filomarino was inspired by Guadagnino's love of Pozzi's poetry to make the film.[24]\n\nIn 2015, Guadagnino directed the second installment of the Desire Trilogy, erotic thriller A Bigger Splash, with Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Ralph Fiennes and Dakota Johnson. The film is loosely based on the 1969 Jacques Deray film La Piscine.[25] It had its premiere at the 72nd Venice Film Festival where it competed for the Golden Lion.[26][27]\n\nGuadagnino's next film was Call Me by Your Name, an adaptation of André Aciman's novel of the same name, starring Timothée Chalamet, Armie Hammer, and Michael Stuhlbarg.

Because I truly love the actors I work with, so I want to repeat the joy of doing what we did together.\" Adding, \"there is no hypothesis, so there is no movie. It’s a wish and a desire, and I have not made up my mind about what would be the story.”[77]\n\nOther activities\n\n[edit]\n\nGuadagnino has served twice on the jury of the Torino Film Festival: in 2003 for the short flm section and in 2006 for the official jury. In 2010, he was a member of the Venice Film Festival.[78] In 2011, he served as president of the Beirut Film Festival,[79] and on the jury of the Locarno Film Festival.[80]\n\nOutside of film, he began working with the Italian fashion house Fendi in 2005.[81] In 2012, he created Frenesy, a creative agency and production company that conceives and implements communications for luxury brands and produces fashion films, video and print advertising, and high-profile creative events.[82]\n\nGuadagnino headed the jury for Louis Vuitton's Journey Awards in 2012, an international competition dedicated to young filmmakers.[83] He also participated as a jury member in the first edition of Fashion Film Festival Milano in 2014, chaired by Franca Sozzani, chief editor of Vogue Italia.[84] In December 2011, he made his debut as an opera director with Falstaff by Giuseppe Verdi at the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona, Italy.[85]\n\nInfluences and style\n\n[edit]\n\nGuadagnino cited seeing the desert in the film Lawrence of Arabia at age five, as his \"first impression of a screen, which had nothing to do with the actual film.\" Despite being influenced by Italian filmmakers such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, Dario Argento, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Federico Fellini, Guadagnino does not consider himself an Italian filmmaker, and would rather be seen as an Algerian one, saying: \"[...] I grew up in Ethiopia. I came to Italy when I was seven. In my mind, deep emotions and visual landscapes are from Ethiopia and not Palermo or any place in Italy. I arrived in Italy as an outsider.\"[86][87] He has also said during his youth he was an “isolated” person who was “healing” himself with cinema and “finding a lot of solace” in horror movies.[88] Other directors Guadagnino cites as influences include Alfred Hitchcock, Jean-Luc Godard, Nagisa Oshima, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Douglas Sirk.[5][89][90] For the 2012 Sight & Sound directors' poll, Guadagnino listed, The Blue Gardenia, Come and Go, Fanny and Alexander, The Fury, Goodbye South, Goodbye, Histoire(s) du cinéma, In the Realm of the Senses, Journey to Italy, Psycho and Veronika Voss as his favourite films.[91]\n\nFrequent collaborators\n\n[edit]\n\nGuadagnino usually has a long-standing group of actors and crew who participate on most of his work.

Rohrwacher has also appeared in The Staggering Girl as well as in the Guadagnino produced short Diarchia.
