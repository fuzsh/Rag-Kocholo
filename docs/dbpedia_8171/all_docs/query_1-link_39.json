But when a series of murders and a variety of other inexplicable events begin to pile up, Suzy realises her new school houses a terrifying secret.\n\nA psychedelic Technicolor nightmare, Suspiria’s garish colour palette and bravura set pieces remain extraordinary, but it’s the frenzied sense of dread added by Goblin’s iconic score that arguably made the film the horror powerhouse that it is. An unrelenting cacophony of experimentation and crescendo, it simply never lets you relax. Prepare to be terrified, perplexed and astounded all over again."
