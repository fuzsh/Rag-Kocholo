        "text": "The language in Luca Guadagnino’s remake of the horror film “Suspiria” goes beyond words. His witches speak in movement.\n\nIn one scene, a dancer — Susie (Dakota Johnson) — performs in a studio, expelling sharp, sudden breaths as she rises and falls, her arms shooting out like daggers. Another dancer, older and worn down, finds herself locked in a mirrored room; she twitches and contorts as she slams into walls and onto the floor to the sound of her own snapping bones. They protrude through her flesh like splitting seams.\n\nWhat’s stunning about the scene isn’t just the violence (though that is shocking), but how Susie’s movements control the other dancer, and how the energy sweeping through Susie’s body is palpably wild and free.\n\nThe scene also serves as a sly metaphor for what happens when an aging dancer is confronted with a younger, fresher version of herself. There may not be broken bones, but the result can feel just as violent. “In one room, you see the force of life,” the film’s choreographer, Damien Jalet, said in an interview. “And in the other it is the force of destruction.”\n\n“Suspiria” — as over-the-top as it is — is different. Most dance films, like “Center Stage” and “Black Swan,” are riddled with stereotypes. Finally, here is a film that gets dance right.\n\nIn the original “Suspiria,” Dario Argento’s 1977 cult classic, a ballet academy is home to a coven of witches. But in Mr. Guadagnino’s version, set that same year in divided Cold War Berlin, the dancers gracing the screen aren’t ballerinas; they’re neither wispy nor ethereal. In Mr. Guadagnino’s view, that witchy power is better unleashed through modern dance.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
