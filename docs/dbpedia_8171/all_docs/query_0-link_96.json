        "text": "Luca Guadagnino updates the 1977 shocker about witches at a dance academy into a spellbinding tale with a stronger, more potent storyline.\n\nCritic's rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\"We must break the nose of every beautiful thing,\" Tilda Swinton's Madame Blanc instructs Dakota Johnson's protagonist ahead of a dance rehearsal. Luca Guadagnino's retelling of 1977's technicolor terror \"Suspiria\" does just that – every moment of comfort, ecstasy and exaltation is smashed like the bones of a bewitched dancer who crossed the wrong sorceress.\n\nJust as in giallo master Dario Argento's seminal work, this \"Suspiria\" is set in 1977 and follows Susie Bannion (Johnson), a young American dancer who is accepted at a shadowy German dance company. In reality, it serves as a front for a coven of witches in divided, terrorist attack-laden Berlin. The increasing tensions around the downtrodden, drowned city make the Markos Dance Academy, helmed by Blanc and the specter-like headmistress Helena Markos (also played by Swinton), feel like a welcome but well-worn home adjacent to the Wall.\n\nThe ethereal new American student becomes a vessel enchanted by the ferocity and grace of Blanc's art while unknowingly executing a fellow student with each movement and contortion during a dance rehearsal. This agonizing, prolonged sequence within the second act obliterates one woman's body into a contorted, bloody husk as another finds its power. And it's impossible to look away, even while holding in a horrified scream or a lurch.\n\nMeanwhile, dejected principal dancer Patricia (a disheveled Chloë Grace Moretz), spouts strange claims of witchcraft to her analyst, Dr. Josef Klemperer – again played by a prosthetic-covered Swinton as a German septuagenarian. He dismisses her seemingly out-there assertions about magic but investigates them once the girl goes missing.\n\nStudents like the disengaged and quickly discarded Olga and bubbly Brit Sara (Mia Goth) begin to question Patricia's disappearance and suspect academy leadership may be behind it. As Sara mines for clues with the doctor, Susie is anointed by the coven as a sacrifice to the ailing Markos, who is alleged to be the grand witch known as Mother Suspiriorum – the so-called \"mother of sighs.\"\n\nMORE: See the original 'Suspiria' at Alamo Drafthouse, then check out these horror classics\n\nEvery sigh, whimper, wheeze and scream echoing through the pained streets of Berlin culminate inside the bloodstained catacombs hidden within the school. The grizzly final act is an onslaught of abject horror. Maimed corpses litter the crimson-drenched screen as Thom Yorke's airy score lifts us out of the depraved depths.\n\nSave for this scarlet slaughtering giving a glimpse of Argento's saturated fairy tale, Guadagnino keeps the palette muted in somber earth tones that tie us to the ground, like Susie's movements. \"Are you so happy to be stuck to the earth?\" Blanc asks a height-averse Susie. So much of Guadagnino's direction brings us back to earth and the fraught malaise of its mundaneness masking guilt and shame.\n\nThat's what makes Guadagnino's somber reimagining so mesmerizing: It takes the charred bones and ash of Argento's witches and roots them in a reality entirely familiar to our own. Detractors would say the \"Call Me By Your Name\" auteur overstuffed the lithe 98-minute original with needless backstory, but the original, while beautiful, is known more for its aesthetics than the strength of its story.\n\nSwinton, who worked with Guadagnino in \"I Am Love\" and \"A Bigger Splash\" – also co-starring Johnson – is a marvel of malevolent motherhood. The elegant matron swans around the mirror-coated, dark, sigh-filled halls in billowing mauve robes eating chicken wings, listlessly smoking, dismissing mouthy dancers and haunting Susie's dreams with visions of hairballs.\n\nAnd while the wide-eyed, soft spoken Jessica Harper made a lasting impression as the original Susie (and memorably pops in Guadagnino's version), Johnson is teeming with charisma as this take's ingenue. Susie's now a Mennonite from Ohio described as her mother's sin that's been \"smeared onto the world.\" She asks mysteriously menacing questions like, \"Why is everyone so ready to think the worst is over?\" with a mix of weariness and innocence.\n\nThat foreboding question is one that hauntingly resonates today, adding to a collective feeling of dread for a darkness we thought we'd buried ages ago.\n\nMORE MOVIES:\n\nYou'll have a bloody good time at 'Monster Party'\n\n'Bohemian Rhapsody' safe, authorized biopic\n\nMelissa McCarthy should stick to dramas like 'Forgive'\n\n'Suspiria,' 4.5 stars\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino.\n\nCast: Dakota Johnson, Tilda Swinton, Mia Goth and Chloë Grace Moretz.\n\nRating: R for disturbing content involving ritualistic violence, bloody images, graphic nudity and some language including sexual references.\n\nGreat ★★★★★ Good ★★★★\n\nFair ★★★ Bad ★★ Bomb ★"
