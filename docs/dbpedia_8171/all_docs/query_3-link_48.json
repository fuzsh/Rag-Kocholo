        "text": "Thom Yorke is in attendance at this year’s Venice Film Festival, where he participated in a panel for his work composing the soundtrack for the upcoming Luca Guadagnino-directed horror remake Suspiria. In an Instagram clip from the panel, Yorke compared his process of writing the score to “making spells.”\n\n“There’s a way of repeating in music which can hypnotize, and I kept thinking to myself it was a form of making spells. So when I was working in my studio, I was making spells—and that sounds really stupid but that’s how I was thinking about it,” he said. “It was a sort of freedom I’d not had before: I’m not working in the format of a song or arrangement, I’m just exploring. I’m putting things out into my studio and seeing what my studio is bringing back.”"
