Northumbria University is one of the largest universities in the UK. It is based in the centre of Newcastle and has a global reputation for academic excellence and world leading research as well as regularly being voted highly by students. The university also works with major employers, including Nike, IBM, Nissan, Proctor & Gamble, the BBC, and the NHS.

Working in partnership with Northumbria and the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust we developed a website and digital patient information resource for the heart and lung transplant centre, the only transplant centre in the UK to offer heart transplants for adults with complex congenital heart disease.
