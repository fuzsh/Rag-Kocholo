        "text": "Originally known as Newcastle Polytechnic, the University was formed in 1969 from the amalgamation of three regional colleges: Rutherford College of Technology, the College of Art & Industrial Design, and the Municipal College of Commerce. These colleges themselves had origins which were deeply rooted in the region. The practical and vocational training needs of local industry had stimulated the development of relevant post-school education as far back as the nineteenth century.\n\nBuilding on these firm foundations, the Polytechnic became one of the leading institutions of its type in the UK. It became a major centre for the initial training of teachers with the incorporation of the City College of Education in 1974, and subsequently the Northern Counties College of Education in 1976.\n\nIn 1976 the Polytechnic, which already offered nurse training, began occupational therapy and physiotherapy training. September 1992 marked the inauguration of the University when the Polytechnic was awarded university status and became Northumbria University. In 1995 the incorporation of the Bede, Newcastle and Northumbria College of Health Studies was transferred into the University.\n\nA book providing a detailed account of the history of Northumbria University has been published by Northumbria University Press. Rutherford's Ladder: the Making of Northumbria University, 1871-1996 charts the early history of Northumbria University and the academic institutions from which it was created."
