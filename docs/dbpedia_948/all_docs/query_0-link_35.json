        "text": "A university has been fined after two students suffered \"life-threatening\" effects when they were given 100 times too much caffeine in an experiment.\n\nNorthumbria University told Newcastle Crown Court it was \"deeply, genuinely sorry\" as it was fined Â£400,000.\n\nSports science students Alex Rossetta and Luke Parkin were each given the equivalent of 300 cups of coffee.\n\nThey were admitted to intensive care for dialysis after the calculation error led to violent side-effects.\n\nProsecutor Adam Farrer told the court the overdose \"could easily have been fatal\".\n\nPeter Smith, defending, said the university wished to \"emphasise that they take the welfare of their students and staff seriously\"."
