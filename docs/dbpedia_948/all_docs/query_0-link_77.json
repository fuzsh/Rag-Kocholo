        "text": "External News\n\n17 September 2017\n\nNorthumbria University is a thriving research-engaged, business-focused institution with an ambitious vision for future growth and innovation. Art and design historians in the Department of Arts have a strong reputation in the delivery of high quality teaching and research. You will join a team of academics who work individually and collaboratively on research and outreach projects with colleagues at other universities and museums regionally, nationally and internationally.\n\nThe university currently delivers a range of modules on the Fine Art and Design programmes and contributes to several successful postgraduate taught programmes. The institution also has a strong track record of PhD supervisions, and has recently validated an Art and Design History undergraduate programme scheduled to begin in 2018/19. This will have three strands: the history of art and design in modern society, experiencing art and design, and professional and vocational practice in relation to art and design history. The post holder will be required to work in close collaboration with colleagues on this and in other programme areas, and will additionally take responsibility for relevant modules as module tutor.\n\nWith excellent interpersonal skills and teaching experience, the successful candidate will contribute to research-informed learning and teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. You will be able to demonstrate expertise in and knowledge of current issues in art and/or design history, theory, critical thinking and contemporary practice, and be able to teach flexibly and effectively, using an appropriate variety of approaches to maximise student learning.\n\nThe research interests of the art and design historians at Northumbria focus on art, culture, design and architecture from the mid-nineteenth-century to the present in Europe, Japan, Australia and North America. Key concerns include nationalisms and cultural identity, the art market and art criticism, cultural landscapes, and concepts of community and social change. Preference may be given to candidates whose research complements our existing profiles (either reinforcing areas of strength, or extending the coverage of our subject area into allied but new areas within this field).\n\nWe are also interested in applicants whose work explores new opportunities for research impact (with pathways for impact case studies) and/or subject areas that connect to wider departmental and faculty communities. You will possess or have been awarded your doctorate by the start of the post. You should have a track-record of publications appropriate to your experience and feasible plans for future high-quality research outputs for submission to REF2021. You will be willing and supported to undertake doctoral supervision and new research projects.\n\nFor an informal discussion about the post, please contact Dr Heather Robson, Head of Department, on 0191 227 4431 or by e-mail at h.robson@northumbria.ac.uk."
