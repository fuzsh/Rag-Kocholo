        "text": "Your browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nOverview\n\nA serious - and serial - disruptor in the hallowed halls of higher education, Northumbria is our Research University of the Year and Modern University of the Year after its triumph in the latest ratings of university research output published last year. For the first time, a modern university created in the past 30 years finished ahead of a long-established Russell Group university in measurements of research power following a concerted effort to focus on activities that address some of the key challenges facing the world. It was the second successive set of ratings in which Northumbria recorded the biggest rise in research power of any university. Why is this important to undergraduates? Because it means many of the staff teaching them are recognised as leaders in their fields. The university is largely based on a central campus that has benefited from heavy recent investment, with a second campus four miles away in North Tyneside, home to the faculty of health and life sciences and the university's high-performance sports centre. Northumbria is a big provider of degree apprenticeships; the 2,000 apprentices on campus reflect the university's focus on employability. While more than half the intake is still drawn from north-east England, there are significant cohorts from north-west England and Yorkshire now beating a path to the door. With the legendary party city of Newcastle as the students' playground and a university making attainable offers, Northumbria presents a strong case to applicants.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nPaying the bills\n\nFinancial support is concentrated on providing hardship funds to students in the most need, with just under 1,900 students getting help in 2021-22. The university has lowered the requirements to access the Hardship Fund to reflect the greater challenges students face from rising food, rent and utility bills. Scholarships are more limited. The most prominent among them is the Northumbria Undergraduate UK Scholarship worth £3,500 in the first year of study only and awarded to up to 40 students a year. To qualify, they must achieve at least AAA at A-level or DDD at BTec (or equivalent) and be studying architecture, business management, business and marketing, geography, history, interior architecture, law, psychology, psychology with criminology, or sport and exercise science. There are further philanthropic awards to support widening participation, and students are encouraged to stay on at the university to do a postgraduate course by getting a 20% discount on fees. Student residential accommodation is plentiful with 2,500 places to go round, beginning at £3,700 for a 43-week contract in a self-catered room, virtually identical to the prices at neighbouring Newcastle University. Rents in the private sector are among the cheapest in the country.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nWhat's new?\n\nNorthumbria was named University of the Year by Times Higher Education last November. 'The scale of Northumbria's ambition, the rigour and effectiveness with which it has been pursued, and its role in transforming lives and supporting its region all make it a deserving winner,' the judges said. Students are benefiting from this laser focus through the development of projects such as the Centre for Health and Social Equity (CHASE) which will provide world-class facilities for learning clinical skills, teaching and research in nursing, healthcare, education and social work when it opens fully in 2027. Northumbria has also become a global centre for the study of glaciology. Students interested in climate change and space stand to benefit from research developments in both areas at Northumbria. Researchers at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling recently moved to the university, studying the contracting masses of land and ice sheets via satellite observations and numerical models of the polar regions, work that underpins research into climate change. Meanwhile Northumbria's Space Technology Laboratory is leading the university's research into satellites, allowing academics and students to recreate the conditions satellites encounter in space, at launch and over several years spent in orbit.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nAdmissions, teaching and student support\n\nThe university has worked hard to bring about fairer admissions; over the past decade it has narrowed the percentage point gap between the proportion of students recruited from the quintiles with the lowest and highest levels of higher education participation from 19 to four. Today, 18.3% of enrolled students come from postcodes in the quintile with lowest progression to university compared to the 22.3% who come from postcodes in the quintile with the highest progression. The gap may narrow further following the introduction of contextual offers in the past year across all subjects. There is particular focus on contextual offers for students from ethnic minorities and care leavers, who qualify for an offer eight UCAS tariff points below the standard offer. Applicants can also earn NU points (with the same value as UCAS points) from mentoring, engagement and progression schemes to use in the event that their results fall short of course entry requirements. The university is committed to in-person delivery of courses, believing it to be the most effective way for students to learn. While lecture capture is used across the majority of courses, it is not seen as a replacement for attendance in person. Mental health and welfare support services are well used at Northumbria with just under 4,500 students accessing them in 2021-22. In addition to offering counselling, advice and one-to-one support, the university lays on psychoeducational workshops covering stress and anxiety, low mood, procrastination, sleep and avoiding burnout."
