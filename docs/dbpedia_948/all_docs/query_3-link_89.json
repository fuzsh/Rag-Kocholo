        "text": "Qatar Finance and Business Academy (QFBA) has announced the launch of Northumbria University, UK in Qatar to offer degrees in Accounting, Finance & Investments, and International Banking that have been approved by Qatar’s Ministry of Education and Higher Education.\n\nThe announcement was made during a press conference at QFBA yesterday in the presence of British ambassador Ajay Sharma and other VIP guests. The university is located at the QFBA headquarters in West Bay.\n\nThis is an important opportunity for high school graduates who are looking for a university degree from a UK-based university located in Qatar, QFBA has said in a statement.\n\nNorthumbria University is a public university from the UK with more than 35,000 students from 140 countries around the world.\n\nFounded in 1880, the university has a distinguished academic history for more than 135 years, and its programmes are accredited by leading professional institutions around the world.\n\nThe university has been recognised as one of the top universities in the UK for its successful job placement for graduates within six months of graduating.\n\nQFBA acting CEO Dr Mohamed Abdullah al-Emadi said, “We are proud to present to our community in Qatar one of the most renowned British universities that is regarded with providing high level academic education that encompasses a wide range of disciplines.\n\n“We’ve been driven to start a distinguished partnership with the university and establish a branch in Qatar after we obtained all official approvals from the authorities concerned, especially Qatar’s Ministry of Education and Higher Education. The university will provide a wide range of scientific and professional programmes that meet the needs of the labour market in Qatar.\n\n“With the launch of the partnership with Northumbria University, we are opening a world of unique educational opportunities for young generations of Qatar to boost their knowledge, potential and skills to the level of competition in the labour market not only in Qatar but anywhere in the world.”\n\nQFC Authority CEO Yousuf Mohamed al-Jaida said, “Today, I stand here with pride as we take this significant step towards providing the highest level of education and preparation for our new generation of leaders and shapers.\n\n“At the QFC, we put great importance in the youth and their role in transforming Qatar into a knowledge-based economy. Our diversification efforts will be fuelled by today’s students as they continue to innovate and find new ways for Qatar to shine.”\n\nProfessor John Wilson, pro vice-chancellor for the Faculty of Business and Law at Northumbria University, added: “We are pleased to launch this collaboration with QFBA to provide the Academy’s undergraduate students as well as graduates with excellent courses that will help them develop their knowledge and enable them to compete in the global labour market.”"
