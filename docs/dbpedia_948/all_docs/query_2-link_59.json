        "text": "LONDON / NORTHUMBRIA 24 July 2018: Pearson, the digital education company, today announces a long term strategic partnership with Northumbria University to enable the university to expand its existing portfolio of online degrees.\n\nNorthumbria University has offered a portfolio of flexible online distance learning to students since 2001, however as global demand for online distance learning has increased, the University identified a need to review, update and reposition its online offering. As a result, it is partnering with Pearson who will drive the marketing, recruitment, pedagogy development and support, whilst Northumbria will continue to deliver high quality learning, teaching and assessment.\n\nProfessor Peter Francis, Deputy Vice Chancellor at Northumbria University said: “Globally, online distance learning is growing rapidly. Pearson has a strong record of delivery and we are looking forward to working with them. Our strategy has identified a need and opportunity to extend our educational offer, to support academic position, brand, and diversify our income streams. Students globally actively seek to study with Northumbria, and a research rich, experientially focused Online Distance Learning portfolio will allow the University to embrace distance learning as a strategic opportunity.”\n\nRod Bristow, President UK and Core markets at Pearson said: “Online access to high quality, flexible, career-focused study is growing as it becomes a more attractive student experience. Northumbria has already got a great track record of online learning and a world class reputation for quality in career-focused disciplines. We are proud to partner with them to improve access to high quality career-focused education.”\n\nPearson is a market leader in Online Program Management - helping university and colleges scale online - and provides services to many high quality educational institutions across the globe. Pearson has over 40 global partners, runs over 300 programmes and has more than 300,000 course enrolments.\n\nFor Northumbria, developing its Online Distance Learning portfolio will help the University optimise the learning experience for students balancing academic and other commitments and studying at a distance, as well as contribute to the University’s strategic outcomes of diversifying income streams, raising brand awareness and extending its reach in overseas markets.\n\nThe shared ambition for the partnership is for a range of new programmes to launch over the course of the next five years, covering a range of subject areas in which the University is strong, and where there is high demand for flexible, career focussed education.\n\nInitial activity, commencing with immediate effect, will deliver a refresh and relaunch of the MSc Surveying for January 2019. The intention is to follow with a programme from the School of Design and an Integrated Masters in Business from Newcastle Business School. Early stage discussions have also been held in relation to programmes from Psychology and Computer Science.\n\nLearners will benefit from the same outstanding quality of education as on-campus students provided by Northumbria; with Pearson providing dedicated support to students at times convenient to them, fitting their work around a job or changing personal circumstances.\n\n---ENDS---\n\nAbout Pearson\n\nPearson is a global digital education company, with expertise in educational content and assessment, and a range of teaching and learning services powered by technology.
