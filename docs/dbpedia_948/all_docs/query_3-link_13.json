        "text": "Northumbria University (legally the University of Northumbria at Newcastle) is a UK public university located in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North East of England. It has been a university since 1992, but has its origins in the Rutherford College, founded in 1877. It holds the Silver Award in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).\n\nNorthumbria University is primarily based within City Campus located in Newcastle upon Tyne city centre with other campuses based in Coach Lane, London and Amsterdam. It is organised into four faculties — Design and Social Sciences, Business and Law, Engineering and Environment and Health and Life Sciences. As of 2019, Northumbria has around 26,450 full-time students and 2,684 academic and research staff. It had a consolidated income of £254 million in 2018/19. Northumbria is a member of AACSB, the Association of Commonwealth, Universities UK and the Wallace Group.\n\nHistory\n\nNorthumbria University has its origins in three Newcastle colleges: Rutherford College of Technology, which was established by John Hunter Rutherford in 1877 and opened formally in 1894 by the Duke of York (later King George V), the College of Art & Industrial Design and the Municipal College of Commerce.\n\nNewcastle Polytechnic\n\nIn 1969, the three colleges were amalgamated to form Newcastle Polytechnic. The Polytechnic became the major regional centre for the training of teachers with the creation of the City College of Education in 1974 and the Northern Counties College of Education in 1976.\n\nUniversity Status\n\nIn 1992, Newcastle Polytechnic was reconstituted as the new University of Northumbria, as part of a nationwide process in which polytechnics became new universities. It was originally styled, and its official name still is, the University of Northumbria at Newcastle (see the Articles of Government) but the trading name was simplified to Northumbria University in 2002. In 1995, it was awarded responsibility for the education of healthcare professionals, which was transferred from the National Health Service.\n\n2017 Testing Accident\n\nIn 2017, the university was fined £400,000 after a sports science experiment gave volunteers a hundred times the safe dose. Two students volunteering in a study of the effects of caffeine were given a dose of 30g instead of 0.3g, because staff conducting the experiment tried to calculate the dose on a mobile phone calculator and misread the decimal point. Both were hospitalized and one reported loss of short-term memory. A court hearing heard that the university had not trained staff in safety and had not carried out a proper risk assessment, and that the dose was above the level known to cause risk of death.\n\n2020 IT Incident\n\nOn 28 August 2020, Northumbria University's IT infrastructure was the target of a cyber attack. Northumbria University said there had been \"operational disruptions across networks and IT systems\" on Friday the 28th. Student access to the campus was restricted for the following week. Deputy Vice-Chancellor Peter Francis said in a statement that the university is working with external specialists who launched an investigation. Elsewhere in the city, Newcastle University has also reported a \"number of operational issues\" but it is not known at this stage whether the two incidents are linked.\n\nCampuses and location\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe university has two large campuses situated in Newcastle and one in London. City Campus, located in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, is divided into City Campus East and City Campus West by the city's central motorway and linked by a £4 million bridge which in 2008 was officially opened by the former Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Lord Digby Jones.\n\nCity Campus\n\nCity Campus East is home to the Schools of Law, Design and the Newcastle Business School (NBS). NBS and Law are housed in one building, and the School of Design is across a courtyard.\n\nCity Campus East, designed by Atkins, opened in September 2007, winning awards from The Journal newspaper and the Low Carbon New Build Project of the Year accolade.\n\nCity Campus West is home to the Schools of Arts & Social Sciences, Built & Natural Environment, Computing, Engineering & Information Sciences and Life Sciences. Also located on this campus is the University Library, Students' Union building and Sport Central, a £31m sports facility for students, staff and the community which opened in 2010.\n\nThe Sutherland Building, formerly the Medical School of Durham University, which was a naval warehouse during World War II, and the Dental School of Durham University (1945–78) is the home of Administrative Departments including Finance & Planning and Human Resources, using the space vacated when the School of Law moved to City Campus East.\n\nThe Students' Union building, at City Campus West, underwent a multimillion-pound makeover with new lobby and recreational facilities, and a refurbished bar and cafe space, in summer 2010.\n\nIn September 2016 the Sandyford Building was acquired from Newcastle College.\n\nIn 2018 a £7m building for Computer and Information sciences was opened in City Campus West in place of the demolished Rutherford Hall.\n\nCoach Lane\n\nA second campus is located 2.6 miles (4 km) outside of Newcastle, on Coach Lane, and is known as the Coach Lane Campus at Cochrane Park near the A188 (Benton Road). It is in the Dene ward near Longbenton and round the corner from Tyneview Park; a large Department for Work and Pensions office, accessible via the Four Lane Ends Interchange.\n\nThe Coach Lane Campus is home to School of Health, Community and Education Studies. Coach Lane Campus has computing and library services; its own Students' Union, and sports facilities, including indoor courts, a fitness suite, outdoor rugby and football pitches, and an all-weather floodlit pitch. A free shuttle bus scheme runs between the two campuses.\n\nLondon Campus\n\nThe London Campus offers full-time or part-time programmes, from a range of Business, Computing, Cyber, Project Management and Technology focused programmes.\n\nInternational\n\nNorthumbria University has an international campus based in Amsterdam, Netherlands through a partnership with Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences where it offers accredited postgraduate qualifications and the opportunity for undergraduates to experience overseas studies.\n\nOrganisation and structure\n\nNorthumbria describes itself as a comprehensive university, offering 30 of Britain's 32 most frequently chosen academic disciplines.

Newcastle Business School is the only university in the UK to hold double AACSB accreditation for business and accounting which makes them form part of an elite group of 190 institutions worldwide to hold this. As of 2020, The university also holds accreditation for EPAS in 21 different undergraduate programmes, more than any other university in the UK. Newcastle Business School has also developed relations with a wide range of other professional bodies.

Northumbria Law School is located within City Campus East where it shares its building with Newcastle Business School.\n\nNorthumbria also offers 'clinical' courses in law accredited by the Law Society and Bar Council. These allow graduates direct entry to the profession. The institution's Student Law Office is a clinical legal education enterprise, where law students participate in a legal advice and representation scheme on behalf of real clients, under the supervision of practising lawyers. The student law office has managed over 7,000 enquiries and represented over 3,000 clients since 2005. In 2013, the university was awarded with the Queens Anniversary Prize in Further and Higher and Further Education for outstanding community work of its student law office.\n\nMedicine\n\nAlthough the university roots are linked with medicine through the Sutherland building being formerly the Medical School of Durham University, it has not offered medicine as a programme until recently. Northumbria has a joint medical programme through a joint partnership with St George’s University of Grenada. As part of the programme the teaching hours are split between time spent within the Grenada and the United Kingdom. The programme has been expanded in recent years with an increased amount of time that students can spend within the United Kingdom.\n\nAcademic profile\n\nResearch\n\nIn the UK Research Assessment Exercise 2008 some research in nine of twelve areas submitted was described as \"world-leading\".
