        "text": "Overview\n\nNorthumbria University’s Vision for 2025 is to be a research-rich, business-focused, professional university with a global reputation for academic excellence.\n\nThe main aim of their transformation was to better convey their vision and values, and they chose to partner with the Shout team to benefit from our strategic approach to making their estate work harder for them.\n\nFollowing a thorough discovery phase, we channeled the insights we'd uncovered into the design & build of a new web presence - creating a digital platform that better serviced its users, aided by a flexible CMS giving greater publishing control to content authors to create personalised experiences for its diverse audience.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nThe website needed to cater to a diverse set of audiences, each with its own individual needs and behaviours. To do this, the University wanted a website with a content management system that was flexible, scalable, and could deliver personalised experiences.\n\nUsers of the existing University website were experiencing slow load times and confusion when working on the content management system.\n\nThe project to redevelop the University's site required that we migrate all the existing content and integrations from the site's outdated CMS into a new platform.\n\nThe migration would allow for greater control over the presentation and publishing of content. It would also enable multiple users to edit and work on the website's content simultaneously – all without impacting the site's speed or functionality.\n\nThe Outcome\n\nThe Sitecore migration and the improvements made to the Northumbria University website build have given staff the flexibility to create and manage content with significantly more efficiency and accountability.\n\nThe Sitecore experience platform and associated analytics have allowed for the automated personalisation of site content.\n\nContent can now be based on a site visitor's intent – or on a defined persona, based on previous browsing behaviour.\n\nThis functionality has given the teams at Northumbria University a greater understanding of the behaviour and needs of their website visitors.\n\nNorthumbria University staff can now communicate more effectively and personally with their different stakeholders with ease.\n\nThe Sitecore implementation supports every stage of the University as a business, from initial student recruitment through to the onboarding of prospective research candidates and staff members."
