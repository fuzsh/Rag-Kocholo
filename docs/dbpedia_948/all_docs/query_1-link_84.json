        "text": "This is a live page of all the redundancies, restructures, reorganisations, and closures taking place across the sector at the moment. Solidarity to all. This sector is vital to the country’s future and the vandalism to it unconscionable.\n\nThe Open University UCU branch is organising this cross-sector survey about the redundancies. The main questions should take only 5-10 minutes, the optional ones depend on how much you want to write. If you are a current staff member in UKHE, or a former colleague who left the sector, please fill this in to give us a sense of the practices. It is open until 15 September.\n\nThe universities on this list are the ones with announced and confirmed redundancies as well as restructures and interventions that drastically transform the working and learning conditions in their institution. More are rumoured about, and even more have been shrinking staff by not renewing fixed-term contracts or reducing hours of fractional contracts. These cuts are not as visible but are equally impactful, reducing programmes, stretching remaining staff, failing to have any flexibility when a member of staff falls out and the ensuing delays of support for students, etc.\n\nTag us on socials (@qm_ucu), comment below, or email the social media team if you know of any others we should add — ideally include a link to reliable information. Please do not email the coordinator address, those are other teams in the branch.\n\nCurrent redundancy & REstructure programmes\n\nAberdeen, where management in November 2023 announced they would fold Modern Languages. The public response has been immense, compiled here by Aberdeen ucu. In March, they announced compulsory redundancies would be off the table after all. The university is looking for £12 million for the current academic year though it is unclear whether this is a deficit or a shortfall against projected cash generation.\n\nAberystwyth is looking to cut 200 jobs searching for £15 million. This would reduce staff by 8-11 percent. Previously, the university announced they would axe the entire postgraduate teaching course (PGCE).\n\nAston University put 60 academics in the college of engineering and physical sciences at risk of redundancy. There is a Voluntary Severance Scheme open for the entire university.\n\nBangor University’s International College is cutting in administrative staff and permanent tutors. Bangor University International College is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oxford International Education Group (OIEG), a private provider that operates under Bangor University’s brand identity. In previous years, Bangor has been cutting posts and programmes, including its entire Chemistry department.\n\nBedfordshire restructured in the summer of 2023 and all but closed Performing Arts, made redundant 8 members of staff in Media, and reduced the School of arts and Creative Industries dramatically. In Spring 2024, they again opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme for all staff.\n\nBolton has gone through two ‘Mutually Agreed Release Schemes’. MARS1 announced before Christmas, around 40 left, MARS2 currently awaiting decisions. In July 2024, a email revealed more talk about redundancies. The VC proudly announced the Office for Students agreed to a consultation on a name-change though…\n\nThe Arts University Bournemouth has opened a voluntary severance scheme. The terms of the scheme won’t achieve the cost saving aims, according to the joint campus unions’ calculations.\n\nBournemouth University has opened a voluntary severance scheme and compulsory redundancies are on the table. The university is also proposing to cut standard research hours allocation by 50% for all staff. They’re looking for £15 million which is a shortfall against projections.\n\nBradford is cutting staff to find £10 million.\n\nBrighton, who have been in dispute for months. Their senior management tried to make 130 members of staff redundant on 4 May 2023. They have been in dispute for much of the time since, reaching 100 days in their strike. In early January 2024, they were treated to another email announcing a voluntary severance scheme.\n\nBrunel has opened a voluntary severance scheme\n\nCanterbury Christ Church is getting ready to ‘shrink staff’ and have opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme.\n\nCardiff‘s VC wrote to all staff announcing a £35 million deficit; voluntary severance isn’t excluded, but the university is also looking at other ways of generating income. Previously, the university already announced it was planning to cut Ancient Languages. You can sign the petition against that here.\n\nCardiff Metropolitan University has opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme.\n\nChester has opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme again. This is after they went through a gruelling restructure in 2021, putting 86 posts on the line.\n\nCumbria is dealing with redundancies.\n\nCoventry, who have to make £100 million in savings. There is a BBC report and a discussion in University World News. Every department has been hit.\n\nAt Derby, management has opened an ‘Enhanced Resignation Scheme’. This comes after previous voluntary severance schemes in 2019 and in 2022, while the university marked income increase and a decrease in staff cost.\n\nDurham had a Voluntary Severance Scheme open between November 2023 and February 2024.\n\nEdge Hill University announced redundancies in the Creative Arts department. You can sign the petition challenging these cuts.\n\nEssex is planning to force academics on a 45-week teaching programme, which would essentially destroy the idea of university as no research could take place. They’re reneging on the (poor) pay increase negotiated nationally as well as on staff promotions to find £14m to deal with a shortfall, not deficit.\n\nThe University of Exeter has opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme (or ‘Exeter Release Scheme‘ as they call it…).\n\nGlasgow Caledonian opened a ‘Mutual Severance Scheme‘ on 4 March 2024, and re-opened it in June.\n\nGoldsmiths has been going through rough restructuring for the past few years. And now they’re there again. Management has claimed a £13.1m shortfall from budget (not deficit!). They’ve already recovered £10.1 through savings in recurrent costs through VSS, post deletions and cuts to research, and Goldsmiths has healthy cash reserves. The proposed cut of 130 posts would amount to 25% of staff. The local branch has set up a support fund to enable them challenging this; and they are sharing helpful resources.\n\nHeriot-Watt has opened a voluntary redundancy scheme aimed at senior grades (Assoc Prof and Professor) in (and currently only in) the School of Social Sciences. “Alternatives” are being offered, including reductions to working hours, unpaid career breaks for senior grades, and secondments to the Dubai campus.\n\nThe University of Hertfordshire is currently going through a redundancy process for several schools, including: 6 posts in Law, 5 posts in Creative Arts, and up to 16 posts in Health, Medicine and Life Sciences.\n\nUniversity of the Highlands and Islands has had multiple Voluntary Severance Schemes, redundancy rounds, and course closures affecting the constituent colleges — including closing entire campuses which served rural communities. Voluntary severance has been taken up with compulsory redundancies expected to follow over the summer.\n\nHuddersfield put 100 jobs at risk in the umpteenth iteration of redundancy processes. In Spring 2024, management announced they were seeking 12% cut in staff (or 200 posts), all compulsory redundancies, after the waves of voluntary severance. This lead to the loss of the national nuclear research centre. Their management had offered £5000 one-off payment to those who took redundancy, to encourage uptake. In early July they tried to renege on that agreement.\n\nHull opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme in Spring 2024, through which about 100 members of staff left. In June 2024, the university announced even more staff redundancies, seeking another staff reduction of nearly 150. In August 2024, the university confirmed it would close the chemistry department because it does not deem the courses financially sustainable.\n\nKeele has opened a voluntary redundancy scheme, inviting 2,300 staff members.\n\nKent had a threat of compulsory redundancies, which some voluntary departures seemed to have averted, and then the compulsory redundancies came back. Since February 2024, they’ve got a portfolio of what has to go. By late March 2024, the university announced cutting some of the key departments in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, including Anthropology, Art History, Health & Social Care, Journalism, Music & Audio Technology, Philosophy/Religious Studies, Human Biology and Behaviour and the MSc in Ethnobotany. Kent is axing not only jobs (58 staff are at risk of redundancy), but entire programmes and departments.\n\nKingston has put its world-renowned Philosophy department ‘under review’. This comes after the university axed subjects that had been excelling in research for years, including Politics, International Relations, Human Rights, History, etc. in 2021-22. The local branch kept a record here.\n\nLancaster is terminating a number of fractional contracts.\n\nThe University of Central Lancashire is facing a deficit of £25 million and is seeking to make 5% of its staff redundant. They have opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme and is looking to cut 165 posts. 100 people left voluntarily, but in June 2024, management issued a further notice threatening up to 157 post, including compulsory redundancies. This comes after multiple restructures in the last few years, in 2019, 2021, 2023, and now 2024.\n\nLeeds Beckett opened a Voluntary Severance Scheme.\n\nLincoln is closing their language department, and has announced a voluntary severance scheme. They are looking to make 220 redundancies — about one tenth of all staff. Up to half may come from the initial VSS, but over 100 jobs will be scratched through either further schemes or compulsory redundancies. The sum of savings sought for keeps changing: it started at 20% of budget, which became £20 million, and then £30 million. Management has by now announced they already made savings of £24 million through VSS and other cost cutting measures but is not ruling out compulsory redundancies.\n\nLiverpool Hope had a Voluntary Severance Scheme open over Christmas for staff on Grade 7 and above — i.e.: getting rid of securely-employed and adequately-remunerated teaching & research posts. Watch out for upcoming fixed-term posts to do the same teaching, we guess?\n\nSt Mary’s University Twickenham has opened a Mutual Resignation Scheme at the end of May 2024.\n\nMiddlesex has cut into arts in the first instance, broadening to devastating the entire research community. They closed the Museum of Domestic Design & Architecture with the loss of 4 jobs, proposed removing the Interpretation & Translation academic area with the loss of 6 academic posts. Other smaller units have been closed one or two at a time, gradually escalating. While the Theatre Arts department still technically exists, all 13 members of staff in the department were put at risk of redundancy in the restructure. After repeated failures to properly consult with the UCU branch and staff affected throughout the process, just two of these staff have retained their jobs. Before this restructure was fully completed Middlesex University announced, without giving prior notice to the unions, that they are embarking on a further wide-scale restructure across the university where 181 jobs are now being ‘deleted’, taking the total to over 200+ potential job losses.

In April 2024, another Voluntary Severance Scheme was announced, sent to over 800 members of staff, through which the university sought to lose 150 colleagues.

The university has not opened its reward scheme or promotion scheme since 2022 and currently there is a freeze on future staff appointments. The University is also in the planning stages of incorporating a wholly owned subsidiary company to employ future staff who will not be allowed access to the Teacher’s Pension Scheme (TPS) or Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS), instead being forced to accept an inferior defined contribution scheme where employer contributions will reduce significantly. This will create an inequitable, two-tier workforce, and staff are concerned that there will be pressure for existing staff to be moved on to the inferior scheme.\n\nThe University of York had a Voluntary Severance Scheme for staff in Professional Services in 2023, and a wider voluntary severance scheme in April 2024.
