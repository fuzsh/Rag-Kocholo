William Golding (1911 - 1993) won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983. He was knighted in 1988, and was awarded the prestigeous Booker prize in 1980. The Nobel Foundation cited: "his novels which, with the perspicuity of realistic narrative art and the diversity and universality of myth, illuminate the human condition in the world of today."

Golding SIGNED relatively few of his books. That this is also SIGNED by a fellow author to whom Golding presented his work makes it extra special.

First published in 1956, and reprinted several times. Remainder mark on bottom of pages.
