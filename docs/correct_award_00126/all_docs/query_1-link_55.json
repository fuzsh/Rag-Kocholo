        "text": "One of Cornwall's only Nobel Prize winners is from Newquay - and none other than William Golding, the author of Lord of the Flies.\n\nThe Rites of Passage writer was born in September 1911 in his grandmother's house on Mount Wise in the seaside town. The property was known as Karenza, which means love in Cornish.\n\nHe spent many holidays there, but grew up in Wiltshire.\n\nHis Cornish mother, Mildred Curnoe, was a campaigner for female suffrage. Golding used to describe her as \"a superstitious celt\" who used to tell him Cornish fairy tales.\n\nGolding had several occupations during his lifetime. He became a writer, a schoolmaster and even an actor.\n\nIn 1939 he married Ann Brookfield.\n\n\"My parents fell in love the first time they met,\" Golding's daughter Judy wrote in The Children of Lovers: A memoir of William Golding by his daughter.\n\n\"Both were engaged to others. It was the spring of 1939 and they came face to face at a meeting of the Left Book Club in London. An hour or so later, they found themselves alone together, walking deliriously up the Strand, talking in rapid French.\n\n\"For the rest of their lives, they were always by far the most important people in the world to each other, bar none, absolutely none: friends, lovers, children, grandchildren.”\n\nDuring the second World War, he joined the Royal Navy. He served as a lieutenant and took part in the D-Day Normandy landings.\n\nIn 1954 his first novel, Lord of the Flies, was published - after many rejections.\n\nIn it, Sir William famously portrayed a group of British schoolboys who, when marooned on a deserted island by a plane crash during a global atomic war, lose their social inhibitions and regress into bloodcurdling tribal savagery. Golding’s argument in his novel is that, left to their own devices under strain, people will adopt extreme positions of human nature\n\nIt later inspired two films, was translated into 26 languages, sold millions of copies and became a standard on college and school reading lists.\n\nSir William was 73 when he won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1983, and he was knighted in 1988.\n\nHe wrote many other novels, including The Inheritors (1955), Pincher Martin (1956) and Rites of Passage (1980), for which he won the Booker Prize.\n\nHe also wrote a play, a book of short stories, two collections of essays and a travel book.\n\nIn 1985, Golding and his wife moved to Tullimaar House, a beautiful mansion in Perranarworthal, near Truro.\n\n\"It’s such a ravishing, pretty house,\" Judy previously said.\n\n\"He always said the reason we could afford it was because it’s beside such a busy road, the A39 linking Truro and Falmouth. But the house itself isn’t visible from the road, so it was a very good find.\"\n\nBuilt in the early 1800s, the house had been occupied by American troops during the Second World War and US General Dwight D Eisenhower had stayed there in the run-up to D-Day in 1944.\n\nThe guest bedroom overlooks Restronguet Creek.\n\nLiterary critic John Carey wrote Golding's definitive biography in 2009, after having had access to previously unseen archive, including three unpublished novels, two autobiographical works and a journal of two million words written over 20 years.\n\nIn the biography, Golding comes across as a man of deep introspection, who drank heavily to sustain himself.\n\n\"Things like his war experience, the nervous breakdown of his own son David, who had been born with a club foot, and his inability to write as the years went on contributed to this drink problem,\" Professor Carey said.\n\nThe biography relates how, in an unpublished memoir, Golding confessed to trying to rape a girl called Dora.\n\nThe revelation about the attempted rape is made in a work entitled Men, Women and Now. It describes how Mr Golding first met Dora when both were taking music lessons in Marlborough, Wiltshire. He was about 16 and she was 13 at the time.\n\nWhen he was home two years later, during his first year at Oxford, he convinced himself she would welcome his advances and tried to force himself on her during a walk.\n\nDora resisted and Golding, recalling the incident years later, wrote he had \"made such a bad hand at rape\" before shaking her and shouting: \"I'm not going to hurt you.\" Dora ran off.\n\nThey met again two years later and consummated their relationship.\n\nMr Carey is convinced Golding was ashamed about his relationship with Dora, even though in Men, Women and Now, he wrote that she was \"depraved by nature\".\n\nMr Carey says Golding \"was aware of and repelled by the cruelty in himself and was given to saying that, had he been born in Hitler's Germany, he would have been a Nazi. Dora seems to have played her part in this self-knowledge\".\n\nGolding died of heart failure eight years later on June 19, 1993. His body was buried in Wiltshire."
