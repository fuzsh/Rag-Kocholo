        "text": "(1911–93). The British novelist William Golding won the Nobel prize for literature in 1983 for his novels dealing with the human condition. His first book, Lord of the Flies, attracted a cult of followers, especially among the youth of the post–World War II generation.\n\nWilliam Gerald Golding was born in Newquay, Cornwall, England, on September 19, 1911. He was educated at Marlborough Grammar School, where his father taught, and at Brasenose College, Oxford, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1935. After working in a settlement house and in small theater companies, he became a schoolmaster at Bishop Wordsworth’s School in Salisbury in 1939. He joined the Royal Navy in 1940 and took part in World War II. After the war he resumed teaching at Bishop Wordsworth’s.\n\nGolding published Lord of the Flies in 1954 (film, 1963 and 1990). The story portrays a group of schoolboys isolated on a coral island who gradually abandon all moral constraints and revert to savagery, including ritualistic murder. The novel reflected Golding’s belief that “man produces evil as a bee produces honey.” It reportedly was rejected by 21 publishers before it finally appeared to lukewarm reviews. A paperback edition released in the United States in 1959, however, achieved cult popularity and a financial success that allowed Golding to quit teaching in 1961.\n\nGolding continued to examine the essential violence and depravity of human nature in later novels, such as The Inheritors (1955), in which the last Neanderthals are destroyed by clever, weapon-wielding Homo sapiens, and The Spire (1964), a tale of vainglory and obsession in a medieval clergyman. Pincher Martin (1956) tells of the guilt-filled reflections of a naval officer who faces an agonizing death after his ship is torpedoed, and Darkness Visible (1979) follows a boy horribly burned in the London blitz during World War II. Rites of Passage (1980) won the Booker prize and inspired two sequels, Close Quarters (1987) and Fire Down Below (1989). His other novels include Free Fall (1959), The Pyramid (1967), and The Paper Men (1984).\n\nGolding was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966 and knighted in 1988. He died in Perranarworthal, Cornwall, on June 19, 1993."
