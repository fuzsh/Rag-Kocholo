        "text": "13 William Golding: Lord of the Flies\n\nDr. Liji Varghese\n\nAllegory\n\nAllegory is a popular literary device that is used to convey a secondary level of signification other than the primary level of meaning, through symbolic figures or events. The two levels combine to create a deeper level of signification that the author wishes to impart. Often in an allegory, the primary level of meaning is literal and can be understood directly without any other reference. The secondary level of signification is often hidden and only a close perusal of the characters or action will reveal its latent possibilities. Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress and George Orwell’s Animal Farm are some among the famous allegories in literature.\n\nAllegory is often used by writers to enrich their literary cosmos by making it multidimensional. This device is also used to project the author’s moral or political perspective in a veiled manner. Characters in allegory generally become personifications of abstract ideals like virtues and vices, moral perspectives, religious tenets and so on. Imagery is highly relevant in an allegory as it serves to heighten the allegorical significance of a particular situation or event. Most religious texts offer ample examples for allegory as they often emphasise a latent level of meaning as well.\n\nSimon is also an allegorical representation of Christ as he is the saviour figure in the narrative and yearns for peace and harmony. He represents an innate spirituality that often finds a resonance in the tranquillity offered by Nature. Like Christ, he too is killed by the others for attempting to convey the truth. Piggy is the intellectual of the group who symbolises the rational and logical self. He is a pragmatist who tries to logically analyse the plight of the boys. When he is cruelly murdered by Roger, Golding demonstrates how our innate savagery strangles the voice of reason. Roger, Jack’s close associate, is a sadistic and perverse boy who represents the most malevolent aspects of human nature. Jack’s rule offers Roger the chance to unleash his demonic nature and he readily pounces on the chance.\n\nSamneric (Sam and Eric), the identical twins become the allegorical representation of civilized society. They try to behave civilly under the leadership of Ralph but when faced with Jack’s unmitigated savagery, they shift their loyalties. The big boys in the group, along with Samneric stand for crowd mentality. They shift their loyalties in relation to the undercurrents of power. They are also indicative of the ruling class who change their loyalties according to the changes at the power centre. The little boys in the novel symbolically represent the masses who prefer being led. They do not have a distinct perspective and are quickly swayed by the rhetoric of those in power. Thus Golding’s novel teems with characters and settings that are enriched by their allegorical dimensions. Lord of the Flies tries to hold a mirror to contemporary society which has degraded humanity to the level of crass bestiality. Golding’s pessimistic cosmos is shaped by his own disheartened vision of the modern, war-ridden world. Nevertheless, through his creative cosmos, Golding tries to make the contemporary world aware of its shortcomings. And as Dickinson rightly comments, “If Lord of the Flies “teaches” through its moral allegory, it is the lesson of self-awareness” (26).\n\nSimon’s encounter with the Lord of the Flies is reminiscent of Christ’s conversation with the devil in the wilderness. While Christ attains victory over the devil, Simon cannot boast of such a claim as he realises that the evil he is trying to fight is within their hearts. Though he comprehends its real nature, he is helpless to act against it. Therefore, one may even perceive Simon as a defeated Saviour who is not able to realise his spiritual potential. The evil mocks him and warns him of his dire fate and he is left with no option but to run. Nevertheless, his spiritual fortitude urges him to warn his friends and it is during this attempt that he is murdered viciously. Simon thus dies for no fault of his own but his sacrifice does not liberate the other boys from their state of sin. Instead it reinforces the social schism straining the lives of the boys. His death aggravates their collective guilt and they perform more savage acts so as to exorcise its memory from their minds.\n\nThe title of the novel is also steeped in Biblical allusions as the eponymous Lord of the Flies is a reference to Beelzebub. As the novel progresses, the young boys become increasingly dirty and violent and soon become fit subjects for the grotesque Lord of the Flies. In the narrative, Beelzebub is the “beast” whose physical manifestation is the sow’s head impaled on a stick and covered with flies. Jack and his gang venerate the Beast and try to assuage its lust for blood. Simon is the lone figure who fights against the lure of the beast. His conversation with the Beast is captured in a surrealistic passage that highlights his helplessness and heightened awareness. The Beast says to Simon, “ ‘Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!’ said the head. For a moment or two the forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoed with the parody of laughter. ‘You knew, didn’t you? I’m part of you? Close, close, close! I’m the reason why it’s no go? Why things are what they are?’\n\nGolding’s dystopic creative cosmos offers a critique of Ballantyne’s naïve and implausibly optimistic narrative that idealises human nature. The names of the characters are retained so as to indicate a deeper parallel between the two divergent worlds depicted in the novels. This contrast is ironically presented at the end of the narrative when the Naval officer who is unaware of the events that had transpired on the island unwittingly says, “Jolly good show. Like The Coral Island” (LF 230). Through this gauche and misplaced comment Golding explores the shallowness of idyllic stories which masks human nature by eulogisingits finer aspects and negating its savagery. The officer’s expectation of ideal behaviour from British youth is also ironically projected as a construct that had been created to further the Imperialist design. Golding’s novel thus becomes an ironical re-reading of stereotypical portraitures. And as James R. Baker aptly points out, “Ballantyne, . . . is a fabulist who asks us to believe that the evolution of affairs on his coral island models or reflects the adult world, a world in which men are unfailingly reasonable, co-operative, loving and lovable. In choosing to parody and invert this image, Golding posits a reality the tradition has generally denied”.\n\nNevertheless, the pessimistic tone of the narrative is tempered by the presence of characters like Ralph, Piggy and Simon who symbolise man’s capacity to fight evil. They do not embrace their darker side like the rest of the boys and assiduously cling to the societal and moral norms that govern human behavior in a civilized society. Though they constitute the minority, they are steadfast in their adherence to rules and committed to the concept of “what’s right’s right” (LF 195). Ralph’s survival at the end of the narrative also represents a victory; albeit a minor one.\n\nGolding also examines the social evolution of evil as the novel is set in the backdrop of a nuclear war which necessitates theevacuation of the boys. The background of war and violence critiques the nature of evil exhibited by the boys. Are they mimicking the actions and attitudes of the adult world or are they conditioned by a world which advocates meaningless violence? The ending of the narrative remains ambivalent as the Naval officer who rescues Ralph and the boys seem to be preoccupied with the war raging on in his world. As his eyes “rest on the trim cruiser in the distance” (LF 230),the narrative is again left open-ended. Though Ralph is given a brief respite from the ordeals he faced on the island, there is no escape from the larger question of violence as he is returning to a world ruined by the ravages of war.\n\nSymbols of Civilization\n\nThe conch shell represents the spirit of democracy. It stands for man’s reasoning faculty and functions as an ordering principle. When Ralph and Piggy find the conch shell, they use it to summon the other boys and it bestows a sense of legitimacy to their endeavours as only the boy who holds the shell is given the privilege to speak. It becomes a symbol of democratic power and it can be noticed that though Ralph is comfortable wielding its influence, Jack is vexed by its presence right from the beginning. As the rift between the boys becomes prominent, the conch shell also loses its significance. Ralph and Piggy try to cling on to the vestiges of democratic ideals by insisting on the shell’s significance but Jack and his group constantly derides its authority. And when Piggy is brutally crushed by a rock, the conch is also destroyed, thereby annihilating all traces of culture from the island. The destruction of the conch shell heralds complete anarchy which is mirrored in the ensuing hunt for Ralph.\n\nyou can view video on William Golding: Lord of the Flies\n\nReference"
