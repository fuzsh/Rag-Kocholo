        "text": "Picture a middle-aged, middle-class English man, probably younger than his appearance, with a look so conventional it could almost be deliberate. He is a teacher at a respectable grammar school in Salisbury. It happens to lie in the shadow, half a mile away, of its wealthy, glamourous neighbour — Marlborough, one of England’s most famous public schools. He wears a battered tweed jacket with leather elbow patches, the classic characteristics of an English chap, possibly a little dull but decent. That man is William Golding filmed in the 1950s for Arena’s illustrious predecessor BBC TV’s Monitor.\n\nThat conventional chap was perhaps the most daring, imaginative and original novelist of the whole post-war period. He wrote and published four novels before he felt he could relinquish the security of his teaching job. Those four novels, all unique, each one totally different from the others, each one a tour de force, each one emotionally and intellectually challenging in the extreme.\n\nFree Fall followed Pincher Martin; the second book was The Inheritors but it was his first which secured Golding’s prestige forever. Lord of the Flies is the most conventional in form and narrative but it’s just about perfect. The story of a group of schoolboys around the age of ten whose plane has crashed on a desert island, with all the adults on board dead, to survive, the boys form their own society with its own rituals and hierarchies. It’s a morality tale that brings you face to face, whatever your codes or politics, with what Golding called ‘the darkness of man’s heart’.\n\nGolding was haunted by the action he saw serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War; perhaps he sought peace, teaching in a safe school in a safe part of Britain, raising a pint with his friend James Lovelock in the local to celebrate Lovelock’s formulation of the Gaia theory.\n\nRemarkably, Golding and Lovelock lived in the same village. Golding eschewed the fashionable, back-biting world of literary London — ‘I live down here where they can’t get me.’ With his beard and passion for sailing, he was given the nickname Captain Birdseye at his publishers, Faber & Faber. Maybe Captain Birdseye at first sight, but look again and you might see Merlin.\n\nThe term ‘magical realism’ was dreamt up to describe the works of the great Latin American writers, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes, J L Borges, they revealed the surreal in everyday existence. Golding was ahead of the game. The Inheritors is told from inside the minds of a family of Neanderthals as they confront the arrival of an unforgiving new species, Homo Sapiens. It’s a book of stunning ambition and originality.\n\nThis Arena was the third film to be made about Golding. Following Monitor, our great rival The South Bank Show devoted an episode to him while he was still alive. The two films provided director Adam Low with invaluable archive of Golding at two stages of his life. The Arena adds the fascinating perspective of his daughter Judy and son David, who had never appeared on television to talk about him before. The intimacy of their recollections reveal a private man, uninterested in playing the fame game. Self-deprecating, mildly eccentric, he left fanfares for his work to others. His legacy is incomparable, it was an honour to make this film.\n\nAnthony Wall\n\n4 November 2020"
