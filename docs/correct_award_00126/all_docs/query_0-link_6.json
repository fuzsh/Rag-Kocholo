        "text": "STOCKHOLM, Oct. 6\n\nThe Swedish Academy today awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to the British novelist William Golding, author of ''Lord of the Flies,'' whose books plumb the nature of evil in man. But a senior member of the jury, in a rare public dissent, challenged the decision.\n\nAppearing as is traditional at the stroke of 1 P.M., Lars Gyllensten, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, announced the unexpected choice in the ancient institution's offices in the Stockholm stock exchange.\n\nAn academy citation said the 72-year-old Mr. Golding had won the prize ''for his novels which, with the perspicuity of realistic narrative art and the diversity and universality of myth, illuminate the human condition in the world of today.'' Seventh Briton to Win\n\nMr. Golding, who learned of the award in the Wiltshire village where he lives and writes, became the seventh British author to win the literary prize since it was first given in 1901. Established by the will of the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the prize is worth $191,815, or 1.5 million Swedish kronor.\n\nConversing with journalists, Mr. Gyllensten, a powerful figure in the ranks of the elderly, 18-member Swedish Academy, described Mr. Golding as ''a fascinating and exciting writer'' whom he had first read in the 1950's after the appearance of ''Lord of the Flies.''\n\nMr. Gyllensten stressed that the academy sought to single out writers who were still active. ''The impact of his complete oeuvre has increased of course,'' he said of Mr. Golding, who in the late 1950's was something of a cult figure. In 1980, Mr. Golding won Britain's coveted Booker Prize.
