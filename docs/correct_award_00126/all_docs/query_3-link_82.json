        "text": "1. “LORD OF FLIES’’ (WILLIAM GERLAD GOLDING)\n\n3. ABOUT WILLIAM GOLDING WRITING STYLE GOLDING THEMES LIST OF WORKS AWARDS\n\n4. WRITING STYLE • His writing is very distinctive from other authors, avoiding complex and poetic descriptions. • Golding work is mostly allegorical(symbolic). • His writing style mostly includes classical literature, Christian symbolism and mythology(one belonging to a particular religions).\n\n5. GOLDING THEMES • Theme in William Golding’s work is that ; man is savage(uncontrolled) at heart, always ultimately reverting back to an evil and primitive nature. • He often compared man with characters from the Bible to give more vivid(clear) picture of his descent(origin or background of family, falling).\n\n6. LIST OF WORKS • POETRY Poems • DRAMA THE Brass Butterfly\n\n7. • NOVELS The Inheritors Pincher Martin\n\n9. Rites of Passage Close Quarters\n\n10. The Scorpion God Darkness Visible\n\n11. AWARDS • NOBEL PRIZE William Golding was Awarded Nobel Prize in 1983 for his novel “LORD OF THE FLIES”. • BOOKER PRIZE He was also awarded BOOKER PRIZE in literature.\n\n12. THEME • in LORD OF THE FLIES • By WILLIAM GOLDING\n\n13.  Civilization vs. Savagery  Individualism vs. Community  The Nature of Evil  Man vs. Nature  Dehumanization of Relationships  The Loss of Innocence  The negative consequences of war\n\n14. Civilization vs. Savagery The overarching theme of “Lord of the Flies” is the conflict between the human impulse towards savagery and the rules of civilization which are designed to contain and minimize it. Golding suggests that while savagery is perhaps an inescapable fact of human existence, civilization can mitigate its full expression .\n\n15. Individualism vs. Community One of the key concerns of Lord of the Flies is the role of the individual in society. Golding thus suggests not only that some level of communal system is superior to one based on pure self- interest, but also that pure individual freedom is an impossible value to sustain within a group dynamic, which will always tend towards societal organization.\n\n16. The Nature of Evil Golding’s nature rejects supernatural or religious accounts of the origin of human evil. The novel is not entirely pessimistic about the human capacity for good.\n\n17. Lord of the Flies introduces the question of man’s ideal relationship with the natural world. Thrust into the completely natural environment of the island in which no humans exist.\n\n18. Dehumanization of Relationship In Lord of the flies, one of the effects of the boys descent into savagery is their increasing inability to recognize each others humanity. Throughout the novel, Golding use imagery to imply that the boys are no longer able to distinguish themselves.\n\n19. The negative consequences of war In addition to its other resonances, Lord of the Flies is in part an allegory of the cold war. Thus, it is deeply concerned with the negative effects of war on individuals and for social relationships. Composed during the cold war, the novels action unfolds from a hypothetical atomic war between England and the Reds which was clear world for communists. Golding thus presents the non-violent Tensious that were unfolding during the 1950’s.\n\n20. SUMMARY\n\n21. MAIN POINTS • A group of English school boys find themselves stranded on a deserted island after their plane crashes over the Pacific. Those who survive the crash elect Ralph, one of the oldest boys, as their leader. • Ralph argues that the group’s main goals should be to have fun, survive and maintain a smoke signal to catch the attention of the outside world.\n\n22. • The boys quickly lose interest in the day-to-day tasks Ralph wants them to perform, like building shelters. Instead of working, they waste their time paying and hunting pigs. • When Jack defies Ralph’s authority , the boys degenerate into a savage tribe. They set fire to the island in an effort to drive Ralph out of hiding. A British warship, seeing the smoke, stages a rescue. Ralph and other children are saved\n\n23. • Summary A group of English school boys are marooned on a jungle island with no adults after their plane is shoot down in the middle of the war. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy find a conch shell. Ralph blows into it like a horn and all the boys on the island assemble. At the assembly, a boy named Jack mock Piggy for being fat and runs against Ralph to become chief of group. Ralph wins election and declares Jack the leader for group’s hunters. Soon after Ralph, Jack and other boy named Simon explore the island and discover wild\n\n24. Pigs. At a second assembly the boys set up rules to govern themselves . The first rule is that whoever wants to speak at an assembly must hold the conch . At the meeting, one young claims, he saw a beast in the jungle, but Ralph dismisses it as just the product of a nightmare. Ralph then suggested that they build a signal fire at the of mountain, so any passing ships will see its smoke and rescue them. The boys use piggy’s glasses to light the fire. But they are careless and set accidently part of forest in fire. The boy who saw the beast vanishes during the fire and he never seen again. Time passes and tensions rise. Ralph become frustrated when no one helps him build shelters. Lots of\n\n25. Boys goof off while Jack obsesses about hunting and take every opportunity to mock Piggy who is smart but weak. Simon mean while often wanders off into the forest to meditate. The rivalry between Ralph and Jack erupts when Jack forces the boys who were supposed to watch the signal fire, come hunting with him. They kill their first pig but a ship passes while the signal fire is out which causes a tremendous argument between Ralph and Jack. Jack challenges Ralph’s authority at an assembly. Ralph wins but Jack leave the group and most of the older boys join him. Jack’s tribe paint their faces, hunt and kill a pig. Then they leave their head as an offering beast. Simon\n\n26. Comes upon the head and see’s that it’s the lord of the flies. The boys corner Ralph on the beach where they first set up their society when they crash landed on the island. Ralph evades the other boys who are hunting for him, then realizes that they are setting the forest on fire in order to smoke him out and thus will destroy whatever fruit is left on the island. But the burning jungle has attracted a British Naval ship and an officer is standing on the shore. The boys stop, stunned and stare at the man. He jokingly ask if boys are playing at war. When Ralph says yes the officer is shocked and\n\n27. disappointed by them. Ralph start to cry and soon the other boys start crying too. The officer uncomfortable looks away toward his warship.\n\n28. Quotes\n\n31.
