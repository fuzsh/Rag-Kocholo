        "text": "Modern education system focuses on teaching the students beyond the class room. It emphasizes on imparting values into them, teachers and family come together to take up the responsibility of their overall development. However there is always a generation gap between the young ones and their guardians, for this, William Golding’s ‘Lord of the Flies’ acts as a bridge by providing insights into adolescent behaviour. William Golding was a Nobel laureate for literature from England. He started his career as a teacher and later joined army. At the age of twelve, his unsuccessful attempts to write turned him into a brat; Golding himself confesses that he enjoyed hurting people. His magnum opus ‘Lord of the Flies’ is about how a group of young boys become violent when they are left unsupervised and their immediate transition to their innocence, once they are confronted by authority. It addresses two major issues i.e., bullying and peer pressure that every adolescent comes across. The objective of the paper is to discuss the relevance of “Lord of the Flies” in the current society for understanding and handling the issues of adolescents and thus guide them in a better way. Key Words: Bullying, Peer Pressure, Violence, Education system, Youngsters.\n\nThis paper reconsiders William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. Allegorical writings can illustrate ethical, social or psychological and moral issues using the manipulation of images that have stipulated meanings other than their meanings as imitations of the actual world. Allegory has been used widely throughout history in all forms of art, and comprehensible for the reader, conveys hidden meanings through symbolic figures. Lord of the Flies had been written in relation to historical circumstances of the twentieth-century and to the personal experience of William Golding. Also, it has provided a critical analysis of the novel that treated the prominent perspective and elements in it. The novel is a parallel of life in the late twentieth century, while it looks like society a stage of enhancement in technology whereas, human morality is not completely mature yet. “Lord of the Flies is an allegorical microcosm of the world. The destruction of World War II because of the dictators who ini...\n\nThis Study sheds a new light on William Golding’s view of evil and good in Lord of the Flies. For many writers, critics and theorists, evil is a societal construct, while good is an internal one. Both are structured by external factors. William Golding, however, believes that man has an inherent potential for evil and that it cannot by any means be a cultural product as has long been thought. Man’s potential for good, on the other hand, is dictated by law, common sense, culture and from the fact that man’s social engagement with others is inevitable. In Lord of the Flies, Golding seeks to give answers to the philosophical questions: Can man live a lone? Can there be a life in the absence of law and order? What would become of people should there be no society or civilization? Golding’s central argument centers on critiquing the inherent potential of man’s capacity for evil in the absence of law and order. In this study, there will be an examination of Golding’s pessimistic view of g...\n\nThe study investigates the fact that man is evil by nature and this evil surfaces itself when it finds favorable circumstances. These favorable circumstances make themselves available in the removal of societal rules and parental control. Golding connects the evil nature of man to the Original Sin, when Adam did something sinful by violating the command of God in the Garden of Eden. When the boys feel that they are free from parental control and there is no check of the teachers, they start to violate rules on the Island and even go to the extent of killing each other and there is a reversion to barbarism. In the beginning, the boys behave rationally as they have recently been coming from a civilized society but with the time they regress to savagery and barbarism, they feel themselves above the law free from societal disciplines. The study is significantly significant in the sense that it familiarizes the readers with the psyche of human beings who will, consequently, be conscious ...\n\nThis paper is an attempt to prove the assumption that William Golding is a failure who claims to have written his novel Lord of the Flies on the idea of human nature. He considers that he wrote about human nature in general, but he is a Western and has those ideas of being superior to other people. He takes all his characters from among the English boys. Not a single character who is shown as civilized belongs to a marginalized race. This act of Golding reveals his ethnocentric attitude. He does not bother to include a female character in this novel. All his characters are male. It shows his androcentric nature. Though he tries to put the evil like every man whenever he wants to show the brutality or savagery of a human, in the form of his chosen English boys, he portrays them as the hunters of Africa or paints them with mud. In doing so, he is affiliating savagery with the blacks and Indians. Thus, he propagates the same stereotypical concept of “Orients” as uncivilized and savages..."
