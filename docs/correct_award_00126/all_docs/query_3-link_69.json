        "text": "I hoped that the Albanian writer Ismail Kadare would win this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature—but, then, I hope that every year. Kazuo Ishiguro’s en-Nobelment is a surprise; I wonder how many readers had thought of him as a likely contender. (A graduate of the University of East Anglia’s creative-writing school, where he was a student of Angela Carter, he may well be the first product of a creative-writing course to win the Nobel.) On reflection, however, you can see how his work shares similarities with another British laureate, William Golding: both writers have been drawn to allegory, and to historical fiction and fantastical exploration (Ishiguro’s most recent novel, “The Buried Giant,” is set in sixth- or seventh-century Britain; Golding’s “The Inheritors” is about a Neanderthal family); and both writers have practiced a kind of brilliantly imperturbable purity—they have supremely done their own kind of thing, calmly undeterred by literary fashion, the demands of the market, or the intermittent incomprehension of critics.\n\nI’ve been one of those critics. I greatly admired Ishiguro’s early novels, such as “An Artist of the Floating World,” from 1986, and “The Remains of the Day,” from 1989 (the latter seems an almost perfect book). But “The Unconsoled” (1995), narrated by a concert pianist and set in an unnamed Central European city, too closely inhabited the miasmic, drifting, dreamlike state it sought to evoke. I thought that “The Buried Giant”(2015)—apparently admired by at least one member of the Nobel committee—was an allegory at once too literal and too vague. (Ancient Britain has been plunged into a nationwide historical amnesia nicknamed “the mist,” which turns out to be the breath of Querig, a tyrannical she-dragon that must be slaughtered. Enough said.)\n\nBut surely “Never Let Me Go” (2005), is one of the central novels of our age, in part because Ishiguro perfectly mixes realism and dystopian fantasy to produce an allegory of deep and lingering power.\n\n“Never Let Me Go” is set in a boarding school called Hailsham, and flatly narrated, in a style of almost punitive blandness, by a young woman named Kathy. Hailsham seems banally similar to any British school of its ilk, and it’s only very gradually that we begin to discern the enormous differences: it is in fact a school for cloned children, whose organs are being harvested for ordinary, luckier, non-cloned British citizens. The cloned children will eventually be “called up,” and forced to donate a kidney or a lung. By the fourth “donation,” sometime in their early twenties, they will “complete”; they will die, having served their function.\n\nThe blandness of the novel’s narration, though initially frustrating, is a large part of the book’s success. The somewhat excruciating style works against the fantasy of the novel’s premise; it deglamorizes the element of science fiction. Like Kafka’s great novel “The Castle,” the story is so caught up in its own humdrum obstacles and frustrations, its characters so trapped in the very mill of the banal, that it doesn’t really resemble allegory. And Kathy’s mundane recitation of the facts also enacts a hideously meek (and familiarly English!) resignation: this is the way it is, there’s no point in trying to change the terms of the game or jump the queue.\n\n“Never Let Me Go” is a beautiful and terrifying book because it works so well at different levels: it is a kind of parody of English boarding-school books; it is a critique of certain emergent medical technologies; and, above all, it is a suggestive allegory of how all of us live. For it is our similarity to, not our difference from, the cloned kids of Hailsham that is finally shocking. They bicker and fight, dream and create, fall in love and have sex, like schoolkids everywhere. But because we know that they will soon be dead, their lives seem, to us, like cruel parodies of normal, healthy, free existence. Yet can’t our own lives also be seen as parodies of real freedom? Just because we have the promise of living to eighty rather than twenty, why do our lives take on a metaphysical significance that is automatically denied to the abbreviated existences of the cloned teen-agers? Our lives will also, one day, “complete.” The cloned kids are living out their short death sentences; surely our own lives are merely longer death sentences? “Never Let Me Go” looks at our life span on this earth, and comes to the same bleak conclusion as Pascal once did (except, of course, that Pascal believed in God as our necessary salvation from this bleakness). “Imagine a number of men in chains,” the French philosopher wrote, “all condemned to death, some of whom are executed daily in sight of the rest; then those who are left see their own fate in that of their fellows, and, regarding each other with sorrow and without hope, wait till their turn comes: this is a picture of man’s condition.”"
