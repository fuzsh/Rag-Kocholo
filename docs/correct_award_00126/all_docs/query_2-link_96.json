        "text": "William Golding (1911-1993) was a British novelist, best known for his classic Lord of the Flies. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983. In addition to his novels, Golding also wrote plays, essays, reviews, short stories, poems and a travel book about Egypt. He challenged himself to diversify the subject matter of his novels. Golding died of a heart attack in Perranarworthal, Cornwall, England. He was survived by his wife and their two children, David and Judith.\n\nWilliam Golding’s first novel was Lord of the Flies, published in 1954. Below is a list of William Golding’s books in order of when they were originally released:\n\nPublication Order of To the Ends of the Earth Books\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Short Story Collections\n\nPublication Order of Non-Fiction Books\n\nPublication Order of Plays\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nNote: Pincher Martin was also published as The Two Deaths of Christopher Martin.\n\nIf You Like William Golding Books, You’ll Love…\n\nHerman Melville\n\nArthur Conan Doyle\n\nKurt Vonnegut\n\nWilliam Golding Synopses: Lord of the Flies is a standalone title by William Golding. A plane crashes on a desert island and the only survivors, a group of schoolboys, assemble on the beach and wait to be rescued. By day they inhabit a land of bright fantastic birds and dark blue seas, but at night their dreams are haunted by the image of a terrifying beast. As the boys’ delicate sense of order fades, so their childish dreams are transformed into something more primitive, and their behaviour starts to take on a murderous, savage significance.\n\nIn The Inheritors by William Golding, eight Neanderthals encounter another race of beings like themselves, yet strangely different. This new race, Homo sapiens, fascinating in their skills and sophistication, terrifying in their cruelty, sense of guilt, and incipient corruption, spell doom for the more gentle folk whose world they will inherit."
