        "text": "Novelist AS Byatt and critic John Carey have been announced as the winners of Britain's oldest literary awards.\n\nThey were awarded James Tait Black Memorial Prizes, following in the footsteps of acclaimed writers including DH Lawrence and Evelyn Waugh.\n\nThe prizes are for the best work of fiction and the best biography published during the previous 12 months.\n\nIt is the only major British book award judged by scholars and students.\n\nMan Booker prize winner Byatt was given the fiction prize of Â£10,000 for her novel, The Children's Book.\n\nByatt said: \"I am excited and delighted to win the James Tait Black Prize. It is a very distinguished and long-established award and I am happy to be amongst its list of winners.\n\n\"And I am also happy to have been chosen amongst such a strong and varied shortlist.\"\n\nLiterary critic Carey was awarded the Â£10,000 biography prize for his book William Golding: The Man Who Wrote Lord Of The Flies. Golding himself was a James Tait Black prize-winner in 1979.\n\nCarey said: \"I'm enormously pleased and honoured... not just for myself but for William Golding, the subject of my biography.\n\n\"He won the fiction section of the prize himself with his novel Darkness Visible in 1979, and I think he would be tickled pink to know he had made it a double.\""
