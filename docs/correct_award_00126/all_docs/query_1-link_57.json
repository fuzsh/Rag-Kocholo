The violent gestures, the look of greed, and the faces of experience are all real.\"\n\n● Peter Brook: Lord of the Flies from the Criterion Collection. \"In the hands of the renowned experimental theater director Peter Brook, William Golding's legendary novel about the primitivism lurking beneath civilization becomes a film as raw and ragged as the lost boys at its center. Taking an innovative documentary-like approach, Brook shot Lord of the Flies with an off-the-cuff naturalism, seeming to record a spontaneous eruption of its characters' ids. The result is a rattling masterpiece, as provocative as its source material.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Flies: Evacuation during WW2 by Alyssa Rose, Graduate Student, Edtech Program, Boise State University, 9th Grade English teacher in Spring Hill, TN.
