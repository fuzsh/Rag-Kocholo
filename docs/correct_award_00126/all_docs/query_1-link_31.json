        "text": "This research investigates the significance of the conch shell in the novel Lord of the Flies written by William Golding. The focus of this research is to examine the meaning of the conch shell as one of the most important symbols and to observe the dynamic of the main characters in relation to power. The research applies textual formalism approach to uncover the meaning of the symbol. Furthermore, this research is also supported with sociological approach to relate the literary work with the reality of the social condition during that era and to get a better understanding of the characterization of the main characters in the novel. The main data used in this research is the novel Lord of the Flies. To support this analysis, additional data is taken from various sources such as books and academic journals. The result of this analysis shows that conch is symbol of democratic power and order. Furthermore, the conch leads us to understand that we must have rules and authority to maintain a safe environment. Without them, utter chaos is inevitable.\n\nAmalia, F. (2014).
