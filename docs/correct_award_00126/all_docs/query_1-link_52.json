        "text": "William Golding began writing Lord of the Flies in 1951, while he was a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth’s School in Salisbury.\n\nAfter the manuscript had been rejected by a number of leading publishing houses, Golding finally sent the tatty typescript to Faber & Faber, together with an accompanying letter. It had already been rejected by the firm’s reader when it was spotted by a new and aspiring editor, one Charles Monteith, who was allowed by the firm to take it on, provided significant cuts were made. These were made by Golding, after extensive correspondence with Monteith. Given a new title, Lord of the Flies, it became one of the most iconic novels of the 20th century.\n\nA fascinating new Literary Pursuits programme was aired on BBC Radio 3 this week, exploring the story behind the publication of Lord of the Flies. We have assembled a few pieces from the Faber archive and the William Golding Estate to illustrate this programme, which you can catch up on here.\n\nLetters exchanged between Golding and Faber & Faber\n\nWilliam Golding to Faber & Faber, 14 September 1953\n\nWilliam Golding’s original submission letter for Lord of the Flies, then named Strangers From Within. It was annotated by the Faber Reader at the time: ‘Time: the Future. Absurd & uninteresting fantasy about the explosion of an atom bomb on the colonies. A group of children who land in jungle country near New Guinea. Rubbish & dull. Pointless. Reject.’\n\nTaken from Faber & Faber: The Untold Story by Toby Faber\n\nCharles Monteith to William Golding, 30 December 1953\n\nMonteith’s letter to Golding at the end of 1953 contains his thoughts on the characterisation of Simon.\n\nWilliam Golding to Charles Monteith, 10 January 1954\n\nIn response to the last letter, Golding sends through the final text and confirms he has incorporated all of Monteith’s edits: ‘I’ve lost any kind of objectivity I ever had over this novel and can hardly bear to look at it.’\n\nCharles Monteith to William Golding, 25 February 1954\n\nMonteith’s letter to Golding suggesting various edits to the text, including the new title suggestion of Lord of the Flies, which was already part of an important episode in the story.\n\nAlternative titles for Lord of the Flies, 19 February 1954\n\nLord of the Flies comes to the big screen\n\nWilliam Golding and Peter Brook, director of the film Lord of the Flies, Cannes Film Festival, 1963\n\nLord of the Flies was first made into a film in 1963, written and directed by Peter Brook, and produced by Lewis M. Allen.\n\nPhoto Credit: Tom Hollyman\n\nGolding’s lifelong relationship with Lord of the Flies\n\nGolding continued to reflect on the publication of Lord of the Flies twenty years on from its release, seen here in the following extracts taken from his journal:\n\nWednesday 22 December 1971\n\nA dream in which I turn up an old letter from Charles Monteith. In it he says that ‘despondently’ none of the alterations I have made to the typescript of Lord of the\n\nFlies leads him to believe I shall ever make anything of it.\n\nThursday 6 June 1974\n\nTwenty years after writing Lord Of The Flies, I now see that Ralph who weeps for the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart, was weeping for an age that is passing. Seen from the other side, the heart of man is not dark, but flamelit and terrible. Perhaps then Jack and his hunters had the heart of the matter after all.\n\nAll journal extracts Copyright © William Golding Limited. All rights reserved."
