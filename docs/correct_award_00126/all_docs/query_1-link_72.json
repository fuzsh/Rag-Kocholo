        "text": "William Golding was born on 19 September 1911. His birthplace is St. Columb Minor Cornwall that is located in England. Golding got his birth in 47, Mount Wise, Newquay Cornwall which was the house of his maternal grandmother. The name of this house was Karenza. It is a word from the Cornish language which means love.\n\nHis mother’s name was Mildred. She was basically Cornish. She was a suffragette. She actively took part in women’s rights campaigns. She worked hard for women’s right to vote. His father`s name was Alec Golding. He served as a schoolmaster in Marlborough Grammar School in Marlborough, Wiltshire. He was an atheist.\n\nHe never believed in emotions and always preferred rational thinking. Unlike his father, Golding had a strong faith in Christianity. He remained afraid of the angry and short temper of his parents and particularly of his mother. He always regretted the atheist beliefs of his parents.\n\nGolding started his early education at his father`s school, Marlborough Grammar School. When Golding was young he was inspired by H.G Wells, Edgar Rice and Jules Verne. Golding started writing stories when he was 7 years old. When he became twelve years old, he started composing novels. His early writings remained unsuccessful. This became the reason for his frustration. He used to hurt people. In the words of Golding, he enjoyed hurting people.\n\nIn the 1930s, he completed his primary education and got admission at Brasenose College at Oxford University. His father desired him to become a scientist. For the next two years, Golding studied science but never succeeded because of his lack of interest. His feel for writing and taste of literature compelled him to get admission in a course in English literature. He left the subject of science. He completed his B.A. degree with second class honours in 1934. In 1934, when Golding was not graduated, yet he published the collection of poems with the name of Poems.\n\nAfter graduation, Golding worked at different places. He worked in theatre. He also served in settlement houses. With the passage of time, he decided to adopt the profession of his father. After his graduation, he taught Music and English at Maidstone Grammar School from 1938-1940. Afterwards, he taught English and Philosophy in 1939. He then taught English literature at Bishop Wordsworth’s School, Salisbury in Wiltshire from 1945 to 1962.\n\nGolding met different students during teaching who worked as stimulation of his most famous novel, Lord of the Flies. Though Golding loved teaching as a profession, but to serve his country, he joined the Royal Navy in World War 2.\n\nGolding spent six years of life on a boat. He worked with Lord Cherwell at a naval research establishment in New York. During services, he developed a love for sailing. He worked as a destroyer. He also served in the attack of Normandy.\n\nIn World War 2, Golding became more close to the behaviour of people. As a teaching, the experience of the Navy also helped him in his fictional career.\n\nOn 30 September 1939 Golding got married to Anna Brookfield. Anna was a chemist. They had two children. The first is David. He was born in 1940. Their second child is Judith. She was born in 1945.\n\nAfter a long journey and 21 rejections, in 1954, Golding published his most acknowledged novel “Lord of the Flies.” It was initially titled “Strangers from within” in 1951. But due to many rejections, Golding revised the novel and its title. Thus it was published as “Lord of the Flies.” The story of the novel revolves around young boys left on a destroyed island. This novel focused on the evil side of human nature. The novel prophesied about Golding`s future works, in which he kept on tracing the internal conflict of humans.\n\nGolding retired from teaching in 1963. Peter Brook made a film about his novel. In 1983, at the age of 73 Golding got the Nobel Prize for his literature skills. In 1988, Queen Elizabeth honoured him with the title of Knight. In 1990, “Lord of the Flies” was released with a new version. This effort was made to grab the attention of the new generation.\n\nIn the last few years, Golding spent time with his wife. They shifted to Tullimaar House at Perranarworthal, Cornwall. It was very near to Truro. He never stopped his writing. On June 19, 1993, Golding got a heart attack. This became the reason for his death. He died at Cornwall. His body was buried in the Parish Churchyard. After his death, his new work was published with the name of the Double Tongue.\n\nGolding began his writing profession as a poet yet having failed to pick up greatness began to compose novels. It was through novels that his artistic virtuoso came to be perceived. Despite the fact that his underlying interest was in poetry compositions, it is his one of a kind composition style which has won the enthusiasm of his readers. In any case, his compositions despite everything have numerous affinities with the verse in its smoothness and allegorical quality which gives it a one of a kind pinch of creative excellence.\n\nA tale by Golding radiates uncommon independence and force with the joined power of its specialized virtuosity and striking composition style. Oldsey and Weintraub have properly remarked that Golding’s innovation in writing is a lot like that of Eliot’s in the stanza. Indeed, his composition mirrors a style which is reluctantly current and excitingly mutable in the topic.\n\nHis style is a structure which rises above every single creative constraint uncovering a range and force suggestive of the author’s vision. Hence, the components of style in Golding’s various anecdotal works make a fascinating investigation.\n\nStyle shifts from writer to writer. Golding`s style changes from novel to novel, concerning occurrence. The style he utilizes in “Fincher Martin” isn’t really the equivalent in “The Spire” as specifically the components are regulated for their proper execution in singular books. A specific trademark which generally hangs out in his writing style is its visual force. It is an exposition which is realistic and clearly elucidating. From his first novel, ‘Lord of the Flies’ to ‘Fire Down Below’ Golding is so perfect in his portrayals that perusing turns into craftsmanship with the readers.\n\nThe tale wherein he has substantiated himself an illustrative author is ‘The Spire’ where he has utilized his astounding innovative capacity to portray the development of the tower. In spite of the fact that it is a perplexing record, yet by the sheer power of his composition the reader gets the adventure of a nearly numerical precision of depiction. Walter Sullivan, with respect to Golding’s writing in this novel, appropriately remarks that Golding is stunningly better than Dickens or Tolstoy.\n\nSullivan further comments that the reader gets the inclination that if the genuine tower were to tumble; Golding could coordinate its remaking piece by piece. It along these lines becomes clear that a complicated depiction like the structure of a tower without a moment’s delay turns into a clear show-stopper in his adroit hands.\n\nA feeling of suggestiveness is very evident in Golding’s exposition. This suggestiveness and interestingness are made through the assistance of imagery and symbolism. These totally mix in his attempts to give straightforwardness in his metaphorical works. His imagery is a perpetual campaign among great and detestable. On this angle, Walter Allen appropriately remarks that imagery possibly works when it is incorporated into the activity, characters and tone of the novel.\n\nGolding clearly underwrites imagery as it totally coordinates into the fundamental activity and characters in his books. Through his scenes, a representative impact is likewise accomplished. In practically all of his books, his exposition works symbolically or figuratively to offer solidness to his thoughts. Dicken-Fuller on her panoramic perception of Golding’s imagery remarks that it goes about as an instrument for his examinations, as this permits him to investigate the potential outcomes of his topics from numerous points of view and in a wide range of contexts.\n\nThe different imagery present in his works renders an uplifted feeling of importance to singular occurrences and once in a while to the novel all in all. For instance, in ‘Lord of the Flies,’ the characters, activity and scene work emblematically. Simon is an image of goodness and he is a Christ-figure. Jack connotes abhorrent while Piggy is delineated as an image of knowledge. The primary activity here is the battle among great and underhandedness.\n\nThe scene comprises the ocean, speaking to peril; essentially, Simon, Piggy and the pilot are totally washed away by the ocean. The cut-off leader of the pig is an image of abhorrence which is performed in the encounter scene. Likewise, Castle Rock additionally works as an image of shrewdness where Piggy’s demise happens. Along these lines, Golding utilizes imagery in ‘Lord of the Flies.’ The above lines mirror Golding’s order over language in exposing the consequences of a symbolical structure.\n\nWilliam Golding uses dreams and flashbacks in several of his novels in different situations. Flashbacks and dream successions give emblematic importance to his different works since they bring into the center the complex inward psyche of the characters. For example, the reader comes to think about Jocelin’s physical desiring for Goody Pangall simply after the disclosure of his fantasy in ‘The Spire.’\n\nGolding’s exposition is matter-of-reality. His expression and sentence designs uncover an upset mood and the dull elevates the strain in the passage. The fantasy is reminiscent of Jocelin’s sexual desires just as his feelings of trepidation. Along these lines, Golding’s language uncovered the complexities of the inner mind psyche of the hero.\n\nThrough imagery Golding can make unmistakable the theoretical or impalpable items present in his books. In ‘Pincher Martin,’ for example, it is imagery alone that gives the novel its phenomenal characteristics of an extraordinary bit of creative work. The imagery here structures a mind-boggling and complex example in the novel. In fact, the novel peruses like a troublesome sonnet which Oldscy and Weintraub portray as the passionate and scholarly force of poetry.\n\nHere, a lifeless thing like a stone is given a lot of criticalness through sheer style. Other than the stone, the ocean, the sky, rocks, lobsters and limpets, the dark lighting, the dim cellarage, flying reptiles are often rehashed pictures which discover noticeable quality in the novel. Aside from ‘Pincher Martin’, ‘Lord of the Flies’, ‘The Inheritors’ ‘The Spire’ and ‘The Paper Men’ additionally have large amounts of symbolism.\n\nImagery escalates the lovely quality in Golding’s composition style and gives a synesthetic impact to these works.\n\nAn investigation of William Golding`s composition would stay deficient without contemplating the wonderful poetic style utilized by him. His graceful style is an exceptionally unconstrained gadget utilized fundamentally to communicate a psychological perspective. For example, ‘The Inheritors’ proceeds by the sheer power of poetic magnificence and beauty. Its creative triumph lies in Golding’s capacity to convey us into a universe of creative mind where our progenitors lived under abnormal conditions. In the expressions of Kinkead-Weekes and Gregor, the experience of style gets away from negligible confinement and starts to convey us inventively into the oddness of living. To make the story legitimate, Golding’s utilization of language is generally pertinent with its mix of lovely power and reasonableness. This can be seen on page number 220 of this novel.\n\nThe said page of ‘The Inheritors’ uncovers Golding’s composition with an excellent sharpness of detail; the lines contain a wonderful surface which loans a nature of effortlessness to the demonstration of sobbing. Golding gets the picture of a water rodent moving to differentiate Lok’s outright quietness. In this way, there is an advantageous contradictory picture between brisk surge and quiet figure. The difference encourages the readers to understand the desolate figure of Lok.\n\nThe following section underscores the response of Lok after his revelation of Liku’s remaining parts and her doll. In flawless detail, Golding portrays the demonstration of sobbing and gives it a graceful measurement by his utilization of periphrasis. He doesn’t depict tears in an immediate way yet does it richly with a lucky scope of graceful poetic usage.\n\nGolding’s exposition is essential of a genuine kind and just infrequently are there circumstances of mind, parody and funniness. Scenes of high satire give a comic impact which helps in backing out the strain. In ‘Rites of Passage’ Colley’s story takes up the significant part of the novel where he is at first engaged as a comic character yet winds up strangely as a heartbreaking one.\n\nDespite the fact that the comic scenes here are constrained, they help in the presentation of characters. With respect to occasion, the scene when a feast of marrow bones delighted in at the Captain’s table by Talbot, Summers and Oldmeadow, is portrayed in a light and silly vein. This can be found on Page number 166 of the said novel.\n\nThe lines on the page show that it is an exemplary case of a comic scene. Here the objective of cleverness is Brocklebank who incites giggling by his fatuousness. The language has fluctuated, clever, and exact, and the style enlivened. It is funniness of the ridiculous kind which makes the entire scene incredible as sinking into the seat cleared by Summers causes the last to seem like a footman.\n\nThe readers can’t neglect to find an ironic tone in the author with respect to the gawky quirks of Brocklebank. In addition, the scene is likewise a sort of abnormality from an increasingly difficult circumstance at the opposite finish of the boat where poor Colley is dying.\n\nAnother tale where the comic component discovers prevalence is ‘The Pyramid.’ It is a novel which has the characteristics of a social satire and now and again even fringes on jokes. It has large amounts of silly scenes. The first part itself has some cumbersome circumstances; for instance, when Evie powers Oliver to have intercourse in the slope in full perspective on the occupants underneath, in the town of Stilbourne.\n\nGolding utilizes an exceptionally accurate and trite style in this novel uncovering a softness of tone which is very invigorating. John Whitehead, with respect to the style in ‘The Pyramid’, sees that it is hard sculptural writing which he thinks owes something to Hemingway at his best; the words striking the readers as though they were rocks gotten straight from a brook. This can be found on page number 16 of the book.\n\nThis page in the book clearly depicts the presence of Evie Babbacombe. The lines have a fake genuine tone which on the double suggests that Oliver isn’t besotted with the young lady in a really genuine way. It likewise proposes a relationship which would not keep going long due to its abnormally easy-going way of treatment. The eye-lashes of Evie being contrasted with a bunch of little paintbrushes is in itself a trivial analogy.\n\nBen Jonson satirized the habits and flaws of man by using comedy of humour. Golding has ridiculed class structure and the scoundrels in the public arena by using comedy of manners. Satire shapes a vital component in the writing of Golding. It is said that writing is the best possible vehicle of satire which depends on a strategy for contrast. In fact, every novel of Golding is a kind of parody on contemporary society which principally rotates around degenerate individuals.\n\nIn ‘The Paper Men,’ he utilizes a lack-lustre and an in-animated style to mock the current situation with scholastics. S.J.Boyd remarks that his writing style is exhausted and wearisome, negative and critically uninterested at its own ungainly and platitude-ridden nature. It is tired proving inability to consider less style. Indeed, ‘The Paper Men’ helps one to remember the clear mocking tone present in Pope’s ‘An Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot”. ‘Darkness Visible’ is another significant novel where Golding mocks wrongdoing and viciousness that describe the late twentieth century. ‘The Pyramid’ and ‘Rites of Passage’ are parodies on class structure. Once more, due to a hidden degree of importance, his books are for the most part symbolic.\n\nIrony is regularly utilized by Golding to propose a distinction between what is communicated and what is really the situation. It is found in the vast majority of his books particularly in his initial seven works which he composed somewhere in the range of 1954 and 1971. Golding makes an unexpected surface through the very premise of his plot development. With respect to the case, in ‘The Pyramid,’ the engraving on the tomb of Bounce Dawlish peruses “Paradise is music” which in itself is amusing taking into account that Bounce had an exceptionally baffled life because of her guilty pleasure in music.\n\nLikewise, ‘The Scorpion God’ is additionally a superb model written in the soul of unexpected parody. Another valid example is the portrayal of ‘The Inheritors’ which is an amusing one being what they are, that the Neanderthalers are quite not normal for the Horpo sapiens who are barbarous and ruthless. This is directly opposite to the epigraph which makes the Neanderthal man the germ of the monster in legends. John Peter appropriately asserts that Incongruity of this sort is consistently significant to a creator who wishes to be challenging. Along these lines, Golding makes a certain tone of incongruity in his books.\n\nA trait of Golding’s composition style is a component of suspense. Until the end of the story, the reader is kept in excruciating tension regarding how it would end; and the closure is frequently surprising with the famous bend to it. For example, in ‘The Paper Men,’ the reader is surprised when the narrator-protagonist, Barclay, is shot dead by Rick Tucker.\n\nIn ‘Darkness Visible,’ the suspense is kept alive till the end with respect to the seizing plot prompted by Sophy; and furthermore on how Matty’s life would end. There is a cover of a puzzle encompassing the universe of Golding so he causes the reader to overlook him and get submerged in the thick riddles present in his books. His reflective exposition with its mix of anticipation fits impeccably the necessities of his story.\n\nThe foundation and environment which Golding makes in his books are another of his expressive devices. Golding is pulled in towards the darker side of life, not on the grounds that it is his propensity but since through this negative mentality he causes the reader to notice the heavenly and the otherworldly in a roundabout manner. In ‘Free Fall,’ ‘The Pyramid’ and ‘Darkness Visible’ he portrays a contemporary setting, a commonplace 20-century society where English public activity is delineated.\n\nIt is a universe of wrongdoing and reclamation, of showings and conviction, of affection in the mud. In ‘The Pyramid’ it is made very clear when he looks at clean Imogen with messy Evie who begins from the earth that possessed a scent like rot, with picked bones and characteristic remorselessness — life’s latrine. Golding’s utilization of a wide assortment of sentence designs uncover his emphasis on foundation and climate; his utilization of unique terms like rot and common cold-bloodedness proposes his disposition in his books.\n\nRather than his rich portrayals of nature, Golding’s characters talk in pithy, vernacular composition, which both ground the books in its time and place and mirrors the breakdown of correspondence through the span of the books. In Lord of the Flies,’ the young men utilize a decent arrangement of slang, alluding to the island as “wizard” and “wacco,” British slang words from the 1950s for extraordinary or cool.\n\nPiggy talks in ungrammatical slang, as when he says that no one knows that the boys are on the island. Piggy’s discourse recognizes him as lower class than different young men, as does the way that he has no guardians, and was raised by an auntie who possesses a sweet shop. His class status further isolates him from his companions. Ralph and Jack are progressively lucid.\n\nHowever Ralph ends up speechless in the midst of extreme feeling, and depends on physical presentations: As the young men lose their human advancement, their discourse turns out to be less rational and composed, and by the end they’ve reverted to a type of pre-discourse, ululating, shouting, yelling, groaning, and, at last, crying, having everything except lost the capacity to convey.\n\nIt would thus be seen that Golding has a flair for composing a plain style without adornment. He is never hypercritical, nor does he show his scholarly ability. However, Golding has earned the fame of being a dark essayist. His obscurity isn’t at all purposeful. It is absolutely in light of the fact that he places much mind and astuteness in not very many words, and this training makes his style exceptionally systolic as opposed to diastolic. Subsequently, Golding’s exposition is to be perused with care and once the reader aces the craft of perusing in the middle of the lines, his books can be altogether appreciated.\n\nSo if critics discover his writing demanding, minimal, precise, incredibly diagonal and circular it would potentially well go for a new review of his works. Golding’s motivation has consistently been clear. With respect to example, he would not have taken such a great amount of torment to make his expectations justifiable in “Radio Times” in regards to the novel ‘Pincher Martin’ had he truly needed to stay dark to his important audience. It is certainly obvious, as Kermode takes note of, that a novel by Golding requests unremitting attention."
