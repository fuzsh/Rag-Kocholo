        "text": "William Golding (born September 19, 1911, Newquay, Cornwall, England—died June 19, 1993, Perranarworthal, near Falmouth, Cornwall) was an English novelist who in 1983 won the Nobel Prize for Literature for his parables of the human condition. He attracted a cult of followers, especially among the youth of the post-World War II generation.\n\nEducated at Marlborough Grammar School, where his father taught, and at Brasenose College, Oxford, Golding graduated in 1935. After working in a settlement house and in small theatre companies, he became a schoolmaster at Bishop Wordsworth’s School, Salisbury. He joined the Royal Navy in 1940, took part in the action that saw the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck, and commanded a rocket-launching craft during the invasion of France in 1944. After the war he resumed teaching at Bishop Wordsworth’s until 1961.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nName That Author"
