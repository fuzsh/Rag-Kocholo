        "text": "PINCHER MARTIN\n\nGolding, William\n\nLondon Boston: Faber and Faber, 1979. Reprinted Paperback Edition. Wrappers. ASSOCIATION COPY: SIGNED by the Author on the half-title & SIGNED & dated \"1985\" by the recipient, Canadian poet Greg Gatenby on the free front endpaper, 12mo (7 1/4\" x 4 5/8\"),, green-black-white pictorial wrappers with image of a man in foaming water, 208 pages. Near Fine / None. Item #3295\n\nISBN: 057106809X\n\nWilliam Golding (1911 - 1993) won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983. He was knighted in 1988, and was awarded the prestigeous Booker prize in 1980. The Nobel Foundation cited: \"his novels which, with the perspicuity of realistic narrative art and the diversity and universality of myth, illuminate the human condition in the world of today.\"\n\nGolding SIGNED relatively few of his books. That this is also SIGNED by a fellow author to whom Golding presented his work makes it extra special.\n\nFirst published in 1956, and reprinted several times. Remainder mark on bottom of pages."
