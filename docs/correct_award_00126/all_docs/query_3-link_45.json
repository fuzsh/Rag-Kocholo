        "text": "William Golding was born in Cornwall in 1911, and was, therefore, a child during the Great War of 1914-18, which cast a dark shadow on the prevailing optimism, derived from the Victorian period, about human progress. He attended Marlborough Grammar School, and from there went up to Oxford, originally with the intention of reading science, though he switched subjects and graduated in English in 1933. Like his father before him, he became a teacher. In 1939 he married, and a year later volunteered for the Royal Navy, in which he served until 1945. He saw action, took part in the D-Day landings in Normandy, and rose to the rank of lieutenant. After the war he returned to teaching, taking a post at Bishop Wordsworth’s School, Salisbury, a boys’ school. In 1954, Lord of the Flies, his first published novel, met with some critical attention, but it was not until 1962 that he was able to retire from teaching to become a full-time author. His publications are: Lord of the Flies, 1954 (made into a film in 1963); The Inheritors, 1955; Pincher Martin, 1956; a play, The Brass Butterfly, 1958; Free Fall, 1959; The Spire, 1964; The Hot Gates, 1965; The Pyramid, 1967; The Scorpion God, 1971; Darkness Visible, 1979; Rites of Passage, 1980; A Moving Target, 1982; The Paper Men, 1984. Several universities have conferred Honorary Doctorate Degrees on him. He won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Booker McConnell in 1980, and in 1984 he was given the Nobel Prize for Literature, the highest of all literary awards."
