        "text": "Sir William Gerald Golding CBE (19 September 1911 - 19 June 1993) was an English poet, novelist, and playwright, best known for his debut novel, Lord of the Flies.\n\nLife[]\n\nYouth[]\n\nGolding was born in his grandmother's house, 47 Mountwise, St Columb Minor,[1] Cornwall[2] and he spent many childhood holidays there.\n\nHe grew up at his family home in Marlborough, Wiltshire, where his father (Alec Golding) was a science master at Marlborough Grammar School (1905 to retirement). Alec Golding was a socialist with a strong commitment to scientific rationalism, and the young Golding and his elder brother Joseph attended the school where his father taught.[3] His mother, Mildred (Curnroe),[4] kept house at 29, The Green, Marlborough, and supported the moderate campaigners for female suffrage.\n\nIn 1930 Golding went to Oxford University as an undergraduate at Brasenose College, where he read Natural Sciences for 2 years before transferring to English literature.[5] Golding took a B.A. (Hons) Second Class in the summer of 1934, and later that year his debut collection, Poems, was published in London by Macmillan, through the help of his Oxford friend, anthroposophist Adam Bittleston.\n\nMarriage and family[]\n\nGolding married Ann Brookfield, an analytic chemist,[6](p161) on 30 September 1939 and they had 2 children, Judith and David.[2]\n\nWar service[]\n\nWilliam Golding joined the Royal Navy in 1940.[7] During World War II, he fought on board a destroyer, briefly involved in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship Bismarck. He also participated in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, commanding a landing ship that fired salvoes of rockets onto the beaches, and then in a naval action at Walcheren in which 23 out of 24 assault craft were sunk.[8] At the war's end, he returned to teaching and writing.[2]\n\nCareer[]\n\nIn September 1953, Golding sent a manuscript to Faber & Faber of London. Initially rejected by a reader there, the book was championed by Charles Monteith, then a new editor at the firm. He asked for various cuts in the text and the novel was published in September 1954 as Lord of the Flies. It was shortly followed by other novels, including The Inheritors, Pincher Martin and Free Fall.\n\nPublishing success made it possible for Golding to resign his teaching post at Bishop Wordsworth's School in 1961, and he spent that academic year in the United States as writer in residence at Hollins College, near Roanoke, Virginia. Having moved in 1958 from Salisbury to nearby Bowerchalke, he met his fellow villager and walking companion James Lovelock. The 2 discussed Lovelock's hypothesis that the living matter of the planet Earth functions like a single organism, and Golding suggested naming this hypothesis after Gaia, the goddess of the earth in Greek mythology.(Citation needed)\n\nIn 1970, Golding was a candidate for the Chancellorship of the University of Kent at Canterbury, but lost to the politician and leader of the Liberal Party Jo Grimond.\n\nThe ONDB asserts that \"At the end of the twentieth century, Golding's reputation was at its highest in continental Europe, particularly in Belgium, Holland, Germany, and France\".[9]\n\nDeath[]\n\nIn 1985, Golding and his wife moved to Tullimaar House at Perranarworthal, near Truro, Cornwall, where he died of heart failure 8 years later, on 19 June 1993.(Citation needed) He was buried in the village churchyard at Bowerchalke, South Wiltshire (near the Hampshire and Dorset county boundaries). He left the draft of a novel, The Double Tongue, set in ancient Delphi, which was published posthumously.[10][11] He is survived by his daughter, the author Judy Golding, and his son David, who still lives at Tullimaar House.\n\nGolding's later novels include Darkness Visible (1979), The Paper Men (1984), and the comic-historical sea trilogy To the Ends of the Earth, comprising the Booker Prize-winning Rites of Passage (1980), Close Quarters (1987), and Fire Down Below (1989).\n\nWriting[]\n\nFiction[]\n\nGolding's often allegorical fiction makes broad use of allusions to classical literature, mythology, and Christian symbolism. No distinct thread unites his novels (unless it be a fundamental pessimism about humanity), and the subject matter and technique vary. However his novels are often set in closed communities such as islands, villages, monasteries, groups of hunter-gatherers, ships at sea or a pharaoh's court.\n\nHis debut novel, Lord of the Flies (1954), dealt with an unsuccessful struggle against barbarism and war, thus showing the moral ambiguity and fragility of civilization. It has also been said that it is an allegory of World War II.\n\nThe Inheritors (1955) looked back into prehistory, advancing the thesis that humankind's evolutionary ancestors, \"the new people\" (generally identified with Homo sapiens sapiens), triumphed over a gentler race (generally identified with Neanderthals) as much by violence and deceit as by natural superiority.\n\nThe Spire (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a mediæval cathedral church (generally assumed to be Salisbury Cathedral); the church and the spire itself act as a potent symbols both of the dean's highest spiritual aspirations and of his worldly vanities.\n\nHis 1956 novel Pincher Martin concerns the last moments of a sailor thrown into the north Atlantic after his ship is attacked. The structure is echoed by that of the later Booker Prize winner by Yann Martel, Life of Pi.\n\nGolding's 1967 novel The Pyramid comprises 3 separate stories linked by a common setting (a small English town in the 1920s) and narrator. The Scorpion God (1971) is a volume of 3 novellas set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band ('Clonk, Clonk'), an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God') and the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary'). The last of these is a reworking of his 1958 play The Brass Butterfly.\n\nRecognition[]\n\nGolding won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1979, and was awarded the Booker Prize for literature in 1980 for his novel Rites of Passage, the 1st book of the trilogy To the Ends of the Earth.\n\nIn 1983 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, a choice which was, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \"an unexpected and even contentious choice, with most English critics and academics favoring Graham Greene or Anthony Burgess\".[9]\n\nGolding was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire,[12] and in 1988 was appointed a Knight Bachelor.[13]\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nThere have been 2 film adaptations of Lord of the Flies: a black-and-white movie directed by Peter Brook released in 1963, and a 1990 color adaptation directed by Harry Hook.[14]\n\nLord of the Flies was adapted by Nigel Williams into a play, originally performed in 1995.\n\nIn 2008, The Times ranked Golding 3rd on their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[15]\n\nPublications[]\n\nPoetry[]\n\nPoems.
