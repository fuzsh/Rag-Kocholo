        "text": "William Golding's biography\n\nWilliam Golding was a British novelist and playwright whose experiences during World War II profoundly influenced his literary work.\n\nBritish author William Golding was born on 19th September 1911, in Newquay, Cornwall. He spent his childhood in Marlborough, Wiltshire, where his father worked as a science master at Marlborough Grammar School. Golding's mother, Mildred, a campaigner for female suffrage and a Cornish native, often regaled him with ghost stories from her childhood, instilling in him a fascination with the supernatural.\n\nIn 1930, Golding enrolled at Brasenose College, Oxford, initially studying Natural Sciences before switching to English for his final two years. During his time at Oxford, he developed a close friendship with Adam Bittleston, an anthroposophist who later assisted in the publication of Golding's book of poems in 1934, titled Poems.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Golding embarked on a teaching career. In 1935, he joined Michael Hall School in Streatham, South London, where he taught English for two years. He then pursued a Diploma of Education at Oxford before becoming a schoolmaster at Maidstone Grammar School from 1938 to 1940. In April 1940, Golding joined Bishop Wordsworth's School in Salisbury, where he taught English, Philosophy, Greek, and drama until December 1940 when he joined the Royal Navy.\n\nGolding served in the Royal Navy during World War II and actively participated in significant events. He was briefly involved in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship Bismarck while serving on a destroyer. On D-Day, he commanded a landing craft that fired rockets onto the beaches during the invasion of Normandy. He also saw action at Walcheren, where a significant number of assault craft were lost.\n\nThroughout his life, Golding struggled with alcoholism, which he considered a long-standing crisis. He openly acknowledged his difficulties with alcohol and its impact on his personal and professional life. Golding's struggles with alcohol influenced his writing process, often exacerbating writer's block and emotional turmoil. Despite his personal challenges, Golding found solace in the works of psychologist Carl Jung.\n\nIn 1971, he embarked on a journey to Switzerland to explore Jung's landscapes and began keeping a journal to record and interpret his dreams. This journal spanned over 22 years and served as a significant source of introspection for Golding, providing insights into his novels and reflections on his life.\n\nGolding's literary career gained worldwide recognition with the publication of his most celebrated work, Lord of the Flies, in 1954. The novel explores the dark side of human nature through a group of young boys stranded on a deserted island. Golding's unique portrayal of the inherent evil within individuals captivated readers and established his reputation as a masterful storyteller.\n\nIn 1980, Golding won the Booker Prize for his novel Rites of Passage which was published the same year. Rites of Passage was the first of a trilogy called To the Ends of the Earth that explores a voyage to Australia in the early nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1983, Golding was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his profound and deeply philosophical body of work. The prestigious honour acknowledged his ability to explore the complexities of human behaviour and morality. He was knighted in 1988 for his contributions to literature."
