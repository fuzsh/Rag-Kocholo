        "text": "William Golding is interviewed in 1959, shortly after the publication of his fourth novel, 'Free Fall', and while still working as a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth's School in Salisbury. Golding talks candidly about the process of writing a novel and the painstaking craftsmanship that he brings to his work. He discusses his interest in archaeology and his love of sailing and the sea, all subjects that have found an outlet in his books, and explains his fascination with exploring what lies behind the surface of everyday life.\n\nGolding was to leave teaching in 1961, when his success as a writer enabled him to embark on a glittering career that would see him showered with literary honours. This culminated in him being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1983. He was knighted in 1988 and died in 1993, aged 81, at his home in Cornwall."
