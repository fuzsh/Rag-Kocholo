I respond to and add to the piece by Ramaswamy R Iyer, “Chomsky and Wittgenstein: A Short Reflection”, which appeared in the EPW (2 November 2013). In that commentary piece, he does a quick comparison of the conceptions of language of two influential thinkers of the last hundred years. However, the discussion misses two important points, which I attempt to add in this article – the disciplinary or scientific implication of Noam Chomsky’s view of language, and placing the discussion in a historical context that has a curious Indian connection.

Ludwig Wittgenstein is indeed a very flamboyant figure in 20th century philosophy. Apart from his slightly unusual career, he is considered unique because of two very distinct positions on language he took at different points in his life. In his early work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), a strikingly different document in modern philosophy because of its terse and axiomatic style of presentation, he argued for what came to be known as the “picture theory” of language. In the later Philosophical Investigations (1953), he put forward the well-known idea that language is similar to a game played according to certain rules. Using the rule-based game idea, he was able to influence philosophers of mathematics and even speak to science studies scholars (Labinger and Collins 2001).
