In its prime, between the wars, the unofficial fraternity was presided over by Moritz Schlick, who began his academic career as a physicist. Inspired by Ernst Mach, Schlick and his associates presumed science to be a “social practice,” devoted to the solution of “usually practical” problems. Philosophy, traditionally crowned “the Queen of Sciences,” was dethroned, as Europe’s pre-war emperors had been in 1918, and relegated to dusting and polishing propositional paraphernalia.
