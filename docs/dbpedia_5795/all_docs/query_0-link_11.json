        "text": "This piece is dedicated to the memories and legacies of the late Charles Mills and Lonel Woods. I miss you both dearly.\n\n“So now that we’re having people demonstrate in the street, and young people are taking the lead — and you know, all credit to Black Lives Matter and people of Dwight’s age — the question we need to ask is, given that political philosophers are supposed to be justice guys, where the hell where they when these issues [arose]? …they’re charged to prepare young Americans to deal with problems of the country, to make it a better United States, where the hell were they when entrusted with that valuable task? …think of what a difference it would make as the country transitions to a non-white majority… think of all the problems and confluences that are going to attend this transition. Think of the role of philosophers in preparing, in particular, young white Americans for this new world they’re going to be living in, and to make it as smooth and just a transition as possible. Don’t philosophers, don’t political philosophers need to be talking about issues of race and racial justice and corrective justice? And they need to admit the historically white supremacist character of the United States as a nation.”\n\n–Charles Mills\n\n“Peace and love.”\n\n–Lonel Woods\n\nThough I had no idea what it was until I was eighteen, I fell in love with philosophy almost immediately upon learning. I was introduced to it during my first year in college through a course on Ludwig Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language and psychology. Aside from the fact that Wittgenstein’s intensity, commitment, and struggles with religion resonated with me, early on the course’s teacher contrasted Wittgenstein’s views on language and thought with another philosopher’s views—those of Noam Chomsky. I was first politicized by the very publicly anti-democratic nature of the United States in the George W. Bush elections, as well as the racism—both anti-Muslim and anti-Black—and imperialism of the Bush administration’s response to September 11th, 2001. Furthermore, this politicization brought to fruition seeds first planted by Rage Against the Machine as an eight-year-old. Put these facts together and I was certainly aware of Chomsky. This discipline that, for me, was initially associated with him and Wittgenstein seemed pretty cool. As somebody just realizing how much I had uncritically accepted the problematic world around me, I connected with a discipline so connected to critique of language—in Wittgenstein’s case—and social critique—in Chomsky’s case.\n\nUnfortunately, while it would take me years to realize it, the only part of that experience telling of my time in academic philosophy was the privileging of white men’s perspectives. Genuine criticism, struggle, commitment, were few and far between—though it took me years to notice this underneath the performance of struggle and play criticism all around me. That same calendar year I also took intro philosophy, philosophy of justice, and philosophy of religion. I was introduced to scores of philosophers, but we still read only white thinkers and Elizabeth Anscombe was the only woman whose views I was introduced to. Again, as somebody who was politicized by the Bush administration, the war on terror, and the associated intertwining of the military-industrial and prison-industrial complexes, I was also well-aware of Angela Davis and would have been thrilled to read her work in a class.\n\nGiven that I was taking a philosophy of justice course, assigning Davis’ work shouldn’t have been a big ask. At the very least, some writings by some BIPOC philosophers, or even writing about race or imperialism shouldn’t have been a big ask. Alas, nothing along these lines was forthcoming and we stuck to purely abstract, ideal-theoretic questions, as well as the answers white men gave to them. Even though the relationship between the Islamic world and the western world dominated global politics during this time, my philosophy of religion class engaged none of this and we exclusively read western authors. Even the kalam cosmological argument was introduced through William Craig, rather than al-Kindi or al-Ghazali. The next year I took six more philosophy classes—including my first course from a woman philosopher, who was a (white) feminist—but the variety of perspectives got no better. Yet again, I should have realized the perniciousness of this, as on p. 2 of the course text I was introduced to the concept of propositional knowledge through the horrific, but supposedly paradigm example, “I know that Columbus discovered America in 1492”. We’re far removed from any serious criticism or questioning if this is our starting point.\n\nStill, I absolutely loved philosophizing—so I assumed that meant I loved philosophy. I also thought that philosophizing had much to bring to matters of public and personal importance. By the time I published my first article, my topic was public philosophy. Unfortunately, my tone was far too harsh on the public—the first sentence reading, “Increasingly, philosophy is being viewed by the public as a non-essential part of non-academic, political life.” It didn’t occur to me that this might be a reasonable response to a discipline which provided the exclusionary undergraduate experiences discussed above. It didn’t occur to me that those experiences formed part of a pattern which was continued in graduate school—where I was only assigned white thinkers (with the notable exceptions of Delia Graff Fara and being lucky enough to learn from Jiyuan Yu), where a faculty member placed homophobic and misogynistic memes on his door, where a faculty member publicly announced I was an “idiot” for boycotting an anti-LGBTQ2S+ philosopher’s talk, etc. I didn’t see that this all fit neatly into a system where teachers told me things like, “stop writing about people—ideas are all that matter in philosophy”. I didn’t see that this privileging of abstractions and ignoring of real people and their lived experiences could lead to mistreating them or could be connected to institutions which created the context for anti-black and homophobic death threats directed at one of my colleagues—even as responding in a way that would support my colleague’s and our community’s healing began to consume me. To my BIPOC readers, friends, colleagues, students, and comrades, I’m so sorry for that. I owed you much better.\n\nBut, by the time I was twenty-eight, my attitude toward philosophy was changing. After teaching some mathematics and spending time criticizing the eurocentric and androcentric canon there, I started to do so in philosophy too. I was also finishing my PhD and thinking about my own place within academic philosophy. So, when I read the first page of Mills’ first masterpiece, The Racial Contract, around this time, my eight-year old, eighteen-year old, and twenty-eight year old time slices were finally able to come together. Here, Mills points out that “White supremacy is the unnamed political system that has made the modern world what it is today. You will not find this term in introductory, or even advanced, texts in political theory”. As a result, Mills saw his work as needing “to redirect your vision, to make you see what, in a sense, has been there all along”. He did this for me and it reinvigorated my love of philosophizing like nothing has before or since. So, I set my own goals along these lines as well.\n\nHaving always been political and somebody who attempted to engage in criticism in my philosophizing, I assumed that when I turned my presenting and writing toward critiquing the whiteness and maleness of philosophy, it wouldn’t be seen all that differently. I was wrong. Instead, colleagues who had been my most common interlocutors refused to engage. One told me that they’d love to attend a talk of mine when I started doing philosophy again. Another who was at least willing to attend my talks, said that all my claims about the ways in which the construction of the modern canon in philosophy was connected to the history of global white supremacy, colonialism, and patriarchy may be true, but they still have the right to teach this way without justification. On subsequent attempts, they gave more directly white supremacist responses like “There’s no such thing as Latin American philosophy” and a defiant “We teach western philosophy in this department.”\n\nSome colleagues apologized for such behavior, but then did things like issue public statements against me when I asked them to look at the whiteness of their own curriculum. Amidst all of this, I lost my position in the philosophy department. As I was appointed to multiple other departments, one of my new chairs encouraged me to leave if I were going to continue criticizing the school’s white supremacy. They also dog-whistled that I might be doing so because I’m too angry from listening to too much hip-hop. Back within academic philosophy—after critiquing white feminist approaches to social justice that I saw within one professional philosophical organization, I was chastised and threatened with not being included in future programs by a representative of the organization in the discussion session.\n\nI don’t include these experiences because I want to call out those involved. I also don’t include these experiences because I think I’ve had a particularly bad time or that I’ve been wronged in some way. Quite the opposite, in fact. I know full well that, as a white man, I’ve had an experience conditioned by institutions designed precisely to include, overserve, and validate me over my BIPOC brothers, sisters, and nonbinary siblings. This makes it significant that the only time I’ve ever run into any sort of issues in academic philosophy is in relation to my budding attempts at anti-racism, equity, and inclusion. Imagine if I were somebody with different social identities who had to experience first-hand the oppression of white supremacist and patriarchal systems. Of course, we don’t need to just imagine. There are a great number of BIPOC philosophers who have written and spoken about their own experiences of near-constant exclusion, under resourcing, tokenizing, oppressing, and marginalizing. I simply wanted to engage in some storytelling and theirs are not my stories to tell.\n\nAs alluded to, I also don’t believe I come out of this story without fault either. As the paragraphs above show, I had ample opportunity to see these patterns and respond sooner and better than I did. So, I see this piece as calling myself in just as much as I call in other white philosophers. We need to respond to Professor Mills’ call to action. And we need to be willing to be held accountable to, and by, our BIPOC community members in judging how successful our actions have been (this post included). In all honesty, though, I wasn’t there as recently as this summer. I wasn’t seeing myself as in relationship with the philosophy community any longer. Thankfully, my colleagues at the Center for Equity & Inclusion have pushed, and worked with, me on seeing that my feeling just anger at, and walking away from, white folx and predominantly white communities perpetuates the individualism which is so central to white supremacy culture. In doing so, I shirk my responsibilities as a white man to work toward racial harmony—toward greater peace and love. So, ironically, it was going outside of philosophy which helped me to grow in my own relationship to philosophy (Lewis Gordon was the first to point out this possibility to me.)\n\nMore specifically, it is the work of Ruth King on mindfulness and anti-racism which forms the basis of this feedback. In Mindful of Race: Transforming Racism from the Inside Out, King identifies this individualism as one of the habits of mind which is a significant hindrance to racial harmony. Another is the tendency for us white folx to systematically ignore racial patterns—seeing only disconnected, individual stars where there are intricately interrelated constellations. Having also given a talk at this year’s Pacific APA on what I learned about philosophizing during a year on the ground in activist circles in what is now known as Portland, Oregon, this seemed an opportunity for me to point out a few of the patterns I’ve noticed when looking at philosophy from outside of the institutions of philosophy generally—whether that be in activist or race equity communities.\n\nOne of the reasons I gave that talk was a further attempt to engage in the self-reflection I’m encouraging in other white philosophers and to show where I was complicit in these systems that I critique even while engaged in that very criticism. In Race, Gender, and the History of Early Analytic Philosophy, I wrote a chapter on Black Lives Matter and the logic of conversation. While it isn’t all bad, one of my mistakes was not making it clear who I thought was to be the judge of who. In academic philosophical circles, analytic philosophers are treated as the default judges and standard bearers. As a result, my chapter could have the impact of making it seem as though my connecting Black Lives Matter with standard work in the analytic tradition should be seen as somehow legitimizing the Black Lives Matter movement. This is clearly wrong-headed. To be perfectly blunt, academic philosophy of language needs the thinking of the Black Lives Matter movement much more than the Black Lives Matter movement needs the thinking of academic philosophy of language.\n\nBecause of this, I spent time talking about some areas that I thought philosophers of language would benefit from learning from activists for racial justice in the Black Lives Matter movement. One that I want to mention here is how my experiences on the ground in these movements made me realize the importance of the physical manifestations of utterances in a way that my training in the philosophy of language never did. A very common tool in this and other protest movements is graffiti. Now, I think graffiti is an underappreciated form of political protest. I’ve often thought that one of the best ways to know what’s going on in a place is to look at the graffiti in the area. Furthermore, much work by anti-racist scholars and activists has shown that the horrifically white supremacist world we live in requires us (especially white folx) to lie to ourselves constantly, to avoid saying certain things, to avoid using certain concepts. Because of this, I see graffiti as an essential tool for reminding us that those things are lies, for saying the unsayable, for getting us to see the possibility in certain concepts.\n\nWhen we’re focused on linguistic acts like graffiti, the physical manifestation of language comes clearly into focus. We see that where an utterance is physically manifested can have an essential role in its significance and force. For instance, some of the most beautiful, powerful, and impactful pieces of graffiti and more traditional murals in this city show up on Alberta St., Killingsworth Ave., and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.. These streets’ connections to the power and resilience of historically BIPOC communities, as well as the history of redlining here cannot be left out in understanding the linguistic and social function of the graffiti found there. Furthermore, the way that location is discussed in philosophy circles today in the theory of indexicals and context-sensitivity—playing a merely reference-determining role—simply does not cut it.\n\nIn the other direction, being on the ground in Portland also made me think about location in relation to covert communication, where we may want to restrict where certain utterances are manifested. Various forms of covert communication are very necessary in a city where marches, rallies, and picketing are regularly met with Proud Boys, a police force which is much more like the Proud Boys than anybody should be comfortable with, and a mob of clueless white liberals ready to do damage with our good intentions, but lack of experience, knowledge, courage, awareness, and empathy. Focusing on covert communication would also seem to cause problems for e.g. the cooperative principle’s centrality to Gricean takes on communication.\n\nIn addition to keeping us from seeing important topics like physical manifestation of utterances and covert communication, the ideologies of whiteness can keep us from seeing important aspects of the topics we do focus on as well. Being trained in analytic philosophy of language, the topic I have arguably spent the most time talking about with professional philosophers is that of names. Yet, I regularly have experiences in my race equity work which show that philosophers of language are fundamentally misunderstanding huge parts of the ways that names function. Most recently, I was at a conversation on incarceration, justice, and family led by Hanif Fazal, co-founder of CEI, and Ethan Thrower. Ethan is a wonderful father, husband, son, alternative school social worker, and author of the forthcoming “A Kids Book About Incarceration”.\n\nI encourage folx to watch the entire conversation, but there is one portion particularly relevant to this current context. Ethan, very powerfully, recites a page of his book from memory: “When I was in prison, my name became a number. People in charge no longer called me ‘Ethan’.” Rather, they called Ethan by his prison number, ‘12392588’. The dominant, neo-Millian picture of names, where the function of a name is merely to tag an object and the meaning of a name is simply its bearer, which it refers to directly, would have nothing to say to Ethan about why that was so unbelievably impactful. If you watch Ethan and Hanif discuss what this shift in names did to his sense of self and the way he interacted with others in the world, if you see how this impacted him emotionally, if you see how this manifests trauma in his body still, you’ll see that this should be concerning for where philosophy of language is at.\n\nThis brings me to my last lesson for philosophers from my time in activist and race equity circles that I’ll share here. Us philosophers need to not be so narrowly focused on our minds—on intellectual, abstract, theoretical, cognitive matters. Many philosophers for many years from many cultures and backgrounds have thought that there is something essentially human about philosophy. Well, we humans are not just minds, but bodies and hearts as well. Of course, a discipline where the mind-body problem has been central for some time may have some understandable skepticism in response here. So, let me clarify.\n\nWhat I mean is that we need to not just philosophize about bodies and emotions. We need to attend to them in the doing of our work. And, to return to the mind-body problem, we need to do so in a way which doesn’t perpetuate a logic of domination that sees logic and emotions as fundamentally at odds with each other. We need to recognize that how we’re feeling about the content and the social dynamics in a discussion impacts our ability and willingness to lean into learning and having our minds changed. We need to recognize that what our bodies have experienced in spaces like these or in relation to the content of our discussion impacts how we show up in the discussion. We need to remember that settled bodies settle bodies, that unsettled bodies unsettle bodies, and that many of our norms of discussion do not lend themselves to settling our bodies.\n\nIn short, we need peace, love, and racial justice in philosophy. So, the next time I’m at a philosophy conference, I’ll push you to do better and ask you to push me to do better. And, I hope we’ll do it after settling in together with an emotional check-in, with some music or some mindfulness practices, and with an established alignment around an open, honest, and vulnerable discussion. I’ll also continue to be out there in the streets, following my BIPOC comrades’ lead, in calling for a more just world. I hope more white philosophers will join us and maybe I’ll have a brighter view of philosophizing and philosophy by the time I’m thirty-eight."
