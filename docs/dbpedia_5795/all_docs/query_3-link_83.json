        "text": "Background\n\nOn the weekend, I saw Avatar the way of water (for the second time).\n\nThat made me think of something .. which I try to articulate here.\n\nChatGPT is taking AI from statistical to a linguistic model and making AI more inclusive\n\nThe issue is interesting from the standpoint of current AI experts and also inclusion in AI.\n\nEspecially for me, being neurodiverse\n\nAs many of you know, most companies, especially FAANGs, use a test similar to leetcode for recruitment. Such tests have a basic problem.\n\nIt's probably not that the leetcode problems are ultra hard to solve (though they can be). It's also the combination of the artificial time constraint and the high pressure interview setting - which is a very different kind of pressure than you typically experience on the job.\n\nSource: https://news.ycombinator.com/item id=26793643\n\nThat selects a certain type of person who is logical / left brained and also rejects almost anyone else. That would include me due to my limitations.\n\nHowever, today, most people would accept that a new form of thinking is needed to engage with chatGPT - the most common example of which is prompt engineering\n\nHere, I propose two ideas:\n\nchatGPT could make AI more inclusive by thinking of intelligence beyond the Turing test (from statistical to linguistic)\n\nThe current AI experts are not ideally suited for this new wave of AI because it probably needs a new way of thinking which is excluded in the current wave of recruitment\n\n(PS: for simplicity, I use chatGPT, GPT-3 and LLMS synonymously in this article)\n\nA different way to look at Artificial Intelligence - from statistical to linguistic\n\nThe current models of intelligence are founded on the Turing test. But there are other models of intelligence - especially from Ludwig Wittgenstein and Noam Chomsky.\n\nLet’s start with this 2012 article from Chomsky - Noam Chomsky on Where Artificial Intelligence Went Wrong\n\nThis is very detailed but one of the key ideas is as follows:\n\nA complex biological system can be understood at three distinct levels. The first level (\"computational level\") describes the input and output to the system, which define the task the system is performing. The second level (\"algorithmic level\") describes the procedure by which an input is converted to an output. Finally, the third level (\"implementation level\") describes how our own biological hardware of cells implements the procedure described by the algorithmic level.\n\nChomsky emphasises the internal structure of the system that enables it to perform a task(based on linguistics), rather than on external association between past behavior of the system and the environment(based on a statistical viewpoint).\n\nWittgenstein also takes a similar view based on his aphorisms\n\n1) “Understanding a sentence means understanding a language.”\n\nLanguage is more than a sum of its parts. The ability to process words and sentences does not mean that language (and hence intelligence) can be understood. Language encapsulates shared experiences. The use of language involves not only understanding the syntax(rules) but in creatively shaping the rules based on our subjective (and shared) experiences.\n\n2) “A picture is a fact”\n\nWe represent facts to ourselves by means of pictures ie subjective experiences.\n\n3) “If a lion could speak, we could not understand him”.\n\nEven if a lion could somehow speak our language(or a Google translator could be developed between ‘Lionese to Human languages’), the lion would still struggle to clearly articulate his point of view to a human being. The lion’s utterances would be meaningless to us, because they would not be based on a shared sense of context. Reference HERE\n\nThe same idea applies to a AI i.e. as as machines become more intelligent, they need to embody the same context as us to be truly intelligent - else just like the lion - the utterances of autonomous AI would be meaningless for us.\n\nThere is a weird and creepy precedent to this in the report that When Facebook designed chatbots to negotiate with one another, the bots made up their own way of communicating.\n\nConclusion\n\nChatGPT (GPT-3 and LLMs) represent a fundamental shift from a statistical to a linguistics based mode of AI. This is a fundamental change\n\nChatGPT could make AI more inclusive by thinking of intelligence beyond the turing test\n\nThe current AI experts are not ideally suited for this new wave of AI because it probably needs a new way of thinking which is excluded in the current wave of recruitment. Hence, you see experts like Yann LeCun miss the whole point of a distinct shift in AI. But this also is a an opportunity for a new set of experts to shape the future of AI.\n\nOf course, we know that chatGPT currently is not intelligent and is in fact merely reframing sentences based on Reinforcement learning from human feedback - but the point here is there is a distinct shift towards improving the linguistics rather than the statistics.\n\nAnd considering current traction, this shift will be reinforcing. It wil be an opportunity for a new group of experts to shape the future of AI\n\nIf you want to work with us, please see our new course at the #univsersityofoxford\n\nLow-code data scientist: low-code AI apps including LLMs and ChatGPT (online)\n\nWhat’s it to do with Avatar 2?\n\nGood qs :)\n\nI had read about the lion reference “If a lion could speak, we could not understand him” and when I saw Avatar, I saw the weird ponytails used to communicate between the creatures of pandora and other species and I thought of this idea i.e. they would need a common syntax to communicate still!\n\nReferences\n\nWittgenstein: Intelligence is Never Artificial"
