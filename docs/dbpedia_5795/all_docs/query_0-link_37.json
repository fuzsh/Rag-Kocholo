        "text": "World’s eyes are on this conflict, war or special military operation; whatever the name you give it, it is dangerous and yet easily resolved as Noam Chomsky says.\n\nIn the below video, Chomsky goes back to the 90s, where an agreement was made between the U.S and Russian for a non-expansion of NATO in Russia’s neighbouring countries. Surely, the agreement was not respected as we can see now.\n\nHowever, does this justify invasion, brutality that is of a high price on a humanitarian level? On a moral level, nothing justifies this. On a political level, Niccolo Machiavelli would say the opposite.\n\nWherever you stand, this short video is worth watching:\n\nAnd if you haven’t read my book review on Chomsky’s On Anarchism, you can catch it here:\n\nOn Anarchism… by Noam Chomsky\n\nConsidered as a pioneer of feminist philosophers, Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986) was one of the most important French existentialist philosophers and writers. Working alongside other famous existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, de Beauvoir wrote excessively on ethics, feminism, fiction, autobiography, and politics.\n\nIn The Ethics of Ambiguity, she developed an existentialist ethics that condemned the “spirit of seriousness” in which people too readily identify with certain abstractions at the expense of individual freedom and responsibility. In The Second Sex, she produced an articulate attack on the fact that throughout history women have been relegated to a passive acceptance of roles assigned to them by society. Freedom, responsibility, and ambiguity are main concepts of existentialist philosophy shown in her works.\n\nHer influences include French philosophy from Descartes to Bergson, the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, the historical materialism of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and the idealism of Immanuel Kant and G. W. F Hegel. Her most famous and influential philosophical work, The Second Sex (1949), remains to this day a central text in the investigation of women’s oppression and liberation.\n\nHannah Arendt (1906-1975) was a German-American philosopher and political theorist. Her many books and articles have had a considerable influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century.\n\nIs reading Arendt today helpful to explain the crisis of all types of authorities in today’s world?\n\n“In her anthology Crises of the Republic, consisting of four essays, “Lying in Politics”, “Civil Disobedience”, “On Violence” and “Thoughts on Politics and Revolution”, she studies the contemporary American politics and the crises it faced in the 1960s and 1970s. “Lying in Politics” (which is one of the main criteria of politics as said by Nicolas Machiavelli) looks for an explanation behind the administration’s deception regarding the Vietnam War, as revealed in the Pentagon Papers. “Civil Disobedience” examines the opposition movements, while the final “Thoughts on Politics and Revolution” is a commentary, in the form of an interview on the third essay, “On Violence”. In the latter, Arendt declares that violence presupposes power which she understands as a property of groups”.\n\nThis anthology sums up the reasons why politics have failed to trust it in general. Adding to lying and violence, social media and mass communication brought systems down. Being States in States, social media sites and platforms are transnational, dismantling frontiers and old values. Demystification and opinions rage, followed by civil disobedience, lead to crises in democracies and Republics.\n\nAuthority has never been more fragile.\n\nOriginally published in 1987, Bruce Duffy reimagined the lives of Bertrand Russell, G.E Moore and Ludwig Wittgenstein as they happened. Wittgenstein, a troubled and a troubling man, is a central figure in this biographical novel.\n\nBetween wars and peace during the 20th century, the lives and the minds of these great men were shaped and constantly changed depending on he general circumstances of the world back then.\n\nThis novel is a deep introduction to the theories of our heroes and a must read for those interested in them.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) was a German philosopher and one of the most influential of all times. He is considered as one of the first existentialists philosophers and his books are still widely read and discussed. Let’s take a look at his most important works, highly recommended to be read:\n\nThus Spoke Zarathustra\n\nVery much inspired by Jesus’s parables like way of speaking, this book is the most representative of Nietzsche’s philosophy and vision. In it, one would find the issue of the death of God and Superhuman appearance.\n\nOn the Genealogy of Morality\n\nNietzsche discusses various concepts of ethics, morality and religion. His idea is to reject the “slave morality” and adopt the Superhuman way of thinking.\n\nEcce homo\n\nIt is the autobiography of Nietzsche, written little before he became ill. He examines his life and his work, an intimate intake on his conceptual and beliefs system.\n\nThe Birth of Tragedy\n\nNietzsche describes life as tragic and music is the correlation of the existential tragedy and aesthetics. This book is a profound essay on art as intertwined with life."
