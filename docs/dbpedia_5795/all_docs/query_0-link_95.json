        "text": "tion of linguistics. The case against Chomsky is based on two principal claims. First, that we can separate the study of linguistic competence from the study of its outputs: only the latter belongs to linguistic inquiry. Second, Chomsky’s account of a speaker’s competence as consisiting in the mental representation of rules of a grammar for his language is mis-taken. I shall argue, fi rst, that Devitt fails to make a case for separating the study of outputs from the study of competence, and second, that Devitt mis-characterises Chomsky’s account of competence, and so his objections miss their target. Chomsky’s own views come close to a denial that speak-er’s have knowledge of their language. But a satisfactory account of what speakers are able to do will need to ascribe them linguistic knowledge that they use to speak and understand. I shall explore a conception of speaker’s knowledge of language that confi rms Chomsky’s mentalist view of linguistics but which is immune to Devitt’s ...\n\nThis paper tries to determine the philosophical nature of language, its functions, structure and content. It also explains the concept of natural language, ordinary and ideal language i.e. how there is a need of artificial perfect logical language without errors and unclearness in that language. This paper further shows the logical form of language with its syntactical, semantical, innate and acquired criteria for the evaluation of the languages. It deals with the analysis of language to clear what is unclear, to know what is unknown, to make definite what is vague. In this paper I used the method; logical method for interpretation and argumentation, analytical method for simplification, and critical method to investigate the real domain of language. This paper does not deal with ordinary functions of the language but it deals with the conceptual and modular functions of the language. The fundamental aim of this written up is to determine the analytical approach of Wittgenstein to sketch the ‘language as a tool to discuss the state of affairs or facts of the worlds that is also what philosophy does. This paper describes the contributions of rationalism and empiricism in the field of knowing the truths of language.\n\nThe paper focuses on the debate as it is dealt with in chapter 4 of Chomsky (1986), where the MIT linguist defends his own view of “knowledge of language”, especially answering some objections by Dummett. In this same chapter Chomsky also discusses some conclusions drawn by Kripke (1982) about the notion of “private language”, following and developing Wittgenstein’s view on the issue: Kripke’s arguments are not directed against Chomsky’s view of language and knowledge of language, but, if they were shown to be tenable, they would undermine the whole theoretical construction of generative grammar, as Chomsky himself (1986: 226) suggests. The paper therefore examines Chomsky’s answers to Kripke and Dummett and tries to give an assessment of the debate. Chomsky’s answers appear as essentially convincing; this does not mean, however, that the issue of what “knowledge of language” is has really found a completely satisfactory answer. This problem is dealt with in the final part of this paper, also referring to some suggestions by a cognitive scientist (Pylyshyn 1980; 1984)."
