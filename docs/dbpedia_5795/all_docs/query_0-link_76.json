        "text": "Ludwig Wittgenstein, a significant 20th-century philosopher, explored language’s role in shaping perceived reality. His works, from “Tractatus” to “Philosophical Investigations,” marked a paradigm shift, viewing language as dynamic and contextually driven, profoundly influencing philosophy, logic, and psychology.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein’s Perspective\n\nWittgenstein, a 20th-century philosopher, made significant contributions to the philosophy of language and mind.\n\nHe focused on the relationship between language and reality, exploring how our language limits and shapes our understanding of the world.\n\nKey Quotes from Wittgenstein\n\n“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” (Original German: “Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt.”)\n\n“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.” (Original German: “Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen.”)\n\nKey Texts\n\n“Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus” (1921): Explores the idea that language mirrors the logical structure of reality.\n\n“Philosophical Investigations” (1953, posthumous): Represents a shift in Wittgenstein’s thinking, emphasizing language’s role in social contexts.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nWittgenstein’s ideas emerged in response to the logical positivism of the early 20th century, influenced by advancements in logic and mathematics.\n\nHis work is a philosophical dialogue with contemporaries like Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege.\n\nFundamental Concepts\n\nPropositional Logic: Proposes that language functions as a logical structure, mirroring reality.\n\nLanguage as a Limit: Suggests that the scope of our language sets the boundaries for our world understanding.\n\nPicture Theory of Language: Early Wittgenstein’s idea that language forms ‘pictures’ of facts in the world.\n\nShift in Viewpoint\n\nFrom viewing language as a mirror of reality’s logical structure to seeing it as a tool shaped by its usage in various social interactions.\n\nIntroduction of Language Games, illustrating how the meaning of words is defined by their function and use.\n\nLanguage Games"
