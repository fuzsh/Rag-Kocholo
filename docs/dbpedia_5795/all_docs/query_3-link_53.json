        "text": "Things I carry always in by bag, part N - Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus by Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is small, slim and lightweight, but intellectually heavy and thought-provoking read. In this Age of Idiocracy it gives me lots of comfort to read and think about its message about language, perception and universe surrounding ourselves. Especially interesting it is to think that his thesis is 100 years old, and one of the groundworks in neo-positivism and logical empiricism, and how his later works then influenced in the emergence of linguistic philosophy or ordinary language philosophy. Linguistic philosophy is the view that many or all philosophical problems can be solved (or dissolved) by paying closer attention to language, either by reforming language or by better understanding our everyday language. The former position is that of ideal language philosophy, one prominent example being logical atomism. I don't try to explain this work, sufficient to say that it deals with theories how language and universe are related to each, what is fact, what is thought, while it leads to picture theory of language, and many other concepts. Wittgenstein himself described its content like: \"Whereof one can speak, thereof one can say it clearly; whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\" I often wonder how perplexed Wittgenstein might be in our current society, especially in social media, where the language has been twisted to constructs that mean totally opposite as previously, or certain concepts have been replaced with others. This also makes me think about Orwellian Newspeak, where language is used as socio-political tool to define reality to support official agenda, and what is convenient. If we think about such concepts like skill, determination, dedication, expertise, experience and education, that we consider positive characteristics in a human being, we can see a tremendous change in language. Those have been replaced or overwritten with other concepts, resonating more with modern attitude of people who think that they are entitled to get everything easily, without any real work, as quickly as possible. Enthusiasm has replaced skill, or it is considered more important. To follow influencers and interact daily with their posts is the new idea of determination. Being excited is the same as being dedicated. Popularity in social media is now a measure of expertise. Because people are not willing to spend years of hard work, they have replaced experience with ChatGPT and AI tools. Eventually we live in a world where education is replaced with 5 minute YouTube tutorials, TikTok videos and LinkedIn cheatsheets. #language #philosophy #logic #artificialintelligence #languagemodels #nlp #GPT4 #cheatsheet #socialmedia #reality"
