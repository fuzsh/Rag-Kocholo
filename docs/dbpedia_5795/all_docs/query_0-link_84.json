        "text": "“Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.”\n\n— Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\n“His ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.”\n\n— George Henrik von Wright\n\nI am a few days late Ludwig and I am sorry. But I wanted to make sure that I would do your philosophy proud and not embarrass myself too much.\n\nApril 29th was the 71st year since the passing of Ludwig Wittgenstein. I am sure there were some written tributes, somewhere, but I certainly did not see them. Mind you I do not move in philosophical circles. Perhaps if you were in such a circle Wittgenstein would have been duly mentioned. For he was the leading analytical philosopher of the twentieth century. His two philosophical masterpieces, the Tractatus Logico-philosophicus (1921) and the posthumous Philosophical Investigations (1953), changed the course of the subject."
