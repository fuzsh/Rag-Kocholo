        "text": "Hello gentle reader,\n\nWhen people ask me what genre my WIP The Last Queen is, I usually reply “Fantasy”. But if I wanted to be precise, I would say “Gritty Epic Fantasy”. Usually I’m not that precise, because then I would have to explain what Gritty Epic Fantasy is and I would end up talking for 15 minutes…\n\nSo today I thought I would explain what Gritty Epic Fantasy is, just this once.\n\nLet’s break it down, shall we?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia,\n\nFantasy is a genre of fiction that commonly uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic is common.\n\nEpic Fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that is set in invented or parallel worlds.\n\nNB: Because they share so many similarities, Epic Fantasy and High Fantasy are often used as synonyms. In this post, I will not differentiate the two subgenres, although I do think there are some differences that distinguish them.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis are seen as the founders of the Epic Fantasy subgenre. Both authors invented imaginary worlds where their characters go on a great adventure. Their books focus on a good-versus-evil story and they were published during the first half of the 20th Century.\n\nThese books are all about escapism and heroism. In The Hobbit, Bilbo is on a quest to find a treasure guarded by a dragon. In The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf comes back from the dead. In The Chronicles of Narnia, children protect the fictional realm from evil and restore the throne to its rightful line. In these first Epic Fantasy books, there are talking animals, mythical beasts, sword fights, magic at every turn and people rarely die.\n\nAs many other readers out there, I love those stories. But Fantasy literature is about being a metaphor for the world we live in. And this is 2012. Since the 1950s, society has changed. Readers have changed. They’ve grown up watching people getting killed live on TV, hearing about horrific cases of child abuse and reading about human trafficking in the paper. When they read Fantasy books, they want to read about characters who face similar challenges to the ones they do.\n\nAnd that’s what Gritty Epic Fantasy, also known as Realistic Fantasy, has to offer.\n\nThe trend was started by Glen Cook’s Black Company series in the mid 1980s. Then George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series followed in the mid 1990s. And in the last ten years, this subgenre has grown exponentially, with authors such as Joe Abercrombie, Scott Lynch, K. J. Parker, Mark Lawrence, Steven Erikson and Brent Weeks.\n\nIn these books, the setting is still imaginary worlds. But instead of relying on complicated magic systems and weird creatures, these stories show us a world in shades of grey, where the characters are as flawed as we are, with the same emotions and reactions. These books touch on concepts which echo in our real world. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire tackles politics and relationships, Week’s Night Angel trilogy mentions child abuse and moral ambiguity.\n\nIn Gritty Epic Fantasy, there is no old grey-bearded wizard in robes to save the day. No quest to find a hidden treasure. No talking lions and children more powerful than kings. No brave knights who defy death. No world in black and white.\n\n“There’s no guarantee that justice will win out or that a noble sacrifice will make any difference. But when it does, there’s something that still swells my chest. There’s magic in that…. It tells me that’s the way things are supposed to be.”\n\nBrent Weeks, Beyond the Shadows\n\nSo maybe Gritty Epic Fantasy is not for you. But I find that this Fantasy subgenre is the one that echoes the most in me and this is what I write.\n\nSome reading recommendations:\n\nBlack Company series (Glen Cook)\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire series (George R.R. Martin)\n\nMalazan Book of the Fallen series (Steven Erikson)\n\nThe Deed of Paksenarrion (Elizabeth Moon)\n\nPrince of Nothing series (R. Scott Bakker)\n\nAcacia (David Anthony Durham)\n\nThe Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (Stephen R. Donaldson)\n\nFirst Law series (Joe Abercrombie)\n\nThe Lies of Locke Lamora (Scott Lynch)\n\nThe Night Angel trilogy (Brent Weeks)\n\nPrince of Thorns (Mark Lawrence)\n\nOn the web:\n\nGritty fantasy\n\nhttp://bestfantasybooks.com/gritty-fantasy.html\n\nPainting With Grey: The Development and Popularity of “Gritty Fantasy”\n\nhttp://fantasy-faction.com/2012/painting-with-grey-the-development-and-popularity-of-gritty-fantasy\n\nWhy the Turn Towards Gritty Realism In Epic Fantasy?\n\nhttp://io9.com/5850891/why-the-turn-towards-gritty-realism-in-epic-fantasy-authors-sound-off\n\nSo what do you think? Do read or write Gritty Epic Fantasy? Why or why not? I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nHello gentle reader,\n\nso I had a tough week. I was jet-lagged and I was having doubts about this whole “let’s get my book published” thing. So I didn’t write. Instead, I read great books and decided to postpone my writing until next week. And I found a post by debut author Elizabeth May. She posted it her blog on November 22d, 2011. Since then she has sold her YA steampunk novel THE FALCONER and it will be released in May 2013.\n\nHere is her post:\n\nWriterly Misconceptions: YES, YES, YOU DO WORK\n\nBasically, I’ve come to understand that aside from the other things I have to do (that dissertation to finish, that photography business to run, that teaching anthropology thing I do), I have to write sometime.\n\nHave to. Because, while it might have been a hobby before, writing is now one of my jobs. I have a trilogy to plan. A sequel I should probably be writing as I type up this blog… I am doing things! Important things! My heroine is a mess and I have to FIX HER.\n\nSo when I take a day and sit on my ass in front of the computer for hours, that’s not me being lazy. That’s me bringing home the bacon.\n\nThe other day I asked Mr. May to do some task that I really can’t recall right now because I’m only on my third cup of coffee.\n\nHis response? ”Wait, weren’t you home all day?”\n\nSubtext? ”You totally could have done this thing because while I was out working, you were sitting at home.”\n\nIt’s a totally innocent comment. He’s right. I was home all day. I made two pots of coffee, clicked around on mah laptop, answered a few business e-mails, worked a bit on my dissertation write up that my supervisor is demanding — and oh yeah! I wrote some of that sequel.\n\nNow, before anyone judges Mr. May (remember that I love him and he is not a writer), he totally didn’t mean this to sound dismissive of my work. He is voicing a very common misconception about writers. That writing a book is easy work* and that because most of us work from home, we are ”lucky” not to have to “go to work.”\n\nBasically, that we are less busy because writing is dependent upon the rules and hours authors set for themselves. If we all had offices away from the home, perhaps this misconception wouldn’t exist. But because we prefer comfortable spaces (homes or coffee shops or cafes, or my favourite place of all, the couch) it’s perceived as, essentially, laziness. Because I could be cleaning instead of typing. I could be doing something active. I could be going out to run errands. Instead, I’m being sedentary.** Some people believe writing is not a “real job” for all of these reasons.\n\nBecause this is my significant other, I had to set this straight. I said, “Assume that whenever I’m staying home for the day, it is my designated ‘work on book’ day. It is not my ‘clean ALL THE THINGS’ day.”\n\nAnd maybe, if I finish a chapter and feel like cleaning, I will clean. But not before!\n\nMr. May, of course, apologized. Because when people make comments like this, they don’t generally realize they’re speaking from this socially engrained idea that “work” equals “being active,” or that a “real job” requires “leaving the nest, staying out from 9-5.”***\n\nSo I’m clarifying this right here, right now. Writing is work. Writing is a job. Writing is not for lazy people. We don’t write because it’s easy. That is not why we sit in front of a laptop or a blank sheet of paper for hours. That is not why we spend years writing practice books that no one will ever read. That is not why we spend all that time querying and getting rejections. And that is certainly not why we write book after book.\n\nBecause we’re lazy? No. It’s because we’re compelled to. It’s in our nature. That is the only explanation for spending years writing unpublishable, crappy manuscripts to get to that point where our work is good enough to put out into the world.\n\nSo if you’ll excuse me, I will continue to sit on my couch and work. Because this is how books are made.”\n\n___________________________________\n\n* Has anyone heard this? “I could write a book if I wanted!”\n\n** I’m being sedentary because I’m writing a damn book.\n\n*** I’ve also heard the phrase used in reference to “non-career-like jobs” — the conceptualization of “real jobs” is limited to a few vocations, and let’s face it, it’s a shitty thing to tell anyone. Right along the lines of “write a ‘real’ book” or “read a ‘real’ book.\n\nHow are you other fellow ROWers doing? You can visit them here.\n\nHello gentle reader,\n\nthis week my writing schedule was completely thrown off, thanks to WriteOnCon.\n\nOn Friday I did a recap of the online writers conference WriteOnCon and today I thought I could go over a few things I learned during this crazy week. YA writer Aimee L. Salter already wrote a great blog post on this topic and I suggest you read it since she really made the most of the conference (she received six full manuscript requests and a direct referral to an editor!). I was less dedicated than her to fully take advantage of the conference (I only spent a few hours a day in front of the computer) but I did learn a few things worth sharing if you ever want to get published traditionally …\n\n1) Write an awesome book first.\n\nHaving a successful author platform and thousands of followers won’t do any good unless you have a great book to sell. Ultimately, agents and editors want an amazing book that will blow them away. The author platform and the followers will only be the “icing on the cake”.\n\n2) It’s a crowded world out there.\n\nI read dozens of awesome queries on the WriteOnCon forums. These writers are going to get published, I have no doubt about it. And instead of being depressed by the prospect of having to “compete” with all those great writers, I found that reading their work on the forums was motivating. Because now I know what agents getting my query will compare it with. I know I have to be as good as all those talented writers out there.\n\n3) A query has to make your book stand out.\n\nBefore WriteOnCon, my query was ok. I had sent it to 5 agents and got 2 partial requests. I hadn’t committed any of the Deadly Sins of Querying. My query was professional and brief. It included the agents’ names, the title of my MS, genre and word count, and a brief summary of the plot/main characters issues. But having an average query is not enough to get published. A query has to be outstanding. I learned that I had to make every word of my query count to make it unique and to really hook my reader.\n\n4) Don’t rush.\n\nYou should never send a query or a manuscript that is not ready and in the best possible shape. But getting your query/MS ready and in the best possible shape takes time. And it’s OK. Take a year to polish your MS. Take two! Revise, revise, revise. If your book is really unique and awesome, it will get published regardless of trends and external influences.\n\n5) Seek help and feedback.\n\nI have said it before on this blog, but WriteOnCon confirmed my thoughts: you can’t do this alone. You cannot get your MS ready and awesome without people giving you feedback on it.\n\n6) Listen to the advice of professionals.\n\nThey are the ones who will read your query and hopefully buy your book and turn you into the next J.K. Rowling. Listen to what they have to say. Read their blogs, watch their vlogs and seek their advice. Be professional. They are.\n\n7) Trust your instinct.\n\nA conference such as WriteOnCon is a great way to get advice. TONS of advice. And by the end of the day, you’ll notice contradictions. Don’t mention world-building in your query. Mention some elements of world building in your query. Don’t say you’re planning on writing a book series. Let people know you’ve devised your book as the first installment in a series. Don’t start your novel with a dream/prologue/MC running. It’s ok to start your novel with a dream/ prologue/MC running as long as it’s essential to the story. A YA novel shouldn’t be longer than 75K. No, 80K. No, 100K. Actually 115K is ok in some cases. The next YA trend is edgy contemporary. No, it’s historical novels… You get the point. If you listen to everyone in the profession, you end up pulling your hair out.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, trust yourself. Make your book as awesome as possible and believe in it.\n\nYOU CAN DO THIS.\n\nTo check out other fellow ROWers, click here.\n\nHello gentle reader,\n\nToday I want to share with you the writing journey of Sarah J. Maas. She is 26 years old and a YA Fantasy author. Her debut novel, THRONE OF GLASS, was released last Tuesday by Bloomsbury. Already her novel has received hundreds of five-star reviews on Goodreads, it has been quoted in the LA Times and the Wall Street Journal published a whole article about it.\n\nSo I haven’t read Sarah’s book yet, and I won’t go into details about it here. The reason I mention Sarah and her book is that she started writing Throne of Glass TEN YEARS AGO. It took her ten years to write and rewrite her book, to find an agent, to sell the book and have it published. TEN. YEARS.\n\nOn Tuesday she published a guest post on The Story Siren’s book blog explaining her ten-year journey. It’s a great read, so I have included it below.\n\nRevision, Revision, Revision.\n\nby Sarah J. Maas\n\n“Getting to August 7th has been a journey over ten years in the making. I began writing THRONE OF GLASS back in March of 2002. I was sixteen years old, had a vague idea of where I wanted the story to go, and absolutely no clue how much this book would wind up shaping and changing my life.\n\nMy FictionPress origins have been discussed a fair amount in various places around the internet, so I’ll just give you the quick and dirty account of those first six years. A month into writing TOG (then titled QUEEN OF GLASS), I decided to throw up the first few chapters on FictionPress. I got such an enthusiastic response that I kept writing—and kept sharing. And in the six years that the story was on the site (the very, very rough drafts of the first three books of the series wound up being shared), it became the most-reviewed story on FictionPress. It was my FP readers that encouraged me to get published. And one day in Fall of 2008 (a few weeks after the final chapter of QOG/TOG had been posted), their support gave me the courage to remove TOG from FP in order to pursue publication.\n\nBy that time, I’d already started a secret, massive overhaul of the series, word for word, scene for scene, adding in new plotlines, expanding the world… In the six years since starting the series, I’d graduated from high school and college, and learned a hell of a lot about writing and books and storytelling. Of course, none of that taught me anything about the realities of publishing. Like…what the average book length should be.\n\nSo, it’s with a bit of horror and shame that I admit I sent out three very preliminary queries…\n\nWith a 240k-word manuscript (for Book 1).\n\nI got the three rejections that I deserved.\n\nIt wasn’t until the amazing Mandy Hubbard (YA author and agent…and an FP fan of mine) offered to read the ms and give feedback that I understood was NEVER going to get an agent with a 240k-word fantasy novel. And it was Mandy who found places for me to cut and trim and condense…until we had a 150k-word manuscript. A few months and some more revisions later, (in December 2008), I sent out a round of queries…and landed my amazing agent from that batch.\n\nWe actually spent several months revising the manuscript—paring it down even more (I think it was around 140-145k words by the time we went on submission). My agent went on maternity leave for several months after that, and we did one FINAL round of revision when she came back.\n\nThen, in summer 2009, we went on submission to editors. I know the internet is full of overnight YA mega-deal stories, but mine was not one of them. It took until December of 2009 for us to hear that an editor at Bloomsbury was VERY interested.\n\nBut.\n\n(BUT!)\n\nThey wanted Book 1 to be more self-contained (it originally had a very open and unresolved ending). And they WERE super-interested…but only if I could present a detailed outline for the mega-revision I’d do if they offered.\n\nSo, after brainstorming with my agent, we came up with a solution: I’d split Book 1 in half. Not chronologically, but rather just PULL one of the major plotlines (there were two) and set it aside to make a brand-new Book 2 (thus pushing back other books in the series). And then I’d completely revamp the remaining plotline to contain a new, resolved ending.\n\nWhat’s somewhat ironic is that in my initial rewrite of TOG (back before I began querying, and before Mandy even came along), I’d removed one of the original elements of Book 1, which was this competition to find the new personal assassin for the King. BUT, when it came time to come up with this outline for Bloomsbury, that competition was the FIRST thing I thought of—so I wound up bringing that plot back into the story.\n\nSo, we submitted that proposed outline. And waited.\n\nAnd waited. And waited. And in March of 2010, we got our offer, based on that outline.\n\nOnce the celebrating had worn off, I realized that I now actually had to rewrite Book 1 from the ground up. It took me several months, but I eventually turned it in. Only to get an edit letter six months later (…yep.) that involved HEAVY amounts of revision. Nearly another rewrite. But I got through it (we’re into 2011 now), and I got through her second, super-intense revision letter, and then her smaller, surface-level third letter, and then…we were done (in late summer 2011). Of course, then there were copyedits and first pass pages and all of that fun stuff afterward, but by comparison, that stuff felt like a walk in the park.\n\nAs I’ve been writing all of this out, I’ve been realizing that this looks sort of bad. THAT many rewrites and revisions? You’re probably thinking that this was the most broken and un-publishable book of all time (…I certainly like to think that is NOT the case.). But honestly? It was hell. It was exhausting, and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.\n\nBut each of those revisions and rewrites brought me closer to my true vision for the book, even if I didn’t realize it at the time. Each edit letter gave me the opportunity to make the story better, to spend MORE time figuring out the world and the characters and the plot. It allowed me to learn SO much as a writer—but also as a person. I learned about my own strength—about just how far I was willing to go to make this book a reality. I learned that I CAN do anything I set my mind to, and that it might take years, but it is worth it.\n\nAnd I wouldn’t change a single moment of it. Not a single one.\n\nSo when I walk into a bookstore today and see that book on a shelf, I’m not just seeing my book, and the story that is in my very soul. I’m also seeing over ten years of work—I’m seeing PROOF that “impossible” is nothing but a word. I’m seeing my dream, at long last, become a reality.”\n\nSo this is Sarah’s story. I hope it can give hope to all of you, fellow ROWers and would-be-published writers out there.\n\nNow on to my ROW80 goals:\n\nI’m still off work, which means that my daily schedule changes from one day to another. I haven’t been writing as regularly as I want to, but\n\n1- Write everyday: 3/7 days.\n\n2- Self-edit The Last Queen: a little bit done this week.\n\n3- Continue writing the first draft of The Cursed King: not done this week.\n\nHere is the Linky for the other check-in posts. How are you other ROW80 writers doing?"
