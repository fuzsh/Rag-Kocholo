        "text": "9/10\n\nA fantastic collection of novellas and novelettes, highly compelling and entertaining. Most of them were written between 2017 and 2023, and four novellas have been published separately before by Tor or Subterranean Press. I am incredibly impressed with Parker’s writing and this collection is among the very best fantasy that I have read over the past few years.\n\nOne thing that is so great about these stories is that Parker chooses the type of people that conventional epic fantasy hardly ever touches, and sets them in tantalisingly real past worlds. He can start a story with two people in a stagecoach, one a thief disguised as a priest, and the other a young woman traveling to the big city to become a painter, and make their dialogue compelling and create a whole grounded world around them, seemingly effortlessly. Neither character is what they seem, of course. The story will be narrated in first person perspective, and through those voices he whips up whole local histories, geographies and magic systems on the fly. So, while Parker has a lot of fun with character journeys and sharp, tight narration, the stories also feel very grounded because he has clear preferences for historical Byzantine environments and is clearly very knowledgeable about these times.\n\nThe combination of all those elements – unique characters, real worlds, entertaining voices and seemingly effortless writing – make Parker’s fantasy among the very best written today. None of the stories left me in total awe, but an extremely high quality was constant throughout the collection.\n\nParker is writing the kind of stories that other genres of fantasy totally seem to miss. His work is enriching for the entirety of the genre. The novella Mightier Than the Sword, for instance, is narrated by an imperial legate who is charged to beat back an influx of barbarians who are dead set on burning every monastery they can find. On the plot and character level, the story is funny as the legate travels from one conniving governor to the next to get them to cooperate, but they are all uppity assholes and banished relatives of each other and of his own family. Meanwhile he is trying to get a romance working in secret with a former prostitute, but the deeper theme of the story is about the importance of writing in keeping a record of history, and the importance of the monasteries in copying books and the danger of the barbarians burning them. That theme suddenly shifts our entire perspective from the here and now of the main character’s doings to thinking about the fact that little pieces of writing are sometimes all that remains of entire empires and millions of people, and that casts the whole story in a new light. I don’t see epic fantasy, classical or grimdark, tell stories like that, nor any other fantasy subgenre.\n\nParker’s short stories have much more magic in them than his novels do. And I mean magic in the sense of scholars practicing magic to perform services such as the banishing of demons and witches, and they often quarrel amongst themselves to shocking effect. Parker’s magic is dangerous. People get hurt, killed or eternally haunted. Prosper’s Demon (2020), a novella published before by Tor, is about exorcism. About a demon-hunter who has the unfortunate gift for seeing demons and yanking them out of those they possess. A cleverly told story about possessions and double-crossings, and, curiously, about the difficulties of casting a bronze statue, with a vile, morally dark protagonist and snarky demons. Parker’s writing is especially hilarious in this one, and the amount of storytelling he gets done in a small number of pages is stunning.\n\nThe story about the minotaur on the cover, Stronger, stands out, because it is set in another story-world, Ancient Greece resembling, and the magic is connected to myth. It is a fascinating parable about what makes people strong or weak, about power relations and becoming the monster. Rulers may seem strong, but those who are being ruled often cheat the rulers. Everybody cheats everybody in the end, and would that be justice or not? In The Big Score, Parker put a little bit of himself. The story is about Saloninus, a Da Vinci type genius who fakes his own death, but then writes another play to be auctioned off as a posthumously discovered masterpiece (again: the type of story that I don’t see other fantasy authors write). Saloninus writes like Parker: letting the characters dictate the direction of the story, and accepting that writing female characters isn’t his strong suit.\n\nI wouldn’t advise to read all of the stories in one go, because they may start to feel similar. Parker is just overly fond of the same kind of first person perspectives and Byzantine environments. However, there are some positive sides to this as well. Nearly all the stories are set in the same alternate Byzantine history, which creates a continuum between all the stories. For another thing, it is noticeable that there are subtle differences in tone between the narrators, which is impressive and an indication of Parker’s control. These are not the same characters, at all. It may take a few stories to notice this, but each story has a subtly different first-person narrator. And it is satisfying to build this familiarity with the range that Parker is playing with.\n\nThe collection can be cut into four or five parts, because it has a rhythm of two short stories preceding a larger novella each time."
