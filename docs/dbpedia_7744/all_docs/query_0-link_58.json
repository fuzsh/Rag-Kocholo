        "text": "Background\n\nLGBTQI fiction\n\nQueer literature scholars have emphasized that fiction is part of the collective history of LGBTQI people, serving as an important medium of knowledge and self-awareness (e.g. Love, 2007; Heede, 2015; Wallace, 2016). However, end users consider it challenging to find LGBTQI fiction in online information systems such as library catalogues, online bookshops and social media (Author, Year). Even research overviews of LGBTQI fiction are few, and in many cases limited to specific genres, such as young adult literature (Cart and Jenkins, 2006; Abate and Kidd, 2011) or primarily gay fiction (e.g. Koponen, 1993; White, 1999), lesbian fiction (Faderman, 1981; Griffin, 1993) or both (Stevens, 2011; Herring, 2015). It is only in recent years that scholars have started to outline transgender and intersex literary canons (e.g. Amato, 2016; Chess, 2016; Koch, 2017), although particular themes had been addressed earlier, for example, in the 1990s (e.g. Garber, 1992; Lehnert, 1994, 1997).\n\nFrom these research overviews we learn that the LGBTQI community has been unevenly represented in fiction, with gay male experiences clearly overrepresented (Cart and Jenkins, 2006; Hicks and Kerrigan, 2020). Transgender characters appear less often and in less central roles than do LGB characters, and their portrayals tend to be less positive (Waite, 2013; Cart and Jenkins, 2018). We have also learned that LGBTQI themes have been more hidden than explicit in fictional literature, at least until the 1990s, when these themes started to become more visible (Cart and Jenkins, 2006). This last matter has also had an adverse impact on subject indexing and, consequently, on finding LGBTQI fiction.\n\nIndexing LGBTQI fiction\n\nWhile the information profession community has advocated enhancing fiction indexing to capture appeal characteristics such as pacing, characterization, storyline, frame/setting, tone and language/style (Saricks and Wyatt, 2019), the subject indexing practices of fiction in libraries are usually limited to genre, complemented with facets for time and place (Saarti, 1999). Another challenge arises when it comes to “meaning” and “aboutness,” with the former signifying subjective interpretation and the latter an “intrinsic element of a document's intellectual content” (Campbell, 2013, p. 295), which is especially difficult to index when themes are intentionally hidden or when, for example, “homosexuality often appears through implication” (Campbell, 2013, p. 295), as was particularly common in fiction before the 1990s.\n\nFurther problems specific to LGBTQI themes pertain to bias and changing terminology. There is a long history of critique of the failure of controlled vocabularies to “respectfully organize library materials about social groups and identities that lack social and political power,” as Drabinski (2013, p. 95) noted, and librarians and scholars have sought to correct and expand subject headings and to correct biases. Edge (2019) identified another problem of providing adequate terms for LGBTQI actions and identities, which is related to changing LGBTQI terminology and the ambiguous use of certain terms such as “gay.” Edge (2019) also mentioned the challenge posed by the term “queer,” signifying fluid identities and resistance to definition, supporting Keilty's (2009) proposition that a queer indexing practice must allow for changeability and rely on an understanding rooted in the community.\n\nAnother problem is that general controlled vocabularies are often limited to only rather broad LGBTQI terms. This is the case with the general subject heading system in Sweden, that is Swedish Subject Headings (SAO), in which, for example, only the general term “transgendered people” exists, while more specific ones such as “trans men,” “trans women,” and “transitioning” are absent. At the same time, existing controlled vocabularies for LGBTQI information resources are mostly applied to indexing nonfiction (see, e.g., 15 examples of controlled vocabularies for LGBTQ + materials compiled by Johnson and Colbert, 2007/2017).\n\nAlternative or complementary approaches to the professional subject indexing of fiction have in recent decades mostly been found in social tagging services, while automatic options remain largely unsuccessful in texts characterized by subjectivity, metaphoricity and hidden and subtle motifs. Despite the recognized disadvantages of social tagging such as lack of indexing rules, different users using different tags to refer to the same concept, homonymous tags not being disambiguated, hierarchical and other relationships between tags often lacking, tags written in different forms (e.g. singular/plural and spelling variations) and tags unlimited in quantity or only having relevance for personal use (e.g. “to read”) (see, e.g., Furner, 2010), social tagging is at the same time characterized by the natural everyday language of the end user. Thus, in her review of tagging literature, Rafferty (2018) concluded that while tagging may underperform established subject indexing systems, it can still “complement, enrich, and … enhance conventional retrieval systems” (p. 510), a finding also reached by Rolla (2009), Kipp and Campbell (2010), Golub et al. (2014) and Adler (2009) for transgender books and Bates and Rowley (2011) for LGBTQI works.\n\nQUEERLIT project\n\nIn an attempt to address the challenges that LGBTQI literary fiction is in general very sparingly thematically described and that the SAO (Swedish subject headings) LGBTQI terms are broad and lacking in acuity, the Swedish Queerlit Project, 2021–2023, creates a Swedish LGBTQI fiction sub-database of the Swedish union catalogue, Libris (https://libris.kb.se). The Queerlit database is intended to help scholars and the general public discover relevant fiction. In addition to the common Libris web search interface, the Queerlit sub-database is to be searchable through an advanced separate interface supporting subject searching based on a dedicated LGBTQI thesaurus. This thesaurus, the Queer Literature Indexing Thesaurus (QLIT), also developed as part of the project, is largely based on the English-language Homosaurus Vocabulary (https://homosaurus.org/v3). Homosaurus was developed to cover a range of varied information resources, and its first version dates back to 1997 (for more about Homosaurus, see Watson, 2021; Cifor and Rawson, 2022).\n\nQLIT incorporates relevant Homosaurus terms, translated to Swedish, adapted to reflect the Scandinavian context and adapted to fiction. The thesaurus and the search functionalities are further informed by the needs of potential users, including subject experts and the general public (Author, Year) as well as librarians. The remainder of the paper describes the user study of librarians and its implications for Queerlit information system development.\n\nResults\n\nDemographics\n\nIn total 82 respondents completed the survey. Most of them (69 or 84.1%) were 40–59 years old (y.o.). Of these, 25 (30.5%) were 40–49 y.o., 23 (28%) 30–39 y.o. and 21 (25.6%) 50–59 y.o. Some were also younger, 18–29 y.o. (9 or 11%) and some older, 60–69 y.o. (4 or 4.9%).\n\nAll but one had completed a university education (81 or 98.8%). Of those with a university degree, most had a four-year master's degree (Swedish “magister”) (32 or 39.5%) or a bachelor's degree (31 or 38.3%). Some had a five-year master's degree (16 or 19.8%), one a two-year degree (1.2%) and one a doctoral degree (1.2%). Most had their highest educational degree in library and information studies (65 or 79.3%); others' highest degree was in comparative literature (4), religious studies (2), cultural studies (1), journalism (1), ethnology (1), music (1), social work (1), theatre (1), as well as science and technology in society (1).\n\nLibrary work\n\nMost respondents (55 or 67.1%) worked at a large library, either a public library with 20 or more employees (31 or 37.8%) or at a university library (24 or 29.3%). Others were employed by a smaller public library with up to 10 employees (15 or 18.3%) or a medium-sized public library with 11–20 employees (8 or 9.8%). Of the remaining 4 respondents, 2 worked at a special library (2.4%), 1 at a school library (1.2%) and 1 at the Swedish national library (1.2%).\n\nTheir typical work tasks involved interaction with end users (e.g. information desk, user training, book presentations and events) (69 or 84.1%) or orders and acquisitions (40 or 48.8%). About a quarter worked in cataloguing and metadata (19 or 23.2%), while only 4 specifically conducted subject indexing (4.9%). The small number working in the last area was likely because most libraries rely on pre-existing metadata from the Swedish Union Catalogue; for example, all adult Swedish fiction is catalogued by the Swedish National Library, and all Swedish children's and young adult literature by the Swedish Institute for Children's Books. A minority also worked in library management and development (6), in book delivery to users unable to come to the library, including bookmobiles (4), in physical collection management (3), as systems librarians, including library website development (3) and in research support, scientific communication and open access (1).\n\nWhen librarians look for LGBTQI fiction\n\nMost study participants at least sometimes searched for LGBTQI fiction (59 or 72%). Many did it a few times per year (33 or 40.2%), although a good portion of them searched for LGBTQI fiction as often as a few times per month (18 or 22%), weekly (7 or 8.5%) or even daily (1 or 1.2%). Some did not look for LGBTQI fiction at all (23 or 28%); this group left the survey at this point, as the remaining questions specifically concerned LGBTQI fiction searching.\n\nMost librarians searched for LGBTQI fiction on behalf of end users (44 or 74.6%) or to acquire materials for the library (36 or 61%), for example, to build an LGBTQI collection. Searching on behalf of end users entails:\n\ngiving advice (8), such as reading suggestions (to individual borrowers, school teachers or daycare educators), finding information resources for students (e.g. those enrolled in gender studies' programs) and providing relevant information to colleagues, friends and family;\n\npreparing for relevant events (5), such as reading clubs and book presentations; and\n\npreparing library exhibitions and book displays (5), such as Pride exhibitions and regular book displays to reflect diversity.\n\nOther reasons for searching for LGBTQI fiction the participants provided include:\n\nown personal interest (7), such as pleasure reading and personal development;\n\nkeeping oneself updated for work (5), that is staying abreast of developments and increasing one's own knowledge of these topics; and\n\nadding subject keywords (1).\n\nWhen users ask for help with LGBTQI fiction\n\nLibrarians in the study reported that people looking for LGBTQI fiction came from all age groups – children, youth, adults and elderly. Most of those looking for such fiction often or sometimes were adults, in 37 out of 59 libraries (62.71%), and youth, in 34 out of 56 libraries (60.71%); they were followed by children, in 13 out of 60 libraries (21.67%), and elderly, in 8 out of 57 libraries (14.04%).\n\nSimilar to the results reported in the earlier study (Author, Year), the librarians indicated that users tend to prefer printed books (according to 58 or 98.3% of the studied librarians), followed by e-books (31 or 52.5%) and streaming audio books (19 or 32.2%). Also used were talking books (for users with special needs) (12 or 20.3%) and CD audio books (7 or 11.9%).\n\nWhat information needs do users have when approaching librarians for help in finding LGBTQI fiction? Many respondents only rarely got such questions, some suggesting that this was because it is too revealing for the users, who may prefer to look by themselves.\n\nWhen librarians were approached with questions about LGBTQI fiction, these were often about themes specific to the LGBTQI community (13), such as particular sexual orientations and gender identities (e.g. non-binary or trans characters), girls who like girls, families who live differently from the heterosexual nuclear family norm, LGBTQI love and lesbian relationships with happy endings. Other questions were about already known items (6), that is specific titles or LGBTQI-themed book series sequels. Some users asked specifically for certain genres (3), such as LGBTQI manga, comic books or picture books.\n\nA fair number of questions came from pre-schools (12) or schools in general (6) about themes of diversity and LGBTQI. Pre-schools might ask for books that “reflect diversity and different ways of being human,” present different family types, discuss gender issues, critique norms or feature norm-creative innovation. This was likely linked to national curricula. For example, the pre-school curriculum promotes the equal value of all people, stating that no child should be subjected to “discrimination on the grounds of gender, transgender identity, or expression” (Skolverket, 2019). Questions also came from students (9) enrolled in teacher training programs, healthcare or nursing sciences and who were asking for norm-critical books or LGBTQI books for children and young adults.\n\nWhere librarians find information about LGBTQI fiction\n\nA previous study of the potential end users of the Queerlit database (Author, Year) revealed that most respondents did not identify relevant LGBTQI literature through libraries, but instead relied on social media and got suggestions from friends; they did, however, use libraries to obtain copies of the identified books. This study shows that librarians also look for information about LGBTQI fiction, mostly via social media (38 or 64.4%) or by asking colleagues (33 or 55.9%), but over half also consulted library catalogues (31 or 52.5%). Many also turned to friends and acquaintances (23 or 39%), specialized periodicals and publishers' catalogues (20 or 33%), general periodicals (16 or 27%) and bookshops (14 or 23.7%).\n\nSpecifically regarding the internet, most librarians used social media (38 or 64.4%), Libris (25 or 42.4%), bookshops (22 or 37.3%) or other library catalogues (20 or 33.9%). The most popular social media destinations were Instagram (23), including authors' or publishers' channels and specialized LGBTQI channels, such as “Fem Flator” (Swedish blog on lesbian culture) (2). Also popular was Goodreads (19), considered particularly useful as a source of information on youth literature (5); this was followed by Facebook (7), with several mentions of different groups aimed at literature for children and young adults as well as specialized LGBTQI groups. Also used were Tiktok (6), Tumblr (2), StoryGraph (1), Youtube (1), Booktube (1) and Twitter (1).\n\nIn addition to their own library catalogue, the participants consulted those of other libraries, including Libris, Kvinnsam (National Resource Library for Gender Studies), the Swedish Agency for Accessible Media and large public libraries (e.g. in Stockholm, Malmö and Umeå). Regarding specialized periodicals and publishers' catalogues, most used Svensk Bokhandels kataloger (triennial catalogue of Swedish-published books) (12), individual publishers' catalogues (11) and BTJ's list (7) (BTJ is a commercial library book seller publishing a catalogue of reviews for newly published books every other week).\n\nThe librarians also turned to general periodicals, often for book reviews. Most common were Dagens Nyheter, a daily newspaper with national coverage (6), and Göteborgs-Posten, the largest newspaper in western Sweden (5). Also mentioned were Aftonbladet, one of the largest daily newspapers in the Nordic countries (1), Svenska Dagbladet, a daily newspaper with national coverage (1), and English periodicals – The Guardian (1) and Diva (a magazine for LGBTQI women and non-binary people). The bookshop most often consulted was Adlibris (12), likely because it won the public procurement as the book supplier for most Swedish libraries. Other bookshops used were Bokus (5), SF Bookshop (3), Amazon (1) and Barnes and Noble (1).\n\nOther information channels listed were mostly online, including Google (9), LGBTQI book blogs (9), such as the Swedish “Tekoppens tankar,” library websites (4) with recommended reading lists, such as Umeå library's “Brytiga böcker,” specialized LGBTQI websites (3), such as LGBTQ Reads and YA Pride, and LGBTQI podcasts (2), such as Bookriot and Bögbibblan.\n\nAlso used was QX, an LGBTQI newspaper (3), television (3), such as the TV show on literature “Babel” (1), Swedish public radio (2), the literary magazine Vi läser (1), Historiskan, a magazine on women's history (1) and Bokinfo (a database of Swedish books and publishers) (1). Some also mentioned library users themselves as a source of information (3), as well as lectures, special events and book clubs (3). A few also mentioned finding LGBTQI fiction via different mailing lists (1) or by chance (1).\n\nSatisfaction with searching for LGBTQI fiction\n\nRegarding satisfaction with searching for LGBTQI fiction, most librarians were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (29 or 49.2%); some were satisfied (13 or 22%) and some dissatisfied (11 or 18.6%), with a few very satisfied (5 or 8.5%) and very dissatisfied (1 or 1.7%).\n\nThose who were satisfied reported easy searching using social media such as Goodreads (4), for example, via “Others have liked” or hashtags, or reported that it was easy to conduct known-item searching (3). One person reported being satisfied with their own library catalogue because it has dedicated significant resources to indexing LGBTQI materials. Another librarian felt confident about their search skills, after having gone through the Swedish LGBTQ certification process for institutions, comprising education on LGBTQ issues for all employees.\n\nWhile known-item searches worked, searching by subject was problematic. Most (26) blamed that on poor subject indexing or unsatisfactory catalogue search functionalities:\n\nit was hard to find good search terms (“hard to know if search terms are good”; “it is hard to find subject keywords to search for, books I know are LGBTQI often do not have those keywords”);\n\nsubject index terms were inconsistent (“an endless number of search possibilities; if one used the same terminology, it would have been easier”; “search words change over time and from one country to another”; “different subject keywords are used, so one needs to do a lot of searches in order to find as many books as possible”; “we have worked on subject indexing in our catalogue … but … newer materials have more subject headings than older materials and … not all books with … similar content always have the same subject headings”);\n\ninability to search specifically by theme or identity – often one could only find all LGBTQ books;\n\nslow update of subject indexing systems;\n\ngenerally poor search functionalities;\n\neven though the librarian might be familiar with the catalogue well enough to help the user, the catalogue would not work for the user; and\n\nsubject headings were sometimes flawed in library catalogues (a participant cited the example of The Confession by Jessie Burton: in the Swedish edition, the book description is translated to refer to one of the two main characters, Elise and Constance, as “he,” although they are both “she”; because of this error, the library has misplaced the book outside the rainbow shelf, and the book has not received an LGBTQI subject heading).\n\nOthers were dissatisfied because they had to consult multiple resources beyond the library catalogue (6), such as blogs, Goodreads and colleagues, or they stated that it was hard to search in general (3) (“many uncertain years of looking for information on the subject”) or that there simply seemed to be a lack of relevant literature. The challenges were perhaps best summarized in the following statement of a study participant: “It is not always easy to find relevant literature: this depends partly on the supply on the market, partly on availability at our library, and partly on poor information in the catalogue – in many cases I see my own expertise as the most useful.”\n\nMetadata and subjects\n\nThe metadata elements most often used were subject (by 42 or 71.2% librarians), a combination of two or more elements (27 or 45.8%), author (23 or 39%) and title (20 or 33.9%).\n\nTerms commonly used to search by subject when looking for LGBTQI fiction were:\n\nRelated to LGBTQI identities and/or practices: LGBTQ (in Swedish: HBTQ) (19), including related word forms such as LGBT* (HBT*), LGBTQ+ (HBTQ+), LGBTQI (HBTQI), LGBTQIA+ (HBTQIA+), as well as phrases such as “LGBQ people” and “LGBTQ + youth”; trans (9), including word forms such as trans people, trans person, as well as closely related terms such as “trans experience,” transsexualism and “life as a trans”; queer (8), including phases such as “queer YA”; homosexuality (8), including related adjectives, phrases and word forms (e.g. homosex*, homosexual, homosexual men, homosexual love and homosexual parents); lesbian (7), including “lesbian women” and lesbianism; nonbinary (5), including “nonbinary persons”; intergender (3); intersex (2), including intersexuality; bisexuality (2), including truncated search word forms such as bisex*; gay (2); asexuality (1); genderfluid (1); love between boys (1); love between girls (1); MLM (men loving men) (1); Pride (1); rainbow family (1); Sapphic fantasy (1); sexuality (1); two girls who become a couple; WLW (women loving women) (1).\n\nRelated to LGBTQI: love (3), “family types” (2); norms (2); normcreative (2), normcritical, gender (5), including phrases such as “gender identity,” “gender roles,” “gender aspects,” and “gender perspectives”; different (2), including the phrase “being different”; adventure (1); family (1); friendship (1); rainbow (1) and “own voices” (1).\n\nRecent search\n\nThe participants were asked to recall their latest subject search for LGBTQI fiction. This was shown to be related to different information needs. Some were looking for books for the library (9), for example, for the physical or digital rainbow shelf, a book talk or an internal training workshop on gender and equality.\n\nOn behalf of end users, most information needs were for pleasure (9), including the example of a fantasy novel in which boys like boys; or for work or studies (5), including a student thesis and an academic publication. Other information needs were related to recognizing oneself in the stories (1) or a search for identity (1). Some asked for resources on behalf of children and grandchildren (2), including a grandparent whose grandchildren had two mums and was looking for appropriate children's books. Others mentioned the following types of information resources being sought:\n\nfiction on homosexuality in repressive countries (1);\n\npicture books for a parent whose child's daycare group consisted of children whose families were white, heterosexual, middle-class families; the parent wanted their child to see other parts of reality (1);\n\nyouth books with trans characters (1);\n\na graphic novel with an LGBTQI theme for a 12-year-old (1);\n\nbooks about love between boys or between girls, sought by two children in their early teenage years (1);\n\na work of fiction with a love story about boys, sought by youth (1);\n\n“something similar” to the Heartstopper graphic novel by Alice Oseman (1);\n\na work of fiction about lesbian relationships with a happy ending (1);\n\nworks of fiction that would help address a user's general curiosity about the theme (1); and\n\nany work of LGBTQI fiction, sought by pupils during a class visit (1).\n\nTeachers have also approached librarians:\n\nuniversity teachers (3), in gender studies or teacher education;\n\nschool teachers (3), looking for books with non-binary characters and perspectives; and\n\ndaycare workers (3), looking for children's picture books that show different types of families or that more broadly represent gender.\n\nSearch terms used in their latest subject search were mostly related to LGBTQI identities and/or practices: LGBTQ (in Swedish: HBTQ) (13), LGBTQI (HBTQI) (4), Queer (4), homosexuality (4), LGBTQ+ (HBTQ+) (3), homo* (3), lesbian (3), gay (2), lesb* (2), as well as one of each of the following: bi*, bisex*, bisexuality, LGBTQ* (HBTQ*), LGBTQI+ (HBTQI+), LGBTQIA+ (HBTQIA+), homosex*, homosexual, intersex, intersexual, LGBTQ, MLM (men loving men), non-binary, pansexuality, pride, rainbow, trans*, transgender, trans people, transsexual; bi* and love*.\n\nOther related terms included: rainbow families (5), gender (3), being different (2), sexuality (2), asex* (1), coming of age (1), gender perspectives (1), gender roles (1), identity (1), Mums (1), norm-criticism (1), same gender (1) and *sexuality (1). Another commonly mentioned term was love (7), including love* (1). Also listed were: relationships (1), romance (1), sex (1), YA (young adults) (1) and youth (1).\n\nHow satisfied were they with the search results? Similar to their general search experience reported above, most were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (17 or 28.8%) or satisfied (16 or 27.1%). Some were somewhat dissatisfied (7 or 11.9%) or very satisfied (5 or 8.5%). One was completely dissatisfied (1.7%). Some could not remember their experience (13 or 22%), likely because they rarely search for LGBTQI fiction on behalf of end users, as seen from earlier replies.\n\nDesirable keywords\n\nWhat subject terms would the librarians like to be able to search for when looking for LGBTQI fiction?\n\nAgain, the desirable search terms can be classified into several different groups. The first one is about LGBTQI identities and/or practices, including both the general term and more specific ones: trans (21), including transfeminine, transmasculine or trans*, “trans person,” “trans people,” and transsexuals; bi (4) and related word forms, such as bisexual or bigender; homosexuality (4); lesbian (5), with the synonym “flata” (2); rainbow family (4); queer (4); LGBTQ (HBTQ) (3); LGBTQI (HBTQI) (2); bisexuality (2); cis and related forms, such as cisperson (2); gay (2); homosexual (2); intersexual (2) and one of each of the following: boy, children, gay, “gender dysphoria,” genderfluid, genderqueer, girl, guy, “homo 2 homo*,” “homosexual men” (when only about men), intersex, non-binary, pan, “queer YA,” “same-gender families,” and woman.\n\nDesired related terms were: asexual (3), gender (3), love (3), asexuality (2), normcreativity (2), including truncated forms such as normcreativ* (1), “gender norms” (2), “star family” (2) (the Swedish word stjärnfamilj is wordplay on the Swedish word for nuclear family and means an extended family with, for example stepparents and stepsiblings), transsexuality (2) and one of each of the following: autosexuality, “biological gender,” cisnorm, dysphoria, empowerment, equality, “family types,” freedom, “gender-conscious books,” “gender expression,” “gender identity,” “gender pronouns,” “gender roles,” heterosexuality, “identity formation for younger children,” inclusion, intersexuality, “legal gender,” “lesbian love,” “LGBTQI family,” “LGBTQI history,” liberation, norm-breaking, norm-critical, norms, polyamorous, polygamy, pride, queer literature, “rainbow representation,” “right of determination,” self-determination, “sexual relationships,” sexuality, society, transition and transphobia.\n\nThe librarians would also like to be able to combine these terms with other facets, such as those denoting genre or other themes (e.g. LGBTQI perspective in higher education, LGBTQI for adults, LGBTQI for children, LGBTQI for young adults, LGBTQI easy to read, LGBTQI with genre such as thriller or crime and LGBTQI without explicit description of sexual relationships).\n\nSearch interface\n\nIn addition to a good subject indexing system and an indexing policy with greater exhaustiveness and specificity than is common when subject indexing fiction (see “Background”), it is important to have a search interface that allows the users to take the full advantage of the intellectual effort invested into creating subject metadata. The majority agreed that good subject metadata accompanied by search functionalities that use the metadata at the interface (e.g. to broaden or narrow the search, or to learn about concepts etc.) would be highly useful for finding LGBTQI fiction (34 or 57.6%) and some thought it would be crucial (9 or 15.3%). Others believed it would help to a certain degree (15 or 25.4%), with one stating that it would not help enough (1 or 1.7%).\n\nWhen searching for LGBTQI fiction, the librarians would in particular appreciate it if, upon entering a search term, the system would provide a list of related, broader terms in order to get more results (higher recall) (51 or 86.4%) as well as the opposite, a list of narrower, more specific terms in order to get fewer but more specific results (higher precision) (46 or 78%). Many would also appreciate hierarchical subject browsing (36 or 61%) as well as the disambiguation of homonyms or polysems (28 or 47.5%).\n\nSome further justified their choices by explaining that these mechanisms were needed to help in choosing the correct, preferred subject keywords in order to get the best results (i.e. only relevant and all relevant ones). Another participant commented that it was good to retrieve as many resources as possible, but that the results needed to be digestible so that one would not be overwhelmed, which is why additional, narrower searches would be beneficial. One librarian wrote that often the searches yielded too few hits or that it was difficult to find the right term to search for, so getting search term suggestions would be helpful.\n\nParticipants also commented that help with the choice of search terms was important for those unfamiliar with the terminology of the subject matter: the gender context is very broad and help in understanding it (e.g. via a browsing tree) would benefit both the librarian and end user. Broader and narrower terms would also help those less familiar with the subject and those whose knowledge is limited to general concepts. There are many possible narrower terms for certain search terms, and if one is not very knowledgeable, one might not be aware of them all or of the best choice. Finally, one participant commented that “library catalogues should be at the forefront of including progressive subjects, not just the traditional and heteronormative ones” and that a browsing overview should help with that.\n\nOther desirable features that the librarians would like to see are: ability to truncate both the beginning and end of search terms, option to limit/filter search results (e.g. by age group, media type, language and year of publication), a list of frequently occurring search terms and a list of newly added subject terms. One librarian identified the problem of some works being indexed as, for example, “bisexuality,” even when the concept is only peripheral to the work, showing that indicating the centrality of index terms would help increase precision.\n\nRegarding final, general comments, the librarians were appreciative of the Queerlit project to help make LGBTQI fiction more visible to librarians and users. One librarian pointed to the need for training in metadata creation (e.g. at BTJ), and another complained about the problems with indexing inconsistencies at the word-form level across systems: for example, a book about gay men may sometimes have the subject term “homosexuality,” while another book also about homosexual men may have the term “homosexual men.” Some titles have the subject terms in English, some in Swedish and some in both languages, the latter mainly because of copy cataloguing and importing records from OCLC (a global library organization that provides metadata and other services) without added Swedish subject headings.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThis survey focusing on librarians in Swedish libraries was intended to collect data to inform the development of a dedicated subject search interface for Swedish LGBTQI fiction. Of the 82 participants who completed the online questionnaire, most at least sometimes searched for LGBTQI fiction, some as often as a few times per month. Most did this on behalf of end users, often to provide reading suggestions in various contexts (e.g. pleasure reading as well as professional purposes for daycare/school teachers) or for library acquisitions. All age groups asked for search help on this topic, although most requests were from adults and youth, requests from children and elderly being less common.\n\nSome respondents stated that they rarely got LGBTQI fiction questions specifying information needs. They interpreted this as user reluctance to disclose personal interest. Librarians who did get such questions usually described them as about themes specific to LGBTQI, such as specific gender identities, girls who like girls, families who live differently from the hetero nuclear family norm and LGBTQI love. Many questions came from pre-schools and schools where education on diversity and LGBTQI themes is part of the national curriculum, or from students enrolled in teacher training, healthcare or nursing science programs.\n\nThe participating librarians looked for information about LGBTQI fiction mostly by searching social media, asking colleagues or consulting library catalogues. Most were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with online searching. Further analysis showed that while known-item searches worked, searching by subject was problematic; most blamed that on poor subject indexing or unsatisfactory catalogue search functionalities.\n\nWhen searching for LGBTQI fiction, the librarians would particularly appreciate it if upon entering a search term, the system would provide a list of related, broader terms in order to find a larger number of relevant results as well as the opposite, a list of narrower, more specific terms to get fewer but more specific relevant results. Many would also appreciate hierarchical subject browsing as well as the disambiguation of homonyms or polysems. The results also indicate a need to provide multiple synonyms and word forms as well as automatic spelling correction. Some respondents also emphasized the need to support end users: even if the librarians themselves are able to use the information system even when complex or lacking sufficient search functionalities, end users need much improved systems with the abovementioned functionalities. This is especially important for LGBTQI users, who often prefer not to approach anyone for help.\n\nThe Queerlit project was able to implement many, but not all, of these functionalities due to the limitations of the Libris software and the characteristics of the QLIT thesaurus. As to the latter, the QLIT thesaurus was adapted from Homosaurus, which is characterized by a long list of top terms and only a few hierarchical levels for some terms. This prevents visualizing the thesaurus in a browsing tree, which would be possible with some classification systems, such as Dewey Decimal Classification.\n\nAlso, as terminology is rapidly developing, LGBTQI information services should be quick to include new terms in their subject indexing systems. User search logs should be regularly monitored for new terms to be included, or simple and quick ways for users to leave terminology feedback should be implemented. Collaborative tagging could also be used as a way to learn about new end-user terms.\n\nFurther work is needed to explore search interfaces that make full use of the subject metadata assigned to LGBTQI works, to maximize their findability and use. Also, more research is needed into the user experience (UX) of the specific interfaces. Finally, an important question is how to connect resources in different databases, both within Sweden and worldwide. How can we encourage the uptake of the QLIT thesaurus in other, connected information services, such as BTJ, from which many libraries acquire metadata, or Libris, for cooperative cataloguing in Sweden? How do we move towards the international and multilingual interoperability of index terms for LGBTQI resources? Since Homosaurus is available as linked data, it should be easy to discover other libraries that use the same concept and allow end users to get more results from other libraries around the world."
