        "text": "Putnam\n\nFor more than two decades, G.P. Putnam’s Sons has led the publishing industry with more hardcover New York Times bestsellers than any other imprint. With its rich history of publishing established franchises and new talent, as well as award winners, with an unrivaled bestselling track record, Putnam continues to be one of the most respected and prestigious imprints in the industry.\n\nPutnam’s illustrious roster of bestselling fiction authors includes Megan Abbott, Ore Agbaje-Williams, Cristina Alger, Chloe Benjamin, C.J. Box, Eleanor Brown, Tom Clancy, Robin Cook, Robert Crais, Clive Cussler, Jeffery Deaver, Frederick Forsyth, Karen Joy Fowler, Sue Grafton, W.E.B. Griffin, Robert Jones, Jr., Jan Karon, Alma Katsu, John Kenney, Philip Kerr, Frances Liardet, Mike Lupica, Annabel Monaghan, Delia Owens, Robert B. Parker, Nick Petrie, Kiley Reid, Steven Rowley, John Sandford, Jill Santopolo, Lisa Scottoline, Paige Toon, M.O. Walsh, Stuart Woods, Sarah Winman, and David Yoon.\n\nAmong its distinguished nonfiction authors are Michele Borba, Kate Winkler Dawson, Dr. Marisa G. Franco, Cathy Guisewite, Spencer Johnson, Hoda Kotb, Laurence Leamer, Bobby Orr, Dolly Parton, Vienna Pharaon, and Eve Rodsky.\n\nHistory of Putnam\n\nIn 1838 George Palmer Putnam, who began his career at a small New York bookstore, moved to London to establish the first American publishing branch of Wiley and Putnam in England. Ten years later, Putnam returned to the United States and the company became known as “George P. Putnam.” In 1849, Putnam published the revised works of his close friend, American author and historian Washington Irving. One year later, the house published Susan Warner’s The Wide, Wide World, which became known as America’s first bestseller, selling forty thousand copies in the first few months, and eventually more than one million over its life. Over the next century and a half, Putnam published works by President Theodore Roosevelt (who worked for a year at the house before turning to politics), William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, Norman Mailer’s Deer Park, Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita, and Mario Puzo’s The Godfather.\n\nIn 2013 G.P. Putnam’s Sons celebrated its 175th year of publishing, culminating in an official “G.P. Putnam’s Sons Day” declared by the New York City mayor’s office on May 28, 2013. The history of Putnam is nearly as long as that of our country – and also as varied. The world is very different than it was in 1838, and the imprint is too, though many core values live on – an attendance to quality, honoring our authors, service to our readers, and of course a yen to create bestsellers. Putnam continues to hold industry dominance with an average of 30 to 35 New York Times bestsellers per year, applying aggressive marketing and sales acumen as it publishes established brands and new discoveries.\n\nTara Singh Carlson joined Putnam in 2014 from Viking, Penguin. Her focus is on women’s fiction that hits that sweet spot between commercial and literary, including historical fiction and contemporary women’s stories that are either wildly entertaining or filled with heart. She loves strong female characters that inspire.\n\nShe has edited New York Times bestsellers The Silent Wife by A.S.A. Harrison, The Light We Lost by Jill Santopolo, and Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens, as well as the Today Show Read With Jenna pick The Family. She was the first editor to have two books selected by the Reese Witherspoon Book Club. She has worked with celebrated and bestselling authors Nigar Alam, KJ Dell’Antonia, Lizzy Dent, Eve Chase, Kim Fay, Bryn Greenwood, L.S. Hilton, Uzma Jalaluddin, Hisashi Kashiwai, Lauren Kate, Maggie Knox, Naomi Krupitsky, Frances Liardet, Annabel Monaghan, Beth Morrey, Nuala O’Connor, Robin Oliveira, Delia Owens, Amita Parikh, Theresa Rebeck, Richard Roper, Jill Santopolo, Shanthi Sekaran, Natasha Solomons, Marissa Stapley, Paige Toon, and Sara Weinman, among others.\n\nDaphne Ming Durham joined Putnam in 2023 from MCD / Farrar, Straus & Giroux and publishes twisty, genre-blurring fiction with sharp edges, diverse perspectives, and spiky protagonists. She loves voice-driven, surprising novels that readers devour in one sitting, but come away having learned something—vivid, gripping stories that upend familiar tropes and push boundaries in crime, mystery/thriller, suspense, horror, speculative fiction, and dark fantasy.\n\nDaphne edits Megan Abbott, C. J. Box, Robert Crais, Rob Hart, Mason Coile, Susan Barker, Ron Currie, Ivy Pochoda, and Rachel Eve Moulton, and has published the New York Times bestseller Two Nights in Lisbon by Chris Pavone, winner of the LA Times Book Prize Sing Her Down by Ivy Pochoda, cult-favorite This Thing Between Us by Gus Moreno and the critically adored graphic memoir Feeding Ghosts by Tessa Hulls. She has worked with acclaimed and celebrated authors Andy Davidson, Araminta Hall, Asale Angel-Ajani, Johnny Compton, Sara Sligar, Jennifer Thorne, Kristi Coulter, and Louisa Luna. Prior to Putnam, Daphne was the founding Executive Editor of MCD / FSG. She also spent nearly sixteen years at Amazon.com in all manner of book-related roles, from Editorial Director of the bookstore to Editor-in-Chief and then Publisher for Amazon Publishing, where she launched core genre imprints and managed acquisitions across all categories."
