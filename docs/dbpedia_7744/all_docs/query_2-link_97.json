        "text": "Category Archives: movies\n\nFive things to steal: romance and revenge\n\nThe Five Things to Steal observation journal pages serve many purposes in their own right. I refer back to them when I want to discuss a book; they can serve the basis of an appreciative review; they collect interests to pursue and treatments and ideas to run off and make my own, and tease out plans for how to do that.\n\nIt’s also often interesting to review a group of these notes, and see what larger patterns and interests emerge, either between the texts themselves or in what was fascinating me. This usually reveals even more topics to interrogate, and topics to experiment with creatively.\n\nThese four pages, from January of 2021, already pick up an entertaining contrast, covering as they do:\n\nBridgerton (season 1)\n\nMiss Astbury and Milordo by Irene Northan (1981)\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nWhy Women Kill (season 1)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nBooks read, things seen — October, November, December 2021\n\nI know, I know.\n\nOctober books\n\nThe Monkey’s Mask — Dorothy Porter. I’m still not sure how I feel about this classic verse novel of murder and sex and the Sydney arts scene, except that (a) poets writing about horrible poets amuses me a great deal, (b) it gave me a lot to think about re how little a book can get away with saying, and (c) I ended up drafting an outline of a project partly in verse as a result. It might not have been a better outline, but it was certainly a faster one.\n\nDeath on the Agenda — Patricia Moyes (1962). Shared some interesting tropes with other mysteries I’ve read about this time, especially re beautiful tragic women. I loved the setting of a murder around an international police conference, and also scenes where people unexpectedly end up at too-fancy parties.\n\nMurder Against the Grain — Emma Lathen (1967). In my experience, Cold War novels written in the ’60s tend to be either far closer to WW2 or far more human and lighthearted than one might expect. This is the latter. Trained otters! Forged grain lading bills! Spies and embassy staff and bank managers and limousine drivers capering around New York.\n\nAfter the Funeral — Agatha Christie (1953). A very small-feeling book, but the feeling behind the crime lingered.\n\nGreen Grow the Dollars — Emma Lathen (1982). I described this to someone as Michael Crichton with tomatoes, and for a mystery set mostly at a horticultural conference and turning on industrial espionage, I loved that. Also, a fabulous background character who is changed by their fame exactly as much as suits their purposes, and who thoroughly enjoys the fact.\n\nGoing for the Gold — Emma Lathen (1981). Banking systems vs the Winter Olympic Village. I just love novels about logistics and systems?\n\nSummer Spirit — Elizabeth Holleville. Dreamy, and a reminder (especially read in the same month as The Monkey’s Mask) that graphic novels can feel closer to verse novels than either are to novels or verse.\n\nSaint Death’s Daughter — CSE Cooney (out April 2022 and available for preorder). What I wrote about it: “A luminous, chiming, bone-belled, ludicrous, austere, flamboyant, rhyming, reckless, affectionate novel, that — for all its mortality and cruelty — is less about decay than it is about love in its most expansive, gilded, world-shaping forms. A giddy libation to a sly and shifting pantheon, a glittering ossuary-mosaic of incautious hope and over-generous loves, of gambling and falling and flying.”\n\nNovember Books\n\nLick — Kylie Scott. Caveat: these are very steamy rockstar romance novels (my first foray into reading that subgenre). I’m caught between actually preferring no sex in novels and enjoying the situations and vibrant characters (and Kylie) enormously. Also a gratifyingly uncomfortable stranger-at-the-party sequence. Something I love about Kylie’s novels is the range of vivid personalities, and how many of her protagonists come out swinging, and generally give as good as they get.\n\nPlay — Kylie Scott\n\nLead — Kylie Scott\n\nCorpse at the Carnival — George Bellairs (1958). Perhaps a little heavy on the poetry, but it does make the Isle of Man sound wonderful, and definitely creates a pocket-sized physical world, an enclosed landscape with its own personalities and zones.\n\nThe Art of Broken Things — Joanne Anderton (out in 2022). This is what I wrote about it: “\n\nThe Art of Broken Things embodies a cycle, deteriorating but never entirely decaying, of hope and death. It is peopled by delicate, opportunistic constructs of equal parts life and tragedy shot through, held together and torn apart by grief and gold. Anderton wires together little lives out of the appeal and the dangers of life-grubbied enchantment, fabricated from the humanity of letting go too soon and also holding on too tightly (which might sometimes be just tightly enough).”\n\nDeep — Kylie Scott\n\nA Girl Like Her — Talia Hibbert. Again, Talia Hibbert’s novels are FAR steamier than is my preference. But she writes a range of characters who are variously atypical (or perceived to be atypical), and something about that presentation of a character as they are, operating within the world, and integrating that into the story and what good relationships and friends mean, and people figuring that out, feels more… human, perhaps, than some books that subscribe too lightly to perceived defaults?\n\nUntouchable — Talia Hibbert\n\nThat Kind of Guy — Talia Hibbert\n\nDamaged Goods — Talia Hibbert\n\n[secret — bird book]\n\nDecember Book\n\nWriter Chaps Season 1: Headstrong Girl: how to live a writer’s life — Kim Wilkins. Advice drawn from a wealth of experience in writing and teaching. Kim has been someone I admired from afar, the person who scolded me into finally going back to study, my advisor, and now my friend, and so this was like being reminded very firmly of all the good advice she has given me.\n\nWriter Chaps Season 1: Capturing Ghosts on the Page: writing horror & dark fiction — Kaaron Warren. Kaaron is a very nice person and an absolutely terrifying writer, as well as someone who can present an entire lecture on where she gets her ideas and have it be very thrilling. This chapbook contains very resonant and generous advice.\n\n[secret — map book[\n\nFrom Baby Brain to Writer Brain: writing through a world of parenting distraction — Tansy Rayner Roberts. Exactly what it says there, and also really fascinating to lean over Tansy’s shoulder while she worked on books I know (and for the later editions of which I did covers!). Something I particularly appreciated was the appendix with her diary of getting back up to speed in order to meet some deadlines — the particularity of that process (when so many books give blanket, general advice) was fascinating.\n\nOctober Other\n\nNil. One day I should consider adding things I watch at home to these lists, but if I haven’t managed that in the last two years…\n\nNovember Other\n\nNo Time to Die. This contains a lot of homages but there was a bit that gave me an incredibly vivid flashback to lying on a bed in college, chin propped up on one hand, watching a friend sitting at their computer playing GoldenEye.\n\nLast Night in Soho. I’m still thinking about the use of mirrors, the timeslip elements, the good faces, the sense of the smallness of a good creepy UK story. I’d watched Ghost Stories shortly before this, and they belonged to the same tradition.\n\nRed Notice\n\nDecember Other\n\nGhost tour of Wolston House (things I overheard/learned: it’s bad design when manufacturers put non-slip patches on the planchette)\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nThe French Dispatch. I’m a sucker for staginess, unreality, mannered presentation, the signage, the commitment to an aesthetic.\n\nBooks read, things seen — September 2021\n\nSomething I love about murder mysteries is the specific, thoughtfully-considered glimpses they give of how and why people live and think and do things — beyond the incidental. And reading old mysteries adds such a wonderful glimpse into kitchens and living rooms, cocktail parties and political conversations of the past.\n\nRead\n\nHow to Survive a Scandal — Samara Parish\n\nCrocodile on the Sandbank — Barbara Mertz\n\nBe Shot for Sixpence — Michael Gilbert (1964): This is the second Michael Gilbert I’ve read (the first was The Family Tomb in April). It was a completely different novel — Cold War espionage — and a delight. Fascinating, compelling, with an at first unlikeable character who began to make sense, and just… competent fish-out-of-water set-ups and cold-burned affectless confrontation with horror, and authorial inserts, and bureaucracies, and…\n\nDark Breakers — CSE Cooney: I read an advance review copy and this is what I wrote:\n\nDark Breakers is a magnificent parure of novellas and matched stories, a suite of jewelled and velvet tales, delicately linked and ferociously glittering. It forms a magnificent companion piece to Desdemona and the Deep, and also the jewels set around it.\n\nA baroquely intense confection with a core of typewriters and coal fortunes, Dark Breakers is compounded of voluptuous invention and ferocious structural loves — for new romances and old friends, for the works of hands, for mortality and its gifts, and all the possibilities of worlds bleeding, weeping, wandering into each other’s arms.\n\nA Stitch in Time — Emma Lathen (1968): The first Emma Lathen I’ve read — deaths and insurance and medical misdeeds, and a banker investigating through the mazes of the US health system in the 1960s. Fascinating as a study of systems and a time, and of course also as a mystery.\n\nSlowly the Poison — June Drummond (1976): Murder… or is it? Lawyers entrusted with stories-through-time, twinned Gothic-murder-family setups in London and South Africa. I didn’t love it, but it was fascinating.\n\n(And a couple issues of Slightly Foxed including #67): This I do love.\n\nSeen\n\nFree Guy\n\nShang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: now my second-favourite San Francisco car chase.\n\nThe Common People Dance Eisteddfod\n\nBooks read, things seen — August 2021\n\nWriting, editing, panicking, which means reading (and thoroughly enjoying) mostly mysteries and romance.\n\nThe Siamese Twin Mystery — Ellery Queen (1933): Using a wildfire as a means of both isolating the location of the mystery and adding time pressure to it — as well as calling the relevance of endeavouring to solve it into question — was very stressful. The first Ellery Queen I’ve read, but not the first book this year in which someone is said to have “taken a run-out powder”.\n\nUzumaki — Junji Ito: Eek! Fabulous, of course, and with its (initially episodic but increasingly spiralling) plot also a really diagnostic tool for working out where my particular tastes in horror fall.\n\nDeath of an Angel — Richard & Frances Lockridge (1955): Publishers solving mysteries in the world of theatre.\n\nThe Book of the Crime — Elizabeth Daly (1951): A very small but pleasing mystery, with just enough of a Gothic vibe.\n\nThe Proof of the Pudding — Phoebe Atwood Taylor (1945): The first Asey Mayo Cape Cod mystery I’ve read, and a pleasant change from the default New York setting I was getting used to.\n\nFair Deception — Jan Jones: A reread, before reading the others for the first time. Very comforting melodramatic (in a good way!) Regencies.\n\nBattle Royal — Lucy Parker: I felt like I had a sugar burn by the end of this rom-com. Splendid fun, but after the hints at the end of this one I am looking forward to the next book even more. Here’s the SBTB review: Battle Royal (Palace Insiders)\n\nThe Kydd Inheritance — Jan Jones.\n\nA Fortunate Wager — Jan Jones\n\nEleven Pipers Piping — Pamela Hart\n\nLong Meg and the Wicked Baron — Pamela Hart: The descriptions of the haymaking in this romance novella, especially the colours, were painterly — just delightful. Kind of a like a Regency romance book-of-hours Sarah Plain & Tall-meets-Venetia.\n\nMovies and exhibitions\n\nEuropean masterpieces from the Met (here are the sketches from the visit)\n\nFree Guy: I’m still not sure how I’d rate it, in retrospect and objectively, but I had a very entertaining time watching it at the cinema, which was all I asked.\n\nBooks read, things seen: July 2021\n\nBooks (excluding some embargoed manuscripts, as ever!)\n\nI am writing a lot at the moment, so my reading is skewing heavily to classic murder mysteries (and a dash of romance), because that is not what I’m writing. This time.\n\nA Marvellous Light — Freya Marske: An advance review copy (thanks Freya!). A definitely very steamy romance in this gorgeous Morris-patterned Edwardian fantasy — and/or a definitely very beautiful fantasy of arts & crafts design in this steamy romance? Anyway, that is either a warning or a promise, depending on your taste (my personal taste is to stop at the bedroom door!). However, what I loved about it (apart from the Morris wallpaper) was that although Marske was working with some familiar relationship constellations and concerns, she balanced the personalities (abilities, damage, affections) in a way that was much less usual (and made me personally like the people involved more) — in particular, there is a certain bluff kindness and exasperated capability that I had not expected. But ALSO I plan to sit down and talk with Freya about contracts and magic next time we meet up and really, that’s what I want in a fantasy. If you like CL Polk, KJ Charles, Emily Tesh or CS Pacat (or, you know, the Arts & Crafts movement) and/or magical bureaucracies, definitely look forward to this one. More about it on Tor.com (including AO3 tags) here, and it is available for pre-order now.\n\nThe Accidental Apprentice — Amanda Foody: Middle-grade. Splendid fun, with fabulous creatures and a wild, wheeling approach to a world of Wilderlore and Elsewheres (which promise to unfold further) — also an apprenticeship education system, which is neat to compare to e.g. school-based magic systems (no less risky, of course).\n\nLoveless — Alice Oseman: The first university-romcom-styled book I’ve read that deals with what that story-shape looks like for a romcom-obsessed person who is resistant to actual romance. As a result, the book does have to put in some heavy lifting around its concepts (which in a few years I think won’t be necessary), which risks it feeling didactic (at least if you’re Extremely Online). But it also has lots of terrible-wonderful theatre kids in their first year at university, and some delightful characters and very hilarious and familiar college friendships. A fun book, and one that feels like it will be a benchmark to look back on and see how genres and conversations develop.\n\nDeath in Ecstasy — Ngaio Marsh. Obscure British cults! With murder.\n\nVintage Murder — Ngaio Marsh. Travelling theatre company in New Zealand! With murder.\n\nArtists in Crime — Ngaio Marsh. Artists in the country! With murder.\n\nThe Rebel Heiress — Joan Aiken Hodge. Less direct murder.\n\nDeath of a Fool — Ngaio Marsh. Morris dancing and mummery, and its possible links to King Lear! With murder. (I’ve enjoyed all of these, but this one is the sort of mystery that doesn’t so much glance at folk horror as hold its gaze across the dividing fence, which is what I particularly like.)\n\nThe Case of the Counterfeit Eye — Erle Stanley Gardner. Only the second Perry Mason I’ve read in memory, but such a concise yet characterful voice.\n\nMovies\n\nWerewolves Within\n\nFast & Furious 9\n\nGunpowder Milkshake\n\nBlack Widow\n\nIn two of these, I was weeping with laughter, and it was not the ones I expected going in.\n\nBooks read, things seen: May 2021\n\nBooks\n\nEmporium of the Imagination — Tabitha Bird. Magical shops and enchanted telephones in Boonah, Queensland. (We were on a panel together at the Brisbane Writers Festival — notes on that here)\n\nClaudia and Mean Janine — Raina Telgemeier / Ann M Martin. The Baby-Sitters Club is solid and Raina Telgemeier’s graphic novel adaptation is lovely. I might have cried.\n\n[Title TBC], Corella Press. Three 19th century ghost stories — more information in due course!\n\nThe Bee and the Orange Tree — Melissa Ashley. Salonnières and murder. (We were on a panel together at the Brisbane Writers Festival — notes on that here)\n\nThe Three Burials of Lotty Kneen — Krissy Kneen. Family secrets and the Alexandrine women. (Krissy moderated our panel at the Brisbane Writers Festival — notes on that here)\n\nAll the Murmuring Bones — Angela Slatter. Of course I loved it but I was reading it while thinking about a drawing for the cover of the limited edition hardback, and forgot to tell the author so she only saw my frowning spatial-reasoning face. The paperback is out now from Titan and the limited edition hardback will be from Tartarus.\n\nKiki’s Delivery Service — Eiko Kadono\n\nBatman: A Death in the Family — Starlin, Aparo, DeCarlo\n\nThe Rock from the Sky — Jon Klassen. One of my sisters described Klassen’s ‘hat’ trilogy as “Cohen Brothers for kids”, so if you image a Cohen Brothers science-fiction picture book…\n\nCraft in the Real World — Matthew Salesses. A really interesting and useful re-approach to workshopping writing. Dense with thoughts and techniques. I also really appreciated the structure which, instead of fitting ideas to the shape of standardised non-fiction chapters, moves from commentary to dot-point lists, to collated thoughts, as most relevant and efficient for the material.\n\nThe Sandman: Preludes & Nocturnes — Neil Gaiman, art by Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Malcolm Jones III and Robbie Busch. A reread. That vigorous, untidy, grungy, horrific, insinuating, baroque, beautiful art still gets me by the throat.\n\nProvocation — Meg Vann. The first of Meg’s chapbook thrillers from Brain Jar Press. Murderous happenings in the State Library…\n\nMovies\n\nWrath of Man\n\nThose Who Wish Me Dead\n\nBooks read, things seen: April 2021\n\nBooks\n\nMr Invincible — Pascal Jousselin — (comic) both wildly unlike Memento, and yet very like it in that I couldn’t read stories properly for a while afterwards, and started to resent the fourth wall.\n\nThe Family Tomb — Michael Gilbert — murder and intrigue in Florence in the 1960s, and for some reason I do enjoy stories of British expats being flamboyantly awful.\n\nThe Swimmers — Marion Womack — I’m used to books doing direct rewrites of their inspiration, and it was refreshing to read a book that took an influence (Wide Sargasso Sea) and simply ran with the elements and flavours that intrigued the writer, rather than attempting any sort of correlation.\n\nThe Black Moth — Georgette Heyer — I have a friend who talks about “historical smugness” in historical TV shows, e.g. “the issue of the week and how we would have handled it better now”. Heyer’s early Georgian novels sort of do the opposite — pick up the social mores which didn’t stand the test of time and then lean into them. Usually leads to vigorous bookclub fights.\n\nA School for Unusual Girls — Kathleen Baldwin — Apparently I’m about to start on a Regency fantasy-romance kick again.\n\nDeath of a Ghost — Margery Allingham — I also like murder mysteries in which the writer has clearly been personally victimised by dramatic bohemian types\n\nFun Home — Alison Bechdel — A classic for a reason, and yet somehow I hadn’t read the whole book before (also the stage musical is magnificent, unexpected, and somehow implausibly inevitable).\n\nElmer — Gerry Alanguilian — (comic) Still a bit stunned, but my goodness, the clouds\n\nNewt’s Emerald — Garth Nix — Luminous green magic!\n\nMovies and theatre (I’m in Queensland, it was safe and legal)\n\nKing Kong vs Godzilla — in Gold Class, because where else\n\nCome From Away (at QPAC) — I cried through most of it and it took ages for my mask to dry afterwards.\n\nExhibitions\n\n“Creatures” — Shaun Tan (Beinart Gallery) — the lines, the paint, the eyes… Shaun is a magnificent artist, illustrator, and writer, and getting to just stand close and look at the texture is a treasure\n\n“She-Oaks and Sunlight: Australian Impressionism” — (NGV) — A wonderful exhibition, and a chance to see many favourites (Tom Roberts, in particular, influenced what I was trying to do with descriptions in Flyaway). Seeing them all in one place was illuminating. In some rooms, there were pictures that seemed backlit, shining off the walls, so I was puzzling over that. I worked out, too, that while I generally prefer paintings of green landscapes, that does not hold true for Impressionism, where my heart gets pulled out of my chest by dust and light, yellows and ochres and luminous flickering violets. And of course I reinforced my love for the smallest, sketchiest of paintings, where one or two dabs of paint are a bolting horse, or a girl holding her hat down, or the tiniest dog in a patch of sunlight — see, for example, Allegro con brio.\n\nBooks read, things seen: January, February, March 2021\n\nThree months of books and comics read (and a few movies)! So apparently I have been accomplishing something.\n\nJANUARY\n\nBooks and comics:\n\nFirst Class Murder — Robin Stevens (book 3 of Murder Most Unladylike)\n\nMiss Astbury & Milordo — Irene Northam (a Women’s Weekly Library paperback found in a storage bench in a hospital in Ipswich)\n\nSomething Light — Margery Sharp (1959 — a pet photographer who spends too much time looking after the men in her life decides to find a man to look after her, and works her way through a list…)\n\nThe Case of the Missing Marquess — Nancy Springer (Enola Holmes #1)\n\nThe Case of the Left-Handed Lady — Nancy Springer (Enola Holmes #2)\n\nStart Finishing — Charlie Gilkey (mostly I read self-help and time-management books for cathartic aggravation, but although not the most slickly written, this one has turned about to be extremely useful — especially for managing multiple projects)\n\nMarry in Scandal — Anne Gracie\n\nIndistractable — Nir Eyal\n\nMarry in Secret — Anne Gracie\n\nThe Absolute Book — Elizabeth Knox\n\nMovies:\n\nWonder Woman 84\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nBooks and comics:\n\nThe Practice — Seth Godin\n\nFaro’s Daughter — Georgette Heyer\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel — Baroness Orczy\n\nJane, the Fox, and Me — Fanny Britt, Isabelle Arsenault (Isabelle Arsenault‘s art in this book is just enchanting)\n\nMovies\n\nPixie\n\nMARCH\n\nBooks and comics:\n\nAster and the Accidental Magic — Thom Pico and Karensac\n\nThe Waxworks Murder — John Dickson Carr (1932, Henri Bencolin #4(?) — I enjoyed this tremendously, perhaps because it’s a murder mystery that manages to be more Gothic in aesthetic than the murders it’s about)\n\nThe House Without the Door — Elizabeth Daly (1950, Henry Gamadge #4)\n\nSkip — Molly Mendoza\n\nMoon Girl & Devil Dinosaur #6: Save our School — Brandon Montclar, Natacha Bustos, Tamra Bonvillain (Bustos and Bonvillain’s art in this is so energetic — the body language vivid and hilarious)\n\nGrave Sight #2 — Charlaine Harris, Bill Harms, Denis Medri\n\nRead and seen — December 2020\n\nA strong commonality among the December books was a twinned sense of costuming on the one hand, and becoming more who you are on the other. How that turned into a moth girl I’m not entirely sure, but that was where the associations started.\n\nBooks\n\nBorrowed Dreams — May McGoldrick (romance, villainy, benevolent interference)\n\nA Skinful of Shadows — Frances Hardinge (ghosts! the English civil war!)\n\nPowder and Patch — Georgette Heyer (Georgian makeover montage — I always thought this was a silly book, and it is, but I liked it so much more on the reread)\n\nReading Like a Writer — Francine Prose (appreciating sentences)\n\nEvery Tool’s a Hammer — Adam Savage (this was about more than just fitting your studio space to the way you work instead of the other way around, but that was the main revelation for me)\n\nDrawing is Magic — John Hendrix (it is — also, ways to keep a sketchbook)\n\nThe Cat Who Ate Danish Modern — Lilian Jackson Braun (interior design snark! cats! more on a short scene from the book in this post)\n\nWild Robert — Diana Wynne Jones (ghosts! tourists!)\n\nHamlet, Revenge! — Michael Innes (grand homes! murder! more on a paragraph from the book in this post)\n\nThe Duke Who Didn’t — Courtney Milan (romance, secrets, sauce, deliberate playing with some tropes)\n\nDesign for Dying — Renee Albert (fashion! murder! Hollywood!)\n\nHex — Thomas Olde Heuvelt (horrible things in the woods/town)\n\nOther\n\nThe Happiest Season\n\nDarren Hanlon’s Regional Xmas Tour — The Majestic Theatre, Pomona\n\nRead and Seen — August to November 2020\n\nI fell behind on my book posts, because I kept meaning to draw art to go with them. But here they are (excluding many partial books, some shorter illustrated ones I forgot to write down, and several manuscripts for illustration). Thoughts are abbreviated, but see also my post on Meanjin: What I’m Reading.\n\nAlso here is a wolf in a well.\n\nAugust\n\nBooks:\n\nThe Girl in the Mirror — Rose Carlyle\n\nMaking Up — Lucy Parker\n\nThe Austen Playbook — Lucy Parker\n\nThe Quiet Gentleman — Georgette Heyer\n\nHeadliners — Lucy Parker\n\nA Surfeit of Lampreys — Ngaio Marsh\n\nThoughts: There were several books in this group with… variably likeable characters from privileged backgrounds, which makes for both odd characters and tricky class intersections. The Carlyle/Heyer/Marsh sequence was a bit of a trip. The Lucy Parker London Celebrity romances continue to be stacks of fun, however. My favourite is The Austen Playbook, for some apparently very small decisions, like having the heroine get cast as Lydia Bennet instead of one of the more obvious roles, and because it makes the author feel like someone you’d like to hang out with.\n\nSeptember\n\nBooks:\n\nWinking at the Brim — Gladys Mitchell\n\nAll the Ways to Ruin a Rogue — Sophie Jordan\n\nA Good Debutante’s Guide to Ruin — Sophie Jordan\n\nGreenglass House — Kate Milford\n\nMovies:\n\nBill & Ted Face the Music\n\nPorco Rosso\n\nThoughts: I love how Kate Milford writes colour and light, and I keep laughing at something ridiculous Gladys Mitchell in Winking at the Brim. Also, along with The Happiest Season, it has a very minor finely observed sequence about maintaining personal space, which I liked.\n\nBill & Ted Face the Music was the most delightful way to return to the cinemas post-lockdown (I’m in Queensland), and so very much about what making art isn’t and is. Porco Rosso does such wonderful things with time and learning.\n\nOctober\n\nBooks:\n\nWhite Cat — Holly Black\n\nRed Glove — Holly Black\n\nBlack Heart — Holly Black\n\nArsenic for Tea — Robin Stevens\n\nTools of Titans — Tim Ferris\n\nThe Organised Writer — Antony Johnston\n\nThe 4-Hour Work Week — Tim Ferris\n\nThoughts: Holly Black always mixes grim reality and enchantment enviably. Huzzah for Robin Stevens’ Wells & Wong detective society (I’m currently reading First Class Murder to my dad) — I’d love to read more traditional English subgenres from a slightly (or even extremely) outside perspective. One of the enormous frustrations of Michael Innes’ Hamlet, Revenge! is a glancing acknowledgement of how a country house murder must look to someone not-from-England and then ripping that story away from the reader.\n\nI mentioned a bit over on the Meanjin blog about why I was tormenting myself with self-help and business-development books. Also I like to dip into them occasionally because it overlaps with some things I’d been teaching this year. The ones I usually find most useful, personally, were written for other purposes, but I did get a few good points/reminders/reassurances from The Organised Writer in particular (and there’s always something useful) and I rather liked the approach Ferris took in putting together Tools of Titans, which it shares with Mason Currey’s Daily Rituals and Maira Kalman’s My Favourite Things — essentially a collection of things he found interesting and applicable, and which the reader can take or leave.\n\nNovember\n\nBooks\n\nCharity Girl — Georgette Heyer\n\nLondon’s Last True Scoundrel — Christina Brooke\n\nThe Magic of Thinking Big — David J Schwartz\n\nThe Paradox of Choice — Barry Schwartz\n\nAngel of the Crows — Katherine Addison\n\nThe Eye of Love — Margery Sharpe\n\nMovies/theatre/other\n\nBaby Done\n\nThe Happiest Season\n\nBorn With Teeth — Liz Duffy Adams, table reading with Emily Carding and Margo MacDonald\n\nThoughts: GOODNESS I enjoyed The Eye of Love (thanks go to Jenny Clements for that). Gentle and focussed, with characters who would be ridiculous if they did not take themselves and their lives so seriously. The table reading of Liz Duffy Adams was a delight — and really interesting to see a certain shift in acting-for-Zoom from what it had been earlier this year, with so much moving into the head and hands. Also the way specificity (of, for example, job) in Baby Done made the story both smaller and expanded it beyond the superficial."
