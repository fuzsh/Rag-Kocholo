        "text": "My dear friend Brenda Arnold has a new book coming out entitled The Art of Becoming Someone Else Entirely. It’s WONDERFUL! So today I’m stepping out of the way here on the blog to share an essay she wrote for you about her new book, which is fabulous and which I loved reading. In fact, here’s the blurb I wrote for it:\n\n“Set in a vintage landscape, Arnold’s book yet powerfully resonates with the challenges of modern life: complicated relationships, compelling romance, and an unending hope that everything will, in fact, work out in the end. This witty and emotionally rich story will have you alternately laughing and feeling beautifully overwhelmed. Myrna’s story is a satisfying read.”\n\n(The book has also been blurbed by Gail Storey, Stephen Stark, and Meredith Moore, if that gives you any indication of the impact it’s already had.)\n\nYou can find the book here, launching on December 15th (just in time for some major gift-giving holidays… I’m just sayin’…).\n\nThe Art of Writing a Novel\n\nby Brenda Arnold\n\nWhat propels a writer to write an entire book? Plot. Theme. Characters. Genre. Every choice is valid. In my case, it was an inexplicable desire to write a story about the nature of love. A rather odd choice for a woman of a certain age but then, there it was. Go figure.\n\nI began my literary journey one sultry summer afternoon while sitting on the leather sofa inside my husband’s home office. He was surfing the web; I was soaking in the sun that seeped through our picture window.\n\nSedona, I thought. I’d like to write a book about the nature of love and set my pivotal scene in the heart of Sedona. The peculiar thing was that I’d never been to Sedona. I only knew that it was a mystical place filled with magic and the spirit of ghosts. Later I’d read volumes about the wonders of Sedona and learn that it was magical indeed. As for why I wanted to write a book about the nature of love? Beats me.\n\nI knew very little about writing a novel. I’d published a number of quirky short stories, I loved to read, and I had an MFA with a major in screenwriting. I quickly learned, however, that writing a screenplay has very little in common with the art of writing a novel. The one thing I did know: that I wanted to write the kind of book I’d want to read.\n\nAs I sat there half-asleep that day, two barely defined characters crept into my mind. I closed my eyes and let my thoughts drift. And then, in a moment that I will never be able to explain, the entire scene seemed to pour out of me and onto the blank pad of yellow legal paper that lived on my husband’s couch.\n\nThis inexplicable moment would never happen again. As for the fact the whole scene came to me so quickly and so easily—two adjectives that I never apply to my work—I have no rational explanation. All I really know is that this initial success allowed me to believe that I could write the kind of novel I wanted to write. I still don’t have a clue how that scene came about. I only know that it contains the best writing I’ve ever done in the shortest amount of time.\n\nWhat I’ve learned since that surreal summer day are several random but concrete things I wanted to share with you. Because magic notwithstanding, writing a novel requires far more. Persistence. Dedication. Consistency. Imagination. And a computer that works.\n\nThe irony is that I’d been an English major back in college and loved to read novels. Jane Austen. The Brontë sisters. Even Henry James. Nineteenth century novels: I adored them all. The only modern books I read were celebrity biographies. Cary Grant. Audrey Hepburn. I was a sucker for that kind of thing.\n\nEverything changed, however, the day my daughter suggested I read a book entitled The Mysteries of Pittsburgh by Michael Chabon. She also gave me a novel entitled Rameau’s Niece by Cathleen Schine. And I was hooked.\n\nAbandoning the Brontë sisters, I suddenly entered the twentieth century. With the gorgeous words of Chabon and Schine singing inside my head, I felt profoundly inspired. I knew what I liked; I knew what I wanted to write. Whimsy. Humor. Imagination. Exquisite language. It was a total revelation; it was a complete surprise.\n\nSo . . . magic aside, I’d like to share these random but concrete thoughts in case they might be helpful if you’re planning to write a novel. For starters, is it helpful to study writing when you’re in school? Hell, yes, I say. If I’d had any formal training, my novel might have taken me less than a dozen years. (An exaggeration, to be sure, but my point is a valid one.)\n\nIf formal training is not an option, my next suggestion—and perhaps an even better one—is to read voraciously and in the genre that appeals to you. But read like an author. Take notes on what you like. Take notes on what you dislike. But whatever you do, keep reading and reading and taking copious notes. (How-to books have never appealed to me. But if that’s your thing, I highly recommend Stephen King’s seminal book.)\n\nNext, once you’ve started to work on your novel, join a local writing group—but not just any group. Try to join a truly constructive group. One that’s compassionate and kind. One that serves dinner or occasional snacks. One that doesn’t include any negative writers who delight in criticizing other people’s work. Encouragement is divine; negativity sucks.\n\nAnother brief digression. Here are some other useful pieces of advice that were given to me along the way. Whenever you write, sit at your computer and bleed. (Not literally, of course—but I often cry with my characters when they face adversity.) Another piece of advice: write moment to moment—you can always edit later.\n\nAs for my favorite parts of the process, I particularly love when my characters surprise me. Or when I write an especially witty line. The greatest thrill, of course, comes when a reader sees in your work what you hoped she or he would see. That is thrilling indeed!\n\nThe next piece of advice is a fairly obvious one, but here it is anyway. Be willing to revise and put your book away. Then revise and put your book away. Then revise and put your book away again. Repeat this sequence until you are absolutely certain that your novel is finished or that you’re ready to set fire to your entire manuscript. (These two emotions often occur simultaneously.)\n\nIt is at this point that it’s time to hire a developmental editor, but not just any editor. You need to find an editor who is not only an expert in your particular genre—and has a keen eye for structure and language—but one who will be a cheerleader for your book. Let me digress again.\n\nI managed to hire a reputable editor who absolutely loathed my book. He pocketed my three thousand dollars, wrote less than a dozen comments on my manuscript, and topped that off with a scathing paragraph in which he told me how much he hated my work. Less than two weeks later, he was fired from the job he’d held for twenty years and subsequently had a nervous breakdown.\n\nI hired another editor.\n\nThe person I hired was a lovely young writer named Andrea Robinson, who proved to be everything that my first editor was not. She peppered me with suggestions. She overflowed with knowledge. And, most of all, she did the one thing that I couldn’t get myself to do: she restructured my novel. It was then that my book began to take shape.\n\nAfter a certain point, Andrea felt that I needed another opinion. So I hired a third editor: this one a relatively famous person who had edited a famous book that had become a semi-famous movie. I was stoked. Unfortunately, this woman loathed my book. She was hoping for Dostoevsky; I was looking for charming and enchanting. Still, she was the expert so I wrote and rewrote many a scene while I wept in private. (This brings me to one of my cardinal rules: believe in your vision and believe in yourself.) Meanwhile, after three months and another three thousand dollars, she sent me an email suggesting that perhaps we should part ways. I speed-dialed Andrea R.\n\nEver generous, Andrea agreed to reread my book. And what did she think? She thought that all the charm and humor and magic had been sucked out of my book. I thanked her profusely, wept for another week, and spent the next six months reviewing nearly everything that I’d added or deleted. This was majorly discouraging. My suggestion then is this: try to find one good editor, one constructive-only writing group, and have faith in yourself and in the book that you want to create.\n\nBy now, my book had been revised and revised and revised until I was certain it was finally complete. Of course, every article suggests that you hire a professional copy editor before you send your book out into the world. “It’s a necessity,” everyone writes. I, on the other hand—after all these years of revising and rereading—was certain that my novel was now letter-perfect. Still, I decided to hire an experienced copy editor named Angélique Jamail who promptly found more than two dozen errors—misspelled words, missing sentences, extraneous spaces etc. etc. So I say this to you: hire an excellent copy editor. It’s worth every penny!\n\nWriting a novel is quite an accomplishment. It is lonely at times. Exasperating at times. Exhausting at times. But it is glorious as well, especially when you’ve written what you hoped you could write. I am so grateful for the adventure. Of course, I hope you will read my novel; and, if you do, I hope you will enjoy my novel. I also hope that you’ll consider submitting an Amazon review. Because what is a novel if you don’t have an audience to read it?\n\nBrenda Arnold’s The Art of Becoming Another Person Entirely is a love letter to L.A. in the summer of 1965. It is also a story about love, loss, and the art of transformation. It will be available on Amazon and in a number of book stores as of December 15, 2023.\n\nOnce again, because it is a popular follow-up to my annual Books I Read lists, I’m including a list of the category romance titles I read this past year and ranking them by heat level. For those who might be unfamiliar with that term, it essentially refers to the sensuality level or raciness of the story. There are several different technical, helpful guides and explanations for how to rate such things if you go looking for them online, but I’ll summarize the widely accepted definitions below.\n\nSomething to remember here: I’m not including any titles that could easily or more appropriately fit into a different genre, such as fantasy, even if those stories contain strong romantic subplots. This ranking list is strictly for titles that don’t really fit anywhere else.\n\nAlso, once again, I’m including an explanation of the usually accepted five heat levels within the romance genre. Again, these categories of romance have been well established for a while now, and these are the ranking guidelines I use. You can no doubt find other ways of ranking them or other descriptions of them, but these are the descriptions I go by, so please bear that in mind.\n\nHere are the five levels of heat, in order, with very brief descriptions:\n\n* MILD — Sweet like a Hallmark Christmas movie, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend these titles to my adolescent children or even mature middle schoolers who were genuinely interested in the genre. In many examples of this heat level, the most titillating thing that happens might be kissing and the occasional cute innuendo.\n\n* MEDIUM — Generally equivalent to a PG-13 movie in that intimate situations or scenes are there, but they aren’t graphically described and won’t likely make people (who like the concept of kissing books) uncomfortable. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend books like these to high school students who genuinely liked YA romance. (Please note that not all titles in this heat level will be YA.)\n\n* HOT — Sometimes called steamy, sexy, or spicy, this level includes most category romance books and offers a wide range of description of intimate activity and the language used to describe it; the titles I’ve included here also represent a wide range within this heat level.\n\n* NUCLEAR — Expect graphic descriptions and possible forays beyond vanilla.\n\n* EROTIC (ROMANCE) — This heat level pushes boundaries, most definitely; the characters’ emotional journeys are lived through explicit sexual activity, but (unlike in erotica) the emotional journey and the external story still retain primacy — as does the all-important happy story ending.\n\nAnd here are the titles I read this past year, ranked by me:\n\nMILD:\n\nNone this past year, although if I were including other books from my reading list that didn’t fit exclusively into category romance, some of them would probably be here.\n\nMEDIUM:\n\nCinder-Nanny by Sariah Wilson\n\nRoommaid by Sariah Wilson\n\nBoyfriend Material by Alexis Hall\n\nHOT:\n\nSleeper by Kayley Loring\n\nCharmer by Kayley Loring\n\nTrouble Maker by Kayley Loring\n\nRomancing Mister Bridgerton by Julia Quinn\n\nAll the Feels by Olivia Dade\n\nThe Love Interest by Kayley Loring\n\nMunro by Kresley Cole *\n\nOne Last Stop by Casey McQuiston\n\nGood Vibrations by Kayley Loring\n\nA Very Bossy Christmas by Kayley Loring\n\nA Not So Meet Cute by Meghan Quinn\n\nA Very Friendly Valentines Day by Kayley Loring\n\nSo Not Meant to Be by Meghan Quinn\n\nHello Darling by Kayley Loring\n\nIt Takes a Villa by Kilby Blades\n\nThe Reunion by Meghan Quinn\n\nThe One Night by Meghan Quinn\n\nShip Wrecked by Olivia Dade\n\nNUCLEAR:\n\nGet Off Easy by Sara Brookes **\n\nSwitch It Up by Sara Brookes **\n\nIn the Rough by Sara Brookes **\n\nEROTIC (ROMANCE):\n\nGet Off Easy by Sara Brookes **\n\nSwitch It Up by Sara Brookes **\n\nIn the Rough by Sara Brookes **\n\n* Munro by Kresley Cole is the latest installment in her Immortals After Dark series, which overall is most definitely in the nuclear category. However, Munro was published after quite a long hiatus from the rest of the series, and I don’t recall it having the same timbre as the previous books. Proceed with caution in case my memory is faulty.\n\n** I suspect that with this trilogy by Sara Brookes, how a reader perceives the heat level is going to be largely determined by the individual reader’s experience and taste. All three books could fit into either or both heat levels.\n\nThis year’s Books I Read list is the longest it has been since I started keeping track of it, by far. For instance, I came down with an illness at the start of the summer that had me unable to get out of bed for a solid week, and in that week I read ten books, which had been my previous goal for how many books to read over the summer. I plowed through them — I tend to read at a fairly quick pace — and then kept right on going.\n\nThis year, I found myself reading voraciously anything that put me in a good mood, because reasons. Therefore you will find a lot of books on this year’s list that are just really fun, including — but not limited to — laugh-out-loud romantic comedies (which is rapidly becoming one of my favorite genres).\n\nI also dove into a bunch of series this year, so you’ll see a lot fewer individual authors on the list than book titles. The breadth of my reading diet was also, therefore, not as wide as I normally strive for. (I’ll do better next year.) One thing I found interesting is that some series were excellent all the way through, and some were…less consistent.\n\nOne thing I’m always curious about is how an author maintains a contiguous storyline over multiple books, especially since I’m working on a series like that myself. But I’m also interested to see how series set within the same “world” (whether it’s the real one or not) work when each book is a separate storyline but shares characters. (We see things like this quite often in category romance, where different characters play supporting roles in their friends’ stories and then get to have their own protagonistic moment in their own book. And yes, I’m working on a series like that, too, though not in the romance genre.)\n\nAlso, because I am sometimes a completist, if there’s a book I want to read that’s in the middle of a series, I will read the books that came before it first. (See also the note above about the two types of series I’m studying the mechanics of.)\n\nAs always, I’m leaving off my list the titles of any books I did not finish reading. Likewise the titles of any manuscripts I read which are not yet published. This year I am including, however, books I read which I had read before in a previous year. There are some titles I revisit, either because I love them or because I’m studying them for craft/genre reasons or because I’m teaching them.\n\nSee below the list for a partial breakdown of genres.\n\nSleeper by Kayley Loring\n\nCharmer by Kayley Loring\n\nThe Night She Went Missing by Kristen Bird\n\nTrouble Maker by Kayley Loring\n\nBloodwarm by Taylor Byas\n\nRomancing Mister Bridgerton by Julia Quinn\n\nAll the Feels by Olivia Dade\n\nThe Last Graduate by Naomi Novik\n\nStill Mine by Jayne Pillemer\n\nEurydice by Sarah Ruhl\n\nThe Love Interest by Kayley Loring\n\nMunro by Kresley Cole\n\nPayback’s A Witch by Lana Harper\n\nThe Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern\n\nBinti by Nnedi Okorafor\n\nPersepolis by Marjane Satrapi\n\nBinti: Sacred Fire by Nnedi Okorafor\n\nBinti: Home by Nnedi Okorafor\n\nBoogie Knights by Lisa Wheeler\n\nBinti: The Night Masquerade by Nnedi Okorafor\n\nUncertain Resident by Tova Hinda Siegel\n\nTethered to Stars by Fady Joudah\n\nUnbroken edited by Marieke Nijkamp\n\nOne Last Stop by Casey McQuiston\n\nBlood Countess by Lana Popović\n\nGood Vibrations by Kayley Loring\n\nA Very Bossy Christmas by Kayley Loring\n\nThe Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi\n\nA Not So Meet Cute by Meghan Quinn\n\nShutter by Taylor Byas\n\nThe Author Wheel Quick Guide to Productive Writing Habits by G.C.

Just ask if you want to know. (Also, if you want to read my formal review of Kristen Bird’s The Night She Went Missing, click here to read my essay that was published by Literary Mama.)\n\nAt some point in the next week-ish, I will do my annual Romance Titles Ranked By Heat Level list as well, since that seems to be very popular here on the blog.\n\nSo. What have you been reading? Anything you’d like to recommend? Have at it in the comments!\n\nHere we are on the last day of 2021, and I’m confident I won’t finish by tonight the book I’m currently in the middle of reading, so I’ll just go ahead and do my 2021 Reading Year in Review post now. In case you haven’t seen these posts in the past when I’ve done them and would like more context for why I write them, please click here for 2019 and here for 2020.\n\nThe short version is that I’m happiest when I’m reading a lot for fun. Not just reading student papers (which I can enjoy but which is work), not just reading emails or social media posts (rarely fun, and usually decidedly worse), not just reading my critique partners’ manuscripts (can be enjoyable but definitely uses a different part of my reading brain). Reading for pleasure is actually one of the few activities that I can reliably depend on for a dopamine hit. I love reading when I’m reading something good.\n\nSo in an effort to read fun books more, and in an effort to broaden my reading diet, I started several years ago keeping a list of the books I read each year. The listmaking accomplished both of these goals really well. I will admit, though, my pleasure reading quota this year was not quite as many books as I would have liked, nor were the titles on it as broadly varied as I typically strive for. Part of this was because of the overwhelm of my job, which was really something else entirely this year — so I read fewer books overall — and part of it was my apparent need for predictably happy endings in the stories I was reading — so I read more category romance. I also started writing (actually drafting, not just making notes and transcribing random scenes from my imagination) a romance this year, too, so that influenced my choices somewhat. Finally, I took some poetry classes over the summer and am working on another poetry collection; the beneficial effect this had on my reading list was to add more poetry titles.\n\nIt’s useful to note that on my list, I will include books I reread, but if I read them more than once in a single year (which happens occasionally, particularly when I’m studying a text), I will list them only once. Books I read but which are not yet published will not be listed here, nor will I list books which I started but did not finish (or do not intend to finish). You might notice that some of these titles are part of one series or another and when I enjoy a series, I tend to keep reading it, even if I don’t typically binge all of the books one right after another.\n\nSo without further explanation, here is my 2021 Reading Year in Review. (I’ll do a little more category analysis after the list.)\n\nAll At Once by Brill Harper\n\nAny Rogue Will Do by Bethany Bennett\n\nThe Viscount Who Loved Me by Julia Quinn\n\nAn Offer from a Gentleman by Julia Quinn\n\nMeaty by Samantha Irby\n\nBeneath the Keep by Erika Johansen\n\nThe Millionaire Booklet by Grant Cardone\n\nCinderella Is Dead by Kalynn Bayron\n\nYou Can Do Anything, Magic Skeleton! by Chuck Wending\n\nThe New Yorker Book of Lawyer Cartoons by The New Yorker\n\nSpoiler Alert by Olivia Dade\n\nSteering the Craft by Ursula K.

I mostly read narrative fiction this year, which is typical for me as it is my favorite thing to read, by far. But I also read other genres:\n\n* non-fiction — 7 titles\n\n* poetry — 6 titles\n\n* plays — 1 title\n\n* humor — 4 titles\n\n* graphic forms — 3 titles\n\nMost of what I read is typically considered adult fiction, but I do also like YA. In the YA category, I read 3 titles this year: Cinderella Is Dead, Before We Disappear, and Blame It on the Mistletoe. And while the three YA titles I read this year might also be marketed as YA romance, I’m not including them as category romance because I think the other important plot elements (and in fact, their entire overarching narratives) really do bear more of the weight in those stories.\n\nAnd that’s it, my reading list for 2021! I had a generally good year for reading, not gonna lie. Watch in the coming days for a post on this year’s romance titles ranked by heat level, which is something a few of you excellent blog readers requested a couple of years ago and which has been a hit every time I’ve done it.\n\nSo…what on this list is interesting to you? Have you read any of these titles, and if so, what did you think? Would you like a review of any of these books? Let me know in the comments.\n\nAs of today, the December issue of the SONIC CHIHUAHUA is ready to go out the door and to a mailbox (or eagerly awaiting open hand) near you!\n\nSo how are things going, eight issues in, with my little zine?\n\nWell, frankly, WELL.\n\nI will be the first to admit that restarting this zine after a twenty-nine-year hiatus was an impulsive lark. It was a decision that I made quickly, even if the seeds of that decision had been planted and quietly sprouting for a couple of years or so. And for the first couple of issues this spring, I was very much feeling my way (again) around the mechanics and logistics of putting a project like this together.\n\nEvery month. With paper and black pens and scissors and an adhesive roller.\n\nThe first issue ended up being almost twice as long as I’d intended, but it was a good length and is one I’ve stuck with. Figuring out the layout of the zine and the formatting of the content that was printed involved a fair bit of trial-and-error, but I got there. During our pandemically deprived social life, the Sonic Chihuahua became my new Friday night jam, and I loved it.\n\nAnd even better was the reaction I enjoyed from nearly everyone I sent it to: excitement, enthusiasm, eager support, encouragement. Even, occasionally, someone giving me money for it! (Though financial contributions have always been optional.) There were even a couple of months when the income earned from the zine surpassed the royalties earned on my books!\n\nAnd the zine grew. Oh wow, did it grow. The distribution, which wasn’t small to begin with, is half again larger than it was when it started, and now I have regular contributors sending me wonderful content to include. I’m loving that!\n\nWithout putting too fine a point on it, the Sonic Chihuahua has been, for me, exactly what I needed, exactly when I needed it. And I’ve heard from several readers that it has been what they needed, too, and this also makes me quite happy.\n\nIn November, Han and I went to Zine Fest Houston. I’d never attended before and was thrilled that Sonic Chihuahua got in. The event itself was excellent — it was a gorgeous day with perfect weather, the fest was in an open-air warehouse space that caters to arts events, the organizers were totally on the ball, and the crowds were big enough for Han and me to be busy all afternoon but not so thick that we felt unsafe. (And yes, we wore masks.) It was a delightfully good day, and we got to browse around and see dozens of other zinesters and their work. I learned a lot.\n\nFor one thing, our little zine was well-received. That’s always nice.\n\nFor another thing, there’s a whole bunch of incredible indie and self-publishing and artwork happening out there, and it’s well worth checking out.\n\nAnd finally, our production schedule is way aggressive!\n\nPutting an issue out there once a month, turns out, is rather more frequent than most zinesters are doing. (In fact, we encountered maybe none who were, besides us.) Add to that the increasing costs to produce the paper zine, and the fact that a few of my readers have told me they don’t always finish reading it before the next issue comes (there’s a LOT in each one, y0), and the other fact that I would really like to finish at least one of the novels I’m currently writing…\n\nYou can see where this is going, can’t you? I’ve decided that in 2022, volume 3 of the Sonic Chihuahua will come out every other month instead of every month. I’ve also standardized subscription rates — for those who wish to pay for it — and even added a limited digital option (by subscription only). All of this feels like the right direction to go in, for various reasons which are boring but which I’m happy to expound upon if people want me to. (Leave your questions in the comments, if you have them.)\n\nYou’ll see the same awesome content as before. You’ll just have more time to enjoy it before the next issue comes out. Also look for more art in the zine, starting with December’s issue this week.\n\nSo on balance, I would say the zine has been a highly worthwhile project for me personally and highly appreciated by those who read it, and therefore I will keep making it. Woot! Thank you to everyone who has subscribed and/or read and/or shared photos of the zine on their social media. I appreciate all of this more than you know!"
