        "text": "Creativity is a path, a destiny, and an origin. For some it is intangible, but as an object of study it can be measured, analyzed, modified . . . and also promoted. Perhaps it is this latter aspect that makes the most sense in this text. This book brings together the leading scholars in the study of creativity, while at the same time giving entry to young researchers who are at the start of their journey in this field or who are using creativity to generate innovative applications in their respective fields of Psychology. This is what makes this book so diverse and original. It is not confined to one field, nor is it intended for one type of specialist. Creativity is the thread that runs through it; sometimes as a source, sometimes as a path, sometimes as a destination. Like everything cognitive, creativity has biological, cultural, and psychological components. Biology narrows it down, culture enriches it, and psychology sets it apart. Biology is the framework that regulates the boundaries of association. Culture drives the meanings that allow us to transgress (or not) the said borders. But it is in the psychological aspect where creativity truly differentiates itself. It is in this dimension that its deepest nature is found. The dimensioning of biology and the enrichment or mediation that culture can offer are highly relevant to the creative phenomenon. However, it is in the psychological field where creativity reaches its fullest dimension, and perhaps it is here where it originates: Its cognitive, emotional, and motivational components can be found here, the components that drive, forge, and originate it. These building blocks can be summarized, with some theoretical considerations, in the psychological construct known as the creative attitude: a conglomerate of evaluations, affections, and primarily flexible behaviors that are tenacious and proactive under uncertainty and are oientednges in Creativity & Psychology for the XXI to the generation of socially or individually relevant ideas or actions (Penagos-Corzo, 2014). Thus, it is likely that this creative attitude has been an important aspect in the participation of the authors of Challenges in Creativity and Psychology for the XXI Century, and we also hope that it will be present to some extent in our prospective readers. As an object of psychological study, creativity has led to the identification of characteristic behaviors and thought styles. It has made it possible to develop instruments to measure it, while thousands of words have been written in relation to it. From a psychological point of view, creativity is studied to be understood, predicted, and controlled. Creativity is an elusive construct. Its standard definition generally involves originality and utility (Runco and Jaeger, 2012). However, when it comes to embracing it in its entirety, few approaches to creativity are parsimonious. By not considering the principle of parsimony, the complexity of the object of study overflows; it becomes elusive and probably ends up not being studied at all. A parsimonious approach may contain the simplicity of Guilford’s (1950) proposal or may describe its cognitive, socio-affective, and physical components (Hadani, Fortescue, Rood, & Runco, 2014): (a) imagination and originality, (b) flexibility, (c) decision-making, (d) communication and self-expression, (e) collaboration, (f) motivation, and (g) action and movement. The principle of parsimony represents a great challenge, as the scientific approaches to creativity are so diverse that they may even appear to speak different languages. In this sense, Hennessey and Amabile (2010), in a review of the relevant literature, point out that the approximations (or interrelationships of forces) to the comprehension of the creative phenomenon can be considered as a series of concentric circles in which the most internal is the neurological force followed, in ascending order, by affection and cognition, the individual and the personality, the group, the social environment, society, and culture until finally reaching systemic approximations. This categorization is probably more useful than the classification originally proposed by Rhodes (1961): person, process, and product. The concentric circles described by Hennessey and Amabile are a representation of the levels of analysis of the creative phenomenon. They also represent the way in which forces operate or interact. Finding elements that bind variables that can be linked in a solid way is likely to lead to greater parsimony. For this reason, it is worth highlighting the chapters of our guest authors, Marc Runco and Manuela Romo; their approaches are undoubtedly contributions that both synthesize and expand. These are parsimonious visions of creativity, visions that are doubly appreciated: once for their contribution and twice for the fact that they were created for this book. As virtually any thought process does, the generation of creative ideas requires a certain amount of association. Perhaps what makes this process unique in creativity is that the association is given unconventionally, and perhaps with some degree of over-inclusion (Schmajuk, Aziz, & Bates, 2009). However, it is also important to note that data on over-inclusion in creative thinking may be contradictory (Ottemiller, Elliott, & Giovannetti, 2014). Even so, it is widely accepted that the creative process requires openness and flexibility. In both cases, a type of associative effort is fundamental, which in the absence of a better word I will call “inclusive.” In fact, if we were figuratively speaking about creativity, we would call it inclusion. Inclusion is more than a metaphor for creativity, it is its greatest encouragement and maximum expression, for inclusion means to listen to what is different, to dialogue with what is different, to encounter what is different, and in some way to merge with what is different. It is its maximum expression because it is the best example of what is human and reflects creativity as the greatest expression of a human capacity: Unlike creating from nothing, it is to create from something, from the union of what is different. In other words, to create is to include. Inclusion is a word with a social meaning. Inclusion is spoken of when, for example, people with disabilities are incorporated into a school or company, or when spaces for diversity are opened up. Inclusion becomes a sign of a society that respects, integrates, incorporates, and probably goes further than those that do not. Thus, a human dimension is the same as a creative dimension. For all of the above reasons, this book is inclusive and embraces diverse approaches and challenges of creativity in its first part, which are translated into creative approaches in applied psychology in its second part. Challenges in Creativity & Psychology for the XXI Century It is important to mention that the book was conceived as a work to be presented in the framework of the 75th anniversary celebration of the University of the Americas Puebla. However, the vicissitudes of a changing world altered our deadlines and even part of the original proposal, although the essential aspect remains: sharing expert visions alongside young, inclusive, and diverse proposals. The final version of this book was made possible due to the participation of our co-editor, Antonia Padilla, and the University of Guadalajara, which allowed our particular challenge to become a reality. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the authors who contributed to this book: Robert Sternberg, Howard Gardner, James Kaufman, Mark Runco, Keith Sawyer, Margaret Boden, and Manuela Romo. They are the undisputed leaders in the study of creativity, the promoters and motivators of knowledge. Without knowing it, they were essential for this book to see the light of day. Their generous contributions to this book, as well as their far-sightedness, will always be an incentive to explore new paths and face new challenges."
