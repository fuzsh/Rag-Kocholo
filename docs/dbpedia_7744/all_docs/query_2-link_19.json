        "text": "Every Friday, we meet a member of the BFS and peer deep into their soul (or, at least, a form they filled out). Want to be featured? Email us: online@britishfantasysociety.org\n\nYour influences\n\nTell us about the book/film/thing that got you into SFFH: What was it? How old were you? What impact did it have on you?\n\nNo one thing did it for me. I’ve been reading SFF pretty much since I could read. My dad (thank you, dad) read SF, so my older brother picked up on that, and I picked up from him, (thank you, bro). But if we’re talking seminal works, I’d say 2000AD comic, featuring a certain grumpy fascist cop called Dredd. I was 12 years old and can still remember reading the first issue as I walked to school. It opened up a whole new kind of story-telling to me, stories where the good guys didn’t always win. Where, sometimes, the good guy wasn’t even a good guy.\n\nHow does that early influence show up in your work now?\n\nI like gritty. I’m for the little guys, the working joes. They’ve got the best stories to tell. Kings and queens, princes and princesses, not so much.\n\nWhere do you draw your creative inspiration from?\n\nWhat’s happening in the world. There’s so much that’s exhilarating and terrifying. Research is a great source of inspiration. Looking into one topic inevitably leads to new curiosities. Down the rabbit hole is way more fun than the slog of drafting. Wikipedia is an adventure playground.\n\nI try to stay sensitive to fusing disparate ideas together. I find that’s the alloy which makes for the best story. Though it’s not always easy to translate good ideas into good story, so a fair amount gets left by the wayside (and in the rejection pile!).\n\nWho do you look to as a genre hero? Why?\n\nHoward Waldrop. His story ideas are way out there. Way, way, way out, beyond the line of sight, out there at times. But he’s such a great wordsmith. I’ve read stories of his that I had no clue about, from start to finish, and still enjoyed, simply for the prose.\n\nYour work\n\nYou’re stuck in an elevator for 60 seconds with that hero, and they want you to describe your work. Give us the pitch.\n\nThe Festival of Hungry Ghosts sees the Big Bad Wolf leave Fairyland, to work as a private eye in 1930’s Los Angeles. He’s got a new case he doesn’t want; finding the kidnapped son of a local crime boss. He’s got a new partner he doesn’t trust; a chaotic female gangster, who’s a fox spirit with a fondness for dames, booze and bullets. In three days’ time, the kid dies. But if the kid’s found, it spells a whole load more trouble for BB Wolf. Lethal trouble.\n\nWhat are you working on right now?\n\nDrafting a sequel to the above. My character, BB Wolf, has found a place in my heart. I like the guy. So, naturally, I want to make life as difficult as possible for him.\n\nI’m also in the early planning stages of a second world fantasy inspired by Michael Moorcock’s “Elric,” but think more a working class Elric, a wandering swordsman who’s in thrall to his cursed sword, which compels him to carry out all manner of grisly jobs.\n\nThinking about all of your stories/work you’ve done, which one sticks out most in your mind? Why?\n\nThe relationship between my two main characters in The Festival of Hungry Ghosts. They start as strangers, their friendship grows more intimate. And it ends . . . Well, you’ll need to buy the book to find out. But it was a joy to write.\n\nWhere and when do you create/are you at your most creative?\n\nMornings are my writing time, sitting at an old dining table I use for a desk. If I need to mull things over, it’s out to my local forest, where I work as a volunteer. A bit of grunt work is great for working loose ideas.\n\nWhat’s your writing soundtrack?\n\nThe sound of the sea. It’s right outside my house.\n\nThe quickfire round\n\nSci-fi, fantasy or horror?\n\nFantasy\n\nQuiet or loud?\n\nLoud\n\nDark or light?\n\nDark\n\nStrict lines or genre blend?\n\nBlend\n\nAwards or bestseller?\n\nBestseller\n\nFiction or non-fiction?\n\nFiction\n\nPoetry or prose?\n\nProse\n\nPlotter or pantser?\n\nPlotter\n\nReading or listening?\n\nReading\n\nNotebook or computer?\n\nComputer\n\nFavourite podcast?\n\nI’ve never listened to a podcast. That doesn’t make me a bad person, does it?\n\nThe home stretch\n\nWhat’s the best thing about being a SFFH writer/agent/publisher/reader/fan?\n\nGoing back to something you’ve written and thinking, “Yeah, that’s not half bad.” And seeing your name on a contents list is pretty cool.\n\nTime to plug your stuff! Where can we find you and your work? What have you got coming up? Consider this your advertising space.\n\nMy debut urban fantasy novel, The Festival of Hungry Ghosts, from Champagne Book Group, is due for publication in 2024.\n\nMy short stories have appeared in the following anthologies, amongst others:\n\nSwords and Sorceries Vol. 7, Parallel Universe Publications.\n\nDaughter of Sarpedon, Brigids Gate Press.\n\nJudge Dredd The Megazine (reprinted in Judge Fear’s Big Day Out and Other Stories), Rebellion Publishing.\n\nOne Last Chance: A Fabled Journey Anthology, Remastered Words, audio book.\n\nFabled Journey II, Remastered Words, audio book.\n\nSecrets and Confessions, Scottish Book Trust.\n\nAnd I had a comic strip published in Futurequake 2019 (Futurequake Press). I’m particularly proud of that one. You think breaking into writing is hard? Try comics; always there for people who need more disappointment in their lives."
