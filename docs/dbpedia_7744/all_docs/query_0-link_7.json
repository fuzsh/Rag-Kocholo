        "text": "Why I write m/m romance, or anything else\n\nFemale authors in this genre are frequently asked why we write m/m romance. I find the question a little annoying. If it is so bizarre and inconceivable for a straight woman to write something as mundane as two men falling in love, I really wonder why nobody has ever questioned my ability to write serial killers, organised crime, complex magic systems, giant rat death, alternate worlds, or a Victorian nobleman punching a ghost in the face â€“ also things of which I have no personal experience.\n\nThe corollary of this question is, now I have a few m/m titles under my belt, people are asking why my next book is m/f. Permanent change? Temporary change? Why that?\n\nWell, hereâ€™s why.\n\nI wrote a couple of unpublished novels a few years back. I loved writing, wanted to do more. Then life happened, in a big way. I had two kids in close succession, the second of whom didnâ€™t sleep for more than four hours consecutively for fourteen months. We moved house. We were unpleasantly burgled. My son was hospitalised. I lost my job. There was other bad stuff, a lot of it. It all sucked.\n\nAnd I wanted to write, I really did, but with two kids under two, when youâ€™re so sleep deprived you canâ€™t see in colour any more, when youâ€™re scrabbling not to go under in the roiling stress, it doesnâ€™t happen. Even when I did claw out an hour of time, I couldnâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™ve a folder of false starts, from paragraphs to pages, none of them going anywhere. It felt like Iâ€™d never write again.\n\nThen I had an idea for a fantasy. It was a Victorian alt-world about a man with an inexplicable link to magpies, and a plot against his life, and a magical underworld to be explored. What it was not was a romance, of any kind at all. I hadnâ€™t plotted it out, wasnâ€™t remotely up to that yet: I was just writing from an idea of a first scene. I wrote a foul-mouthed nobleman, and his equally foul-mouthed manservant, and then the crucial sorcerer character entered the room, andâ€¦oh my.\n\nI did, actually, attempt to ignore the sexual tension for a while, because I wasnâ€™t writing a romance, but it didnâ€™t go away. (This is the kind of thing that really annoys non-writers of my acquaintance. â€˜How can characters do what they want without your volition?â€™ they say. â€˜Youâ€™re making it up! You decide what happens!â€™ Yes, well, all I can say is: it doesnâ€™t work like that.)\n\nSo I looked at the plot, and the mounting tension between the characters, and I thought, â€˜It seems that Iâ€™m writing a gay romance novel.â€™ And then I thought, â€˜I meant to write a fantasy novel. Do I want to be writing this?â€™ And my conclusion was, basically, â€˜Who gives a damn for genre labels. This is a book that works. At last.â€™\n\nThat story became The Magpie Lord because it worked. I wrote the sequels, A Case of Possession and Flight of Magpies (out in October), because the characters were too much fun to stop playing with. I wrote another m/m, Think of England, which is coming in July, because the entire plot arrived in my head, special delivery, in one glorious fully formed thought. I also wrote a m/f contemporary thriller, Non-Stop Till Tokyo, which comes out next week, because it was another story I had to tell.\n\nSo basically, my answer to â€˜Why do you write X?â€™ is â€˜Because thatâ€™s the story I have.â€™ Gay or straight, Victorian London or contemporary Tokyo, sweet or bloodthirsty or downright weird. (Possibly all of it is downright weird.) Iâ€™m just grateful Iâ€™ve got my stories back, and Iâ€™ll keep writing them as they come."
