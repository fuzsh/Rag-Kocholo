The tradition of keeping track of anonymous overheard bits and bobs started for us at the 2002 ConJose in San Jose where trying (or trying not to) fill in the blanks on overheard conversations made us laugh so much that we made it a tradition. This issue we thought we'd share some highlights from this year's World Fantasy Convention:\n\n\"A LOT of dragon-hatching happens.\"\n\n\"I'm assuming it's like puff pastry with tentacles.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that dragon circumcision scene is really racy!\"\n\n\"If this is the book of ultimate power that can destroy the world, why the hell is it available in trade paperback?\"\n\n\"That's like walking gum & chewing the sidewalk at the same time.\"\n\n\"You're young & you're wearing elf ears, you can't possibly be the artist.\"\n\n\"Oh look, dead things on rice!\"\n\n\"I'm a sudden convert to skeleton bling.\"\n\n\"I get lost right around the talking dogs.\"\n\n\"It means \"inter-species poinking\".\"\n\nFrom The Office\n\nWill Return Next Month\n\nTop Sellers At Borderlands\n\nHardcovers\n\n1) Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman\n\n2) Woken Furies by Richard Morgan\n\n3) Children of the Company by Kage Baker\n\n4) Thud! by Terry Pratchett\n\n5) Snake Agent by Liz Williams (Nightshade Books)\n\n6) Judas Unchained by Peter F.

Buy any two used books and get a third one of equal or lesser value for free! Collectable books are not included in this deal but they will be 10% off all day long, and finally, everything else in the store will be 20% off (artwork, employees, and cat excluded, sorry). The sale will only run for one day, and this sale only happens once a year, so mark your calendars for Saturday, November 12th. THANK YOU all for your support.\n\nSaturday, November 12th at 3:00 pm, Steven Erikson, MEMORIES OF ICE (Tor) - Borderlands' customers were some of the first fantasy readers in the United States to go crazy for Steven Erikson's MALAZAN BOOKS OF THE FALLEN -- and now you can meet the author. From Books at Transworld: \"His debut fantasy novel, GARDENS OF THE MOON, was acclaimed for its combination of originality and intelligent, strong and exciting storytelling, singling out its author as a writer destined to rank alongside . . . giants of the genre. The first in a truly epic series chronicling the ill-fated Malazan Empire, GARDENS OF THE MOON also took the internet by storm and had fans falling over themselves to praise this brilliant debut.\" Erikson will be signing copies of the third book in the series, the US hardcover of MEMORIES OF ICE. Don't miss this rare opportunity to meet the world-maker in person! As it turns out, Mr. Erikson will be arriving at 2:00 pm to sign store stock, so if you'd like a chance to chat a bit, show up early!\n\nSaturday, November 19th at 3:00 pm, Terry Bisson, GREETINGS, (Tachyon Publications) and Paul Park, A PRINCESS OF ROUMANIA (Tor) - Borderlands is pleased to welcome two fabulous authors for this just-added event! From Tachyon Publications: \"Terry Bisson, author of the cult classic “They’re Made out of Meat,” has received speculative fiction’s highest accolades, including the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and Sturgeon Awards, and the Grand Prix de l’Imaginaire. Bisson has written six novels, including PIRATES OF THE UNIVERSE, a New York Times Notable Book and TALKING MAN, a World Fantasy Award nominee. His ecologically-based time travel novella Dear Abbey, nominated for the British Science Fiction Association Award, is included in GREETINGS.\n\nYou’re about to face off with an Ashcroft van, break out from an assisted-dying facility, witness a volunteer crucifixion, endure a Neanderthal eviction, and journey to the end of time on a porch glider. Each of these ten blazingly satiric short stories will leave you exhausted, outraged, and eager for the next ride. Often compared to Neil Gaiman, Jonathan Lethem, and James Morrow, Terry Bisson spins out radically irreverent tales.\" We'll also have copies of Terry's newest book, NUMBERS DON'T LIE.\n\nAlso joining us will be Paul Park, presenting his amazing new book A PRINCESS OF ROUMANIA. From Publisher's Weekly: \"Sharp characterization and an unusual historical backdrop distinguish Park's charming leadoff to an intricate new fantasy series. In an alternate 18th-century world where England's been swamped by a tidal wave, America teems with blond savages and \"Roumania\" and Germany battle for European domination, a magic book concocted by conjuress Aegypta Schenck sends young Miranda Popescu, the \"white tyger\" descendant of ancient royalty and Roumania's hope of freedom from \"black tyranny,\" to Massachusetts to escape the fiendish Baroness Nicola Ceausescu and the heinous elector of Ratisbon. With her best friend, Andromeda (turned magically into first a yellow dog and later a charismatic male Roumanian courtier), and her loyal teenage admirer, Peter (\"really\" the son of Roumania's bravest warrior), Miranda makes hard choices to start fulfilling her destiny. Park (CELESTIS, etc.) leaves some tantalizing loose ends, while the wily baroness and the necromancing elector promise dashing adventure and delicious heartbreak ahead. Blurbs from Ursula K. Le Guin and John Crowley testify to the novel's high quality.\" Join us to meet these incredible authors!\n\nSunday, November 20th at 3:00 pm, Mark von Schlegell, VENUSIA (Semiotext(e)) - From the publisher: \"An American-born recent ex-patriot to Germany. . .Mark von Schlegell's fiction deftly scrambles the codes of traditional science-fiction and fantasy with high literature and philosophy, generating a psychedelic weave of theory and pulp tradition. His SF and otherworldly ficto-criticism appears regularly in the international art underground -- from Brazil to Auckland to Berlin. VENUSIA, the inaugural volume of The System Series, is his first novel.\"\n\nBorderlands event policy - all events are free of charge. You are welcome to bring copies of an author's books purchased elsewhere to be autographed (but we do appreciate it if you purchase something while at the event).
