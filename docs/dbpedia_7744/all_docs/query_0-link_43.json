        "text": "If you’re a writer struggling to get published (or published again) or wrestling with the utility or non-utility of self-publishing, you may log onto this blog and think, Oh, Pressfield’s got it made; he’s had real-world success; he’s a brand.\n\nTrust me, it ain’t necessarily so.\n\nI don’t expect to be reviewed by the New York Times. Ever. The last time was 1998 for Gates of Fire. That’s eighteen years ago. The War of Art was never reviewed, The Lion’s Gate never. My other seven novels? Never.\n\nI’ve got a new one, The Knowledge, coming in a month or two. It will be reviewed, I’m certain, by no one.\n\nIf I want to retain my sanity, I have to banish such expectations from my thinking. I cannot permit my professional or artistic self-conception to be dependent on external validation, at least not of the “mainstream recognition” variety. It’s not gonna happen. I’m never gonna get it.\n\nIf you’re not reviewed by the New York Times (or seen on Oprah) your book is gonna have tough, tough sledding to gain awareness in the marketplace. No book I publish under Black Irish is going to achieve wide awareness. BI’s reach is too tiny. Our penetration of the market is too miniscule. And even being published by one of the Big Five, as The Lion’s Gate was by Penguin in 2014, is only marginally more effective.\n\nThere are maybe a hundred writers of fiction whose new books will be reviewed with any broad reach in the mainstream press. Jonathan Franzen, Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, etc. I’m not on that list. My stuff will never receive that kind of attention.\n\nDoes that bother me? I’d be a liar if I said I didn’t want to be recognized or at least have my existence and my work acknowledged.\n\nBut reality is reality. As Garth on Wayne’s World once said of his own butt, “Accept it before it destroys you.”\n\nOn the other hand, it’s curiously empowering to grasp this and to accept it.\n\nIt forces you to ask, Why am I writing?\n\nWhat is important to me?\n\nWhat am I in this for?\n\nHere is novelist Neal Stephenson from his short essay, Why I Am a Bad Correspondent:\n\nAnother factor in this choice [to focus entirely on writing to the exclusion of other “opportunities” and distractions] is that writing fiction every day seems to be an essential component in my sustaining good mental health. If I get blocked from writing fiction, I rapidly become depressed, and extremely unpleasant to be around. As long as I keep writing it, though, I am fit to be around other people. So all of the incentives point in the direction of devoting all available hours to fiction writing.\n\nI asked hypothetically in last week’s post, What if a writer worked her entire life, produced a worthy and original body of work, yet had never been published by a mainstream press and had never achieved conventional recognition? Would her literary efforts have been in vain? Would she be considered a “failure?”\n\nPart of my own answer arises from Neal Stephenson’s observation above.\n\nI wrote for twenty-eight years before I got a novel published. I can’t tell you how many times friends and family members, lovers, spouses implored me for my own sake to wake up and face reality.\n\nI couldn’t.\n\nBecause my reality was not the New York Times or the bestseller list or even simply getting an agent and having a meeting with somebody. My reality was, If I stop writing I will have to kill myself.\n\nI’m compelled.\n\nI have no choice.\n\nI don’t know why I was born like this, I don’t know what it means; I can’t tell you if it’s crazy or deluded or even evil.\n\nI have to keep trying.\n\nThat pile of unpublished manuscripts in my closet may seem to you (and to me too) to be a monument to folly and self-delusion. But I’m gonna keep adding to it, whether HarperCollins gives a shit, or The New Yorker, or even my cat who’s perched beside me right now on my desktop.\n\nI am a writer.\n\nI was born to do this.\n\nI have no choice."
