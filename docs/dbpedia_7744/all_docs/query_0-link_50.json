        "text": "Having grumped about Annihilation, based on Jeff VanderMeer’s novel [amazon], I’d like to make a post in praise of that author’s anthology work.\n\nA couple years back, while working up a syllabus for my ‘Science Fiction and Philosophy’ class, I considered The Big Book of Science Fiction (edited by the VanderMeers) [amazon]. I didn’t adopt it. I went for this one [amazon]. But I liked it. It achieves escape velocity from the Anglosphere, as it were. Stuff from around the world, not just usual suspects. For teaching purposes I wanted more usual suspects but, as a reader who has read all that, I discovered new stuff and enjoyed it. (It’s not that the usual suspects are excluded. But even the choices of stories by the big names seem uncanonical. That’s fine.)\n\nI just got another big book edited by the VanderMeers, The Weird: A Compendium of Strange and Dark Stories [amazon]. It looks great! Like Big Book they’ve worked to achieve global coverage, not just the usual English language, mostly American/British names. I’m looking forward to expanded horizons. I am a bit puzzled by the decision to exclude titles from before the 20th Century. This is stated in the Introduction, not on the cover. I feel one should get a bit of The King In Yellow in there, since it is of a piece with 20th Century stuff they’ve included. The earliest here is Alfred Kubin and Algernon Blackwood. I don’t mind. I can roll my own LeFanu, thank you. (LeFanu coined ‘weird fiction’, I think, so there would be a logic to starting with him?) But, like I said, it’s huge. 750,000 words. 20th Century will do fine, thanks.\n\nWhile I’m on the subject I have two weird questions for you. (I did a joke survey about Annihilation, so I’ll do a semi-serious one this time.)\n\n1) Do you think at least some Lovecraft stuff is SF?\n\n2) Do you think of ‘weird’ tales as being distinct from ‘supernatural’ stuff, on the one hand, and ‘horror’ on the other?\n\nKindly take 10 seconds to record your responses here. (Feel free to leave qualitative critiques of my survey design in comments!)\n\nA few of my own thoughts about these questions under the fold. (But I don’t want to pollute your responses unduly, so maybe respond first?)\n\nI do not think of Lovecraft as an SF author at all. Even when there are, like, minds in jars, and aliens from beyond the stars.\n\nMaybe if I had asked, not ‘is some Lovecraft stuff SF?’ but ‘do you ever think of Lovecraft stuff as SF?, or ‘do you ever think of Lovecraft as an SF writer?’ I would get different responses?\n\nIt’s sort of clear to me why I feel Lovecraft is not SF … but it’s still kind of weird that I feel this way. Here is Jeff VanderMeer, quoting Lovecraft’s rather well known semi-definition:\n\nA ‘weird tale’, as defined by H. P. Lovecraft in his nonfiction writings and given early sanctuary within the pages of magazines like Weird Tales (est. 1923) is a story that has a supernatural element but does not fall into the category of traditional ghost story or Gothic tale, both popular in the 1800s. Instead, it represents the pursuit of some indefinable and perhaps maddeningly unreachable understanding of the world beyond the mundane â€“ a ‘certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread’ or ‘malign and particular suspension or defeat ofÂ â€¦ fixed laws of Nature’ â€“ through fiction that comes from the more unsettling, shadowy side of the fantastical tradition.\n\nIt does seem critical that what happens is … well, weird. Possibly incomprensible to the human mind. But the idea that the truth about the universe could be too vast, awful and inhuman for our tiny minds seems like it ought to be on the SF menu as one ‘things man was not meant to know’ option among many.\n\nSo why does Lovecraft seem not-SF? Four possibilities:\n\n1) it’s the style.\n\n2) it’s the emotional tone.\n\n3) it’s that some of the stories have, like, ghouls in them. Those stories seem a lot like the others, so probably none of it is SF.\n\n4) In an alternate universe, “The Color Out of Space” is an SF classic by an SF master. No very good reason our universe is not it.\n\nHere’s a passage from I Am Providence: The Life and Times of H.P. Lovecraft [amazon], by S.T. Joshi.\n\nAmazing Stories was the first authentic science fiction magazine in English, and it continues to be published today. Lovecraft remarked wryly, “The magazine certainly lived up to its name so far as I am concerned, for I really hadn’t the remotest idea the thing would ‘land’. I guess the pseudo-scientific camouflage near the beginning was what turned the trick.” Scientific romance of a sort had been featured in the early decades of the century in Argosy, All-Story, the Thrill Book, and others, but Amazing was the first to make a coordinated effort to print material of this kind â€” material, too, that was fairly sound in its scientific premises. During its first year, when Lovecraft subscribed to it, it also attempted to draw upon what editor Hugo Gernsback perceived to be the literary origins of the field by reprinting Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and other “classics.” When these reprints ceased, Lovecraft found the new work not sufficiently interesting to warrant purchasing the magazine.\n\nBut if he was hoping that he had somehow found an alternative to Weird Tales, he was in for a rude awakening. Although his later work, as it turns out, contained a fairly significant scientific element, Amazing became a closed market to him when Gernsback paid him only $ 25.00 for the story â€” a mere 1/ 5 Â¢ per word â€” and this only after three dunning letters. Gernsback paid incredibly poorly and also delayed payment for months or even years. The inevitable occurred: many potential writers abandoned the magazine, and others who â€” like Clark Ashton Smith â€” published in it or in Gernsback’s later magazine, Wonder Stories (where the same financial practices prevailed), were compelled to file suit against him to receive payment. In the 1930s there was a lawyer who made a specialty of exacting payment from Gernsback. Although in later years Lovecraft briefly considered requests from Gernsback or from his associate editor, C. A. Brandt, for further submissions, he never again sent a tale to Amazing. He also took to calling Gernsback “Hugo the Rat.”\n\nMaybe if Gernsback had just paid, Lovecraft would have written SF. That is, stuff he wrote would have been published as it, hence now it would be thought of as it?\n\nOne final note. Harry Harrison writes, in Great Balls of Fire: An Illustrated History of Sex In Science Fiction [amazon]:\n\nDuring this period [the era of the pulps] dozens of subdivided categories were born, waxed, waned – then died. SF is one of the few survivors. Only in crumbling and overpriced magazines, pulp collectors’ items, will we ever see fiction magazines devoted solely to sea stories, weird stories, war stories, oriental tales, baseball players, cowboys – and what must be the most sickening subcategory of all time, the range romance.\n\nThis was written in 1977. It’s interesting that he regards ‘weird stories’ as a dead category, like range romance. Now, to be fair, he also seems to think ‘cowboys’ are dead. He can’t quite think ‘Westerns’ are dead. In the 70’s Louis L’Amour was still going strong. So maybe it was just that the magazine market for short Western tales was dead? I dunno. Probably Harrison was just writing quick thoughts to get his Sex and SF book to market, but I think there is something right about the notion that ‘weird tales’ sort of died out, for some decades, as a self-conscious genre. Even though there was The Twilight Zone. Stuff like that?\n\n1977 was the year Stephen King published The Shining. King almost single-handedly made horror huge. Horror isn’t quite the same as weird (if you ask me.) But huge horror drags weird back up out of the depths, in respectable dimensions? Maybe I’m wrong? ‘Weird’ seems like a very strong literary brand today. It means: Lovecraftian stuff, and stuff like that.\n\nI’m writing stuff about this stuff, so tell me what you think."
