        "text": "Life is marked by intersections and measured by the choices we make at each pause in our journey. I am fortunate to have made a good choice at the right time but more than that, many before me did the same and so the stones were set in the path long before the day of my birth. Will you not come after me and walk the stones so many before you have helped to put in place?\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\nCommencement Address, Yale University School of Human Rights and Social Justice, 1969\n\nAdolf Hitler came to Paris in June 1941 feeling the weight of his years in his legs and the taste of a dying dream in his mouth. He spent most of that first day walking up and down the Champs Elysées, working the stiffness out of his bones and muscles while he looked at the shops and the people. Some of the dull ache was from the wooden benches on the train from Hamburg; most of it was age. And beneath the discomfort of his body, his soul ached too.\n\nHe’d never been here before, he thought as the Parisians slipped past in the noon-time sun. He snorted at the revelation. A fine painter you are, he told himself.\n\nOf course, it was only for the summer. Then Paris . . . and painting, he imagined, would slip quietly to the back row of his memory. He would return to Berlin and take a job for the government buying supplies he would never see for people that he would never know. In the end, he realized, he would become his father’s son and live out the rest of his days as a quiet civil servant.\n\nAlois Hitler had been a hard man, even a cruel man, before the accident. But death up close can change the hardest heart and after nearly a month in the hospital, he returned to his family with a deep faith and a sense of compassion for all humankind . . . especially his children. He listened. He prayed. He studied St. Francis, St. John of the Cross, Meister Eckhard and even Buddha. He became gentle and warm toward his wife and their five children. Until the very end, he encouraged Adolf’s dreams. And when he died, still working as a customs official for Napoleon IV’s puppet chancellor, he left behind a small but sufficient inheritance to finance his son’s art.\n\nBy living frugally and occasionally taking odd jobs, Adolf stretched it as far as he could. He’d even set aside a bit for his old age. But come September, he’d decided, it was time to put away the canvas and brush. Time, at fifty-two, to put away childish things.\n\nAdolf sighed.\n\nAnd then something happened. He stood in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe, dwarfed by that first Napoleon’s grandiose gesture of complete victory, dwarfed by the size of his own dreams in the shadow of over thirty years of failure. He stood, feeling his breath catch in the back of his throat and his eyes turning to water. And suddenly, he was no longer alone.\n\nA girl—a pretty girl, a dark girl dressed in ragged clothing—separated from a crowd of passing students. She walked up to him without a word and kissed him hard on the mouth, pressing her body against him while she fastened a flower into the button-hole of his Prussian great coat. After the kiss, she vanished back into the crowd.\n\nAdolf licked his lips, tasting the apples from her mouth. He took in a great breath, smelling the rose water from her skin and the sunshine from her hair. He listened to the sound of his racing heart and the drum-beat it played. He felt the warmth of her where it had touched him.\n\nIt was his first impression of Paris.\n\nHis second impression was the perpetually drunk American, Ernie Hemingway.\n\nAfter a day of wandering aimlessly, as the sun dropped behind the horizon and the sky grew deep purple, Adolf found de Gaulle’s and went inside because he heard American music.\n\nAmericans had always fascinated him. He’d met a few—not many because they tended to have little use for Europe. America was an entire continent without kings or emperors or royalty of any kind. A place where they selected their own President every four years and where any one of the ninety states from Brazil to Newfoundland was a thriving nation in and of itself united by democracy, progress and freedom.\n\nA middle aged man stood on the bar leading the room in a bawdy tune. He worked the song like a conductor, waving a pistol instead of a baton, and scattered drinkers around the room joined in the song. A man in a ratty suit crouched over the piano, mashing the keys with his fingers with a rag-time flair. Adolf watched and smiled. The man sang too fast and slurred too much for the lyrics to make much sense but the gestures and pelvic thrusts conveyed the gist of it.\n\nWhen the song was done, the man dropped lightly to the floor amid cheers and brushed past Adolf on his way to a table at the back of the room. Adolf found an empty table near the American and sat down. The pianist launched into another song, this time in French—a language Adolf grasped better—and he blushed. Looking around, he was the only one who did.\n\n“Are you a priest, then?” the American shouted across at him in English.\n\nAdolf looked up. “I beg pardon?”\n\nThe American grinned. “You’re blushing. I thought you might be a priest.”\n\nHe shook his head. “No. Not a priest.”\n\n“Well then, are you a homosexual?”\n\nThe word escaped him at first, then registered. He blushed even more, looking around for a different table to sit at. He had heard that Americans were quite forward but until now had never experienced it. “I’m sorry, sir,” he said. “I’m not liking men, though I am very flattered by your . . . ” He struggled to find the right word, couldn’t find it, then said the closest one he did find. “By your . . . love.”\n\nFor a moment, he thought the American might hit him. But suddenly, the American started to laugh. The laugh started low and built fast, spilling over like an over-filled bathtub. Adolf wasn’t sure what to do so he offered a weak, tight smile. The American leaped up with his beer in his hand, staggered a few steps and sat heavily in the empty chair at Adolf’s table.\n\nHe leaned in and Adolf could smell days of alcohol rising from his skin. “Deutsche?”\n\nAdolf nodded. “Ja.”\n\nThe American stuck out his hand. “Ernie Hemingway.”\n\nHe took the hand, squeezed it firmly and pumped it once. “Adolf Hitler.”\n\nErnie waved to the bar. “Hey, de Gaulle!”\n\nA slim man looked up. “Oui, Monsieur Hemingway?”\n\n“A beer for my new friend Adolf Hitler.”\n\nThe bartender nodded. “Un moment, s’il vous plaît.”\n\nThen Hemingway leaned in again, his voice low. “You got any money?”\n\nAdolf nodded. The man’s fast speech and unpredictable movements made him nervous. He found himself blinking involuntarily.\n\n“That’ll save us both a bit of embarrassment.”\n\nHe nodded again, not quite understanding. The bartender arrived with two pints of light, foamy beer and Hemingway raised the glass. “To life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” he said.\n\n“To your health,” Adolf said.\n\n“I’m afraid it’s far too late for that,” another voice said. The pianist—finished with his tune—pulled up a chair, flipping it around backwards and straddling it. He was a short man, wiry with curly hair gone gray, blue eyes and a brief but contagious smile. “We just have to hold out hope that somehow he’ll manage to pickle himself before he begins to decompose.”\n\nAdolf didn’t understand but said nothing.\n\n“Adolf Hitler,” Hemingway said, “Old Mother England’s wittiest bastard child, Chuck Chaplin.”\n\nThey shook hands.\n\n“Fresh from the train?” Chuck asked in perfect German.\n\nAdolf nodded. “Yes. This morning.”\n\n“Looking for work here? It’ll be hard. You’re not Jewish are you?”\n\n“No, not Jewish. I’m a painter.”\n\nChuck nodded. “Are you any good?”\n\nHitler smiled. “My English is better than my painting.”\n\nThe pianist returned the smile. “And your English is atrocious.”\n\n“Your German is quite good.”\n\nChuck grinned. “Benefit of an English education.”\n\nErnie looked perplexed, trying to follow the rush of German in his drunken state. “What are you two going on about?”\n\nChuck turned to Ernie. “Drink your beer, you silly sod.” Then, back to Adolf in German: “Do you have a place to stay yet?”\n\nAdolf shook his head. “I was going to ask after a boarding house or hotel.”\n\n“Nonsense,” Chuck said, switching to English. “You can stay with us. At least until you find something more suitable.”\n\nAdolf looked around again, suddenly unsure what to do. He lowered his voice. “I’m not a homosexual,” he said in a quiet voice, nodding towards Ernie. “Tell him for me? In English?”\n\n“What’s he saying?” Ernie asked.\n\n“That he admires your mustache and the light in your eyes,” Chuck answered. “Particularly the way you dimple when you smile.”\n\n“Bloody British fairy,” Hemingway muttered into his beer.\n\n“That’s not,” Chuck said slowly and deadpan, “what your mother said to me last night.”\n\nPerhaps, Adolf thought, Paris was a mistake after all.\n\nVery little is known of his life before the Revolution. The records and recollections of those who might have known were lost in the heavy fire-bombings during the final days of the War for Democratic Change. And the man himself rarely offered up a personal detail, despite having given over five thousand documented speeches over the span of his life. In an early American lecture, he casually mentioned coming to Paris to be a painter. In a spontaneous speech at his son’s wedding, he fondly recalled a kiss in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe. We may never know more than these scattered references. But would knowing matter? Or would it merely add to the legend of this great but humble man?\n\nNicholas Freeman, Editor\n\nPreface, A Kiss in the Shadow: Essays on The Pre-1942 Life of Adolf Hitler, Harbor Light Press, Seattle, 1986\n\nBy day Hitler wandered the city with his easel and stool and pallet and canvas. At night, he sang and drank with his new friends down at de Gaulle’s. He never did move out. He slept on a cot in the corner of their large loft and tapped into what little remained of his inheritance to help with expenses. Ernie and Chuck took him under their wing, showing him around the city and helping him with his English.\n\nThe economy was struggling as a massive influx of Jewish refugees fled the Russian Civil War. The Empire was already stretched thin with footholds in Africa and Indonesia. There were quiet rumors that Napoleon IV was gradually losing his grip on sanity as he entered his eighties and even quieter rumors that his military advisors and generals had plans of their own.\n\nStill, the summer was hot and bright and one afternoon in July, Adolf looked up from painting the Arc de Triomphe and locked eyes with the girl who had kissed him there over a month earlier. She was staring at him, a slight smile pulling at her mouth.\n\nHe licked his brush and tried to resume work, suddenly uncomfortable with her wide, dark eyes. She took a step closer.\n\n“You’re no good at it,” she said to him in heavily accented French. “You’ve gotten the colors all wrong.”\n\nHe shrugged, feeling a stab of annoyance though her voice was playful. “It’s how I see it.”\n\n“Perhaps you need spectacles,” she said, taking another step closer.\n\nAdolf chuckled. “And this from a girl who kisses men old enough to be her grandfather?”\n\n“You don’t look so old,” she said.\n\n“Perhaps you are the one who needs spectacles?” He looked at her. She was tall, slender, with long arms and legs. Her breasts were small but high on her chest.\n\n“How old are you?” she asked. When he didn’t answer right away, she grinned. “I’m nineteen.”\n\n“I’m . . . old.” He set down his brush.\n\nShe laughed; it sounded like gypsy music to him. Then she repeated herself. “You don’t look so old.”\n\nHe nodded.\n\nShe stretched out her hand. “I’m Tesia.”\n\nHe took it, uncertain what to do with it. Finally, he raised it to his mouth and kissed it lightly. “Adolf.”\n\n“German?”\n\n“Yes. You?”\n\n“Polish.”\n\n“We’re neighbors then,” he said, not knowing what else to say.\n\nShe smiled. Her teeth were straight and white. “Yes.” She pointed at the bench near his stool. “May I sit and watch?”\n\n“May I paint you?”\n\nShe laughed again. “I couldn’t let you. You’d get the colors all wrong and I’d be cross with you.” She caught her breath. “I wouldn’t want to be cross with you.”\n\nHe snorted and went back to work. She was right, he realized. He could never paint her.\n\nHe painted quietly and she watched in silence. When it grew dark, he asked her if she wanted to have dinner with him and she said yes. He packed up his supplies and tossed his canvas into a nearby waste-bin.\n\n“Why do you do that?” she asked.\n\n“Like you said: I’m no good.” He shrugged. “Sometimes I use them to keep me warm at night. They burn well.”\n\n“Ridiculous.” She dug the unfinished painting from the garbage. “I like it.” She tucked it under her arm.\n\nThey walked to a small cafe that overlooked the Seine. He went in first as she paused at the door. From inside, the smell of roasted rabbit, baking bread and fresh sliced onions drifted out. The waiter frowned when he saw them.\n\n“No,” he said.\n\n“Pardon?”\n\nHe pointed to a newly painted sign near the door. “No Jews.”\n\nAdolf felt a stab of anger. It passed quickly. “Monsieur,” he said in careful French, “I’m not Jewish.”\n\n“Not you,” the waiter said, pointing at the girl. “Her.”\n\nAdolf looked. She blanched, her eyes a bit wide and her nostrils flaring. She clenched her jaw. He saw the band on her arm now. He hadn’t noticed it before but why would he? He’d heard about the new laws but they had seemed far away to him. He shook his head in disbelief. “You are making a mistake.”\n\nThe waiter said something under his breath that Adolf couldn’t quite understand. He opened his mouth to protest but felt a firm hand on his arm.\n\n“We’ll go somewhere else,” Tesia said.\n\nThey had a quiet dinner by moonlight. She stole two apples from a cart. He bought bread and cheese. After eating, she kissed him again, this time more slowly.\n\nHe pulled away. “I’m too old.”\n\n“Nonsense,” she said and kissed him again.\n\nAfterwards, he asked her, “Why did you kiss me that day when you first saw me?”\n\n“Because,” she said, “you were beautiful and you stood alone.”\n\nHe walked her home. Twice, as blue-coat soldiers passed them on the street, she pressed herself closer to him, concealing the band on her arm.\n\n“Why don’t you take it off?” he asked her.\n\n“I don’t know,” she said, standing on the doorstep of a run-down hotel. Inside, he could hear loud voices conversing in Polish and Yiddish and Russian. “It’s against the law, I suppose.”\n\n“It’s a silly law.”\n\n“Most laws are.” She smiled, kissed him quickly and fled inside.\n\nWhistling a love song he dimly remembered from his youth, Adolf made his way back to de Gaulle’s and his waiting friends.\n\nWhen he looked for her the next day and the next, she was nowhere to be found. When he returned to the old hotel, he found it somber and empty.\n\nJuly slipped into August.\n\nMy father never talked about the events leading up to the war. He simply smiled, waved his hand and said it was unimportant. After he died, I found a photograph in his belongings. He and two other men sitting at a table in some nameless bar raising their glasses to the camera. He was gaunt, bearded and hollow-eyed, dressed in a tattered Prussian coat. The back of the photograph reads Summer in Paris, Light from the Sky, scrawled in his pinched, careful German script and it seems to have been taken at night, possibly in 1941, the year he met my mother. His companions, their connection to my father and their present whereabouts are unknown.\n\nJacob Ernest Hitler\n\nMemories of My Father: An Introduction to the 50th Anniversary Edition of Unser Kampf, Penguin Books, New York, 1992\n\nThe explosion was all anyone could talk about.\n\nOn August twelfth a blast ripped through Notre Dame Cathedral as Napoleon IV knelt to receive Mass from his archbishop. Fourteen people were killed, including the Emperor and his young wife. Photographs of the bombers, arrested later that night, filled the newspapers. Four frightened Jewish youth. Hanging them, the generals now in command claimed, would not even scratch the surface of the conspiracy that threatened the Empire. Still, they hanged them quickly.\n\nHemingway threw down the newspaper in disgust. “Those sons of bitches,” he muttered.\n\nChuck and Adolf looked up at him.\n\nErnie kicked the paper. “Do you believe this?”\n\nHe’d been drinking most of the day. At least once, they’d taken his pistol away as he waved it about. There were more soldiers in the streets these days and though the patrons of de Gaulle’s little tavern thought their American mascot eccentric, the blue-coats might not be so inclined.\n\nChuck shrugged. “Name of the game, my friend.”\n\n“It’s a goddamn travesty,” Ernie went on. “They killed their own goddamn Emperor and then they blamed the Jews.”\n\n“It’s just four,” Adolf said.\n\nErnie pulled back one fist, reaching for his pistol with the other. “Four? It’s not just four. Don’t you see it coming? There will be more laws. It’s a shell game, Adolf. They will whip up the people and keep them focused on their chosen scapegoat. They will move the Jews now to a separate place for their own good, to protect them from the angry mobs that they themselves have created. When the dust settles, there will be a lot of dead Jews and a new Emperor who is not a Bonaparte.” He pointed to the picture of a French general in the newspaper. “Behold your new Emperor.”\n\nPeople were listening. They looked uncomfortable. Chuck lowered his voice. “That’s enough, Ernie. You’re making a scene.”\n\nErnie jumped up, his chair tumbling backwards. “Someone sure as Christ needs to. What you people need is a revolution.”\n\nAdolf caught his sleeve. “Sit down, my friend.”\n\nErnie looked around as if suddenly coming to his senses. He sat.\n\nChuck laughed. “You and your revolutions.”\n\n“It worked for us, didn’t it?”\n\n“If it worked so well,” Chuck said, “why are you here?”\n\nErnie stole Adolf’s beer. “Because I’m an American. I’m free to come and go as I please.”\n\nAdolf remembered stories about the American Revolution. He’d studied it in school, though his textbooks said little. No one really believed that the young nation of upstarts would live beyond its cradle. But Lincoln averted civil war over slavery and assisted the Canadians in gaining their own independence. Naturally, the grateful northerners joined the Union. And shortly after, the Spanish-American conflict left the United States with an entire continent under its sway.\n\n“A revolution would never work here,” he told Ernie.\n\nChuck agreed. “He’s right. The army’s far too strong.”\n\n“Ah, but words are stronger,” Hemingway said.\n\nAdolf leaned forward. “Words? Against rifles?”\n\nErnie waved for another round. Suddenly, his eyes glinted with an almost savage intelligence. “Listen,” he said. “I’ll tell you just how I’d do it.” The beer arrived, de Gaulle looking pained when Ernie waved the ticket away. “Later, mon ami. That’s a promise.” He looked around to make sure no one was listening. “First,” he said, “I’d write a book.”\n\nChuck laughed. “But you’re a terrible writer. Your words stumble about on the page like drunken soldiers in women’s shoes.” He paused for dramatic effect. “And those were just your grocery lists.”\n\nErnie pointed, eyebrows narrowed in a mock scowl. “You’re quite the bloody comedian.”\n\nAdolf chuckled at his friends. “So you’d write a book?”\n\nErnie nodded. “Yes. A book about all of the horse-shit here. A book so passionate, so full of raw rage and sorrow that people’d sit up and take notice.”\n\n“And that would bring about a revolution?”\n\n“In time it would. Yes.”\n\n“Nonsense,” Chuck said. “Who’d read it? The Jews? The gypsies? The Marxist refugees? They don’t have pots to piss in or blankets to sleep in. It’d do them more good on the fire, keeping them warm.”\n\n“Not the Jews,” Ernie said. “The Americans.”\n\nAdolf sat up. “The Americans?”\n\n“Naturally. You’d have to get them involved. First, with the book. Then with speeches. Maybe even a traveling troupe of the persecuted and oppressed. They’d eat it up for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And they’ve got the resources. Strong army. Strong navy. Airships.”\n\nAdolf swallowed. “Why ever would they be interested in a Frankish Revolution?”\n\n“Two reasons,” Ernie said, holding up two fingers. “One: A democratic foothold in Europe. Two: The liberation of the Jews.”\n\n“The Jews?” Adolf asked.\n\n“Freedom for every race, color, creed,” Chuck said in German. “You saw what they did with their emancipated Africans. Liberia’s doing quite well; shining that blessed light of liberty for all of Africa to see.”\n\nAdolf leaned in. “But most Americans are Christian, aren’t they?”\n\n“They are indeed,” Ernie said with a grin.\n\n“And?” Chuck asked.\n\n“Jesus Christ was Jewish,” Ernie said. “It’s all a matter of perspective.” He raised his glass. “To democracy,” he said.\n\nThey raised their glasses, too. A boy who sold photographs to tourists pointed his camera at them and raised his eyebrows. Ernie winked at him.\n\nA bulb flashed. A shutter snapped.\n\nThe next night, Adolf gladly handed over a handful of coins for the photograph and tacked it up on the dressing mirror in their loft.\n\nHe never considered himself to be a great man but an adequate man. He never considered himself to have made history but rather to have been in the right place and the right time to do his small part. Well-spoken but shy, intelligent but unassuming, he caught the public off guard with his dry wit, his careful words and his passionate commitment to human rights. For this reason, it is said that only Hitler could go to America.\n\nDr. John F. Kennedy\n\nOut of the Ashes: A History of Modern Thought from the French Revolution for Democratic Change to the Re-Birth of the Nation of Israel, 1941 - 1952, Harvard University Press, Boston, 1971.\n\nThroughout August, he kept an eye open for Tesia but Adolf was convinced he’d never see her again. She was a smart girl, he told himself. Smart enough to see the stirred pot start to boil. As badly as he wished to see her, he hoped he would not because that would mean she hadn’t left this dangerous place.\n\nThere were more soldiers now and more laws. More signs in shop windows. Rumors flew of outlying rural churches desecrated by Jews. The local synagogue was burned to the ground by angry citizens while the police and soldiers stood by.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking,” Adolf told Chuck one afternoon as they walked to de Gaulle’s. They spoke in exclusively in English now; Adolf had gotten quite good at it.\n\nChuck kicked an empty can. “It is. Man’s inhumanity to man, I think they call it.”\n\nAdolf stopped. “I think Ernie was right.”\n\nChuck laughed and stopped, too. “About the book?”\n\n“Maybe. About the Revolution. About the Americans.”\n\n“Perhaps,” Chuck said, resuming his brisk pace. “But I don’t think it will happen.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\nHe clapped Adolf on the shoulder. “Who’s going to do it? Are you going to do it?”\n\n“Of course not.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\nAdolf opened his mouth. He started to say because I’m not a Jew and the realization of it twisted his heart in his chest. “It’s not my line of work.”\n\n“Exactly,” Chuck said. “This sort of work requires more than just a willing body.”\n\n“More?”\n\nChuck’s hands moved as he talked. “Joan of Arc, King Arthur, Moses. What did they have?”\n\nAdolf thought about it for a moment. “I don’t know.”\n\n“God,” Chuck said. “They had the voice of God, the vision of the grail, a light from Heaven. A power they could point to over their shoulder.”\n\n“A light from Heaven?”\n\nChuck pointed up. “Licht vom Himmel.”\n\nAdolf nodded. They stood outside de Gaulle’s now, waiting to go in. He smiled at his friend. “And when they have that?”\n\n“One spark to start the fire,” Chuck said.\n\nThey walked in. Ernie waved them to their table. He was remarkably sober for the time of day. He grinned. “You’re becoming popular, Adolf.”\n\nAdolf raised his eyebrows. “Yes?”\n\nErnie nodded towards the bar. “De Gaulle said a girl was in looking for you earlier. Said she’d be back later.”\n\nHe coughed as a shudder passed over him. “Did he mention her name?”\n\n“Foreign girl. Dark.” He lowered his voice. “He thought she was Jewish; I assured him she was not.”\n\nAdolf took the meaning from his words and nodded. “Thank you.”\n\nHe shrugged. “She’s more trouble than you need, friend. These are bad times for love.”\n\n“I don’t love her,” Adolf said. “I hardly know her. And she’s just a girl.”\n\nErnie patted his hand. “That’s what they all say.” He opened his mouth to continue but the sudden opening and closing of the front door stopped him. A young man stood panting in the doorway and the room went quiet.\n\n“They’re relocating the Jews tonight,” he said. “Outside of the city. For their own protection, they said.”\n\n“Who said?” de Gaulle asked.\n\n“I heard it from a soldier. They’re lined up along the Champs Elysées. Blue-coats for block upon block. They’ve even called up the reserves.”\n\nErnie looked at Adolf. “For their own protection,” he said quietly.\n\nOutside, the shouting started. Whistles blowing, sirens wailing. Adolf hung his head. “They’ll go, won’t they? They won’t fight back.”\n\n“They might,” Chuck said. “But after a few of them are killed, they’ll stop. They’ll go like sheep and hope the butcher is a shepherd.”\n\nAdolf rubbed his eyes, disbelief gnawing at his stomach. “What do we do?”\n\nErnie looked up, his face pale. “We wait here for it to be done. Then we leave Paris.”\n\nThe bartender dimmed the lights. He passed around shot glasses and bottles. The handful of men drank themselves drunk and fell asleep at their tables.\n\nIn a whisky fog, Hitler dreamed of another life, another time. A dark time, a time when a caricature of himself strutted about in uniform, barking out orders and gazing with pride upon a broken cross. And other men in uniform, men who saw the light from the sky spreading out behind Adolf like a halo, raised their hands to him and cried “Heil.” And on the hands that they raised, blood shone out in that awful light. Blood of the martyrs, blood of the ages, and Adolf looked down at his own hands and saw that they were bloody, too, and he reached back to find some of his father’s faith and compassion but found that in that life, in that world, there was nothing but rage and hatred to reach for.\n\nHitler wept.\n\nHe woke to screaming and leaped to his feet.\n\nErnie mumbled; Chuck stirred.\n\nHe heard the screaming again, distant from the alley behind the tavern. Either the others were too drunk to notice or too drunk to care. He moved quickly to the back door and stepped out into the night.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nThe screaming stopped. Instead, he heard muffled, muted sound. He followed it.\n\nBehind a pile of crates he saw two large forms crouched on the ground over a smaller bundle that bucked and twisted. As he drew closer, he realized they were two soldiers and a girl. One blue-coat held the girl down, a razor at her throat and a hand over her mouth. The other had pried her legs apart, his own trousers pushed down to his knees as he raped her.\n\n“Wasn’t enough to kill our Lord,” one of the soldiers hissed. “You had to kill our Emperor, too, Jew-bitch.”\n\nAdolf stopped. His heart fell into a hole somewhere inside him. His stomach followed after. His eyes locked with the girl’s and suddenly she stopped struggling.\n\nShe’s waiting for me to save her, Adolf thought. He couldn’t move. He stood transfixed while powerlessness and shame washed over him. Tesia lay still and the soldier thrust twice more before looking up.\n\n“You there,” he said. “You this girl’s father?”\n\nAdolf cleared his voice. “No.”\n\n“Then mind your business. You can come back for your turn later.”\n\nSomething snapped like a guitar string in his spine. Adolf turned and fled for de Gaulle’s, his feet pounding the cobblestones. Behind him, he heard Tesia struggling again, trying to scream but unable to do more than moan. He ran into the tavern, kicking over chairs and tables as he went, until he reached his own. He stood panting, sobbing over his friends, then bent over Ernie to frisk him.\n\nErnie stirred. “What the hell—”\n\nAdolf found the revolver, yanked it from the pocket, and wordlessly stalked out of the tavern. Each step steady, deliberate, until he saw the soldiers. Until he saw Tesia beneath them. Then he stopped and looked down at them.\n\nA blue-coat looked up. “I thought I told you—”\n\nThe pistol didn’t roar or buck like at the cinema. It popped and shimmied just a bit and he thumbed the hammer and pulled the trigger again to be sure it had really worked though the soldier was already falling sideways, his mouth working like a landed trout.\n\nThe other soldier let go of Tesia and scrambled backwards on his heels and hands, fear white on his face. The revolver popped again once and he thrashed away, popped twice and he rolled over with a sigh.\n\nAdolf, still clutching the pistol, dropped heavily to his knees. Tesia lay still, her dress and blouse ripped, her eyes closed. He reached for her, pulled her to himself and she fought him, kicking and flailing and growling low in her throat. He released her for a moment, then tried again. This time, she let him pull her in and he cradled her, rocking back and forth. He had no idea what to say so he said nothing and let that silence sweep him aside like a giant hand. After a few minutes, shouts from over rooftops brought him back from that quiet place he’d gone to.\n\nHe shook her gently. “Tesia, we have to go.”\n\nHe stood, pulling her up and keeping her close. The revolver dangled in his hand and he looked again at his handiwork. The two soldiers were dead now or soon would be. They lay sprawled like cast away dolls. The realization of what he’d done struck him. Blood on his hands.\n\nHanging on to her, he bent as far away as he could and threw up on the ground. When he ran the back of his hand over his mouth he smelled whisky and cordite.\n\nHe heard a quiet cough and looked up. Ernie, Chuck and a few others from the tavern stood there watching him.\n\nChuck looked at the bodies and then the girl. “Adolf, what have you done?”\n\nErnie stepped forward, snatching the pistol from his hand. He tucked it into his waistband. “I think he did the right thing, Chuck. This is where it starts.”\n\nOne spark, Adolf thought.\n\nWere he alive today, he would say himself that this monument is not about one man’s struggle but about the struggle of many. Our struggle, as he put it so well. From 1942 to 1952—when the charter was finally signed—he struggled alongside us, raising support and awareness for our cause, never asking for anything for himself. With his wife and his children often by his side, he went from city to city speaking in any venue that would listen. And though originally published in his native German, his book was a shot heard ’round the world, translated into over forty languages within its first five years in print. I heard him speak shortly before his death: “Well-aimed words will always be more powerful than rifles,” he said. And his words roused a slumbering giant, turning its head towards cruelty and oppression, towards a cry for freedom in a far away land.\n\nRabbi Benjamin Levin\n\nDedication Speech, Hitler Memorial, Jerusalem, Israel, 1992.\n\nThey told Adolf to take her to the loft and wait for morning. De Gaulle had a nephew who was driving to Calais the next day; they’d hide Hitler and the girl in the back of the truck and hope for the best. He ripped off Tesia’s armband and tossed it away.\n\n“Listen to me,” he told her. “You are not Jewish. You are my daughter, Klara, and you are ill. We are looking for the hospital. We left your papers at home by mistake. Do you understand me?”\n\nShe nodded. Her eyes were red and she limped now, but she stood on her own.\n\n“Good.” They set out at a brisk walk. More shouting and sirens punctuated the night, suddenly joined now by occasional gunshots.\n\nAlong the way they saw soldiers running. They saw groups of men and women, some now fighting back. People called news to one another from their opened windows. Two soldiers had been killed raping a girl, someone cried. A band of drunks was storming the police station looking for guns, another shouted. Adolf heard it as if it were far away and kept pushing them towards safety, towards home.\n\nHe locked them inside. He took down half a bottle of schnapps from the cupboard and poured two drinks with shaking hands. Tesia did not speak and did not meet his eyes. He knew she was still in shock, the color drained away from her skin and her face slack. He tucked her into his cot, wrapping his great coat over her and when he pulled away, she clutched at him and mumbled something.\n\nHe bent in closer and heard the words. “You were beautiful,” she said, “and you stood alone.”\n\nHe held her as sobs racked his body. The world had never seemed so grim and despairing and he wondered if it had always been that way, if he’d just never seen it before. He felt the broken girl in his arms, felt her breath against his neck and smelled the sweat and dirt on her. Behind him, in the window, something like Heaven’s light grew beyond his wildest imaginings, filling that cavity in the world’s soul. His tears subsided; Tesia slept.\n\nAfter an hour of holding her, he left her side to pack his things. He’d leave his paints, his pallet, his brushes. He knew he’d never use them again. But he did pack his suitcase with clothing, bedding and canned food. He also checked his papers and counted his money. Somewhere, he could buy her the papers she would need.\n\nOn a scrap of paper, Ernie had hastily scribbled a name and an address—a friend of a friend at the U.S. Embassy in London. Ernie had pressed it into his hand before leaving with Chuck and the others to storm the police station and start their Revolution for Democratic Change.\n\n“Viva la France,” they had said as they went racing down the cobblestones.\n\nAdolf took down their photograph from the mirror. He looked at it and smiled at his friends.\n\nIf I’m to be a writer, he thought, I should write something about this place, this time. Something so I will never forget.\n\nHe found a pen, turned the photo over, and after a moment’s thought, wrote on the back of it in his pinched, careful, German script: Summer in Paris, Light from Heaven.\n\nHitler weighed the pen carefully in his hand and wondered if one man could make a difference. He weighed his destiny carefully in his heart and wondered if the Americans would listen.\n\nThe reindeer were stoned. Flat Nan, Ken, Ro, some other girls and boy who’d just discovered sex and I were chasing mammoths off the summer range so the horses could eat in peace and so we’d have some hazel nuts left for the winter. We didn’t hunt mammoths until snow fell which made tracking them like following a herd of Buicks. Mammoths always looked surprised when we found them so I don’t think they were that smart.\n\nCenturies later, I was at a loft party in New York City, having gone back to see how some people I’d met in 2001 had gotten that way. It was easy to wrangle invitations to parties in the early 1970s if you were a presentable boy, and I’ve always been a presentable boy. The loft was full of painters with real gallery shows, of famous painters’ future, present, and ex wives and boyfriends, of the kinds of people who showed up to be at a party with famous painters, poets, and the various entertainments people who threw loft parties had to offer. Dancers danced. Painters chatted up art critics. Poetry professors chatted up graduate students past, present, and future. And I felt both in place and out of place, remembering parties in places that must have been Rome that felt like this, or which could have been provincial capitals pretending to be as vicious as Rome. Clothes change; bodies and poses don’t. I was maneuvering for the drinks table when someone said, “If you want to try acid, the punch is spiked.”\n\nIf I was going to get drunk, I was going to be pinned down in time for the duration anyway, just like being sleep, so I might as well try something new. To lock me to the party time, I drank two big glasses of white wine, which was the screw-neck bottled cheap Chablis available at all bohemian party those years. Then I took a drink of the punch. I’d heard about acid, like rye fungus without the fingers dropping off, and I was feeling reckless, which happens when you spend a couple of centuries being really cautious after seeing a lover hanged, and your caution starts to recoil. Stonewall marked the change; New York was full of possibilities those days. The revolution hadn’t quite faded.\n\nEven before the acid hit, I’d spotted a couple of guys who liked what they saw. And saw one man who’d lost his old lover and who would lose his young lover to AIDS, but this isn’t that kind of story, so we’ve got to move on.\n\nI knew not to spend too much time with the people who’d wonder why I didn’t recognize them in 2001, so I found a couple of people who I knew would have moved away by then, two women, one also tripping and sitting in a chair while people worried about her which amused her, another one curled up on a sofa talking to someone who wasn’t ever going to be famous. Just when I was wondering if the punch had really been spiked, I remembered . . .\n\nThe reindeer were stoned. I had a vivid dream while awake, of reindeer eating mushrooms, the ones we’d been told were poisonous to average people, and wandering around, bumping into trees, goosing each other with their antlers, eating the mushrooms, and jumping into the air.\n\nI was carrying a small pack with flint, fire stone, tinder mushrooms, and some dried meat, and I had a spear and throwing stick with me, but these reindeer were acting so silly, I didn’t have the heart to kill one. The boy we’d traded a sister for said, “They get drunk eating the mushrooms. If you drink their piss, you’ll see visions and can fly and talk to them.”\n\n“How do you get their piss?” asked Flat Nan, ever practical except when she was trying to get someone to sleep with her despite not having much in the way of breasts.\n\n“Walk right up to them and ask,” the boy said. He walked right up to one of the reindeer and blew it.\n\nI had Ro for that. Ro looked back at me, obviously thinking the same thing. Neither of us wanted to eat the mushrooms or the yellow snow.\n\nAl, who was always his alpha daddy’s son, stabbed one of the reindeer and cut out the bladder and began chasing the girls and squirting the piss into them. I walked over to one of the reindeer and asked it to piss in my lamp. Oddly enough it did. The piss tasted nasty, but I gulped it down and stood there. The reindeer looked at me. I looked at the reindeer.\n\nAnd back in New York, I was telling someone, “Mushrooms, man, they will get you fucked up almost as good as acid.”\n\n“Mushrooms will make you sick,” the girl said.\n\n“Not if you filter them through reindeers,” I said.\n\n“And you’re going to get reindeers where in New York?” she replied.\n\nAnd after the drugs took hold, the reindeer and I started chatting, and I started telling someone the story, but in the old language, so he led me into a back bedroom and asked, “Do you have any friends here?”\n\n“The girl in the swing,” I managed to get out in English. “The chair swing.”\n\nHe led me back out and put me at her feet. I kept telling the story as I saw it unfolding in my awake dream, but I don’t remember if I managed to get the story all the way up to English or not and I was careful to whisper so I didn’t bother anyone. One girl started crying over in another time, um, place in the party and someone pushed her out in the hall. These were a tough drug people, not as friendly as the reindeer. It was important not to bother anyone.\n\nI put my arm on the reindeer’s shoulder and said, “Why do you want to get stoned? I’m never going to do this again.” Back in New York, I laughed.\n\nThe reindeer said, “Look, we’re prey animals. We’re too smart to forget that we’re prey animals, but it’s a pain to be always knowing that you’re a prey animal and that everything from lions to dogs to you to eagles wants to kill and eat you or your children. So, since we can’t dumbly forget like the horses who hang around you despite you eating one or two of them every so often, we pig out on mushrooms from time to time. So, kill me already.”\n\n“I can’t kill you. I’m talking to you.”\n\n“That’s the drug talking,” the reindeer said.\n\nI started crying and checked back with my body in New York to make sure I wasn’t crying there. Nope, so back to the reindeer. “So what I’m imagining you saying is just the drug making me think what you’re telling me isn’t what you’d really be thinking?”\n\n“I’m sorry,” the reindeer said. “I’m just not used to sentences that twist and curl back on themselves like that.”\n\n“That’s okay,” I said. “What I meant to ask was isn’t the drug giving me special insights, like magic, into your thinking?”\n\n“Hey, man, don’t try to make my trip your trip,” the reindeer said. “I’m sure your elders and all those kids over there are going to have some magical explanation for all of this, but I’m a reindeer and we don’t do metaphysics. We just fly around after we eat mushrooms and we giggle.”\n\n“You’re saying just enjoy it?”\n\nThe reindeer sighed and tried to shrug his arm off his shoulder. I didn’t shrug off. “Look at you. You’ve killed off the giant deer. You’re killing off the mammoths. We’re not doing real well, either, despite being able to sneak a whole lot better than mammoths. You’ll probably eat us out of here. And you want to have me prep your drugs for you.”\n\n“But we love you. We eat you to assimilate your virtues.”\n\n“You know that most of what you people painted in your caves is extinct now.”\n\nThis jolted me back to the loft party. I remembered the reindeer being stoned, but the acid was probably giving me a mental remix of what really happened. But then my life is often like that, first the ending, then the beginning, and then the parallel that happened earlier than the incident it was paralleling.\n\nVel paused, holding an old stone oil lamp in his hands. He sniffed it as though something should have remained of the urine. “Nothing but dust now,” he said to Quince. “Should I go into details about the sex or not?”\n\n“More just the blow by blow,” Quince said. “You can skip some of the details when you describe your encounters.”\n\nI felt confused about what I was doing at this party and remembered the first time I’d stepped into a Seeing. I’d been around 16 or 17. What I’d seen was a bunch of guys wearing towels and having sex. Looked like loincloths to me, so I jumped right in, totally unable to speak any language in the scene, unaware that this was centuries in my future, thinking it was somewhere else in the Paleolithic. I laughed in the loft, thinking that I was probably now close to the time when I’d first jumped. I just thought they had really better lamps somewhere else in the Paleolithic. So, I turned to the hallucinating and hallucinated reindeer in that vivid half dream and said, “I remember you. I haven’t remembered you in thousands of years, but I must have dreamed about you to remember this now.”\n\nThe reindeer looked at me and said, “I’m long since dead. My descendents are now working for the Sami in Norway and dragging children around on sleds in upstate New York.”\n\nI tried to fish though my memories for the real story, the original drinking of reindeer piss. The reindeer said, “You know you’re not going to find all of it. You haven’t remembered all of it in so long those brain cells have been recycled and recycled again. You remember better the things you understood at the time, but only if they were really different from day to day life. Big pains. But big joys, too.”\n\n“That’s not fair,” I said. “What’s the point in living a very long time if you can’t remember everything.”\n\n“Even I, who you’re going to eat when you catch me next, don’t remember everything. I suspect I won’t remember anything of this conversation,” the reindeer said. “Now will you shut up and let me enjoy my mushrooms.”\n\n“Sorry,” I said. I turned my attention to the party and found someone really cute to go chase. We went into the bathroom that wasn’t full of people doing lines of coke.\n\nUnder the light, he saw just how drugged I was and how young I looked. “You’re balls out tripping. I can’t take advantage of you like this.”\n\nMy frustration levels were about to pop my zipper. “I want you to take advantage of me,” I said in the voice of the reindeer.\n\nHe said, “I’ll blow you. Just don’t follow me home like a puppy, okay.” He wasn’t the best of lovers, but I didn’t need the best of lovers with my imagination burning acid. The reindeer stuck his nose against my asshole and licked my taint from asshole to balls, and I just exploded.\n\nThe guy looked at me and took a warm towel and began cleaning up and the reindeer was giving me head and I came again. “Oh, to be young again and be able to endlessly come. I think that should enough,” the man said. “And other people need to use this bathroom.”\n\nI hopped up on the sink and waved my legs at him. “Come on, already,” he said. He zipped up my jeans as I was starting to shrug myself out of them.\n\n“Listen to him,” the reindeer said from the scene inside my mind. “You’ll be embarrassed later.”\n\n“I can give you a blow job you’ll never forget,” I said.\n\n“My dear, I don’t stick my cock in the mouths of people who are tripping their heads off.”\n\nOuch, that hurt. I curled up like a snail, and the man pulled me off the counter and sat me down by the woman in the swing chair who was grinning wickedly at someone who’d come by to make sure she was okay.\n\nBack in the half imaginary, half real past, the reindeer and I were sobering up. We hadn’t been talking for a couple of hours, just wandering about with my arm resting on his back, him being about waist high to me. He rolled his eyes back at me as though he’d just realized he’d been walking around with a human hanging on to him for hours.\n\nMost of the dogs had gone off once they realized we weren’t going to help them and we were acting as crazy as the deer. One came back and sat down, looking eager. My reindeer friend thrashed his rack against my hand and took off running, the dog chasing him. I washed out my lamp and pissed. A reindeer crept up, weirdly cringing like a dog, and lapped up my piss. The other humans looked wrecked. I supposed that I looked wrecked, too.\n\nI got a cab home from the party, with two other people, including the woman from the wicker chair, and went back to the Chelsea, different room this time, and lay down on the bed, not quite coming down yet, but aware, as I had been aware 14,000 years ago, that what I’d done was take a neurotoxin and semi-poison myself, and that if this worked like alcohol, I couldn’t step out of this time until I was completely sober. But then I remembered I’d had two glasses of white wine before all this started. And I had wanted to follow home the guy who’d blown me, just like a puppy, but knew that was the acid, too.\n\nWe built a fire back by the reindeer the foreign boy had killed and sat around eating it for a couple of days, fucking, the way kids did when they made a kill off away from the grown-ups. Flat Nan and one of the other girls skived the deer hide and we all stomped brains into it and folded it. I wondered if eating a stoned deer would make us stoned again, so went off to find another one and killed a fawn of the season, so we had two deer and lots of time to hang around being young humans with each other until the girls got pregnant again from all the good eating. Better with mammoths because you could slide and slip on all that flesh as you were dressing it out, but two deer in the fall before it got cold and snowy and mammoth season were nice.\n\nHard to hide what Ro and I were up to, and the het boys and girls were curious and we were all just still stoned enough to talk and demonstrate. I don’t know what the half-life of the mushroom drug is in reindeer flesh. The deer had bleed out and the liver and innards were foul from being left in the body after the foreign boy had cut the bladder out, so we probably weren’t getting the most psychoactive parts.\n\n“So, why don’t you use females to put your cock in?” Ken asked.\n\nRo said, “Just don’t. Females can’t know what it’s like to touch the pleasure thing in side.”\n\n“You have a pleasure thing inside your ass?”\n\n“Probably you do, too,” I said. “There’s one you can feel up the asshole.”\n\nKen looked like he didn’t believe us at all. He asked Ann, “Put your finger up there and see what you feel.”\n\nRo and I leaned into each other and watched while Ann put her finger up Ken’s butt. She wiggled around and Ken breathed out, “Okay, but she can do this for me.” Ann looked like she’d figured out a new way to wrap boys around her fingers.\n\nThe foreign boy said, “You can cut her a stick and make her a harness so she can fuck you.”\n\n“No,” Ken said. Ann was busy cleaning her finger with leaves. She went down to a branch and cleaned it more. “Okay, so it’s not just the one pushing his dick in who gets something from this.”\n\n“No, and we have hands,” I said. “We trade off being the girl.”\n\nAnn looked at us as though we’d said something impossible. “What about this sucking thing?”\n\nRo said, “You should be able to do this just as well as we can, but you need to look at it carefully and find the little raised ridge behind the cock skin.”\n\nI said, “Helps to wash good.”\n\nThe foreign boy said, “The guys who go for guy are good with their sister’s children.”\n\n“We know that,” Ken said. “That’s why we like having a few in the group.”\n\nRo and I looked at each other and smiled slightly. Ken was going to challenge his father’s uncle sometime really soon now.\n\nFlat Nan said, “Since I don’t have good breasts, could you find me sexy?”\n\nRo looked at her. “Possibly, Nan. I don’t think people should be frustrated. And women get smarter if they have children, I’ve heard.”\n\nI looked at Ro with some concern. “She’s got a slit, not a dick.”\n\n“I could try pretending I was with you.”\n\nNan started to cry. I wish I could give her tits or something so she could get laid without having to get my tenderhearted boy friend to have to try to satisfy her.\n\nFirst love. For all of us. Nan got someone to get her with child not long after that and grew a pair for nursing the child, so she wasn’t Flat Nan anymore. I suspected it was Ro, since he was capable of being really generous, especially when he could use his dick to make someone smile. We didn’t invent man-man sex, but I think he did invent penis puppetry.\n\nThe dogs got the hides away from us and ate them, and the deer’s guts and then ran home and hid in their own cave for a few days. Dogs hate drugs and scary things.\n\nThe grownups had taken a mammoth that refused to stop pestering the horses so nobody was really impressed with what was left of our two little reindeer. We all made some lamps and went hunting for tinder conk, those big fungus that grow on trees, so we could start getting things together for Bringing back the Sun, Winter Solstice.\n\nI love Winter Solstice, still, having the family around. Never get tired of it.\n\nBack in New York, I remembered all that, some of it again, some of it messed by the acid which framed understand what the first time was, even if the details were totally confused by what I knew about drugs in the late 1960s and early 70s. And I slept in and went running in Central Park and we were still before AIDS and after Stonewall. I called one of the poets who’d told me we’d met (in that one’s case, I had read enough about him so that I could fake it) and met him again for the first time at his reading at St. Marks Church.\n\nBut that’s another story.\n\nWe want to get back to the Paleolithic, at least some of us, and the last part of the Paleolithic wanted to get to our time. 30,000 years of chasing big game, less than that to get to atomic fission and high-speed computers. As long as the ice doesn’t come and scrape us off this island, we’ll be fine.\n\nQuince remembered playing with some of the things in the storeroom when she was a child and being scolded when her mother finally caught me wearing a 13,000-year-old necklace made of amber carved into wolf heads, restrung every couple of centuries.\n\nEven the time-bound can’t remember all the time.\n\nSean Williams calls Adelaide, Australia, his home. Living in the flat and dusty South Australian landscape, his fantasy novels, particularly the Books of the Cataclysm, strongly resonate with the landscape he calls home.\n\nI first became aware of Sean shortly after winning the Writers of The Future contest in 2000. Sean, a winner from years previous, had lived the sort of career I dreamed of having. And his books sat in my shelf of a bursting canon of Commonwealth writers from Scotland, Canada, and Australia that I felt forced new life into my favourite sub-genre: Space Opera. With co-author Shane Dix his Geodesica series really packed an intense amount of invention, world building, and adventure into some crazy fun reads.\n\nI’m not the only who digs on Sean’s work. He’s snagged the Ditmar and Aurealis awards several times. I caught up to him via email with a series of questions that, if only he didn’t live clear on the other side of the Earth from me, I would have loved to have asked him over a drink:\n\nYou live in South Australia, and seem to be part of a wave of Australian writers that are really building up and getting attention worldwide. Do you attribute that to any sort of zeitgeist? And what do you think living in that particular area brings to your work, or the work of your peers, that isn’t being done in other places?\n\nHarlan Ellison gave a talk to a bunch of people in Canberra back in the 1990s in which he described the scene then as a Golden Age of Australian speculative fiction. If it was gold then, I don’t know what it is now. Platinum, perhaps, or something even more precious. The scene has really exploded in the last decade, with so many new writers coming up the ranks and so many of us old pros selling overseas that it’s very difficult now to remember what it was like when I first started. Then, you could’ve counted the number of US sales on a couple of hands. Now, there are established writers like Sara Douglass, Greg Egan, Garth Nix, Trudi Canavan, and Lian Hearn continuing their already successful careers, with relatively new names like Karen Miller, Joel Shepherd and Justine Larbalestier bursting onto the world stage behind them. It’s a very exciting time, whatever you call it.\n\nThe issue of “Australianness” is a vexed one, one I’ve been pondering for many years, because it’s almost impossible to pin down, let alone identify the source. In my writing, particularly in my fantasy series, my personal background and experiences come forward through the landscape, which is very different from the Tolkienesque stage: no big mountains, no flowing rivers, no forests, no snow. I can’t write about these things with any kind of truth because I’ve never personally experienced them. Where I grew up, here in SA, there are no mountains, rivers, forests, or snow. It’s flat and old and dry and full of its own kind of magic. That’s what I try to capture in my novels; that’s where my heart lies.\n\nIt used to bother me that other Australian fantasy writers don’t often use this landscape too. I used to think that it was a kind o post-colonial betrayal of our heritage. Now I know that my version of Australia is different from that experienced by most Australians. Most Australians live on the continent’s East coast, where there are mountains, rivers, forests and snow, and their version of Australia is just as valid as mine. The Outback is just one part of a very large continent, and it’s one a lot of people here never experience.\n\nFollowing up on the question about your location, do you find it tough to reach readers in the US?\n\nMost of my books seem to reach them, which is great. Certainly the science fiction has no problem with the tyranny of distance. In fact, my agent first took me on because the book I had shopped to him read like it had been written by an American (I took that as a compliment <g>). The fantasy is trickier. The Books of the Change, my YA fantasy series that is particularly steeped in Australianness, never sold in the US, and I wonder sometimes if that’s because of a certain nervousness about the setting. I don’t know. It puzzles me, but I don’t lose any sleep over it any more.\n\nOr do you mean physically reaching readers in the US? That is a concern. I’d love to come across more often, to cons or to do signings, but the length of the trip is starting to weigh on me as I get older. Coming across once a year for the Writers of the Future contest celebrations and sticking around for WorldCon if it’s nearby is about all I can manage at the moment. It’s nothing personal, honest. 🙂\n\nIn your Books of the Cataclysm series, you seem to be trying to create your own religion, but one that is based on a synthesis of myths, legends, and religious beliefs from around the world. It’s as if all our religions were looking into a small portion of a larger room, and you’re stitching it together for great effect. Did you plan this out before writing your novels, or did it come organically as you wrote?\n\nI spent a very long time working on the religious background to the Books of the Cataclysm. Really, it started when my father chose to become a priest during my early high school years. I witnessed the study he undertook from the sidelines, and became fascinated with the idea of faded myths—stories (such as Noah’s Ark) that one culture appropriates from another and adopts as their own. Once it occurred to me that all religion can be viewed as a bunch of great stories that people take entirely too seriously, it was just a short hop sideways to the atheist I remain today—one who denies the existence of both deities and the afterlife but is endlessly fascinated with other people’s fascination with the same.\n\nIn constructing the world of the Cataclysm, I asked myself two questions. The first was: what kind of religion could I buy into, if I had to? The second begins with the thought that, if there really is some truth to one religion, maybe there’s some truth to all of them but none of them get it entirely right. If that’s the case, what is the bigger picture everyone isn’t quite seeing? What’s the elephant the three blind men keep misidentifying?\n\nYears of reading about religion encouraged me to keep several aspects: reincarnation, for instance, and also the idea of an afterlife. So my made-up religion has a cycle of life that takes a person through death to an afterlife, but doesn’t stop there; they can die in that afterlife and move to another one; they then die there too, and find themselves back where they started, in this world, in a new life. Some cultures have the idea of more than one soul, so that tied in nicely too.\n\nSimilarly, it’s a pantheistic world, with deities and demons and angels and whatnot, but there is a big kahuna who stands in as the One God. The suggestion that it might be an alien intent on eating human souls does separate it a tad from what most religions tell us God is today, but I can imagine how a glimpse of one could be mistaken for the other.\n\nThe other thing I was trying to do in the Books of the Cataclysm was to see what a theistic universe might look like in which the principles of Darwinism also operated. Most modern writers working in this area (that I’ve come across, anyway) tend to deal with the two concepts as though they’re mutually exclusive, as though the Scopes trial meant the two could never be put back together. By putting the two back together—by operating on the assumption that both the pantheon and the environment it exists in are mutable—I found an immensely complex landscape opening up before, one I could barely contain in four fat books.\n\nI sometimes joked with Lou Anders that if the books didn’t do well, I could always found my own religion. It’s still tempting to set up the website and see what happens. The idea of waging a spiritual war against the invader of the afterlife must surely appeal to someone, surely . . . *smile*\n\nYou also additionally seem to be able to jump into various genres without hesitation. Your earlier books, co-written with Shane Dix, are sheer adventurous Space Operas, but then you move from spaceships to magically powered airships in your Cataclysm series. What do you seek out in different genres when you’re writing these very different books?\n\nNothing more sophisticated than variety, probably. There are times I wish I was good at writing one thing, which I could churn out indefinitely, without confusing marketing departments or bookstores or even readers (although I think most of my fans cope with it perfectly well). But like a lot of people, maybe most people, I read wildly and I get ideas in lots of different genres, and I become stale if I stick in one spot for long. So it’s not as if I’m looking for something, specifically, when I hop from genre to genre. I’m drawn there by the stories that demand to be told.\n\nThat said, there certain issues you can explore in space opera that are extremely difficult to even talk about anywhere else. If I want to see what a million year-old human might be like, say; or if I want my characters to interact with a mind as large as an entire galaxy; or if I want to explore the nature of a life form that evolved in the fiery chaos of the post-Big Bang inflationary period; etc. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of writing space opera, because that would be like getting tired of space itself, and that is inconceivable to me.\n\nIn your SF novels you explore the changing nature of humanity, through evolution and technology. Can you talk a bit about ways you think we’re changing right now?\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk recently about Generation Y’s new take on privacy. New for most people: I’ve always thought the issue handled hysterically by the media and commentators on the Internet (but that’s a whole other topic). That’s a hefty social change creeping up on us that may make a big difference to the way we go about life this century. People’s attitudes to body modification are changing: not just augmented breasts, but enhanced physical performance, life extension, and various reproductive options are all being seriously explored at the moment. This isn’t news, and again the knee-jerk reactions are still strong, but I’m sure that when someone faced with age or just wanting to be fitter in generally is handed the option to improve their lot, why wouldn’t they take it? We’re greedy. We love life, and we’ll take it if we can get it.\n\nThere are so many hurdles ahead, and so many social divides we’ll have to get across. Euthanasia and abortion are just two that the US and other countries (like my own) will need to grapple with if we’re going to have sustainable cultures wherein people can expect to live long, happy lives.\n\nI am hopeful, but bracing myself for the rocky road ahead.\n\nHow do these views then, affect the way you approach writing characters in your novels?\n\nFundamentally. For every future society I’ve created—from my first novel, Metal Fatigue, set at the end of this century, to the one I’m working on at the moment, set over a million years in the future—I try to consider what concerns the characters will have on a day-to-day level, as well as across the broader canvas of the story. How do they eat, sleep, clean their teeth, dress, procreate, defecate, whatever? What kind of intimate problems will absorb their attention? How will they resolve them?\n\nI also spend a lot of time finding ways to make them characters that we can identify with, since there’s a likelihood that people in the future will be as alien to us as we would seem to our Cro Magnon ancestors. I’ll confess to being very harsh on space opera that has people just like us wandering through the pages. We don’t have Cro Magnon types any more, so why would our descendants—unless there’s a conscious reason for it, like human development has been frozen genetically or perhaps as a kind of fashion or ideological statement, or whatever? If I can’t see the reason embedded in the fabric of the culture, then I won’t keep reading—and I try to be just as hard on my own books. So far, I’ve had several cultures in which present-day humans exists as part of a spectrum of human experience, existing side-by-side with other more or less evolved types, but I’ve also had modern humanity preserved by faulty transporter “cloning” and by the kind of cultural momentum I think our own culture—the most observed and recorded in history—will generate. As time passes, our legacy will loom very large over subsequent generations, particularly as members of our present generation may live across many more to come. In my latest novel, Saturn Returns, several characters are referred to who were born in our time and are still alive, playing important roles, in the year 879,000AD.\n\nYou also write a dark fantasy series for children. What is the difference between the way you approach these books and your other books?\n\nWhen I’m writing fantasy, I have to switch off the part of my brain that wants to know how everything works. Not entirely, of course: characters and cultures still need to be thought through, and the magic system I use has to be internally consistent as well. But the nuts and bolts of it all have to stay behind the curtain; otherwise I’d never get off page one.\n\nWhen I’m writing for kids, the only concession I make is that I need to get from A to B more quickly than I could with adults. There’s no time for lingering descriptions or in-depth characterisation. It has to be immediate, concise, vivid, from the plot down—or up, or out, depending on how you imagine stories coming together. I love the fact that I can get down a whole novel’s worth of story—world-building, character arcs, the lot—into a book that’s one third the size of my usual novels. It’s both immensely challenging and immensely liberating. My adult books are shrinking because of it. Sometimes I wonder if after this series I’ll ever be able to write a fat fantasy novel again.\n\nIn all my fantasy books, bar one, there have been kids or young adults involved. That’s a very clear break from my SF novels, which are uniformly peopled by characters with adults concerns (even if some of them are technically very youthful, such as the gestalt mind Isaac Deangelis in Geodesica). I enjoy the emotional intensity of younger characters, and I think that fits better in fantasy. The kids’ series I have coming out next year contains some of the rawest, most painful writing I’ve ever attempted. Why I felt freer to go that way with a book for 10 year-olds rather than a book for adults is still something I’m trying to nut out.\n\nIn addition to Space Opera, Fantasy, and YA literature, you’ve also written media novels. Did you enjoy that experience as much as writing your own original fiction?\n\nOh yeah. Who wouldn’t enjoy writing lines for the Doctor or Darth Vader? Well, maybe not everyone, but I certainly do. And I get paid for it, which makes it a bit of a no-brainer for me.\n\nMy take on media writing is this: I’d never write a book about people I’m not passionately engaged with. (Why would I? It’s bloody hard work and the money isn’t that great.) So if I click with a particular franchise and the project sounds like fun, I’ll try to work it into my schedule of original novels. If a media project fails any of those criteria, I won’t do it. I want to be absolutely sure I can give a media book as much attention as I would one of my own because my fellow fans of the franchise deserve nothing less.\n\nThere are franchises I’d never write for because I don’t know them well enough, or just don’t care enough. And there are franchises I would cut off my left arm to write for. We don’t always get what we want, but I feel very lucky that I’ve been able to work in the universes I have—by they my own or George Lucas’s or whoever’s. That I plan to keep doing it even though sometimes it means taking a pay-cut speaks volumes, I hope.\n\nWhat are you reading these days, for your own enjoyment?\n\nLet’s see what’s in my to-read stack . . . A memoir on deafness; an anthology of colonial Australian Gothic fiction; novels by Angela Carter, Patrick O’Brien and Lee Child; The Player of Games by Iain Banks; two anthologies containing pieces by writers who’ve been imprisoned, tortured or killed for speaking out against injustice in their home countries; and a long line of books by friends (including two of your own, TB) that I feel bad for not having got to sooner. Some of this is for work, but in a real sense all reading is for work these days. Even when my conscious critical faculties are off, I’m still absorbing technique subliminally. It’s the best way to learn.\n\nWhen I’m busy writing speculative fiction, my reading-for-pleasure tends to be crime and thrillers. Between deadlines is when I catch up on genre stuff. I think my brain can only take so much of one genre at a time. Or maybe I’m too close to the field now—after 25 novels in 10 years, or whatever the count is—to switch off those critical faculties like I did when I was a kid. That would be a shame, though, so I’ll run with my first theory . . .\n\nThanks a bunch for answering these questions!\n\nMy pleasure!\n\nSteph Swainston, from the publication of Year of Our War (Crawford Award winner), the first of her Fourlands novels, has been highly touted as a writer of unique and challenging fiction that just happens to be set in a secondary world—although Swainston, as is evident below, sees her creation more as a reflection of our world. The novels feature the ambivalent and fascinating Jant, who can fly, and a war against giant insects. The latest and third volume in the series, Dangerous Offspring, came out in the early summer from Eos.\n\nAs a writer of unconventional fantasy myself, I thought it would be interesting to interview Swainston, and we conducted an email exchange during August and September that resulted in the interview below. I could easily have continued with a third or fourth round of questioning, but the fun had to come to an end at some point.\n\nWhat do you love most about fiction?—writing it, reading it, or however you want to interpret the question.\n\nI love quality the most; beautiful writing excites me more than anything else. Sometimes I am so thrilled it's like standing on top of a high cliff looking down an immense drop, or the sense of sick anticipation you get when riding a rollercoaster ratcheting up the incline to its fastest run. I love to read it and write it. To me, literature is the highest art form and I've been shocked to find how few genre writers agree.\n\nFiction is a way of looking at the world, thinking about it, the better to understand it. Samuel Johnson said: 'The purpose of writing is to enable readers better to enjoy life or better to endure it.' That's rubbish. The purpose of writing is to enable the writers better to enjoy life or better to endure it. They have to write. If they didn't, they'd go crazy.\n\nThat does bring up a question, though—don't you have to consider the reader to some extent, in terms of giving the reader enough space in the narrative to enter into a kind of dialogue with the writer and the writer's creation?\n\nYes. It's a balance I'm always trying to improve. But I think some authors, especially in SF, agonise too much over who the reader is—which leads to all sorts of problems: uneven prose, dumbing down, or writers' block. I will never underestimate the reader's intelligence and will always allow them to make their own conclusions about characters and situations in the novels without telling them.\n\nIt is impossible for an author to know who the reader is, or the reader's mind. All I can do is hope that my taste accords with that of readers—and that there are sufficient readers with discerning tastes to make my work commercially viable. If the writer goes against his own taste in an attempt to sell blockbuster numbers of books he may well be doomed to failure.\n\nThere are a lot of readers, they all want something different, and to please them all you would be like the merchant in the Aesop's fable, who tries to please every bystander on the way to market and ends up carrying his own donkey. Or your book will be a donkey.\n\nWriters who are very commercially successful are usually not \"guessing\" the majority readership tastes correctly; rather, their own tastes coincide with the masses. So what I do is assume the reader is a reasonable person much like me. If I tried to make the Castle books conform to a more commercial fantasy taste I would be warping the Castle world from its original purpose.\n\nSo, instead of worrying about the gap between author and reader, you can use it to your advantage. Give the reader a scene and let his imagination take it as far as he wants. Open metaphors are useful too: let the readers draw their own interpretations! I always thought the invisible characters in Christopher Priest's The Glamour were a metaphor for the fact that some individuals are more invisible than others—some people can never get served in a bar, while others have a formidable presence. I was rather put out when Priest told me he didn't intend such an allegorical interpretation.\n\nWhat draws you to fantasy fiction?\n\nWell, I don't really think of it as \"fantasy\" fiction. I prefer not to draw lines between good fantasy and good mainstream literature, but see the whole thing as a continuum. As an author I have to look at it that way so I don't constrain myself but can do anything. I didn't consciously set out to write fantasy; I'm writing the Castle mythos—something that interests me—and it's up to readers how they want to classify it.\n\nI share an interest with this kind of fiction because it's adept at using the deep structures of myths that will always be relevant and compelling, as long as we continue to be human. They are the precepts of storytelling—a clear roadmap the writer has to follow for the story to be great. Obviously you can twist them and play variations but, for example in Dangerous Offspring there can only be one outcome once Cyan had levelled her Challenge.\n\nDo you ever consciously try to subvert myth, though? To not give the reader the expected archetypal outcome?\n\nI'm not talking about \"archetypal outcomes.\" I'm talking about structures that are understandable owing to the way we are human: with normal patterns of human wants. The structures of male/female relationships, or relations of power and hierarchy which have recurred through the world ever since the Palaeolithic. Every human in the world has, encoded in his or her mind, the emotions and needs of the group animals we once were—and still are.\n\nThat's why it is important not to be too weird in fiction. If you subvert archetypes too much, or give archetypes a cameo role rather than making them the root, the reader will feel disappointed even though he may not know why. Books such as Harrison's A Storm of Wings suffer from having nothing human nor relevant to people's lives to relate to. It's beautiful but unreadable. Even my Rhydanne or Vermiform characters have some human drives. Rhydanne miss some aspects of humanity but have an attractive predatory speed and grace.\n\nWhen a story deviates from the structure it will seem wrong. If the story demands an unpleasant end the writer must have the courage to conform. For example the Terry Gilliam film Brothers Grimm ended terribly because if you have two brothers competing for one woman then one brother must die, or lose badly, or be left behind. Two men competing for one woman, especially if the men are related, will NOT end with them still being friends! One of them must go, or, for the brothers to be reconciled, the woman must go.\n\nIn Dangerous Offspring I show that the power of one generation must be handed over to the next - or the next generation will seize it. One generation always adapts the heroes of the previous one to its own means. Lightning knows when to stop, which is the highest attribute of power. He knows he must step back and allow himself to be superseded or the stagnation in his life and in the world will continue. Lightning's very presence is a sea-anchor slowing progress but keeping its course more certain.\n\nIn this case Jant—in many ways Lightning's sidekick—is given the task of mentor to Cyan. So he can't sleep with Cyan and their relationship will be more pure. Jant is forced, by Lightning, to grow up; to become the leader. We shall see later whether he actually has it in him to become the mature Eszai.\n\nHave you always written work set in an imaginary place?\n\nI have always written Castle but I also write poetry—there's some on my website: www.stephswainston.co.uk. Yes, the Fourlands is an imaginary place but it's a mirror to hold up to the real world—it is my comment on, for example, class-A characters and our overly-competitive society in which meritocracy itself is often little more than a fantasy. In future, I plan to expand on this material by writing novels set in the real world, too. But first there will be some more Castle.\n\nThe Fourlands may be an imaginary place but it is always based on real life. I describe real places and characters, and enlarge them out of proportion, zoom in on certain aspects, and that's how I make fantasy. I have done this since I was eight years old, but when I lived at home with my parents I had to keep it secret because they were very disparaging. I had to hide my notebooks—under the bed, that kind of thing—and once, in a plastic box in the woods behind the house. I kept going, regardless of derision, which incidentally is the advice I'd give to any aspiring author—never give up.\n\nWhat's your take on the idea of \"world-building\", then? M. John Harrison had some dismissive things to say about it on his blog recently. I agree to some extent, but don't there have to be some rules, some \"world-building,\" in order for a place to seem coherent enough for a reader to buy into it?\n\nThere is a range of approaches. Most fantasy authors seem to want their world to stand alone, as if it really exists. But I am using the Fourlands to write about the real world—our world—and about the real people, problems and relationships I see around me. Terry Pratchett frequently used the Discworld this way.\n\nSome authors create secondary worlds just to set adventures in—a fact I find bizarre, because the most thrilling and arduous adventures happen in our world. But at the same time the Castle world has been worked out coherently to a great extent. So there is something for all readers' tastes. Of course the readers know that the world isn't real but they enjoy suspending disbelief. The consistency or 'realism' helps this, and that's part of the entertainment a book should offer. Dickens didn't feel the need to tell us, in every chapter of Great Expectations, that Pip isn't real or to flay the reader for daring to sympathise with a figment of their imagination. Why should fantasy be any different? I certainly enjoy suspending disbelief when I'm writing—that's part of the escapism that the Castle world has always offered me, and I'm glad to share it with readers.\n\nAn author will stifle himself if he tries to tie himself to one definition of fantasy only. Rigidity in approach will only lead to rigidity in your creation. I think it is much healthier to allow yourself a range of approaches to your world. It will give your creation many more facets if you can see it as the obviously-constructed artefact it is, and a world into which life can be breathed, and a parable, and a place to put observations about our world, and an escape from our world, and somewhere to fantasise about sexy characters, and also put it to any other service you can think of!\n\nHow has your science background influenced your writing?\n\nFirst, the Fourlands runs on scientific principles as much as I can make it and still include things I enjoy. The Shift is a break from such rigorous rules, but some of the Shift creatures and many details of the Insects come from observations of the natural world.\n\nSecond, I include observations of people I've met in scientific jobs. Frost, the Circle's Architect in Dangerous Offspring, is a compilation of different engineers I've met, as well as myself. She builds a dam at the Insect front as part of her plan to push the Insects back, and she is rightly proud of her project—but unwittingly creates the worst disaster yet for the Fourlands. As ruthlessly ambitious as all immortals are, she responds with determination to overcome the disaster and continue with her plans. This inevitably takes a very great toll on her mental state. I witnessed a similar situation when I worked for a bio-tech start-up company: driven, scientific personalities responding as the company started to 'go under'.\n\nHaving a scientist for a father, my feeling is that scientists are just as irrational and just as chaotic as people in any other profession. Would you agree?\n\nYes and no. There's a discrepancy between their personal life and their published work. That comes across strongly with Frost in Dangerous Offspring. She's a genius architect and engineer, an Isambard Brunel or Christopher Wren. But she's also incredibly sentimental: immortality sits heavier on her than with most other Eszai because she misses her husband, who died during the Challenge when she was trying to gain immortality. She thinks she failed to save him and Eszai don't cope well with failure— Frost psychologically beats herself up with her loss and it's become a very long-term habit.\n\nOutside their specialist areas scientists rely on hearsay and prejudice just as much as everyone else. Also, peer-reviewed journals can be unreliable or corrupt, but hopefully not as much as open journals. There is a level of rigour and self-discipline and, as a result, pride, in science that I much admire.\n\nBut remember: a little touch of chaos in an otherwise scientific mind is what leads to great discoveries. Some of the most important things I found while pursuing archaeology were on a whim and a hunch: bones from the Red Lady skeleton, a new type of stone tool from a cave in Wales, an Ice Age spear point in Ely museum, a blue glass bead in a Roman barracks. I found them because other people had overlooked them or thought that such things couldn't be possible. True scholars have open eyes and an approach capable of looking at a question from angles not previously considered—but also a scientific rigour to know how to use the discoveries.\n\nIncidentally, the geniuses that the Emperor saves from every age by giving them immortality and making them Eszai bicker amongst themselves something awful. Imagine the sparks that would fly if Miyamoto Musashi, Leonardo da Vinci, Vesalius and Louis Pasteur lived in one building!\n\nHow do you approach starting a novel? When do you begin writing it?\n\nI begin straight away, but for the first couple of months I take time to do research, go through old notes and photographs. Then the relative amount of time spent on research declines and time spent doing writing increases until it's all writing. It's a natural process. I try to research for more than one book at a time—future novels will need less research as I already have a lot left over.\n\nWhat's the worst part of writing a novel, for you?\n\nI love most aspects of writing for publication but I dislike the Vanity Fair that surrounds it. I swear to you I have had more interesting discussions with my hairdresser about writing than with some of the people who preen themselves as literati.\n\nHow much of a difference is between the novel you write and the novel readers read?\n\nOh, there is a massive chasm—but that is inevitable, because readers can't fully know my mind and they read a story with their own experiences as raw material. My aim is to create images in the readers' minds, in the same way as certain pieces of music trigger your imagination, but they will build the pictures they 'see' from their own experiences. The places and people they've known are different from mine; that's something every author has to accept.\n\nThe hallmark of great art is its capacity to generate diversity of opinion, since, as Oscar Wilde said: 'it shows that the work is new, complex and vital'. For a novel to have any value it must be able to provoke the reader into an intelligent response—to rouse controversy and discussion.\n\nYou can read the Castle books as rollicking heroic adventures: \"kicking Insect butt,\" or you can look deeper—in Dangerous Offspring Lightning and Cyan show the difficulties of bringing up children, of the father-daughter relationship and of the communication between the generations.\n\nHow do you \"manage\" that effect? In terms of providing surface entertainment and then also depth? Is it all about what you do during the revision process? I assume it can't be consciously in your mind at the rough draft stage.\n\nYes, of course it is—in my mind long before the rough draft stage, because it is my natural taste to have both. We talked about how an author should be true to her taste in the first question.\n\nSome of Castle is autobiographical; I hope that makes the novels read more truly than most other fantasy. Sometimes the most seemingly unlikely details are based in fact—for example: In Dangerous Offspring, when Jant finds Cyan and gives her artificial respiration, it's based on my memory from when I had to do the same, at midnight, to a classmate who had collapsed from solvent abuse. And my sister once had to give artificial respiration—on her birthday, no less—to an old lady who died.\n\nWhen Frost builds a wall of books to mark out her office during the crisis of the Insect flight, well, I have seen someone do that. It was quite disturbing then, too.\n\nDo you believe in the existence of Evil?\n\nCertainly not. 'Evil' is just a strong word for something you don't like.\n\nSo genocide perpetrated by a dictator, for example. That's not \"evil\", that's just something people don't like? I'm not trying to dissuade you from your definition, but it seems to me there's probably more you could say.\n\nYou can't dissuade me from my definition. But there is a dangerous duality here. The 'evil' that is something people don't like accords with the deep structures in their minds I mentioned in the second question. Acts seem evil because they go against the instincts of the animals we once were—I think all hominids roughly followed such ideas of 'right' and 'wrong' for their own good. On top of that, cultural beliefs influence what people call evil. The fact that people from one culture unthinkingly call people from another culture 'evil' when they mean 'different' is a major source of strife in the world today.\n\nDoes genocide become more 'evil' if it's perpetrated by a dictator? How about a democracy? The indigenous peoples of America suffered a genocide at the hands of European settlers and, later, the United States—yet so many of the leading actors in this genocide are revered as national heroes (for example Custer and Philip Sheridan). Were they evil? Unlikely: greedy and aggressive, certainly. Did they see themselves as evil? I doubt it. Calling things 'evil' obscures their causes and by so doing makes them more likely to happen again.\n\nMoreover, dictators don't carry out genocide by themselves. Should we punish everyone involved? Who would be left? Such a simplistic morality is what causes genocide—the victims killed are usually the 'evil' ones in the minds of the perpetrators.\n\nMost acts of intolerance are based on over-simplification and a refusal to understand others. To describe something as 'evil' is the greatest simplification you can have. You close down all further hope of understanding it and possibly of preventing it.\n\nEvil™, as an adversary in fantasy novels, should be avoided at all costs. I have written three novels without once using the word 'evil', because the people of the Fourlands don't have the religious concept. Ironically, as a result they don't have as much conflict between cultures as we do.\n\nWhat do you most fear?\n\nSelling myself short.\n\nMore than anything else? You don't fear death? How about the death of loved ones?\n\nHa ha ha ha ha ha. OK, you don't know me. You're forgiven. I am not in the slightest afraid of dying. Nobody who has been through what I have will be afraid of it. If you face death your senses are buzzing! You feel alive! I have thrown myself out of planes, swum underground, all without fear of death. Who the fuck cares? As long as it's fast and relatively painless, I don't give a crap if it happens next minute or in fifty years.\n\nHow can something so universally commonplace as death be frightening? Death isn't frightening because when you are dead you don't exist, you know nothing. So when you are dead you can't possibly be in a state of fear or pain, and wish you were alive.\n\nI'd hate to die, though, knowing I've sold myself short—that I haven't achieved all I could, and done my best in this life. Rather than dwelling on the future or past you should be aware of yourself and your surroundings in the present. Think big! Plan for the future but don't miss half your life looking back or looking forwards!\n\nThere is one person whom I'd be very upset if he died, but seeing as I can't do anything about it—other than keep the car brakes maintained and trust to chance—it would be neurotic to worry about it, yes?\n\nDo you have a favorite or least favorite word?\n\nThey come and go. The worst words are definitely business jargon—the conversational equivalent of elevator muzak.\n\nBest words? Well, at the moment I'm tickled by the Bronte sisters' word for peeling potatoes: \"pillopotating\". \"In the kitchen, pillopotating\". Spoken aloud in a dreamy manner it is a very relaxing word. Also try: \"villeggiatura\" and \"papilionaceous\".\n\nThe Brontes had a contribution to make to fantasy literature—their Great Glass Town. Sometimes I wish the fantasy genre had grown from Great Glass Town instead of Middle Earth. But they were ahead of their time, and Charlotte Bronte knew better than to go public with such a private world, even though her brother Branwell pushed her to do it and I suspect Thackeray would have loved it. I like to use variety—and as little repetition of words as possible. It amazes me that so much fantasy writing is leaden and conservative, still influenced by Tolkien's use of a solemn, \"epic\" style. Anything can happen in fantasy, so why use such stilted prose?\n\nNeither yet awake nor quite asleep, she pauses in her dreaming to listen to the distant sounds of the jungle approaching twilight. They are each balanced now between one world and another—she between sleep and waking, and the jungle between day and night. In the dream, she is once again the woman she was before she came to the island, the starving woman on that other island, that faraway island that was not warm and green but had come to seem to her always cold and grey, stinking of dirty snow and the exhaust of automobiles and buses. She stands outside a lunch room on Mulberry Street, her empty belly rumbling as she watches other people eat. The evening begins to fill up with the raucous screams of nocturnal birds and flying reptiles and a gentle tropical wind rustling through the leaves of banana and banyan trees, through cycads and ferns grown as tall or taller than the brick and steel and concrete canyon that surrounds her.\n\nShe leans forward, and her breath fogs the lunch room’s plate-glass window, but none of those faces turn to stare back at her. They are all too occupied with their meals, these swells with their forks and knives and china platters buried under mounds of scrambled eggs or roast beef on toast or mashed potatoes and gravy. They raise china cups of hot black coffee to their lips and pretend she isn’t there. This winter night is too filled with starving, tattered women on the bum. There is not time to notice them all, so better to notice none of them, better not to allow the sight of real hunger to spoil your appetite. A little farther down the street there is a Greek who sells apples and oranges and pears from a little sidewalk stand, and she wonders how long before he catches her stealing, him or someone else. She has never been a particularly lucky girl.\n\nSomewhere close by, a parrot shrieks and another parrot answers it, and finally she turns away from the people and the tiled walls of the lunch room and opens her eyes; the Manhattan street vanishes in a slushy, disorienting flurry and takes the cold with it. She is still hungry, but for a while she is content to lie in her carefully woven nest of rattan, bamboo, and ebony branches, blinking away the last shreds of sleep and gazing deeply into the rising mists and gathering dusk. She has made her home high atop a weathered promontory, this charcoal peak of lava rock and tephra a vestige of the island’s fiery origins. It is for this summit’s unusual shape—not so unlike a human skull—that white men named the place. And it is here that she last saw the giant ape, before it left her to pursue the moving-picture man and Captain Englehorn, the first mate and the rest of the crew of the Venture, left her alone to get itself killed and hauled away in the rusty hold of that evil-smelling ship.\n\nAt least, that is one version of the story she tells herself to explain why the beast never returned for her. It may not be the truth. Perhaps the ape died somewhere in the swampy jungle spread out below the mountain, somewhere along the meandering river leading down to the sea. She has learned that there is no end of ways to die on the island, and that nothing alive is so fierce or so cunning as to be entirely immune to those countless perils. The ape’s hide was riddled with bullets, and it might simply have succumbed to its wounds and bled to death. Time and again, she has imagined this, the gorilla only halfway back to the wall but growing suddenly too weak to continue the chase, and perhaps it stopped, surrendering to pain and exhaustion, and sat down in a glade somewhere below the cliffs, resting against the bole of an enormous tree. Maybe it sat there, peering through a break in the fog and the forest canopy, gazing forlornly back up at the skull-shaped mountain. It would have been a terrible, lonely death, but not so terrible an end as the beast might have met had it managed to gain the ancient gates and the sandy peninsula beyond.\n\nShe has, on occasion, imagined another outcome, one in which the enraged god-thing overtook the men from the steamer, either in the jungle or somewhere out beyond the wall, in the village or on the beachhead. And though the ape was killed by their gunshots and gas bombs (for surely he would have returned, otherwise), first they died screaming, every last mother’s son of them. She has taken some grim satisfaction in this fantasy, on days when she has had need of grim satisfaction. But she knows it isn’t true, if only because she watched with her own eyes the Venture sailing away from the place where it had anchored out past the reefs and the deadly island, the smoke from its single stack drawing an ashen smudge across the blue morning sky. They escaped, at least enough of them to pilot the ship, and left her for dead or good as dead.\n\nShe stretches and sits up in her nest, watching the sun as it sinks slowly into the shimmering, flat monotony of the Indian Ocean, the dying day setting the western horizon on fire. She stands, and the red-orange light paints her naked skin the color of clay. Her stomach growls again, and she thinks of her small hoard of fruit and nuts, dried fish and a couple of turtle eggs she found the day before, all wrapped up safe in banana leaves and hidden in amongst the stones and brambles. Here, she need only fear nightmares of hunger and never hunger itself. There is the faint, rotten smell of sulfur emanating from the cavern that forms the skull’s left eye socket, the mountain’s malodorous breath wafting up from bubbling hot springs deep within the grotto. She has long since grown accustomed to the stench and has found that the treacherous maze of bubbling lakes and mud helps to protect her from many of the island’s predators. For this reason, more than any other, more even than the sentimentality that she no longer denies, she chose these steep volcanic cliffs for her eyrie.\n\nStepping from her bed, the stones warm against the toughened soles of her feet, she remembers a bit of melody, a ghostly snatch of lyrics that has followed her up from the dream of the city and the woman she will never be again. She closes her eyes, shutting out the jungle noises for just a moment, and listens to the faint crackle of a half-forgotten radio broadcast.\n\nOnce I built a tower up to the sun,\n\nBrick and rivet and lime.\n\nOnce I built a tower,\n\nNow it’s done.\n\nBrother, can you spare a dime?\n\nAnd when she opens her eyes again, the sun is almost gone, just a blazing sliver remaining now above the sea. She sighs and reminds herself that there is no percentage in recalling the clutter and racket of that lost world. Not now. Not here. Night is coming, sweeping in fast and mean on leathery pterodactyl wings and the wings of flying foxes and the wings of ur-birds, and like so many of the island’s inhabitants, she puts all else from her mind and rises to meet it. The island has made of her a night thing, has stripped her of old diurnal ways. Better to sleep through the stifling equatorial days than to lie awake through the equally stifling nights; better the company of the sun for her uneasy dreams than the moon’s cool, seductive glow and her terror of what might be watching from the cover of darkness.\n\nWhen she has eaten, she sits awhile near the cliff’s edge, contemplating what month this might be, what month in which year. It is a futile pastime, but mostly a harmless one. At first, she scratched marks on stone to keep track of the passing time, but after only a few hundred marks she forgot one day, and then another, and when she finally remembered, she found she was uncertain how many days had come and gone during her forgetfulness. It was then she came to understood the futility of counting days in this place—indeed, the futility of the very concept of time. She has thought often that the island must be time’s primordial orphan, a castaway, not unlike herself, stranded in some nether or lower region, this sweltering antediluvian limbo where there is only the rising and setting of the sun, the phases of the moon, the long rainy season which is hardly less hot or less brutal than the longer dry. Maybe the men who built the wall long ago were a race of sorcerers, and in their arrogance they committed a grave transgression against time, some unspeakable contravention of the sanctity of months and hours. And so Chronos cast this place back down into the gulf of Chaos, and now it is damned to exist forever apart from the tick-tock, calendar-page blessings of Aeon.\n\nYes, she still recalls a few hazy scraps of Greek mythology, and Roman, too, this farmer’s only daughter who always got good marks and waited until school was done before leaving the cornfields of Indiana to go east to seek her fortune in New York and New Jersey. All her girlhood dreams of the stage, the silver screen and her name on theater marquees, but by the time she reached Fort Lee, most of the studios were relocating west to California, following the promise of a more hospitable, more profitable climate. Black Tuesday had left its stain upon the country, and she never found more than extra work at the few remaining studios, happy just to play anonymous faces in crowd scenes and the like, and finally she could not even find that. Finally, she was fit only for the squalor of bread lines and mission soup kitchens and "
