After graduating from Long Island University on a full-tuition scholarship, he pursued a career in television production. After paying his dues, Steven went on to stage manage a plethora of TV shows, most recently The Mel Robbins Show and The View, all the while dreaming up his macabre tales. The storyline of his first novel was born from watching horror movies as a child and noticing a lack of diversity, and character development when people of color were employed. After pouring over historical research night after night, and traveling alone to various locales, including Senegal, West Africa and Osaka, Japan, he wrote the first three installments of the Brookwater’s Curse horror novel series, which featured a 1860s Georgia plantation slave who becomes a vampire. After receiving much praise, several glowing reviews from various book club heavy hitters, and literary awards for each book, Steven was admitted into the Horror Writer’s Association. His next two novels, ‘Killer Genius: She Kills Because She Cares’ and ‘Killer Genius 2: Attack of The Gym Rats—pitted a hyper-intelligent, socially conscious female serial killer against a well-intentioned African-American detective.

Three years later, ‘Hell At The Way Station’, Steven’s collaboration with Marc Abbott, a horror anthology with a sort of Arabian Knights twist, won Best Anthology and Best In Sci-Free.

Meek A mild-mannered management engineer by day, a mild-mannered writer by night, Anthony writes speculative, slipstream science fiction and fantasy.

Hard science fiction is a misnomer as far as categories of literature go, as it sounds harsh and difficult to understand, but that is far from reality. Hard science fiction is simply plausible science fiction, fiction that is written in such a way as it conforms to the known laws of science, and that makes it more interesting, as there's no magic wand the protagonist can wave to get out of trouble. Peter's forays into hard science fiction could best be described as informative science fiction or enjoyable science fiction. Peter is a fan of such classic science fiction writers as Philip K. Dick, Arthur C. Clarke and Michael Crichton and their influence on his style and story lines is readily apparent.
