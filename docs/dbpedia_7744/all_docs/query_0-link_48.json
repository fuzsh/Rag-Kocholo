        "text": "I have been working on a new manuscript since Christmas. I had hoped to have the first draft done by Easter, but here we are and though I have written 70,000 words, I have come to realise I need to write at least another 70,000 to get the story told in first draft.\n\nMy thanks to one gentleman for his extensive feed back on this rough work *g* and making me think a lot...\n\nThe thing that is worrying me I seem set to produce another monster of over 200,000 words final draft at this rate. Yet it seems I need that length to tell my tales *sigh*\n\nI am also finding I am not writing \"fantasy\" in the accepted sense of the word anymore. I have fallen into a grey area where I love to create worlds based on ours at various points in history, adding a little \"magic\" or difference without the fullblown so called \"accepted fantasy\"\n\nHeck, my latest review from onlinewriting was a dozzy lol... I was told I was writing Recency Romances and why the hell was I posting them on a Sff and horror writing crit group....\n\nSo where does the line begin? I believe I write \"fantasy\" in the fact that all my work happens in worlds that do not exist outside my head. Much of them are twisted mirrors of this world, fictional creations, therefore fantasy. Why do folks want to shove my work into a box with a label on it?\n\nHereford Eye said:\n\nBecause it saves time.\n\nWhy do we call them 'blondes'? The hair color variation has no standard definition but we get away with it because we know how you all act. Peoples' minds like to make things easy to retrieve so they work on patterns. For many, many people the fantasy pattern implies dungeons and dragons. When you try to follow a pattern more closely associated with Sean Stewart or China Mieville and their ilk, for those D&D people, it isn't fantasy so it must be something else.\n\nNow, I can't wait till KatG corrects me.\n\nI ain't going to correct you, because you are right. There are many fantasy fans who have a very limited range of preferences and if something doesn't fit in that range, they don't like it and they aren't going to like it. And they don't have to either. The problem is not that they have limited reading tastes. The problem is that they assume that their reading tastes are shared by everyone else, even though a simple glance at the titles on the shelves shows that they are plainly wrong. But it's not entirely their fault. A lot of the fantasy fans who don't like them have convinced them that they are right.\n\nThere are also numerous fantasy fans who have read and who like very much writers like Sean Stewart and China Mieville, who write in other sub-genres of fantasy. And the publishers who publish these two authors and others like them are the same genre publishers who put out titles in the epic fantasy sub-genre. They are perfectly willing to publish a much wider range of material than people seem to want to give them credit for, something I don't quite understand. (I guess it doesn't fit in the proper label box, yes?)\n\nSo, Holbrook, options: What historical time period is your fantasy story set in? Is it before or after 1800? If it's after 1800, you can avoid the epic fantasy sub-genre altogether and market it to the genre publishers as contemporary/urban fantasy like Gaiman, Mieville, Hamilton, some of Barbara Hambly and the like. (Doesn't have to be set in a city.)\n\nIf it's before 1800, the genre publishers may still be interested. Believe it or not, they're trying to prepare for the next phase of epic fantasy, since a lot of epic fantasy is tanking. So, if you're doing something they find interesting, it may not matter if it's not Tolkeinesque. If it's set in the 1500's-1700's time period, there's a lot of interest in that right now. I'm seeing a definite increase in stories in that time period in the genre.\n\nIf you think the odds in the genre are too long, and the story is romantic, you're in luck because the romance publishers are trying to create a platform in sff and are looking at sff writers doing romantic stories, not just romance writers doing sff stories. Harlequin's Luna is looking for new titles. Length may be a bit of an issue for them, though. But it might be worth checking out when you get to that point.\n\nThen there is the non-genre option and it's one you may want to consider. If you haven't already, read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. She published, with some help from the romance folk, in general mainstream fiction and the books are fairly thick. And she's a bestseller. In a way, we all take the risk of limiting our market considerably by publishing in the genres with genre publishers, a trade-off for having the built-in fan audience of the genres. Non-genre publishing can have distinct advantages if you can get a publisher to bite. And right now, non-genre fantasy is particularly popular. Non-genre fantasies traditionally don't have a lot of fantasy going on but do make use of it in critical ways. You may want to read Jonathan Lethem's \"Fortress of Solitude\" as an example of the kind of thing that's out there from non-genre publishers.\n\nSo you do have several options, and need not panic. There will always be people who try to put your work in a box and label it, especially in America. But that's not necessarily how the market works for written fiction, and you are not required to agree with these people, however well-intentioned they may be.\n\nThanks all for the comments.\n\nI have since Christmas been very settled with the idea that I am writing a fictional story. Nothing more, nothing less. Trying to get it published, if I ever get round to submitting it, is a long way off. I just want this story out of my head and down on the machine.\n\nThe feedback I have had from folks here has been the usual mixture of pull your socks up, think on that aspect, how about this, never judging the work as this or that. So I risked it on onlinewriting and well *g*. Lately there folks have got so locked into the high fantasy. The, “create your own world totally...” basing it of course on medieval Europe. Now and then you will get the odd story based on another era or culture, mostly Far East, with hints of Samurai. I think you have to be damn good at that to come close to the Daughter of the Empire series, which I look at as the bench mark for such. Radthorne’s books run it a close second I feel.\n\nAnyway folks wanted to shove my story into pigeon holes and I wanted to protest and grumble about it.\n\nTo be honest I didn’t want to spend pages explaining the world. I wanted to show the world through the story, to not spend five pages explaining the currency or dress, or culture. I wanted to layer my story onto the familiar, yet twist it enough to have it be different, to include the somewhat strange. To basically make the reader feel not so sure about this world that is so familiar, and maybe make them think and be a bit uncomfortable.\n\nTo answer your question KatG about time period. It is a mix really of the period from 1750 to 1850 England… I wanted to create a world in the throws of an industrial revolution, with the upheaval and change that would bring to their ordered society with its strict class system. I wanted crusading politicians that were all for change and others that wanted the advances of the budding technology, yet wanted to tighten the screws on the population.\n\nI wanted the “Victorian” gentleman, interested in the sciences, a semi retired politician engaged in a battle with a small, very worldly religious order that has some power call it religious magic, trying to recreate the very symbol of their once power. I want the charming cultured villain, clever, witty, who is also a pillar of society. The woman, groomed from childhood to be the perfect wife of a powerful man, now lost because of his death. Her class and strict society rules are her god. The career Officer haunted by his past, the honourable man caught both in the battle of the politicians, the fight against the order and trying to protect his “one true, lost love” both in reality and memory. The young woman torn out of her comfortable existence and thrown into the world of the working class and having to become more than she dreamed she could ever be. The wild, indulged young women who shocked society by following her heart (Think Lady Caroline Lamb in some respects) and to their eyes fell from grace and reaped her just reward, yet to those that loved and still love her, they would kill to get revenge on those responsible for exploiting her grief at one point.\n\nThen there is Oracle who draws all together.\n\nSo I have trains and telegraph, a working class based on the times, a high society based on the tonne of Regency England with a strict code of behaviour and a religion that is split, one side is a mirror of the Church of England in Victorian times, yet they have a small, worldly order with its own agenda, which has nothing to do with the “established” religion.\n\nAgain, the label of genre is determined by who publishes your work and to a lesser extent, by what audience the publisher seeks for the work. Therefore, George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series is a genre epic fantasy operation, published by a genre publisher specifically for a genre fan audience and then also for as many crossover mainstream readers as they can attract. Whereas Susanna Clarke's \"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\" opus is a non-genre work of fiction, published by a non-genre publisher as literary style historical fiction. Her publisher is going for the same audience as is attracted to authors like Margaret Atwood, Louise Erdrich, Isabelle Allende, and Alice Sebold. And they were extremely successful at doing just that. Because the work has fantasy elements, and because Harry Potter has changed the landscape to confirm that there is gold in the genre audience hills, Clarke's work was also marketed to the genre audience in hopes of picking up some crossover readers, which it did. That makes it an honorary part of the genre, but far from being stuck in the sff section, Clarke's novel makes an unusual appearance there while being happily sold elsewhere in the store. But still, it’s a nice development that more and more non-genre titles are getting marketed in the sff section as well as in general fiction.\n\nWith Holbrook’s work being in the Regency-Victorian era, she can easily market it as such in the genre. Depending on how the fantasy elements work in the story, she could instead market it outside of the genre as a work similar in nature to Susanna Clarke’s or possibly Glen David Gold’s “Carter Beats the Devil.” In the genre, there are some titles that would be good for you to check out down the road, Hol:\n\nBarbara Hambly’s “Those Who Hunt the Night” and its sequel “Travelling with the Dead” (one of her most successful genre series set in the late 1800’s)\n\nJ. Gregory Keye’s “Newton’s Cannon” and its sequel “A Calculus of Angels” (set in the time of Ben Franklin)\n\nPatricia Wrede’s “Mairelon the Magician” and its sequel “The Magician’s Ward”\n\nElizabeth Wiley’s “A Sorcerer & a Gentleman”\n\nLemony Snickett’s A Series of Unfortunate Events series (children’s but relevant since he’s using the old Victorian novel model)\n\nTim Powers – “The Stress of Her Regard,” “The Anubis Gates” (in Regency time period,) “On Stranger Tides”\n\nDiane Duane – “The Book of Night & Moon” and its sequel “To Visit the Queen”\n\nRandall Garrett – “Lord Darcy”\n\nClive Barker’s “Galilee” (technically a horror novel, but really a dark historical fantasy)\n\nJohn Crowley’s “Little, Big”\n\nVondre McIntyre’s “The Moon & the Sun”\n\nPaula Volsky’s “Illusion”\n\nLisa Goldstein’s “Strange Devices of the Sun and Moon” (this would be a particularly good one for you to read)\n\nPamela Dean’s “Juniper, Gentian and Rosemary” (contemporary setting but a good example of genre fantasy where the fantasy elements are slight)\n\nAnd please, stop going to the sf/f/hor critique group that seems to be entirely clueless about what’s going on in the actual genre market. It isn’t SFFWorld’s group, is it? Because if it is, I’m going to go pout at Dag."
