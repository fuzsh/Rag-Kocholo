        "text": "My Year as an Edgar Judge\n\nI’ve judged contests for most of my writing career. Sometimes they’re for unpublished authors, sometimes for published ones. Some are for local writing groups, some are for bigger organizations. Over a year ago, I answered a call to be an Edgar Judge from the Mystery Writers of America.\n\nThe Edgars are the equivalent of the Oscars in the mystery writing world. I figured I’m a fast reader, I read and write mysteries, but I didn’t have high expectations of being selected, as most of my published books are indies, and MWA doesn’t include those in its award categories. I checked the “paperback” box and turned in the form.\n\nI was surprised to get an email asking if I’d serve on a judging committee, and said I’d be proud to be an Edgar judge.\n\nI had to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement which meant I wasn’t allowed to tell anyone I was an Edgar Judge until after the awards were announced, and that I could never reveal how the process worked. (I think it’s safe to say that coin-flipping was NOT part of the system.) I was not permitted to post reviews or even mention the books I was reading, so my Goodreads reading hovered around zero for the year. I stopped going to my monthly Book Club meetings, because I had no time to read anything other than Edgar books.\n\nSo, now that the winners have been announced, and the judges printed in the program, I am free to talk about my experiences.\n\nThings I’ve learned.\n\nFirst, “Paperback” means “Trade Paperback”, not the little mass market paperback books. They’re about as big as hard cover editions, which creates a space issue.\n\nNext, unlike all the other contests I’ve judged, there are no genre categories. The Edgars break things down as follows:\n\nBest Novel. These are hard cover editions.\n\nBest First Novel. These can be hard cover or paperback.\n\nBest Paperback Original (which includes ebooks). These are books that are published in trade paperback or digital, that don’t come out in hard cover. (*This is still a point of confusion for me, because the quality of a book isn’t dependent on what kind of a cover—if any—it has. But that’s the way MWA rolls, and there’s nothing I can do about it.)\n\nBest Fact Crime\n\nBest Critical/Biography\n\nBest Short Story\n\nBest Juvenile\n\nYoung Adult\n\nTV Episode/Teleplay\n\nThis means that in any given category, ALL sub-genres under the mystery umbrella are included. When I’ve judged other contests, especially in romance, we were given apples to compare with apples. For example RWA’s RITAs, the romance equivalent of the Edgars or Oscars, breaks categories down as follows:\n\nContemporary Romance (with sub-categories for length)\n\nErotic Romance\n\nHistorical Romance\n\nMainstream Fiction with a Central Romance\n\nParanormal Romance\n\nRomance Novella\n\nRomance with Religious or Spiritual Elements\n\nRomantic Suspense\n\nYoung Adult\n\nBest First Book\n\nThus, I learned that I’d be reading any book published in trade paperback in 2017 that fell under the mystery umbrella, be it a cozy, a thriller, a futuristic, a police procedural/detective story … and so on. It was more like comparing apples to broccoli.\n\nI learned that some publishers don’t like to follow the submission rules.\n\nI learned that some publishers don’t trust us to respect the terms of the contest. We’re all authors. We all abhor piracy. Yet some publishers who published digitally didn’t want to send us their ebooks and instead, printed them out in the tiniest of fonts, some with no page numbers, some with watermarks across every page, making it virtually impossible to read.\n\n**Note to publishers: You want to keep the judges happy, not make their task more difficult.\n\nBooks were scheduled to start arriving in February, and our committee was excited to start seeing them come in. Our dog was especially excited, as most of the books arrived via UPS, and our driver always has treats for her. Eventually, he was coming three or more times a week.\n\nUltimately, we had about 300 books to judge. It became a full-time job, and for many on the committee, writing slowed. I had turned in the manuscript for Identity Crisis right before judging began, and the only other “book” I wrote was Deadly Engagement, a novella. I didn’t start working on Falcon’s Prey until November. I think I read no more than half a dozen books of my own choosing during the judging year. Being able to pick and choose what I want to read was a genuine pleasure once we turned in our results—although I confess, I wasn’t ready to read ANYTHING for some time.\n\nWith seven judges in our category, we had a variety of reading preferences, but for the judging, we all strove to put aside our likes and dislikes and judge books on their own merit, although there were times when it looked like publishers were sending every book they put out that year, some of which did not dip a toenail into what we’d consider mysteries. We read hard-boiled. We read literary fiction. We read cute cozies. Serial killers abounded. Covers all began to look alike, leaning toward block capitals.\n\nI bought four huge storage boxes and stacked them in my office.\n\nI had books on my desk, on my chairside table, on my nightstand. My normal process is to read in bed before going to sleep, and I joked that I’d have no trouble keeping up as long as I went to bed at 2 in the afternoon.\n\nBut we narrowed our lists and in the end, we all agreed that although our individual personal top picks might not have been the winner, our finalists and the top prize were worthy of the award.\n\nWas there a ‘reward’ for being an Edgar Judge? Nothing beyond the books. This is purely a ‘goodness of the heart’ operation. The awards are given at a banquet in New York City, and between airfare, hotel room, and the cost of the dinner, it’s way outside my budget.\n\nWill I do it again? Not for a couple years, for sure, and that’s assuming that they’d want me. First, I’d have to make room for books! I’ve donated some to our local library systems, to senior centers, to hospitals, but I still have some left over.\n\nIf you’d like a random selection of 3-5 of these books, including at least one of the finalists, just enter the contest. Because of shipping, postage, and legal requirement, US mailing addresses only.\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\n[Tweet “What’s it like being an Edgar Judge?
