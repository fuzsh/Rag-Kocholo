        "text": "Stay hungry.\n\nNever allow yourself to be full for too long.\n\nThe best artist, actor, athlete, writer — the best of everyone — has hunger.\n\nWhen we are too full up — with food and drink and people and places and things — our senses dull. We get weak and lazy and run the great risk of falling into routine.\n\nUp early every day for work.\n\nUp late every night with TV.\n\nSex whenever we can fit it in. Between taking kids to soccer practice, helping them with homework, grocery shopping, making meals, and cleaning the house and picking up the yard and paying the bills and visiting with family and friends and —\n\nYou know the drill.\n\nThat same old, same old cycle of waiting and doing day after day. Until all of the sudden you’re wrapping up the 41st year of your life, deep into year six with your wife, and things you never believed possible become reality every day.\n\nYou love your job. You’re good at it. And you’re getting paid.\n\nYour daughter draws colorful pictures with hearts and flowers and Xs and Os and puts them on your pillow.\n\nYour son wants to wrestle, play Yahtzee, have thumb wars, and listen to rock n’ roll with you.\n\nYou make your bride laugh really hard at least once a week. Not because she thinks you’re a big oaf — which you are — but because you’ve actually done something funny.\n\nYou don’t feel guilty about drinking wine on weekday nights and committing yourself to hours of watching Dexter, Breaking Bad, and Bates Motel.\n\nYou go to bed happy and tired and sleep well.\n\nAnd even though it appears you are just another chubby husband doing whatever it takes to keep his wife and kids happy and provide them with a comfortable life, you are much deeper than that.\n\nYou believe it’s possible to live forever. That God is in earthworms and puddles and car wrecks and earthquakes. That you are part of the songs people write, the books people read, and that your spirit is part of the big spirit that makes whitecaps, espressos, hiccups, and autumn leaves.\n\nYou feel the vibrations sometimes — the universe letting you know it’s there — and when this happens you are free from obligations, responsibilities, the daily movements to make ends meet, and suddenly you’re hungry again."
