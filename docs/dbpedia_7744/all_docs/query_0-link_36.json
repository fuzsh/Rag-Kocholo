        "text": "Skyjack\n\nAVAILABLE IN 2018 IN the US, CANADA, and the UK\n\nThea Paris is shepherding two African orphans from Nairobi to their new adoptive home in London when the plane they are on is hijacked. The CIA, the Vatican, the Sicilian mob, and a secret stay-behind army from the Second World War makes this SKYJACK much more than a flight gone wrong.\n\nPraise for SKYJACK\n\n★ \"Rip-roaring . . . The enthralling plot moves across Europe with lightning speed, linking a WWII legend with an underground militant group's plan to release a deadly toxic substance. In-depth character studies match the high tension. With this nail-biter, Howe seals her place as a first-class purveyor of adventure stories.â Starred and Boxed Review, Publishers Weekly\n\n★ \"In Thea Paris's latest adventure . . . the main story line excels, [but] a subplot involving a young teen with a horrible father adds further tension to the suspenseful narrative. Howe, executive director of ThrillerFest, is a master storyteller, and even though this is her second novel, it demonstrates the talent of someone who has been crafting thrillers for decades.â Jeff Ayers, Library Journal (Starred Review)\n\n\"Howe is so committed to her story and skillful in its execution that the suspense scenes, especially when Paris' group attempts to close in on the terrorists amid a crowd of tourists, are difficult to turn away from. And when Paris has to single-handedly battle a hangarful of thugs, the action is so exhilarating that we wish the scene would go on longer. For action-hungry readers, this one's a must!â Booklist\n\n\"[A] spine tingling thriller. K.J. Howe molds a tale that completely absorbs the reader...Excellent on every level.\" San Francisco Review of Books\n\n\"K.J. Howe proves she owns a sub-genre that has long been neglected -- the women's adventure mystery -- in her second novel about kidnapping and rescue expert Thea Paris. Skyjack soars with a powerful plot, realistic characters and action that is, at times, over-the-top but always believable.\" Oline Cogdill, South Florida Sun Sentinel\n\n\"Featuring the return of international kidnap expert Thea Paris, Howe's latest puts Thea up against enemies both old and new while sorting through the morass associated with the hijacking of a jet on which she was a passenger...Skyjack is a supremely effective effort, relentless in its approach and riveting in its execution.\" Jon Land, Providence Journal\n\nâK.J. Howe is the 'real deal.' Deeply experienced and informed in her own right, she has applied her knowledge, her amazing personal experiences, and her amazing writing skills, to give us Skyjack, a book filled with all the action and suspense that any reader could desire! From a US Air Force B-47 in the 1950âs, to a gunfight in the Hagia Sophia, Howe writes with authority and detail that is intensely satisfying to any reader.â Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, author of On Killing, On Combat and Assassination Generation\n\n\"Exotic locations, intricate plot twists, and rich characters make this a page-turning thriller you will not want to miss. I found myself eager to read the next chapter and then the next, to discover how the unfolding challenges would be addressed . . . Pick up, strap in, and prepare for an action-packed journey.â Gary Noesner, Chief, FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit (retired)*\n\nâThea Paris is the female James Bond. K.J. Howe is todayâs hottest author. Compelling and crafty, Skyjack is brilliantly plotted to the point where you feel the turbulence as you turn the pages.â A.J. Tata, National Bestseller\n\nâAnother sensational Thea Paris adventure, Skyjack starts at 600 mph (literally) and never slows down. Full of dense, twisty, informed plotting and real, compelling characters. Howe is a keeper!â Lee Child, #1 International Bestseller\n\nâThe Freedom Broker was no fluke. With Skyjack, Howe shows she is the real deal. An honest-to-God, first class thriller writer who will have your knuckles turning white as you flip the pages.â Linwood Barclay, NYT Bestseller\n\nâThea Paris has returned in Skyjack, a pulse-pounding treat, sharp as a piece of Damascus steel. If youâre not reading K.J. Howe, you're missing out.â Steve Berry, NYT Bestseller\n\nâK.J. Howeâs Skyjack is a rip-roaring adventure from first page to last. The novel's thrilling blend of scientific plausibility, riveting spycraft, and ripped-from-the-headlines authenticity left me in awe. And the hero of this nail-biter, Thea Paris, is a Swiss Army knife of ingenuity, smarts, and skills. I want her to be my new best friend, or at least, to be there if Iâm ever in harmâs way. I canât wait to see what trouble she gets into next!â James Rollins, NYT Bestseller\n\nâK.J. Howe has done it again! High stakes, up-to-the-minute realism, and nonstop action make Howe's whip-smart international thriller Skyjack a worthy follow-up to her breakout debut, The Freedom Broker. Fans of Jason Bourneâs high-octane thrillers have a new hero: Thea Paris.\" Karen Dionne, International Bestseller\n\nâThea Paris kicks some serious ass in this action-packed thrill ride that grabs the reader from the first exciting page and doesnât let go until the last. K.J. Howe is at the top of the K&R game.â Karin Slaughter, International Bestseller\n\nâK.J. Howeâs Skyjack upends the thriller world with Thea Paris, a fresh, engaging, smart, compassionate, deadly heroine who first appeared in The Freedom Broker and seems destined for many more compelling novels to come. I don ât know what impresses me moreâthe accuracy of the action details (the result of thorough, intensive research), the global sweep of the story, or the underlying theme, which is the hazards, rewards, and complexity of family. As a private pilot, I was particularly taken by the airplane sequences, which are extremely accurate. This is all the more remarkable because K.J. Howe is not a pilot.â David Morrell, NYT Bestseller\n\nâHang on tight: Thea Paris is back in a new nailbiting, high-stakes adventure. Skyjack is exciting, assured, and a hell of a great ride. Buckle up.â Meg Gardiner, author of Into the Black Nowhere\n\nThe Freedom Broker\n\nAVAILABLE NOW in the US, CANADA, and the UK\n\nThere are 25 elite professionals who travel undercover to the deadliest spots in the world to bring hostages home safely by any means necessary. Only one of those 25 elite response consultants is a woman. She brings everything a man does to the job as well as her intuition. She is the inspiration behind professional kidnap negotiator Thea Paris. ( read more... )\n\nAt eight years old, a terrified Thea Paris watched as her twelve-year-old brother, Nikos, was mistakenly abductedâin her placeâfrom their home in Kanzi, Africa. This defining experience drives Thea to become one of the top negotiators in the Kidnap & Ransom field. Nicknamed Liberataâbecause she once secured the release of a captive from the Sicilian mob without paying a centâshe travels the globe bringing hostages home. Twenty years after her brother’s abduction, her worst nightmare is realized when her oil magnate father, Christos Paris, is kidnapped. He disappears off his yacht while it is moored at Santorini; the ship’s whole crew slaughtered mercilessly. Betraying her brother Nikos may be the only way to save her father. Will Thea be able to save him and reunite her family, or will she let her family down again?\n\nBuy The Freedom Broker\n\nPraise for THE FREEDOM BROKER\n\nâTHE FREEDOM BROKER is gritty and hard-charging; Thea Paris an unforgettable heroine.â #1 New York Times bestselling author Grant Blackwood\n\nâNon-stop suspense, commanding attention from the start and never letting goâ¦a must for thriller fans.â Booklist, Starred Review\n\nâSheâs tough. Sheâs smart. Sheâs diabetic. The best scene involves bungee jumping over the Zambezi River. Itâs worth the price of the book. A spectacular start to what promises to be a great Thea Paris series.â Kirkus, Starred Review\n\nâRazor sharp and full of you-are-there authenticityâa superb thriller.â #1 NYT Bestseller Lee Child\n\n\"THE FREEDOM BROKER combines terrific thriller writing and fascinating research about hostage rescues.
