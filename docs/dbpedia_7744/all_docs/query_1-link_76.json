        "text": "Kris Hansen, PhD\n\nKris has been a practicing analytical chemist for many years. Starting at Williams College (Williamstown, MA), Kris completed her undergraduate honors research thesis in Chemistry by developing and utilizing a new approach for characterizing PCBs in the Hoosic River. Along with research advisor Susan Kegley, the work conducted in support of Kris’s thesis was used by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to pinpoint active sources of PCBs into the Hoosic River and subsequently target clean up efforts to this source. The experience of using science to bring about actions consistent with environmental protection motivated Kris to continue pursuing chemistry applied to the environment.\n\nKris earned her PhD in Chemistry from the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she focused on characterizing organic compounds present in aerosol particles in the lower atmosphere that can be associated with impaired air quality (PM2.5). Kris was awarded a post-doctoral research fellowship by the National Research Council to continue this work through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at the Pacific Marine Environment Lab in Seattle, WA.\n\nIn 1996, Kris joined the 3M Environmental Lab in St. Paul MN, applying her expertise in trace level characterization, chromatography, mass spectrometry, and next generation sample preparation techniques to a variety of studies. Just over a year after joining 3M, Kris worked with others to identify, characterize and scope the extent of PFAS contamination of the environment. She published pioneering articles on PFAS in the environment and provided technical leadership and support in PFAS characterization for several years before leaving 3M’s Environmental Lab for another position in 3M in 2001. Kris worked at 3M for an additional 20 years, providing technical leadership in several divisions of 3M including 3M Drug Delivery Systems and 3M Food Safety. Kris has many peer reviewed contributions to the technical literature which have been cited, collectively, >7000 times.\n\nKris left 3M in 2022 to return to her scientific roots and apply her knowledge of and experience with industrial chemical contamination to contribute to the dialogue around cause, effect and mitigation of global chemical contamination. Kris serves on the board of Belwin Conservancy in Afton, MN. She lives in Afton, MN with her husband, Peter, where they enjoy being active in the wilderness of the northern Midwest.\n\nHow 3M Discovered and then Concealed the Dangers of Forever Chemicals; The New Yorker, May 20, 2024 by Sharon Lerner\n\nToxic Gaslighting: How 3M Executives Convinced a Scientist the Forever Chemicals she found in Human Blood were Safe; ProPublica, May 20, 2024 by Sharon Lerner\n\nProfits over Public Health - The Story of Forever Chemicals; ABC Radio National - Rear Vision, Presented by Jennifer Leake, 29 June 2024 (podcast)\n\nSelect Publications and Presentations\n\nPFAS/PCBs/PM2.5\n\nK.J.
