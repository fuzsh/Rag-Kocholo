        "text": "rating: conflicted/10 – maybe a 7.5/10 in the end. Positives and negatives are both in the extreme.\n\nRaule and Gwynn used to be revolutionaries, until the great general defeated them. Then they were hunted. Now, they are drifters, hiding, scraping a living, wandering across desert landscapes from dusty town to dusty town without a real plan for the future. Raule left her revolutionary past behind her; she managed to fade away, but “in more ways than one, and more than she intended to.”\n\nAs the characters wander, so does the story. We drift from scene to scene where the journeys through the deserts fuse with troubled dreams and mirages. Bishop’s writing is very good. Sometimes it is hypnotic, taking in the sun and landscapes, and at other times it is sharp and arresting in moments of sudden fear and danger. But where is this story going? It seems aimless.\n\nRaule and Gwynn end up in the sweltering city Ashamoil and start new lives for themselves. We don’t see the characters together much after this, which is weird because most fantasy books start out with multiple POVs which come together in time, but this book works the opposite way. Raule, a former field surgeon, ends up working for a church-run hospital in the poorer neighborhoods and is confronted by women giving birth to malformed foetuses, some of them part crocodile. Gwynn follows an amoral path by becoming a hired bodyguard for a rich slave master and at night he argues his nihilism with a lecherous, alcoholic priest, who tries to convert Gwynn out of his atheism as an atonement for his own sins. Gwynn finds a higher purpose in a love affair with a crazy artist who might be more than human. This character is Beth and she accidentally finds herself in Ashamoil and also in this world, as if she was pulled into the book from the outside. She tries to escape the city and the story itself by rewriting them through her etchings.\n\nI still don’t see a story in it. It’s an unusual novel, a literate, dark fantasy that requires close reading. The characters are layered and the writing is beautiful. It is both miserable and beautiful in its decadence and vileness. And I suspect that is all there is to it. It is about an atmosphere of obsession and decay. It seems to follow the literary movement of decadence that delights in perversion, while maintaining a highly erudite style. The individual scenes are all fascinating to read and the characters and world are intriguing, but I was just missing a point to it all. The book slips from one story to the next. Maybe that is the point.\n\nMaybe the point is the failure of stories. Raule and Gwynn’s stories had already failed at the start of the book when their revolutionary goals were smashed. The characters all have their own answers to this failure of stories in the world. Raule falls back to patching people up as a matter of principle. Gwynn chooses nihilism. The priest chases redemption and Beth chooses escapism. But these solutions also have their downsides. Raule lets herself be dictated by duty. The priest depends too much on signs. Gwynn seeks too little from the world. It’s as if each of the characters have need of an answer that another character already holds.\n\nI was on the verge of quitting the novel at 50%. Why? Because I felt like I got the message. I worked my way through 150 pages, at a snail’s pace because there seemingly was no point to the story, and now that I know what the book is doing with regards to messages of moral decay, why read the rest of it? It would just be an endless restating of the same ideas. I gave it one more chance and looked up spoilers to see whether the plot lines would go anywhere, and yes they did and so I managed to read on. I even ended up admiring it quite a bit. The characters aren’t likeable, but they are complex. The writing is full of angles, very character-driven and philosophical. Both the story and the characters change in subtle, complex ways. There’s weird magic too, and slowly sneaks up on you.\n\nThe Etched City was nominated for a World Fantasy Award and is nowadays seen as an exemplary work of the New Weird subgenre (more like a movement, which flared up in the early 2000s and then melted into SF). Bishop’s writing skill and imagination can easily measure themselves to other luminaries in that movement, like China Mieville and Jeff VanderMeer. The crocodile-infested, perception-challenging city Ashamoil brings to mind VanderMeer’s Ambergris series, J.G. Ballard’s The Drowned World and M. John Harrison’s Viriconium with its moods and decay.\n\nThe only way this book works is by seeing it as some surreal, metatextual work that comments on the purpose of telling yourself a life story in a morally corrupt world. It’s more like an art project than a novel. Each chapter individually is beautiful to read (and I give it kudos for a hilarious conversation between a drugged-up Gwynn and his horse), but the book in its entirety was just a bit too aimless for me. I need more of a story to hook me in. Or, I could say that there was a story, but it moved underwater by unseen currents, hidden by difficult characters and erudite, obscuring language.\n\nBishop stopped writing, unfortunately I say because she has enormous skill, moved from Australia to Bangkok and started making surrealist sculptures."
