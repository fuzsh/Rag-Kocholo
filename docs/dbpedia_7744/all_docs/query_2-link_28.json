        "text": "Top Ten Tuesday is a weekly feature that currently resides at The Artsy Reader Girl and features bloggers sharing lists on various book topics. The official topic for this week’s Top Ten Tuesday was to lists books which you thought required either more or less of certain elements to make them better. While this is an interesting concept, I’m instead going to do something different and will provide two separate lists here that continue my them of recapping the first half of 2024. The first of these lists will look at the very best pre-2024 novels that I read in the first half of the year.\n\nI have had a lot of fun recapping some of the best recent books and audiobooks released in the first half of 2024 in previous weeks, but I also need to talk about some of the books that came out before 2024 that I also read this year. I am a big fan of going back and checking out older series and books, and there are so many excellent pre-2024 novels that I haven’t had a chance to read before. This has been particularly true recently, as I have spent a lot of time this year pouring through novels and audiobooks with a variety of older release dates and featuring them in my Throwback Thursday posts. I honestly might have enjoyed too many of these older books, as I am way behind in my 2024 readings now, but I think it was more than worth it as there were some exceptional reads there, including a bunch that got five-star ratings from me. Due to the sheer number of pre-2024 books I have already read this year, as well as their amazing quality, I felt that it would be interesting to do a list highlighting them now.\n\nTo come up with this list I had a look at all the novels I read this year that had their initial release before 2024. This list includes a range of pre-2024 releases, including quite a few that I had been meaning to read for a while. To make it a little more difficult for myself, I decided to limit myself to only one book from each author for the main list, which did reduce the choices I had. Thank to this I was eventually able to cull this down to a workable Top Ten list, with a descent honourable mentions section. Due to my current obsession, this list is extremely Warhammer 40,000 heavy, which I’m fine with because they are awesome books, so I apologise in advance if some of my choices are a little predictable. This proved to be a fun list to pull together, so let us see what made the cut.\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Sabbat Martyr by Dan Abnett – 2003\n\nAn intense and epic Warhammer read that blew me away, especially as it provided a fitting end to several key characters.\n\nAmazon\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Cain’s Last Stand by Sandy Mitchell – 2008\n\nCommissar Cain “bravely” faces his toughest challenge ever in this very clever and hilarious book.\n\nAmazon\n\nCold Days by Jim Butcher – 2012\n\nA fantastic, high-stakes addition to the always impressive Dresden Files series.\n\nAmazon\n\nPeace Talks by Jim Butcher – 2020\n\nAnother intriguing Dresden Files novel, Peace Talks was a great read that masterfully set up its explosive sequel, Battle Ground.\n\nAmazon\n\nTop Ten List:\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Straight Silver by Dan Abnett – 2002\n\nFirst up we have a great entry in the fantastic Gaunt’s Ghosts series, Straight Silver. I have been slowly making my way through this exceptional Warhammer 40,000 series by Dan Abnett and Straight Silver might be my favourite entry so far. Forcing the stealth-orientated Ghosts to fight in stagnate trench warfare, Straight Silver is a dark and compelling entry in the series that also does a good job setting up the following Sabbat Martyr. I deeply enjoyed this book, and it was a great pre-2024 novel to check out this year.\n\nAmazon\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Death or Glory by Sandy Mitchell – 2006\n\nThere were several awesome entries in the Ciaphas Cain series that I checked out this year, including The Traitor’s Hand and Duty Calls, all of which were very fun and loaded with action. However, my favourite had to be Death or Glory, which sees a younger Cain crash-land on an ork controlled planet and is forced to fight his way across it. Essentially turning into a Mad Max inspired adventure with the cowardly Cain leading the charge, Death or Glory was pretty damn hilarious and I loved every second I spent with it.\n\nAmazon\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Dead Men Walking by Steve Lyons – 2010\n\nOne of the most intense pre-2024 novels I’ve read this year is Dead Men Walking by Steve Lyons. A great novel that focused on Lyons’ beloved Death Korp of Krieg (check out his later novel, Krieg), Dead Men Walking saw the implacable Krieg soldiers face off against the unstoppable necrons. Essentially a battle between two faceless and unfeeling armies, with the poor civilians of the invaded planet caught in the middle, Dead Men Walking was an outstanding read that showed a particularly dark side to the already crazy Warhammer universe.\n\nAmazon\n\nSkin Game by Jim Butcher – 2014\n\nWhile Cold Days and Peace Talks were very good additions to the Dresden Files series, my favourite book from Butcher I read this year was Skin Game. One of the most highly regarded Dresden Files novels, Skin Game sees wizard protagonist Harry Dresden forced to work with his worst enemy to complete an impossible magical heist. Clever, exciting and loaded with memorable moments, Skin Game was one of the best books Butcher has ever written and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nAmazon\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Brutal Kunnin by Mike Brooks – 2021\n\nMike Brooks has been on a real roll with his amazing Warhammer 40,000 fiction lately, and I made sure to jump back and check out one of his older novels this year, Brutal Kunnin. A captivating and fast-paced read, Brutal Kunnin focuses on the always entertaining ork faction, as they attack a heavily defended planet. Mostly focused on the innate humour that surrounds the orks, Brutal Kunnin was an excellent book that will have you laughing the entire way through. It also sets up Brooks’ 2024 release, Da Big Dakka, and is a must-read as a result.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Sandman Act III by Neil Gaiman – 2022\n\nI had to continue the intricate and utterly brilliant full-cast audiobook adaptation of the classic The Sandman comics with the third entry, which made for some great listening during some road trips I recently had. Continuing the stories set up in Act I and Act II, this third volume had another amazing story that was expertly portrayed with the extensive, high-profile vocal cast who brought it together. A magnificent audiobook that you will not be able to stop listening to.\n\nAmazon\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Witchbringer by Steven B. Fischer – 2022\n\nAn outstanding Warhammer debut from a few years ago I’ve been meaning to read for ages, Witchbringer was a very clever read from Fischer that saw a sanction psychic defend a regiment who all fear and hate her. An amazing read with some interesting examinations of Warhammer 40,000 lore.\n\nAmazon\n\nSaevus Corax Captures the Castle/Saevus Corax Gets Away with Murder by K. J. Parker – 2023\n\nA quick double entry I had to include here was the second and third Corax novels, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle and Saevus Corax Gets Away with Murder by K. J. Parker. Continuing from the amazing Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead, these two books continue to follow the titular master of battlefield loot as he attempts to survive an array of scams and cons being run around him. Both books are very entertaining, and contain Parker’s typical wit, intensity and cynical outlook on human nature.\n\nAmazon\n\nRebellion by Simon Scarrow – 2023\n\nThe latest entries from one of my favourite historical fiction series that I had to read earlier this year rather than when it first came out. A particularly epic book, Rebellion had a great story loaded with Roman historical action and adventure.\n\nAmazon\n\nCrucible of Chaos by Sebastien De Castell – 2023\n\nAfter loving the amazing 2024 novel, Play of Shadows, I had to dive back into the loosely connected novel from Sebastien De Castell, Crucible of Chaos. Released at the end of 2023, Crucible of Chaos had an exceptional story that saw an injured investigator and duellist travel to an important monastery to try and discover what drove all the monks crazy. An elaborate and highly entertaining novel, Crucible of Chaos got an easy five-star rating from me and is guaranteed to make you a fan of De Castell and his extended Greatcoats universe.\n\nAmazon\n\nAnd that is the end of this list. As you can see I have managed to check out a bunch of epic pre-2024 novels in the first half of this year. Each of the above were exceptional and fun reads and I would strongly recommend them, especially if you are in the mood for some fun fantasy or science fiction adventures. I look forward to reading more older books in 2024, although I should probably slow down a little and check out my recent releases. However, I imagine it I will probably continue several of these series, especially the Gaunt’s Ghosts books, so be prepared to see more Throwback Thursday posts featuring. Make sure to check out my other recent lists about the first half of 2024, especially my other Top Ten Tuesday post tonight, and let me know what cool older books you have already checked out this year.\n\nTop Ten Tuesday is a weekly meme that currently resides at The Artsy Reader Girl and features bloggers sharing lists on various book topics. While the official topic for this week’s Top Ten Tuesday required participants to list the 10 characters they would like to go on vacation with, I have decided to do something a little different, and instead I will be updating my favourite literary trilogies list from a few years ago.\n\nTrilogies in literature are a long-running and deeply fun tradition that packs an epic connected tale, into three consecutive novels. There are some truly amazing trilogies out there, from the classics, like The Lord of the Rings, to some recent trilogies that I have been deeply enjoying. Indeed, 2023 just saw the end of several epic and outstanding literary trilogies, while 2024 will see some intriguing new trilogies start up. I have had the great pleasure of reading some truly awesome and exciting trilogies over the years, and back in 2021 I had a wonderful time coming up with a list that featured my absolute favourite literary trilogies. Since I had so much fun last week updating my favourite Warhammer 40,000 fiction list, I figured it was also time to update my previous trilogy list, especially as I had more than enough new entries to highlight.\n\nThis proved to be a fun update to pull together, especially as I had a great wealth of new potential trilogies to feature on this list. To be eligible, the proposed trilogy must consist of three, inter-connected novels. I only included series that were intended to end after three novels, rather than by happenstance, so that means that series like The Gentleman Bastards will not be featured (it technically has a fourth novel on the way). This meant that a previous entry, the Planetside books by Michael Mammay (made up of Planetside, Spaceside and Colonyside), had to be taken off this new list because Mammay has just announced a fourth book. I also excluded trilogies that I have not yet completed, even if I have already read and deeply enjoyed the first two novels. This is because I really need to see how the third book turns out, as a bad third entry can easily spoil a trilogy that starts out strong.\n\nEven with these restrictions, I ended up with a descent list of trilogies, which took me a little while to cull down and which resulted in a generous honourable mentions section. I am judging these trilogies on several factors, including how complete their story is, how well connected the novels are, and whether the component novels provide good introductions, conclusions and connections to the other books in the trilogy. Overall, I am very happy with how this latest version of this list turned out, even though I combined a couple of entries together, and I think that this accurately represents the best trilogies that I have so far finished.\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\nSwords and Fire trilogy by Melissa Caruso\n\nMy first honourable mention is the debut trilogy from talented fantasy author Melissa Caruso. Featuring The Tethered Mage, The Defiant Heir, and The Unbound Empire, the Swords and Fire trilogy tells the tale of the unlikely partnership of an ambitious noble and a reckless, ultra-powerful mage, whose fates are literally bound together. This is an amazing and inventive fantasy trilogy that pits this duo against conspiracies, a nation of terrifying magical users, and their own substantial personal issues.\n\nAmazon\n\nStar Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy by Alexander Freed\n\nThere are some great Star Wars series out there, and one of the very best is the Alphabet Squadron trilogy by Alexander Freed. Made up of Alphabet Squadron, Shadow Fall and Victory’s Price, this trilogy followed a group of pilots in the immediate aftermath of Return of the Jedi, as they continue to fight the brutal war to claim the universe. This trilogy combined a gritty and complex war story with the iconic Star Wars universe to create three impressive novels that work brilliantly as an overarching series.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Century trilogy by Ken Follett\n\nA massive and comprehensive historical fiction trilogy, made up of Fall of Giants, Winter of the World and Edge of Eternity. These books take place throughout the 20th century and follow three generations of several families as they navigate the century’s big historical events, including two world wars and the Cold War. Some of the best historical fiction writing you are ever likely to see; this is a powerful and captivating series.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Icewind Dale trilogy by R. A. Salvatore\n\nIconic fantasy author, R. A. Salvatore, has made a career out of writing trilogies, and there were several I could have included, especially his Dark Elf trilogy. However, I think that his debut Icewind Dale series, is his most consistently impressive trilogy. While the first novel, The Crystal Shard is a tad rough, the second and third books, Streams of Silver and The Halfling’s Gem, more than make up for it, and produce a brilliant overall story that perfectly set up all his iconic characters for decades to follow.\n\nAmazon\n\nTop Ten List:\n\nThe First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie\n\nLet us start this list off with the dark fantasy masterpiece that is Joe Abercrombie’s The First Law trilogy. Consisting of The Blade Itself, Before they are Hanged and Last Argument of Kings, this amazing trilogy follows a group of extremely complex and damaged characters as they attempt to navigate a dark world filled with betrayal, uncontrolled ambition, and all manner of human monsters. All three books are really incredible, with The Blade Itself providing an outstanding introduction, while Last Argument of Kings wraps everything up perfectly and leaves the reader with a troubling but memorable conclusion. I powered through this trilogy in a very short time, and it remains one of my all-time favourite pieces of fantasy fiction.\n\nAmazon\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Eisenhorn trilogy by Dan Abnett\n\nIt was inevitable that a Warhammer 40,000 trilogy was going to end up on this list at some point, and no trilogy deserves it more than the Eisenhorn books (Xenos, Malleus and Hereticus) by Dan Abnett. Considered one of the pillars of Warhammer 40,000 fiction, the Eisenhorn books follow an Imperial Inquisitor, the titular Eisenhorn, as he attempts to root out hidden alien and Chaos threats to humanity. However, throughout the course of the trilogy, Eisenhorn starts to use the methods of his enemies and slowly becomes corrupted by them without even noticing. A brilliant collection of three books that spawned some intriguing sequel series, I cannot recommend this trilogy enough and it is essential readding for all Warhammer fans.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Empire trilogy by Raymond E. Feist and Janny Wurts\n\nI was spoiled for choice when it came to Raymond E. Feist and his multitude of great trilogies, from his iconic Riftwar Saga to his more recent The Firemane Saga (King of Ashes, Queen of Storms and Master of Furies). However, I think his most consistent and impressive trilogy were The Empire books he cowrote with Janny Wurts. Set at the same time as the Riftwar Saga, this trilogy explored an alien fantasy world with some major Japanese influences. An intense and action-packed fantasy trilogy loaded with political intrigue, family feuds and a female ruler battling for control in a male-dominated world, The Empire books, Daughter of the Empire, Servant of the Empire and Mistress of the Empire, form an exceptional trilogy that is really worth reading.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Siege trilogy and Corax trilogy by K. J. Parker\n\nSince my original list in 2021 I have finished two awesome trilogies by K. J. Parker, The Siege trilogy and the Corax trilogy, both of which were outstanding pieces of fantasy fiction that leaned heavily on humour and cynical insights into human nature to tell their entertaining tales. While the Siege books tell three separate stories connected to the siege of a massive city, the Corax trilogy follows the misadventures of the titular Saevus Corax, a conman battlefield salvager. The Siege books featured three amazing reads, Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City, How to Rule an Empire and Get Away with It, and A Practical Guide to Conquering the World, while the Corax series featured the excellent books Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle and Saevus Corax Gets Away with Murder (review to follow soon). Both series were very exciting, clever, and featured a heavy dose of dark wit I honestly found irresistible, enough so that all six books mentioned here got five-star reviews from me. Due to the similarities in style, comedic inclusions, and the fact they are set in the same universe, I had an extremely hard time determining which of these trilogies I enjoyed the most. In fact, it proved so impossible to choose, I ended up calling it a tie and combined the trilogies together into a single entry. Both trilogies are quite impressive, and you are guaranteed to have an outstanding time with all the books in them.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Tide Child trilogy by R. J. Barker\n\nThe trilogy that inspired me to write the first version of this list was the exceptional The Tide Child trilogy by rising fantasy fiction start R. J. Barker. Barker did some incredible work here producing an intense and addictive dark fantasy series that takes place primarily on a naval vessel made from dragon bones. With some exceptional character work, beautifully written scenes, and some truly unique fantasy features, The Tide Child series is one of the absolute best fantasy trilogies out there. All three novels, The Bone Ships (one of my favourite books and audiobooks of 2019), Call of the Bone Ships, and The Bone Ship’s Wake, are incredible and enchanting reads, which come together to form a brilliant and highly recommend trilogy.\n\nAmazon\n\nLessons of the Scholomance trilogy by Naomi Novik\n\nFew trilogies impressed me more in recent years than the Lessons of the Scholomance books by veteran fantasy author Naomi Novik. Essentially a dark take on the magical school genre, the Scholomance books follows a trouble and ultra-destructive teenage magic user who has been sent to the Scholomance, a magical school filled with harsh lessons and infested with hungry monsters. I really got drawn into this elaborate series, especially with its unique setting, damaged characters, and fantastic stakes. Made up of three excellent reads, including A Deadly Education, The Last Graduate and The Golden Enclaves, the Scholomance books were a very powerful series that traumatised the reader (I still haven’t recovered from The Last Graduate’s ending) and took its characters through hell and back, all while also making great use of Novik’s inventive concepts. A brilliant, beautiful, and intense three books that you will not regret picking up.\n\nAmazon\n\nLegacy of the Mercenary King trilogy by Nick Martell\n\nOut of all the exceptional fantasy trilogies I have enjoyed over the years, few have struck me as hard as the Legacy of the Mercenary King trilogy from Nick Martell. Martell’s debut trilogy, the Legacy of the Mercenary King books follows the scion of a disgraced family who fights to uncover various conspiracies and lies inflicting his city as dark forces move to destroy everything. Starting with The Kingdom of Liars (one of my favourite books, debuts and audiobooks of 2020), the series kept moving from strength to strength as the following two books, The Two-Faced Queen (one of my favourite books and audiobooks of 2021) and The Voyage of the Forgotten (one of my favourite books of 2022), moved the story in some outstanding directions while continuing to introduce and expand on the series’ impressive characters. Easily one of the best trilogies from a debuting fantasy author I have had the pleasure of reading, the Legacy of the Mercenary Kings books are extremely exceptional, and a guaranteed hit for anyone looking for something fresh and addictive.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Age of Madness trilogy by Joe Abercrombie\n\nNot content with only having one exceptional fantasy trilogy, Joe Abercrombie had to double down and write the epic sequel trilogy, The Age of Madness, which frankly I had no choice but to give a separate entry on this list. Set a generation after The First Law trilogy, the three Age of Madness novels, A Little Hatred, The Trouble with Peace and The Wisdom of Crowds, contains another outstanding dark fantasy tale following a whole new group of complex and troubled protagonists. This brilliant trilogy featured Abercrombie’s trademark character work, dark storytelling, and cynical edge, which resulted in three outstanding five-star reads. These amazing novels form a deeply thrilling and powerful trilogy which is just as good, if not better than the original First Law novels.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Covenant of Steel trilogy by Anthony Ryan\n\nAnother brilliant fantasy trilogy that I fell in love with recently is The Covenant of Steel books by acclaimed author Anthony Ryan. Made up of The Pariah, The Martyr and The Traitor, The Covenant of Steel books tell the tale of a bandit turned scribe who finds himself caught up in deadly, kingdom changing events, including war, religious upheaval, and supernatural calamities. All three books in this series were quite exceptional, and I love the intricate and impressive overarching narrative they told, which drew you in with powerful storytelling, great characters, and dark twists. I will have to go back and check out some of Ryan’s other series in the future, but for the moment, my eye is on a new trilogy of his, debuting later this year with A Tide of Dark Steel. I have no doubt this new trilogy will be a strong contender for future versions of this list, and I cannot wait to see how Ryan’s next captivating adventure unfolds.\n\nAmazon\n\nStar Wars: Thrawn and Thrawn Ascendancy trilogy by Timothy Zahn\n\nThe final entry on this list is another joint entry with the epic Thrawn and Thrawn Ascendancy trilogies by Timothy Zahn. Bringing back his iconic extended universe character, Grand Admiral Thrawn, to the new Star Wars canon, these trilogies expand on the character’s appearances in recent shows and provide a whole new history to the character. The first trilogy, made up of Thrawn, Alliances and Treason, provides a great coverage of Thrawn’s service to the Empire before the finale of Star Wars: Rebels, while the Thrawn Ascendancy trilogy, made up of Chaos Rising, Greater Good and Lesser Evil, dives into his complex past on his home world. Both trilogies are very well balanced, although I would say they each have a strongest and weakest point to them. I was initially going to feature these as two separate entries, much like I did with John Abercrombie’s books above, however, due to the way they support each other, and because they are both very similar, I felt it was better to combine them into a single entry. All six book are very awesome, and feature some of the best novelised Star Wars space combat sequences you are likely to see. A must read for all Star Wars fans, I really hope that Zahn comes back and writes more Thrawn books, especially after the character had his live action debut last year.\n\nAmazon\n\nWell, that’s the end of this list. As you can see, I have read some awesome trilogies over the last few years, and I think this update does a great job highlighting some of the best recent additions. I am planning to come back to this list again in a year or two, especially as there are some more outstanding trilogies, I am currently in the middle of that will easy make this list in the future. In the meantime, let me know what your favourite trilogies are in the comments below.\n\nPublisher: Orbit (Trade Paperback – 21 November 2023)\n\nSeries: Corax – Book Two\n\nLength: 321 pages\n\nMy Rating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nAmazon\n\nOne of the funniest fantasy authors in the game presents a fantastic second entry in his closely released Corax trilogy with the hilarious and brutally brilliant Saevus Corax Captures the Castle.\n\nIn 2023, fantasy author K. J. Parker (a pseudonym of author Tom Holt), had an incredible blast of creativity as he managed to release an entire trilogy within the space of a month with the outstanding Corax series. Set to follow an infamous battlefield salvager, the titular Saevus Corax, as he finds himself getting dragged into all manner of unusual scenarios, this series sounded so damn fun. I was particularly intrigued, especially as these books were set in the same universe as his epic The Siege series, which featured Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City (one of my favourite books of 2019), How to Rule an Empire and Get Away with It (one of my favourite books of 2020) and A Practical Guide to Conquering the World (one of my favourite books of 2022).\n\nWhile I managed to get all three of Parker’s Corax books last year, I only had the chance to read the first novel, Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead before 2023 ended. This first entry in the trilogy was pretty damn incredible, and I loved the wonderful and highly entertaining story it contained, especially as it was masterfully layered with Parker’s trademark humour. Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead got an easy five-star rating from me, and it ended up being one of my favourite books of 2023. As such, I really want to get through the other two Corax books as soon as possible so I quickly powered through the second one, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle, last weekend. Saeuvs Corax Captures the Castle was another outstanding read that I had such I wonderful time with.\n\nSeveral years after his last outrageous adventure when he was crowned a king against his will, Saevus Corax is back to what he knows best, battlefield salvage. While it is not the most glamorous work, it provides a living for his large crew of outcasts and rogues, as they tour their world’s many scattered battlefields, rescuing and repurposing everything they can recover from the dead. However, a nemesis with a personal grudge will send Corax on a dangerous path he might have no escape from.\n\nWhen several of his men are kidnapped, Corax’s only apparent chance to save them is to capture a delipidated castle in the middle of nowhere. Utilising his unconventional tactics and knowledge of warfare, Corax begins his impromptu siege, only to discover that his old flame, the beautiful con artist Stauracia, is in charge of the castle’s defence, and she has no intention of losing to Corax again.\n\nBut why is Corax’s new unwelcomed employer so determined to capture the castle, and what are they hoping to achieve by using Corax’s motley crew? The truth has the potential to plunge the whole world into war if Corax can’t keep it under wraps. However, Corax soon finds himself distracted by revelations from his past, as he finds hope being dangled before his eyes. Can Corax survive this latest misadventure and the dastardly rivals it brings, or has he finally met his match?\n\nThe second Corax book proved to be just as funny, addictive, and inventive as the first awesome entry, and I had such an outstanding time with Saevus Corax Captures the Castle. Placing his wonderfully witty and world-weary protagonist on the course for more unusual conflict, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle had me fully hooked from the very first word and I just had to give it another full five-star rating.\n\nParker came up with a pretty clever and memorable narrative for Saevus Corax Capture the Castle, which proved to be a lot of fun to read. Starting with another entertaining look at one of the group’s salvage jobs, the book soon places Corax’s entire group in a bad situation when members of the salvage band are kidnapped, and the only way to get them back is by capturing a castle. So begins a battle of wits as Corax pits his innate knowledge of war and human nature against the manipulation of his old foe Stauracia, as they both try and work out why they have been charged with looking after an isolated castle. This impromptu siege between two groups of people who do not actually want to be there proves to be quite entertaining, and it serves as a fun focus for the first half of the book. This first half also features several flashbacks into Corax’s past, especially the events that have occurred since Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead, which provides some interesting motivations and looks at the connections between Corax and the book’s main antagonist.\n\nThanks to some deeply personal manipulations, there is an interesting and dramatic plot change in the second half of Saevus Corax Captures the Castle, as Corax finds himself motivated to journey alone to a forbidden nation. This change from a siege to an independent journey actually works really well in the context of the story, and it builds on a lot of cleverly hidden elements and clues from the earlier plot. You are really on the edge of your seat during this second part of the book, especially as Corax is in the direst of scenarios, and I loved seeing him use his understanding of people to get out of trouble. The ending of this misguided quest proves to be very clever and a little heartbreaking, as Corax finds what he is looking for, but it’s not what he wants. It does allow him a few bits of knowledge that let him destroy his opponents back home and get the payday, although nothing is every that simple for Corax. I liked the intriguing tone that Parker left this second book on, especially as like the first book, the protagonist soon realises that he’s happiest when back doing what he does best.\n\nSaevus Corax Captures the Castle features the exact same writing style as the first book in the series, which you tend to notice when you read these books in quick succession. I personally liked this continuation of style, especially as it is what made me a fan of Parker in the first place, and it results in quite an entertaining story. Told in a chronicle format from the perspective of main character Saevus Corax, the book is his account of events, filled with his commentary, observations and memories, to tell an intriguing tale. Corax proves to be a very fun narrator, and his ultra-cynical take on the world has an entertaining influence on the story which is hard not to enjoy. The resulting mixture of betrayals, manipulations and unconventional warfare really comes together into quite a comprehensive and fun story thanks to this great narration, and I was chuckling the entire way through.\n\nThe series continues to utilise the unique world that Parker came up with for both the Corax books and The Siege novels, and the fun references to some of the prior events are quite amusing. As I mentioned in my review for Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead, this series is in some ways more of an alternate history novel rather than a fantasy book, as it does not feature any magic or unnatural elements. Instead, we get a world of war, politics, and domineering nations, which acts as a satirical mirror of our own history. I would still prefer some form of map up front to keep track of where the characters are going and where some of the nations being discussed are in relation to each other, but you can get by without one. While there are a few mentions of the previous novel in the series, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle is for the most part a standalone novel, and anyone interested in a particularly fun tale can dive in here no problem. However, I would personally suggest going from the start of the trilogy, if for no other reason than some of the jokes in this sequel are a little funnier after Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead, and you get the full understanding of the unique relationship between Corax and Stauracia. It also solves one of the main mysteries from the first book, and it would not surprise me if a couple of story elements from this novel are featured in the third and final novel in the series.\n\nAs you would expect from a first-person perspective novel like this, most of the focus is on the titular Saevus Corax, whose unique adventures we are following. Corax is a very typical Parker protagonist, in that he is an intelligent and cynical being who would rather live a simple life doing what he does best, but instead finds himself thrust into complex and dangerous events. This proves to be a fun character dynamic, and I loved seeing the often-exasperated Corax forced to deal with people trying to outsmart and manipulate him while he is just trying to do the right thing. Luckily his strong ability to understand how people think and then use that to outplay them often keeps him out of trouble, and it is quite entertaining to see him casually stop a clever enemy plan, just because they are doing exactly what he would. His distrustful, intense, and often very honest outlook on life really impacts how the reader sees the world he lives in, and you really grow to appreciate his take on events, especially as he knows everyone is out to get him. However, readers do get to see another side of Corax in this second book, especially as you get to see how his one previous attempt at romance worked out, and the impacts its tragic ending has on him cause him to act out in some big ways. As such, this is a very intriguing book for this great character, and I had a wonderful time seeing him develop even further.\n\nAside from Corax, the cast of Saevus Corax Captures the Castle is pretty fun, as Parker comes up with an interesting group of self-centred, occasionally loyal, but mostly treacherous figures to partner up with our favourite rogue. The most prominent of these is Stauracia, who was both a secondary antagonist of the first novel and the protagonist’s love interest. Stauracia is a con-artist who has run afoul of Corax and his group before, and who finds herself forced to work both with and against them in this novel. Smart, manipulative, and utterly lovely, Stauracia is the perfect foil for the more subdued Corax, and they have some amazing chemistry in this book. I loved the unique relationship that bloomed between them that is often driven more by dislike or mistrust than anything else, but both of them come away a bit better from knowing the other. Other major characters include the group of unlikely companions that make up Corax’s battlefield scavengers. Their constant bickering makes for a fun background to many scenes, and I like how they are usually annoyed with Corax’s antics, although they keep following because no-one else could do the job better. Throw in a great villain, whose prior connections to Corax result in some brutal plots against him, and the cast of Saevus Corax Capture the Castle are extremely entertaining, and I loved seeing the unique narrative that formed around them.\n\nOverall, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle was a highly fun and utterly amazing novel from K. J. Parker that I cannot recommend enough. Featuring all the humour, entertaining cynicism and clever characters that made the first Corax book so incredible, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle serves as an outstanding sequel that continues the series in an awesome way. An outstanding and epic read, this was such a great book and I cannot wait to read the final Corax novel as soon as I can.\n\nAmazon\n\nTop Ten Tuesday is a weekly meme that currently resides at The Artsy Reader Girl and features bloggers sharing lists on various book topics. As we roll into the new year I am going to list my absolute favourite books of 2023, which is something I look forward to every year. This is a continuation of several lists that highlighted the authors and books I have been most impressed with this year. Previous lists for last year included my favourite pre-2023 novels, and my favourite audiobooks, sequels and new-to-me authors of 2023. However, this list here is the big one as it covers my absolute favourite releases of the year, of which there are quite a few.\n\nI think we can all agree that 2023 has been another roller-coaster year for the world, but thankfully readers got a bit of solace as this was an amazing year for books, with a huge range of incredible releases coming out across the genres. Not only did several outstanding new series start but we had some exceptional debuts, and some big continuations of established works. I have had an amazing time reading or listening to some outstanding books this year and quite a few releases have become instant favourites. I must admit that I somewhat struggled to pull this list together, as there were so many books that deserved to be mentioned. Therefore, because I am a very soft touch, and because the quality of the books I read this year was so impressive, I have decided to expand this list out to 20 entries (just like I have the last four years). These 20 books are my absolute favourites from 2023, and I would strongly recommend every one of them to anyone interested in a great read.\n\nTo make it onto this list a book only needed to be released here in Australia during 2023. I have naturally excluded anything I have not read yet, even though there were quite a few awesome-sounding books I sadly didn’t squeeze into my reading schedule. I decided to leave off my usual Honourable Mentions section as the extra 10 entries make it unnecessary. There will be a bit of crossover between the below entries and some of my previous lists. For example, several of these novels appeared on my Top Ten Favourite Audiobooks of 2023 list and my Top Ten Favourite Books from the First Half of 2023 list, which I ran back into July. Overall though, I am very happy with how this Top 20 list turned out and I think it contains a pretty good range of novels that showcase the different types of books that I chose to read this year. So without further ado, here is the list.\n\nTop Twenty List (no particular order):\n\nCity of Last Chances and House of Open Wounds by Adrian Tchaikovsky\n\nFor my first entry, I am doing a double entry with the first two books in Adrian Tchaikovsky’s The Tyrant Philosopher’s series. City of Last Chances was technically released late 2022 but I am including it here because I only got it in Australia earlier this year. Both books are exceptional fantasy novels set in a compelling world where a relentlessness army of anti-religious zealots are conquering everything. The first book, City of Last Chances, was an excellent character-focused novel set in an occupied city with several big personalities try to survive a turbulent period of revolution. House of Open Wounds is a loose sequel that follows one of the best protagonists from the first book as he gets drafted into an army hospital full of eccentric and forbidden healers. Both novels were outstanding, with a great blend of complex characters, intricate overlapping storylines and a subtle humour, and they make for a very worthy inclusion on this list.\n\nAmazon\n\nHolly by Stephen King\n\nI had to feature one of my favourite horror novels on this list with the latest release from Stephen King, Holly. The latest story featuring one of King’s most distinctive protagonists, Holly Gibney (introduced in Mr Mercedes), Holly is an intense and gripping novel that sees the protagonist investigate a missing person’s case. However, the more she digs the more disturbing things get as she uncovers a pair of terrifying antagonists with a dark, dark secret. Honestly one of the best Stephen King novels I have so far read, Holly had me hooked the entire way through, especially as it features two of King’s most disturbing villains. Highly recommended, especially in its audiobook format narrated by Holly’s Mr Mercedes’ actor, Justine Lupe.\n\nAmazon\n\nSon of the Poison Rose by Jonathan Maberry\n\nIt was a very good year for fans of Jonathan Maberry as we got two amazing books from him, both of which feature on this list. This first of these, Son of the Poison Rose, was the sequel to Maberry’s first foray into fantasy fiction, Kagen the Damned (one of my favourite books and audiobooks of 2022). This gritty and brutal read continued to see the protagonist attempt to get revenge on an evil empire and their Witch-king after they slaughtered the royal family he was sworn to protect. However, his enemy has some terrible weapons at their disposal, including zombies, unkillable magical constructs and much, much worse. An excellent inclusion to one of the darkest fantasy series out there, Son of the Poison Rose was an outstanding read that continues to showcase how good Maberry’s distinctive style works in the fantasy genre.\n\nAmazon\n\nBurner by Mark Greaney\n\nMark Greaney continues to impress with his outstanding Gray Man spy thriller series, the last several books of which have appeared on prior year’s versions of this list (including One Minute Out, Relentless and Sierra Six). This latest novel, Burner, sets Greaney’s lethal main protagonist and his conflicted former lover against a determined kill team, determined to keep Russia’s foreign influences secret. A powerful read that tastefully features contemporary conflicts, Burner was one of Greaney’s best books yet and I had an awesome time getting through it.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Armour of Light by Ken Follett\n\nOne of my favourite historical fiction authors continued to showcase his impressive writing ability this year with The Armour of Light. The latest book in Follet’s iconic Kingsbridge series (previous novels include The Evening and the Morning and A Column of Fire), The Armour of Light took the reader back to the start of the Industrial Revolution in England as the town of Kingsbridge struggles with the march on progress. Following a vast cast of colourful and complex characters, The Armour of Light was an outstanding and massive read that I powered through in no time at all. A five-star piece of historical fiction that comes highly recommended.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Book that Wouldn’t Burn by Mark Lawrence\n\nOne of the most inventive and bold fantasy novels of 2023 was The Book that Wouldn’t Burn by Mark Lawrence. Primarily set inside an impossibly large library in a unique fantasy location, The Book that Wouldn’t Burn follows two protagonists with very different experiences of the library as they try to discover its secrets. Impressive in its scope and creativity, The Book that Wouldn’t Burn was a brilliant read that perfectly starts a captivating new trilogy from one of fantasy fiction’s best authors.\n\nAmazon\n\nCave 13 by Jonathan Maberry\n\nMy second Maberry novel on this list is Cave 13, which continues the outrageous adventures of Maberry’s most iconic and mentally traumatised protagonist, Joe Ledger. The third book in the Rogue Team International sequel series, Cave 13 follows on from Rage (one of my favourite books and audiobooks of 2019) and Relentless (one of my favourite books and audiobooks of 2021) and sees Ledger and his team of specialists investigate a new terrorism case involving high-tech weapons. Cave 13 has one of Maberry’s more creative stories, as the protagonists try to stop a deadly plot involving ancient magic, the Dead Sea Scrolls, a traumatising bio-weapon and nukes in the Middle East. Fast-paced, wildly brutal, and featuring a cast of intriguing, over-the-top characters, Cave 13 was an amazing addition to one of my favourite series and I had an epic time listening to it.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Last Devil to Die by Richard Osman\n\nOne of the most moving, captivating and hilarious books of the year had to be the fourth Thursday Murder Club book by Richard Osman, The Last Devil to Die. Following on from Osman’s previous epic books, The Thursday Murder Club (one of the best books, debuts and audiobooks of 2020), The Man Who Died Twice and The Bullet that Missed, The Last Devil to Die follows four retirees who investigate the murder of a close friend. This latest entry had a fascinating case involving drug dealers, antiquities and other villains, all of whom are completely outclassed by four entertaining seniors. However, the best part of The Last Devil to Die was the outstanding characters, each of whom goes through their own emotional journeys in this series, which can be both extremely funny and brutally heartbreaking. One storyline in this book was particularly tragic and you will not be able to keep the tears from your eyes as you read it. One of the most moving, yet hopeful books of 2023, I cannot recommend this entire exceptional series enough.\n\nAmazon\n\nUsagi Yojimbo: The Green Dragon by Stan Sakai\n\nThe 38th volume in my absolute favourite comic book series, The Green Dragon was another fantastic and beautiful addition to the Usagi Yojimbo series. Once again following Stan Sakai’s rabbit ronin through three more compelling adventures, The Green Dragon was an excellent addition to a creative and well-drawn series, and I read through this great volume the very second I got my hands on it.\n\nSaevus Corax Deals with the Dead by K. J. Parker\n\nOne of the funniest fantasy authors out there, K. J. Parker (who also writes as Tom Holt), had a ripper of a year, releasing several outstanding books. Parker, whose Siege series has been heavily featured on this list in the past with books like Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City, How to Rule an Empire and Get Away with It and A Practical Guide to Conquering the World, released a complete trilogy in the later half of 2023 with the Corax books. Following a battlefield looter with a complex past as he gets caught up in all manner of conflicts, the Corax series is an intriguing trilogy that combines some amazing comedy with Parker’s unique outlook on life and fantasy fiction. I have only had the chance to read the first book of this trilogy so far with Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead, and it was something very special, as the protagonist finds himself embroiled in an over-the-top situation with substantial implications for the entire world. I loved every second spent reading Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead and if I had been able to read the sequels (both of which are currently sitting on my shelf), I have no doubt they would be featured on this list as well.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Last Kingdom by Steve Berry\n\nI have been really impressed with Steve Berry’s long-running Cotton Malone thriller series in recent years, thanks to great books like The Malta Exchange, The Warsaw Protocol and The Kaiser’s Web, but his latest novel, The Last Kingdom, might be one of his best yet. Cleverly combining a modern-day spy thriller storyline with an intriguing historical conspiracy about an iconic king of Bavaria, The Last Kingdom really got the right balance of modern-day excitement and fascinating history. There is so much to love about this exciting and insightful book and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next upcoming entry of the series coming soon.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Will of the Many by James Islington\n\nOne of the best new fantasy authors I tried out in 2023 was James Islington who produced the outstanding novel, The Will of the Many, which has been topping all of my recent end-of-year lists. Following a runaway who is drafted into a war against an oppressive regime and forced to infiltrate their elite academy, The Will of the Many was pretty damn epic on a number of levels. Not only did it have an amazing magic school plot (something I am a big fan of), but it also featured some cool and unique fantasy elements while following a compelling protagonist. I was absolutely hooked the entire way through this impressive story and I cannot recommend this brilliant novel enough. I am really hopeful that we get a sequel this year, and I plan to read it the second it is released.\n\nAmazon\n\nEveryone on this Train is a Suspect by Benjamin Stevenson\n\nAfter wowing the world with his impressive 2022 Australian novel, Everyone in my Family has Killed Someone, author Benjamin Stevenson provided an outstanding follow-up with Everyone on this Train is a Suspect. Amplifying the clever and hilarious homage to murder mystery classics by forcing the protagonist to participate in a mystery writer’s convention aboard Australia’s version of the Orient Express, Everyone on this Train is a Suspect lovingly made fun of many classic crime fiction sub-genres while also presenting the reader with a compelling new mystery. Featuring an excellent blend of suspense, misdirection and comedy, Everyone on this Train is a Suspect was an amazing sequel that had me laughing the entire way through as Stevenson has fun roasting his fellow crime fiction authors and enthusiasts.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Fall of Cadia by Robert Rath\n\nThere were so many amazing Warhammer 40,000 novels released in 2023, but one of the absolute best was The Fall of Cadia by the very impressive Robert Rath. Rath, who previously wowed me with his other Warhammer novels, Assassinorum: Kingmaker and The Infinite and the Divine, attempted to novelise one of the biggest lore events from the Warhammer 40,000 canon. Featuring a ton of cinematic battles and larger-than-life characters, The Fall of Cadia had me riveted from start to finish, and I loved just how well Rath was able to capture this climatic event. One of my new favourite Warhammer 40,000 books, The Fall of Cadia was so damn epic in every way possible.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Shadow Casket by Chris Wooding\n\nAfter waiting years for a continuation to Chris Wooding’s epic fantasy novel, The Ember Blade, readers were finally gifted a sequel in 2023 with The Shadow Casket, which was everything we hoped it would be. Featuring a massive and elaborate tale of revolution, comradery and difficult decisions, The Shadow Casket set a disparate group of friends against an oppressive empire in an outstanding read. Featuring some amazing character arcs, compelling world building, and massive war sequences, The Shadow Casket was such a great read and one of the best fantasy novels of 2023. I loved The Shadow Casket so much, and my biggest disappointment about it is that we are probably going to have to wait a few years to get the third book.\n\nAmazon\n\nResurrection Walk by Michael Connelly\n\nOne of the world’s best crime fiction authors, Michael Connelly, is an author who always manages to impress me, and several of his books, including The Night Fire, The Dark Hours, Desert Star and Fair Warning, have appeared on prior year’s version of this list. Therefore, it should be unsurprising that his latest novel, Resurrection Walk, also needs to be featured here, as it was one of the best books I read all year. A new addition to his Lincoln Lawyer series, Resurrection Walk was a wonderful legal thriller that saw two of Connelly’s best protagonists team up to get an innocent woman out of prison. Wildly entertaining and featuring a fascinating and unique legal case, Resurrection Walk was one of the better Connelly books I have so far enjoyed and I had such an exceptional time reading it.\n\nAmazon\n\nMr Einstein’s Secretary by Matthew Reilly\n\nAn elaborate and compelling historical novel that followed a fictional secretary who was dragged into some of the biggest events of the early 20th century. Mr Einstein’s Secretary was an exciting novel that saw Matthew Reilly tell a particularly unique historical tale of love, determination and sacrifice, which cleverly inserted his protagonist into the lives of several major historical figures as their secretaries. This novel had so many compelling elements to it, from the bold characters, intriguing historical details, and a curious writing style, that I ended up finishing Mr Einstein’s Secretary off in a single day. I absolutely loved this book and I had to feature it here as a result.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Traitor by Anthony Ryan\n\nAnthony Ryan ended his outstanding Covenant of Steel trilogy in 2023 with The Traitor. Serving as an excellent conclusion to The Pariah and The Martyr, The Traitor saw Ryan’s complicated and scruffy scribe protagonist caught in the middle of a bloody civil war as his beloved risen martyr attempts to unite the country and force out all the evil she believes corrupts it. However, nothing is as it seems, and the protagonist soon finds himself trying to decide whether he is actually on the right side. Filled with heartbreak, treachery, and damaged characters trying to do the right thing, The Traitor was an epic and moving piece of fantasy fiction that I had such an amazing time getting through. An epic end to a particularly impressive fantasy trilogy.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Lion: Son of the Forest by Mike Brooks\n\nAnother amazing Warhammer 40,000 book I have to highlight on this list is The Lion: Son of the Forest by Mike Brooks. A key piece of Warhammer 40,000 fiction that covers the return of a major lore figure, The Lion: Son of the Forest was a thoughtful and moving character-driven read loaded with symbolisms and intriguing takes on established pieces of Warhammer 40,000 history. I had an amazing time with this particularly strong piece of Warhammer fiction and Brooks really impressed me as an author in 2023.\n\nAmazon\n\nBattle Song by Ian Ross\n\nThe final book I want to highlight on this list is the exciting and compelling historical fiction read, Battle Song by Ian Ross. Following an ill-tempered knight and his unlucky squire as they become embroiled in a lesser-known English civil war, Battle Song was a powerful and compelling historical adventure that had me hooked the entire way through. Smart, intriguing, and full of fun action, Battle Song comes highly recommended, and I cannot wait to get my hands on the sequel coming out in the next couple of months.\n\nAmazon\n\nWell, those are my 20 favourite books of 2023. It turned out to be quite a good list in the end, and I am very glad that I was able to highlight so many fantastic books. 2024 is set to be another excellent year for amazing reads, and I will be examining some of my most anticipated books next week. In the meantime, let me know what your favourite books of 2023 were in the comments below, and make sure you all have a happy New Years.\n\nPublisher: Orbit (Trade Paperback – 10 October 2023)\n\nSeries: Corax – Book One\n\nLength: 359 pages\n\nMy Rating: 5 out of 5 pages\n\nAmazon\n\nOne of the most unique and funny authors of fantasy fiction, K. J. Parker, returns with an outstanding and hilarious read about a likeable protagonist caught up in the middle of so much drama, with Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead.\n\nFew authors have the comedic chops and inventiveness of K. J. Parker, whose work I have been deeply enjoying over the last few years. A pseudonym of established fantasy author Tom Holt, Parker has written a ton of unique and compelling reads over the years, including some outstanding novels that set outrageous and clever protagonists against the stupidity of their world in some impressive scenarios. I particularly enjoyed Parker’s recent The Siege series, which saw three very different men take advantage of a major siege in very different ways. All three Siege books were extremely epic, and they all got five-star ratings from me because of their clever stories, entertaining characters, and fantastic comedy. This includes Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City (one of my favourite books of 2019), How to Rule an Empire and Get Away with It (one of my favourite books of 2020) and A Practical Guide to Conquering the World (one of my favourite books of 2022).\n\nDue to how much I enjoyed Parker’s last series, I was very excited when I found out that he had a fun new trilogy coming out in 2023. This series, the Corax trilogy, follows Saevus Corax, a professional battlefield looter who runs afoul of multiple groups, nations and people in his quest for survival and the big score. Parker, who seems to be an unstoppable force when it comes to writing, released all three Corax books in the space of around a month, which is pretty damn impressive. I have so far had the great pleasure of reading the first of these, Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead, which proved to be an exceptional novel and one of my favourite books of 2023.\n\nSaevus Corax is a man with a twisted and hidden past, who seeks to make a new future for himself by looting the many, many battlefields that scatter his world. Leading a professional band of scavengers, Corax makes his living by selling recovered and repaired gear from the dead to warring armies desperate or greedy enough to buy from him. While not the most glamorous work, it’s a job Corax excels at, and it allows him to escape his complicated history. But the past always has a habit of coming back when you least expect it, especially when there is a great deal of money on the line.\n\nFinishing up a lucrative job, Corax and his men are shocked to discover that they are being accused of committing a brazen heist and now have a price on their heads. Assuming that he is the true target of this bounty, Corax soon finds himself targeted by the two most powerful banking organisations on the continent. Forced to flee, Corax finds himself the most wanted man alive, with several nefarious organisations, as well as vengeful members of his own family, placing a massive bounty on his head. But who is Corax really, and why does everyone want him either alive or dead?\n\nTo understand that you’ll need to unwrap Corax’s complex history, and the events that turned him into the most important figure in world politics. But Corax is sick of being a pawn in everyone else’s game, and he soon starts to make his own moves to ensure his independence. Will Corax survive, or will his attempts at upsetting the board result in chaos and destruction across the world?\n\nThis was an absolutely amazing read from K. J. Parker that placed a very likeable and relatable protagonist into one heck of an elaborate bind. Filled with a wry humour, outrageous scenarios and constant treachery, Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead was an outstanding read that gets a very easy five-star rating from me.\n\nSaevus Corax Deals with the Dead has a great story that is told in a first-person chronicle format from the perspective of titular protagonist Saevus Corax. This is the exact way that Parker wrote The Siege trilogy, and indeed this book is set in the same world several hundred years down the line. This results in a different landscape for the story, with the bulk of the technology, culture, and certain story elements reminiscent of medieval times rather than the previously seen Romanesque setting, and Parker uses this to his full advantage, especially as the protagonist finds himself caught in a battle between this world’s equivalent of the historic banking giants, the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller. While nominally a fantasy novel, as it is set in a different world, this series often comes across more as an alternate history novel with comedic undertones, which is highly fun.\n\nThe author comes up with an awesome tale surrounding this scenario, as the compelling protagonist is thrust into this conflict against his will thanks to certain aspects of his birth. Corax recounts this entire adventure in detail, as he first attempts to ascertain who is trying to capture him after framing him for a crime, before eventually going on the run. Despite promising the reader to always tell the truth, Corax proves to be a somewhat unreliable narrator, mainly because he doesn’t have a desire to share his own personal history unless he must. However, this hidden history comes into play quite a lot, as his past ensures he is immensely important for just being him.\n\nInevitably betrayed and captured, Corax is sent off to experience his destiny, which results in some substantial carnage as the protagonist attempts to either escape or turn the situation to his advantage. This leads to several amusing battles, impractical wars, and other major confrontations, as Corax and the other characters lie, backstab and manipulate to try and get what they want. Watching a highly practical man with a professional understanding of warfare and a capable imagination face off against various foes who constantly underestimate him makes for some great entertainment, and the various twists and turns that emerge are so much fun. This entire story comes together extremely well, and the sheer number of betrayals, changing loyalties and attempts by people to use the protagonist for their own advantage ensure you’re never certain who’s going to come out on top of every brilliant scene. The conclusion of Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead’s plot is very clever, and it brings together a lot of the unique world and compelling story elements that have been built up over the course of the story. The way that the protagonist overturns everything just to maintain his life is so much fun, and the fitting rewards all the characters get is very fun.\n\nI have so much love for how this story comes together, as the protagonist’s recounting of events really works to give you a personal and complex take. Every moment of the story is told through Saevus Corax’s cynical and distrustful eye, which adds a certain slant to events, and the author does a great job of providing some fun, but detailed, context to the events unfolding. Much of this book’s excellent humour is lifted from these outrageous situations that the protagonist finds himself in. The protagonist does a great job of expressing the ridiculousness of many of these moments, as well as the funny ways he manages to oppose them, often by using simple human nature or flaws in various systems to his advantage. I loved how well Parker introduced his protagonist is this novel, and Corax’s excellent narration of current events, as well as the compelling and often emotionally charged retelling of his personal history, comes together well to tell an impressive story. I really cannot emphasise enough how well this first-person narration works, and the detailed recounting of events from a grounded, sensible and exasperated figure really makes for a unique tale.\n\nAs the first book in this new trilogy, Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead is a self-contained book, and readers don’t need to have read any of Parker’s previous novels to appreciate it. As a fan of The Siege series, I enjoyed that the Corax books are set in the same world, especially as the author slips in some fun references and allusions to prior events. However, no prior knowledge of The Siege books is needed, as the protagonist provides all the relevant world history in his narration, with a few fun and ironic points about the unreliability of prior narrators. Parker does a good job of quickly building and exploring the various nations and powers in this world, especially if they relate to the plot, and I liked some of the fun parallels that exist between some of them and real historical entities. The interplay of politics, the rivalries between powers, and the simple desire many of these groups have to betray each other is well set out as a result, and this works into the plot of the book very effectively, especially once you begin to understand just who Corax is. I really enjoyed how all these elements are explored in the plot, although I did on multiple occasions wish that Parker had included some form of map just so I could have kept track of locations and nations. I honestly had such a great time returning to this amazing world, especially as we got to follow yet another unlikely leader who was able to change the world just by applying their own unique brand of knowledge and an understanding of how fallible humans can be.\n\nSaevus Corax Deals with the Dead was an incredible novel from K. J. Parker that continues to showcase his exceptional and comedic writing style. Setting a great protagonist down a chaotic road, Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead had an amazing story which Parker showcases in his well-honed and enjoyable style. Immensely clever and exceedingly funny, Saevus Corax Deals with the Dead comes highly recommended, and I loved every second I spent reading it. I already have both sequels, Saevus Corax Captures the Castle and Saevus Corax Gets Away with Murder (both with very intriguing titles), and I am hoping to read them as soon as possible as I know I will love them too.\n\nAmazon"
