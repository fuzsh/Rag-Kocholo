See that discussion for context:\n\nI guess yet another paragraph should be added to Help:Entering non-genre magazines. Something on the order of Headline: \"Special issues\" Text: \"Sometimes, a non-genre magazine will devote an entire issue to speculative fiction and/or articles about it. This can be regarded as a genre publication and catalogued in its entirety, even though other issues of the magazine aren't.\" --Vasha 12:43, 13 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI'm all for it. Is there any argument against this? Stonecreek 03:58, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nAgreed. If the whole issue is genre, then that issue is a genre publication. -- JLaTondre (talk) 08:13, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nAgreed. Jens Hitspacebar 08:55, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nIt seems reasonable, but it may be prudent to clarify what we mean by \"the whole issue\". Do \"special issues\", which concentrate on SF but include other things, count? If they do, do we want to include the non-SF content? Ahasuerus 09:51, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nGood point. I would recommend only including genre content. How about \"Sometimes, a non-genre magazine will devote an entire issue to speculative fiction and/or articles about it. This can be regarded as a genre publication and genre non-fiction should be cataloged along with the fiction (even though we do not normally catalog non-fiction from non-genre magazines).\" -- JLaTondre (talk) 10:08, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI like that. --MartyD 13:37, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nMe too. Christian Stonecreek 14:17, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI like the wording. Annie 22:55, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nSounds good. --Vasha 11:07, 15 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI also like the proposed wording. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe 14:01, 15 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI have updated Help:Entering non-genre magazines to add the new section using the agreed upon wording. -- JLaTondre (talk) 09:13, 17 January 2018 (EST)\n\nRevisiting standardization of author names\n\nI've recently been told by multiple moderators that there's a policy to always write an author's first initials with periods after them, even if the author themselves and the publication don't. However, I find that Help:Screen:NewPub#Author(s) states \"In the very rare case where an author prefers two (or more) initials as if they were a name (such as \"TG Theodore\"), without period or space, and is so credited, we follow the author's preference.\" What's the current thinking? I can see arguments both in favor of and against changing author names to a standardized form—I just want all moderators to agree on one policy, whichever it is, and have the help screen changed if necessary. --Vasha 08:56, 24 January 2018 (EST)\n\nThe original standard was to always use periods after initials. The reason for it was that some older magazines and anthologies had a habit of randomly dropping periods and capital letters. We didn't want to create variants and pseudonyms every time an editor chose to use \"r a lafferty\" instead of \"R. A. Lafferty\" or \"r a heinlein\" instead of \"R. A. Heinlein\".\n\nThen Steven H Silver stopped by and pointed out that \"H\" was his middle name and not an initial. It started a discussion which, after reviewing the evidence, resulted in the current Help wording. I believe it still reflects our policies. Ahasuerus 16:06, 27 January 2018 (EST)\n\n(BTW it really isn't a very rare case.) --Vasha 08:56, 24 January 2018 (EST)\n\nIt looks like it's become more common lately. We may want to delete the word \"very\" from the clause cited above. Ahasuerus 16:06, 27 January 2018 (EST)\n\n(unindent) Let me get this straight: is the following correct? There should be two variants, one with periods and one without, if the author is credited both ways in publications. But that only applies IF the variant without periods is the author's preferred spelling. If the author usually writes their name with periods, then it should be recorded with them in the record for a magazine that prints the name without? --Vasha 16:19, 27 January 2018 (EST)\n\nPretty much. Let's use Steven H Silver as an example. Most pubs credit him without a period (his preference) and our canonical name doesn't have a period. The few times when he was credited using a period, we recorded the data as it was entered in the pub (\"Steven H. Silver\") and created variants.\n\nOn the other hand, take R. A. Lafferty. All of his \"r a lafferty\" stories (I recall coming across a few many years ago) have been entered as by \"R. A. Lafferty\". Ahasuerus 22:57, 27 January 2018 (EST)\n\nAnd just to be clear, again, the form without periods should be canonical? Because it is the author's preference and in most cases it will be the commonest in publications. --Vasha 10:58, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\nHmmm. Something's not consistent here. If our normal policy is to normalize the as-given credit to conform to our capitalization, spacing, and period-after-each-initial standard (ignoring any special exceptions), specifically so as to avoid creating variants, then it seems we should apply that same policy in similar situations where we're omitting punctuation or spacing or are down-casing. E.g., if all of these credits -- RA Lafferty, R.A. Lafferty, R. A. Lafferty, r a lafferty, etc. -- would be recorded as \"R. A. Lafferty\", then it seems any occurrence of Steven H. Silver should be recorded as \"Steven H Silver\", with a note about removal of the period, and no variant made.\n\nMuch as I lament our various deviations from the record-it-as-it-appears rule of thumb, it is even worse to vary what we do in specific situations. We should either normalize capitalization/punctuation/spacing of author names in all cases, or we should not ever do it. Note that \"normalize\" can nonetheless allow for different formatting according to circumstance. --MartyD 12:29, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI agree that it's a concern, but let's consider the following scenario. Suppose an ISFDB user who is aware of our \"period and space after an initial\" rule comes across \"Steven H. Silver\" elsewhere, e.g. in a publication or on Silver's Fancyclopedia page, which uses the \"H.\" form of his name. The way we have things set up right now, the user does a search on \"Steven H. Silver\" and discovers that it's a pseudonym used by \"Steven H Silver\".\n\nSuppose we were to change the data entry rules and update all of our \"Steven H. Silver\" titles to use \"Steven H Silver\". There would be no easy way for an ISFDB user to find his bibliography in the database. Ahasuerus 13:31, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\nYet another case where some sort of fuzzy searching would be useful. It is also a problem that we have to create variant titles for trivial differences in.punctuation (British \"Mr\" vs. US \"Mr.\" and so on). Is there any possibility of ignoring punctuation when searching? --Vasha 14:50, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI have run a few tests on the development server and it looks like we can modify the regular Author search to ignore punctuation without doing too much violence to performance. Titles would be tougher to do: a sample search went from 0.8 sec to 1.3 sec. Ahasuerus 16:40, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\nWell, it seems that cases like this one (SHS) were one of the reasons why the use of abbreviated names without punctuation was restricted to very few authors. If users won't find Steven H Silver the next step would be to search for Steven H. Silver, whereas the other way wouldn't occur to many users. Stonecreek 16:10, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\nImpossible to restrict this to very few cases if we're going to follow author preferences at all. In that case once we find out that an author uses a non-standard punctuation, we have to adopt it, and there are literally hundreds of them. (I just yesterday found four more that I hadn't known about.) --Vasha 16:33, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\n(unindent) My first inclination is to enter an author's name as he wishes, but in many cases it is as the country of origin wants it. Using the Steven H Silver example, in some countries it's mandatory to print the author's name with a period, while in others it is automatically left out. The same is true with authors like Andrew J. Offutt who often published with his name in lower case. While it would be nice to do what the author wants, there does seem to need to be as system to go by, or everything will just end up being just a mess. Listing an author's name with such variations as pseudonyms doesn't seem to be an option either. Might I suggest that the standardization as is continue, but we have a page in which writers names are listed as they are published, but then these names have a link to the author's standardized name? I.e., somebody types in KJ Kabza and they go to a listing of similar names, and they find KJ Kabza's name with a link to this author's official page. This would save the site the trouble of constantly creating pseudonym pages for authors who want an unorthodox variation of their names on their writings. MLB 19:22, 28 January 2018 (EST)\n\nI agree with you that this is awfully messy. The more I think about this, the less I like any version of \"make a variant for the name as it appears in the publication, but only if.\" It is inconsistent and user-unfriendly that way; it requires people who are entering new records to look up whether the author is one who can be varianted or not every single time. Wouldn't it be better to simply have one form of the name, even if that means making lots,of notes about what's in the publication (a field for that?) That single form could be the author's own or a standardized one. I can't decide which I prefer and there are arguments in favor of both.\n\nUsing a standardized form would be relatively simple in concept, but putting it into practice would involve a lot of editing of records. These are the parts of the system needed: 1. A single author page with their name in standardized form (K. J. Kabza). 2. A note on that page stating that the author himself spells it KJ. 3. A note on every publication and/or title record stating which spelling is used in which publication. 4. A search engine that will pull up K. J. Kabza's page if someone types in \"KJ Kabza.\" --Vasha 06:19, 29 January 2018 (EST)\n\nIf we'd get an author request on a certain spelling, we should go with it, but then it still may be better to make an unpunctuated version of a name into a variant of the punctuated one, since we have to weigh in the needs of the users, too; one aspect seems to have gone out of consideration: that an author is published with an unusual spelling doesn't necessarily mean that it's the author's intention. There are other parties (editors, publishers) involved. Your submissions, Vasha, in many cases were done without giving proof of the author's request or preference, and often without asking primary verifiers. Stonecreek 06:23, 29 January 2018 (EST)\n\n\"doesn't necessarily mean that it's the author's intention\" is why I say that if we are going to use the author's own spelling, we should consult their personal web pages and social media for evidence. It's true that if we only made variants for authors who personally requested us to, there'd be so few of them that the inconsistency wouldn't be very noticeable--we'd still on the whole be using a system with only one form of the name. But it seems unfriendly to the authors to force them to do that. We should have some way of indicating what the author's spelling is, taken from their web presence rather than only by request. And either create variants for any nonstandard spelling (which I don't really want to do) or for none--we can accommodate author requests some other way than by making variants. --Vasha 06:45, 29 January 2018 (EST)\n\nRecord-it-as-you-see-it and making variants based on that seems to be the most straightforward solution. Due to limitations of the system, we can't do that for capitalization variances, but we could for punctuation and spacing. It won't solve the \"KJ\" versus \"K. J.\" search issues, but it will at least lead to being able to find a credit that one is looking at. What difference does it make if we have a lot of variants? Doing it that way then just isolates the how-to-normalize-it issue to choice of which name is the canonical. And that decision can be documented in one place. --MartyD 07:29, 29 January 2018 (EST)\n\nMaybe we should all get together and just teach authors how to spell their own names. MLB 11:58, 29 January 2018 (EST)\n\nAny more thinking on this? We need to get it settled. The latest problem case is G.Kay Bishop, who wants to spell their name without a space between the \"G.\" and the \"Kay.\" --Vasha 02:14, 3 March 2018 (EST)\n\nBeing as there isn't a resolution yet, here's what I'm going to do unless and until there's a consensus to do otherwise. The Help currently states \"In the very rare case where an author prefers two (or more) initials as if they were a name... without period or space, and is so credited, we follow the author's preference.\" So therefore:\n\n1a. I will use the author's preferred spelling (if known, e.g. from their website) as the canonical form of their name. 1b. If I can't figure out the author's preference, I will use a non-standard form of the name as canonical if and only if it is a lot more common than the standard form.\n\n2. In all publications, I will enter the name exactly as it is printed, varianting if necessary. (Note that in at least one case which I've seen, the author has spelled their name with and without periods at different times, but is currently using the period. In such cases I will enter the publications exactly as printed even though the canonical name is not non-standard.)\n\n3. Point (2) only applies if I have seen a preview or asked a verifier; in existing publications where I don't know what's in the book, I will leave the name as it currently is, varianting it to a new canonical form if necessary.\n\n4a. Although the Help only refers to \"two or more initals... without period or space,\" I will use these same guidelines for all non-standard author preferences for punctuation or spacing (e. g. \"G.Kay Bishop\"). However, initals with periods after them must always have spaces between them. 4b. Since it is not possible to have multiple different capitalizations as pseudonyms, I will use a non-standard capitalization as canonical if and only if there is clear evidence that the author wants it that way, and clarify publications with notes if necessary.\n\nIf anyone doesn't like this solution, speak up! --Vasha 13:08, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nAs long as there is no consensus, one should stick to the rules, as it seems there is no basis for just another self-defined rule. Stonecreek 14:02, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nExactly--sticking to the rules is precisely what I am doing. All that I did with those four points was to explain in detail how I am interpreting the guidelines in the Help. Can you show me a written rule that contradicts anything I said? --Vasha 14:12, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nNow, that would be a new development! As with misusing the title tags, in changing names I have seen numerous examples where you seemingly followed your own preferences, not necessarily the author's one. At least there were numerous examples where you proposed changes based on the spelling on some publications (not all, and some against PVed ones), and some where you supplied no proof at all. Stonecreek 14:39, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nWhat sort of documentation would make you happy? Shall I post a link to the author's website in the moderator notes of every single record that I add or edit, if there is something non-standard about the name? Shall I count how many publications use one spelling vs. the other and post that number in the moderator notes of every single edit? --Vasha 14:55, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nYes, something along these lines would be very much appreciated. And with your proposed point 2. you are absolutely NOT sticking to the rules as your recent submission for a publication edited by one 'Robert N Stephenson' made clear. Either you haven't understood the rules or are willingly messing things up. Stonecreek 15:10, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nYes, I did follow the rules. Robert N Stephenson uses that spelling AND it is spelled that way on the title page of the book, so it should be used in the database, according to Help.\n\nYou are the one who's not following the written guidelines. You can't just say \"I've been doing it X way for years;\" either rewrite the guidelines or follow them. --Vasha 15:13, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nSo, what is there that you don't understand in the sentence Initials should normally be entered followed by a period and a space as \"Gordon R. Dickson\" or \"K. D. Wentworth\", even if period or space is omitted in the publication.? Stonecreek 15:32, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nI quote Ahasuerus above: \"Steven H Silver stopped by and pointed out that \"H\" was his middle name and not an initial. It started a discussion which, after reviewing the evidence, resulted in the current Help wording. I believe it still reflects our policies.\" Thus, the part about following author's preference applies to middle intials also, not just two initials. --Vasha 15:46, 10 March 2018 (EST)\n\nI am speaking of Robert N. Stephenson here, for whom you tried to apply your self-invented rule #2. Please apply the valid guidelines! Stonecreek 04:18, 11 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nAccording to the written guidelines and the fact that, as Ahsduerus indicated, those guidelines apply to middle initials, Robert N Stephenson should be in the database as Robert N Stephenson. The fact that he is not only means that the the current form of his name is incorrect (by the written principles). But see Annie's comment below for a sensible proposal to make things easier. --Vasha 18:08, 11 March 2018 (EDT)\n\n(unindent) When I started editing here, one of the easy rules on the books was about the author names - if it has an initial, add a dot and a space and ignore whatever the book decided to use; capital letters for the first letter in each name; small for the rest. It was refreshingly uncomplicated. If I was adding a magazine or an anthology, I did not need to go and check each name to see if that specific author is not saved in the DB under some fancy capitalization or with some fancy spaces and dots somewhere. The few exceptions were exactly that - well known exceptions.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am all for what the authors want but this is a DB and even if search can be tweaked to connect the dots (no pun intended), using arbitrary rules based on preferences makes the already tedious process of adding anthologies and magazines much worse. Add to this the fact that then the moderator needs to do the same checks (because almost none of the editors will explain why they used that spelling in a moderator note) and the thing just becomes silly. Not to mention just how confusing it is for someone that is just starting. We are a database and databases need to have strict standards. Adding a new field into the author and using that as a \"display name\" makes a lot more sense than having a standard that is essentially \"if the editor finds a reference that the author really do not like dots, don't have dots\". Either we go with \"whatever is on the book\" or we go with \"here is our strict standard\". Everything else is just unnecessarily confusing and complicating things without adding any value. Annie 17:33, 11 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nI have to disagree with the \"without adding value\" part--authors have a right to decide how they spell their name, and apparently Steven H Silver managed to convince everyone of that when he posted--but everything else you say makes sense. Editors entering new publications should not have to know what the author's preferred spelling is. As things currently are, entering exactly what's in the book will create lots of duplicate names that aren't varianted to each other. So yeah, it would be very nice for people to be able to just enter a standardized form. Your idea of adding a field to the author record to indicate their preference is an excellent one. There's just one problem--how do we deal with the problem of recording exactly what's in the book? Some people will make notes if they know to, but not all the time. Are you willing to lose having that detail recorded? Personally I think it isn't important and yeah, it doesn't add much value to know exactly what's in the book, but I want to hear from other people whether they want the exactness. --Vasha 17:52, 11 March 2018 (EDT)\n\n(unindent) I love Annie's suggestion of having an extra field in the author record that would contain the author's preferred spelling and cause their name to be displayed that way everywhere, while the main Name field would contain a standardized form. That makes it easy to enter publications, just use the standardized form, no need to look up what the author usually uses. A note in the publication record would be optional--if you know several different spellings are in use, note which one is used in that publication record. This wouldn't be too technically difficult, right?\n\nAnd if we don't go with that solution, the Help needs to be clarified. Thanks a lot... --Vasha 08:32, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nSorry, but there's no need to make this urgent, since we do have valid rules, AND we have such a desired field: it's called the note field. Any additional information regarding an author might be put into this nice item. Stonecreek 13:32, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nChristian, you have said many times that you disagree with my interpretation of the current rules, but I haven't heard from anyone else. That's why I'm begging and pleading for an update to the help section that will clarify matters. This can't be just between you and me. -- Vasha 13:54, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nOh, it isn't. I've watched you espouse your views for quite a while, mostly ignoring anything that contradicted what you want. The entire database can't possibly be changed just so you don't have to think [in other words keep your edits to under 7 seconds, about the limit of your attention span]. You never interpret, you just don't want to do it that way. Waste of cyber-skin. --~ Bill, Bluesman 22:09, 9 April 2018 (EDT)\n\n(unindent) I agree that our current lack of consistency re: author initials can be frustrating. I myself have run into this issue on a number of occasions.\n\nI think the underlying problem is that common usage has changed over the last few decades. A hundred years ago, even 50 years ago, it was understood that having a period after an author initial was the standard. Occurrences of author initials without a period were due to typographical conventions (notably at some digest magazines) and not to be taken seriously by bibliographers. The few cases when an author insisted on a \"naked\" initial -- famously Forrest J Ackerman -- were seen as affectation at best. Over time common usage changed while our data entry standards haven't. It's not an uncommon scenario in the bibliographic field: we have repeatedly changed our data entry standards and the software to support e-books, audio books, links to 3rd party Web pages and so on.\n\nThat said, every time the world changes, it takes some time for our standards to catch up. Being too slow is bad, but being too hasty can be bad as well. For example, back when Wikipedia became big (2005-2006) Al and I kind of assumed that it would ultimately become the repository of all knowledge. Our plan was to work closely with it and to move some of our data, especially biographical data, to Wikipedia pages. Within a couple of years we realized that Wikipedia was not necessarily the panacea that we had thought it would be, e.g. their notability policies meant that they would never have Web pages for most of our authors. We also realized that our decision to create a single \"Wikipedia URL\" for author records had been wrong. We ended up rewriting the software to support multiple 3rd party URLs per author and, later on, per title, per publisher, per award type, etc.\n\nAnd so, even though I understand the frustration, I think it's important to come up with a comprehensive consensual solution to make sure that we don't have to backtrack and re-do things in the future. Annie's suggestion is an interesting one, but there are other potential approaches. For examples, we could adopt a combined approach:\n\nstate that due to recent changes in the publishing world we would start entering author names as printed on title pages and create pseudonyms/VTs when needed, and\n\ncreate a new \"standardized author name\" field in the author record; it would always include periods after initials and would be used by the search logic so that users could find author names regardless of the way they are \"initialied\" in books/magazines\n\nPlease don't be discouraged by the fact that the last Rules and Standards discussion didn't yield any immediate results. Sometimes it takes a number of iterations before we find a solution that is both feasible and addresses everyone's needs. Then we have to prioritize it, but that's a whole different issue. Ahasuerus 13:58, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI had been on the record with a similar position as Christian as well - trying to bend the rules causes more problems than it solves and makes both adding books and moderating records much harder. I think that we should just stop trying to follow every fad of US publishing and just follow our rules and use the Notes (and/or new fields) to ride them. I dread working on magazines and small publishers anthologies these days because of creative naming conventions for the authors and us not following our own rules. Annie 14:27, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nThat is certainly true, Annie, it is a big messy mess! I'm just trying to figure out what I should do right now, while things are unsettled (and while current rules allow for exceptions but are poorly worded as far as explaining exactly which exceptions are allowed).\n\nI've been compiling quite a long list of authors who use non-standard initials/capitalization/spacing, along with which publications various spellings are used in. I guess I should put that on a Wiki page so that we can all refer to it. --Vasha 14:56, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nHow about an innovative approach? Follow the rules. Initial, dot, space. Initial, dot, space. Notes in the author name and in the publications with creative naming conventions and we have all the information that we need. These are fixable downstream if needed anf if we change the rules but in the meantime they do not cause triple work for everyone.\n\nI know you mean well and that you are trying to advocate for the authors but this is a DB and consistency is important. We need a system identification for the author - this is what our canonical name is for the most part - we default on the most used name but... how initials are different from suffixes - or are we going to decide to break that pattern as well? And if we start following this for the US market and keep changing the rules on the fly, what happens when I start asking the same for the Bulgarian ones for example? Let's not go there, shall we? :)\n\nPlus the DB is a scary place for new editors anyway - making it almost impossible to figure put how to enter a name does not help matters. If anything, I think we should go back and clean the mess we had already created by not following our own rules. Annie 15:03, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nOr abandon any pretenses that we are actually following rules and start recording names exactly as they are written in the publication. Which I am even less of a fan of. Annie 15:05, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI don't disagree with you; standardization would be user-friendly. But there was a decision, years ago, to allow exceptions. And that's still in the rules. So strict standardization isn't following the rules. That's one of the things this inconclusive discussion has been about--should we overturn the former decision that exceptions are allowed? --Vasha 15:08, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nThere is a point of no return on all of this. Are we a bibliographic website or just another Index??? Once a decision is made to just STANDARDIZE [I really wish there was a way to make this the obscenity it is ....] there's really no way to go back. At best there has been an attempt to make the 'best-of-both-worlds' work. Sometimes it does, sometimes there's some twit who can't stand that there's a 'difference' in use and usage and the 'help/rules' get lambasted; and they're NEVER satisfied until it's changed to their way. They're flawed, so what. We grow. Bibliography is messy, it's what keeps us thinking [at least more than 7 seconds per edit] and why there are always going to be adaptations. Changing the perception that our Help listings are rules instead of guidelines would make most of these discussions much easier. We already have ALL the tools we need to deal with [supposed] aberrations in authors names/story titles/etc/etc that we need. By simply recording data as it is in the publications we list, and then dealing with the 'fallout', ........... if there's an editor or mod who can't deal with that, or just wishes to iron-clad/stomp/jackboot any variance into submission ..... they should leave. I'll help the twits pack ........ --~ Bill, Bluesman 22:35, 9 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI think it is - the exceptions are there for special cases but I think we stretch this a bit too much. I would argue that any exception needs to be discussed on the community pages - if it is not done or there is no agreement, then strict standardization is the way. Otherwise you end up with different editors having different ideas on what is \"conclusive\" and what should constitute an exception. Or even if we do not stretch it that far, using a non-standard initials handling should ALWAYS be recorded on the author page with links to the sources showing the author preference. Does not help with the adding of the works of that author but saves everyone a lot of time in finding out why... Annie 15:50, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nYeah, that is all very cautious and wise... No problem, for now I will just be keeping a list of all the proposed exceptions. --Vasha 16:30, 6 April 2018 (EDT)\n\n(unindent) Here is a list I've been keeping of unusual names. Note that these are just ones I've jotted down over the last couple months, the tip of the iceberg... --Vasha 15:14, 7 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nFollow the rules and all is good. I've the feeling that some authors don't know what name they have --Wolfram.winkler 05:19, 16 July 2018 (EDT)\n\nHow to handle author credit of traditional stories (again)\n\nI think we should decide on a rule regarding traditional, re-told tales and clarify the help accordingly. I'm coming up with this because we currently have an author page like that of Ludwig Bechstein, which has several titles where the variants are from other authors (\"Grimm\" and \"Kletke\"). Moreover, \"Grimm\" has also been made into a \"pseudonym\" of Ludwig Bechstein, which is not correct because the Grimms weren't. According to Ludwig Bechstein's Wikipedia page it looks like the Grimms and Ludwig Bechstein were different authors, each collecting tales independently. I therefore propose the following:\n\nIf a data source doesn't clearly state that a tale is either a retelling by the credited author, or that the author has re-used the text from another author, we assume that it's a different work and use the credited author.\n\nOnly if a data source clearly states that the credited author has simply re-used the text from another author do we use the orginal author (adding a note about the re-use by the credited author).\n\nTitle records, which are retellings by different authors, must not be varianted. Example: \"The Three Dogs\" by \"Grimm\" must not be a variant of \"Die drei Hunde\" by Ludwig Bechstein.\n\nDifferent authors who retold tales must not be made pseudonyms.\n\nSee also the previous discussion How to handle author credit of traditional stories above.\n\nJens Hitspacebar 07:35, 10 February 2018 (EST)\n\nI agree. However, there is an additional complication when a source uses the wrong author as a credit (this happens outside of traditional stories as well). I've seen it handled by 1) using the credit as supplied and varianting without a pseudonym; and 2) modifying the credit (example Ludwig Tieck (in error) and varianting with a pseudonym. I recommend we standardize on an approach there as well. For all these cases, notes should be liberally used. Links within the notes can show the relationships for those wanting to capture them. -- JLaTondre (talk) 09:08, 10 February 2018 (EST)\n\nI feel it is ok to use a variant, with no pseudonym, for the wrong-credit situation, and have a note in the wrongly credited title with an explanation. This approach is consistent with our handling of works with no credit; we do record it as (not) credited, but we don't make that \"uncredited\" a pseudonym. --MartyD 10:19, 10 February 2018 (EST)\n\nI'd like to thank --JLaTondre for inviting me to this discussion. While doing the Andrew Lang Fairy Books, I've come across this situation a few times & would really appreciate how to handle credit mistakes. --MartyD & JLaTondre both know the trouble I've had with The Enchanted Watch credited to Deulin. I always try to verify a story before I variant or link to a parent title(which takes me a long time when I can't check the original collections!) When I was doing The Green Fairy Book I noticed The War of the Wolf and the Fox didn't match any of the Grimm Brothers' stories, even tho it was mentioned on the wikipedia page for their tales. I found it in Hermann Kletke's collection. I was just going to list it under Kletke when it was put under Bechstein & I'm not sure what to do. I'd would rather break the variant to Bechstein & have it & the 2 other ones currently linked to Bechstein under Kletke. I know Kletke mentions Bechstein in regards to these stories but I think it just makes things confusing. I still haven't found the original of The Golden Mermaid credited to Grimm(& I know from doing this work titles & even character names were sometimes changed by Andrew Lang's translators). In regards to the Grimm as pseudonym, I was wondering of making those that haven't been verified under something like Grimm-x, with a note stating this is to be used for that purpose only? Sort of like that version of Maupassant's The Horla that is used when the translator is unknown. So far there's only a handful of stories in this situation & wonder if this could be a solution-any thoughts?Loviatar 02:02, 15 February 2018 (EST)\n\nEntering translator\n\nWhat is the rule on entering the translator? It's entered on the Title Page Note, of course, in the Tr template form, but can't it be entered additionally, as so many people have been doing, on each relevant Publication Page's Notes? It seems more user-friendly to have it there where a link may land you, and not have to navigate elsewhere. Likewise it seems helpful to me to mention the language in the Notes, although I can see that entering the original title, as I've been doing, can be redundant (although a first-time user might not scroll down when their laptop screen puts Contents below the fold). So--is there a rule on what can and can't go in the Notes as additional info? --Martin. MOHearn 12:00, 20 February 2018 (EST)\n\nThere are two things to consider here - the data in the DB and the users of the DB. For the first one, we do not need the translator in the publication - we all know to look at the title level and adding in the publication is just repeating known information. But for external users that are not so well versed in the way the data works here, having the translator inside of the publication record of novels is actually useful. I would not go out of my way to add it to other editors' work (I make sure it is in the title level when I am moderating) but when I am adding my own publications, I am adding to both (in a lot of cases it is because it is a Bulgarian publication and I need to make some notes on how the translation is marked - translation from a specific edition or an uncommon language, different from the original one for example)) and I would just leave it there if an editor adds it, especially if they are PV-ing. Just my 2 cents Annie 14:29, 20 February 2018 (EST)\n\nI'm not aware of a rule that forbids to additionally state the translator in the note if a publication. Moreover, the software has no translator support (yet) therefore I think it's not a bad idea to do so. Language, however, is a different thing: it shouldn't go into the note redundantly (except maybe for some complex cases), because the software has language support and should itself be able, after some changes, to show the title's language automatically on the publication page, if such a feature is desired. I actually think it's a good idea if this feature would be added. Jens Hitspacebar 11:43, 21 February 2018 (EST)\n\nIt would be easy to change the Publication page to display the language of the container title. If you want to post this proposal on the Community Portal, we could then discuss the implementation details. Ahasuerus 17:30, 21 February 2018 (EST)\n\nWhat Jens said is the same point of view that I can subscribe to. Christian Stonecreek 12:21, 21 February 2018 (EST)\n\nSo we all are on the same page here. Annie 12:33, 21 February 2018 (EST)\n\nIn my messages Hauck has said that the rule is that the translator data goes into the Title Notes and is not to be duplicated in the Publication Notes (and explained that it helps keep the data simpler to manage). After looking around the site for the rule I can see that it's implied in the Publication Notes help page, but it's merely an implication. Could the help page be made explicit one way or the other? If it specified that the translator data either is or is not allowed to be duplicated in the Pub Notes, then there would be a bona fide rule. As it is, it felt like the rules changed under me when I'd been adding the translator in the publication all this time without being told it was a problem.\n\nRepeating the language entry from the container title via the software does sound like a very good idea. MOHearn 22:18, 21 February 2018 (EST)\n\nOMNIBUS Definition Inconsistency\n\nThe OMNIBUS definition in Template:PublicationFields:PubType doesn't match the database. It states \"Conversely, if a book is originally published as multiple volumes, and republished as a single volume, the latter is a novel unless the presentation within the single volume makes it clear that the works are presented as separate novels. For example, \"The Lord of the Rings\", by J.R.R. Tolkien, was originally published in three volumes; the single volume edition is to be categorized as a novel.\" However, the single volume The Lord of the Rings is entered as an OMNIBUS and not a NOVEL. Since it can be argued that some of these versions do present the individual books a separate novels, is this just a bad example that needs to be replaced? Or has practice changed & the whole quote should be struck? -- JLaTondre (talk) 17:15, 6 March 2018 (EST)\n\nThis seems like a similar situation to a fixup novel, or a novel-in-stories. If the final result is presented as a novel, that's the type it should be. LOTR seems like a bad example to choose to demonstrate the principle since there are some editions that are more omnibus-like and some that are more novel-like. --Vasha 17:27, 6 March 2018 (EST)\n\nIt really seems to be a bad example, which should be replaced. The initial novels were published independently, and, though they tell a chronological epic, the OMNIBUS should stay an OMNIBUS. We really have many examples of ongoing stories published in one volume that could be viewed as novels. Especially it would be a NOVEL that includes other NOVELs and that we already had ruled out, I think. Stonecreek 04:11, 7 March 2018 (EST)\n\nI'm a new contributor. I read the rules about Date field in Magazine records. The two things that struck me were\n\n'and also because there is no good way to determine actual publication date'\n\nand\n\n'For magazine cover dates that cannot be assigned to a specific month, use the year only: \"Spring 1943\" is just entered as \"1943-00-00\"'\n\nFor U.S. magazines there is a good way to determine actual publication date. Most of them have copyright registrations which list the date of publication for each issue. These are available online - for convenience I've saved on my hard drive PDF files of all annual Periodical Registrations books from 1891 through 1977.\n\nI wish the second point would be reconsidered. I can see that there is a common consensus (i.e. not just ISFDB but elsewhere) to simply use the month and year for monthly periodicals. I don't believe there is common consensus to use \"00-00\" for quarterlies, annuals, and any other non-monthly periodicals. Why not put in accurate dates where known?\n\nMy real question, though, is would it be against the rules to make the Date field of individual titles be the actual publication date? E.g. \"The Derelict of Space\" by William Thurmond & Ray Cummings. This was first published September 1, 1931, in Wonder Stories Quarterly Fall 1931 which has a Date field value of 1931-00-00. The Title Record for the story also has a Date of 1931-00-00. Would it be OK to put 1931-09-01 in the Date field of \"The Derelict of Space\"'s Title Record? PatConolly 02:56, 16 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nYes, it would be against the rules as they are now stated. However, for quarterly publications, I see no reason to not state an actual month of publication. A publication for 'Spring' of a given year could be determined to have the first month of the timespan in question assigned (March), just as a publication for the first quarter of a year would be assigned YYYY-01-00. Stonecreek 03:20, 16 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nI'm against it, particularly in this case as, to the best of my knowledge, September 1, 1931 is not IN Fall 1931 (for us europeans it's in Summer). It's for the same reasons that we do not date monthly magazines by the availability date. I've also strong reservations about the fact that the date registered by the copyright office is the real publication date (or what we mean by this term). In France books and magazines are also registered (it's the Dépôt Légal) and this date is rarely the same as our \"publication date\". I'm not sure that a copyright office's data has any relevance as a bibliographic reference (if it has, why not use the printer's records or the printing date that's on this issue).\n\nHervé, you're absolutely right on the exact date; the date of registration of an official national library has some more relevance than the date of availability as stated with some online bookshops, but not that much more. But in your stated case we would file the date of publication as September 1931 (1931-09-00), which would be an analogue to the three month span for any other quarterly published magazine. Stonecreek 06:30, 16 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nIn the U.S. copyright registrations, Publication Date for a magazine meant the same as Publication Date for a book - namely the date that the publication was on sale. The publisher submits that date with his registration. I would say it's as relevant as a statement printed in the magazine saying \"next issue on sale (some date)\" or in ads saying \"this other magazine on sale (some date)\". And if you check you will find that these publication dates stated in magazines match what the registrations show - at least it did for many decades (I don't really look at current magazines). I'm not sure why printing date would be preferable to on-sale sate. E.g. Asimov's first novel was published Jan. 19, 1950 and that's what ISFDB Date shows. If it was determined that the printing had occurred in December, would it be desirable to change that Date field to 1949-12-00? PatConolly 12:54, 16 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nWhat information is the Date field intended to capture? If it is merely the date printed on a magazine as a means of keeping them separate (except for quarterlies which would NOT be separate per current rule), then it's redundant, since the Title field already says something like \"Weird Tales, May 1930\". Why not use it for the date the Title was actually published? This may be a personal quirk, but if Jan 1939 Amazing Stories came out 7 weeks before Jan 1939 Astounding Science Fiction (which it did) I like to know that. I like to know where Quarterlies fit in with the monthly magazines. I like to know whether Winter 1943 means the beginning of 1943 (Jan) or the end of 1943 (Dec). Well, basically I just like to know when things were published in the sense of \"made available to the public\". Hope this wasn't annoyingly long. PatConolly 12:54, 16 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nMy remarks had nothing to do with stating additional information in the notes, sorry if it seemed so. But as for publication dates, we go with the official ones as stated by the publisher, and that means for most (monthly) magazines the month stated with the title. Stonecreek 12:58, 16 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nYes I knew we are only discussing the specific Date field. I have been submitting the dates in the Notes field. And my main objection is not about the Date field for monthly magazines, but the Date field for non-monthly magazines. 1928-00-00 seems objectively less meaningful and informative than 1928-10-20. By the way, after you read the above I removed a mildly inflammatory statement about \"accurate data\" and replaced it with \"Why not use it for the date the Title was actually published?\" (following my point about it redundantly restating what is said in the Title field).PatConolly 13:42, 16 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nTitle Convention for Magazines\n\nHello. I have a question, please: How important is it to follow the convention for magazine titles? It is stated this way:\n\nFor the title of a magazine, the best source is the information (often below the table of contents) about the publisher, giving the address; this often says something like \"IF is published monthly by . . . .\" If this is not present, the magazine cover and the heading on the contents page are about equal in priority; again take a good guess.\n\nI'm asking because I've noticed that some issues of Analog do not follow the convention. For example, the title for the October 1960 issue is recorded as Analog Science Fact -> Fiction, which matches the large heading on the contents page (which is the secondary choice for a title). However, it does not match the information paragraph, which says \"Analog Science Fact & Fiction is published monthly by . . . .\"\n\nAs another example, the information paragraphs in the current issues of Analog read: \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact (Astounding) . . . published bimonthly by . . . .\", but they are listed as only Analog Science Fiction and Fact in the ISFDB. In this case, the information paragraph is on the editorial page rather than the table of contents page. This alternate title is mentioned in the ISFDB publication notes for the first two issues of 2018.\n\nI'm happy to submit these changes and similar ones from my Analog collection if they are wanted, or perhaps someone would like to propose a change to the convention. Or maybe it can all be left as is.\n\nPlease advise and accept my thanks for your answers. --Main 19:44, 18 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nLooks like your query slipped through the cracks! Your link above doesn't work for me but this one has the title info you referenced. It looks like you're exactly right. Someone with higher seniority than I have will hopefully shed some light but I notice that there are conventions that are used that don't stick by the rules here that become sort of de facto rules that are only learned by using the site a lot. It may be a matter of it looks less cluttered in the display listings without the added \"(Astounding)\". I'll ask MLB and Hauck who do a lot of Analog entries for their take on this and see if they'll join. Doug / Vornoff 15:10, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nJohn W. Campbell reportedly hated the Astounding name, and if so, I can only wonder what he would think of this continued discussion. However, be that is it may, the cover states Analog Science Fiction and Fact, this is repeated on the title/contents page, while the headers just simplify everything as Analog. The (Astounding) part is only listed in the indicia. Not sure what the Statement of Ownership says, but personally, despite this being a good question, I would just keep it as it is. Somebody who has access to their whole collection could check out if Dell Magazines always listed, in their indicia, Analog as it is listed now. Again, I'm for keeping it as is. Still, I'm just a working bee here, the ultimate decision will be somebody else's. MLB 22:13, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\n(unindent) What do you think the name of Fiyah magazine should be? They don't have a header at the top of their contents page; at the bottom it says ©Fiyah Literary Magazine. On the cover it says \"Fiyah Magazine of Black Speculative Fiction\" and they also start off every editorial by saying \"Welcome to Issue (number) of Fiyah Magazine of Black Speculative Fiction.\" Should we just ask the magazine staff which is their name? --Vasha 23:53, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nMark, I have a gap in my Analogs from 84 to 97 so the earliest Dell Analog I have is October 97 and the title over the contents as well as the cover both say \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\" and the indicia has, again, \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact (Astounding)\". There seems to be some kind of leeway in the rules and with the amount of people that have verified these issues it seems the consensus would be to keep it as is. I like it that way as well - it's a lot cleaner.\n\nAnd Vasha, I'd vote for \"Fiyah Magazine of Black Speculative Fiction\". There is no real indicia or contents page header apparently, so the next logical thing would be the cover, plus it gives you a good idea of what the mag is about, rather than just \"Fiyah\". Doug / Vornoff 00:52, 24 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nFormat pb vs. tp - interim solution for German publications\n\nContinuing the discussion from above about Rules_and_standards_discussions#Format_pb_vs._tp which was left open with an unresolved proposal, and because \"'pb' or not, that's the question\" is a recurring problem with submissions for German publications, I suggest to add Chrstian's proposal from above as an exception rule for German publications to Template:PublicationFields:Format until a more generic solution has been found. Here it is again (I amended to values in inch to exactly fit the values in cm and added \"or smaller\"):\n\nSince the histories and dimensions for the mass market paperbacks are slightly different for different countries, there are the following exceptions:\n\nGerman paperbacks (\"Taschenbuch\" in German) / trade paperbacks (\"Paperback\" in German):\n\nFor books at least as tall as 19.01 cm (7.48\") and at least as wide / deep as 11.5 cm (4.53\") use \"tp\".\n\nFor books as tall as 19 cm or smaller, generally \"pb\" should be used. Exception:\n\nFor books as tall as 19 cm or smaller, but with a width equal or higher than the height, \"tp\" should be used.\n\nJens Hitspacebar 06:03, 24 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nI knew I was forgetting something! As per our last discussion, I changed the way publication formats are handled internally a few months ago. I was going to post to the effect that the enhancement should make it easy to add new formats going forward, but then it slipped my mind. Sorry about that! We can add \"taschenbuch\" to the standard drop-down list if desired. Ahasuerus 11:14, 24 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nOh, very cool! And no worries, we all forget things :) \"Taschenbuch\" would be a great addition. As per discussion in Rules_and_standards_discussions#Format.2Fbinding_-_proposed_software_change) we should on one hand indeed leave out \"German\" in order to include other German-speaking countries in this term. On the other hand, here comes the tricky part: we'd also need something similar for \"trade paperback\", but they are called \"Paperback\" (sic!) in German, which will certainly lead to confusion with the standard \"pb\". Therefore it's probably necessary to call it \"Paperback (German)\" for disambiguation with \"pb\". With \"(German)\" at the end we also imply other German-speaking countries (opposed to a term like \"German Paperback\", which rather implies paperbacks in Germany only). If we decide to use \"Paperback (German)\" we should probably also use \"Taschenbuch (German)\" for consistency. Jens Hitspacebar 05:38, 25 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nI am afraid I don't know enough about these formats to have an opinion, so I'll defer to the experts. (We may want to wait a week for Christian to come back from hiatus.) Ahasuerus 11:08, 25 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nOk. I leave a message on his talk page. Jens Hitspacebar 11:32, 25 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nHello Jens! I can only say that I completely agree with Herve's point of view [1].If someone thinks that common sense leads to chaos, then a solution is barely achievable. It will always be searched to find new pitfalls. A solution-oriented discussion is no longer happening. I am in favour that everything should stay as it is. Rudolf 15:02, 26 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nI fully understand Hervé's point regarding complexity, and I'm also ok with not adding new formats, as long as we somehow get rid of the recurring discussions about \"tp or pb?\" for German publications. If we leave everything as it is they will never stop and will be wasting time again and again. I currently don't see any other solution than to at least add a special rule (without adding new formats) for German sizes, as initially proposed above. If we don't, especially most of newer German paperbacks (\"Taschenbuch\") will all have to be changed to \"tp\" - which they are definitely not (that's what I meant with \"common sense\" on Wolfram's page). If there's another, better solution - count me in! :) Jens Hitspacebar 15:24, 26 March 2018 (EDT)\n\nI am fond of the labels \"Paperback (German)\" & \"Taschenbuch (German)\", which really seem to be the most consistent. Thanks for your efforts, Christian Stonecreek 00:51, 3 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nBefore this peters out unresolved again and to sum it up it seems there are the following different solutions/opinions:\n\nLeave everything as it is (please no).\n\nOnly add a rule exception for the German formats to the help, but don't add a new entry in the selectable list of formats. That's actually my initial proposal above. This needs no software change except for the the mouseover help which would become language-specific, and it would be sufficient to solve the problem. However, as for the sizes, I just dug around a bit and it looks like the current \"official\" German definition of \"trade paperback\" is quite different from my original proposal: according to these sources, a \"trade paperback\" for the German market must be at least as tall as 20.5 cm and must have inner flips on front and back cover. That's it. Everything else is just \"paperback\", no matter how tall or wide. Sources (all in German, sorry): buchreport.de, vlb.de, boersenblatt.de.\n\nAdd new formats for the German market (which, admittedly, adds complexity which may not be necessary considering options #2 and #4, and would also require to correct the format of all German pub records with softcovers).\n\nOnly add one new format: \"sc\" for \"softcover\". Wolfram and I think Annie also proposed something similar as well recently. With additional fields for width and height (and maybe an option to choose \"inch\" or \"cm\") it would provide all we need for cases which don't match the current pub format rules. Personally I'd prefer to get rid of the distinction between \"pb\" and \"tp\" altogether and only keep \"sc\", but I highly doubt that this is going to happen :) So, this would be \"pb\", \"tp\" and \"sc\" for softcovers to choose from, and you'd use \"sc\" if you can't make a clear decision regarding \"pb\" or \"tp\".\n\nI'm in favour of #2, though #3 or #4 should probably be considered in the long run if more and more non-English pubs are added from markets which have other pub formats and can't be handled with just \"tp\" and \"pb\". Jens Hitspacebar 16:15, 9 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nHello Jens, meanwhile, I have the opinion, that we must include all countryspecific formats (worldwide).--Wolfram.winkler 13:58, 19 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nIt seems to be too complicated, therefore only softcover/hardcover and the dimensions height/width/thickness...--Wolfram.winkler 05:46, 27 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nI agree. Come on, please, let us vote, so that there is finally a result.--Wolfram.winkler 08:07, 29 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nI am not sure how we would go about it since we have 4 options on the table and 4 editors with different takes on it. I have left a message on Jens's Talk page to see if he would like to revisit this issue. Ahasuerus 16:23, 29 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nRewriting \"Exception for works which have illustrations preceding their title pages\"\n\nForgive me if my links and formatting are not ideal. I'm a newb.\n\nThis rule is not well written and should be changed. Template:PubContentFields:Page reads in part: Exception for works which have illustrations preceding their title pages - If a magazine presents artwork for a story or essay preceding the piece's title page, and it is apparent that the art accompanies the text, the starting page of the story or essay should be the page number of the artwork which illustrates it. If you're creating content records for both the work and its illustration, they would have the same starting page. (See \"Sorting\" below for multiple works appearing on the same page.) If there is no indication that the artwork is related to the text on the succeeding pages, and no indication in the table of contents that it illustrates the work, then do not count it as the first page of the work.\n\nThe initial use of the word \"works\" causes confusion. Let us consider any Easton Press published novel. Nearly all Easton Press novels include an illustration on page i or ii, preceding the first page of the story text by several pages. As written, the rule above says first page of the story should be listed as i or ii, because the novel is a \"work,\" the artwork is for the story, and the artwork precedes the \"piece's title page.\" One potential literal interpretation of the current rule leads to nonsense. A book with length [viii+232] could have a story length of 238 with the first page an illustration on iii, and 5 of those 238 pages being either blank or containing the colophon and other front matter.\n\nFor any work which has an introductory illustration, it should be included in the story's page count only if it immediately precedes the text of the story. Otherwise a preceding illustration listed as the first page could create a situation in which the illustration, 3 pages of ads, 2 blank pages, and an introductory essay included in a story's length. This very situation has just occurred on data I entered, with a moderator citing the rule as it is currently written (above), insisting on including an illustration and a blank page in a novel's length. (That is not how I read the current rule, but I'm not a moderator.)\n\nThe rule does make sense for magazines or collections that often include introductory art for a story.\n\nSuggested changes: \"magazine\" to \"publication\" and \"preceding\" to \"immediately preceding\".\n\nThe rule would then read: Exception for works which have illustrations preceding their title pages - If a publication presents artwork for a story or essay immediately preceding the piece's title page, and it is apparent that the art accompanies the text, the starting page of the story or essay should be the page number of the artwork which illustrates it.\n\nThis is my first suggested change to the editing rules and standards. If my organization of this suggestion is off-base, forgive me.MartinStever\n\nHi, and welcome. I like your proposed rewording. --MartyD 06:58, 15 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nIt's been my understanding that this exception only applies to magazines which is certainly where this situation occurs most often. How have other editors interpreted it? --Ron ~ RtraceTalk 08:50, 15 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nThis wording makes sense for illustrated stories in anthologies and collections, but not so much for novels. We already have rules for how to deal with illustrations on unnumbered pages in novels. So instead of \"publication,\" how about \"magazine, anthology, or collection\"? --Vasha 12:49, 15 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI am a bit rusty in this area, so perhaps it's a dumb question, but better safe than sorry. What is the rule for illustrations on unnumbered pages in novels, please? Ahasuerus 12:20, 21 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI was just wondering the same. I cannot think of a specific rule off the top of my head at the moment... Annie 19:38, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI was just thinking of the rules in that same Regular Titles section which say to derive a page number and put it in brackets or use designations like fp, bp. Not actually any help in the current discussion. --Vasha 19:53, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nIt's irrelevant here - this specific case here is for using the page number of one element to denote another one (the art page number to be used as a story/essay page number). Deriving numbers is clear (so if the art is there and not numbered, count and bracket it). I wonder if Martin is not conflating the two things as well a bit (because of the Easton Press example). The rule does not say \"for example, if a a magazine\". It specifically talks about magazines (and it is a lot to do with the way American and British magazines use artwork if you ask me). Anyway - back to the question at hand. Annie 20:01, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nYes, that seems to fit most. Stonecreek 14:02, 15 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI like Vasha's suggested change to my suggested change.MartinStever\n\nThis is my first time participating in a rules and standards discussion. How are they concluded? MartinStever\n\nSome discussions linger on, never coming to a conclusion.... In a case like this, where there's no apparent opposition, I suggest you \"move the question\": Post an out-dented summary statement of what was agreed to above and provide a full quote of your final proposed wording, plus a deadline for any objections (e.g., a few days or a week). When your deadline passes and no objections have been raised, edit the help text and update the change log. --MartyD 08:13, 21 April 2018 (EDT)\n\n(unindent) I think clarifying that this exception only applies to interior art pieces which immediately precede the works that they illustrate would be useful. I am a bit leery about enumerating the publication types to which this exception applies since it would be likely to make things more complicated. For example, does the word \"magazines\" also cover fanzines in this case? What about non-fiction? Etc. Ahasuerus 12:25, 21 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nAn issue that has maybe been overlooked is that the passage MartinStever highlighted is in the section on how to enter Regular Titles. So some of this discussion (including some of the things I said) is moot. Novel titles in publications with type NOVEL are not usually treated as the kind of regular titles that need page numbers, but they can be--for example, if there are also introductions or afterwords. So in that case, it is necessary to decide which page to say that the novel begins on. I don't know why the exception was written to apply to only magazines. Martin's proposed change actually works, without enumerating which publication types it applies to, if we understand that it applies to novels only if we need to decide which page the novel text begins on for some reason.\n\nI don't see any guidelines stating what to do if a story in an anthology/collection has a separate title page. The usual practice is to use the title page number, right? Is that stated somewhere I overlooked? That should be added, maybe as a section before \"Pages without a printed number.\" Say, \"Content items with a title page immediately before the text -- The item should be given the page number of the title page.\" Then, the exception will make sense in the form Martin proposed. --Vasha 16:27, 21 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nIt is not just fanzines - what happens when we have omnibuses that reprint (or rebind) magazines/fanzines? Do we change the number of pages compared to when they are single entities? What about stories added to a novel or collections that are essentially one novel and multiple stories. And then we have the not so uncommon anthology -> magazine conversion and vice versa - some of the publications we have are clearly one or the other; some are not and something conversion may be needed based on additional research. Having different rules for magazines and anthologies made this conversion especially weird if one applied the rule just for magazines).\n\nHow about we look at that from a different angle - instead of trying to define the containers, define the TYPES which first page changes based on a preceding interior art - short fiction, essay, serial, poem (don't forget the poems - they do not get art that often but they do now and then). That's it, isn't it? Covers all the cases and I think is what MartinStever was going for. Annie 18:24, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nActually no, we have to decide what page a novel, anthology or collection begins on if it's in an omnibus. So it's all regular titles that have page numbers. --Vasha 19:17, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nThen add novel and non-fiction if so you wish - the same applies. Don't list the containers, list the types for which this applies. Or we are bound to find a corner case again or end up in the same situation.\n\nAlthough we also need to be very careful - we have quite a lot of publications already and moving this rule from \"magazines\" to \"any/most publication(a)\" will invalidate the page numbers in a lot of them - because strictly speaking the rule specifically specifies magazines at the moment (not even fanzines). Interpretation had differed I am sure and I usually would stretch it to fanzines but the rest of the types? Tricky and a bit too stretchy (despite my grumbling for being a bit illogical above). It may be logical to change it but such a change is not trivial and changing such rules in the middle of a project are bound to backfire. And quite honestly I would rather have consistency in the DB than try to \"make it correct\". Maybe a few of the people with larger collections may chime in on how this had been interpreted by looking at some real books (collections and anthologies) and their records here and see just how different the page numbers will be. As for the Easton Press - I would not count the start that front piece as the start of the text... Just my 2 cents. Annie 19:30, 23 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nAfter sleeping on it, I think I share Annie's concerns.\n\nAs an aside, it occurs to me that there is a noticeable difference between the way we enter interior art in books as opposed to magazines. When entering magazines, we generally enter each illustration as a separate INTERIORART record and assign pages to each one. On the other hand, when entering books, we often enter all illustrations as a single INTERIORART title. That's how it was done in the publication which prompted this discussion: according to the Note field, there are seven illustrations, but we have only one INTERIORART title. Help supports both ways of entering illustrations, but in practice the former way is more common on the magazine side of the database. It may be one of the reasons why this Help exception was originally created. Ahasuerus 21:26, 24 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nSure, that makes sense. But we still do have to add a line to that paragraph about whether or not to give the page number of a story (etc.) in an anthology as that of the preceding half-title page if there is one. Note that sometimes the title may be printed on the half-title page and at the top of the story text. --Vasha 22:24, 24 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nThe rule now says \"magazines\". Which is different from anthologies so it does not apply for anthologies. I am not sure why should we add anything more if the rule remains only for magazines... Or am I missing a place where it is unclear - because if you read the exclusion rule, it is very clear: \"If a magazine\" - not \"for example if a magazine\"... If you are advocating for adding a new exception for other types - then this is a separate topic but my concern above about existing data applies to it... Annie 22:39, 24 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nMy apologies for branching off to a different topic-- this is something that I noticed while reading the help section looking for info about the illustration question. I will start a different thread for the half-title issue. --Vasha 22:51, 24 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI'm jumping back to address Annie's comment of 24 April 2018 (I was on an 11-day road trip, no isfdb time while traveling). My reason for suggesting this rule change was based on an edit I submitted that was rejected. An interior illustration of a novel appearing two pages before the start of the story was listed as the starting page. I don't see that as the initial page. The moderator in question claimed this rule we're discussing applies to novels as well as magazines. That interpretation does not make sense to me. In order to correct the situation it seems that either a) the moderator should be informed the rule only applies to magazines and the rule is tweaked to make \"magazine only\" more clear; b)the rule is clarified to say \"immediately preceding,\" which makes sense to me as I can picture many magazines and anthologies with illustrations including a title to lead off a story (which we called a splash page when I worked in publishing); c) the rule be left alone, which as written means Easton Press novels start on page i or ii.MartinStever 19:03, 7 May 2018 (EDT)\n\npage numbers section of Help:Screen:NewPub -- half-title pages\n\nCurrently, the help screen talking about how to find the page number of content titles doesn't mention what to do if there is a half-title page (with the story title on it) preceding a story or essay or a novel in an omnibus, etc. We should probably add a sentence like \"If the title is on a separate page from the beginning of the text, use the page number of the title.\" And we should also make clear what to do in the uncommon case that there is a title at the top of the text and a half-title page preceding it. I do not know, myself, what the decision would be in that case -- although using the number of the half-title page makes sense. In that case, it would be \"If the title is on a separate page from the beginning of the text, use the page number of the title page, even if the title is also printed at the top of the text.\" --Vasha 22:57, 24 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nEditor vs author data for OMNIBUS/ANTHOLOGY?\n\nAs I thought it of general interest, I've moved discussion from Willem's talk page to here for broader discussion. There's actually two topics here, so may want/need to split up:\n\nWhat to choose: editor vs author data in editor/author field of an OMNIBUS or ANTHOLOGY record, and\n\nAmbiguity in field name depending on edit mode\n\nHello Willem. I suggest to remove the editors (Scott Card & Tanith Lee) from this publication since the actual editor is not known of this (two-story-long) anthology, and to add an explanatory note to clarify why. This way I feel it's more correct. Can you agree? Regards. MagicUnk 18:50, 26 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nSorry, but I don't agree. The helptext has no specific rule for this case, but I think the rule for a multi-author OMNIBUS that has no editor credit (and no secondary source for the editor credit) comes closest, so it should be credited to the authors. --Willem 16:40, 27 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nI think an omnibus customarily requires/has an editor, and since there isn't one identified it is still better to enter ‘uncredited’ because the author(s) are not necessarily the editor, and if you do enter authors in the editor field it is in any case redundant information as author information is already available from the 'Regular Titles' section.\n\nThat said, when I took a closer look at the data I noticed that its pub type is actually ANTHOLOGY (which is correct as per Pub Type definition page as far as I can tell). But regardless, same argument holds for ANTHOLOGY I'd think: editor=uncredited, authors identified in the 'Regular Titles' section so as not to end up with redundant information, but actually ending up with more information instead .\n\nAnd, while looking into the records some more I noticed something else that struck me as odd; when in editing mode the Tweesprook 2 Title Record says 'authors' while in editing mode, and displays 'editors' when not in editing mode. Same observation holds for Tweesprook 2 Publication Record : ‘editors’ when displayed and ‘authors’ in its Publication Metadata section when editing the record. There’s even more: 'editor' is used as field name when adding a new ANTHOLOGY record in its title section. Question for Ahasuerus perhaps?\n\nThoughts? MagicUnk 10:20, 29 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nTrying to make a single rule for two vastly different types is not very useful here.\n\nFor omnibuses - the authors of the individual books collected into the omnibus are the authors of the omnibus. Don't forget that we use omnibus for all kinds of box sets and other multi-books and multi-works publications as well. But it is always about books that had been published before Leaving something uncredited or attributing to some \"editor\" does not make sense - add that to the notes if you want to but unless the editor is very prominent on the title page, the authors of the collected books are the authors of an omnibus (the corner case of an omnibus where you have 2 novels and 10 stories is a bit different but if they are from the same author, I would rather use the author name). We may have somewhat confusing UI in places for that but leaving an omnibus uncredited or crediting to a house editor is a bit against any logic of how this DB works.\n\nAnthologies are quite different - there you always have an editor and if it is not credited, it needs to be set to uncredited.\n\nSo let's not try to discuss omnibuses and anthologies as if they are the same thing? Think of the omnibuses the same way you think of novels - these have editors as well but you are not advocating to make them the authors, right? Annie 17:03, 2 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nI do think that fiction OMNIBUSes are very similar to anthologies if they collect works by different authors (just as they are similar to COLLECTIONs when all the significant works are by the same author), they just have NOVELs instead of SHORTFICTION, and it in my opinion it does look more odd to have authors who may be already dead in place of getting together to edit it (because edited they were, and we should mirror that fact). Stonecreek 23:39, 2 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nBooks like this have been in the database for ages, no questions asked. Is it strange that I treat this one the same way? --Willem 14:53, 3 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nNo, it ain't. But maybe we should stick to the good old rule as to index what is stated on the title page. There are some who only state the titles of the container titles, and others (like this), who credit an active editor other than the authors of the novels. Stonecreek 15:28, 3 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nThat's what the rules say. If an editor had been credited for Tweesprook, his/her name would be in the author field. But there isn't. --Willem 15:31, 3 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nThat's exactly the point. The authors are in the editor field of the anthology example. Card and Lee haven't edited this anthology, so the current entry is 'wrong'. Sticking to anthology for a moment, I think you can agree having an editor makes sense so has to go in the editor field-uncredited if not known, and the authors mentioned with their respective contributions.\n\nRereading what I wrote earlier, I agree with Annie that omnibuses can be/are to be treated separately. And for omnibusers there's no editor field, but an author field instead (leaving aside the strange observation on field names when editing or creating a new record I mentioned earlier, which needs to be fixed eventually) . So in short editor for anthologies, authors for omnibuses, as that's what the field labels say too. MagicUnk\n\nI think this is a side effect of the fact that these doubles are anthologies by name only (aka - these two are \"short novels\" and if they were longer they would have been omnibuses. The one that started this whole discussion (I just looked at it again) is exactly like this in my mind and I would much rather keep the two authors up in the field than go for uncredited (if there was one that was credited on the title page, that would be different). There is a big difference between an anthology like Dozois's Year's Best and this kind of doubles (which are anthologies in name only). Just thinking aloud. :) I am leaning towards leaving the authors as editors in this case if no other editor is mentioned anywhere... Annie 16:42, 3 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nBut why would we want to put authors in an editor field if we have author information in the contents section already? (apart from the anthology-in-name-only, that is :-). As I see it, using the editor field strictly for editor(s) when there's one, conveys more information than what you would get by repeating the authors MagicUnk 11:27, 4 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nFor proper anthologies? We would not - we put the editor in for these, uncredited if none is specified. And in your case we were not even discussing an editor - it was going to uncredited. Now - what kind of information does this convey? That the publisher cannot be bothered to name their editor? :) These anthologies in name only seem to be the main problem here, right? So let's just do the usual - if an editor is prominent on the title page, use that; if only the two author names are there, use that. It matches both our practice and the rules... Annie 12:09, 4 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nYes exactly: uncredited = publisher couldn't be bothered :-) Still not convinced it's the right thing to do, but as it looks like there's no consensus to the proposed change, I'll go with the current practice (btw, I couldn't find the relevant rule you're referring to, can you get me a pointer?) MagicUnk 16:48, 4 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nThat's what the notes are for :) The rule that we go with the title page? :) That's the one I am referring to (and the only rule we have around what names and titles to use) - sorry if it was not very clear what I meant. I can understand where you are coming from - it is just that our anthology type is a bit of a catch all which makes it a bit weird sometimes. Annie 16:53, 4 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nA novell devided into multiple titles.\n\nWhat is the procedure with this? I have Frank Herbert's Dune divided into three books. Debolestis 15:58, 2 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nAdd the books one by one as regular novels and then variant all 3 into the full novel. The French novels suffer from that a lot :) Annie 16:05, 2 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nPS: Here is an example: The Snow Queen. See how the Portuguese titles are added? Annie 16:07, 2 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nDoes this relate to this discussion? ../Doug H 16:25, 2 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nNo - the one you linked is about how to date the original when it was published in pieces. This question is asking how to enter a translation that had been published in parts - the original already has a date and each of the parts here will get its own date (as it will be a separate title). So not related at all. Annie 16:52, 2 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nOK, I now have these 3 titles, http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?663964, http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?663965, http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?663966. Do I add them all as variants of Dune? Do I need to merge them later? Debolestis 14:30, 3 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nYes, you make them variants of Dune (I actually would change the Title record to contain information that it is volume 1 of 3 for example (not the publication title but the title itself)). No, you do not merge them - they stay separate - the same way the 2 Portuguese ones in my example are. Annie 16:45, 3 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nAuthor or Authors\n\nOn the title page appears \"Author\" on the publication page \"Authors\".

If no one makes a decision, the discussion will never ends.\n\nAt the time I wrote that:\n\nMost of our decisions are made after reaching consensus. The downside of this approach to decision-making is that there are times when we can't reach consensus, so things remain hanging for a long time. The upside is that we are less likely to lock ourselves into a solution which may prove unworkable or counterproductive in the long run. I find our current approach generally superior to the alternatives which we tried in the past.\n\nWould you suggest abandoning the consensus approach and appointing a single person who would be responsible for making decisions about our data entry policies, project scope, software design, etc? Ahasuerus 11:57, 20 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nI prefer a consensus approach, if it's the consensus of the majority. A few times in the past it only took one, angry, shouting person to derail the process.--Rkihara 15:58, 20 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nWe usually define \"consensus\" as \"significant majority\". 4-3 wouldn't be considered consensus, but 8-2 would. In my experience, a slim majority often indicates that the proposed solution may not be ideal and that a better solution may be possible. Ahasuerus 16:16, 24 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nI meant that someday somebody should make a decision if there is no democratic majority. And this can only be an administrator.

Broer with regard to Eddy Von Mueller. This author is American and his last name, legally in the US, is \"Von Mueller.\" Dirk argued that his directory entry should be \"Mueller\" and wrote, \"The directory entry is the place where you look for the author in a library or store. I go to the ’M’ shelf for von Mueller.\" But I'm not sure about that. Shouldn't the directory entry be the actual last name?\n\nNote that the same problem arises for \"De\" names. The \"De\" is included in the last name in some countries, e.g. US & Italy, and not others, e.g. France. --Vasha 06:34, 11 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nI believe we had this discussion a couple of years ago. The US standard is to include the prefix, i.e. \"Von Mueller\" rather than \"Mueller\", in indices and directories. Other countries' standards vary, sometimes even within one country. For example, here is what the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions says in Names of Persons: National Usages for Entry in Catalogs about \"van\":\n\nIf the person is Dutch, \"van Beukering\" should be sorted under B\n\nIf he or she is Belgian, sort it under V (but note the small print that says Belgian libraries aren't consistent across the country)\n\nIf they're from the US, sort it under V\n\nAhasuerus 09:29, 11 May 2018 (EDT)\n\n* If the person is Dutch, \"van Beukering\" should be sorted under B.\n\nThat is right, and the directory entry (\"Beukering\") takes care of that. The family name is \"van Beukering\" and the legal name field takes care of that.--Dirk P Broer 19:08, 11 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nOdd one (Bruce Sterling)\n\nSterling has a story that was likely written in English first, then first published in Japanese, and latter published in English and other languages.

At the time there was one editor who objected to my doing this. A compromise was suggested that such numbers be put below a {{BREAK}} tag, which I did adopt (once I learned what the tag was and how it is used) and a FR was created to add such numbers much as to a dedicated field as we now do with External IDs (perhaps it was the same FR). Regardless, there was no consensus at the time, or I believe since, that the addition of such numbers to the notes was prohibited. Today, I discovered that Reginald and Bleiler Early Years numbers that I added to this publication have been deleted. If I am mistaken, and this data is prohibited, I'll stop doing this. If it is not, what is our policy on the deletion of allowed data that an editor does not like? If editors should not be deleting allowed data, what is the recourse when they do so contrary to policy and etiquette. I am aware of this instance, but I wonder whether other data has been deleted without establishing a policy first. --Ron ~ RtraceTalk 22:03, 3 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nWhile I was moving OCLC, LCCN and other external numbers out from notes, I made a point of keeping these where they were and cleaning the br's and what's not around them (and even pinging the verifier if one of the numbers was missing while it looked like it was supposed to be there). I think that they are useful information and if someone is deleting them, then we are losing information. Just my 2 cent.\n\nPlus if one day we DO have a new field, finding the data again is much harder than just moving it. Annie 22:21, 3 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nThe Bleiler indexes do not have catalog #s, all that's being added is a page #, more than useless. We already have verification spots for all the Bleilers and Reginalds, none of which have any online source nor are they likely to. Adding Reginald's numbers or a page # adds nothing, what's next, adding the line from Locus? The ONLY verification source which also has an external ID spot is OCLC, as they can have multiple records even for a single edition [some worthwhile, many not] and that was the only reason for putting their record numbers in the notes in the first place. I thought the purpose for having the external ID slots was to remove links/numbers/clutter from the notes. If a particular datum has been gleaned from one or more of these external sources, by all means that should remain in the notes, but the number/link should still be removed [what's the point of having it there twice?]. The original discussion noted above had four participants, three of whom thought these 'identifiers' to be nothing but clutter, the fourth that any secondary sources shouldn't be present if the record is primary verified [like that's likely to be implemented ...]. They're still just clutter. --~ Bill, Bluesman 12:55, 13 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nthe suffix Jr.\n\nDo we standardize the suffix, no matter how it is written in the book (if it appears as \"John Jones jr.\" do we enter \"John Jones, Jr.\")? --Vasha 13:47, 5 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nYes. See \"Ranks, suffixes, prefixes\" in Template:PublicationFields:Author (last bullet). -- JLaTondre (talk) 16:44, 5 June 2018 (EDT)\n\n[Copied from here --Vasha] Yes, but I understand that this is an English / American regulation that doesn't necessarily apply for other language authors (though this is not made clear in the help). So it seems that James Tiptree jr. (as published with many titles) is regularized because we want to avoid unnecessary pseudonyms, but other authors should not be, especially when there's no English involved. Christian Stonecreek 03:05, 6 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nAre there examples of non-English names that use \"Jr.\", etc.? ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe 12:44, 6 June 2018 (EDT)\n\na few :) Annie 12:47, 6 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nKeep in mind that we use the same rule for other suffixes like \"III\" even though it's not a standard English practice.\n\nIf I recall correctly (I am not 100% sure since it's been about 10 years), the original reason for this blanket rule was the way our software behaves when parsing new author names: it considers anything after the last comma to be a \"suffix\" and populates the Directory Entry field accordingly.\n\nIn retrospect, it may not have been a very good reason. We shouldn't be creating data entry standards based on the way the software behaves -- it should be the other way around. Ahasuerus 13:11, 6 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nNovels published ONLY as serials\n\nAs per the date rules for serials, a novel takes its date from its first publishing in book form. What do we do when the book never made it to a book form? 0000-00-00 or 8888-00-00? I can see it both ways but wanted to ask (and we need this rule updated for that). Thanks! Annie 17:48, 11 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nI think the majority of our \"phantom\" NOVEL titles for unreprinted SERIALs use the date of the first SERIAL publication. (Parenthetically, I still think that there is got to be a better way to handle the SERIAL/NOVEL date mess in the software, but it's not a high priority at the moment.) Ahasuerus 18:27, 11 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nSo should we add a note to that effect in the help page? Annie 18:30, 11 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nIt may be prudent to ask some of our \"pulp\" editors who have been active lately to be sure. I haven't entered any pulps in a long time. Ahasuerus 18:44, 11 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nNot a bad idea. I was moderating around this one today and it came up - I went for 8888-00-00 initially (Vasha went for first serial date which the help page explicitly says not to do), then I decided changed it to 0000-00-00 and then decided to come and ask because neither of the 3 looks correct. I had never edited or moderated such a case before - so I was reading the help page and working based on that. :) If noone shows up in a day or so, I will ping some directly on their pages. Annie 18:49, 11 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nI tend to give these cases the date of the end of the serial, but with only year precision. Thus in the example you cite, I would have dated it \"1934-00-00\". When the serial spans years, I go with the later one. I'm not wedded to this approach. Of the two that you mention I would think that 8888-00-00 makes more sense insofar as the book publication was never published, rather than the date of that publication not being known. --Ron ~ RtraceTalk 19:52, 11 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nI like this approach even if it goes against the help pages (plus that won't send the novel at the bottom of the author's list). Probably we should add a line in the help page about that specific case considering that we already have a big note about serialization of novels and dating around them. Annie 14:07, 12 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nIf there are no objections, I will change Help later this week. Ahasuerus 10:03, 21 June 2018 (EDT)\n\n(unindent) Is it still appropriate that the mouseover text for 8888-00-00 is \"announced but never published\"? By now, it is being used not just for that case, but quite often to record the original title of something that's only been published in translation. And here we have yet a third kind of unpublished title. --Vasha 09:23, 12 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nIt would be easy to change the mouseover text, but we would want to agree on the data entry rules and update Help first in order to keep everything in sync. Ahasuerus 13:59, 12 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nOutcome\n\nI have made a number of changes to Help:Use of the SERIAL type‎, Help:How to connect serials to titles‎ and Template:TitleFields:TitleType to reflect the outcome of this discussion and to eliminate all vestiges of the infamous \"lexical match\" logic. Back when we changed the software, I reviewed our Help pages and deleted all explicit references to \"lexical match\", but apparently I missed a number of indirect or implied references. Without the original context, they muddled the waters and made the affected Help pages hard to follow. Sorry about that!\n\nHopefully the updated Help makes sense. Ahasuerus 17:13, 23 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nAlternate (as opposed to sub) titles.\n\nThe current rule explains how to enter a title that has a subtitle. Would the same rule apply to alternate titles? An example is \"Five Weeks in a Balloon; or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen.\" (in 4 variations of font style and size).\n\nIf so, would the \"; or,\" be replaced by a \":\"? Could the consensus be included in the help entry? ../ Doug H 15:08, 18 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nWe actually have quite a lot of these (they were kinda common in the past) and the current practice is to threat the whole thing as a title - not as a title/subtitle. That's a search for Title contains \"; or,\". Annie 15:22, 18 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nWhat's the thinking on how to punctuate it if the title page isn't clear on that? Like, if it's written one above the other (Five Weeks in a Balloon / or / Journeys and Discoveries in Africa). I know the old way was \" ... in a Balloon; or, Journeys ...\" and I know that has fallen out of fashion. Nowadays most people use either \"Balloon, or, Journeys\" or \"Balloon, or Journeys.\" Do we have a preferred choice here? --Vasha (cazadora de tildes) 16:04, 18 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nI don't think there is a standard; I have seen it done all kinds of ways. Ahasuerus 10:02, 21 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nOnline publications that are not downloadable\n\nA recent submission which I currently have on hold (the link is moderator-only) has raised the issue of non-downloadable online works yet again. At this time, ISFDB:Policy#Rules of Acquisition are as follows:\n\ndownloadable e-zines are in\n\nweb-based publications (webzines) available only as an HTML readable file are out except when:\n\npublished by a market which makes the author eligible for SFWA membership\n\nshortlisted for a major award\n\nUnder the current rules, the submitted anthology is apparently ineligible even though its contributors include Gregory Benford, Brenda Cooper, Bruce Sterling, Nancy Kress, James Morrow, Margaret Atwood, Karl Schroeder, Paolo Bacigalupi, Mike Resnick, Kevin J. Anderson, Catherine Asaro, and Peter Watts, to name only some of the better-known authors. They probably have a few hundred awards and nominations between them.\n\nWe have discussed this topic a number of times over the last few years. There seems to be general agreement that the policy is outdated because:\n\nit's too US-centric (\"eligible for SFWA membership\")\n\nthe SFWA membership criteria change from year to year\n\nmore and more major SF works appear online as seen in this case\n\nAt the same time there has also been reluctance to start accepting all online publications. As far as I can tell, the reasons are as follows:\n\nthere are literally tens of thousands of stories getting self-published online every year; there are well over 100,000 Twilight fanfics on FanFiction.net alone\n\nHTML-based online publications can be unstable as authors can tweak them whenever they want to (hence the \"downloadable\" rule that we currently have in place); they can also be taken down abruptly for copyright and other reasons, leaving no trace except, perhaps, at the Internet Archive\n\nmany online works appear as Web serials with dozens and hundreds of installments, which our software is poorly equipped to handle -- see the ever-popular Mother of Learning, Worm, Everybody Loves Large Chests, etc\n\nthe serialization problem is further complicated by the recent proliferation of translated serializations -- see Novel Updates, Wuxia World, etc. Different translators and groups of translators may be translating different parts of certain serials, sometimes with a considerable amount of overlap. (Some are machine translations with minimal human editing involved.)\n\nAs far as I can tell, there are two ways we could approach this issue.\n\nThe first approach would be to try and further relax out policy to make it less US-centric and more accepting of online works published by notable authors while trying to keep fanfiction and Web serials out. If we decide to do it, then I think \"stability\" may be one of the more viable (if admittedly subjective) criteria. Author Web sites, publisher Web sites and projects like the one that prompted this discussion are generally fairly stable.\n\nThe second approach would be to throw in the towel and accept -- in theory -- all online publications. It may not be as scary as it sounds. Back when we were considering relaxing our e-book inclusion criteria, we were concerned about a potential flood of ASIN-only ebooks published on Amazon. As it turned out, it hasn't been a significant problem. Just because some works are eligible for inclusion doesn't necessarily mean that there are dozens of people dying to submit them.\n\nSo, what do you think? Ahasuerus 23:29, 26 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe current rules also give smaller languages a lot more leeway - there is no webzine in Bulgarian that publishes fiction that had not been nominated at least once for one of the big awards for"
