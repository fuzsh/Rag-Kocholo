        "text": "[jwplayer o7Lvs2Es-z6KDnl0B]\n\nWhen the calendar flips to July, the NBA offseason usually takes centerstage. Trades, the draft and free agency, cause a storm of news. However, with the NBA’s stretch run still on the docket in the Orlando Bubble, offseason action will be put on hold until October.\n\nWith no hoops on the slate, Warriors Wire is rewinding through Golden State’s offseason history to highlight draft sleepers, memorable trades, standout free agent signings and everything in between.\n\nIn 2010, former Golden State general manager Larry Riley acquired a future All-Star with an early July sign-and-trade.\n\nJuly 8, 2010\n\nComing off an All-Star season averaging a double-double with 20.2 points and 11.7 rebounds per game for the New York Knicks, David Lee became an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2010.\n\nOn July 8, 2010, the Golden State Warriors traded former first-rounder Anthony Randolph, Ronny Turiaf, Kelenna Azubuike and a second-round pick to the New York Knicks for Lee.\n\nIn his first season in the Bay Area, the Florida Gators product averaged 16.5 points, 9.8 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game. In 2012-13, Lee returned to his double-double average with 18.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per contest. Lee’s performance alongside a young Stephen Curry was strong enough to earn the power forward a spot on the All-Star team. Lee became the first member of the Golden State Warriors to receive an All-Star nod since Latrell Sprewell in 1997.\n\nWatch highlights from Lee’s trip to the 2013 All-Star game via YouTube:\n\nAlthough injuries limited his playing time, the two-time All-Star played a reserve role in Golden State’s run to the 2015 NBA Championship. Over 10 minutes per game, Lee added 5.5 points, and 2.5 rebounds against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers."
