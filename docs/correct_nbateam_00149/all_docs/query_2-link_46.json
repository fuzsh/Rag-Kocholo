        "text": "Dr. David I. Lee is a board-certified UCI Health urologist who specializes in prostate cancer surgery. He is the director of the UCI Health Comprehensive Prostate Cancer Program and a nationally regarded leader in robot-assisted prostatectomies, having performed more than 6,300 of the procedures in two decades of practice.\n\nLee earned his medical degree from Loma Linda University School of Medicine in Loma Linda, Calif., where he was elected to the prestigious Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society. After completing a urology residency at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, he received fellowship training in endourology at UCI Medical Center, with an emphasis on laparoscopy, endoscopy, image-guided therapy and robot-assisted surgery, a new technology embraced by the UCI School of Medicine’s Department of Urology under the leadership of then-chair Dr. Ralph Clayman, a pioneer in minimally invasive surgical techniques.\n\nLee began his medical practice in Texas, where he established the first major robot-assisted prostatectomy program in the south-central United States, providing the region’s prostate cancer patients with a minimally invasive surgical option.\n\nHe comes to UCI Health from Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, where he served as chief of urology services, and the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, which recruited him to build its robot-assisted prostatectomy program.\n\nLee is the author or co-author of more than 200 published articles, abstracts and book chapters in the field of minimally invasive urologic surgery. He has also given numerous lectures on urologic health topics."
