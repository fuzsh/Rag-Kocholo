        "text": "David Lee amassed a cool $92m fortune over his 12-year NBA career.\n\nBut not wanting to rest on his laurels, the former Golden State Warriors star retired in 2017 to launch his own insurance startup.\n\nThat same year the 40-year-old proposed to former World No.1 tennis player and 2018 Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2019.\n\nLee attended the University of Florida before he was drafted by the New York Knicks with the 30th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft.\n\nHe spent fives years in 'The Big Apple' before joining the Golden State Warriors in 2010.\n\nThe Dubs' talented young core, led by future MVP Stephen Curry, became the NBA's premier powerhouse during Lee's time with the franchise.\n\nThe versatile power forward/centre formed a formidable front-court partnership with Andrew Bogut but injuries eventually slowed him down.\n\nNevertheless, he was still able to win an NBA championship in 2015 after the Warriors triumphed over LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals.\n\nLee became a two-time All-Star in California but after the high of winning a chip he was traded to the Boston Celtics during the 2015 offseason.\n\nHe later spent time with the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs before hanging up his jersey in 2017.\n\nHe was a virtual double-double machine upon retirement, having averaged 13.5 points per game and 8.8 rebounds across 12 years in the NBA.\n\nDespite his near $100m in career earnings, the Missouri native wasn't content with just sitting on his fortune in retirement.\n\nLee briefly worked at Social Capital Investment in California before co-founding Topsail Re - a privately held reinsurance company where he still serves as a Director.\n\nAway from sport and business, Lee has found a partner in tennis ace Wozniacki.\n\nThe Danish star was the highest ranked female player in the world for 71 weeks between 2010-2011 and the first player from a Scandinavian country to hold the top spot.\n\nThe couple were introduced to each other through mutual friends at a dinner party in Miami, Florida in 2015.\n\nThey became a regular feature at each other's matches and eventually got engaged on a vacation in Bora Bora in 2017.\n\nThe sporting couple got married in 2019 and are the proud parents of two children, daughter Olivia and son James.\n\nWith the Australian Open right around the corner, David will no doubt be in Caroline's corner cheering her on as she attempts to win her second Slam Down Under."
