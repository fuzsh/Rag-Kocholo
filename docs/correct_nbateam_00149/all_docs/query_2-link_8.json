        "text": "Jim Cowsert/Associated Press\n\nAfter getting traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Boston Celtics last offseason, veteran big man David Lee has found a new home with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nPriority Sports announced the decision:\n\nShams Charania of The Vertical reported it's a two-year deal.\n\nLee is a two-time All-Star, and he averaged 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per game last season, which he spent with the Celtics and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLee spent five seasons with the Warriors from 2010-11 through 2014-15, averaging 16.7 points and 9.3 boards per contest during his tenure.\n\nHis usage dropped off significantly in his final campaign in Golden State because of the Dubs' success with a small lineup, resulting in just 7.9 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.\n\nAlthough Lee is no longer the All-Star-caliber player he once was, he is still a capable offensive player who competes on the glass for the Spurs in limited minutes."
