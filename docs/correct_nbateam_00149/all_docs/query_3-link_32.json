        "text": "Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nFormer NBA All-Star David Lee formally announced his retirement in an Instagram post featuring photos of a retirement celebration:\n\nLee, 34, last played for the San Antonio Spurs during the 2016-17 season. He averaged 13.5 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 12 seasons with five teams.\n\nMost of Lee's best basketball came during a five-year run with the Golden State Warriors. He made the All-Star team and was a third-team All-NBA selection in 2013, emerging as one of the league's best offensive big men. Within two years, however, he was watching as Draymond Green usurped him in the starting lineup as the Warriors found their team identity.\n\nThe Warriors then shipped him to the Boston Celtics for a frustrating half season before he landed with the Dallas Mavericks. In Dallas, Lee returned to a high-efficiency role within the offense and seemingly found a niche as an 18- to 20-minute player. His stats last season with the Spurs were also solid, though he remained a bit of a defensive liability.\n\nWhen Lee declined his player option, it seemed likely a team would pick him up for a similar role in their reserve lineup. With no real offers on the table, it appears that Lee has decided instead to hang it up."
