I am now excited to experience something new at WashU. Beyond its standout faculty and residents, I chose WashU for its complete clinical training and collaborative research environment. I also had St. Louis ribs during my visit out here and now understand why people care so much about regional differences in barbecue.\n\nOutside of the hospital, I enjoy time with friends, the Golden State Warriors, Japanese food, and non-Japanese food.\n\nEducation\n\nUndergraduate: Williams College, BA in Chemistry and Political Economy, 2014\n\nMedical School: University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, 2019\n\nMSCI: Washington University in St. Louis, 2022\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nPaparella Research Award for Basic and Clinical Science – 1st Place, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 2023\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Graduate with Distinction, 2019\n\nUCSF RAPtr Summer Research Award Winner, 2015\n\nPublications\n\nPavelchek C, Lee DS, Walia A, Michelson AP, Ortmann A, Gentile B, Herzog JA, Buchman CA, Shew MA.
