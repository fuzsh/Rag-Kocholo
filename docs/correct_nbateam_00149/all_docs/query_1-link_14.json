        "text": "Caroline Wozniacki is back, folks. The former world No. 1 ranked WTA player confirmed that she’s returning to tennis after a 3-year hiatus in a piece she did with Vogue. Wozniacki revealed that she’d retired from the game in 2020 after discovering she had rheumatoid arthritis. She’d worked herself to a point where she could control it by changing her diet and constantly keeping her joints active, but it’d become exhausting. So Wozniacki decided to step away from tennis just two years after she’d won the 2018 Australian Open at 29 years old. She’d spent time with her husband, former NBA player David Lee, and their families. They had a family of their own, too, after having two kids.\n\nBut, of course, to the observer, it felt like there was unfinished business there following Wozniacki’s departure from the game. Wozniacki apparently felt the same, too. She’d gotten the urge to play again. And, it seems, a quick little conversation between Wozniacki and Lee helped her decide to give tennis a shot again.\n\nIt was a full circle moment for Green, who’d started all but two of the 597 games he’s played for the Warriors since Kerr chose him to replace two-time All-Star David Lee in his first season as coach back in 2014. “The biggest thing for me is that I can walk in the room and say, ‘Coach, I need to come off the bench.’ Because I watched David Lee hug me, put his arms around me no matter what the situation was and say, ‘This is what you need to do,'” Green said. “So you can never be the opposite way. “Because my whole thing started on the back of a guy who was an All-Star that said, ‘All right, here’s what you need to do.’\n\nQuentin Richardson on his stint with Knicks: 'The mix was crazy. It was a chaotic culture they came into'\n\nQuentin Richardson: You have to look at the timing of everything. When you throw the names out there, it sounds crazy. When you look at the timing of everything and meshing of everything, it was like mixing oil with (inaudible). You had Larry Brown, who was an all-time great coach, one of my favorite coaches, but we all know coach Brown is one of the most stern coaches there was. You had guys like Jalen Rose, Stephon Marbury, Steve Francis, Kelvin Cato, Jerome James. All these veteran guys were more towards the backend of their careers than their primes. Then you had David Lee and Jamal Crawford. Lee was a rookie when he got there. Nate Robinson was a rookie. Renaldo Balkman was a rookie. The mix was crazy. It was a chaotic culture they came into. That was the reason why everything was going haywire at the time.\n\nThis rumor is part of a storyline: 2 more rumors"
