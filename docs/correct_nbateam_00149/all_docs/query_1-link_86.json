        "text": "Mitchell Robinson’s former NBA agent David Lee fought hard to keep his poaching lawsuit against Raymond Brothers alive, but the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York was not having it. The case that was premised on Brothers inducing Robinson to change agents was dismissed in full and the judge overseeing the […]\n\nThe battle between NBA agents David Lee and Raymond Brothers surrounding New York Knicks big man Mitchell Robinson III is heating up. Earlier this year, Lee initiated a lawsuit against Brothers based on the allegation that Brothers influenced Robinson to change his representation with the promise of a brand-new pickup truck. Lee has claimed that, […]\n\nAgent David Lee has filed papers in the Manhattan Supreme Court to bring a suit against Raymond Brothers of Roc Nation Sports. The claim alleges Brothers bribed New York Knicks center Mitchell Robinson with a free $34,000 Chevy Silverado to sever his contractual agreement with Lee and elect him as his new agent. Lee had […]\n\nOver the weekend, Houston Rockets forward and former Florida Gator Chandler Parsons sent the following Tweet: Shoutout to my dude @RealDealBeal23 for joining the @PrioritySports family. @RealDealBeal23 is former Florida Gator and soon-to-be NBA Draft lottery pick Bradley Beal.

The Wildcats are no push over, though. In fact, the team has one of the best players in the nation with Sophomore Derrick Williams. The kid can flat out […]\n\nIt is well known that I am a Florida Gators fan, but even I could not believe when it was announced that the Gators received the #2 seed in the Southeast bracket. The Gators have an experienced starting line-up with some very talented young players coming off of the bench. Even though the team lost […]\n\nWe are eight days into the month of March, which means that the NCAA Tournament is right around the corner. Before the teams are selected for the Tournament, many schools will battle to earn an automatic berth by winning their respective conference championships. With so much focus on NCAA Basketball, we figured that we would […]\n\nI am not a big fan of “Top __” lists. That said, it is sometimes fun to observe others’ subjective rankings of members in a profession. Kevin Baumer of Business Insider recently created his list of The 12 Most Powerful Agents In The NBA. As for his rankings (with top 3 salaried clients listed): Arn […]"
