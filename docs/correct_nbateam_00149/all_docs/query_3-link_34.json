        "text": "BOSTON – David Lee knows exactly what Celtics fans must be thinking: “Why didn’t he play like that for the Celtics last season?”\n\n“No doubt, I mean no doubt, and I completely understand that,” Lee stated.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 power forward contributed season highs of 15 points and 12 rebounds in only 17-1/2 minutes off the bench to help the Spurs beat the Celtics, 109-103, Friday afternoon at the Garden.\n\nIn his 32 games with the Celtics last season before he was bought out on Feb. 19, Lee’s highs were 14 points and 8 rebounds, but and didn’t even come in the same game. The former two-time All-Star averaged only 7.1 points and 4.3 rebounds while shooting a career-worst 45.3 percent.\n\nLee lost his starting job after three games and didn’t play at all for his final month in Boston. The 12-year veteran freely admits he didn’t report to the Celtics in shape after winning an NBA title with Golden State and getting traded to Boston for Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb.\n\n“Everybody makes mistakes in their career,” he said. “I think I came in not in the best shape and it wasn’t by design, it was not a laziness, it was just, you know, I just didn’t do what I needed to do and I’ve been upfront about acknowledging that. It’s easy to just look at the coaching staff and say, ‘Oh, Brad (Stevens) should have played me more, this and that,’ but I’ve been very open in saying I should have been in better shape and it takes that for me to be successful on the court.”\n\nAfter Lee fell out of the rotation in Boston, he worked with Celtics strength and conditioning coach Bryan Doo and he played better after signing with Dallas on Feb. 22.\n\n“The staff did an unbelievable job,” Lee said, “of getting me in shape here and by that point I think it wasn’t Coach’s wish to play me that much and we went our separate ways.”\n\nWhat made Lee’s boost off the bench Friday even more frustrating for Celtics fans is that it was exactly the kind of performance they need this season. San Antonio became the latest team to manhandle the Celtics on the boards, out-rebounding them, 55-42. San Antonio’s bench outscored Boston’s, 56-30.\n\nLee was 6 of 9 from the field and 3-3 from the line as San Antonio beat the Celtics for the 10th consecutive time. He also grabbed seven offensive rebounds, one less than the entire Celtics team.\n\nThis season, Lee is averaging 7 points and 4.9 rebounds while backing up Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge, but he’s shooting 60 percent. Most importantly, the Spurs are 13-3 and have won eight in a row. They’re also 9-0 on the road.\n\n“He was being active,” Al Horford said. “David is the kind of guy that if you don’t put a body on him, he kind of gets going. He had a good game, give him credit.”\n\nAsked if Lee seemed to have a little extra jump in his step against Celtics, Isaiah Thomas said, “I mean, I don't know why. He only played a couple of games with us. ... He definitely played a (heck) of a game. He had some key plays. He's a veteran who knows how to play. He’s good in their system.”\n\nLee said he didn’t take any added satisfaction in playing well against the team that let him go last season.\n\n“If I had like a personal problem with guys on that team,” he said, “maybe I’d jaw some more, but I still keep in touch with a lot of guys and like them as guys off the court. So it didn’t mean anything personal tonight.”\n\nLee said he said hello to Stevens and every Celtics player before the game and that he regularly exchanges text messages with Jonas Jerebko, Jae Crowder, Amir Johnson and other Celtics.\n\n“Sorry to see R.J. Hunter go,” Lee said. “He was a guy that I kept in touch with a lot. We had the same agent.”\n\nAlthough Lee didn’t play as well last season as the Celtics had hoped, he doesn’t look upon his time in Boston as wasted.\n\n“I came in here,” he said, “and was a good leadership guy for them, was still positive with all the young guys. It is not like I came in here and protested and asked to be traded or asked to be bought out. It’s a situation that occurred and I thought my attitude was great. Just didn’t play well the first few games of the season and then they shifted who they wanted to play. So that’s the way things work out and I take responsibility for my side of it. I wish things could have gone different.”\n\n-- Contact Bill Doyle at william.doyle@telegram.com. Follow him on Twitter @BillDoyle15"
