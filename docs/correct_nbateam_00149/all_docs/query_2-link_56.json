He designs and delivers interactive learning experiences in existing core courses as well as developing new courses, including a new Certificate of Veterinary Business Management. In addition to collaborating with a variety of stakeholders — including faculty at CVM and across Cornell, in industry, start-up businesses and with alumni — Colón helps students develop an innovative, creative mindset and equip them with professional competencies to prepare them for a lifetime of career success.\n\nColón is a Cornell alum who earned his bachelor's in biology in 1992 and his D.V.M. in 1995. After graduation, he completed an internship at a major equine hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, and subsequently opened his own private equine ambulatory practice that specialized in reproduction, neonatology and radiology. He earned his M.B.A. from Colorado State University in 2015, and now returns to Cornell after many successful years in practice to share his knowledge and experience through the new Center for Veterinary Business and Entrepreneurship.\n\nMatt MacLachlan, PhD\n\nAssistant Professor of Veterinary Business and Economics\n\nWe are pleased to have Matthew MacLachlan, PhD, join the College of Veterinary Medicine as Assistant Professor of Veterinary Business and Economics in the Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences and the Center for Veterinary Business and Entrepreneurship.

He led the development and implementation of the current USDA approach for forecasting food prices and conveying uncertainty around those forecasts. Dr. MacLachlan collaborates with governmental and academic economists to further refine these forecasts’ predictive power. Collaborating with other economists and governmental analysts, he evaluates policy and market adaptations during disease, pest, or disaster management, including natural disaster assistance programs, trade embargoes, and active adaptive disease management.
