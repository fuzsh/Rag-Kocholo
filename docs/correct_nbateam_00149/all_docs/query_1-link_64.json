        "text": "When David Lee retired from the NBA in 2017, he dove head-first into his new role: father of two and husband of tennis pro Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nThe two started dating in 2016 and got married in 2019. Since they got together, David has attended Grand Slams to support Caroline, and she's cheered him on at his games. They are parents to daughter Olivia (born in 2021) and son James (born in 2022).\n\nCaroline was previously engaged to golfer Rory McIlroy, who recently announced his divorce.\n\nNowadays, Caroline is living a drama-free existence with David and their kids. Here‚Äôs everything to know about him.\n\nIs Caroline Wozniacki married?\n\nYes! Caroline married former NBA All-Star David Lee in 2019.\n\n‚ÄúThe dedication you have to tennis, your daily routine, everything you do to be the champion that you are, it‚Äôs the most amazing thing I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù David told his wife at their wedding, per the magazine. ‚ÄúEven above that is the class and the principles that you live by, and that means more than any match you could ever win, any tournament you could ever win, and it‚Äôs for that reason that young girls look up to you, the whole world looks up to you for what you do and what you stand for, and why I look up to you so much. As a man you‚Äôve made me a better person. I love you with all of my heart and promise to treat you like the most special woman now and forever.‚Äù\n\nDavid is a former NBA All-Star power forward.\n\nDavid played 12 seasons in the NBA, per Vogue. He played for five teams‚Äîand won a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015.\n\nAfter he retired from basketball, he moved onto investing. He worked at Social Capitval Investment in California in 2018, per The Sun, before becoming a director at startup Topsail Re, a reinsurance company.\n\nDavid is from Missouri.\n\nDavid was born and raised in St. Louis before accepting an athletic scholarship from the University of Florida. There, he played for the Florida Gators' basketball team from 2001 to 2005.\n\nHe helped the team reach the tournament all four seasons and helped the Gators to their first SEC Tournament Title in the program's history.\n\nHe's been on TV besides basketball.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared on Family Feud during the \"NBA Players vs NBA Mothers\" episode to raise money for charity. Other TV and film credits include NBC's Celebrity Apprentice in 2009, the now-canceled Lipstick Jungle in 2008, the film When in Rome in 2010 and a cameo in The Electric Company.\n\nHow did Caroline and David meet?\n\nThey crossed paths at a dinner party thrown by a mutual friend Miami in 2015, they shared with Vogue.\n\nDuring his speech at their wedding, David joked, ‚ÄúThey say every relationship begins with a miracle‚Ä¶the fact that [you were out at] dinner past 7:30 p.m.‚Äîbecause normally you would be asleep 8 p.m.‚Äîwas a miracle.‚Äù\n\nThey went IG-official with a pair of pro athletes.\n\nAfter nearly a year of dating, Caroline posted a photo with David, his San Antonio Spurs teammate Tony Parker and French tennis player Gael Monfils in 2016.\n\nShe captioned the post, ‚ÄúSan Antonio was funüèÄüòä nice evening with these guys @dlee042 @_tonyparker09 @iamgaelmonfils.‚Äù\n\nDavid asked Caroline's dad for permission to pop the question.\n\nCaroline‚Äôs father Piotr Wozniacki taught her to play when she was a little girl growing up in Denmark and has been her coach ever since, per Vogue. David asked Piotr to meet for a drink, and he recalls his hands were shaking because of nerves. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd had every conversation in the world,‚Äù David said. ‚ÄúBut to take it from ‚ÄòWow, what a beautiful day outside,‚Äô to ‚ÄòSo!‚Äô ‚Äù\n\nLuckily, Piotr gave him the thumbs-up. When Caroline joined the two, she asked what was going on, and they told her they were celebrating her trip to the semifinals.\n\n‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòI guess you‚Äôre taking it up a few notches! I like it!‚Äô ‚Äù\n\nDavid proposed to Caroline after a big win.\n\nTo celebrate Caroline winning a tournament, the two jetted off to Bora Bora for vacation, per Vogue. He organized a private dinner cruise, and they watched the sun set.\n\n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this beautiful?‚Äù Caroline recalled. David got so quiet that she thought something was wrong.\n\n‚ÄúOne second,‚Äù he said as he fumbled inside his backpack.\n\n‚ÄúIt was good execution,‚Äù Lee joked. ‚ÄúEven if we had just had had a normal dinner‚Äîit would have been one of the most beautiful things we‚Äôd ever done.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was like, we‚Äôre killing it right now,‚Äù Caroline adds. ‚ÄúTennis, life, everything!‚Äù\n\nCaroline later posted an IG pic and captioned it, \"Safe to say it has been the most incredible couple of weeks in my life! So thankful!\"\n\nVogue crowned them 'Sport's Most Romantic Couple'\n\nIn 2019, Caroline and David posed for a Vogue photo shoot while they were engaged. In the accompanying article, Caroline talked about how she became a fixture at his games, joining the group cheers, and giving high fives.\n\nDavid joked that her player‚Äôs box has the opposite vibe. \"It‚Äôs like a military operation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even check my phone.‚Äù\n\nThey have two children together.\n\nDavid and Caroline have two children: Olivia, born June 2021, and James born October 22.\n\nCaroline posted the sweetest family photo on IG in February 2024 with the caption \"My Valentines ‚ù§Ô∏è.\"\n\nDavid is her biggest fan.\n\nThis man is always hyping his wife up!\n\nFor their anniversary he wrote on Instagram, ‚ÄúHappy Anniversary my love! 4 years and 2 kids later I couldn‚Äôt be more proud to be your husband and proud of the family that we‚Äôve built together! I love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù\n\nYou Might Also Like"
