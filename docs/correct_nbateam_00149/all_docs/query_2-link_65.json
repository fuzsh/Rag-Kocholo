Throughout his career, he has exemplified a deep commitment to the spiritual growth and well-being of congregations under his care.\n\nAs the Associate Ministerial Director, Pastor Lee will have a multifaceted role, involving various responsibilities that contribute to the overall mission and vision of the South Central Conference. He will work closely with other church leaders and departments to support ministers and churches within the conference.\n\nPastor David Lee’s extensive experience will undoubtedly be an asset to the conference.

His years of experience and his good business sense along with the counseling training that he has attained in his chaplaincy preparation allow us [South Central] to then be able to minister to our 100 pastors at a level that we’re trying to increase to. One of the areas he’ll oversee is the development of our part-time pastors who are assisting churches.
