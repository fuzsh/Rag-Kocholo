        "text": "OAKLAND — For years, David Lee has been viewed by some as a faux star, a collector of empty numbers that didn”t help his team win. Oddly, his numbers now are pretty empty, yet he”s helping his team win at a historic level.\n\nLee deserves credit for that.\n\nSay what you will about his game, about him not deserving to be the highest-paid player on the Warriors roster. But history should remember Lee for being the ultimate team player on the franchise”s ultimate team.\n\nBy playing less, Lee has been more worthy of accolades than he has ever been. Despite a decline in numbers, respect for him should be at an all-time high. If this is Lee”s final season in a Warriors uniform, his tenure should be remembered most for the way he handled his steep fall from grace.\n\n“My whole thing has been just to stay positive,” Lee said after Thursday”s win over Phoenix. “Because this is bigger than me. This is bigger than anybody on the team. … This isn”t about my ego. This isn”t about me accomplishing something individually.”\n\nLee”s fortunes have run in stark contrast to those of the team. The Warriors ascended from 47 to 51 to 60-plus wins. Meanwhile, Lee, 31, has descended from lone Warriors All-Star in 2013 to Stephen Curry”s sidekick a season later to end of the bench this season.\n\nIt”s not complete coincidence. Lee”s defense always has been a weakness, a problem for any team that wants to be really good. Plus the decline of his jumper limits his usefulness in a style of play that seeks to create space on offense.\n\nRegardless how many good reasons there might be for Lee”s current situation, none of them detract from how well he has handled his demotion, all the more when you consider all that he has been through. His tribulations haven”t been confined to the basketball court.\n\nAll summer long, he heard the trade rumors, and the wish among many fans that they come true. Amid that, he and his longtime girlfriend split up. He had surgery to repair a torn right hip flexor. And, finally, the capper: a hamstring injury in this season”s final exhibition game that cost him 25 games and his job.\n\n“The low point was when I couldn”t play at all,” Lee said. “When you”re hurt, I don”t care how many games you sit and cheer for your teammates, you don”t feel part of the team. … There were some games that were on national TV, games I was excited about, games against players I”ve been successful against in the past. And then to not get a chance to play at all, that”s frustrating. But the hardest part was being hurt and having to work back from that.”\n\nBy the time Lee returned to health, Draymond Green had made himself a fixture in the starting lineup. Lee, for the first time since November 2008, was coming off the bench. Last month, he had five DNP-CDs — Did Not Play-Coach”s Decision — his first since coming to the Warriors in 2010. He averaged 69 starts per year his first four seasons with the Warriors; he has started four times this season. His average playing time of 36 minutes per game is down to 19.1 this season.\n\nIt would be understandable if Lee were bitter, spouting off as Stephen Jackson did when he was unhappy. It would make sense if stories with anonymous sources were cropping up, as was the case with Monta Ellis, or if Lee grew detached in the manner of Andris Biedrins.\n\nNone of that has happened. On the contrary.\n\nThursday night, after Harrison Barnes” game-winning shot, Lee was in a race with Justin Holiday to be first off the bench to celebrate the victory. Lee still is a fixture in the locker room, joking with teammates and chatting with media even when he is limited to garbage minutes. He talks regularly with coach Steve Kerr.\n\n“He”s handling it as well as he possibly could,” Kerr said. “He”s getting his work in. Every time I talk to him, he says, ”Coach, I just want to win a title.” Couldn”t ask for anything more. … The attitude he”s maintained has been fantastic.”\n\nOf course, there”s an easy retort to all of this happy stuff: On a team this good, only a fool would squawk. Imagine the public outcry if Lee were to demand a trade, or threaten this magical season in any way. But that would mean Lee is faking his happiness about winning. That would mean he is acting when he leads cheers on the bench. That”s a long con to play, and Lee hasn”t slipped up yet — which suggests he is being genuine.\n\nLee isn”t hiding his hurt. He”s just choosing to let the winning salve the pain, like ice cream for a kid with a boo-boo.\n\n“Of course I want to play more,” Lee said. “Everybody does. That”s the combativeness you have to have. But with that being said, I”ve never been on a team like this. None of us have. Very few guys in the league have.”\n\nBack when the Warriors were still an NBA doormat, Lee was on the court with aching knees playing out the string on a 23-win season with NBA Development League call-ups.\n\nThe great team chemistry for which the Warriors are now known was fostered largely by Lee, who joined Curry in creating a positive atmosphere among the players — paying for dinners and planning team bonding sessions — in the post-Monta era.\n\nLee has invested himself so deeply in the Warriors that it”s credible when he talks about desperately wanting a title. Winning is a form of vindication for him because he has played a big role in taking the Warriors from awful to awesome.\n\nAnd, you never know, he might not be done here.\n\nKerr and Lee have talked about the opportunities that could present themselves in the playoffs. Depending on matchups, depending on how things shake out, Lee might get a chance to make an impact. Kerr went so far as to say he expects Lee to win a game for them in the playoffs.\n\nThat would be a redemptive end to what has been a struggle of a season.\n\n“I”ve had games where I”ve played 25 minutes, I”ve had games where I”ve gotten DNPs. Nothing is going to surprise me at this point,” Lee said. “The biggest thing mentally is I”m just always focused on when I get a chance to be out there to help us make plays to win.\n\n“I”m very, very confident I”ll be able to help us win games when my number is called.”\n\nRead Marcus Thompson II”s blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/thompson.
