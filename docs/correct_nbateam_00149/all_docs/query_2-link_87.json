        "text": "David Lee retired from the NBA in 2017 and has since embraced his new role: father of two and husband of tennis pro Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nThe two were first linked in 2016 and officially revealed their relationship the next year. Since then, Lee has attended Grand Slams to support Wozniacki, they‚Äôve purchased and sold a multimillion-dollar home and welcomed daughter Olivia (born in 2021) and son James (born in 2022).\n\nBefore meeting Lee, Wozniacki was engaged to golfer Rory McIlroy, who infamously broke up with her just weeks before their wedding in a three-minute phone call. McIlroy and wife Erica Stoll announced their divorce in May 2024.\n\nJust minutes after word of their divorce became public, Wozniacki commented on an Instagram post from golfer Brooks Koepka in which Koepka paid tribute to his wife, Jena Sims. ‚ÄúHot mama üî•üî•üî•,‚Äù she wrote.\n\nKoepka and Wozniacki have long been friends, with the golfer supporting her return to tennis after she took time off to build her family with Lee.\n\nKeep scrolling for Wozniacki and Lee‚Äôs complete relationship timeline:\n\nNovember 2015\n\nLee and Wozniacki met at a restaurant in Miami, though their romance didn‚Äôt become public right away. As Lee told it during his wedding speech, according to Vogue, ‚ÄúThey say every relationship begins with a miracle ‚Ä¶ the fact that [you were out at] dinner past 7:30 p.m. ‚Äî because normally you would be asleep 8 p.m. ‚Äî was a miracle.‚Äù The two got to talking and continued to hang out that night at Wozniacki‚Äôs Fisher Island home before he crashed in the guest room.\n\nDecember 2016\n\nWozniacki posted a photo with Lee, his San Antonio Spurs teammate Tony Parker and French tennis player Gael Monfils. She captioned the post, ‚ÄúSan Antonio was funüèÄüòä nice evening with these guys @dlee042 @_tonyparker09 @iamgaelmonfils.‚Äù\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nWozniacki confirmed the two were dating with a Valentine‚Äôs Day post shared via her Instagram Story. In the photo, she was holding a bouquet of roses. ‚ÄúHappy Valentine‚Äôs Day everyone! I‚Äôm a lucky girl! Thank you @dlee042!‚Äù she captioned the snap.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nWozniacki and Lee confirmed they were engaged, with the pair posting a photo together on each of their accounts.\n\nLee wrote, ‚ÄúShe said YES! So thrilled to be engaged to my soulmate! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíç.‚Äù\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nWozniacki won the Australian Open for the first time in her career, and Lee posted a tribute to her via his Instagram account.\n\n‚ÄúAustralian Open Champion and back to #1 in the world!!! Endless congrats to my amazing fianc√©e on her heart and dedication, so proud to have your back for life ‚ù§Ô∏èüèÜüòò,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nWozniacki and Lee teamed up for a Vogue photo shoot as ‚ÄúSports‚Äô Most Romantic Couple.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI would love to have a big family and probably step away a little from the spotlight,‚Äù Wozniacki said, adding, ‚ÄúActing could be so fun. Push my limits a little bit.‚Äù\n\nJune 2019\n\nWozniacki and Lee announced their marriage.\n\n‚ÄúThe dedication you have to tennis, your daily routine, everything you do to be the champion that you are, it‚Äôs the most amazing thing I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù Lee told his wife at their wedding. ‚ÄúEven above that is the class and the principles that you live by, and that means more than any match you could ever win, any tournament you could ever win, and it‚Äôs for that reason that young girls look up to you, the whole world looks up to you for what you do and what you stand for, and why I look up to you so much. As a man you‚Äôve made me a better person. I love you with all of my heart and promise to treat you like the most special woman now and forever.‚Äù\n\nJune 2021\n\nLee and Wozniacki purchased their Fisher Island penthouse for $18.7 million. The home, inside the prestigious Palazzo Del Sol building, has more than 7,000 square feet of living space, a private pool and waterfront views. They sold the home in January 2024 for $42.5 million.\n\nJune 2021\n\nThe couple welcomed daughter Olivia on June 11.\n\nOctober 2022\n\nJames, the couple‚Äôs second child, was born on October 24."
