He also developed and launched a first-of-its kind course in Mindfulness in Public Health and Medicine that combined didactic and experiential training on the use of mind-body techniques to manage the stressors associated with modern life. Dr. Lee has mentored many doctoral students, fellows and junior faculty as well as high school students over his 30+ years at the University of Miami. Students and junior faculty have served as lead authors for approximately one-quarter of the 275+ publications by Dr. Lee.
