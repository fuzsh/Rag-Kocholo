A baby hook has a softer touch. A bank off the glass is more efficient from the left side.\n\nDavid Lee was the king of these moves.\n\nHe maneuvered his way around the rim for dunks and found cutting teammates for his entire NBA career.\n\nWhat has the two-time NBA All-Star been up to since retiring?\n\nDavid Lee's Basketball Career\n\nRELATED: What Happened to Lee Humphrey and Where is He Now?\n\nLee was a high school standout at Chaminade College Prep in St. Louis, Missouri.

In his four-year college basketball career, Lee averaged 11.3 points and 6.8 rebounds per game while earning Second-Team All-SEC honors as a junior and senior.\n\nLee's success in Gainesville led to him being selected 30th overall by the New York Knicks in the 2005 NBA Draft.\n\nThe frontcourt player grew into his own at Madison Square Garden, and developed into a fan favorite. He played five seasons in New York, then suited up for the Golden State Warriors; Boston Celtics; Dallas Mavericks; and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nLee won an NBA championship as a member of the Warriors in 2015 alongside Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.\n\nHe retired in 2017 at the age of 33.

The grand slam winning women's tennis player was previously engaged to Rory McIlroy.\n\nThe former NBA player and the 2018 Australian Open champ are expecting a baby girl any day now.
