        "text": "DAVID Lee has found both love and financial success since retiring from the NBA.\n\nThe two-time all-star, 40, is married to Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nLee was the 30th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks.\n\nHe would spend five years at Madison Square Garden before joining the Golden State Warriors in 2010.\n\nA dual-threat at 6-foot-9, Lee could operate at both center or power forward.\n\nAt his peak, he averaged over 20 points and 11 rebounds per game for the Warriors.\n\nLee became an NBA champion in 2015, despite his limited role with the Warriors that season.\n\nHe would retire two years later after spells with the Boston Celtics, Dallas Mavericks, and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nPer Spotrac, Lee brought in a cool $92million during his NBA career.\n\nAnd he immediately put that capital to good use after waving goodbye to basketball.\n\nLee worked for a year at Social Capital Investment in California before becoming a director in Florida in 2018.\n\nHe took up the role at new startup Topsail Re, a privately held reinsurance company.\n\nAccording to the company's LinkedIn page, it boasts over 1,000 employees.\n\nIts mission is to \"partner with Insurance Companies in which our expertise and capital can make a difference.\"\n\nIt continues: \"Our goal is to simplify the reinsurance process for all parties and provide a stable long-term platform for our Partners.\"\n\nAway from the court, Lee found romance with Wozniacki after meeting the tennis ace at a dinner party in 2015.\n\nThey hit it off immediately, with the pair getting engaged two years later during a vacation to Bora Bora.\n\nWozniacki wrote on Instagram: \"Happiest day of my life yesterday saying yes to my soulmate.\"\n\nThe loved-up couple married in 2019 and have two young children, Olivia and James."
