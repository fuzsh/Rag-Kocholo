        "text": "David (Dave) Lee Genger passed away peacefully on May 17, 2024 at the age of 89 with family members at his side. Over his 89 years he lived a full life and was loved and admired by all who came to know him.\n\nBorn October 14,1934, in Warren, OH. Dave graduated from Warren G. Harding High School in 1952. After graduating high school, he attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and graduated in 1956. He continued his education at the University of Michigan Law School and graduated in 1959. While in law school, he met Nancy Lynne Moore who was an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan. Nancy, a Detroit Michigan native, was an outgoing young woman who captured his heart. Dave and Nancy were married in June 1960 and embarked on a fulfilling life of love and family.\n\nDave chose to settle in Cleveland and began his career as an attorney. He and Nancy started a family in 1962, welcoming their son David Jr. A second son Mark followed in June of 1964. They lived in Warrensville Heights until 1976. While in Warrensville, he sat as President of the Warrensville Heights School Board. The family moved to Shaker Heights in the summer of 1976 where they remained until 2002. Dave retired as a partner from Arter & Hadden in 1998.\n\nDave and Nancy purchased a farm in Conneaut, OH in 1989. This purchase brought so much joy into their lives. Dave planted a vineyard starting in 1991 with his two sons, family members and friends. Every year the vineyard expanded, ending up with over 3,000 vines. It was quite an accomplishment and one that was a great source of pride and commitment. He was delighted to become a full time Vigneron. There were years of bountiful harvests and years of little harvest as a result of the challenging growing environment in Northeast Ohio. He always stayed positive regardless of the size of the harvest as he loved the process of grape growing. Over the years many family members and family friends participated in the fall harvest. He sat on the Ohio Grape Industries Committee representing the Northeast Ohio region. Dave sold the vineyard in late 2021 and retired once again - this time as a Vigneron. He made sure the buyer would keep the vineyard going ensuring that would happen in the sale documents.\n\nDaveâ€™s other passions were sports and music. He loved all Cleveland sports teams and of course his beloved University of Michigan football team. An avid tennis player, he also played basketball and squash. At one point in his tennis playing days he sustained an injury to his right shoulder. That did not stop him from playing as he instead taught himself how to play left handed until his injury healed. This is the type of passion that he displayed throughout his life. David was an avid church choir and karaoke singer. He loved singing Sinatra and many other artists. He also played the piano and enjoyed playing in front of friends and family.\n\nDave is survived by his loving wife Nancy Lynne Genger (nee Moore); dear father of Mark D. Genger (Ellen Russell) and the late David Lee Genger, Jr. (Vanessa Hillard Genger); dear grandfather of Melissa Genger, Nicole Genger, Allyson Genger, Matthew Russell, Claire Russell and Alice Russell; the dear great-grandfather of Tatum Genger Trueblood. The family prefers that those who wish may make contributions in his name to Foxfield Preserve, at the Wilderness Center, 9877 Alabama Ave., SW, Wilmot, OH 44689. There will be a Celebration of David's Life in Plymouth Church of Shaker Heights, 2860 Coventry Rd., Shaker Hts., OH 44120, Friday, May 31st at 11am."
