        "text": "OAKLAND - The Willis Reed references were coming hot and heavy before tipoff between Golden State and Denver at Oracle Arena on Thursday night, as word spread quickly that Warriors forward David Lee was active for Game 6 despite having suffered an injury just 12 days before that was expected to end his season. He entered play for the first time with 2:27 left in the first quarter and Denver leading 23-18, then left just 69 seconds later.\n\nBut on a night that the Warriors needed every last edge to survive in a 92-88 win that pits them against San Antonio in the second series, Lee sparked bedlam inside the already-booming building.\n\nLee, who suffered a torn right hip flexor in Golden State's Game 1 loss and made his brief appearance just 12 days later, said there is no risk to returning so soon because the worst-case scenario involves a surgery that would repair the damage.\n\n\"It was something that I wanted to do for my team, to be a leader, to give us an extra boost,\" Lee said. \"But with an extra four or five days (to rest before facing the Spurs), it's already come this far so stranger things have happened. I can guarantee you one thing. If there's any chance to play, I'll be the first guy to play and that was evidenced by what I did tonight. But I'm just excited about this series. I think we've got a chance.\"\n\n\"Part of (his willingness to play) was the fact that I have a completely torn muscle, off the bone. I think surgery is a very good possibility at the end of the season here. We'll see what happens with that. That'll be something that we're still talking about between specialists and our staff.\"\n\nAsked if he could play a big role against the Spurs, Lee said, \"Significant part like playing 30 minutes? Zero (chance).\"\n\nWhile Lee's appearance in the team's layup line before the game was a shock to fans and media on hand, the fact that Lee knew he could fix any damage done in the offseason led to his decision to give it a go.\n\n\"I saw tonight as an elimination game for both teams,\" Lee said. \"We didn't want to have to go back to Denver (for Game 7). I tried to do whatever I could. I didn't know it would respond. There's those nights when you feel awful and then you get on the court and you feel pretty good. Tonight, after I shot that jumper, I went to backpedal and my leg was nonexistent.\"\n\nReed's everlasting and dramatic moment came in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals, when he played in the win vs. the Los Angeles Lakers despite suffering a serious leg injury two games before. The comparison to Lee is hyperbole defined, but Lee's reappearance surely adds intrigue to a series that was already plenty compelling.\n\n\"The difference was that Willis hit that jump shot – mine rimmed in and out,\" Lee said. \"I was sitting in that timeout, and I was very unsure if the leg would work whatsoever. And I went on the court and (Jackson) called the first play was a pick and pop (isolation play) for me, and I kind of looked at him like, 'Thanks, but not thanks.' But coach – one of the things you can see is how much everybody on this team loves our coach and loves one another. I would never have taken a chance like that unless I believed in these guys, believed in our coach, and to know they have my back the same way.\""
