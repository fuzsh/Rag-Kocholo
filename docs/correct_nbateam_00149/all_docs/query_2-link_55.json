        "text": "The main focus of my research is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate programs to support students with or at risk for emotional/behavior disorders (EBD) across academic, behavioral, and social domains. My research draws upon a behavior analytic framework to create positive, function-based interventions for students, primarily in middle/high school settings.\n\nCurrently, our research team is developing and evaluating a program to help middle-school students begin and remain engaged in academic tasks. Unfortunately, many students with EBD fail to engage in academic and/or social activities, leading to a continuous cycle of frustration, lack of engagement, and, ultimately, academic failure. The purpose of this project is to break this cycle."
