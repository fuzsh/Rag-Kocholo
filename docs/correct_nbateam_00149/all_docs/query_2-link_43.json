I have identified novel proteins with enzymatic activities such as methyltransferases and ubiquitin ligases as potential therapeutic targets. In addition, we have recently identified a putative oncogene for salivary glands of head and neck cancers. We will further characterize this protein and plan to develop targeted therapies against this gene. I have extensive research training in cellular development, angiogenesis, transcription and epigenetics as well as translational research in the areas of animal model development, small animal imaging and irradiation. As a committed physician-scientist, my ultimate goal is to translate basic discoveries in the laboratory to the clinic to improve the outcome of cancer patients.\n\nAreas of Specialty\n\nRadiation Oncologist\n\nBreast, GI, H&N, HPB, Lung, Neuro, GU, Sarcomas\n\nEducation\n\nResidency: Wiliam Beaumont Hospital, Radiation Oncology (2012)\n\nInternship: Wiliam Beaumont Hospital, Radiation Oncology (2012)\n\nMedical School: University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine (2007)\n\nGraduate School: University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (2005)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish\n\nResearch and Scholarship\n\nCellular and Molecular Oncology Research Group at UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center"
