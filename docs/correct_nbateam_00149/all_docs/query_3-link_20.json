        "text": "Given its location, name and profile, there is a strong argument to be made that New York City FC is the second largest of the twelve teams owned by the multi-club ownership group City Football Group (CFG).\n\nClearly at the top is Manchester City, Pep Guardiola’s team, which recently won its fourth consecutive English Premier League title – its sixth overall under Guardiola – and became European champions for the first time in 2023.\n\nOn Forbes’ list of the world’s most valuable soccer teams, New York City FC is ranked 21st, the second highest CFG team on the list, supporting the belief that they are next in line after the Manchester club.\n\nNew York City sporting director David Lee has worked with the region’s MLS clubs since 2011, first as a performance analyst with the New Jersey-based New York Red Bulls before joining City as director of player recruitment in 2014 and assuming his current role ahead of the 2020 season.\n\nCollaborative dynamics\n\nIn this increasingly popular model of running a soccer club, the dynamic between the sporting director and the head coach – in NYC’s case, that’s Nick Cushing – is key to ensuring smooth operations at the sporting level and implementing recruitment and development plans in training and games.\n\n“I think fundamentally we’re trying to work much more together and not create so much separation (as opposed to) my responsibility to build a team and Nick not finding out who the players are until they come to training – that’s not the optimal way to build a team in my opinion,” Lee says.\n\n“We obviously have clear responsibilities and areas of responsibility. Ultimately, I am responsible for ensuring that we build the most competitive squad possible and that Nick is available as much as possible within the salary cap.\n\n“Then Nick’s job is to build a team, develop the style and develop the individual players every day on the training pitch.\n\n“So there are very clear dividing lines. There are areas that I don’t intervene in, and there are areas that Nick may not intervene in, for which I am responsible.\n\n“But when it comes to building a team, I believe the right way and the best process is to try to be as collaborative as possible.\n\n“Ultimately, we want to sign players that Nick is really happy with, that he enjoys working with and that fit in with him. And that’s what we’ll try to do.”\n\nA style change for 2024?\n\nAs for the exact nature of these requirements, they may have changed slightly in recent months and even before the start of the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to Opta, this season’s average possession per game of 51.6% is the lowest in franchise history if it stays at this level, with last season’s figure (52.9%) being the second lowest.\n\nNew York City’s difficulties in 2023 and early 2024 led to a change in style that could be seen as a departure from the City Football Group’s heavily possession-based style.\n\n“I think there has been a slight change in style, especially since last season,” Lee says. “When we sat down and reflected on last year, I think there were a number of things we wanted to improve.\n\n“We didn’t feel like we were really pressing aggressively last year. We spent a lot of games sitting in a sort of middle block.\n\n“We were a really effective defensive team with one of the best defensive performances in the league, but when we won the ball back we were further away from the goal and were not able to exploit transition moments as effectively.\n\n“I think the change will be more likely to happen between 2023 and 2024 as we really focus on how we can develop those areas of our game because we think the very best teams score goals at every stage.\n\n“We were a really good build-up team, we created goals and we still create some fantastic goals. I think the most notable one this year is probably the Red Bull goal where we built up from the goalkeeper and were able to overcome their pressure and go almost half-directly on goal, which gave Hannes (Wolf) the goal.\n\n“But we knew we had to be more effective in transition and I think that suits some of our players too. Santi (Rodríguez) or Alonso Martínez, even Hannes, who we signed in the offseason, are really effective in transition moments.\n\n“We needed to score more goals this year if we wanted to finish higher in the league, so the trick for us was to figure out how to do that and what areas of our game we needed to improve.\n\n“When I think back to Toronto’s third goal, scored by (Andrés) Perea, and Alonso’s goal away in Philadelphia – they’re the result of really effective transition moments, which have been a focus of what we’ve been working on since preseason. Those moments allow you to build and win more away games and be more successful away from home.\n\n“So I think there’s been a shift. I still want us to be as good in possession as we have been and we’ll continue to work on finding the right balance.\n\n“But I think we’ve become more dangerous in transition while maintaining most, if not all, of our composure and quality in possession that are really the hallmarks of what a New York City FC and a CFG team should be.”\n\nMeet expectations\n\nIt can be difficult for teams in the City Football Group that are not Manchester City to replicate the English Premier League team that is undoubtedly the group’s flagship team in their own leagues.\n\nThe other clubs in the multi-ownership group face various restrictions, particularly in MLS, where salary caps and roster composition rules limit the scope for a sporting director to act.\n\nMuch of the work of the non-Manchester CFG teams is to achieve as much as possible within these constraints, to get as close as possible to the style and success of the club at the top of the chain.\n\nNew York City has already won an MLS Cup in 2021 in just its seventh MLS season, but the league’s attempt to achieve parity through its rules can make it difficult to maintain success over long periods of time.\n\nRegardless, there are certain expectations placed on a team in the densely populated sports landscape of New York City and on a team within the City Football Group.\n\nFor Lee, the prerequisites for meeting these expectations are as follows: “We have to play really offensively, have a lot of possession, dominate the ball, try to win it back as quickly as possible and have a really good positional game that allows us to build up from the goalkeeper.”\n\n“The goal for New York and for me,” Lee continues, “is to build a team, put together a staff and create a club that can meet those expectations.”\n\nGiven MLS’s numerous roster rules, meeting expectations could be one of the bigger challenges for New York City FC within the group, although clubs such as Palermo in Italy and Girona in Spain must also navigate different international player rules and financial fair play regulations.\n\n“There are challenges for every club in the group to achieve the goals we (New York City FC) want to achieve while also getting results,” Lee adds.\n\n“We don’t want to play fantastic football and then lose a lot of games. We need to win games, we want to fight for trophies and give trophies to our fans. So my job is to try to find that balance.”\n\n“It’s difficult in the MLS. The roster restrictions are what they are. There will be players you can invest more money in and positions you can’t spend as much on.\n\n“Then it comes down to the coaches and the fantastic job they do to develop that style and make the players as competent as possible, with a really clear methodology of how we want to see the team play.\n\n“I still believe it is possible to play a version of what the pinnacle of our style of football should look like.”\n\nNew York City appears to have turned things around after a disappointing 2023 season and a poor start to 2024.\n\nThis means that they have already won as many away games in 2024 as they did in the whole of 2023 and can finish in the top four in the Eastern Conference, which would secure them the decisive home advantage in the playoffs.\n\nJust as it is difficult to achieve consistency over multiple seasons in the MLS, it is also difficult to achieve winning streaks within a single season.\n\nThis final third of the season will largely determine what 2024 will look like overall and whether the expectations of both the City of New York and the City Football group will be met."
