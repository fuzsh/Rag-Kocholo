        "text": "Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead was my first feature as a script supervisor. It was a true trial by fire working on 35mm with almost entirely practical vfx in one of the hottest summers Buffalo, NY has ever had shooting 95% of the film in an abandoned McDonalds. The making of this film is so storied that I actually co-directed a feature-length documentary about it that would end up on the DVD & blu-ray releases entitled Poultry in Motion.\n\nThis was a tremendously crazy shoot and it cannot be re-iterated enough that this was a giant challenge. Continuity was often purposely thrown out the window, but I rolled with the punches and wound up making such an effect on the final film I ended up with a co-producer credit.\n\nShooting 35mm on 2 cameras and without a monitor or even audio monitoring was hard, usually I’d have to make sure anything that could ever possibly be on camera would be in proper continuity, whole rooms at a time. This taught me to be prepared for anything. The crew also comprised a few veterans with mostly volunteers drawn by Troma Studios fiercely independent style to the project. Besides being a learning experience for this crew who’d never worked on a feature of this magnitude before, it taught me invaluable lessons on working with every single department on every single scene and shot to make sure everything went off without a hitch. A lot of the practical fx experience I learned here later served me well on You’re Next years later."
