        "text": "After 50+ years in the New York inde­pendent movie scene, with dozens of fea­tures to his name, Troma co-founder Lloyd Kaufman is releasing what could be his final film, #Shakespeares Shitstorm, “be­fore flying off to that great director’s chair in the sky,” he said.\n\nIt’s an irreverent musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Tempest that touches on contemporary themes like the opioid crisis and social media intolerance. The NYC pre­miere showing at Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria was April 8th. The Queens Gazette took this opportunity to interview Lloyd Kaufman regarding his new film.\n\nEstablished in 1974 by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, Troma Entertainment, the company that Lloyd Kaufman is di­rectly involved with is according to their press material, “arguably the longest run­ning independent movie studio in North America.” Some of the films that Troma has produced and distributed include Kauf­man’s The Toxic Avenger, Trey Parker’s Cannibal! The Musical, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, Class of Nuke ‘Em High, Charles Kaufman’s Mother’s Day and Tromeo & Juliet.\n\nKaufman has worked with Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Costner, and Samuel Jackson to name just a few.\n\nKaufman has also worked on films that he did not distribute, produce, or direct, in­cluding Rocky, and Saturday Night Fever, two major films from that era. But as Kauf­man stated, his relationship with main­stream Hollywood would not and could not last long. He always felt that there would be problems and “I always wanted to do things my own way and my employers in­sisted I do things the correct way.” And anyway, his impressive credentials as well as the risks he took ultimately have paid off as he has been involved in many successful films.\n\nClearly from his bio and numerous arti­cles about Mr. Lloyd Kaufman it is obvious that he is by definition very much an inde­pendent film person, as he has consistently gone out of the box and away from what was seemingly popular mainstream media, and instead focused on what he felt was the creative and dynamic genre of Troma En­tertainment. (We are running out to get his hit book, All I Need to Know About Film­making I Learned From The Toxic Avenger, published by Penguin Putnam.)\n\nKaufman is an advocate of true free speech and points out how the political cli­mate has made it so that we only have free speech if we don’t say anything, to quote one of his political friends, Al Franken. Wanting free speech and the right to do what he wanted was a motivating factor.\n\nWe asked Mr. Kaufman what motivates him after so many years in this business to keep going forward. Kaufman answered, “It’s very simple. I get obsessed with some­thing. And I don’t let go.”\n\nHe explained that he saw Tempest with his mother live on stage when he was 8 years old and it’s been his favorite play, and literally he became obsessed with it. He has continued to work his magic and make magic monsters as a result of the things he has seen in his life, the books that he’s read, the shows that he’s watched, the movies that he’s helped create, and been involved with – all of above have led to a cauldron where all of these ideas and concepts have been mixed together and the resulting drink or smorgasbord, if you prefer, is Kaufman’s legacy of creations.\n\nIn the interview he indicated, “This very well may be my last movie. It’s all set up based on one of the greatest plays in history, and everyone who’s ever studied tempest or watched it will enjoy this film.”\n\nWe asked Mr. Kaufman a question we always like to ask, “Who are some of your favorite directors?” and of course he men­tioned John Ford, Fritz Lang, Howard Hawks, and many others in the pantheon of film. But the most emotional aspect of the interview was his genuine respect, admira­tion, and thankfulness to the fans who have supported his films for the past 50 years. He said, “Thanks to the fans we were able to do the work that we did.”\n\nUnfortunately an interview with a direc­tor producer of this magnitude and knowl­edge cannot be adequately captured in mere words from a quick question and answer in­terview, even in the Queens Gazette inter­viewing a Queens director right here in Long Island City-Astoria. But suffice it to say that his films do speak for themselves and clearly are the voice of what Mr. Lloyd Kaufman is all about and they capture his insight, intense sense of humor knowledge and general character. Thank you Mr. Kauf­man. —Tony Barsamian"
