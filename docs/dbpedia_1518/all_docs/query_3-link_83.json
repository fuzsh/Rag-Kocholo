The concept is usually enough for a minute or so of laughs, real bottom-of-barrel stuff. But having to sit through the same concept stretched to 90 mins of excruciating \"acting\" is usually too much.\n\nLooneyAtTheGate\n\nI did a re-edit of 'Mega Shark Vs Giant Octopus' and added some SA metal..\n\nI found the DVD for R10 at a shop in Durban ?\n\nIts very simple, just chopped away all the actual acting and was left with 4 minutes:\n\n=\n\nflatfourfan\n\nLMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nway to bitch slap the fighter jet octo..........lol.\n\nevolucian\n\nAny thoughts on \"world war z\" yet?\n\nSharknado looks like absolute shit... but it has some Tara Reid in there... hmmmm.... *contemplating*\n\nflatfourfan\n\nWorld war Z is next on my list. I watched white house down the other night and was plesantly surprised.\n\nevolucian\n\nI could spoil it for you if you'd like... but its not monday so I don't have the heart to do it today.\n\nManfred-Klose\n\n...here is another one not to miss ?\n\n=\n\nNorman86\n\nManfred Klose wrote: ...here is another one not to miss ?\n\n=\n\nwow... like wrong turn... the trailer looks awesome... i wonder how the movie will turn out?\n\nflatfourfan\n\nNorman86 wrote:\n\nManfred Klose wrote: ...here is another one not to miss ?\n\n=\n\nwow... like wrong turn... the trailer looks awesome... i wonder how the movie will turn out?\n\ndate stamped at 2012, so it should be around somewhere.\n\nlooks actually pretty crappy.............crappy meaning good in this case with B-graders.\n\nLooneyAtTheGate\n\nYes I got Inbred in it entirety... still afraid to watch it!\n\nApparently its just plain BAD ???\n\nflatfourfan\n\nJulian Emdon (LooneyAtTheGate) wrote: Yes I got Inbred in it entirety... still afraid to watch it!\n\nApparently its just plain BAD ???\n\nHow bad can it be on the Shartnado scale?............\n\nLooneyAtTheGate\n\nHaha I should just watch it and report back\n\nI suspect it might be 2/5 'sharks' ?\n\ngiggsy\n\nFor those who haven't yet seen it, Sharknado is on DSTV on Saturday night.
