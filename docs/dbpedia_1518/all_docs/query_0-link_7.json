I CUSSIC CUT Dick Jacobs and his Orchestra ‘s Themes from Horror Movies., Photo by Rocky Schenck. rockyschenck.com, I love horror movies. In fact, it’s safe to say that horror movies are my favourite thing ever in- vented - apart from sex, tattoos, Blade Runner anti Mad Max’s Interceptor, naturally - so I get a little bummed out when I feel like I’m watching my beloved genre starve to death right be- fore my very eyes. You don’t need to be afilm critic or journalist to understand why I’m so frus- trated at mainstream horror cinema at the moment. Take a look for yourself: the movie theatres are virtually congested with substandard remakes, pointless sequels and re-imaginings so dull they make me want to kill myself. Let’s survey the recent crop of crap I’ve had to grind my teeth to get through in the last two months. There was The Unborn (we wish that mess of an idea had stayed that way), The Uninvited {anti totally unwelcome). My Bloody Valentine 3-D (which would have tanked if horror fans weren’t desperate to see anything in 3-D), The Day the Earth Stood Still (an incoherent and insulting redux of the 1 951 sci- ence fiction classic), Underworld: Rise of the Shitty CGI Werewolves and, last but not least, the mother of all disappointing reboots: Friday the 13th. Like many others, I wanted to like this movie, I truly did. And, really, how hard is it? All we craved was a cool new Jason, a little suspense and a little gore. Okay, we wanted a LOT of gore, because that’s all those movies really had going for them when you get down to bloody brass tacks. What we got in- stead was a bunch of annoying fist magnets who talk to themselves endlessly throughout the film and don’t even die well. Then, in the end, the two survivors dump the only evidence that they didn’t kill their friends themselves in the lake next to the summer camp that’s built on top of a mine. Really? During the movie (because I had nothing better to do) I found myself wondering if I’m either getting too old for this stuff or if mainstream horror movies are more pointless than ever. The unfortunate truth, I came to realize while watching the token black character attempt to jerk off to a catalogue, is that many of these films aren’t made for me. They're made for teenagers. That’s who the studios and other Hollywood moneymen fh/Mgoes to see horror films, which simply isn’t the case, as our much older readership demographic unequivocally proves. It’s unfortunate, because these ignorant people are having a detrimental effect on the way horror movies are made - specifically in the arena of casting. It’s why Sarah Michelle Cellar stars in the re- make of The Grudge (which also sucked, incidentally) instead of a thirtysomething-year-old “unknown.” And if a masterpiece such as The Changeling were remade today (as its been rumoured to be), I bet the farm that George C. Scott’s character would be a sexy young hunk with a hot wife (a la the Ami- tyville remake). This movie would also likely be filled with many of the current horror cliches that Dave Alexander outlined in his hilarious review of The Unborn last issue, and it would probably star some asshole from Dawson's Creek. This, sadly, is the state of things in mainstream horror cinema. Granted, it’s always been annoyingly formulaic but sometimes I wonder if anyone in Hollywood is even trying to make decent horror movies anymore. It seems as long as producers make their money back, they’re convinced they’ve created a good product. One thing I’ve learned in this business is that just because a movie made money does- n’t mean it was any good. Witness Friday the 13tffs second week drop off at the box office (or Hostel 2, for that matter) for proof that the diehards went to see it open and everyone else lost interest after they read the reviews. It’s patently clear we’re in a period of recycling, a severely low point in the oscillating nature of the horror genre. In order for things to get better, something’s got to give - and it has to be Hollywood. In- stead of just waiting for the next Blair Witch Projector Sixth Sense to appear, Hollywood needs to stop greenlighting regurgitated, watered-down pap aimed towards teens, remakes of old or foreign films, and sequels to movies that were already junk in the first place. Rather, it needs to take a chance on someone with a new idea, because a new idea, or even a fresh take on an old standby (such as Let the Right One In, for example) has the capacity to rescue the genre - which has been nearly beaten to death - and, with any luck, get the blood pumping again.

R (iill AS YOU'VE no doubt heard, Mr. Lux Interior shuffled off this mortal coil last week on Feb. 4. I'm writing to ask if you can find it in your heart to pay tribute to the man, and perhaps to the legacy of The Cramps as a whole, in an upcom- ing issue. I realize deadlines are tight and that space is limited, but even if it meant waiting an issue or two it would be wonderful to see a mag of Rue Morgue's calibre and expertise illumi- nate his lasting contribution to horror culture. ADAM BARRACLOUGH - ADDRESS WITHHELD Done and done. We hope you enjoy the tribute, Adam. - Ed. IN SPITE OF the unflattering review my band received, I still feel honoured to be included in the pages of Rue Morgue. The review Aaron Von Lupton wrote is bad. I don’t mean “we got a bad review,\" 1 mean “the reviewls bad.” I am a pro- fessional freelance writer, having over 150 pub- lished articles to date. It is somewhat insulting when someone trashes your craft by simply \"phoning it in\" for a 100-word review. I won’t waste your time by going into too many details, but tell me if this makes sense; “We realize this sampler of the upcoming album Creeping Beauty probably doesn’t represent the band’s peak output, but if that’s the case, why sell it in the first place?” SERIOUSLY? Gee, Too Fast for Love wasn't Motley Crue at their peak, maybe they should have shelved that CD and waited another ten years? Was the first issue of Rue Morgue your peak? You sold it, correct? Sorry, it’s just very poor writing. DARREN BOYD - THE WHORROR The first two issues of Rue Morgue were given away for free. - Ed. IN THE JAN/FEB issue, you mention several perks of living in Canada in the Note from Un- derground. I especially appreciated the com- ment “lasting government support of same sex marriage.” As a gay man who loves horror. I’ve rarely felt like the horror community embraces anything about us (other than killing us horribly in movies). Sure, I know that not every horror fan is a single white male, testosterone-fuelled, T&A-loving homo-basher like every single forum of every horror site seems to suggest, but reading your comment was an awesome nod to the gay community. Thank you for making me feel welcomed at Rue Morgue, Jovanka. JERRY DIEGO - SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA CONGRATS on another stellar issue (RM#86}. I’m a US Peace Corps volunteer living in the Kingdom of Lesotho, in Southern Africa. Getting the latest RM mailed from the States is the highlight of my month. You can’t fathom my pleasure at reading about the South African Horror Film Fest going on in Cape Town around Halloween. By the time the event rolls around. I’ll have been living without electricity for almost a year. Even if the lineup blows, it will be worth it to attend a horror film festival with loads of other fans. Not even the Dust Devil himself could keep me from making it to Cape Town! I’m grateful to you for your splendid interna- tional coverage, and for putting out the greatest magazine on the pianeti. Peace Corps Lesotho loves Rue Morguel CULLEN WADE - MOHALES HOEK, SOUTH AFRICA I LOVE READING your magazine and I never felt that I had to write to complain about some- thing before until I read RM#86. As a Japanese Canadian 1 love all the attention that you have give to Japanese movies, and I love seeing them on the cover of your magazine. But I could not help but feel offended by some of the com- ments your writers made. In the review of Jack the Ripper, Jessa Sobczuk made some incor- rect references to this movie and tried to cate- gorize it simply as a violent pink film, which is very wrong. I don’t know where she was get- ting her information from but she failed to look past any of the blood on the screen, deciding to comment about “breast-slashing” and “crotch- gouging” but without mention of how pinku films could be highly intellectual. In 1 976 Japan was going through some tremendous changes which were reflected in many movies of the time. Maybe if she knew more about Japan she would see the subtle glimpses of political and social commentary. But instead she made an uncautious comment about a “wet chopstick.” Chopsticks are an invention of the Chinese, not Japanese! Very offensive to most Japanese people. Two pages later, in his review of The Watcher in the Attic, Jason Lapeyre says “say what you want about the Japanese.\" Again, that is so offensive to say to a culture. Why would you print those words to let people say what they want about another culture? He also says that Japanese people are “sexual deviants” which is also very wrong and very offensive. My guess is that you do not have any Japanese people or people with Japanese heritage on your writing staff or you would have seen just how offensive this is. I still like your magazine but I do not like this thing about it. I hope that you do something to apologize to fans of your magazine who are coming from a Japanese background. Y. AOKI - ELDINBURG, ONTARIO LET ME GUSH about what I love about your magazine - the comprehensive coverage of horror as a medium (print, video, audio, col- lectibles); the articulate way in which the ma- terial is presented; the massive number of reviews: and the range of articles that you pres- ent (everything from the top 50 gore movies to a discussion of horror’s 19th-century roots). You’ve hooked me. I’ll be a lifelong subscriber from here on out. JENNIFER SPARENBERG - ADDRESS WITHHELD I PURCHASED the Deluxe Edition of Friday the 13thPart3.Jt\\e 3-D option is very cool but the upsetting part is that the audio commentary that was recorded for the box set is not included and its original ending is not included either.

And now. fans will get a chance to share in former Fa- mous Monsters editor and writer Forrest J Ackerman’s most impres- sive treasures when his estate goes up for auction (on April 30 and May 1). as per Ackerman’s last will and testament. “You will really see the legacy of the greatest fan who ever lived.” says Joe Maddalena, President and CEO of auction house Profiles in History. A self-professed fan oi Famous Monsters who knew Forty personally. Mad- dalena specializes in prestigious Holly- wood memorabilia, among other collectibles. “We’ve been selling bits and pieces of Forty's collection for years, which was really his sole source of income.” Maddalena notes. “After he passed away, his estate contacted us and said they thought we would do the best job handling the entire collection.” Ackerman’s best friend and caretaker, Joe Moe. says that Ackerman didn’t want the collection to be preserved. “Forty really wanted the pieces to go to genre fans who would value them, take care of them and hopefully share them.\" Maddalena hopes the .sale will raise at least S500.000. which will go to a close group of Ack- ennan's friends who helped him throughout his life, in accordance with his final wishes. Thou- sands of items will be offered, including several exceptionally unique pieces of horror history, such as the monocle Fritz Lang used while di- recting Metropolis, Bela Lugosi's robe from The Raven and the vampire cape he wore both on stage and in Plan 9 from Outer Space. But the most desirable item is the ring worn by Lugosi in From Ackerman’s Vault: Bela Lugosi's Dracula ring, a vintage Frankenstein poster and a copy ofBram Stoker's Dracula signed by various genre celebrides. Dracula, a piece that Ackemian rarely took off. “There's never been a piece of this stature on the market,” advises Maddalena, who estimates the ring is worth S20.000 to 530,000. but may go for significantly more. Thousands of other items from Ackerman's col- lection will be available, many priced to give even fans on a modest budget a chance at buying a piece of fantastic film history. “As we’re going through the stuff, there are so many cool things,\" says Maddalena. “Forty was the first person to dress up and go to a con in char- acter. We found the Space Patrol costume he wore to the first World’s Science Fiction Convention in the 1 930s. There are also his original handwritten manuscripts for Famous Monsters. Then there's a teddy bear given to Forty by Fritz Lang. Lang had two of these bears specially made - one went to Forty, and the other he was buried with. How do you put a value on something like that?” Moe says that although he was initially sad- dened about the collection being sold off. he real- ized that it was really “Uncle Forry” himself that brought the memorabilia to life. \"Without Forty sitting there telling stories and giving context, it really wasn't ever going to be like when he was alive. ... I hope that other fans will take comfort in knowing that part of the pur- pose of this sale is to preserve the experience of Forty’s generosity.” Further infonnation on the sale is available at profilesinhistory.com. including an auction cata- logue. Auction bids can be placed cither in per- son. via mail, phone, fax or live on the internet via liveauctioncers.com. PAUL CORUPE literary festival coming to Dublin If you’re travelling to Dublin in the spring, pack garlic and holy water because this April the historic city is welcoming vampires. Every year the Irish capital hosts the Dublin: One City. One Book festival, and Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula is the official selection for 2009. Now in its fourth year. One City, One Book is the brainchild of Dublin-area librarians, in- cluding Jane Alger, who had taken noted that similar literary events had met with great suc- cess in other cities, such as Seattle and New York. In 2006 Alger decided it was time that her city celebrated its rich literary history as well. \"We decided to select books which have a connection with Dublin, either through con- tent or author.” Alger tells Rue Morgue. “The idea is to get everyone - citizens and visitors alike - to read and talk about the same book at the same time.” After celebrating such Irish classics as Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver's Travels and Se- bastian Barry’s ..4 Long, Long Way, the festi- val .organizers chose this year to explore the dark side of the country’s imagination. \"For quite some time we at Dublin City Li- braries have wanted to highlight Dublin’s gothic literary her- itage and to ‘brand’ Bram Stoker as a Dubliner,” says Alger of the author, who spent his formative years in the country's capital. \"One City, One Book works best when the selected book lends itself to activities and events. You can see that to a certain extent Drac- ula selected itself’ The month-long festival begins on April 2nd with a dramatic re-enactment of Stoker’s wedding to Florence Balcombe in 1 898 at St. Anne’s Church. Additional events will be held at locations throughout the city, and in- clude scholarly lectures, live readings of gothic literature, film screenings, guided cas- tle tours and a chance to see Stoker’s former Bram Stoker's former Dublin residence, (left) Penguin's new special edition, and (below) the author. residence. Youngsters will have an opportu- nity to learn about the conquests of Vlad the Impaler as part of the children’s program- ming. while adults can do their san- guinary civic duty through special Count-sanctioned blood drives. The extravaganza will pro- vide even the most ardent Stoker fans with the chance to assess his 1897 novel in a new light. Seminars will explore every facet of the story and its creator, from examinations of the family and sites that in- fluenced Stoker’s early life, to an analysis of the gothic literature that in- spired him to create his masterpiece. The guest speaker roster will be topped off by renowned Canadian Dracula scholar and Professor Emerita of the Memorial Uni- versity of Newfoundland, Dr. Elizabeth Miller, who closes the festival on April 28 with a talk titled Bram Stoker’s Dracula: From Notes to Novel, which will detail the meticulous constniction of the vampire mas- terpiece. Even Penguin Books is cele- brating the novel with a special edition featuring One City. One Book commemorative cover Though Dublin has no plans to commemorate other horror tomes in the future. Alger has faith in this year’s se- lection. \"Our theme is ‘You’ve seen the films, now read the book.' In the past, all events have attracted full attendance. Most events are free and two hotels are offering spe- al rates. We have no doubt that Dracula will be a success.” For more information visit dubiinonecityonebook.ie.

MiWPAYS TRIBUTE TO THE ICON IN A RECENTLY UNEARTHED INTERVIEW WITH LUX AND HIS LONG-TIME MUSICAL AND UFE PARTNER f OISOFL W. 0 HERE'S AN OLD CLICHE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT 81Z, that icons are seldom like the real-life people who por- tray them. It's what separates the sultry Vampira from the private and eccentric Maila Nurmi; what differentiates Alice Cooper the shock rock icon from Vincent Furnier the Christian Republican; or the chaotic Coffin Joe from de- termined filmmaker Jose Mojica Marins. Oddly, this is not something that re- ally applied to Lux Interior, the feral half man, half monster who prowled and howled his way to rock and roll infamy as part of the defining cult band The framriR By the time Rue Morgue made its acquaintance with The Cramps a num- ber of years ago, the man who had been born in Ohio on October 21 , 1 946 as Erick Lee Purkhiser had already transformed himself into a werewolf zombie from hell who had seemingly thrown away the antidote that would bring him back to normalcy. Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson may have been schooled in shock theatrics by Alice Cooper, but Lux Interior skipped class that day; part Elvis, part Ghoulardi, he may have been the world's most dangerous sexual The latex-clad yin to his yang, of course, was Poison Ivy Rorschach (born: Kristy Mariana Wallace), who he met and fell in love with in California during X “ITHItK WE IVEwl irogsis” LUXINTERIor We Of HORROR the early 70s, They married and made their way to New York in 1975, where they formed the band. Lux took his stage name from a car commerciai, while ivy’s apparentiy came to her in a dream. Back in 1976 when The Cramps first started out, punk was in the air and everything was possible - attitude and concept were more important to starting a group than musicai ability, it was in this era of optimism that The Cramps were born, but rather than gravitating to the political (and apolitical) centre of punk, they drew from the fringe, a late-night retro spookshow sleaziness that came to define their iook and sound. Before even the Misfits, The Cramps were jamming their songs fuli of ailusions to trash cuiture and long-forgotten B-movies. An early moment saw them perform for patients at the Cal- ifornia State Mental Hospital in what would become their leg- endary response to Johnny Cash's concert at Folsom Prison. An anomaly from the start, The Cramps kicked open the cellar door with a series of covers, mainly record junkie obscurities from a bygone era. Their ongoing devotion to this lost tradition of rarities throughout their ca- reer eventually garnered them credit for rediscovering music that had long been buried. But The Cramps did something more than resurrect those sounds, they stran- gled them with ear-scraping guitar fuzz and gobbled them up with Interior's unmis- takable Saturday afternoon horror show vocals. In so doing they gave birth to something putridly their own: bad music for bad people. As the '708 croaked at the feet of the antiseptic '80s, The Cramps took their wildly unhinged show on the road. They began covering tunes from movies by Herschell Gordon Lewis and Russ Meyer, which fit well with the sexual allure of guitarist Ivy and a rotating number of bikini-clad vixens on bass, not to mention Lux’s crazed and chaotic stage performance. As J.H. Sasfy’s liner notes in the band’s debut EP proclaimed: “The Cramps don’t pummel and you won’t pogo. They ooze; you'll throb.” No ques- tion, this was a new punk and the disease was catch- ing; soon the imitators were imitating, eventually spawning psychofaiily. Far gone in their weird, .wild world. The Cramps never embraced what they fathered, and in reality no one managed to equal them stylistically. In a typical move, tiiey chose instead to further obsess over their musical crushes: rockabilly, surf, biker music and hard rock. Their sound was anti-mainstream, their hits - “Human Fly,” “Goo Goo Muck,\" “Bikini Girls With Machine Guns,\" “Eyeball in My Martini,\" \"Big Black Witchcraft Rock” - were anti-hits, and always sounded best around Hal- loween. Along the way, they left their mark in a few horror movies: The Return of the Living Dead, Near Dark, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Francis Ford Coppola’s Dracula, to which Interior would lend his growling voice as a creature of the night. And although the albums came slow, the shows continued as late as November 2008, mere months before interior suddenly died due to an aortic dissection. As one writer from The Guardian noted, “It is hard to think of Lux Interior as dead, despite what reports say. Then again, it was always hard to think of him as alive. A manic ghoulish presence who slithered on stage like the somnam- bulist from The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, Lux transformed rock and roll's gospel of sex and rebellion into a mantra of morbidity and perversion. He not only em- bodied the beastly instincts in ttre music, he shamanized them.\" News of Interior’s death brought us back to 2003, when The Cramps first got in touch with Rue Afo/gue. Apparently, they had been following the magazine and were happy when we noted their place within horror culture. We met in LA where they lived, shopped a little and then went to eat at a local Mexican restaurant. At the time, the band had just released Fiends of Dope Island, which would become their last studio album. It was an easy vibe, and Lux and Ivy spoke thoughtfully about music, horror, movies, comics and other stuff, and although a small segment of the inter- view appeared in a past Rue Morgue article about The Cramps, the interview in its entirety never saw the light of day until now. So here it is, in remembrance of the orig- inal Creature from the Black Leather Lagoon... never rest in peace. I’M GOING TO START WITH A QUESTION THAT EVERYONE ASKS ME: WHY ARE YOU SO IN LOVE WITH HORROR? Lux: ’Cause I think we were bom sick! [laughs] I don't know why some people like horror and gore. I think maybe only our psychologist would know. It's a really good question but it’s a mystery to us. we can’t figure out why people are excited about what they’re excited about. We're turned on by horror; we like getting scared, we like the ten- sion and we like the sex that’s in these movies but I'm not sure why. I know it’s not for everybody be- cause we notice the effect when we're on tour and watching these movies; once the blood starts flowing, people start going to their bunks. I HEAR YOU ARE IN POSSESSION OF A VERY OLD AND EXTENSIVE HORROR COMIC COL- LECTION. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN COLLECTING? Lux: I don1 know, I hesitate to say. I've been col- lecting all my life. HOW MANY COMICS DO YOU HAVE? Rooms ftill. Pretty much most of them. Lux: We have most of the ones from the '40s and '50s to all the golden age stuff. It’s a pretty com- plete collection, all the Basil Wolverton stuff, all of those weird independent companies. Those small companies were the ones that made way-out comics, beyond the limits of what was really al- lowed - they managed to get stuff out. That stuff is really kind of evil stuff for kids to be reading. That collection is really important to us. HAVE YOU READ THEM ALL? Lux: Oh yeah. It’s interesting to go to certain is- sues and look at the stuff that happened. A friend of ours out here, he actually found - eight years ago - a panel in an EC comic, I think it was Tales From the Crypt, where there are drapes in the background and there is this little design that no one ever noticed up until the mid-1 980s or some- thing - the pattern on the drapes in the back- ground is of people in sexual positions. And you look at it and it looks so obvious but I don’t think that anybody but some de- viant little kid who’s looking at the sexy girl in the picture would notice the background. And what happened is that guy told us, and we told somebody and ftey told Russ ’ Cochran and he told William Gaines before Gaines died and Gaines was furious! That’s kind of a funny story, it is pretty wild because it is the kind of thing that you would get nervous about but there were all kinds of things like little hidden drawings. If you look at [Dr. Fredric Wertham’s 1954 polemic against comic books] Seduction of the Innocent, they show you how a guy’s muscle was actually a drawing of a pubic hair if you turned it upside down and looked at it. So that was pretty extravagantly anti-social stuff to be hap- pening in the ’50s when people were worried about all the moral issues of the day. SO SEDUCTION OF THE INNOCENT mSUl THAT FAR OFF THE MARK AFTER ALLI Lux: I think comics, especially the horror comics of the '50s, kind of spawned a kind of mindset. People you wouldn’t expect, like Paul Simon, Carol King, these kind of people, they talk about having their minds bent by these kinds of comic books. I ttiink the horror comics of the ’50s gave way to the pop art of the ’60s and the hippies and LSD and all that shit that came later. It was really the first real deviant counterculture - that’s where it began. WHO ARE THE MODERN DEVIANTS TODAY? Lux: Britney Spears, that’s who’s doing it today, that’s where it’s happen- ing! [laughs] I don't know, I’m a little worried. I know that Rolling Stone is saying “rock is back,” although we never thought it left - it’s back over there at Rolling Stone, I guess, I’m kind of feeling like maybe something is getting better a little bit but, boy, these are bleak times to me for deviant counterculture. I GUESS THAT’S ONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE FASCINATED BY THE PAST. I always think it’s funny when people say, “Why do you like all that old stuff? You know, you’re way behind the '5^ times” or something. Well, we like that old stuff because ' it’s way better than anything that’s happening now for the most part. Of course, we do love popular culture and the things happening now we have great hope for - but ' ttiere’s no reason to forget tiie things that happened in ■ \" the past. YOUR MUSIC HAS APPEARED IN A NUMBER OF HOR- ROR MOVIES OVER THE YEARS. HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH ONES TO LEND IT TO? We really don’t have a policy with respect to what hor- ror films we license music to, it’s pretty much a case-by- case basis. Some movies are better than others, obviously, but we have no strict policy and some of our music is not even owned by us, so we don’t really have a say in that. ONE OF THE MANY LEGENDARY THINGS THAT THE CRAMPS DID WAS THE GIG AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL IN NAPA. WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING AS OUTRAGEOUS AS THAT AGAIN? Yeah, one time I tried to organize something out of a prison in the Mid- west, I think it was near Minneapolis or something, and that fell through. I’m not sure why, I never recall the details of why some- thing never happened. But what we really want to do is a gig at the Tehachapi Women’s Prison, 'cause that’s what Wanda Jackson sings about in “Riot In Cell Block #9.\" That would be the other dream thing besides Napa - The Cramps live at Hie Tehachapi, but even the men’s prison could be Interesting, definitely. Mental hospitals first, prisons next, and I don’t know what’s after diat. We feel part of that Johnny Cash tradition of playing for peo- ple who have for one reason or another come to trouble. We’ll come to them. It could be us, it’s afine line some- times how close are you to doing something that’s going to get you locked up for good? Who knows? HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CLOSE CALLS? Luxi I remember one time we were touring in Toronto and I went out to get coffee at 6 a.m. or something like that and this punk girl walked up and said, “Lux, what are you doing out here?\" And I said, \"Well, I'm looking for coffee.” And she said “There’s no place to get coffee right now, come over to my place and I’ll make you some.” We went to her house and as we were walking in somebody had been murdered in the apartment next to her, and I know that it seems like I'm making this up but it’s the exact truth. And they looked at me and my hands - first of all I wear black gloves and I always have black on my hands after we play, and I had big cuts on my hands from throwing the mic stand around. I looked like a big junkie in other words. And I had makeup run- ning down my face and everything. The cops took one look at me and they said, “Okay, deviant weirdo, right at the scene!\" Rock and roll is bound trough time to be questioned for murders. WHEN YOU AREN’T TOURING, WHAT DO LUX AND IVY DO ON HALLOWEEN? Lux; Gee, I don’t hardly remember a time when we weren’t gigging on Halloween, but when we lived in Hol- lywood, Ivy would get dressed up as a sexy witch and . 3 : there was this stairway ttiat went down to the door out- i side of our apartment - we lived on the second floor - I and it had a handle at the top of the floor that you could ^ pull and it would open the door at the bottom of the I steps. So we'd play weird theremin music, and when ^ the kids would come they could see her through the <§ glass door walking down the steps, and when she got halfway down I would open the door f above, so the door would open by itself, scared a lot of kids. ' IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE YOU TOURED. WHY SO LONG? : Lux: Well, I'll try to be concise. Our first record company completely ignored our . contract and we had to sue them to get off the label. Our second record company went out of business upon the release of oui album; die next record company after tha went out of business as well; and the las record company we had, the owner of th company was arrested and the guy who toe - over hated our band and told us so. So after i of that crap we decided that none of these pe pie have their shit together so we’ll start c own record label, and that’s what we dld.Anu in each of these cases it took a year and a half of talking to lawyers and trying to get off the old label, and then we had to find a new label, and this year instead of trying to find a new label we just started our own and, boy, that’s been great for us. As near as we can see, me and Ivy are doing a way better job than any of these hot professional peo- ple with their staff. It’s just great. ARE YOU IN CONTROL OF YOUR MUSIC NOW MORE THAN EVER BEFORE? , . It doesn’t really affect it. There was only one time in our 27 -year history that there’s ever been someone from a record company at a recording session of ours, and that was when we did “Surfin’ Dead,” and that was a friend of ours who we enjoyed having there. But die rest of the time we’ve never had any discussion with record companies about what we should do, they just do what we tell them to and that works for us. So we’ve never had a problem that way, it never really has made a difference creatively. I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU WANTED THE CRAMPS TO BE A BAND THAT PEO- PLE WOULD BE AFRAID OF. ir/B qWVf5T ttTS The Cramps’ auspicious debut of instrumental rock, ’60s punk and psychedelia only hints at the signature psychobilily they later came to be known for. The liner notes, however, capture the vibe pretty nicely: “...the sound of Southern culture failing apart in a blaze of shudders and hiccups.” ft’s “Human Fly\" and four re- vamped oldies - including a delirious take on the de- mented Trashmen tune “Surfin’ Bird\" - cobbled into a five-track EP, which was produced by Big Star frontman Alex Chilton. 1® This debut LP features an intense minimalist approach with two guitars, no bass, caveman-style drumming and Lux Interior’s monotonous vocals drooling over honurama lyrics. Songs the Lord Taught Us is an art/trashabilly seance set to file sick sound of reverb bouncing off bat cave walls. Highlights; “I Was a Teenage Werewolf,’’ “Zombie Dance” and “TV Set,” a nas^ little ditty about hiding a severed head. It’s an infectious introduction to the band’s primordial sound. J® mi fsywrmic A slicker sound and slower tempo follows guitarist Bryan Gregory’s departure from the band (he was replaced by Kid Congo), and while tonally less intense. Psychedelic Jungle sW boasts plenty of prime Cramps psychobillia. “Voodoo Idol” shakes a stick at hypnotic punk blues, while “600 Goo Muck\" was later featured in Texas Chain- saw Massacre 2. 1® 1BS3 Of rmu A disturbed live set recorded at the legendary Pep- permint Lounge in 1983, Sme// of Fema/e showcases the band at the height of its primitive phase; Poison Ivy and Congo Powers batter the audience with swampy riffs and fuzzy chords, while Nick Knox bashes his skins without the civility of a bass player. Lux Interior, meanwhile, wrecks his vocal chords and (occasion- ally) a harmonica. Highlights include \"Faster Pussy- cat,” “I Ain’t Nothing But a Gorehound\" and “Psychotic Reaction.\"The album also includes the studio version of \"Surfin’ Dead,” written and recorded, of course, for Return of the Living Dead. fiG 15S3 rr w sow lBS4?At>WWCrC!!5At>P?0(>tC igssAWTtiA!miti.vis 188-/ mmimm “Sheena’s in a Goth Gang,\" “Hypno Sex Ray\" and \"Wet Nightmare.\" fiG 2003 PMw or wrc w After a long absence, the Cramps kick the crypt doors open on Rends of Dope Island wWh a me^nQ\\^Mr mon- ster called “Big Black Witchcraft Rock\" - a skuil-fractur- ing overture to the thirteen-song catalogue of depravity and madness that lies within. The Cramps remain faitti- ful to their religion of B-horror and psycho-sex stomped up in tribal beats, primal rock rhythms and nightmare- inducing psychedelia. Swamp rockers, rockabilly enthu- siasts and ghoul surfers will always owe a huge debt to The Cramps, and the reason why can be heard here on “Papa Satan Sang Louie,\" “Dr. Fucker MD” and “Mojo From Mars,” not to mention history lessons such as “Taboo,\" “Hang Up” and “Oowee Baby.\" G® 2804 tev TO Haw a WONSTtt! This double CD on the Cramps' own label Vengeance compiles 1 43 minutes of early demos and live stuff from the clammy womb of the band’s prehistoric past. Almost 30 years later, the Cramps still prove themseives the true rock ’n’ roll Bride of Frankenstein, and I can tell you that they are indirectly responsible for the birth of this very publication, so it’s time to renew vows with the coolest band in the history of, well, history. Tfi 1884 rtAMCJ05 1888 STA!/ 5!M 18r/ Clj WAT nw CAWV!lLt 1881 LOW HW. W) MtaW A fifteen-cut compilation fusing Gravest Hits with content from Bad Music For Bad People-, two ear album cuts replace “TV Set” and \"Uranium Rock.\" Essentially, the US version of Off the Bone, Bad Ml for Bad People was released a couple of years after band was dumped by its former label, IRS. It featu unreleased British B-sides, singles and other obsc gems such as “She Said,” which sounds like Lux try to sing through a mouthful of dental cotton! Also eluded: Cramps classic “Human Fly\" (\"I’ve got 96 te in 96 eyes”), a tear-up of Charlie Feathers’ “I Cr Hardly Stand It” and the iconic yellow grinning grea skull cover art by Stephen Blickenstaff. Tfl A Date With Elvis marks an important turn in the bar evolution. Of note is a switch in lyrical content fr ghoul rock to devil sex, evident in tunes such as \"■ Hot Pearl Snatch,” “Can Your Pussy Do the Doc “Comfed Dames,” “(Hot Pool Of) Womanneed,\" “Wh; Inside a Girl?\" and others. Ivy handles guitar and b duties and even sings on a breezy tongue-in-cheek t lad called “Kizmiaz,” as well as “Get Off The Roe which B-movie mavens out there will recognize as theme from She Devils on Wheels. m As the title suggests, this one was recorded one night in Auckland, New Zealand (in 1 986). Here, The Cramps’ early primitivism gives way to full-bodied decadence, probably as a result of a newly acquired bassist. Candy Dei Mar. Ivy keeps the raunch at eleven, however, and the opening chords of “The Hot Pearl Snatch” make sure things stay loud and messy. Most of these tunes are taken from A Date With Elvis, which makes Rockinnreelin... kind of a live version of that album, Stay S/cW remains one of the best-realized albums in the band’s career, mixing as it does early period ghoul rock (“Creature From the Black Leather Lagoon,” “God Damn Rock ’n’ Roll\"), ’50s rawk (“Bop Pills,” “Daisys Up Your Butterfly”), sex ’n’ sin (“Bikini Girls With Ma- chine Guns,” “All Women are Bad”) and B-psychedelia (“Journey to the Center of a Girl,” “Saddle Up a Buzz Buzz”). Outrageous, bedevilled, loud and baaad. Stay S/cW features Lux at the height of his Demented Elvis phase. fiG Those who ever wondered what The Cramps would sound like doing biker music need wonder no more with Look Mom, No Head!, a riotous party of leather and chrome. Gone are bassist Candy Del Mar and long-time drummer Nick Knox, to be replaced by Slim Chance and guest drummer Nick Sclavunos (from Nick Cave's Bad Seeds band). Led by Lux and Ivy, the foursome strikes hard stomp rock 'n’ roll done up real bad - an overture to a decade that, ironically, would give us political correctness. Tfi Less horror-fried than previous records, Flamejob oozes with slick licks and bombastic production, cour- tesy of Beach Boys engineer Earle Mankey, who en- hances the psychobilly sound with cleaner bass lines, more defined drums and emphasis on Poison Ivy’s jangly cowpunk guitar. Standout cuts include “Mean Machine,\" “Ultra Twist\" and “Nest of the Cuckoo Bird.\" Lyrically it’s pretty much all sex, drugs and double en- tendre on Flamejob, which features a plll-poppin’ drug anthem (“Let’s get Fucked Up\") and a threadbare cover of “Route 66.\" Tfi From ttie guttural howl of “Cramp Stomp,” it’s obvious that Lux, Ivy and co. are still in the business of scaring people on this record. Overall, Big Beat From Badsville retreads some of the material already covered in earlier efforts (notably Flamejob) but there are still definite highlights: “God Monster,” “It Thing Hard-On,” Weil, we don’t put up with shit and we demand respect because we feel like we always want to have integrity in what we do. We observed from other bands we know, and in the early days how we were being treated - we saw that a lot of people treat rock and roll bands like they’re morons and have no brains, which is true in a lot of cases but isn't true in our case. It’s kind of like this; we feel that we’re representatives of a subculture we spawned. Our fans are people like us, and when somebody tries to make The Cramps into something less important or one more band or something like that, we won’t stand for that. There’s a lot going against any rock and roll band and we see it as we have to defend what we stand for - it’s just as important as anything else. WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE POISON IVY GUITAR SOUND? I always ty to be as sparse as t can in my own playing; I always think of what I can take away. I do like music to be dramatic with the least amount of moods and the least amount of transitions. How can 1 strip it down to its bones and sfill have it naked and bony? It’s weird, because my playing is tough and violent but there is some kind of girly quality about it, but not like the horrible cliche that it's weaker. I think in my playing there’s a beauty - a prettiness to it - that you could say is a girly aspect. I don’t think it’s just because I’m a girl, I think it’s because Lux and I both have Venus as strong elements in our astrology, and Venus is the planet of beauty, and so I think however messy and wild we get. we always make sure that we start out [beautiful] before we get messed up. THE CRAMPS FOUNT OF INSPIRATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN OBSCURE HORROR AND BURLESQUE. WHAT FASCINATES YOU ABOUT SEXPLOITATION AND B-HORROR? ■; Lux: I guess because there's a high level of honesty and real personal creativity that went into those horror movies. It's more interesting because these things are like what we consider folk art, they’re things that real people have an idea of, and real people make happen, as opposed to when someone makes a movie today and you've gotta go and have a meeting with twelve ac- countants and fifteen lawyers or something, and before long the movie doesn’t make any sense at all, Herschell Gordon Lewis - here's somebody who’s made 30 movies, and it was him and his friend Dave Friedman, basically, who did all this stuff. And these movies are more valuable today than a lot of major motion pictures because they’re real. The women in his pictures were prob- ably wearing clothes that they bought and not something some team of costume designers came up with, and they were filmed in places that really existed, I think it’s so much more interesting be- cause you’re actually seeing a view of real life, and that’s not something you get easily. HOW DO YT)U SEE YOUR LATEST ALBUM, FIENDS FROM DOPE ISLAND, IN TERMS OF YOUR HISTORY? I think the only thing that makes this album different for us is that we finally said, “that’s it - we don't have to pay at- tention to anybody else, we can just do what we want.\" I can’t help to think that made us more focussed and less confused by a bunch of people yapping at us, which we've never tried to let influence us in the past anyway. We’ve always been her- mits, and with this album we were really able to be hermits about it. HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER THE ART- WORK FOR YOUR ALBUMS? Lux: Rocky Schenck does art on some of our back cover pho- tos. and he directed some videos from Stay Sick!, “Bikini Girls With Machine Guns” and “Creature From the Black Leather Lagoon.\" He is a friend of ours; he’s become a big video di- rector but he started out with old-style Hollywood glamour photography in that film noir style and he would shoot the cover for Fiends of Dope Island and make it look like a photo from the ’20s. It was our concept, !•. , That whole scene, that was Rocky's living room, where we put branches and fake Spanish moss, and Rocky is really good at lighting things. I NOTICE THAT LUX OCCASIONALLY GETS PHOTO CREDITS ON THE ALBUMS, THOUGH. i' V Lux just loves to take photos of me. And I like to look at him.S APRMm\" Welcome o seeker of horror and wonderment!

IN THE THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE THE original title’s release, ttie Japanese franchise has erupted into a global phenome- non that has spawned nineteen terrifying video games, three live-action movies, an animated feature, a line of action figures, a series of novels, a monthly comic book and even an energy drink. “Capcom has been creating games with zombies for over fifteen years now,\" says Chris Kramer. Senior Director of XBOX 360 Communications and Community at Capcom. \"But in the last five or six years we’ve seen a huge upswing in the appear- ance of zombies as protagonists in games, as well as in film, TV, comics and boote. The key to the success of ttie /?£ fran- chise, however, is that zombies aren’t just popular with Japanese gamers, but tap into a much broader spectrum of people looking to be entertained and frightened.” Since its inception, the Resident Evil senes has attracted gamers who hunger for more than just a straight-up shooter. The intriguing survival horror/adventure plotline and state- of-the-art graphics have made the video game franchise synonymous with the kind of entertainment that genre fans desperately yearn for. Whether you are being attacked by a horde of zombies deep within the bowels of a secret re- search facility or battling a giant mutated dragonfly in the middle of Antarctica, the tales that play out in the games are uniformly fresh, loaded with gruesome adversaries and frights aplenty. The recently released Resident Evil 5 comes just over four years after the previ- ous installment, RE4, reinvented the franchise by moving away from the typical slow- moving, flesh-eating zombies that had proliferated all of the previous games. Instead, players were introduced to a completely new type of enemy; los ganados. Loosely translated as “the herd,” this new threat featured gangs of villagers infected with mind-controlling parasites that turned them into mindless killers ttiat are much more resourceful than the lumbering undead. \"While the RE series has traditionally been identified with zombies, with RE4 and now with RES, we’ve been moving away from the stereotypical shambling undead menaces and more towards infected humans, animals and genetic monstrosities,\" says Kramer. “[These] enemies, which are referred to as majinl-a Swahili word meaning ‘evil spirits’ - have been forcibly infected against their will with a virus that turns them into maddened, blood-crazed mutants. They still retain elements of flieir human intelligence, which is why tiiey move and react faster than zombies traditionally would, and it also explains why they’re able to use weapons and drive vehicles. Our majini are much closer to the infected people from 28 Days Laterthan, say, the zombies of Dawn of the Dead.\" in RES, players once again assume the identity of Chris Redfield, the former Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) member who first appeared in the orig- • inal RE game, as well as Resident Evil: Code: Veronica and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles. This time, he’s dis- patched to the fictional African country of Kijuju, where he teams up with fellow agent Sheva Alomar to track down die origin of the T-Virus, the deadly agent that the Umbrella Cor- 1 poration unleashed on the innocent inhabitants of Raccoon City a decade earlier. Fighting for survival in the harsh sunlight of Kijuju’s majinh infested cities is a far cry from the perpetually gloomy, mist- shrouded streets of Raccoon City. It’s here, and in other environments such as an oil refinery, abandoned mine and an assembly area where public executions are conducted by a frightening behemoth wielding a gigantic axe, that players must battle for their lives. “The team decided to set this game in Africa to both showcase technology and wrap up some loose plot threads that have been dangling over the RE storyline for 3 24 more than a decade,” explains Kramer. \"On the tech side, the developers wanted to take advantage of the current genera- tion of game consoles’ graphical prowess by producing spectacular real-time lighting effects and giving sunlight ex- teriors a hard, bright glare that makes the daylight as omi- nous as the shadows.\" Indeed, the blinding sunlight is an enemy in and of itself; when players move from areas of extreme darkness into the open (or vice versa) they have to wait until their character’s eyes adjust before they can see clearly again. This new dy- namic makes your character vulnerable to enemy attack and notches up the suspense of moving into an unexplored re- gion. But move you must, as lingering in any one spot for too long attracts hordes of enemies. While original fif game designer Shinji Mikami was heav- ily influenced by Romero’s Living Dead movies, the design- ers of RES. headed by Chief Producer Jun Takeuchi, decided to model a great deal of the look and feel of the latest sequel after Ridley Scott’s film Blackhawk Down. This influence is apparent in the intense combat scenarios that players face while traversing the cities’ myriad labyrinthine slums. RES once again utilizes the same over-the-shoulder per- spective as RE4. It also boasts a brand new real-time inventory system, which means that players can no longer pause the game to change weapons or use an item. Although some may dislike this update (which was also used in last year's Alone in the Dark reboot), the inability to pause ramps up the fright fac- tor, especially when you’re in the middle of a particularly fran- tic attack. Aside from the majini, the game also features an entirely new lineup of terrifying monsters. “I am endlessly disgusted by a new enemy type called kip- ipepo,\" confesses Kramer, “which is a flying [creature] that will often spawn out of the bloody neck stump of an enemy after a player scores a headshot. Moments after the baddie’s head disintegrates in a fine pink mist, this weird, webby, squirmy creature literally forces itself through the remaining neck stump, spreads its wings and flies right towards your face.\" Joining the kipipepo is an assortment of infected animals, in- cluding dogs, lions, elephants and giant crocodiles. There are also a number of horrifically mutated monstrosities, such as a gigantic bat/scorpion hybrid and a Lovecraftian nightmare called the Kraken, which latches onto players with its power- ful tentacles. Regardless of whether or not gamers try to defend them- selves, or choose to go on the offensive, they’re going to be leaving a bloody swath behind them as they shoot, burn, stab and explode anyone and anything that’s blocking their paths. Each shot that finds its mark releases a jet of blood from the newly inflicted wound, while the high-octane, pulse-pounding batdes literally leave a mess of severed heads, limbs and other assorted body parts in their wake. All of this is realized via REs most photo-realistic graphics to date. The background environments are painstakingly de- tailed and fully destructible, meaning that, as with Dead Rising, players are able to use almost anything they find on the ground as a weapon, from a jagged piece of lumbertoa lead pipe. The game’s characters also share this ultra-realistic look and feel. In order to achieve Vn\\s, -Pulse director Jim Sonzero was hired to bring all of the action sequences to life. He subse- quently moved the production out of Japan and into Hollywood, where he had live tal- ent act out the various scenes in a mo- tion-control studio. He even went so far as filming the actors voicing all of the game’s dialogue in order to capture their facial movements, which were then utilized for the computer-ani- mated characters. Lastly, music has always played an important role in establishing the tone of the franchise’s games and heightening the aural experience of the players. RES is no exception; its impressive graphic design perfectly complemented by an equally im- pressive soundtrack. For the latest installment, audio director Kota Suzuki created an epic, har- rowing score for the game by employing a 103- piece orchestra and, for the first time in the history of the franchise, adding an original theme song which features Senegalese vocalist Oulimata Niang, whose mournful wailing is chilling. With its new storyline, gameplay ele- ments, music and monsters, RES is poised to become a standout ad- dition to the survival horror chise. When asked why he the series has become so popu- lar, Kramer is quick to point out REs technical proficiencies track record, before adding; what it all comes down to in end is that people just love to be scared.” 9 Resident Enemies: (top bottom) A behemoth, a kipipepo and a giant bat/scorpian hybrid. to MRNITO HNOM NODE oyi Msimum? , nummimim \\ IHESiUORi TITLES IHTHEFRflNCK I N MANY WAYS, THE SUCaSS OF THE RESIDENT EVIL GAMING FRAN- OIISE IS SIMPLY MIND-B0GGUN6. It has sold over 34 million copies, won a mul- titude of awards and has become the num- ber one selling survival horror game in the world. With the release of Resident Evil 5. there are now a total of nineteen titles for players to tackle, including various offshoots and special editions. Even though it didn’t re- lease the first widely available survival horror game - that honour goes to Infogrames/ln- terplay for 1 992’s Alone in the Darl((RMM4i - /?es/cfenf £w/ publisher Capcom is still re- sponsible for coining the marketing term “survival horror,\" which it used when the franchise debuted back in 1996. Influenced by horror movies in his native Japan, as well as cult classics such as Romero’s Night of the Living Dead, game designer Shinji Mikami was hired by the company to design a game based on an earlier Capcom title, 1989’s Sufto Homu {Sweet Home), which saw players moving through a haunted man- sion trying to take photographs of a precious art collection. Mikami developed Resident Evil, which is known as Biohazard in Japan, with the intent of immersing players in a dark, claustrophobic world populated with dripping zombies and all kinds of twisted aberrations. Join us as we take a closer look at the six core titles that shaped REs chilling world and made it a household name on both sides of the ocean. This is the title that started it all. Generally considered to be an overnight classic by fans and critics alike, it’s set in the fictional Midwestern American locate of Raccoon City. Here, players can take on the identity of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine; both members of elite police squad S.T.A.R.S. {Special Tactics and Rescue Service), is sent to investigate a number of murders reportedly involving cannibalism. Their in- vestigation leads them to a mansion where they uncover startling evi- dence that a research company called the Umbrella Corporation has released a viral agent, known as the T-Virus, into the area, which is mu- tating people and animals into flesh-eating zombies. Designed as a third-person shooter, this is the only title in the entire series that feahjres live-action opening and ending sequences. Gameplay consists of moving a 3-D character across a pre-rendered 2-D background, while your view of the game depends upon predetermined camera angles. Players collect weapons and ammunition, as well as first-aid sprays and coloured herbs that can be combined to create health boosts. Enemies include slow-moving human zombies, crows, snakes, wasps and a frightening assortment of mutated reptiles, giant spiders, pissed- off sharks, carnivorous plants and the infamous inside-out Doberman attack hounds. Even though it suffers from a frustrating save system and lengthy load times, flf stands the test of time because it focuses on exploration, puzzles and an engrossing narrative rather than just killing. Its remarkable unpredictability gives it high replay value to this day. 1 .* After the success of the original RE, other game developers were quick to reiease their own sur- vival horror titles, such as 1997’s Nightmare Crea- tures and Enemy Zero. Naturally, Capcom was eager to develop a sequel, and after several lengthy development delays RE2 hit store shelves in early 1998. Set just over two months after the original story, Raccoon City is now compietely infected by the T- Virus, which has leaked into the city's sewer system. In this outing, gamers can either play as Claire Redfield, who is looking for her missing brother (Chris, from the original title), or Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of duty on the Raccoon City Police Force. Gameplay is almost exactly the same as in the original: players once again battle zombies and col- lect items, all while trying to find a way out of the zombie-infested city. Along the way they discover a secret underground research facility and must battle against a virologist who has infected himself wiUi a new strain of the virus called the G-Vims, which has transformed him into a gelatinous fleshy blob bris- tling with razor-sharp spikes and flailing tentacles. Though It suffers from many of the same annoy- ing shortfalls (slow load times and system save prob- lems) as its predecessor, RE2 is still a remarkable success. This is partially due to the fact that, like the original, RE2 isn’t just a straightforward shooter since players need to use both guns and brains to beat this game. Sales in the US alone shattered industry records, with nearly 400,000 units sold during its re- lease weekend, grossing over $19 million. To date, RE2 has sold nearly five million copies of the Playstation version alone. Nemesis picks up the action 24 hours after the events of RE2. Players once again assume the role of Jill Valentine, who quit the S.T.A.R.S. team after the events of the first game. In this installment, players collect various parts re- quired to repair a tram that will take her out of Raccoon Cify while battling the usual assort- ment of zombies, as well as new, devastatingly powerful humanoid mutations called T-1 03s. The most challenging creature that players must face here, though. Is the titular Nemesis. This hulking giant is not only next to Impossible to fight in regular melee combat, but can use high-pow- ered weaponry, which makes it a very difficult oppo- nent. At the end of the game, Jill man- ages to escape by helicopter just as the US Govern- ment, In an at- tempt to contain the outbreak, sends a nuclear missile to deci- mate Raccoon City once and for all. For Nemesis, developers incorporated a few new character controls, including the ability to dodge and make a quick 180-degree turn. Health packs and the ability to reioad a game also appeared for the first time, while a re- vamped Al system made enemies smarter and much more deadly. Al- though RE3 is a far shorter game than its predecessors, its rad- ically improved graphics, reduced load times and wicked new auto-aim feature were ali wel- come additions. These improvements heiped jack the game’s fright factor to whole new levels of pants-shit- ting terror. However, 1999 proved to be a watershed year for sur- vival horror video games and Nemesis faced stiff competition from various copycat titles, including Castlevania, Clock Tower 2 and Silent Hill. As a result, it has only sold three-and- a-half million copies to date. NINTENDO Gi^ECUBE, PS2, SEGA DflEAMCAST With innovative new games such as Fear Effect, House of the Dead 2 and Dino Crisis \\umg gamers away, Capcom developers had to bring something new to the table to keep the RE franchise relevant. As a result, flfCVis the first sequel to move away from pre-rendered 2-D backgrounds, offering in- stead a brilliantly crafted 3-D environment. Unfortu- nately, even though it fea- tures some of the best CG sequences available at the time, the camera angles, though slightly tweaked, are still maddeningly pre- determined. RECV does, however, update the user controls to allow play- ers to wield two handguns at the same time, en- abling them to fire at two different opponents simultaneously. In this title, set three months after the destruction of Raccoon City, gamers once again assume the role of Claire Redfield, whose search for her brother leads her not only to France, but to a small island off the coast of Argentina and a secret Umbrella Cor- poration research facility in Antarctica. Dur- the journey she must battle zombies, giant worms, electrically charged mutant salamanders and behemoth black widow spiders, as well as contend an insane, genetically altered brother-and-sister team which subjects Claire to a series of sadistic games in the family’s opulent man- sion. Although critics hailed it as one of the most visually stunning games on the market and fans of the series appreci- ated the fact that it tied up a lot of the loose ends from the previous titles, its sales did not reflect its acclaim, and it has only moved three million units to date.

The digitally animated movie is set seven years after the destruction of Raccoon City and the dismantling of the Umbrella Corporation (the pharmaceutical research company that engi- neered the zombie-creating T-Virus), and opens with a spectacular scene in which a fully loaded jumbo jet crashes into an airport terminal, dis- gorging a horde of infected passengers. Also surviving the crash is Claire Redfield (of RE2i. who now works as an ecological advocate but must team up with special agent Leon Kennedy in order to escape the crash site. Along the way, they uncover a government con- spiracy that leads them to the offices of WilPharma, a new company that claims to have de- veloped a vaccine against the devas- tating T-Virus. While Degenera- dorfs script comes off as a bit pedantic at times, fans will undoubtedly rejoice over file copious amount of spilled blood, as well as the film’s slick, polished look. In fact, they may even find themselves unconsciously reaching for their game controllers, as the realistic animation is so reminiscent of the cut-scenes featured in the games and both Alyson Court {Resident Evil: Ckxle: Veronica) and Paul Mercier (Resident Evil 4) reprise their roles here. The DVD is packed with extras, including audio bloopers, a /?E5game preview and an in- depth look at how novice director Makoto Kamiya used live actors in a motion-control stu- dio to make the action in Degeneration as real- istic as possible. Fans of the live-action frilogy may be disappointed that Degeneration lacks the perky performance of Miila Jovovich and her ample, urn, assets, but honestly, this is how the RE movies should have looked from the get-go. LAST CHANCE LANCE hsiiieiit evil 'deqbneraiion Hoping to cash in on the release of the live-action Resident Evil movie, this prequel is set one day prior to the events of the original RE game. It follows Re- becca Chambers, a S.T.A.R.S. squad member who has just survived a helicopter crash in the mountains. Nearby, she discovers an es- caped prisoner, former marine Billy Coen, in an abandoned train filled with zombies. What sets this title apart from the previous outings is its new “partner zapping” system, which enables players to switch between characters on the fly. This is necessary, as each character has specialized abilities that can only be used in certain areas. For example, Rebecca can mix chemicals and navigate through tight spaces, while Billy can move the heavy stuff and has a lighter, which he can use to Ig- nite objects. Here, players battle oversized scorpi- ons, centipedes, bats and a giant bul- let-proof leech, as well as the fiend responsible for unleashing the T-Virus in the first place. Though the graphics are cutting edge and the new enemies extremely freaky-looking, RED is plagued with user control issues, problematic cam- era angles and a frustrating inventory system. Furthermore, the partner zapping system tends to be more of an inconven- ience than an enhancement. Fans of the franchise were extremely disappointed by this release, and many considered it an unwanted retread of old material. It was also the poorest selling title of all the core games. NINTB<DOGAMECUBE,PC,PS2,WU ; After the dismal performance of RED. developers spent several years trying to come up with a new di- rection for the franchise. The second iive-action movie, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, which h it theatres the year before, had basically followed the plot of Nemesis. After several false starts that saw a number of ideas rejected, plus one altered and released as a title in ttie Devil May Cry franchise, Capcom once again called upon Mikami to take the helm and steer the franchise back onto the path of com- merciai success. The final product is a game set six years after the destruction of Raccoon City and the apparent coiiapse of the Umbreiia Cor- poration. Leon Kennedy returns as a special agent who is dispatched to an unspecified Eu- ropean country to rescue the US President’s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a dangerous cult called Los llluminados. RE4 revolutionized the way that third-person shoot- ers look and play. Presented in a crisp, cinematic let- terbox format, it features drastically reduced loading times, a unique over-the-shoulder POV and, for the first time, fully controllable camera angles. Ammunition and health boosts are much more abundant, while inven- tory systems have been overhauled to allow players to carry more items. Combat is also significantly im- proved with the inclusion of laser-sighted weaponry and selective targeting, meaning players can now shoot enemies in the leg to drop them to the ground. Most notable, though, is a radical departure that could have sunk the franchise forever: this is the first RE title that doesn’t feature any flesh-eating zombies! Instead, players battle los ganados, a group of hu- mans infected with a brain parasite - a conceit that grants them the ability to climb and use weapons. After selling 500,000 copies in the first few months of its release and garner- ing numerous awards, including best game and best graphics at Spike TV’s 2005 awards show, it has be- come Capcom’s second best- selling title of all time.9 Resident Evil 4 's Leon Kennedy. vw “Without question one of the best fiims that has come out of Japan recentiy.” — MIDNiGHT EYE.COM NETFIIX FMTS : vyn/vw.facets.org Presented by: liSS™ tfPEPOlHT amliiS TtcTuRes .!“Gets:undef;your3kin,then inimediacteiy * Starts eatingaway ^t your inteflai orpns.\" •f; Watch ttie LATE BLOOMER trailer!; ! and others at: www.bonehouseasia.com DeMously rare...

S THE ABOVE QUOTE FROM THE VmiVTRAILER suggests, there are many angry spirits in Thailand. As viewers of Asian horror cinema can certainly attest, vengeful, rest- less, black magic-wielding ghosts haunt almost every Thai genre picture that wafts across to our shores. Curious, then, that none have addressed what must be the greatest source of vinyan in recent memory. On December 26, 2004 the world awoke to news of one of the deadliest natural disasters in history: a massive tsunami had washed away more than 225,000 people across South Asia, leaving countless others displaced, en- tire population centres destroyed. This harrowing event prompted Belgian filmmaker Fabrice du Welz [Caivaire) to go to Thailand and make a horror film that explores the emotional devastation left in its wake. His Vinyan is an Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Flies and Don’t Look Now descent into a hellish jungle populated by malevolent spirits. It follows European couple Jeanne and Paul Belman (Emmanuelle Beart, Ruftis Sewell), who are devastated by the loss of their son, Joshua. Six months after his disappearance in the tsunami, a clue emerges that he may still be alive in a remote village somewhere in Burma. The Belmans follow this lead beyond the point of reason, pushing deeper into the heart of darkness and battling terrors of the body and mind that include hostile terrain, underworld crime lords and a mysterious tribe of feral children. Despite the dominating ghostly atmosphere, this is not another Asian ghost- in-the-well story. And its focus on tourists at the mercy of a foreign menace bears no resemblance to Hostel, Touristas or The Ruins. The film most closely related to l/znyar? is the 1976 Spanish cult picture WhoCanKillaChild?byUai- ciso Ib^ez Semador, in which an English couple on holiday discovers an is- land of killer kids. This is no coincidence. “I was trying to remake it, but I was unable to secure the rights,\" explains du Welz by phone from Paris. “I remember the first time I saw the movie on VHS long ago, I was astonished. Serrador’s film is unique and 1 love it pas- sionately.

ALIVE ■ FAeRICEDUWELZ A few weeks after his quest fell through, the Asian tsunami hit. Widespread media coverage of the catastrophe left du Weiz feeling “uncomfortable” with Western media’s unequai treatment of the dead or missing, often slanting their sympathies towards the lost children of tourists rather than the locals. With the idea of a couple looking for their only child starting to percoiate, he travelled to Thailand to witness the situation for himself. It was there that he developed Vinyan's central theme: obsession. Those familiar with du Welz’s 2004 debut Calvaire may suspect the direc- tor has a few obsessions of his own, such as creating characters tormented by extreme grief, and the expioration of ever-worsening mental states. His latest could have also used the alternate title for Calvaire. The Ordeal. But while Calvalre's horror was situated strictly in a masculine sphere and used black humour to temper its masochistic violence, Vinyan is a motherlode of hopelessness. “Some people who really like Ca/va/re expected a lot from Vinyan, like they were waiting for Calvaire 2,” says du Welz. “These are two completely differ- ent movies. Calvairems a masculine film, about tie masculine aspect of my- self. With Vinyan, I wanted to reach the feminine side. It is about a woman who can’t accept her child’s death, her journey, her obsession with this one kid mother and child. It’s also a more experimental film. It is a non-realistic movie with a very realistic start that asks, ‘How can you deliver yourself from grief?' For this character, it is only through madness.” Vinyaifs experiments begin with the opening titles, an extended underwa- ter sequence that turns the screen blood red. complete with disorienting noise from French electronic composer Francois Eudes-Chanfrault {High Tension, Inside) rising like a tide. The colour crimson guides us first through the vivid, feverish chaos of a Bangkok sex district at night, brought to life by cine- matographer Benoit Debie {Calvaire, Caspar Noe’s In-eversible). but by the time the couple hops a boat to Burma it’s nothing but fog, torrential rains and mud, ail colour draining away as they penefrate the ghostly interior. (As du Welz says, “This is a different view of Thailand. This is not The Beach.\") Jeanne is so damaged that it’s possible her entire existence is questionable from the start. But wherever the line is crossed, this time it’s not the dead penetrating our world that we need to be afraid of. “I consider this a ghost story where ttie living could be dead and the dead could be alive,” explains the director. “The living enter the world of the dead, where they are contaminated by the fantastic. Slowly they are absorbed. And by the third act, it’s completely a mentel movie.” until she is delivered into many kids. The Mental trauma is paramount throughout the film, which creeps along at a fundamental link is between slow pace practically devoid of plot twists, methodically inching its way down- ward towards a complete breakdown. So despite the early release of photo- graphs from the set implying some kind of bloody jungle picture in the vein of •' Cannibal Holocaust, Vinyarfs gore is limited to a few nasty scenes - includ- ing a particularly graphic disembowelment. Rather, its terror comes from the unabashed use of a clan of vicious killer kids that recalls Village of ik the Damned or The Brood. \\ “Wnyanhasmanylinkstomovieslike T/reSrootf,” agrees du Welz, \\ “These kids come from inner demons and at one point they are the 3 > ' .. organic representation of the characters’ fantasy and obsessions. ** So yes, l//nyan could be a ‘killer kid’ movie.

I thought this was a way to be somewhat transgressive and poetic at the same time.” On these fronts, the film succeeds. However, initial reaction to Vinyan has been mixed. It premiered last year at the Venice Film Festival and Toronto’s In- ternational Film Festival, where the France/Belgium/UK co-production was snapped up by Sony for distribution. In France it managed a “forbidden under 1 2” rating, which allowed for theatrical release. But after moderate box office week shoot had to be reconfigured at the last moment when the produc- tion lost some funding), it was by ail accounts a gruelling battle with na- ture, the tides and time. Star Beart signed on willingly to the non-glamorous “no makeup trailer\" project, and was then pushed by the director into extreme situations without warning. (\"She played her role right to the edge, to the end,” says du Welz.) Additionally, the team wran- gled up to 300 children from remote villages who spoke no English. And returns in Europe it comes to North America this month straight to DVD (Columbia/TriStar) - complete witii an ugly box cover art collage that doesn’t exactly inspire confidence that the studio knows what the film is about. The director is pissed at the “cheap’’-looking artwork but has already come to terms with the public reaction. “After the release of Vinyan in France, some people said the film was too plastic, tiiat they could not connect to it. But that is the risk I took,” du Welz admits. “I did not want to make another genre film. ^ I am deeply in love with genre but I re- sist it. I try to find a more personal way. Ca/va/redivided audiences as well, but in time it found its own place. Vinyan provoked discussion and some very bad re- they worked closely with local cast and crew, including their consultants in the Thai mafia. “We sympathize a lot with the Thai people, even the mafia,” du Welz reveals. “They found us really friendly and in the end our line producer went fishing with the mafia guys. Most European and North American produc- tions come and shut out local people, give them the low- est jobs. We were five white guys and the rest were Thai crew. We went to prayer with them, we ate with them and shared everything. So it was an easy connection. If we succeeded it was because of these people. Especially at the end, when what we proposed was crazy, and they went along.” The shocking ending will leave some viewers per- plexed, others absolutely horrified. For du Welz, it was all or nothing: “I made the movie for that scene. If I didn’t views, and now it has this terrible DVD artwork. But the way I made it, with close friends and partners, and the experience of shooting it and actually delivering it is a miracle I’m very proud of. , ttwaslike/flpo//o73,theim- possible mission.\" Shot completely in Thai- land over seven weeks on a budget of $3.54 mil- lion (the original ten- succeed with the end, I failed the movie.” Whether or not North America embraces Vinyan on a grand scale, the director says he’s not finished making genre-crossing films that examine loss, madness and the cruelty of absence. In fact, he is already planning a follow-up. “I want to make this a trilogy on the same theme,” he reveals. “Part three will be made in Mexico. Very urban, very low budget, very extreme. That is all I can say because I hope to start another project, a French film noir, in September that flirts with Star Chamber [Peter Hyams’ film about a secret vigilante group].

Jenny and Steve, a British coupie, go away for a camping weekend, during which Steve pians to pro- pose. They find an isolated, de-. serted quarry with a beautiful beach and lay out their towels. Some noisy teenagers show up and quickly go from annoying and cheeky to insulting and menacing. Soon, the city folk find themselves running through the forest for their iives, pursued by the bioodthirsty adoiescents. A lesser film would fall off here, taking the easy route through hack-and-slash territory with card- board characters getting picked off one by one. What distinguishes Eden Lake is the tautness and in- teliigence of the script, the real- ness of its characters and some world-class acting. Jack O'Con- neli's performance as Brett, leader of the bullies, is powerful enough to make you want to reach through the screen and kill him with your bare hands, and it eievates the rest of the movie to near-greatness. The ending, judging from imdb.com comments, is aiready proving to be the real litmus test for audiences, but it doesn’t take away from the effectiveness of the first 90% of the film. Anchor Bay’s Home Movie had a much lower budget than Eden Lake, and consequently a much higher concept. David and Clare Poe have moved with their twin chiidren. Jack and Emily (played by Amber Joy Williams and Austin Williams), to a remote house in the woods to try to work out some famiiy problems. Clare is a psy- chologist and has a new HD cam- era to keep a video diary of her work. David, a pastor, uses the camera to document as much of the family as he can, clearly want- ing a Norman Rockwell-esque iife for his brood after some vagueiy described trouble in the past. Jack and Emily refuse to cooper- ate, though, and act out in ways that are at first disturbing and then increasingiy violent. Unfortunately, the movie very quickly gets stuck in a loop, perhaps because of the nature of the concept. David turns on the camera to record a whole- some family event. Jack and Emily act strange, and just as the cam- era notices some graphic example of Jack and Emily’s growing insan- ity, we cut to static and then to an event a few weeks later. Repeat ten times. Add to that, the impossibility of caring for the annoying parents and the silent kids (who have no PLAGUI TOWN dialogue for the first hour of the movie) and you get boredom in all the glory of High Definition. It’s hard to be scared of someone who just sits there and gives you the silent treatment. Finally, Dark Sky brings us one last set of youthful maniacs in Plague Town, a sort-of zombie movie about an American family out for a walk in the Irish country- side. They miss the last bus home and have to make it through the night among the requisite band of crazy locals who are hiding a dark secret, in this case that their chil- dren are deformed killers. This movie actually gets off to a great start with an energetic, wildly over-the-top scene set a century earlier that gives some back story to the plague and sets expectations high for the remainder of the film. That turns out to be a fatal mis- take. Another set of paper-thin characters, each irritating in their own way, quickly written dialogue, and some ridiculous casting choices (the dad looks about ten years older than one of his daugh- ters) cause this movie to lose the race even before the monsters get out of the gate. A couple of gory killings late in the movie attempt to fix the problem, but by then you’ll have checked your watch so many times you won’t care. From sociopaths to psychopaths to pseudo-zombies, the kids in these films get progressively less frightening the more they stray from reality. When it comes to chil- dren, maybe the terror comes from what they actually are. ^ SINGER GEORGE tORPSEGRINDER' FISHER TALKS TWO DECADES OF ATROCITY. CENSORSHIP AND ZOMBIES. COURTESY OF THE \"THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL BAND ON THE PUNET. PUTTING THE DEATH IN An unwavering dedication to musical brutality has earned them criti- cal condemnation, political hue and cry, and legions of loyal fans across the globe who have made them one of the most successful bands in extreme metal. Their oft-imitated combination of blistering technique, unbri- dled aggression and gore-soaked imagery has eschewed all trends. With their eleventh slab of metal currently in stores and a slot on a major summer tour. Cannibal Corpse are coming... and they bring death! The band members came together in Buffalo. New York in 1 988 with the intention of making the most bru- tal death metal possible. The original lineup included vo- calist Chris Barnes, guitarists Bob Rusay and Jack Owen, bassist Alex Webster and drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz. Within a year they were signed to Metel Blade, then re- ! leased their first album, Eaten Back to Life, in 1990. The group quickly gained notoriety for its nauseating odes to serial killers and zombies, and its ultra-gory album art. “The entire band wanted to write about that stuff,\" ex- plains affable current frontman George \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher, \"There was a band decision to write gore lyrics. They wanted the songs to be fucked up - zombies and things like that. I think it turned out good.\" Cannibal Corpse honed its chops on the next two albums, Butchered at Birth (1 991 ) and Tomb of the Mutilated (1 992). but began to shed members. Rusay was axed in favour of Malevolent Creation guitarist Rob Barrett before the recording of The Bleeding (^92A). In 1995 Barnes left to devote himself tijil-time to Six Feet Under, his side project with Obituary axe-man Allen West. Despite this, the group upped its aural assault, thanks in part to the re- cmitment of former Monstrosity throat Rsher, Their first recording together. Vile (1996). became the first death metal album to crack the Billboard Top 200 chart (at #151). Then. Barrett bowed out and ex-Nevermore guitarist Pat O'Brien added his deadly shred to the band’s arsenal. This lineup stormed through a series of monstrously technical and well-received albums that began with Ga/Zeryo/Su/t/tfe (1998) and continued through Bloodthirst(\\S92), Gore Obsessed (2002) and The Wretched Spawn (2004) before original gui- tarist Owen quit, citing a lack of interest in death metal. Barrett returned to the fold and the band released its definitive album, Kill(20QQ). Despite the changes in membership. Cannibal Corpse has never deviated from its established formula of intense musicianship and graphic subject matter. Songs such as \"Butchered"
