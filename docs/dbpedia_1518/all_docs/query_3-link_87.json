        "text": "New York’s Longest-Running Independent Film Studio Troma Entertainment (The Toxic Avenger, Cannibal! The Musical) Releases Hectic Knife, Which Critics Are Calling “Hilarious,” “The Ultimate Drinking Film,” and “Off the Rails on a Crazy Train of Violent Magnificence”\n\nTroma Entertainment, founded in 1974 and widely known for its surreal and gory masterpieces of B-horror, releases Hectic Knife, a feature-length slasher comedy like none other you’ve ever seen. The film, which premiered at the Druid Underground Film Festival in Brooklyn this past July, follows a down-and-out, self-hating, knife-wielding vigilante who must save humanity from an evil doctor intent on destroying the world.\n\nDirected by Greg DeLiso and starring Peter Litvin as the vigilante “Hectic” and JJ Brine as his arch nemesis “Piggly Doctor,” Hectic Knife is a bloody love letter to all of cinema. From Death Wish and Dirty Harry to The Positively True Story of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom, no movie is safe from send-up in this unique, bizarre, genre-bending action-horror-comedy that critics have called “hilarious,” “gonzo splatterific,” “a new genre of WTF cinema,” “the ultimate drinking film,” and “off the rails on a crazy train of violent magnificence wrapped in a golden wrapper of comedic genius.”\n\nDeLiso, who co-wrote Hectic Knife’s script along with directing, is an accomplished filmmaker with dozens of credits to his name, including two feature-length documentaries (Heavy Metal Picnic, Canada’s Best Kept Secret) and the television series Fake Henrik Zetterberg. DeLiso cites independent film giant Troma Entertainment as an early influence and inspiration. “Of all the self-help, directing 101, learn-how-to-talk-to-actors nonsense out there,” says DeLiso, “the only real nugget of truth comes from Troma’s co-founder Lloyd Kaufman: ‘Make your own damn movie.’ That’s the most important thing. And for me the next most important thing is working with a distribution company like Troma that understands the best thing for a movie is for people to see it.”\n\nLitvin, who composed Hectic Knife’s score, co-wrote its script, and produced the film along with starring in it, is a chart-topping music producer, engineer, and multi-instrumentalist known for his passion, experience, and relentless work ethic. Songs that Litvin has produced for others have amassed over 300 million views on Youtube. He has also written and produced over 10 full length records of his own music.\n\nJJ Brine, a musician, artist, actor, and controversial gallerist who’s been featured by Rolling Stone, Vice, New York Magazine, and The Wall Street Journal, has received rave reviews for his turn as the villainous Piggly Doctor in Hectic Knife. One film critic writes that Brine “filled every line with maniacal flamboyance as he blew up children’s heads and magically ripped out hearts.”\n\nHectic Knife world premiered on July 28, 2016 in Brooklyn, New York, as part of the Druid Underground Film Festival.\n\nAbout Troma Entertainment\n\nEstablished in 1974 by Yale friends Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, Troma Entertainment is arguably the longest-running independent movie studio in North America, and it’s one of the very few genuine brand names in the industry. World famous for movie classics like Kaufman’s The Toxic Avenger, Trey Parker’s Cannibal! The Musical, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, Class of Nuke ’em High, Charles Kaufman’s Mother’s Day and Tromeo & Juliet, Troma’s seminal films are now being remade as big-budget mainstream productions by the likes of Brett Ratner, Richard Saperstein, Akiva Goldsman, and Steven Pink. Early work of many of today’s luminaries can be found in Troma’s library of 1,000 films, cartoons, TV shows, and shorts. Jenna Fischer, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Costner, Fergie, Vincent D’Onofrio, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gunn, and Eli Roth are just a few. Troma’s latest in house productions are Return to Nuke ‘Em High: Volumes 1 & 2. Troma’s Blu-rays, DVDs, books, t-shirts, and movie merchandise can be purchased at Tromashop."
