        "text": "Horror musicals are such a strange concept that, even as a huge fan, I still find it hard to believe that they exist in the first place. From Little Shop of Horrors to Repo! The Genetic Opera, audiences are surprisingly okay with singing along to tongue-in-cheek violence and creepy characters. Of course, not all horror musicals are created equal, and Troma Entertainment has provided us with some of the weirdest ones out there. That’s why I’d like to take this opportunity to talk about my personal favorite Troma movie, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, which is approaching its 15th anniversary.\n\nLike most Troma films, the production of Poultrygeist was a horror story in and of itself. The script took several years to perfect, props and costumes had to be donated from other studios, and legendary producer/director Lloyd Kaufman was forced to take money out of his own retirement fund in order to help finance the project. Hell, the owners of the abandoned McDonald’s that served as the film’s main location even prohibited the filming of nude scenes, resulting in sexy reshoots in the basement of a nearby church.\n\nThis hard work eventually paid off, with the film finally releasing to a brief theatrical run in late 2006 and receiving surprisingly positive reviews when compared to other Troma movies. For those who haven’t seen this schlocky masterpiece, Poultrygeist follows a small-town boy named Arbie (Jason Yachanin) as he discovers that his ex-girlfriend Wendy (Kate Graham) has returned from college as a liberal activist and is now dating another woman. Irritated with Wendy’s anti-establishment views, Arbie takes on a job at the newly-opened American Chicken Bunker, where he meets other wacky characters like Denny, Paco Bell, Carl Jr and Hummus, all with their own bizarre idiosyncrasies playing off of offensive stereotypes.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bunker was built on top of a Native-American burial ground, and when vengeful spirits meet with the restaurant’s lack of food safety protocols, a disgusting plague is unleashed upon the unsuspecting customers. It’s not long before Arbie and company are surrounded by legions of mutant chicken zombies hell-bent on consuming human flesh, much like fast-food giants consume family-owned businesses. Faced with an impending apocalypse, the survivors must learn to set aside their differences in order to defeat this poultry-based menace.\n\nWhile this sounds like a bonkers movie on paper, it’s even crazier on the big screen. Last year’s Shakespeare’s Shitstorm may have done its best to live up to its name, but I still think that Poultrygeist is Troma’s most disgusting outing to date. Not only does it feature some of the most grotesque depictions of fast food to ever grace cinemas, but there’s also quite a bit of genuinely disconcerting gore and body horror on display once the chicken uprising begins.\n\nMy own personal history with Poultrygeist actually began long before the film came out, as a young me came across a promotional poster at a Toronto bus stop. While the cheesy tagline (“Humans… the other white meat”) and chicken-related imagery made it clear that the film wasn’t meant to be taken seriously, that screaming skull exploding with chicken parts was forever seared into my retinas. Years later, I finally gave the film a chance during a Troma binge and fell in love with its absurd critique of corporate America and the absolutely gnarly visuals.\n\nWhile the film contains way more than its fair share of potty humor (including an unforgettably cringe-inducing scene involving the late, great Joe Fleishaker and a cramped bathroom), the real laughs come in the form of over-the-top dialogue and intentionally cartoony direction. There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments here, especially when Lloyd uses the characters to express his own views on modern America.\n\nDespite the laughs, Poultrygeist is still an incredibly violent and mean-spirited picture, balancing the absurd humor with genuinely horrific moments that are sure to make you regret picking fried chicken as a midnight movie snack. For every comment about the evils of mega-corporations, you also get a scene where a mutant zombie rips off a man’s face and eats it like fried chicken skin, making it clear that the goal here is to shock you into learning something. In some ways, the movie is a perfect satire of a George Romero zombie flick, wearing its heart on its sleeve while tackling social issues much as those movies did.\n\nOf course, the actual musical sections of the film might be too much for some viewers, with obviously dubbed lyrics and exaggerated dancing that often goes on for quite a bit. Personally, I appreciate Lloyd’s cheesy approach to musical storytelling, but it’s clear that the end product isn’t for everyone. Fortunately, the songs themselves are all infernally catchy (I’m actually trying to get the main theme out of my head as I write this), even if the lyrics tend to try a little too hard to be offensive.\n\nIn fact, like most Troma productions, Poultrygeist doesn’t hold back with its heavy-handed political commentary and racial/sexual stereotypes. I know half the fun of a Troma movie is knowing that these flicks have no filter when commenting on serious issues, but more sensitive viewers should watch out for some particularly mean depictions of immigrants and the LGBT+ community. Of course, the inherent absurdity behind some of these moments is the joke in and of itself, and after checking out some of the film’s deleted scenes, I think things could have been a lot worse.\n\nThe whole thing only works because of the bizarre ensemble of memorable and likable characters, with their interactions making the depravity bearable. I know it’s strange to claim that these offensive stereotypes are likable, but there’s just so much heart behind the writing and cartoony performances that you can’t help but root for this group of oddballs. Even Kaufman himself gives a great performance as a possible future version of Arbie that never managed to escape the clutches of the Fast-Food industry, and there are plenty of cameos to look out for as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, Poultrygeist may be schlock in every meaning of the word, but it’s lovingly crafted schlock, and that makes all the difference. Despite the absurd plot and copious amounts of blood and guts (among even less palatable substances), the movie somehow manages to avoid being a cynical farce, and I think that genuine Troma spirit makes up for any and all narrative shortcomings. That’s why I’d recommend this one to any fan of horror musicals or even horror comedies in general, so long as you watch it on an empty stomach.\n\nBemoaning how Hollywood treats its franchises these days is quite the cliche. So much so that it’s become a favorite pastime for movie geeks all over the world. It’s even more “basic” to spill ink about the nostalgia treadmill that no studio exec can resist jumping on with a glee usually reserved for kids in candy stores. Specifically, they seem to have an aversion towards moving forward and sowing new ideas on grounds fans deem oh-so sacred. And yet, here we are on the precipice of yet another vaunted horror franchise reaching into the past to chart its creative future.\n\nNeve Campbell’s recent comments about Scream’s seventh installment compared it to Halloween’s 2018 recipe. The irony is David Gordon Green’s film owes a debt to Halloween H2O. To say nothing of Scream 4, which already riffed on the idea of an older Sidney Prescott facing off with not only another deranged teenager in a Ghostface mask but also her survivor’s guilt and complicated feelings about her hometown. Notice a theme?\n\nHorror is overflowing with original ideas and stories; this isn’t about the genre. But there’s something to say about the fact legacy films can’t quit examining, well, their legacies. A longing for the “good old” days and fears of upsetting even moderately vocal fanbases created a cul-de-sac for franchise horror with no way out in sight.\n\nBefore going any further, this isn’t some new creatively bankrupt phenomenon. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween famously tried that whole evolution thing in the 1980s. While connoisseurs appreciate those deviations now, those wild swings didn’t generate the necessary box office or fan response at the time. The Halloween franchise felt the sting so hard that they ensured everyone knew the fourth installment featured Michael Myers. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was comfort food for those who found Halloween III: Season of the Witch a little hard to digest. But only to a point. While Halloween 4 looked like a series going back to basics for most of its runtime, it did something very different in its final minutes that telegraphed a unique direction going forward. And yet, that moment gets explained away and rendered moot by the time Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers arrives one year later.\n\nThe creative urge for something new constantly clashes with the business need for something that prints money. The dollars and cents worshipers at the top of the industry often believe that taking the most minor creative risks makes the most sense because it leads to more dollars.\n\nThat’s why Nancy and her dad couldn’t escape Elm St. Or why Michael rarely stopped chasing his relatives. Or even the improbability that the Brody’s couldn’t escape Great White Sharks even while vacationing in the Bahamas. As the calendar turned and fandoms grew more significant, the demand for that type of thing only got louder. To quote one of the great fictional philosophers of our imaginary time, Philip J. Fry, “Clever things make people feel stupid and unexpected things make them feel scared!” Futurama’s insight is a bit harsh, but there’s still some truth buried in the satire.\n\nIn some cases, shifting to tried and true formulas is somewhat understandable. While they’re tacit admissions that sometimes the best idea is the first one, they’re also, at times, necessary business decisions. John Carpenter never envisioned Halloween as more than one movie. The same goes for Wes Craven and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Dollars to donuts, that’s probably the same story for most films that morph into the two words familiar to most people reading this website: intellectual property. That distinction comes with responsibilities to shareholders and CEOs and, no pun intended, the lifeblood of some companies. Ghostface is no longer just a person in a Spirit Halloween robe and a cheap dime store mask; Scream’s chief killer is a brand.\n\nWhat was once taboo is now a t-shirt at almost any department store. There are Ghostface Funko Pops, ceramic mugs, backpacks, and even a hockey jersey for the little ones. Let’s keep it real: Scream and other franchises of its ilk have more in common today with McDonald’s or Burger King than the original horror flicks studios produce. That’s not an inherently bad thing, but it is a thing; viewing these properties through that prism makes the math add up. That’s why Jamie Lee Curtis found herself at the center of not one, but two Halloween “reboots” twenty years apart from one another. The movies about the psycho wearing the William Shatner mask established their formula in ’78, so no matter what, they always revert to something from that time period. Even the proposed Halloween TV series is a “creative reset” returning to… ’78.\n\nStaying trapped in the familiar is on the con side of the ledger when horror becomes more significant than just a simple movie. Easily discernible why? Sure. But can it also mean preaching to the same choir from one installment to the next? Also yeah.\n\nFede Alvarez embraced yesteryear with Alien: Romulus, but he believes he did so without alienating (pun very much intended) a new audience. “You never want an audience to go see a movie and furrow their brow thinking, ‘Who is this person?’ Why is half the cinema so excited about this man and I don’t know who he is?” said Alvarez in a recent interview. “It becomes an excess I’m not interested in.”\n\nHow one feels about the excesses of which he showed great interest in Romulus aside, his overall point rings true. Rooting franchises in their glory days means not making them relevant for today. Everyone involved becomes so focused on paying homage to the past or dealing with older characters that they don’t justify the present or chart a future. That’s precisely where Scream finds itself right now. There’s a lot to how the seventh entry arrived at this point. So much so that there isn’t enough ink to cover it all here. What matters now is the beloved series moving away from a story that attracted old fans and created new ones in favor of playing the hits. Given the circumstances, the creative team behind the next Scream didn’t simply break glass in case of emergency so much as they shattered it by throwing a 100 mph fastball in the form of the Sidney Prescott solution.\n\nFor several reasons, some that look incredibly cynical, Scream can’t escape the vicious cycle even though it charted new waters.\n\nWe had a new core cast. The Grim Reaper finally collected on Dewey Riley’s long-term debt. Sidney was out of the picture, and who knows how many more attempts on her life Gale Weathers could weather. Scream and Scream VI reflected on their legacy without bathing in it. The movies looked fresh through the eyes of new characters rather than being slavish to Generation X and Millennials. Scream 4’s original ending almost pulled off this same high-wire act in 2011 until it didn’t. Some people behind the scenes got cold feet in the 9th inning for whatever reason. Writer Kevin Williamson’s bold move went bye-bye in favor of the status quo. Almost 15 years later, the Scream franchise still suffers from chili digits. Sadly, it’s not the only one.\n\nFor a genre built on punk rock sensibilities, there’s far too much conformity and timidness at the top of the food chain. Cul-de-sacs keep us in comfortable places by design, but horror isn’t about comfort. It never was. The second these prominent properties remember that is the reason Target happily sells t-shirts to children with masked killers etched on the front, we might finally get off this road to nowhere."
