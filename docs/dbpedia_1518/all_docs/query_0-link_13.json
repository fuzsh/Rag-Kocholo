Robert A» Heinlein B1oot> Drive This year marks the 6 th year of the 'Pay It Forward' Blood Drive at Dragon*Con, sponsored by The Heinlein Society and LifeSouth Community Blood Center. 2007 marked the centennial year of Robert A. Heinlein, the man who started the tradition of science fiction convention blood drives at MidAmericon. Heinlein believed very strongly in blood donation and in giving to the community in general, in his words, \"Paying it forward.\" This is part of the marvelous legacy he left us, in addition to a lifetime of writing. The success of this drive is a reflection of the wonderful generosity of the Dragon*Con community and a fitting tribute to the man who gave so much of himself to his SF family. We hope you will take time during your convention experience to come by the Marriott Marquis to 'Pay It Forward', and share with us your memories of Robert Heinlein and his stories. Each donor receives a cloisonne pin originally designed by Heinlein for the MidAmericon blood drive, as well as a t-shirt and a chance to win other cool stuff. We'U see you there! At Dragon*Con we welcome everyone and we want it to be accessible to everyone. Our staff wants everyone who attends to have fun and enjoy the convention with as little hassle as possible.
