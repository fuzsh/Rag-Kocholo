        "text": "“Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead,” the latest from director and co-writer Lloyd Kaufman (“The Toxic Avenger”), is a heaping helping of political incorrectness gleefully spiced to offend just about every sentient being.\n\nIt comes with sides of musical numbers and a love scene between a man and a fresh, young, whole chicken. There’s an Indian burial ground, the ghosts of fowls tortured by the KFCs of the world and a goofy guy whose true love has, with her girlfriend, become a radical protester against corporate demons. Actual demons follow.\n\ntagcomedy | horror | musical\n\nBut all this is really just an excuse to uncap fountains of gore, unhook some brassieres and uncork a few off-color songs.\n\nLeads Jason Yachanin and Kate Graham actually display some musical-theater chops and play the style to the hilt. The script is a series of crimes against nature and decency, strung together by some funny one-liners: When the Col. Sanders-ish boss leads reporters into the kitchen and finds it covered with human blood, he says, “Hope you like our My Lai Massacre wallpaper.”\n\nThe moral, if one is discernible in this carnage, may be: You are what you eat, or what eats you.\n\n“Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead”\n\nNot rated but with pervasive violence, gore, nudity and sexual situations. 1 hour, 43 minutes. Directed by Lloyd Kaufman; written by Daniel Bova and Gabriel Friedman; starring Jason Yachanin, Kate Graham, Allyson Sereboff, Robin Watkins. Opens today at Starz FilmCenter."
