Christopher Blackshere | I am the devil's reject | 10/22/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"For those of you not familiar with Troma,\n\ndon't be fooled by my 5 star rating.\n\nThis movie is horrible.\n\nHorrible in the sleaziest, bloodiest, cheesiest way!\n\nMy wife left after 10 minutes (Wahoo!;)\n\nClassic Kaufman.\n\nHere's the plot if you need one--\n\nA fast food chicken joint is constructed on an Native American burial ground. I guess, although I'm not really positive, that these native's spirits possessed the dead chickens and arose from the grave, seeking double revenge. Chicken zombies from hell!!! Bwaaaaahahahaa.....\n\nPoultrygeist has the basic Troma stuff:\n\n-more gratuitous nudity than a porno (almost)\n\n-revolting projectile vomiting\n\n-extremely disgusting turd spraying\n\n-absurdily bloody decapitations\n\n-outrageous satirical episodes slamming pop culture\n\n-macaroni and cheesy acting\n\n-excessive damage to the crotchal region\n\n-ignoramus heroes that you gotta love\n\n-tactless social commentary\n\n-insane gore stuffed down your throat\n\nRecommended to rednecks, retards, idiots, and people from Boise, Idaho.\"\n\nBetter than Citizen Kane\n\nhukuyu | Burlington, NC USA | 08/03/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"I like Chicken. I like movies. I like movies about chicken. This is the most anticipated movie of the season for me. Classic Troma Films presentation. Buy it today, but hide it from your girlfriend.\"\n\nCluck you!\n\nJennifer Tonon | Poolesville, MD | 08/13/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"This is by far the best Troma film to date. Say what you will in argument, but only a select few can truly compare to this finger-licking masterpiece (of chicken). Not only is it a slapstick gore/comedy, but it also makes a tongue-in-cheek-yet-honest poke at the fast food industry. Vegans and PETA fans rejoice! Or at least appreciate. However, this is NOT for those who are easily offended (and really, why are you watching a Troma film if you are?!). A-pluses all around, and a big pat on the back to all of those who slept on basement floors, church floors, and ate cheese sandwiches.\"\n\nThe surprise of the year.\n\nRobert P. Beveridge | Cleveland, OH | 12/06/2008\n\n(3 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (Lloyd Kaufman, 2006)\n\nI'm not a big Troma fan. In fact, the last Troma film I remember actually liking was the original The Toxic Avenger. It's gotten to the point where even the Troma name on a movie will cause me to avoid it (even if they're just distributing--I've seen my share of Troma-distributed flicks, and to a one, they're hideous). But the concept behind Poultrygeist was just too plain old stupid for me to pass up, and I have to say, now that I've watched it, I can't remember the last time I was this surprised by a movie. I can't honestly say that I enjoyed it, but it's certainly the funniest movie I've seen this week.\n\nWe open with Arbie and Wendy (are you getting the joke yet?), a typical high school couple, making out in the local Indian burial ground, and Wendy promising that going off to college won't change her feelings for Arbie. Yeah, right. Fast-forward a semester, and Arbie has gone back to relive some memories, only to find that the burial ground has been bulldozed to make way for an American Chicken Bunker, a mega-fast-food-mart. It's on the verge of opening, but is under protest by a number of fringe groups, one of which happens to contain Wendy--who, much to Arbie's musical dismay, has become a lesbian and a vegan. To spite her, he decides to get a job at ACB, where he joins co-workers Denny, Paco Bell, Carl Jr. (okay, are you getting the joke now?), and Hummus. Problem is, interpersonal drama is not the only thing going on here, for those Indian spirits aren't too happy about being bulldozed, and have every intention of getting their revenge by possessing everything in sight. From there, the movie becomes a massive gorefest, but in such an over-the-top way that it seems even less like a gore film than, say, Dead Alive does. It's all just stupid fun. (And has a Ron Jeremy cameo!)\n\nThe pop culture references come thick and fast in this one, and there's very little that doesn't get skewered here. As well, if you have any aspirations to political correctness at all, you'll probably want to avoid this flick, which takes potshots at every race, creed, color, sexual preference, body type, etc. No matter who you are, there's something in this movie that's liable to offend you. If you like this sort of thing, however, it's great. I've seen more than one review that calls it Troma's best film ever; I'm inclined to agree. ***\n\n\"\n\nONE OF TROMA'S BEST!!\n\nLou Rusconi | El Cajon, California | 12/07/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"POULTRYGEIST is one of Troma's best films to date!! I love the gore and the pure un-PC-ness of everything! This fits nicely next to The Toxic Avenger, Citizen Toxie, Class OF Nuke'EM High and Mother's Day, these are all CLASSICKS in my opinion and POULTRYGEIST fits right in. The songs are AMAZING!! I highly recommend the soundtrack too, which I picked up right away as well!! Lloyd Kaufman really outdid himself on this masterPIECE!!\n\nPICK THIS SUCKA UP!!!\""
