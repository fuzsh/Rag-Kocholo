        "text": "To paraphrase one of this film's characters: There hasn't been such a lethal combination of Indian and chicken since the introduction of tandoori. Seems building a fast-food chicken joint on top of a Native American burial ground is a bad idea: You get a particularly bizarre sort of man-bird zombie, with a penchant for transforming customers into exploding egg-carriers. In other words, the perfect subject matter for a Troma musical comedy. Like an extra-value meal, Poultrygeist offers plenty of what Troma fans want: dreadful puns, gallons of spurting bodily fluids, topless women, cheap but disgusting special effects, equal-opportunity offensive humor and director Lloyd Kaufman in a thong. Oh, and if you really want to glean something meaningful, there's arguably a critique here about the social, environmental and nutritional damage wrought by fast-food chains -- even those that aren't harboring zombie chickens. Starts Fri., Aug. 8. Oaks (AH)"
