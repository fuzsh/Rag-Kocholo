Kaufman also happens to be the chairman of the International Film & Television Alliance, and in this rant the chairman takes aim at all that irks him in the world of media (plus he's not afraid to use star wipe).\n\nAnd have a look at the uncensored trailer for Lloyd's latest–Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead!"
