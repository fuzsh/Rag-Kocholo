Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead

directed by Lloyd Kaufman

EGGS-CLUSIVE 3-DISC EDITION

When a fast food chicken restaurant is built on the site of an ancient Native American burial ground, the displaced spirits unite with the ghosts of exterminated chickens and transform into Indian chicken zombies seeking revenge! Now, it’s up to a dim-witted counter boy, his lesbian ex-girlfriend, and a burqa-wearing fry cook to put an end to the foul-feathered menace once and for all.

A hilarious mix of social satire, extreme gore, and hauntingly catchy musical numbers. Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead is the most gut-busting and outrageous movie in Troma’s 35 year history! Possibly the best reviewed independent film since Blood Simple.

Serving up a bucket of deep-fried egg-stras

“Poultry in Motion” Feature Length Behind-the-Scenes Cluck-u-mentary

Att-hen-sion getting commentary by Lloyd Kaufman and Gabe Friedman

Alternate “Happy-Ending” with Ron Jeremy
