In the 2020 US Senate elections, Democrats won a net of 3 seats and regained control of the US Senate for the first time since they lost it in the previous Class II Senate elections in 2014. Although Democrats lost there Senate majority in 2022 and had significant losses in 2024, they managed a net gain of 1 seat (it should be noted however that these losses weren’t necessarily to the GOP proper but rather to Libertarians who caucuses with the GOP).

Democrats needed a net gain of 11 seats to retake a majority in the US Senate, although many pundits said this was unlikely to happen.

This election was also noted for third parties beginning to win seats, with the Green Party winning an open Senate seat in Massachusetts and the Libertarian party (with GOP backing) defeating Democrat incumbents in New Mexico and Michigan.

Focus on Competitive Elections[]

Democrats targeted Republican-held seats in Texas (open seat) as well as Alaska, Kansas, Maine, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Republicans targeted Michigan and New Mexico with Libertarian candidates as well as Illinois, Minnesota, and New Hampshire.
