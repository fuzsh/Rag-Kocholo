The Republicans regained the majority of the Senate in the 114th Congress, which started in January 2015; the Republicans had not controlled the Senate since January 2007. They needed a net gain of at least 6 seats to obtain a majority and were projected by polls to do so. On election night, they held all of their seats and gained 9 Democratic-held seats. Republicans defeated 5 Democratic incumbents: Mark Begich of Alaska lost to Dan Sullivan, Mark Pryor of Arkansas lost to Tom Cotton, Mark Udall of Colorado lost to Cory Gardner, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana lost to Bill Cassidy, and Kay Hagan of North Carolina lost to Thom Tillis. Republicans also picked up another 4 open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia that were previously held by Democrats. Democrats did not pick up any Republican-held seats, but they did hold an open seat in Michigan.

This was the second consecutive election cycle held in a president's sixth year where control of the Senate changed hands, the first being in 2006. This was also the first time that the Democrats lost control of the Senate in a sixth-year midterm election cycle since 1918. With a total net gain of 9 seats, the Republicans made the largest Senate gain by any party since 1980. This is also the first election cycle since 1980 in which more than 2 incumbent Democratic senators were defeated by their Republican challengers.[2] Days after the election cycle, the United States Election Project estimated that 36.4% of eligible voters voted, 4% lower than the 2010 elections, and possibly the lowest turnout rate since the 1942 election cycle.[3][4]
