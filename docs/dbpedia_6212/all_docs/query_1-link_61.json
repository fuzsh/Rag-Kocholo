        "text": "It's been more than a month since the Nov. 4 election, but we're only just now finding out about some of the biggest campaign donations, including a previously undisclosed spending blitz by Democrats to try and elect Kansas independent Greg Orman.\n\nAny political contributions to national party committees and super-PACs made on or after Oct. 16 didn't have to be disclosed until Thursday. The long delay between the late contributions and public disclosure creates an opportunity for mischief and a chance to move big money because super-PACs can raise funds in unlimited amounts to pay for ads independently supporting or attacking candidates."
