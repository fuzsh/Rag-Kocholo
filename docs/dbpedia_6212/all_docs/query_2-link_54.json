        "text": "Tim Walz rocketed into national prominence as the plain-talking governor of Minnesota, but his decade-plus in Congress could preview how he’ll operate if he’s headed back to Washington. But first, you should know:\n\nHarris leads Donald Trump 51%-48% among registered voters in a NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.\n\nWalz’s long history with China could help a potential Harris administration—but it could also spell trouble with Beijing and Republicans back home.\n\nThe House’s progressive ‘squad’ shrinks after Rep. Cory Bush (Mo.) lost a bitter primary battle driven by Democratic divisions over Israel.\n\nWalz’s Hill Career Hints at Heartland Appeal\n\nTim Walz’s dozen years on Capitol Hill hint at how he might work with Congress if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the White House.\n\nHis focus on farming and veterans issues are subjects Democrats hope will appeal to swing voters across battlegrounds like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He struck a moderate profile during his time in the House and fellow Democrats emphasized that approach as they look to the presidential race, and stress his Midwestern dad persona.\n\n“In the House, he was much more reasonable than he is as governor,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. His House voting record largely lined up with fellow Democrats, including support for the Affordable Care Act. But he crossed party lines on some high-profile issues:\n\nObama AG Contempt: He was among 17 House Democrats who voted in 2012 to cite then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents related to a federal gun investigation.\n\nGuns: He also opposed tighter gun laws, presenting himself as a hunter representing rural voters, and was backed by the National Rifle Association. He was one of six Democrats in 2017 who supported a bill to block the Social Security Administration from barring individuals with mental disabilities who receive benefits from buying firearms.\n\nWalz’s primary work in the House was on the Veterans’ Affairs and Agriculture committees, where he helped pass the Veteran Skills to Jobs Act directing federal departments and agencies to count military training toward satisfying training or certification requirements for federal licenses.\n\nHe also had a hand in crafting the Farm Bill, and sat on conference committees for the 2014 and 2018 versions to hammer out final compromises. Read More\n\nClimate Record: Walz boasts one of the most aggressive records enacting climate policy at the state level. He accelerated his state’s embrace of clean energy and electric vehicles in ways that could become templates for federal action in the next White House.\n\nHe used a razor-thin majority in the Minnesota legislature to enact a law requiring the state to produce all of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. It was one of dozens of climate initiatives Walz helped steer through the statehouse, including a $2 billion initiative to expand clean energy investment in the state. Read More\n\nPhotographer: Hannah Beier/Bloomberg\n\nWith Walz officially on the Democratic ticket, Harris will kick off a critical campaign stretch aimed at putting Donald Trump on the defensive in key swing states. The two are slated to follow with visits to Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada — destinations critical to determining November’s election outcome.\n\nThe whirlwind blitz comes with Trump largely off the trail this week — with his next rally Friday in Montana, a state with a competitive Senate race but solidly in the Republican presidential column, giving Democrats the chance to amplify their message in battleground states. Read More\n\nBIDEN’S SCHEDULE\n\nPresident Joe Biden has no public events.\n\n2 p.m. — Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will hold a briefing.\n\nHARRIS’ SCHEDULE\n\n2:20 p.m. — Harris will deliver remarks at a campaign event in Eau Claire, Wis.\n\n6:40 p.m. — Harris will deliver remarks at a campaign event in Detroit.\n\nMore on Election 2024\n\nHarris VP Pick Walz’s Long History With China May Prove Awkward\n\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz has connections to China dating back decades that could help inform Kamala Harris’s approach to the world’s second-biggest economy, but may also spell trouble with leaders in Beijing and Republicans back home.\n\nTrump’s Overtures to US Crypto Sector Put Global Hubs on Alert\n\nDonald Trump is courting the sector in search of donations and votes, pledging to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”. Prospective Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has yet to take a stance on crypto but there are signs that her advisers are seeking a reset of ties with the industry, according to a report in the Financial Times.\n\nFive Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent\n\nThe founder of hedge fund Key Square Group speaks to Bloomberg about why he decided to step into the fray.\n\nCori Bush Loses Primary; Slotkin-Rogers Race Set in Michigan\n\nMissouri Democrat Cori Bush lost her primary to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell in the 1st District. The super PAC arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee spent more than $8.5 million in the race opposing Bush, the second member of the progressive “Squad” to lose a primary this cycle. Read More\n\nRepublicans chose Bob Onder, a former state senator and physician, in the primary to replace eight-term Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R). Onder is now a shoo-in for the race this fall in the heavily Republican 3rd District.\n\nDemocrat Lucas Kunce won the primary to take on first-term Sen. Josh Hawley (R).\n\nLt. Gov Mike Kehoe (R) received 39.4% of the votes in the race for governor and will take on state Rep. Crystal Quade (D) in the fall. Read More\n\nMichigan voters set up a Senate contest between Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D) and former Rep. Mike Rogers (R), who both easily won their primaries. Democrats likely need to hold the seat, which the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates a “toss up,” to have any chance of maintaining their majority.\n\nKristen McDonald Rivet (D) and Paul Junge (R) will face off in the 8th District, which includes Flint and Midland and is currently represented by the retiring Dan Kildee (D).\n\nPaul Hudson won the 3rd District GOP primary to take on Rep. Hillary Scholten (D) in the Grand Rapids area.\n\nDemocrat Carl Malinga is set to challenge Rep. John James (R) in the 10th District north of Detroit.\n\nRep. Shri Thanedar (D) won his primary in the 13th District.\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) will face Joe Kent in a 2022 rematch the southwestern 3rd District, which backed Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The state uses a “top two” system, in which the top two vote-getters advance.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse (R), who voted to impeach Trump in 2021, is running second in the central 4th District with about 25% of the vote behind fellow Republican and ex-NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler with 29.8%, according to the AP, which hasn’t called the race. Ex-nurse Tiffany Smiley (R) is in third with 19.5%.\n\nIn the Democratic-friendly 6th District, state Sen. Emily Randall (D) leads with 33.3% and state Sen. Drew McEwan (R) has 30.5%, while state lands commissioner Hilary Franz (D) is in third with 25.7%, according to the AP, which hasn’t called the race. Retiring Rep. Derek Kilmer (D) had backed Franz, while Sen. Patty Murray (D) backed Randall.\n\nFormer Rep. Dave Reichert (R) and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D) are set to face off in the governor’s race.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell (D) will be favored to win a fifth term after leading with nearly 58% of the vote.\n\nFormer Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt (R) won a five-way contest in the primary to succeed retiring Rep. Jake LaTurner (R) in the 2nd District, which includes Topeka. He’ll take on former one-term Rep. Nancy Boyda (D), who won in a Democratic wave in 2006.\n\nBoeing Grilled on Midair Blowout at Marathon Safety Hearing\n\nJennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, grilled Boeing executives on why the planemaker didn’t address quality lapses in its factories well before a midair blowout on one of its jets early this year.\n\nThe NTSB released thousands of pages of information at the start of the hearing about the accident. Interviews with Boeing workers show an at-times overstressed workforce that was well aware of 737 Max fuselages arriving from key supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, with defects.\n\nThe comapny announced during the hearing that its engineers are working on design changes that would prevent the door plug from being closed until it’s firmly secured, after the NTSB found the element hadn’t been properly reinserted and was missing bolts to hold it down.\n\nThe episode has plunged Boeing into crisis, prompting a management shakeup and comprehensive review of the company’s safety culture. Elizabeth Lund, a Boeing senior vice president of quality testifying at the hearing, said the planemaker is only now starting to step up its rate of aircraft production again, which she said had fallen precipitously after the accident.\n\nThe issues “have been known for years,” Homendy told reporters during the first of two days of hearings. “Why does it take a serious tragedy, which could have been so much more serious, for change to occur?” Read More\n\nAlso in the News\n\nDemocrats Seek to Ban Ammunition Sales That Benefit the Pentagon\n\nDeclaring that “there should never be a government label on ammunition used in a mass shooting,” congressional Democrats plan to introduce legislation today that would forbid the Pentagon from allowing bullets made at an Army-owned munitions plant to be sold to civilians.\n\nAirline Meltdowns Spur Customers’ Fury, So What Can Congress Do?\n\nWhen airline disruption causes travel chaos, lawmakers can turn to recent FAA legislation to ensure passengers get refunds.\n\nGoogle Monopoly Ruling to Carry Influence in Emerging AI Field\n\nA decisive court ruling branding Alphabet Inc.’s Google an illegal monopolist in the search market is set to carry consequences for the development of the artificial intelligence space and the tech giant’s position in it.\n\nBGOV OnPoint: AI Boom Spurs Intellectual Property, Worker Fears\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence poses a threat to artists, musicians, screenwriters, and journalists, according to creators’ claims about AI platforms replicating their copyrighted work and potentially displacing human activity.\n\nChamber of Commerce’s Texas Wins Offer Playbook for Rule Fights\n\nPicking the right court has never been more key to challenging agency rules, thanks to a pair of Supreme Court rulings. For a preview of how a forum shopping strategy will play out post-Loper Bright and Corner Post, the US Chamber of Commerce’s shift to Texas from the D.C. Circuit is instructive.\n\nUS Poised to Confront China Over EV Technology With New Limits\n\nThe US is preparing to widen its confrontation with China over technology by challenging the world’s second-largest economy in the rapidly emerging field of autonomous and internet-connected vehicles.\n\nPharma Industry Ramps Up Legal Fight of State Drug Discount Laws\n\nPharmaceutical industry giants are ramping up a fight against state laws that require them to distribute discounted drugs to an unlimited number of pharmacies, piling up lawsuits that are now pending across the US.\n\nTrump Hush-Money Judge Says He’ll Decide on Recusal by Next Week\n\nThe judge who presided over Donald Trump’s hush-money case said he will decide next week whether he will remove himself from the high-profile case in which the former president has been convicted of 34 felony counts.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Giuseppe Macri in Washington at gmacri@bgov.com; Jeannie Baumann in Washington at jbaumann@bloombergindustry.com"
