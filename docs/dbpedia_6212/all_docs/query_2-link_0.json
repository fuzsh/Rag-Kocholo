At the behest of Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell as well as former Senator Bob Dole, Roberts fired his longtime campaign manager Leroy Towns in early September 2014. Chris LaCivita was brought in to revamp the race, and LaCivita protege Corry Bliss replaced Towns as campaign manager. Bliss urged Roberts focus on a strategy of tying Orman to President Obama at every turn, as Obama had low favorability ratings in Kansas. Roberts also began spending more time in Kansas, living out of a hotel in Topeka rather than from his home in Alexandria, Virginia.[41][42]\n\nOn September 3, Democratic nominee Chad Taylor withdrew from the race.[43] On September 4, Kris Kobach, the Republican Kansas Secretary of State, announced that Taylor would remain on the ballot because state law demands he declare himself \"incapable of fulfilling the duties of office if elected\" in order to be removed, which he did not do.[44] Taylor challenged the decision, and on September 18 the Kansas Supreme Court decided that his name would be taken off the ballot.[45]\n\nOn the same day, Kobach demanded the chairman of the Democratic Party name a replacement in eight days, saying he will consider litigation to force the party if they refuse.[46]\n\nA registered Democrat with family ties to Republican Governor Sam Brownback's campaign also filed a petition with the Kansas Supreme Court on September 18 to force the Democratic Party to name a new candidate.[47] Kobach ordered ballots to be mailed to overseas voters on September 20 without a Democratic candidate, but included a disclaimer that another ballot will be sent if the Democratic Party names a replacement candidate.[48]\n\nThe state district court in Shawnee County threw out the petition, meaning no replacement for Taylor needed to be named.[49]\n\nThe efforts by Bliss and other Republican strategists would ultimately prove successful. Roberts' polling improved in October. Roberts defeated Orman in the general election, winning reelection to a fourth term in office.[41]\n\nIf Orman had been elected, the U.S. Senate would have had three independent Senators for the first time in the chamber's history. This—and the question of whom Orman would choose to caucus with if elected—were very large questions in the electoral contest, and because the Kansas race was showing tight in the polls, a subject of considerable national political discourse as well.[50]\n\nFundraising\n\n[edit]\n\nCandidate Raised Spent Cash on Hand Debt Greg Orman (I) $2,461,766 $3,298,186 $183,599 $1,124,982 Pat Roberts (R) $5,383,491 $5,534,415 $927,449 0\n\nDebates\n\n[edit]\n\nComplete video of debate, October 8, 2014\n\nComplete video of debate, October 15, 2014\n\nEndorsements\n\n[edit]\n\nPredictions\n\n[edit]\n\nSource Ranking As of The Cook Political Report[64] Tossup November 3, 2014 Sabato's Crystal Ball[65] Lean R November 3, 2014 Rothenberg Political Report[66] Tossup November 3, 2014 Real Clear Politics[67] Tossup November 3, 2014\n\nPolling\n\n[edit]\n\nPoll source Date(s)\n\nadministered Sample\n\nsize Margin of\n\nerror Pat\n\nRoberts (R) Chad\n\nTaylor (D) Greg\n\nOrman (I) Randall\n\nBatson (L) Other Undecided Public Policy Polling February 18–20, 2014 693 ± 3.7% 48% 32% — — — 20% Rasmussen Reports April 16–17, 2014 750 ± 4% 50% 32% — — 5% 13% SurveyUSA June 19–23, 2014 1068 ± 3.1% 43% 33% 7% 5% — 12% SurveyUSA July 17–22, 2014 1,208 ± 2.9% 38% 33% 14% 4% — 10% CBS News/NYT/YouGov July 5–24, 2014 1,281 ± 6.1% 53% 37% — — 7% 4% Rasmussen Reports August 6–7, 2014 750 ± 4% 44% 40% — — 7% 8% Public Policy Polling August 14–17, 2014 903 ± 3.3% 32% 25% 23% 3% — 17% 43% 39% — — — 17% 33% — 43% — — 24% KSN News/SurveyUSA August 20–23, 2014 560 ± 4.2% 37% 32% 20% 4% — 6% CBS News/NYT/YouGov August 18 – September 2, 2014 839 ± 5% 47% 35% — — 2% 15% KSN News/SurveyUSA September 4–7, 2014 555 ± 4.2% 36% 10% 37% 6% — 11% Public Policy Polling September 11–14, 2014 1,328 ± 2.7% 34% 6%[a] 41% 4% — 15% 36% — 46% — — 17% Fox News September 14–16, 2014 604 ± 4% 40% 11%[b] 38% 4% — 8% 42% — 48% — — 8% Rasmussen Reports September 16–17, 2014 750 ± 4% 40% 3%[c] 45% — 2% 10% 39% 9%[d] 38% — 2% 12% Remington Research September 23, 2014 625 ± 3.91% 42% — 50% 3% — 5% Suffolk University Archived October 2, 2014, at the Wayback Machine September 27–30, 2014 500 ± 4.4% 41.2% — 46.4% 0.8% — 11.6% CBS News/NYT/YouGov September 20 – October 1, 2014 2,013 ± 3% 40% — 40% 2% 0% 17% NBC News/Marist September 27 – October 1, 2014 511 LV ± 4.3% 38% — 48% 5% 1% 9% 848 RV ± 3.4% 36% — 46% 5% 1% 12% Gravis Marketing September 30 – October 1, 2014 850 ± 3% 40% — 47% — — 13% SurveyUSA October 2–5, 2014 549 ± 4.3% 42% — 47% 4% — 7% CNN/ORC October 2–6, 2014 687 ± 3.5% 49% — 48% — — 3% Fox News October 4–7, 2014 702 ± 3.5% 44% — 39% 3% 4% 12% Rasmussen Reports October 7–8, 2014 750 ± 4% 40% — 52% — 4% 4% Public Policy Polling October 9–12, 2014 1,081 ± 3% 41% — 44% 5% — 10% 43% — 46% — — 11% Remington Research October 9–12, 2014 1,091 ± 2.97% 48% — 46% 2% — 4% Monmouth University October 16–19, 2014 429 ± 4.7% 46% — 46% — 3% 5% Rasmussen Reports October 20–21, 2014 960 ± 3% 44% — 49% — 3% 5% Gravis Marketing October 20–21, 2014 1,124 ± 3% 45% — 47% — — 8% NBC News/Marist October 18–22, 2014 757 LV ± 3.6% 44% — 45% 4% <1% 7% 1,055 RV ± 3% 42% — 45% 4% 1% 9% CBS News/NYT/YouGov October 16–23, 2014 1,973 ± 4% 42% — 38% 1% 0% 18% Survey USA October 22–26, 2014 623 ± 4% 42% — 44% 4% — 10% Fox News October 28–30, 2014 907 ± 3% 43% — 44% 3% 1% 8% YouGov October 25–31, 2014 1,137 ± 4.8% 38% — 37% 2% 2% 22% Public Policy Polling October 30–31, 2014 752 ± ? 47% — 46% 3% — 4% Public Policy Polling November 1–3, 2014 963 ± 3.2% 46% — 47% 3% — 4% 47% — 49% — — 3%\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Senate election in Kansas, 2014[69] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 866,191 100.00% N/A Republican hold\n\nCounties that flipped from Democratic to Independent\n\n[edit]\n\nDouglas (Largest city: Lawrence)\n\nWyandotte (Largest city: Kansas City)\n\nCounties that flipped from Republican to Independent\n\n[edit]\n\nShawnee (Largest city: Topeka)\n\nCounties that flipped from Democratic to Republican\n\n[edit]\n\nAtchison (Largest city: Atchison)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\n2014 United States Senate elections\n\n2014 United States elections\n\n2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Kansas\n\n2014 Kansas gubernatorial election\n\n2014 Kansas elections\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nU.S. Senate elections in Kansas, 2014 at Ballotpedia\n\nCampaign contributions at OpenSecrets\n\nOfficial campaign websites"
