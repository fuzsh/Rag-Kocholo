Listed below is how to become a voter and keep your registration current so voting in future elections stays simple. To vote, you must register with the Election Office, be a United States citizen, and be at least 18 years old by the next general election.\n\nStep 1: Register to Vote\n\nRegistration Application\n\nYou can register to vote for the first time or change your current registration information online. To register to vote online, you must have a valid Kansas driver’s license or non-driver’s identification card. If you do not have either of these documents, you may register to vote using theVoter-Registration-Card or the National Voter Registration Application Form and submit it to the Election Office. If you do not have a valid Kansas driver’s license you may register to vote online using this website: www.ksvotes.org Applications are also available at the Cowley County Election Office – 321 E. 10th, Winfield and at various city offices. Registration is open except for the 21 days before Election Day in the district where an election is held. You must re-register each time you change your name, address, or party affiliation for voting. When you register, you can affiliate with a party or be unaffiliated. During partisan primary elections, unaffiliated voters may affiliate when voting.\n\nStep 2: Vote in the next election\n\nIn Cowley County you have three convenient Voting Options to choose from.\n\nVote Early by Mail\n\nTo vote by mail, complete an Advance Voting Application and mail, email, or fax it to the Election Office. We begin mailing ballots 20 days before Election Day. A signed application is required before an advance ballot can be issued. The last day our office can mail a ballot is 7 days before the election. The voted ballot must be returned to the Election Office or on Election Day at any polling location by 7 p.m. If mailing, your ballot must be postmarked by Election Day and received in the Election Office no later than 3 days after the election.\n\nVote Early in Person\n\nGo to the Cowley County Election Office 321 E. 10th Winfield, Kansas They will check you in by computer.

State law requires that all voters show photo identification. Got photo id\n\nStep 3: Keep your registration information current\n\nKeep voting simple for you by keeping your registration information current. Re-register if you move, change your name, or want to change your party affiliation.\n\nLaw Regarding Party Affiliation Change\n\nBy law, from noon on June 1 through August 31 (in even years only), anyone affiliated with the Democratic, Republican, or Libertarian party may not switch to another party or elect to become unaffiliated.\n\nIf you still wish to change your party affiliation after the August Primary Election, you will need to resubmit another voter registration application on or after September 1.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature passed a law in 2014 which prohibits voters from switching parties or disaffiliating from a party during the time from the candidate filing deadline through the time when the primary election results are certified by the State Board of Canvassers.
