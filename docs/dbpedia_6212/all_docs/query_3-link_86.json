        "text": "The Affordable Care Actâ€™s (ACA) Medicaid expansion expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level ($20,783 for an individual in 2024) and provided states with an enhanced federal matching rate (FMAP) for their expansion populations.\n\nTo date, 41 states (including DC) have adopted the Medicaid expansion and 10 states have not adopted the expansion. Current status for each state is based on KFF tracking and analysis of state expansion activity.\n\nThese data are available in a table format. The map may be downloaded as a Powerpoint.\n\nMedicaid Expansion Resources"
