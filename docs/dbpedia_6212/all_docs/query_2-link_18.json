Although Democrats lost there Senate majority in 2022 and had significant losses in 2024, they managed a net gain of 1 seat (it should be noted however that these losses weren’t necessarily to the GOP proper but rather to Libertarians who caucuses with the GOP).\n\nDemocrats needed a net gain of 11 seats to retake a majority in the US Senate, although many pundits said this was unlikely to happen.\n\nThis election was also noted for third parties beginning to win seats, with the Green Party winning an open Senate seat in Massachusetts and the Libertarian party (with GOP backing) defeating Democrat incumbents in New Mexico and Michigan.\n\nFocus on Competitive Elections[]\n\nDemocrats targeted Republican-held seats in Texas (open seat) as well as Alaska, Kansas, Maine, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Republicans targeted Michigan and New Mexico with Libertarian candidates as well as Illinois, Minnesota, and New Hampshire.\n\nClosest Races[]\n\nState Party of Winner Margin South Carolina South Carolina 0.0%\n\nChange in Composition[]\n\nBefore these elections D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9 D10 D20 D19 D18 D17 D16 D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D21 D22 D23 D24 D25 D26\n\nColo.\n\nRan\n\nD27\n\nDel.\n\nRetired\n\nD28\n\nGa.\n\nRan\n\nD29\n\nIll.\n\nRetired\n\nD30\n\nMass.\n\nRetired\n\nI2 I1 D38\n\nVa.\n\nRan\n\nD37\n\nR.I.\n\nRetired\n\nD36\n\nOre.\n\nRan\n\nD35\n\nN.M.\n\nRan\n\nD34\n\nN.J.\n\nRan\n\nD33\n\nN.H.\n\nRan\n\nD32\n\nMinn.\n\nRan\n\nD31\n\nMich.\n\nRan\n\nR60\n\nWyo.\n\nRan\n\nR59\n\nW.Va.\n\nRan\n\nR58\n\nTexas\n\nRetired\n\nR57\n\nTenn.\n\nRan\n\nR56\n\nS.D.\n\nRan\n\nR55\n\nS.C.\n\nRan\n\nR54\n\nOkla.\n\nRan\n\nR53\n\nN.C.\n\nRan\n\nR52\n\nNeb.\n\nRan\n\nR51\n\nMont.\n\nRan\n\nMajority ⬇️ R50\n\nMiss.\n\nRan\n\nR41\n\nAla.\n\nRan\n\nR42\n\nAlaska\n\nRan\n\nR43\n\nArk.\n\nRan\n\nR44\n\nIdaho\n\nRetired\n\nR45\n\nIowa\n\nRan\n\nR46\n\nKan.\n\nRan\n\nR47\n\nKy.\n\nRetired\n\nR48\n\nLa.\n\nRan\n\nR49\n\nMaine\n\nRan\n\nR40 R39 R38 R37 R36 R35 R34 R33 R32 R31 R21 R22 R23 R24 R25 R26 R27 R28 R29 R30 R20 R19 R18 R17 R16 R15 R14 R13 R12 R11 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10\n\nAlabama[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Alabama Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nAlaska[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Alaska Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nArkansas[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Arkansas Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nColorado[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Colorado Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nDelaware[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Delaware Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nGeorgia[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Georgia Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nIdaho[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Idaho Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nIllinois[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Illinois Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nIowa[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Iowa Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nKansas[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Kansas Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nKentucky[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Kentucky Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nLouisiana[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Louisiana Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nMaine[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Maine Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Popular Vote Percentage\n\nMassachusetts[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Massachusetts Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Green Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nMichigan[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Michigan Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Libertarian Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nMinnesota[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Minnesota Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nMississippi[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Mississippi Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nMontana[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Montana Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nNebraska[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Nebraska Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nNew Hampshire[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in New Hampshire Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nNew Jersey[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in South Carolina Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nNew Mexico[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in New Mexico Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Libertarian Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nNorth Carolina[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in North Carolina Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nOklahoma[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Oklahoma Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Republican Democratic Popular Vote Percentage\n\nOregon[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Oregon Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nRhode Island[]\n\n2026 US Senate election in Rhode Island Label Winner Runner-Up Nominee Party Democratic Republican Popular Vote Percentage\n\nSouth Carolina[]\n\nMany where shocked at what happened in South Carolina.
