        "text": "Go to https://www.govtrack.us/, use the Find My Representative box on the left side of the screen and you'll get the Representative and two Senators who represent you. We default to the Washington, D.C. office phone number, but if you get a full voicemail box message (not uncommon), try a district office to get to a live person. You can also schedule meetings with staff in district offices to discuss issues you care about. In general, however you're interacting with your representatives or their staff, it's good to be succinct and have a specific action you want them to take. For example, if you want them to vote a certain way on a bill, tell them what the bill is, how you'd like to see them vote and why.\n\nWe had several people ask about contacting members who aren't their representatives and we don't recommend this. Congress members are responsive to the people who can potentially vote for them, so going to a representative in another district or state won't do much good. Even if your representative isn't directly involved in an issue that you care about, it's still worth trying to connect with them or their staff to find out how they may be able to help you. Perhaps they're on a committee with the other relevant member or are just good friends and can find out more. Congress is all about relationships and sometimes you can advocate through informal means as well as formal.\n\nIf the issue is a big one (say, raising the minimum wage) or one that is really personally important to you, expect to put in some time over more than one Congress to see change. Most bills don't pass the first time they're introduced and it can take quite a while for the right mix of circumstances, members and political advantage to line up to get a bill passed.\n\nThere are many, many much more detailed guides to interacting with Congress that you can find online. A search just now for \"advice for contacting your member of congress\" yielded lots of guides. Nearly all of them are produced by advocacy groups. You can either select at random or pick a group you agree with (examples in the search above include the Unitarian Universalist Church, ACLU, United Steelworkers and the American Planning Association) and see if you find it helpful. If not, there's plenty more to choose from.\n\nMembers of Congress in both chambers can help with more than just legislation. They can also help you if you need a flag or, say, help getting a passport in a shorter timeframe than usual. For example, here's Sen. Rubio's Services page. Constituent service is a key duty for all members, so don't be shy about asking for help if you need it. They have staff whose job it is to help constituents!"
