This imprisonment must be served consecutively to any other minimum mandatory penalty imposed for a violation of this section or an ordinance which prohibits the acts that this section prohibits. Any enhanced penalty imposed shall not exceed the maximum sentence allowable by law. During the service of the enhanced penalty, the judge may order the person on house arrest, work release or other conditional release.\n\n(d) If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (a)(4) or (a)(5), the fact that the person is or has been entitled to use the drug under the laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against the charge.\n\n(e) The court may establish the terms and time for payment of any fines, fees, assessments and costs imposed pursuant to this section.

and\n\n(B) conviction of a violation of an ordinance of a city in this state, a resolution of a county in this state or any law of another jurisdiction that would constitute an offense that is comparable to the offense described in subsection (i)(1) or (i)(2);\n\n(4) multiple convictions of any crime described in subsection (i)(1) or (i)(2) arising from the same arrest shall only be counted as one conviction;\n\n(5) it is irrelevant whether an offense occurred before or after conviction for a previous offense; and\n\n(6) a person may enter into a diversion agreement in lieu of further criminal proceedings for a violation of this section, and amendments thereto, or an ordinance which prohibits the acts of this section, and amendments thereto, only once during the personâs lifetime.\n\n(j) For the purposes of determining whether an offense is comparable, the following shall be considered:\n\n(1) The name of the out-of-jurisdiction offense;\n\n(2) the elements of the out-of-jurisdiction offense; and\n\n(3) whether the out-of-jurisdiction offense prohibits similar conduct to the conduct prohibited by the closest approximate Kansas offense.\n\n(k) Upon conviction of a person of a violation of this section or a violation of a city ordinance or county resolution prohibiting the acts prohibited by this section, the division, upon receiving a report of conviction, shall suspend, restrict or suspend and restrict the personâs driving privileges as provided by K.S.A. 8-1014, and amendments thereto.\n\n(l) (1) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any city from enacting ordinances, or any county from adopting resolutions, declaring acts prohibited or made unlawful by this act as unlawful or prohibited in such city or county and prescribing penalties for violation thereof.\n\n(2) The minimum penalty prescribed by any such ordinance or resolution shall not be less than the minimum penalty prescribed by this section for the same violation, and the maximum penalty in any such ordinance or resolution shall not exceed the maximum penalty prescribed for the same violation.\n\n(3) On and after July 1, 2007, and retroactive for ordinance violations committed on or after July 1, 2006, an ordinance may grant to a municipal court jurisdiction over a violation of such ordinance which is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the district court over a violation of this section, notwithstanding that the elements of such ordinance violation are the same as the elements of a violation of this section that would constitute, and be punished as, a felony.\n\n(4) Any such ordinance or resolution shall authorize the court to order that the convicted person pay restitution to any victim who suffered loss due to the violation for which the person was convicted.\n\n(m) (1) Upon the filing of a complaint, citation or notice to appear alleging a person has violated a city ordinance prohibiting the acts prohibited by this section, and prior to conviction thereof, a city attorney shall request and shall receive from the:\n\n(A) Division a record of all prior convictions obtained against such person for any violations of any of the motor vehicle laws of this state; and\n\n(B) Kansas bureau of investigation central repository all criminal history record information concerning such person.\n\n(2) If the elements of such ordinance violation are the same as the elements of a violation of this section that would constitute, and be punished as, a felony, the city attorney shall refer the violation to the appropriate county or district attorney for prosecution.\n\n(n) No plea bargaining agreement shall be entered into nor shall any judge approve a plea bargaining agreement entered into for the purpose of permitting a person charged with a violation of this section, or a violation of any ordinance of a city or resolution of any county in this state which prohibits the acts prohibited by this section, to avoid the mandatory penalties established by this section or by the ordinance. For the purpose of this subsection, entering into a diversion agreement pursuant to K.S.A. 12-4413 et seq. or 22-2906 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall not constitute plea bargaining. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit an amendment or dismissal of any charge where the admissible evidence is not sufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt on such charge.\n\n(o) The alternatives set out in subsection (a) may be pleaded in the alternative, and the state, city or county may, but shall not be required to, elect one or more of such alternatives prior to submission of the case to the fact finder.\n\n(p) As used in this section:\n\n(1) âAlcohol concentrationâ means the number of grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or per 210 liters of breath;\n\n(2) âimprisonmentâ includes any restrained environment in which the court and law enforcement agency intend to retain custody and control of a defendant person and such environment has been approved by the board of county commissioners or the governing body of a city; and\n\n(3) âdrugâ includes toxic vapors as such term is defined in K.S.A. 21-5712, and amendments thereto.\n\n(q) (1) The amount of the increase in fines as specified in this section shall be remitted by the clerk of the district court to the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of remittance of the increase provided in this act, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state treasury and the state treasurer shall credit 50% to the community alcoholism and intoxication programs fund and 50% to the department of corrections alcohol and drug abuse treatment fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury.\n\n(2) On and after July 1, 2011, the amount of $250 from each fine imposed pursuant to this section shall be remitted by the clerk of the district court to the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall credit the entire amount to the community corrections supervision fund established by K.S.A. 75-52,113, and amendments thereto.\n\nSec. 2.

If an offense is classified in grid blocks 4-E, 4-F, 4-G, 4-H, 4-I, 5-C or 5-D, the court may impose an optional nonprison sentence as provided in K.S.A. 21-6804(q), and amendments thereto.\n\n(e) The sentence for a second or subsequent conviction for unlawful manufacturing of a controlled substance, K.S.A. 65-4159, prior to its repeal, K.S.A. 2010 Supp. 21-36a03, prior to its transfer, K.S.A. 21-5703, and amendments thereto, or a substantially similar offense from another jurisdiction, if the controlled substance in any prior conviction was methamphetamine, as defined by K.S.A. 65-4107(d)(3) or (f)(1), and amendments thereto, or an analog thereof, shall be a presumptive term of imprisonment of two times the maximum duration of the presumptive term of imprisonment.

Any decision made by the court regarding the reduction in such sentence shall not be considered a departure and shall not be subject to appeal.\n\n(f) (1) The sentence for a third or subsequent felony conviction of K.S.A. 65-4160 or 65-4162, prior to their repeal, K.S.A. 2010 Supp. 21-36a06, prior to its transfer, or K.S.A. 21-5706, and amendments thereto, shall be a presumptive term of imprisonment and the defendant shall be sentenced to prison as provided by this section.

If the offender was past the offenderâs conditional release date at the time the new offense was committed, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the old sentence but shall begin when the person is ordered released by the prisoner review board or reaches the maximum sentence expiration date on the old sentence, whichever is earlier.

Parole shall not be granted as an award of clemency and shall not be considered a reduction of sentence or a pardon.\n\n(h) The prisoner review board shall hold a parole hearing at least the month prior to the month an inmate will be eligible for parole under subsections (a), (b) and (c). At least one month preceding the parole hearing, the county or district attorney of the county where the inmate was convicted shall give written notice of the time and place of the public comment sessions for the inmate to any victim of the inmateâs crime who is alive and whose address is known to the county or district attorney or, if the victim is deceased, to the victimâs family if the familyâs address is known to the county or district attorney. Except as otherwise provided, failure to notify pursuant to this section shall not be a reason to postpone a parole hearing. In the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or a class A felony, the secretary of corrections shall give written notice of the time and place of the public comment session for such inmate at least one month preceding the public comment session to any victim of such inmateâs crime or the victimâs family pursuant to K.S.A. 74-7338, and amendments thereto. If notification is not given to such victim or such victimâs family in the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or a class A felony, the board shall postpone a decision on parole of the inmate to a time at least 30 days after notification is given as provided in this section. Nothing in this section shall create a cause of action against the state or an employee of the state acting within the scope of the employeeâs employment as a result of the failure to notify pursuant to this section. If granted parole, the inmate may be released on parole on the date specified by the board, but not earlier than the date the inmate is eligible for parole under subsections (a), (b) and (c). At each parole hearing and, if parole is not granted, at such intervals thereafter as it determines appropriate, the board shall consider: (1) Whether the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs required by any agreement entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, or any revision of such agreement; and (2) all pertinent information regarding such inmate, including, but not limited to, the circumstances of the offense of the inmate; the presentence report; the previous social history and criminal record of the inmate; the conduct, employment, and attitude of the inmate in prison; the reports of such physical and mental examinations as have been made, including, but not limited to, risk factors revealed by any risk assessment of the inmate; comments of the victim and the victimâs family including in person comments, contemporaneous comments and prerecorded comments made by any technological means; comments of the public; official comments; any recommendation by the staff of the facility where the inmate is incarcerated; proportionality of the time the inmate has served to the sentence a person would receive under the Kansas sentencing guidelines for the conduct that resulted in the inmateâs incarceration; and capacity of state correctional institutions.\n\n(i) In those cases involving inmates sentenced for a crime committed after July 1, 1993, the prisoner review board will review the inmateâs proposed release plan. The board may schedule a hearing if they desire. The board may impose any condition they deem necessary to insure public safety, aid in the reintegration of the inmate into the community, or items not completed under the agreement entered into under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto. The board may not advance or delay an inmateâs release date. Every inmate while on postrelease supervision shall remain in the legal custody of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders of the secretary.\n\n(j) (1) Before ordering the parole of any inmate, the prisoner review board shall have the inmate appear either in person or via a video conferencing format and shall interview the inmate unless impractical because of the inmateâs physical or mental condition or absence from the institution. Every inmate while on parole shall remain in the legal custody of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders of the secretary. Whenever the board formally considers placing an inmate on parole and no agreement has been entered into with the inmate under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, the board shall notify the inmate in writing of the reasons for not granting parole. If an agreement has been entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the inmate has not satisfactorily completed the programs specified in the agreement, or any revision of such agreement, the board shall notify the inmate in writing of the specific programs the inmate must satisfactorily complete before parole will be granted. If parole is not granted only because of a failure to satisfactorily complete such programs, the board shall grant parole upon the secretaryâs certification that the inmate has successfully completed such programs. If an agreement has been entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the secretary of corrections has reported to the board in writing that the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs required by such agreement, or any revision thereof, the board shall not require further program participation. However, if the board determines that other pertinent information regarding the inmate warrants the inmateâs not being released on parole, the board shall state in writing the reasons for not granting the parole. If parole is denied for an inmate sentenced for a crime other than a class A or class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board shall hold another parole hearing for the inmate not later than one year after the denial unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing if held in the next three years or during the interim period of a deferral. In such case, the board may defer subsequent parole hearings for up to three years but any such deferral by the board shall require the board to state the basis for its findings. If parole is denied for an inmate sentenced for a class A or class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board shall hold another parole hearing for the inmate not later than three years after the denial unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing if held in the next 10 years or during the interim period of a deferral. In such case, the board may defer subsequent parole hearings for up to 10 years, but any such deferral shall require the board to state the basis for its findings.\n\n(2) Inmates sentenced for a class A or class B felony who have not had a board hearing in the five years prior to July 1, 2010, shall have such inmatesâ cases reviewed by the board on or before July 1, 2012.
