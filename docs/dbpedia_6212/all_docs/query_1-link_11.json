        "text": "Kansas entered the Union in January 1861, a little over two months prior to the start of the Civil War and seven years after it became a territory under the aptly named Kansas-Nebraska Act. The state is strongly Republican in presidential elections; it hasn’t voted for a Democrat since 1964, when Lyndon Johnson won the presidency in a landslide. In 2020, Donald Trump won by 56% to 42% over Joe Biden.\n\nKansas’ population growth has been slower than the nation’s as a whole in recent decades, as population trends have been away from rural locations to more urban centers. As a result, the state has lost electoral influence: From a peak of 10 electoral votes in the early part of the 20th century to six today."
