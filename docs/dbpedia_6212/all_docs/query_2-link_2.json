A total of 36 seats in the 100-member U.S. Senate were contested. 33 Class 2 seats were contested for regular 6-year terms to be served from January 3, 2015, to January 3, 2021, and 3 Class 3 seats were contested in special elections due to Senate vacancies. The elections marked 100 years of direct elections of U.S. senators. Going into the elections, 21 of the contested seats were held by the Democratic Party, while 15 were held by the Republican Party.\n\nThe Republicans regained the majority of the Senate in the 114th Congress, which started in January 2015; the Republicans had not controlled the Senate since January 2007. They needed a net gain of at least 6 seats to obtain a majority and were projected by polls to do so. On election night, they held all of their seats and gained 9 Democratic-held seats. Republicans defeated 5 Democratic incumbents: Mark Begich of Alaska lost to Dan Sullivan, Mark Pryor of Arkansas lost to Tom Cotton, Mark Udall of Colorado lost to Cory Gardner, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana lost to Bill Cassidy, and Kay Hagan of North Carolina lost to Thom Tillis. Republicans also picked up another 4 open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia that were previously held by Democrats. Democrats did not pick up any Republican-held seats, but they did hold an open seat in Michigan.\n\nThis was the second consecutive election cycle held in a president's sixth year where control of the Senate changed hands, the first being in 2006. This was also the first time that the Democrats lost control of the Senate in a sixth-year midterm election cycle since 1918. With a total net gain of 9 seats, the Republicans made the largest Senate gain by any party since 1980. This is also the first election cycle since 1980 in which more than 2 incumbent Democratic senators were defeated by their Republican challengers.[2] Days after the election cycle, the United States Election Project estimated that 36.4% of eligible voters voted, 4% lower than the 2010 elections, and possibly the lowest turnout rate since the 1942 election cycle.[3][4]\n\nAs of 2022, this remains the last time that a Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Colorado. This is the most recent Senate election where any Republican flipped an open Democratic-held seat. It also remains the last time that the president's party has suffered a net loss of Senate seats in a midterm election cycle.\n\nPartisan composition\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a majority, Republicans needed at least 51 seats. Democrats could have retained a majority with 48 seats (assuming the two Independents continued to caucus with them) because the Democratic Vice President Joe Biden would become the tie-breaker. From 1915 to 2013, control of the U.S. Senate flipped in 10 of 50 cycles, or 20% of the time.[5] Republicans had lost ground in the 2012 elections, leading to an internal fight among the Republican leadership over the best strategies and tactics for the 2014 Senate races.[6] By December 2013, eight of the twelve incumbent Republicans running for re-election saw Tea Party challenges.[7] However, Republican incumbents won every primary challenge.[8] Although Democrats saw some opportunities for pickups, the combination of Democratic retirements and numerous Democratic seats up for election in swing states and red states gave Republicans hopes of taking control of the Senate.[9] 7 of the 21 states with Democratic seats up for election in 2014 had voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election compared to just 1 state with a Republican senator that voted for Barack Obama. Democrats also faced the lower voter turnout that accompanies mid-term elections.[10]\n\nPoll aggregation website FiveThirtyEight gave the Republican Party a 60% chance of taking control of the Senate as of September 28.[11] Another poll aggregation website, RealClearPolitics, gave the Republican Party a net gain of 7 seats.[12] Due to the closeness of several races, it was initially believed that Senate control might not be decided on election night.[13] Both Louisiana and Georgia were seen as competitive, and both states require a run-off election if no candidate takes a majority of the vote.\n\nTwo independent candidates (in Kansas and South Dakota[14]) refused to commit to caucusing with either party.[13] In the final months of the race, polls showed them with viable chances of winning, leading some analysts to speculate on the possibility of an \"Independent caucus\" that could also include Maine Senator Angus King and possibly Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.[15][16] However, no Independent won a Senate race in 2014, and King and Sanders continue to caucus with the Democratic Party following the 2014 election cycle.\n\nBy midnight ET, most major networks projected that the Republicans would take control of the Senate. The party held all three competitive Republican-held seats (Kentucky, Kansas, and Georgia), and defeated incumbent Democrats in North Carolina, Colorado, and Arkansas. Combined with the pick-ups of open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, the Republicans made a net gain of 7 seats before the end of the night. Republicans defeated three incumbent Democrats, a task the party had not accomplished since the 1980 election cycle.[17] Five of the seven confirmed pickups were in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but two of the seats that Republicans won represent states that voted for Barack Obama in 2012 (Colorado and Iowa). Of the three races that were not called by the end of election night, Alaska and Virginia were still too close to call, while Louisiana held a December 6 run-off election. Virginia declared Democrat Mark Warner the winner of his race by a narrow margin over Republican Ed Gillespie on November 7, and Alaska declared Dan Sullivan the winner against Democratic incumbent Mark Begich a week later, on November 12. Republican Bill Cassidy defeated Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu in the Louisiana runoff on December 6.\n\nElection spending\n\n[edit]\n\nAltogether, at least $3.67 billion was spent by candidates, parties, committees and outside groups in the 2014 election cycle.[18][19] Spending on the 2014 Senate elections by outside groups (i.e., organizations other than a candidate's campaign, such as super PACs and \"dark money\" nonprofit groups) more than doubled from 2010. In the 10 competitive races for which data was available, outside groups accounted for 47% of spending, candidates accounted for 41% of spending, and parties accounted for 12% of spending.[20] The Senate race with the most outside spending was in North Carolina, at $80 million, a new record.[20]\n\nThe top outside spenders in the 11 most competitive Senate races were the following:\n\nOn the Republican side, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Crossroads GPS, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Ending Spending Action Fund, Freedom Partners Action Fund, American Crossroads, and the NRA Political Victory Fund.[20]\n\nOn the Democratic side, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senate Majority PAC, and NextGen Climate Action Committee.[20]\n\nResults summary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Republican Party made a net gain of nine U.S. Senate seats in the 2014 elections.[21]\n\nGoing into the elections, there were 53 Democratic, 45 Republican and 2 independent senators (both of whom caucus with the Democrats). In all, there were 36 elections: 33 senators were up for election this year as class 2 senators, and 3 faced special elections (all from Class 3). Of all these seats, 21 were held by Democrats and 15 were held by Republicans.\n\n↓ 44 2 54\n\nDemocratic Independent Republican\n\nColored shading indicates party with largest share of that row.\n\nParties Total Democratic Republican Independent Libertarian Green Other Before these elections 53 45 2 — — — 100 Not up 32 30 2 — — — 64 Class 1 (2012→2018) 23 8 2 — — — 33 Class 3 (2010→2016) 9 22 — — — — 31 Up 21 15 — — — — 36 General: Class 2 20 13 — — — — 33 Special: Class 3 1 2 — — — — 3 Incumbent retired 4 3[b] — — — — 7 Held by same party 1 3 — — — — 4 Replaced by other party 3 Democrats replaced by 3 Republicans — — — — 3 Result 1 6 — — — — 7 Incumbent ran 17[c][d] 12[c] — — — — 29 Won election 11[e] 12[e] — — — — 23 Lost re-election 5 Democrats replaced by 5 Republicans — — — — 5 Lost renomination\n\nbut held by same party — — — — — — 0 Withdrew from nomination\n\nand party lost 1 Democrat replaced by 1 Republican — — — — 1 Result 11 18 — — — — 29 Total elected 12 24 0 — — — 36 Net gain/loss 9 9 — — — — 9 Nationwide vote 19,786,883 23,253,636 698,161 879,722 152,703 394,075 45,165,180 Share 43.81% 51.49% 1.55% 1.95% 0.34% 0.87% 100% Result 44 54 2 — — — 100\n\nSource: Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives[1]\n\nChange in composition\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the elections\n\n[edit]\n\nD1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9 D10 D20 D19 D18 D17 D16 D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D21 D22 D23 D24 D25 D26 D27 D28 D29 D30 D40\n\nLa.\n\nRan D39\n\nIowa\n\nRetired D38\n\nIll.\n\nRan D37\n\nHawaii (sp)\n\nRan D36\n\nDel.\n\nRan D35\n\nColo.\n\nRan D34\n\nArk.\n\nRan D33\n\nAlaska\n\nRan D32 D31 D41\n\nMass.\n\nRan D42\n\nMich.\n\nRetired D43\n\nMinn.\n\nRan D44\n\nMont.\n\nWithdrew D45\n\nN.H.\n\nRan D46\n\nN.J.\n\nRan D47\n\nN.M.\n\nRan D48\n\nN.C.\n\nRan D49\n\nOre.\n\nRan D50\n\nR.I.\n\nRan Majority→ D51\n\nS.D.\n\nRetired R41\n\nS.C.
