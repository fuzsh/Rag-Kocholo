        "text": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nThere are also 435 elections across the country that will determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans are hoping to expand their narrow majority.\n\nThe lawmaker in charge of that effort is North Carolina Republican Congressman Richard Hudson, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, who joins us now.\n\nThanks for being with us.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson:\n\nWell, you have to start by pointing out that it's a very small map. There are 435 members of Congress, but there are only 35 who won their seat with 5 percent or less. So there are very few seats up for grabs when you look at the total map.\n\nSo, of those 35, it's been said there's probably about 22, 11 on each side, that are really up for grabs. So when you look at what's the battlefield, where are we actually out there trying to pick up seats, what are the seats we have got to hold, there are very few.\n\nBut, having said that, we feel like the environment is in our favor. We feel like the quality candidates we have recruited as challengers around the country are very good. And so we're in a strong position to not just hold our majority, but we think we're going to pick up seats.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson:\n\nWell, I think the American people aren't really concerned with who holds what gavel in Washington. I think they're worried about safety in their neighborhood. They're worried about an open border. They're worried about inflation and the fact that the things they need to buy off their families are too expensive.\n\nThat's what's on voters' minds. And the voters have decided that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, their policies have made them less prosperous and made them less safe. And if you look at the polling, they trust Republicans on these issues.\n\nWe, as the Republican House, we passed a number of bills that the Senate decided not to take up, but they demonstrate our positions on energy, on parents bill of rights to give parents more decision-making in education, measures to bring down inflation. These are the policies we're going to run on, and that's why I think we're going to be successful.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson:\n\nWell, I think Donald Trump is going to be an asset for all of our candidates. I think Donald Trump is going to win this election.\n\nBut the issues that we're running on are the issues that the voters care most about, as I mentioned, inflation, open border, crime in their neighborhoods, fentanyl. And all these issues, Republicans have solutions. And the policies of the Biden/Harris administration have been wrong and they put the country on the wrong track.\n\nAnd so we're running on the issues, and it just so happens the voters trust us on those issues.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson:\n\nWe do.\n\nWe have done a good job of fund-raising. We have broken a lot of fund-raising records, but it just so happens that Democrats have done better. And, historically, Democrats have raised more money than Republicans. They have some structural advantages that allow them to do that.\n\nI don't need to match the Democrats dollar for dollar, but we do need to continue to raise money. The key is you have got to have the money for your candidates to tell their story and to connect with the voters. And we want the resources to do that.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson:\n\nWell, I'm not going to give you a number because if I fall one short, don't pick up a bunch, then it looked like we failed.\n\nBut I do feel very confident that we're not just going to hold the House. We're going to pick up some seats, but, again, within that caveat I mentioned earlier that there aren't that many up for grabs total. You're not going to see these huge swings that we have seen in the past where 20 seats go one way or the other. Every single one of these 35 seats is going to be very close."
