        "text": "With six weeks to go before the midterm elections, the playing field has started to narrow. Increasingly, it appears that control of the Senate will hinge on as few as four key races.\n\nBased on the past two Senate elections, polling in September is highly predictive of the final outcome. Consider 2010, the last midterm election: the following table compares Senate polling data between the two major-party candidates in 2010, from August through the middle of September, with the final election outcome. (The first column of numbers shows polling medians, which are more accurate than any single poll.)\n\nThe eventual winner was almost always the candidate who led in the polls. The two exceptions, in Nevada and Colorado, occurred when the race was tied or when the lead was less than five percentage points. In all other cases, even when polls differed in more significant ways from the ultimate outcome, they still pointed toward the correct winner. This principle held in 2012 as well. It seems fair to say, then, that a lead of a few percentage points in September can predict a likely—though not certain—November victory.\n\nIt should also be noted that, on average, Democratic Senate candidates ended up outperforming their August-September polls by 1.7 percentage points. This was a marked difference from the House, where national opinion was swinging strongly toward Republicans as part of a wave election in which the G.O.P. made significant gains. Evidently, national opinion in Senate and House races do not move in perfect lockstep.\n\nThis year, ten Senate races are currently within six percentage points or less based on August-September poll medians, as shown in the first column of numbers. They are shown below, along with polling medians taken beginning on August 1st. Not listed are safe seats, such as Virginia (Democrat Mark Warner) and Mississippi (Republican Thad Cochran), or seats that are not up for election.\n\nThe last column of numbers shows win probabilities, which are calculated on the assumption that in individual races results will tend to change approximately as much as they did in 2010, when voter opinion was fairly mobile, at least in the House. If we assume that a candidates with a win probability greater than eighty per cent will probably win his or her election, only four uncertain races remain: Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, and Arkansas. In each of these contests, the candidates are within two percentage points of one another. Power in the Senate will almost certainly depend on what happens in these states.\n\nTwo of the closest races will take place in Colorado, where Democrat Mark Udall’s lead has recently diminished to a near-tie with Republican Cory Gardner, and in Iowa, where Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst are locked in a race in which neither candidate has led by more than a few points since June. Since Vice-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, would break any ties, Democrats and Independents would need to win only one of these four races to reach fifty votes and be able, in principle, to control the chamber. In the past, the two Independents, Angus King, of Maine, and Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, have caucused with Democrats.\n\nOn average, I expect two of the front-runners to lose. The problem is, I don’t know which ones. But the over-all picture, as shown by the following histogram of all possible outcomes based on win probabilities, looks somewhat favorable for Democrats.\n\nThe red bars show the probability of an election result of forty-nine or fewer Democratic and Independent seats, leaving fifty one seats for Republicans and guaranteeing them control. The blue-shaded regions show the chances of Democrats and Independents reaching fifty seats without the Kansas Independent Greg Orman. In this calculation, it is highly likely that Democrats and Independents will control between forty-nine and fifty-two Senate seats, and, over-all, the probability of continued Democratic control is seemingly over seventy per cent. However, things are not quite that simple.\n\nThe green region shows the case where Orman could provide a key vote for either party. As I explained in an earlier post, Orman, who currently leads the incumbent Republican Senator Pat Roberts by more than five percentage points, is the true wild card. Who will Orman caucus with? On his campaign Web site, he has made two somewhat inconsistent promises: to caucus with the party that is clearly in the majority and to end the obstruction of the past few years. If the other Democrats and Independents control forty-nine seats, and Republicans control fifty seats, Orman’s two claims could no longer coexist. In that scenario, which I estimate has a twenty four percent chance of occurring, Orman would have to choose between a caucus that controls one fewer seat (the Democrats) and a caucus that has taken obstruction of legislation, judicial nominations, and executive appointments to impressive heights (the Republicans). Polling math is powerless to predict this outcome.\n\nThere is also still time for opinion to move in a substantial way. (Other Senate prediction models like the Times’ Leo, place substantial weight on this possibility. For an explanation of why my model is different, see my earlier post on fundamentals.) In 2010, individual races moved by as many as ten percentage points between late September and Election Day. Although the probabilities seem to favor Democrats, there is still plenty of room for the outcome to swing to the Republicans.\n\nThe narrowing of the Senate race has created a handful of intense battlegrounds—an activist from Tennessee will affect the Senate far more by driving even one Arkansas voter to the polls than she will by casting her own vote at home. Voters in states with substantial urban populations, such as Colorado, can expect campaign advertisements to intensify. Finally, the smaller a state’s population the more powerful the individual voter, a principle that makes Alaska a prime destination for adventurous campaigners who may be betting on a big swing there. The ground war for the Senate is about to get very specific."
