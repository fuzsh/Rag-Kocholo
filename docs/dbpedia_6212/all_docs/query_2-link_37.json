        "text": "Patty Murray (born October 11, 1950, Bothell, Washington, U.S.) is an American politician who was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1992 and began representing Washington the following year. Murray was the first female senator from the state, and she later became the first woman to serve as president pro tempore of the Senate (2023– ).\n\nJones grew up in Bothell, near Seattle. Her father, a World War II veteran, owned a general store, and after he fell ill with multiple sclerosis, the family struggled financially. While attending Washington State University, she worked as an intern in a Veterans Administration psychiatric hospital. In 1972 she received a bachelor’s degree in physical education, and that year she also married Rob Murray; the couple later had two children. She subsequently taught a course in parenting skills at a community college.\n\nAfter overseeing a community effort to save an endangered school program, Murray successfully ran for a seat on her local school board. She served from 1985 to 1989, when she entered the Washington Senate. In 1992 Murray ran a grassroots campaign—built around a tongue-in-cheek image of herself as just a “mom in tennis shoes”—for the U.S. Senate. In the general election, she defeated a five-term Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives and took office the following year.\n\nMurray was considered a moderate to liberal Democrat who usually voted with her party leadership, although she broke from it on several points. Notably, she supported efforts by the administration of Pres. Barack Obama, opposed by most congressional Democrats, to secure free-trade agreements, arguing that they were vital to her home state, which relied on international trade. She also led her party’s efforts to secure increases in the federal minimum wage. Murray voted against authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, and she championed expanded health care coverage for women, introducing legislation in 2014 to provide victims of rape with emergency contraceptive care. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade (1973) in 2022, Murray sought to codify abortion rights.\n\nIn 2022 Murray won her sixth term in the Senate. The following year she was elected president pro tempore, becoming the first woman to hold the office."
