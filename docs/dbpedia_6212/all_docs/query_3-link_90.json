        "text": "Union Station opens to the public. Just after midnight on the morning of Nov. 1, the first train, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Flyer, arrives at Union Station. The station cost nearly $6 million and was part of a $50 million investment by KCTR that also included track additions, switching towers, viaducts, and bridges.\n\nAll five World War I allied commanders arrive by train at Union Station and meet together for groundbreaking ceremonies for the Liberty Memorial. Located across the street from Union Station, the Liberty Memorial is a monument dedicated to the men and women who served and died in World War I. The memorial was officially dedicated in 1926.\n\nThe Union Station Massacre marks one of the most infamous dates in Kansas City history. Convicted mobster Frank Nash, under escort by a team of FBI agents and police officers, was shot and killed outside the Station during a shootout. Four law enforcement officers were also killed. There are marks on the front of the building that for years were claimed as bullet holes from the shooting, but tests by Kansas City, Mo. police recently showed the marks could not have come from bullets. However, the myth and the mystery of the incident live on. There were various theories that other mobsters had committed the crime, but the only man ever charged was Adam Richetti, who died in a Missouri gas chamber. As a result of the massacre, Congress strengthened the power of the FBI.\n\nVoters in Jackson, Clay, and Platte counties in Missouri and Johnson County in Kansas approve a one-eighth of a cent bi-state sales tax to restore and redevelop Union Station and create a science museum. The tax raised $118 million toward the total $250 million project. The remaining money was raised through private donations and federal funds. The passage of the bi-state tax is thought to be the first of its kind in the history of the United States.\n\nScience City begins an upgrading plan when Burns & McDonnell invest $1.25 million in new exhibits and sponsors The Battle of the Brains contest to get area schools involved in designing another new exhibit.\n\nBurns & McDonnell and Science City launched the inaugural Battle of the Brains contest. This first year, 560 entries came from 128 schools in 35 area school districts. Over 2,500 students—focused on big STEM topics—competed to have their ideas come to life as the next new interactive exhibit at Kansas City’s Science Center – Science City at Union Station. Battle of the Brains has grown and flourished in subsequent years and now supports the ongoing re-imagination of our world-class center.\n\nScience City opens The Science of Energy, which was the winning entry from the Battle of the Brains competition, and was designed by students from Olathe North High School.\n\nMarch 2013, the fully renovated Regnier Extreme Screen Theatre re-opens and begins offering nature films and first-run movies for the first time. The theatre is wired with a 1 gig connectivity, offering the opportunity for live streams on the large screen for special events."
