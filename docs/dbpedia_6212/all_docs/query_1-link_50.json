        "text": "Late yesterday afternoon, there was a big shakeup in what had been until now a pretty stable Senate election cycle: Pat Roberts of Kansas, who was already unpopular, became the the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator when the Democratic nominee suddenly abandoned his campaign -- giving independent Greg Orman an opportunity to consolidate the anti-Roberts vote and perhaps win. (Secretary of State Kris Kobach ruled today that the Democratic candidate had to remain on the ballot. If the ruling is upheld, it would give Roberts an advantage, perhaps one that could not be overcome. This is headed to the courts, so we'll have to wait to find out what the Kansas Senate ballot will look like this fall.)\n\nDespite the uncertainty, it's worth asking what would happen if Orman won the general. Who would he caucus with, the Democrats or the Republicans?"
