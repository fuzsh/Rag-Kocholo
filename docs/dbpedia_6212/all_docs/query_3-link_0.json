        "text": "The 2014 Kansas gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2014, to elect the Governor of Kansas, concurrently with the election of Kansas' Class II U.S. Senate seat, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections.\n\nIncumbent Republican Governor Sam Brownback ran for re-election to a second term.[1] He was opposed in the general election by Democrat Paul Davis, the Minority Leader of the Kansas House of Representatives, and Libertarian attorney Keen Umbehr.\n\nThe election was viewed as a referendum on Brownback's aggressive tax cutting initiatives and his conservative values.[2] The consensus among The Cook Political Report, Governing, The Rothenberg Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball, Daily Kos Elections, and others was that the contest was a tossup. Brownback won the election by a margin of 3.69%. Davis carried seven counties, all in eastern Kansas. As of 2024, this is the most recent time a Republican and/or a man was elected Governor of Kansas. This was also the last gubernatorial election in which a Democratic candidate won Jefferson County, as well as the last time that a candidate was elected Governor of Kansas by winning a majority of counties.\n\nRepublican primary\n\n[edit]\n\nDeclared\n\n[edit]\n\nSam Brownback, incumbent Governor[1]\n\nRunning mate: Jeff Colyer, incumbent Lieutenant Governor\n\nJennifer Winn, businesswoman[3]\n\nRunning mate: Robin Lais, advertising agency owner and natural healing shop owner[4]\n\nFormer running mate: Ethan McCord, Iraq War veteran[5]\n\nDeclined\n\n[edit]\n\nKris Kobach, Secretary of State of Kansas (running for re-election)[6]\n\nSteve Morris, former President of the Kansas Senate[7]\n\nSandy Praeger, Kansas Insurance Commissioner (endorsed Paul Davis)[8][9]\n\nPolling\n\n[edit]\n\nPoll source Date(s)\n\nadministered Sample\n\nsize Margin of\n\nerror Sam\n\nBrownback Jennifer\n\nWinn Undecided SurveyUSA July 17–22, 2014 691 ± 3.7% 60% 30% 9% SurveyUSA June 19–23, 2014 508 ± 4.4% 55% 37% 8%\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nRepublican primary results[10] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 263,594 100\n\nDemocratic primary\n\n[edit]\n\nDeclared\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Davis, Minority Leader of the Kansas House of Representatives[11]\n\nRunning mate: Jill Docking, businesswoman, former member of the Kansas Board of Regents and nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1996 (running for Lieutenant Governor)[12][13]\n\nDeclined\n\n[edit]\n\nCarl Brewer, mayor of Wichita[9]\n\nJill Docking\n\nTom Holland, state senator and nominee for governor in 2010[7]\n\nDeb Miller, former secretary of the Kansas Department of Transportation[7]\n\nStephen Morris, former Republican President of the Kansas Senate[7]\n\nMark Parkinson, former governor, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living[9]\n\nSandy Praeger, Republican Kansas Insurance Commissioner[8][9]\n\nJoe Reardon, former mayor of Kansas City[9]\n\nJoshua Svaty, vice president of The Land Institute and former Secretary of Agriculture of Kansas[7]\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nDemocratic primary results[10] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 66,357 100\n\nLibertarian nomination\n\n[edit]\n\nDeclared\n\n[edit]\n\nKeen Umbehr, attorney[14]\n\nRunning mate: Josh Umbehr, physician and son of Keen Umbehr[15]\n\nGeneral election\n\n[edit]\n\nDebates\n\n[edit]\n\nComplete video of debate, September 6, 2014 - C-SPAN\n\nComplete video of debate, October 21, 2014 - C-SPAN\n\nEndorsements\n\n[edit]\n\nPredictions\n\n[edit]\n\nSource Ranking As of The Cook Political Report[25] Tossup November 3, 2014 Sabato's Crystal Ball[26] Lean D (flip) November 3, 2014 Rothenberg Political Report[27] Tossup November 3, 2014 Real Clear Politics[28] Tossup November 3, 2014\n\nPolling\n\n[edit]\n\nPoll source Date(s)\n\nadministered Sample\n\nsize Margin of\n\nerror Sam\n\nBrownback (R) Paul\n\nDavis (D) Keen\n\nUmbehr (L) Other Undecided Public Policy Polling November 1–3, 2014 963 ± 3.2% 45% 46% 4% — 4% 47% 48% — — 3% Public Policy Polling October 30–31, 2014 752 ± ?
