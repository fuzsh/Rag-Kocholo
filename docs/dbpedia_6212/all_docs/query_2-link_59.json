By law, a polling place must be accessible to a person with disabilities. It is a good idea to check the accessibility of the polling place ahead of time. You may find the building not accessible or have trouble getting to the polling location inside the building. If so, you may request that a poll worker bring a ballot to the building entrance or bring a friend along to assist you. If your polling place is not accessible, notify your city, town or village clerk's office and the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\nVoting on Election Day\n\nKnow Your Rights Voters with disabilities should know their rights. A voter with a disability cannot be turned away from the polls because a poll worker thinks they are not ‘qualified’ to vote. Disability or medical diagnosis does not take away the right to vote. Only the courts can take away that right.\n\nTo ensure that our voting process is accessible to all, disabled voters have the right to request accommodations.\n\nThese are some of the most widely used accommodations:\n\nCurbside voting is required by state statute for any voter who cannot enter the polling place due to disability. Contact your clerk in advance to ask how to access curbside voting.\n\nIf a voter needs help marking the ballot, they may have a person of their choice assist them. That person does not need to be qualified to vote. The voter may bring someone with them or request assistance from a poll worker. The assistor cannot be the voter’s employer or union representative.\n\nIf a voter inside the polling location cannot sign the poll list due to a physical disability, they should inform a poll worker. The poll worker will write “Exempt by order of inspectors'' in the signature space on the poll list.\n\nAll polling places must have accessible voting equipment set up and turned on. This equipment allows voters to independently and privately mark the ballot. It should be set up to allow voters who use a wheelchair to reach the controls and have an audio ballot marking option for voters with a visual disability. Any voter may use this equipment.\n\nThe poll worker may ask voters to speak their name and address. If a voter is unable to state their name and address, Wisconsin law allows voters to have poll workers or assistor of their choosing state their name and address on their behalf prior to receiving a ballot. Voters can also provide their information in writing to poll workers or assistors.\n\nOther reasonable accommodations can be requested. Speak to the chief inspector at your polling place.\n\nAbsentee Voting\n\nIf you need help returning your ballot because you have a disability, your rights are protected by the Voting Rights Act. You must be permitted to receive assistance from someone of your choice, other than your employer or agent of that employer or officer or agent of your union.\n\nThe person returning your ballot may also be the person who assists you with completing your ballot and/or who acts as your witness.\n\nIt is up to you, the voter, to determine if you need assistance mailing or delivering your ballot because of disability. Election officials cannot inquire about your disability status beyond the questions described below. No additional steps may be taken to verify your disability or right to assistance.\n\nClerks may not create additional requirements or require documentation from voters with disabilities who need ballot return assistance.\n\nYou may check with your Municipal Clerk to determine where your assistor should deliver your ballot.

These machines read the paper ballots inserted into them and electronically tabulate or count and add up the votes for each candidate and contest on the ballot. Numerous studies have found that tabulators are more accurate and much quicker than hand counting by humans. Learn more about the tabulators used in Wisconsin.\n\nBallot Marking Devices - Ballot marking devices (sometimes also called accessible voting equipment) are required by law to be available at every polling place in Wisconsin. This equipment provides assistance to voters to help them mark their selections on their ballot. This equipment often includes a touchscreen or keypad to help voters navigate making their selections. Many voters with disabilities rely on ballot marking devices to vote privately and independently. After using a ballot marking device, voters are able to review their selections on a paper ballot or paper record before having their ballot read by the tabulator. Learn more about the ballot marking devices used in Wisconsin.\n\nElectronic Poll Books - In Wisconsin electronic poll books are also known as “Badger Books”. The Badger Book is an electronic version of the paper poll book and serves the same functions as the paper poll book. It is used to check in voters, process Election Day Registrations, and record absentee voting participation. Learn more about Badger Books.\n\nTesting of Voting Machines: It is important to know that all voting equipment in Wisconsin is required to be tested before each election. Additionally, after every November election, election officials conduct post-election equipment audits to ensure the accuracy of the voting equipment.\n\nThe Paper Record: Every ballot cast in Wisconsin has a paper record. The paper record ensures that election officials can manually compare the paper ballots with the electronic tallies in case of doubts or discrepancies. It’s a safeguard against any potential errors, tampering, or inconsistencies.\n\nYou can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC) resource."
