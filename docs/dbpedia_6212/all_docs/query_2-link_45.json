        "text": "With less than four weeks until the midterms, I thought that it might be worthwhile to put together a map of the key Senate races, which I’ll update regularly between now and November 4th. As I did during the 2012 general election, I’ll try and make some calls, based on the latest polling data, reports from the campaign trail, and other factors. I don’t have my own statistical forecasting model, but I’ll also pay attention to the predictions from those that do, including FiveThirtyEight, the Times, and the Washington Post.\n\nIn all, thirty-six Senate seats will be contested. Thirty-three of them are on the normal six-year reëlection cycle, and there are also special elections in Hawaii, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. Back in May, I noted that most of the pundits and the political professionals “believe that the basic story line has already been set. This is going to be a bad year for Democrats. The only question is: how bad?”\n\nAt this stage, the answer to that question almost certainly depends on what happens in ten battleground states: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. To take control of the Senate, the Republicans must pick up six seats currently held by the Democrats, and they appear to be well ahead in three such races: Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia. Assuming that this doesn’t change, the task facing the G.O.P. is to hold on to the three Republican seats in the battleground states—Georgia, Kansas, and Kentucky—and pick up three of the seven competitive Democratic seats.\n\nRight now, the Republicans’ best bets look to be the contests in Alaska, Arkansas, and Louisiana. But, as I pointed out on Monday, the situation is complicated by what’s happening in Kansas, where Greg Orman, a local businessman running as an independent, appears to be ahead of Republican Senator Pat Roberts. If Orman wins, the G.O.P. would need to pick up a fourth Democratic seat to be sure of a majority, with the races in Iowa or Colorado being the most obvious targets. In any case, all ten contests in the battleground states are close enough to be interesting. Here is a brief snapshot of each of them:\n\nAlaska: President Obama’s low approval rating is hurting the Democratic incumbent, Mark Begich, and helping his opponent, Dan Sullivan, the state’s former attorney general. Individual Alaskan opinion polls are famously unreliable, but six surveys taken since mid-August have shown Sullivan leading Begich, with the margin varying from two percentage points to six percentage points. Still, the Senator is a skillful campaigner, and the Democratic get-out-the-vote operation is widely acknowledged to be superior to the Republican one. With a series of television debates just starting, Begich can’t be written off. Right now, though, he is in trouble. Status: leaning Republican.\n\nArkansas: A similar story to Alaska, except President Obama’s approval ratings might be even lower here. (In a recent poll from NBC News/Marist College, it was just thirty-one per cent.) In another parallel with the Alaska race, the Republican candidate, Tom Cotton, is a military veteran who went to Harvard. A one-term U.S. congressman for the state’s fourth district, he’s not much of a speechifier, relying primarily on linking his opponent, Mark Pryor, to Obama. All but one of the recent public polls show him leading, albeit by pretty narrow margins. A couple of days ago, Pryor played his ace, calling in Bill Clinton to campaign for him. It remains to be seen what impact the home-town boy will have on the race. Status: leaning Republican.\n\nColorado: Mark Udall, the incumbent Democratic senator, has been leading in the polls for most of the year. However, in the past month, the Republican candidate, U.S. Congressman Cory Gardner, has made a strong run at him. In a state that is finely balanced politically, the polls indicate that the race is now virtually level, which means that a mistake could cost either candidate the election. In a televised debate on Monday, Gardner portrayed Udall as a patsy for Obama, saying that he had voted with the President ninety-nine per cent of the time. Udall defended his record on issues like cap-and-trade and Obamacare, both of which he supports, and said that Gardner was a Republican extremist. Status: too close to call.\n\nGeorgia: Democrats are still hoping that Michelle Nunn, the daughter of Sam Nunn, who represented the state in the Senate for twenty-four years, can somehow snatch the seat currently occupied by the Republican Saxby Chambliss, who is retiring. But David Perdue, a wealthy G.O.P. businessman who hails from Macon, in the center of the state, has established a steady lead in the polls. The race still appears to be tight, however, and Nunn is trying to take advantage of an admission by Perdue, who is a former C.E.O. of the retailer Dollar General, that he spent much of his career outsourcing jobs. In a televised debate on Tuesday night, Perdue fought back, saying that a vote for Nunn was a vote for Senator Harry Reid, another Democrat with low approval ratings. Status: leaning Republican.\n\nIowa: In the race to succeed Tom Harkin, the liberal lion of the Plains, the Republican Joni Ernst, an ultra-conservative state senator who briefly interrupted her campaign to carry out her duties in the Iowa Army National Guard, appears to have a narrow advantage over Bruce Braley, a Democratic congressman whose district includes Des Moines. In ten polls taken since the start of September, Ernst was ahead in four, and three were tied. Like many other G.O.P. candidates, she benefits from President Obama’s low approval ratings in her state, But the race remains close, and the Democrats are seeking to turn things around by attacking Ernst’s anti-abortion views, and by accusing her of wanting to privatize social security (a claim contested by factcheck.org). Braley, meanwhile, is portraying himself as a moderate who can work with all sides. Over the weekend, he said, “I’m a bridge builder, not a bridge burner.” Status: too close to call.\n\nKansas: In this race, which I wrote about a couple of days ago, Orman, a forty-five-year-old private-equity executive, continues to lead Roberts, the seventy-eight-year-old three-term Republican incumbent, in the polls. Fearful that an Orman victory could derail their entire effort to take the Senate, Republican opposition research teams are delving through his business career and seeking to portray him as opportunistic and untrustworthy. The race is likely to go down to the wire, and you can expect to see practically every leading Republican in the country make an appeal to the Party’s supporters in Kansas. But with an uninspiring candidate in Roberts, the G.O.P. is in trouble._ Status: leaning independent._\n\nKentucky: At the start of the year, Democrats dreamed of toppling Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, on his home turf. Alison Lundergan Grimes, the thirty-five-year-old secretary of state for Kentucky, is giving him a scare. Partly by running negative ads linking Grimes to President Obama, McConnell has established a lead in the polls over the past couple of months. But Grimes has fought back, running an ad of herself skeet shooting, and saying that she disagrees with the President on guns, coal, and the Environmental Protection Agency. On Monday, a new poll, carried out by SurveyUSA, showed the Democrat with a two-point lead. As Philip Bump noted in the Washington Post, it’s too early to say whether this is a rogue poll, or if it is picking up something significant. Either way, it has created some excitement ahead of next week’s televised debate between the two candidates. Status: leaning Republican.\n\nLouisiana: Mary Landrieu, the three-term Democratic senator, is famous for winning races that she looked likely to lose. In taking on Bill Cassidy, a Baton Rouge doctor who has been a Republican congressman since 2009, she faces her toughest challenge yet. Louisiana is another state where President Obama’s approval rating is under forty per cent. Despite Landrieu’s conservative voting record, Republicans are tying her to Obamacare, and describing her as “a reliable supporter of the rest of President Obama’s failed agenda.” Recent polls suggest that this strategy is working: Cassidy has the lead. Because of Louisiana’s unusual voting system, the contest might well go to a runoff, but the Republicans are increasingly confident. Status: leaning Republican.\n\nNew Hampshire: This was another Democratic seat on the Republican wish list, but Jeanne Shaheen, the former governor of the Granite State who has served just one term in Washington, looks relatively safe. The first woman to go from a statehouse to the Senate, Shaheen has been leading her Republican challenger, Scott Brown, an interloper from neighboring Massachusetts, all year in the polls, and, generally speaking, she continues to do so. But with two surveys in the past month showing the race tied, Brown’s chances can’t be wholly discounted. In a television debate on Monday, which the Boston Globe described as “cordial”—not a word used often this campaign season—he trotted out the by now familiar line that Shaheen had voted with President Obama ninety-nine per cent of the time. Status: leaning Democratic.\n\nNorth Carolina: Of all the embattled Democratic senators seeking reëlection in blue states, Kay Hagan, who came to office in 2009, seems to be making the best of it. That’s partly because her state has seen a lot of demographic changes that have tilted it toward the Democrats. With the aid of a lot of outside money, she’s also fought a strong campaign, and has been rewarded with a steady, albeit narrow, lead in the polls. In fact, all twelve of the surveys carried out over the past month have showed her ahead of her opponent, Thom Tillis, the speaker of the state legislature. During a televised debate on Tuesday night, Hagan sought to press home her advantage, accusing Tillis of ducking questions about his approach to the war on ISIS, and other issues. In a race where incessant attack ads have raised the negative ratings of both candidates, she appears to have held up strongest. Status: leaning Democratic.\n\nAs I have it, that’s five of the ten battleground races leaning Republican, two leaning Democratic, one leaning independent, and two races that are too close to call. If that’s right, the fate of the Senate remains in the balance.\n\nRead more analysis and commentary at our 2014 midterms hub."
