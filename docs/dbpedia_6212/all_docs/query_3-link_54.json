        "text": "Election Results\n\nResults for the most recent elections held will be posted on this web site.\n\nYou may view the results by clicking the appropriate election heading at the bottom of this page.\n\nResults will be periodically updated on Election night. Please note, for expediency in providing results, we will initially post only the results for the contested races with officially filed candidates. Results for all races will be posted at a later time and/or date. All results are UNOFFICIAL until the Board of Canvassers canvasses the votes after the election. The canvass occurs on the Monday following the election at 9:30 a.m. in the Commission Room at the Courthouse in Wellington. The Election Officer may move the canvass to the following Thursday, in which case notice must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The Board of Canvassers determines the validity of any provisional or challenged ballots. Following the processing of the valid ballots, the official vote summary is certified by the Board of Canvassers as the final results of the election. The unofficial results will be updated to the final certified results.\n\nThe timeliness of reporting election results is dependent on:\n\nnumber of voters in line when the polls close at 7:00 p.m.\n\nnumber of candidates and contests on the ballot, and\n\nlength of driving time for returning the ballots to the Election Office from the various voting locations.\n\nProvisional Ballots\n\nProvisional ballots are voted when a voterâ€™s registration is in question, or when our records indicate the voter was already sent an advance ballot. Provisional ballots are sealed in special envelopes at the polls and must be individually research and verified at the Election Office prior to presenting them to the Board of Canvassers.\n\nWrite-in Candidates\n\nIn certain elections, the voter has the option of choosing to vote for a write-in candidate not printed on the ballot. Each write-in candidate must be individually reviewed to determine eligibility status. A complete list of write-in candidates may not be available until after the election canvass.\n\nDocument Center\n\nThe Document Center provides easy access to public documents.
