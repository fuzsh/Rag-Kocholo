        "text": "Longtime Republican Senator Pat Roberts was re-elected after one of the tightest, most hotly contested races in the country, which ended as yet another blow to Democrats.\n\nMr. Roberts has been in Congress since 1981, and he was hammered during the campaign for becoming too much a creature of Washington. In February, The New York Times reported that he did not have a home in Kansas, but instead stayed with donors when in the state. His campaign manager, Leroy Towns, did him no favors after the primary in August by saying the senator planned to go “back home for two days or three to rest.” When he said “home,” he meant Alexandria, Va.\n\nMr. Roberts was challenged by Greg Orman, 45, an independent and an investor. The Democratic candidate, Chad Taylor, dropped out of the race in early September, improving Mr. Orman’s chances of victory.\n\nWhat was expected to be a safe Republican seat became one of the most closely watched Senate contests in the country. Mr. Orman had said he would caucus with whichever party won the majority, so Democrats saw the race as a chance to do away with a reliably Republican vote. But the Republicans’ strong showing Tuesday held true in Kansas.\n\nRepublican Gov. Sam Brownback also fended off a fierce challenge, defeating his Democratic competitor, State Representative Paul Davis.\n\nMr. Brownback has enacted a remarkably conservative agenda since taking office three years ago, making it easier to carry guns in public buildings, increasing scrutiny of voter registration, reducing the number of people on welfare, and whittling down the state’s bureaucracy.\n\nHe also ushered in the biggest income tax cuts in the state’s history, which caused revenue to drop so drastically that it spurred worries about whether the state would be able to finance education adequately. Concerns about the budget, including projections that the state would face hundreds of millions of dollars in annual budget shortfalls, alienated even some reliably Republican voters, and the race grew tight.\n\nBut Republicans generally win statewide races in Kansas, and on Tuesday, they won again.\n\nSecretary of State Kris W. Kobach, a Republican who was re-elected, has a national profile in the immigration debate: He had a hand in writing the strict Arizona law that allows law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of people they suspect may be in the country illegally. He was the architect of “self-deportation,” a philosophy that pushes for ramping up enforcement to such a degree that unauthorized immigrants leave the state of their own accord because day-to-day life has become too difficult. And he has pushed for very tough voter ID laws in Kansas.\n\nHe has also played an important role in the state’s hotly contested Senate race. The Democratic candidate sent a letter to Mr. Kobach in early September withdrawing from the race, but Mr. Kobach tried to keep him on the ballot. The Kansas Supreme Court overruled Mr. Kobach and said the candidate could withdraw.\n\nMr. Kobach ran against Jean Schodorf, a former Republican state senator who became a Democrat after she lost a race for re-election in 2012 against a more conservative challenger."
