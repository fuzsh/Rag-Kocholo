        "text": "Rick Scott (incumbent)\n\nRick Scott, 71, was born in Bloomington, IL, and grew up in Kansas City, MO.\n\nIn 1987, Scott and his partners began acquiring multiple hospitals in the Dallas area. By 1997, their enterprise, Columbia/HCA, had become the largest healthcare provider globally, with annual revenues surpassing $23 billion.\n\nDuring Scott’s tenure as CEO of Columbia/HCA, a federal investigation led to the company paying $1.7 billion in fines in what the U.S. Department of Justice called the largest health care fraud case in U.S. history. Scott resigned in 1997 as part of the settlement, maintaining that he was unaware of the fraud and was never indicted.\n\nScott then moved to Naples, Florida, and founded Richard L. Scott Investments, a venture capital firm that is currently inactive.\n\nHe was elected the 45th Governor of Florida in 2010 and again in 2014, having spent $150 million on the two gubernatorial campaigns. For highlights of his years as governor, see Wikipedia. Barred by term limits from seeking reelection in 2018, he ran for and was elected to the U.S. Senate, spending $64 million on the campaign. He is now completing his first term.\n\nRick Scott and his wife, Ann, have been married for 52 years and have two daughters and one granddaughter.\n\nKey Issues\n\nScott’s campaign website includes a 12-point “Rescue America” plan. Its points are education; color-blind equality; safety and crime; immigration; growth/economy; government reform and debt; fair fraud-free elections; family; gender, life, science; religious liberty and Big Tech; America First; and cutting taxes.\n\nIn the News\n\nRick Scott Poised to Retain Senate Seat Amid Strong Polls and Fundraising Lead, The Capitolist, 7/23/24\n\nEconomists Debate Rick Scott’s Assertion the Federal Budget Should Be ‘Half Its Size’, Florida Phoenix, 7/22/24 (Note: NewsGuard rating 57/100: Proceed with Caution)\n\nScott and Mucarsel-Powell are raring for a fight. They’ll have to win primaries first, Miami Herald, 4/28/24\n\nUS Sen. Rick Scott Spends Multiple Millions on Ads Focused on Florida’s Hispanic Voters, APNews.com, 4/3/24\n\nFlorida Democrats See Scott’s Abortion Stance as Opening in Key Senate Race, Axios.com, 4/29/24\n\nEndorsements\n\nScott’s website lists endorsements from the Florida Chamber of Commerce, 100+ Florida State lawmakers, the Florida Republican Congressional Delegation, Florida Realtors, AIPAC, (former) President Donald J. Trump, and more.\n\nWebsites and Social Media"
