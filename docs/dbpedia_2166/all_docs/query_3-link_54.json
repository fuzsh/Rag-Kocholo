        "text": "What You Need to Know About Satellite Phones\n\nIt is important to compare satellite phones and other satellite equipment to ensure they match your critical personal communications needs. What do you need to be able to do with your satellite phone or device? Are you looking to make calls and send text messages? Do you need basic email access? Do you want to be able to use your smartphone or tablet for satellite voice or data access? Do you want to be able to send SOS alerts, track your location or make a quick call in case of emergency? Do you need to access the internet or broadcast capabilities?\n\nFind all the answers of these questions on this satellite phone guide\n\nTIP: Remember, a communications device is only as good as the coverage and reliability of the network behind it.\n\nHow are Satellite Phones Typically Used?\n\nSat phones are popular for expeditions into remote areas where terrestrial cell and data services are unreliable and unavailable. Satellite phones have been around for decades, but until the launch of the Iridium network, they were often only offered at an unaffordable price. Satellite phones can be a valuable back up to traditional cell phones because they operate independently of terrestrial communication or cell phone networks, which can be unreliable or non-existent in less populated regions or remote and can be vulnerable to natural or man-made disasters.\n\nUnlike cell phones, satellite phones require line-of-site with the sky to receive a signal for service. Don’t expect your satellite phone to ring in the lobby of your hotel or inside a stateroom while at sea. However, you might be able to receive a signal if you are by a large window or in an open, remote spot. Hardened structures, buildings, mountains, and heavy tree cover can all negatively affect your signal. Pilots often leave a satellite phone or an Iridium GO! on the dashboard of their plane’s cockpit to receive a signal.\n\nWhile voice calls to a satellite phone incur a significant international calling surcharge, texting is often treated much like texting on a cell phone. The cell phone subscriber with an international SMS feature can text to a satellite phone at about the same cost to say, texting a cell phone in Mexico or other international numbers. Inmarsat and Iridium satellite phones can send and receive text messages (SMS) or short emails, making satellite communication quick and easy. Globalstar phones can only receive messages up to 35 characters, but cannot reply.\n\nThe Inmarsat IsatPhone offers global satellite connectivity at an affordable price. In addition to voice and text, the IsatPhone also includes a built-in GPS receiver. While signal acquisition is somewhat slow due to the placement of the Inmarsat I-4 satellites and GPS acquisition, the call quality is reasonable. For the ultimate in satellite communications the Iridium Extreme is the most rugged, and full-featured satellite phone on the market today. Utilizing the Iridium network for unparalleled quality and coverage, this IP65 rated handset can be dropped into a puddle and still function for voice calling or sending your GPS coordinates via SMS or email.\n\nSatellite Phones and Internet Access\n\nMany satellite phones offer data services but few offer Internet access and most have very limited bandwidth. However, many popular online functions can be carried out with an added accessory to a standard phone.\n\nOther devices connect directly to a smartphone via built-in Wi-Fi. Note that browsing webpages is simply out of the question even for the most patient subscribers! A Wi-Fi enabled satellite device will offer limited Internet capabilities such as basic email, compressed photos, or tweets. The Iridium GO! satellite hotspot is the first portable satellite Wi-Fi hotspot that enables subscribers to call, text, email, all from their iOS or Android devices. Best of all it is the least expensive device to offer access to Iridium, the most reliable satellite network. Iridium GO! can connect up to 5 mobile devices providing satellite data, voice and text messaging services to anyone with a smartphone who happens to be off the grid and on the go!\n\nFor true Internet access with web browsing, a portable BGAN or IsatHub terminal are the mobile satellite internet solutions we recommend. Portable BGAN and IsatHub terminals like the Wideye ISavi utilize a passive antennae that must be stationary to receive a signal and transmit data. Even on a slow moving cruise ship you may have trouble maintaining a signal. Whereas satellite phones from Iridium and Globalstar can maintain a signal even while traveling in a car, train or plane.\n\nIf I buy multiple satellite phones can they share one SIM card?\n\nNo, if you want to be able to use each satellite phone, each will need its own SIM card. Much like an unlocked cell phone, a satellite SIM card can be moved to another compatible phone, but to be able to make calls, each satellite phone will need its own SIM card with an active monthly plan or prepaid airtime. Iridium offers a few prepaid airtime options from 75-600 global satellite minutes to fit within any price budget and provide reliable satellite coverage! If your Iridium Global Prepaid SIM card expires, your airtime will be removed from the card and you will have a 270 day refill window to purchase a refill. Outside of that 270 day window, you will need to purchase a new SIM card and also receive a new number at the time you activate the new card."
