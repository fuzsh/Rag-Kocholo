        "text": "The G. Gordon Godfrey Show is a current affairs opinion and interview program hosted by G. Gordon Godfrey, broadcast on GBS.[1] It was also available on Goode Goggles.[2] It is primarily conducted from a studio in New York City, but sometimes features on location reporting from G. Gordon himself,[3] or others.[1] The show's airtime has varied, but as of September 2020 it airs weeknights at 7pm Eastern.[4] Godfrey is in fact an associate of the Light and Darkseid and uses the show to support their ends.[5][6]\n\nHistory[]\n\n2016[]\n\nFollowing the discovery of Kroloteans impersonating humans, G. Gordon used his show to stoke fear of aliens. His show was also strongly critical of the Justice League; first angry at them for not acting,[1] later suspicious they had been able to act so quickly.[7] He strongly protested against the Earth-Mars Communications Satellite, and personally attended the launch press conference.[3]\n\nFollowing the arrival of the Reach, the show welcomed them, and used their public debut at the United Nations to criticize other aliens, including those on the League, for coming to Earth \"through the back door\".[8] Godfrey would go on to interview the Reach Ambassador several times, and the Reach soft drink would appear on his interview table.[9] Godfrey also praised the Reach's collaboration with \"noted philanthropist\" Lex Luthor at LexCorp Farms.[10]\n\nGodfrey continued his attacks against the League, especially after the existence of the Watchtower was exposed. He accused them of spying on the world, and also revealed they were using covert operatives.[10]\n\nGodfrey turned against the Reach following the invasion by the Warworld, noting that the Reach deployed a fleet of warships from the ocean against it despite having earlier claimed to have only a single unarmed vessel.[9] Following the exposure of the Reach's invasion plans, Godfrey led a protest against them outside the United Nations.[11] He used the show to lead calls for the resignation of UN Secretary-General Tseng Dangun, and called for Luthor to succeed him,[5] which he did.[12]\n\n2018-2019[]\n\nOn July 29, 2018, Godfrey interviewed Baron DeLamb in the wake of the murder of Markovia's king and queen, supporting the moves to martial law and \"vetting\" meta-humans.[12]\n\nThe program took a strongly anti-meta stance, and criticized Gretchen Goode and Bruce Wayne for funding the Meta-Human Youth Center.[13] Godfrey interviewed Goode again after the revelation that her company's Goode Goggles were part of a meta-trafficking scheme. Goode was able to use the appearance to launder her reputation.[14]\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Lex Luthor was a regular guest on the show, where he was given the opportunity to air his grievances with the Justice League,[14] in what were essentially scripted promo pieces. The show was not above criticizing Luthor though, and did not pull its punches when Luthor incorrectly accused the Outsiders of going against their parents' wishes and calling for an unpopular meta-human and vigilante registry. Off camera, G. Gordon revealed he wanted to wake Luthor up to the fact his strategy of attacking the Outsiders was not working.[6]\n\n2020[]\n\nThe show continued airing in 2020, on weeknights at 7PM Eastern, and was advertised in Planet Circle.[4]\n\nPersonnel[]\n\nG. Gordon Godfrey - host[1]\n\nCat Grant - reporter[1]\n\nKaren Conlin - production assistant[9]\n\nAppearances[]"
