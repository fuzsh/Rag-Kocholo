        "text": "The unmissable final episode of Frozen Planet II presented Sir David Attenborough more overtly than ever before as, in essence, God. Or at least a mighty prophet. There he sat in a director’s chair while on a huge screen the animals paraded before him. If not quite their creator, here was their primary protector. To state the utterly obvious, he is irreplaceable.\n\nBut at 96, replaced he must one day be. Unlike another recently concluded reign, there is no succession. Candidates have been trialled for years, narrating away in their Rada voices. But always it feels like being forced to watch the matinee understudy. So A Year on Planet Earth (ITVX), thinking inside the box, has gone for another national treasure, and a brainy polymath to boot.\n\nThere on a northerly glacier, tall and grizzled and brandishing a staff (or perhaps it was a walking pole) stood Stephen Fry pointing at the Sun and explaining “how where you are on Earth makes a world of difference”.\n\nThis six-part story of the seasons has gobsmacking camerawork harvested in 60 corners of the planet. As a magnificent rifle bird plumps its plumage to seduce a mate, or the Costa’s hummingbird flaring its head into the shape of a purple star, it’s good to see the natural world is still taking its steroids and hallucinogens.\n\nAs a whistle-stop globe-trotting primer for younger viewers, the series does everything necessary – although it mainly keeps quiet about climate change. But to this seasoned Grinch, there was quite a bit of déjà-vu on display. The polar bears and king penguins, and that Arctic fox nosediving through snow to catch winter prey, have only just finished performing in Frozen Planet II.\n\nMaybe the eternal cycle of life also applies to natural history programming: elephant calves will always be taking their fun first bath, and a film crew will always be there to record it. Fry is in full anthropomorphic mode. In this avuncular telling, every mother is a mum, while the natural world takes on the bathetic measurements of the domesticated human: we meet a leatherback turtle as big as a two-seat sofa, cheetahs accelerating faster “than most sports cars” and, believe it or not, a giant petrel “the size of a Christmas turkey”. Well, it is that time of year."
