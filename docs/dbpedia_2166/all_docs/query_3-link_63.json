        "meta_description": "2021 was a stand-out year for climate coverage on corporate broadcast TV networks. In our annual analysis of climate coverage, Media Matters found that approximately 1,316 minutes — nearly 22 hours — were spent discussing climate change on morning, evening, and Sunday morning news shows on ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox Broadcasting Co., more than a threefold increase from 2020. However, all those hours of climate coverage on corporate broadcast TV networks represented roughly 1% of overall news programming in 2021, a figure that is still far too small in the face of a worsening climate crisis. The increase in coverage was largely driven by various Biden administration climate initiatives; another year of deadly climate-fueled extreme weather events across the globe; and the pivotal 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which was held in Glasgow, Scotland, over a two-week period in November. This rise in the quantity of coverage — after years of advocacy by climate journalists, activists and researchers pushing for more and better climate coverage by TV news — was supported by new and renewed commitments from corporate broadcast networks to cover climate through collaborative initiatives like Covering Climate Now and dedicated reporting during key climate events. However, some problematic trends continued to materialize in the quality of corporate broadcast news coverage of climate change, including, for at least the fifth year in a row, an overwhelming proportion of white men featured as guests in climate coverage, even though people of color are most impacted by the crisis. And while broadcast networks did a decent job of covering key moments and events in 2021 overall, their climate coverage throughout the year was uneven.",

        "text": "Approximately 154 guests (81%) in broadcast evening news’ climate segments in 2021 were white people, while only 35 (19%) were people of color. Additionally, 143 guests (76%) were men, while only 46 guests (24%) were women. Of those 143 men, 121 were white, meaning that 64% of all named guests in 2021 nightly news climate segments were white men. Thirty-three out of the 46 women guests were white, accounting for 17% of all guests in climate coverage.\n\nThis is similar to the make-up of nightly news guests in 2020, when white men made up 75% of all guests compared to only five people of color, representing just 7% of the nightly news guest count.\n\nAmong the people of color who appeared in climate segments on broadcast evening news in 2021, Hispanic or Latino guests were the most featured, appearing 19 times. There were also eight Black guests, three Native American guests, three South Asian guests, one Middle Eastern guest, and Pacific Islander guest. Only four Black women appeared as guests on evening news climate segments in 2021. NBC Nightly News featured two women of color — climate scientist Melissa Burt on the January 27 edition, and Alicia Knapp of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables on the September 23 edition. CBS Evening News and ABC’s World News Tonight each featured just one woman of color — entomologist Jessica Ware on the May 2 edition of CBS Evening News, and a Madagascar governmental official (whose name was not aired) detailing the climate-fueled famine in that country in the World News Tonight segment on November 1.\n\nCBS Evening News featured the most guests in nightly news climate segments in 2021, with 80, and 17 were people of color (21%). NBC Nightly News featured 68 guests, with just 10 being people of color (15%). The evening programs on CBS and NBC each featured just 19 total women climate guests, or 24% and 28%, respectively. ABC’s World News Tonight featured 41 total climate guests, with just eight people of color and only eight women appearing to speak on issues related to the climate crisis.\n\nCompared to its corporate broadcast counterparts, PBS NewsHour did not fare better. Out of a total of 136 guests in its 2021 climate segments, 89 were men (65%), while just 47 were women (35%). A whopping 112 of these 136 guests were white (82%), while just 23 were people of color (17%). Notably, 75 of PBS NewsHour’s climate guests (55%) were white men, while only nine were women of color (7%). Two of these nine were Black women: White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse, who appeared in a March 15 segment on the American Rescue Plan, and the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice’s Catherine Coleman Flowers, who appeared in a July 7 segment on environmental justice. Other notable segments with people of color included live interviews with EPA Administrator Michael Regan on April 21; Couchiching First Nation attorney Tara Houska on June 7; and COP26 President Alok Sharma on June 21.\n\nMorning news shows on broadcast TV networks in 2021 interviewed 292 total guests in segments on climate change. One hundred eighty-eight of these guests (64%) were men, while 103 of these guests (35%) were women. (One climate segment on Today featured an appearance by Kermit the Frog, who was counted among the total guests but not categorized for demographic purposes.) Two hundred thirty-nine of the 292 guests were white — 82% of the overall guest count. Only 52 guests were people of color, making up just 17% of total guests. One hundred sixty out of the 292 guests were white men, accounting for 55% of all guests in climate segments. Only 24 were women of color, representing just 8% of guests overall.\n\nIn 2020, by comparison, broadcast morning news show climate segments featured a total of 145 guests: 107 (74%) were men, while just 38 (26%) were women; 135 guests were white (93%), while just 10 were people of color (7%). In total, 103 out of 145 morning show climate guests in 2020 (71%) were white men, making for a slight improvement in this still-disproportionate representation in 2021.\n\nGuests on Sunday morning political show climate segments in 2021 also once again skewed male and white. Thirty-nine of the 53 guests were male (74%), while just 14 guests were women (26%). Forty-four guests were white (83%), while just nine were people of color (17%). Notably, 33 guests were white men (62%), while only three guests were women of color: Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Cecilia Rouse on the April 4 edition of Face the Nation; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on the June 27 edition of Meet the Press; and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Christiana Figueres on the October 31 edition of Face the Nation.\n\nCorporate broadcast news is finally more consistently characterizing extreme weather as climate events while covering the myriad ways the crisis is impacting communities across the globe. As a result, coverage in 2021 included more guests who represent those communities or are responding to the ravages of climate change. For the first time in Media Matters’ series of annual studies, 107 guests — 20% of total guests — across nightly, morning, and Sunday morning political news shows in 2021 were categorized as members of a frontline community, impacted community, or first responders.\n\nNightly news’ climate segments in 2021 featured 22 guests who were categorized as frontline community members, which Media Matters defined as someone who lives in a community that is situated in proximity to fossil fuel infrastructure or uniquely affected by ongoing climate impacts on their health, livelihood or local economy. The majority of these guests (13) were people of color, which accurately represents the disproportionate climate impacts that these communities face. For example, impacted Guatemalans were guests in four climate segments about increasing heat waves, droughts, and stronger hurricanes leading to more climate migration — one on the April 7 edition of CBS Evening News; two on the April 10 edition of CBS Evening News; three on the April 22 edition of World News Tonight; and two on the September 21 edition of NBC Nightly News. Three members of the Native American Quileute tribe were also interviewed on the November 4 edition of CBS Evening News about rising seas and flooding threatening their traditional homeland in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAdditionally, 31 guests were identified as impacted community members, which Media Matters defined as people who are impacted by a single climate event or ongoing climate impacts which have affected their livelihood or caused destruction to their home or local infrastructure or economy. Nineteen guests were state or local officials speaking about efforts to respond to climate-fueled events, and nine were first responders to extreme weather events.\n\nMorning news shows featured 12 guests who were part of a frontline community during climate segments in 2021. The majority of these 12 were white men. They appeared in segments discussing climate impacts on lobsters making it more difficult for fishermen to make a living (the April 17 edition of Today); homeowners suffering due to rising waters in the Great Lakes (the April 22 edition of Good Morning America); and several farmers in the western U.S. who are affected by the ongoing drought (the June 7 and 11 editions of CBS Mornings, and the June 10 edition of Today). Only four people of color were represented: two members of the Quileute tribe (the November 16 episode of CBS Mornings); a Guatemalan farmer struggling to make a living due to the increased intensity of drought, heat, and hurricanes (the April 8 edition of CBS Mornings); and a Maldives resident affected by rising sea levels (the November 3 edition of Good Morning America).\n\nTwenty-nine impacted community members appeared as guests in morning show climate segments. The majority of these guests appeared in segments on various 2021 extreme weather events. Two appeared at the end of the year, in reporting on climate’s potential impact on the deadly midwestern tornadoes in Kentucky (the December 19 edition of Today). Only two first responders appeared as morning show climate guests, both on CBS Mornings in wildfire segments — a battalion chief fighting California’s Dixie Fire on August 6, and a Cal Fire member fighting the state’s Caldor Fire on August 31.\n\nBroadcast TV’s Sunday morning shows featured no impacted community members or first responders as climate guests in 2021. They did include two frontline community members — Maui, Hawaii, residents Filemon Sadang and John Seebert during the October 31 edition of This Week. The segment dealt with how Maui is planning to address rising sea levels and flooding.\n\nScientists were well-represented in climate coverage in 2021 across morning and nightly news and Sunday political shows\n\nNightly news shows’ climate segments in 2021 featured 42 guests who were scientists. This represented 22% of the 189 overall guests — a sizable increase from 2020, when just 11% of guests were scientists.\n\nImportantly, 23 of those 42 guests were climate scientists. In fact, climate scientists were the most-represented profession on nightly news climate segments in 2021. NBC Nightly News featured the highest proportion of climate scientists as guests, with 12, while CBS Evening News featured seven, and four climate scientists appeared on ABC’s World News Tonight.\n\nNASA climate scientist Josh Willis appeared three times (the June 17, July 12, and July 13 edition of NBC Nightly News), Penn State University climate scientist Michael Mann appeared twice (the October 27 and December 16 editions of NBC Nightly News), and Guatemalan climate scientist Edwin Castellanos also appeared twice (the April 7 and April 10 editions of CBS Evening News). Only three climate scientist guests on evening news shows in 2021 were women — Melissa Burt on the January 27 edition of NBC Nightly News, Joanne Kerbavaz of California State Parks on the February 21 edition of CBS Evening News, and NASA scientist Kerry Cawse-Nicholson on the July 21 edition of NBC Nightly News.\n\nAdditionally, approximately 13 non-scientist guests in 2021’s evening news climate segments were categorized as experts in their particular fields, based on our definitions. These included academics, researchers, local meteorologists, and former government officials in scientific agencies. Media Matters began tracking appearances by experts in 2021, categorizing their various fields to demonstrate that climate change is a multidimensional issue that touches many disciplines.\n\nMorning news shows’ climate segments in 2021 featured 57 guests out of 292 total (20%) who we classified as scientists. Of these 57 guests, 22 were climate scientists. This is similar to 2020, when 29 scientists (including 15 climate scientists) appeared as guests in broadcast morning news climate segments, again representing just 20% of overall guests.\n\nSeveral climate scientists in 2021 appeared in more than one morning show segment as guests. These included Daniel Swain of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA (the June 20 edition of Today and the September 2 edition of Good Morning America); Carlos Duarte, an aquatic ecologist at King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia (the August 27 and 28 editions of Good Morning America); and Katharine Hayhoe, professor at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, who has been called \"perhaps the best communicator on climate change” (the June 17 edition of Today and the October 5 edition of CBS Mornings).\n\nThere was only one woman of color among climate scientists featured as guests in morning news segments in 2021: Dr. Lola Fatoyinbo of NASA on the April 15 edition of Today. In total, there were only five women of color who appeared as scientists in morning show climate coverage (including Dr. Fatoyinbo).\n\nAdditionally, we categorized 40 morning show climate guests as experts in this year’s study.\n\n2021 was only the second time in six years that a climate scientist was featured as a guest in a Sunday show climate segment. In fact, the Sunday morning political shows featured two climate scientists as guests in 2021: Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and Kristina Dahl of the Union of Concerned Scientists on the August 8 edition of ABC’s This Week, in a segment focused on climate change, global wildfires, and how to combat the crisis. The only other scientist in a Sunday show climate segment in 2021 was Dr. Anthony Fauci, who appeared on the March 14 edition of Meet the Press.\n\nPoliticians lost a sizable share of guest representation from 2020 to 2021\n\nIn 2020, politicians were the most represented group of guests featured in climate segments. Seventy-seven politicians appeared across climate segments on the nightly news, morning news and Sunday morning political shows — accounting for 33% of all guests. In 2021, only 34 politicians were featured in climate segments, making up just 6% of guests. Of these, left-leaning politicians appeared more than two times as much as right-leaning politicians — 24 and 10, respectively. Politicians have thus lost a sizable share of guest representation from 2020 to 2021.\n\nNightly news shows featured nine politicians as guests in climate segments, and eight were classified as left-leaning. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom appeared the most frequently, at three times — on the July 28 edition of CBS Evening News, the August 25 edition of World News Tonight, and the September 1 edition of NBC Nightly News. The only right-leaning politician to appear in an evening news climate segment was Republican Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who discussed the western drought on the June 11 edition of CBS Evening News.\n\nIn addition to politicians, federal administration officials appeared in eight climate segments on nightly news shows in 2021. U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry was the most featured federal administration official — he appeared four times throughout the year (the January 27, November 12, and November 13 editions of CBS Evening News, and the January 27 edition of World News Tonight). White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy (March 21 edition of CBS Evening News), EPA Administrator Michael Regan (August 5 edition of CBS Evening News), Interior Secretary Deb Haaland (April 1 edition of CBS Evening News), and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (September 7 edition of CBS Evening News) rounded out the federal administration appearances.\n\nMorning news shows featured 10 politicians as guests in climate segments in 2021; eight were left-leaning and two were right-leaning. Both Newsom and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy appeared twice — Murphy discussed Hurricane Ida on the September 2 edition of Good Morning America and the September 3 episode of Today, while Newsom spoke of wildfires on the September 2 edition of Today and the September 13 edition of Good Morning America. The two right-leaning politicians were Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who discussed rising sea levels on the May 27 edition of CBS Mornings, and Utah’s Cox, who discussed drought on the June 10 edition of Today.\n\nIn addition to politicians, federal administration officials appeared in 13 segments. Kerry was also the most featured guest on morning TV news, appearing four times on CBS Mornings (February 19, July 27, November 6, and November 13) and once on ABC’s Good Morning America (September 28). McCarthy was featured in three climate segments — twice on NBC’s Today (January 27 and February 20), and once on CBS Mornings (November 2).\n\nThe vast majority of guests on Sunday morning political shows in 2021 were politicians (15) or federal officials (14). Eight of those politicians were classified as left-leaning, while seven were classified as right-leaning. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) each appeared across two different segments; Cassidy on the January 31 edition of Fox News Sunday and the February 7 edition of Meet the Press, and Khanna on the October 24 edition of Fox News Sunday and the October 31 edition of Face the Nation. Among federal officials, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg appeared across three different segments (the August 8 edition of Fox News Sunday, the October 17 edition of Meet the Press, and the October 31 edition of This Week). McCarthy discussed the April Global Climate Summit and climate solutions with ABC meteorologist Ginger Zee on the April 25 edition of This Week, while Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm discussed her department’s climate initiatives on the June 6 edition of Meet the Press.\n\nClimate activists and advocates were not as prominently featured in climate coverage during 2021 as they’ve been in the past\n\nNightly news programs featured 18 climate advocates, which we defined as those who lead climate efforts as part of a nongovernmental organization, and only three climate activists in 2021. Only one of the three activists represented the youth climate movement — Luisa Neubauer of Germany, who discussed flooding that ravaged parts of Western Europe in a July segment on NBC Nightly News. In comparison, climate activism was a huge driver of broadcast TV climate coverage in 2019, when activists made up 16% of overall climate coverage on nightly news and Sunday morning shows and Greta Thunberg appeared in nine climate segments.\n\nClimate activists appeared 15 times in morning TV news climate segments in 2021. Notable guests included Thunberg, who appeared twice, including in a live interview on the October 12 edition of NBC’s Today; Julianna Bradley and Georgia Wright, who conducted an Earth Day interview on the April 22 edition of CBS Mornings; Liza Goldberg on the April 15 edition of Today; and Alexandria Villaseñor on the April 26 edition of Today.\n\nNotably, alongside the previously mentioned frontline community members, two activists appeared as guests on Sunday morning political shows during the October 31 edition of This Week. The segment discussed rising sea levels affecting Maui, Hawaii.\n\nThe three major drivers of climate coverage on corporate broadcast TV news in 2021 were global extreme weather events, which primarily occurred during the summer months; various climate initiatives put forth by President Biden; and the COP26 meeting in November.\n\nExtreme Weather\n\nSummer 2021 was full of global extreme weather events that were costly, deadly, and intensified by climate change. The United States had the hottest June on record and the most extreme heat wave in history, with record-breaking and deadly temperatures hitting the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, Canada, in June, followed by the hottest month ever recorded on Earth in July. In Western Europe, severe rainfall led to catastrophic flooding that caused hundreds of deaths in Germany and Belgium, becoming the costliest weather event in European history. In China, extreme weather produced a year’s worth of rain over the course of a few days in the city of Zhengzhou, affecting more than 3 million people. In late August and early September, warmer than usual ocean water helped Hurricane Ida rapidly intensify from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm as it became one of the most intense tropical storms in the U.S. on record, leaving devastation along the Gulf Coast and triggering record rainfall and flooding across the Northeast.\n\nThe longstanding drought in the western U.S. — the worst in 1,200 years — was further intensified by the summer’s extreme heat conditions, and both were key factors in producing extremely intense wildfires, which burned 7.7 million acres in all of 2021. In August, California’s Dixie Fire became the largest single fire in state history. Wildfires also hit much of the Mediterranean region that month, no doubt exacerbated by the hottest summer in European history.\n\nNotably, after years of largely failing to link extreme weather and climate change, corporate broadcast TV news has finally started to more consistently acknowledge these connections, increasingly discussing climate change when reporting on these weather events. In fact, coverage of extreme weather events represented 35% of combined broadcast nightly and morning news climate segments in 2021.\n\nNightly news shows aired 90 segments that featured discussion of extreme weather events, making up nearly half of the 181 nightly news climate segments last year. Sixty of these 90 segments came during reporting on summer extreme weather. In total, NBC Nightly News ran 40 extreme weather segments, constituting 68% of its 59 overall climate segments. ABC’s World News Tonight ran 26 extreme weather segments, which constituted 46% of its 57 overall climate segments. CBS Evening News ran 24 extreme weather segments, which constituted 37% of its 65 overall climate segments.\n\nClimate mentions within reporting on summer extreme weather events were generally centered on stories from the U.S. Wildfires in California and other western states were the most-mentioned extreme weather event in climate segments on broadcast nightly news in 2021, occurring 23 times. This was followed by U.S. heat waves, which were mentioned 19 times. The western megadrought was mentioned 14 times, and Hurricane Ida was mentioned eight times. Summer flooding mentions, which included Chinese, European, and global stories, occurred eight times. European wildfires were mentioned three times, while the European heat wave was mentioned once.\n\nBesides the summer extreme weather events, the extreme cold that hit Texas in February was mentioned seven times on evening news last year. The Madagascar drought was mentioned three times (all on ABC’s World News Tonight), while December’s Midwestern tornadoes and a worsening Central American drought were mentioned twice each.\n\nMorning news shows aired 123 segments in 2021 which featured discussion of extreme weather events, representing 34% of their 363 overall climate segments. This included 84 segments that dealt with various extreme weather events that occurred primarily during the summer months, including U.S. and European wildfires, U.S. heat waves, global flooding, hurricanes, and the western U.S. drought.\n\nCBS Mornings covered these events in 31 climate segments. ABC’s Good Morning America mentioned these events in 30 climate segments, while NBC’s Today covered these in 26 climate segments. Summer U.S. heat waves were the most-mentioned extreme weather event, occurring 29 times, and 13 of these mentions dealt specifically with the Pacific Northwest heat wave. Wildfires in California and other western states were mentioned 22 times. Hurricane Ida was mentioned 20 times, while the western U.S. drought was mentioned 15 times.\n\nOther major extreme weather events covered by broadcast morning news shows last year included the extreme cold in Texas, the March and December tornados that ravaged parts of the U.S. Midwest, the Madagascar drought, and Tropical Storm Henri.\n\nSunday morning political shows aired 13 segments that featured discussion of extreme weather, an improvement over years prior when the shows rarely discussed the issue. The most frequently discussed extreme weather events on the Sunday shows in 2021 were the western U.S. drought, which was mentioned four times, followed by western U.S. wildfires and global extreme weather, which were mentioned three times each.\n\nPresident Biden’s climate agenda\n\nClimate action was a key pillar of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign in 2020. As a candidate, his platform included a $2 trillion spending plan that aimed to achieve net zero emissions for the U.S. by 2050 and pledges to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and ban fracking on federal lands.\n\nSince taking office in January 2021, President Biden has announced numerous climate initiatives that have garnered coverage by TV news shows. Some of the major moments included signing a slate of climate executive orders on January 27; hosting a two-day virtual climate summit in April that was attended by 40 world leaders; pursuing his Build Back Better agenda during the summer and fall with the introduction of two major packages, the infrastructure bill and the reconciliation budget bill, both containing massive climate spending; and attending COP26 in November with many members of his cabinet.\n\nPresidential climate actions or statements have played a key role in previous iterations of Media Matters’ annual broadcast study; for example, then-President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord was a big talking point in 2017, while climate change’s role in the presidential election was a major driver of climate coverage in the 2020 study.\n\nNightly news shows aired 35 segments in 2021 that included a discussion of the various climate initiatives and actions undertaken by the Biden administration, or 19% of their total climate segments. CBS Evening News referenced Biden climate actions in 13 segments, while ABC’s World News Tonight and NBC Nightly News referenced Biden climate actions in 11 segments each.\n\nOverall, climate components of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda represented by the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget reconciliation bill were mentioned 17 times on broadcast nightly news last year; there were also five mentions of the global climate summit in April, followed by three mentions each of both his January climate executive orders and the administration’s decision to rejoin the Paris climate agreement.\n\nMorning news shows aired 56 segments that covered the various climate initiatives put forth by the Biden administration this past year — accounting for 15% of overall climate coverage. Mentions of either the bipartisan infrastructure bill or Biden’s Build Back Back agenda occurred 26 times. Biden’s Global Climate Summit on Earth Day was mentioned 10 times, while his decision to rejoin the Paris climate accord was mentioned eight times (on the flip side, Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement was mentioned seven times).\n\nCBS aired 25 morning show segments on Biden’s climate initiatives; it was also the only network to mention the administration’s electric vehicle sales goal. NBC aired 22 morning segments on Biden’s climate initiatives; it was the only network to mention how the Biden administration is making climate change a national security priority. ABC aired nine segments that discussed Biden administration climate initiatives; it was also the only network to mention Biden’s offshore wind expansion plan.\n\nSunday morning political shows dedicated 27 of their 60 climate segments last year (45%) to discussing Biden’s climate actions. The infrastructure bill and the president’s Build Back Better agenda were the main drivers of the Sunday shows’ climate coverage, accounting for 19 of the 27 segments. Biden’s executive orders on climate change in January as well as his decision to rejoin the Paris climate accord were also featured in these segments.\n\nBut while some coverage was dedicated to Biden’s seminal climate spending in both the infrastructure bill and the reconciliation budget bill, morning and evening news shows missed numerous chances to connect these spending packages to climate stories.\n\nA total of 43 climate segments on corporate broadcast TV news shows in 2021 — 26 on morning news and 17 on evening news – featured a mention or discussion of the climate elements of either Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill or his Build Back Better agenda. However, there were vastly more times where climate was mentioned but glossed over in segments on this legislation. Climate change was just a passing mention — meaning it was referenced along with a litany of other items and never expanded upon in the segment — in at least 104 of these segments. Morning and evening news shows thus missed ample opportunities to explain why the climate elements of his agenda are extremely important, and maybe the last chance to pass meaningful climate legislation in the near future.\n\nInclusions of the infrastructure bill or Build Back Better in climate segments were generally brief. Many of these mentions came in segments about COP26 in November discussing Biden’s arrival and plans at COP26, along with his agenda back home.\n\nIt wasn’t just coverage of the president’s Build Back Better agenda that missed opportunities for substantive climate discussion — climate change was a passing mention in 27 segments on the G7 meetings in June. None of these G7 segments discussed climate in depth, despite the important climate news to come out of these meetings. For example, G7 leaders pledged to give $100 billion yearly to poorer nations to help them adapt to climate change. The countries also committed to keeping alive the goal of limiting global warming to less than 1.5 C. Viewers of these segments that glossed over these commitments thus came away from the G7 segments with zero understanding of the importance of climate to these meetings.\n\nCOP26\n\nThe 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which took place in Glasgow, Scotland, over a two-week period in November, was another key driver of climate coverage for broadcast TV news shows in 2021. The most important world climate gathering to date, the conference was billed as the “last best chance” to achieve the goals of the Paris climate accord.\n\nNightly news shows aired 24 segments — 13% of their 181 total climate segments in 2021 — that centered on the global climate conference. ABC’s World News Tonight ran nine such segments on COP26; CBS Evening News ran eight segments, and NBC Nightly News ran seven.\n\nMorning news shows discussed COP26 in a combined 40 climate segments, constituting 11% of overall morning news climate coverage. ABC referenced the conference in 12 segments, CBS in 11 segments, and NBC in 16 segments.\n\nSunday morning political shows discussed COP26 in seven segments. NBC’s Meet the Press referenced it three times, followed by CBS’ Face the Nation, which referenced it twice. Both ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos and Fox News Sunday referenced it once.\n\nPBS NewsHour’s climate segments in 2021 were similar to its corporate broadcast counterparts in terms of what drove coverage. Both Biden administration climate actions and extreme weather were discussed the most, referenced across 45 of the show's 151 total climate segments last year. The infrastructure bill and Biden’s Build Back Better agenda were mentioned in 16 segments. Hurricane Ida was the most-mentioned extreme weather event on the show, referenced in nine climate segments. However, COP26 wasn’t as big of a driver of coverage compared to nightly news shows on ABC, CBS, or NBC, mentioned in just 12 segments.\n\nOther notable drivers\n\nOther notable drivers of climate coverage on broadcast news in 2021 included climate impacts and climate solutions. Impacts were mostly discussed within the context of climate change influencing certain types of extreme weather events, including drought, heat waves, hurricanes, and wildfires. Many mentions of climate solutions came within the context of Biden’s climate initiatives or COP26, including mentions where shows framed climate action as a way to create jobs in the already growing clean energy sector or generally touted the economic benefits of clean energy.\n\nIn 2020, clean energy jobs or the economic benefits of clean energy were mentioned only four times. In 2021, this number shot up, with clean energy jobs or economic benefits referenced in varying capacities 26 times within solutions segments on morning and nightly news shows.\n\nNightly news discussed climate’s impact on public health in 15 segments; its impacts on marine life as well as agriculture and food were each mentioned in 10 segments. Its impact on melting ice was mentioned in nine segments, while the economic impact of climate change was mentioned in seven segments. Other impact mentions included two on winemaking, and one each on the cicada emergence, the Great Barrier Reef, and Florida’s red tides.\n\nNotable solutions included six segments on electric transportation and four on the need to harden or modernize the electric grid.\n\nMorning news discussed climate change’s impacts on melting ice 21 times, and sea level rise 20 times. Impacts on marine life were mentioned 16 times, impacts on food and agriculture were mentioned 15 times, and impacts on public health were mentioned 10 times. Unique impact mentions included two on coastal erosion, two on alcoholic beverages, one on mental health (climate anxiety), and one on a shift in the Earth's axis. Additionally, there were three mentions on how climate change is a national security issue. Wars, like the one in Ukraine now, worsen the global climate crisis, and it’s important to make that point in TV news coverage of climate.\n\nNotable solutions coverage on morning shows in 2021 included 10 mentions on electrifying transportation, four on wind energy (both onshore and offshore), and two specific to investing in green infrastructure, the need to reduce methane emissions, and consuming plant-based products.\n\nImpacts not related to extreme weather events and solutions did not play as big of a role in driving climate coverage on Sunday shows as they did on morning and evening shows. The economic impact of climate change and sea-level rise were mentioned four times each, while climate’s impact on making viruses worse was mentioned once. For solutions, clean energy was mentioned seven times, electric vehicles three times, and suing fossil fuel companies was mentioned once."
