        "text": "The early experiments did not produce a viable colour system but, undeterred, Baird continued his research in the late 1930s by financing it from his own personal savings—including cashing in his life insurance policy.\n\nDespite the Second World War temporarily ending the BBC television service, Baird demonstrated an improved colour television in 1940. With images made of 600 lines, the quality was far greater than the black-and-white pre-war television service that would return in 1946.\n\nOn 16 August 1944 Baird gave the world’s first demonstration of a fully integrated electronic colour picture tube, the Telechrome. Unlike previous camera tubes, this device had two sensor guns which scanned the image, which not only created colour pictures, but also produced images in 3D. Far ahead of its time, only one example remains, which is now in our collection.\n\nIn his experiments with broadcasting images, Baird used wax dummy heads as the heat from the studio lights was too intense for live performers. One of these heads, known as ‘Eustace’, was used in colour trials and is also now part of our collection.\n\nBaird’s untimely death in 1946 marked the end for this route of pioneering colour research.\n\nThe arrival of colour also saw a new name enter living rooms around the UK: Sony’s Trinitron television receiver, first launched in the UK in 1969. It introduced a new technology for displaying colour images. Rather than using the ‘shadow mask’—which needed three electron guns shooting colour signals at related phospors in the internal screen coating—it used a single gun with three cathodes fired at an aperture grill of fine wires.\n\nThe Trintron’s flatter screen was brighter and clearer. The set was reliable and, crucially, could be mass-produced at an acceptable cost. It signalled the arrival of Japan as a world-class source of electronics and marked the decline of British television set manufacturing."
