        "text": "Who's \"woman\" enough: The long history of sex testing in sports\n\nWhy are some female athletes asked to prove her womanhood? To understand how we got here, we're bringing you episode one of Tested, a new podcast series by our play cousins over at Embedded, made in partnership with CBC in Canada.\n\nWho's \"woman\" enough: The long history of sex testing in sports\n\nListen · 40:31 40:31\n\nThe beauty and entitlement of traveling as a tourist\n\nSummer is a time when many Americans are taking off from work and setting their sights on far-off vacation destinations: tropical beaches, fairy-tale cities, sun-drenched countrysides. But in her book Airplane Mode, the reluctant travel writer Shahnaz Habib warns of recklessly embracing what she calls \"passport privilege,\" — and how that can skew peoples' images of what the world is and who it belongs to.\n\nThe beauty and entitlement of traveling as a tourist\n\nListen · 32:33 32:33\n\n'Not a badge of honor': how book bans affect Indigenous literature\n\nFor some authors, finding their book on a \"banned\" list can feel almost like an accolade, putting them right there with classics like The Bluest Eye and To Kill a Mockingbird. But the reality is, most banned books never get the kind of recognition or readership that the most famous ones do.\n\n'Not a badge of honor': how book bans affect Indigenous literature\n\nListen · 34:17 34:17\n\nKamala Harris, Revisited\n\nWith Kamala Harris entering the presidential race, we look back at what has shaped her personally and politically —from being the self-described \"top cop\" of California, to taking on a former president with dozens of felony convictions.\n\nKamala Harris, Revisited\n\nListen · 40:52 40:52\n\nThe return of the U.S.'s oldest drag king\n\nFor decades now, drag queens have captured the national imagination. Drag kings, on the other hand, have been relegated to a less prominent position in pop culture. But today on the show, we're telling the story of one Elsie Saldaña — aka El Daña. As someone who started performing in drag in 1965, she's now considered one of the oldest drag kings still performing in the U.S. Over the course of her long performance career, many forces have converged that could have stopped her from taking to the stage. But today, almost 60 years after her debut, she hasn't stopped yet.\n\nThe return of the U.S.'s oldest drag king\n\nListen · 31:03 31:03\n\nHonoring my enslaved ancestors: Episode 2\n\nEvery summer B.A. Parker returns to Creswell, North Carolina, where her family still has a farm. But she's mostly avoided actually going to the nearby site where her ancestors were enslaved. This week, we revisit the second of two episodes, where Parker and her mom decide to go back to the plantation.\n\nHonoring my enslaved ancestors: Episode 2\n\nListen · 34:19 34:19\n\nHonoring my enslaved ancestors: Episode 1\n\nIn part one of two episodes, B.A. Parker meets people who, like her, are grappling with how to honor their enslaved ancestors. She asks herself: what kind of descendant does she want to be?\n\nHonoring my enslaved ancestors: Episode 1\n\nListen · 34:08 34:08\n\nHow one event in history can ripple through generations of a family\n\nThis week we're bringing you the first episode in a new series called Inheriting, created in collaboration with our friends at LAist Studios. In each episode, NPR's Emily Kwong sits down with Asian American and Pacific Islander families and explores how one event in history can ripple through generations.\n\nHow one event in history can ripple through generations of a family\n\nListen · 45:00 45:00\n\nThe truth and lies behind one of the most banned books in America\n\nAuthor Mike Curato wrote Flamer as a way to help young queer kids, like he once was, better understand and accept themselves. It was met with immediate praise and accolades — until it wasn't. When the book got caught up in a wave of Texas-based book bans, suddenly the narrative changed. And like so many books that address queer identity, Flamer quickly became a flashpoint in a long, messy culture war that tried to distort the nature of the book.\n\nThe truth and lies behind one of the most banned books in America\n\nListen · 31:06 31:06\n\nSome freed people actually received '40 acres and a mule.' Then it got taken away.\n\nThe promise of \"40 acres and a mule\", is often thought of as a broken one. But it turns out, some freed people actually received land as reparations after the Civil War. And what happened to that land and the families it was given to is the subject of a new series, 40 Acres and a Lie, by our colleagues at Reveal and the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nSome freed people actually received '40 acres and a mule.' Then it got taken away.\n\nListen · 50:08 50:08"
