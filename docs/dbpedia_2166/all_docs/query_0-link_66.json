        "text": "SIR David Attenborough’s nature series are famed for showcasing epic clashes between predator and prey.\n\nWho could forget the nail-biting images of iguanas running the gauntlet of Galapagos racer snakes in 2016’s Planet Earth II?\n\nBut this Sunday’s episode of Frozen Planet II will deliver a battle between a chamois goat and a golden eagle which is just as stunning.\n\nAttendees at this summer’s Edinburgh TV Festival in Edinburgh were given a sneak peak of the scene by the BBC - and the audience of over 1,000 onlookers were left gasping, or just in stunned silence.\n\nViewers at home will be just as shocked as they watch the eagle attack the adolescent goats on the icy Alpine mountains in Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy.\n\nSir David is heard explaining how birds of prey find it hard to kill the large creatures outright because they’re big enough to fight back and so heavy they’re difficult to transport long distances.\n\nHe says: “A kill this size will feed a pair of eagles for days.” So they have to use their ingenuity rather than brute force to get a bumper meal.\n\nThe answer? One eagle flushes out the goat, the other grabs the creature which is FIVE TIMES their weight.\n\nThey then drag the goat into the air before they let them plunge to their deaths and feast leisurely on their carcasses at the foothills of the mountains.\n\nBut it's not without risk to the bird because, while grappling with the goat on the rocky mountainside, they could break a wing which would prove fatal.\n\nIt's the first time a successful killing of this sort has been captured on TV, though the phenomenon is known to naturalists and local people in Alpine countries.\n\nBut you can guarantee everyone will be talking about it on Monday morning.\n\nThis Sunday's show, which starts at 8pm on BBC1, is the latest in the new six-part series which looks at how nature flourishes in some of the world's iciest areas.\n\nThis third episode focuses specifically on wildlife that has adapted to deal with the freezing climates of mountains.\n\nAs well as the eagle and goat in Italy, it will feature a chameleon on Mount Kenya, a macaque monkey in Japan, parrots feeding on the dead in the Southern Alps of New Zealand and flamingos thriving in high altitude volcanic lakes.\n\nGREG: I CHEATED ON MY EX\n\nHE’S the nicest guy on radio, but Greg James says that hasn’t always been the case.\n\nThe BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show host has admitted that when he first became famous he cheated on an ex-girlfriend.\n\nHe told the Walking The Dog podcast: “There was a period of time where I was just not being a good enough person. I had a relationship that I was terrible in.\n\n“It was the greatest regret of my life. I was unfaithful and I hate myself for it. But it was because I was in a bad way.”\n\nGreg’s now one of the Beeb’s most bankable stars and is happily married to author Bella Mackie.\n\nHe added of his former self: “I don’t even like that person. I don’t ever want to go back to how that was.”\n\nJOHN MUM BATTLING DEMENTIA\n\nJOHN BISHOP has opened up about his heartbreak over his mum’s diagnosis with dementia.\n\nThe comic, whose mother Kathy in the early stages of the condition, said it had made him treasure the memories they have made together.\n\nHe told Clive Anderson on the My Seven Wonders podcast: “I see memories as a wonder as I think we define ourselves by memories.\n\n“I find that more interesting as my mum’s got dementia now so I value the memories I have and see memories disappearing and it’s heartbreaking.”\n\nJohn says he often shares loving photos with Kathy. He added: “What you find is the memories that they retain are not the ones you expect.\n\n“And it’s made me question things. If someone goes ‘Oh, remember when we were eight . . . ’ and you go ‘No’, part of you is thinking ‘If I don’t remember it, did that really happen?’ You start perceiving things differently.”\n\nTALKING EELS?\n\nIF ITV2 show Shopping With Keith Lemon was in fact a shop, it’d be B&M Bargains - because it’s stuffed with surprises.\n\nTonight, Keith’s out and about with Danny Dyer and they take a pitstop to tuck into a plate of jellied eels.\n\nDanny reckons the gloopy dome of fish “looks like a fake tit” and adds: “Imagine that, if you nicked a bird and you got her home and she got her tits out and they looked like that.”\n\nTalk turns to sex and the bawdy actor tells Keith: “When I first discovered my winkle it was down to Madonna.\n\n\"I remember seeing her and getting some sort of twitch in my loins. It was the best f*cking thing in the world.”\n\nAre we still talking about the eels? Shopping With Keith Lemon continues tonight at 10pm on ITV2.\n\nBE TRAY CAREFUL, MICAH\n\nENGLAND ace Micah Richards bends over and shows off his ball skills on tonight’s A League Of Their Own.\n\nAnd if that weren’t impressive enough, he does it while sporting a hat and carrying a tray full of pints.\n\nThe footballer turned pundit, now a team captain on the Sky Max comedy panel show, is challenged to a game of “Beer we go”, inspired by images of a Dutch fan carrying 48 drinks at a match.\n\nIn this version, the glasses are piled high and audience members throw balls at them.\n\nMicah is up against former France international footballer Patrice Evra, who seems to spill far less.\n\nAnd they say the French can’t hold their drink."
