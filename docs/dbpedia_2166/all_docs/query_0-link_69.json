        "text": "It has been more than a decade since the first series of Sir David Attenborough’s Frozen Planet aired, and in that time, it is the coldest places on earth that have been most affected by the planet warming up. It is inevitable and appropriate that the spectre of the climate crisis looms large over the new six-part series, which extends its scope beyond Antarctica and the Arctic to take in the world’s icy peaks, snowy deserts and frosted forests.\n\nBut as always with Sir David, the foreboding warnings pack their punch by engaging viewers with the animal world like no other nature programming is able to match. Sumptuous camera work, breathtaking scenery, and absorbing storytelling work together to illuminate miraculous life that survives every day, against the odds, in the harshest possible of environments.\n\nIt is by informing, educating and wowing viewers that Sir David and the tireless teams behind these shows aim to make us care about a world that human existence is damaging at an alarming rate.\n\nThe opening episode races around the globe, taking in past favourites – killer whales and polar bears – while introducing new stars like the Pallas’s cat and hooded seals. In Antarctica, in temperatures that drop to minus 80°C, we are greeted by the familiar sight of regal emperor penguins huddled around their fuzzy young, shielding them from the 100mph winds and biting cold. In the spring, their work is abruptly complete and they totter away forever, leaving their offspring to go it alone.\n\nThe ensuing waddle of this gang of teenagers to the sea is the perfect Attenborough segment: equal parts adorable, adventurous and perilous, ending with a gloriously inelegant mass belly flop into the sea.\n\nAlso in Antarctica is astonishing footage of the ruthlessly efficient hunting of Weddell seals by a pack of killer whales.\n\nFor all the narrow escapes that Attenborough narrates, the brutality of nature is never skimmed over.\n\nA palate cleanser comes in the form of the animal kingdom’s own Grumpy Cat, the small, grouchy-faced, stumpy-legged, dense-furred Pallas’s cat. A little Tom-and-Jerry-esque editing of him hunting voles in the barren Great Steppe of central Europe is more than a mood lifter.\n\nThere is perhaps a rare dip in footage quality when it comes to the Siberian tiger, mostly captured on remote cameras evidently positioned for months and even years to catch glimpses of one of the world’s rarest big cats. With less than 500 left in the wild, it is extraordinary to see this majestic giant tracking the scent of prey that has long moved on.\n\nThe episode’s compulsory heartbreak comes during a grizzly bear attack on a herd of musk ox with newborn babies, although again, this is followed by something rather more lighthearted: the absurdity of male hooded seals and their inflatable noses attempting to woo females in the Arctic Ocean. How many times, when commentating over mating rituals, has Sir David uttered the devastating words: “She seems unimpressed”?"
