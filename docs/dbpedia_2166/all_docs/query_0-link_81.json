Now, with decades of experience on the cutting edge of camera technology, he’s the perfect guide to show us some of the world’s most spectacular species.\n\nClassic questions such as “why are tigers orange, zebras stripey and flamingos pink?” are all answered with nuance and the latest science is applied to a host of other familiarly flamboyant characters from peacocks to poison dart frogs.

While many viewers will have visited the museum (NHM) in London, few will have been lucky enough to get a glimpse inside the 140-year- old building during the pandemic. Watching the programme, though, feels almost exactly like stepping once again into the Hintze Hall, where the skeleton of Hope, a whale, hangs from the ceiling. She is truly the inanimate star of episode one, with her story the subject of intense scientific research. Through chemical analysis, principal curator of mammals Richard Sabin is able to reveal the path of Hope’s final journey and discovers she wasn’t alone on the trip.\n\nThere are appearances from the NHM’s stars, including Dippy the Diplodocus, along with new additions for the museum’s Fantastic Beasts exhibit. But as the museum’s collection contains more than 80 million items, many have never been, and might never be, on display. One such item in episode two is shown by senior insects curator Dr Erica McAlister and it requires a microscope to truly appreciate: fleas, dressed in tiny outfits, as if attending a wedding, all handmade by nuns in 19th-century Mexico. Of all the fascinating specimens brought to life by the series, these are without a doubt the best dressed.\n\nI Am Greta (2021)\n\nWatch on I Am Greta on BBC iPlayer or Amazon Prime Video\n\nIt's been three years since Greta Thunberg embarked on her first school strike outside Sweden’s parliament, yet in that short space of time, the activist has helped spawn a seismic global movement, inspiring millions to heap pressure on the planet's worst polluters.

In addition, the programme takes a look at how humans have impacted the planet and its environments and wildlife.\n\n“Together, these forces have shaped our perfect planet, but it's a fragile system.” says Attenborough in the trailer. “Today there is a new force. One so powerful, it threatens life on Earth. Human activity is now so dominant that it's disrupting the forces of nature, and the vital habitats that life needs to survive on Earth. To preserve our planet, we need to act now. And if we do that, there will still be time to restore the ecological balance that once made this Earth our perfect planet.”\n\nCheetah Family & Me (2021)\n\nWatch on Cheetah Family & Me on BBC iPlayer\n\nRead our full review of Cheetah Family & Me\n\nWildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan embarks on his latest adventure to get close and personal with another animal family – this time, following two cheetah mums as they work against all odds to protect and provide food for their gorgeous young cubs.\n\nFathom (2021)\n\nWatch Fathom on Apple TV+\n\nThis documentary follows two research scientists as they travel to the opposite sides of the world in pursuit of answering the mysteries of why humpback whales sing, how that song travels the world, and how their songs influence whale culture.\n\nThe highs and lows of carrying out exciting research and fieldwork are set against a spectacular backdrop of beautiful scenery, whale sightings and eerie whale sounds, giving an insight into what fieldwork is like and how important it is to learn more about these incredible creatures.\n\nSecrets of the Whales (2021)\n\nWatch Secrets of the Whales on Disney Plus\n\nEach of the four episodesof this epic Disney Plus documentary focuses on a different whale or dolphin species: orca, humpback, beluga and sperm, with narwhals also making an appearance. Each also centres on a different theme of behaviour; exploring family ties, communication, co- operation and hunting.\n\nYou cannot fault the series on its spectacular cinematography. The joint movie-making skills of producer James Cameron and photographer Brian Ferry are evident throughout, with epic sweeping footage, heart-rending dramatic scenes and a beautifully chosen and suitably emotive score composed by Raphaelle Thibaut.\n\nBest nature documentaries released in 2020\n\nDavid Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet (2020)\n\nWatch on David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet on Netflix\n\nRead our full review of David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet\n\nProduced by Silverback Films and WWF for Netflix, it charts the devastating changes that the broadcaster and conservationist has witnessed during his lifetime. His career has seen him visit every continent, and share much of the world’s natural wonders with millions of people around the globe.\n\n“This film is my witness statement, and my vision for the future. The story of how we came to make this, our greatest mistake, and how, if we act now, we can yet make it right.”\n\nWe named it one of the Best David Attenborough documentaries to watch\n\nTiny World (2020)\n\nWatch Tiny World on Apple TV+\n\nRead our full review of Tiny World\n\nIf you’re a fan of the often-overlooked small species, then this series on the “tiny heroes” is for you.

The programme follows on from a 2019 UN report, which showed that a million species face extinction. It also touches on the link between human encroachment into wild animals’ habitats and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Unique animals with complex and varied lives disappearing from our planet forever isn’t just disturbing, it’s deeply tragic. But this is about more than just losing the wonders of nature, the consequences of these losses for us as a species are far-reaching and profound.”\n\nNight on Earth (2020)\n\nWatch on Night on Earth on Netflix\n\nWhat do animals get up to while we’re tucked up in bed?

Despite this, Night on Earth manages to present an eye-opening new perspective.\n\nWild Animal Babies (2020)\n\nWatch Wild Animal Babies on Sky Nature with NOW TV\n\nGet ready to ooh and ahh as biologist Patrick Aryee teaches us about the difficulties faced by baby puffins, meerkats, elephants and kangaroos when they take their first steps in the wild.

A world locked away under snow and ice. So hostile and inaccessible, it has long concealed its secrets from us.” A mysterious start to this BBC Four documentary, narrated by David Attenborough.\n\nThis programme follows the journey of a scientific expedition on MV Alucia, exploring the icy waters around Antarctica. On average, the ocean here measures between 4,000–5,000m in depth, so the team must use deep-sea submersibles that can carry passengers and descend to 1,000m – the first time this has been done here.\n\nThe dives reveal a diversity of extraordinary creatures, many of which are new to science. They also find astonishingly large species, a phenomenon known as polar gigantism, including squids and jellyfish.\n\nPlanet Earth: A Celebration (2020)\n\nWatch Planet Earth: A Celebration on BBC iPlayer\n\nRead our full review of Planet Earth: A Celebration\n\nEarly in 2020, BBC One announced a unique collaboration for a special natural history documentary, titled Planet Earth: A Celebration, which aimed to lift viewers' spirits during the uncertain times of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCelebrated broadcaster Sir David Attenborough recorded a new narration for the programme, which featured eight sequences from Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II.\n\nAward winning composer Hans Zimmer, whose work includes The Lion King, the Pirates of the Caribbean series and The Dark Knight trilogy, as well as the scores for Planet Earth II, Blue Planet II and Seven Worlds, One Planet was joined by Jacob Shea and the team at Bleeding Fingers.\n\nThey created new compositions, and rearranged the original scores, with the string section performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra.

Billed as \"the first-ever comprehensive series on the natural history of the world's oceans\" this truly was a groundbreaking series, showing us species and behaviour never before filmed using (at the time) state-of-the-art underwater photography techniques. The score for this series, composed by George Fenton, is particularly beautiful.\n\nThe Blue Planet II (2017)\n\nWatch Blue Planet II on BBC iPlayer\n\nDavid Attenborough returns to share more ocean mysteries and creatures in Blue Planet II. Produced in the same style as the fantastic first series, each episode explores a different habitat or aspect of ocean life, from coral reefs to the deep ocean. This episode on 'The Deep' is particularly awe-inspiring, dubbed by one critic as \"the greatest episode\" of the “greatest nature series of all time.” Diving right into the perpetual darkness of the abyss the episode takes us to underwater lakes, hydrothermal vents, and even to the depths of the Mariana Trench, the deepest location on Earth.\n\nLife on Earth (1979)\n\nWatch Life on Earth on BBC iPlayer\n\nThink nature documentary and instantly the soothing tones of David Attenborough come to mind. Now in his nineties, Attenborough, spent over 25 years creating acclaimed and award-winning series with the BBC Natural History Unit and is something of a deity in the wildlife world.\n\nLife on Earth features a young Attenborough and set a benchmark for natural history documentaries, firmly placing the broadcaster as a household name. It provides a comprehensive story of life, from the very first primitive cells to the evolution of homo sapiens. This is a must-see, even if it is just to watch the best remembered sequence when Attenborough comes face to face with an adult female gorilla in Rwanda (hint: twelfth episode).\n\nMarch of the Penguins (2005)\n\nWatch March of the Penguins on Amazon Prime Video\n\nThis incredible wildlife documentary follows the survival and mating ritual of Antarctica's emperor penguins.

The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews and critical acclaim, even winning the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Well worth a watch if you have managed to not see it yet!\n\nPlanet Earth I (2006)\n\nWatch Planet Earth I on Amazon Prime Video\n\nTake a journey across 204 locations in 62 countries in this fascinating nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough.

The first produced by the BBC in Ultra-high-definition this series truly is a visual spectacular. Following the same format as the original 2006 series the episodes each feature a different habitat but with some new ones added. The 'Cities' episode is particularly fascinating, highlighting those animals that have adapted to live alongside humans, in the 'urban jungle', including mischievous roof jumping langurs in Jodhpur, India, and spotted hyenas in Harar, Ethiopia, who have a unique relationship with the people that live there.\n\nFrozen Planet (2011)\n\nWatch Frozen Planet on BBC iPlayer or Amazon Prime Video\n\nJoin David Attenborough on an extraordinary journey across the polar regions of our planet in this chilling nature documentary. This now-classic doc was met with considerable critical acclaim when first broadcast in 2011, and still makes for an amazing watch.

This was director Jeff Orlowski’s wake-up call to the world that we are fast running out of time to protect this precious ecosystem.\n\nJANE by Brett Morgen (2017)\n\nWatch JANE on Disney+\n\nBrett Morgan tells the story of Jane, a woman whose research into chimpanzees revolutionised our understanding of the natural world.\n\nThe Planets (2019)\n\nWatch The Planets on BBC iPlayer\n\nProfessor Brian Cox explores the dramatic lives of the eight majestic planets/worlds that make up our solar system."
