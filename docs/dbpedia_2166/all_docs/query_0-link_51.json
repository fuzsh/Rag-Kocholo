        "text": "Stephen Fry’s impersonation of David Attenborough starts unpromisingly. “It’s hard to describe,” he says from his wintry perch in the Arctic Circle, “how still it is on a glacier surrounded by a fresh blanket of snow.” Then you must try harder, Mr Fry, given that you’re presenting a programme that celebrates the wilderness in its few remaining minutes before being repurposed as luxury flats.\n\nTo be fair, at the outset of A Year on Planet Earth (ITVX), Fry perfectly nails the tremulous throb of awe at nature’s glorious wildness. It’s like watching Frozen Planet III narrated by a different national treasure. But then Fry has to sully these achievements with his second sentence. He follows his inability to describe glacial stillness with: “Which makes the fact that I am moving at over 490,000 miles an hour more extraordinary.” No, it doesn’t. His struggles to offer adjectives about snow really have nothing to do with how extraordinary his velocity is. David Attenborough’s script editors would have spotted that non-sequitur before broadcast.\n\nAnd yet, this nod to speed of the Earth’s rotation nicely sets up the conceit for this first episode of a four-part series that will take us to more than 60 locations before it’s done. As the world turns laterally, we travel longitudinally, visiting all kinds of different wildlife in different locales at the same time of year. Such is Fry’s spin on the natural world.\n\nWe cut to two polar bears, apparently tearing lumps out of each other on the Svalbard glacier, like Philip Pullman’s Iorek Byrnison and Iofur Raknison minus armour. These brawlers, Fry explains, are in fact mother and son, and she is toughening him up for his solitary decades ahead, hoeing his lonely row through the snow. If you’re suffering from empty-nest syndrome, this theme of a parent letting go of their offspring – so the latter can flourish independently – is unbearably poignant. Accordingly, the throb returns to Fry’s voice as he intones: “It will be the last winter they spend together.”\n\nSo far, so Attenborough. But then Fry does something outside Sir David’s skill set: he conjures up jeopardy before we head to the ad break. Our wandering bear is now alone and hungry in the darkness of the winter solstice. “This polar bear,” says Fry appallingly, “won’t see the sun for another 56 days … if he lives that long.” I don’t want to give away the plot, but let’s just say if any polar bears die in the making of this programme, I will lose my mind and I hope you will, too.\n\nAfter the ad break, though, we’ve swivelled to the other end of the world. It’s summer on Marion Island in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean, and time for a king penguin dad to replace his spouse in egg-sitting duties. We’ve seen this little ritual innumerable times on previous nature documentaries, and yet how charming it is that Fry and the director get the pastiche just right, right down to the jokily plucked orchestral strings.\n\nNext in our global travelogue we meet a baby elephant who’s just been born in Botswana’s rainy season. But Dumbo’s descendant has a problem. He hasn’t mastered his trunk – neither how to wave it, nor how to use it to vacuum up stuff. To be fair, if you were suddenly born and found you had a huge muscular appendage growing out of your face, would you know how to control it? That’s right, you wouldn’t. So don’t look so smug.\n\nFinally, we head to snowy Montana, where a red fox is looking pensive atop a 3ft snowdrift. Fry tells us that this apparently gormless beast is actually calculating furiously, using the angled tilt of the Earth’s magnetic field and noises from its subterranean prey to triangulate a dozing rodent’s position. (I’m taking this on trust.) This calculation tells the fox how high to jump to maximise its chances of making a kill. And then it leaps, returning seconds later with its prey.\n\nAs I watch this, I’m torn between admiration for Fry’s account of the fox’s hunting skills and something else. I’m getting deja vu – not because of some short circuit in my brain, but because I have seen this very sequence before. I’m watching not just the circle of life, but TV’s parade of the Earth’s most photogenic wildlife on an endless loop."
