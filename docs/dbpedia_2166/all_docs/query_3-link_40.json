        "text": "The purpose of this chapter is to explore the relationship between media representations of the animal kingdom and the increased demand for wildlife tourism products and destinations. The discussion will pay particular attention to the types and delivery of natural history programmes, the social representations of animals, the tendency towards anthropomorphism, animal performance and destination marketing. Animals play a very important part of the human imaginings. Throughout our evolutionary history man has had an extremely complex relationship with the animal kingdom. According to Franklin, animals are uniquely positioned relative to humans in that they are “both like us, but not us” (1999:9). Unlike trees, plants and rocks, they have the capacity to represent the differentiations, characters and dispositions of any given society. Indeed human-like characteristics particularly prevalent in mammals often reflect the extent to which mankind can empathise with animal behaviour or attributes and this in turn affects how worthy species are of the tourist gaze or even of protection or conservation. For a tourist, animals can become a focus of attention as they bring ‘action’, ‘theatre’ and ‘performance’ to an otherwise still or passive landscape. There is no doubt that television programmes, popular media, art and literature all play their part in how we conceptualise animals and their habitats. Out of these genres, natural history television programmes are arguably the most powerful in determining animal narratives and values due to their ‘up-close’, ‘real-time’ and ‘visual’ portrayal of the trials and tribulations of animal life. Davies (2000) plots the development of the this genre from its post-war beginnings until the 1960s during which an expert vision of nature that stressed the importance of field observation and scientific interpretations of animal form so revolutionised by the ‘scientific voice’ of David Attenborough were the order of the day. However, many would argue that this narrative has long since gone to be replaced by one which is more anthropomorphic and emotional; particularly in the light of deforestation, climate change and declining species. Today, the camera is a lens through which ‘real-life’ animals stories are told. Programmes such as the BBC’s Big Cat Diaries, March of the Penguins, My Family of Bears are gripping, emotional accounts of animal lives. The use of web-cam and film technologies that reveal the entire day to day life of species and allow audiences to follow the trials and tribulations of life as it unfurls have also been instrumental in capturing audiences. Indeed many wildlife tourist attractions also now incorporate webcam technologies to capture the imagination and interest of their visitors. The wildlife tourism literature frequently alludes to this inter-relationship between increased wildlife tourism demand and the proliferation of emotive natural history programmes; particularly those which depict charismatic, iconic, flagship or disappearing species (Newsome et al., 2005; Walpole and Thouless, 2005). Research recently undertaken in the United Kingdom confirms this relationship where in-depth interviews and survey data reveal how a popular, live, twice weekly programme on British wildlife has instilled or reawakened an interest in trip taking to see Britain’s wildlife. This correlation between interest in wildlife watching and media representations of nature is not surprising when wildlife programmes are watched by 52% of men and 51% of women in the UK (DCMS, 2009). Destination marketers have also been quick to exploit the demand to see iconic species. Tourist brochures are thus proliferated with photographs of endemic wildlife. These and popular natural history programmes culminate in animals being both symbolic of place and perhaps also symbolic of the anthropogenic impacts on our natural environment which subconsciously evokes a desire to ‘see them while you still can’.\n\nWildlife-documentary production has expanded over recent decades, while studies report reduced direct contact with nature. The role of documentaries and other electronic content in educating people about biodiversity is therefore likely to be growing increasingly important. This study investigated whether the content of wildlife documentaries is an accurate reflection of the natural world and whether conservation messaging in documentaries has changed over time. We sampled an online film database (n = 105) to quantify the representation of taxa and habitats over time, and compared this with actual taxonomic diversity in the natural world. We assessed whether the precision with which an organism could be identified from the way it was mentioned varied between taxa or across time, and whether mentions of conservation and anthropogenic impacts on the natural world changed over time. Mentions of organisms (n = 374) were very biased towards vertebrates (81.1% of mentions) relative to invertebrates (17.9% of mentions), despite vertebrates representing only 3.4% of described species, compared to 74.9% for invertebrates. Mentions were highly variable across groups and between time periods, particularly for insects, fish and reptiles. Plants had a consistently low representation across time periods. A range of habitats was represented, the most common being tropical forest and the least common being deep ocean, but there was no change over time. Mentions identifiable to species were significantly different between taxa, with 41.8% of mentions of vertebrates identifiable to species compared with just 7.5% of invertebrate mentions and 10% of plant mentions. This did not change over time. Conservation was mentioned in 16.2% of documentaries overall, but in almost 50% of documentaries in the current decade. Anthropogenic impacts were mentioned in 22.1% of documentaries and never before the 1970s. Our results show that documentaries provide a diverse picture of nature with an increasing focus on conservation, with likely benefits for public awareness. However, they overrepresent vertebrate species, potentially directing public attention towards these taxa. We suggest widening the range of taxa featured to redress this and call for a greater focus on threats to biodiversity to improve public awareness.\n\nNature tourism and adventure program is one of the most popular programs on Indonesian television. However, these kinds of programs were often ignoring the environmental aspects. As a result, conservation issues were neglected because the main purpose of the program was only to show the audience the luxury of the trip. One of the cases could be seen on “The Beautiful Adventurers” program on Trans7, which was aired on Sunday, April 22nd, 2018. This particular episode showed the hosts were consuming a “Kima”, a kind of giant clams that is protected by the law. Harsh criticism from environmental activists spread on social media, even before the show ended. This study took this incident with an explanatory case study method to analyze it from the perspective of environmental communication. The results showed that the crew did not have awareness about the conservation issues and was more attracted by the tour guides’ persuasion rather than following the regulations that have been establi..."
