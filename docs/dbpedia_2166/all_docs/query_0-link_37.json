This six-part series format unearths the formidable wildlife in the inhospitable, thick glacial surroundings of the world’s icy-cold regions within the Arctic and Antarctic boundaries.\n\nKeeping body and soul together in that below-freezing temperature, Sir Attenborough voices the startling challenges that the diverse inhabitant species of that area have to endure in order to protect their generation from going completely extinct.\n\nIn this petrifying journey, the documentary fathoms the most savage local animals (including the Siberian tigers, the snow monkeys, the grizzly bears, the Emperor penguins, and others) and their dreadful metaphors that are creating calamities for all the lives on planet Earth.\n\nWatch the full movie to know what’s next!\n\nFrozen Planet II AMC+ trailer\n\nYou can watch the first official trailer of Frozen Planet II below:\n\nFrozen Planet II AMC+ cast\n\nHere is the main cast of the natural history sequel, The Frozen Planet II:\n\nDavid Attenborough\n\nJamie McPherson\n\nHelen Hobin\n\nIs there any way to watch Frozen Planet II for free?\n\nYes.
