        "text": "This post touches upon a crucial aspect of leadership dynamics that often goes unnoticed. It's true that in many group settings, the person who speaks the most tends to be perceived as the leader, regardless of their actual intelligence or expertise. This phenomenon underscores the importance of examining how leadership is perceived and cultivated within our communities. Instead of rewarding individuals solely based on their ability to dominate discussions, it's essential to shift our focus towards valuing quality contributions. True leadership should be measured by the substance of one's ideas, the ability to listen attentively, and the capacity to facilitate meaningful dialogue among team members. By encouraging inclusivity and creating space for diverse voices to be heard, we can foster environments where leadership emerges organically based on merit rather than verbosity. It's time to redefine leadership qualities beyond mere vocal dominance and prioritize the qualities that truly make a difference in driving progress and innovation.\n\nI challenge those in positions of leadership to seek out the input of the less vocal…those who take the time to thoughtfully digest information before responding…whose insights and ideas may be overlooked in favor of the flashy front row sitter who is enthusiastically nodding in agreement and raising the first hand. I’m tired of seeing boards, panels and committees filled with the same names and faces. Let’s take the time to thoughtfully fill our spaces with all the personalities that make our organizations a success. #introvertsareawesome #leadership #letsbebetter #organizationalpsychology\n\nThis is quite interesting. Babble Effect. Great name. I think we have all seen some incredibly talented and confident people become leaders and are promoted because of their talent and confidence, but they don't have strong leadership skills. It is imperative that when you hire a leader you need to understand how they lead, not just what they know and how they show. As leaders hiring leaders, continuing to monitor the impact those leaders have on their teams and ensuring they are growing as leaders is important. Sometimes easier said then done. How do you do it when your vantage point is so different from those who are impacted most by their leadership? Some ways; 1. Asking targeted questions in manager once removed meetings 2. Observing them in their own meetings with their reports 3. Understanding how they set targets and objectives 4. Listening to how they talk to people superior versus peers versus front line staff 5. Observing how much they talk in meetings versus listen and ask questions when their staff is present. Are they actually listening? 6. Noticing, are they present? Do they respect their teams and peers enough to give them undivided attention? 7. Seeing how often they meet one on one with their team members. Do they prioritize it? What tactics do you have? What do you watch for?"
