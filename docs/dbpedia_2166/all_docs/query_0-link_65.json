        "text": "I remember 20 years ago, when planning a new series , considering a sequence about the snow leopard. No one had ever filmed this marvellous and then still-mysterious animal in the wild.\n\nWe researched it in great detail, but the more we discovered the more improbable it seemed that we could ever film it.\n\nEventually we decided that the animal ’s rarity and the vastness and emptiness of the areas in the Himalayas where it lived made the project impractical and we abandoned it.\n\nTen years ago, the team producing the first Planet Earth series were bolder. Two highly experienced natural history cameramen took on the job. They worked patiently for more than two years.\n\nIn the end, one of them secured a memorable shot of a snow leopard stalking, chasing and finally pouncing on a Himalayan goat – which then, with astonishing strength, shook off its attacker and escaped by leaping into a river.\n\nFor a picture of a hunting snow leopard, it was surely unsurpassable. But now new technology has allowed Planet Earth II to go one step further.\n\nThe producers decided to try to film the social life of this most solitary of all the big cats. To do that, they deployed 20 camera traps.\n\nThe results, screened last night, are not only thrilling for television viewers, they also revealed aspects of snow leopard behaviour that were new even to the scientists who have been studying these magnificent animals for years.\n\nIt is a marvellous sequence in which you see this lonely animal padding through these vast peaks.\n\nI found it one of the most moving pieces in the whole series and it was a joy to narrate.\n\nBut it is only one of a whole range of astonishments in this new series which would simply not have been possible with old technology.\n\nSixty years ago, though the movie cameras were theoretically portable when in skilled, strong hands, they were still cumbersome and consumed huge quantities of 35mm film at an alarming rate.\n\nThey were certainly not the sort of thing you wanted to haul about when trying to creep up on some shy, elusive animal.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, things began to change. Film cameramen working for television started to use small cameras that took 16mm film.\n\nIt was a blissful time for those of us trying to make programmes about natural history.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, electronic cameras could be powered by batteries so small and long-lasting that they could be taken to the most remote jungle, the highest mountain and the most desolate wilderness.\n\nElectronic cameras brought huge advantages. Instead of exposing reel after reel of expensive film that could be damaged by humidity or scratches even before it was processed, you could record everything on tiny cards.\n\nYou could use them with extravagance because memory cards were both wipeable and cheap.\n\nAnd instead of having to wait – sometimes for months – for the film to come back from processing, you could replay your pictures immediately to see if you had actually recorded what you wanted.\n\nIt was then that we began to realise that we had, almost unknowingly, entered a new era.\n\nMost importantly, electronic pictures could be viewed on screens separate from the camera that was producing them. You could put a miniature camera, unnoticeably small, beside a bird’s nest and watch what was happening while relaxing in a tent a mile away.\n\nNo longer did you have to sit with your finger on the start button, ready to press it when – or preferably, just before – an animal did something interesting. Now you could use an instant-replay device that automatically recorded the 30 seconds before you pressed that button.\n\nFor those of us making natural history films, it was liberation. For most of those watching, however, the change barely registered – except that, year after year, pictures came from increasingly remote places and showed events, animals and behaviours that no one had ever known about before.\n\nMemorable series followed, one after the other – Planet Earth, Blue Planet, Frozen Planet, Africa, The Hunt – each with new wonders and revelations.\n\nAnd now comes Planet Earth II.\n\nDoes all this matter? Has all this technical invention and human endeavour provided us with anything more than a wonderfully watchable and visually unforgettable television series?\n\nI believe it has.\n\nSince those early days, the human population of this planet has tripled. As a consequence, the space for the other creatures with which we share the world has become more and more restricted.\n\nSeries such as Planet Earth II manage to bring us greater and greater understanding of the natural world, the way it works and what it needs if it is to continue to survive. And its survival could not be more important to us.\n\nWe depend on the natural world for all the food we eat, for the very air we breathe. Its health is our health. Its survival is essential for ours.\n\nAdapted from Planet Earth II by Stephen Moss with a foreword by David Attenborough. Planet Earth II is published by BBC Books. The TV series continues on Sunday on BBC1 at 8pm.\n\nPlanet Earth II in numbers\n\n10,000 species of grasses are found on the world's grasslands, which cover almost a quarter of the planet's land\n\n50% of plants and animals live in jungles which cover only 6% of land\n\n80,000 square kilometres of grass and farmland are turned to desert every year\n\n4billion people, more than half of the human population, now live in urban areas, which will grow by nearly 30% in a decade\n\n80% of the species that have become extinct in the last 500 years have been on islands. Small populations, and therefore small gene pools, allow evolution to happen very rapidly.\n\n20% of the Earth's surface is covered by mountains\n\n-89.2C is the lowest temperature ever recorded, at Vostok Station, Antarctica, at an altitude of 3488m"
