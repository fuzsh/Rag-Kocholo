        "text": "David Attenborough will host a “super-landmark” series for the BBC, A Perfect Planet, examining how forces including oceans and volcanoes shape the world’s ecosystems. The 93-year-old – who recently warned that humans had “overrun the world” while promoting another upcoming project, A Life on Our Planet, with Netflix and the WWF – will look at phenomena including the Indian monsoon and Arctic winters in the five-part series.\n\nThe series will explore how weather, oceans, volcanoes and sunlight shape the natural world, from a weather system that effectively distributes water to “marine currents [which] deliver nutrients to even the deepest reaches of the ocean”. It will also focus on animals and how they react to their ecosystems, including the white wolves of Ellesmere Island in Canada and Chinese golden snub-nosed monkeys.\n\nAttenborough seems set to continue his environmentalist streak in the series, with an episode dedicated to the “force of nature” that is human activity. In a statement, the naturalist said “a new dominant force is changing the face of Earth: humans. To preserve our perfect planet we must ensure we become a force for good.”\n\nThe BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, described A Perfect Planet as a “breathtaking series celebrating the intricate systems that allow our planet to thrive, bringing together a unique perspective with groundbreaking camera technology.”\n\nAttenborough’s climate crisis message has become more explicit recently, notably with shows including BBC One’s Climate Change: The Facts and his debut Netflix project, Our Planet. Previously, his 2017 series Blue Planet II – a follow-up to his hit 2001 programme Blue Planet – raised awareness of single-use plastic."
