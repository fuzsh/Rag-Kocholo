        "text": "BBC America is premiering a new six-part series “Frozen Planet II” visits the planet’s poles, arid tundra, icy seas, snow-covered forests and mountain peaks, exploring the lives of polar bears, snow monkeys, Siberian tigers and other animals that brave the extreme conditions of harsh winters.\n\nIn this follow-up to 2011′s “Frozen Planet,” Sir David Attenborough will be taking viewers back to regions of extreme cold, looking at the effects of climate change on these fragile ecosystems and how the frozen parts of our planet are disappearing.\n\n“Frozen Planet II” will premiere on BBC America Saturday, January 28 at 8 p.m. For fans who have cut the traditional cable cord, you can still stream the series on Philo (free trial) or FuboTV (free trial).\n\nWhat to expect on tonight’s episode\n\nAccording to the official synopsis of Jan. 28′s episode, “The premiere episode “Frozen Worlds” examines how polar bears, penguins, snow monkeys, Siberian tigers and other species must overcome a unique set of challenges to endure the extreme environment.”\n\nFor those without cable, watch with these streaming services\n\nYou can watch it on Philo, an entertainment streaming service that offers 60+ channels and a free trial. You also can watch the show on FuboTV that offers access to your favorite TV shows, live sports events and more.

Premiering eleven years after the original series, “Frozen Planet II” benefits from the considerable advances in camera technology since the original. Whether capturing microscopic cracks in ice under baby penguins’ feet, or using light-weight drones to follow an avalanche running down a mountain, a new set of eclectic visuals emerge that celebrates the colder regions and warns of what is lost in the face of global warming.”\n\nMore about Philo\n\nPhilo’s live TV subscription offers a free trial and costs $25 per month.
