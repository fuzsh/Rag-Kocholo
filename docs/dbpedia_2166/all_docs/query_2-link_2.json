        "text": "Nature rules — again. Netflix today announced Our Planet, an eight-part natural history series from the creators of the Emmy-winning series Planet Earth. The ambitious four-year project will take viewers into never-before-filmed wilderness areas from the ice caps and deep ocean to deserts and remote forests. Using 4K camera technology, the series will bring viewers into intimate contact with some of the world’s rarest animals and most precious natural habitats. Our Planet is set to premiere in 2019 across Netflix territories.\n\nThe series is being produced by Silverback Films, led by Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, who created Planet Earth, Frozen Planet and Blue Planet for the BBC, as well as the Disneynature films Earth, Bears, African Cats and Chimpanzee. The conservation group WWF is providing the Silverback team unparalleled access to its projects in protected areas around the world. “Our Planet is going to raise the bar for natural history landmarks,” said Fothergill. “We will reveal the most amazing sights on Earth and show them in ways they have never been seen before.”\n\nPlanet Earth aired in the U.S. on Discovery Channel in 2006 and went on to score seven Emmy nominations and four wins, including Outstanding Nonfiction Series. Five years in the making, the 11-hour program was the BBC’s most expensive nature series at the time and its first to be filmed in HD.\n\n“Netflix is proud to be the global home for perhaps Silverback’s most ambitious project to date,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP Original Documentaries. “The Planet projects have enjoyed great success on Netflix and have helped launch new technologies for viewing at home. We think watching Our Planet, fully on demand in 4K will be an unforgettable experience for our members.”"
