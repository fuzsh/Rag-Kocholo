        "text": "SmartSky Networks\n\nSmartSky Networks delivers the best air-to-ground (ATG) communications experience flying today, with performance as much as 10-times better than other ATG networks currently available.\n\nWith SmartSky, business aircraft passengers can stay connected and engaged at 35,000 feet by sending emails, uploading and downloading large files, teleconferencing, surfing the web and even live gaming, without interruption. Flight crews and maintenance teams can access all the features of Honeywell Forge anywhere they fly. SmartSky is the first ATG provider to enable Honeywell Forge and its full suite of in-flight connectivity and flight services capabilities.\n\nWhat Makes SmartSky Different?\n\nAdvanced communications technologies – including 4G and 5G capabilities – create a high-speed, low-latency and secure ATG experience that only SmartSky can deliver.\n\nSmartSky uses patented beam-forming technology to assign each aircraft a unique network connection and provide both passengers and flight crews high-speed Wi-Fi that will remind them of their terrestrial networks.\n\nThe SmartSky offering includes the best-in-class, next-generation ATG network, advanced hardware including radio and antennas that are lightweight and easy to install, and a transformational digital platform and application layer, Skytelligence®. Honeywell’s GoDirect Router can be used with the SmartSky Network to provide up to 5G network speed, performance and reliability.\n\nCoverage Across the Map\n\nAvailable today through Honeywell, the SmartSky network covers about 80% of business aviation flight routes in the continental U.S., with plans for full coverage by mid-2022.\n\nGetting connected and staying connected throughout the flight is easy, thanks to SmartSky’s wedge architecture, which creates seamless coverage tower to tower, eliminating dead zones, drops in coverage and the need for 3G service over many urban areas.\n\nPrepare for Early Arrival\n\nContact your Honeywell representative or click on “Get a Quote” below for more information about SmartSky, including details about “Early Arrival” incentives.\n\nVisit SmartSky Networks website"
