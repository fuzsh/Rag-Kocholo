Kurz and Allison were a major publisher of chromolithographs in the late 19th century. Based at 267-269 Wabash Avenue in Chicago, they built their reputation on large prints published in the mid-1880s depicting battles of the American Civil War. In all, a set of 36 battle scenes were published from designs by Louis Kurz (1835â€“1921),[1] himself a veteran of the war. Kurz, a native of Salzburg, Austria, had emigrated to the United States in 1848.[2]
