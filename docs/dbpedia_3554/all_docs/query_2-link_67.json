MANLANGIT (A.Y. 2020)\n\n1\n\nYear 2020 is the most challenging era not only in Philippines but even in international scene. The advent of Covid19 pandemic has been trying moment both to the people and the government. In these confusing times, what give us anchor is our identity as a Filipino and that is the role of history. The first part of the module discusses history and related concepts. It also includes article about the pre-colonial Philippines. Specifically, it comprises the history of Zamboanga Sibugay. This portion serves as a reminder of our glorious past and reminds us to stand high and mighty for we are a people with splendid history. The mid part of this module was comprised of articles about our colonial experiences. It does not intend to push us to the verge of indignity. Nonetheless, to remind us of the valour of our ancestor who intend to survive while trying to preserve the roots of being a Filipino. Likewise, this segment wanted to give us an innovative outlook of our colonial experience as years of enhancement/enrichment of the Filipino culture. And the last part of this module gave us an inkling of the current issues that confront our nation. It is hope that our pride of our past and Filipinoness will be our source of strength in overcoming contemporary problems of our nation. Indeed, we could say that history is our direction and guide in the future.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.\n\nHistory Defined Significance of History Source of History\n\n2.0\n\nFilipinos 2. 1 Filipino Trails 2.2 Brief Pre-history 2.3 Filipino & People of Zamboanga Peninsula (Janice S.

This is the most popular definition of History. Some pessimists would claim that history is the tale of the prominent people. Hence, the narrative of the known, the powerful and the popular. However, history has much deeper and more sensible meaning than we realize. Before proceeding to the meat of this module, let us defined history from the perspective of various scholars. History is a record of human past from the moment written record began to appear. This is one of the most dispraise definitions of history because it seems to support the notion that no written record, no history. Which is not the case because history commence as early as the existence of mankind. According to Gottschalk, history is actuality; hence it must study the past as it happened: This demand that the historian abandons the present. The practical value of studying and using the past to understand the present is lost. History is studied, written and taught for its own sake. Modern understanding of history defined the term as the reconstruction of the past based on written records, oral history, cultural artifacts and folk traditions. It is the imaginative reconstruction of the past, the students of events concerning people of the past. Historian has very important role in establishing history as a field of science. Aside from recording, documenting and organizing evidences, it has two indispensable tasks: 1. To interpret facts in orderly and intelligible manner, and LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\nS\n\n Define History  Appreciate the significance of history especially for the unity of the Filipino people and nation-building  Distinguish the field of history as a science and art  Identify Sources of History 2. To discover patterns and trends which govern the behaviour of people and of nations, and to come up with a generalization on these. Thus, the most practical definition of history is an interpretative and imaginative study of surviving records of the past, either written or unwritten, in order to determine the meaning and scope of human existence.\n\n3\n\nHistory is also both a science and an art. It is a science because it is viewed as a reconstruction or reinterpretation of the past as reflected in records, written, collected, analysed and synthesized by people with proper training and expertise in the field, they are the historians. Likewise, history is an art because it involves creative and imaginative reconstruction of the past. The mere presentation of facts does not constitute history but a chronicle. Thus, facts have to be interpreted and recreated to make a historical narrative.\n\nI.II SIGNIFICANCE OF HISTORY A. BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN THE PRESENT AND THE PAST The role of history is relevant for us to understand some circumstances at present. People will not achieve a clear grasp of what happen if they do not have any background of the past. As they said, the present is the result of the past. What our country today is the product of the past. The nature and the extent of contemporary problems in our country at present can best be understood in the light of their historical roots. Hence, knowing the past could prevent historical discord and allow us to understand things better. B. EXPLAINING CAUSES OF THINGS AND EVENTS Another important function of history is giving us better and logical rationalization of the cause of things and events. Our background of the past could give better idea to people and even our leaders on the approach they can appropriately apply on certain issues. How they could better curtail insurgents and piracy? Why Filipinos have state-side mentality? Why the Manila centric folks always find fault on the first Bisaya President, President Duterte, despite the fact that he is trying his best in all challenges encounter by the Philippines? Why the ABS-CBN, one of the dominant and powerful tv network in our country cease operation? Why there are more covid19 cases among the urban populace than the rural populace? Our knowledge of the past would give us better understanding of the present. C. PROJECTING THE FUTURE History allows us to derive intelligent speculations about certain events. Through History people has the chance to predict possible happening by equipping oneself with the knowledge in History. People will be prepared to face some circumstances due to past experience or they may avoid unpleasant experiences by taking notes of the past experiences of people who are experiencing the same dilemma. Circumstances in the past\n\nhave been observed to contribute to the unfolding of a significant event. Taking into account of similarities and parallels between the past and the present also leads to consideration of likely possibilities or scenarios in the future. History allows us to speculate intelligently about the future. Present and future intelligent actions spring from sound knowledge of the past. For instance, several experts have already predicted that with the level of discipline and obedience the Filipino has if our home quarantine will be lifted early, there is a possibility that the number of COVID19 cases will spike to around 30,000 by June. Which is true because by June the number of COVID19 infected in the Philippines reach more than 30, 000. Nevertheless, number of deaths in a short period of time have been lessened because people tend to equipped themselves of the knowledge by reading about the precautions made by people during the Spanish Flu pandemic. We also take note on the advice of Italy, the first and most devastated country by covid19 pandemic. And considering the past experiences of the people, our leaders tend to develop us to become more resilient to the pandemic both in physical health, mental health, economic and even in the overall being of the people. Economist and even private business owners have developed buffers to help minimize the negative economic impact to the people and the nation. D. INTERPRETING CONDITIONS OF A GIVEN SPACE AND TIME History is the only branch of knowledge that can provide information and corresponding interpretation of period of history. For instance, the economic dominance of the Chinese at present has already long expected by the people. Hence, it is branded as the sleeping giant in the past. The grasps in history is the same reason why our President Duterte refused to be a sandwich between the US-China latent rift. No matter how critics criticized Him for manifesting tolerant behaviour towards China. Our clever Presidents was aware in the first place that fighting China is futile and not our battle to fight. If the US is envious of China’s economic gain and position in Asia, then US should attack China rather than using little pawns from smaller Asian country. His stand towards China and US relations is the best manifestation that we have learned and reflected from the Spanish-US Battle in the past. This leads us to another what ifs. If only our ancestors have the same wisdom as President Duterte, may be Philippines has never been dragged to Hispano-Americano war which lead to more than half a decade of US colonization and intervention to the affairs of the Filipinos. However, we cannot bring back the past but we can use it as our steeping stones and reference in making decisions at present. History aid people to come up with intellectual interpretations of certain occurrence. E. PROMOTING NATIONALISM AND PATRIOTISM\n\n4\n\nHistory is the best area of human knowledge that can help in promoting nationalism and patriotism. It inspires and develops a sense of national pride and a sense of devotion to country by recording the exploits and struggles of forefathers to win freedom and independence. History affirms the facts that Filipinos possess many positive traits and a very rich culture. For instance, Filipinos are known to have crab mentality or state side mentality but lessons from the past and even our recent COVID19 experience teach us that in times of crisis, it is the Filipinos companies, stakeholders, and government who would save us. Hence, we notice that during the pandemic, we patronize more on local products rather than the imported ones. The government lead the way by sourcing the relief goods they are to distribute to the people from the produce of local farmers. Likewise, the people who are aware of the huge donations of the numerous local companies during the pandemic began to patronize the products of the said companies. Their simple act of kindness during the pandemic will leave a mark on the heart of every Filipinos. This in turn will dramatically change the consumption behaviour of every Filipino. Our experience in this pandemic today will surely teach the future generations to love everything local and even our government. Private companies, despite some loss and recession go out on their way to be the partner of the government from preventing possible disaster during ravage of COVID19. In this case, history will serve as a tool in identifying commonalities in our culture and experiences. Our common experiences would direct us to the need of nationalism and patriotism for the common survival of the Filipino People. Our common roots and common experiences urge us to love our country more.\n\nI.III TYPES AND SOURCES OF HISTORY A. WRITTEN OR INSCRIBED SOURCES 1. Birth and Death Certificates 2.

The Filipino people are a mixture of races though they rooted from Malay stock. The Filipinos are naturally brown-skinned like their Malay ancestors. But with the coming of the colonizers, particularly Spaniards and Americans, Filipinos become the blend of the East and the West. The intermarriage of the natives with the West consequently produced light-skinned and high-bridged nose known as the mestizo. The mestizo has disagreeable connotation because of the social and economic gap with the natives in the past. Hence, they are known to be arrogant, boastful, and pretentious. At present, as time heals the division, as education narrowed the gap and as the principles of humanity and equality envelops our system, those unpleasant descriptions of a mestizo were gradually fading. 2.1 Filipino Traits\n\nCHAPTER 2 We can glean from the previous chapter of what is history; what are the significance of history; and what are the types and sources of history. While this chapter will focus on giving us glimpse about the Filipinos; the unique cultural traits of the Filipinos; the precolonial Filipinos and particularly the Filipinos that occupy Zamboanga Peninsula in the preHispanic period. This chapter aims to give us better perspective in knowing the Filipinos through the characteristic traits they possessed. Likewise, it also aims to trace the historical rationale of such traits. Similarly, this chapter geared towards knowing the origin of the Filipinos and other people that help weave the history of our country. Moreover, it aims to develop sense of pride of our local history by including the people and history of Zamboanga Peninsula, which become an important tributary of the Maguindanao Sultanate in the past.\n\n6\n\nFilipinos could best be qualified through certain traits that they have exhibited through the years such as hospitality, pakikisama, close family ties, respect for elders, loyalty and fatalistic and more. These attitudes gave Filipinos another unique identity apart from his Malay brothers. Hospitality. The unique traits of a Filipino that commends itself to strangers and friends. Even if you drop in an unholy hour of the day and sensing that you are hungry, the Filipinos readily prepares the best food, even if there would not be enough food for the next meal. Among the rural areas, these traits were manifested if you happen to walk in the rain, households would invite you to rest and take shed in their home. During fiestas, houses fetch people from the road to taste their food preparations. However, younger and career driven generations at present no longer as hospitable as their ancestors. Likewise, the rampant scammers and criminals gave people second thought on showing goodness to strangers. Likewise, the crises and pandemic experience by the\n\npeople taught them to prioritize basic needs and be more practical. Hence, lavished and pompous celebrations were only held to those who can really afford. Millennials nowadays are more particular on travel, career and experience. They dwell on a very tiny apartment and condos while living a busy and frugal life. Hence, not so accommodating to visitors. Pakikisama. This is one of the misunderstood traits of the Filipinos. It is loosely translated as manifestation of camaraderie and good faith. The person is labelled to have mabuting pakikisama if he is not selfish, and participates cheerfully in community work, and masamang pakikisama, if he is incapable of empathy. The term pakikisama has been debased into an attitude that makes a crooked well-liked or admired if he can help even if he subverts justice. Pakikisama is the basic of Bayanihan system. It is very useful when our economy is dominantly agricultural and greatly dependent on manual labor. With the shift of Philippine economy to manufacturing and semi-industrial and the implementation of mechanization on agricultural works, labor force needed becomes minimal. Hence, pakikisama and bayanihan become less likely essential. Close Family Ties. Family is the basic social institution among the Filipino society. It is the primary social group and the first agency of socialization. It is the smallest unit of society and everything revolves around it. The Filipinos possess a genuine and deep love for the family. Young ones are oriented to be caring to their elders. Among Filipino families, seldom we find elderly and sick abandon by family. Ideally, the father is the head of the family and normally the one who rules. The mother is the housekeeper, the educator, the laundry woman and the cook. However, contemporary Filipino family is not confined to this set-up. With massive promotion of education, men and women are afforded equal opportunity. Thus, families are becoming more practical. There are families where both parents are working. In other families, they choose who has the most lucrative income and those who earn less is the one who give up a job and take care of the children and family. There are also families who can afford nanny, hence, both father and mother can pursue a career. The nannies most of the time are relatives or a family friend. There are also independent women who when separated assume the role as breadwinner of the family. Others choose not to marry even when pregnant and become the standard bearer of the family. Today, it is no longer unusual to see single parent household head in a family.\n\n7\n\nRespect for Elders. This is one Filipino trait that has an enduring force that has remained in the book of unwritten laws. The Filipino parents exercise almost absolute power over their children and whatever decisions they made are respected. It is quite unthinkable and surprising for a son or a daughter to do an important decision without consulting the parents. Children are not condoned talking back to those who are older than they are. The elders believe that they can demand obedience among the young members of the familyright or wrong. For elders, academic degrees required in college does not impress them and cannot compare favourably with their long experience. For them, the young have the knowledge; theirs the wisdom, collective responsibility is evidently felt in the Filipino family. The members who are lucky to be better off have to look after the welfare not only of their immediate family but also of other relatives. The custom, right or wrong, in the family as a social institution, comes first. Fatalism. Fatalism is doctrine that all events are predetermined or subject to fate. The Filipinos are by nature fatalistic and submit to fate. It seems that no amount of logic and scientific explanation can remove him from this fatalistic attitude. He believes that every fate or misfortunes that come along his way is attributed to fate. This fatalism is exemplified in the common expression Bahala na, may awa ang Diyos. The equivalent of Spanish expression, Que Sera, sera (Whatever will be, will be). This fatalistic attitude has been ingrained in the Filipino sense of resignation. Like what happen this pandemic. Some people are infected because they did not follow the health protocol saying that Bahala na ang Ginoo. Kung pagbuot Nya matakdan, matakdan jud ta (I entrust everything to God. If it is His will to get the virus, then we will be infected). Some people who are lay off from work due to the COVID19 tend to go back to their place of origin. Sometimes the bahala na attitude signals lack of initiative, planning or hope. Yet, there are people who says bahala na, but very determine to work and start a new life in their place. Some of them revive gardening and local industries just to have something to feed for their family. Because of the Bahala na mindset, most of us do not make enough effort to increase our income and reduce our expenditures which could significantly lead stable future. According to the Bangko Sentral, 86% of Filipinos do not have bank accounts which is a sign of financial illiteracy. Somehow, bahala na also connotes hope. Because of the quarantine, classes were halted before the end of the semester and academic year. Students commonly say bahala na. Fortunately, due to humanitarian reason, schools were ordered to give passing grades to students as long as they have complied the minimum requirement of the course.\n\nExtreme Personalism. Filipinos are extremely personalistic. A typical Filipino view the social environment in term of personal relationships. The extent to which one is able to relate personally to things and people determines the recognition of their existence and the value attached to them. Filipinos have difficulty dealing with all forms of impersonal stimuli because of this personalistic view about his environment. This is one of the reasons why one is uncomfortable with bureaucracy, with rules and regulations and with other standard operating to be observed. Personal relationships, which are always involved in any transaction make this, most often, are difficult to turn down. Preference is usually given to family and friends in matters of hiring personnel, delivery of services and even voting for candidates during election. Consequently, this extreme personalism often leads to graft and corruption and other malpractices in our government institutions. During the pandemic, one of the most dignified legislators in our country, Senator Koko Pimentel has been the target of bashing and criticism because he violated health quarantine protocol just to accompany his wife to the hospital. Many claimed he know already the result of his test yet he disregarded the regulation. The extreme personalism the Senator demonstrated reverberated to some consequences. Every time there are citizens who commit quarantine violations, they would bring up the unsanctioned case of the Pimentel. Later people are even more sceptical to the government when they found out that the family and staff of high-ranking officials of the country bugged the DOH for test even if they do not have any symptoms. Thus, depriving the front liners, who are expose to the virus, of the test because of the demand priority and special treatment of the politician’s family and staff. Lack of Discipline. The Filipinos have aversion for following strictly a set of procedures to observe order and discipline. They are impatient and wanted to get what they want fast. This results in the use of short-cuts or the palusot syndrome, nakaisa, nakalamang, and nakadaya, in the Filipino vocabulary loaded with implied values. In several instances, they are guilty of the ningas-cogon tendency. The attitude of the Filipinos who exhibit full of zeal and enthusiasm at the beginning, which die down, leaving things unfinished. The general quarantine in the Philippine commenced around the mid of March 2020. Health officers and government officials are glad because they believe that we can delay, if not halt, the virus transmission if we continue to stay home and follow health protocols. Unfortunately, during the Holy Week in April, people influx in their local markets to purchase ingredients for a local delicacy served in most households during Holy Week season, the binignit. The news particularly captures no social distancing photos from one of the markets of Cebu. That is why it is not surprising that the positive COVID19 cases also spike in Cebu.\n\n8\n\nAnother, instance that shows lack of discipline is the case of NCRPO chief Debold Senas. He is one of the implementor of quarantine regulations yet during his birthday he was severely criticized because of the gathering that happen despite the situation. His camp defended that it was a surprise. So, he does not have prior knowledge of the plan. Some say the photos was taken long ago. Nonetheless, how come when people are wearing mask and in the previous years, we are not use of wearing mask. Another lame excuse they brought up is that, it is just a manyanita. Hence, todays as a mockery to this statement, they use the term manyanita when they have gathering to mock the scot-free merrymaking of Senas despite the protocol. Along with this is also Alam ko na Yan Attitude which prevent us from deepening our knowledge on a particular subject because we assume that we know everything. Lack of National Consciousness. A proper understanding of one’s history is a very important factor in the development of national consciousness because it will serve to demonstrate how the present is influenced by the past. A state where national consciousness is absent or fragile can only succumb to the Western power that is more skillful, subtle and wear the façade of benevolence (goodwill) aided by deliberate and systematic miseducation of the exploited. Westernization has virtually dulled the minds of the Filipinos so that, as a result, a crisis of identity was created. It is so pervasive that Filipinos were unaware of their own lack of national consciousness. It is so sad that during the pandemic instead of support our own people threw reproaches and criticism to the government. They even have the guts of comparing our country to the strategies and moves of another country like Singapore, Japan, and New Zealand, which are less populated and more advanced when it comes to technology and economy. Colonial Mentality. The Filipinos suffer from National Amnesia and Colonial Mentality. This condition can be mirrored from the lack of patriotism and national integration and strong preference for imported goods, foreign ideas and ways. The Filipinos is fond and proud of adapting the foreign elements into their image. This is manifested in their preference for foreign fashion, entertainment, lifestyles, technology, language and consumer items. Even a century apart from Rizal’s observation, the ways of Consolacion, Victorina and Tiago can still be trace in our society. Recently, the K-pop and other Korean culture has invaded not only in our entertainment but even in our food preferences. During the early decade of the 21st Century, Korean movies and drama enchanted the Filipino viewers. That our legislators file a bill to regulate the viewing time of this drama not in the prime time. Along with the dramas are music, food\n\nand even fashion. The Kimbap, Kimchi etc become part of the dish serve in Filipino tables. Korean cosmetics has been most sought after. During the quarantine, there is a challenge in Facebook and it is surprising that a lot of people on FB are ask to enumerate the Korean series they have completed and they could even name more than 10. That challenge is an indication of how profound has Korean culture has engrained in our society. Recently some personalities like director and actress who commented on the obsession of the Pinoy on the K-pop culture were greatly condemned. Nowadays, our colonial mentality has even worsened when era enter globalization and cosmopolitanism, when world become smaller and connected through online. Passivity and Lack of Initiative. While it is true that Filipinos can adjust to circumstances in a given environment and is possessed by some creative talents, they are generally passive and lacking in initiative at times. They waited to be told what has to be done. The strong reliance on the government and people in authority tend to make Filipinos complacent. They lack creativity and diskarte in life. During the pandemic, passive people are easily distinguished because they are the one who get hungry during the crisis. Most of them wait for the relief operations of the private groups or the government’s aid. And worst some used the SAP fund they received in buying wants like hair rebonding instead of reserving for food. Some even keep on criticizing the government on their miserable condition while they did not initiate move to alleviate their condition. This trait allows Filipinos to tolerate inefficiency, poor service and even violation of human rights. Having patience is good but showing tolerance to violation is stupidity. This is the reason why a lot of women has been a victim of VAWC abuses. In many ways, it can be said that Filipinos are too patient for a long suffering, easily resigned to one’s fate, even if they are oppressed and exploited.\n\nPhilippines by 10,000 years ago. Wilhelm, postulated that these people may be the ancestors of the present-day Negrito groups and some small ethnic groups living in the mountains of Mindanao. He called this era Archaic Period (200,000 years ago to 7000 years ago). About 8,000 years ago, a way of life oriented to the sea began to develop in southern Mindanao and Northeastern Indonesia. Solheim identified them as Nusantao, who explored the tides, currents and coastlines to the north and extended their explorations to Taiwan, coastal South China and northern Vietnam by around 7000 years ago. Their mastery in exploration of the sea end the isolation of the Philippines and promoted contact among the peoples of the different islands in Indonesia and Taiwan. He branded this time as Incipient Filipino period which is around 7,000-3000 years ago. The Nusantao developed a maritime trading and communication network throughout the Philippine islands, along the coast of China and Vietnam, extending North to include Korea and Japan by 2000 B.C. east from eastern Indonesia and Mindanao into the Pacific at the same time, and west to India by 1000 B.C. Coastal living Filipinos made up an integral parts of the Nusantao. By 2000 B.C. people of Cagayan Valley were probably practicing horticulture and were making sophisticated pottery sharing numerous elements of form and decoration with people of Taiwan and South China. Shortly after 2000 B.C. similar cultural elements were appearing in Western Palawan and later in the Visayas Islands, southern Luzon and coastal Mindanao with close similarities to coastal Vietnam. Major migrations were not involved in these developing Filipino cultures but were brought about through the information/ communication networks of the Nusantao, and intermarriage between Nusantao people who traded into the Philippines from outside and coastal Nusantao of the Philippines. This is now the Formative Period which dated from 1000 BC to AD 500. 2.3 The Filipino People and the People of Zamboanga Peninsula\n\n2.2 A Brief Philippine Pre-History Until today, the first entrance of humans to the Philippines is controversial. One hypothesis was based on the archaeological sites in the Cagayan Valley, West of Tuguegarao, which believe that human came to the Philippines first come from Southern China (Taiwan). Then moved south to Northern Luzon by way of Land bridges. This phenomenon was believed to have occurred 40,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene period. The more widely accepted hypothesis is that they entered Palawan through Borneo, when the latter is still part of the Mainland Southeast Asia due to lower sea level during the late Ice Age or some 30,000 years ago. Archaeologists believed that both routes were used. Humans, who used simple tools and live a hunting and gathering life, were scattered in the\n\n9\n\nThe Philippines is a plural society composed of Tagalogs, Visayans, Ilocanos, Bicolanos, Pampagenos, Pangasianares, Ibanags and Zambals, and other indigenous groups include the Igorots, the Apayaos, Bontocs, Ifugaos, Mangyans of Mindoro, Tagbanuas of Palawan, Bajaos and Samals of Tawi-Tawi, Agta of Palanan, Atis of Negros, Ilongots of Nueva Viscaya, the Tinguians of Abra, the Negritos of Pinatubo, the Maranaos of Lake Lanao, the Maguindanaos of Cotabato and the Subanen of Zamboanga Peninsula. The Wave of Migration Theory supported Blumentritt’s Malay migration in the Philippines. The Malayan race was believed to have the same origin with the Mongol inhabitants. From the mainland, they spread down into the Malayan Peninsula. Being boat builders and navigators, the Malay migratory movements scattered into the different islands\n\nof the great East Indian archipelago. New experiences and environment in these warm, tropical, and fruitful islands, gradually modified these emigrants from Asia, until they became in mind and body quite a different race from the Mongol inhabitants of the mainland. At the beginning of the 16th century, around the time of the arrival of the migratory wave from Borneo. Another migratory group from the Moluccas also reach Mindanao and Sulu archipelago. However, Blumentritt contended that the 3rd Malayan migratory movement was halted with the coming of the Spaniards. In Luzon and Visayas, the adherents of Islam were easily won over without any bloodshed by the Spaniards. That is why the 3rd wave of Malayan Migration was confined to Southern Palawan, Sulu Islands and the greater part of coastal regions of the islands of Mindanao. The Malays who came to the Philippines were the ancestors of the Muslim tribes of Mindanao. Except for the Bajaos, most of the Malays who come to the Philippines were not yet Islamized. According to Blumentritt, the Muslim in Southern Philippines were offspring of mixed marriages between the sedentary Visayans, the Manobos, the Mandayas, the Subanons and the Muslims coming from Borneo and Moluccas Islands. Even during the arrival of Legaspi, the Malay Muslim continue to invade noiselessly and peacefully the southern islands using Borneo as their starting point. They arrived in the southern islands as merchants and missionaries and at the same time founding local dynasties and small kingdoms. The vassal princess of Manila and Tondo were all Bornean and probably their masters too. Likewise, the people of Calamianes group of islands also paid tributes to the Sultan of Borneo. Just like in the domain of Maguindanao Sultanate, Sibugay had also multi-ethnic composition. As Sultan Barahaman once remarked, “the people of Maguindanao certainly are known under one name, but consist of different nations.” But among the nations under the Maguindanao Sultanate, three of whom (the Subanen or Harafora, Samal or Lutao and Maguindanao) had significantly shaped the history of Sibugay, especially during the height of the Maguindanao Sultanate. They were dubbed as the key players of the of the events within Moro Gulf and Zamboanga Peninsula because they were the foremost inhabitants of Zamboanga Peninsula. 2.3.1\n\nSubanen/Harafora/Alfores\n\nThe Harafora were commonly found in the Moluccas, Papua, Celebes, Philippines and Maguindanao, where they are referred to as Subano or Manubo. In 1667, Father Francisco Combes called the Subanuns the “fourth nation of Mindanao” and referred them as the inhabitants of the river. It is believed that their name was derived from SUBA but because\n\n10\n\nthey were ordinarily found at the upper reaches of small rivers, hence, Subanun may mean up-river people. Outsiders often called this tribe Subano, hispanized for the local name Subanun. The Subanun (also written as Subanu, Subano, Subanen) was of Moro (Sulu) origin and meant men or people of the river, more exacting referring to the fishing and hunting tribes that inhabited the river banks and the streams. The Haraforas were the most ancient and original race of all the Eastern Islands. Currently, the Subanen/Haraforas were one of the tribes that traditionally dwelt in Zamboanga Peninsula. The interior and mountainous portions of the Zamboanga district in Mindanao formed their habitat. There were few Subanun can be trace in Surigao Provinces, Agusan del Sur, Bukidnon, Davao Oriental, Davao del Sur and Cotabato. The greater number, however, was found in Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga Sibugay. Even though, they were nomadic but they did not however depart from their customary habitat. The Subanuns were more notable because of their closely-knit clans. The villages of the Subanun/Subanen were ruled by a Timuay. Being secluded in Zamboanga Peninsula or around Mt. Malindang, these river folks were able to retain their old customs and traditions which kept them distinct from the outside world. They may be Islamized, Christianized or paganist Subanen but they were bonded by their Malay origin. They were lighter in color than the Muslim tribes and generally excelled them in strength and activity. However, some of them acknowledged a Muslim Rajahs as their superior especially those who professed Islam and become Kalibugan. In the Philippines, the notion that the Harafora (Subanen) as warlike had been advanced by authors like Frederick Sawyer, Reuben Canoy, and Ferdinand Blumentritt. According to Sawyer, the Subanun had the reputation of being war-like yet they were entirely dominated by Moros. In like manner, Canoy remarked that they were warlike by nature and often fought among themselves. But their lack of unity and sophistication in the art of war made them vulnerable to their aggressive and well-organized neighbourhood. Likewise, Blumentritt described the Subanun as the tribes who were war-like similar to the Caragans but different in the sense that the Subanuns needed only to kill one enemy in order to be accorded the privilege of wearing a red turban. Nevertheless, the animist and wild image of the Harafora in other Eastern Islands were never exhibited by the Haraforas in the Philippines. The Haraforas who were in the Philippines had the reputation of being timid, friendly and peace-loving. As for slavery even if softened by the spacious pretext of service to pay a debt, the practice horrified them. It is difficult to imagine how people who had the reputation to kill for honor and practiced human sacrifices were tamed and became one of the oppressed and exploited tribes in the\n\nPhilippines. They were even under the subjection of the Lutaos, who imposed the will of the Maguindanao ruler. Nonetheless, not all tribes under Harafora family altered some of their practices. As a matter of fact, the Manobos in Caraga had retained their identity of being war-like tribe. 2.3.2\n\nLutaos/ Bajaos\n\nThe Bajaos who were seafaring people were also identified as Lutaos, by 17th century historian, Fr. Combes. Combes referred them as one of the four nations of Mindanao. He espoused that some Badjaos/Lutaos originated from ternate especially the Badjaos from Maguindanao and its satellites like Samboangan. This may be the reason why Blumentritt called the Luatos as inhabitants of Zamboanga. Forrest advanced that the Badjaos or Wadjaos had come from China but expelled there when the Tartar invaded. It is believed that these people were scattered in the Malay islands. The Badjaos/Badjoos were said to come originally from Johore, Malacca, Borneo and adjacent Islands. Maguindanao traditions held that the people who accompanied Kabungsuan were Samal (Badjaos), the sea gypsies of the Malay Archipelago who traced their origin to Johore and Ache Island of Indonesia. The Samals/ Badjaos who came with Kabungsuan seemed never to have settled in Maguindanao itself. They temporarily settled for some time in the island of Bongo or Bungud that lies opposite the mouth of Pulangi river and at Batwan and Banago near Malabang. From these places they moved later to Sibugay (scattered from the coast that extend from the river of Mindanao to Samboangan), Sarangani and Davao. Some dwelt in Cebu and some in Dapitan villages. There were also who settled in the island of Basilan and Sulu archipelago. The Samals/Badjaos were sea rovers. They had no claim on territory anywhere. They were so slightly attached to the land where they frequently went. The Lutaos/Samals were people without fixed abode except sea. They were sea nomads. The Samal’s cultural values were in a sense, tied to the sea which was the only environment they know since childhood. Consequently, they loved the freedom they found in the waterworld among the sea kingdom where the laws of men did not matter. Their attachment to their ancestral spirit and the spirit of the sea, provided unity for his family and his community. Thus, their value system revolved around a cultural matrix in which man, nature, and the spirit world were integrated and worldly cares were not as vital as the freedom they enjoyed. Most of them were a kind of itinerant fishermen. Because of the nature of their livelihood, they seldom settled in a village. They were scattered in the bays and beaches\n\n11\n\nsuitable for their fishing. They did not trouble themselves cultivating land because they can get what they needed through barter with the produce of other tribes including even the woods they burn and the logs from which they built their houses and crafts. These people may find living in the land more difficult than living in the sea as they were accustomed and used to with the difficulties of dwelling in the sea. They know no other houses except the boats. Their fondness of living in the sea was apparent on the fact that their houses were built along shoreline. Others dwelt close to the sea on those islands, their houses being raised on post a little distance from the land or always at the mouths of the rivers. Among the Malay migrants to the Philippines, the Lutaos were quite peculiar. They possessed the attributes that would be able them to build strong and progressive chiefdoms such as superior skills in navigation and warfare, efficient envoys and messengers and a skilful shipbuilder. Combes’ described the skills of the Lutaos, which made them valuable to the rulers whom they committed their loyalty. The Lutaos had never been independent but had lived under the protection of various datus, and always served them for the protection he afforded them, or paid him tribute. But what distinguished them from slaves was their reliance on the movement and the ability to offer their allegiance and service to other political contenders in the face of unreasonable authority. The Lutaos were a superb Moro fighting marines. They were effective on land and sea battles (amphibian soldiers). They were seafaring people who did not form their own sultanates but played an important role in supporting these sultanates, particularly Maguindanao and Sulu Sultanates. They provided the shipping and naval power, engaged in the collection of marine and forest products, acted as freight carriers and supplied reliable information to the Sultans. The Badjaos not only excelled in collecting marine products but also brought various kinds of information as they moved freely from one place to another. It was, in fact, an Indian Lutao who told Fr. Gregorio Belin that a heavy loaded Mindanaoan who was out for piratical raids for eight months, would pass on Punta Flechas to conduct their superstition and idolatry ritual. As a consequence of the information by a Lutao informer, the pirate leader named Tagal, was killed. Most of the powerful nations would hire Lutaos as mercenary soldiers. They do not only serve powerful Sultanates. There are Lutaos who also served as guide, spies and soldiers of the Spanish, Dutch and English. Combes claimed that the Luataos were said to be employed by Corralat (Kudarat), manned some of his boats, fighting and carrying on piracy side by side with the Maguindanao people and with the Iranun. Their service to the ruler of Maguindanao Sultanate might be the reason why most Lutaos in Sibugay were often affiliated with the Maguindanao. The Lutaos were one of the trusted men of the Maguindanao Sultan but what set them apart from other Maguindanao subjects was that\n\ntheir master treated them with reservation because they were capable of transferring their loyalty anytime. Despite their military prowess, the Lutaos were not spared from social discrimination and ill-treatment. The Samals experienced the first case of ethnic cleansing in the Philippines. It happened during the reign of Gov. Gen. Narciso Claveria who ordered Sama prisoners from Balangingi to be shipped like cattle to the northernmost part of Luzon. Towards the close of the 19th century, a group of exiles was allowed to return home. But because of their traumatic experience in Balangingi, many preferred to migrate to Zamboanga. After the conquest of Sipak, the distraction of their home and farms resulted in a diaspora that scattered the Samals in all direction. Some evacuated to Sulu and Zamboanga, others to Cotabato. There were also Samals who fled to Davao.\n\n2.3.3\n\nThe Maguindanaos\n\nSeveral scholars like Argensola, Combes and Juan de la Concepcion stressed that it was of great probability that Mindanao/Maguindanao was peopled by Muslim population from Ternate. Some of the inhabitants came to Mindanao belonged to the nobles of Malacca who migrated to another place after the fall of Malacca to the Portuguese. Kabungsuan was reckonned to be one of the members of Malaccan royal family, who left Johore together with so many followers but eventually separated from each other after having scattered by strong winds. The Ternatan origin of the Maguindanaos was one of the reasons why Ternate could not turn its back to Maguindanao in times of crisis. In fact, the presence of Ternatans were quite common in Maguindanao. And the sight of Maguindanao who stayed around and resided in Ternate to visit relatives, to renew acquaintances and even to fight in ambushes was valid enough to infer that the Maguindanaoan-Ternatan relationship was deeply-rooted. The Maguindanaos are one of the major tribes in Mindanao. Najeeb Saleeby described the Moro people as chivalrous in his manner and received his friends in liberal hospitality but wasted no sympathy or kindness on his enemies. The Maguindanaoans is one of the Malay stocks that profess Islam. The faithful Muslims who settled around the lake and marshes of Cotabato came to be called Maguindanao or People of the Flooded Plains. The unity and leadership brought by the Muslims to dominate in Mindanao.\n\n12\n\nThe companion of Captain Swan, William Dampier supplied vivid descriptions regarding the physical features of the Maguindanaos. According to him, the Mandanayans were men of mean statures; small limbs, straight bodies and little heads. They have oval faces, flat foreheads and black small eyes. Generally, they have short low noses, pretty large mouths, red thin lips and black yet very sound teeth. The colour of their skin was tawny but the women were fairer than men. Women’s hair is black and long, which they tied in a knot that hanged back in their poles. They were more round-visage than the men and generally wellfeatured. However, their noses were very small and so slow between their eyes that in some of the female children the rising that should be between the eyes was scarcely discernible. Men wore few clothes. Their heads were circled with a short turban, fringed or laced at both ends; it went once about the head, and was tied in a knot, the laced ends hanging down. They wore frocks and breeches, but no stockings nor shoes while the malong is the most common cloth for the Maguindanao women. During his visit, Dampier observed that the status of the people can be mirrored in the materials they were wearing. The well-off people had their garments made of long cloth; but the ordinary people wore cloth made of plantain tree saggen (popularly known as abaca). They lived a sedentary life in Cotabato where large number of Maguindanao population mushroomed. Their houses were all built on post about 14, 16 18 or 20 feet high. These posts were bigger or less according to the intended magnificence of the superstructure. They had but one floor with many partition or rooms, and a ladder or stairs to go up out of the streets. The roof was large and covered with palmetto or palm-leaves. There was a clear passage like a piazza under the house. Some of the poorer people who keep ducks and hen have a fence made round the post of their houses with a door to go in and out; and this under room served for no other use. Some used this place for a common draught of their houses built mostly close by the river in all parts of the Indies and made the river received all the filth of their house; and the only chance to wash away the filth from the household during the time is during flood. The Sultan had the biggest house in the community. It stood on about 180 great post or trees, a great deal higher than the common building, with great broad stairs that were made to go up. In the first room, he has 20 iron guns, all saker and minion, placed on field carriages. The general and other great men had some guns also in their houses. About 20 paces from the Sultan’s House, there was a small low house built purposely for the reception of ambassadors or merchant strangers. This also stood on post but the floor was not raised above three or four feet above the ground, and was neatly matted purposely for the Sultan and his council to sit on for they used no chairs but sit cross legged on the floor.\n\nThe Maguindanaos were endowed with good natural wits and were ingenious, nimble and active. They were generally proud and walk very stately. They were very valiant and the word retreat and surrender were not in their vocabularies. They dared explore high mountains and unknown seas for loots and prey and they never hesitated attacking the enemy with gallant determination even if they were armed with nothing but shields and campilans. They were civil enough to strangers and would easily be acquainted with them and entertain with great freedom but they were merciless to their enemies and very revengeful if they were injured.\n\nThe Maguindanaos were gay people. They loved dancing. Another way of spending their leisure time was through a board game called dama. Moreover, they also spent their pastimes in chatting, smoking and chewing betel nut. They were very sociable that very often they held ceremonial feast for various reasons. It might be due to chief succession, trading, warfare, agricultural cycle, pregnancy, childbirth, marriage, illness and death. As a matter of fact, even circumcision was celebrated in Maguindanao society. During the visit of Captain Swan and his company in Maguindanao, an elaborate feast was sponsored by the Raja Laut for the circumcision of his son.\n\nFor their health, the Maguindanao tabib (medicinal men) employed the so called complex and simple medicine. The complex practice is called Tauacal which often done to find the cause of the disease with regards to custom and promises. This was done by dividing the egg into five equal parts representing asal, sapa, panama, samaya and umur. The egg was arranged in coconut shell so as to stand up straight, a pinhole was made at the center of its smaller end, and after praying to God to indicate the real cause of the disease, a piece of burning charcoal was supplied at the bottom of the egg. The heat dilated the air space of the egg and expelled some of its content, and according to the area in which they were split, the cause of the diseases was indicated. In the area of asal, the patient could be sick when he forgot to follow some customs of his ancestors such as praying, almsgiving; in sapa, the patient failed to fulfil the oath taken on the Koran; in panama, he failed to fulfil an unspoken promise, in samaya, he failed to fulfil a spoken promise, in umur, the cause of the disease may be anything but the patient would irremissibly die.\n\nIn early society, feast is very significant as it was associated with ceremonial or ritual events. It was conducted to negotiate or to reaffirm social relations with other political leaders. Hence, another purpose of feast was to reassert the authority of certain leader. The support of the subject and his allied can be manifested on the willingness and on the shares they have contributed for the celebration. The feast is one of the indicators of wealth and affluence of the sponsor. Besides, the feast never did burden the sponsor because all the subjects and the participants of the feast contributed for the occasion. Aside from that, ceremonial feast was also one of the occasions where they could display and exchange valuables such as porcelain, gold jewellery and other heirlooms pieces as part of the ongoing reciprocal exchange partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple method of diagnosis used by some Maguindanao tabib was to determine the day of the week the illness began. A disease beginning on Sunday was believed to be caused by the devil; a Monday disease was thought to be caused by wind; a Tuesday illness by water; a Wednesday illness by the sun; a Thursday illness by hunger; Friday illness, the agent of the disease acted while the person was sleeping; and an illness which started on Saturday was due to an internal wound. The Maguindanaos as Muslims practiced polygamy. Thomas Forrest testified during his visit to Maguindanao that Sultan Pahar ud-Din had about 14-15 concubines /consorts. Furthermore, Dampier mentioned the Sultan Barahaman himself had 30 wives while the Raja Laut Kuda maintained 8 wives. This polygamous practice led to a peculiar arrangement with their respective wives. The Raja Laut Kuda, for instance, lay with his wives by turns. But the wife who bore him the first son received double attention and time when it came to her turn. Whereas, the rest of his wives had only one night. She who had turn of the Sultan or Raja Laut’s company has a particular respect by other wives. The queen for the day had a mark of distinction from other wives by wearing striped handkerchief about her neck.\n\n13\n\nThe Maguindanaos had unique way of entertaining visitors, the pagally system, which Dampier described as begging custom. It is the system wherein a visitor is entertained base on the money and goods he can offer to the host. Because of their extreme hospitality and friendship, the Maguindanao Sultanate attracted many people. Hence, Maguindanao sultanate became a multi-ethnic nation. Commercial affairs of the Sultanate were under the direct supervision of the raja laut. To take a strong hold of the region’s economy, the Maguindanao Sultanate welcomed traders of various tribes in their negeri. This contributed to the numerous ethnic compositions of the Maguindanao population. Most of the slaves and royal servants belonged to different nationalities. There were but few tradesmen in the city of Maguindanao. The most of the traders were goldsmiths, blacksmiths and carpenters. Majority of these craftsmen were Chinese, giving a touch of Chinese to the Maguindanao customs. Likewise, the Chinese is very significant for the economic and social activities of the Maguindanao Sultanate. Maguindanao rulers, designed ways to attract the Chinese such as by giving them women to marry. When a Chinese decided to leave the sultanate, the ruler would ask pawn or confiscate his property to ensure that he would come back to Cotabato. This was done because the economic activity of Maguindanao was activated by the Chinese. They maintained supremacy in economy because of the resourcefulness and innovativeness of the Chinese merchants.\n\nToday, it may be said that Suluans and the Maguindanaos were not much different physically from the rest of the Visayans because it had been a practice of these pirates for centuries to take prisoners from the region which they pillage and almost 95% of the Visayan taken prisoners choose to stay with their masters and hence they become absorb into general population. Besides, these people belonged to the same racial stock which was Malay who, through migration, peopled the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asian islands.\n\nACTIVITY\n\nY\n\n2.1 For each trait, find a facebook memes that best fit or describes the trait.

At that time, the people of the Philippines were believed to have a sense of belonging to the Malay world and were thought to be literate, prosperous and united under their chiefs. Spanish conquest is believed to have put an end to this idyllic condition and led to the decline and destruction of the Philippine people. The Spanish and American colonialism is seen as the cause of the present-day problem faced by the Philippine society.\n\nCHAPTER 3 From the previous lessons we are oriented on the type of Filipino people based on the traits that is dominantly manifested by Filipinos. These traits may be qualified to be positive and negative for the Filipinos. Likewise, the preceding Chapter give us a quick browse of how Filipino people came to the Philippines with the help of theories presented by scholars. Moreover, the previous chapter entails to develop us sense of pride on our local history by presenting bits of Sibugaynon people as one of the role players that shaped the landscape of Mindanao history at the height of Maguindanao Sultanate. Furthermore, this chapter aims to new and proper perspective on the way things are presented in our history. It is hope that through rethinking and reconstructing the way we look at the history of our country will give us opportunity to rediscover ourselves. Particularly this chapter presented some pre-Magellan events, some discourse about the coming of Magellan and analysis on the excerpt of the Battle of Mactan and the Indigenous Discourse on Warfare. The article will give us a thorough analysis on why Filipinos emerge victorious in the first amphibious encounter between the Filipinos and the Westerners. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\n16\n\nS\n\nThe inhabitants of the Philippines lived in kinship-based settlements known as barangay under a chief, generally known as Datu, Lakan, Rajah, Sultan (for Sultanate in Muslim areas). Most barangays were small, having 10 to 30 houses, but there were some large ones of a hundred or more houses. The barangay was the largest social unit in most of the Philippines. It was considered to be pre-political since having none of the attributes of a governing organizations, it was more of an extended family type arrangement. The size of a barangay was determined by its location within the natural environment. On the eve of the Spanish arrival, there were two locations in the Philippines that showed sign of organizational structure of a large scale. These were the town of Jolo, Sulu and Manila in Luzon. Both of these places developed a more sophisticated structure even before the Europeans arrived. As in other parts of the Malay World, the members of a barangay were socially differentiated into chiefs, freemen, and slaves. The chiefs or clan-heads with their immediate family and associates had extensive control over the social and economic life of the community. Chiefs were men of personal ability and prowess who were recognized leaders of their communities. In a few places burial mounds have been located that were venerated sites at which, the people believed, the spiritual force of a powerful chief resided. It is generally thought that life within the barangay was quite benign. Freemen were heads of households with some right to productive land. Slavery was more of a bonded dependency than the end of harsh plantation labor that we generally associate with that term. Some slaves who were captured in raids were then generally settled on the land, and in a generation or two were integrated into the community. Others were debtors who secured their debts with their labor, really the only capital that was available to most\n\npersons. The barangay, like negara in other parts of the Malay World, focused on the chief or datu in a totally personal manner, the hierarchical and stable nature of this personal attachment was the essence of the social nexus. Without such a personal tie there was no access; individual initiative was not prized, and the greatest punishment one could suffer was to be expelled from the community or negara. In the century or century-and-one-half before the Europeans arrived, the year religion that began to affect change was Islam. Islamic merchants had undoubtedly advance in Southeast Asia in the late 7th or early 8th centuries. By this latter date there were already Moslem communities in China. In Southeast Asia, however, the conversion of local chiefs to Islam is generally dated in the late 13th century. The city of Malacca, which was founded about 1400 AD. and whose rulers converted to Islam some years later, is generally seen as the center from which Islam spread throughout the archipelago. This spread is closely associated with merchants. Again, the Philippines were at the far end of the islands stretching eastward from the Malay peninsula, but traders from Borneo and Sulawesi entered the area from the south, even before the founding of Malacca. These merchants and conveyors of the Faith were not native to the area, claiming instead origins in or a vague area to the west known as Arabia. The town of Jolo in the Sulu archipelago became a sultanate by the 15th century and welded the local barangay communities together into a more controlled state. Soon another sultanate was formed on Maguindanao with its center near the present-day city of Cotabato. These states were not socially different from earlier social arrangements except as social disfunctions became more sharply defined.\n\nAgricultural and forest products which had always formed the basis of the trade in the area were now augmented by an active slave trade. The coastal communities of the Visayas served as the supply source for slave raiders. On the northern island of Luzon, the area of Manila Bay over centuries had developed into an extensive agricultural and trading area. Contacts with China were old, but had never led politically or economically to much more than a confederation of barangay to regulate the exchange of local products such as honey, beeswax, livestock and exotic birds, food products, palm wine and sugar in exchange for porcelain and products. Probably around 1500 AD. this trade also began to be organized by Moslem merchants, either Chinese or Malay, and a more sophisticated route system was developed. It was this rather recent creation of a state that Legazpi encountered when the center of Spanish control in the Philippines was shifted from Cebu to Manila in 1571. With the arrival of Roman Catholicism, a\n\n17\n\ncompetition with Islam was started that would introduce the peoples of the Philippines to two of the world's great religious faiths, Islam and Catholicism. As the traditions of the barangay communities turn to the service of the new economic and religious orders, a new period was introduced into Philippine life.\n\nACTIVITY\n\nY\n\n3.1 (For Face-to-face class) Form two groups.

This marked the 500th anniversary of the so-called \"Age of Discovery,\" which was set in motion by Christopher Columbus' fateful voyage in 1492 leading to the \"discovery\" of what was to become the \"New World.\" In 1511, or roughly nineteen years after Columbus' landing on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean, the Crown of Portugal laid claim to Malacca halfway around the globe, in what is now Malaysia. This marked the beginning of European expansion in the region, described by historian Martin J. Noone as \"the great sprawling center of Asiatic commerce, legendary Chersonese, emporium of multitude of nations, Chinese, Arab, Hindu, Japanese, Siamese, and the island races of the southeast archipelago.\" Malacca was the principal distributing center for cloves, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg grown in the Moluccas, Sumatra and Mindanao. In 1509, Lisbon dispatched Diego Lopez de Sequiera to survey Malacca, on the belief that the Spice Islands were in the vicinity, and not in India as previously thought. Another ship, captained by a certain de Sousa, included among its officers Ferdinand Magellan, who had been an officer in the Portuguese possessions in India and Malacca, and his friend Francisco Serrano. The conquest of Malacca was the most spectacular development in this period, for this great entrepot was the key to \"the whole far eastern trade.\" The soldier of fortune Magellan switched his loyalties to Spain, assembled a fleet under his flagship Trinidad, and sailed on September 20, 1519 from San Lucar, Spain. On March 17, 1521, Magellan and his epoch-making expedition sighted ground on \"the Archipelago of San Lazaro,\" in what is now the island of Samar in the Philippines. This event would change the course of history forever in this part of the world, notably in the country that was to be called Las Islas Filipinas, after King Philip (Felipe) Il of Spain.\n\n18\n\nFor several generations of Filipinos, their first introduction to Philippine history was that the Philippines was discovered by Ferdinand Magellan and that the first Catholic mass was held on Limasawa, a tiny island south of Leyte. The \"Magellan myth\" would live on for centuries and every Philippine history book would invariably begin in 1521 with the \"discovery.\" Magellan's portrait or monument would grace public plazas or buildings. In Cebu today, the \"Magellan Hotel\" is a prominent landmark. Millions of Filipino parents would name their firstborn son Ferdinand. Meanwhile, the intrepid native leader on Mactan Island in Cebu, Lapu-lapu, who killed the interfering Magellan in battle, is largely forgotten. To Filipinos today, Lapu-Lapu is the name of a fish (red snapper). He is not seen or treated as a hero.\n\nFollowing the \"discovery\" of the islands, another conquistador, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, effectively annexed for Spain the newfound territory, creating in the process the primate city of Manila in 1571 as the center of conquest, consolidation, government, colonial culture, and conversion of the Indios (native population) to Christianity. The islands were, according to Spanish chronicler Antonio de Morga, subjected to \"the sovereign light of the holy Gospel,\" and the conquest was seen as the \"handiwork of His [King Philip's] Royal hands.\"\n\nFor the next three hundred years, this \"sovereign light\" would lead to not only one of the longest but also one of the cruelest colonial regimes in world history. The Spanish regime systematically destroyed native communities and their institutions. It brutalized the indios, making them work as forced labor in the government's various projects, or as indentured servants to friars or public officials. Above all, the Spaniards imposed an alien religion, Catholicism, on the population whose sacred native beliefs and shrines had to be destroyed and vanquished were viewed as savages or pagans who had to be civilized. In many cases, the indios would simply be killed outright. Genocide was a tool of conquest.\n\nFor three centuries, the Filipinos were prisoners and slaves in their own country, subject to every conceivable kind of exploitation and abuse. But over the years, the Spanish cruelty and abuses to the natives would be glossed over. The Spaniards would be credited in the history books as giving the Philippines a sense of national identity. The term Filipino, which\n\noriginally referred to Spaniards born in the Philippines (to distinguish them from those born in Spain, the peninsulares,) was gradually applied to all people in the country.\n\nThis was what the \"Age of Discovery\" meant to Filipinos in the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. It was not until the end of the 19th century that Filipinos regained their freedom, following more than 200 rebellions in several parts of the country, which culminated in the successful Philippine Revolution of 1896. The Filipinos proclaimed the first independent republic in Asia on June 12, 1898.\n\nIn seeking to recover the true Filipino history, we need to look more deeply into the pre-colonial milieu. The islands that Magellan supposedly discovered were always there. They had long been there with their own cultures and religions. They were going about in their own peaceful ways and traditions. Magellan simply stumbled upon them and upset the whole native ecology. The tribal people resisted the Westem intrusion. Lapu-lapu killed Magellan when the latter tried to intervene in a local feud. The people also assisted wholesale baptisms or conversions to Christianity. Mindanao was never effectively controlled by Spanish rule. The Moslem communities already had a sophisticated cultural system. Throughout the archipelago, uprisings against the Spaniards were undertaken by native Filipinos. They did not always win but they fought nonetheless.\n\nBut in a strange twist of fate, the Philippines was once more colonized by another imperial power, the United States of America, which \"bought\" the Philippines from Spain for $20 million, following the Treaty of Paris in December 1898. And this new colonial regime would last for another forty-eight years, with its ill effects still visible in the current life of the nation. As in the Spanish period, American colonial rule, essentially continued the pattern of socioeconomic exploitation of the Philippines with the collaboration of a native political elite. The Americans did not disturb the lopsided feudal social structure, even as they undertook programs for public education, public health, public service, communication and public works, and other trappings of modernization. The introduction of \"democracy\" is seen as the American legacy in the Philippines, but it was more nominal than real, because it had no economic basis. No meaningful socio-economic reforms were introduced by the American colonial regime.\n\nYet these were never really studied and made integral parts of institutionalized Philippine history. Filipinos were instead subjected to a process called \"cultural imperialism,\" in which idealized versions of Magellan and his fellow conquistadores holding the Cross on one hand and the Sword on the other were happily greeted by natives, who would later be baptized and given Christian names like Santos, de los Reyes, de la Cruz, and so on. However, the Philippines did not fall completely into the orbit of Spanish colonization and Filipinos retained their indigenous names — Tatlonghari, Punongbayan, Putong, Palpallatoc, Langit, Dait, Gamulo, etc.\n\nAcross the United States in 1992, the Columbus Quincentennial was observed with various activities, which sought to look into the impact of the \"Age of Discovery\" on countries affected by that upheaval five hundred years ago. The Philippines fell into that web of European territorial expansion. As Agoncillo notes, the highly independent barangays (native settlements) in mid16th century began to stagger under the impact of Spanish power and eventually lost their freedom.\n\nWe do not want to romanticize the natives and \"demonize\" the foreign conquerors, as it were. Unfortunately, there is nothing more that can be done to change the past. But we can certainly learn from it. And just as the groups in America currently rethinking Columbus want to dispel the biases and misrepresentations about the Western conquest that have been institutionalized, we on the other side of the globe who underwent a similar \"cultural encounter\" (usually a euphemism for conquest and domination) want to rethink Magellan and reconstruct our history correctly wherever we can.\n\nOur goal is to call attention to the need to know more about the indigenous populations and native cultures before the Western conquest. Philippine historiography leans heavily to the Spanish and American periods. Misrepresentations and distortions exist in historical records. Very few references exist on the pre-Hispanic, pre-colonial era when the Philippine communities then were scattered on the path of the advancing conquistadores. It is hoped that this effort to reshape our understanding of the Philippines will lead to more sophisticated or enlightened types of interpretations that recapture the sensitivities and perspectives of native Filipinos.\n\n19\n\nHistorical distortions and myths die very hard, if at all. It is these myths that our textbooks and institutions mindlessly repeat over the ages which have conditioned colonized peoples to accept injustice and inequality. The \"colonial mentality\" has resulted from this phenomenon that Filipino social critic Renato Constantino calls \"the miseducation of the Filipino.\"\n\nACTIVITY\n\nY\n\n3.2.

Negara/Nigeri- a state-like domain in the Malay world during pre-colonial times Malacca- a narrow strait in Indonesia that become an important trading entrepot during 18th century. Limasawa- a tiny island South of Leyte where the first Catholic Mass was held. Indios- a term of Christianized native Filipinos\n\nThe previous chapters celebrated the unconquered and free life of the Filipinos. It traced the glorious origin of the Filipino people. The preceding lesson likewise showed us the modest life of our ancestor prior to Western contacts. Part of the chapter also presented argumentation on the Battle of Mactan whether it would be credited as “The Defeat of Magellan” or “The Victory of the Filipino”. Meanwhile, this chapter presented some changes in the Philippine society with the coming of the Spaniards. Particularly, it includes articles tackling some economic and social changes in the Filipino life, like Galleon Trade and the Role of Cavite Inquilino. How the Manila-Acapulco Trade brought impact to the Filipinos and how Inquilinos played an imperative role in the native revolts are some of the things that this chapter about to unveil.\n\nAge of Discovery- era of navigation and exploration during 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries LEARNING OBJECTIVES Mactan- a small island of Sugbu which during the coming of Magellan was headed by an old Chief, Lapu-Lapu (the Slayer of Magellan).\n\nS\n\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:  Appreciate the Filipino culture prior to 1521 A.D.  Weigh the presentation of events during the coming of Magellan in the Philippines  Analyse why the Natives under Lapu-Lapu become triumphant against Magellan’s troop in the Battle of Mactan. 4.1 Silk Trade with Spain In 1573, only eight years after Legazpi conquered Cebú and established the first Spanish colony in the Philippines, and Urdañeta discovered a return route to Acapulco across the Pacific, Chinese silk began to be exported to the New World and a small quantity of it was subsequently re-exported via the port of Veracruz to the motherland, Spain. The production and consumption of silk was not unknown to the Spaniards, as sericulture and silk weaving spread via the Arab conquest to Andalusia in southern Spain in the first half of the eighth century. By the sixteenth century, imported woven silk cloths were still considered a luxury and available only to the royalty, nobility and wealthy merchant classes.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n25\n\nAccording to an account written in 1570, Relation of the Voyage to Luzon, when the Spaniards captured two Chinese junks off Mindoro they found many valuable goods including ‘silk, both woven and in skeins; gold thread, musk, and other curious articles. A regular trade in silk between the Chinese and Spanish empires began the following year, when Legazpi moved the colonial capital northwards to Luzon, where Manila was founded. This trade, based on the exchange of Chinese silk for New World silver, is described in a brief\n\nnarrative written by Legazpi’s notary Hernando Riquel and others, of the events of the Philippines between 1570 and 1573. A text described as a ‘Relation of what was brought by the two ships from the islands of the West’ written at the end of this narrative, which appears to have been added by the officials in Mexico, lists ‘712 pieces of all kinds of silks’ among a variety of goods brought by two ships that came from Manila in 1573. More importantly, it informs the King that ‘For their Majesties individually, are sent from those provinces many jewels and crowns of gold, with silks, porcelains, rich and large earthen jars, and other very excellent things which are sent by the chiefs in token of their allegiance’. This is the earliest textual reference of silks and porcelains being re-exported to Spain via the New World for members of the royal court in Madrid.\n\ndescription of the types and quality of silks and other textiles brought to Manila in the following decade or shortly after. He observes that ‘The goods which they usually bring, and sell to the Spaniards, are raw silk, in bundles, of the fineness of two strands, and other silk of inferior quality; fine untwisted silks, white and of all colors, in small skeins; quantities of smooth velvets, and velvet embroidered in all sorts of patterns, colours and fashions; and others, with the ground of gold and embroidered with the same; woven cloths and brocades of gold and silver upon silk of various colors and patterns, quantities of gold and silver thread in skein, upon thread and upon silk, but all the spangles of gold and silver are false and upon paper; damasks, satins, taffetas, and gorvarans, picotes, and other cloths of all colors, some finer and better than others; quantity of linen made of grass, which they call lençesuelo, and white cotton tablecloths of different kinds and sorts, for all sort of uses’.119 The raw silk, mostly from Zhejiang, as well as the various silk cloths mentioned by Morga, would most probably had been shipped by Chinese merchants from Canton or Zhangzhou.120\n\nSpanish textual sources provide information on the varied decorative styles of the woven silk cloths brought to the Philippines for trade at this time. Captain Diego the Artieda in his Relation of the Western Islands Called Filipinas of 1573, when referring to the Chinese, writes ‘They make gold into threads as is done in Milan, and weave raised designs of it on damasks and other silken fabrics’.106 Silk decorated with gold is also mentioned in a letter written by the royal treasurer in the Philippines, Guido de Lavezaris and others, to the Augustinian Friar Martin de Rada the following year, in 1574. This letter states that the native inhabitants ‘have a great deal of cloth with which to clothe themselves; many silken fabrics worked with gold, greatly esteemed and of high value; many porcelains and fine earthenware jars; … The Chinese bring them many silks, porcelains, and perfumes; with iron and other articles, from which they make great profits’.107 In all probability, the aforementioned silks are the same types as those mentioned earlier in Portuguese textual sources as being ‘embroidered with gold’ or ‘worked with gold’. We learn from a letter from Captain Juan Pacheco Maldonado to Philip II, to choke off trade to such extent that no Chinese wares will be consumed in this realm, since a man can clothe his wife in Chinese silks for 200 reales [25 pesos], whereas he could not provide her with clothing of Spanish silks with 200 pesos’.116 This may have been an exaggeration of the Viceroy, but it serves to illustrate the high price differential between these imported silks. In a memorial written in c.1602 by Fray Martin Ignacio de Loyola, Bishop of Rio de la Plata, he declares that ‘The trading in, and consignment of silver to, the Filipinas by the inhabitants of Mexico causes great detriment to the inhabitants of the islands; for, because of the Mexicans sending so much silver, the price of Chinese silks and merchandise has risen, so that, while for twenty years, when only the inhabitants of the islands were permitted to trade, they were wont to gain one thousand percent, now they do not gain one hundred, whence results much resentment in the Filipinas’.117\n\nRelations written by Spanish Jesuits in the early seventeenth century for the promotion of the Jesuit missionary work in Asia provide evidence of the silk-for-silver trade in Manila. For instance, Pedro Chirino (1557–1635) in his book Relación de las islas Filipinas published in Rome in 1604, gives a detailed account of the Jesuit activities in the Philippines from 1581 until his departure in 1602121 and reports that ‘From China they not only began to ship their riches in silks and glazed earthenware, as soon as they learned of our wealth of four and eight real pieces’.122 In 1603, only a year after his departure, the Chinese in Manila revolted and the authorities had to control and placate them. Another Jesuit, Adriano de las Cortes (1578–1629) in the account of his journey to China of 1626, where he spent eleven months in captivity after the galley that sailed from Manila wrecked on the coast of Guangdong while en-route to Macao, describes the ‘mercadurías’ (merchandising).123 He mentions that ‘Accounts made often and taken from the royal books reach its revenue each year to one hundred fifty and even sixty millions in gold, silver, musk, rice, silks and several other things’.124 From a pamphlet published in 1627 by Doctor Juan Oñes, who vigorously defended the participation of the clergy of Manila in the galleon trade, we learn that clerics participated directly in the silk trade but only on a small scale.125 Oñes stated that the clerics purchased a small quantity of silk, usually eight cases of (c.1530–?), who after living in Brazil and New Spain established himself in Manila in 1580 to trade in silk, porcelain, musk oil, spices and some Indian cottons, diamonds and other gems for the markets in New Spain, Peru and the Caribbean. Diogo, who was council of the Audiencia in Manila, was linked to the network of family businesses of his relatives in Lisbon, Porto, Goa and Brazil.136\n\nThe Spanish historian and politician António de Morga (1559–1636), first lieutenantgovernor of the Philippines (1595–1598) and later senior judge of its Audiencia (1598– 1603),118 in his Sucesos de las Filipinas published in Mexico in 1609, gives a more detailed\n\nBut beginning in 1608, the Crown granted the Manila government permission to send one vessel to Macao to purchase supplies. As the civil wars progressed in China after 1620, and Chinese junks began coming to Manila in fewer numbers, the Spanish became\n\n26\n\nincreasingly dependent upon Macao to supply the annual Manila Galleons with cargoes for the New World. For instance, a document regarding ‘News from the Province of Filipinas’, dated 1621, informs us that three galliots arrived from Macao in February ‘laden with a rich cargo of silks and other merchandise’ and that ‘At this same time the king’s ship arrived which had carried to Macau artillery for the defense of that city, and it brought back a cargo of silks’.137 In 1636, trade between Macao and Manila was officially severed by a royal decree. Portuguese ships, however, continued to make regular trips to Manila clandestinely until 1640, when Macao regained its independence from Spain and began a war with Manila.138 This is confirmed by the Jesuit Diego de Bobadilla, who in his Relation of the Filipinas Islands, written in 1640, reports ‘We trade also with the Portuguese of Macao, who come to the Manilas every year with two or three ships, and bring here silks, musk, precious stones, Bobadilla next gives a detailed description of the Chinese trade in silk and other valuable trade goods to Manila, stating that ‘The inhabitants of the Manilas also go to Macao sometimes, to carry their merchandise there; but their chief trade i"
