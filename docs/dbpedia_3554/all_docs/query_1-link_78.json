        "text": "We, students of World Citi Colleges, Caloocan Campus, taking Bachelor of Science major in Tourism Management, need to make a blog about the Tourism Industry of every province near Manila and advertise it and I am assigned to do a research here in Bulacan. Join me exploring the PRIDE OF BULACAN!\n\nHistory\n\nIT’S NAME:\n\nThe name “Bulakan” was derived from the Tagalog word “bulak” which is cotton in English. When the Spaniards first came to the country’s shore, they found cotton, among others, growing abundantly in many places in Luzon, particularly in Bulakan. Others claim its name from “Bulaklakan” which means flower garden owing to the teeming flora that used to cover Bulacan – bountiful plains, mountains & trees.\n\nEarly Agustinian missionary friars were so immediately enthralled by nature’s efflorescence in Bulacan that they described it as the garden of Luzon. Modern highways, subdivisions, commercial establishments and factories have banished many glorious scenes of this floral eden, but the glory of nature still survives in many spots. Others have remained as testaments of the flowering of the arts in bygone days.\n\nTHE IMPORTANT ROLE IT PLAYED IN PHILIPPINE HISTORY:\n\nBulacan figures prominently in Philippine History. The glory of Philippine History bespeaks of the glory that was Bulacan. It was among the first eight provinces to take up arms against Spain as colonial power during the Philippine Revolution of 1896.\n\nIt is the home to the birth of Three Republics:\n\nThe Kakarong Republic in 1896, 1st Republic of revolutionary forces was declared. A battle site where 3000 Katipuneros died at the hands of Spanish Soldiers;\n\nThe Biak-na-Bato Republic in 1897, 2nd Republic of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo; and\n\nThe Malolos Republic in 1898, 3rd and the most triumphant republic. This was the date when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo convene Malolos Congress that gave birth to the 1st Philippine Constitution through the 1st Constitution Convention.\n\nIT’S PEOPLE:\n\nBulacan is also known as “The Cradle of Noble Heroes”.\n\nIt is the birthplace of some of the greatest heroes of the Philippine Revolution against Spain: the greatest propagandist Marcelo H. del Pilar, Gen. Gregorio del Pilar, Anacleto Enriquez, Gen. Isidoro Torres, Maestro Eusebio Roque, Trinidad Tecson, Mariano Ponce, Maximo Viola, and other hail from Bulacan.\n\nARTS AND CULTURE:\n\n“History, nationalism and culture continually surface in a tour to Bulacan.”\n\nCountless fields sanctified by the blood of patriots. Bounties of the land celebrated in poems, paintings and songs. Mouth-watering kakanin, postres, ulam, old world pans and biscuits, longganisas and other specialities from a distant age. Beautiful ancestral houses, many of them unique. A long and enviable roster of national artists and other luminaries in the arts, and even national figures in politics.\n\nIt is difficult to arrive at a concise phrase to describe a province with such a long tradition of excellence.\n\nThese charming icons of the colonial past right at the doorstep of Manila became the lure of the province. For Filipinos whose memories of a glorious past had been rekindled by the centennial fervor, Bulacan signifies history and heritage. The province has no beaches or seaside resorts to attract the pleasure-seekers. Instead it fascinates with the richness of its culture. The abundance of traditional crafts still being created, or heirloom recipes still being cooked, of incidents in history still being told by living witnesses – these and other signs of the persistence of tradition convince the visitors that Bulakeños indeed take their cultural heritage seriously.\n\nHow, then, does one explore a provision as rich as Bulacan? Patience is needed – one cannot unravel the wealth of its heritage in one sweep.\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT FACTS:\n\nLand Area: 279,003 hectares\n\nCapital: Malolos\n\nMunicipal: 22\n\nCities: 2\n\nBarangay: 568\n\nMunicipal & Cities\n\nANGAT\n\nBALAGTAS\n\nBALIUAG\n\nBOCAUE\n\nBULACAN\n\nBUSTOS\n\nCALUMPIT\n\nDona Remedios Trinidad\n\nGUIGUINTO\n\nHAGONOY\n\nMALOLOS\n\nMARILAO\n\nMEYCAUAYAN\n\nNORZAGARAY\n\nOBANDO\n\nPANDI\n\nPAOMBONG\n\nPLARIDEL\n\nPULILAN\n\nSAN ILDEFONSO\n\nSan Jose Del Monte\n\nSAN MIGUEL\n\nSAN RAFAEL\n\nSTA MARIA\n\nTourist Attractions\n\nMEYCAUAYAN\n\nOld Malhacan Church\n\n-400 yr.
