Charles E. DeLand vice president and acting president pre- siding. Dr. W. Herbert Thrall delivered the invocation. The meeting was devoted chiefly to exercises in memory of DeLorme W. Robinson, M. D., late president of the society, whose death occurred on September 26, 1910. President DeLand read a sketch of the life of Dr. Robinson and addresses were made by Rev. Hanford L. Russell, Pattison F. McClure, Rev. Mr. Ander- son of Huron, Dr. W. Herbert Thrall, Charles L. Hyde, John Sutherland, John Hayes and Dr. Miller, of Brookings. W. Herbert Thrall was elected a member of the executive committee to fill the unexpired term of Charles Mott Daley, who has left the state and Thomas L. Riggs, Robert F. Kerr, Gary T. Notson and Charles B. Billinghurst were elected to the regular terms expiring in 1917. GENERAL PROGRESS The work of the Department of History has in the very nature of things assumed a routine from which it is difficult to depart. The entire force is required to do from day to day the work which accumulates in recording and classifying the vital statis- tics, the correspondence, the legislative reference work, the ar- rangement of the newspapers and the accessions of books, perio- dicals and pamphlets, making it quite impossible under existing conditions to branch out into the inviting historical fields await- ing cultivation. During the biennium but one change has occurred in the of- ficial staff; on October 1, 1911, Mr. Thomas Askin, former as- sistant librarian, in charge of the legislative reference division resigned and Miss Ida Anding, who has for six years been the efficient assistant to the secretary and superintendent, was pro- moted to the position. Mr. Stanley Stevenson, a young gentle- man who desires to make northwestern history his life work, and who has specialized in historical work has been chosen to fill the position vacated by Miss Anding 's promotion. The pres- ent staff is therefore : Ida M. Anding, assistant librarian, in charge of Legislative Reference. Stanley Stevenson, stenographer, assistant to secretary and superintendent. Florence H. Brown, recording clerk, in charge of vital statis- tics. Mary Hardy, index clerk in charge of newspapers and acces- sions. The Library. The state library has made a very satisfactory growth, chief- ly from exchanges; and the purchase of a select list of very im- portant works. The space in the capitol assigned to the library SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 11 is already crowded to its capacity and it will be necessary at once to make provision for the natural expansion of this im- portant, feature of state work. It is recommended that one of the large rooms in the basement be finished and shelved for the purpose. Already more than ten thousand important volumes in- cluding many in daily use are stored in this basement and two years ' use ,of the rooms shows that they are sufficiently dry for the safe preservation of printed matter. The finishing and shelving of additional book room is a most urgent matter and the legisla- ture is requested to make provision for the same. The Census. Under the constitutional provision and chapter 63 of the laws of 1905, making it effective, the state census must be taken in the year 1915. It is therefore important that the next legislature make provision for the necessary preliminary work, looking to the taking of the third census of South Dakota. If this is left to the legislature of 1915 the time will be too short to get out the necessary printed forms in time to have the census taken by the assessors at the time of assessing the property of the state. It is therefore recommended that the coming legislature make the necessary provision for the printing of blanks to be used in the census of 1915. These funds should be available in the year 1914. The Legislative Reference. The Legislative Reference work is of growing importance and is not only valuable to the many members of the legislature who avail themselves of its assistance, but state and county officials and citizens generally apply to it constantly for information and assist- ance. Exhaustive indexes make the vast accumulation of au- thorities readily available and this index system is being -extended «s fast as the time of the director will permit. Likewise the divi- sion has been constantly resorted to in the matter of drawing legis- lative bills and it is a source of gratification to state that thus far no law enacted from a bill drawn by the division has been attacked or found defective. The Historical Society. The division of the Historical Society presents the materials of history contained in this volume as a portion of the work it has accomplished during the past biennium, through the efforts of the officers and interested contributors. Extensive additions have 12 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS been made to unpublished collections and to the gallery of port- raiture. We are happy in the possession through gift and loan of a goodly number of oil portraits of distinguished citizens and thus the foundation has been laid for a state gallery of the utmost permanent value. The state library has grown beyond the possibility of proper indexing and care by the present limited force, and it is urgently recommended that a trained librarian be employed to give it ex- clusive attention. Certainly it is not too much to ask the great state of South Dakota to employ one person at a barely nominal salary to care for its splendid library of nearly 35,000 volumes. TENTH ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF SOUTH DAKOTA, 1910 Perhaps the most striking feature of the year 1910 in South Dako- ta has been rather unusual weather conditions. The year opened with moderately cold weather with considerable snow and these conditions continued until the latter part of February, when the snow disappear- ed and glorious summer weather came on and continued for more than fifty days. Most of the seeding was done; ground prepared for planting corn; many gardens were planted; grass started and the trees burst into full leaf more than a month before the usual season and fruit trees were loaded with bloom when on the llth of April a hard storm came with hard freezing quite destroying the fruit and foliage of trees but not otherwise affecting crops. The season continued er- ratic, many attributing the unusual conditions to the influence of Halley's comet which was visible during the spring. The rainfall dur- ing the growing months was much below the average and came gen- erally in local showers in a way that would afford an abundance to one neighborhood while adjacent territory suffered from drouth. The utmost apprehension was felt for the welfare of the crops and it was before the harvest thought that only a partial crop could be secured, and while this proved true in many localities, as a whole the state produced a fair return, though of course not up to the average of a series of years. The erratic weather conditions and drouth areas gave splendid* op- portunities for testing the efficacy of dry farming methods and without exception, where these scientific methods were pursued early enough to find a sufficient supply of moisture in the soil, the methods conserved this moisture and made a good crop. The table herewith shows the uneven distribution of precipitation a,t representative points, both by months and by localities.

For several years there has been a marked dis- agreement between this division and the federal department of Agri- culture upon the wheat and corn crops of South Dakota. The federal department credits us with more wheat and less corn than does this office. We believe this is due to the rapid change from wheat growing to corn culture in many counties; a change so radical that the govern- ment has not kept up with it. The basis of the disagreement of the two offices is entirely a matter of acreage. A Comparison. The only crop estimates that can be completely checked are those upon wheat and flax for except the amount reserved for bread and seed, all of these crops are shipped to markets beyond the state and can therefore be checked, almost to a bushel. It is there- fore interesting to compare the estimates of the state census and the government department of agriculture with the actual crop as de- termined after shipment. The table herewith gives this information for the period of nine years, that is for 1901 to 1909 inclusive: Year Government State Actual Crop 1901 ... . 51,662,000 39,000 000 41,579,000 :902 43 972 000 46,950,000 42,721,000 1903 47 252 000 45 266,000 45,530,000 1904 31,453,000 24,150,000 24,183,000 1905 44,133,0-00 43,110,000 36,266,000 1906 41,955,000 39,494,000 39,917,000 1907 32 480,000 30.292,000 32,781,000 1908 37,862,000 35,882,000 36,545,000 1909 '. 47,588,000 40,875,000 41,437,000 Totals 378,358,000 344,919,000 341,150,000 Thus it will be observed that for the totals of nine years the es- timates of the state census upon wheat has in the average been much more correct than has been the national approximation and the suc- cess in wheat estimating, gives much confidence in the estimates of other crops which cannot be so accurately checked, but to which the same careful methods are applied. SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 15 This Year's Estimates. The estimates upon the principal crops given herewith are made as in previous years upon the basis of the state census of 1905 modified by the views of about six hundred intel- ligent persons who replied to inquiries addressed to them in every county of the state. In addition the superintendent has visited most of the crop growing regions and secured many testimonies to add to his own observations: 16 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS CROP ESTIMATES FOR 1910 COUNTIES CORN WHEAT Acres Bushels Acres Bushels 560,000 650,000 810,000 1,206,000 1,645,000 312.IMX) 40000 15,000 532,000 915,000 1,170,000 385,000 1,040,000 10.000 59-',000 2,340,000 720.000 810,000 720.000 7.000 700,000 1.065,000 525,000 845,000 750,000 660,000 36,000 1,404,000 72000 300,000 1,120,000 . 990,000 45.0JO 756,000 40,000 936,000 692,000 720,000 55,000 600,000 560,000 880,000 90,000 500,000 1,260,000 504.000 2,160,000 60.000 250,01)0 660,000 875.000 336,000 435.000 Aurora 42,000 59,000 190,000 55,000 70,000 60,000 3,000 6,000 23,000 145,000 15,000 125,000 4,000 1.000 50,000 6,000 17.000 57,000 7,500 -7000 15,000 21.000 60,000 18,000 47,000 60,000 8,000 115,000 8,000 28,000 43,000 55,000 3,500 125,000 15,000 95,000 4,500 12.500 10,000 37,000 135,000 75,000 7.500 11.000 18,000 47,000 43,000 30.000 15,000 125,000 110.000 15,000 115,000 2,469,500 1,040,000 1,475,000 7,600,000 1,815,000 1,050,000 1,800,000 90.000 60,000 460,000 3,625,000 475,000 5,0(X),000 100,000 20.000 1,400,000 150,000 510.000 1,995,000 150,000 140.000 300,000 630.000 1,500.000 630,000 846,000 1,800,000 80.000 4,015,000 120,000 420,000 1,075,000 1,650,000 70,000 5,000,000 225,000 2,850,000 67,500 250,000 i 100,000 1,110,000 4,725,000 2,625,000 112.500 165,000 450,000 940,000 860,000 300.000 300,000 5,000,000 4.400.000 300,000 4,600,000 76,471,000 46,000 50,000 45,000 67,000 235,000 26,000 3.000 5,000 76,000 61,000 78,000 17,500 65,000 750 37,000 180,000 40.000 45,000 90,000 500 85,000 71.000 35,000 65,000 75,000 44,000 4.500 78,000 9,000 30,0:K) 85,000 55,001) 4,500 36,000 5,000 52,000 87,000 90,000 11,000 40.000 28,000 40,000 15 0(K) 50,000 105,000 36,000 240,000 10,000 25,000 30,000 35.000 42,000 25,000 Beadle _ _ _ Bon Homme _ Brookings Brown Brule Buffalo Butte Campbell .

Fruit and Potatoes. The fruit crop of all sorts is pretty nearly a failure due to the hard freeze in April. Potatoes are a very short crop this year everywhere in the state, in some portions being quite a failure. Dairy Products. It is likely that the total production of dairy products is less than for several years, though it is difficult to obtain entirely reliable figures. The prices however have advanced and the revenue therefrom is somewhat increased. The egg crop is bigger than ever before and returns more cash. Wool. I use the estimates of the National Association of wool manufacturers upon the wool crop of the state. Their figures are somewhat larger than the number of sheep reported in the assess- ment would seem to justify, but the wool is reported to be actually shipped from here. The explanation is that perhaps a good many sheep on the ranges escape the assessor. Minerals. The lockout in the Homestake mine early in the year resulted in a marked decrease in the mineral production of the year. Hay. The hay crop is perhaps one third below the average in volume but the value is not materially affected. In comparing the hay estim- ates of this department with those of the Agricultural department of the government remember the government does not take account of our very valuable crop of wild hay. General Summary. The total products of the soil of South Dako- ta for 1910 are estimated by this department as follows: Wheat 35,360,000 bushels $27,580,000 Corn 76,471,000 bushels 26,765,000 Oats 41,287,000 bushels 11,147,000 Barley 18,593,000 bushels 11.342,000 Speltz 3,500,000 bushels 800,000 Flax seed 4,000,000 bushels 8,840,000 Rye 600.000 bushels 372,000 Grass, clover and alfalfa seed 100,000 Potatoes, vegetables and fruit 3,000,000 Hay 2,750,000 tons 19,000,000 Dairy products 8,750,000 Poultry and eggs 6,000,000 Honey 30,000 Livestock 49,137,000 Wool and hides 825,000 Mineral and stone . 7,500.000 Total 1910 $181,188,000 Total 1909 . 202,362,000 Decrease $ 21,174,000 The decrease will be found to be chiefly in the items of wheat, corn, oats, potatoes and fruit and is due to reduced yield and smaller price for the cereals and a failure for fruit and potatoes. SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 19 However the decrease only indicates a smaller degree of great pros- perity for apportioned to a population of 550,000 it gives $327.27 per capita and retains for us supremacy in per capita production of the fruits of the soil. Markc'tins; for Year. The railroads operating within the state have again reported to me the actual amount of the products of the state which they have carried to markets beyond the state line from v hich returns we derived the following table of the actual marketings of our people for the year ending June 30th, 1910, being chiefly of the crop of 1909: Wheat 35,976,742 bushels worth $28,781,393 Corn 11,307.179 bushels worth 4,523,871 Oats 10.872,633 bushels worth 3,261,789 Barley 16,164,000 bushels worth 9,668,009 Rye 159.000 bushels worth 95,400 Flax seed 4,534,477 bushels worth 9,976,849 Hogs 161.755,000 pounds worth 11,322,850 Cattle 497,487,000 pounds worth 27,610,520 Horses 26,159,000 pounds worth 2,115,990 Sheep 26,138,800 pounds worth 1,045,552 Dairy products, poultry, eggs, hides, wool and vegetables 20,000,000 Total-marketings 1910 $118.402,214 Total marketings 1909 123,706,000 Decrease 1910 $ 5,303,000 It is noteworthy that this decrease in revenue is almost exactly reflected in the difference in the increase of bank deposits for the two years; that is to say we had so much less money to place in the banks. state 1 i nances. The condition of the state treasury has not chang- ed much during the past year, when the registered capitol building v arrants are considered.

The capitol warrants will ultimately be paid from the proceeds of the land sales. General Finances. The people generally are forehanded and liv- ing in exceptional comfort; paying current bills with reasonable promptness, and are buying more conservatively than for several 20 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS years. It has been a year of liquidation rather than expansion. Much land purchased five years ago upon deferred payment has been paid for out of accumulated savings and this has reduced deposits in some sections while increasing them in others. Bank Deposits.

The primary and general campaigns have made this a political year, the interest in which was augmented by the submis- sion of six constitutional amendments and the referendum of several laws. The primary campaign opened early in the year through the disagreement of the Stalwart and Progressive wings of the republican party and the independent candidacy for the governorship of George W. Egan of Sioux Falls. Each faction placed a complete ticket in the field and made a vigorous campaign. The stalwart ticket consisted of Charles H. Burke and Eben W. Martin for renomination for con- gress, Samuel H. Elrod for governor, Joseph W. Parmley for lieuten- ant governor; Charles J. Dousman, secretary of state; George G. John- son, treasurer; H. B. Anderson, auditor; Titus Price, attorney general; A. H. Seymour, superintendent of public instruction; W. G.. Smith, railroad commissioner. The progressive ticket was Thomas Thorson and John P. Schrader for congress; Robert S. Vessey, governor; Prank M. Byrne, lieutenant governor; Samuel C. Policy, secretary of state; A. W. Ewert, treasurer; John Bibelhiemer, auditor; Royal Johnson, attorney general; F. F. Brinker, land commissioner; C. G. Lawrence, superintendent of schools; W. - E. Benedict, railroad commissioner. The stalwarts nominated congressmen, auditor, treasurer and rail- road commissioner, and the progressives, governor, lieutenant gov- ernor, secretary of state, attorney general, land commissioner and superintendent of public instruction. The vote upon governor was as follows: Egan 21,446; Vessey 26,372. The democrats placed in nomination W. W. Soule and John E. Kelley for congress; Chauncey L. Wood for governor; A. L. Davenport, lieutenant governor; John T. Cogan, secretary of state; attorney general, W. A. Lynch; auditor, David M. Finnegan; treasurer, Albert A. Boynton; land commissioner, F. B. Raymond; superintendent, P. F. Nolan; railroad commissioner, Warren Young. The prohibitionists and socialists also placed tickets in the field. The entire republican ticket was elected. Ellison G. Smith and James H. McCoy were re-elected to the supreme court with- out opposition. Constitutional Amendments. Constitutional amendments provid- ing for equal suffrage, the leasing of school lands for agricultural pur- poses; requiring all laws for the creation of new state institutions to be submitted to popular vote; providing the attorney general's sal- ary shall be fixed by law; allowing the earnings of corporations to be considered in fixing the face value of corporate property for taxation, all of which were defeated. Refererendum Laws. There were also submittetd the following laws upon referendum: County option of liquor traffic; providing electric headlights for all locomotives; for licensing embalmers; a military code; dividing the state into two congressional districts, all of which were defeated. Public Buildings. The new capitol was occupied by the state offi- cers in May and formally dedicated on June 30th. The splendid new SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 25 \"Women's Building\" at the State Hospital for the Insane was dedi- cated in January. There have been many notable business blocks and private build- ings erected. At Pierre the new St. Charles Hotel is palatial and the new Methodist church noteworthy. The public building at Lead is completed and the Huron building will soon be under way. Railroads. The Northwestern railroad has completed the Blunt to Gettysburg connection and placed it in operation, as well as the Belle Fourche Valley line from Belle Fourche to Newell. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul line has completed the Moreau River division from Mobridge to Isabel and the Cheyenne River line from Mobridge to Dupree. Public Health. The state has been free from any noteworthy con- tagion during the year and the public health has been good maintain- ing the high distinction accorded us by the National Bureau of vital statistics as the healthiest state in the Union and consequently the healthiest anywhere. Necrology. The vital statistics records show that 4,511 deaths oc- curred in 1909 or 8.4 to each thousand of population within the or- ganized counties. For the present year the statistics are not yet avail- able but the rate is not materially different. Since Jan. 1st last several persons of statewide reputation have died, among them the following: January 1. Frank L. Fuller, Pierre, formerly county treasurer Hughes county. February 8, Edward C. Ericson, Elk Point, President Regents of Education. March 7, William O. Amphlett, clerk of courts, Marshall county. April 3, Dr. Charles B. Mallory, Aberdeen, former President State Medical Association. May 8, Gilbert Thoreson, Dell Rapids, state senator Minnehaha county. June 1, Freeman Knowlrs, Deadwood, former member of congivss. June 13, John A. Pickler, Faulkton, former member of congress. June 14, H. O. Besancon, Blunt, long editor Blunt Advocate. July, 20, Virgil T. Price, postmaster at Rapid City. September 2G, Dr. De Lonne W. Robinson, Pierre, president State Historical Society. October 29, Beotius H. Sullivan, Plankintion, former surveyor general. November 5, Mrs. Sutton E. Young, Plankinton, matron State Training School. 26 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS November 26, Titus E. Price, Yankton, three times representative in Legislature. Public Morals. The year has been notably free from events shock- ing to the public conscience. Conclusion. The people of South Dakota approach the close of the year 1910 with gratitude to God for the blessings He has so unceas- ingly showered upon them and with firm reliance upon the same Provi- dence for future favors. DOANE ROBINSON, Secretary. Pierre, December 1, 1910. ELEVENTH ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF SOUTH DAKOTA, 1911 The year 1911 has presented some rather unusual features, es- pecially in its climatic development. The New Year brought the se- verest storm of many years with 20 below zero temperature followed by six months of unusual drought culminating in late June with the greatest continuous heat experienced at any time since records have been maintained in the vicinity. In July normal conditions were re- stored and have since continued but the erratic weather of the first half of the year naturally resulted in vast injury to the small grain crop, and reduced the yield of hay and in some sections affected corn.

Contrary to the usual custom of this department we have not this year attempted to make an independent estimate of the crop production of the year. So vast an area of the tillable lands planted last spring were not harvested, that with the facilities at our command it would have been exceedingly difficult and unsatisfactory to have attempted such an approximation and we have therefore adopted the final figures for the state at large, for yields of cereals 28 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS and potatoes, put out by the National Department of Agriculture, as follows: Wheat, 15,184,000 bushels $13,058,240 Corn, 51,854,000 bushels 20,741,600 Oats, 12,048,000 bushels 4,819,200 Barley, 5,900,000 bushels 4,425,000 Flax seed, 3,688,000 bushels 6,734,000 Potatoes, 4,032,000 bushels 3,628,800 Other grains and seeds 500,000 Total of government estimates on crops $53,906,840 Our estimates on other products — Vegetables and fruits 1,500,000 Hay, 2,300,000 tons 16,100,000 Dairy products 7,500,000 Poultry and eggs 6,500,000 Livestock 44,275,000 Wool and hides 1,000,000 Mineral and stone . 8,500,000 Total other products of agriculture, etc. — ; — 85,375,000 Total products of the earth, 1911 $139,281,840 Total for 1910 181,188,000 Decrease $41,906,160 Approximating the population of the state at 600,000 the per capita production of new wealth in 1911 amounts to $296. Marketings. Each railroad operating in South Dakota has again reported the total amount of the staple products carried by it from South Dakota to markets outside of the state for the fiscal year end- ing June 30, 1911. These marketings of course being chiefly the pro- ducts of the year 1910.

There has been but one bank failure of significance. The formerly very strong Meade County Bank of Sturgis, was compelled to suspend pay- ment on December 26th, owing to two successive crop failures in the region and the withdrawal of the troops from Fort Meade, which had resulted in the general demoralization of business there. State Government. The Biennial legislature sat upon January 3rd and upon that date Governor Vessey entered upon his second term. SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 31 The new state officers who first qualified at that time were Frank M. Byrne, lieutenant governor; Henry B. Anderson, auditor; Carl G. Lawrence, superintendent of public instruction, and P. F. Brinker, commissioner of school and public lands. The legislature sat for sixty days. No new policies were inaugurated and there was no leg- islation of exceptional interest. The provision for the maintenance of the state and its institutions was the chief interest.

Public Morals. There has been no notable infraction of public morals during the year. The commonwealth has been free from riot and insurrection. The labor troubles in the Black Hills were settled before the beginning of the year and the mining industry has in con- sequence gone forward without interruption and with large returns. SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 33 Public Health. There has been no serious contagion and no epi- demic sickness among the people and generally the public health has been excellent. Necrology.

There has been less building than for several preced- ing years, although in seme sections, there has been a vast building development. The Helen G. McKennon Hospital at Sioux Falls, dedi- cated on December 15th, is one of the most noteworthy. There has been practically no railroad building. The new depot built by the Milwaukee Company at Aberdeen is a fine structure. A Grateful People. The citizens of South Dakota approach another year with large hope for physical and moral prosperity and grateful to the Giver of all good gifts for the favors vouchsafed to them. Pierre, January 1, 1912. DOANE ROBINSON, Secretary. Dr. Robinson's Last Photograph DE LORME WILSON ROBINSON, M. D. By Chas. E. DeLand Dr. DeLorme Wilson Robinson, the subject of this sketch, was born at Pulaski, Pennsylvania, October 26, 1854, and died at Pierre, South Dakota, September 26, 1910. His early education culminated at Wooster University. Thereafter he graduated from the Kentucky School of Medicine, at Louisville, Kentucky, in 1882, with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Immediately upon completing his course in medicine, and imbued with the idea of development in his chosen profession in- the teeming West, he came to Pierre, where he continued to reside and to pursue his life-work until death summoned him while in the harness of large and maturing activities. He was the honored head of the State Historical Society of South Dakota when that summons came. In his demise a serious loss was occasioned, not only to his immediate family and kindred, but to the city of his adoption and the principal scene of his long and valued labors, and to the state for whose welfare he had done so much in the line of his profession, in an official and semi-official capacity. Those activities, as regards the state at large, comprised eminent services in the process of laying deep and permanent foundations concerning the public health, and in historical research. The formal honors which had from time to time been be- stowed upon Dr. Robinson comprised appointments to the fol- lowing positions: President and Superintendent of the State Hoard of Health; consulting surgeon of St. Mary's Hospital at Pin-re; division surgeon of Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company; and President of the State Historical Society, of which association he had long been an active and valuable mem- ber, inclusive also of membership upon its executive commit- tee. He was elected several times as a member of the City Coun- cil of Pierre, having served in that body from December 20, 1889, until May 1, 1891. He was also a member of the following 36 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS named societies: American Medical Association; National As- sociation of Railway Surgeons; American Anti-Tuberculosis So- ciety; State Medical Society of South Dakota, and President of the Fourth District Medical Society of South Dakota. Indicative of the high regard for and the great esteem in which Dr. Robinson was held by the South Dakota State Medi- cal Association, the following resolutions, adopted by that or- ganization, upon the occasion of his death, will attest: \"To the will of an overruling Providence which has removed from our midst our beloved and skilled practitioner, who for more than a quarter of a century was an honored and distin- guished figure in the medical profession in the state and locality where he lived, we bow in sorrow and submission. \"The medical profession of the State of South Dakota with one accord upon the occasion of so great a public bereavement, desiring to honor the memory of our departed brother, and shar- ing the grief of the state and community, as an expression of their regard and reverence for his public and private virtues and distinguished career, do hereby \"Resolve, That we profoundedly and thoroughly appreciate the private worth and domestic virtues, as well as the public ser- vice, of our late fellow practitioner, Dr. DeLorme Wilson Rob- inson, a man who by his simplicity of life and manners and his devotion to medicine and surgery, won the hearts of the people, and rose from small beginnings to the heights of honor and fame. And we feel that the memory of his character for integrity and unswerving fidelity to his convictions, during all the vicissitudes of a long medical career, and his endeavor and faithful, ener- getic life, will ever be treasured as a priceless heritage by a people whom he so long and so devotedly served. \"And Be it Further Resolved, That a copy of these reso- lutions be published and spread upon the minutes of this Society, and also presented to his family, with the assurance of profound sympathy in their deep personal afflictions, and with the express- ion of the sincere condolence of this Society.\" Dr Robinson was cut down in the very flower of his pro- fessional usefulness, in the dual sense of his marked efficiency as a general medical practitioner, and his special and eminent faculties as a surgeon and as the leading spirit in promoting SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 37 the efficiency and large usefulness of St. Mary's Hospital at Pierre — an institution with whose founding and early struggles for permanent footing he was so conspicuously connected as to have earned the honor of being, from the standpoint of the physician and surgeon, its virtual founder. For it was this self- same home for the sick and seat of charitable solicitude for the afflicted which had for many years been so near his heart and so completely in the eye of his ambitions as to have absorbed in great measure his professional activities and his yearnings as humanitarian. Indeed, he was known to have many times ex- pressed the thought that that institution was far more vitally connected with his later life-work than any other for which he did or could labor. He early saw the needs of establishing at some central point in the young Commonwealth a hospital whose influence for good in ministering to the wants of humanity under physical affliction should become potential, and wrhich would thereby develop into a prominent landmark in the community and a lasting memorial to the credit of those who laid its foun- dations and nurtured it into masterful influence. How well he succeeded in realizing this cherished hope and expectation the now marked prestige and high character of that Hospital is am- ple evidence. In turn, the gratitude and undying remembrance of a host of patients whose ills have already been alleviated through the able ministrations of the corps of management of that institution — many of whom were brought from long dis- tances— have been and will continue to be manifested towards the authorities and assistants of St. Mary's Hospital, and among those of whose skilled labors those sufferers have been bene- ficiaries none held so high a place as did Dr. Robinson. In the field of history Dr. Robinson performed notable and I n-manently valuable services for South Dakota and the North- west. At such times as his professional duties wrould permit he found deep pleasure and peculiar satisfaction in investigating facts relating 1<> the Sioux and North Indian tribes; and sonic of his biographies and estimates of prominent Indian chiefs are among the best to be found in that class of literature. In this line of work, as everywhere else, he applied a mentality which intuit- ively entered into the basic features of the subject and exhib- ited a fitness of judgment and discrimination which character- 38 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS ize his every effort and render his services of peculiar value. His style is clear, concise and interesting, his treatment exhaust- ive and masterful. In the assembling and arrangement of the materials of history there is demanded — we use the word advis- edly— the combined faculties of rejection, subordination of ele- ments, and of judgment concerning the significance of the final results of the sifting and arranging process. To these must be added the necessity of more or less frequent descent to labored effort — sometimes long-drawn to the test of patience — to dis- cover amid the poverty of historic material available upon the particular point under consideration, further and convincing proofs of some fact which is vital to some phase of the subject. Dr. Robinson understood the character and significance of the responsibility resting upon the investigator who must find and the narrator who must use such rare materials in doing the work of a true historian ; and his handiwork proves his fidelity to these truths. Among his efforts of a historical character are his volumin- ous and comprehensive \"Editorial Notes\" on Dr. William Black- burn's \"Historical Sketch of North and South Dakota.\" Those labors required treatment of many and diverse subjects connect- ed with the settlement, pioneer struggles and development of communities, and the contact of whites with Indian tribes, re- ferred to briefly in the main \"Historical Sketch,\" and involved accounts of the Dakota or Sioux Nation of Indians and other Indian tribes, including the pre-historic Aricaras and Mandans; of various military campaigns against the Indians; of various missionaries and missions among the Indians ; of numerous biog- raphies of leading Indian chiefs; of various treaties with the Dakotas ; of the earliest settlements in the Winnipeg country, on the Missouri river and many of its branches, around and south ward from the lakes on the eastern border of the two states in question, and other localities within their territory; of many of the characters and rival concerns of the fur-trading era ; of prom- inent men and officials whose activities were so closely connect- -ed with the history of the two Dakotas as to have actively enter- ed into their material, legislative, executive and judicial devel- opment and administration ; of early explorers and expeditions, and of the conflicts of interests springing up in consequence of SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 39 occupation and appropriation of local territory and its exploit- ation by representatives and citizens or subjects of the United States, France, and England; of the military and trading posts of the regions involved; and other phases not enumerable here — all illustrative and explanatory of Dr. Blackburn's references, topical and otherwise, to historical elements which, because of his work being but an outline history, needed such treatment MS was bestowed upon them by Dr. Robinson in order to con- tinue and complete the expansion of fact and conclusion there- on, into details, as well as to perform the inevitable part of correcting here and there an error in the principal text — a func- tion summoned forth from the commentator by every effort of the historical writer past, present, and to come, howsoever able and painstaking may be the work which is being annotated. It is believed to be entirely within bounds to declare of Dr. Robinson's brilliant labors in that connection that, whereas the \"Sketch\" itself is as an outline history a masterful and monu- mental repository of fact and comment such as only a com- prehensive and lively mind like that of Dr. Blackburn could produce, the supplementary work performed by Dr. Robinson gives the whole subject that treatment in essential detail which is necessary to make a complete history in the better sense, and with the aid of which that subject is indeed exhaustively and Luminously dealt with. It may perhaps be fairly said that those \"Editorial Notes\" constitute the most labored and valuable of all the historical work performed by Dr. Robinson. They have certainly laid the two Dakotas under deep and lasting obliga- tions to the willing heart and trained mind of the donor of those Notes; and the entire Northwest is a substantial beneficiary thereof. Dr. Robinson further contributed to the historical annals of the Northwest through a valuable paper into the spirit of which his large abilities as physician entered deeply, entitled \"Smallpox Among Indians in Fur Trading Days,\" published in the \"Monthly South Dakotan\" in 1899. That paper narrated the successive visitation of the dreaded smallpox among the In- dians of the Missouri Valley and the farther Mountains and ex- tending into Canada and eastern Minnesota, and embracing the periods of its ravages from 1734 to 1874. 40 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS In his paper entitled \"Prehistoric Fortifications at Pierre/' published in the same periodical in 1898, Dr. Robinson enters into critical and interesting account of the locally famous forti- fied plateau some seven miles below Pierre on the northern bluffs of the Missouri river; and, after comparing this with other pre- historic earthworks in the Missouri and Mississippi valleys, he reasons upon the question as to who were the builders — whether they were \"the ancient ancestors of the red men of the Colum- bian time,\" or \"the red man himself as known in present his- tory,\" or \"conquerors of a different race of men now entirely extinct.\" And while expressing the view that the then existing information left this question in much doubt, he recognizes the possibility of their extinction by the Aricaras, but does not com- mit himself to any specific theory which would refer them to any known tribe or race of red men. It may perhaps be observed without impropriety, that at various times subsequent to the publication of his paper last mentioned, and notably in 1908, in discussion between the writ- er of this sketch and Dr. Robinson concerning the earthworks in question and other so-called prehistoric trenches or ditches in the Missouri valley in this state, Dr. Robinson expressed him- self as strongly inclined to the belief that all of these remains were probably the handiwork of the same race of men, and that it wras very probable that they were the work of the Aricaras, or theirs in part and partly that of other Indian races who had preceded the Aricaras. A paper entitled \"Dakota for the Health-Seeker and Home- Seeker, A Climatic Sketch,\" prepared by Dr. Robinson,- was pub- lished in the \"Monthly South Dakotan\" in 1898; wherein the climatic elements of the Dakotas are treated in a comprehensive manner and without exaggeration. The proper altitudes, the at- mospheric conditions, the topography east and west of the Mis- souri Divide, the different phases of the artesian basin and their water productions, the excellent qualities of the waters of the surface streams, the comparative shortness and freedom from snows of the winter seasons, the abundance of sunshine, the condition of settlements in the newer sections of these states, the opportunities awaiting the immigrant — are dealt with in brief but pointed review and in a spirit of fairness and of con- SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 41 fidence in the aggregate wealth of the primitive resources of the region in question. The reader would be very likely to be con- vinced of the probity of the discussion and its freedom from any attempt toward undue exploitation. But in his biographical study — it is more than a sketch — of Dr. William Maxwell Blackburn, Dr. Robinson has, it is believed, outdone all of his other mental efforts, in an attempt, attended with signal success, to comprehend and measure the large in- tellect and the life-work of such a man and teacher as was Dr. Blackburn. In that paper, which appeared in the \"Monthly South Dakotan\" in 1899, he traces with a fidelity which only one who knew somewhat familiarily the subject of the study, the striking and active personality, the graces and power as pulpit orator and lecturer, the beginnings and successive stages of the great career as student, preacher, author and tutor, the unswerving adherence to the dictates 6f conscience and con- viction, and the freedom from the defects of the doctrinairs — which elements were combined in a singularly strong result- ant in Dr. Blackburn, born in Indiana of Scotch ancestry, whose forefathers in the old country had at the peril of life gone to the aid of French Huguenots in their struggle for religious freedom, and who at the end of his earthly pilgrimage peacefully and submissively laid down his life in Pierre. Through the various stages of Dr. Blackburn's boyhood and school days; his earlier years and his later maturity in an exceedingly able ministry varied by the experience of a man of mark as lecturer; his authorship of many works, involving studies of great charac- ters in religious schools and controversies, and culminating in his \"History of the Huguenots,\" \" History of the Christian Church\" and \"History of Christian Doctrine,\" in the prepara- tion of which works he made a trip to Europe and entered into extended research among the tombs and archives of the Great Reformation ; his professorship in the Theological Seminary of the Northwest at Chicago ; his memorable and exceptionally brilliant defense of Professor David Swing when tried for her- esy under charges preferred by Dr. Patton and who was ac- quitted; his later presidency of the University of North Dakota, and his final presidency of the Presbyterian Synodical College of Dakota, at Pierre, which institution was afterward removed 42 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS to Huron — through this succession of activities and events which kept Dr. Blackburn in touch with the theological lights of the age and made him a great factor in the Progress of religious enlightenment of the modern day, did Dr. Robinson carry the reader in a narrative and study at once entertaining as a lit- erary effort and concisely exhaustive as an analysis of the life- work of Dr. Blackburn, and in a summary of the comments and criticisms thereon brought out by contemtoraneous reviewers. The munificent gift of Indian curios and relics, many of which are rare, which Dr. Robinson bestowed upon the State through its Historical Society, attests the value and sacredness to the purposes of science and history which the generous donor as- cribed to those evidences of the past in archeology and anthrop- oligy. The collection in question is of much value to the public in the directions indicated, and its graitous transfer to the State entails lasting public obligations in favor of the giver. Tribute by Dr. McNutt. (Read at the Annual Meeting of the South Dakota Academy of Railway Sur- geons at Aberdeen, April 25, 1911, by Dr. H. E. McNutt). Dr. DeLorme W. Robinson died September 26, 1910, at his home in Pierre, S. D., at the untimely age of 56 years. By his death our State has lost one of its representatives and valued cit- izens, and our profession in this State one of its ablest and most distinguished members. His death was due to an attack of pneu- monia, of four or five days duration, caused by the exposure and hardships of a long night ride while answering a professional call in the country. A severe attack of the same disease about two years before had left him in a debilitated condition, which fact he fully understood, and had often spoken of his liability to a recurrence of the disease and of what the result would probably be. It is the old, old story, too often told, of the faithful phy- sician endangering, even losing his life by his efforts to relieve suffering and to save the lives of others. For deeds like these, and of no greater service, though performed in more dramatic fashion, others have received loud praises for their bravery and other manifestations of appreciation, even to the public decora- tion with \"Carnegie medals.\" Dr. Robinson was born at Pulaski, Pa., Oct. 26, 1854. His parents were both Scotch, of the the Stuart clan, which circum- SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 43 stance has been often referred to as a partial explanation of the ^(•11 reliance and j>erserverance that are said to have been notice- able characteristics of the Doctor throughout his life-time. He received his preliminary education at Alleghany College, Pa., and his medical training in the Medical Department of Wooster Tniversity, Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from the Kentucky School of Medicine, at Louisville, in 1882, and took post-grad- uate work in the Chicago Medical School. He located in Pierre, S. D. soon after his graduation, where he at once began the practice of his profession, and where he. continued to live and practice to the end of his life. Like many here present he knew by experience the hardships and privations of the pioneer phy- sician. It is said by those who knew him best that he was to a noticeable degree in all his undertakings, professional and other- wise, methodical, industrious, painstaking and careful, yet full of confidence and of a progressive disposition, endeavoring al- ways, in his professional work especially, to keep fully abreast of the times. About a dozen years ago he took a leading part in the estab- lishment at Pierre of the well-known St. Mary's Hospital, of which he was at once made the head of its Directorate and < li'ff of the Medical Staff, wrhich positions he held to the time of his last sickness and death. Here he achieved prominence in his surgical work, for which he had a preference, and which became so extensive that he gradually relinquished his medical cases to others under his supervision. His records show with a long line of other work a list of eight hundred laparotomies, which was attended with but two per cent of failures. This favorable showing may perhaps be accounted for, in part at least, by his acknowledged ability as a diagnositician, and the personal care he gave his paients, and yet it is said he always seemed to be reluctant to undertake an operation. As a citizen his loyalty to his city and to the state were always in evidence. The first Territorial law creating a Board <>f Public Health, also our first State laws on that subject were the direct results of his efforts. Upon both the Territorial and State Boards he served efficiently several years, and it is but ju*t to say that in the list of those who, without hope of per- sonal reward, contributed to the establishment of the past and 44 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS present system of public health management by the State his name easily stands first. In his home city he served efficiently and with credit upon both tlie City Council and the City School Board. With all his duties Dr. Robinson was noted as a constant and thorough student, and his favorite studies were along medical, classical and historical lines. He was a frequent contributor to both the medical and public press, and was known as a fluent and expressive writer, and gave evidence that he was well versed in the subjects on which he wrote. His articles \"Tuberculosis Among the Sioux,\" published by the American Review of Re- views in 1896, his \" Meteorological Conditions and Public Health,\" published in the Medical and Surgical Journal of Bos- ton in 1896, and \"Dakota for Health Seekers,\" in the Report of Climatological Association for 1903, were all well known, and were well received. He was a charter member of the South Dakota Historical Society, and was its president at the time of his death. Of him our State Historian, Doane Robinson, the well-known authority in that department, says, \"I have tried to keep myself informed about the history of South Dakota and the Northwest, but Dr. Robinson could always lead me and teach me in my own field.\" His publications, called \"Notes,\" upon the history of South Da- kota and of the Northwest would make a very large volume. Prominent among them are a series of sketches of famous men, some of Whites and some of Indians, who were prominently identified with the military history of the Dakotas during their development. His ability to read physiognomy and character accurately was often commented upon, and his descriptions of the character and the motives that actuated the lives and con- duct of many of the famous Indians, whom he knew personally, so marvelously depicted in his historical notes, are said, for their clearness and expressiveness, to be unsurpassed by any writer. The Doctor became a widower in 1891, after five years of wedded life, and never re-married. His children were a son and daughter, both of whom survive him at the ages of about eighteen and twenty. He was an active member of the several Masonic bodies, by whom he was regarded as a just and upright brother. His SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 45 funeral was conducted by the Knights Templar in an impressive manner from the Episcopal church, of which he was a member. By years of association Dr. Robinson was personally well known to nearly all of us; and I feel warranted in saying now that our respect for his personal and professional worth, and our friendship for him, were alike measured by the intimacy of our acquaintance with him. By his death this Association loses an active and valued member, and we, as individuals, will mourn the death of one whom we had come to regard a personal friend. A Friend's Tribute. By Dr. Theodore F. Riggs. The opportunity of offering a few words in tribute to Dr. D. W. Robinson and his work, is an honor which I deeply appre- ciate. A man's value to a community, especially in this young country, should be judged not only by what he did, but also by what his pioneer work enables others to do after him. The physician who, in the face of the many obstacles of an entirely new and uneducated land, builds a broad foundation, from the professional standpoint, is deserving of higher honor than are those who follow to reap the more evident rewards. In medicine, as in other lines, it is the constructive work which is of real value. The man who appreciates this and who recognizes in such work his opportunity as well as his duty must find his re- ward not so much in money as in the consciousness of work well done. That Dr. Robinson was a pioneer and that his in- fluence is felt and will be felt long after his death is unques- tionable. He was known and is remembered not only locally in Pierre but also throughout the entire state as a leader in his profession. Of the accident which resulted in his locating in Pierre I have often heard him tell. A recent graduate, with a few drugs and instruments and fewer dollars he was on his way t<» the Pacific coast, misled by the folders of the Railroad Company he took this route as affording the best means of transportation and one evening found himself stranded in Pierre, at the end of the railroad, without the means to get out of town. He was sitting on a pile of old railroad ties, so the story went, trying to diagnose the situation when he was approached by an elderly man who wanted to sell him some city lots. It did not take him 46 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS long to explain the situation and his ability to deal in real estate, and his new found friend proved a friend indeed for he said, ''You come down to ray hotel, the Stebbins House and I'll find you some patients.\" This was the beginning, the patients were found and his practice grew and it was not long Before Dr. Robinson had given up all ideas of going farther west and had decided to make his home in Pierre. I will leave to others who are better able to do him justice, the story of his life here. From the view point of a fellow practitioner I may say that Dr. Rob- inson was my friend long before I had any thought of the study of medicine and perhaps through him more than through any one else my interests in the profession was aroused. \"The Old Roman,\" as we younger men loved to call him, we knew as a quiet, self contained man, a thorough scholar, \"a canny Scott,\" a good diagnostician, an excellent prognostician, a consevative surgeon and a man remarkably well-posted in the advances of his profession. By his own skill and effort Dr. Robinson devel- oped in Pierre one of the strongest medical centers in our state and had he had the advantage of a more modern training it is safe to say that, as a surgeon he would have had few if any superior in the country such was his natural ability. The loss of such a man is keenly felt by his patients and his friends but even more deeply by fellow practitioners. Senator A. B. Kittredge A Sketch of His Private Life and of His Public Service BY THOMAS B. ROBERTS SENATOR A. B. KITTREDGE A Sketch of His Private Life and of His Public Service By Thomas B. Roberts ' A. B. Kittredge was born in the State of New Hampshire, in the year 1861 on a farm, and up to the age of fourteen, partici- pated in the exacting labor of the farmer. There he acquired the habits of industry and frugality, and drew from his mother's breast, and the environment in which he lived the homely New England virtues, driven into the hearts and souls of the New England people by the flail of adversity and necessity, covering a period of near three hundred years. These habits of industry and frugality, and these New England virtues thus acquired, dominated Mr. Kittredge 's whole life up to its very end. At the age of fourteen he entered an academy and was pre- pared for Yale college, and in 1882, he was graduated from that institution and at once entered its Law department, and com- pleted the Law course in 1885 and was admitted to the bar in the same year. In the fall of 1885, he turned his eyes to the West and located at the city of Sioux Falls in this state. He was attracted to the West by the glowing reports he got of the op- jM>\"t unities offered to young men with industrious habits. After u«-itliering all the information he could as to the opportunities there furnished to young men, he finally concluded to cast his fortunes with the people of South Dakota, then a territory into whose borders the rushing tide of immigration was pouring from section of the East and the middle West. At Sioux Falls irrhomas B. Roberts, private secretary to Senator Kittredge during most of his senatorial service, was born in South Bend Indiana, and came to South Dakota in 1882 to settle upon a homestead in Douglas county. In 1885 he became the editor and proprietor of the Armour ('hrniiical-Tribune. which he conducted until he became Mr. Kittridge's secretary in TS'02. After the close of Mr. Kittredge's term of office Mr. Roberta managed the Territorial Pioneer's reunion at Aberdeen in r.m«.i and June 1st. 1910 became the editor of the Pierre Dakotan in which work he is still engaged. 52 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS he soon gained an enviable position as a lawyer. He won the esteem and confidence of a large clientage and by the year 1890, had built up a lucrative practice, and had won the confidence of the people of his city and county. In the year 1889, he was elected to the state senate from Minnehaha County and served the people of that county in the State legislature for two terms When He Entered the Senate with distinguished ability. Through his prominence as a mem- ber of the state senate, he attracted the attention of the leaders of his party, and through his strong personality, won their esteem and confidence. In the year 1892, he was made national committeeman for the Republican party of the State of South Dakota, which office he held for four years. He performed the SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 53 duties of this position with marked fidelity and ability. During the four years embraced in this service as committeman, he ap- pointed or secured the appointment, of five hundred men to vari- ous positions in the public service. None of his appointments were ever criticized, and none of his appointees failed in the faithful discharge of their duties. Please insert in Vol. 6 South Dakota Historical Collections at page 53. Mr. Kittredge was appointed Senator in 1901 and elected to the position by the legislature of 1903. The dates in the text are erroneous. At the time of his appointment, Mr. Kittredge was 40 years old. He entered the senate when his mind and his body were in their utmost vigor, and in that great legislative body, he won a commanding position, and before the close of his senatorial life, he became one of its dominant members and became widely known throughout the country. No senator ever entered that body who achieved more distinction in the same length of ser- vice. At the time of his appointment he was utterly unknown outside of his own state. When he left the senate he was one of its most prominent members and a national character. Mr. Kittredge was early appointed a member of the judiciary committee, one of the important committees of the senate, and continued to be a member of this committee through the whole period of his senatorial service. He had no ornamental trait in his character, and the members of the committee soon learned that he was industrious and painstaking and thence forward he the one member of the committee upon whom was imposed the duties of investigation of the matters referred to the com- mittee. His reports were accepted without question, and uni- formly met the approval of the committee. The other important committee on which he rendered pre-eminent service was the committee on interoceanic canals, of which he was chairman. To the work of this committee he brought his splendidly trained mind and his capacity for hard work. It was to his ability, his tact and his persistence, that the route of the canal was changed from the Nicaragua to the Panama route and he fought to the very end to make the canal a sea-level instead of a lock canal. His 52 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS he soon gained an enviable position as a lawyer. He won the esteem and confidence of a large clientage and by the year 1890, had built up a lucrative practice, and had won the confidence of the people of his city and county.

None of his appointments were ever criticized, and none of his appointees failed in the faithful discharge of their duties. In IJOOT, Mr. Kittredge was appointed United States Sena- tor from the State of South Dakota, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator James H. Kyle, and in 1433. was elected by the legislature of South Dakota for the succeeding full term, thus serving as a senator for the period of eight years. At the time of his appointment, Mr. Kittredge was 40 years old. He entered the senate when his mind and his body were in their utmost vigor, and in that great legislative body, he won a commanding position, arid before the close of his senatorial life, he became one of its dominant members and became widely known throughout the country. No senator ever entered that body who achieved more distinction in the same length of ser- vice. At the time of his appointment he was utterly unknown outside of his own state. When he left the senate he was one of its most prominent members and a national character. Mr. Kittredge was early appointed a member of the judiciary committee, one of the important committees of the senate, and continued to be a member of this committee through the whole period of his senatorial service. He had no ornamental trait in his character, and the members of the committee soon learned that he was industrious and painstaking and thence forward he was the one member of the committee upon whom was imposed the duties of investigation of the matters referred to the com- mittee.

The other important committee on which he rendered pre-eminent service was the committee on interoceanic canals, of which he was chairman. To the work of this committee he brought his splendidly trained mind and his capacity for hard work. It was to his ability, his tact and his persistence, that the route of the canal was changed from the Nicaragua to the Panama route and he fought to the very end to make the canal a sea-level instead of a lock canal. His 54 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS most notable service in connection with the canal, was his report on 'the purchase of the canal from the French company, which originally had undertaken to construct it. The first proposition that became necessary to investigate was the title to this pro- perty. The question was referred to Senator Kittredge, and after making a thorough, full, and careful investigation, ren- dered his report to the senate. It was a herculean task and one that called for the highest legal acumen. It involved a technical, complicated, and international proposition, and wThen his report His Birthplace was made to the senate, it was accepted without the change of a syllable. It was a perfect document, and will be referred to as authority by coming generations. He drafted every important piece of legislature relating to the Panama Canal after he be- came chairman of the canal committee. After the death of Sena- ,tor Morgan, there wras no man in either branch of Congress so well informed upon all questions affecting the canal, as Sena- tor Kittredge. He had made a thorough and careful investiga- tion of the canal on the ground, and he knew it in every detail SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 55 and it is highly probable that time will vindicate his contention that the sea-level type of canal was the type which should have been followed. Other important pieces of legislation that bi'iir the imprint of Senator Kittredge are the following: The rail- road rate law ; the oleomargarine act ; the pure food act ; the act providing for expediting the disposition of anti-trust cases in the Federal Courts; the establishment of the department of commerce and labor; and the act reducing the cost of the trans- portation of mails, which was passed March 2, 1907. He was also deeply interested in the legislation relating to the disposi- tion of the semi-arid regions and in the passage of the laws re- lating to the preservation of the forest lands and water powers embraced in the public domain, and the conservation of the coal and mineral lands, belonging to the public, and took an active and leading part in the passage of laws relating to these import- ant subjects. He was also an important factor in framing the laws relating to so-called trusts and combinations, and he was directly responsible for the investigation of the great lumber trust. Early in his senatorial career, he became convinced that less than one half dozen men was in control^ of the lumber supply of the country, and actually fixed both the wholesale and retail price by a system of black-listing of dealers who refused to accede to their demands. The prosecutions now before the Court are the results of the investigation of the lumber trust which he started. Perhaps the most notable act of Mr. Kittredge while he was a member of the senate, and the one act which brought to him the esteem and admiration of the public, was his vote against al- lowing Reed Smoot to retain his seat in the United States senate. Mr. Smoot was a senator from Utah. It was charged that lie was a polygamist, and an attempt was made in the senate to unseat him because of that fact. Senator Knox made a masterly, con- stitutional argument upon the right of Smoot to remtain his seat. II i> argument even now is apparently unanswerable from a con- stitutional standpoint. But the New England virtues which formed the woof and web of Senator Kittredge 's life and domin- ated his every act, forced him to disregard constitutional argu- ments and vote in favor of the resolution to unseat the senator from Utah. In the debate on the resolution, Mr. Kittredge said, 56 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS \"Our fathers, in framing the provision in our constitution, had in mind the Christian religion, and not an alleged religion whose fundamental tenent is based upon immorality prohibited by law. For, from the very beginning, the Morman people — no matter what their creed may be — have been taught from the cradle to the grave, pollution in the home. It has not been my good for- tune to have a home of my own, but as long as I remain in the senate, my voice shall be raised, and my vote shall be given, in favor of the purity of the American home. They say that it is His First Likeness not an issue. They made it an issue. And if they did not, the question of the purity of the home is always an issue.\" At the close of his term of service in the senate, Mr. Kittredge appealed to the people for re-election. The present primary law .which requires the people to vote direct on the senator, was then in force. By demogogical argument and villification during the campaign, Mr. Kittredge was defeated on the popular vote by about 2,000. His defeat was a calamity to the state, and deprived SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 5T the state and nation of one of the most useful, as well as one of the ablest senators then in public life. On the expiration of his term, he returned to Sioux Falls and took up again the practice of his profession, and was in the full tide of active practice when he was stricken with the malady which ended his life on the 4th day of May, 1911. In private life, Mr. Kittredge was a delightful and companion- able man. He had the capacity of friendship in a marked degree. He was a silent man. He was not effusive. He made no attempt at show, but rather sought at all times self effacement. But he attracted about him a large circle of close personal friends, men who sincerely and devotedly loved him, and these friendships were everlasting. A friend once attached to Mr. Kittredge was always a friend and one upon whom he could call at any time, day or night, for his best service. Mr. Kittredge was an ex- tremely- bashful man in many respects. He was always timid in his association with women. While he enjoyed the society of women whom he knew well, he was extremely shy in meeting strangers, and rather avoided introductions than sought them. He was not a man of moods, but his nature was loving and gentle. He was most happy in the evening when surrounded by intimate friends, and his rooms at Sioux Falls were always open to every friend and \"no man ever visited him at his bachelor hearth without receiving the glad hand of friendship/' He was extremely charitable. In his professional life, he render- <M! services to many people without thought of charge, and his free service was rendered as cheerfully and with as much fidelity as services which he rendered to a client for remuneration. These charities were carried on in secret. No friend or acquaintance fvrr heard him boast or even mention any charitable service he ever rendered. Mr. Kittredge, in his home state and in his country, won a high place by actual merit, without a trick to fool or an artifice to win. His life is a story of the success of real merit. It is a story of hoth as the result of extraordinary diligence in position, of unceasing loyalty to friends, of steadfast devotion to conviction, and of the puritan's adherence to the truth and the example which is left to the young men of the State of South Dakota by 58 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS the unemotional, painstaking patience and steady career of this successful man should live long in his adopted state. One of his close personal friends pays this beautiful tribute. 4 'He was my friend, faithful and just to me. I have been with him in victory and defeat. I have seen him in success and in failure. I have known him in health and in sickness. I was at his bedside when he was fighting his last heroic battle, and stood, with head uncovered and heart full, with other South Dakota friends, when his body was lowered in the grave in the beautiful At 5 Years Old At 12 Years Old New England village where his boyhood was passed. I want here to testify that he met every test in life with an equal mind and a calm and poised philosophy, and that he died as he lived— the same steady, balanced, gentle, and soldierly soul — lacking in nothing and worthy in all.\" A close personal friend makes the following contribution to his private life and character, which is a fit ending to this brief statement. \"Mr. Kittredge soon began to attract attention in Sioux Falls as a lawyer. He never made long speeches, but he SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 59 had a quiet and convincing way in the trial of causes which was equally effective with both jury and court. His business began to grow and eight years after his arrival he was a well-establish- ed and successful practitioner, and a full partner in the busy law firm of Winsor & Kittredge. His first interest was his profes- sion to which he was passionately devoted. His next interest was in politics. It was not long before men instinctively began to consult A. B. Kittredge. He displayed such genius in organiza- tion, and such amazing mastery of details that he became soon the trusted lieutenant of Senator R. F. Pettigrew, and the two worked together with great success until 1896, when Mr. Petti- grew bolted the national convention and left the republican party. Mr. Kittredge, meanwhile, had served two terms in the state sen- ate where he had added to his prestige over the state and had at- tained to the position of national committeeman. Mr. Petti- grew 's bolt threw disorganization into the republican party, but Mr. Kittredge gathered together the remnants of the organiza- tion with such consummate skill as has never before been shown in political management in this state. Then followed his ap- pointment to the United States senate to succeed the late Senator James H. Kyle, and after that his triumphant election for the full term. Mr. Kittredge 's life in Sioux Falls was a life of constant labor. He had no taste for social life, and perhaps his appearances in Sioux Falls society could be counted on the fingers of one hand. His home was his office where he was to be found from six o'clock in the morning, and often earlier, until the last visitor was ready to go. The rear room of his office was the constant mecca of those who sought advice or help. He was consulted about every thing from running for office to building a chimney, and he wra& as careful and courteous in the last as the first. With this big, grave, silent man, nothing was too complicated to disturb, or too trifling to interest him. He was seldom seen at public meetings and for this he was often criticised by the unthinking. Those who knew him best, knew that he often remained away because of his fear of being called on \"for a few remarks\" which he dreaded with a fear that was almost pitiful and not for lack of interest in public affairs. Later it became known to them that many a local business project had received Mr. Kittredge 's finan- 60 SOUTH DAKOTA HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS cial and personal support and that, without noise, he had done his full share as a town builder. For more than a score of years, he occupied bachelor apartments on the third floor of the Union Trust block, and this was his retreat from the cares and worries of the day filled with heavy business. It was an unwritten law At Graduation, 1885 that \"Kit\" was not to be disturbed when he had left his office and retired to his rooms, unless it was absolutely necessary. After his retirement from the senate, which was one of the cruel tragedies of politics, Mr. Kittredge took up his law prac- tice which returned to him in such large volume as to keep him constantly engaged. In October, 1910, he had been long at work in the trial of an "
