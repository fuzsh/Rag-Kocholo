        "text": "The \"The Philippines: A Past Revisited from the Spanish Colonization to the Second World War\" is a book written by Renato Constantino published in year 1975 to discuss and open his thoughts and ideas during the Spanish and American colonization in the Philippines. We all know that the Philippines was colonized by the said countries, and he is the one of many people who introduced a different perspective on what really happened during those times. He is a well-known Filipino historian and part of a leftist tradition of the Philippine historiography. In his book, he exposed a lot of things, traditions, and ways that the Filipinos are not able to have within their own identity and ways. He inducted that we should establish a foundation in which we understand what really happened in the past and how it affects our lives in this present time. We need to revisit our past and focus on the things on what the Filipinos should learn and give identity for themselves. The book itself has 18 chapters, in which every chapter has its own subject and topic. We can explore each chapter and extract each point presented in them. Let us revisit the past and know what truly happened in the colonial period and see if there is a connection and relevance on what happened in the things that is written in the books that reflects our history and with the lives of the Filipinos today. Let us start in the first chapter where it talks about the people's history, in which it must be refined that fits in the views of the Filipinos. Our history is very dependent on our colonizers back then. They run the tempo of our lives and even chose the path of our history and how it should be absorbed by the Filipinos. In short, we are not free to learn our own history and it points towards the history that our colonizers want us to have. But many Filipino historians have their own way of successfully align our history to have a perspective in a Filipino sense. The problem is with in the Filipinos themselves. They are not ready to accept their own history or even build and manifest with their experiences during colonial period. We should have a better understanding regarding on what truly happened in the past. And with this, we can relive and revisit the history of our country.\n\nThe Philippine-American War (c.1899 – 1913), which led to the colonial subjugation of the Philippines by the United States for over forty years and the suppression of the first independent republic in South-East Asia, is one of America’s forgotten wars. The historical amnesia surrounding this conflict is no accident. It is an enduring legacy of US government and military propaganda, widely disseminated by a largely supportive corporate press, which contributed in no small way to the American victory both at home and abroad. Propaganda is understood here as the deliberate falsification, distortion or tendentious portrayal of events to justify a political cause to the wider public. What I want to argue about this case, is that successful propaganda does not occur in the context of an otherwise rational and empirically verifiable public discourse. Successful war propaganda has to be reconciled with the self-respecting, symbolic self-interpretations of a national community. In the case of the United States, founded in part on a revolutionary republican imaginary but also a racialised and expansionist missionary vision of “Manifest Destiny”, this was not a simple or uncontested matter back in 1899. This article provides a brief account of the American conquest of the Philippines and the attendant atrocities that accompanied the invasion. It will also explain how these brutal events were justified to the American public as hard but necessary acts of “Benevolent Assimilation”, for the benign tutelage of the Filipino. In particular, attention is paid to how propaganda was used to justify a colonial war, dehumanize the Filipino “other”, rationalize atrocities and erase alternative interpretations of events from the official record."
