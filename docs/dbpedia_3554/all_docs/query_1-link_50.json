There should be a separate set of pages for each name of the ship (for example, Bushnell AG-32 / Sumner AGS-5 are different names for the same ship so there should be one set of pages for Bushnell and one set for Sumner). Covers should be presented in chronological order (or as best as can be determined).\n\nSince a ship may have many covers, they may be split among many pages so it doesn't take forever for the pages to load. Each page link should be accompanied by a date range for covers on that page.\n\nUSCGC Hamilton WHEC-715 Covers Page 1 (1967)\n\nPostmarks\n\nThis section lists examples of the postmarks used by the ship. There should be a separate set of postmarks for each name and/or commissioning period. Within each set, the postmarks should be listed in order of their classification type. If more than one postmark has the same classification, then they should be further sorted by date of earliest known usage.\n\nA postmark should not be included unless accompanied by a close-up image and/or an image of a cover showing that postmark. Date ranges MUST be based ONLY ON COVERS IN THE MUSEUM and are expected to change as more covers are added.\n\n>>> If you have a better example for any of the postmarks, please feel free to replace the existing example.\n\nPostmark Type\n\n---\n\nKiller Bar Text\n\nPostmark\n\nDate Thumbnail Link\n\nTo\n\nPostmark Image Thumbnail Link\n\nTo\n\nCover Image\n\n1st Commissioning March 18 1967 to October 25 1985\n\nLocy Type\n\nFDC 2(n+)(\"USCGC\")\n\n1967-03-18\n\nFirst Day of Commissioning, Rubber stamp cachet.\n\n2nd Commissioning December 1988 - March 28 2011\n\nNo Postmarks Reported\n\nUSPS Machine Cancel\n\nBoston MA\n\n1989-07-17\n\nN/A\n\nRubber stamp cachet.\n\nOther Information\n\nNAMESAKE - Alexander Hamilton (January 11 1757 - July 12 1804)\n\nHamilton was the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and founded the Revenue Cutter Services in 1790.\n\nSix Cutters of the US Revenue Service/US Coast Guard have borne the name HAMILTON - USRC Hamilton (1830-1853), USRC Hamilton (1871-1906),\n\nUSCGC Alexander Hamilton (1921-1942), USCGC Alexander Hamilton WPG-34, USCGC Hamilton WHEC-715 and USCGC Hamilton WMSL-753.\n\nThere has also been one ship of the US Navy named after Hamilton - USS Alexander Hamilton SSBN-617.\n\nPHILIPPINE NAMESAKE - Gregorio Hilario del Pilar y Sempio (November 14, 1875 – December 2, 1899) was one of the youngest generals in the Philippine Revolutionary Forces during the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine–American War.
