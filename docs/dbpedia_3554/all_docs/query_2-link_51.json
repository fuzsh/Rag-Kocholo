In 1867, Union soldiers were enforcing a congressional mandate that former Confederate states, long led by a powerful slaveholding class, rewrite their constitutions with African American men, overwhelmingly enslaved but a few years earlier, participating in the process. The result was a fragile interracial and multi-party democracy in a war-torn region with an embittered white supremacist majority. By 1898, that same military was occupying Spain’s colonies in the Pacific and Caribbean. Over the next few months and years, it would crush a fledgling Filipino state, enforce restrictions on Cuban sovereignty, and commandeer Spain’s other colonies as well as the Hawaiian Islands. But the relationships between these two developments, and their broader political and cultural moments, have largely eluded attention. As this volume demonstrates, this neglect is unfortunate, for even if we define the ever-evolving terms “Reconstruction” and “Empire” narrowly, the history of the former has much to tell us about the course of the latter. The disconnect is perplexing given the proximity of and commonalities between these two moments. Reconstruction—understood as a series of possibilities and conflicts emerging from the twin pivots of emancipation and Union victory—did much to alter the course of events in and beyond the United States. African Americans—former slaves and the minority born free—fought to secure personal autonomy, legal equality, and political power. Northern churches and humanitarians supported an ambitious, if halting, campaign to transform Southern society, often in the face of reactionary violence. The Republican Party, committed to an antislavery reunion but internally divided over racial equality and the extent of Congress’s constitutional authority, embraced both in the face of white supremacist intransigence, including that of Abraham Lincoln’s successor as president, Andrew Johnson. Republicans’ core legislative measures, including the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, dramatically expanded civil and political rights, but also precipitated divisions among reformers over the nexus of\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 1\n\n12/3/21 12:25:21 PM\n\n2\n\nDavid Prior\n\ngender and racial oppression. A Southern wing of the party composed of African Americans, a minority of discontented whites, and Northern migrants governed briefly across much of the South. Soon, however, Southern Republicans were on their back foot before more numerous Southern white supremacists and their Northern Democratic allies. Historians do not agree on exactly why Northern Republicans became less willing or able to intervene in Southern politics, but already by 1874 Southern white paramilitaries acted with near impunity. The final Republican state governments in the South fell in 1877, although this was no unqualified victory for racists. African American political participation persisted in many locales, as did educational, religious, social, and civic institutions unthinkable under slavery. The amended Constitution, moreover, included the legal foundations for the later victories of the modern civil rights movement. Finally, the South was firmly within the Union with slavery abolished. But Southern white supremacists had gained regional control. A new Jim Crow order built around segregation, ritualistic acts of sadism, state-sanctioned convict-lease systems, debt peonage, and formal disenfranchisement spread across the South, winning federal sanction and national connivance by century’s end. Things were just as complicated with the place of the United States in a world that was increasingly interconnected and suffused with imperial power and violence. Immediately following the Civil War, leading Republicans variously eyed territorial acquisitions, supported commercial expansion across the western territories and abroad, and worked to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. The United States government acquired Alaska and the Midway Atoll and pressured the French imperial government to abandon its puppet monarchy in Mexico. But it also demurred from annexing the Dominican Republic and the Danish West Indies and from supporting raids by Irish-American Fenians into Canada. Both Republican and Democratic politicians supported wars with diverse Native American groups that lived within or astride the internationally recognized boundaries of the United States, enforcing confinement on reservations and seeking to undermine Indigenous cultural resilience. Steam power, telegraphy, and cheap print rendered an interconnected world, granting easy access to information and misinformation from around the globe and fueling U.S. evangelicals’ ambitions to convert the human race. By the Civil War’s end, a new industrial capitalism centered on the North Atlantic was transforming the world, spawning a small globe-trotting class of super-rich U.S. citizens, fueling the growth of more modest forms of tourism, and employing millions of immigrant laborers under harsh conditions. Corporate behemoths insinuated themselves into the halls of\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 2\n\n12/3/21 12:25:21 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\npower in Washington, D.C., and sequestered resources abroad. These forces of change culminated at the turn of the century. In 1898, a clique of Republican politicians, empire-hungry and self-consciously masculine, both blustered and stumbled into two of the Spanish government’s colonial stalemates while also annexing Hawaii. The ensuing globe-straddling conflict yielded a distinctive moment in the United States’ long and complicated history of violent expansion in the name of democracy and progress. The United States occupied and, excepting the quasi-independent nation-state of Cuba, formally annexed far-flung overseas Spanish colonies whose inhabitants were culturally diverse and putatively racially distinct from those deemed “white” and “Anglo-Saxon.” The imposition of U.S. authority prompted democratic resistance in Cuba, a series of anticolonial wars in the Philippines, and a patchwork anti-imperialist movement of racists and Northern egalitarians at home. Federal officials and colonial denizens navigated an ambiguous and impromptu legal regime. In the following years and decades, U.S. politicians would practice rampant interventionism, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, going so far as to dispossess Colombia of the Isthmus of Panama. Common themes—violence and military power, citizenship and sovereignty, discourses of race, gender, religion, and national identity, economic transformations, and claims to equality and progress—connected and evolved through these two historical moments. Yet although linkages abound, they defy easy summation, with the two stories having many common parts, but arranged differently. Northeastern and midwestern Republicans authored Reconstruction’s key legislation and launched turn-of-the-century overseas imperialism, but generational change transformed their party over this same period. Severe economic recession struck twice over this period (1873–1877 and 1893–1897), providing one of Reconstruction’s endpoints but preceding the War with Spain and granting it a nervous energy. The cause of reconciliation among white Northerners and Southerners found a qualified affirmation in the “War with Spain,” but the conflict also pulled U.S. politics out from the shadow of the Civil War. Abolition and Union victory as well as later imperial occupations intensified debates over the meaning of race, but that concept was itself unstable, with nativist responses to European “new immigrants” and theories of evolution transforming it. U.S. overseas imperialism also saw domestic racism inflicted on colonial subjects but simultaneously divided African American opinion and, ironically, helped forge connections between African Americans and Afro-Cubans. Gender norms that had long been integral to the abolitionist movement, including\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 3\n\n12/3/21 12:25:21 PM\n\n4\n\nDavid Prior\n\nthose lauding manly self-restraint and the nurturing nature of women, also suffused the imperial project and popular prejudices against the colonized other. Both moments witnessed currents of humanitarian reform swirling around U.S. military conflicts but in two contexts set apart by the rise of professionalization and the authority of scientific expertise. And yet with both conflicts, invasions spurred on health crises that undermined the conqueror’s claims of benignity and competence. The grassroots white-supremacist violence of the postbellum South and the U.S. military’s use of torture and reconcentration in the Philippines were, like campaigns against Native American communities, harbingers of a coming century of world history marked by the proliferation of civilian atrocities. Across this period, a faith in the distinction between civilized progress and retrograde barbarism transcended the political and intellectual landscape, but with the identity of civilization’s barbarian others subject to shifting lines of contestation. In both contexts, concepts of civilization and barbarism sustained elaborate metaphors and world-straddling comparisons in which Southern whites were equated with Mormons and Turks, the South with tropical colonies, Cubans with Armenians and Haitians, and the colonies with crowded ethnic quarters of cities. Given the complexity of these issues and their importance to understanding the decades following the Civil War, one wonders whether there isn’t an alternative historiographical universe where a long-standing interpretive paradigm of “Reconstruction & Empire” reigns in place of our own “Gilded Age & Progressive Era.” Indeed, early-twenty-first-century scholarly debates over how to define, label, and segment the history of the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century United States suggest that just such a paradigm may come into vogue. Of particular interest, Heather Cox Richardson, Elliott West, and Richard White have attempted to expand the definition of Reconstruction so that it encompasses the U.S. conquest and incorporation of its western territories. Especially with Richardson and White, this approach bridges the ending of the Civil War and developments at the turn of the century, with Richardson concluding her narrative of Reconstruction with the United States’ wars in the Spanish colonies. One of the hitches with this approach, however, is that it raises the question of whether and how Reconstruction mattered to the trajectory of U.S. power abroad if we do not first redefine it—if we contain it, as Rachel St. John has put it. How did the sweeping economic, cultural, and political transformations embedded in and stemming from abolition and Union victory condition, inhibit, or facilitate the various manifestations of U.S. power at century’s end? How tightly tethered were\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 4\n\n12/3/21 12:25:21 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nthese two political and cultural moments, each centered on its own complex fusing of conquest and liberation? To understand how historians ended up neglecting these questions, and how much room there is for sustained debate about them, we should revisit W. E. B. Du Bois’s once forgotten but now canonical Black Reconstruction in America (1935). As Moon-Ho Jung and Eric Foner have pointed out, Black Reconstruction trenchantly situated the broader drama of Reconstruction, especially the white supremacist reaction to African American freedom and empowerment, as a critical moment in the United States’ route to racial imperialism. Du Bois—the most prominent and accomplished African American intellectual of his day and a pivotal figure in American sociology, literature, and history—only sketched his argument about Reconstruction and empire. But the result was striking and original in ways that can still help us think through the complex connections between the two. Du Bois wrote, revised, and edited the massive, polemical volume from 1931 to 1935, amid a global Great Depression, the highwater mark of European empires, and Jim Crow as a national institution. A kind of evocative moral history rare in the profession today, Black Reconstruction combined detailed critiques of early-twentieth-century racist scholarship, ruminations on the centrality of labor to politics in the North and South, and lyrical passages on the experiences and hopes of Southern freedpeople during and after emancipation. Du Bois, who spent pivotal parts of his life and career in the South but was born and raised in the North, sometimes wrote of Southern freedpeople with a touch of distance, perhaps even talented-tenth elitism. But overwhelmingly his book struggled against a tide of white supremacist scholarship to uphold Southern African Americans as the heroes of one of the most promising and tragic moments in the history of the United States, and indeed of the modern world. Black Reconstruction addressed this last topic by arguing that twentieth-century European and Euro-American geopolitical power rested on and was committed to the thralldom of the world’s nonwhite peoples. Merging concepts of capitalism and empire in a heterodox Marxism, Du Bois contended that the modern analog of the antebellum slave was “the yellow, brown and black laborer in China and India, in Africa, in the forests of the Amazon.” He argued—building on his broader turn-of-the-century career advocating for civil rights, anti-imperialism, and radical reform—that these oppressed laborers toiled to generate the surplus value that sustained “world power and universal dominion and armed arrogance\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 5\n\n12/3/21 12:25:21 PM\n\n6\n\nDavid Prior\n\nin London and Paris, Berlin and Rome, New York and Rio de Janeiro.” Du Bois urged, as he would for the rest of his remarkable life, that “the emancipation of man is the emancipation of labor and the emancipation of labor is the freeing of that basic majority of workers who are yellow, brown and black.” The historical narrative that Du Bois had in mind came across in brief passages. Ending his second chapter, “The White Worker,” for example, Du Bois sketched the transition from Reconstruction—here rhetorically subsumed within a broadened Civil War—to empire, writing: Then came this battle called Civil War, beginning in Kansas in 1854, and ending in the presidential election of 1876—twenty awful years. The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery. The whole weight of America was thrown to color caste. The colored world went down before England, France, Germany, Russia, Italy and America. A new slavery arose. . . . Democracy died save in the hearts of black folk. More details then emerged in the chapter titled “The Counter-Revolution of Property.” During the contested election of 1876, he claimed, Northern capitalists and poorer Southern whites joined with Southern barons in their long-running campaign to deny Southern freedpeople education, autonomy, and guidance— or has he put it, “Light and Land and Leading.” The South, with Black voting suppressed but its federal representation increased by the end of the three-fifths clause, reinforced Northern pro-business conservativism and a new industrial imperialism that “degraded colored labor the world over.” This Southern white supremacist triumph wrought a sweeping and “spiritual” change on the United States, transforming it into “a reactionary force.” In Black Reconstruction, Du Bois drew attention to the broader ascent of the United States as a capitalist power under the leadership of white supremacists; he did not focus on a single imperial event or conflict. Du Bois saw this ascent as earth-changing, and if anyone missed the boldness of his argument, he laid it bare in his conclusion to “The Counter-Revolution of Property.” “God wept,” he opened, “but that mattered little to an unbelieving age. . . . For there began to rise in America in 1876 a new capitalism and a new enslavement of labor.” To this momentous change Du Bois attributed World War I, brought on, he averred, by imperial competition, and then the ensuing global Great Depression. A more robust and enduring post–Civil War expansion of African American rights, especially one that saw widespread land redistribution, could have, Du Bois argued, “made a basis of real democracy in the United States that might easily have\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 6\n\n12/3/21 12:25:21 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\ntransformed the modern world.” For Du Bois, the Southern freedpeople’s quest for local autonomy and national citizenship, and the radical postbellum moment centered on these, pointed the way to global peace and equality. There is much to be said about Black Reconstruction’s imperial thesis, so much so that scholars tend to either glance over it or tip their hats to it in passing. In fact, Du Bois’s argument was provocative and insightful but also cryptic. Many of its details warrant debate and fuller explanation, including the idea that imperialism caused World War I and therefore the Great Depression. Du Bois also relied on the assumption that Southern freedpeople and their children would necessarily act as a class of workers to explain why, if not disenfranchised, they would have opposed the federal government’s or U.S. corporations’ exercises of power abroad. Finally, Du Bois’s analysis, like those of many other historians, at times became ensnared in the befuddling terms “Reconstruction,” “empire,” and “imperialism,” which all had complex etymologies. At moments he took “Reconstruction” as a straightforward concept, whereas at others, some deep in the text, he grappled with its definition. He also at points used “empire” and “imperialism” in an older sense meaning not colonial conquest but the anti-democratic consolidation of power, suggesting that the assault on Black voting constituted— not just caused—imperialism. But none of that is to deny the trenchancy of Du Bois’s imperial thesis (or this volume’s debt to it). As he made clear, the egalitarian and at times radical impulses of the immediate postbellum moment, as well as the contests they provoked, left profound legacies for the industrializing nation. His volume’s imperial thesis could have inaugurated a wider debate about these topics and thereby shaped the evolution of historical writing on the late-nineteenth- and early-twentiethcentury United States. Indeed, it nearly did. Although white supremacy, near the height of its intellectual authority in the 1930s, created serious hurdles to Black Reconstruction’s scholarly influence, there were several other factors working in its favor. One was that Du Bois’s imperial thesis came as a rebuttal to Reconstruction and the Constitution (1902), by the arch-racist John W. Burgess, and therefore formed a part of an emerging debate within the field. Burgess argued that Republicans had erred in extending suffrage across the color line but had hence, through imperialism, embraced the white man’s burden. Quoting and refuting Burgess’s argument, Du Bois countered that the fulfillment of Reconstruction’s promise would have prevented racist terrorism abroad. These opening salvos linking Reconstruction and empire could have easily fed into what was then considerable interest in how the economic processes at work in the postbellum South dovetailed with the rise of industrial capitalism. Du Bois found fault with other\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 7\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\n8\n\nDavid Prior\n\nscholars working in this vein, including Charles and Mary Beard and Howard K. Beale, and elicited critiques for his quasi-Marxian analysis from otherwise sympathetic, pro–civil rights scholars. Black Reconstruction, moreover, came out right as an eclectic cohort of historians—such as Francis Butler Simkins, A. A. Taylor, Robert Hilliard Woody, John Hope Franklin, and William Hesseltine— joined earlier African American historians and memoirists in dissenting from racist interpretations of Reconstruction. A young C. Vann Woodward, who would become the single most influential figure in the evolution of Southern historical scholarship, wrote to Du Bois in 1938 to praise Black Reconstruction and share his own work. As David Levering Lewis and others have noted, Black Reconstruction met with positive reviews and garnered, if briefly, some critical acclaim. The field was primed for discussion of the nexus of Reconstruction, economic change, and imperialism, which is exactly what Black Reconstruction offered. So why did Black Reconstruction not emerge as the focal point for precisely such a field-defining scholarly debate? Along with racism in and beyond the academy, a confluence of factors came to bear. Black Reconstruction had the poor luck of being published during the Great Depression and just before World War II. Although universities in the United States by no means closed shop, widespread unemployment, falling tax revenues, and then national mobilization disrupted scholarly production. Depression conditions limited sales, in part because the bulky volume was a touch expensive. Post–World War II Consensus scholarship, although more complex than is sometimes acknowledged, showed little interest in the topic of race and was unlikely to inspire renewed interest in Du Bois’s volume. In a fairly remarkable series of coincidences, by the mid-1950s some of the scholars who had favorably reviewed Black Reconstruction retired, passed away, or took a conservative turn in their thinking, limiting the roster of scholars who might have called for renewed attention to it. Finally, the intellectual climate of the early Cold War discouraged the public discussion of Leftleaning critiques of the United States, including its racism. A testament to Du Bois’s refusal to buckle, in 1949 he was still condemning the United States, stating in one speech, with clear echoes of Black Reconstruction, that the country was “leading the world to hell in a new colonialism with the same old human slavery which once ruined us.” Such unapologetic criticisms, as well as growing ties to Far Left writers and thinkers, put Du Bois on the margins of the day’s academic life. They also, however, meant that he anticipated the emergence of a thread of more critical and radical work in the late 1950s and 1960s. Du Bois would visit the Soviet Union and communist China before passing away in Ghana in 1963.\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 8\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nThese forces came to a head in the late 1950s and 1960s, a pivotal moment in the evolution of the historical profession as universities and colleges in the United States expanded. A handful of well-placed scholars authored influential studies, offered new interpretations, and trained small armies of PhDs who went on to their own distinguished careers. In this key period, Black Reconstruction received only checkered attention in undergraduate and graduate classrooms. The volume was reissued in 1956 and garnered at least occasional discussion on the political Left. But Black Reconstruction did not make a deep imprint on the changing historiographies of Reconstruction and U.S. empire, which were both going through major revisions. Those revisions were, in and of themselves, amenable to Du Bois’s imperial thesis. With Reconstruction, a tremendous volume of thorough pro–civil rights scholarship reexamined abolition, enfranchisement, and white supremacist reaction in the South, often with an emphasis on local history from the bottom up. In diplomatic history, meanwhile, a series of sweeping reinterpretations by William Appleman Williams and his students attributed U.S. overseas imperialism to the boom-and-bust cycle of industrial capitalism and the need, or perceived need, to acquire export markets. It is surprising that scholars working in both of these veins rarely if ever discussed or even cited Black Reconstruction despite his emphasis on grassroots African American politics and the driving force of industrial capitalism. It is far from absurd to imagine the leftist Williams reading and engaging with Black Reconstruction’s critical view of industrial capitalism, or the pro–civil rights syntheses of Reconstruction from the 1960s addressing its longterm impact on the globe with Du Bois in mind. Black Reconstruction’s imperial thesis, in part because it was in need of elaboration and deliberation, was ideally suited for sustaining discussion between these two increasingly distant bodies of scholarship. Instead, Reconstruction scholars and diplomatic historians seemed to move in different worlds, with the gulf enduring until this century. It is telling that few of the many excellent historiographical essays reviewing the origins of the United States’ turn-of-the-century overseas empire mention either Du Bois or Reconstruction even in passing. Likewise, the period from 1940 to 1990 witnessed only a handful of diplomatic studies that framed themselves as about Reconstruction, with Reconstruction studies returning the favor. If earlier scholarship missed the opportunity to explore the connections between these two topics, historians are now primed to revisit them. Three early-twentyfirst-century trends, in particular, have laid the foundation for broader debates about how Union victory and abolition contoured the rise of the United States as\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 9\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\n10\n\nDavid Prior\n\na regional hegemon with an overseas empire. In bringing these three trends into a common conversation, we would be well served to keep Du Bois’s imperial thesis in mind. Although scholars will no doubt disagree about it, its clarity, sweep, and originality make it ideal for thinking through the big picture. First, the diplomatic history of U.S. imperialism—both as a broader phenomenon and as it pertains to the turn-of-the-century expansionism in particular— has increasingly merged the social and the cultural with the political and administrative. No longer just “maps and chaps,” diplomatic history constitutes an eclectic and expansive field of study. Often concerned with the agency of the colonized and the permeability of national and cultural borders, scholarship from the late 1990s to the present shows us a global landscape replete with diverse actors capable of operating against, around, and through imperial power. Afro-Cubans and Filipino students studying in the United States, Filipino musicians touring the United States with an African American conductor, and interracial couples settling the imperial frontier in the Philippines all point to patterns of relations that existed within and alongside the formal structures of U.S. colonial administrations. Together, this literature tends to add needed nuance to Du Bois’s emphasis on unremitting domination by European and American industrial powers while also affirming his concerns with their common investment in racial ideologies and with the nexus of economic and military power. This scholarship has, moreover, fleshed out an ideological portrait of a U.S. empire that fused Jim Crow racism, humanitarian ambitions, and progressive reform. A synthesis awaits of the Reconstruction-era experiences of the foot soldiers, administrators, boosters, and critics of the United States’ overseas empire. Second, Reconstruction scholarship, which has long been thematically expansive but geographically focused, has recently taken interest in transnational connections. Post-emancipation struggles in the South remain integral to the field, but now so too is Reconstruction’s embeddedness within a globalizing world. Immigrants who played active roles in Reconstruction’s political battles, the global resonances of domestic struggles over slavery and democracy, and reactions to events abroad have all elicited sustained attention. The cosmopolitan expansionist William H. Seward, secretary of state from 1861 to 1869, once seemed ahead of his time—a lonely harbinger of empire out of place during a period when domestic political turmoil drew national energies inward. Now, he seems much more like a representative figure of a mid-century political culture obsessed with and divided over the United States’ place in the world and transitioning from proslavery antebellum land grabs to steam-driven commercial imperialism. As yet, however, we lack a composite picture from this growing\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 10\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nliterature. Perhaps earlier debates among Reconstruction scholars over whether the changes shaping postbellum Southern history were radical and sweeping or limited and tenuous are already being recapitulated among scholars who take a global angle. Is postbellum U.S. engagement with the world—diplomatic, cultural, and intellectual—best understood for its egalitarian, emancipatory declarations or a deeper-lying conservatism? Du Bois saw the overthrow of interracial democracy in the postbellum South as a key moment in the United States’ embrace of a global imperial order centered on racism and economic exploitation. Yet some might argue that the trends heading in that direction were already sufficiently in place by the 1860s to ensure such an outcome. Still others might call attention to the persistence of reform currents and humanitarian ideals well after the white-supremacist victories of 1876–1877. Either way, these two historiographical trends make clear that there is now plenty of thematic and topical overlap between scholarship on Reconstruction and turn-of-the-century U.S. imperialism, however exactly scholars attempt to define and redefine those terms. Third, the early twenty-first century has seen the proliferation of wide-ranging narrative histories. Their sweeping, distinctive, and sometimes contending interpretations deliberately connect oft-siloed subjects, laying the foundation for a series of broader interpretive debates about the decades following the Civil War. With an eye on the differences between works such as David Blight’s Race and Reunion, Heather Cox Richardson’s West from Appomattox, and Caroline Janney’s Remembering the Civil War, we should continue to debate the extent to which Southern white supremacists were successful in shaping the culture and politics of the late-nineteenth-century United States. Similarly, Steven Hahn’s A Nation without Borders, Richard White’s The Republic for Which It Stands, and Charles Postel’s Equality should leave us pondering whether the day’s leading social and political movements and diverse cultures of work and leisure were opposed to industrial capitalism itself, or just particular features of it. These works give ample reason to consider Du Bois’s argument that the United States went through a spiritual change and became a reactionary force in the world. Borrowing from him, we might ask whether, if there was a turning away from the radical possibilities of the 1860s, this change wasn’t instead doctrinal in nature, with slight modifications in specific beliefs entailing dramatic real-world consequences. Nina Silber, in reviewing scholarship on postbellum sectionalism, has pointed to works showing that “even relatively subtle changes in thinking, including attitudes about race, may have opened intellectual doors to reconciliation.” No doubt the same case could be made for views of industrialization, big business, and empire. Either way, the remarkable lives of Albert Parsons, the\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 11\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\n12\n\nDavid Prior\n\nex-Confederate who married across the color line and became an anarchist martyr, and William Ellis, the former slave who passed as Mexican, married across the color line in the other direction, and became a celebrity businessman, remind us that attitudes toward opportunities and risks reflected complex life histories that often ran back to the twin pivots of abolition and Union victory. These three trends provide grounds for a closing thought experiment: imagining how scholars might have built—and might still build—a larger scholarly debate around Du Bois’s imperial thesis through good-faith challenges to it. One potential counterargument would be that Reconstruction mattered to the evolution of U.S. global power because, from some perspectives, it was a success. The reunion of the North and South on antislavery terms, but without full racial equality, was precisely what many moderate Northern Republicans wanted. Slavery was out of the South, the South was in the Union. The postbellum settlement, this line of thinking might go, therefore left Northern Republicans confident in their moral authority and happy to attribute postbellum shortcomings to the backwardness of Southerners, Black and white. Northern Republicans’ imperialism would echo this view, promising uplift but writing off those who seemed to stand in its way. Another approach would be to turn Du Bois’s references to industrial and colonial enslavement on their head. As some of his critics at the time pointed out, Black Reconstruction tended to elide technical distinctions among different modes of labor exploitation. Indeed, Du Bois’s usage of the term “slavery” to describe industrial and colonial labor regimes can be vexing, sometimes seeming metaphorical and at other times literal. That ambiguity leaves room to present a countervailing emphasis on how the Civil War, in a process consummated by Reconstruction, destroyed chattel slavery in the United States right before industrial capitalism’s decades’-long ascent. Much to the modern world’s benefit, some could stress, the postbellum expansion of civil and political rights capped off the foreclosing of a bleak and once-imminent historical trajectory in which a powerful class of pro-imperial slaveholders survived into a very different gilded age. For all the welcomed debate about whether Confederates won the peace, we should remember that secessionists had wanted to preserve not only white supremacy but also their absolute legal right for themselves and their descendants to own another class of human beings in perpetuity. Just as the South’s former slaveholders never closed all the doors that Reconstruction opened for African Americans, they never opened all the doors it shut on them. Finally, there is room to challenge Du Bois’s imperial thesis by calling attention to the late-nineteenth-century triumph of antislavery norms. Scholars such\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 12\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nas Eric Foner and Barbara Gannon have stressed that Northern attitudes to race and slavery were related but distinct topics. Even many Northerners who openly expressed doubts about or distaste for African Americans celebrated the Union’s destruction of slavery as a triumph. After the Civil War, slavery as an institution was broadly stigmatized while the mid-nineteenth-century counterweight to racism, Christian notions of human equality, waned in intellectual authority. As a result, late-nineteenth-century conservatives turned to antislavery rhetoric to advance causes such as Chinese exclusion and preventing Philippine independence. Perhaps, moreover, Northerners’ self-congratulatory embrace of antislavery principles at once secured the place of humanitarian ideals in the mainstream and made it difficult for them to own up to their own complicity in the oppression and exploitation of others. No doubt still other alternative narratives of the path from Reconstruction to empire exist. Constructing them should help bridge the gap between the scholarship on these two topics, and hopefully render a sharper understanding of the postbellum, post-abolition United States and the increasingly imperial world it was embedded in. The chapters here offer fine-grained studies that explore the manifold ways that the developments stemming from Union victory and abolition anticipated, shaded into, and intersected with the geopolitical rise of the United States. They show the complex political divisions and cultural changes of the late-nineteenthcentury United States as forming a part of a contentious world of empires, colonies, and nation-states. The composite portrait is one of diverse actors, shifting ideologies, and contradictory continuities operating form a domestic landscape struck through with global connections. The chapters appear in a roughly chronological order. Andre Fleche, in his “The Last Filibuster,” explores the careers of two Civil War veterans, one Union and one Confederate, in Cuba’s Ten Years’ War (1868–1878). Federico Fernández Cavada, a Cuban-born Union soldier and, briefly, a U.S. consular official on the island, witnessed the start of the rebellion and quickly sided with it. Although the Cuban insurgents had a complicated relationship with abolition, Cavada saw in their struggle the possibility of an antislavery republic and the potential birth of a free labor empire through the island’s annexation to the United States. Former Confederate general Thomas Jordan, in contrast, arrived as a soldier of fortune with a mixed band of Union and Confederate soldiers. Yet Jordan, who was a newspaper editor and an apologist for KKK-founder Nathan Bedford Forrest, also brought ideological baggage with him. Both men’s Cuban\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 13\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\n14\n\nDavid Prior\n\ncareers embodied the conflicted interplay of national identity and slavery across the New World and help illuminate them. In Chapter 2, Christina C. Davidson looks at the tenuous and sometimes fraught relationships centered on the African Methodist Episcopal Church’s history in the Caribbean. This story begins in the 1820s, when African American members of the church began moving to the island of Hispaniola, then unified under Haitian control. Yet these AME communities soon languished on the largely Catholic island. As they struggled, however, the AME Church in the United States went through a sweeping transformation as abolition and civil rights opened a vast new field of missionary activity within the United States. Soon, the denomination looked outward. Hispaniola would be the first foreign missionary field for the AME Church during this new era, predating its betterknown efforts to evangelize Africa. But this was an ambivalent and hesitating start to the church’s missionary project, which sat awkwardly at the nexus of expanding U.S. influence and Afro-diasporic connections. “Domestic Stability and Imperial Continuities,” by Gregg French, situates the postbellum United States’ relations with Spain within a longer history that featured an oft-forgotten tradition of alliance and respect. Although certain negative views of the Spanish Empire existed, in particular those stemming from the Black Legend, so too did a sense of historical connection to a European power that was credited with discovering the Americas and that had supported the American Revolution. In the postbellum United States, this tradition merged with transatlantic racial ideas and anxieties within the United States over simmering sectional animosities. The man who most fully embodied these trends was the conservative Northern secretary of state Hamilton Fish, who worked assiduously to tamp down expansionistic and anti-Spanish policy suggestions within President Ulysses S. Grant’s administrations. His tenure, which saw Grant’s attempts to annex the Dominican Republic and nearly the full duration of the Ten Years’ War in Cuba, anticipated the inter-imperial transfer of authority that would end the Spanish-American War. In Chapter 4, Adrian Brettle explores how Virginia conservatives forged alliances in and reconciled themselves to the Union after the Civil War, in the process sustaining elements of their older Confederate imperialism in the reUnited States. Looking at the careers of individuals such as John Letcher (governor of Confederate Virginia), Robert M. T. Hunter (Confederate secretary of state and a former U.S. senator), and J. Randolph Tucker (state attorney general during the war), Brettle offers a composite picture of a depressed but ultimately resilient elite who sought the future glory of their state and section within the\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 14\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nnation. Moods oscillated with federal politics, but Virginia conservatives took their chances when they had them, reintegrating themselves into national politics through alliances with former Whigs and then the Democratic Party. With growing enthusiasm, many sought to renew Confederate projects, including the building of a southern Pacific railroad, regional internal improvements, and international free trade. Lawrence Glickman, in “James Redpath, Rebel Sympathizer,” fathoms one abolitionist’s circuitous route to sectional reconciliation by viewing it alongside his deepening opposition to the British Empire. Redpath was, as Glickman shows, a lifelong devotee to radical causes and a tireless and often ingenious entrepreneurial reformer. It is with this in mind that two of his post-Reconstruction causes seem so odd together. On the one hand, Redpath became a relentless critic of the British Empire, especially in the name of Irish independence. On the other, Redpath refrained from extending his antebellum criticisms of slavery, and in particular his interest in hearing the voices of the enslaved, into an attack on postbellum white supremacy. In fact, he expressed doubts about African Americans’ capacity for equal citizenship, suggested they abandon their confrontational stance toward Southern whites, and befriended former Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Redpath still spoke in defense of the weak, including Indians and Egyptians fighting against British rule, but showed more sympathy for Southern whites than African Americans. The sixth chapter, by Mark Elliott, examines four patriotic reformers whose careers stretched from Reconstruction to the birth of the United States’ overseas empire. O. O. Howard, Julia Ward Howe, Lyman Abbott, and Clara Barton provide prominent examples of how patriotic fervor in the North merged with zeal for fighting against suffering at home and abroad. Distinguishing this humanitarian internationalism was a faith—forged in the Civil War and Reconstruction—that the federal government could and should intervene in support of just causes. Part and parcel of this humanitarian concern was a sense of cultural, national, and racial superiority that saw white Americans, especially Northerners, overseeing the uplift of the rest of the world. The complex interplay of those ideas shaped private and public campaigns in the South, Armenia, Russia, the Caribbean, and the Philippines. In his “Connected Lives,” David Holtby explores the political legacies of the Civil War and Reconstruction during a period of economic turmoil. Spanning the final third of the nineteenth century, Holtby shows how imperialism served as a generational bridge for Union veterans in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) and the rising midwestern Republican Albert Beveridge. This connection,\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 15\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\n16\n\nDavid Prior\n\nand in particular the promises of commercial prosperity and national mission that Beveridge saw in U.S. empire, spoke directly to Gilded Age anxieties that Beveridge knew through his father’s postbellum struggles. Holtby also shows us the interplay of enduring sectional antagonisms with reconciliationist ideas grounded in racial identities. Even as President William McKinley and Beveridge used the War with Spain to foster North-South unity, one of imperialism’s major senatorial opponents would be Benjamin Tillman, a leading Southern white supremacist. Indeed, a wedge opened between Beveridge and the GAR, which held fast to its role in suppressing the Confederate rebellion. Chapter 8, by DJ Polite, looks at Jim Crow violence, the memory of Reconstruction, and debates over imperialism. America’s War with Spain began during a wave of racist terrorism in the Carolinas, including an attack on the household of Frazier Baker, the African American federal postmaster for Lake City, South Carolina. As Polite shows, these attacks evoked a longer history of violence and poignantly contradicted the emancipatory rhetoric Americans used in their war with Spain. African American newspapers demanded action, and anti-lynching crusader Ida Wells-Barnett worked with George White, the only Black member of Congress, to pressure the McKinley administration to launch a federal investigation. Tillman again played a key role, raising the specter of a return to carpetbag rule while railing against American imperialism, although his fellow South Carolina senator, John McLaurin, ultimately outmaneuvered him. Reilly Ben Hatch, in his “Reconstruction, Imperialism, and the Evolution of Mormon Patriotism,” analyzes the place of the war with Spain and the occupation of the Philippines in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Hatch analyzes Mormon doctrine concerning patriotism, religious freedom, and violence, as well as popular anti-Mormon sentiment. As he shows, the wars came only eight years after the church hierarchy suspended the practice of polygamy and only two years after Utah’s statehood, which contemporaries and now historians view as capping off a Mormon Reconstruction. Mormons were initially ambivalent about the War with Spain, unsure of how to reconcile their brand of patriotism with holy peacemaking. The Mormon leadership divided but then embraced military service, with an outpouring of volunteering from Mormon communities across Utah. The experience of war, including the occupation of the Philippines, would prove more trying and divisive, but afforded a chance for Mormons to move toward the U.S. mainstream. In the tenth chapter, Brian Shott takes Louis Dalrymple’s 1899 Puck cartoon, “School Begins,” as a vantage point from which to consider the polyvalent place\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 16\n\n12/3/21 12:25:22 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nof racial ideas and identities in turn-of-the-century politics and culture. Featuring a stern Uncle Sam as a schoolteacher and four sullen, dark-skinned children representing the Philippines, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, the cartoon seems a racist, pro-imperial piece. Shott calls into question just how straightforward it is, illuminating that while racism is clearly central to it, what precisely the author intended and how audiences would have received it is harder to fathom. If hardly anti-imperial, the piece was layered with symbols, including an African American child with a bucket, evoking Booker T. Washington, and a well-kempt Chinese child excluded from the classroom. Especially viewed alongside other nineteenth-century cartoons featuring racial politics, “School Begins” invites a second look for its ambiguities and nuances. Justin Jackson, in “An Empire of Reconstructions,” examines together the histories of U.S. military occupations in the South after the Civil War and Cuba following the defeat of Spain. His comparisons between the two military administrations explore important continuities and changes in the culture of armed occupation, as well as their implications for the hemispheric history of racial equality. The two took place in different contexts, but also shared divisive questions over race, political power, reform, and control of economic resources. The two episodes in military government highlight important shifts in ideas about sovereignty and governance in the United States. Perhaps no single event marked more clearly the subtle but important ideological drift shaping U.S. occupations than the evolution of “reconstruction” itself. Associated with a radical commitment to social change before the Civil War, the occupation of Cuba remade reconstruction into a postwar mode of foreign rule involving commitments to capitalist development. In her Afterword, Rebecca Edwards surveys the volume and its place in scholarship on the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century United States. Notes 1.

This scholar is skeptical that singular definitions of “empire,” “imperialism,” and “Reconstruction” will ever prevail in academic usage. To the extent that this volume uses what might be called conventional and restricted definitions of the terms, it is to make the point that even when these are in effect, there is still good reason to study the United States’ Reconstruction and its empire together. It is true by definition that expanding the meaning of these terms so that they encompass more of U.S. history, as the contributors sometimes do, magnifies the number of thematic and causal linkages between the historical processes they refer to.

Du Bois, for example, felt more comfortable than most scholars today likely would in describing Southern freedpeople as ignorant and in attributing a lack of ambition, self-respect, and refinement to Black life in the South in the decades following the Civil War. Du Bois’s point in doing so was to illustrate the oppressive nature of white supremacist rule, but more recent scholarship tends to accentuate the sagacity and resilience of Southern freedpeople and their children. Du Bois also addressed the religious meanings of emancipation in ways at once sympathetic yet distant from his own and presumably his readers’ beliefs. See, for example, W. E. B. Du Bois, Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880 (1935; New York: Free Press, 1992), 124, 605–607, 611, 618, 701. For a brief comment on Du Bois’s views of religion and his idea of the talented tenth in Black Reconstruction, see Foner, “Black Reconstruction,” 416–417. For a statement on Du Bois’s enduring faith in middle-class black leadership in the 1930s, see Manning Marable, W. E. B. Du Bois: Black Radical Democrat (Boston: Twayne, 1986), 143, 147–148. 23.

Also of note, Du Bois’s original title for the volume, Black Reconstruction of Democracy in America, arguably conveyed a slightly different meaning than the “reconstruction in” of the final, published title, the subtitle of which also used the verb “reconstruct.” See David Levering Lewis, introduction to Black Reconstruction in America, by W. E. B. Du Bois (New York: Free Press, 1992), ix, and Lewis, W. E. B. Du Bois, 582. Also of note, Du Bois started but did not finish a manuscript titled “The Negro and Social Reconstruction,” which evoked pre–Civil War meaning of the term “reconstruction” as a radical, grassroots transformation. On the manuscript, see Marable, W. E. B. Du Bois, 144–145, 148–149. On scholarly disagreement over the term’s meaning, see Prior, “Reconstruction.” 29.

J. Hobsbawm, The Age of Capital, 1848–1875 (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1975), 141. Scholars willing to engage in the counterfactual exercise might ask whether the union-busting, vertically integrated corporate behemoths of the late nineteenth century would not have utilized human chattel as strikebreakers and in place of high-wage skilled workers if they could have, and whether Maryland or South Carolina state legislatures could not have reworked state laws to lure in corporate headquarters.

Fleche\n\nO\n\nn the night of October 9, 1868, the Cuban planter Carlos Manuel de Céspedes gathered his slaves and offered freedom to any who would fight alongside him in a war for independence from Spain. The ensuing conflict came to be known as the Ten Years’ War, and, though Céspedes might not have known it, the war he inaugurated initiated a debate that would engage issues of race, slavery, and citizenship in Cuba, the United States, and Spain. The Ten Years’ War called into question the future of human bondage in Cuba at the very moment politicians and the general public in the United States debated the policies of postwar Reconstruction. The Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution had destroyed slavery in the United States but had not settled the future of coerced labor in the Western world. When President Ulysses S. Grant took office in 1869, many white Southerners continued to violently resist federal laws that had granted equal citizenship rights to African Americans. Profitable slave regimes continued to exist in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. Though the Confederacy had met a decisive military defeat during the Civil War, the verdict of arms had not so clearly addressed the future of slave labor, let alone racial equality, in the Western Hemisphere. The Ten Years’ War offered observers the opportunity to reflect on the legacy of the Civil War, including both its promises and its limitations. Hundreds of U.S. citizens volunteered to fight in Cuba, and two of them—Federico Fernández Cavada, a Union veteran, and Thomas Jordan, an ex-Confederate general—would each briefly hold the rank of general-in-chief of the insurgency. The experiences and actions of the two soldiers in Cuba would shed light on the politics of Reconstruction, the future of American empire, and, ultimately, the meaning and legacy of the Civil War. For Cavada, the Union victory in the Civil War opened the door for the U.S. to establish a political economy in the Caribbean based on republican government and free labor. The abolition of slavery in the United States, he believed, would inevitably lead to the demise of human bondage in Cuba. Even more important,\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 27\n\n12/3/21 12:25:23 PM\n\n28\n\nAndre M. Fleche\n\nhe imagined liberal reform of the island’s economy would weaken Spanish rule and strengthen Cuba’s ties to the U.S. When rebellion eventually broke out, Cavada consistently argued that only an aggressive war against slavery would secure Cuban independence. Thomas Jordan, for his part, preferred to limit the impact of the Cuban conflict on the social and racial order as much as he could. Though the actions of the rebels and the outcome of the American Civil War had forced him to reconcile himself to emancipation and even Black military service, as general-in-chief, Jordan fought for an independent Cuba that would continue to preserve racial hierarchies. The two men had real differences but also similarities that have much to teach about the legacy of the Civil War. Cavada and Jordan agreed that white Americans would take the lead in shaping the Western Hemisphere, but they adapted in very different and telling ways to the promise of emancipation. The disagreement between the two veterans over Cuban policy mirrored the differences of opinion held by citizens of the United States over Reconstruction, the future of the Union, and the progress of American empire. Radical Republicans worked to ensure that the Civil War would give birth to an interracial democracy in which African Americans would enjoy civic, if not necessarily social, equality. White Southerners and Northern Democrats fought to maintain racial subordination even as they came to grips with the reality of emancipation. The two competing visions even came to divide the cabinet of President Ulysses S. Grant—as Gregg French explores further in his chapter in this volume. Grant himself had backed the abolition of slavery and supported the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal citizenship for all Americans regardless of race. With the questions of slavery and political equality settled, he believed it had become desirable to acquire racially diverse territories in the Caribbean, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. For that reason, he and Secretary of War John A. Rawlins favored intervention on behalf of the rebels in the Ten Years’ War. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish worked hard to stave off these aggressive impulses. The conservative ex-Whig, reluctant Republican, and one-time admirer of the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson, opposed action in Cuba for a number of reasons. He wished to avoid war with Spain, especially after it briefly became a republic. He also opposed the acquisition of Cuba because of its religious and linguistic differences with the U.S., and because he disapproved of adding nonwhite populations to the Union. As a result, the debate over Cuba came to reflect competing views on the politics of Reconstruction and the legacy of the Civil War. Several historians have noted parallels between the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the Ten Years’ War in Cuba. Ada Ferrer and Rebecca Scott have noted that\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 28\n\n12/3/21 12:25:23 PM\n\nThe Last Filibuster\n\n29\n\nin both the United States and Cuba slaves and free people of color fought to gain emancipation and equal rights amid the crisis of war. Matt Childs argues that the outcome of the American Civil War itself contributed to the gradual erosion of slavery in Cuba. Jay Sexton notes that U.S. foreign policy came to embrace antislavery in the years after the Civil War. “American statesmen,” Sexton concludes, “viewed the Cuban rebellion through a lens tinted by Reconstruction, the meaning of the Civil War, and an evolving and contested idea of national mission.” Greg Downs argues that the Civil War–era struggle over Cuba formed part of a revolutionary wave that swept Mexico, Spain, Cuba, and the United States, eventually promising to transform the Atlantic system of the mid-nineteenth century. Most of the historians who have examined U.S. involvement in the Cuban insurrection have focused mostly on its importance as an episode of formal stateto-state diplomacy. Historians of the domestic politics of Reconstruction have rarely drawn connections between developments at home and abroad. As the story of Cavada and Jordan shows, however, Reconstruction-era debates over race relations, slavery, and citizenship transcended U.S. borders and held important implications for the development of the Western Hemisphere. A consideration of U.S. policy toward Cuba can demonstrate just how much the Civil War had reoriented American approaches to hemispheric affairs. Cuba had for many years played an outsized role in American imperial imaginings. Its proximity, profitability, and vulnerability to European control convinced many Americans that its future would prove vital to the security of the United States. Before the Civil War, planters in the Mississippi Valley believed control of Cuba would ensure the preservation of slavery in the Americas. Private armies of adventurers made several ill-fated attempts to invade the island during the 1850s. These men were known as “filibusters,” and most of them assumed Cuba would become a slave state. The outcome of the Civil War ensured that no new slave territory would be added to the Union, but it did little to address the future of Cuba. Would Cuba also become free soil? This was a pressing question, because Cuba remained central to American imperial ambitions. It would be up to men like Jordan and Cavada—among the last of the filibusters—to help decide the future of American empire in a multiracial world. In the process, they would also demonstrate different ways of thinking about the Civil War and its meaning. Cavada and a Free Labor Empire In January 1865, during the waning months of the Siege of Petersburg, Federico Fernández Cavada returned to the land of his birth. The Cuban-born Union\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 29\n\n12/3/21 12:25:23 PM\n\n30\n\nAndre M. Fleche\n\nveteran awaited an appointment by the Lincoln administration as the new U.S. consul in the city of Trinidad de Cuba. As Cavada prepared to take his post, the geopolitical future of the Western Hemisphere stood poised to undergo breathtaking change. In the United States, Confederate armies slowly disintegrated in the trenches of Virginia, ex-slaves fought for freedom from their one-time masters, and the most radical members of the Republican Party prepared a final push for the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would abolish slavery in all of the states of the Union. Cavada reported that public thinkers in his native land immediately grasped the implications these developments might have for the future of Cuba. “The ultimate extinction of the institution of slavery over the whole Western Hemisphere,” he marveled, “seems to be accepted as an inevitable sequel to its extinction in the United States.” The “colored population,” he reported, “are not in the dark as to these great issues.” According to Cavada, even some slaveholders in Cuba had come to believe that emancipation was now inevitable. For Cavada, the destruction of slavery everywhere in the Western Hemisphere would serve as a necessary first step in the “regeneration” of the region. Like many moderate free-soilers and radical abolitionists, he believed that the institution of slavery had undermined confidence in the viability of free labor. He reported that the end of slavery in the United States had caused Cubans to begin to question the opinion that “the white race cannot labor in the fields of Cuba,” a misconception he believed needed to be dispelled. He imagined that the victorious Yankees would reinvigorate the tropics with industry and trade, thereby threatening the backward imperialism of the Spanish Empire while also revealing the limitations of his thinking on the potential of the Cuban people themselves. Though the appointment as consul was a minor diplomatic posting, Cavada held excellent credentials to advance his understanding of the Civil War. Cavada presented himself to William Henry Seward, the U.S. secretary of state, as an expert on Cuba and as an enthusiastic supporter of Seward’s goals to expand American influence in Latin America. During the early 1850s, Cavada had served on Col. John C. Trautwine’s expedition to survey a route for a railroad across Panama, a key step in advancing the goals of American imperialists who sought to make the United States a true two-ocean power. Like many Unionists, both Cavada and Seward believed that U.S. interests in Latin America would be best served by establishing a network of free republics committed to free labor. With slavery destroyed, those countries might safely become new states for the American Union.\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 30\n\n12/3/21 12:25:23 PM\n\nThe Last Filibuster\n\n31\n\nStill, Cavada found neither political nor human freedom in the Caribbean. When he arrived in Cuba, the island remained the most important possession in Spain’s diminished but still dynamic empire. In 1860, Cuba’s plantations produced between 30 and 40 percent of the world’s cane sugar, and well more than 300,000 men, women, and children, almost one-third of the total population, continued to labor as slaves. Over the course of the decade, Cubans imported more than 30,000 more enslaved human beings from Africa. Planters also experimented with Chinese contract laborers, who toiled as unpaid apprentices while working off their terms of service. For a time, it appeared that the American Civil War might augur the return of Old World empire in the hemisphere, not the end of monarchy and slavery. In 1861, Spain re-annexed the Dominican Republic. The Lincoln administration remonstrated but dared not intervene due to the growing secession crisis. The year 1865, though, offered hope for dramatic change. That year, the Spanish Abolition Society held its first meeting in Madrid. In Cuba, the pace of slave importation remained significant but had begun to decline. During the war, Seward had agreed to cooperate with Great Britain in cracking down on the illicit slave trade that had sustained Cuba’s plantations. The Spanish Empire also faced setbacks in the Caribbean. A violent guerrilla insurgency emerged in the Dominican Republic, and in 1865, the Spanish army began a withdrawal. Despite these encouraging events, Cavada’s Cuba seemed to remain firmly in the grip of Spanish colonialism. As a U.S. consul, he repeatedly came up against the barriers of Spanish imperial law. In 1866, for example, he scrambled to secure a civil marriage for a young American couple. As Americans and presumably Protestants, the pair could not find a priest willing to perform a ceremony. Cavada bemoaned the lack of separation between the Roman Catholic Church and the state, which made it “impossible” for them “to conform to the religious requirements of this country.” Cavada grew even more frustrated with Cuba’s imperial administrators when he attempted to have his brother, Adolfo, commissioned as a consular agent. Adolfo, who had served in the Union army and earned a position on the staff of General Andrew A. Humphreys, had taken a job in a merchant house in Cienfuegos. Despite the fact that he was, as Federico explained to Seward, “an American citizen, who served with credit throughout the late war,” Spain refused to accept him as a representative of the United States because he had been born a Spanish subject and considered him one in perpetuity. Cavada raged against the new policy, claiming it made his work increasingly “difficult.”\n\nF7963-Prior.indb 31\n\n12/3/21 12:25:23 PM\n\n32\n\nAndre M. Fleche\n\nCavada did not have long to wait to strike a blow against the Spanish Empire. Céspedes’s declaration of independence, known in Cuba as the “Grito de Yara,” promised to upend what Cavada believed had been centuries of misrule. On February 5, 1869, he wrote to Seward to resign his diplomatic commission so that he might volunteer to serve the rebellion. The insurgency quickly developed into a full-fledged war. In April, Horatio Fox, Cavada’s successor, reported from Trinidad to Hamilton Fish, the new U.S. secretary of state, that “the insurrection in this neighborhood is still in full force, although the Govment continues to make strong efforts to suppress it.” Spanish authorities rounded up American citizens and Cubans suspected of aiding the rebellion. Cavada did not number among the detained. He made his way to rebel lines, and rebel authorities promptly commissioned him a general in the district of Trinidad. He later explained his decision to enlist, speaking often about his desire to “put an end to the atrocious Govt of Spain in Cuba.” The imperial government, he implied, had routinely denied basic civil liberties, which were worth risking death to fight for. “Today the Cuban in Cuba,” he wrote, “suffers but speaks,—dies but kills.” The Cuban insurgency also offered the hope that an independent Cuba might become a partner and perhaps even "
