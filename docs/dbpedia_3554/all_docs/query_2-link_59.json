The questions the investigators have to face are numerous and therefore somewhat different methods and approaches will be used relating to each problem. In fact, the methods and approaches mainly depend on the amount and quality of our primary sources since we do not have any other choice than to accept the limitations of our primary material. Nevertheless, we may say that in general, historical methods, as well as anthropological models and theories will be used. Furthermore, archaeological and linguistic information helps us considerably to understand some spatial and administrative principles and structures of Tawantinsuyu. In general we may say that one must act like a historian when dealing with chroniclers and other written documents. However, after the investigator has evaluated, for example, a chronicler's original sources, a chronicler's possibility to understand the phenomenom they were describing, the validity of their information and so on, he, the investigator, must act more like an anthropologist to seek the structures Tawantinsuyu was composed of. Of course, it is impossible to document all the details of the analyzing processes which lie behind the final description, but when an investigator uses terms like dualism, triadism, corvee, sacred center and so on, one may be aware that he is referring to theoretical models and constructions which, he hopes, may help us in understanding the phenomena under analysis. However, in more detailed parts of description scholars willingly use original 19\n\nQuechua and Aymara terms like suyu,1 saya, ayllu, hatha, curaca, mallku, apo, hanan, chhulla, etc, because those terms have meanings which cannot be translated by using only one or two words. The same is true with Spanish terms like cacique principal, segunda persona, cabecera, orejon and so on, which had specific meanings in 16th century Spanish Peru. In this study I especially try to seek those structures which prevailed for a considerable time through all those changes that occured during the Conquest period, since the fact is that although the Spanish conquest in 1532 destroyed the upper level of hierarchy in the Incaic political organization, the break did not destroy everything equally. Especially those political structures which were based on earlier \"pre-existing\" sociopolitical principles in the middle and lower levels of hierarchy left their traces many times up to Toledoan reductions realized in the 1570s and sometimes (especially in the highlands) even up today (depending on factors such as demography). In practice, more than the history of events I am studying the history of structures and the principles of organization which had a long duration (longue duree) in the sense of Fernand BRAUDEL.2 It is also important to note that we can only see the past and foreign cultures in the mirror of the concepts and modes of thought of our own culture. Furthermore, in the case of Tawantinsuyu we are mainly forced to see the foreign culture through the 16th century Spanish eyes. However, by observing the Andean ways to categorize and the systems of thought in some \"native sources,\" we may try to catch an awareness of those principles the Inca and local administrative organizations were based on. After all, an Andean man was a human being as we are and he also used logic which is intelligible to us. Because of that, we have hope that the structures and principles of the political organization of the Inca state can be described, within the limitations of our own culture, by using Western language and by our own systems of thought. However, we should nevertheless be aware that the inner content\n\n1 2\n\n20\n\nI will normally write words and names in Quechua and Aymara as found in the 16th century sources. However, that \"rule\" is not very exact. For example, I will write khipu instead of quipo. BRAUDEL (1958; 1958-1960) 1980:25-54, 64-82.\n\nof those principles may be something we cannot grasp or fully share.' Considerably few Peruvian chronicles were published in the 16th and 17th centuries and it was only during the second half of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century when most of the classic chronicles about the Incas saw daylight.4 Since then only a few \"Inca chronicles\" like Guaman Poma's \"Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno\" ([1615] 1936, 1987), Martin de Murua's \"Historia general del Peru\" ([1616] 1962-64, 1987) and the complete version of Betanzo's \"Suma y narración de los incas\" ([1551] 1987) have seen the first print. Before many chronicles were published, writers like Michel de MONTAIGNE, Francois de VOLTAIRE, Lewis Henry MORGAN (and Friedrich ENGELS who followed MORGAN) had used the Inca empire as an example of a certain ideal or underdeveloped type of society.5 On the other hand, the time when the most Peruvian chronicles were published produced a period when many classic syntheses about Inca society were written by authors like CUNOW ([1896] 1937), MARKHAM (1912), BAUDIN (1928), MEANS (1931), KARSTEN ([1938] 1946) and ROWE (1946). Of these, ROWE's overview is still one of our most important studies about Inca society. Furthermore, somewhat later, authors like MURRA ([1955] 1980), MASON ([1957] 1978), MOORE (1958), von HAGEN (1961), VALCARCEL (1964) and HEMMING (1970) wrote their own interpretations about the Inca state, but as John V. MURRA has pointed out, all of them used the same sources, and if studies of BAUDIN, ROWE , MURRA and HEMMING differ \"it is in matters of interpretation and ideology.\" He also states that most of all this is due to the limited amount of time \"contemporary historians have invested in looking for new sources. \"6 In fact, MURRA is one of those most important ethnohistorians who started \"a new era\" in the Inca studies by emphasizing the\n\n3 4 5 6\n\nSee also SALOMON 1986:2-9. Before most of those chronicles had been published, PRESCOTT (1847) had used their manuscripts in his classic work \"Conquest of Peru.\" For a more detailed analysis of the texts of Montaigne and Voltaire, see WEDIN 1966:3-5; see also MORGAN 1877 and ENGELS 1884. MURRA 1985:61.\n\n21\n\nnecessity to search for new sources (instead of continuous use of the same well-read chronicles) to understand the structures and principles underlying Andean economic, social and political organizations (MURRA [1964] 1966; 1967; 1968,1970; 1972 etc.). After MURRA focused our interest on early Spanish administrative documents like village by village or house by house inspections called visitas (Diez de San Miguel [1567] 1964; Ortiz de Zliniga [1562] 1967, 1972), other visitas and local sources like \"Probanzas\" and \"Informaciones\" have been published. Especially Waldemar ESPINOZA SORIANO and Maria ROSTWOROWSKI DE DIEZ CANSECO have been active in this respect. Thanks to these new sources our understanding about the Andeans have grown considerably and it has become evident that the earlier ideal \"heliocentric\" image about Inca society does not stand criticism. As Richard P. SCHAEDEL (1988) says: \"This image has changed in the course of the last three decades of ethnohistorical research, a period in which everything that had been accepted as axiomatic about the Incas has been subject to reappraisal.\"' During the last decades our knowledge has grown especially concerning Andean economic organizations. Concepts such as reciprocity, redistribution and ecological complementary and vertical control have become familiar to us, thanks to the pioneering works of MURRA which have stimulated many other outstanding studies.8 It is also important to note that from the 1960s onward Tom ZUIDEMA (1962, 1977, 1978, 1986, 1990) and later on scholars like AVENI (1980) and URTON (1981) have focused attention on the Incaic kinship and social organization in Cuzco and its relation to ceques, rituals, calendar, astronomy and cosmology. Also ROWE's (1979; 1985a) studies about the ceque-system and the social organization of Cuzco merit attention as well as his publication and comments about the text of Capac Ayllu (1985b). In addition, scholars like DUVIOLS (1967, 1971), DEMAREST (1981), and ROSTWOROWSKI (1986) have pushed our knowledge forward about the Inca religion; and scholars like WACHTEL\n\n7 SCHAEDEL 1988:768. 8 See, for example, SALOMON 1985, 1986; PEASE 1979, 1985; HARRIS 1985; MORRIS 1985.\n\n22\n\n(1973, 1990), OSSIO (1973), LOPEZ-BARALT (1979), ADORNO (1978, 1986), CERECEDA (1985, 1988), PLATT (1986, 1988), HARRIS (1986) BOUYSSE-CASSAGNE (1986, 1987), in turn, have done the same relating to knowledge about some aspects of symbolism and ideologies of Andean thought. However, our knowledge about the political organization of Tawantinsuyu has not reached the same level as, for example, our knowledge about its economic organizations. We do have some excellent case studies which, among other things, refer to sociopolitical organizations relating to areas like Lupaca (MURRA 1968,1970), Huånuco (MURRA 1967; MORRIS & THOMPSON 1985, etc.) Canta, Lima (ROSTWOROWSKI 1968-1969; 1978), Chachapoya (ESPINOZA SORIANO 1967), Chuncho (SAIGNES 1985), Chicama (NETHERLY 1984, 1988) Macha (PLATT 1986, 1988), Laymi (HARRIS 1986), Sora (DEL RIO 1990) and so on. Although sometimes scholars have willingly enlarged the results of one or a few case studies to apply to the whole empire, the fact is that we do not yet have an adequate overall view of the administrative structure of the Inca state. Craig MORRIS (1985) has even stated that we \"do not have sufficient evidence to begin to describe the overall structure and organization of Tawantinsuyu.\" He notes especially that quadripartite \"and the often seemingly competing systems of dual, tripartite and decimal principles all deserve detailed study.\"9 In fact, Maria ROSTWOROWSKI (1986; 1988) has already tried to make some kind of overall summary about the religious, social, political and economic structures of Tawantinsuyu on the basis of the classic chroniclers and the local sources she herself has published on various occasions. However, although her summaries grasp some important points, she only superficially touches the question of political organization. In general, it may be true that we do not yet have enough published sources to start a profound approach to this topic. On the other hand, if we may use archival manuscripts for published sources, I think such an approach is possible. For that purpose I have used considerable energy in searching for those new sources as MURRA has asked us to do. 9\n\nMORRIS 1985:478-479.\n\n23\n\nIn 1985 I started to research archival material at the Archive of the Indies in Seville which was familiar to me because of a short two-month visit I had made there in 1982. After I had spent a year in Seville I began to plan my first field expedition to Peru and Bolivia which I finally realized in 1987. During a period of ca. two and a half months I mapped many old settlements, especially in the area of Cajamarca, Arequipa and Caquiaviri and did archival research at Archivo Departamental de Cajamarca, Archivo Departamental de la Libertad, Trujillo and finally at Archivo Departamental de Arequipa. I spent the academic year of 1987/1988 at the University of Rochester (New York), concentrating my attention on the theories of social anthropology and anthropological linguistics in order to complement my earlier theoretical training in general history (University of Turku, Finland) and archaeology (University of Turku and University of Helsinki, Finland). After that I have researched additional material at Archivo National de Bolivia, Sucre, at Archivo histörico de Potosi, at Archivo de La Paz and during the winter of 1990/1991 again at the Archive of the Indies in Seville. During two field periods in the years 1989 and 1990 I have also led archaeological excavations in Caquiaviri (Pacasa), organized by the Department of History (University of Turku), Department of Archaeology (University of Helsinki) and Instituto Nacional de Arqueologia, Bolivia, and sponsored by the Academy of Finland. The results of that project will be soon published in a separate book, \"Caquiaviri y la provincia de Pacasa 300-1825.\" On the other hand, the general results of my archival and other studies relating to the political organization of Tawantinsuyu can already be seen in this study. In this book I will start my presentation by describing the Inca systems for recording many kinds of information and explaining how the oral tradition and \"written texts\" were finally transmitted to the next generations. The understanding of that system is extremely important since it also helps us find the most \"original\" khipu-based parts of certain chronicles in the form which typically follows Andean classificatory logic. Furthermore, I also address attention to the question of dependency between some chronicles because that problem has methodological importance although it is often omitted by some purely anthropologically oriented 24\n\nscholars. In the second stage of this study I will compare khipubased texts, classic chronicles and local administrative sources in order to give an adequate description of the relative chronology of the Incaic expansion and to approximate the area and the total amount of people annexed into formation known as Tawantinsuyu. After that, in the third stage, I will make an excursion to those basic means and principles that regulated and governed the relations between the Incas and the conquered kingdoms. In the fourth stage I will concentrate on the question of the sociopolitical organization of Incaic Cuzco situated at the sacred heart of the empire. In that connection I will again address the importance of using khipu-based texts and other native sources in order to understand the most original principles of Andean thought and ideology reflected in the sociopolitical and spatial order. After the analysis of the sociopolitical and spatial organization of the Inca capital I will concentrate on the administrative principles, divisions and hierarchy of the rest of Tawantinsuyu down to the village level. Specific attention will be given to the questions of dual, triad, four-part and decimal principles, extending the ideas of Graig MORRIS and many others. Furthermore, to get a broader picture of these principles I will not concentrate on one or two case studies relating to each administrative level. Rather I will describe many kinds of local traditions whenever it is possible within the limits of our sources. I hope that the systematic description of different local cases helps us to understand the actual nature of the Inca government and the political complexity of the entire Inca state. Finally, I would like to stress that this study will only sporadically pay attention to the role of religion and the Inca church or to the role of economic organization, although it is true that those systems were, in reality, connected in many ways with the same structures of political and sociopolitical organizations of Tawantinsuyu. However, I think that the overall description of religious and economic organizations would be a topic of a separate study and only after such a study would we have the possibility of dealing with those organizations in the connection of \"total\" structures. 25\n\nI Sources\" 1. The Inca Texts and Writing System 1.1. The pictographic writing of the Incas We know that the Incas painted tapestry and the wooden goblets, keros, with narrative scenes.\" Furthermore, many of the important buildings of the Incas seem to have also been painted with narrative motives.12 But that is not all, according to Sarmiento de Gamboa and Cristobal de Molina. The Incas even painted their own history and myths on specific wooden boards. As Sarmiento writes:13\n\n10\n\n11 12\n\n13\n\n26\n\nThis Chapter is based on my article \"Otras fuentes escritas por los cronistas: Los casos de Martin de Monia y Pedro Gutiérrez de Santa Clara,\" published in Histörica, Vol.XIII, No.1, 1989 and a paper \"Prehispanic Central Mexican and Andean 'Writing Systems'. A Comparision between some Aztec and Inca Texts,\" presented at the University of Rochester on April 27, 1988. Another version of the same paper will be published in International Journal of the Sociology of Language. See, for example, ROWE 1961:317-341. ROWE 1946:287; BONAVIA 1985:151-175; La Gasca (1553) 1976:53. For these wall paintings an anonymous Agustinian priest ((ca. 1560] 1865:39) wrote as follows: \"Hallarse hå una cosa muy comun en todos los edificios 6 en los mas del Inga y Rey de aquella tierra, y aun hasta hoy los pintan los indios, ques unas culebras muy grandes, y dizen quel Inga tenia dos culebras por armas, y asi las he visto en muchos tambos, especialmente en el Cuzco y en Guamachuco.\" \"Y demås desto habfa, y aim agora hay, particulares historiadores destas naciones, que era oficio que se heredaba de padre a hijo. Al (1)egose a esto la grandisima diligencia del Pachacuti Inga Yupangui, noveno inga, el cual\n\n.. they had, and still have, special historians in these nations, which was a hereditary office descending from father to son. The collection of these [annals] is due to the great diligence of Pachacuti Inga Yupangui, the ninth Inca, who sent out a general summons to all the old historians in all the provinces he [had] subjugated, and even to many others throughout these kingdoms; and he had them in Cuzco for a long time, examining them concerning their antiquities, origin, and the notable events of the past in these kingdoms. And after the most notable events of their history were well investigated he ordered these things to be painted on great boards, which were deposited in a great hall of the temple(s) of the Sun; there such boards, adorned with gold, were kept as in our libraries; and he appointed \"doctors,\" who were versed in understanding and declaring their contents. And no one was allowed to enter where these boards were kept, except the Inca or the historians, without a special order of the Inca.\" Unfortunately all of these boards have disappeared and we do not have any clear idea about \"the messages\" that these paintings had contained. However, it is quite sure that in the interpretation of each painting the Inca historians and priests also needed oral texts.'¢ That's why it is reasonable to think that the method of how the paintings were used was similar to the Aztec system, which, in\n\nhizo llamamiento general en todos los viejos historiadores de todas las provincias qu61 sujet6, y aun de otras muchas mås de todos estos reinos, y tuvolos en la ciudad del Cuzco mucho tiempo, examinåndolos sobre las antiguedades, origen y cosas notables de sus pasados destos reinos. Y después que tuvo bien averiguado todo lo mås notable de las antiguedades de sus historias, hfzolo todo pintar por su orden en tablones grandes, y deput6 en las Casas del Sol una gran sala adonde las tales tablas, que guarnecidas de oro estaban, estuviesen como (en) nuestras librerfas, y constituy6 doctores que supiesen entenderlas y declararlas. Y no podfan entrar donde estas tablas estaban sino el inga o los historiadores, sin expresa licencia del inga.\" In: Sarmiento 1572:cap. 9; 1943:114-115. Similarly, but more shortly Molina ([15751 1943:7) wrote: \"Y para entender donde tuvieron origen sus idolatries; porque es asf que éstos no usaron de escritura, y tentan en una casa del Sol, llamada Poquen Cancha que es junto al Cuzco, la vida de cada uno de los Incas, y de las tierras que conquist6, pintado por sus figuras en unas tablas, y que origen tuvieron; y entre las dichas pinturas tentan asfmismo pintada la fåbula siguente:...\"; see also KARSTEN 1946:163-164. 14 Actually many chroniclers confirmed that oral texts were the most important part of the Inca \"official history,\" see, for example, Cieza de Leon 1553b:cap. xii; 1986:30-31.\n\n27\n\nturn, is generally much better known thanks to the studies of Edward E. CALNEK. In general, CALNEK demostrates that where the combined pictorial-glyphic and oral texts of the Aztec were involved, the same glyphs and symbols could be used with considerable flexibility, because any lack of clarity could be cleared up by additional oral information. The pictorial-glyphic component, consequently, \"could contain any number of diverse and seemingly unrelated points of information, since these would be drawn together and given definite meaning when combined with a verbal recitation.\"\" In fact, CALNEK gives us some excellent examples of how the Aztec combined pictorial-glyphic representations with oral texts. For example, he presents us the following figure in which he has found four significant units of information:\n\n..13 \"t\n\nFig.1. Fragment from the Tira de la Peregrinaciön (reproduced from Seler, 1902-23, v. 1, Add. 2, p. 35) (tracing).\n\n15\n\n28\n\nCALNEK 1978:242.\n\nAccording to CALNEK, those four units of information are:16 1)a broken tree; 2) five dots (an unfinished glyph for the year \"5 Tecpatl\"?) 3) an altar with the god Huitzilopochtli; and 4) a group of people engaged in a meal: But as he shows, this scene does not provide us with a complete and intelligible message in its own right. In fact, it acquires a definite meaning only when some version of the following episode from the Mexica peregrination is known:\" (translation mine) \"When they arrived in the place where a very thick tree, a ahuehuete, is standing, they settled immediately under it; soon they set up there a small altar on which they also set \"Tetzåhuitl Huitzilopochtli\"; after staying there for various days they offered him his provision and immediately, when they had already proceeded to eat they heard someone speaking to them from the top of ahuehuete and saying: \"Come here you who are there, lest the tree would fall over you since tomorrow it will fling down; because of that, they immediately ceased eating ... and it happened that when he menaced, the tree, the ahuehuete, broke down over them.\" It can be noted that the oral text compliments the exact meaning of the pictorial \"text;\" and, viewed the other way, the details of the picture compliment the oral text. CALNEK also shows how these kinds of individual pictorial scenes are \"both linked together and separated from each other by simple transitional devices, such as conventionalized footprints indicating movement in space, or calendrical glyphs denoting the\n\n16 17\n\nCALNEK 1978:246. Cuando llegaron a donde se alza un årbol muy grueso, un ahuehuete, se asentaron inmediatamente a su pie; luego levantaron allå un pequeno altar, en el que pusieron y asentaron también al \"Tetzåhuitl Huitzilopochtli\"; despu6s de hallarse alli por varios dias le ofrendaron luego sus provisiones e inmediatamente, cuando ya iban a corner, oyeron que alguien, desde lo alto del ahuehuete, les hablaba, les decfa: \"Venid acå quines ahf eståis, no sea que caiga sobre vosotros, ya que manana se derrumbarå el årbol\"; por esto dejaron de inmediato lo que comfan ... y sucedi6 que, cuando ameneci6, se desgaj6 y rompi6 sobre ellos el årbol, el ahuehuete.\" In: CALNEK 1978:246-247; Tezoz6moc (16th century) 1949: 19-20.\n\n29\n\npassage of time.\"18 Furthermore, he states that each of the scenes with the corresponding oral narration represents a single episode. That is why the exact chronological place of each episode can vary in different versions of the same story. The system itself can be represented as the following formula:19 Scene\n\nEPISODE 1\n\nI\n\nScene +(transition)+ EPISODE +etc 2 Narration Narration\n\nIt is also important to note that even the Aztec place-name and personal-name hieroglyphs had pictorial (nonphonetic) and phonetic forms.20 For example, in the following glyphs we have a place-name recorded once pictorially and once phonetically: coyote: coy-tl sandal: cac-tli = coycac\n\nAs Charles DIBBLE writes, here the glyphs refer to Coyucac, to \"'place of the Coyuca people', who were indentified by the cropped, deformed head as is indicated by the woman (or in some\n\n18 19 20\n\n30\n\nCALNEK 1978:252. CALNEK 1978:253. The place-name or personal-name hieroglyph is nonphonetic if the word recalled by the glyph can be given in any of several languages. But if the glyph calls forth a sound or a syllable with a meaning other than the object pictured, it is phonetic; see DIBBLE 1971:324-326.\n\ncases by the head alone). Phonetically recorded coyo(tl) 'coyote' plus cac(tli) 'sandal' reads Coyocac 'place of the Coyuca'.\"21 As a whole, the Aztec writing was a mixed system and only after the Spanish conquest did it develop into syllabic writing. And if compared to the Inca pictorial writing we may notice that the general principles must have been quite similar among the Aztec and among the Incas; except that only the Aztec used phonetic glyphs, since we do not have any evidence about hieroglyphic writing in the Andes.22\n\n1.2.\n\nThe system of khipu\n\nIt is generally stated that the khipu was basically a numerical system used for numerical records and as a mnemonic device.23 However, some authors such as KARSTEN, have wondered why many independent chronicles confirm that the Incas used khipus to record historical events, laws, ceremonial rites, etc.24 For example, Bernabe Cobo wrote about the khipus as follows:25 (translation by Hamilton) \"Instead of writing they used some strands of cord or thin wool strings, like the ones we use to string rosaries; and these strings were called quipos. By these recording devices and registers they conserved the memory of their acts, and the Inca's overseers and accountants used them to remember what had been received and consumed. A bunch of these quipos served them as a ledger or notebook. The quipos consisted of diverse strings of\n\n21 22\n\nDIBBLE 1971:326. However, LARCO HOYLE (1946:175) has supposed that differently marked beans in the Moche pottery paintings are one kind of glyph and he interpreted those as proof of an ideographic writing system among the Moche. On the other hand, his supposition has been under debate since the opposite view of KUTSCHER (1950:79, 84). 23 MASON 1978:230-234; ASCHER & ASCHER 1981:74-79; MORRIS & THOMPSON 1985:109; DAUELSBERG HAHMANN 1984:46-49. 24 KARSTEN 1946:159-166; see also Cieza 1553b:cap. xii; 1986:30-31; Polo de Ondegardo (1571) 1917:46; Molina (1575) 1943:17-19; Cordoua Mesia et al.

These were figures and numbers that meant various things ... On explaining their meaning, the Indians that know them relate many things about ancient times that are contained in them. There were people designated for this job of accounting. These officials were called quipo camayos, and they were like our historians, scribes, and accountants, and the Incas had great confidence in them. These officials learned with great care this way of making records and preserving historical facts. However, not all of the Indians were capable of understanding the quipos; only those dedicated to this job could do it; and those who did not study quipos failed to understand them. Even among the quipo camayos themselves, one was unable to understand the registers and recording devices of others ... There were different quipos for different kinds of things, such as for paying tribute, lands, ceremonies, and all kinds of matters pertaining to peace and war.\"\n\nIn fact, eminent scholars such as John V. MURRA and John H. ROWE have demonstrated that some khipus included stereotyped information about corvee, historical events, holy places and so on.26 However, they have not solved the problem of how the khipu system worked in practice and how much information it was possible to transmit autonomously without additional oral texts. On the other hand, Marcia ASCHER, Robert ASCHER and Carlos RADICATI DI PRIMEGLIO have recently published various books and articles about the physical aspects of khipus and about their numerical and structural contents; but not even they have sufficiently compared the technical information about the khipus to the archival information about concrete transcriptions and the Spanish translations of actual khipu texts.27 Unfortunately we do not have any concrete khipus which we could interpret by using the corresponding translation from the original text. It is even possible that no such khipus are left, since the same thing seems to have happened to most khipu records as happened to most Maya and Aztec books: they were\n\n26 MURRA (1973) 1975:241-254; 1982:237-262; ROWE: 1979:1-80; 1985b:193-245. 27 ASCHER & ASCHER 1969:526-533; 1978:1-1155; 1981; 1989: 35-48; ASCHER 1986:261-289; RADICATI DI PRIMEGLIO 1980; 1984:11-62. RADICATI has also paid attention to quilcas, colored strings without knots, which were sometimes used instead of khipus.\n\n32\n\n1\n\ndestroyed and burned by some Spanish conquistadors or clerics.28 Today, in the museums we have some four hundred khipus left, which, in turn, are mainly found in graves.29 On the other hand, in various archives we also have little known Spanish transcriptions from the original \"khipu-texts.\" Those are mainly tribute, storage or corvee records and census lists, but, in fact, those are extremely important because they give us a clear idea of how the khipuwriting worked in practice. John LOCKE demonstrated more than sixty years ago that all of the known khipus are numerical in nature and that the Incas used the decimal system in their knotted cords.30 Ones, tens, hundreds and thousands were marked down as follows:3' = 2000\n\n= 100\n\n~\n\n=30\n\n=2\n\n= 2,132 28\n\n29 30 31\n\nCordoua Mesia et al. (1582) 1925:287; However, nor did all book and khipu burning take place under Spanish conquistadors. We know that in the 15th century Aztec ruler Itzcoatl decided to destroy the existing historical writings in order to preserve a version of native history that would do justice to the Aztec state (GIBSON 1975:313; MILLER 1986:224). And the same thing seems to have happened in Peru. During the civil war between Atahualpa and Huascar (about 1530) Atahualpa seemingly wanted to destroy the old historical tradition and rewrite it, since khipu kamayoqs interviewed by Vaca de Castro told that Challcochima and Quisquis, captains of Atahualpa \"mataron todos los quipocamayos que pudieron haber a los manos y les quemaron los quipos ...\" (Quipocamayos [1542-1544] 1920:4).

However, my aim here is to prove that it is possible (both in theory and in practice). Let us examine first how the knotted cords were used as tribute and storage records. In the Archive of the Indies we have an important document dealing with manpower and objects that the Huanca gave to the Spanish conquistadors. The list of those things was transcribed and translated from the original khipus presented by the curacas of Hurin Huanca, Hanan Huanca and Jauja to the Audiencia of Lima.32 The document has also been published by W. ESPINOZA SORIANO under the title: \"Los Huancas Aliados de la Conquista. Tres informaciones inéditas sobre la participacion indigena en la conquista del Peru 1558-1560-1561,\" and furthermore, John V. MURRA has analyzed the classificatory system used in the last of the khipu-based informations, presented in 1561.33 Here I will deal with the khipu(s) presented in 1558 to the \"Audiencia.\" At first, to get the idea of what the khipu-text was like, we may take a look at the actual text which begins as follows:\n\n\" Memoria de los indios que yo don Jeronimo Guacrapåucar di al marqués don Francisco Pizarro desde que salin de Caxamarca.

[carneros, corderos]) form the category \"domesticated animals,\" and so on. Further, within each category the order is generally the same. For example, among the cultivated plants corn always appears before quinoa and potatoes. However, the system as a whole is somewhat different here from what MURRA noticed on another khipu. There, as he says, \"potatoes always appear after llamas; leather sandals (ojotas) always precede bottle gourds (porongos) and those carbon or fish.\"35 Because in our sample, llamas also appear after potatoes, it must mean that the order between different categories was not necessarily the same (although it often was), and thus the system was in this sense \"elastic.\" Anyhow, if we now compare our text to Garcilaso's account about the khipu, the system as a whole becomes more intelligible:36 \"The colors (of strings) showed what subject the thread was about, such as yellow for gold, white for silver, and red for warriors. Objects that had no special color were arranged in order, beginning with the most important and proceeding to the least, each after its kind, as cereals and vegetables.\" Although Garcilaso is probably wrong in details,37 we may still 34 35 36 37\n\nMURRA (1973) 1975:243-254; see also RADICATI DI PRIMEGLIO 1980:8586. \"las papas aparecen siempre despuds de las llamas; los ojotas preceden siempre a los porongos y estos al carbon o al pescado.\" In: MURRA (1973) 1975:245. Garcilaso (1609) 1966:330. In \"the Memoria\" of Jeronimo Guacrapåucar the gold and silver form a pair as well as the copper and lead. This probably means that the gold and silver\n\nbelonged to the same color category.\n\n36\n\naccept his statement about two basic variables in an imagined khipu: color and order. And if we add to it the third one, the number of knots, we have all three basic variables: 1) color; 2) order; and 3) number. In fact, by using different combinations of colors and twisting techniques, it is possible to establish several hundreds or even thousands of different categories, such as domesticated animals, cultivated plants, wild animals, etc.38 And finally, after the category is established, each subject is also easy to encode by referring to its numerical order within the established category. Hence, corn always seems to appear before quinoa; quinoa before potatoes and so on.39 For example, if the color combination of light brown and dark blue refers to cultivated plants, the sentence: \"two 'hanegas' of corn and 15 hanegas of potatoes\" can be marked as follows: light brown & dark blue\n\n)\n\n38 39\n\n2\n\n0\n\n15\n\ncorn\n\nquinoa\n\npotatoes\n\nOf the existing khipus Marcia ASCHER and Robert ASCHER (1978:1-1155) have differentiated 61 single colors in hundreds of different combinations. It is also interesting to note that once the Indians learned new things from Spaniards they only added them at the end (sometimes at the beginning) of the list of the category like this: \"121 ovejas de la tierra (alpacas ?) 16 corderos de la tierra (llamas ?) 110 puercos (bigs)\n\n37\n\nHowever, if one must later add other 15 hanegas of potatoes at the end of the khipu, it can be done by using only one light brown and dark blue pendant cord and one supplementary cord as follows:\n\n3\n\nIn this case the supplementary cord gives meaning: third subject in the light brown and dark blue category (= cultivated plants). But if we return to the given text, we can note that the \"Memoria\" is organized into series of categories so that every new serie begins after stereotyped historical information such as \"Cuando el marqués fue a Bombón (when the marqués went to Bombón),\" \"Cuando vino el marqués a Xauxa de Bombón (when the marqués arrived to Jauja from Bombön)\" and \"Cuando salió el marqués para el Cuzco (when the marqués went out to Cuzco)\" was presented.\n\n9 cabras (goats) 1915 gallinas (hens) 17967 huevos (eggs) See \"Memoria de don Alvarado cacique de los indios ...\" In: ESPINOZA SORIANO 1971:212.\n\n38\n\nHow was this kind of information marked on the khipu? I think chronicler Calancha gives us an answer when he said that:40 \"Every main town (cabecera) of the province had a number\"\n\nBecause towns like Bombón and Xauxa were provincial capitals they may well have been marked down by numbers in the colorcategory \"the provinces and provincial capitals.\" And even the word \"el marqués\" may have been marked as \"a chief\" in the \"new\" color-category of \"Spaniards or Viracochas.\" If so, a sentence like \"Cuando el marqués fue a Bombón [de Cajamarca] le dimos 826 indios y todos se perdieron en la jornada (When the marqués went to Bombón [from Cajamarca] we gave him 826 men and all of them were lost during the expedition)\" can be marked as follows: people (for example, red)\n\nSpaniards (for example, carmine & light red)\n\nprovincial capitals (for example, light blue & light green & white)\n\n826 men\n\n1=chief, au\n\n0 women\n\nb 12= 13= Bombon Cajamarca\n\ndeath (for example, green) 826\n\n40\n\nf\n\n\"Cada pueblo cabeza de Provincia tenia su cifra.\" In: Calancha 1639:91. 39\n\nBy using two pendant cords with five supplementary cords it is possible to give the following messages: 1) \"chief\" 2) Spaniards 3) Cajamarca 4) Bombón 1) 826 men 2) 826 men 3) death By combining these messages with oral narration, the khipu kamayoq could read the story quite easily: \"When 'the chief' of Spaniards (el marqués Francisco Pizarro) went from Cajamarca to Bombón we gave him 826 men. Those 826 men never came back.\" Furthermore, because the cords are arranged in the \"Memoria\" according to individual episodes, we can describe its structure by using a similar formula as CALNEK did with some Aztec texts: Messages Messages + (transition)+ EPISODE +(trans.) EPISODE 2 Narration etc. 1 Narration In general, it seems that the Incas used a similar marking method in other administrative records such as in corvee lists and census.41 For example, if we take a sample from the famous Chupaychu khipu (which was read and translated into Spanish in 1549) and compare it with the artifact categories presented in \"Memoria,\" we may easily notice the similarity: Chupaychu khipu\n\n.. They gave 40 Indians more to make soles and they took them to Cuzco and to the storehouses. 40 more carpenters to make plates and bowls and other things for the Inca and they took them to Cuzco. 40 more potters to make pots and they took them to Guanoco 41 42\n\n40\n\nProbably the main cord always told whether the khipu dealt with corvee, census, history and the like. \"... Mås daban cuarenta indios para hacer suelas y las llevaban al Cuzco y a los depösitos. Mås daban cuarenta carpinteros para hacer platos y escudillas y otras cosas para el ynga y lo llevaban al Cuzco. Mås daban cuarenta olleros para hacer ollas y las llevaban a Guanoco ...\" In: Mori & Malpartida (1549) 1967:306; see also MURRA 1982:243.\n\nKhipu in the \"Memoria\" .. We gave him 482 more pairs of alpargates [\"sandals\"] and from ojotas [we gave] 452 pairs of ojotas [\"other kinds of sandals\"]. We gave him 200 more ropes and 682 pifeas and 423 cucharas [\"spoons\"]. [We gave] 1769 more vessels from pots and pitchers ...\"43\n\nThe basic difference is that when the \"Memoria\" refers to artifacts, the Chupaychu khipu refers to people who make these artifacts. On the other hand, census lists may have been more complicated because such lists included many place names and personal names. Although it is possible that in some provinces khipu kamayoqs memorized almost all the names according to the order in which they were listed in the census, I still think that in Cuzco, at least, principal khipu kamayoqs must have had methods to mark down all the important names they needed to know. And what made their job easier was the fact that regions, towns and even curacas in non-Quechua areas were often given Quechua names. Actually the same happened also in Central Mexico where regions and towns in non-Nahuatl areas were given Nahuatl names, partly because the names were easier to record in hieroglyphic form.44 Already we know that each province and provincial capital had its proper number. But how could other place and personal names have been marked on the khipu? Let us take an early census example referring to the area of Limatambo in \"Chinchasuyo,\" but which was copied in 1535 in Cuzco.45 The list begins as follows: \"— Village called Chonda; of mitimaes [\"colonists\"]; cacique orejon [\"Inca chief'] Coco 250 Indians — Village called Gunman Coro, principal [\"secondary leader\"] Pisco 100 Indians\n\netc.\" 43 44 45\n\n\"... 124) Mås le dimos 482 pares de alpargates y de ojotas 452 pares de ojotas. 125) Mås le dimos 200 sogas y pifeas 682 y de cucharas 423. 126) Mås de ollas y cåntaros 1769 vasijas ...\" In: Guacrapåucar (1558) 1971:208. DIBBLE 1971:330. \"Pueblo que se dize Chonda, de mitimaes, cacique orejon Coco, 250 yndios. Pueblo que se dize Guaman Coro, principal Pisco, 100 yndios ...\" In: \"Titulo de la encomienda de Francisco Pizarro a Gomez de Mazuelas, 1— VIII-1535,\" fols. 76v-77r, Justicia 420, AGI. 41\n\nUsing an analogy to Aztec hieroglyphic writing I will assume that the names of these kinds of lists were marked down by a phonetic and non-phonetic system. For example, the village called Chonda, which means in Quechua \"palm tree\" can be marked down by a color and number combination which refers to that kind of tree in tribute and corvee lists. Another village, Guaman Coro, can be marked down by two cords where the first color and number combination refers to falcon (Guaman = falcon) and the other, for example, to gold (Cori = gold). Because the gold is not a typical village name, the khipu kamayoq who interpreted the text could have made a little correction (that cori means coro) and so he got the name Guaman Coro. Similarly, the name \"Coco\" is so phonetically close to the word coca that it might have been marked down by a color and number combination which means \"coca\" in storage and corvee lists, and so on. The name \"Pisco\" is the same as a well known valley on the coast and it might have had its proper number. If not, the name which means in Quechua \"bird\" (=Pisco), could have been marked down by a color and number combination which means simply \"bird\" in storage and corvee lists. If my hypothesis is correct the khipu would look like this: vil age\n\nvii age\n\ncacique\n\ndifferent colors\n\ncategory \"cultivated plants\" category \"birds\"\n\ncategory \"precious metals\"\n\n1\n\n1~ 250\n\n3= orejon (Inca) Chonda (palm tree) =mitimaes 42\n\nprincipal\n\n100\n\n4=\n\n2=\n\ncoca\n\nguaman (falcon)\n\n1= cori (gold)\n\npisco (bird)\n\nIt is also clear that in some cases specialized khipu kamayoqs seem to have marked various historical episodes under a single sub-class of the major category of which they were in charge. For example, in Chucuito some khipu kamayoqs of llama herders seem to have classified the camelid under the four main sub-classes: 1) carnero grande (male llama?) 2) oveja grande (female llama?) 3) carnero paco (male alpaca?) and 4) oveja paco (female alpaca?). However, still they had marked onto their khipus messages which refer, among other things, to the early history of the Conquest period as can be seen in the following sample dealing with the loss of \"carneros grandes\" in the town of Chucuito:46 \"Discharge they gave from they khipus: —When Centeno went to fight in Guarina he took them 98 llamas to carry back.\" —He took another 24 back-llamas in Desaguadero. —Gonzalo Pizarro took 281 male llamas to carry them to Cuzco. —They gave 40 male llamas to Francisco de Carvajal. —32 of their male llamas have died ...\" These examples have demonstrated that it was possible to mark down information about historical events even onto the ordinary Incaic storage and corvee records. But that is not all. We have evidence that the Incas had specific khipu \"annals\" about their own history.\n\n46 — — — — —\n\n47\n\n\" Descargo q[ue] dan por sus quipos gue les tomo Centeno quando fue a dar la batalla de Guarina noventa y ocho carneros para] cargas que les tomo otros veynty quatro carn[erlos pa[ra] cargas en el Desaguadero que les tomo G[onzal]o Pizarro para] llevar al Cuzco duzientos y ochenta y un carneros glue] dieron a Fran[cis]co de Caruajal quarenta carneros que se les han muerto treynta y doss ...\" In: \"Relaciön del ganado que parece aver entregado Juan Vasquez de Tapia y Diego Pacheco a estos caciq[ue]s de Chucuyto y sus pu[ebl]os por de su mag[es]t[ad] juntamente con el descargo que los d[ic]hos caciques dan por sus quipos,\" sin fols., Audiencia de Charcas 37, AGI. The whole transcription (and translation) contains 8 folios (16 pages) of text. The battle of Guarina (Huarina) was fought in 1547; see LOCHARD 1982:43. 43\n\n1.3. Khipu records and historical texts The Inca history was probably transmitted mainly by oral tradition but as I mentioned earlier many chroniclers confirm that the Incas also used specific khipus to record historical events. For example, Cieza de Leon wrote that each Inca chose three or four skilled and gifted old men to recall all that happened in the provinces during the time of their reign, and to make and arrange songs so that thereby it might be known in the future what had taken place in the past. But then he adds that all this was put down on the khipus, too.48 One of the best examples of this kind of \"written history\" was published some years ago by John H. ROWE in his article: \"Probanza de los Incas nietos de conquistadores.\" It includes a text called \"Memoria de las prouincias,\" which deals with the provinces conquered by the so-called tenth Inca, Topa Inca Yupanqui. As ROWE writes, the text of \"Memoria\" is a summary whose structure suggests the use of a khipu.49 ROWE also noted that \"Memoria de las provincias\" is very similar to the texts presented in Cabello's, Munia's and Sarmiento's chronicles.50 This must mean that also they have had access to the transcriptions of the same or related khipus. However, here I will analyze only a part of the text presented in \"Memoria\" and compare it to Sarmiento's chronicle. After that I will present my hypothesis of how the text was marked down on a khipu. Let us first take a sample from \"Memoria de las provincias\" and from the text of Sarmiento: Memoria de las provincias —in the province of Angaraes, situated in Guamanga, cabecera of the whole province, [he conquered] Vrcussla Curoslla Ymrarcas and by razing he seized its king Chuquis Guaman. —[In] Yauyus he razed Taya and Siquilla Pucara, and passed forward ...\n\n48 49 50\n\n44\n\nCieza 1553b:cap. xii; 1986:30-31. ROWE 1985b:198-199. See ROWE's analysis in ROWE 1985b:207-216.\n\n— ... and then [he conquered] the province of Palpa Chimo and the others came to him peacefully.51 Sarmiento52 ... [he conquered] in the Angaraes the fortress of Urcocolla and Guaillapucara, and seized its lord called Chuquis Guaman; in the province of Xauxa [he conquered] Siciquilla Pucara, and in the province of ... ... and [he conquered] the province of the Paltas and the Valleys of Pacasmayo and Chimo, which is now Truxillo ... ROWE has noted that these texts are based mainly on categories like \"provinces, fortresses, and kings.\"53 Furthermore, ROWE thinks that the sentence \"situated in Guamanga, cabecera of the whole province (que es en guamanga caueza de toda la provincia)\" was not in the original khipu, but was added as an explication for Spaniards.54 While we may accept that the sentence \"and passed forward (y paso adelante)\" is a \"transitional narration\" which is not based directly on the khipu, I think that just the name (number) of the provincial capital may have been marked on the original khipu. As we have quoted earlier from Calancha: \"Every main town (cabecera) of the province had a number.\" Thus the sentence \"situated in Guamanga, cabecera of the whole province\" can be explained — vice versa — as a comment of how they knew which main province and further, which sub-province, was in question. In general, many of the differences in place names between \"Memoria\" and Sarmiento can be explained as errors of \"escribanos\" and \"copistas\" but I would like to give attention to two errors which may have been made by a khipu kamayoq. First,\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53 54\n\n\"— en la prouincia de los angaraes que es en guamanga caueza de toda la prouincia [conquisto] a vrcussla curoslla ymrarcas y asolandola prendio a chuquis guaman su rrey. — yauyus asolo a taya y a siquilla pucara y paso adelante ... — ... y luego la prouincia de palpa chimo y los demas le salieron de paz.\" In: Capac Ayllu (1569) 1985:207-209, 224. \"... [conquisto] en los angaraes, la fortaleza de Urcocolla y Guaillapucara, y prendiö a su cinche nombrado Chuquis Guaman; en la provincia de Xauxa a Siciquilla Pucara, y en las provincia ... y la provincia de los Paltas y los valles de Pacasmayo y Chimo, que es agora Truxillo ...\" In: Sarmiento 1572:cap. 44; 1943:210. ROWE 1985b:197. ROWE 1985b:198.\n\n45\n\nwhen Sarmiento spoke about the province of \"Xauxa,\" in \"Memoria\" one spoke about the province of \"Yauyus.\" Although the phonetic difference between the two names of these well known provinces is not extremely clear, it is not self evident that Spanish transcriptions are wrong. As a matter of fact, it is also possible that the khipu kamayoq had \"read\" the number of the province (= provincial capital) incorrectly; since, at least spatially, Xauxa is adjunct to Yauyo. Secondly, when one said in \"Memoria\" that Topa Inka conquered \"the province of Palpa Chimo,\" Sarmiento wrote that Topa Inka conquered \"the province of the Paltas and the Valleys of Pacasmayo and Chimo.\" The error in \"Memoria\" can be interpreted by the following hypothesis: Palta is a Quechua name for a cultivated fruit (avocado), but Pacasmayo and Chimo are not pure Quechua names; they are names of a coastal language (Muchic). That is why the name of Pacasmayo may have been difficult to interpret in a khipu text. And what the khipu kamayoq had done was that he seemingly took the first phonetical sound from the name Palta (which was expressed by a color and number combination) and combined it with the phonetic sound \"pa\" which he got from the second suplementary cord. When it actually was a question of two place names (Pal-ta and Pa-cas-mayo), he got only one name, Palpa. In fact, it is not important whether the khipu kamayoq had made an error or not. More important is that this kind of error is theoretically possible. In every case, the sentence: \"[he conquered] the province of the Paltas and [the Valleys of] Pacasmayo and Chimo\" could have been marked originally on the khipu by the phonetic system as follows:\n\n46\n\nPlace names\n\ncategory \"cultivated plants\"\n\ncategory \"wooden artifacts\"\n\n= Pa-pa (potato)\n\ncategory \"provincial capitals\"\n\n22 = Palta (avocado)\n\n21 = Chan Chan (?) = Chimo category \"descriptive 13 = Cas-pi (rod) names of the earth\" ~•\n\n34 = Mayo (river) = Pa-cas-mayo\n\nOur hypothesis probably contains some errors, especially in its details. However, transcriptions and copies of khipu-texts, conserved in various archives, demonstrate that \"writing\" really was possible by using knotted cords. In this study, we have tried to show that it was even possible to encode person and place names on khipus by a phonetic and non-phonetic system. Furthermore, we have tried to demonstrate that the system might have worked in historical texts basically by the same principle with which it worked on census, corvee and storage records, and, in fact, only very stereotyped and simple messages were used. If it had been necessary to add more detailed information, for example, to an historical text, the Inca historians had 47\n\nthe possibility of combining painted scenes, \"khipu-writing\" and oral text. The situation was basically the same among both the Aztec and among the Incas, but instead of glyphic writing the Incas used khipus. In general, without oral components the system was not very effective if one needed to \"write\" poems and prose. Nevertheless, the khipus suited extremely well to be used in recording census, corvee and storage lists as well as in writing considerable simple and stereotyped historical \"annals.\" It is also evident that the famous system of post-runners of the Inca empire would not have been so efficient without concrete \"written messages.\" When hundreds post-runners transmitted messages between Chile and Cuzco or between Quito (Ecuador) and Cuzco the (oral) information could have easily been distorted if khipus would not have been used. Finally, I have not been able to specify the exact connection of the so-called Inca counting board of pebble stones to the khipu texts. Such a \"counting board,\" associated with the figure of a man holding a khipu, is presented by Guaman Poma in one of his drawings;55 and in fact, various interpretations of its mathematical use have been presented.56 However, we have evidence that those boards were used together with khipus in the reading of the khipu text.57 Hence, we may wonder that if the khipus already contained numerical information, what was needed to calculate when the messages were read? Could it be that more than pure calculating\n\n55 Guaman Poma (1615) 1987:360 [362]. See also fig. 2. 56 WASSEN 1931:189-205; LOCKE 1932:37-43; DAY 1967:31-38; see also ASCHER 1986:264-266. 57 In 1578 the Spanish judges needed to know how much taxes the Indians of Sacaca had paid during the years 1548-1551 to Alonso de Montemayor in La Plata. For that purpose they asked two old khipu_kamayogs to give the account of paid taxes from their khipus. However, our document demonstrates that those two old men also used pebble stones when they read the khipus to Spanish officials: \"E luego les fue pedido que muetren por los dhos quipos lo que dieron al dho don Al[ons]o y a otras personas en su nombre el primer alto de los quatro que dizen que no tuvieron tasa e tomando sus quipos en las manos dixeron auer le dado lo siguente y puestos unas piedras en el suelo por las quales fueron haziendo quenta. Juntamente con los quipos dixeron lo siguente: 1. arm — 21 200 p[es]os de plata corriente ...\" See \"Pleito de los indios del repartimiento de Sacaca con los herederos de don Alonso de Montemayor, sobre lo que el dicho don Alonso cobr6 demasiado de los dhos yndios, La Plata 1579,\" fol. 262r, Pieza 1, No. 2, Justicia 653, AGI. 48\n\n36o ~.. ~ . . ~O~O~TOR•r1 0R . r i■ r ~ .

A man holding a khipu (A drawing of Guaman Patna). 49\n\nboards, those pebble stones were used to clarify various names, objects, things, words or even phonemes under each khipu category? As José de Acosta says:58 \"In spite of these quipo [khipu] strings, they have others, the pebble stones, from where they exactly learn the words they like to remember ...\" Unfortunately, we cannot answer to that question yet.\n\n2. Chronicles and Other Written Sources 2.1. The Incas and the chroniclers: some basic\n\nproblems We know that it was the so-called ninth Inca, Pachacuti, who started systematically collect information of his predecessors.59 As said, it was marked on wooden panels — which were kept in a certain building — and also the khipu-strings were used. Furthermore, the interpretation of history, kept in pictures and khipus, was a task of the persons especially chosen for the job.6° Inca history, collected in this way, was taught, in a certain amount, to the sons of the lords in the court of Cuzco, especially during the days of great celebrations.61 However, the main principle was that the royal panacas conserved the information from their branch of the family at the same time as when they took\n\n58\n\n59 60 61\n\n50\n\n\"Fuera de estos quipos de hilo, tienen otros de pedrezuelas, por donde puntualmente aprenden las palabras que quieren tornar de memoria ...\" In: Acosta 1588-1590:lib. vi, cap. viii; 1987:402; see also Cordoua Mesia et al.

According to Valera (in Garcilaso [1609): lib. iv, cap. xix, 1976 I:203-204; see also Vasquez de\n\ncare of the mummies of the dead Incas.62 From the historian's point of view all of these things raise many problems. First, it is clear that Pachacuti and his successors had great influence over what information was kept in pictures, khipus and songs, and what was transmited to the general oral tradition. Second, conceptions of each Inca seem to have been different in each emperor's own panaca than in others'. It also seems that many chroniclers didn't fully realize this disparity when they were collecting subject matter for their chronicles. In fact, this may explain many contradictions generally noticed in the texts of classic chroniclers. Third, khipu kamayoqs interviewed by Vaca de Castro told that Challcochima and Quisquis, captains of Atahualpa \"killed every khipu kamayoq they could catch and they burned their khipus ... (mataron todos los quipocamayos que pudieron haber a los manos y les quemaron los quipos ...)\"63 This, if it is true, must have made the situation very confusing even before the Spaniards destroyed the rest of the khipus. And finally, especially from the time before Pachacuti, we can find only pieces of history told by the Incas themselves (with the modifications of every royal lineage). We cannot verify this \"official history\" from the oral tradition of other people outside Cuzco. But after Pachacuti had begun the military expansion of the Incas, the situation changed considerably. It is no wonder that nowadays the value of \"relaciones geogråficas,\" \"visitas\" and other documents written outside the Inca capital has been proven many times.\n\n62 63\n\nEspinosa 1629: lib. iv, cap. lxxxv, xciv, xcvi; 1969:372, 381, 384, who had used Garcilaso) and Monia ([ca. 1609] 1946:169) the Incas even had a school in the city of Cuzco where they could learn the history of the Incas, among other things, but as John H. ROWE has pointed out, this claim is not very convincing (ROWE 1982:95). Betanzos 1551:cap. xvii, 1987:86; Sarmiento 1572:cap. 9, 1943:114-115; see also Cieza 1553b:cap. xi, 1986:27-29. Quipocamayos (1542-1544) 1920:4.\n\n51\n\n2.2.\n\n\"Non-source-based knowledge\" and the practice of copying earlier sources\n\nHistorians have long known that their own cultural background always has some effect on their reasoning. Jerzy TOPOLSKI has shown this situation schematically while demonstrating how \"non-source-based knowledge\" has an effect during historical research work:64 t\n\nNon-source-based knowledge\n\nY\n\nNon-source-based Non-source-based knowledge knowledge\n\nNon-source-based knowledge\n\nChoice of field --► Posing questions -► Establishing* Causal explanations of research historical facts\n\nAnswers to questions (new data)\n\nSource-based knowledge\n\nAlthough one can find the same problem in the works of chroniclers, we do not yet have enough specific research on this subject. Of course, Andeanists have often mentioned each chronicler's general attitude towards Incas, whether they are near the \"Garcilasoan\" or the \"Toledoan\" schools, etc, but we need more detailed analyses. A good example of how we can better understand chronicles is Rolena ADORNO's article \"Las otras fuentes de Guaman Poma: sus lecturas castellanas,\" published more than ten years ago in \"Histórica\" as well as her book \"Guaman Poma.\"6' She was able to demonstrate how some writings of Spanish clerics had influenced Guaman Poma's way of thinking and how these writings have formed a real model for some of his chapters. We really need more of this kind of research. Another very typical problem in the chronicles of the 16th and\n\n64 65\n\n52\n\nTOPOLSKI 1976:418. ADORNO 1978:137-158; 1986.\n\n17th centuries lies in the practice — quite general in that epoch — of copying earlier sources and presenting the information as the writer's own. Long ago historians knew that Roman y Zamora had copied almost everything from Las Casas' \"Apologetica historia sumaria ...;\"66 Las Casas used at least Bartolome de Segovia's text, and possibly Cieza de Léon's \"La crönica del Peru,\" Xerez's \"Verdadero rlación\" and also Estete's \"Relación\" from the year 1533.67 Further, Acosta heavily used Polo de Ondegardo and to some extend Cristobal de Molina.68 Cobo used at least Polo de Ondegardo, Cristobal de Molina, Pedro Pizarro, \"Informaciones del Toledo,\" Acosta, Garcilaso de la Vega, Luis Jeronimo de Oré, Garcia de Melo, Francisco Falcon and Ramos Gavilån.69 Santillån, in turn, copied the first version of \"Senores\" (for which Castro & Ortega Morejón's \"Relación de Chincha\" served as a structural model), Damian de la Bandera and Polo de Ondegardo;70 etc. Although scholars have found this kind of dependency among several chronicles, still more remains to be found.\n\n2.3. The case of Martin de Morua Father Martin de Morla was from Northern Spain; the year when he was born is unknown. He may have come to Peru between 1550 and 1580.\" According to Guamån Poma de Ayala, Morla was \"comendador of the village of Yanaca in the province of Aymaraes\" and \"cura [priest] doctrinante of the village of Pocohuanca. \"72 66 ROWE 1946:195; ARANIBAR 1963:130-134. 67 ARANIBAR 1963:131-132; WEDIN 1966:86.

ROWE specifies that Chapter 16 of the second book (libro II) was written between 1592 and 1598 and the whole fourth book (libro IV) between 1600 and 1609.\" We have by the same author (Murtia) another chronicle \"Historia General del Piru\" (Ms. Wellington, ed. by M. BALLESTEROS-GAIBROIS) based on his first, and probably also on the unpublished notes used by Sarmiento de Gamboa in his \"Segunda parte de la Historia General llamada Indica,\" Guamån Poma's \"Nueva Corónica\" and possibly on some other chronicles.75 In this specific case study I will deal only with the first work. Although Morita claims in his first chronicle that his principal sources of information had been the Inca khipus, one need not take that claim too seriously. Carlos ARANIBAR and Pierre DUVIOLS had noticed at the beginning of the 1960s that Monia had copied at least \"Confesionario ...\" (published in Lima 1585) which contained among other things Polo de Ondegardo's \"Los errores y supersticiones de los indios\" from the year 1559, and \"Instrucción contra las ceremonias y ritos ...\" from the year 1567.76 Even in the same Chapter where he dealt with these khipus he had actually used the written sources of others: in this case Jeronimo Roman y Zamora's \"Repitblicas de Indias\" (which is almost completely based on Las Casas' \"Apologetica\"), as one can see from the following paragraph: 73 74 75\n\nPORRAS BARRENECHEA 1962:379. ROWE 1987:574.\n\nParallelism with Guaman Poma and Murtia has been analyzed by MEDIZABAL LOSACK (1963:161-164) and OSSIO (1982:567-569). Parallelism with Murtia and Sarmiento: compare Murtia 1616 lib.I, cap.25; 1987:92-93 — Sarmiento 1572:cap. 46, 1943:216; Murtia 1616:lib. I, cap. 26; 1987:98 — Sarmiento cap. 51, 1943:229, etc.; see also PEASE 1978:89 note 32. According to ROWE, Murtia had not used Sarmiento or Cabello, but probably Cristobal de Molina's missing work (ROWE 1985b:194, 200). I\n\nagree that Murtia had not used Cabello but other sources like Molina. However, Muria's work is every now and then so similar to Sarmiento's that he seems to have used (together with Cabello) Sarmiento's papers and notes dealing with the information collected from the royal panacas. If not, the text Muria used must have been quite a similar to Sarmiento's account, anyway. 76\n\n54\n\nARANIBAR 1963:106; DUVIOLS 1962:33-43.\n\nRoman y Zamora 77\n\nMorua78\n\nEsta era un género de nudos hechos en unos cordones algo gruesos, å manera de pater nosters, ó de rosario, ó nudos de cordon de San Francisco; por estos contaban los apos, los meses y dias, por estos hacian unidades, decenas, centenas y millares, y para que las cosas que querian contar diferenciasen, hacia los nudos mayores y menores y con diferencias de colores, de manera que para una cosa tenian nudo colorado y para otra verde ó amarillo, y ansf iba lo demås; ...\n\ngista era un género de nudos hechos, como dicho es, en unos cordones algo gruesos, a manera de pater noster, ó de rosario, o nudos de cordon de nuestro P.

Of these, Chapter XII, which deals with the reign of Topa Inca, is almost completely copied from Fernandez' Chapter V of his third book: Fernåndez81\n\nMorlia82 Este Senor y Rey\n\nTopa Inga Yupanque fué gran senor y muy valiente.

Parallelism with Guamån Poma and Morua (Muria) is even more evident in Morua's later chronicle (Ms. Wellington; see MENDIZABAL LOSACK 1963:161-164 and OSSIO 1982:567-569).

Morna (ca. 1609) 1946:79. 57\n\nsources when they have investigated the social organization of Cuzco. Furthermore, it is quite clear that Monia also used many other chronicles, many of which have been lost since he wrote. For example, he may have used Blas Valera's and Cristobal de Molina's missing works. But to answer the question of what other sources he might have used is the task of future research.\n\n2.4. The case of Pedro Gutierrez de Santa Clara We do not know much about the chronicler Pedro Gutiérrez de Santa Clara. He was probably born in Mexico or in Cuba as \"mestizo o criollo\" after the year 1521, and we know that he was still alive in the year 1603. Gutiérrez wrote his chronicle \"Quinquenarios o Historia de las guerras civiles del Peru (15441548) y de otros sucesos de las Indias\" in Mexico after the year 1590.85 The events of Gutiérrez' life and the value of his work have been in dispute for a long time. Yet in the year 1946 PORRAS BARRENECHEA wrote that perhaps Gutiérrez' chronicle is \"an autobiography because he must have seen many of those sceneries he is narrating\" and that \"as chronicler, Gutiérrez de Santa Clara should be placed on the same side with Cieza and Garcilaso.\" Furthermore, PORRAS BARRENECHEA summarized Gutiérrez' account of the Incas as follows: \"In summary, in his chronicle there are very interesting insights and novelties about many aspects of Inca history.\"86 In the 1950s, however, Marcel BATAILLON began to seriously doubt if Gutiérrez had ever been to Peru, since he had copied so heavily from the published chronicles of others. When Gutiérrez dealt with the civil war of Peru he used at least Diego Fernandez,\n\n85 KNOX 1958:95; BATAILLON 1961:412, 421-422; PEREZ DE TUDELA BUESO 1963:c. 86 PORRAS BARRENECHEA 1946:1, 15.\n\n58\n\nLopez de Gómara, Zårate, Cieza de Léon and Fernandez de Oviedo.87 However, in 1963 Carlos ARANIBAR and Juan PEREZ DE TUDELA BUESO still believed that Gutiérrez had been to Peru and had described matters he had seen and heard.88 As Carlos ARANIBAR has put it: \"Recent studies of Marcel Bataillon present a doubt whether Gutierrez de Santa Clara, \"l'historien-romancier,\" would ever have gone to Peru. It is true that up today there is no document which would testify to the presence of this chronicler in these lands, and that professor Bataillon has detected some literal transpositions where Santa Clara may have utilized another's sources or where he may even have transferred his Mexican experience into some events of Peruvian civil wars. However, there is no information about the Inca history which would obligate Professor Bataillon to convert Santa Clara into a skillful copier and a great liar, for there is no serious evidence. On the other hand, the erudite investigator Rafael Loredo admitted some years ago that there is a possibility that our chronicler may have been in Collao in 1546.\"89\n\nI have not seen any clear proof which would testify to Gutiérrez' presence in Collao. On the contrary, in 1961 Marcel BATAILLON proved that Gutiérrez had used other chronicles in his version of Inca history. He wrote in Nueva Revista de Filologia Hispånica: Pedro Gutierrez' other (sure) sources, concerning printed books and the matters dealing with Peruvian pre-Spanish history, are the\n\n87 88 89\n\nBATAILLON 1952:1-21; Extrait de l'Annuaire du College de' France 1959, 1960, 1961, cit. by BATAILLON 1961:406 note 4. ARANIBAR 1963:118-119 note 5; PEREZ DE TUDELA BUESO 1963:bocxix. \"Investigaciones recientes de Marcel Bataillon plantean la duda sobre si Gutiérrez de Santa Clara, \"l'historien-romancier,\" llego alguna vez al Peru. Es verdad que hasta ahora no hay un solo documento que atestique la presencia del cronista en estas tierras y que el profesor Bataillon ha destacado algunas transposiciones literias por las cuales Santa Clara habria aprovechado ajenas fuentes y win habria traslado su experiencia mexicana a algunos sucesos de las guerras civiles del Peril. Pero no se ha hecho cargo de las noticias sobre historia incaica, las cuales le obligarian al profesor Bataillon a convertir a Santa Clara en un diestro copista y falsario de gran tono, para lo cual win no hay prueba seria. Por otro lado, ya el erudito investigador Rafael Loredo ha admitido, desde hace algunos apos, la posibildad de que nuestro cronista haya estado en el Collao por 1546.\" In: ARANIBAR 1963:118-119 note 5.\n\n59\n\nappendix of the second part of the chronicle of \"el Palentino\" and the \"Historia natural y moral de las Indias\" of Father Acosta. He also used, to give \"originality\" to his version about the discovery of America, a bestseller of Gonzalo de Illescas the \"Historia pontifical y catölica (2a parte)\" prohibited by the Inquisition.\"90 However, BATAILLON's writings did not get much attention from Andeanists outside France. It is characteristic that in 1982 John H. ROWE published an article where he writes in references that Gutierrez' information from the Incas had been written during 1546-1548.91 My aim is not to discuss the question of Gutiérrez' possible trip to Peru.92 However, I would like to show that the part of his book which deals with the Incas is actually based heavily on the chronicle of Diego Fernandez el Palentino. But that is not all: I will show that he also used the chronicles of Lopez de Gómara and Roman y Zamora. For example, Chapters LXIV and LXV from the third book of the Quinquenarios are based on Diego Fernandez' text from the year 1571: Fernandez\n\nGutiérrez\n\nVestianse todos unas camisetas casi blancas, y tenian por delante una serial como cruz. Y éstas, no las vestian en otro\n\ntraian todos los electos vestidas unas camisas largas y muy blancas, de algodon, y en los pechos tenfan una manera de cruz +, y éstas no se las vestian en otro\n\n90\n\n91 92\n\n60\n\n\"Otras fuentes seguras de Pedro Gutiérrez en punto a libros impresos, son, para lo tocante al Peril prehispánico, el apéndice de la Segunda parte del Palentino y la Historia natural y moral de las Indias del padre Acosta. También utilize, para dar \"originalidad\" a su version del descubrimiento de América, un \"bestseller\" prohibido por la Inquisici6n, la 'Historia pontifical y catOlica' de Gonzalo de Illescas (2a parte).\" In: BATAILLON 1961:410. ROWE 1982:116. According to John H. ROWE, Gutiérrez may really have visited Peru during the civil war (personal communication).\n\ntiempo; sino para este efecto.

A los quince dias — 94\n\nThe history of the Inca rulers as Gutiérrez had put it down differs noticeably from the Diego Fernandez text. While el Palentino presents the traditional history, Gutiérrez claims that the Incas ruled first in the province of Collao in the Titicaca area and it was either Pachacuti or Topa Inca who conquered Cuzco. Some anthropologists and historians have used Gutiérrez' claim in their own theories,95 but it is evident that Gutiérrez copied his idea from Spanish chronicles — not from Peruvian Indians. It is a well known fact that many early Spanish sources claimed that Inca Viracocha was the first Inca ruler and that he was from the Titicaca area.96 Although Cieza de Léon, Betanzos and many others firmly argued against this view in the 1550s, it did not prevent Gutiérrez from making this claim again with new modifications based on his imagination. In fact, one can see in his text that he used in his narration of the Incas at least one of those early Spanish sources: Lopez de Gömara (who in turn had used other sources, since he had never been to America):\n\n93 94 95 96\n\nFernandez 1571: lib. iii, cap. vi; 1963 II:83. Gutierrez (ca. 1600) lib. iii, cap. lxiv; 1963 III:253. See, for example, ZUIDEMA 1962:123-126; IBARRA GRASSO 1978: 553, 572. Andagoya (1546) 1986:122; L6pez de Gemara (1552) 1852:232; Zårate (1555) 1853:471; Segovia (1552) 1943:32. This error may based on that these chroniclers have confused the legend from the god Viracocha and the myth from Manco Capac and then mixed those with Inca Viracocha. 61\n\nLopez de G()mara\n\nGutiérrez\n\n... y hablan con él lenguaje que los seglares no entienden.
