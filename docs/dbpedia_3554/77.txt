More: Kurz and Allison

Kurz and Allison was a prominent American lithographic firm that operated from 1885 to 1893. The firm specialised in producing large prints of historical events, particularly Civil War battles. The company was founded by Louis Kurz and Alexander Allison, both of whom had extensive experience in the printing industry. Their prints were very popular in the late 19th century, and many are now considered valuable collectors' items. The company went out of business in 1893 due to financial difficulties, but its legacy lives on through the many prints it produced.
