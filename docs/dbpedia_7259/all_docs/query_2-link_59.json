        "text": "What is the difference between a hobby and a business?\n\nIn the IRSâs eyes, a hobby is something you do for your own enjoyment, while a business is something you do to make a profit.\n\nThatâs the one simple factor it considers when deciding how to classify your money-making activity.\n\nThe most important question here: Are you making an effort to generate a profit? If so, then youâve got a business.\n\n{write_off_block}\n\nDo you always have to be profitable to be considered a business?\n\nNo, you donât have to make a profit every single year youâre in business. You do have to put in time and effort to push your business into profitability.\n\nWhat happens if your business is considered a hobby?\n\nLetâs say the IRS decides the business you thought you were running is actually a hobby.\n\nHere are three things that will end up happening on your tax return:\n\nYou canât claim any write-offs\n\nSorry, chief. The current US tax system doesnât allow you to write off anything you spend on pursuing your hobby.\n\nCompare that to a legitimate business. Whether youâre freelancing for 50 hours a week or driving for DoorDash on weekends only, pursuing a for-profit activity means you get to write off everything you spend on keeping that activity running.\n\nHave a business, but not sure what you can write off? Try the Keeper app, which automatically scans your transactions to find tax deductions for you.\n\n{upsell_block}\n\nYour hobby income is still taxable\n\nAs long as youâre earning more than $400 from your hobby, youâll still have to report that income when you file taxes. ($400 is also the tax filing threshold for self-employed income from a business.)Â\n\nOn your 1040 return, your hobby earnings go under âOther Income.â\n\nBeing taxed on your hobby income without getting to write off your hobby expenses â that sounds like the worst of both worlds. But there is a silver lining to having a hobby, as far as your taxes go.\n\nYou donât have to pay self-employment tax\n\nIf you were running a business, your net profit would be taxed an additional 15.3%. But you donât pay that dreaded self-employment tax on your hobby income.Â\n\nThis means a hobby with no write-offs might even be taxed less than a business with the write-offs.Â\n\nHow does the IRS decide if you have a hobby or a business?\n\nThe IRS lays out nine factors used to determine if an activity is a hobby. Theyâre all very relative, and they apply differently to different businesses.\n\nTo be considered a business, you donât need to pass all â or even a majority â of these tests. But the ones you do pass will need to drive home to the IRS that you mean business.\n\nThese factors are indicated in the tax code in IRC 183, and broken down in easier-to-read language in Chapter 1 of IRS Publication 535, which talks about business expenses.\n\nTo really bring them to life, letâs look at each of them through the lens of one of the most important professions in the USA: a party clown.\n\nWeâll be comparing two clowns who take very different approaches to their clowning. Jumbles is a hobbyist, while Squeaks treats it like work.\n\nFactor #1: How you handle the activity\n\nThe more effort you put into running things legitimately, the more likely it is to be seen as a business.\n\nJumbles strolls up to the party whenever they feel like it, paints some faces, and then hounds the parents for their $30 â before grabbing a bag of chips and wandering away\n\nSqueaks emails out an invoice ahead of time with their hours and services\n\nFactor #2: Your expertise in the field\n\nIt pays to know what youâre doing. This isnât always about having years of experience in the field.\n\nOther ways of proving your experience include consulting with other experts and learning the skills it takes to grow your business.\n\nJumbles the Clown found a rainbow wig at a thrift store and called it a day\n\nSqueaks the Clown studied juggling for a few weeks, asked other clowns about their rates, and even took a course on comedy down at the community center\n\nFactor #3: The time and effort you spend on your activity\n\nYou donât need to be pursuing your business full-time for it to be enough time. But you do need to make a reasonable effort to make that profit.\n\nJumbles only has one booking two months from now â their cousinâs kidâs birthday â and theyâre okay with that\n\nWhen Squeaks isnât at a party, theyâre reviewing their Yelp page, sending out thank-you emails, and creating TikTok videos to promote themselves\n\nFactor #4: Your success at other activities\n\nYour past success doesnât need to be perfectly relevant to your current activity. But having past experience in turning a profit somewhere gives you a leg up. (Thereâs an understanding that businesses donât always start out profitable, so your track record is helpful here.)\n\nJumbles has never been a success in anything, and only took up clowning because they were inspired by an episode of The Simpsons.\n\nSqueaks actually has a degree in music. They were in a successful band for years but quit to pursue their true passion in clowning, which they approach with the same grit and determinationÂ\n\n{email_capture}\n\nFactor #5: Your history of income (or losses)\n\nLosses happen to all types of businesses. That doesnât turn them into hobbies overnight.Â\n\nThe IRS will typically look for three years of consecutive business losses before it starts asking if your activity is a business. Having a good track record in prior years helps create the narrative that it isnât a hobby.Â\n\nJumbles consistently outspends their earnings by about a thousand bucks. One year, they accidentally turned a profit after they appeared in the background of a viral duck videoâ¦ but that was after eight years of losses in a row.\n\nSqueaks actually turns a profit most years. But in any year a killer clown movie comes out, all of a sudden there was a lull in their business.\n\nFactor #6: Your relative amount of profits and losses\n\nThere are two parts to this factor:\n\nLooking at the entire narrative of your businessâs run\n\nConsidering how you invest in your business\n\nIf you have a really good year, you might have the money to make bigger purchases to grow your business. This might put you at the risk of a small loss for a year or two.\n\nThe IRS is fine with that. Investing in your business â or having sporadic income because of the industry youâre in â does not make it a hobby.Â\n\nJumbles is usually at a loss of $5,000 â they buy very expensive clown shoes. But theyâll occasionally turn a profit of around $17 for the year, seemingly by accident\n\nSqueaks normally turns a profit of around $30,000 every year. But in the lull years, the losses were around $1,000\n\nFactor #7: Your financial status\n\nEssentially, the IRS looks at:\n\nYour disposable income\n\nHow badly you need the money from this activity\n\nThe reasoning here: With no need to make a profit, itâs easier to not really want to make a profit.Â\n\nJumbles is married to the CEO of a Fortune 500 company and can just pour countless funds into this clown pit\n\nSqueaks the Clown relies on their bookings to pay rent â itâs their primary source of income. If they donât âhonk honkâ at least once a week, they donât eat\n\nFactor #8: The amount of pleasure the activity brings you\n\nJobs with more inherent âfunâ attached to them are at greater risk of being labeled hobbies.\n\nIn the eyes of the IRS, an activity like that could easily be something you do that happens to make money, rather than something you do with the intention of making money.\n\nJumbles is filthy rich and wants nothing more than to be the local âclown about townâ. Theyâd be a clown even if it never made them a dime (which it typically doesnât)\n\nSqueaks hates being a clown most days, and really regrets quitting the band. But theyâve invested so much, they have to see it through. After a good cry, Squeaks puts their nose back on and rejoins the party like the professional that they areÂ\n\nObviously, this is a bit of a joke because of the profession I chose. But the general principle holds true.\n\nFactor #9: The expectation that your business assets appreciate in value\n\nIâll be honest: this one is a bit difficult to illustrate with a clown â or with most freelance jobs. Most freelancers just donât have big, appreciable assets like factory equipment.\n\nThe basic idea here: While youâre not necessarily making a profit every year, youâre working in the background to accumulate a potential profit when you eventually sell your assets down the line.\n\nJumbles is doingâ¦ nothing in particular\n\nSqueaks records their shows to build an online portfolio of clown content.Â The videos can be streamed for a small fee without them having to do anything. And they can sell their platform someday to an entertainment company thatâs really into clowns\n\nGiven all these differences between their clowning activities, Squeaks is more likely than Jumbles to be considered a legitimate businessclown.Â\n\nHow to avoid getting your business classified as a hobby\n\nYou know your business better than anyone. Should the IRS come knocking, you want to be prepared.\n\nMake sure you do the following to keep your business on the up-and-up:\n\nHave a written business plan\n\nThis should detail what you plan to do over the next three years to grow your business and get â or stay â profitable.\n\nKeep clear records of your business activities\n\nThis includes things like:\n\nTax records, which you can generate using Keeper\n\nRecords of research you conducted for your business\n\nRecords of certificates and licenses you earned to keep your business strong\n\nMake changes when necessary\n\nThe IRS knows not everyone is successful right off the bat.\n\nThatâs why its standard for âtrying to make a profitâ doesnât just mean bringing in income. Itâs also about recognizing why things arenât working â and changing up your business to make it profitable.\n\nGet help when you need\n\nNot everyone knows everything about the business side of things.\n\nKeeper offers free tools and resources for freelancers who might not know how to keep up with their expenses or file their taxes.Â\n\n{filing_upsell_block}\n\nWhat to do if the IRS decides your business is a hobbyÂ\n\nFirst of all, this isnât super common â the IRS doesnât go around targeting side hustlers by declaring that their businesses are actually hobbies. If this does happen to someone, itâll likely be after an audit triggered for some other reason.\n\nIf the IRS rules that your business is a hobby, you arenât going to be blindsided by this decision. You'll first:\n\nBe contacted via mail\n\nGo through some level of audit (either in person or by sending in your documentation)\n\nHereâs what to do if you hear from them:\n\nAppeal the IRSâs decision\n\nIf you donât agree with the IRSâs decision, you can file an appeal to have it reviewed by the IRS appeals division.\n\nWhy is it worth appealing?\n\nIf your business is considered a hobby one year, the IRS can:\n\nGo to any other return you filed in the last three years with that same business\n\nTreat it as a hobby there as well\n\nNote: Appeals can be a long and daunting process. If you end up in that situation, it may be best to consult a tax professional.\n\nFile Form 5213\n\nYou can file Form 5213, âElection to Postpone Determination as To Whether the Presumption Applies That an Activity is Engaged in for Profitâ â quite a mouthful. This form delays the IRSâs final decision until after your fifth year in business.\n\nWhen can you file the form?\n\nYou can file if, within the first few years, you can already see youâre going to struggle to be profitable until year six or seven.\n\nShould you file this form just in case?\n\nNo, thereâs no need to file when youâre first starting out, âjust in case.âÂ\n\nWhy? The form will ask for a pretty detailed explanation for why youâre filling it out. If you donât have enough evidence behind your claim, the IRS will throw it out â and you need some time in business to get that evidence.Â\n\nNote: You wonât get in trouble for filing Form 5213 only to get it thrown out. But it also isnât worth your time.Â\n\nWhen is the form actually due?\n\nYouâll have to file the form within three years of the original due date for the return you submitted for your first year in business.\n\nSo if the first return with your business was due on April 15, 2020, your Form 5213 is due by April 15, 2023.\n\nRemember: A hobby can be turned into a successful business with a bit of elbow grease and the right knowledge. Now that you know the difference between a hobby and a business, you can easily make that change."
