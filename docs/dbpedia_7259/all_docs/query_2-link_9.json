But you still need to enter the form because the IRS also has a copy.\n\nEnter the amount in the Less Common Income section, Miscellaneous Income and then click Other Reportable Income. Type '14 day rent rule' as a description and enter the amount.\n\nThen repeat the steps above and enter the amount as a negative number. You have now reported the 1099-MISC form with a zero dollar amount effectively.\n\nDelete the Schedule E form from the Forms Mode if you have no other rentals.\n\n**Say \"Thanks\" by clicking the thumb icon in a post\n\n**Mark the post that answers your question by clicking on \"Mark as Best Answer\"\n\nIf you rent for less than 15 days, the income is not taxable.

After you complete the TurboTax (TT) interview identifying this as misc income, TT will out it on line 8, of sch 1 as Non employee compensation on 1099-Misc.\n\nFollow the instruction above for making a negative entry of the same amount.\n\nI'm a little confused on the entry. Looks like I may have several things going on.\n\nI rented my house out for 6 days to a corporation for a sporting event. The 14 day rent rule applies.\n\nI received a 1099 Misc. They put the compensation in block 7 (non-employee compensation) versus block 1 rents (we did have a formal rental agreement).\n\nTo recognize the 1099 Misc in turbo tax I entered the 1099 Misc. in the system. If I include the $$$ in block 1 it kicks off the Schedule E which gets deleted after I answer the questions related to the days rented. Then the amount shows up just as rent income. If I enter the 1099 Misc wit the information in block 7 and name it 14 day rent rule it shows up as a 1099 Misc with a profit.\n\nIf I try to enter the information in Less Common Income section, Miscellaneous Income and then click Other Reportable Income, it doesn't link to the 1099 Misc.\n\nAny guidance related to this entry would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for this info. I am wondering how to make this work in TB Home and Business.\n\nI am not seeing:\n\n\"Less Common Income section, Miscellaneous Income Other Reportable Income\" in order to type in \"14 day rent rule\".\n\nThe only way I can do this if I override Line 8 from Schedule 1 but them I get form errors on review is that okay?\n\nCurrently, the only way to make it work so that I zero out my rental income from a one-day film shoot is by clicking on the rents box to bring up supporting details.\n\nUnder supporting details Box 1 rents I have:\n\nDescription Amount\n\nRents on 1099-Misc. 2,100\n\n14 day rent rule -2,100\n\nMy 1099-Misc Rents becomes \"0\" in Box 1 will this be sufficient or raise a red flag?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nGary\n\nThanks so much, @Hal_Al I can't believe I missed that! That detailed walkthrough really helped!\n\nQuick clarification:\n\nShould I still create a 1099-M in the normal way indicating the payer's name and box 1 Rents for 2,100.\n\nBased on the initial post, schedule E is created and in my situation, I see two forms that I would need to delete.\n\nSchedule E, p1 (Schedule E, Copy 1)\n\nSchedule E Wks (My Home Address) (Not Done)\n\nOr disregard the above and just place all the information under\n\nMisc Income, 1099-A, 1099-C / Other reportable income as\n\n14 day rent rule 2,100\n\n14 day rent rule -2,100\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEither way is OK.\n\n1. Original answer: \"Enter the amount in the Less Common Income section, Miscellaneous Income and then click Other Reportable Income. Type '14 day rent rule' as a description and enter the amount.\" I would type \"Box 1 of 1099-Misc\" , instead. The deduction will use the 14 day rule description.\n\nOR\n\n2. Enter at the 1099-Misc screen. When asked why you got this, select \"non business income from the rental of personal property or equipment\". That will get TT to identify it as box 1 1099-misc income on line 8 of Schedule 1."
