        "text": "Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 06/22/2009 From: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego, CA\n\nGranted it was an over glorified on line fanzine...but I had to go pull a Harlan Ellison on one of the senior editors over the weekend (a semi big fish in a very small puddle) over his Obsession with the world coming to an end THIS Year...so my relationship with that bit-rag is over.\n\nAnd the only place that was interested in running this one small fragment from my end of time Novel which crashed and burned (but is still intact on DVDs and in journals) last November.\n\nSome of these concepts orginally came about in '86/87, and your discriptions of Kalpa and the Library spooked me some what last year...the two of us tuned into the same channel on Death's Radio across the decades...though my vision of the final City was more of sprawl, an unwalled Diaspar, instead of the Up and Upward nature of Kalpa.\n\nAnyway, I doubt this is going to see the light of day anywhere any time soon, and may have to sit in the closet for decades...but my final personal words about my vision of the Other end of time for now.\n\nAnd you might be the only other person on the planet who would appreciate it. Sigh...and Audience of one.\n\nMG\n\n*************************************\n\nThe Hidden Earth\n\nBy the time the Great Galaxy of Andromeda was coming around for its second pass through the Milkyway, before that final series of events that would lead to the merger of two great spirals into one stochastic elliptical galaxy of Milkomeda we'd managed to irritate two galaxies worth of interstellar civilizations.\n\nWhen the first merger began things were already dicey for us in the Milkyway, as Earth was far too known for mucking about with the nature of Time, and manipulating history in its immediate region to its own benefit. With the establishment of Meta-Platonic Time in the 24th Century, extending all the way to the heat death of the universe and beyond, and our establishment of faster than light capabilities in the 556th Century, we had a pretty good gig going.\n\nThough we decided to NOT set up any other series of Meta-Platonic Time on our interstellar colonies...we were able to guide them with news from the future centuries in dealing with other species.\n\nUntil those other competitor species discovered what wed been doing inside and outside of time.\n\nUsually we'd set out to adjust history before their occurrence, dropping special Faster Than Light Ships several centuries back and then going out and tinkering with them before they became a threat.\n\nAfter three billion years we had half the galaxy under our sway, the other half not wanting anything to do with us and often trying to destroy our colonies. The Weapon of choice: targeted pulsars aimed by dropping significant amounts of antimatter on to their neutron rich surfaces. An antimatter-neutronium interaction can be seen to the ends of the universe, and the aimer doesnt want to be in the blast wash of that flare, or any civilizations for 300,000 light years behind it.\n\nWhen Andromeda came cruising through the Milkyway on its first pass we decided to move the entire solar system over into the other galaxy. Some stars were going to be exchanged anyway, and shuffling Earth's system over there should not have been a problem. We checked the up-now to millions of centuries into the merger and it looked like smooth sailing in the other galaxy. Humanity on Earth would go on having a reality of minimized fine tuned probabilities and maximum well being, and we could leave our colonies behind to work out their own fates.\n\nAll it took was a polarizing of the magnetic field-folds around our system. Oh we had to burn off the entire Ort Cometary Cloud to give that extra nudge Sol's orbit around the center of our Galaxy and flinging out on a perpendicular loop around the center of Andromeda's core. After less than a million years our solar system, stripped of comets, settled into a new orbit in a different Galaxy as we watched our old home stream of stars recede temporarily into the night.\n\nBut it wasn't until that time we noticed something was horribly wrong. The centuries toward the heat death of the universe were suddenly sealed off to us. And the past down-now of the 25th Century appeared to be subtly altering more and more, as if some one else was adjusting our history before we began to adjust it ourselves..\n\nHaving lost contact with our colonies back in the home galaxy we had to set forth again and explore our neighborhood. We found many empty and useful systems, and expanded out again for five hundred light years...until we started encountering the native interstellar civilizations.\n\nThey had a completely different means of experiencing and adjusting time. Instead of one endlessly manipulated reality, they had access and participation in a near infinite possibilities of outcomes: they lived in multiple time lines at simultaneously.\n\nSo began the long fight across this swirl of alien suns. In contrast to our usual mode of operations we set up new Meta-Platonic Times on our colony worlds, and spread out in a sphere 10,000 light years in diameter, creating a zone of controlled realities.\n\nThis lasted only so long&ten million, twenty million years& as the natives had weapons that could reach out of time and disrupt the Meta Platonic Time Continuum. And in some cases targeting stellar mass black holes at our colonies that had Meta-Platonic Time Establishments...black holes we could do nothing to shift around, being undeniable facts of the underlying reality.\n\nAs the second merger of the two galaxies approached, which would commence the fusion of the two into the new Galaxy of Milkomeda, we decide to position the sun outside the merger...detonating five near by stars into a false nova state: these systems were lost anyway as their colonies were destroyed by the guided blackholes of the hostile native civilizations. Four of these false novae created singularities and high velocity targeted stellar mass blackholes, aimed at the enemys blackholes that had just wiped out our worlds.\n\nWe timed these to all merge simultaneously. The resulting gravity waves disturbed the orbits of our planets and set the sun into a path that would have it hurled outside the merger birthing the new larger galaxy of Milkomeda..\n\nIt took 50 Million years for the sun to climb to a point over galactic north of the rapidly merging galaxies, so we would be safely outside of the blast path of gravity waves and other radiation as the two super massive blackholes at the centres of the original galaxies merged catastrophically: setting off a Quasar event that would shine in all Forty Six Billion light years of the visible universe.\n\nUnfortunately we did not calculate all the factors of our orbit, and when the holes merged one of our futures was just on the edges of the polar jet of the resulting Quasar.\n\nThe focused gravity waves unhinged most of Meta-Platonic Time. Some Centuries, their Meta-Platonic Time Sections, were ripped out of the artificial time they inhabited. Some of these we think fell into the deep past. Some of them simply ceased to exist. It became incredibly difficult to access centuries we had controlled for meta-temporal periods immeasurable.\n\nSoon after this the citizens of Earth around the year 5 Billion picked up communications from the merging galaxies, some of them of formerly human origin, seeking the home system of the time meddling humans, giving out a description of the system and i's sun.\n\nThe planets were already in some confusion, and we had parked a ring of former gas giant moons out where the asteroids had once been. Mercury was long lost. Venus was cooling out beyond Saturn. Mars was habitable, warm and balmy and richly wet. We designed some new species to live there, including an evolving Ape and some slippery Cetaceans with an artificial civilization we had built them into.\n\nMars would be OK during the swelling of the sun...but what to do with the Earth?\n\nWe decided to leave it parked where it was. Using technologies developed during the reality wars with the Natives of the Andromeda Galaxy we were able to create a shell around the earth that would take the heat energy of the sun, radiation that would have crisped the earth, and used it to shore up our access to Meta-Platonic Time.\n\nIn the process we finally lost the moon. It actually went flying off at half the speed of light.\n\nAnd so we hid inside the swollen sun, as our enemies and former colonies came up and out from the new galaxy looking for us. Searching the scattered stars of Milkomedas halo. We knew when they found Mars, but they never thought to look inside the Sun.\n\nSo under a red twilight smoky sky we waited. Occasionally small sections of the field would fail, and great heat would come down and steam an ocean or bake a landscape. It was during this period that we started gathering into fortified cities. After 600 million years, a period comparable to the emergence of advanced life forms and the evolution to man, we had all moved to one last city, hundreds of kilometers across. We hoped the universe had forgotten about us. We tried to forget about the universe.\n\nThere deep in the city of Dazeit we waited it out.\n\nFor a Billion years.\n\nUntil the sun started to shed his outer layers of unused gas and dust on the way down to being a white dwarf star.\n\nAccess to Meta-Platonic Time never returned to its former fullness. Travels through time became spotty at best.\n\nWhen the sun finally settled down into its long white dwarf phase of radiating heat from a core of diamond the size of Venus we quickly had to huddle the planets up to the sun. For extra heat and light we stellified the jovians by dropping artificial atom sized black holes into them.\n\nThus we could sit out the long night between galaxies, and stay out of the way of races we had competed unfairly and cruelly against.\n\nThen, just one thousand old years after we had the new solar system the way we wanted it, we had full access to Meta-Platonic Time again! Unfortunately access to the centuries was not a linear matter within its own continuum of artificial time, head for the 35678944th Century and end up in the 82,000th. We even made touch with some of the century sections that had broken free of Meta-Platonic Time and plunged past the down-now terminus.\n\nAnd while those lost sections were in ruins, they had penetrated into real time. Primitive time. Before the establishment of Meta-Platonic Time. The Age old dream had finally come true due to accident and misadventure: a time machine that had traveled to a period before its own creation.\n\nWe had access to the primitive past. To the times of origin and discovery.\n\nAfter much deliberation we decided to arrange all of the Past, starting with the Primitive Past so that everything would result in Dazeit. Into the ultimate Dazeit. The perfect Dazeit. Dazeit the Timeless and Eternal, with all of human history cataloged like books on a shelf in a library of time.\n\nWe started in on fixing the 20th and 21st Centuries, as these were the crux locus points in the development of humanity. It had been decided by complete consensus that the history of these periods could not be left in a wild and natural state.\n\nLittle did we know that we would encounter resistance to our adjustments&\n\nï¾© 2009 J. Michael Glosson\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 06/22/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nHappy to post such Stapledonian vistas, Mike!\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 06/23/2009\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego, CA\n\nThanks Greg.\n\nJust found out this morning that said \"Senior Editor\" doesn't have as much pull with that virtual mag as indicated, as the Chief Editor sent in an email last night.\n\nSo the version post here is iteration #2 of the Hidden Earth, my Editor over there still needs to make pass #2 thru it.\n\nGlad you liked...this myth from the far ends of time covers the mere 10-20 Billion year period of the proposed novel, extending from 100 Million years before the present day down to Dazeit sitting under a cooling White Dwarf.\n\nNo where near as long a time Scale of CITY, and unless some one creates a novel out of the Final Section of STAR MAKER, I don't think anyone is going to be able to top the period you described...in temporal length that is.\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 06/24/2009\n\nFrom: Bill Goodwin\n\nLocation: Los Angeles, CA\n\nI think \"The Hidden Earth\" is great,! It should stay in development, not be filed away (I particularly liked the reference to the \"556th\" century--snicker).\n\nI've got a (blatently) Stapledonian vista of my own...here's a snippet from my in-progress collection of cosmic horror-stories.\n\nFrom \"I Who Am Destroyed\" by Bill Goodwin:\n\nRuination is a potent liquor. Be patient then with one whose thoughts ravel and unravel like Van Gogh brushstrokes: bright earthworms without wetness to heal them, vivid blue curtains of coruscating fire, tapestries of crimson and gold cast from looms of reverie into engulfing black, sighing softly, screaming out loud, even singing, alone or in beatific assemblage.\n\nIt's all a sham. This hallucinogenic opus--this dream of interwoven synaptic cascades and quantum superpositions of information-bearing matter--is in the end no more profound than the tiny sound, remote and regular, of my jailer's watch. The sun of sensation shines, I crack in its light but am not warmed. Cold, I bake\n\nDusk wanes. A faint star announces its mighty but inconceivably distant self through the tiny opening--not quite a window--that alone confirms a wider existence beyond my cold cell. If daylight still obtained I might spy from that aperture the very spot where logic was forever confounded, where love and hope were undone in a single instant of intercosmic confusion. By what perverse inspiration was this courthouse erected upon a hilltop?\n\n1: OF KLO-NAR\n\nThe stars were only a recent nuisance when KLO-NAR set out into the heather on his errand. His name wasn't really KLO-NAR of course. Still less was it heather: it was a sprawling sheet of aborning galaxies, fifty million lightyears across! To later eyes, living quick lives on hard specks of congealed matter, the plasma field might have seemed dark and insubstantial, a hint of structure here and there promising future things but on the whole a place oppressive in its formlessness--dank even--and in any case too simple a thing to warrant more than a passing reflection (perhaps) on galactogenesis or fluid dynamics. Simple to simple minds, the nebular field! But to KLO-NAR it was wild, and lustrous, and sweet enough to bring tears-not-tears to his eyes-not-eyes.\n\nKLO-NAR was himself fully two hundred light-years across. That a movement (say) analogous to the raising of one of our arms took KLO-NAR an age to accomplish is of course irrelevant, his metabolic and psychologic processes being correspondingly slow. I CAN tell you that his metabolism was greatly more intricate than the human. But of KLO-NAR's precise shape and anatomy it is difficult to give a coherent account to the layman. How strange still is the idea that all the richness and variety we know as life might emerge from nonlinear filamentation in conductive cold-quantum plasmas!\n\nCosmic in stature then, was KLO-NAR. That is what I mean to say. Cosmic, yet a clap of the hands would have dispersed him. The dawn of creation into which he was born was a spectral place, fragile and vast.\n\nYet if the cosmos had achieved little on the smaller scale, it was rampant, in its ghostly way, on the large--weaving from sibilant ripples, from playful eddies and coruscating interference-patterns of shockwave-gas, from endlessly diverse interplay of magnetic shear and transverse-filamentation, a tapestry more detailed, more fraught with significance, than any landscape of our own silly planetary mote! And if KLO-NAR's life was slow it was finer-grained in equal measure, his perceptions more exquisite. In that heyday of creation immense breadth of time and relative freedom from catastrophe were fortuitously combined to create an environment where beings of KLO-NAR's sort might accrue themselves with a craft and precision utterly impractical to later, vulgar forms such as we...we who in the end will no doubt swarm verminous through space--matter things, bacteria--disrupting the fabric of these godlike entities' existence with trivial radio-clatter, ionizing coherent light and foul streams of fusion radicals (and this without even knowing what we've done). Bah! The very thought of it, of human frailty and selfishness, fills me with an insatiable rage, an irresistible impulse to--No!\n\nWhat I meant is...what I mean...\n\nSay now! Did you know, do you realize, how dusty protogalactic environments can be?\n\nOh, yes! Dusty and contaminated with all manner of exotic compounds, some even far-wandered into furtive anticipations of organic chemistry! Here in my cell I've worked out a set of dimensionless parameters for no less than seven diffusive-convective impurity transports, which yield to dynamic ones where nonisothermia is a given. Seven!\n\nI'd demonstrate the theorem to my jailers if they'd only sit still and let me. Once dynamic invariants are derived for particles moving in polarized electromagnetic waves of arbitrary time-dependence propagating transverse to a uniform background field, the rest of the parallel with biology is easy!\n\nAh, biology. How subtle its threads, how pervasive its strange need. Would that I had never been ensnared by it. Would that I had known that in the fullness of time even the crystal may become muck through the sly insinuations of biology. At least the Earthly sort--that horror practiced by shambling mechanisms of fat and brine. Give me KLO-NAR's life of light! Woe are we whose burning is slow, whose nuclei remain muffled in electron shells. Only in flame do we catch something of the true dance, we shameful planetary parasites whose biology is dark and furtive!\n\nBut all of that was hence. If there were a single planet yet formed in the universe (there may have been) KLO-NAR had never heard of it.\n\nHe would scarce have been able to imagine it. The character of his mind was as artless before the idea of geology as yours or mine must be before his experience of that shining protostellar heather. In point of fact KLO-NAR's life was (and is, for he yet lives!) so alien it's hardly meaningful to say that his universe and our own are the same--so little do the circumstances of the one impinge upon the other (indeed it was some time before the parallel between KLO-NAR's experience and the facts of cosmology conjoined in my mind, so that his real nature became clear to me). Hardly meaningful, yet one thing demands it. That KLO-NAR and I were, for a time, friends.\n\nWhat is this nonsense, you ask? How could minds as different as I have attempted to convey, minds at different times and on different timescales, achieve any sort of commensurate intercourse? Only this allows it: the fundamental affinity of pattern for pattern that underlies all natural law.\n\nGlistening the hoary field, bright and musical! Cool the microwave breeze, sweet scent of muons evoking memory of youth and splendor, reckless clamors over shoals of helium and infrared, the sly new virgins shimmering, polymerizing! Slyest of all FLEYLA-RI, she whom KLO-NAR now went to confront!\n\nThis was his errand in the heather. Just as I went to confront the woman who'd betrayed me (the one you say is dead) out in the corn.\n\nA great flux of dark energy in KLO-NAR's sky--in the sky over Oakbend a blinding Nebraska sun sudden-breaking through layers of dark cloud. A catch in my breath--in KLO-NAR's neutrino oscilation--at the beauty of the cornfield--of the rippling magnetoscape--then horror renewed at the prospect they held!\n\nI'd intercepted a note from Flavia; that intoxicating student (of mine, at the university) who'd opened my lonely philosopher's eyes to the world of the heart, becoming my first, last and ideal lover! A note to her new paramour, a younger man she now believed she loved, the tiny loops of her dear, whimsical script affirming her (unimaginable) intent to meet him in that whispering cornfield, therewith to consummate their unholy lust!\n\nI did not go to harm Flavia but only to reason with her, to confront the adulterers outright with the heinousness of their intended act and so rekindle Flavia's love for me by the passion and earnestness of my forgiveness. And KLO-NAR--high and transcendent KLO-NAR--went likewise to prevent the female who'd bewitched him from commiting her own hideous compromise of dawn-being taboo.\n\nLike myself, KLO-NAR intended dialogue and not destruction, couching all his hope in a desperate appeal to FLEYLA-RI's higher nature. Obviously in the grip of some uncharacteristic madness, she meant to merge mentality with MAL-KRO, an upstart intellectual of low birth who'd beguiled her with the pompous vaguery of his speculations, and his insistence that only she possessed the requisite characteristics to (in union with him) unravel the perceptual axioma defining conscious individuality and open a portal into some unspecified higher plane of unbridled fulfillment.\n\nGlistening the heather! Golden the corn! Vibrant the dark flux and brilliant sun! Crackling the leptons--and the hot wind that blew that afternoon up from the waters of the Platte. And in each of our hearts anguish, anguish...\n\nCame the terrible moment, the strange attractor, the crisis of space and time! In that moment, we were one. On that afternoon the character of KLO-NAR's grief and mine coincided so closely that for an instant our experience fused.\n\nI do not mean we were \"as\" one--understand me! We were ONE. The phenomenon was not additive but subtractive, peeling away the layers of confusion that conceal from mortal creatures the essential unity of all being. Vanishingly small the odds may seem, yet I beg the reader consider the scale of our universe! In a cosmos so vast and old such coincidences may occasionally occur, it must be granted. How many times (I am forced to wonder) has history turned on such an event?\n\nYet the profane and holy instant of which I speak--the instant that left a scribbling shell of a man weeping icewater in this tiny cell--though entirely unpredictable, was yet anticipated! Foreseen! Even this mockery of justice plays its role in the mad scheme woven across time by a perverse gestalt of flesh and fire.\n\nPrepare your mind! Attend!\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 07/28/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nI'm prepared, Bill! Now that I have a cosmic mind, what's next?\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 07/28/2009\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego, CA\n\nBill & Greg:\n\nI will have to screen capture Bill's Piece and read it later.\n\nThe larger work \"The Hidden Earth\" seeped out of did get a restart a few weeks ago, so it's back on the active projects list, but with no definite delivery time.\n\nAnd a fourth iteration of \"The Hidden Earth\" did see \"print\" elsewhere, but last time I'll be getting \"paid\" that way...\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 08/02/2009\n\nFrom: Bill Goodwin\n\nLocation: Los Angeles, CA\n\nShucks, I dunno...a glowing, white hotel room?\n\nBig Name Authors ought not to tempt Fan-Fic Wannabes...but since you have--and at the risk of offending Mike by parasitizing his thread like a sphexes wasp implanting its young--here's the next installment:\n\nII: REVELATION\n\nBefore you can understand why it is that I am innocent of Flavia's murder (or any murder other than my own) I must give you a glimpse of the shocking new science--I should say metascience--whose broad outlines were laid bare to me one night in our local railroad ravine.\n\nI loved the young Flavia with a desperation I wouldn't previously have believed possible. I'd never been a passionate man but a scholar--it was in the whispering fields of mathematics I found fire: fire of a better, a cosmic, kind. Then--as if a dam had burst!--the advent of Flavia unleashed from me a torrent of unsuspected passion.\n\nI'd been a solitary child. A broken home, an abandoned mother peering into her son's armored visage as if looking for answers there. Visitors to the dark house looked askance at me, some were doctors I think, I know not which. There were whispers of autism. But what joys the child they called \"emotionless\" knew! How I loved to gather the ever-accumulating thriftshop knick-knacks from mother's bookshelves and kitchen counters, arranging them in rows along floors and down halls, rocking back and forth, spending hour after hour devising secret systemizations of my own!\n\nI was no fool. I knew I was different--I watched television, after all, and read and understood more than anyone could have guessed. But beneath the quiet exterior brewed a giant's soul, masterful and grand; full of life and swagger but biding its time (or so I told myself).\n\nAnd time was bid! Forty years in the wilderness, spent I. Forty years in halls of academe, accumulating credentials like knick-knacks themselves, propelling my slim form through the aisles of libraries like dreaming brains, cultural cerebrums whose dendritic fibers wove only faded carpet and gray hair. Then, at last, Flavia! Bright cactus flower whose prickly exterior was but teasing preamble to the heady mescaline-juices within. An alkaline brew to shatter the thickening icepack of my long neglected inner ocean.\n\nOh, those delicate loops of fairy handwriting! Such dutiful craft, which even in her first hesitant proofs showed an innate faith in what is highest and most just. Surely our meeting was in fact reunion, surely we were met to synthesize our inwardly divided selves, even as each, externally, sought fitting and delicious completion in the other! Individuation through coalescence--proof of another kind against the implacable specter of entropy.\n\nOh, ivory skin and licorice hair! Features like a stellar cluster--dancing, shifting, ever unpredictable. Ample septum, generous lips curled in amusement or set in inscrutable resolution, bold mammaries, back like a muscled snake, toes like mushrooms new-erupted after predawn rain. The merry bells of laughter that probed, punished and celebrated. The shining eyes, whose understanding caressed the crinkled contour of my long-suffering intellect--to discover what was yet fertile there, and discovering, to me reveal. As what was fertile in herself was so frankly revealed.\n\nWhat imp's impulse moved this vortex of life to descend upon her curmudgeon instructor, calling forth answering storm from within? I shall never know. A walk along the railroad tracks was her first sally: an escort needed, questions to be asked, an umbrella to be shared. The rain never came. With bees for companions we sucked from honeysuckle blossoms, myriad little suns in the leafy firmament that tumbled down the banks of the cut, a peculiar gully joining Oakbend with its sooty suburb Oakback (which the students call Smokestack). She was amazed, I recall--and for some reason amused--that I'd never known of the sweet drop that may be extracted from every honeysuckle flower. Why else the name? I'd never considered it. It was intractable, I explained. This convulsed her.\n\nShe displayed me the next day at the local dive of the avant-garde, a place of smokes and sly understandings.\n\nThere I saw the side of life denied to my early giant's soul. The red-maned proprietrix of OAKBEAN ruled her coffeehouse with a sparkle more formidable than either tattooed bicep of her sandwich-making beau, burning like a spindle of freckled fire at the axis of cyclones of cheesecake and java, casting forth nets of laughter and reeling them in full of men and money. She winked when Flavia introduced me, as if they shared some secret. From a little stage in the corner, a stubbly sixteen-year-old played blues riffs to hypnotize women twice his age. Clove-cigarette women with shoulders like white Dover cliffs, firm Aztec women--caterpillar-browed--with glossy brown breasts like loaves of egg bread, abundant reggae women like wide-hipped fertility fetishes from the dawn of time, they sipped coffee and listened and narrowed their eyes in unashamed appraisal, warm with desire for his talent-flame. In another corner a massive graybeard of an author scrawled pages which, falling away, were as flypaper to midge-swarms of nymphets: long-haired, pond-eyed girls who (I was told) cluttered his wake, different each time but always the same.\n\nHad this world always existed? It was not the world I'd seen on television, these were not unions to be achieved by proper toothpaste and deodorant. I was taken away in a daze. Taken by Flavia to the garden-apartment lair where she pressed her own particular brand of grape into tangy feline wine.\n\nAnd so I gave up the chastity that had served as rampart against worldly chaos, preserving within me a garden of philosophical delight. Was not that pruriance, that single-sidedness, also a perversion? I like some sterile shadow of Augustine's libertine youth had been a slave of appetite, albeit an intellectual one. Till the voice from over the wall bade me, \"Take up and read!\" And the book to be read was none other than Flavia's paper-white flesh, leaves all-to-quick seized in my trembling novitiate hands.\n\nIntellect, having rested, wakes refreshed. Enriched no less--the soil of the mind turned and infused with new and unexpected mineral wealth. I verily burned on my way home, drinking blue fire from the hosts burning overhead, scattered suns sleeting radiation down into the musty loam of the winding, nineteenth-century railroad cut.\n\nYet as I strode (and often stumbled, compelled for some reason to a speed unsuited to soft and uneven ground) my mood began to falter. Like a crystal snowfall shining in moonlight, my mental field had been. But now, as adreniline ebbed, the snow melted and became a slime.\n\nWhat had I done? Where was the clean and sacred surface where I calculated my life in figures that never question or disappoint? I'd been made molten in a forge--of that, there was no doubt. But now, congealing, I was taking a frightening and unplanned shape.\n\nWhat reason to live when one is no longer what one has been? Expansion I craved, but transformation? I'd been exiled from myself! Into a fascinating country, assuredly--a tropical clime, humid and rich--but forever?\n\nUnderstand! I couldn't exist inconsistently! It was mathematically untenable. Oh, the torments I was made to suffer in that winding ravine, winding like a dark reflection of the Milky Way overhead, that river of unearthly fire. I wonder if I can convey--to those who've not known pure mathematics--the rich and proliferate nature of that matrix where my spirit had been kindled. Dry and lifeless, the abstract equations may seem. Yet in the Platonic realm I found more than mere escape from ambiguity. I found novelty and joy--indeed, all the latitude for zest and creation that others demand from the physical world, but without that world's hideous taint.\n\nWhat taint is that? Call it uncertainty if you like, call it disloyalty, call it the gratuitous action of energy upon its own self-aggrandizing ends. Call it pleasure. Pleasure, that most insidious of narcotics, to which all living things are addicted, and in the squalor of addiction age and die before learning how to live. I lifted my face to the stars, and felt they shunned me as a traitor. I wailed aloud.\n\nDeliberately, I mastered my despair. A choice had been presented. Cast from my lonely (but solid!) precipice, I must now either fall, or fly. To abandon the life of mind for the squalor of sensual reality, and to do this for sensation's sake alone, was of course unthinkable. Yet here, perhaps, was the opportunity for something more than mind or matter, singularly or together. Desperately I groped for some formula to tell me how I might return to myself, while yet moving forward...\n\nI didn't know it yet, but the approaching instant of sympathy-fusion between KLO-NAR and myself was even then exerting its influence on the fabric of my thought. The dread paradox that is the mainspring of creation is revealed in all such singular events, calling the soul to audience as those events draw near just as surely as it demands interpretation when they recede.\n\nIn the matter of Flavia (as I saw things at the time) it was simply too late. The die had been cast. Now a man of the world, I might regain my former austerity only by embarking on a voyage transcending what the common herd understood that world to be. I must reconcile the irreconcilable, pierce through to a realm encompassing both astrophysics, in all its heavenly joy, and those base pleasures which, in Flavia, were somehow a sacrament taken in faith of that realm.\n\nSacrament--that was the key! The wafer had been eaten; in my shame and exile the return to blessedness was already accomplished! For I desired nothing more in that starlit gully than to be clean, and what else is desire but the retroactive shadow of achievement?\n\nSomething in the picture of the dark ravine dreaming under the Milky Way (moist blackness moving in tandem with fire-purged heavenly light) had been nagging at me. Just so may the subconscious occasionally guide us to locations suggestive of the wisdom it longs to reveal. Some dire intuition was trying to resolve itself--I actually stopped in my tracks, not wanting to frighten it away. I lowered my eyelids with exaggerated precision, till all was black. I inhaled a draught of cool night air.\n\nSpiritual and sensual realities (I told myself) were related in the same way as coupled-functions in quantum mechanics. Each referred to and corrected the other; the dialogue was essential if either was to avoid becoming grotesque. Thus, if I truly cherished my spiritual life (for that is what physics was to me), I must not view my momentary venture into the sensual one as disloyal. Did not each provide necessary context for the other? Did not both share common foundation in the paradox of consciousness?\n\nEureka!\n\nParadox--not mere nonsense but true paradox, the actual Coincidence of Opposites! This was what consciousness really represented...a puzzle solvable neither by spiritualism nor neurology; a singularity like the ones in my equations, where terms are exacerbated to the point of infinity and logic leads beyond its own bounds.\n\nDry philosophy? Nay. These abstractions were infinitely relevent! Through paradox I might return at any time, so long as I kept this principle, Singularity Through Opposition, firmly in mind. The truth of it blazed in the cricketsong and camphor-scented air. True Being lay not in experiences that curl away randomly, like ribbons of shed bark, but in the main trunk that was ascendant, Eschatological Time! My eyes popped open. I'd entered one end of the gully human, I would emerge from the other superhuman.\n\nSomething snapped under the stress of my internal struggle. There was a tear and a rupture, and the sanctity I'd believed lost rushed back into me like liquid oxygen, an incandescent pleroma speeding outwards along the billionfold fibers of my being to flash and tingle at every periphery. All the threads of my mad existence were being gathered together, accelerating toward some overmastering synthesis inevitable for my newly awakened self.\n\nNow I knew what destiny had brought me to Flavia. Across the bridge of flesh I'd not retreat, but rescue, rather, one whose glorious essence lacked only a focal-point (me) around which to assemble itself. And this would be my means--this new philosophy. There'd been no formal proposal yet, but surely Flavia's fervent undulations bespoke a need for permanence and purpose. My fame would insure this security. At a stroke I named my incipient system, dubbing it Inverse Emblemism.\n\nSoon great books would flow from my fingertips, bringing in fortunes beyond all my previous underpaid imagining. Already the first took shape in my mind. In Relativity Reversed I would show how Einstein's equations, inherently solipsistic (though this was never discussed), may be inverted-through-consciousness into new understandings of self and society (which I would soon get around to formulating). Philosophy had just become an empirical science--what Kant couldn't, I would!\n\nFearful clarity. Profane and holy celestial sight.\n\nAnd in that epiphanal instant a VOICE dawned. Yes, dawned. For the message was visual as well as auditory--or both and neither, or some sense-form wholy other. I can only tell you that my impression at the time was one of light, although a light which included everything that sound--deafening sound!--had always been. All the senses came into play, lit from within as if by a radiant body-knowledge proper to some other existence. The episode did not manifest instantly but began with a kind of premonitory quiver running through my nerves and mood...it smoldered softly for a few moments and then, like sunrise in the desert, mounted quickly to a scotomic brightness (or loudness) that galvanized every perceptual structure of my brain.\n\nIt was the voice of KLO-NAR, and the voice was KLO-NAR. A voice that was not a voice, but more like memory--or anti-memory perhaps--the very illumination missing from my every mental record presently in this, my ruination.\n\nAnd the voice said only:\n\n\"SOON.\"\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published/Klo Nar II: Dynoelectric Boogaloo\n\nDate: 08/11/2009\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: Poway, CA\n\nFinally had the time time to sit down and read part I during my lunch break at work...first work Lunch break I've taken in a Month and a Half...\n\nPart I appears to fall either between or some where in the neighborhood of Stapledon's NEBULA MAKER and Benford's THE SUNBORN.\n\nHopefully it won't take me another three weeks to get to part II...\n\nRe: Well, this was ABOUT to be published\n\nDate: 08/12/2009\n\nFrom: Bill Goodwin\n\nLocation: Los Angeles, CA\n\nSphex.

The Earth hiding out inside the sun is fantastic. I'd subscribe in a moment to \"The Meta-Platonic Times!\"\n\nFrom \"I Who Am Destroyed\" by Bill Goodwin:\n\nThe inphase periods (as I called them) were also more sharply defined, and more amenable to voluntary initiation, be it mine or KLO-NAR's. At first the distinction was obvious: KLO-NAR surprising me in the middle of explaining some nuance of orbital mechanics to a student, for instance, or me intruding upon KLO-NAR during one of his long, introspective \"walks\" on the feathery boundary between shear and compression wave-space where he liked to watch plasma-birds pick neutrinos out of the Cherenkov-radiation plumes.\n\nGradually, however, the difference between KLO-NAR's intrusions and my own seemed to fade and become irrelevant. We were simply We...a gestalt organism whose wakings were both unexpected and intentional.\n\nKLO-NAR used this fact to illustrate the key principle of a plan I already half-knew was gestating in his protocosmic mind.\n\n\"There is nothing but information [he informed me]. Which individual is informer and which informed is ultimately an arbitrary distinction, as are their locations in space and time. In the end there is only the absolute, innumerate self in whom all possible arrangements of data coexist.\"\n\n\"A Self equivalent in its numerated expressions to Selflessness,\" I ventured hopefully.\n\n\"If you like,\" relplied KLO-NAR. \"Be as may, all living things emerge from and return to this Self, their former individuality an but an illusion of temporarily-veiled understanding.\n\n\"Consider these things, books,\" he entreated. \"You read from one whose encoder is long dead--yet in your solitude discover meaning appearing miraculously in your mind!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I mused, \"the letters function as discrete sensations, specific enough in shape and character that the mind of the author and the mind of the reader are in a thousand little ways each moment fused, hence accessing the hypermental substrate from which all meaning upwells. Even as our own dialogue upwells from the hypermind that is We.\"\n\n\"That WILL be we,\" KLO-NAR corrected. \"Do not forget that our instant of union--although implicit in this conversation--still lies, in its explicit form, hence.\n\n\"And in this we come to the crux of the matter,\" KLON-NAR continued. And his tone grew sly. \"In the instant of our sympathy, there shall lie concealed an even deeper instant, in which all conscious agency throughout spacetime dwells manifest. Indeed it is the point that all beings must soon or late discover to be both the origin of matter, and the culmination of spirit. In this instant, the particulars of the assignment of conscious agency may be modified.\"\n\n\"Modified?\"\n\n\"The situation at that instant is in principle infinitly malleable.\"\n\nSituation was a word KLO-NAR frequently used to mean universe. But here I intuited a more personal connection.\n\n\"I am in love with Flavia,\" I stated bluntly.\n\n\"As I with FLEYLA-RI. And I perceive that your agenda like mine own is in jeapordy. Both sets of circumstances are in the midst of immoral and untenable modification. Do you not sense it?\"\n\n\"Why...no!\" I replied, unnerved.\n\n\"And yet I do. It is a characteristic and perhaps defining element of our resonance. This bodes ill in the matter of that approaching instant which draws our thought into harmony. But perhaps disadvantage can be turned to advantage.\"\n\nNever had KLO-NAR's emmanation seemed so dry, so emotionless. Yet neither had I heard him, before that moment, venture a moral opinion.\n\n\"What must we do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Wait,\" was all he replied.\n\nIV: MY SPEECH\n\nCame the time I was scheduled to address an international conference of cosmologists, assembled without precident in our small Nebraskan hamlet.\n\nThe catalytic event was an eclipse of the sun. Presently the shadow of the moon would sweep across the farmlands nigh unto Oakbend; naturally a host of tourists and astronomers arrived to admire and analyse the spectacle.\n\nWhat an atmosphere of carnival siezed our sleepy village! A bustle of rodent humanity generated, as it seemed, spontaneously out of the surrounding fields. Over amber waves the SUVs came sailing; the single airstrip used by crop-dusters became a crowded bottleneck for chartered flights shuttling theorist and thrillseeker alike from the larger hub at Kansas City.\n\nAll of this I missed, concealed in my dark apartment, mind awash with light. Almost I forgot my appointment. But a frenzied colleague called from the old theater in Oakback that had been secured for my talk, and bade me come (the campus facilities were taxed beyond limit and the abandoned vaudeville house had been unboarded and rented out as a venue for certain of the more speculative seminars).\n\nI'd been discussing certain fine points of projective geometry with KLO-NAR, and now it seemed I was going to be late. With arms like oversized wooden forks, I tossed the salad of my flat, siezed a checkered hat from out of the jumble and jammed it over my head.\n\nPerhaps the crowd--a crowd of twelve--was strained by the interlude. Perhaps joint and tendon distracted. I see this now, in hindsight. But I have no head for such things. At the time I made no apology, but simply ascended to the podium and began.\n\n\"Good evening. I have been invited to present to you various aspects of current thinking on the matter of the Higgs boson and its problematical cousin, the graviton--with special emphasis on work carried out by myself and my graduate team under the auspices of the University of Nebraska at Oakbend Laboratory for Deep-Sky Studies.\"\n\nI cleared my throat and set aside my notes. \"This however I now choose not to do.\"\n\nA murmer from the quiescent sacks of saltwater, a slight alteration of their calcium-precipitate support apparati.\n\n\"I mean instead,\" I continued, \"to correct certain deeply-ingrained notions that have become impediments to progress, both in our own discipline, and in science, generally.

Id've liked to have hung out with you guys comparing notes instead of smoking.\n\nHere's my Stapledonian rip off, complete with dodgy discriptions of what a galaxy looks like from a distance; ouch.\n\nhttp://velocitykendall.blogspot.com/p/living-room-story.html\n\nMisused words, phrases, and poor research\n\nDate: 05/23/2009 From: Kelly\n\nLocation: Everett, WA\n\nOkay, I'm assuming some budding writers read this forum, and so am posting this here, with, of course, the permission of Mr. Bear.\n\nOne of the things that really bugs me is when authors yank me out of a story by misusing words, common phrases, or by not doing their research.\n\nA common and simple one regarding words is the use of modifiers on the word \"unique.\" \"Almost,\" or \"nearly\" I can accept, but things like \"very unique\" I cannot. \"Unique\" means, literally, one-of-a-kind; the only one on Earth. Something is either one-of-a-kind, or it is not. It can't be \"very one-of-a-kind.\" If you are tempted to say \"very unique,\" say instead \"very unusual.\"\n\nNext are misused phrases, like \"He vowed never to step foot in that place again,\" or \"chomping at the bit.\" Both are common, and both are wrong. These are only two examples, but I could go on and on. Please endeavor to get these right.\n\nRegarding everything else,please do your research. For example, many authors know that when it comes to music, \"flat\" is bad. Furthermore, they know that \"sharp\" is the opposite of \"flat.\" Therefore, they think, \"sharp\" must be good, which leads to sentences like \"Every note was sharp, and clear as a bell.\"\n\nWithout giving you a music lesson right here, flat means below the optimal pitch, and sharp means above it. BOTH are bad, and to the trained ear, sharp is often the worse of the two.\n\nThen there are technical things. Stephen King, for instance, knows almost nothing about vehicles, and proves this repeatedly, even though he frequently writes about cars. One does not, for example, \"shift the engine into low.\"\n\nAnyway, rant over, I suppose. As the old saying goes, write what you know. However, if you write a good story, occasionally your characters will take you into territory you don't know. So, for example, if you find your characters leading you onto a sailboat, throwing a few words in like \"port,\" \"starboard,\" \"anchor,\" binnacle,\" and having your characters say things like \"Aaarrrh\" probably isn't going to cut it. Research the terms, or have your researcher do it, and become familiar with them. Then, when you write about them, you can do so with confidence, and your readers will believe you.\n\nIf you are lucky, you will garner some intelligent readers. Don't drive them away by venturing into their areas of expertise and then convincing them you're an idiot.\n\nRe: Misused words, phrases, and poor research\n\nDate: 05/23/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nAll right, Kelly, I'll bite (or chomp): what's the proper phrase for pulling or rotating the shift lever into a lower gear on an automatic transmission? (Or, in Christine's case, a Heimlich-Teufel Planetomatic Hydroclutch Vroom transmission.)\n\nShifting\n\nDate: 05/24/2009\n\nFrom: Kelly\n\nLocation: Everett, WA\n\nWell, Greg, the problem is not with the shift lever. It's that you don't shift the engine, you shift the transmission. :)\n\nRe: Misused words, phrases, and poor research\n\nDate: 05/26/2009\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nUm, while I agree in general, and commend you for explaining yourself in most of your points, you didn't for those phrases you mentioned. What's wrong with and about them?\n\nAlso, the 'sharp' thing I think is meant in a timbral sense, rather than pitch - though arguably most writers....um, most people....don't know dick about music, sound, and acoustical physics. Incidentally, it's obvious Greg did his homework for SONGS OF EARTH AND POWER. Which has continued to bear....fruit.\n\nShifting\n\nDate: 05/29/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nHmm... point taken, but I do hope that most readers won't throw the book across the room! I've made similar mis-phrasings in my career. But if you were my copyeditor, no doubt I'd follow your advice! Now--challenge: find similar misphrasings in Dickens or Joyce. (No, not Finnegans Wake...)\n\nRe: Misused words, phrases, and poor research\n\nDate: 05/29/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nFruits of the loom, no doubt!\n\nRe: Misused words, phrases, and poor research\n\nDate: 05/30/2009\n\nFrom: Kelly\n\nLocation: Everett, WA\n\nPatrick,\n\nWell, I sort of hoped that people who misuse phrases like these would be inspired to look them up, but since you ask, I'll explain these two.\n\n\"Step foot\" is not grammatically incorrect, of course, it's just that the traditional phrase is \"set foot.\" I am reminded of the bloodbath in the elevator in one of the \"Die Hard\" movies, when the hero realized he was with the bad guys because of their misuse of common phrases. (Yes, some of them used European versions, but they were posing as Americans.)\n\n\"Chomp\" merely means to chew, granted, perhaps noisily and vigorously, but \"champ\" means to show impatience due to delay or restraint. When someone says \"...chomping at the bit,\" they mean someone is ready and impatient to do something, and champ, in this case, is the more appropriate word, as well as being traditional.\n\nRegarding \"sharp\" and timbre, a short, loud noise like a gunshot could certainly be described as a \"sharp noise.\" However, no musician I know would ever apply the term \"sharp\" to the tone or timbre of anything musical. For that we have words like \"shrill,\" \"bright,\" \"tinny,\" or \"brittle.\"\n\nI've not yet read \"Songs of Earth and Power,\" but now it seems I shall have to. :)\n\nShifting\n\nDate: 05/30/2009\n\nFrom: Kelly\n\nLocation: Everett, WA\n\nGreg,\n\nAh, now that is a challenge, indeed. Not only to spot misused phrases, but to spot them in literature from other eras. I've read Dickens, of course, but not terribly recently. As I recall, the last I read, or rather re-read, was \"The Prince and the Pauper,\" and I think I do remember there being at least one in there. Something involving their residence on the bridge, I think.\n\nI assume you mean James Joyce? I must confess, I don't believe I've ever read him. Where would you recommend I start?\n\nShifting\n\nDate: 05/31/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nDUBLINERS is excellent and straightforward, particularly \"The Dead.\" ULYSSES is magnificent and a challenge, but worthy of the effort.

A 'sharp' sound is something very sudden, with a tight sonic envelope.\n\n*Incidentally, you do know that, ultimately, nothing is sharp or flat. It's completely contextual to the tuning system in use - as well as the harmonic system used and the voice-leading in a particular piece, not to mention the instrumentation used.\n\nSmall story: one of my exes was a violist. She was practicing this William Walton concerto, and she got to a passage where I could tell this cadencing pitch at the end of an upward figure was flat. I don't think I'd heard the piece before. I hadn't heard the recording she had for reference. She said, \"that's how it's written!\" I said it was wrong, and had her play me the recording she had, to see how this guy did it. He did exactly as I suggested, and she was all \"OH\". Cos it sounded so sweet.

Barely. However, it could be thought of as correct to say, for instance, if there were only two of a particular item in the entire world, that one of them is \"nearly one of a kind,\" which is effectively the same as saying \"nearly unique.\" Whereas a thing simply can't be more than unique, so one cannot use modifiers such as \"very.\"\n\nFrom the top side down, a thing is unique, or it is not; from the bottom side up, it still approaches uniqueness from varying degrees. I think it is only an either/or situation depending on the direction from which you approach it.\n\nAnd, by the way, I also believe the \"in\" in \"fits in with\" is superfluous. :P\n\nRe: Misused words, phrases, and poor research\n\nDate: 06/08/2009\n\nFrom: Summer Blackhorse\n\nLocation: Portland Oregon\n\nThanks for the information on what not to use.

I have only been seasick once, and that was under some pretty ridiculous circumstances, in which I was in a far too-large drysuit, with far too little weight, so I found myself bobbing up and down in choppy waters, being shaken like a soda can.\n\nBut what does almost every character in a book do, when they start to feel a bit seasick? They dash below and dive into a bunk, and then are heartily sick. This is exactly the opposite of what they should do. While I am not very susceptible to seasickness, I have experienced some queasiness while sitting below in rough seas. And, did I then climb into a bunk? Hell no.

I've found a lot of adults don't know, either. Like, they've forgotten or something, cos I KNOW every kid was told in every year of grade school, when the whole class went to the nurse for their annual check-up (at least in the 70s and early 80s), what theirs was.\n\nOkay, here's another\n\nDate: 07/28/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nDon't come knocking if the boat is rocking...? Makes sense, Kelly.\n\nContinuity of Existence\n\nDate: 05/03/2009 From: Scott Maasen\n\nLocation: Springfield, MO\n\nFirst let me say I am in awe of Greg Bear for his work. I am a wireless communications technician working on finishing my degree in physics. I have two questions that I am interested in that I have spent a lot of time considering. One is the apparent substrate that the Universe seems to align with (how do particles Know they have rotational velocity for instance). The other problem relates to continuity of existence.\n\nWhat part of you is not replaceable? If an advanced race of aliens were to sneak into your bedroom late at night while you were asleep and remove your leg and replace it with an exact replica would you cease to exist? The obvious answer seems to be no, that you would go on being you and not even notice the change as long as the new leg performed the same and looked the same. But what isn't replaceable? Is there a soul that resides in your organic container that clings to you? What if they changed all but your head? What if they changed half of your brain with a perfect replica?\n\nI have three theories about continuity of existence. First we have a soul and the continuity exists there. This is problematic in that we can observe that the brain appears to process information in a way that indicates it is a biological computer.\n\nSecond theory is perhaps a bit scary. It is possible that continuity exists but that it can be broken without our realizing it. We could have a continuity that goes on until something disrupts it such as trauma or perhaps even sleep. A person that wakes up may have all the memories of the person from the day before, but that person may have ceased to exist.\n\nThe third possibility is that continuity is only an illusion. I think this is the most likely but it has implications. We think we are traveling through time and our existence continues without cessation, but in reality every second we cease to exist and a new existence with our memories takes its place unaware that there is no continuity.\n\nThis problem can be seen clearly perhaps in science fiction technology such as matter transporters that would break down people into information and then re-solidify them. Also when considering electronic intelligences that could be paused and restarted, or even have copies started up on simultaneous systems and each believe they are the true beings with continuity from their conceptions.\n\nTrying to keep this short and just give an overview. Existence interests me as it should everyone since it is significant to the question of life and death. I question the statement *I think therefor I am*. Don't panic however because even if continuity is an illusion, it is a rather workable illusion that we've been living with all our lives.\n\nSince I'm taking up time I'll throw in a third question to ponder. Time. Is time infinitely divisible or is there a unit of time that is quantitative? It would have to be really a small slice, but if the universe is an information computer, what is it's processing speed? The speed of light comes to mind obviously, but does that mean that a particle traveling through space jumps from point A to point B with no intermediate location? I think if we could determine if time had a limit as to how divisible it was it might give us clues about how it really does work.\n\nI want to thank Greg Bear for his work in Science Fiction. It stirs the imagination and that is truly a gift to the rest of us.\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 05/12/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nAll great and fundamental questions, Scott, for which your guesses are likely as good as mine. Brings into question the whole idea of uploading into virtual brains--would we be the same, or just pale copies? There is no adequate answer, I think--but I wonder what it would \"feel\" like... What silicon would \"taste\" like compared to flesh?\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 05/18/2009\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nMmm, fundamental questions for minds of a certain status. At least at some point, one might still ask the questions but not really care what the answers are.\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 05/22/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nIn the EON universe, partials report back to their primary and their experience is integrated, so there's no lapse of \"continuity,\" what ever that means under these circumstances! The same philosophical problems apply, of course.\n\nAs for \"space time granularity,\" this has been part of my thinking--and pretty standard physics--for many decades now. I first heard of the \"Planck-Wheeler length\" back in the early seventies--a fascinating concept. Wonder why the attribution has been reduced to simply \"Planck length\"?\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 05/22/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nUntil they come to upload you into the Kurzweil continuum...

I think you're always just busy being somebody. It's always \"me\", no matter who it is. Being alive is the only\n\ngame in town. You're just born, apparently out of nothing. The Brightness!\n\nAs for uploading minds; when I think about the fact that there's roughly 60 trillion cells in the body, each one capable of computation and awareness, summing up into networks of networks of networks...well I think like Greg said, that mind IS the illusion. It may be no more transferable than digestion. Maybe our sense of \"self\" and separation and willpower is simply what it feels like to have an active and alert immune system, sharp and on the hunt. We may be able to grow odd little thinkers eventually, but the idea of getting \"me\" into some home-made matrix might remain academic for a long time\n\nto come.

As living beings we work to maintain internal continuity against external chaos; as thinking ones our identity depends on memory--in which experience seems to transcend time and space, remaining continuously \"here and now.\"\n\nMeaning that reality seems to sit on a fence with regard to spacetime. Phenomena like quantum entanglement suggest that in some sense (that infinitly useful phrase!) the universe never truly gave up its original point-state. I suggest that this fence divides mind and body (subjective and objective) quite neatly. When we speak of continuity, after all, we're just lending-out the wholeness of that undivided state, which we experience inwardly as \"self.\" We \"understand\" by bring things under that umbrella, turning disparate elements into \"systems\" (speaking of selfhood is akin to speaking of a collection of objects having a single center of mass).\n\nThe upshot: one needn't worry too much over whether one is the same person as yesterday, or would be the same person stepping out of a matter transmitter. \"Me, Now\" is the original singularity, accept no substitutes, and any sensation of identity is it's own justification. All secondary understandings (including that of physical, post-big-bang history) are backtracking.\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 06/08/2009\n\nFrom: Kevin N. Kaskey\n\nLocation: Norfolk, VA, USA\n\nHmm...\n\nGuys, I've been pondering continuity, soul, and our ultimate effects upon the whole of the universe (or creation) for a long, long, time. When I was younger I flew between Carlos Castaneda, the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, the evidence of physical inquiry, and comparative religion with grave and earnest intent to feel out my way through \"It All\". More than the simple, philosophical inquiry of \"do we exist\" I've been pondering on degrees of \"do we matter\" in the grand scheme of things. What parts of us are physical processes with inevitable inputs and outputs, and what parts of us are magic, mojo, music and voodoo? Are there distinctions, and ultimately, do they matter?\n\nWell... just after I had figured I had \"grown up\" past care either way -- just as I was certainly going to continue to be whatever it is that I am for the foreseeable future, things in the day-to-day physical realm became regrettably impossible to ignore, and I had to deal with some VERY harsh physical issues that put a whole new spin on this stuff for me, personally. Death loomed near (again) in a new, personally unexplored way.\n\nLast year, around March, I suffered an almost catastrophic heart attack. I didn't even know I had had it, if you can imagine that. But a month or so later after I had been stabilized sufficiently, I then underwent open heart surgery to have a triple bypass (I'm just about to turn 41 in a week, so I'm so exactly an \"old guy\" or anything -- so this was totally out of the blue).\n\nI was \"taken offline\" on a heart-lung machine to keep things sorta percolating for a total of 5 (five!) hours of unconsciousness the first time, then there was another related surgery that put me out of commission in a similar fashion for another 3 (three) hours. Total of \"not here, exactly, but definitely elsewhere\" time of 8 (eight) hours. I stubbornly/critterly \"came back\" each time; however, \"who\" and/or \"how much\" of me \"came back\" is in raging debate within me still.\n\nI have to personally testify that \"not as much of me came back as went into the situation\", and it is very existentially odd, noticeable to me, and frustrating and peculiar all around. It has definitely made me wonder again repeatedly just how \"survivable\" and permanent our real core programming and relevant \"stuff\" really is.\n\nDid I come back only a caretaker of the reduced memories that Kevin once had full and complete mastery over -- a well-meaning Golem built of the very fabric of our chemistry for the sake of temporal \"completeness\" or something equally as weird? Or am I simply the same guy, just injured in a way that now forces me to compensate and adapt in ways I had never imagined before? I certainly do not have the answers here. But I am definitely appreciating the questions again.\n\nMr. Bear (and Co.) I've found your insights very intriguing for many years -- both in and out of fiction. My personal feelings toward the subject of our consciousness' continuity have been tested and shaken recently -- perhaps for a good reason, perhaps not -- nevertheless the parts of me that are left more-or-less intact occasionally squirm in uncomfortable adaptation to whatever process began when \"I left involuntarily and came back\" due to medical intervention. I am certainly not the same creature I was only a year ago.\n\nMy personal feeling is that, \"yes, something of us persists between states of existence, but the quality of continuity of experience is directly proportional to the quality and integrity of the fundamental 'operating hardware and software' that is available to 'run' the current state of the individual in question.\" My hardware and software have been subtly compromised, and yes, I can tell the difference -- if there were something better to \"run me on\", I'd jump at the opportunity to migrate (though not necessarily as an early adopter -- see Alastair Reynolds ;-)\n\nThanks for your time and place to ruminate over this stuff,\n\nKevin N. Kaskey\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 06/09/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nHappens to all of us, to a greater or lesser extent! Discussing \"waking up\" with a friend who's a sleep therapist points to the extreme complexity of simply rebooting each morning, with attendant medical problems that for some folks occur... just after waking up.\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 06/21/2009\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\n........I just never was compelled to think along most of these lines. The only thing I've been concerned with is 'order'. Specifically, my own funxion - that is, how accurate, and insightful, is the model in my mind of the cosmos of the cosmos. (Get that?) Death, personal meaning, purpose....all that shit has no bearing or is simply irrelevant. It also has the advantage of the analogue of a bullshit detector: it keeps one from internal drama.\n\nTangentially, I'll share something recent I experienced and wrote about, for exactly circumstances such as this:\n\nMy aunt translated yesterday. She didn't go out kicking and screaming. She was ready. I was ready. I saw her last Friday, just before I went to my 20th (and first) high school reunion. She'd been in a sordid physical state for the last two years, and I wondered if things might...change...soon. And around that day or before, and through yesterday, I'd been feeling bright and illuminated. Clean. I feel even more so. And I feel ever...closer...with her. Incidentally, my serenity, as she mentioned to me last Friday, is one reason she and I were so close.\n\nPeople express themselves out of emotion. However, the emotion, let alone the intent, behind their expression isn't necessarily what the audience might think. I expressed the above for two, related, reasons:\n\n- to share my experience of the event, which is that she transcended this frame, and it's a wonderful feeling I have. She is more 'with me' than ever. (No, she was not a Jedi. Heheheheh.)\n\n- and to perhaps, at least somewhat, relieve you of your fears of something that isn't. Death.\n\nThis was my first such experience, I think. Before it, I was similarly untroubled/unworried. I do have the advantage of interest in and care for my physical (and 'spiritual') health, so ain't likely ahm gonna have a heart attack or stroke. I recommend the same to others.\n\nRe: Continuity of Existence\n\nDate: 06/21/2009\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nWhoops. After \"simply irrelevant\" it should say something like, 'the lack of these.....has the advantage....'.

Vit D is found in fish and fruit.\n\nPersonally I dont eat much of either, so I'm going to the health store tomorrow to stock up on ' one a day' supplements. Probably better than \"Tamiflu\" as I'm very suspicious of drugs that deal with viral infections. The boffins will probably argue against this, but thats their problem.\n\nBe brave people!...Dont panic!..even if you get you have a 90% plus chance of survival with modern medicen...Cheer up!\n\nBest Regards\n\nAndrew\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 04/29/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nI don't know of any scientific support for the efficacy of Vitamin D against viral infections. I've never heard this theory about lack of vitamin D being behind the pandemic in 1918--and I severely doubt it really contributed. Best advice--if you're sick, stay home (other than seeing your doctor) and don't go to work or travel, and if you're not sick, wash your hands and don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with your fingers. Viruses can survive on dry surfaces--doorknobs, countertops--for hours. Cough into your arm--your sleeve--rather than your hand. And when a vaccine becomes available for this particular virus, or its possible mutations, get vaccinated. Get your loved ones vaccinated. Go with the real science on this one, or put your friends and family--and yourself--at real risk. Diseases prey on our weaknesses.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 04/30/2009\n\nFrom: Patrick B.\n\nLocation: Vancouver, WA\n\nI'd be extremely skeptical of this assertion. As Greg has mentioned, I've never heard of any evidence to support this either. Besides, a vitamin D deficiency for someone in the US is unlikely since our milk and many common food products have supplemental vitamin D added (as well as A). Also, your body is able to create D through skin exposure to sunlight.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about the abuse of \"big pharma\" pushing drugs, but remember, the supplement industry is a huge business as well without the government oversight or scientific scrutiny that pharma is under. Any extraordinary claims made about the efficacy of supplements needs to be held to the same standard of evidence.\n\nTo add to what Greg has mentioned about sticking to the science, I whole heartedly agree. There is already a paranoid movement in place telling people to avoid any future vaccination programs, citing the 1976 swine flu scare as evidence. This worries me.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 04/30/2009\n\nFrom: Jim Duron\n\nLocation: Prairieville, La\n\nGreg,\n\nMy understanding of vitamins and flu is that with normal yearly influenza vitamin \"C\" is a commonly subscribed by doctors to strengthen the immune system. Does it help who knows?\n\nOn the flip side the Spanish Flu virus of 1918-1918 that killed 40 million used strong healthy immune systems against the body. The virus was much worse on people 25-55 and killing them within days of the first symptoms. This flu came in three waves first in March, then November (the most deadly) and again in 1919. It only took a month to reach the USA in 1918.\n\nTwo ways of reducing the 1918 virus was minimal social contact 50-75% less chance of contacting the Virus. And sterilizing any and all hand contact, Door knobs, money grocery carts Etc.\n\nSounds like a great book Greg. Survivors was recently remade in the UK on BBC how fitting.\n\nStay safe and smart.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 04/30/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nAgreed. If anyone traces the source of this Vitamin D rumor to a supplement company, or any such industry group, I'd like to know the details.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 04/30/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nExcellent point--an overactive immune system was a big cause of mortality in 1918. As for vitamin C, it had a huge vogue back in the 1970s--in large part because Linus Pauling supported and promoted its efficacy against viruses--but today, the science seems pretty weak on that assertion. As for vitamin D and sunlight, I take a supplement (as recommended) since we don't get a lot of sunlight in Seattle, and I'm allergic to milk! But whenever possible, I spend some time under the sun to get the real stuff--straight from the skin.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/01/2009\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nThe best D comes from your body, yes. There's lots of stuff related to D deficiency, though, and looking in the mainstream is going to get you dick. Literally. Medicine is not the same as science, and there's lots of bad medicine out there, much of it mainstream. Has been for ages. The best and simplest are:\n\n1) hygiene as noted above - but all the time folks - don't be slackers.\n\n2) consumption according to your metabolic type (and try to avoid all the gimics that have jumped on that wagon, sheesh).\n\nAs for milk, I suggest not even thinking about that shit. Unless it's raw, from range-fed cattle - or, even better, goats or sheep.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/01/2009\n\nFrom: Andrew Carpenter\n\nLocation: Influenza \"pandemic?\"\n\nHi,\n\nI'm not a nutritionist or a supplement abuser, I just wanted to say to everyone dont panic during this non pandemic.\n\nJust one point though... I bet if you offered my Great Grandfather some supplements, while he was sitting up to his waist in filth in the trenches of the Somme battlefield in WWI..and gave them to his family who'd been living on turnip leaf soup for two years he would have taken them like a shot! (that pandemic ripped through my family like a scythe). I dont think that they had a chance to enjoy a Californian diet much then or in WWII when Nazi bombs were dropping on them three times a day.\n\nI say this as a non scientific person..but hopefully this fact wont preclude me from this debate.\n\nBest Regards\n\nAndrew\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/01/2009\n\nFrom: Andrew Carpenter\n\nLocation: France\n\nGreg,\n\nI'm sorry..it is me who started it..the same guy who has the slugs (who eat all my new lettuces!) ..I didnt mean to start a \"whodunnit!\" about Vit D I just thought that hand washing was a good idea..maybe some vitamins.

It seems that a Large corporate Pig farm is the origin for the first cases in Mexico(that's were the Mexican boy got it from) and Wisconsin(Both American owned).

There were emergency rooms in SoCal, and probably elsewhere, where people with a slight sniffle thought they were going to die of the Swine Flu.\n\nEveryone over-reacted. Has the media spiraled out of control over the \"If it bleeds it leads\" mind set? Further Exaggerated by 24 hour cable news services that have to keep their ratings up, with something...and the Economic Depression just doesn't drive the viewer numbers any more.\n\nWhat of the 60,000-75,000 people who die of Flu every year?\n\nOne of my videographer connections went into Urgent Care last week for lower back pain and they over reacted and thought she might have Swine Flu (she pulled muscles moving furniture) and made her sit in the waiting room with a mask on...which she actually liked cause none of the other patients bothered her (she is literally a \"hot mama\" and gets sweated by total strangers all the time in public).\n\nThe Media and the Public were starting to act as if this was Ebola or Aire Borne AIDS, not just a mutant flu coming back from Spring Break. It's fueled that fantasies of those who WANT to see Civilization Fall, as THE FINAL CRISIS. Even the slightly over-reactive saw it as \"Captain Tripps\".\n\nWhile there was a porcine origin biovirus infecting tens or dozens of people (maybe hundreds at this time) the real virus was a mental one: Hysteria spread thru the Vector of sloppy news reporting.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/09/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nHm... raw milk has a potentially large range of health problems, unless you know it comes from a very trusted source!

In the trenches, they were likely dealing with bad food, rats, other diseases, and not much in the way of sunshine. German trenches were a little less inhospitable, as they dug them to stay in them for a while and provided proper sanitation.

In fact, in most cases, if it can be sold at all, it's done by owning shares in the cow/goats/sheep, meaning it's local, and you have every opportunity to see them and their environment. Further, people who do this often are largely struggling (not only due to the scarcity in the market, but from the animosity of the milk industry and their LOBBYISTS).

Animals on factory farms are often stressed to the max, making them perfect hosts for viruses. In an ironic way, a factory farm is a lot like World War I...\n\nNumerically, this flu does not seem out of the ordinary, though it's late in the flu season. Chief concern seems to now focus on the fall, when it might return with strengthened virulence. By then, if there's a vaccine, I'll definitely be getting a shot.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/12/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nGiven the composition and nature of this flu, I don't think the concern was overblown. We're not over this one just yet--and in November, we might be much better prepared. Had there not been an outcry and \"overreaction,\" particularly in Mexico, what would the outbreak be like now?\n\nRemember, when running from a herd of engraged elephants, not being squashed is no reason for not running the next time as well...\n\nRe: Swine Influenza (factory Farms)\n\nDate: 05/17/2009\n\nFrom: Andrew Carpenter\n\nLocation: France\n\nDear Greg,\n\nThe mass movement of cattle in the U.K was one the main causes for the spread of BSE back in the day. So it surprises me that even after all those lessons were learned, that the French and other countries still transport animals in jam packed trucks all over the place..State to State; Country to Country..contamination is very possible under these circumstances\n\nAs A Chef, I wont buy meat unless the animals have been reared no more than two miles away..my customers demand it..and I'm lucky to be able to control the quality of the meat that I supply to them. In the same way, I either use my own vegetables, or the ones from my neighbours. Believe me..I've cut up and cooked hundreds of kilos of meat in my time...and there is a huge difference in the taste and texture of animals that were looked after prior to their demise.\n\nI dont know what its like in the States..(well I do cos I look into it a bit) but it seems crazy that you have so many farmers producing awesome stuff, going bust and \"repo'd\" every year.( see Neil Young Farm Aid) The demand for low quality, mass prouced cheap gunk will hopefully decline in the \"crunch\", and hopefully pave the way to more thoughtful consumation.\n\nAnyway..this is my comment in response to yours on the upsurge of factory farms. For once this is a subject I know a little about, hence this contribution\n\nCheers\n\nAndrew\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/18/2009\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nAnother thing about vaccination: I've met two women, now, who have autistic children. Both of one of the women's sons are. And in each case, including incidentally all others I've talked with via other media who have autistic children, the conditions manifested after a PROGRESSIVE VACCINATION schedule in infancy, where the children developed high fevers and even brain swelling after being vaccinated. This is still apparently not being looked into by mainstream medicine.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza (factory Farms)\n\nDate: 05/22/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThanks, Andrew! I think the chief concerns here are about price. Mass-produced food reaches far more consumers than local, \"boutique\" meat and vegetables--costs are lower. Quality of course is also lower (though I wonder if it has to be, given some clever re-thinking), and the risk of creating and spreading \"zoonotic\" disease must be taken into the economic equation. Mistreatment of animals--including unnatural rearing, compressed herding, and stressful transport--is of concern for so many reasons.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/22/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThe scientific verdict is in: no form of vaccination has had a verifiable statistical link to autism. How many other children went through those same procedures and did not develop autism? Millions, more than likely. The family tragedy here is immense, but this does not appear to be a cause, and any reduction in vaccination schedules will lead to many, many more illnesses and deaths.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 05/22/2009\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nre: vaccination and autism: Mmmmmm, it seems that for those who experienced such a coincidence, there is not other factor available. It could very likely be a genetic factor that is unobvious/unknown. Like playing roulette.\n\nAutism and Other Vaccination Scares\n\nDate: 07/14/2009\n\nFrom: Fiona Reynolds\n\nLocation: Stockport, UK\n\nOnly two months late for a comment here I suppose, but here goes.\n\nThis is an extract from a book by Ben Goldacre who writes \"Bad Science\" for \"The Guardian\" newspaper (UK) and he sums up the problem with vaccination scares far more succinctly than I can. (http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/#more-772)\n\n\"Before we begin, its worth taking a moment to look at vaccine scares around the world, because Im always struck by how circumscribed these panics are. The MMR and autism scare, for example, is practically non-existent outside Britain*. But throughout the 1990s France was in the grip of a scare that hepatitis B vaccine caused multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"In the US, the major vaccine fear has been around the use of a preservative called thiomersal, although somehow this hasnt caught on here, even though that same preservative was used in Britain. In the 1970s there was a widespread concern in the UK, driven again by a single doctor, that whooping-cough vaccine was causing neurological damage.\n\n\"What the diversity of these anti-vaccination panics helps to illustrate is the way in which they reflect local political and social concerns more than a genuine appraisal of the risk data, because if the vaccine for hepatitis B, or MMR, is dangerous in one country, it should be equally dangerous everywhere; and if those concerns were genuinely grounded in the evidence, especially in an age of the rapid propagation of information, you would expect the concerns to be expressed by journalists everywhere. Theyre not.\"\n\n* Of course, Andrew Wakefield is weaving his own brand of magic in the US these days. He's speaking at the National Autism COnference later this year (http://www.nationalautismconference.org/speakerbios.htm). Despite discredited research alleging a link between MMR and autism, triggering the MMR vaccination panic in the UK and being investigated by the GMC.\n\nHappy Days. Grr.\n\nAutism and Other Vaccination Scares\n\nDate: 07/14/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nAn excellent overview from an international perspective. Thanks, Fiona.\n\nRe: Swine Influenza\n\nDate: 07/22/2009\n\nFrom: Andrew Carpenter\n\nLocation: Cauterets, France\n\nDear Greg,\n\nI hope that anyone reading this site will run away from any enforced vaccination programme. I sincerely hope that we are all given the choice, but it seems to me that mandatory vaccination is coming to us all.\n\nNone of the anti virals have been properly tested and I've heard that \"Tamiflu\" could potentially kill as many people as it saves. I believe that it is toxic to many people and should be avoided. For my part, I refuse to take any anti viral medicine; I always have and I always will; and if anyone tries to force it on to me...they'll have to contend with my Basque neighbours and our dogs.\n\nIts an interesting time, but I dont believe the crap that is coming out of \"Project Camelot\" right now..if I did, well we might as well shoot ourselves now..Niburu..chemtrails..morphing influenza virus..what next? I think that they are very dangerous folk!\n\nCheers\n\nAndrew"
