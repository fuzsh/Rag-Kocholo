        "text": "2024 is officially here and with the new year comes the excitement for all the new books that we want to buy this year.\n\nThis will be a very long post, so I’ve grouped these upcoming books into categories. There are already a lot of books here, but I have edited this post seven times already and need to stop at one point. I am certain that just after this goes up, a whole new set of cool books will be announced. It’s definitely looking to be a good year with lots of interesting debuts.\n\nAlso, the good thing about me editing this post so much is that some of these books are already out by now and you can just go and buy them. Yay!\n\nThe categories of my list are:\n\nDebut Novels (Adult and Young Adult)\n\nSequels (Adult and Young Adult + 1 Middle Grade)\n\nNew books by established authors (Adult and Young Adult)\n\nI’ll post the cover and synospsis for each book (unless it hasn’t been revealed yet) and if I have something to say about a release my thoughts will be posted on grey background . So, let’s get into it. Prepare your lists, get your Goodreads account ready, and off we go:\n\nFRANCES WHITE – VOYAGE OF THE DAMNED (January 18th)\n\nFor a thousand years, Concordia has maintained peace between its provinces. To mark this incredible feat, the emperor’s ship embarks upon a twelve-day voyage to the sacred Goddess’s Mountain.\n\nAboard are the heirs of the twelve provinces of Concordia, each graced with a unique and secret magical ability known as a Blessing.\n\nExcept one: Ganymedes Piscero – class clown, slacker, and all-round disappointment.\n\nWhen a beloved heir is murdered, everyone is a suspect. Stuck at sea and surrounded by powerful people without a Blessing to protect him, odds of survival are slim.\n\nBut as the bodies pile higher, Ganymedes must become the hero he was not born to be. Can he unmask the killer and their blessing before this bloody crusade reaches the shores of Concordia?\n\nOr will the empire as he knows it fall?\n\nESMIE JIKIEMI-PEARSON – THE PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS (January 18th)\n\nIn self-deified Emperor Thracin’s brave new galaxy, Humans are not citizens. Instead, they are laborers indentured to the empire, working to repay the billions in debt they unwittingly incurred when they settled on Gahraan—a planet already owned by someone else.\n\nAsha Akindele has lived her whole life on Gahraan, eking out an existence between factory assembly lines and constant terror—studying stolen aeronautics manuals in the dead of night and trying not to get herself killed for mouthing off to a guard. Then she discovers she has a sister imprisoned by the Emperor, and is forced to make a choice: stay enslaved, but relatively safe, or escape and risk\n\neverything in the name of family.\n\nObi Amadi is a time-traveller, sick with a legendary disease. Armed only with his prosthetic arm, his ever-constant melancholy, and the humour he uses to mask it, he has spent years travelling through time and space in search of a cure for the sickness currently unmaking him limb by limb. His mandate: Find the cure, go home. And maybe figure out along the way if the prince he thinks sometimes he might love could be that home.\n\nWhen Obi saves Asha’s life, they make a pact: both will do all they can to get the other to the Emperor’s stronghold unscathed. With the reluctant aid of Xavior, a mouthy deckhand with a mysterious past, Asha and Obi attempt to navigate a galaxy that hates them to find the things they both believe will make them whole.\n\nBut a prophecy has started that has other plans, and not only is Asha forced to make a terrible choice, she must soon reckon with the legacy of an ancient religion and its heroes, who may be awakening, reincarnated in ways beyond her comprehension.\n\nGEORGIA SUMMERS – THE CITY OF STARDUST (January 30th)\n\nCurses are made to be broken.\n\nFor centuries, generations of Everlys have seen their brightest and best disappear, taken as punishment for a crime no one remembers, for a purpose no one understands. Their tormentor is a woman named Penelope, who never ages, never grows sick – and never forgives a debt.\n\nTen years ago, Violet Everly’s mother left, determined to break their curse, and never returned. Now Violet must find her mother, or she will be taken in her place.\n\nTo do so, she must descend into a seductive magical underworld of power-hungry scholars, fickle gods and monsters bent on revenge. She must also contend with Penelope’s quiet assistant, Aleksander, who she knows cannot be trusted – and yet to whom she finds herself undeniably drawn.\n\nTied to a very literal deadline, Violet will travel the edges of the world to find Marianne and the key to the city of stardust, where the Everly story began . . .\n\nFilled with magic, stardust, and a shockingly dark heart, this is a stunning standalone fantasy perfect for fans of The Ten Thousand Doors of January , The Starless Sea and The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue .\n\nGARETH BROWN – THE BOOK OF DOORS (February 13th)\n\nIf you could open a door to anywhere, where would you go?\n\nIn New York City, bookseller Cassie Andrews is living an unassuming life when she is given a gift by a favourite customer. It’s a book – an unusual book, full of strange writing and mysterious drawings. And at the very front there is a handwritten message to Cassie, telling her that this is the Book of Doors, and that any door is every door .\n\nWhat Cassie is about to discover is that the Book of Doors is a special book that bestows an extraordinary powers on whoever possesses it, and soon she and her best friend Izzy are exploring all that the Book of Doors can do, swept away from their quiet lives by the possibilities of travelling to anywhere they want.\n\nBut the Book of Doors is not the only magical book in the world. There are other books that can do wondrous and dreadful things when wielded by dangerous and ruthless individuals – individuals who crave what Cassie now possesses.\n\nSuddenly Cassie and Izzy are confronted by violence and danger, and the only person who can help them is, it seems, Drummond Fox. He is a man fleeing his own demons – a man with his own secret library of magical books that he has hidden away in the shadows for safekeeping.
