Aparently a favorite is now to be made into a tv series by the SciFi Channel:\n\nhttp://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-sfc.html?2004-10/14/11.00.sfc\n\nFrom the article:\n\nSCI FI Channel announced a partnership with producer and former studio executive Michael De Luca (Blade) to develop the original miniseries Darwin's Children, based on SF author Greg Bear's best-selling books. De Luca's first-ever TV project, based on Bear's Darwin's Radio and Darwin's Children, explores what happens when the next step of human evolution becomes a threat to humanity's existence\n\n.\n\nJayaprakash Satyamurthy\n\nKnivesout no more\n\nJoined\n\nNov 11, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n4,043\n\nLocation\n\nBangalore, India\n\nOct 18, 2004\n\n#2\n\nI've read the Darwin books - they're actually among his most recent - and agree they'd make a fine tv series. Well delineated characters, a very near-future setting and a timeless but very originally handles theme, in its scientific, political, social and human implications.\n\ndwndrgn\n\nFierce Vowelless One\n\nJoined\n\nApr 25, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n3,914\n\nLocation\n\nHelp!

Let's hope they do it justice.\n\nFoxbat\n\nNone The Wiser\n\nJoined\n\nJul 24, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n10,586\n\nLocation\n\nScotland\n\nOct 18, 2004\n\n#4\n\nI've actually never read any Greg Bear stuff (or many other modern authors). Perhaps it's about time I evolved out of my own 'Golden Age' and read some recent Sci Fi"
