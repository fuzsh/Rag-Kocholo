        "text": "About the Book\n\nA terrifying disease, or the next step in human evolution? Three scientists must battle to find the truth in this heart-stopping technothriller.\n\nMitch Rafelson makes a major discovery high in the Alps – the preserved bodies of a Neanderthal family with a human child.\n\nKaye Lang investigates a mass grave in the Caucasus – the bodies are mutated.\n\nChristopher Dicken tracks a mysterious flu-like disease that causes pregnant women to miscarry.\n\nTogether, these three scientists discover that so-called junk genes, dormant in our DNA for millions of years, are waking up. A signal from Darwin’s radio has triggered the next step in human evolution.\n\nThe women who miscarry become inexplicably pregnant again. However, this time they are carriers of Homo sapiens novus. But there is mass panic, official denial, draconian measures against the terrible ‘disease’. Only Mitch, Kaye and Dicken can solve the evolutionary puzzle that will determine the future of the human race, if a future exists at all.\n\nCritical Praise\n\n<p>‘Whatever Bear touches turns epic… awesome momentum… rarely have I felt so much the presence of great events’<br />The Times</p><p>‘He has a soaring control of the language and dreams that belong to the visionary… Bear’s books map the future. They are required reading’<br />The Encylopaedia of Science Fiction</p> -\n\nProduct Details"
