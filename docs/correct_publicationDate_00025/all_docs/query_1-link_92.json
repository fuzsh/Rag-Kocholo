And now it looks as if her controversial theory is in fact chilling reality. For Christopher Dicken, a \"\"virus hunter\"\" at the Epidemic Intelligence Service, has pursued an elusive flu-like disease that strikes down expectant mothers and their offspring. Then a major discovery high in the Alps --the preserved bodies of a prehistoric family--reveals a shocking link: something that has slept in our genes for millions of years is waking up.",
