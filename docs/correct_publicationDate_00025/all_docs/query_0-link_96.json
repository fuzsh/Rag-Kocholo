And now it looks as if her controversial theory is in fact chilling reality. For Christopher Dicken, a \"virus hunter\" at the Epidemic Intelligence Service, has pursued an elusive flu-like disease that strikes down expectant mothers and their offspring. Then a major discovery high in the Alps --the preserved bodies of a prehistoric family--reveals a shocking link: something that has slept in our genes for millions of years is waking up.\n\nNow, as the outbreak of this terrifying disease threatens to become a deadly epidemic, Dicken and Lang must race against time to assemble the pieces of a puzzle only they are equipped to solve--an evolutionary puzzle that will determine the future of the human race . . . if a future exists at all.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nGreg Bear is the author of twenty-four books, which have been translated into a dozen languages. He has been awarded two Hugos and four Nebulas for his fiction. He was called the \"best working writer of hard science fiction\" by The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. He is married to Astrid Anderson Bear. They are the parents of two children, Erik and Alexandra. Darwin's Radio is a 2000 Hugo Award nominee.\n\nPraise for Darwin's Radio: A Novel\n\n“A masterpiece . . . Fascinating.”—USA Today\n\n“Vintage Bear . . . [His] characters are as complex as his ideas.”—The Seattle Times\n\n“Bear is one of our very best, and most imaginative, speculative writers.”—New York Daily News\n\n“I’m not sure my heart's ever beaten as hard from reading fiction as it did while I read Darwin’s Radio. This is science fiction set pretty much in the world of today, but . . . it’s a world undergoing a profound change, one that's maybe even necessary.”—Stephen Graham Jones, New York Times bestselling author of The Only Good Indian\n\n“A writer for anyone concerned with the human condition.”—Seattle Post-Intelligencer\n\n“[A] riveting, near-future thriller.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n“Absorbing and ingenious.”—Kirkus Reviews\n\n“If anyone is the complete master of the grand-scale SF novel, it’s Bear.”­—Booklist"
