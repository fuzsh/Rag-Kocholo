        "text": "New stuff on quantum dots\n\nDate: 04/21/2008 From: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nPhysicsWorld requires registration for some articles, so I posted the entirety of this one, here:\n\nGraphene transistors cut from ribbons into dots\n\nSmall islands of graphene have higher conductivity\n\nResearchers at Manchester University in the UK have made the first transistors from graphene quantum dots, suggesting that graphene is a promising replacement for silicon in the next-generation of electronic devices.\n\nGraphene is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon just one atom thick, and is usually made by cleaving small crystals of graphite. At a molecular level it looks like a sheet of chicken wire a continuous spread of joined-up benzene rings.\n\nBecause of its unusual physical properties, graphene is often touted to replace silicon as the electronic material of choice. These include the fact that electrons in the material behave like relativistic particles, which have no rest mass and can therefore travel at speeds of around 106 m/s. The good thing is that these properties remain when we scale graphene devices down to a few benzene rings, which is what one needs for top-down molecular electronics, team member Kostya Novoselov told physicsworld.com.\n\nUntil now, researchers have only been able to make transistors from ribbons of graphene. But such a long shape does not maximize the conductivity, which is why Novoselov and colleagues cut the ribbons back into sizes that can quantum confine electrons. They do this using a combination of electron beam lithography and reactive plasma etching to carve small islands out of large graphene sheets (Science 320 356). We have demonstrated a proof of concept that it is possible to create a transistor based on graphene quantum dots by standard technological procedures, says Novoselov. Furthermore, the device will be able to operate at room temperature.\n\nAndre Geim, another member of the team, says they can now make reproducible transistors with features as small as 10 nm, which should reduce to 1 nm in the future. \"It is molecular electronics using the top-down approach. No other material allows this approach for making structures smaller than 100 nm, which is the dimension needed for operating single-electron transistors at room temperature.\n\nJie Chen of the University of Alberta in Canada, whose team also works on making electronic devices from graphene, is impressed at how quickly Novoselov, Geim and colleagues are making developments with graphene. They are the global leaders in this field, he says.\n\nRe: Forge of God, Anvil of Stars\n\nDate: 04/28/2008\n\nFrom: Isaac Lisik\n\nLocation: Victoria, BC\n\nHi Bloggers.\n\nI've just read Anvil of Stars, and it was quite entertaining. I've limited experience when it comes to Science Fiction, but having read Asimov, some of Card, and Le Guin, I can say Anvil of Stars compares very well in originality. I'm posting because I have some questions for discussion, that are kind of itching me having read this book, so stop reading now if you haven't read the book and don't want it spoiled.\n\nAs I said before I'm not a hardcore fan of Science Fiction, but I just checked up on the Fermi paradox on Wikipedia; so the idea in Anvil of Stars is that some civilizations are inclined to use killer probes to cleanse, at least the surrounding environment, of life, out of fear, paranoia, or caution. In Anvil these civilizations are described as also being very technologically advanced, and at end of the book, evidence of recent killer probes is found. Does this mean, they're just evil, no matter how much time passes and regardless of technological advancement? I mean, shouldn't higher intelligences be able to conceive of interactions with other intelligences other than preemptive killing, which is shown in Anvil to not be all that successful(Humans, Brothers, Benefactors survived).\n\nOkay, but discussion of evil can on and on, and it isn't my only question. What about the Law? This is seen as a serious question, reading the book, and having finished it, I would say Greg Bear was on the right track about this. If the killers really won't change their ways, and the Benefactors know this, why resort to using victim civilizations to do the dirty work, and yet give over all control of the work to the chosen crew? The Benefactors knew Wormwood and its vicinity was suspect, and they knew the mission was very dangerous for a Ship of the Law. I mean, why couldn't the Benefactors have told the the Ship of the Law to simply monitor the three star systems. In hindsight the humans and Brothers would probably agree, considering the technology learned by observing Leviathan. Why give all the decisions to the the humans, who already volunteered; the independence comes at the cost of human lives, and in the end the lives of the Leviathan inhabitants as well. I really empathise with the regret of their destruction. Even the Killers, who could have been guarded and prevented from unleashing more probes or something. I don't think the Benefactors are evil like the Killers, but their intentions are strange. Martin was definitely too trusting towards them.\n\nAnyway it's a neat story, Anvil of Stars, and these were just my afterthoughts. And thanks to Mr. Bear for writing it. I just bought the book and was pleasantly surprised, I mean, it's hard to judge a book from the first few pages, so I just try to pick stories I think I'll enjoy/relate to. Are any of your other books of this genre? It doesn't matter, I know I'll read more books by you, but I don't think I'll read Forge of God for now, considering I've read Anvil and all...\n\nRe: Forge of God, Anvil of Stars\n\nDate: 05/14/2008\n\nFrom: James Campbell Andrew\n\nLocation: Stafford, England\n\nAny story where it basically boils down to the question \"anyone object if we blow this planet up?\" is always going to have some moral ambiguities..! (unless you're the Lexx, of course)\n\nHere's how I see it: the Benefactors use victim civs because those civs are the ones who have the most moral justification for wholsale planetary destruction.\n\nWhy do the Killers kill if they're so technologically advanced? Because technological evolution is different for every culture. The Killers could well be afraid that for all their technology, someone else may come along and have some technology that could wipe them out, even if that other civ is only generally equiv tech or less (sorry, Iain M. Banks terms coming into play here). A civilisation that has only sub-orbital space faring capabilities may also have, say, a competant working knowledge of wormholes. They (the other civ) may simply know something that the Killers don't. Add to that the fact that the Killers may have evolved from predatory species and it could be argued that they're acting in what they see as pre-emptive self defence. Evil? Not necessarily...\n\nAs to why the Benefactors didn't simply monitor Wormwood and the surrounding volume: 'suspect' doesn't equate to 'hostile', and resources are always going to be limited. Monitoring even one stellar volume would be a huge task, and virtually impossible to do without the monitoring devices eventually being discovered, especially if the monitoring involves non-passive scanning methods (which they all will when they come to transmit the data).\n\nEarth may also have been amongst the first victims of the Leviathan-launched killers probes (unless I've forgotten something - it's been a wee while). The Wormwood/Leviathan system therefore became the most likely prospect, hence the course that Dawn Treader took. Ultimately it had to be a Human decision, perhaps because the Benefactors don't want to impose their own moral guidlines on other species. They give them the tools and the knowledge to use them, but the *decision* to use them must be as un-influenced by the Benefactors as possible. I guess that's why the Moms always seemed a bit cagey.\n\nSF story about a hollow asteroid ~1968\n\nDate: 03/12/2008 From: Victor Bast\n\nLocation: San Ramon, CA\n\nDear Greg,\n\nI read a science fiction book when I was in seventh or eighth grade (1967-69) that influenced my decisions about college and career (Im an engineer). I have no idea about the title or author, but I remember the story line very well, along with many details, including some specific words.\n\nIf you, or anyone else, knows anything more about the story, please email me. Id love to get a copy, or at least find out more about it.\n\nSeveral astronauts, young American men, of course, were traveling through space towards another solar system. They observed an asteroid that weighed far less than they expected based on its size. They landed on the asteroid to investigate.\n\nThey found a precisely shaped, box-like hole in the surface, just a little deeper than they were tall. They got into the hole, and saw a row of dark spots on one wall. They touched one of the spots, and a roof closed overhead. They were in an elevator that took them into the asteroid. A door opened and revealed a gargantuan, sun-drenched chamber, filled with air, where fields of crops were growing, along with animals, trees, bushes, grass, and streams and ponds. The asteroid was hollow.\n\nThey met two young people, teenagers, a boy and a girl, who wore simple, peasant-style clothes, and lived in this chamber. They were part of an agrarian culture, who grew crops and raised animals. One of the traditions of their culture, passed down by countless generations, was to go on a once-in-a-lifetime journey outside their world, to prove their maturity, become adults, and share with the next generation, what they learned about the darkness the places where there was no sunshine, rain, or anything living except other people.\n\nSo the astronauts joined them on the journey. They got back in the elevator, touched a different spot, and went to another level of the asteroid. The door opened into a dimly lit hallway, which was crowded with people wearing what looked like helmets, driving around in electric wheelchairs. The people welcomed the young astronauts and peasants as if they were expected, but why dont you come here more often kind of greeting.\n\nThis chamber was something like todays multiplex cinemas. They watch movies all day long, and the headgear that looked like a helmet was called an empathizer. It created feelings that went along with the movie in the person wearing it. So people were laughing hysterically, crying, etc. at the appropriate scenes. The people loved movies so much that they had lost their ability to walk, or at least they saw no need for it anymore, they just drove from movie to movie in their wheelchairs, plugged in their empathizers, and thats how they lived.\n\nBut there was also a library in this chamber. And there were books that had been written by people just a few generation earlier, and they mention repeatedly a mythological place called \"urth\", where life began. I pronounced it oorth, so I missed an obvious clue about the origins of the asteroid.\n\nThe next place they went was nasty. Almost completely dark, full of gigantic machines that were noisy, smelly and very scary, especially to the peasants. The astronauts recognized it as the part of the asteroid that generated power for the sunlight, and kept the air, water and other nutrients at the levels necessary to sustain life for the people and the plants and animals. They got out of there as quickly as they could.\n\nThe last stop was something like Mission Control at NASA in Houston. Dimly lit rooms with guys wearing short-sleeved shirts and pocket protectors. (Ive added the pocket protectors.) One of the nerdy guys greets them in a similar way as the empathizer people, why dont we see you more often? Except they add you must be excited about the end of our journey!\n\nThese guys were the scientists, engineers and technicians who were keeping the asteroid running. It was a spacecraft, built by humans from earth hundreds or even thousands of years earlier, by hollowing out an asteroid and building an artificial habitat that would support life until they could get to another planet like earth. The solar system they were in had a planet with oceans and an earth-like atmosphere, and they were just about to send a landing craft down to explore.\n\nThe theory was that the humans from earth, and their decendants, would move around freely between the earth-like sunny area, and the entertainment zone, and they would only go to the power plant life-chemicals area and the control room to work. But the nature-lovers stayed put in the natural environment, the movie-lovers never left the movie area, and the techies spent all of their time keeping the machines running and working on getting the asteroid to the next planet with potential to support human life.\n\nAnnouncing Science Fiction Quarterly\n\nDate: 02/23/2008 From: Glover Wright\n\nLocation: New York, NY\n\nDear Greg,\n\nI am writing to introduce Science Fiction Quarterly, a new online magazine of science and speculative fiction located at www.sfquarterly.net, and to invite you to submit new or unpublished work for publication.\n\nThe original Science Fiction Quarterly, edited first by Charles D. Hornig and then by Robert W. Lowndes, was published in two separate runs, from Summer 1940 to Spring 1943 and from Spring 1951 to Winter 1958.\n\nThe magazine, which never cost more than 38 cents, published 10 issues in its first run and 28 in its second. Its history was short, its influence more or less forgotten.\n\nOur present magazine -- which currently is published exclusively online -- bears no relation, aside from its general spirit, to its printed historical predecessor. But our choice of title is by no means an arbitrary one. The science fiction genre was born, learned to walk, and occasionally even proved transcendent in the story-filled pulpy pages of periodicals like the original Science Fiction Quarterly -- the kinds of magazines which we have been told grown men yearned to write for while young boys hid them between their mattresses and bedsprings, away from the watchful eyes of those who might know better.\n\nThose early magazines, and the stories they published, were admittedly often silly and even more often poorly written and edited -- and we gesture here more toward the amateur fanzines, not John Campbell's Astounding or H.L. Gold's Galaxy. But what was shared amongst the science fiction magazines, good and bad -- and we will ask you to forgive us if in our nostalgia we generalize too greatly -- was a shared moral sentiment, a sense of right and wrong articulated through man's interaction with and mastery of technology in the face of danger, adventure, risk, and romance.\n\nWe believe that in the last several decades, science fiction has fallen astray from its short story roots; and while we cannot ourselves resurrect them, we can at least provide an outlet in which they may be explored. And while certainly there remain great and storied science fiction publications -- Locus, Analog and Asimov's, among others -- we believe not only that there is room for more, but also that there is room for difference, for something that simply is new rather than old.\n\nIn keeping with our focus on the short story tradition, we bring an intense dedication to editing, to getting stories right by working directly with our authors until together we agree that a story has been written as best as it possibly can be. We intend to look for new authors who we may introduce to the world in our pages, as well as older, more recognizable names who have long worked within (and without) the conventions of the science and speculative fiction genres.\n\nTheodore Sturgeon, in our estimation the greatest science fiction short story writer to have lived -- and no stranger himself to the pulps -- once famously said that \"a science fiction story is a story built around human beings, with a human problem and a human solution, which would not have happened at all without its scientific content.\" We see our mission here at Science Fiction Quarterly within the framework of Sturgeon's claim. We want, first and foremost, to publish the best collection of science fiction essays and stories that we possibly can every three months; but additionally we want to publish work that in exploring the possibilities of technology retains a human -- and, dare we say, a moral -- core.\n\nIf we've successfully captured your interest thus far, please find below instructions on how to submit your work.\n\nScience Fiction Quarterly welcomes all submissions of short fiction and other artwork rooted in the genres of science and speculative fiction, as well as essays and reviews of science fiction books, films, and television shows. In particular, in addition to fiction, we are interested in publishing \"think pieces\" related to topics in science fiction, both as a genre and as a craft; we are also interested in profiles of science fiction writers and editors. We accept all written submissions of up to 60 pages, with room for negotiation if we feel the submission is exceptionally strong. We do not accept work that previously has been published elsewhere.\n\nWe will aggressively promote all stories accepted for publication and in some cases will launch tailored publicity campaigns focusing on one or more stories.\n\nPlease note that since we publish on a quarterly basis, in the magazine we prefer to publish reviews of past work -- especially classics and overlooked contributions to the genre -- rather than coming attractions. On the blog, however, we do publish reviews of current and upcoming work.\n\nWe do not currently pay specific rates for published work, nor do we have any plans to do so in the immediate future. However, authors may choose to receive some compensation based on how much revenue is generated by the advertisements -- placed contextually by Google Adsense -- displayed to the sides of their stories.\n\nMore importantly, though -- we believe -- if your submission is accepted for publication, we will work closely with you in the editing process to ensure that your work will be published in its best possible form. And all of our authors retain the copyright to their work, so once a piece has been edited and published, they are free to submit it elsewhere in its polished form.\n\nAll written submissions should be fully paginated and double-spaced in 12-point Times New Roman font and should include the author's name and e-mail address on the first two lines. To submit work, you may either send a reply to this e-mail and include your submission as an attachment, or send an e-mail to submissions@sfquarterly.net with \"submission\" in your subject line.\n\nThanks very much for reading, and whether or not you choose to submit work, we hope that we can count you as a reader in the months ahead. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this message, or call me at +1 646 789 4174.\n\nBest regards,\n\nGlover Wright\n\nEditor\n\n--\n\nScience Fiction Quarterly\n\nwww.sfquarterly.net\n\nblood music and hegira\n\nDate: 01/19/2008 From: Chris Danvers\n\nLocation:\n\nHi ya Greg,\n\nIts been a while since i came here and gave you a rap, I have read most of your books and and have commented before on how great you are, so I'll just leave that this time and get to the point...\n\nI have had a small pile of your books waiting for a while and i finally got to some of them recently...\n\nLoved blood music... though i enjoyed Darwin's radio and children, I sometimes felt lost in the RNA-biology talk (i had to re-read sections to make sure i understood what u meant)... Blood music was enough for my simple mind to understand... it was quite disturbing though...\n\nHegira feels like an odidity among your works... Though it was enjoyable and compelling, I found it harder then any other book of yours to figure out what you were \"going for\" in the underlying themes... Human nature, cyclic way of life?... But i feel i missed something and i was tantalsied in bits, with the thin beasts/beings, the fire doves and lack of stars... Not sure if i comprehended it all...\n\nI love scifi, but i dont really like fantasy, which most of this book is... but that said it will have me thinking for a while (unless you provide me with a ball to answer them)...\n\none last bit of useless advice/opinion... We all want to see you on the big screen but I just have an overwhelming feeling that you should try TV... I just loved queen of angels and slant... they would work so well as a serialized drama... think lost or the new battlestar... they would be moody, noir-ish... plus highly original (which for the love of god we need!)... 2 books... 4 seasons?... Tell me the scifi channel has better things to put money into!!... I just wish i could make them myself!\n\nGreat work as always, cant wait for the new one, especially since you have been out of hard scifi (or do i mean space?) for a bit...\n\nLove\n\nChris\n\nRe: Science, Reason and Emotion\n\nDate: 01/21/2008\n\nFrom: Patrick Berry\n\nLocation: Vancouver, WA\n\nMr. Bear,\n\nYour comment about Victor being a bad parent highlights what I have always felt to be the key theme in Frankenstein. The Creature isnt inherently wrong or evil, he just is. He has no desire to cause malice and initially has no hatred of humanity. Quite the contrary, he has a keen desire to live, love and be loved.\n\nWhen I finally read Frankenstein in my early 20s, it shook me just how different in theme Mary Shellys original work was all film works Id seen, including the Kenneth Branagh version in the early 90s which approached to work more closely than any other. Most adaptations or variations of the story focus on the inherent evil of science that begins to enter some exclusive realm of God. They generally focus on the irredeemable character of the monster and how mans hubris is to blame.\n\nWhat destroys this emerging humanity in him stems not that he is simply a monster, but his loneliness and sense of abandonment that his creator would abandon him in disgust. He is every child abandoned by a neglected parent. In a broader sense, he is every child of the age of enlightenment who suffered an apostasy from the idea that their creator would seemingly abandon them in disgust to a world of pain and misery. Shelly was, more than anything in my opinion, chastising all those who would create and then abandon all responsibility for their creations.\n\nThis theme applies most strongly to scientists and engineers since it is they who are some of the greatest creators in our society. The act of creation, even playing God, is not in itself wrong. Refusing to take responsibility for the outcomes of ones creations is.\n\nId like to add another character to the list that you and Stephan have already compiled is H.G. Wells character, Dr. Moreau. Like Victor Frankenstein, Moreau is a selfish creator uses his incredible skill and knowledge to create amazing new creatures, only to abandon them to their own devices. He then uses a religion to keep some level of control so that he doesnt need to bother with them individually. Hes also like Virgil in that the consequences of his pursuit of greater knowledge are never considered.\n\nOn a personal note, Id like to add that something I truly appreciate about both yours and David Brins work is that youre not afraid to admit that while developments in science can and will cause great changes in society or with the planet itself, these changes dont have to be evil. This is unlike so much popular science fiction (like anything by Michael Crichton) that takes the low road that scientific development is too dangerous and will invariably lead to our downfall. You and a few other brave souls take the high road, weigh the difficult choices, and offer honest critiques of how technology will really affect us. Thank you."
