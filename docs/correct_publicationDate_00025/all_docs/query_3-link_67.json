Since the Sun is invariably moribund if not extinguished, this could also be called the dying-sun theme.\n\nDystopian sf: a community or society that is in some important way undesirable or frightening. It is the opposite of a utopia. Such societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories set in a future. Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization, totalitarian governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. See also: TV Tropes.\n\nEdisonade: A story featuring a young male inventor who uses his inventions and ingenuity to defeat his foes or to explore new territory.

See also: TV Tropes. SFE.\n\nNew Weird: The New Weird movement is a post-modernist take on certain kinds of literary genre fiction. In a nutshell, it’s a specific genre of Scifi/Fantasy/Horror literature that does not follow the conventions of derivative Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Horror, without being an outright parody or deconstruction. Similar to the New Wave Science Fiction movement of The Sixties, but it took off in the mid-nineties, and was at its peak in the early-to-mid Turn of the Millennium. SFE.\n\nPost-apocalyptic sf: Fiction set in a world or civilization after such a disaster that ruins the world. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized).

SFE.\n\nSoft SF/Social SF: SF that deals with the Soft Sciences or to SF that does not deal with recognizable science at all, but emphasizes human feelings.\n\nSpace Opera SF: a genre of science fiction which uses stock characters and settings, especially those of Westerns translated into outer space; a genre of science fiction in which the action spans across a galaxy or galaxies; a work of these genres. See also: TV Tropes. SFE.\n\nSpace Western: Westerns set in space. The idea is that the vast distances of space have formed barriers and difficulties similar to those faced by American settlers as they crossed and developed the continent, forcing the people to become independent or even insular, with help from whatever central authority (if any) that laid claim to the land long in coming, and immediate protection once again becoming a personal matter.\n\nSteampunk: A subgenre of science fiction that has an historical setting (esp. based on industrialized, nineteenth-century society) and characteristically features steam-powered, mechanized machinery rather than electronic technology.

(See Graphics page)\n\nDyson sphere: a thought experiment by physicist Freeman Dyson in which the energy of a star of a solar system is captured in such a way as to fuel all needed power-sources of a mega-biosphere.\n\nFermi Paradox: the “where are all the other species” question; not really a paradox, but a question as to why we haven’t had contact with alien species (or so we think), and the seeming probability given the size of the universe that we should have had contact by now (see Drake Equation). See also: SFE. (See Graphics page)\n\nGaia: The Gaia hypothesis, proposed by UK scientist James Lovelock in the 1960s and now usually termed Earth System Science, suggests that Earth’s Biosphere forms a self-regulating Homeostatic System analogous to a living organism; the name is taken from the Greek earth-goddess, also spelt Gaea or Ge.\n\nEmpathy: ESP or extra-sensory perception; sixth sense.\n\nEpidemic: Plagues, pandemics, contagious diseases, viruses.\n\nEschatology: Eschatology is the class of theological doctrine pertaining to death and the subsequent fate of the soul, and to the ultimate fate of the world. Stories of the Far Future, the End of the World and the End of Time can be categorized as eschatological, but are considered separately; this section deals mainly with the idea of personal survival after death.\n\nExtrapolation: Predicting beyond the original range of observation. See also: SFE.\n\nForty-two (42): The answer to “The Question” in Douglas Adam’s radio show and novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (1978-1980). See also: TV Tropes.\n\nHive mind: Group mind; minds working together. See also: TV Tropes.

See also: TV Tropes. SFE.\n\nKardashev Scale: a method for measuring how advanced a civilization is based on their technological sophistication. Type I: planetary; Type II: stellar (see Dyson sphere); Type II: galactic. (See Graphics page)\n\nMedia Landscape: The degree to which Communications technology (and foreseeable future extensions of it) was replacing the natural world with a “media landscape” was scarcely noticed until the 1950s.\n\nNewspeak: term coined by George Orwell in the novel 1984 to describe a governmental propaganda language intended to manipulate, control, and often deceive its constituents.\n\nNoosphere: Pierre Teillhard de Chardin and Vladimir Verndasky’s notion of a highly evolved biosphere in which reason rules; it follows the geosphere and biosphere in order of evolution.\n\nO’Neill cylinder/colony: a massive structure envisioned by physicist Gerard O’Neill that consists of two, counter-rotating cylinders in which humans can live in space. Often associated with “generation ships.” See also here.\n\nOrwellian: characteristic or suggestive of the writings of George Orwell (author of 1984), esp. of dystopian and totalitarian visions of the future.\n\nPantropy: This term was coined by James Blish in the stories later melded together as The Seedling Stars. Blish’s view was that in humanity’s Colonization of Other Worlds, we must either change the planet to make it habitable (Terraforming) or change humanity itself to fit it for survival in an alien environment.\n\nParallel Worlds: A parallel world is another universe situated “alongside” our own, displaced from it along a spatial fourth Dimension (parallel worlds are often referred to in sf as “other dimensions”). Although whole universes may lie parallel in this sense, most stories focus on parallel Earths. The parallel-world idea forms a useful framework for the notion of Alternate History, and is often used in this way. Most of the “secondary worlds” of modern Fantasy are explicit or implicit parallel worlds. See also: TV Tropes.\n\nPrime directive: the main objective or requirement that overrides other rules or laws (e.g. Star Trek‘s directive not to interfere in the affairs of “less developed” planetary cultures.\n\nThe Red Pill: from the film series The Matrix, something that reveals the real world to you. (the other option is the Blue Pill)\n\nRedshirt: An expendable character who does not survive for long. Term comes from Star Trek and the observation that officers wearing red shirt were killed quickly. See also: TV Tropes.\n\nSentience: An alien or A.I. that shows qualities such as awareness and empathy,\n\nSocial Darwinism: Social Darwinism is the thesis that social evolution and social history are governed by the same principles that govern the Evolution of species in Nature, so that conflict between and within cultures constitutes a struggle for existence which is the motor of progress.\n\nTEOTWAWKI: The End of the World As We Know It\n\nTheodicy: the attempt to answer the question of why a good God permits the manifestation of evil.\n\nThought Experiment: In Physics, a thought experiment is a common means of exploring the implications of scientific assumptions without resorting to actual apparatus.\n\nWorld-building: The creation of fictional planets and their geology, geography, biology, etc., often including the history and culture of their inhabitants.
