Larry Niven's novel, Ringworld, is the winner of the 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 1970 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 1972 Ditmars, an Australian award for Best International Science Fiction.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nGenuinely Creative\n\nBy Kennet on 05-25-03\n\nFootfall\n\nBy: Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle\n\nNarrated by: MacLeod Andrews\n\nLength: 24 hrs and 34 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4 out of 5 stars 2,087\n\nPerformance\n\n4 out of 5 stars 1,566\n\nStory\n\n4 out of 5 stars 1,564\n\nThey first appear as a series of dots on astronomical plates, heading from Saturn directly toward Earth. Since the ringed planet carries no life, scientists deduce the mysterious ship to be a visitor from another star. The world's frantic efforts to signal the aliens go unanswered.

The most complex of medical miracles, it ensures that every 10 years or so, the ailing aging body can be restored to youthful vigour and health. There's a catch, of course: the cost. Every 10 years or so, you have to come up with £1,000,000 minimum to repeat the procedure or die. For Dallas Barr, one of the oldest men on earth, it's that time again.
