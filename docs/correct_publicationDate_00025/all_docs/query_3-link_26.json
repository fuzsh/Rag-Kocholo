        "text": "“Immortality” is a #1 bestselling novel in the techno-thriller, sci-fi, and other related genres.\n\nThis novel and its sequel, Ghost of the Gods, are apocalyptic techno-thriller/fantasies fueled by the ecological turmoil in our world.\n\nWithout warning, something has gone terribly awry in our environment. In the remote and unnoticed places of the world, small pockets of death begin occurring. As the initially isolated extinctions spread, the world’s eyes focus on this unimaginable horror and chaos. Out of the ecological imbalance, something new and extraordinary is evolving and surviving to fill the voids left by these extinctions. Evolution is operating in ways no one could have expected, and environmental damage may be the catalyst. Once discovered, this knowledge changes everything.\n\nBoth these novels wrestle with the big questions of life, love, and where we are headed. This comes out in the form of a genre-bending weave of action, mystery, love, hard sci-fi tech, Twilight Zone subtext, and thrills, all told with meticulous realism.\n\nImmortality was published in 2007 after close to seven years of submissions. By that point, I had amassed a large pile of rejections from publishers and agents, which if distilled basically said, “Though we are sure this is a wonderful book, we don’t have the time to read a long manuscript by an obscure author.” Finally, I grew tired of beating my head against the proverbial wall and decided to try something completely different.\n\nFlash forward some years, and Publisher’s Weekly had declared that I was one of the “Writers Who Rocked Self-Publishing” and reported how my books had “exploded” on Amazon (their words, not mine).\n\nKirkus: “There is enough power in the premise to leave readers reeling. A novel that will surprise fans of science-fiction and doomsday scenarios…”\n\nPublisher’s Weekly STARRED review: “Bohacz’s vision of a humanity that faces the need to evolve profoundly or face certain destruction is as timely as today’s news and as chilling a doomsday scenario as any ecological catastrophe can suggest…”\n\nImmortality and its sequel, Ghost of the Gods, form a prescient two-book dystopian story about biocentrism, transhuman evolution, the environment, climate change, AI, immortality, and how what we are doing is setting us on a path to pandemics and disaster. Both books can be read standalone, but (hint) please, don’t read Ghost of the Gods before Immortality.\n\n“Every science fiction movie I have ever seen, any one that’s worth its weight in celluloid, warns us about things that ultimately come true.” — Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe storyline for Immortality and Ghost of the Gods was completed in 2003. In it, the Colorado River and other great rivers are drying up, forests and farms are dying, wildfires are growing worse, and mass animal extinction events are occurring. These environmental problems trigger a pandemic called COBIC-3.7.\n\nTwenty years after Immortality was written, in the real world, the Colorado River and the Mississippi River are drying up, forests and farms are dying, wildfires are growing out of control, mass animal extinction events are occurring, and a pandemic called COVID-19 has swept the land partially as a result of climate change forcing wild animals into closer proximity with people.\n\nThese novels proved to be prescient in many large and small details, including small things such as calling the pandemic COBIC-3.7, which is eerily similar in spelling to COVID-19. Isn’t it odd how life sometimes imitates fiction?\n\nSci-Fi Reader – S.J. Higbee: “This book manages to do what all the best sci-fi does – provide a thought-provoking, alternative viewpoint on the business of existence. I recommend you give it a go.”\n\n“Speaking as an evolved Transhuman, I applaud this very entertaining, intelligent, and thought-provoking journey to the edges of humanity.”\n\nDanny Rubin, author and screenwriter of Groundhog Day.\n\n“Immortality is a fine, tense, scientific mystery adventure that puts mankind in a challenge of survival with a short time limit. This is the way the world could end.”\n\nPiers Anthony, author of 21 New York Times best-selling novels.\n\nImmortality, the #1 best science fiction book of 2008 by W Thomas Payne No. 1 – “Immortality” by Kevin Bohacz capitalizes on the theme of impending environmental collapse and the rapid extinction of species that we read about daily in the national news. Following in the wake of the Hugo-award winning novel “Darwin’s Radio” (Greg Bear), Bohacz keeps the reader riveted with a tale of how the rules of evolution when being crushed by environmental factors could create new species that are “hidden” amongst us – including fellow members of the human race.\n\nFull Publisher’s Weekly STARRED review (quoted above): When human extinctions occur in South America and spread worldwide, paleobiologist and genetic researcher Mark Freedman senses a connection to the Chromatium Omri bacteria, the oldest known life form on Earth linked to previous extinctions. The growing virulence in the “kill zones” spurs Freedman to join forces with Kathy Morrison, expert on viral and bacterial pathogens with the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nDespite personal losses, Freedman and Morrison find romance and make discoveries about the devastation and what lies behind it. Other colorful characters include dedicated policewoman Sarah Mayfair, whose horrific dreams and improbable survival enable contact with the forces behind the outbreaks; cynical Gen. James McKafferty, committed to preserving the U.S. at whatever cost; and Artie Hartman, goaded by his wife’s death to wage war on gangs and government forces indiscriminately.\n\nThe seemingly random attacks and emergence of chaos allow Bohacz to explore such themes as whether humanity deserves to survive, the meaning of being human, and the cost of perfect health and immortality. The originality of Bohacz’s ideas is nearly equaled by detailed descriptions of a decontamination lab, the frenzied search for answers, and the aftermath of destruction.\n\nHis vision of a humanity that faces the need to evolve profoundly or face certain destruction is as timely as today’s news and as chilling a doomsday scenario as any ecological catastrophe can suggest.\n\nBuy the book / Read Amazon sample / PDF Sample Chapter / More Reviews\n\n“Ghost of the Gods” is a #1 bestselling novel in the techno-thriller, sci-fi, and other related genres. This techno-thriller/fantasy finishes the story begun in Immortality.\n\nKirkus: “If you thought Immortality was powerful, just wait until you read the sequel. Blending fierce action, twisted conspiracies and bold “transhumanist” visions, Bohacz once again drives readers through a whirlwind in which even the characters aren’t sure if their thoughts are their own or if they were installed by the god-machine… Bohacz constantly raises the stakes, and the crisp dialogue and well-drawn characters keep the story barreling forward.”\n\nPublisher’s Weekly STARRED review: “Bohacz provides mind-bending portrayals of factions vying for power and reflections on the essence and fragility of humanity. But philosophical concerns never obtrude on the fast-paced plot, as authorities investigate communes of hybrids, and Freedman and Mayfair must choose between absorption into a collective mind or fidelity to their remaining humanity. The question of who can be trusted impels the reader to keep turning the pages of this highly satisfying and dynamic techno-thriller.”\n\nS.J. Higbee: “Bohacz manages to provide a gripping plot with plenty of twists and turns that kept up the tension right to the very end. Bohacz has aimed very high with this techie yarn about why we are here and what might happen next – and even if techno-thrillers aren’t normally your favorite genre, give this book a go. I’m betting that you’ll still be thinking about it when some of your favorite authors have faded into the furniture.”\n\nBuy the book / Read Amazon sample / PDF Sample Chapter / More Reviews\n\n“Civilization” is a new sci-fi/fantasy that is coming soon.\n\nTranshumanism is as old as the story of Adam and Eve, and far more dangerous than that first bite of the apple. This is what Dylan Smith is about to learn. As a Berkeley professor of archeology and over-the-hill college football player, Dylan is about to receive his own personalized fifteen minutes of infamy. Since graduate school, he has been obsessed with discredited clues about a mysterious South American archeological site that could change the timeline of history as we know it. He should have been far more careful about that wish.\n\nScientists currently believe anatomically modern humans have walked this planet for at least 300,000 years and likely much longer. Since the beginning of recorded history 5,000 years ago, we’ve gone from stone tools to artificial intelligence, space travel, nuclear power, and more. Dylan believes it is the height of arrogance to suggest that we humans lived as little more than hairless apes for the prior 295,000 years. He instead believes human society has advanced and rebooted many times in our 300,000 year-long history. Perhaps it is not arrogance but ego that prevents humanity from admitting our all too obvious repeated failures?\n\nAfter decades of work and ridicule, Dylan has finally located the impossibly ancient archeological site for which he has been searching, but this discovery is also something for which he has no more comprehension than an ant has for the sole of a boot. Holding onto this discovery will cost him everything and everyone he loves.\n\nCivilization is a contemporary sci-fi/fantasy. The themes are transhumanism, ancient technology, artificial reincarnation, ancient societies, conspiracy, and the power of opposites when they come together to form a whole to fight an ancient evil and right an ancient wrong.\n\nHere is a sneak peek at the first chapter of Civilization (PDF).\n\n“Artificial” is a new political techno-thriller/fantasy that is coming soon.\n\nArtificial is about… well… I’m not exactly going to tell you what it is about. I will tell you the story is about AI and seeking an answer to the ultimate question and finding that answer. It’s about conquering our greatest fears and unleashing our worst demons. It’s about politics and civil war and discovering your enemy can become your greatest ally. It’s about epic love and tragic loss. It’s about a form of virtual reality that becomes reality. It’s about life after death. It’s about how seeking the ultimate good can instead result in the ultimate evil.\n\n“The Bridge” is a new novel that is currently under development.\n\nBaseless fears are deadlier than the deadliest terrorist bombs. America is drenched with napalm from its toxic politics of hate and lies. When a famous Nobel Laureate’s prediction of an extinction event from space falls like a burning match from God’s fingers, an irrational suicidal wildfire erupts that could reduce the world to ashes. Domestic religious terrorists seize the opportunity with their own brand of bloody mayhem. The best way to defuse this escalating madness is to stop using truth to fight the Orwellian lies that stoked all this hate and instead use that truth to fight people’s irrational fears. What that truth turns out to be is impossibly both far darker and far more liberating than anyone imagined.\n\nThe Bridge is a contemporary political techno-thriller/fantasy with genre-bending metaphysical threads running through it. The Bridge is not a story in which technology and science are more important than the characters. Like my two bestsellers, it is, first and foremost, a story about people and society. Technology is the medium, not the message."
