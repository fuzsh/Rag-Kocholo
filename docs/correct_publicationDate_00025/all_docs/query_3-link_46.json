After university he worked as an Assistant Editor at the magazine Punch and established himself as a successful author of both plays and novels, including The Red House Mystery until, with the publication of When We Were Very Young in 1924 and Winnie-the-Pooh in 1926 his career took a very different turn. Milne continued to produce works for adults but occasionally resented the success of his children's stories, which overshadowed much of his other work.\n\nIn 1952 A. A. Milne suffered a stroke after brain surgery and retired to his country home in Sussex as an invalid. He died there four years later.\n\nAdam Murphy\n\nAdam has been writing and drawing comics for The Phoenix Comic since it started in 2012.

His first book Corpse Talk: Season 1 was published by David Fickling Books in 2014.\n\nAlice Melvin\n\nAlice Melvin is an illustrator and designer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Her work is inspired by her love of paper, print and decorative arts. Animals, birds, pattern and text occur frequently in her work along with the odd teapot as well.

Counting Birds was a Scottish Book Trust Book of the Month and was recognised in the critics' choice in the Association of Illustrators Images 34 exhibition.
