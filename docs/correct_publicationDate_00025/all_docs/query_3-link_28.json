        "text": "Fantasy book series by Terry Pratchett\n\nThis article is about the novels. For the fictional world itself, see Discworld (world). For the video game, see Discworld (video game). For the magazine on the Apple Macintosh, see Diskworld.\n\nNot to be confused with Ringworld.\n\nDiscworldAuthorTerry PratchettCover artistJosh Kirby (1983–2001)\n\nPaul Kidby (2001–2015)CountryUnited KingdomLanguageEnglishGenreComic fantasyPublisherTransworld Publishers\n\nDoubleday\n\nRandom HousePublished1983–2015Media typePrint: Hardback, paperbackNo. of books41 novels (List of books)Websitediscworld .com\n\nDiscworld is a comic fantasy[1] book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. The series began in 1983 with The Colour of Magic and continued until the final novel The Shepherd's Crown, which was published in 2015, following Pratchett's death. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from classic works, usually fantasy or science fiction, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, and often use them for satirical parallels with cultural, political and scientific issues.\n\nForty-one Discworld novels were published. Apart from the first novel in the series, The Colour of Magic, the original British editions of the first 26 novels, up to Thief of Time (2001), had cover art by Josh Kirby. After Kirby's death in 2001, the covers were designed by Paul Kidby. The American editions, published by HarperCollins, used their own cover art. Companion publications include eleven short stories (some only loosely related to the Discworld), four popular science books, and a number of supplementary books and reference guides. The series has been adapted for graphic novels, theatre, computer and board games, and television.\n\nDiscworld books regularly topped Sunday Times best-sellers list, making Pratchett the UK's best-selling author in the 1990s. Discworld novels have also won awards such as the Prometheus Award and the Carnegie Medal. In the BBC's Big Read, four Discworld novels were in the top 100, and a total of fourteen in the top 200. More than 80 million Discworld books have been sold in 37 languages.[2][3]\n\nVery few of the Discworld novels have chapter divisions. Instead, they feature interweaving storylines. Pratchett was quoted as saying that he \"just never got into the habit of chapters\",[4] later adding that \"I have to shove them in the putative YA books because my editor screams until I do\".[5] However, the first Discworld novel The Colour of Magic was divided into \"books\", as is Pyramids. Additionally, Going Postal and Making Money both have chapters, a prologue, an epilogue, and brief teasers of what is to come in each chapter, in the style of A. A. Milne, Jules Verne, and Jerome K. Jerome.\n\nThe Discworld novels contain common themes and motifs that run through the series. Many of the novels parody fantasy cliches and various subgenres of fantasy, like fairy tales (notably Witches Abroad) or vampire tales (Carpe Jugulum). Analogies of real-world issues, such as religion (Small Gods), fundamentalism and inner city tension (Thud), business and politics (Making Money), racial prejudice and exploitation (Snuff) recur, as do aspects of culture and entertainment such as opera (Maskerade), rock music (Soul Music), cinema (Moving Pictures), and football (Unseen Academicals). Parodies of non-Discworld fiction also occur frequently, including Shakespeare, Beatrix Potter, and several movies. Major historical events, especially battles, are sometimes the basis for both trivial and key events (Jingo, Eric, and Pyramids), as are trends in science, technology, pop culture and modern art (Moving Pictures, Men at Arms, Thud). There are also humanist themes in many Discworld novels, and a focus on critical thinking skills in the Witches and Tiffany Aching series.\n\nThe Discworld novels and stories are, in principle, stand-alone works. However, a number of novels and stories form novel sequences with distinct story arcs:\n\nMain article: Rincewind\n\nRincewind was the first protagonist of Discworld. He is a wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications, and no interest in heroics. He is extremely cowardly but is constantly thrust into dangerous adventures. He saves Discworld on several occasions, and has an instrumental role in the emergence of life on Roundworld (Science of Discworld).\n\nOther characters in the Rincewind story arc include Cohen the Barbarian, an aging hero of the old fantasy tradition, out of touch with the modern world and still fighting despite his advanced age; Twoflower, a naive tourist from the Agatean Empire (inspired by cultures of East Asia, particularly Japan and China); and The Luggage, a magical, semi-sentient and aggressive multi-legged travelling accessory. Rincewind appears in eight Discworld novels as well as the four Science of Discworld supplementary books.\n\nMain articles: Death (Discworld) and Susan Sto Helit\n\nDeath, a seven-foot skeleton in a black robe who rides a pale horse named Binky, appears in every novel except The Wee Free Men and Snuff, although sometimes with only a few lines. His dialogue is always depicted in SMALL CAPS without quotation marks. Several characters have said that his voice seemed to reach their minds without making a sound.\n\nDeath guides souls from this world to the next. Over millennia he has developed a fascination with humanity to a point and feels protective of it. He adopted a human daughter and took on a human apprentice [6] Eventually the two had a daughter, Susan Sto Helit, a primary character in Soul Music, Hogfather, and Thief of Time.\n\nCharacters that often appear with Death include his butler Albert, his granddaughter Susan Sto Helit, the Death of Rats, in charge of gathering the souls of rodents, Quoth, and the Auditors of Reality, the closest thing Death has to a nemesis.\n\nDeath or Susan appears in five Discworld novels. He also appears in the short stories\n\nDeath and What Comes Next\n\nTheatre of Cruelty\n\nTurntables of the Night.\n\nMain article: Witches (Discworld)\n\nWitches in Pratchett's universe act as herbalists, nurses, adjudicators and wise women who can use magic but generally prefer not to, finding simple but cunningly applied psychology (called \"headology\") far more effective.\n\nThe principal witch, Granny Weatherwax, a taciturn, bitter old crone from the small mountain country of Lancre, largely despises people but acts as their healer and protector because no one else can do this as well as she can. Her closest friend is Nanny Ogg, a jolly, personable witch with the \"common touch\" who enjoys a smoke and a pint of beer, and often sings bawdy folk songs like the notorious \"Hedgehog Song\". The two take on apprentice witches: first Magrat Garlick, then Agnes Nitt, then Tiffany Aching, who become accomplished witches.\n\nOther characters in the Witches series include:\n\nKing Verence II of Lancre, a onetime Fool\n\nJason Ogg, Nanny Ogg's eldest son, the local blacksmith\n\nShawn Ogg, Nanny's youngest son who serves as his country's entire army and civil service\n\nNanny's murderous cat Greebo.\n\nThe witches appear in many Discworld books, and are protagonists in seven. They also appeared in the short story \"The Sea and Little Fishes\". Their stories frequently draw on ancient European folklore and fairy tales, and parody famous works of literature, particularly by Shakespeare.\n\nMain article: Ankh-Morpork City Watch\n\nThe stories featuring the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are urban fantasy, and frequently depict a traditional, magically-run fantasy world coming into contact with modern technology. They revolve around the growth of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch from a hopeless gang of three to a fully-equipped and efficient police force. The stories are largely police procedurals, featuring crimes with heavy political or societal overtones.\n\nThe main character Sam Vimes is a haggard, cynical, working-class street copper. When introduced in Guards! Guards!, he is the alcoholic captain of the three-person Night Watch, which also includes the lazy, cowardly, and none-too-bright sergeant Fred Colon and Corporal Nobby Nobbs, a petty thief in his own right. Then Carrot Ironfoundersson, a 6-foot-6-inch-tall (1.98 m) dwarf-by-adoption, joins the Watch.\n\nOther main characters include\n\nAngua, a werewolf,\n\nDetritus, a troll,\n\nReg Shoe, a zombie and Dead Rights campaigner,\n\nCuddy, a Dwarf in Men at Arms,\n\nGolem Constable Dorfl.\n\nCheery Littlebottom, the Watch's forensics expert and one of the first openly female dwarves, tried to rename herself \"Cheri\" without success. Constable Visit-the-infidel-with-explanatory-pamphlets appears in some novels, and Sam's wife, Lady Sybil Vimes (née Ramkin) is integral to certain storylines. Inspector A E Pessimal was recruited by Vimes as his adjutant after Havelock Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, sent him as an auditor.\n\nThe City Watch starred in eight Discworld stories, and cameoed in a number of others, including Making Money, the children's book Where's My Cow?, and the short story \"Theatre of Cruelty\".\n\nPratchett stated on numerous occasions that the presence of the City Watch makes Ankh-Morpork stories \"problematic\", as stories set in the city that do not directly involve Vimes and the Watch often require a Watch presence to maintain the story—at which point, it becomes a Watch story by default.[citation needed]\n\nMain article: Unseen University\n\nThe Wizards of Unseen University (UU) have a strong thread through many of the Discworld novels, although the only books that they star in exclusively are The Science of the Discworld series and the novels Unseen Academicals and The Last Continent. In the early books, the faculty of UU changed frequently; promotion usually involved assassination. However, after the ascension of the bombastic Mustrum Ridcully to the position of Archchancellor, the hierarchy settled down and characters had the chance to develop. Earlier books featured the wizards in possible invasions of Discworld by creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions, Lovecraftian monsters that hungered for magic.\n\nThe wizards of UU employ the traditional \"whizz-bang\" type of magic seen in Dungeons & Dragons games, but also investigate the rules and structure of magic in terms highly reminiscent of particle physics. Prominent members include\n\nPonder Stibbons, a geeky young wizard\n\nHex, the Disc's first computer/semi-sentient thinking engine\n\nthe Librarian, turned into an orangutan by magical accident, who refuses to be turned back\n\nthe Dean\n\nthe mentally unstable Bursar\n\nthe Chair of Indefinite Studies\n\nthe Lecturer in Recent Runes\n\nthe Senior Wrangler.\n\nIn later novels, Rincewind joins their group, while the Dean leaves to become the Archchancellor of Brazeneck College in the nearby city of Pseudopolis.\n\nThe Wizards feature prominently in nine Discworld books and star in The Science of Discworld series and the short story \"A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices\".\n\nMain article: Tiffany Aching\n\nTiffany Aching is a young apprentice witch in a series of Discworld books aimed at young adults. Her stories often parallel mythic heroes' quests, but also deal with Tiffany's difficulties as a young girl maturing into a responsible woman. She is aided in her task by the Nac Mac Feegle, a gang of blue-tattooed, 6-inch tall, hard-drinking, loud-mouthed pictsie creatures also called \"The Wee Free Men\" who serve as her guardians. She is the protagonist of five novels, The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, Wintersmith, I Shall Wear Midnight, and The Shepherd's Crown. Major characters in this series include Miss Tick, a travelling witch who discovers Tiffany; Nac Mac Feegle chieftain Rob Anybody; and the other young witches Annagramma Hawkin and Petulia Gristle. Both Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg also appear in her stories.\n\nMain article: Moist von Lipwig\n\nMoist von Lipwig is a professional criminal and con man to whom Havelock Vetinari gives a \"second chance\" after staging his execution, recognising the advantages his jack-of-all-trades abilities will give to the development of the city. After putting him in charge of the Ankh-Morpork Post Office in Going Postal, with good results, Vetinari orders him to clear up the city's corrupt financial sector in Making Money. In a third book, Raising Steam, Vetinari directs Lipwig to oversee the development of a railway network for Dick Simnel's newly invented steam locomotive. Other characters in this series include Adora Belle Dearheart, Lipwig's acerbic, chain-smoking love interest; Gladys, a golem who develops a strange crush on Lipwig; Stanley Howler, an obsessive young man who was raised by peas and becomes the Discworld's first stamp collector; and the very old Junior Postman Groat, who never got promoted to Senior Postman because there was never a Postmaster alive long enough to promote him.\n\nSeveral other books can be grouped together as \"Other cultures of Discworld\" books. They may contain characters or locations from other arcs, typically not as protagonist or antagonist but as a supporting character or even a throwaway reference. These include Pyramids (Djelibeybi), Small Gods (Omnia), and Monstrous Regiment (Zlobenia and Borogravia).\n\nShort descriptions of many of the notable characters:\n\nNo. Title Published Subseries Notes 1 The Colour of Magic 1983 Rincewind 93rd in the Big Read[7] 2 The Light Fantastic 1986 Continues from The Colour of Magic 3 Equal Rites 1987 Witches 4 Mort Death 65th in the Big Read[7] 5 Sourcery 1988 Rincewind 6 Wyrd Sisters Witches 135th in the Big Read[8] 7 Pyramids 1989 Standalone British Science Fiction Award winner, 1989[9] 8 Guards!

R. R. Tolkien (1992); reprinted in The Mammoth Book of Comic Fantasy edited by Mike Ashley (1998); available online[25]\n\n\"Theatre of Cruelty\" (1993); available online[26]\n\n\"The Sea and Little Fishes\" – in Legends (1998), anthology of novellas taking place within popular fantasy cycles edited by Robert Silverberg\n\n\"Death and What Comes Next\" (2002); available online[27]\n\n\"A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices\" (2005) – first published in the 13 May 2005 issue of The Times Higher Education Supplement[28] included in certain editions of Snuff;[citation needed] available online[28]\n\nSeven of the short stories or short writings were also collected in a compilation of the majority of Pratchett's known short work named Once More* With Footnotes (2004).\n\nAdditionally, another short story \"Turntables of the Night\" (1989) is set in England but features Death as a character; it is available online and in both anthologies.\n\nFive short stories republished in A Stroke of the Pen: The Lost Stories (2023) constitute the first known works by Pratchett that include early versions of places and characters that would later become parts of Discworld. Pratchett authored most of them under a pseudonym that remained unlinked to him for decades, until posthumously discovered in 2022.[29][30][31][32]\n\nAlthough Terry Pratchett said, \"There are no maps. You can't map a sense of humour,\"[33] there are four \"Mapps\": The Streets of Ankh-Morpork (1993), The Discworld Mapp (1995), A Tourist Guide to Lancre (1998), and Death's Domain (1999). The first two were drawn by Stephen Player, based on plans by Pratchett and Stephen Briggs, the third is a collaboration between Briggs and Paul Kidby, and the last is by Kidby. All also contain booklets written by Pratchett and Briggs. Terry later collaborated with the Discworld Emporium to produce two much larger works, each with the associated map with the book in a folder, The Compleat Ankh-Morpork City Guide (2012) and The Compleat Discworld Atlas (2015).[34]\n\nDeath's Domain is a book by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Briggs,[35] and illustrated by Paul Kidby. It is the fourth in the Mapp series. It was first published in paperback by Corgi in 1999.[36] It was the second in the series to be illustrated by Kidby.[37] As with the other \"mapps\", the basic design and booklet were compiled by Pratchett and Briggs.\n\nThe Mapp shows the parasite universe of Death's Domain. The accompanying booklet provides various details of the Domain, both as portrayed in the Discworld books and newly revealed.\n\nIn Death's Domain, the concept of steam locomotives on Discworld is introduced,[38] which became the main theme of Pratchett's Discworld novel Raising Steam fourteen years later.\n\nIn the live-action adaptations of Hogfather and The Colour of Magic, Dorney Court is the real-life location used for the exterior of Mon Repos, Death's house.\n\nPratchett also collaborated with Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen on four books, using the Discworld to illuminate popular science topics. Each book alternates chapters of a Discworld story and notes on real science related to it. The books are:\n\nThe Science of Discworld (1999). ISBN 978-0-09-186515-3.\n\nThe Science of Discworld II: The Globe (2002). ISBN 978-0-09-188805-3.\n\nThe Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch (2005).

ISBN 978-0-575-60000-3.\n\nThe Wyrdest Link (2002), parodying the TV quiz show The Weakest Link. ISBN 978-0-575-07319-7\n\nMain article: Discworld Diary\n\nMost years see the release of a Discworld Diary and Discworld Calendar, both usually following a particular theme.\n\nThe diaries feature background information about their themes. Some topics are later used in the series; the character of Miss Alice Band first appeared in the Assassins' Guild Yearbook, for example.[citation needed]\n\nThe Discworld Almanak – The Year of The Prawn has a similar format and general contents to the diaries.\n\nOther Discworld publications include:\n\nThe Josh Kirby Discworld Portfolio (1993) A collection of Josh Kirby's artwork, published by Paper Tiger.

Co-authored with Gabrielle Kent and illustrated by Paul Kidby.[43]\n\nThe books take place roughly in real time and the characters' ages change to reflect the passing of years. The meetings of various characters from different narrative threads (e.g., Ridcully and Granny Weatherwax in Lords and Ladies, Rincewind and Carrot in The Last Hero) indicate that all the main storylines take place around the same period (end of the Century of the Fruitbat, beginning of the Century of the Anchovy). The main exception is the stand-alone book Small Gods, which appears to take place at some point earlier than most of the other stories, though even this contains cameo appearances by Death and the Librarian.\n\nSome main characters may make cameo appearances in other books where they are not the primary focus; for example, City Watch members Carrot Ironfoundersson and Angua appear briefly in Going Postal, Making Money, and Unseen Academicals (placing those books after Guards! Guards! and Men at Arms). A number of characters, such as members of staff of Unseen University and Lord Vetinari, appear prominently in many different storylines without having specific storylines of their own.

Guards!,[52] and Small Gods[53] have been adapted into graphic novels.\n\nDue in part to the complexity of the novels, Discworld has been difficult to adapt to film – Pratchett was fond of an anecdote of a producer attempting to pitch an adaptation of Mort in the early 1990s but was told to \"lose the Death angle\" by US backers.[54]\n\nCosgrove Hall produced several animated adaptations for Channel 4 from 1996 to 1997.
