        "text": "Rendezvous with Rama\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nFrom my list on peaceful alien contact.\n\nBy Wil Mccarthy Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a science fiction writer since I was old enough to read, and I’ve spent probably way too much of my life reading and writing and researching and thinking about aliens. I’ve worked in the aerospace industry, launching rockets to the moon and Mars and Saturn, and five of the books I’ve published have touched on alien life in one way or another. I’ve worked as a contributing editor for WIRED magazine and the science and technology correspondent for the SyFy channel, and I hold patents in seven countries, including 31 issued U.S. patents.\n\nWil's book list on peaceful alien contact\n\nWhy did Wil love this book?\n\nOf all of Clarke’s works, this one had, for me, the grandest sense of adventure and mystery. We never do find out who the aliens are or what their goals might be, but we get to join them for part of their journey.\n\nThere are puzzles to solve, wonders to behold, and dangers bravely faced. I first read the book when I was nine years old, and it communicated to me just as clearly then as it does today.\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Rendezvous with Rama as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the year 2130, a mysterious and apparently untenanted alien spaceship, Rama, enters our solar system. The first product of an alien civilisation to be encountered by man, it reveals a world of technological marvels and an unparalleled artificial ecology.\n\nBut what is its purpose in 2131?\n\nWho is inside it?\n\nAnd why?\n\nPreview\n\nDune\n\nBy Frank Herbert,\n\nFrom my list on Sci-Fi real science that justifies unreal things.\n\nBy Johnny B. Truant Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBefore I was an author, I was a scientist pursuing a PhD in molecular genetics. When I left the lab and started writing, that scientist’s need for real-world sense stuck with me and became a theme in everything I write. The authors I like understand that “suspension of disbelief” is a limited resource, so they’d better only ask readers for it when it counts. Get the baseline facts and logic right, and I’ll believe and enjoy the fantastical stuff spun from it so much more.\n\nJohnny's book list on Sci-Fi real science that justifies unreal things\n\nWhy did Johnny love this book?\n\nThis has been one of my favorite books since I was a kid. I love it for two main reasons: The first is that I’m a fiend for exploring the real limits of ability (which the Bene Gesserit and Fremen do). The second is that as fantastical as the world is, it’s grounded in real science.\n\nThere are no giant sandworts on my own planet, but I completely believe why and how they’d exist on Arrakis. Herbert even includes an appendix to explain how it works, called “The Ecology of Dune.”\n\nFiction requires a leap of faith, but the real-science grounding in Dune makes that leap a whole lot easier because I believe where it’s coming from.\n\nBy Frank Herbert,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n58 authors picked Dune as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBefore The Matrix, before Star Wars, before Ender's Game and Neuromancer, there was Dune: winner of the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards, and widely considered one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written.\n\nMelange, or 'spice', is the most valuable - and rarest - element in the universe; a drug that does everything from increasing a person's lifespan to making interstellar travel possible. And it can only be found on a single planet: the inhospitable desert world of Arrakis.\n\nWhoever controls Arrakis controls the spice. And whoever controls the spice controls the universe.\n\nWhen the Emperor transfers stewardship of…\n\nPreview\n\n1984\n\nBy George Orwell,\n\nFrom my list on political thrillers that are not about entertaining.\n\nBy S R Kay Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI see no distinction between the personal and the political. All art is, therefore, a political act, and literature especially, since the author gets inside the reader's head. In 1984, the use of a pen is punishable, never mind having an unorthodox opinion; novels are written by machines—commodities like jam or bootlaces, to pacify the proles. (A.I. novels outcompeting human ones?) Yes, novels entertain, and that's OK, but the best way to change your outlook is to let you understand the human condition a little better. That is why I want more from a political thriller than just the same old lies, corruption, sex, and power at the heart of government.\n\nS's book list on political thrillers that are not about entertaining\n\nWhy did S love this book?\n\nI keep returning to this and reading different things into it every time. As with Little Man, this is not the West Wing/Thick of It classic political thriller, but it is told from the perspective of an ordinary Joe. Unlike Little Man, where the political message is woven in seamlessly, 1984 is a full-on polemic written by a man with little time left in an attempt to shape opinion. It is, though, well-plotted and hangs together really well as a novel (barring the sections where Smith reads from the book).\n\nOften read as an anti-communist allegory, I see it as so much more: sending us a warning against all who think only they are right, seeking to impose their will on others, be they autocrats like Putin, Trump, Xi Jinping, or Farage.\n\nBy George Orwell,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n46 authors picked 1984 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU . . .\n\n1984 is the year in which it happens. The world is divided into three superstates. In Oceania, the Party's power is absolute. Every action, word, gesture and thought is monitored under the watchful eye of Big Brother and the Thought Police. In the Ministry of Truth, the Party's department for propaganda, Winston Smith's job is to edit the past. Over time, the impulse to escape the machine and live independently takes hold of him and he embarks on a secret and forbidden love affair. As he writes the words 'DOWN WITH BIG…\n\nPreview\n\nParable of the Sower\n\nBy Octavia E. Butler,\n\nFrom my list on reimagine the past and see a strange new future.\n\nBy Alison McBain Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy family could never afford vacations when I was growing up, so I had to travel in my imagination through what I read. But that allowed me even greater freedom—I could go back in time, forward into the future, and everything in between. This skill led me to research and write my books today and have a career as an award-winning author and editor. History, to me, is only one side of the story—what about all the people in the past who never had the chance to speak? Alternate history is a way to explore the voices we’ve never heard except through a writer’s imagination.\n\nAlison's book list on reimagine the past and see a strange new future\n\nWhy did Alison love this book?\n\nI’ve long been inspired by Butler’s writing, which features BIPOC characters front and center. As a multiracial person, I seldom saw people who looked and thought like me in the older fiction I read.\n\nThe notable thing about this book is that it’s technically science fiction, not alternate history, since the novel's beginning in 2024 (this year!). However, much of what Butler wrote has come to pass, raising one question: Has her vision of the future become an alternate version of the past? I love trying to wrap my head around that conundrum.\n\nBy Octavia E. Butler,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n26 authors picked Parable of the Sower as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe extraordinary, prescient NEW YORK TIMES-bestselling novel.\n\n'If there is one thing scarier than a dystopian novel about the future, it's one written in the past that has already begun to come true. This is what makes Parable of the Sower even more impressive than it was when first published' GLORIA STEINEM\n\n'Unnervingly prescient and wise' YAA GYASI\n\n--\n\nWe are coming apart.

I have been interested in this subject for as long as I can remember and, as far as I can tell, gravitated towards it naturally, probably due to those unknown vectors within us all that gear us towards our loves, interests, and passions. I have written many novels in this field, and countless short stories, some published, others lying around my house. For me, this genre defines the best aspects of the imagination and is full of color, fantasy, and the entire broad spectrum of human emotions, including the most potent: fear.\n\nRandy's book list on horror that challenges beliefs and imagination\n\nWhy did Randy love this book?\n\nPerhaps the most classic work of horror fiction in both literature and cinema. As an English teacher, I find that there is so much fodder for lessons prevalent in this book–nature vs nurture, the dangers of forbidden knowledge and playing God, the arrogance of science, and who the real monster is. I particularly love the difference between The Monster in the novel and the film, its articulation, desires, abilities, and even its physical appearance. Few written works have been more seminal.\n\nBy Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n43 authors picked Frankenstein as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOne of the BBC's '100 Novels That Shaped Our World'\n\n'That rare story to pass from literature into myth' The New York Times\n\nMary Shelley's chilling Gothic tale was conceived when she was only eighteen, living with her lover Percy Shelley on Lake Geneva. The story of Victor Frankenstein who, obsessed with creating life itself, plunders graveyards for the material to fashion a new being, but whose botched creature sets out to destroy his maker, would become the world's most famous work of horror fiction, and remains a devastating exploration of the limits of human creativity. Based on the third…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Forever War\n\nBy Joe Haldeman,\n\nFrom my list on real-life time machines through sci fi.\n\nBy Jools Cantor Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nScience fiction lets us readers escape into space or travel through time, but I believe it is most effective when grounded in our primal anxieties. Classics like Nineteen Eighty-Four and The Handmaid’s Tale resonate because the dark futures they describe drive us to prevent their prophecy. These stories give us a window into the world that birthed them by crystalizing the authors' fears into a work of fiction. When I read each book on this list, they transported me to the time they were written. En route, they showed how much our world has changed and how much we humans haven’t.\n\nJools' book list on real-life time machines through sci fi\n\nWhy did Jools love this book?\n\nThis book is one of the best military science fiction stories and an excellent anti-war novel. It mixes compelling action and smart science with real frustrations, emotions, and horror as the futility of war is exposed. Haldeman based the story on his own experiences in Vietnam, and the story revolves around a similar soldier who struggles to make sense of the war he is fighting and the home he no longer recognizes.\n\nWhile it’s a great window into the American psyche in 1975, it is best read immediately after Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, which reflects America's rah-rah militarism in 1959. This way, you can read a bunch of action-packed sex and violence while also telling your high-brow friends that you’re “exploring the subtextual divergence in American attitudes toward interventionism in literature through the latter half of the twentieth century” or something like that.\n\nBy Joe Haldeman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n9 authors picked The Forever War as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe monumental Hugo and Nebula award winning SF classic-- Featuring a new introduction by John Scalzi\n\nThe Earth's leaders have drawn a line in the interstellar sand--despite the fact that the fierce alien enemy they would oppose is inscrutable, unconquerable, and very far away. A reluctant conscript drafted into an elite Military unit, Private William Mandella has been propelled through space and time to fight in the distant thousand-year conflict; to perform his duties and do whatever it takes to survive the ordeal and return home. But \"home\" may be even more terrifying than battle, because, thanks to the time…\n\nPreview\n\nSpin\n\nBy Robert Charles Wilson,\n\nFrom my list on first contact sci-fi but with a twist.\n\nBy Trevor Williams Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy parents always encouraged me to explore the world and express myself. I also grew up in a home where the bookshelves were lined with Stephen King novels, encyclopedias, and VHS tapes containing episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. So it came as little surprise that my interests in astronomy, orbital mechanics, and fantastical technology concepts (who doesn't like the idea of a ringworld?) dominated my life. I also love history and the drive for exploring the endless possibilities behind the question \"what if.\" Science fiction is, at its core, about exploring the human condition—this is where you’ll find my writing and the adventures I bring to you.\n\nTrevor's book list on first contact sci-fi but with a twist\n\nWhy did Trevor love this book?\n\nA science fiction novel that has as much focus on fleshed-out character development as the science? Amazing. The plot of this fascinating novel, even more so. Imagine a world where all the stars you see in the night sky suddenly go out. How would you react when you learned the reason for this was a world-spanning barrier which is not only blocking out the starry night but is also vastly increasing the rate at which time passes beyond the barrier—to the point where the sun ages billions of years in a matter of decades.\n\nFrom exploring the implications of this time-bending device to witnessing the world as it copes with this new reality, this is one story that—after reading it decades ago—still holds a fond place in my heart.\n\nBy Robert Charles Wilson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Spin as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAfter witnessing the onset of an astronomical event that has caused the sun to go black and the stars and moon to disappear, Tyler, Jason, and Diane learn that the darkness has been caused by a time-altering, alien-created artificial barrier and that the sun will be extinguished in less than forty years.

I remember this book when it first came out decades ago. First of all, it’s just great entertainment, a great story with rich characters. Then, at the same time, Powers captures the beauty of science and discovery as he immerses the reader in the time after the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA when there was a mad rush to figure out how DNA could encode proteins. Powers captures it all and gets the science right and brings in similarities between the DNA code and music and captures what it’s like working in a lab. How is this possible?\n\nBy Richard Powers,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Gold Bug Variations as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA novel which follows the lives of four scientific researchers as they twist about each other in a double helix of desire, weaving intricately through the themes of music, science, language and love. By the author of \"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\" and \"Prisoner's Dilemma\".\n\nPreview\n\nThe Singing Neanderthals\n\nBy Steven Mithen,\n\nWhy did Dave love this book?\n\nThere are lots of great books about music in human evolution, but this one conjures up such beautiful images and makes such a strong argument that it’s still my favourite.\n\nThe human species is over 230,000 years old, and we’ve probably been using singing as a form of social bonding for that whole time, and previous hominid species probably were as well. The book makes the point really well that singing is something we take for granted, but is really quite a remarkable human evolutionary adaptation.\n\nBy Steven Mithen,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Singing Neanderthals as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe propensity to make music is the most mysterious, wonderful, and neglected feature of humankind: this is where Steven Mithen began, drawing together strands from archaeology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience--and, of course, musicology--to explain why we are so compelled to make and hear music. But music could not be explained without addressing language, and could not be accounted for without understanding the evolution of the human body and mind. Thus Mithen arrived at the wildly ambitious project that unfolds in this book: an exploration of music as a fundamental aspect of the human condition, encoded into the human genome during the…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy We Run\n\nBy Bernd Heinrich,\n\nWhy did Sam love this book?\n\nAmerican marathon legend Bill Rodgers is quoted on the back cover of Why We Run saying, “This is not a how-to book, it’s a why book.”\n\nHe’s right, and Heinrich answers the question of why through a fascinating blend of biology, anthropology, philosophy, and psychology. It’s both a universal inquiry and a personal one: the book gets its narrative thread from Heinrich’s build-up towards competing in a 100km race, through which we are introduced to his experimental training methods and the thinking behind them.\n\nI’ll leave you to find out how the race pans out…\n\nBy Bernd Heinrich,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Why We Run as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“Each new page [is] more spellbinding than the one before—this is surely one of the most interesting books I’ve ever read.”—Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, author of The Hidden Life of Dogs\n\nWhen Bernd Heinrich decided to write a memoir of his ultramarathon running experience he realized that the preparation for the race was as important, if not more so, than the race itself. Considering the physiology and motivation of running from a scientific point of view, he wondered what he could learn from other animals.\n\nIn Why We Run, Heinrich considers the flight endurance of birds, the antelope’s running prowess and…\n\nPreview"
