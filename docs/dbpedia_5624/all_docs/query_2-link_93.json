        "text": "Gloria Gaynor\n\nGloria Gaynor will tell you, âI have more than survived. I have thrived.â Indeed an optimistic message accentuates her new gospel album, Testimony, and itâs delivered with the exhilarating vocals that have become the legendary performerâs trademark. For Testimony, Gaynor partnered with Grammy-winning producers Chris Stevens (TobyMac, Mandisa) and F. Reid Shippen (Jonny Lang, Robert Randolph) to create a roots gospel collection that relies on Gaynorâs own songwriting, a couple of hymns, and a stunning interpretation of Bob Dylanâs âMan of Peace.â Special guests include Yolanda Adams, Jason Crabb, Mike Farris, and MercyMeâs Bart Millard, as well as first-call studio musicians Daru Jones (drums), Drew Ramsey (guitar), Shannon Sanders (keyboards/B3), Jason Webb (piano/keyboards), and Willie Weeks (bass). Latrese Bush, Melinda Doolittle and Jason Eskridge provide dynamic background vocals. As a songwriter, Gaynor considers herself primarily a lyricist and she embraced the collaborative process of setting her words to music. She also appreciated Stevensâ concept of roots gospel, noting, âThat means to me that the roots of the music, and the lyrics, are based in what gospel used to be years ago. I think that the basic thing is that itâs more bluesy.â Yet she is quick to clarify that Testimony is not a sad album, observing, âThereâs enough sadness in the world.â For the first time in a career that stretches back to the 1970s, Gaynor recorded in Nashville. The sessions took place inside one of Music Rowâs most historic buildings, the former RCA Studio A. âThe idea of having all the musicians in the room with me, recording some of these songs, was electrifying â so inspirational,â she says. âWhenever anybody asks me what I think is the main difference between music today and music back in the â70s and â80s, I always say the spontaneous creativity that can only happen between live musicians working in the studio together, inspiring one another.â Gaynor nearly lost everything after falling backwards over a stage monitor at the Beacon Theatre in 1978. Paralyzed from the waist down, she endured spinal surgery and a four-month hospital stay. Thus, it isnât a coincidence that Testimony begins with these lyrics: âThere was a time I was broken / I didnât know which way to turn / I was paralyzedâ¦â Gaynor remembers turning to God to fix the situation. \"I left the hospital pretty certain that He would, not knowing how,â she says. âThe record company had called and said, âIt's over. We're not renewing your contract.â But God had other plans and as we always say in Christianity, âBut God.ââ The label acquired a new president who kept Gaynor on the roster; she cut âI Will Surviveâ while wearing a back brace. The songâs message of resilience and strength resonated across generations, serving as a cornerstone of the disco era. And because the universal appeal of âI Will Surviveâ transcends genres, it continues to be a mantra for multitudes of music fans. Immersed in the temptations of fame and wealth, Gaynor recommitted herself to Christ in 1982 after a night of reckoning with drugs and alcohol. âI literally felt the Holy Spirit grab me by the collar, stand me on my feet, and say, âThatâs enough.â I was visibly shaken. That was a huge turning point for me. It feels like it happened yesterday. I'll never forget it, ever. When God puts his hands on you, you don't forget it,â she recalls. âNow seems like the right time to release this album, only because Godâs timing is perfect,â she adds. âYou have to be persistent about being patient. When youâre doing what you love â what youâre created to do and fulfilling your purpose â patience comes easier because youâre having so much fun. All the other stuff is icing on the cake. I mean, we all love icing! But you need to have a little more patience. Itâs easier to have patience, getting to that part, when the cake is good!â\n\nGloria Gaynorâs tracks\n\nCan't Take My Eyes Off Of You (New Edit Version) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2024-07-12T10:43:19Z\n\nCan't Take My Eyes Off Of You (New Extended Version) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2024-07-12T10:41:47Z\n\nI Will Survive (Garage Mix) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2024-06-17T12:18:48Z\n\nI will survive (Extended Funky Latin House Mix) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2024-05-29T16:34:17Z\n\nI Will Survive (Remastered 2024) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2024-01-09T18:13:38Z\n\nReach Out I'll Be There (Slowed 10 %) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2023-09-12T22:16:32Z\n\nReach Out I'll Be There (Sped Up 20 %) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2023-07-18T20:38:02Z\n\nI Will Survive (Sped Up 10 %) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2023-06-12T20:37:27Z\n\nNever Can Say Goodbye (Sped Up 10 %) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2023-06-06T02:26:40Z\n\nI Will Survive (Re-recorded) by Gloria Gaynor\n\npublished on 2023-04-05T11:37:19Z"
