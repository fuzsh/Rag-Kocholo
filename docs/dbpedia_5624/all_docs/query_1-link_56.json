        "text": "GET A SNEAK PEAK OF THE PERFORMANCE:\n\n—\n\nGloria Gaynor’s legendary career spans the past 40 years never losing momentum. She has achieved global stardom and musical recognition with hit songs in the charts in all five decades. Gloria has channeled her fame and recognition into support for several charities, donating not only her money but also her time and talent. She changed the lyrics to her world-renowned song and leant her time to a corresponding music video used by the Miami Children’s Hospital to raise awareness and funds for their lifesaving efforts. Never one to rest, Gloria recently earned a bachelor’s degree in behavioral sciences to aid in her work with charities and organizations helping at-risk youths and their families.\n\nGloria continues to tirelessly tour the world performing at concerts in the USA, Europe, South America, and beyond each year. She was a presenter at the 2015 GRAMMY Awards® and the headliner at the 2015 “Official GRAMMY® Celebration.” The CCU’s Women in Leadership Conference honored Gloria in early 2015 with their “Celebration of Inspiring Women” Award for her philanthropic and leadership achievements and contributions. On May 16th, 2015 Dowling College presented Gloria with an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Music.\n\nGloria was also honored by the Library of Congress on May 6, 2017 after having her recording of her global anthem, “I Will Survive,” inducted in the library’s collection of recordings with American historical & cultural significance in 2016. She was part of an “In Conversation” with fellow survivor, Robin Roberts from “Good Morning America,” in the Coolidge Theater in Washington, DC. And later that same day, Gloria will delivered a concert to end all concerts in the Thomas Jefferson Building’s Great Hall.\n\nWhen not focusing on her several charitable endeavors, Gloria continues to write and record new music. Her recent work in Nashville with the GRAMMY Award® winning team of Christopher Stevens (TobyMac, Mandisa, Jason Aldean), F. Reid Shippen (Dierks Bentley, Lady Antebellum, Keith Urban), Bryan Fowler, Shannon Sanders, and Drew Ramsey as well as Yolanda Adams, Bart Millard (MercyMe), Mike Farris, and Jason Crabb has delivered her new album, “TESTIMONY.” Her new roots gospel album debuted in the Top 5 of the BILLBOARD Top Gospel Albums Chart, the Top 3 on the iTunes Gospel Chart and the Top 20 on the Amazon Overall Album Chart. The album has received rave reviews from Rolling Stone, Billboard, The Herald-Standard, CBS Sunday Morning, The TODAY Show and more! “TESTIMONY,” also received two GRAMMY® nominations for Best Roots Gospel Album and for Best Gospel Performance / Song for Gloria’s duet with Yolanda Adams on the song, “Talkin’ ‘Bout Jesus.” And Gloria took home the Best Roots Gospel GRAMMY® at the 2020 Award Ceremony. Gloria also headlined the 2020 GRAMMY® Celebration."
