        "text": "Faith: Christian\n\nCareer: Musician\n\nBirthday: September 07, 1943\n\nGloria Gaynor is a singer best known for her hits \"I Will Survive,” \"I Am What I Am,\" and her version of \"Never Can Say Goodbye.\" Gaynor grew up in New Jersey, saying music was always a part of her life. In her autobiography, Gaynor wrote, \"All through my young life, I wanted to sing, although nobody in my family knew it.\" However, she started singing in local nightclubs around Newark before signing with Columbia Records in 1971.\n\nIs Gloria Gaynor religious?\n\nGloria Gaynor became a Christian in 1982 after researching a variety of religious movements and faiths. She said she wanted to distance herself from her past, which she considered sinful. Gaynor told The Christian Post why being a follower of Christ is essential to her, saying, \"To be a member of the body of Christ is just so wonderful, so much more wonderful than most people even can begin to understand — the love, the mercy, the grace, the joy, the peace, the guidance, the wisdom, the knowledge, the understanding, the discernment that He is constantly offering to us is priceless, absolutely priceless!\"\n\nBack to the Celebrity Faith Database"
