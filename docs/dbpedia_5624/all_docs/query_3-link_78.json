        "text": "Queen of Disco, Gloria Gaynor, will hit the high notes of her famous gay anthem “I Will Survive” when she joins Crystal Serenity on a sailing from Quebec City to Fort Lauderdale on October 26.\n\nAnd she will not be alone. Many guests will be able to belt out the words of her timeless hit number “Never Can Say Goodbye” – the 1974 smash hit version of Jackson 5.\n\nWhy Gloria Gaynor is hot\n\nThe iconic American singer will resonate well with Crystal’s guests, many of whom are likely to be die-hard disco lovers. They will relish dancing to her many 70’s hit songs.\n\nGaynor’s “I Will Survive” became a gay anthem for its powerful message of perseverance and resilience.\n\n“I am overjoyed to join Crystal Serenity for what promises to be an unforgettable voyage,” said Gaynor. “Music has the power to bring people together and I am honoured to share my passion with the discerning guests of Crystal.”\n\nGaynor’s impressive career spans more than four decades. She will be accompanied by her 10-piece band.\n\n“Gaynor’s legendary status and unparalleled talent perfectly align with the calibre of entertainment that Crystal is known for,” said Keith Cox, the line’s Vice President of Entertainment.\n\nGaynor to host Q&A\n\nBesides her electrifying performance, Gaynor will also participate in an intimate Q&A session with booked guests.\n\nThe 14-night sailing will cruise down the East Coast of North America with overnight stays in Boston and New York City. There will also be stops in Nassau before ending in Fort Lauderdale."
