        "text": "Disco legend Gloria Gaynor has held onto this 1988-built New Jersey home for over two decades. But recently, she’s been looking to move on. Gaynor first tried to find a buyer for it in 2019, to no avail. This time asking $1.249 million and riding the current real estate wave, the singer most famous for her ‘I Will Survive’ 1978 anthem must be hoping this listing doesn’t survive on the market long.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Gaynor purchased the Green Brook, NJ house in 1999 from the architect who designed it, Jeffery Beer. The singer shared with the publication that she has hosted many memorable parties at the property, even building a stage in front of the pool for glamorous dancing. Now struggling to navigate its two levels, Gaynor is selling her longtime home as she builds a new residence in Edgewood.\n\nWith a pool, home theater, and family room with a wet bar, the house she’s leaving behind is all set for entertaining. It has a great flow out to the patio and a vast green lawn perfect for summer parties.\n\nInside, the home spans 5,318 square feet and has five bedrooms. The main suite is disco icon-approved and charming with a bright solarium poised for moments of tranquility."
