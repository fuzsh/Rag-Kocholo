        "text": "Camelia La Texana is the brand new Telemundo telenovela produced by Argos Television. Camelia revolves around a young and innocent woman that tries to run away from her destiny. The story starts in the 1970s when Camelia and her mom run away from one of the most prominent capos in Mexico. When Camelia finds love, she realizes that this man is after her and will bring her back to that world that her mom wanted to protect her from. Camelia La Tejana, was a trafficker in marijuana between Tijuana and Los Angeles, and a murderer for love. Camelia sounds like it could be a real-life story, but it is completely fiction based on the hit classic song (Ballad)”Contrabando y Traición” Which is translated to Smuggling and Betrayal by the legendary “Los Tigres Del Norte.\n\nThe corrido is a popular narrative song and poetry form, a ballad. The songs are often about oppression, history, the daily life of peasants, and other socially important information. Various themes are featured in Mexican corridos. Corrido lyrics often feature old legends and ballads about a famed criminals. At some points, it mentions heros in the rural frontier areas of Mexico. As well as, corridos that feature women and couples.\n\nHowever, a woman by the name of Agustina Ramirez claims that Camelia was inspired by life experiences. She claims that her nickname of Camelia came to distinguish herself amongst the narcos and Texana because she wore a Texana sombrero. Ramirez said that at one point she had 27 men at her disposition that were frightened by her. Agustina says she was raped at the age of 6, which made her turn on men thinking that they were not worth it.The love story between her and Emilio Varela was made up by the songwriter as Ramirez says that a man like Varela never existed in her life. She believes that the corrido (Ballad) was written after she went on to a radio station in 1977 to tell her life story and inspired the song writer.\n\nMoving on, the real story behind the actor Emilio Varela. Erik Hayser is originally from Santiago de Queretar, Queretaro. He was born on the 13th of december 1980. Erik is an actor and a movie producer. Erik is also a Mexican Business man.
