We closed the past year on a very successful note with the graduation of the Class of 2006 and we look forward for the same level of success for the Class of 2007. The summer months found our campus to be a busy place. With summer school and all of the normal camps we will also have an extra important event: Ground Breaking on July 8th. This initiates the start of construction for the first part of our master plan for completing our campus. We are excited! During the course of the summer many of our seniors will participate in the Kairos retreat program. Last year, over 80% of the class made a Kairos retreat. What a huge undertaking! Also, Classes of 1996 and 2001 will have their class reunions – welcome back! Our new school year begins with very important student orientation days on August 28 through the 31st. Of course, by these dates all of the fall activities and sports will be fully involved in their programs and seasons. We wish only success for our young men and women in the Band, Cheerleading, Color Guard, Dance, Football, Cross Country, Boys’ Water Polo, Girls’ Tennis, Golf, and Girls’ Volleyball teams. We will have a fall sports rally on September 11th for Spirit Week as a show of support. We also congratulate all those involved in the 2006 spring sports successes: Boys’ Golf – Serra League and CIF champions; Boys’ and Girls’ Swimming – Serra League champs with the Girls as CIF runner-ups; Girls’ Track – Serra League champions; Boys’ Volleyball – Serra League champs. Not too far off in the future, Back-to-<strong>School</strong> Night is scheduled for the 27th of September. This evening is one very important event; one that you do not want to miss. You will have the opportunity to meet your son or daughter’s teachers, learn from them about the content and requirements of their courses, and have the chance to sample high school life, again. The Opening Mass for the new school year will be celebrated on September 7. During this liturgy we, as a school community, will pray for a successful school year and give thanks for the many blessings bestowed upon our school. Parents are most welcome to join in the celebration. The maintenance department has been very busy cleaning, repairing, moving, and, in general, sprucing up our beautiful campus. These staff members, often invisible, are the unseen heroes who make our facilities comfortable and student friendly. The administrative staff and counselors have worked diligently in preparing for a smooth start for the school year. To all, we gladly say “Thank You!” Among the faculty and staff, a few will be moving on to new opportunities. We wish each a fond farewell and best wishes. They are Laura Bonnecaze, Maria Espino, Rev. Mr. James Lane, Rita Leiter, Colleen Livingston, Paige Prescott, and Dave Weinberg. Our fondest desire is that all of you find your experiences this year at SMCHS to be positive and successful and that your expectations placed on your student son or daughter are realized. The faculty and staff of SMCHS will do all in their power to provide the best educational environment possible and provide a reasonable challenge to all of our youngsters in order to help them achieve to their ability. Working together is always the ingredient for success. Sincerely in Christ, Brother Lawrence Monroe Principal SANTA MARGARITA CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL www.smhs.org"
