Lord Marland was honoured to call upon H.E. Dr William Samoui Ruto, CGH, President of the Republic of Kenya when he visited Nairobi, ahead of the launch of the East and Central Africa Hub.

Lord Marland was accompanied by H.E. Musalia Mudavadi, Prime Cabinet Secretary of the Republic of Kenya and Dr James Mwangi CBS, MD and Group CEO of Equity Group Holdings. The visit focused on how the new hub will contribute to increased intra-Commonwealth trade by acting as a gateway for foreign investors and businesses to establish themselves in the EAC region, and for local enterprises to benefit from CWEICâ€™s global network.
