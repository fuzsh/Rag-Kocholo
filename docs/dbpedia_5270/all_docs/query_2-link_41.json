        "text": "This is a place where you climb higher. Grow bolder. Make connections. A whole community dedicated to helping you explore who you're meant to be. Come here to challenge yourself, open doors to professional opportunities, and find a niche where what you love meets what you do.\n\nYour journey begins with the McDaniel Commitment. It's our guarantee that you'll be on a path to success from the moment you set foot on campus. Through the Commitment, you'll have access to a team of mentors who will help you develop a completely tailored and personalized experience.\n\nIt comes together with a Plan. After you commit, you begin building your McDaniel Plan: the foundation of your education, which gives you the power to learn what you want and how you want, with countless ways to customize your experience.\n\nIn every department, you'll find options for participating in student-faculty research collaborations. Each year, students work with professors on over 300 research projects; they often have their names listed as co-authors on journal articles and present work at national and international conferences. Gaining serious research credibility as an undergraduate? That's the kind of thing that happens on the Hill.\n\nEverything you do on the Hill has one ultimate aim; to prepare you for success. That's why most McDaniel students complete at least one internship during their time on the Hill. Through the Center for Experience and Opportunity and our internship fairs, you'll find opportunities that relate directly to your field of study or future vocation. More than part-time jobs, internships apply what you've learned in the classroom to the working world. You'll network with professionals who are employed in your field of interest, and get a preview of what your future career is really like."
