Maryland law establishes a hierarchy that determines the order of inheritance and the corresponding percentage of the decedent's estate that each “heir” (eligible person) is entitled to receive.\n\nRead the law: Md. Code, Estates and Trusts, § 3–101\n\nEven if a decedent dies with a will, individuals who would have been that decedent’s heirs under Maryland intestacy law have the right to be informed of any activities in the estate, including distributions. This provides for the opportunity to raise legitimate objections and concerns. Examples of legitimate objections and concerns include challenging a fraudulent or invalid will and seeking to remove a personal representative who failed to meet their duties.\n\nWithout a valid will, the personal representative must distribute the property according to Maryland intestacy law. While the personal representative is not automatically entitled to any portion of the decedent’s property, they are entitled to reasonable compensation. However, if the personal representative administers a small estate, they are not entitled to compensation for their work.\n\nRead the law: Md. Code, Estates and Trusts, § 7–601 and 5–604\n\nNote that Registered Domestic Partner are equivalent to spouses for intestacy purposes. Learn more about inheritance for Registered Domestic Partnerships.\n\nOverview of Maryland Intestacy Law:\n\nIf the decedent has children but no spouse:\n\n​Children inherit everything.
