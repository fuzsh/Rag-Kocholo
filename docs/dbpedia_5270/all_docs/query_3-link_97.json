        "text": "William Donald Schaefer, a political showman who captivated voters and infuriated critics for more than three decades as the mayor who rejuvenated decaying Baltimore and then as Maryland’s governor and comptroller, died on Monday at a retirement home in Catonsville, Md. He was 89.\n\nA former aide, Lainy LeBow-Sachs, confirmed the death, The Associated Press reported.\n\nNew York had its Fiorello H. La Guardia. Chicago had its Daleys. And Baltimore had William Donald Schaefer: the name on park benches, garbage trucks, office buildings, construction sites, horse races at Pimlico — and on the psyche of Baltimoreans in the 1970s and ’80s. It was a kind of anticlimax when he became governor: they called him the mayor of Maryland.\n\nMr. Schaefer, a Democrat who steamrolled his opponents with up to 94 percent of the ballots, had one of the longest runs in American politics. After 16 years as a city councilman, he won four terms as mayor, from 1971 to 1987; two terms as governor, from 1987 to 1995; and two terms as state comptroller, from 1999 to 2007. His defeat in a 2006 bid for re-election was his first in more than a half-century.\n\n“Bawlamer,” as natives call it, was a seedy, shot-and-beer factory town when he became mayor. There had been riots in the late 1960s, and residents and businesses were leaving. Its 18th-century core was a shambles of rotting piers and dilapidated warehouses. Gritty row houses and run-down tenements lined the inner city streets. Neighborhoods ached with poverty, unemployment, drugs and crime.\n\nHe demolished and rebuilt whole neighborhoods. He had city crews salvage the lintels, fireplaces and marble from derelict buildings and sold them for restoration money. He pushed summer festivals and community theaters. He jawboned professional sports teams to stay put, or come to town. He drove around at night looking for potholes, trash, troublemakers and drug pushers, and got things done.\n\nBy the end of his tenure at City Hall, Mr. Schaefer was being hailed for transforming what was once the United States’ eighth-largest city into a model of urban renaissance and national tourism. There were new businesses, parks, auditoriums, expressways and transit lines, a new skyline of hotels and office towers, a new convention center and a 28-story pentagonal World Trade Center designed by I. M. Pei.\n\nThe centerpiece was Mr. Schaefer’s signature Harborplace, a glass waterfront pavilion of restaurants and shops by James Rouse, the developer of New York’s South Street Seaport and Boston’s Faneuil Hall Marketplace. It had cobblestone walks, a National Aquarium and, on the water, sailboats, a historic frigate, a vintage submarine and a Chesapeake Bay skipjack. It had 18 million visitors its first year, 1980-81.\n\nThe transformation was hardly complete. The city’s economy and image improved, but critics said that the lives of many citizens had not, that schools had declined, and that poverty, crime, unemployment and drugs had not been subdued. The mayor was widely denigrated as a bully who favored business and promoted himself with clownish gimmicks. (When the aquarium was not finished on time, he jumped as promised into the seal pool wearing a striped Victorian swimsuit and clutching a rubber ducky.)\n\nBut defenders insisted his improvements were substantive and had brought a much-needed sense of pride. When he became governor in 1987, The Baltimore Sun editorialized that Mr. Schaefer had “changed the way the city felt about itself.”\n\nWilliam Donald Schaefer was born in Baltimore on Nov. 2, 1921, the son of William Henry and Tululu Irene Skipper Schaefer. He attended public schools and graduated from Baltimore City College in 1939 and the University of Baltimore Law School in 1942. He joined the Army in World War II, became an officer and supervised hospitals in England and Europe.\n\nAfter two unsuccessful races in the early 1950s, Mr. Schaefer finally won a seat on the City Council in 1955, and he became known as a tireless civic leader as he worked his way up to the council presidency. In a city of 900,000, where blacks were half the population and Democrats outnumbered Republicans 5 to 1, he easily won the mayoral election in 1971, and was soon embarked on his mission to resurrect Baltimore.\n\nHis re-election totals (“Vote for Baltimore”) in 1975, 1979 and 1983 all exceeded 85 percent. He won the governorship in 1986 with 82 percent of the vote, the biggest landslide ever in a contested statewide race in Maryland, and was re-elected in 1990 with 60 percent. In politics, he used all three of his names, and they were up everywhere, including Pimlico Race Course, where the annual William Donald Schaefer Handicap was inaugurated in 1994.\n\nAs governor, he overhauled the state’s legal code and was credited with improving education, social programs, transportation and efforts to clean up pollution in Chesapeake Bay. He saw the completion of the publicly financed Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 1992, a project he had pushed as mayor. But he also ignited controversy by commuting the sentences of eight battered women who killed or assaulted their mates, and suggesting that contraceptives be given to women on welfare and vasectomies to men leaving prison.\n\nLimited to two terms as governor, he joined a Baltimore law firm and held a chair named for him at the University of Maryland. In 1998, after three years out of politics, he won the comptroller’s job. His two terms as chief financial officer were relatively unremarkable. But he was in the news for feuding with Gov. Parris N. Glendening, a fellow Democrat, and for criticizing immigrants who could not speak English, saying AIDS victims “brought it on themselves,” and ostentatiously ogling a woman at a public meeting.\n\n“William Donald Schaefer: A Political Biography,” by C. Fraser Smith, was published in 1999.\n\nWhen he lost his re-election bid in 2006, Mr. Schaefer was asked how he would like to be remembered. “There are two words,” he said. “ ‘He cared.’ People mock me and make fun of it. But it’s the truth.”"
