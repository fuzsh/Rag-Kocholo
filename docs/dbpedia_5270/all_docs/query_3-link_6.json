        "text": "Updated January 2022\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nNames: The Bloomberg School and Johns Hopkins University\n\nStyle and punctuation\n\nScientific names and terms\n\nA to Z list of commonly used words\n\nPlural forms of some commonly used words\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs communicators, we make a range of decisions as we work to create clear, engaging content. Some of these decisions are constrained by rules about grammar and punctuation. Others—which spelling to use, whether to use acronyms or capitalize certain terms—are a matter of style. This guide aims to clarify our style choices in order to ensure consistency among all publications, print and digital, across the Bloomberg School.\n\nThese guidelines draw from current editions of the AP Stylebook and from guidelines compiled by editors in the Office of Communications at Johns Hopkins University. For topics not listed below, please consult the most recent AP guidelines. For points not addressed by AP, consult Webster’s New World College Dictionary.\n\nIf you require access to the AP Stylebook for your work at the Bloomberg School, have questions about topics not addressed here, or have a suggestion about clearer usage, please contact Melissa Hartman at mhartman@jhu.edu.\n\nBack to Contents\n\nNames: The Bloomberg School and Johns Hopkins University\n\nTHE BLOOMBERG SCHOOL\n\nIn first reference in running copy, use the School’s official name: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. For second references, internal publications, or informal usage, use the Bloomberg School or the School.\n\nEffective January 2022, the School’s official acronym is BSPH, which may be used in captions and graphics. In running text, spell out the School’s name.\n\nADDRESS OF THE SCHOOL\n\nNote that “North” is abbreviated and “Street” is spelled out:\n\n615 N. Wolfe Street, W1600\n\nBaltimore, MD 21205\n\nThe building at this address is called the Wolfe Street Building.\n\nSCHOOL’S VISION\n\nHere is the proper style for the School’s vision in stand-alone form (not part of a sentence):\n\nProtecting Health, Saving Lives—Millions at a Time\n\nWhen using the vision in running copy (part of a sentence), lowercase all words.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is dedicated to protecting health and saving lives—millions at a time.\n\nNote that “millions at a time” is separated from the rest of the sentence by an em dash with no spaces before or after, and is always italicized.\n\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY/THE JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL\n\nFrom the JHU Style Guide: The preferred shortened name for Johns Hopkins University is Johns Hopkins, not Hopkins.\n\nCapitalize “The” only when the name stands alone, as in a program or invitation. In running copy, do not capitalize “the”; either lowercase it or leave it out.\n\nRonald J. Daniels is president of the Johns Hopkins University (or of Johns Hopkins University).\n\nNAMES OF DIVISIONS\n\nExcept for the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the names of all the University’s divisions are preceded by Johns Hopkins University, e.g., the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the Johns Hopkins University Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. As a shortened form, it is correct to leave out University in this usage: Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. University is always omitted with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nJohns Hopkins University comprises nine degree-granting, or academic, divisions and the Applied Physics Laboratory. See the JHU Style Guide for a list of formal names of all divisions and acceptable shortened forms.\n\nNote that we deviate from the JHU Style Guide on this point: We capitalize University, School, Hospital, and Department, if these are used as shortened forms of the Johns Hopkins University, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Department of International Health, etc.\n\nBack to Contents\n\nStyle and punctuation\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nIn general, do not use periods in abbreviations.\n\nExceptions:\n\nthe U.S. government\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\na.m. and p.m.\n\na.k.a., when used for also known as\n\ne.g., (no italics, followed by a comma)\n\ni.e., (no italics, followed by a comma)\n\nState names\n\nIn running text, spell out state names. When publishing an entire address that includes a zip code, use the two-letter postal abbreviation for states, in all-caps. (Example: Baltimore, MD 21205.)\n\nUnited States, U.S.\n\nDo not spell out United States, ever. Use U.S.\n\nACADEMIC DEGREES\n\nOrder of degrees\n\nThe Bloomberg School’s standard for order of degrees after a person’s name is as follows: Medical degree, doctoral degree(s), MPH or equivalent, JD, other master’s degree(s)\n\nExample:\n\nMD, PhD/DrPH/ScD, MPH, JD, MS/ScM/MA/MBA\n\nCommas and abbreviations of degrees\n\nWhen they follow a person’s name, qualifiers such as PhD and MD are preceded by a comma. A second comma follows the qualifier in running copy.\n\nJohn Smith, MD, DrPH ’11, addressed the group.\n\nNote: Include dates for Bloomberg School degrees only, not for SOM, SON, JHU, etc.\n\nBachelor’s degree\n\nBA, BS, BSc\n\nCapitalize the formal names of degrees. Note the use of the apostrophe in the informal name of the degree:\n\na Bachelor of Arts in philosophy\n\na Bachelor of Science in biochemistry\n\na bachelor’s degree in nursing\n\nI have a bachelor’s degree.\n\nMultiple Bachelor of Arts degrees\n\nUse the plural form as follows. Note that it is degree, not Bachelor or bachelor’s, that is made plural.\n\nI have Bachelor of Arts degrees in English and history.\n\nI have bachelor’s degrees in English and history.\n\nThe college now offers bachelor’s programs in sustainability and ecological economics.\n\nMaster’s degree\n\nMA, MBE, MHA, MHS, MPH, MS, MSPH, ScM\n\nCapitalize the formal names of degrees. Note the use of the apostrophe in the informal name of the degree:\n\na Master of Arts in philosophy\n\na Master of Science degree in biochemistry\n\na master’s degree in nursing\n\nI have a master’s degree.\n\nMultiple Master of Arts (or Master of Science) degrees\n\nUse the plural form as follows. Note that it is degree, not Master or master’s, that is made plural.\n\nI have Master of Arts degrees in English and history.\n\nI have master’s degrees in English and history.\n\nThe School offers master’s programs in public health, health science, and health administration.\n\nDoctoral degree or doctorate\n\nPhD, ScD, DrPH\n\nDoctoral: adjective\n\na doctoral degree in biochemistry\n\nGraduate students pursuing doctoral study should …\n\nDoctorate: noun\n\nHe earned his doctorate in English literature.\n\nMultiple doctoral degrees\n\nUse the plural form as follows:\n\nI have doctoral degrees in microbiology and immunology.\n\nI have doctorates in microbiology and immunology.\n\nACRONYMS\n\nPer JHU style: Do not follow an organization’s full name with an acronym in parentheses. Using the acronym soon after the full name will usually make the connection clear. For example: Use massive open online course on first reference and MOOC shortly thereafter. An alternative is to use or: The School of Public Health offers a variety of massive open online courses, or MOOCs.\n\nException:\n\nIf the connection between the acronym and the full name is not immediately clear, we may follow the full name with an acronym in parentheses:\n\nSex Workers Promoting Action, Risk Reduction, and Community Mobilization (SPARC)\n\nAcronyms that we use regularly at the School do not need to be spelled out, even in a first mention. These include:\n\nAIDS\n\nCDC\n\nNIH\n\nUN\n\nUNICEF\n\nUSAID\n\nWHO\n\nPlural form of acronyms\n\nFor acronyms, add s (or es) to form the plural. Only acronyms ending in the letter s take an apostrophe.\n\nHMOs\n\nSOS’s\n\nADDICTION\n\nAddiction is a chronic, treatable health condition. Substance use disorder is a form of addiction, as are opioid use disorder and methamphetamine use disorder. People with addictions should never be referred to as “addicts,” “drug abusers,” or “substance abusers.”\n\nSee also Inclusive Language.\n\nAGES\n\nUse figures for people’s ages.\n\nShe is 7 years old.\n\nHe is a 9-year-old child.\n\nAvoid using “aged” to describe someone. Use “age” or “ages,” as follows:\n\nGlobally, youth ages 15 to 24 make up half of the world’s population.\n\nPreschool-age and school-age children suffer most from poor nutrition.\n\nALUMNI, GRADUATION YEARS OF\n\nWhen including the graduation years of alumni, place commas after the person’s name and after the year. A closing apostrophe (’), not an opening apostrophe (‘), appears in front of the date.\n\nJane Smith, MPH ’75, associate professor, Epidemiology, said ...\n\nJohn Smith, PhD ’75, MPH ’72, ...\n\nNote: Include dates for Bloomberg School degrees only, not for SOM, SON, JHU, etc.\n\nAMERICA, AMERICAN\n\nTo avoid discriminatory language, use North America and North American, not American and America.\n\nAMPERSAND (&)\n\nUse this symbol only if it is part of an official title or company name (e.g., Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); otherwise, spell out the word and.\n\nAPOSTROPHES\n\nTo indicate possession\n\nPer JHU and AP Stylebook, omit the possessive s when following a sibilant in a proper noun.\n\nExamples:\n\nDickens’ novels\n\nLaos’ health care infrastructure\n\nCongress’ resolution\n\nBill Gates’ funding\n\nJohns Hopkins’ influence on Maryland’s economy...\n\nBACTERIUM, BACTERIA\n\nWhen referring to a particular bacterium or bacteria, the genus name is italicized and initial-capped, and the species name is italicized (but not capitalized), as follows:\n\nChlamydia trachomatis (the bacterium that causes chlamydia)\n\nVibrio cholerae (the bacterium that causes cholera)\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacterium that causes tuberculosis)\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi (the bacterium that causes Lyme disease)\n\nIn second references, abridge as follows:\n\nC. trachomatis\n\nV. cholerae\n\nM. tuberculosis\n\nB. burgdorferi\n\nBALTIMORE, BALTIMORE CITY\n\nIt usually suffices to refer to the city simply as Baltimore. When Baltimore City must be used to refer to the city government, City should be capitalized.\n\nBIANNUALLY, BIMONTHLY, BIWEEKLY\n\nThese terms have come to mean either twice a year, month or week; or every other year, month, week. To avoid confusion, use either twice a or every other.\n\nBLOOMBERG AMERICAN HEALTH INITIATIVE\n\nSpell out on first reference; use the Initiative on second reference. Do not abbreviate as BAHI.\n\nBLOOMBERG DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR\n\nSpell out on first reference; BDP is acceptable on second reference.\n\nBOMBAY (INDIA)\n\nUnless referring to the name of a specific organization, use Mumbai instead of Bombay.\n\nBURMA\n\nWherever possible, use refer to this nation as Burma (Myanmar). If we must, as in the case of recognizing a funding source, we will consider using the name Myanmar.\n\nCAPITALIZATION\n\nCampuses\n\nIn most cases, do not capitalize campus.\n\nthe Homewood campus\n\nthe East Baltimore campus\n\nDepartment names\n\nCapitalize names of departments and offices even when the terms are reversed.\n\nDepartment of Health Policy and Management\n\nOffice of Student Affairs, Student Affairs Office\n\nDo not capitalize department when it is preceded or followed by two or more proper nouns.\n\nthe departments of French and English\n\nthe Computer Science and Cognitive Science departments\n\nNote: This rule applies generally, e.g., Harvard and Princeton universities, Wolman and McCoy halls, the Harvey and Nelson buildings\n\nAcademic disciplines\n\nUse lowercase when the discipline, not the department, is intended:\n\nJohn Smith is studying epidemiology and international health.\n\nNamed professorships\n\nCapitalize named professorships both preceding and following a name, whether the name of the holder is attached or the full or abbreviated form is used.\n\nXiaobin Wang, MD, ScD ’91, MPH, Zanvyl Krieger Professor of Children’s Health\n\nthe Zanvyl Krieger Professor of Children’s Health\n\nthe Zanvyl Krieger Professorship in Children’s Health\n\nthe Krieger Professor of Children’s Health\n\nFor a complete list of named professorships and chairs, consult the University’s official directory.\n\nCAPTIONS\n\nIdentify people in photos using the following guidelines: If the photo shows only a few people, insert (left), (center), (right) into the sentence, using parentheses. If many people, use (from left) or (front row, from left), thereby establishing the direction for subsequent rows.\n\nCOLONS\n\nCapitalization after a colon\n\nCapitalize the first letter after a colon only if the clause it begins forms a complete sentence.\n\nException\n\nWhere colons fall within titles of papers, articles, chapters, and books, the first word after a colon will always be capitalized. Colons will usually go outside of quotation marks.\n\nThe lecture’s title was “Whither Neurology: A worthwhile question?”\n\nSpace after a colon\n\nColons are followed by only a single space.\n\nTo introduce a list\n\nWhen an independent clause introduces a list, use a colon. Otherwise, no colon is needed.\n\nThe following people attended the conference: Jane Smith, Mary White, and Marsha Green.\n\nConference attendees included Jane Smith, Mary White, and Marsha Green.\n\nCOMMAS\n\nPer JHU style: Use a serial comma (i.e., before and, but, and or in a series): the schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health. If a serial comma does not appear in a proper name (as in Department of Family, Population and Reproductive Health), do not add it.\n\nWith Jr., Sr., III\n\nDo not use a comma before Jr., Sr., and III in people’s names, or before Inc., Ltd., and so forth, unless specified by the company.\n\nWilliam E. Snow Jr. is the treasurer of the university.\n\nStuart S. Janney III is a member of the board of trustees.\n\nGladco Inc. has gone under.\n\nWith quotation marks\n\nCommas go inside both single and double quotation marks.\n\nDASHES\n\nEm dash\n\nEm dashes (—) are used when indicating an abrupt change in thought, or where a period is too strong and a comma is too weak. Em dashes are also used for attribution following a quotation:\n\n“We begin with discovery. Then we change the world.” —Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD\n\nWe deviate from AP on this point: Do not put a space on either side of the em dash.\n\nThe gift—$100 million—came from an anonymous donor.\n\nEn dash\n\nWe deviate from AP, which does not use en dashes.\n\nThe en dash (–) is longer than a hyphen (-) but shorter than an em dash (—). It, and not the hyphen, is used as a substitute for the word to in ranges of numbers and years.\n\nThere were 100–125 students in the program.\n\nThe chapter is on pages 65–67.\n\n1994–96\n\n8 a.m.–5 p.m.\n\n7–10 p.m.\n\nWhen a noun phrase is part of a compound modifier, use an en dash, as follows.\n\nThe Gates Institute–funded scholar ...\n\nThe Baltimore City Health Department–initiated program …\n\nLasker Prize–winner Alfred Sommer\n\nDATA\n\nPer JHU style: When the word data refers to separate elements, use plural verbs and pronouns:\n\nData have been collected from many countries.\n\nWhen the word functions as a collective noun, use singular verbs and pronouns:\n\nThe data you collected is helpful in this project.\n\nDAYS, DATES, TIMES\n\nCenturies\n\nUse numerals, according to AP style: spell out first through ninth and use figures for 10th and over.\n\nThose rollerblades are straight out of the 20th century.\n\nThe display included artifacts from the seventh century.\n\nHyphenate when century is used in a compound adjective.\n\nHe has a weakness for 19th-century poetry.\n\nDecades\n\nUse the numeric form without an apostrophe.\n\nHe grew up in the postwar 1950s.\n\nUse an apostrophe before the decade when eliminating the century.\n\nMy grandmother loved the ’50s.\n\nMonth-Day-Year citations\n\nThe year should be set off by commas. (Note the comma following the year.)\n\nThe January 24, 2022, press release is in your mailbox.\n\nMonth-Year citations\n\nWhen referring to a month and year but not a specific day, do not use commas.\n\nThe January 2022 press release is in your inbox.\n\nDate-day-time\n\nUse the day-date-time sequence for events. Spell out the names of days and months.\n\nThe committee will meet Monday, September 23, at 3 p.m. (Note: not 3:00 and not 23rd)\n\nHours and minutes\n\nUse a colon to separate the hour from the minutes. The colon and minutes are not necessary for even-hour times.\n\n11 a.m.\n\n3:30 p.m., 5:30–8:30 p.m.\n\nfrom 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. (NOT from 5:30–8:30 p.m. If you use “from,” you must also use “to,” not a dash.)\n\nEST, EDT\n\nThe abbreviations for Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Daylight Time should be in all caps without periods and should not be preceded by a comma.\n\n3 p.m. EST\n\nDEVELOPED, DEVELOPING NATIONS\n\nAcceptable terms:\n\ndeveloped\n\ndeveloping\n\nlow- and middle-income countries (may be abbreviated as LMICs on second reference)\n\nindustrialized\n\nresource-limited\n\nresource-poor\n\nDo not use:\n\nFirst world\n\nThird world\n\nDISEASES\n\nAs a rule of thumb, diseases are neither capitalized nor italicized. However, in the case of diseases that contain a proper noun, that noun is capitalized.\n\nsyphilis\n\ncholera\n\ndengue fever\n\nmalaria\n\nWest Nile virus\n\nLyme disease\n\nE-CIGARETTES, HEATED TOBACCO PRODUCTS\n\nAcceptable terms:\n\ne-cigarette(s)\n\nelectronic cigarette(s)\n\nheated tobacco product(s)\n\nHTP(s)\n\ne-cigarette liquid(s)\n\nDo not use:\n\nheat-not-burn product(s)\n\nadditional adjectives (particularly those such as “novel”, “emerging,” and “alternative”)\n\ne-liquid (or “juice”)\n\nWhen referring to multiple non-combustible or smokeless tobacco products (such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and nicotine products) as a single group, use non-combustible nicotine and tobacco products.\n\nWhen referring to an even wider variety of product types (including combustible and non-combustible products both), use nicotine and tobacco products.\n\nEARTH\n\nJust as we capitalize the names of other planets (Mars, Venus), we capitalize the name of our planet.\n\nNot every person on Earth has access to clean water.\n\nWhen referring to soil or land, we do not capitalize the term.\n\nNo one can be truly happy without a little earth under her fingernails.\n\nELLIPSIS\n\nIn running copy\n\nEllipsis points are separated from text by spaces, with no space between the periods.\n\n“Seeing practicing surgeons reaching out to public health students was … one of the first times I saw that those two worlds could come together,” she said.\n\nIn quotations\n\nDo not use an ellipsis (1) before the first word of a quotation, even if the beginning of the original sentence has been omitted; or (2) after the last word of a quotation, even if the end of the original sentence has been omitted, unless the sentence as quoted is deliberately incomplete.\n\nFEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION\n\nFemale genital mutilation is the preferred term for the School’s publications, as it is for the UN and UN agencies.\n\nDepending on the context, however, we may use the terms female genital cutting or female circumcision: The terms FGM and FGC may be alienating to certain audiences, and we try to exercise sensitivity when publishing articles on this subject.\n\nFRACTIONS\n\nFractions, such as two-thirds, should be spelled out. If paired with a whole number, place a space between the whole number and the fraction: 3 1/2.\n\nHEADLINES AND HEADINGS\n\nCapitalization in headlines\n\nCapitalize major words, e.g., nouns, pronouns, and verbs, as well as prepositions of four or more letters. Always capitalize the first word after a colon.\n\nOff-Campus Housing to Be Expanded\n\nCapitalize only the initial segment if the compound word consists of a stem plus a prefix or suffix.\n\nNon-degree Students Enthusiastic\n\nPost-baccalaureate Unclassified Students Revolt\n\nNumerals in headlines\n\nUse Arabic numbers in headlines, even for numbers 1–9.\n\nPolice Say 6 Stores Robbed\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nTwo words. Notable exceptions:\n\nHBS often uses the spelling healthcare (one word).\n\nWe will preserve the spelling in organization names, e.g., Healthcare Financial Management Association.\n\nHIV\n\nPer AP, use the HIV/AIDS construction carefully. People can be infected with the virus and not have AIDS.\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\nThe term human rights is considered singular, in the same vein as the term politics. Be sure to use appropriate subject-verb agreement.\n\nHuman rights is important in the study of refugee populations.\n\nHuman rights plays a role in public health.\n\nPolitics is a dog-eat-dog business.\n\nHURRICANE\n\nWhen used as a common noun, use lowercase:\n\nThe odds of a hurricane striking Maryland ...\n\nWhen used as a proper noun, initial-capped:\n\nAfter Hurricane Ike spun off Cuba ...\n\nHowever, when used to refer to more than one proper noun, lowercase:\n\nIn the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita ...\n\nHYPHENATION\n\nCompound modifiers and hyphens\n\nHyphenate compound modifiers when they precede the noun or verb they modify:\n\na 5-year-old child (BUT: The child was 5 years old.)\n\nthe first-year student\n\na general-education requirement\n\na heavy-ion physicist\n\na well-known author\n\nA hyphen is not necessary in a compound adjective that includes Arabic numerals to represent dollars.\n\nan $18 million building\n\nExceptions: Do not use hyphens when the compound modifier includes very or an adverb ending in -ly.\n\nfrequently asked questions\n\neasily adapted questionnaire\n\nEspecially familiar modifier-noun pairs are often unhyphenated when used to modify another noun.\n\nhigh school students (not high-school students)\n\npublic health strategies\n\nSuspended hyphen\n\nUse a suspended hyphen when a base word, such as year in the example below, or a suffix or prefix such as self, is doing double duty.\n\nsecond- and third-year law students\n\nself-initiated and -implemented projects\n\nUse this construction even when the complete words, standing alone, would be closed up.\n\nmacro- and microeconomics\n\nINCLUSIVE LANGUAGE\n\nAddiction\n\nThe following terms are acceptable:\n\naddiction\n\nsubstance use\n\nsubstance use disorder\n\nsubstance misuse, but only when referring specifically to underage alcohol consumption, use of illegal substances, or use other than directed of medication\n\nTo avoid stigmatizing language, do not use these terms:\n\naddict\n\njunkie\n\ndrug abuse(r)\n\nsubstance abuse(r)\n\nclean (whether describing a person or a drug test result)\n\nUse person-first language:\n\nShe has a substance use disorder.\n\nHe has an opioid addiction.\n\nRead more guidance on this topic at https://americanhealth.jhu.edu/article/guiding-principles-addressing-stigma-opioid-addiction and in AP.\n\nAge\n\nElderly\n\nDo not use the elderly. Instead use elderly people, older adults, or senior citizens (usually those over age 65). Avoid using seniors, which may be confused with fourth-year students. AP has further guidance on this topic.\n\nDisability\n\nConsult AP’s section on disability and the National Center of Disability & Journalism Style Guide for topics not listed here.\n\nInstead of\n\nafflicted with\n\nis a victim of\n\nsuffers from\n\nUse\n\nHe has muscular dystrophy.\n\nShe has a substance use disorder.\n\nInstead of\n\nwheelchair-bound\n\nconfined to a wheelchair\n\nUse\n\nShe uses a wheelchair.\n\nHe walks with crutches.\n\nIn general, unless the subject of the article or reference prefers an identity-first reference (e.g., an autistic woman), refer to the person first, followed by the description of the disability:\n\npeople with disabilities\n\nadults with diabetes (vs. diabetics)\n\npeople with AIDS (vs. AIDS patients)\n\nchildren with autism (vs. autistic children)\n\nDo not use handicapped to describe people or accommodations:\n\naccessible bathroom\n\naccessible entrance\n\naccessible parking\n\nGender\n\nChair, chairman, chairwoman\n\nUse chair whenever possible.\n\nThe chair of the board showed off his new shoes.\n\nThe department chair introduced her assistant.\n\nHe, him, his\n\nAvoid using he, him, and his to refer to people in general. Recast the sentence so that they, them, and their can be used.\n\nHe or she, him or her, his or hers; he/she, him/her, his/hers\n\nReplace he or she, him or her, his or hers and he/she, him/her, his/hers with the gender-neutral they, them, their, theirs.\n\nThe AP Stylebook allows the use of they, them, and their as singular, gender-neutral pronouns for people who identify as as a gender outside a male and female binary. They, them, their may also be used as singular, gender-neutral pronouns when a person’s gender is unknown or when referring to a role that could be filled by a person of any gender.\n\nThe chair of the department will make final budgetary decisions. They will also be responsible for approving new spending.\n\nSee AP’s sections on gender and sexuality and they, them, their for further guidance.\n\nNicotine and tobacco product use\n\nThe following terms are acceptable:\n\ntobacco use\n\ne-cigarette [or other acceptable product term] use\n\ntobacco product use\n\nTo avoid stigmatizing language, do not use these terms:\n\nsmoker(s)\n\ntobacco [or other acceptable product term] user(s)\n\nnon-smoker(s)\n\nnever smoker(s)\n\nvaper(s)\n\nuser(s)\n\nUse person-first language:\n\nperson who smokes/people who smoke\n\nperson who uses tobacco/people who use tobacco [or other acceptable product term]\n\npeople who report no current smoking\n\npeople who use heated tobacco products\n\nHe has never smoked.\n\nShe uses e-cigarettes.\n\nRead more guidance on this topic at https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/pages/people-first-language-policy.\n\nITALICS\n\nItalics versus quotation marks\n\nItalicize titles of books, newspapers, magazines, scientific journals, TV shows, record albums, movies, plays, works of art, very long poems, operas and other long musical works, ships, aircraft, spacecraft, and satellites.\n\nThe names of poems, articles, and book chapters are set off by quotation marks.\n\nWords used as words\n\nItalicize words used as words.\n\nThe term ozone refers to an atmospheric gas.\n\nNon-English words\n\nWhen using non-English words and expressions, italicize and insert accents and other diacritical marks whenever possible.\n\nItalicize only those non-English words/expressions that are unfamiliar to the intended audience. Words now accepted as part of the English language include:\n\nalma mater\n\nrendezvous\n\nspiel\n\npastiche\n\nLAST\n\nAvoid using last to signify the immediate past, as in \"Last June, we went berry picking.\" If a past-tense verb is used—\"This June, we picked berries\" or \"This summer, we went fishing\"—the meaning is clear.\n\nLISTS\n\nBulleted versus numbered lists\n\nIntroduce items in a vertical list with numbers only if the order of the items matters.

Use URG when referring to an inclusive set of underrepresented groups. If discussing a specific underrepresented population, add a reference to the specific population, e.g., underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.\n\nUnderrepresented minorities\n\nUnderrepresented minorities or URM typically refers to people from racial and ethnic groups that the NIH classifies as having low representation in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, specifically people who come from the Black, Latinx, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander communities.
