        "text": "Abraham Lincoln and Maryland\n\nMaryland’s proximity to Washington made it a very important state for President Abraham Lincoln — even though his political support there was limited. Indeed, the hostility of local residents forced President-elect Lincoln to sneak through Baltimore in the middle of the night on February 23, 1861 in order to circumvent a murder plot hatched there. Hostility in Maryland led to the suspension of habeas corpus by the President and a confrontation over civil liberties with the Supreme Court’s chief justice, himself a Maryland resident. Maryland was twice invaded by large Confederate armies and on one occasion, a smaller Confederate contingent swept through the state in an attempt to attack Washington. President Lincoln witnessed the attack from the parapet of a Washington fort in July 1864. And finally on April 14, 1865, it was a Maryland native who fired the bullet in Ford’s Theater that was to kill the President.\n\nMaryland was a conflicted state. It was also pivotal. In the 1860 presidential election, Tennessee Unionist John Bell narrowly edged out Kentucky Democrat John Breckinridge to capture the state’s electoral votes. Abraham Lincoln received only 2.5 percent of the state’s votes that November. Earlier in May 1860 at the Republican National Convention, Maryland had cast three votes for New York Senator William H. Seward and 8 votes for Edward Bates on the first ballot. It repeated that pattern on the second vote, but on the third ballot, 9 votes went to Mr. Lincoln and just 2 votes for Seward. Soon thereafter, Mr. Lincoln’s nomination was made unanimous.\n\nMr. Lincoln had a somewhat jaundiced view toward Maryland. Friend Ward Hill Lamon recalled: “When Mr. Lincoln was being importuned to appoint to his cabinet another man from Maryland rather than Mr. [Montgomery] Blair, he said laughingly: ‘Maryland must, I think, be a good State to move from,’ and then told a story of a witness who on being asked his age replied, ‘Sixty.’ Being satisfied that he was much older, the judge repeated the question, and on receiving the same answer, admonished the witness, saying that the Court knew him to be much older than sixty. ‘Oh,’ said the witness, ‘you’re thinking about that fifteen years that I lived down on eastern shore of Maryland; that was so much lost time and don’t count.'”1\n\nNevertheless, when Mr. Lincoln chose a “Border State” representative for his Cabinet in early 1861, he selected Maryland native Montgomery Blair. Blair, however, had spent so much time in Missouri during the 1850s that Maryland residents questioned whether he was a real resident of their state. James G. Blaine, who was the Republican leader of Maine at the beginning of the war, later wrote: “Mr. Blair was appointed as a citizen of Maryland. This gave serious offense to many of Mr. Lincoln’s most valued supporters, and was especially distasteful to the Union men of Maryland, with Henry Winter Davis at their head. They regarded Mr. Blair as a non-resident, as not in any sense identified with them, and as disposed from the outset to foment disturbance where harmony was especially demanded.”2\n\nPresident-elect Abraham Lincoln’s middle-of-the-night transit through Baltimore early on February 23, 1861, delighted cartoonists who misrepresented the facts of the trip. Although the circumstances of his passage through the city were exaggerated for comic effect, it was nevertheless a true cloak-and-hat operation that responded to a genuine threat to the President-elect’s life. Detective Allan Pinkerton had been directed to conduct an undercover investigation by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, which was worried about possible sabotage to its rail lines. Pinkerton’s operatives uncovered a plot to murder President-elect Lincoln as he moved through Baltimore on his way from Philadelphia to Washington. Pinkerton briefed Mr. Lincoln and his entourage in Philadelphia on February 21 and convinced him to change his schedule for the night of February 22.\n\nOn February 22, Mr. Lincoln had started his day in Philadelphia, then traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was expected to stay overnight. Instead, Mr. Lincoln and Ward Hill Lamon took a special train back to Philadelphia and then took a regular train southeast to Baltimore where they had to change to another train bound for the nation’s capital. Pennsylvania journalist Alexander K. McClure wrote: “Mr. Lincoln was put into his berth and the curtains drawn. He was supposed to be a sick man. When the conductor came around, Mr. Pinkerton handed him the “sick man’s” ticket and he passed on without question. When the train reached Baltimore, at half-past three o’clock in the morning, it was met by one of Mr. Pinkerton’s detectives, who reported that everything was “all right,” and in a short time the party was speeding on to the national capital, where rooms had been engaged for Mr. Lincoln and his guard at Willard’s Hotel. Mr. Lincoln always regretted this ‘secret passage’ to Washington, for it was repugnant to a man of his high courage. He had agreed to the plan simply because all of his friends urged it as the best thing to do.”3\n\nPinkerton’s guards shadowed the President-elect throughout the trip. Lamon recalled: “At thirty minutes past three the train reached Baltimore. One of the spy’s assistants came on board and informed him in a whisper that ‘all was right.’ Mr. Lincoln lay still in his berth; and in a few moments the car was being slowly drawn through the quiet streets of the city toward what was called the Washington depot. There again was another pause, but no sound more alarming that the noise of shifting cars and engineers. The passengers, tucked away on their narrow shelves, dozed on as peacefully as if Mr. Lincoln had never been born, until they were awakened by the loud strokes of a huge club against a night-watchman’s box, which stood within the depot and close to the track. It was an Irishman, trying to arouse a sleepy ticket-agent comfortably ensconced within. For twenty minutes the Irishman pounded the box with ever-increasing vigor, and at each blow shouted at the top of his voice, ‘Captain! it’s four o’clock! it’s four o’clock!’ The Irishman seemed to think that time had ceased to run at four o’clock, and making no allowance for the period consumed by his futile exercises, repeated to the last his original statement that it was four o’clock. The passengers were intensely amused; and their jokes and laughter at the Irishman’s expense were not lost upon the occupants of the two sections in the rear.”4 About 6 A.M., Mr. Lincoln’s train pulled into Union Station in Washington where he was met by Illinois Congressman Elihu B. Washburne.\n\nVice President-elect Hannibal Hamlin had met the Lincolns in New York several days earlier but not accompanied Mr. Lincoln on the train ride south. Hamlin was about a day behind the Lincolns in a special car out of Philadelphia, according to biographer H. Draper Hunt. Hunt wrote that “the train pulling it must have left Philadelphia late or been delayed en route, because night had fallen before it rolled into the hotly secessionist city of Baltimore. As Hamlin lay in his berth, he could hear the angry rumblings of a mob at the station and threats that ‘No damned Abolitionist like Lincoln or Hamlin should enter the White House.’ Suddenly, heavy feet sounded in the corridor, the curtains to his compartment were jerked back and several whiskery, liquor-reeking faces peered in at him. The plug-uglies, searching the train on the chance that Lincoln might be aboard, failed to recognize the Vice-President-elect and stomped out of the car, and Hamlin and his wife arrived in Washington without further incident.” 5\n\nBaltimore, meanwhile, was offended by Mr. Lincoln’s subterfuge — although in contrast to other major urban areas, there had been no invitation extended to President-Elect Lincoln to visit the city. Lincoln scholar Victor Searcher wrote: “Baltimorean civic pride was cut to the quick. A committee was formed to demand explanation of the President-elect for his unseemly conduct. Such reaction was normal and natural. They did not know the facts which, when fully revealed, disclosed the existence of a conspiracy of hotheaded radicals whose actions could precipitate widespread bloodshed, and who had direct designs on Lincoln’s life….Following their failure to kill him, however, their course became unrestrained and in a few weeks they roamed city and countryside, burning and pillaging.”6\n\nMaryland was a divided state. Historian James M. McPherson wrote: “The tobacco counties of southern Maryland and the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay were secessionist. The grain-growing counties of northern and western Maryland, containing few slaves, were safe for the Union. But the loyalty of Baltimore, with a third of the state’s population, was suspect. The mayor’s unionism was barely tepid, and the police chief sympathized with the South. Confederate flags appeared on many city homes and buildings during the tense days after Sumter. The traditional role of mobs in Baltimore politics created a volatile situation. Only a spark was needed to ignite the states secessionists, such a spark hit the streets of Baltimore on April 19.”7\n\nHistorian David Detzer not that “the city had long been famous, or infamous, for…an ugly tendency toward violence. Eruptions had often exploded during its colonial years. Perhaps it was Baltimore’s heterogeneity. The fact that the city had welcomed Catholics may have resulted in antagonisms more than tolerance.” 8 The passage of Hamlin and Mr. Lincoln through Baltimore proved only a dress rehearsal for what greeted northern soldiers trying to transit through Baltimore two months later. On April 19, President Lincoln was informed by Governor Thomas H. Hicks that several soldiers from the 6th Massachusetts Regiment had been killed travelling through the city. A dozen local residents had also been killed in the confrontation. According to historian Edward G. Everett, “It was three o’clock in the morning of April 19 when the Sixth Massachusetts and the Pennsylvania troops left Philadelphia; by noon they reached Baltimore. Horses were hitched to the passenger cars, and they were driven to the Camden Street station. Nine cars loaded with men of the Sixth Massachusetts made the trip without incident, but as the tenth passenger car was coming over the Pratt Street bridge, some Baltimore plug-uglies piled stones and dumped sand on the track, and even dragged anchors from the Gay Street wharf, to block the passage of any other cars. The tenth car was forced to return to the President Street station. Here a council of war was called, and two alternatives were presented: the troops could either return to Philadelphia or march to the Camden Street station to entrain for Washington. The troops decided on the latter course, and as they marched out of the depot, the mob closed in, hurling stones and bricks. Fence posts provided the mob with additional weapons.” The casualties included four Massachusetts soldiers and three Pennsylvania soldiers out of uniform. The unarmed Pennsylvania militia had also been travelling to Washington. According to Everett, “Mayor George William Brown of Baltimore and Marshal George P. Kane, Chief of Police, acted with great courage, getting themselves and the police between the soldiers and the mob, which did not attack the police.”9\n\nThe city was in turmoil. The prospects of northern troops moving through Baltimore inflamed local residents even more than the passage of the President-elect had. Maryland officials including Mayor Brown and Governor Hicks sought to pacify the mob and prevent more troops from arriving. Hicks was a farmer who in 1857 had been elected Governor of Maryland as a Know Nothing. Historian David Detzer called Hicks a “political hack” who “found himself unexpectedly elected to Maryland’s highest office. A chunky man, mentally sluggish and not overly courageous…[by] 1861 Governor Hicks’s position had grown untenable, since his Know Nothing party had virtually dissolved, denying him any base of support.” 10 Hicks and Brown wired President Lincoln on April 18: “A collision between the citizens and the Northern troops has taken place in Baltimore, and the excitement is fearful. Send no troops here. We will endeavor to prevent all bloodshed. A public meeting of citizens has been called, and the troops of the State have been called out to preserve the peace. They will be enough.”11\n\nHicks had supported Union Party candidate John Bell in 1860 and tried to maintain state’s neutrality while keeping Maryland in the Union in early 1861. Days before the firing on Fort Sumter, Hicks had met with President Lincoln. Mayor Brown and Governor Hicks conferred with Baltimore leaders on April 19. According to Lincoln biographer Josiah G. Holland, “Governor Hicks of Maryland and Mayor Brown of Baltimore were frightened. They did not wish to have any more troops taken through Baltimore. Mr. Lincoln assured them that he made no point of bringing troops through that city, and that he left the matter with General Scott, who had said in his presence that the troops might be marched around Baltimore. By this arrangement a collision with the people of Baltimore would be avoided, unless they should go out of the way to seek it. ‘Now and ever,’ said Mr. Lincoln, in closing a note to these gentlemen, ‘I shall do all in my power for peace, consistently with the maintenance of the government.”12 Brown convinced Hicks that the bridges to Baltimore from the north should be burned in order to prevent northern troops from transiting the city. A mob destroyed the bridges for them.\n\nAlthough Governor Hicks mobilized the state militia, Baltimore remained in chaos. “Maryland flamed with passion,” wrote historian James McPherson. 13 Historian Everett wrote: “Mobs fired railroad stations and threw locomotives into the river. Somebody got off a message asking Jefferson Davis for Confederate troops to preserve the city’s liberties. All communication with Havre-de-Grace [on the Chesapeake) was severed….Two days later a mob completed Baltimore isolation by cutting down the wires and telegraph poles on all lines which gave communication with the North. Washington had all telegraph lines down, with only the single Boston regiment and the five Pennsylvania companies at hand…briefly, Washington was cut off, and Baltimore was blazing with secession sentiment right across the path for help. Rumors permeated the nation’s capital.”14\n\nIn President Lincoln’s response to Hicks and Brown on Saturday April 20, he asked the two Maryland leaders to confer with him in Washington: “Gov. Hicks, I desire to consult with you and the Mayor of Baltimore relative to preserving the peace of Maryland. Please come immediately by special train, which you can take at Baltimore, or if necessary one can be sent from hence. Answer forthwith.”15 The subsequent meeting was “an extraordinary spectacle, this of the President of the United States and the general of its armies parleying with a mayor and suspending the right of national troops to march through his city to save Washington,” wrote historian Allan Nevins.16 As Brown reported the meeting: “The President, upon his part, recognized the good faith of the city and State authorities, and insisted upon his own. He admitted the excited state of feeling in Baltimore, and his desire and duty to avoid the fatal consequences of a collision with the people. He urged, on the other hand, the absolute, irresistible necessity of having a transmit through the State for such troops as might be necessary for the protection of the Federal Capital. The protection of Washington, he asseverated with great earnestness, was the sole object of concentrating troops there; and he protested that none of the troops brought through Maryland were intended for any purposes hostile to the State, or aggressive as against the Southern States. Being now unable to ring them up the Potomac in security, the Government must either bring them through Maryland or abandon the capital.”\n\n“He called on General Scott for his opinion, which the General gave at length, to the effect that troops might be brought through Maryland, without going through Baltimore, by either carrying them from Perrysville to Annapolis, and thence by rail to Washington, or by bringing them to the Relay House on the Northern Central Railroad, and marching them to the Relay House on the Washington Railroad, and then by rail to the Capital. If the people would permit them to go by either of those routes uninterruptedly, the necessity of their passing through Baltimore would be avoided. If the people would not permit them a transit thus remote from the city, they must select their own best route, and, if need be, fight their way through Baltimore — a result which the General earnestly deprecated.”\n\n“The President expressed his hearty concurrence in the desire to avoid a collision, and said that no more troops should be ordered through Baltimore, if they were permitted to go [un]interruptedly by either of the other routes suggested. In this disposition the Secretary of War [Simon Cameron] expressed his participation.”\n\n“Mayor Brown assured the President that the city authorities would use all lawful means to prevent their citizens from leaving Baltimore to attack the troops in passing at a distance; but he urged, at the same time, the impossibility of their being able to promise any thing more than their best efforts in that direction. The excitement was great, he told the President; the people of all classes were fully aroused, and it was impossible for any one to answer for the consequences of the presence of Northern troops anywhere within our borders. He reminded the President; that the jurisdiction of the city authorities was confined to their own population, and that he could give no promises for the people elsewhere, because he would be unable to keep them if given. The President frankly acknowledged this difficulty, and said that the Government would only ask the city authorities to use their best efforts with respect to those under their jurisdiction.”\n\n“The interview terminated with the distinct assurance, on the part of the President, that no more troops would be sent through Baltimore unless obstructed in their transmit in other directions, and with the understanding that the city authorities should do their best to restrain their own people.” 17\n\nHistorian Detzer wrote: “During that weekend Baltimore’s leaders, having prevented further train travel from the north, took other drastic actions to isolate the city. They saw to it that telegraph wires going north were cut, this time effectively. The mail normally arriving by train from northern states was mostly interrupted because of the destruction of the bridges (though a few items like newspapers were brought in by wagon). On Saturday morning, several outsiders who seemed possible ‘spies from the North’ were arrested, and only released when it turned out they had been trapped in the city by the bridge destruction. To prevent a surprise naval raid by Yankee ships, the harbor buoys were hauled up.”18\n\nComplaints from Maryland residents became a regular feature of White House Life in the spring of 1861. On April 22, a group of nearly 30 residents of Baltimore visited the White House under the leadership of the Rev. Richard Fuller, a prominent Southern Baptist leader. According to Dr. Fuller, “We were at once and cordially received. I marked the President closely. Constitutionally genial and jovial, he is wholly inaccessible to Christian appeals — & his egotism will forever prevent him comprehending what patriotism means.” President Lincoln pressed the delegation for their recommendations. Dr. Fuller told the President he should “let the country know that you are disposed to recognize the independence of the Southern States. I say nothing of Secession; recognize the fact that they have formed a government of their own, that they will never be united again with the North, and peace will instantly take the place of anxiety and suspense, and war may be averted.19\n\nAlexander K. McClure wrote: “President Lincoln replied, laughingly: ‘If I grant this concession, you will be back tomorrow asking that no troops be marched ‘around’ it.” The President was right. That afternoon, and again on Sunday and Monday, committees sought him, protesting that Maryland soil should not be ‘polluted’ by the feet of soldiers marching against the South. The President had but one reply: ‘We must have troops, and as they can neither crawl under Maryland nor fly over it, they must come across it.'”20 As reported by the Baltimore Sun, “Dr. Fuller expressed very earnestly the hope that no more troops would be ordered over the soil of his State. He remarked that Maryland had shed her blood freely in the War of Independence, that she was the first to move the adoption of the constitution, and had only yielded her clinging attachment to the Union when the blood of her citizens had been shed by strangers on their way to a conflict with her sisters of the South.”21\n\nPresident Lincoln did not back down on his need for troops and the need for them to transit through Baltimore. “I’ll tell you a story,” President Lincoln said. “You have heard of the Irishman who, when a fellow was cutting his throat with a dull razor, complained that he haggled it. Now if I can’t have troops direct through Maryland, and must have them all the way round by water, or marched across out-of-the way territory, I shall be haggled.”22 The President told the Baltimore delegation: “You, gentlemen, come here to me and ask for peace on any terms, and yet have no word of condemnation for those who are making war on us. You express great horror of bloodshed, and yet would not lay a straw in the way of those who are organizing in Virginia and elsewhere to capture this city. The rebels attack Fort Sumter, and your citizens attack troops sent to the defense of the Government, and the lives and property in Washington, and yet you would have me break my oath and surrender the Government without a blow. There is no Washington in that — no Jackson in that — no manhood nor honor in that. I have no desire to invade the South; but I must have troops to defend this Capital. Geographically it lies surrounded by the soil of Maryland; and mathematically the necessity exists that they should come over her territory. Our men are not moles, and can’t dig under the earth; they are not birds, and can’t fly through the air. There is no way but to march across, and that they must do. But in doing this there is no need of collision. Keep your rowdies in Baltimore, and there will be no bloodshed. Go home and tell your people that if they will not attack us, we will not attack them; but if they do attack us, we will return it, and that severely.”23\n\nMeanwhile, Massachusetts General Benjamin Butler circumvented Baltimore. He came by ship to Annapolis on April 22 with his Massachusetts regiment. He was warned not to disembark by Governor Hicks who wanted no northern troops in his state, but Butler marched to his own drummer and marched his Massachusetts regiment to Washington along the railroad line, repairing it as he went. By April 25, his regiment and New York’s Seventh Regiment were in Washington. According to historian Dean Sprague, “Although Baltimore remained untamed, troops continued landing every day at Annapolis and the sheer numbers of volunteers rushing to Washington began to overawe the little state of Maryland. Within a week, nearly 20,000 Union troops passed through Annapolis, a far cry from the few hundred who had gotten into trouble in Baltimore. The Union was beginning to show some muscle in Maryland.”24\n\n“The reign of terror continued until April 24th,” wrote historian Allan Nevins. “Hundreds of Unionists were driven from Baltimore, and thousands more fled.” 25 Baltimore quickly quieted but Maryland politics did not. Governor Hicks worried that a slave rebellion was imminent. General Butler pledged to work “in suppressing most promptly and efficiently any insurrection against the laws of the State of Maryland.”26\n\nMaryland attorney Reverdy Johnson wrote President Lincoln on April 22. After assuring the President of his loyalty to the Union, Johnson stated: “The existing excitement and alarm of the public mind of my own State and of Virginia, are owing, I have every reason to believe, to an apprehension that it is your purpose to use the military force you are assembling in this District for the invasion of, or other hostile attack upon, these States. In this apprehension, as you already know, I do not share; but that it is sincerely entertained by enlightened and patriotic citizens, I have no doubt.”\n\n“It is all-important therefore, to present peace at least, that this misapprehension, if it be one, be corrected at the earliest moment. I think that I can use the fact that no such purpose is intended, and that your sole object is to use the force to accomplish your clear duty to defend the Seat of Government, and the property and authority of the Government, from attack from any quarter, so as greatly if not entirely to quiet the existing feeling, and restore the public peace, now so much threatened. This your duty is so clearly imperative, that I cannot doubt that its performance will receive the cheerful sanction of every intelligent and patriotic citizen; and these I am persuaded constitute a large majority of the people of Virginia and Maryland.”\n\n“May I therefore be permitted most respectfully to inquire if your design is the apprehended one I have mentioned, or is not, on the contrary, exclusively to defend the Seat of Government. And I add with much pleasure, that if this last is your purpose, as I am sure it is, I think I know the feeling of my own State well enough to assure you that you will have no difficulty in rallying to the District as many of her people as you may deem necessary to accomplish that object.”27\n\nTwo days later, Johnson again wrote President Lincoln, requesting answer to his first letter. Mr. Lincoln wrote Reverdy Johnson on April 24, 1861: “I do say the sole purpose of bringing troops here is to defend this capital… I have no purpose to invade Virginia or any other State, but I do not mean to let them invade us without striking back.”28 Mr. Lincoln wrote:\n\n“Your note of this morning is just received. I forebore to answer yours of the 22d because of my aversion (which I thought you understood,) to getting on paper, and furnishing new grounds for misunderstanding.”\n\n“I do say the sole purpose of bringing troops here is to defend this capital.”\n\n“I do say I have no purpose to invade Virginia, with them or any other troops, as I understand the word invasion. But suppose Virginia sends her troops, or admits other through her border, to assail this capital, am I not to repel them, even to the crossing of the Potomac if I can?”\n\n“Suppose Virginia erects, or permits to be erected, batteries on the opposite shore, to bombard the city, are we to stand still and see it done? In a word, if Virginia strikes us, are we not to strike back, and as effectively as we can?”\n\n“Again, are we not to hold Fort Monroe (for instance) if we can? I have no objection to declare a thousand times that I have no purpose to invade Virginia or any other State, but I do not mean to let them invade us without striking back.”29\n\nHistorian Robert J. Brugger wrote: “The Union or secession issues involved procedure that bogged down revolution and focused attention sharply on one man. If Maryland were to withdraw from the Union, the decision would require a convention elected for the purpose. Only the General Assembly could call such an election, and the legislature, convening every other year under the 1851 constitution, was not due to meet until 1862. Everyone watched to see whether the governor would call a special session.”30 On April 25 Mr. Lincoln wrote General Winfield Scott: “The Maryland Legislature assembles to-morrow at Anapolis; and, not improbably, will take action to arm the people of that State against the United States. The question has been submitted to, and considered, by me, whether it would not be justifiable, upon the ground of necessary defence, for you, as commander in Chief of the United States Army, to arrest, or disperse the members of that body. I think it would not be justifiable; nor, efficient for the desired object.”\n\n“First, they have a clearly legal right to assemble; and, we can not know in advance, that their action will not be lawful, and peaceful. And if we wait until they shall have acted, their arrest, or dispersion, will not lessen the effect of their action.”\n\n“Secondly, we can not permanently prevent their action. If we arrest them, we can not long hold them as prisoners; and when liberated, they will immediately re-assemble, and take their action. And, precisely the same if we simply disperse them. They will immediately re-assemble in some other place.”\n\n“I therefore conclude that it is only left to the commanding General to watch, and await their action, which, if it shall be to arm their people against the United States, he is to adopt the most prompt, and efficient means to counteract, even, if necessary, to the bombardment of their cities — and in the extremest necessity, the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.”31\n\nHistorian Philip Paludan wrote: “Rumors flourished that the Maryland legislature would arm the state to fight against the Union, and independently, some Marylanders organized local militia to fight for the Confederacy.” 32 Governor Hicks had decided to call the Maryland legislature into session on April 26 in Frederick to avoid Union troops who controlled Annapolis. Among those attending were ten secessionist Baltimore delegates who had recently been elected as replacements to legislative seats. Brugger noted that the “lawmakers would not be surrounded by Union troops but would sit in the midst of Union sympathizers.”33 Historian Hesseltine wrote: “Butler begged Lincoln to allow him ‘to bag the whole nest of traitorous Maryland legislators,’ but this was farther than the President was willing to go. Expecting trouble at Annapolis, Hicks instructed the legislators to meet in Frederick. There, he explained to them that the Baltimore riots were the acts of an irresponsible mob, and the legislators voted to approve the acts of Baltimore’s city fathers in the emergency.” 34 Historian Brugger wrote that “The Lincoln administration quietly planned every necessary measure, including ‘the bombardment of their cities,’ should legislators vote to arm against the Union.”35\n\n“On April 27 and 28 the Assembly declared that it had no constitutional authority to take any action leading to secession. In the Senate the vote was unanimous, and the House of Delegates the majority was more than four to one,” wrote historian Harold R. Manakee. “On May 10 the lawmaking body of the state issued a more detailed statement, protesting the war as unconstitutional and unjust. It called upon the people of Maryland to work for peace between North and South, and declared that the state would have no part in the war. It asked for the recognition of the Confederate States as an independent nation, and protested against military occupation of Maryland as a violation of the Constitution. Finally, it stated that any move to organize and arm the state militia, or to call a state convention to vote on secession would be unwise.”36\n\nButler “believed that the protest about seizing the railroad was to get an excuse for making that change of place of meeting without giving the true reason. I am convinced that from the hour of my announcement of my purpose to so use the troops in keeping the peace, Maryland was as firmly a loyal State as any in the Union, so that I congratulated myself on the good effect of my announcement to the people of that State that the United States troops, and especially the troops of antislavery Massachusetts, had not come to Maryland to inaugurate a servile war or to promote negro insurrection.”37\n\n“Unquestionably,” wrote historian Lawrence M. Denton, the aggressive actions of the federal military in Maryland during late April and early May had a profound impact on the members of the legislature. The occupation of the state by the federal military simply overawed the pro-southern majority while at the same time it encouraged and emboldened the Unionist minority. Resolutions — words of condemnation — were the order of the day, whereas action — a vote on secession — was not.”38 Denton maintained: “The secession movement in Maryland probably would have been successful if Marylanders had been free to choose, because a majority of her people favored the South. An even larger majority opposed the North, Lincoln’s policies, and the Republican Party.” 39 But the military force changed the civil situation — just as it changed the military one. Historian Allan Nevins wrote: “Before the end of April, Fort McHenry had been heavily reinforced, Fort Morris Garrisoned, and gangs of men put to work restoring the railway bridges.”40\n\nComplaining delegates from Washington continued to visit the White House. On Saturday, May 4, John Hay wrote in his diary: “The Maryland Disunionists, that branch of them represented by Bob McLane called today upon the President. They roared as gently as there any nightingale. The only point they particularly desired to press was that there was no special necessity at present existing for the armed occupation of Maryland. That it would irritate and inflame. Still they admitted that the right of the Government to occupy the City and State was undeniable: That the people were on the side of the Union: a majority unconditionally and a majority of the minority favorably inclined, while nearly all were for avoiding any conflict with the federal authorities. They also implored the President not to act in any spirit of revenge for the murdered soldiers. The President coolly replied that he never acted from any such impulse and as to their other views he should take them into consideration and should decline giving them any answer at present.” Mr. Lincoln said “he never acted from any such impulse and as to their other views he should take them into consideration and should decline giving them any answer at present.”41\n\nBut with the presence of Union soldiers, noted historian James M. McPherson, “Indigenous Maryland unionism began to assert itself.” 42 Governor Hicks began to cooperate with the Lincoln Administration. “Relying on the support of the federal government, he parted company with his legislature, deprived the state militia of its arms, and refused to answer legislative queries about his acts,” wrote historian William B. Hesseltine.43 On May 8, Governor Hicks wrote President Lincoln: “I deem it to be my duty to inform you that the Virginia troops at and near Harper’s Ferry have seized Canal Boats laden with produce destined for Washington and Georgetown; have planted batteries at important positions in the neighborhood; and have grossly violated the rights and injured the property of citizens of Maryland.”\n\n“I also deem it my duty to apprise you that I am unofficially informed that a certain Tench Tilghman, of Oxford, Talbot county, Maryland, has seized upon the United States Custom House at Oxford, in this State, and refuses to give possession thereof to the person recently appointed by you to perform the duties of collector at that Port.”\n\n“I suggest, in reference to this, that the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland be directed by you to inquire into the matter, and institute such proceedings as may lead to the punishment of the offender.”\n\n“In regard to the aggressions of the Virginia troops, I trust your Excellency will take such prompt steps as will effectually prevent their recurrence.”44\n\nGeneral Butler interpreted orders from General Winfield Scott as authorizing him to retake Baltimore on May 13. He arrived in the middle of the night in the middle of a thunderstorm and retook the city without bloodshed. Butler encountered no resistance in retaking the city and seized the city’s arms cache without opposition. Caches of weapons held by city authorities were seized. Scott was infuriated and wrote Butler: “Your hazardous occupation of Baltimore was made without my knowledge, and, of course, without my approbation. It is a godsend that it is without conflict of arms. It is also reported that you have sent a detachment to Frederick; but this is impossible. Not a word have I received from you as to either movement. Let me hear from you.”45\n\nButler wrote in his memoirs: “It is but fair for me to say that I had the strongest possible suspicion that if I asked General Scott for orders to occupy Baltimore he would refuse them, saying that men enough could not be spared from the defence of Washington to make the movement, and that he was waiting for more men. Now I believed and knew, and it so turned out, that it was comparatively as easy to capture Baltimore as it was to capture my supper. I knew it, but Scott did not. Was I not justified in acting upon my knowledge? I agree that the expedition was called hazardous by the know-nothings and timid ones, and it has been said it was undertaken in a spirit of ‘bravado,’ as say Messrs. Nicolay and Hay in their Life of Lincoln, and that it was so looked upon by all those who did not know what they were talking and writing about; but I did know.”46\n\nButler, however, came into conflict with the Union army’s commander, Winfield Scott, because he acted without orders. Scott biographer John Eisenhower wrote: “The people of Baltimore were justly incensed at this insult, so Scott quickly sent Butler a message of rebuke and acted to remove him from direct command of his brigade. But realizing that Butler was a popular figure — and important to Lincoln as a strong pro-Union Democrat — [Scott] proposed placing the general in command of Fort Monroe. At the same time, he promised Butler a promotion to the grade of major general. At first Butler refused the assignment, considering the command of a mere fortress to be in fact a demotion. He stomped into Scott’s headquarters, had a severe confrontation with the general-in-chief, went back to his quarters, and burst into tears.”47 President Lincoln backed up General Scott and Butler was duly transferred to command the grandiosely-titled “Department of Virginia, North and South Carolina.” Butler was a useful personage for the Lincoln Administration because he was a Democrat who had supported Breckinridge in 1860 and who moreover had proven his ability to get things done.\n\nOn April 27, President Lincoln had written General Scott, this time to authorize suspension of habeas corpus in Maryland: “You are engaged in repressing an insurrection against the laws of the United States. If at any point on or in the vicinity of the [any] military line, which is now [or which shall be] used between the City Philadelphia and the City of Washington, via Perryville, Annapolis City, and Annapolis Junction, you find resistance which renders it necessary to suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus for the public safety, you, personally or through the officer in command at the point where the [at which] resistance occurs, are authorized to suspend that writ.”48\n\n“The writ [of habeas corpus] at the Civil War’s beginning had a minuscule history. There were few federal crimes and hence few occasions to use it in federal courts; state judges, often elected, sued the writ infrequently. When it was discussed most Americans probably recalled the outcry of abolitionists when fugitive slave laws denied alleged runaways access to it,” wrote historian Philip Paludan. “Action was imperative, however, as Baltimore demonstration. Throughout the nation the possibility for similar disloyalty was woven into demography and politics.”49 The Lincoln Administration engaged in an essential act of self-preservation — seeking to differentiate between loyal and disloyal citizens. Many Marylanders were actively secessionist, noted historian Barbara Jeanne Fields: “Men, supplies, and munitions intended for the rebels passed freely in the vicinity, on their way to rendezvous at Point of Rocks and Harper’s Ferry.”50\n\nTwo Maryland residents took important roles in spotlighting the government’s decision to deal swiftly with those working to destroy that government. One was Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. The other was John Merryman, a rich planter with strong secessionist instincts — on which he took an active leadership roles as leader of secession militia. Historian Allan Nevins wrote that: “Merryman, who had been drilling some secessionist volunteers near Cockeysville, Maryland, and preaching rebel doctrines, had been arrested May 25, 1861, by General George Cadwalader, and thrown into Fort McHenry. He petitioned Chief Justice Taney, sitting as Federal Circuit Judge, for a writ ordering the general to bring him into court for a hearing. Taney issued the writ, and Cadwalader at once refused to obey it. Thereupon Taney sent a marshal to serve the commander with a citation for contempt of court. The officer, who expected this, ordered men with bayonets to prevent entrance to the fort. The helpless Taney could only prepare a written statement denying the constitutional right of the President to suspend the writ, file it in the Circuit Court, and send a copy to Lincoln, calling upon him to perform his constitutional duty by seeing that the civil process of the nation was enforced; whereupon Lincoln’s obtained the Attorney-General’s opinion that his suspension order had been quite correct.”51\n\nIt was a major legal confrontation between the Maryland-born chief justice and the Kentucky-born President to which Taney sought to attract as much public attention and support as possible. Taney worked swiftly to hear Ferryman’s petition, issue his writ of habeas corpus, order to the appearance of General Cadwalader and then issued a far-reaching legal decision. The Lincoln Administration effectively ignored him and his agent, Marshal Washington Bonifant, who was turned away at the entrance to Fort McHenry. In his decision, Chief Justice Taney wrote:\n\n“The case, then, is simply this, a military officer, residing in Pennsylvania, issues an order to arrest a citizen of Maryland, upon vague and indefinite charges, without any proof, so far as appears; under this order, his house is entered in the night, he is seized as a prisoner, and conveyed to Fort McHenry, and there is kept in close confinement; and when a habeas corpus is served on t he commanding officer, requiring him to produce the prisoner before a justice of the Supreme Court, in order that he may examine into the legality of the imprisonment, the answer of the officer is, that he is authorized by the president to suspend the write of habeas corpus at his discretion, and in the exercise of that discretion, suspends it in this case, and on that ground refuses obedience to the write….If the authority which the Constitution has confided to the judiciary department and judicial officers, may thus, upon any pretext or under any circumstances, be usurped by the military power at its discretion, the people of the United States no longer living under a government of laws, but every citizen holds life, liberty and property at the will and pleasure of the army officer in whose military district he may happen to be found.”52\n\nLegal scholar James F. Simon wrote: “No wartime U.S. president has ever accepted the impotent constitutional role that Taney assigned to Lincoln.”53 According to Simon. “Taney systematically reduced the president’s constitutional powers to Lilliputian proportions. Here Taney displayed the artistry of a partisan trial lawyer than the detachment of a judge. His interpretation was starkly at odds with Taney’s own reading of presidential power when he had been President Jackson’s Attorney General.” But, noted historian James G. Randall, “It was not the Supreme Court, but Chief Justice Taney in his capacity as circuit justice, hearing the Merryman petition in chambers, who declared the President’s suspension of the habeas corpus privilege to be illegal. His opinion did not become controlling law; it did not even control the Merryman case. In an unpublished and confidential memorandum to Stanton, Attorney General Bates expressed the fear that, if the legality of the President’s suspension were brought up in a test case, the Supreme Court would declare against the power assumed by the President; but the issue was never forced.”54\n\nTaney had his supporters in his home state. “Many Marylanders, some northern sympathizers among them, were outraged by President Lincoln’s suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. They claimed that, according to the Constitution, such action was not a presidential power, but a right of Congress,” wrote historian Howard R. Manakee.55 Taney’s challenge met with their approval. Taney, however, clearly wanted to open judicial war on President Lincoln. James F. Simon wrote: “Taney’s rigid demeanor in court and his single-minded opinion directing Lincoln to obey his order left no doubt that the Chief Justice was intent on forcing a showdown with the president. Once he had written his opinion, he did all in his power to draw attention to it. Without waiting for a response from Lincoln, he made his opinion available to the public. It was published in newspapers and journals throughout the country and, with Taney’s encouragement, printed as a pamphlet.”56 Historian James G. Randall note that “the process of judicial protection and civil procedure were actually complied with — not immediately nor by honoring the Chief Justice’s writ, but within a fairly short time after the prisoner was seized. There was nothing done judicially to punish him, and this fact gives some point to the contention of the Lincoln administration that the courts were too slow and clumsy for handling the dangerous situation.” 57\n\nHistorian David M. Silver wrote: “In midsummer, 1861, Attorney General Bates sent an order of Secretary of War Simon Cameron to the United States district attorney at Baltimore, William M. Addison. It directed the military authorities at Fort McHenry to deliver Merryman to the marshal of the district court if the marshal were properly equipped with a warrant for his arrest on the charge of treason. Merryman was subsequently indicted for treason and his case remitted in November, 1861, to the United States circuit court for Maryland. He was required to put up the sum of $20,000 as a guarantee that he would not renew anti-Union activities. The case went no further; it was continued by the court and ultimately dropped. This was typical of the treatment accorded such cases by the Lincoln administration. When Merryman was no longer capable of harming the Union, Lincoln, who sought no tyranny, gladly washed his hands of the Merryman controversy.”58\n\nBy a 2-1 margin, young Maryland recruits chose the Union over the Confederate army, but the state was pockmarked by Confederate sympathizers and supporters. Historian Sprague noted that after taking the initiative after Fort Sumter, the secession movement in Maryland began to fall apart. “A combination of political, economic and military factors very quickly wrenched control of Maryland from the secessionists and turned the state back into the arms of the Union.”59 Sprague wrote: “As the mood in Baltimore changed, the federal government began repairing the bridges. It was found that their foundations had not been damaged and before the middle of May, the railroads from Philadelphia and Harrisburg were both ready for use.” Slavery’s importance in Maryland had been steadily dropping in the 19th century. Sprague wrote: “Amidst all the excitement and gaety immediately after the Battle of Baltimore, nobody had worried about Baltimore’s trade. But by the end of the first week, the city began to realize what a crippling blow it had dealt itself in burning the bridges. Baltimore was a trading center and its trade was gone. Not only were there no trains, but the ships had left the harbor right after the rioting and had not returned.”60 Nevins wrote that “the mob outbreak and flight of citizens caused a collapse of rents, realty prices, tax receipts and trade.”61\n\nThe Lincoln Administration won a series of small but important electoral victories in the summer of 1861. Unionists were sent to Congress but Henry May defeated Henry Winter Davis for a Baltimore congressional seat on June 13. Lincoln critic William Marvel argued: “Aside from the implied intimidation of the nearby encampments, the June election passed without active military interference — unlike the rest of Maryland’s elections during this war — and in that last relatively free plebiscite, Union candidates of one stripe or another own every congressional seat and most other offices. These results should have offered more assurance that Maryland posed no threat of secession.” Nevertheless, there were secessionist plots and there were rumors of secessionist plots. Marvel attributes many of the rumors to Worthing G. Snethen, who reported from Baltimore for the New York Tribune, and who wrote that Baltimore continued to be a hotbed of secession plotting. Marvel argues that federal authorities overestimated secessionist activity in Maryland and overreacted in suppressing it. “In Maryland the imprisonment of potentially dissident legislators and the shadow of bayonets over the ballot box suggested ultimate mistrust in the democratic process, notwithstanding Lincoln’s later tribute to government of, by, and for the people.”64\n\n“Over the summer of 1861 the hand of the federal government fell firmly on the shoulders of Marylanders,” wrote historian Robert Brugger.65 Federal officials and officers were taking no chances with a repeat of April’s chaos. After the reassignment of General Butler, General Nathaniel Banks and General John A. Dix shared responsibility for the state. Historian David Detzer wrote: ‘Between late April and early September, Maryland came beneath increasing military pressure. Hundreds of individual were imprisoned on suspicion of having secessionist sympathies….During the Civil War federal authorities would eventually jail 2,094 Marylanders — including seventeen owners of newspapers, twenty-nine elected members of the state legislature, countless bankers, merchants, and manufacturers — for such political reasons.”66\n\nAs historian William E. Gienapp wrote: “Lincoln’s policies in Maryland resembled the proverbial iron fist in a velvet glove.”67 There was a continuing effort to subdue disloyal element in Baltimore — including public officials and journalists suspected of disloyalty. Generally, they were kept in custody until a perceived crisis was past and then released. On July 1, General Nathaniel P. Banks wired that he had arrested the Baltimore police board, including George P. Pane, the police chief. Military authorities tried to exercise discretion in the suppression of secession in Maryland. Historian Robert J. Brugger wrote that General John A. “Dix’s rule, like Lincoln’s presidency, exhibited some latitude and humanity under the circumstances. Dix demanded proof of a persons’ alleged disloyalty and discharged some prisoners on insufficient evidence. He advised Union troops not to assume that Marylanders carrying shotguns on a ‘sporting excursion’ were rebel soldiers.”68 At the end of August, Dix wrote Postmaster General Blair after publication of the Baltimore Exchange had been suspended on orders from Washington: “There is no doubt that a majority of the Union men in Baltimore desire the suppression of all the opposition presses in the city but there are many — and among them some of the most discreet — who think differently.. The city is now very quiet and under control though my force is smaller than I asked.”69\n\nHistorian Dean Sprague wrote: “During August, Congressman Henry May of Baltimore had a party for Senator John C. Breckinridge, who had not yet joined the Confederacy, and Congressman Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, a man of brilliant oratory who was completely opposed to the war. During the visit. Breckinridge tried to give a speech from the balcony of Eutaw House, but the crowd in the street was split between Southern Sympathizers and Union men and there was so much shouting, cheering and booing that he could not be heard. A few days later, General Dix issued an order that any person who made a public demonstration ‘by word or deed’ in favor of the Confederate Government was to be arrested.”70 Dix later contended: “A city so prone to burst out into flame and thus become dangerous to its neighbors, should be controlled by the strong arm of the government wherever these paroxysms of excitement occur.”71 On September 4, Dix reported to General McClellan: “No secession flag has to the knowledge of the police been exhibited in Baltimore for many weeks, except a small paper flag displayed by a child from an upper window It was immediately removed by them. They have been instructed to arrest any person who makes a public demonstration by word or deed in favor of the Confederate Government and I have prohibited the exhibition in shop windows of rebel envelopes and music.”72\n\nDix wanted enough force to discourage disloyalty without the necessity to use that force in an intrusive way. In late September 1861, Dix instructed a subordinate in Baltimore: “I do not wish any searches made in private dwellings by the military. I prefer it should be done by the police.”73 Historian Sprague thought the threats overblown. He wrote: “Of all the events that occurred in the Civil War, none is more remarkable than the absolute certainty with which everyone in the North, from the highest officials down to the most lowly newspaper reader, confidently expected an invasion of Maryland, an uprising in Baltimore, and an attack upon Washington in September, 1861. This was the cloud behind which every action was taken in Maryland, and it prompted many things to be done that would never have been done otherwise.” He wrote: “And so panic spread throughout the Administration to President Lincoln and a review was made of the situation to see whether the Maryland legislature should be suppressed. This legislature had met in Frederick immediately after the Battle of Bull Run and even then, with the Confederate army triumphant, no secession move mad been proposed.”74\n\nOn the other hand, noted historian Lawrence M. Denton wrote: “Maryland newspapers carried reports from towns all over the state of public meetings favoring secession. Lincoln’s people, especially the military commanders and spies, read these with growing consternation. In addition, the administration received reports from its commanders in the field that secessionist military units were still drilling throughout Maryland. They also received secret reports regarding the leanings of members of the legislature.”75\n\nThe Maryland legislature had adjourned in Frederick at the beginning of August intending to reconvene in mid-September. Secretary of War Simon Cameron wrote General Banks on September 11: “The passage of any act of secession by the legislature of Maryland must be prevented. If necessary, all or any part of the members must be arrested. Exercise your own judgment as to the time and manner, but do the work effectively.”76 On September 17, General Banks reported that “all members of the Maryland Legislature assembled at Frederick City on the 17th instant known or suspected to be disloyal in their relations to the Government have been arrested.” Historian James G. Randall questioned whether the arrests were wise or necessary but acknowledged the political situation shifted: “Men of the time felt that a hands-off policy of gentleness and of full freedom as in peace time for dangerous plotters was not among the methods practically open to them. Use of stern measures, they felt, was their only choice. Secessionists themselves were none too scrupulous about full democracy.”77\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Hicks supported these arrests, writing Banks, “We can no longer mince matters with these desperate people. I concur in all you have done.” 78 But he had begun to shift his political allegiances in the spring. Historian Lawrence M. Denton wrote: “By the end of May, Governor Hicks, with federal regiments nearly in control of the state, took some bold steps to align himself with the Lincoln administration. On May 30, he ordered all state arms to be seized and turned over to federal….the Maryland military was predominantly pro-Southern and Hicks, knowing who had won the game in Maryland, moved to demonstrate this commitment to the national government.”79\n\nDecades later, Frederick W. Seward recalled that President Lincoln, Secretary of State Seward and General George B. McClellan met with General Banks in Rockville about the upcoming meeting in Maryland State legislature scheduled for September 17 and the prospects that he might authorize the state’s secession. Preventative measures were authorized:\n\n“The Secessionists had by no means given up the hope of dragging Maryland into the Confederacy. The Legislature was to meet at Frederick City on the 17th of September. There was believed to be a disunion majority, and they expected and intended to pass an ordinance of secession. This would be regarded as a call to active revolt by many who were now submitting to Federal rule. In Baltimore and throughout Maryland the bloody experiences of Virginia and Missouri would probably be repeated. Governor Hicks was a loyal Union man, but would be unable to control the Legislature. The Union members were understood to be divided in opinion as to the expedience of going to Frederick to fight the proposed ordinance, or staying away, in the hope of blocking a quorum.”\n\n“The Administration, therefore, had decided to take a bold step that would assuredly prevent the adoption of any such ordinance. To forcibly prevent a legislative body from exercising its functions, of course, saviors of despotism, and is generally so regarded. But when, departing form its legitimate functions, it invites the public enemy to plunge the State into anarchy, its dissolution becomes commendable. So the Administration reasoned and decided.”\n\n“As few persons as possible would be informed beforehand. General Dix and General Banks, commanding respectively the eastern and western portions of the State, were instructed to carefully watch the movements of members of the Legislature who were expected to respond to the summons to Frederick. Loyal Union members would not be interfered with. They would be free to come and go, perform their legislative duties, or stay away, just as they pleased. But disunion members starting to go there would be quietly turned back toward their homes, and would not reach Frederick City at all. The views of each disunion member were pretty well known, and generally rather loudly proclaimed. So there would be little difficulty, as Mr. Lincoln remarked, in ‘separating the sheep from the goats.'”80\n\nLincoln biographer Isaac N. Arnold wrote: “In September 1861, information was communicated to the government that the Legislature of Maryland was to meet, with a view of passing an act of secession. General McClellan was directed to prevent this by the arrest of the members. His order to General Banks, dated September 12th, 1861, says, among other things: ‘When they meet on the 17th, you will please have everything prepared to arrest the whole party and be sure that none escape…If successfully carried out, it will go far towards breaking the backbone of the rebellion….I have but one thing to impress upon you, the absolute necessity of secrecy and success.'” 81 McClellan wrote in his memoirs: “Information from various sources received in Aug. and Sept. 1861, convinced the government that there was serious danger of the secession of Maryland.”\n\n“The secessionists possessed about two-thirds of each branch of the State legislature, and the general government had what it regarded as good reasons for believing that a secret, extra, and illegal session of the legislature was about to be convened at Frederick on the 17th of Sept. in order to pass an ordinance of secession. It was understood that this action was to be supported by an advance of the Southern army across the Potomac….It was impossible to permit the secession of Maryland, intervening, as it did, between the capital and the loyal States, and commanding all our lines of supply and reinforcement. I do not know how the government obtained the information on which they reached their conclusions. I do not know how reliable it was. I only know that at the time it seemed more than probable, and that ordinary prudence required that it should be regarded as certain. So that when I received the orders for the arrest of the most active members of the legislature, for the purpose of preventing the intended meeting and the passage of the act of secession, I gave that order a most full and hearty support as a measure of undoubted military necessity.”\n\n“On the 10th of Sept. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, instructed Gen. Banks to prevent the passage of any act of secession by the Maryland legislature, directing him to arrest all or any number of the members, if necessary, but in any event to do the work effectively.”\n\n“On the same day the Secretary of War instructed Gen. Dix to arrest six conspicuous and active secessionists of Baltimore, three of whom were members of the legislature.”\n\n“The total number of arrests made was about sixteen, and the result was the thorough upsetting of whatever plans the secessionists of Maryland may have entertained. It is needless to say that the arrested parties were ultimately released, and were kindly treated while imprisoned. Their arrest was a military necessity, and they had no cause of complaint. In fact, they might with justice have received much more severe treatment than they did.”82\n\nAmong those arrested early on September 13 on orders from General Dix were Mayor Brown and Congressman May as well as the managers of several pro-secession newspapers. They were imprisoned in Fort McHenry in Baltimore’s harbor. New York Tribune correspondent Worthing G. Snethen rejoiced at the arrests and the suppression of disloyal newspapers, writing to Secretary of State Seward: “I thank you in the name of every truly [sic] man in Baltimore and in my own poor name too for your arrest of the traitors whom you have sent to Fortress Monroe. A great and a good work has been done. Rebellion has received a staggering blow. I hope General Banks will take care that the Legislature shall not sit at all. There are thin-skinned Union men enough who will seek to get a quorum for the sake of the $4 1 day.”83\n\nSeward recalled that as the date of the meeting approached in mid-September, “it was found that no only was no secession ordinance likely to be adopted, but that there seemed to be no Secessionists to present one. The two generals had carried out their instructions faithfully, and with tact and discretion. The Union members returned to their homes rejoicing. No ordinance was adopted, Baltimore remained quiet, and Maryland stayed in the Union.”84\n\nHistorian Christopher Dell wrote: “On September 18, a majority report was submitted to the Maryland State Assembly by Chairman S. Teakle Wallace of the Committee on Federal Relations, taking strong ground against the Union cause and against the doctrine of military necessity as a basis in suspension of certain civil liberties. On orders from General McClellan, General Dix moved against the legislature, September 18, with the object of arresting every member favoring the report. When the action was opposed by the officers of the Assembly and the State Senate they were also arrested.”85\n\nHistorian Mark E. Neely, Jr. discredits reports that President Lincoln ordered the Baltimore and legislative arrests: “It is possible that Seward instigated the arrests, perhaps on the strength of detectives’ reports of the intentions of some Maryland political leaders. Neither the victim of the arrests ‘S. Teackle Wallis — nor Lincoln’s political foe — McClellan — implicated the president in the planning. And for his part, Frederick Seward, who was hazy on the details, certainly had an interest in laying responsibility for the plan on his father’s superior rather than on his father. If William H. Seward did cause the arrests of the Maryland legislators, it was an action fully in keeping with his reputation for ruthless suppression of civil liberties during the Civil War.”86\n\nJohn W. Davis, former Baltimore police commissioner, wrote to President Lincoln about his arrest on July 1 with the entire Baltimore police board, and his subsequent imprisonment at Fort McHenry. On or about September 15, President Lincoln wrote out a reply to Davis in the third person: “The President has read this letter; and he deeply commiserates [sic] the condition of any one so distressed as the writer seems to be. He does not know Mr. Davis — only knows him to be one of the arrested Police Commissioners of Baltimore because he says so in this letter. Assuming him to be one of those Commissioners, the President understands Mr. Davis could at the time of his arrest, could at any time since, and can now, be released by taking a full oath of allegiance to the Government of the United States; and that Mr. Davis has not been kept in ignorance of this condition of release. If Mr. Davis is still so hostile to the Government, and so determined to aid its’ enemies in destroying it, he makes his own choice.”87\n\nAbout the same time, Mr. Lincoln issued a public statement: “The public safety renders it necessary that the grounds of these arrests should at present be withheld, but at the proper time they will be made public. Of one thing the people of Maryland may rest assured: that no arrest has been made, or will be made, not based on substantial and unmistakable complicity with those in armed rebellion against the Government of the United States. In no case has an arrest been made on mere suspicion, or through personal or partisan animosities, but in all cases the Government is in possession of tangible and unmistakable evidence, which will, when made public, be satisfactory to every loyal citizen.”88\n\nDavis wrote again to President Lincoln on September 21: “I had the honor to address you on the 11th inst. in reference to my continued imprisonment here. I did not ask for my release; but I made an appeal to your Excellency on the grounds of humanity, to order my removal to some other place of detention, at which I might have the privilege, which is not denied to condemned felons of the deepest criminality; that of occasionally seeing my wife and children.”\n\n“On the 18th my letter was returned to me by the officer in command of this Post, with an endorsement upon it without signature, date, or place, but I presume authorized by you, stating that your Excellency had read it, and that you deeply commiserated the condition of one so distressed as the writer seemed to be, — It further stated that ‘the President understands Mr. Davis could at the time of his arrest, could at any time since, and can now be released by taking a full oath of allegiance to the government of the United States, and that Mr. Davis has not been kept in ignorance of this condition of release.– If Mr. Davis is still so hostile to the government, and so determined to aid its enemies in destroying it, — he makes his own choice.'”\n\n“Allow me Sir, respectfully to say, that your Excellency has been somewhat misinformed, — I aver most positively that neither previous to, nor at the time of my arrest was I informed that I could avoid imprisonment by taking an oath of allegiance, or by complying with any other condition, nor has any such intimation been ever given to me, before the return to me of my letter on the 18th inst, except that once at Fort McHenry, some two weeks after my arrest, Col. Morris remarked in a conversation which I considered entirely jocular, and to which I paid no serious attention, that if I chose to take the oath of allegiance, I might obtain my liberty.”\n\n“It would be out of place for me to say anything to your Excellency upon the general question of the policy adopted by the Government of prescribing an oath of allegiance, as a condition of their release from imprisonment, to citizens of the United States, not holding any office under the Government, and who have been arrested and are detained as ‘State Prisoners’ on no specified allegations of offense, ever made known to them. But Sir, in justice to myself you will I hope permit me to say, that it does not seem just, to infer, if I shall hesitate or even decline to take a ‘full oath of allegiance to the government of the U. S.’ that I am either hostile to the government, or that I am even disposed, still less determined, in any way to aid its enemies in destroying it.”\n\n“I have in fact never done any act either of hostility to the Government, or designed to aid its enemies in destroying it. — But with regard to taking an unqualified oath of allegiance to it, your Excellency may perhaps not be aware of the peculiar phraseology of the oath prescribed by the Constitution of my native State of Maryland, adopted in 1850, and of course without reference to, or any anticipation of the present troubles.– As one of the Police Commissioners of Baltimore, I was by Law expressly required to take, and I feel it to be still binding upon me.– The language of it is, (I write from memory, but I am satisfied correctly) that ‘I will support the Constitution and Laws of the United States; and that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to the State of Maryland, and will support the Constitution and Laws thereof.’ Without pretending to enter into any argument I appeal confidently to your Excellency to judge whether you cannot believe that a conscientious man who duly regards the solemn and binding force of an oath, may not have some scruples, however ill founded they might appear to others, in taking an absolute and unqualified oath of allegiance even to the United States and the Government of the same, whilst the previous oath above referred to, voluntarily taken in pursuance of Law, still remains uncancelled against him, on the records of Divine and human tribunals.”\n\n“Moreover Sir, and independent of all other considerations I would not like to obtain my liberty now, by taking the oath of allegiance for the following reasons.– I have since the 1st day of July last, been kept in custody, by the orders of the Government,– the Grand Jury of the U. S. Court were in constant session for some weeks after my arrest, but found no grounds for preferring any charge against me; but notwithstanding this, and altho’ so far as I am aware, no other attempt has been made to investigate my case, I have been denounced throughout the land as a criminal, and there is perhaps scarcely a newspaper in the country in which my name has not been published as such. Now Sir, the dearest if not the only heritage I may have to leave to my children will by my name unsullied, and reputation unblemished, to clear these from every thing like a stain, I now chiefly and most earnestly desire a full and fair examination of my past conduct, and an investigation of every charge that can be brought against me. If I cannot obtain this the least justice that can be rendered to me, would in my humble apprehension, be my free, honorable, and unconditional release.– For, Sir, it does seem to me, that if after an imprisonment of nearly three months, I were to procure my release by taking an oath in reference to my future conduct, my compliance with that, as with any other condition whatever, might perhaps be construed into an admission by me that something in my past life, justified the imposition of such an obligation upon me. As I am not conscious of ever having committed an illegal act against the Government, or of having given it any just cause of complaint against me, I naturally feel averse to subjecting myself to any such imputation. With the foregoing statement of facts I beg that you will at least, grant me the favor sought for in my former communication, for which I shall be truly thankful.”89\n\nUnion officials were also worried about the upcoming election when a successor to Governor Hicks and a new legislature would be chosen. Unionist Augustus W. Bradford faced States Rights candidate Benjamin C. Howard in the gubernatorial contest . Historian Harold Manakee wrote that “military authorities determined that only those loyal to the Union should have the right to vote. The former names of political parties disappeared. Those citizens, most of them Republicans, who favored continuing the war now called themselves the Union Party. Southern sympathizers, those believing in states’ rights and others organized the Peace Party.”90 Union troops were furloughed so they could vote. General McClellan also ordered General Banks and General Dix to be sure that Union soldiers were deployed on election day to make sure that Union loyalists were not discouraged by secessionists. Provost marshals were deployed at the polls. With this strong use of military force, the election went off relatively quietly; Bradford and Unionist legislative candidates triumphed easily. In mid-November 1861, President Lincoln replied to a delegation of Baltimore citizens: “I thank you for the address you have presented to me in behalf of the people of Baltimore. I have deplored the calamities which the sympathies of some misguided citizens of Maryland had brought down upon that patriotic and heretofore flourishing State. The prosperity of Baltimore up to the 19th of April last, was one of the wonders produced by the American Union. He who strangles himself, for whatever motive, is not more unreasonable than were those citizens of Baltimore who, in a single night, destroyed the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Northern Pennsylvania Railroad, and the railroad from Baltimore to Philadelphia. From the day when that mad transactions occurred, the Government of the United States has been diligently engaged in endeavoring to restore those great avenues to their former usefulness, and, at the time, to save Baltimore and Maryland from the danger of complete ruin through an unnecessary and unnatural rebellion.\n\nI congratulate you upon the declaration which the people of Baltimore and Maryland have made in the recent election, of their recent approbation of the Federal Government, and of their enduring loyalty to the Union. I regard the results of these elections as auspicious of returning loyalty throughout all the insurrectionary States.\n\nYour wishes for a fair participation by the mechanics and laboring men of Baltimore in the benefits of supplying the Government with materials and provisions are reasonable and just. They have deserved that participation. Loyalty has involved them in some danger, and has demanded of them some sacrifices. Their wishes, as you have communicated them, shall be referred to the proper Departments, and I am sure that every member of the Administration will cheerfully lend his aid to carry them out so far as it can be done consistently with the prudence and economy which ought always to regulate the public service.91\n\nIn his annual message to Congress on December 3, 1861, Mr. Lincoln reported: “The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason and Dixon’s line; and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on the point. This, however, was soon settled definitely and on the right side, South of the line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made to seem against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up, within her limits; and we were many days, at one time, without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now, her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union, by a larger majority, and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate, or any question.”92\n\nMr. Lincoln contrived to seek a balance between public order and private liberties in Maryland. At one point at the beginning of 1862, Mr. Lincoln drafted but did not issue a proclamation to the People of Maryland: “In view of the recent declaration of the people of Maryland of their adhesion to the Union so distinctly made in their recent election [November 6, 1861], the President directs that all the political prisoners who having heretofore been arrested in that State are now detained in military custody by the President’s authority be released from their imprisonment on the following conditions, namely: That if they were holding any civil or military offices when arrested the terms of which have not expired they shall not resume or reclaim such offices; and secondly, all persons availing themselves of this proclamation shall engage by oath or parole of honor to maintain the Union and the Constitution of the United States, and in no way to aid or abet by arms, counsel, conversation or information of any kind the existing insurrection against the Government of the United States. To guard against misapprehension it is proper to state that this proclamation does not apply to prisoners of war.”93\n\nIf the situation in Maryland wasn’t difficult enough in 1861, for the rest of the Civil War, Mr. Lincoln had to confront a cantankerous cast of civil and military leaders in the state, beginning with his own postmaster general, Montgomery Blair. Historian Richard N. Current wrote that “Blair, a tall lean, hatchet-faced man with small and deep-set eyes, always spoke of secessionists deliberately but defiantly, though the family had many secessionist relatives. In his cold animus there was not a trace of the abolitionist spirit. True, he had won the respect fo some abolitionists by serving as counsel for the slave Dred Scott, but he was no Negrophile. His racist convictions were as strong as his Unionist convictions, and these were strong indeed.”94\n\nHistorian Adam I. P. Smith wrote: “From their Jacksonian heritage, the Blairs derived a fiercely nationalist rhetoric. After he was appointed to Lincoln’s cabinet, Montgomery Blair declared, “I am for the Union, now and forever, and against all its enemies, whether fire-eaters or abolitionists.’…Blair was well aware of the need for administration to maintain the support of fervent Unionists like himself who retained a deep suspicion of the radicals and their plans. In Maryland he had been helping to build a Union organization of former Whigs, Know-Nothings, and Democrats under the banner of supporting the war to restore the Union as it was. As an old Free Soiler, Blair did not oppose the idea of freeing the slaves per se, but feared that the Emancipation Proclamation would polarize politics, making it appear that the purpose of the war was to revolutionize the South rather than merely to restore the Union.”95\n\nBecause of their proximity to Washington, Maryland politicians were particularly difficult for President Lincoln to evade or to please. Their attitudes toward slavery and the Union spanned a wide spectrum. Montgomery Blair’s political opposite in Maryland was Baltimore Congressman Henry Winter Davis. Technically, Davis was not even a Republican at the time he aspired to the Cabinet in early 1861. Historian Allan Nevins wrote that Davis’ “emotional instability reflected his intense ambition for national prominence and personal advancement. He had allied himself in succession with the Whigs, Know-Nothings, Republicans, Bell-Everett men, and Radical Republicans, consistent only in seeking to further his own career. He had never failed to cherish the dream that he might ultimately become President.”96\n\nJournalist Noah Brooks described Davis as “eloquent and able man, but, except for his record as a persistent and violent critic of Lincoln’s reconstruction policy, he has not left any lasting trace of his public career. At that time he as about forty-five years of age. Light in complexion, with a round, boyish head, sandy hair and mustache. He had a high, clear, ringing voice, and a manner of speaking which was peculiar in its sharpness and firmness. He was a brilliant speaker, but not a ready debater; and he had a compact and direct way of putting things which always commanded close attention whenever he spoke.”97\n\nPresident Lincoln later claimed that “in the formation of his cabinet, he was for some days balancing between Montgomery Blair and Henry Winter Davis, and finally settled on Mr. Blair….that in the disposition of the Maryland patronage, he had, as far as possible, met the wishes of Mr. Davis. Subsequently, he regarded Mr. Davis as holding ground not the most favorable to the best interests of the country. Still later, that gentleman made a speech in the House which wholly disabused his mind, and he was greatly rejoiced to find his first opinion of him correct. In Mr. Davis’s contest for Congress, he had rendered him all the aid he consistently could. He also understood that Mr. Chase favored Mr. Davis’s Union opponent. Since that election, Mr. Davis had desired some aid in the Maryland constitutional election, which he could not see his way to afford him, and Mr. Davis had become very cool towards him.”98\n\nThe political situation in Maryland worsened in 1863 — particularly as elections in November approached. Historian Jean H. Baker wrote: “Behind the Unionist split in 1863 lay the conflicting ambitions, personalities, and past political choices of two state leaders — Henry Winter Davis,…and Montgomery Blair, Lincoln’s Postmaster General. As part of a larger design to realign American political parties, both men wished to direct Maryland’s Unionist organization, and such a contest helped to create, and then to continue, the split between Conservatives and Unconditionals.” Blair’s patronage power was great. “As Postmaster General, the efficient Blair managed a vast network of 27,000 officeholders. The 500 postal employees who ran Maryland’s postal service gave Blair control over the largest group of federal or state appointments in the state. This federal patronage served as the fulcrum for Blair’s attempts to direct the Union party of Maryland,” wrote Baker. “Not satisfied with this supply of officeholders, Blair tried to dominate other Lincoln appointments. In this, the postmaster was not entirely successful, and he ended in sharing these positions with the supporters of Henry Winter Davis.” 99 Historian William E. Gienapp observed of this fight that President “Lincoln tried as much as possible to keep out of this fight, which he viewed as largely personal. Again, he steered a middle course, taking a more radical stand on emancipation than Blair, whom he removed from the Cabinet in 1864, yet unwilling to go as far as Davis and the radicals on this and related questions.”100\n\nOn October 3, 1683 Postmaster General Blair gave a speech in Rockville, Maryland, which attracted attention and criticism throughout the north. He attacked “ultra” abolitionists in Congress who were interfering with reconstruction policies of the administration. Among his clear targets was Massachusetts Senator Charles who had recently written an article in the Atlantic Monthly proclaiming his theory that southern states had committed political suicide when they seceded. Lincoln scholar John Waugh wrote: “It was a funeral Montgomery Blair had in mind when he went to Rockville, Maryland, in early October to address a Union Party meeting. The intended corpse was [Charles] Sumner’s congressional-supremacy thesis. Just when it appeared peace was nearly won, the rebellion destroyed, and slavery suppressed, Blair began, ‘we are menaced by the ambition of the ultra-Abolitionists, which is equally despotic in its tendencies and which, if successful could not fail to be alike fatal to Republican institutions.”101\n\nHistorian Ernest Smith wrote “Montgomery Blair…attacked the ultra-abolitionists\n\nand Radicals whose policy he conceived to be entirely out of harmony with that of the President. Bates thought that Blair courted the President assiduously in 1863 in order to retain his good opinion while he appealed to the Democrats for their support. Montgomery Blair, he said, was looking for jobs for his family whether the country went Republican or Democrats in the elections. Bates was unjust to Blair, inasmuch as Blair was begging his friend through letters to keep the Republicans in power to guarantee the end of slavery, and was supporting the President at every turn while he was attempting to organize a Republican party in the border states. Nevertheless, Bates noted that Blair yielded ready assent to whatever the President proposed. He certainly must have felt assured that his speech would be favorably received at the White House. His speeches in New York and Cleveland were in defense of the president and his proclamation.”102\n\nAccording to historian William C. Harris, Blair “attempted to relieve some of the Radical pressure on the president with a shrill and ill-advised speech at Rockville, Maryland. Entitled a ‘Speech on The Revolutionary Schemes of the Ultra Abolitionists, and in Defense of the Policy of the President,’ Blair, though supporting emancipation, charged that the Radicals ‘would make the manumission of the slaves the means of infusing their blood into our whole systems by blending with it ‘amalgamation, equality, and fraternity.'”103 Blair maintained: “The Slavocrats of the South would found an oligarchy — a sort of feudal power imposing its yoke over all who tilled the earth over which they reigned as masters. The Abolition party whilst pronouncing philippics against slavery, seek to make a caste of another color by amalgamating the black element with the free white labor of our land, and so to expand far beyond the present confines of slavery the evil which makes it obnoxious to republican statesmen. And now, when the strength of the traitors who attempted to embody a power out of the interests of slavery to overthrow the Government is seen to fail, they would make the manumission of the slaves the means of infusing their blood into our whole system by blending with it amalgamation, equality, and fraternity.'”104\n\nIn the speech Blair maintained that the Southern states were only “paralysed” in their relationship to the Union — awaiting the moment “for resurrection in the persons of their loyal people.” Blair was seeking to create a new political alliance — separate from the secessionists and radicals he despised. According to historian Jean H. Baker, “In Montgomery’s view, Democrats, Unionists, former Whigs, and Know-Nothings could all meet on a platform of Constitution and Union. Such a strategy rested on the conviction that Southerners would rally behind a Unionist party which effectively isolated extremists of both sections.”105\n\nPennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens typified the reaction of Radical Republicans to the Blair speech. Stevens wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase: “I have read with more sorrow than surprise the vile speech made by the P.M. Genl. It is much more infamous than any speech made by a Copperhead orator. I know of no rebel sympathizer who has charged such disgusting principles and designs on the Republican party as this apostate. It has and will do us more harm at the election than all the efforts of the Opposition. If these are the principles of the Administration no earnest Anti-Slavery man will wish it to be sustained. If such men are to be retained in Mr. Lincoln’s Cabinet, it is time we were consulting about his successor.”106 California journalist Noah Brooks wrote:\n\n“There is but one expression, and that of reprobation, toward Postmaster General Blair for his extraordinary course, and it now remains to be seen whether Lincoln will sacrifice his chances of a renomination by tacitly indorsing Blair’s ratiocinations by retaining him in the Cabinet. Although he was appointed to his place upon the urgent request of such radicals as Sumner and Wilson, against whom he now turns, we cannot expect that any sense of obligation to them would induce him to modify his own private views or restrain his public utterances. Good faith is not a characteristic trait of the Blair family. But good sense, at least, might have restrained him from loading his own wrong-headed opinions upon the Administration of which he is a member. Soon after the Pennsylvania election Judge [William D.] Kelley, of Philadelphia, and John W. Forney called upon the President with their congratulations — and Forney, with his usual outspoken candor, very plainly said to the President, Blair being then present, that his conservative friend Governor Curtin desired the President to know that if the Rockville speech of Postmaster General Blair had been made thirty days earlier it would have lost the Union ticket in Pennsylvania twenty thousand votes. He also expressed his astonishment to Blair that he, a Cabinet Minister, should have the hardihood to utter such sentiments in public, just on the even of important elections in other States, as those of the Rockville speech. Blair responded that whatever Forney might think of the matter, he had only spoken at Rockville his honest sentiments. ‘Then,’ said the impetuous Forney, turning upon him, ‘why don’t you leave the Cabinet,’ and not load down with your individual and peculiar sentiments the Administration to which you belong?’107\n\nOn November 1, aide John Hay “handed the President’ Blair’s Rockville speech, telling him I had read it carefully and saving a few intemperate and unwise personal expressions against leading Republicans which might better have been omitted, I saw nothing in the speech which could have given rise to such violent criticism.”\n\n“Really” says the President “the controversy between the two sets of men, represented by him and by Mr. Sumner is one of mere form and little else. I do not think Mr. Blair would agree that the states in rebellion are to be permitted to come at once into the political family & renew the very performances which have already so bedeviled us. I do not think Mr. [Charles] Sumner would insist that when the loyal people of a state obtain the supremacy in their councils & are ready to assume the direction of their own affairs, that they should be excluded. I do not understand Mr. Blair to admit that Jefferson [Davis] may take his seat in Congress again as a Representative of his people; I do not understand Mr Sumner to assert that [Virginia Unionist] John Minor Botts may not. So far as I understand Mr Sumner he seems in favor of Congress taking from the Executive the power it at present exercises over insurrectionary districts, and assuming it to itself. But when the vital question arises as to the right and privilege of the people of these states to govern themselves, I apprehend there will be little difference among loyal men. The question at once is presented in whom this power is vested. And the practical matter for decision is how to keep the rebellious populations from overwhelming and outvoting the loyal minority.”\n\nI asked him if Blair was really opposed to our Union ticket in Maryland. He said he did not know anything about it — had never asked: he says [John W.] Crisfield plainly told him he was opposed to the Administration.108\n\nThe Blair family continued to rock the political boat. In late December 1863, journalist Noah Brooks wrote, “The Blair Family are thrusting themselves upon Mr. Lincoln, as his natural allies, so that it is difficult for people to believe that they are not the exponents of his policy, but he knows and seems to care nothing about their political views. He tolerates Montgomery Blair in the cabinet because he is efficient in his Department, but, to my certain knowledge, he never read his Rockville speech until months after it was delivered. He appears to care nothing at all about the political opinions of his cabinet provided they are useful in the separate departments. But Blair, though a good Postmaster General, is the meanest man in the whole government.”109\n\nThe controversy was epitomized by the continuing conflict between Blair and Henry Winter Davis. Davis hated Democrats and former Democrats — so his antagonism to Blair came naturally. Historian Jean H. Baker noted: “What Blair’s Negrophobia was to his Union party, Davis’s hatred of the Democrats was to his politics.”110 Since both men were accomplished haters, they made President Lincoln’s political life difficult. Davis was a firm opponent of colonization. It “was, in Davis’s view, ‘simple craziness — Expel four millions of people? Where are the ships? Where is the land that will receive them? Where are the people that will pay taxes to remove them? Who will cultivate the deserted regions that they leave?'”111\n\nDavis was a talented but vindictive politician. “Of the members of the House during the war period, Henry Winter Davis was the most accomplished speaker,” wrote fellow Congressman George S. Boutwell in his memoirs. “His courage was constitutional and he was ready to make good his positions whether by argument or blows. His speeches in the delivery were very attractive.” 112 There was an unattractive side to Davis’s speeches. “Left out of Congress by the Maryland election of 1861, Davis employed the next two years in delivering anti-Administration speeches all over the East. He resumed his diatribes as soon as he reentered the House in 1863. It was not the Blairs and Lincoln alone that he attacked, for he indicted Seward, Gideon Welles, and all moderate editors, governors, and Congressmen as hotly.” 113 Davis could turn a very mean phrase. In February 1864, Davis charged that “the President has called on General Banks to organize another hermaphrodite government, half military, half republican, representing the alligators and the frogs of Louisiana, and to place that upon the footing of a government of a State of the United States.”114 That meanness was turned on many opponents. “Even before the war, many Marylanders had viewed Davis’s nativism and his occasional verbal excesses on the dangers of immigration and Roman Catholicism as indicative of his extremism,” wrote historian Jean H. Baker. “Convinced of the rectitude of his own positions, he displayed characteristic arrogance toward those who disagreed with him. Opponents were ‘fools,’ chattering, whining, and timorous merchants,’ ‘mutton heads,’ and even ‘rattlesnakes.'”115\n\n“It is a matter of regret that a man of so much oratorical ability and legal sharpness as Henry Winter Davis should be so much of a politician charlatan as he is; but he is, like the Blairs, insatiate in his hates, mischievous in his schemes and hollow hearted and cold blooded,” wrote journalist Noah Brooks. “Revengeful, sore-headed and proud, Davis, like others of his sort here, appears to forget that the defeat of Lincoln, the nominee of the people and the Union organization, would necessarily be the triumph of a copper-head minority, under whose rule the status of these individuals would be worse than it now is under an Administration which has failed to satisfy their personal demands…” 116 Historian Jean Baker observed that “Davis’s congressional career earned him national prominence, but not the adulation of his fellow Marylanders, many of whom disliked his ‘extremists’ stands. In 1860, Davis’s support of William Pennington for Speaker led to his censure by the Maryland legislature, and in 1864, Davis further alienated Marylanders by his sponsorship of the Wade-Davis Bill, which gave Congress control of the process of Reconstruction and made more difficult the return of seceded states to the Union.”117\n\nAt the other end of the political spectrum in Maryland was unpredictable Reverdy Johnson, who returned to the Senate after defeating Davis in a legislative election in March 1861. Johnson had a long political career dating back to service as a Whig Senator when Mr. Lincoln served in Congress. He had also served Attorney General (1849-50) under President Zachary Taylor, A respected constitutional lawyer, he was opposing counsel in McCormick patent case in which Lincoln participated, defense counsel in Dred Scott case, and counsel for Mary Surratt in the assassination conspiracy trial in 1865. In 1860, he was a key supporter of Stephen Douglas in 1860. Johnson was erratic on slavery issues; he started war as pro-slavery Democrat and opposed emancipation in District of Colombia in 1862. Johnson served as Secretary of State Seward’s representative in New Orleans in 1862 to resolve diplomatic disputes with General Benjamin Butler, who considered him a secessionist at heart. He supported President Lincoln against Chief Justice Taney on habeas corpus, but Johnson was unpredictable.\n\nAlso troublesome was Unionist Congressman John W. Crisfield, a prominent Maryland slaveholder who represented a district with strong secessionist leanings. On July 12, 1862, President LIncoln urged congressmen from Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri to support a plan for compensated emancipation in border states. When Congressman Crisfield was at the White House one day in July 1862, Mr. Lincoln said: ‘Well, Crisfield, how are you getting along with your report, have you written it yet?’ Mr. Crisfield replied that he had not.” President Lincoln told him “You had better come to an agreement.” The price of slaves “will never be higher.”118 Crisfield and a majority of the congressman rejected the proposal. Crisfield broke with President Lincoln over emancipation and was defeated in 1863 in an election that Crisfield claimed had been determined by military intervention.\n\nIn June 1862, Crisfeld pressured President Lincoln to release Judge Richard B. Carmichael, who had been arrested by military authorities for disloyalty. President Lincoln responded: “I have been considering the appeal made by yourself, and Senator [James A.] Pearce in behalf of Judge Carmichael. His charge to the Grand-Jury, was left with me by the Senator, and on reading it, I must confess I was not very favorably impressed towards the Judge. The object of the charge, I understand, was to procure prosecutions [sic], and punishment of some men for arresting, or doing violence to some secessionists — that is, the Judge was trying to help a little, by giving the protection of law to those who were endeavoring [sic] to overthrow the Supreme law — trying if he could find a safe place for certain men to stand on the constitution, whilst they should stab it in another place.” Nevertheless, “The Secretary of War and I have agreed that if the Judge will take the oath of allegiance, usually taken in such cases, he may be discharged.”119 More than five months later, Judge Carmichael was finally released.\n\nMaryland residents were seldom happy with the Union commander of their department. They despised General Butler in April 1861. In 1862, they took out their frustrations on Union commander John Wool. He was eventually transferred north to New York City in January 1863. On October 31, 1862, Thomas Hicks, now a U.S. senator, wrote President Lincoln:\n\n“On returning to this place last evening, I found, our "
