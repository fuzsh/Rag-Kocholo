A Vision for London Biggin Hill Airport

The Government envisages Biggin Hill as an airport open for the whole community, ones that meets the needs of:

Flying Training

Private & Corporate Aviation

Passenger Flights to European destinations

LBHAL supports the Government�s overall proposals for the airport which will provide a helpful contribution to meeting the runway capacity issues in the S.E. The proposals open up the airport for use by members of the public, once again giving them quick and convenient access to European flights and avoiding the congestion of the big London airports.

The proposals would also help to reduce existing surface journeys to other airports, and provide many social benefits including, convenience for local travellers, increased employment opportunities, securing the airport�s economic contribution to south London and recognising the environmental concerns expressed by residents in the past.

London's Only Business Airport

Biggin Hill has 1,800m / 6,000ft runway that is long enough to accommodate bizjets up to and including GV, Global Express, Airbus A319CJ and Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and no runway slots are needed.

The Airport enjoys a prime location just 12 miles from Central London and within easy reach of the motorway network.

Biggin Hill Executive Aircraft Handling offer a dedicated, discreet and professional service to facilitate your aircraft turnaround, and can facilitate maintenance and hangar facilities, aircraft and helicopter charter, limousine service, hotel accommodation, executive inflight catering.... In short, Biggin Hill meets and exceeds the needs of the operators of corporate, fractional, private and charter aircraft that visit Biggin Hill every day from all over the World.

General Aviation at Biggin Hill

There are a number of flying clubs and schools at Biggin Hill offering flying training, and for the established pilot, there are hangar and maintenance providers, parts suppliers and the Biggin Hill Private Owners Association to keep you up to date with what's happening on the Airport and in the GA community.

History:

Over the past 40 years, this famous Airport has steadily changed from being a busy RAF base into a commercial regional airport. The historic ties are remembered annually at the international Biggin Hill Air Show. A summary of the history since it opened in 1917 as a communications base is as follows:-

1920s Commenced flying.

1930s Existing north-east south-west runway opened.

1940s Battle of Britain air station with Spitfires and Hurricanes.

1950s Front line RAF Station with squadrons of jet fighters.

1960s Following closure of Croydon Airport, started as a civil airport with HM Immigration and Customs Port of Entry, with light aircraft training and some commercial passenger and cargo flights.

1970s Acquired by Bromley Council from the RAF for ?480,000 in total (?3,342,000 at today�s prices) with a commitment to remain open as an airport. Light aircraft, flying training and commercial passenger and cargo flights increased.

1980s Operated by the Council as a civil airport with up to 200,000 light aircraft flights per annum. Commercial, scheduled and/or charter passenger flights permitted.

1988 The Council introduced Airports UK, an airport management company, in a bid to increase revenues, but under a legal clause in their agreement, the Council banned them from permitting scheduled passenger flights altogether. Charter flights were still permitted and members of the public still had the freedom to buy tickets to fly on them.

1990s With financial pressure to invest more and more ratepayers� money to meet repairs and operating costs, the Council reversed its decision on scheduled flights in 1991 and actively supported new passenger services. The first regular flights on which the public could buy tickets were to Carlisle and Le Touquet, with services to Manchester, Paris and many other cities planned.

1994 Unfortunately the measures to increase regular public transport flights did not resolve the financial difficulties of the Airport quickly.

The Council was then prevented by Government policy from spending more ratepayers� money on repairs, equipment and running costs, so it sold the Airport business �as a going concern� to London Biggin Hill Airport Limited (BHAL). The Airfield was leased for 125 years, on condition that all future costs and repairs would be borne by BHAL, with rent and a share of the profits going to the Council each year.

The Airport itself has contributed more than ?750,000 in rent and council share of turnover since 1994 and together with the tenants have added another ?3 million by way of rates. There were no specific limitations on scheduled or charter flights in the Business Sale Agreement or Lease, or any public consultations or statements by the Council about its plans to prevent members of the public in future from buying a ticket to fly from the Airport in the future.

2000 Some six years after the Airport sale to BHAL, Bromley Council sought to ban individual fare paying passengers from using the Airport, saying that it had not been their intention to permit the operation of aircraft carrying individual fare paying passengers in 1994, but that they would consider applications on a �case by case� basis.

2002 The matter is still not finally resolved and flights on which individuals can buy a ticket have not yet been approved by the Council. The Minister of Transport has requested that the Council and the Airport each consider and respond to the Government�s new consultation paper on UK runway capacity before concluding the dispute.

2003 Government publishes White Paper 'The Future of Aviation' which sets out a 30 year policy framework for UK airport development.
