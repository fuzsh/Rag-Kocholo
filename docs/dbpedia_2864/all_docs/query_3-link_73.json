At the antecedent valuation date anything concerning the current market conditions that would have been in the knowledge of a potential bidder for an airport at that date can be had regard to, in as much as they would fall to be reflected in the valuation.\n\nUnit of Assessment\n\nIt is imperative when valuing an airport for rating purposes that facts regarding the unit of assessment are certain from the outset. The airport hereditament will comprise all those parts of the premises over which the airport operator has paramount control. The degree of control will vary from airport to airport, but in normal circumstances the following will usually be included: -\n\na. The runways, taxi-ways and aprons (the pavements).\n\nb. The terminal or administration building and other buildings occupied by the operator.\n\nc. The Visual Control Room (VCR) or Air-traffic Control Room (ATC) unless separately assessed to NATS or some other air traffic controller.\n\nd. The Fire Station or garaging for fire vehicles and equipment.\n\ne. All those parts of the buildings and land occupied by other parties but under the paramount control of the airport operator such as retail or catering concessions. There must be sufficient control exercised by the airport operator over the concessionaires as to demonstrate de facto that the airport operator is in paramount occupation.\n\nThree distinct types of retail occupation can be identified within airport terminals. These are Tax Free Shops, Retail Concessions and Catering Concessions. The terms of their occupations can be described as follows:\n\ni) Tax Free Shops - these are often occupied under Management Agreements whereby the Airport operator stocks the shops at its own expense and pays a management company to operate the shop. The company is normally paid on a percentage of turnover basis but the receipts and outgoings will be included in the Airport operator accounts. Duty Free shops are sometimes part of the circulation space where passengers are required to go through in order to gain access to the departure lounge.\n\nii) Retail concessions - these agreements contain stringent conditions to the extent that the Airport Authority retains paramount occupation.\n\niii) Catering Concessions - these have similar conditions imposed to the retail concessions and consequently the airport authority will retain paramount control.\n\nf. All land within the boundaries of the airport, including common user car parks and roads, both ‘landside’ and ‘airside’, other than separately assessed sites.\n\ng. Advertising rights within the terminal footprint which let on a concession type agreement will be reflected in the main assessment. The following will normally be excluded from the airport assessment and separately assessed: -\n\na. Crown Occupation, for Customs or Immigration exclusive use. ‘Red’ and ‘green’ channels which are also used for passenger circulation should be included in the main airport assessment as Customs do not have exclusive occupation in these areas.\n\nb. Local Authority occupations, for instance, police units etc.\n\nc. Any offices, shops, checkouts, catering facilities etc. let out on normal tenancy agreements.\n\nd. Hangars together with their own roads or aprons, stores, offices, warehouses, workshops, open storage or parking areas etc., let out on normal tenancy agreements, the occupier having exclusive possession.\n\ne. Fuel farms operated by independent oil companies.\n\nf. NATS or some other air traffic controlled and occupied ATC where occupied under a lease.\n\nChanges of occupation within airports are frequent and will often involve amendment of the main airport assessment. Close liaison is therefore necessary between Non Domestic Rating Units and NVU in order to keep abreast of the changes. Personal contact channels should be established and fostered.\n\n2 - The Contractor’s Basis\n\nDespite the move towards commercial viability the chosen basis of valuation for all civil airports remains the contractor’s basis. This is because these hereditaments are rarely, if ever, let and data for alternative valuation methodologies is unlikely to be forthcoming.\n\nIn all the airport cases listed above under paragraph 5 (Legal Framework) the contractor’s basis was adopted and was not in dispute.\n\nHowever rental evidence may be available on categories B2, C and D and in these cases, comparative valuations should be prepared and liaison with the NVU should take place before an assessment is finalised.\n\nAirports should not be valued on a Receipts and Expenditure basis.\n\n3 - Consideration of the Valuation Stages\n\nThe principles of the contractor’s basis in Rating Manual section 4: part 3 are followed for Civil Airports and this forms the basis of the Memorandum of Agreement agreed with the User Group.\n\nIn turn the basis and the memorandum are used as a framework for the minor airports with appropriate adaptation. The elements that make up the contractor’s basis and their application to the different categories of airport are discussed below:\n\nBuildings\n\nThe basis will be the estimated replacement cost for the building, or a substitute building approach may be appropriate. Allowances should be made for any age related disabilities, if applicable. In addition if there is functional obsolescence or excessive accommodation it may also be appropriate to make allowances for such factors. However, any such allowances should take account of any refurbishment or updating that has taken place to the buildings. Should a modern equivalent basis be adopted, an allowance may be appropriate to reflect the size of the actual building.\n\nFor terminal buildings the costs to be adjusted will be based upon agreed costs for beacon terminals, which are shown in the Practice Note for the relevant rating list, together with costs for other airport facilities. Adjustments to these beacon costs may be necessary to reflect the actual circumstances at individual airports and the particular types of construction.\n\nFor most other buildings the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) cost guide will provide a basis, however, allowances in addition to the normally agreed generic allowances may be necessary at “Stage 1 or 2” for buildings on the following grounds: -\n\ni) Listed buildings - development restrictions, higher upkeep costs etc.\n\nii) Accommodation problems/constraints caused by statutory or operational requirements.\n\niii) Physical constraints.\n\niv) Building in advance of requirements.\n\nv) Additional development affecting utilisation of existing space.\n\nvi) Functional Obsolescence\n\nStructures\n\nThe basis to be adopted is estimated replacement cost as at the antecedent valuation date. The costs will require adjustment for any age related disability or functional disability. Any allowances should take account of any refurbishment or updating that has taken place.\n\nRunways\n\nThe basis to be adopted is estimated replacement cost as at the antecedent valuation date as set out in the relevant Practice Note or where appropriate, the modern equivalent.\n\nThe cost to be adopted will be based upon the Pavement Classification Number (PCN) published on the CAA website or appropriate trade publication current at the valuation date. Alternatively consideration will be given to any documentary evidence produced on behalf of the occupier as to the actual specification or any modern equivalent but in this respect regard will also be had to the types of aircraft using the runway and their requirements as regards PCNs. Any modern equivalent must be able to embrace the existing functionality and the operational business model as at the AVD and it should not be seen as an opportunity to adopt a different model where it suits.\n\nThe costs should be adjusted to take account of any age related disabilities, however, regard should be had to the fact that licensed pavements are regularly resurfaced to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) standards, therefore a maximum age related allowance of 6% is appropriate for such pavements. The scale is shown in the relevant Practice Note. Any problems associated with a failure by the operator to repair will be disregarded in accordance with the Rating (Valuation) Act 1999 provisions. Allowances may also be appropriate for excessive strength, widths and lengths caused by historic reasons or environmental or operational restraints.\n\nTaxiways/Aprons\n\nSimilar levels of costing and allowances to runways will be applicable (unless evidence is adduced as to lower specifications for these items) but account should be taken of any disabilities arising because of shape/operational restrictions. It may be appropriate to make an addition to reflect blast screens or hydrants (where not separately assessed).\n\nCar Parks\n\nMulti storey car parks should be included in the airport assessment unless they are leased out. They should be included within the contractor’s basis valuation on their adjusted replacement cost.\n\nSurface car parks should be included in the airport assessment where they are operated on behalf of the airport under a concession type agreement, but separately assessed if they are occupied under a lease or licence.\n\nWhere car parking spaces are included in the lease of separately let accommodation then the spaces should be excluded from the airport valuation.\n\nShould a car park be separated from the airport by a public highway and hence not contiguous it will be necessary to take guidance from the leading case Woolway (VO) v Mazars [2015] Supreme Court - RA 373 – in establishing the unit of assessment and whether the car park is functionally essential to the airport.\n\nRoads\n\nThose roads which lie within the airport’s boundary, which are not public highways and the ownership of which is vested in the airport authority, are to be included in the airport assessment at their adjusted replacement cost.\n\nEstate roads wholly serving separately assessed hereditaments should be excluded.\n\nAdvertising Rights\n\nThose advertising rights external to the terminals, which are not reflected in the site value of the terminal, should be valued separately and added onto the end of the valuation if not separately assessed.\n\nPetrol Filling Stations etc.\n\nThese would normally fall to be separately assessed. However, if they are included in the main valuation their value should be calculated on a comparative basis with other similar separately assessed hereditaments and added on at the end of the valuation.\n\nFuel Farms\n\nThese would normally fall to be assessed as part of the main airport assessment. However some may be separately assessed. The tanks associated with this class of plant and machinery are rateable under Class 4 Table 4 if they are over the requisite size – 400 cu m – or if less than 400 cu m they may still be rateable if they are not readily capable of being moved without substantial demolition of the surrounding structure.\n\nHowever the plant and machinery may also be rateable under the following classes:\n\nClass 1 and Class 2 Accessories (1) storage of fuel for the generation of power [unlikely for an airport] and (2) (v) as an accessory to a Class 1 or 2 item such as pipes and controls.\n\nClass 2 (f) Protection from hazards [normally for the storage of fire water]\n\n[Class 4 Table 4 – as above.]\n\nThe tanks would normally take the form of horizontal cigar shape or a vertical cylinder. They can be found in a single location or in a tank farm above the ground. Usually the horizontal tanks would be fitted with metal supports [saddles] or in a frame of steel. The vertical tanks are similar to the horizontal tanks but whereas the horizontal tanks are laid on cradles or structural steelwork most vertical tanks sit on their own foundations. They may be found in a single location or on a tank farm. The tanks may be supported by a skirt and any catwalks platforms and foundations would be valued as an extra. The tanks are usually made of welded/bolted mild steel. The VO Cost Guide should be consulted for details and guidance. See references 215G01 to 215G08; 215E01 to 215E08; 215G51 to 215G58; 215E010 to 215E012.\n\nFees and Location Factors\n\nThe costs to be adopted in the contractor’s basis valuation are exclusive of fees and adjusted to a location factor of 1. These costs will therefore need to be adjusted by the appropriate location factor and for fees, on the basis recommended in the VOA Cost Guide. The fee level to be adopted should be based upon the general level of fees. This reflects the fact that whilst higher fees would normally be expected on terminal buildings, concrete would normally have lower levels of fees. The fee level for 2017 list will therefore remain at 9%.\n\nSize of Contract Allowance\n\nThe VOA cost guide is based on a notional contract size of £3m and for revaluation 2017 all airport costs will be similarly adjusted. Therefore it is appropriate that the costs adopted should have a size of contract allowance applied to them where they vary from this base. The adjustment will be based on the total estimated replacement cost for the airport. See the associated table. The adjustment is automatic in the valuation.\n\nApplication of the Contractors Basis\n\nStage 1 - Estimated Replacement Cost (ERC)\n\nMeasurement\n\nThe basis of measurement will be GIA as defined by the VOA / RICS Code of Measuring Practice. The measured area will include areas of common use where parts are let out. All paved areas should be included separately, according to construction specification. Roads and fences should be recorded and valued as part of the setting. Lighting of pavements will normally be included in pavement costs and adjustments should be made where lighting does not exist.\n\nSurplusage\n\nAs referred to above [see the paragraph on buildings] the modern equivalent may be considered rather than costing of the actual. It may be shown by evidence that certain buildings are either over-specified or too large for the number of AVD passengers and this surplus space or capacity is otherwise known as surplusage. However a facility should not be considered surplus simply because it is used relatively infrequently, if it is necessary for the business operated at the airport. It is the peak time capacity that must be valued otherwise the airport could not function at those peaks. Surplusage should also be resisted where the item to be costed could not be reduced in size, whether it is used once or a multitude of times – i.e. runways.\n\nAlso it is the actual AVD business that is too be costed - not a variation of the business that would require fewer facilities. In the decision of British Car Auctions Ltd t/a Blackbushe Airport Ltd v Hazel 2014, the Lands Chamber stated:\n\n“It is important that the modern substitute chosen must reflect the use of the hereditament that has to be valued. The modern substitute chosen should be able to do the same basic job that the actual hereditament does. The choice of a modern substitute is not the opportunity to adopt a new business model”\n\nCosts\n\nFor all costs guidance will be given in the Cost Guide. Costs of some specialist elements of airports, normally only applicable to Category A and the larger Category B airports are produced by the VOA Quantity Surveyors.\n\nThese appear in the VOA Cost Guide and relevant Practice Note and relate to major terminal buildings, specialist fire stations, control towers and pavements used by heavy commercial aircraft. Where there are rateable airport facilities not listed specifically in the Cost the nearest relevant item should be selected from the Cost Guide and adjusted as appropriate.\n\nOn minor airports, runways will vary in specification from flattened out areas of grassland - the grass of which is kept short by regular mowing - to specially prepared and stabilised strips, often with the inclusion of some aggregate to assist drainage and stability. The generic contractor’s spreadsheet should be used and adjustments will be made for location factor, contract size and the addition for fees automatically, once set.\n\nStage II – Adjustments to ERC\n\nAge and Obsolescence Allowances\n\nAge related allowances are generally applicable and based upon those determined by the Lands Tribunal in the case of Monsanto v Farris (VO) 1998. These have been modified for each subsequent list and recent settlements following litigation. However the particular circumstances of civil airport maintenance, in order to preserve operational licences, means that the normal generic allowances are not applicable with regard to pavements including runways.\n\nAllowances on runways and other pavements take into account the duty of airport operators imposed by the CAA as a condition of the licensing of the airport. This duty is to maintain the operational pavements (runways, taxi-ways and aprons) in a good state of repair, with regular resurfacing dependent on usage. Pavements, other than through fair wear and tear, do not deteriorate with age at the same rate as buildings. A maximum allowance of 6% should therefore be made for age/obsolescence in respect of operational pavements, unless the airport is unlicensed and used for private purposes only.\n\nIn the case of Orb Electrical Steels v Webb (VO) settled by consent, the Valuation Officer accepted that the allowances for age and obsolescence, underpinned by those formulated in Monsanto, could be extended. This was only within the restricted circumstances at Orb [or very similar hereditaments] to take into account the nature of some buildings which had not been refurbished since the 1930s. It is not considered that any general extension of the existing age and obsolescence scales should be considered for airport hereditaments as a direct result of this settlement.\n\nOther disabilities\n\nOther disabilities, such as poor or inappropriate design which may be manifest in the form of impaired functionality or by being technologically outmoded, may be taken account of by an allowance for functional and or technical obsolescence as guided by Monsanto.\n\nIf a modern equivalent has been costed at Stage 1, care needs to be taken not to duplicate allowances at Stage 2.\n\nStage III - Land Cost\n\nThe objective is to include a land cost for the total land area of the airport and if evidence of site value for a new or extended airport exists, this should be used, analysed on an overall acreage basis. Evidence should be notified to the NVU Airport class facilitator\n\nNormally such evidence does not exist and recourse must be had to local evidence of the nearest equivalent land use even though these may not be, strictly, within the same mode of category of use. For the Category A airports, a formula has been agreed in the past with the airport users to standardise the approach to site valuation, by dividing the airport into 4 separate site valuation zones. These are: -\n\n1. The terminal building site, measured as total floor area of the terminal building within the main airport assessment. The land value applied will depend on the commercial activity of the airport. The major airports fall into 3 groups:\n\nMajor Airports (over 8 m AVD passengers) - Value equates to appropriate peak commercial land value.\n\nRegional Airports - (3-8 m AVD passengers) - The value relates to those sites associated with food and retail warehousing in the locality. (This includes small international airports).\n\nSmaller Regional Airports (under 3m AVD passengers) - Non-food Retail land value or higher value industrial land. May be compared with high industrial land values plus 10% having regard to the level of values at AVD for appropriate size in the locality. Account should be taken of the relative size of the retailing area in the category of the airport.\n\nThe value adopted will be on a double footprint basis to reflect the multi-floor and high value nature of the building(s).\n\nThe justification for adopting this high land value is that the Contractor’s Basis, should reflect the very high income capacity of retail and Taxy Free outlets within terminal buildings. The terminal buildings function as an interface between the land and air sides of the airport and in both parts the passengers invariably have time on their hands and money to spend. Retail land values will therefore be appropriate where airports reflect the commercial value of the concession occupations. On the other hand retail values would be inappropriate in those rare instances where duty free and other shopping facilities do not exist.\n\n2. Other buildings, including the terminals for smaller airports, at a site value for the double footprint of the buildings equivalent to warehouses/industrial land values. In judgement of these values the nearest appropriate comparables (in planning terms) to the airport will be chosen. Only buildings, or part buildings, within the occupation or control of the operator are included here.\n\n3. Surfaced land areas, including runways (if surfaced), roads, car parks, aprons and taxi-ways, will be valued by reference to site values for open storage or car parking land in th vicinity. In default of evidence, normally 25% of the industrial/warehouse value is adopted for the major airports, and from 5% to 15% for minor airports.\n\n4. All other land within the airport boundary, excluding let-out areas, should be valued at prevailing agricultural values. Remote or green-belt locations should not be taken at a lower site value on the assumption that planning consent would not be available for alternative user, because it is the value of the site for airport use for which consent exists or has been established, which is required for the valuation exercise. The comparison with other uses is merely a means to the end of arriving at the overall airport site value.\n\nWhere agricultural land in the ownership of the Airport Operator lies outside the curtilage of the airport and is occupied exclusively or principally for agricultural purposes, consideration should be given to its exemption following normal rating principles.\n\nIn the case of many remote airfields, comparison should be made of the results following strictly the above approach with that of applying an overall ‘agricultural plus’ basis and make a judgement in the light of all the circumstances.\n\nStage IV – De-capitalisation\n\nThe statutorily determined rate should be applied here.\n\nStage V - End Allowances or Adjustments\n\nAt this stage, allowance should be made for disabilities affecting the rental value of the airport as a whole and not accounted for elsewhere.\n\nAny allowances given should however be related to identifiable disabilities which give rise to the under- performance. If such disabilities do not exist, the under- performance may be attributable to other factors, not related to the value of land and buildings for which an allowance would not be appropriate. It should also be noted that Stage 5 should not be used to circumvent the fixed nature of the Stage 4 Statutory\n\nDe-capitalisation Rate. In Allen v English Sports Council 2009 the Tribunal commented upon the factors in a contractor’s basis valuation that are to taken into account in the prescribed de-capitalisation rate. The Tribunal said it ‘was matters bearing on the amount that the tenant would be prepared to pay’. In the circumstances they rejected the appellant’s case on grant at this or at any other stage.\n\nWork Load Units\n\nA potentially useful comparative tool is the use of work load units (WLU). These are arrived at by taking the passenger numbers and converting them to their equivalent freight tonnage and adding the actual freight tonnage to this figure. Workload units are calculated on the basis that 1 passenger plus baggage = 200lb. The passenger numbers are converted into freight tonnage by dividing the number by 11. The actual freight tonnage is then added to this figure. The use of WLUs as an industry indicator of performance appears to have lost favour in recent years, but it still remains a good method of testing airport performance for rating purposes in that it combines passenger and freight performance into a single figure.\n\nPossible Disabilities [some which may have been taken into account in the land values adopted]\n\nDisabilities frequently encountered include:\n\nFlying restrictions, limiting the duration of operational hours, or the nature of aircraft using the airport. This is frequently related to proximity of housing.\n\nRemote location, or distance from population centres, reducing demand for passenger flights or club membership.\n\nAccess problems, including poor local road network, poor signage, distance from motorways etc.\n\nCompetition from larger local airports.\n\nGenerally poor layout, design etc, not reflected at stage II.\n\nAbnormally high maintenance costs.\n\nInfrastructure provided in advance of requirement\n\nInfrastructure external to the hereditament not provided to service the airport\n\nAPPENDIX 2\n\nValuation Approach for Categories C - E\n\nThis section arises out of past discussions between the VOA and representatives of the British Gliding\n\nAssociation (BGA) and will be of assistance when discussing proposals / appeals. This guidance includes reference to helipads and heliports\n\nThe key purpose of this review is to achieve consistency of approach to the valuation of these hereditaments.\n\nThis note aims to guide the caseworker in establishing the facts and evidence to allow the right valuation judgements to be made. This hopefully will lead to a valuation which is not only realistic in terms of the level of activity at the hereditament, but is in line with the rateable values of similar hereditaments.\n\nAs described in Rating Manual Volume 5: Section 250, only those parts of the hereditament under the occupation or paramount control of the airstrip / helipad / heliport operator will be included in the assessment. Normal rating principles will be applied in determining paramount control.\n\nThe basis of valuation\n\nFollowing discussions with industry representatives and further research, it has become apparent that the contractor’s basis of valuation will provide the most consistent outcomes. The rental evidence largely refers to the land only on which the airstrip sits and consequently it is necessary to value the land and buildings and other features by other means. Rather than having a complex hybrid valuation methodology for which there is little or no legal authority, it is considered the best method would be to use the contractor’s basis.\n\nAdjustments and allowances for the contractor’s element\n\nThere are five principal ways in which the contractor’s basis of valuation can be adjusted to reflect the situations prevailing at airstrips, gliding clubs and similar hereditaments. They are:-\n\na. Value only those parts of the airfield / helipad / heliport appropriate to the operation being carried out;\n\nb. Omit those parts totally redundant or surplus to requirements, or in excess of the required operations at the airstrip/ helipad / heliport;\n\nc. At stage 2, reflect by allowances the disabilities which may exist in the items valued at stage 1;\n\nd. Value an appropriate area of land at an appropriate value in the light of the facts;\n\ne. Make allowance at stage 5 for those disabilities not taken account of in stages 1-4\n\nSpecific Features\n\nThese are to be added to the value of the land:\n\nSurfaced Runways / helipads and heliports\n\nThe runway, particularly if surfaced, is normally the most costly part of an airfield or strip, especially in the case of a small airfield. Careful consideration will need to be given in circumstances where, for historical reasons it may be that rural airfields have runways vastly in excess of what is now required (e.g. wartime and ex-MOD airfields).\n\nThe value arising from such a runway may be substantial and it is for the valuer to consider whether the additional value is justifiable. In many cases VOs should consider the substitute approach, valuing what is reasonably required by the operator, rather than the actual runway. As a guide:\n\nA runway of maximum 1000 x 30 m [30,000 sq m] should be considered to be the norm for a gliding site, but some are less, in which event the smaller area would be valued (reference to Pooley’s Flight Guide may be of assistance here and further advice may be sought from one of the specialist airport valuers ).\n\nThe minimum for a helipad is likely to be in the order of 38m x16 m and some may be significantly larger resembling short air strips [235m x 32m].\n\nHelipads and heliports within this category consist of stand-alone hereditaments which are not subordinate parts of larger hereditaments, such as a race course or hotel, which are Category E. Stand-alone Heliports and\n\nHelipads should be identified from Pooley’s Guide and confirmed by site inspections. Once identified, the Non Domestic Rating Unit should notify NVU, of stand-alone Heliports and Helipads so they can be added to the list included in the Practice Note.\n\nThe basis of valuation will be the contractor’s basis and the helipad will attract costs and allowances in line with those for concrete aprons and other similar features to be found on airports. See the tables of costs and allowances in the Practice Note for the appropriate list.\n\nGrass Airstrips\n\nAt some sites ground stabilisation and drainage will have taken place to improve the durability of the runway. This may take the form of tar-spraying or earth consolidation using a mixture with cement. A surface coating may then be applied. Drainage, if present, may either be by mole-drainage or trenched tile drainage, or ideally a combination of the two. The valuation of grass runways will therefore depend on the nature of the surface, and costs will vary from £1.00 p s m for simple levelling, rolling and mowing to £2.50 p s m for drained and stabilised runway surfaces.\n\nAs a guide, a runway of 1000 x 30 m [30,000 sq m] would be considered to be the maximum at a gliding site, but some are less, in which event the smaller area would be valued.\n\nTaxiways\n\nWhere taxiways are valued or relevant to the airstrip in question, substitute widths of 10m - 15m will normally provide sufficient width. Costs will depend on the specification and will follow the guidance above or VOA Cost Guide rates. (Pooley’s flight guide may be of assistance here and further advice may be sought from one of the specialist airport valuers.)\n\nAprons\n\nAprons should be included to the extent that they form an operational purpose and would be included in a substitute hereditament. Evidence of actual use should be sufficient. Costs will depend on the specification and will follow the guidance above or VOA Cost Guide rates. (Particular care should be taken when costing aprons and stands to adopt the correct PCN)\n\nRoads\n\nRoads, particularly airside, are often surplus to requirements. Actual use may only take place through convenience rather than necessity and consideration should be given to the minimum necessary layout to provide reasonable access to pavements, particularly for fire vehicles, without undue inconvenience. Costs will depend on specification - e.g. curbs, lighting etc, and will follow VOA Cost Guide rates.\n\nBuildings\n\nNormally buildings forming part of the hereditament will be included in their entirety at stage I, although building that are totally disused or redundant at the AVD should be omitted. The nature of the airstrip operation and the likely provision in a substitute hereditament should be considered. Surpluses may occur in area, or height and where this is a factor in the costing or values used, appropriate allowances may be given. The general principle should however be observed that if a facility is essential for the operation, even only for a relatively small proportion of the time, it will probably not be surplus to any extent. This may well occur in buildings, which although of appropriate size, may have an outdated design or facilities not compatible with modern operations, warranting a separate allowance. Normally hangar type buildings will be valued having regard to the cost of equivalent agricultural buildings rather than the more sophisticated hangars found on commercial airfields\n\nFees to be adopted at a rate of 9%. It will be necessary to override the default % on the NBS spreadsheet and enter 9% manually. The RICS / BCIS Indices will be used for location factor adjustments.\n\nLand\n\nThe total area of the airstrip should exclude areas beyond what might be regarded as necessary for operational requirements and may be present only for historic reasons. A realistic approach should be taken based upon a ring fence around all facilities and including intervening grass areas which would normally be required in any substitute hereditament.\n\nIt is agreed with the BGA that the whole site will be valued on the basis of the land being at the prevailing bare agricultural land value in the locality but having regard to the circumstances and character of the particular site.\n\nAs a guide the site area of no more than 30 hectares would be appropriate. Guidance as to the agricultural value to be adopted can be obtained by reference the relevant Practice Note in respect of land values (hyperlink).\n\nThe lump sum cost additions for Septic Tank Drainage; Mains Electricity; Mains Water and any End Additions are to be found in the VO PN for these classes.\n\nThere may be other features on the airfield site which merit an addition. These are likely to be limited to such features as caravan pitches and in these circumstances it is agreed that an addition should be made having regard to the local tone.\n\nDisabilities and end allowances\n\nThe purpose of occupation of the airstrip will be a relevant consideration, whether for club, private or social use.\n\nThe end allowance will have regard to whether the actual occupiers are likely to be the only potential tenants, whether profitability would be the primary objective of the hypothetical tenant at a particular site It is not feasible to give guidance on individual allowances for all factors of stage 5 or other end allowances, since each will depend on it merits.\n\nConsideration may also be given, to the possibility of agricultural exemption where the airstrip is occupied with an agricultural property, for which the normal principles of the exemption will apply.\n\nIt should be noted that, particularly in the case of minor and privately owned airports and airstrips, the\n\nContractor’s Basis may produce an apparently high rateable value at Stage IV. There should be an objective review of Stage V allowances, requiring a knowledge of the circumstances of the operation of the airport, to ensure that the rateable value is compatible with the level of activity of which the airport is capable. Close co-ordination by NVU and Non Domestic Rating Unit Valuers is important at this stage.\n\nThe BGA has put forward the following grounds for Stage 5 Allowances. Any allowances under these heads have not been quantified but the totality of allowances should only exceed 10% in exceptional circumstances\n\nThe following list shows the end allowances that may be applicable at many gliding clubs, but this should not be considered as a comprehensive list:\n\na) Airspace Restrictions – Airspace restrictions are defined as statutory air space restrictions imposed by the CAA, restrictions arising from the Air Navigation Orders, restrictions arising from neighbours, and air safety requirements. At their most severe these restrictions will limit the times and duration of airfield operations, including limitations on the circuits that can be flown. A medium restriction would be where local air traffic routes limit operations in the immediate vicinity of the site (e.g. within 5 nautical miles), or where it is necessary to have a local operational agreement with a local airport/airfield operator. At the lower end of the scale would be airspace restricting area navigational access to a site or physical restrictions caused by objects such as wind turbines.\n\nb) Access Restrictions – Gliding site are often remote to public access roads and/or have restrictions imposed by third parties. Gliding Clubs rely on adequate public access, so such restrictions can limit/restrict club viability. The severity of such restrictions is site specific and should not require any specialist knowledge to evaluate. At the severe level access might be over unmade roads owned by third parties with restrictions on access. Sites remote from public highways might be at a medium level.\n\nc) Non Exclusive Site Use – Many if not most gliding sites have a shared use, most commonly a dual agricultural use. For example many clubs share their sites with grazing animals requiring the herding of animals prior to and post flying, with the attendant problems of animal faeces. This restricts hours of operation and increases costs. At its most severe the site is in effect in agricultural use with gliding being a secondary use. Here the hours of operation in each type of use may be the best indication of the severity of this restriction. The restrictions in this category are caused by consecutive use as distinguished from (d) below where the issue is concurrent use.\n\nd) Multiple Site Use - Gliding Clubs rarely have sole use of an airfield and its environs and have to operate in parallel with other commercial/sports organisations. Adjacent land may have agricultural or commercial use that restricts gliding operations. For example farming on adjacent (and often open unfenced land), mean that winching operations have to be curtailed or cease; as the risk of dropping cables on farm machinery and personnel is too high. Such restrictions are usually periodic (harvesting etc.). Similarly many clubs have adjacent commercial operations and traffic which restrict operations. At its most severe a club might have to permanently limit the area useable for flying operations, or cease operations in certain wind directions. Again the degree and period of restriction should be used to categorise the severity of the restriction.\n\ne) Public Rights of Way - Many gliding clubs are in National Parks, AONBs, or similar attractive areas desirable to tourists, ramblers etc. The statutory rights to roam and/or public footpaths adjacent to, or across an airfield cause significant operational restrictions. These may require the operation of safety procedures restricting frequency of flights and may vary according to wind direction. Such restrictions should be able to be measured subjectively in relation to the duration of restrictions, or the effect on flight frequency.\n\nf) Planning Restrictions - Many gliding sites have planning restrictions that limit air navigational use. These restrictions may cover timing, frequency and/or the type of air navigational operations that are allowed.\n\ng) Statutory Restrictions - Many gliding clubs occupy sites formally owned or partially owned by a statutory authority (usually the MOD). In most cases the authority limits the use of land that is in, or was in its ownership.\n\nSummary\n\nThe effect of restrictions such as those above may have a parallel or cumulative effect on the operations of a club. While it is recognised that end allowances are by their nature subjective, there needs to be some form of objective framework that provides a consistency of approach and valuation. Typically we would suggest that a club that has multiple limitations of a medium to severe level be allocated the highest end allowances.\n\n1. Market Appraisal\n\nGeneral Aviation [ GA ]\n\nGA is a diverse sector, at one end of the spectrum are high value business aircraft; at the other end paragliders and hang gliders. GA also serves many purposes, including business usage, sports and recreational activities, and as a means of personal transport.\n\nAlthough often presented as a sector in decline, it is considered that many parts of GA are growing strongly, in particular the business aviation market and the smaller end of the market (such as microlights and helicopters). GA flying hours has probably reduced as fuel and other costs have increased but airfield income derives from estate income, fuel sales, parking, hangarage, and landing fees. In respect of landing fees, those for general light aviation remain modest, typically at around £15 - £20.\n\nResearch suggests that of the 21,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK in 2010, some 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, and small helicopters. There are 28,000 Private Pilot License holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes as identified on the website of NATS Aeronautical Information Service.\n\nOverall, GA is facing increased difficulty in accessing infrastructure, both airspace and airfields. Increases in controlled airspace can limit the GA sector’s freedom to fly where it chooses. Some increase in controlled airspace is inevitable in order to accommodate a greater density of traffic safely within the airspace system, and the economic value of commercial air transport (CAT) and the associated public benefit make it desirable that CAT operations be facilitated.\n\nAt some airports the growth of CAT has reduced GAs access to both slots and parking facilities. At these airports GA has often been squeezed out through increases in the prices charged for landing, parking and handling. GA aircraft can generally still make use of these airports, but it is more expensive than in the past, and many airports may now find it less economically worthwhile for them to accommodate GA operations.\n\nThe operation of the planning regime also affects GA’s access to airfields, as decisions can lead to closures of airfields, or conditions being imposed on their operation. The closure of some airfields has resulted from the financial benefits of redeveloping substantial sites. The period 2010 - 2015 has seen the closure of both Plymouth City Airport and Manston Airport for potential redevelopment, whilst Bembridge Isle of Wight closed.\n\nIt is difficult to provide an accurate overall picture of GA movements. The CAA reports movements at about 60 airfields, and differentiates between GA and CAT movements. It has also recently started to collect data at a few of the smaller GA airfields. However, there is no comprehensive database of GA movements at other airfields.\n\nCommercial Aviation\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority provides useful statistics regarding 60 of the UK’s busiest airports. These statistics show that from a high of 2.3 million aircraft movements in 2008, the movements fell to just over 2 million in 2009 but have since recovered to 2.1 million in 2014. Passenger numbers however have increased from 235 million in 2008 up to 241 million by 2014. In 2014 Blackpool Airport went into receivership and Manston airport closed. Meanwhile both Newquay and Southend Airports have been subject to substantial infrastructural improvement. Lydd (London Ashford) Airport has obtained consent to redevelop its infrastructure including the lengthening of its single runway.\n\nThe ongoing discussions regarding the need to provide additional capacity in the South-East rumbles on, despite the recommendation by the airports commission for a third runway at Heathrow in July 2015, with both Gatwick and Heathrow vying for the opportunity to add a further runway to their infrastructure. The substantial increase in passenger numbers at both Luton and Stansted is due to the positioning of cheap airlines at each airport, particularly serving Eastern Europe from where passenger numbers have increased substantially [however figures at Stansted have fallen slightly in the most recent years] Southend’s redevelopment and its use as a base by Easyjet saw it achieve 1 million passengers in its first year of operation. Indications are that growth will continue helped by a favourable exchange rate making the UK a good value destination for tourists worldwide.\n\n2. Changes from the Last Practice Note\n\nThere are no major changes from the 2010 approach. However a new band has been added to the airport categories table shown below to take account of ‘International Small ‘airports.\n\n3. Ratepayer Discussions\n\nSince 1990 there has been a major (Category A) airport user group. This includes NVU specialist valuers, representation from the Scottish Assessor Association (SAA), in-house airport surveyors and private practice surveyors. Though the agreement has no binding force, the agreement has been followed in almost all cases since 1990 and established a basis of valuation for this class. For 2017 the major airport user group has met on two occasions, and though no agreement has been reached to date, it is hoped agreement will be reached in the near future.\n\nIt is also hoped discussions can be widened to include separate talks with representatives of the Minor Airport operators if they so wish.\n\n4. Valuation Scheme\n\nThe valuation basis is that of the contractor’s basis and the rating manual entry should be consulted for guidance on this.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt location factors and contract size adjustments are applicable in addition to the costs itemised in the tables below. Part 1 covers civil airports and Part 2 covers the valuation of airstrips gliding clubs and other similar hereditaments.\n\nThe costs shown in this section are for ease of reference. In all cases where a cost guide code is shown that must be input into the NBS template, not the costs shown here. Where the cost guide code shows options, the costs shown in this practice note should be used to aid selection. Should the cost guide show differing costs to those shown in a current version of this practice note, please refer to the CCT.\n\nRevaluation 2017 Cost Guide\n\nPart 1\n\nCategory: Airports Item: Terminal Buildings: Variations: For all categories the costs below should be adjusted to reflect the variations in construction and finish.\n\nDescription notes: Due to the continual alterations, extensions, refitting and upgrading of facilities and services encountered in this class the properties listed in the bands are indicative only.

If there is no concrete floor but some other compacted surface, say hardcore, then the above figure should be discounted by £26 /sq m and a figure of £10 /sq m added back for that form of surface. For example 3.5m x £129 /sq m would equal 3.5 x £103/ sq m plus £10 / sq m = £113 / sq m.\n\nAdditions for service installations\n\nThe following cost additions for services have been agreed. These are for connection to the hereditament, not to each individual building. This is a broad brush approach with the addition made as a single line entry. For the avoidance of doubt, no addition is made if connection is to mains drainage.\n\nSeptic Tank drainage - £4,000\n\nMains electricity - £2,500\n\nMains Water - £1,000\n\nHeliport / helipads\n\nThese consist of stand-alone hereditaments which are not subordinate parts of a larger hereditaments, such as a race course or hotel, which are Category E. Stand-alone Heliports and Helipads need to be identified from\n\nPooley’s Guide and confirmed by site inspections. Once identified, Group should notify NVU, of stand-alone Heliports and Helipads so they can be added to the list included in the Practice Note.\n\nThe basis of valuation will be the contractor’s basis and the helipad will attract costs and allowances in line with those for concrete aprons and other similar features to be found on airports.

Unit of Assessment\n\nIt is imperative when valuing an airport for rating purposes that facts regarding the unit of assessment are certain from the outset. The airport hereditament will comprise all those parts of the premises over which the airport operator has paramount control. The degree of control will vary from airport to airport, but in normal circumstances the following will usually be included: -\n\na. The runways, taxi-ways and aprons (the pavements).\n\nb. The terminal or administration building and other buildings occupied by the operator.\n\nc. The Visual Control Room (VCR) or Air-traffic Control Room (ATC) unless separately assessed to NATS or some other air traffic controller.\n\nd. The Fire Station or garaging for fire vehicles and equipment.\n\ne. All those parts of the buildings and land occupied by other parties but under the paramount control of the airport operator such as retail or catering concessions. There must be sufficient control exercised by the airport operator over the concessionaires as to demonstrate de facto that the airport operator is in paramount occupation.\n\nThree distinct types of retail occupation can be identified within airport terminals. These are Tax Free Shops, Retail Concessions and Catering Concessions. The terms of their occupations can be described as follows:\n\ni) Tax Free Shops - these are often occupied under Management Agreements whereby the Airport operator stocks the shops at its own expense and pays a management company to operate the shop. The company is normally paid on a percentage of turnover basis but the receipts and outgoings will be included in the Airport operator accounts. Duty Free shops are sometimes part of the circulation space where passengers are required to go through in order to gain access to the departure lounge.\n\nii) Retail concessions - these agreements contain stringent conditions to the extent that the Airport Authority retains paramount occupation.\n\niii) Catering Concessions - these have similar conditions imposed to the retail concessions and consequently the airport authority will retain paramount control.\n\nf. All land within the boundaries of the airport, including common user car parks and roads, both ‘landside’ and ‘airside’, other than separately assessed sites.\n\ng. Advertising rights within the terminal footprint which let on a concession type agreement will be reflected in the main assessment. The following will normally be excluded from the airport assessment and separately assessed: -\n\na. Crown Occupation, for Customs or Immigration exclusive use. ‘Red’ and ‘green’ channels which are also used for passenger circulation should be included in the main airport assessment as Customs do not have exclusive occupation in these areas.\n\nb. Local Authority occupations, for instance, police units etc.\n\nc. Any offices, shops, checkouts, catering facilities etc. let out on normal tenancy agreements.\n\nd. Hangars together with their own roads or aprons, stores, offices, warehouses, workshops, open storage or parking areas etc., let out on normal tenancy agreements, the occupier having exclusive possession.\n\ne. Fuel farms operated by independent oil companies.\n\nf. NATS or some other air traffic controlled and occupied ATC where occupied under a lease. Changes of occupation within airports are frequent and will often involve amendment of the main airport assessment. Close liaison is therefore necessary between Non Domestic Rating Units and NVU in order to keep abreast of the changes. Personal contact channels should be established and fostered.\n\n2 - The Contractor’s Basis\n\nDespite the move towards commercial viability the chosen basis of valuation for all civil airports remains the contractor’s basis. This is because these hereditaments are rarely, if ever, let and data for alternative valuation methodologies is unlikely to be forthcoming. In all the airport cases listed above under paragraph 5 (Legal Framework) the contractor’s basis was adopted and was not in dispute.\n\nHowever rental evidence may be available on categories B2, C and D and in these cases, comparative valuations should be prepared and liaison with the NVU should take place before an assessment is finalised. Airports should not be valued on a Receipts and Expenditure basis.\n\n3 - Consideration of the Valuation Stages\n\nThe principles of the contractor’s basis in Rating Manual Volume 4: Section 7 are followed for Civil Airports and this forms the basis of the Memorandum of Agreement agreed with the User Group.\n\nIn turn the basis and the memorandum are used as a framework for the minor airports with appropriate adaptation. The elements that make up the contractor’s basis and their application to the different categories of airport are discussed below:\n\nBuildings\n\nThe basis will be the estimated replacement cost for the building, or a substitute building approach may be appropriate. Allowances should be made for any age related disabilities, if applicable. In addition if there is functional obsolescence or excessive accommodation it may also be appropriate to make allowances for such factors. However, any such allowances should take account of any refurbishment or updating that has taken place to the buildings. Should a modern equivalent basis be adopted, an allowance may be appropriate to reflect the size of the actual building.\n\nFor terminal buildings the costs to be adjusted will be based upon agreed costs for beacon terminals, which are shown in the Practice Note for the relevant rating list, together with costs for other airport facilities. Adjustments to these beacon costs may be necessary to reflect the actual circumstances at individual airports and the particular types of construction.\n\nFor most other buildings the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) cost guide will provide a basis, however, allowances in addition to the normally agreed generic allowances may be necessary at “Stage 1 or 2” for buildings on the following grounds:\n\ni) Listed buildings - development restrictions, higher upkeep costs etc.\n\nii) Accommodation problems/constraints caused by statutory or operational requirements.\n\niii) Physical constraints.\n\niv) Building in advance of requirements.\n\nv) Additional development affecting utilisation of existing space.\n\nvi) Functional Obsolescence\n\nStructures\n\nThe basis to be adopted is estimated replacement cost as at the antecedent valuation date. The costs will require adjustment for any age related disability or functional disability. Any allowances should take account of any refurbishment or updating that has taken place. Runways\n\nThe basis to be adopted is estimated replacement cost as at the antecedent valuation date as set out in the relevant Practice Note or where appropriate, the modern equivalent.\n\nThe cost to be adopted will be based upon the Pavement Classification Number (PCN) published on the CAA website or appropriate trade publication current at the valuation date. Alternatively consideration will be given to any documentary evidence produced on behalf of the occupier as to the actual specification or any modern equivalent but in this respect regard will also be had to the types of aircraft using the runway and their requirements as regards PCNs. Any modern equivalent must be able to embrace the existing functionality and the operational business model as at the AVD and it should not be seen as an opportunity to adopt a different model where it suits.\n\nThe costs should be adjusted to take account of any age related disabilities, however, regard should be had to the fact that licensed pavements are regularly resurfaced to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) standards, therefore a maximum age related allowance of 6% is appropriate for such pavements. The scale is shown in the relevant Practice Note. Any problems associated with a failure by the operator to repair will be disregarded in accordance with the Rating (Valuation) Act 1999 provisions. Allowances may also be appropriate for excessive strength, widths and lengths caused by historic reasons or environmental or operational restraints.\n\nTaxiways/Aprons\n\nSimilar levels of costing and allowances to runways will be applicable (unless evidence is adduced as to lower specifications for these items) but account should be taken of any disabilities arising because of shape/operational restrictions. It may be appropriate to make an addition to reflect blast screens or hydrants (where not separately assessed).\n\nCar Parks\n\nMulti storey car parks should be included in the airport assessment unless they are leased out. They should be included within the contractor’s basis valuation on their adjusted replacement cost.\n\nSurface car parks should be included in the airport assessment where they are operated on behalf of the airport under a concession type agreement, but separately assessed if they are occupied under a lease or licence. Where car parking spaces are included in the lease of separately let accommodation then the spaces should be excluded from the airport valuation.\n\nShould a car park be separated from the airport by a public highway and hence not contiguous it will be necessary to take guidance from the leading case Woolway (VO) v Mazars [2015] Supreme Court - RA 373 – in establishing the unit of assessment and whether the car park is functionally essential to the airport.\n\nRoads\n\nThose roads which lie within the airport’s boundary, which are not public highways and the ownership of which is vested in the airport authority, are to be included in the airport assessment at their adjusted replacement cost. Estate roads wholly serving separately assessed hereditaments should be excluded.\n\nAdvertising Rights\n\nThose advertising rights external to the terminals, which are not reflected in the site value of the terminal, should be valued separately and added onto the end of the valuation if not separately assessed.\n\nPetrol Filling Stations etc.\n\nThese would normally fall to be separately assessed. However, if they are included in the main valuation their value should be calculated on a comparative basis with other similar separately assessed hereditaments and added on at the end of the valuation.\n\nFuel Farms\n\nThese would normally fall to be assessed as part of the main airport assessment. However some may be separately assessed. The tanks associated with this class of plant and machinery are rateable under Class 4\n\nTable 4 if they are over the requisite size – 400 cu m – or if less than 400 cu m they may still be rateable if they are not readily capable of being moved without substantial demolition of the surrounding structure. However the plant and machinery may also be rateable under the following classes:\n\nClass 1 and Class 2 Accessories (1) storage of fuel for the generation of power [unlikely for an airport] and (2) (v) as an accessory to a Class 1 or 2 item such as pipes and controls.\n\nClass 2 (f) Protection from hazards [normally for the storage of fire water]\n\n[Class 4 Table 4 – as above.]\n\nThe tanks would normally take the form of horizontal cigar shape or a vertical cylinder. They can be found in a single location or in a tank farm above the ground. Usually the horizontal tanks would be fitted with metal supports [saddles] or in a frame of steel. The vertical tanks are similar to the horizontal tanks but whereas the horizontal tanks are laid on cradles or structural steelwork most vertical tanks sit on their own foundations. They may be found in a single location or on a tank farm. The tanks may be supported by a skirt and any catwalks platforms and foundations would be valued as an extra. The tanks are usually made of welded/bolted mild steel.\n\nThe VO Cost Guide should be consulted for details and guidance. See references 215G01 to 215G08; 215E01 to 215E08; 215G51 to 215G58; 215E010 to 215E012.\n\nFees and Location Factors\n\nThe costs to be adopted in the contractor’s basis valuation are exclusive of fees and adjusted to a location factor of 1. These costs will therefore need to be adjusted by the appropriate location factor and for fees, on the basis recommended in the VOA Cost Guide. The fee level to be adopted should be based upon the general level of fees. This reflects the fact that whilst higher fees would normally be expected on terminal buildings, concrete would normally have lower levels of fees. The fee level for 2017 list will therefore remain at 9%.\n\nSize of Contract Allowance\n\nThe VOA cost guide is based on a notional contract size of £3m and for revaluation 2017 all airport costs will be similarly adjusted. Therefore it is appropriate that the costs adopted should have a size of contract allowance applied to them where they vary from this base. The adjustment will be based on the total estimated replacement cost for the airport. See the associated table. The adjustment is automatic in the valuation.\n\nApplication of the Contractors Basis\n\nStage 1 - Estimated Replacement Cost (ERC)\n\nMeasurement\n\nThe basis of measurement will be GIA as defined by the VOA / RICS Code of Measuring Practice. The measured area will include areas of common use where parts are let out. All paved areas should be included separately, according to construction specification. Roads and fences should be recorded and valued as part of the setting. Lighting of pavements will normally be included in pavement costs and adjustments should be made where lighting does not exist.\n\nSurplusage\n\nAs referred to above [see the paragraph on buildings] the modern equivalent may be considered rather than costing of the actual. It may be shown by evidence that certain buildings are either over-specified or too large for the number of AVD passengers and this surplus space or capacity is otherwise known as surplusage. However a facility should not be considered surplus simply because it is used relatively infrequently, if it is necessary for the business operated at the airport. It is the peak time capacity that must be valued otherwise the airport could not function at those peaks. Surplusage should also be resisted where the item to be costed could not be reduced in size, whether it is used once or a multitude of times – i.e. runways.\n\nAlso it is the actual AVD business that is too be costed - not a variation of the business that would require fewer facilities. In the decision of British Car Auctions Ltd t/a Blackbushe Airport Ltd v Hazel 2014, the Lands Chamber stated:\n\n“It is important that the modern substitute chosen must reflect the use of the hereditament that has to be valued. The modern substitute chosen should be able to do the same basic job that the actual hereditament does. The choice of a modern substitute is not the opportunity to adopt a new business model”\n\nCosts\n\nFor all costs guidance will be given in the Cost Guide. Costs of some specialist elements of airports, normally only applicable to Category A and the larger Category B airports are produced by the VOA Quantity Surveyors. These appear in the VOA Cost Guide and relevant Practice Note and relate to major terminal buildings, specialist fire stations, control towers and pavements used by heavy commercial aircraft.\n\nWhere there are rateable airport facilities not listed specifically in the Cost the nearest relevant item should be selected from the Cost Guide and adjusted as appropriate.\n\nOn minor airports, runways will vary in specification from flattened out areas of grassland - the grass of which is kept short by regular mowing - to specially prepared and stabilised strips, often with the inclusion of some aggregate to assist drainage and stability. The generic contractor’s spreadsheet should be used and adjustments will be made for location factor, contract size and the addition for fees automatically, once set.\n\nStage II – Adjustments to ERC\n\nAge and Obsolescence Allowances\n\nAge related allowances are generally applicable and based upon those determined by the Lands Tribunal in the case of Monsanto v Farris (VO) 1998. These have been modified for each subsequent list and recent settlements following litigation. However the particular circumstances of civil airport maintenance, in order to preserve operational licences, means that the normal generic allowances are not applicable with regard to pavements including runways.\n\nAllowances on runways and other pavements take into account the duty of airport operators imposed by the CAA as a condition of the licensing of the airport. This duty is to maintain the operational pavements (runways, taxi-ways and aprons) in a good state of repair, with regular resurfacing dependent on usage. Pavements, other than through fair wear and tear, do not deteriorate with age at the same rate as buildings. A maximum allowance of 6% should therefore be made for age/obsolescence in respect of operational pavements, unless the airport is unlicensed and used for private purposes only.\n\nIn the case of Orb Electrical Steels v Webb (VO) settled by consent, the Valuation Officer accepted that the allowances for age and obsolescence, underpinned by those formulated in Monsanto, could be extended. This was only within the restricted circumstances at Orb [or very similar hereditaments] to take into account the nature of some buildings which had not been refurbished since the 1930s. It is not considered that any general extension of the existing age and obsolescence scales should be considered for airport hereditaments as a direct result of this settlement.\n\nOther disabilities\n\nOther disabilities, such as poor or inappropriate design which may be manifest in the form of impaired functionality or by being technologically outmoded, may be taken account of by an allowance for functional and or technical obsolescence as guided by Monsanto. If a modern equivalent has been costed at Stage 1, care needs to be taken not to duplicate allowances at Stage 2.\n\nStage III - Land Cost\n\nThe objective is to include a land cost for the total land area of the airport and if evidence of site value for a new or extended airport exists, this should be used, analysed on an overall acreage basis. Evidence should be notified to the NVU Airport class facilitator\n\nNormally such evidence does not exist and recourse must be had to local evidence of the nearest equivalent land use even though these may not be, strictly, within the same mode of category of use. For the Category A airports, a formula has been agreed in the past with the airport users to standardise the approach to site valuation, by dividing the airport into 4 separate site valuation zones. These are: -\n\n1. The terminal building site, measured as total floor area of the terminal building within the main airport assessment. The land value applied will depend on the commercial activity of the airport. The major airports fall into 3 groups:\n\nMajor Airports (over 8 m AVD passengers) - Value equates to appropriate peak commercial land value.\n\nRegional Airports - (3-8 m AVD passengers) - The value relates to those sites associated with food and retail warehousing in the locality. (This includes small international airports).\n\nSmaller Regional Airports (under 3m AVD passengers) - Non-food Retail land value or higher value industrial land. May be compared with high industrial land values plus 10% having regard to the level of values at AVD for appropriate size in the locality. Account should be taken of the relative size of the retailing area in the category of the airport.\n\nThe value adopted will be on a double footprint basis to reflect the multi-floor and high value nature of the building(s).\n\nThe justification for adopting this high land value is that the Contractor’s Basis, should reflect the very high income capacity of retail and Taxy Free outlets within terminal buildings. The terminal buildings function as an interface between the land and air sides of the airport and in both parts the passengers invariably have time on their hands and money to spend. Retail land values will therefore be appropriate where airports reflect the commercial value of the concession occupations. On the other hand retail values would be inappropriate in those rare instances where duty free and other shopping facilities do not exist.\n\n2. Other buildings, including the terminals for smaller airports, at a site value for the double footprint of the buildings equivalent to warehouses/industrial land values. In judgement of these values the nearest appropriate comparables (in planning terms) to the airport will be chosen. Only buildings, or part buildings, within the occupation or control of the operator are included here.\n\n3. Surfaced land areas, including runways (if surfaced), roads, car parks, aprons and taxi-ways, will be valued by reference to site values for open storage or car parking land in th vicinity. In default of evidence, normally 25% of the industrial/warehouse value is adopted for the major airports, and from 5% to 15% for minor airports.\n\n4. All other land within the airport boundary, excluding let-out areas, should be valued at prevailing agricultural values. Remote or green-belt locations should not be taken at a lower site value on the assumption that planning consent would not be available for alternative user, because it is the value of the site for airport use for which consent exists or has been established, which is required for the valuation exercise. The comparison with other uses is merely a means to the end of arriving at the overall airport site value.\n\nWhere agricultural land in the ownership of the Airport Operator lies outside the curtilage of the airport and is occupied exclusively or principally for agricultural purposes, consideration should be given to its exemption following normal rating principles.\n\nIn the case of many remote airfields, comparison should be made of the results following strictly the above approach with that of applying an overall ‘agricultural plus’ basis and make a judgement in the light of all the circumstances.\n\nStage IV – De-capitalisation\n\nThe statutorily determined rate should be applied here.\n\nStage V - End Allowances or Adjustments\n\nAt this stage, allowance should be made for disabilities affecting the rental value of the airport as a whole and not accounted for elsewhere.\n\nAny allowances given should however be related to identifiable disabilities which give rise to the under- performance. If such disabilities do not exist, the under- performance may be attributable to other factors, not related to the value of land and buildings for which an allowance would not be appropriate.\n\nIt should also be noted that Stage 5 should not be used to circumvent the fixed nature of the Stage 4 Statutory De-capitalisation Rate. In Allen v English Sports Council 2009 the Tribunal commented upon the factors in a contractor’s basis valuation that are to taken into account in the prescribed de-capitalisation rate. The Tribunal said it ‘was matters bearing on the amount that the tenant would be prepared to pay’. In the circumstances they rejected the appellant’s case on grant at this or at any other stage.\n\nWork Load Units\n\nA potentially useful comparative tool is the use of work load units (WLU). These are arrived at by taking the passenger numbers and converting them to their equivalent freight tonnage and adding the actual freight tonnage to this figure. Workload units are calculated on the basis that 1 passenger plus baggage = 200lb. The passenger numbers are converted into freight tonnage by dividing the number by 11. The actual freight tonnage is then added to this figure. The use of WLUs as an industry indicator of performance appears to have lost favour in recent years, but it still remains a good method of testing airport performance for rating purposes in that it combines passenger and freight performance into a single figure.\n\nPossible Disabilities [some which may have been taken into account in the land values adopted]\n\nDisabilities frequently encountered include:\n\nFlying restrictions, limiting the duration of operational hours, or the nature of aircraft using the airport. This is frequently related to proximity of housing.\n\nRemote location, or distance from population centres, reducing demand for passenger flights or club membership.\n\nAccess problems, including poor local road network, poor signage, distance from motorways etc.\n\nCompetition from larger local airports.\n\nGenerally poor layout, design etc, not reflected at stage II.\n\nAbnormally high maintenance costs.\n\nInfrastructure provided in advance of requirement\n\nInfrastructure external to the hereditament not provided to service the airport\n\nAPPENDIX 2\n\nValuation Approach for Categories C - E\n\nThis section arises out of past discussions between the VOA and representatives of the British Gliding Association (BGA) and will be of assistance when discussing proposals / appeals. This guidance includes reference to helipads and heliports\n\nThe key purpose of this review is to achieve consistency of approach to the valuation of these hereditaments.\n\nThis note aims to guide the caseworker in establishing the facts and evidence to allow the right valuation judgements to be made. This hopefully will lead to a valuation which is not only realistic in terms of the level of activity at the hereditament, but is in line with the rateable values of similar hereditaments.\n\nAs described in Rating Manual Volume 5: Section 250, only those parts of the hereditament under the occupation or paramount control of the airstrip / helipad / heliport operator will be included in the assessment. Normal rating principles will be applied in determining paramount control.\n\nThe basis of valuation\n\nFollowing discussions with industry representatives and further research, it has become apparent that the contractor’s basis of valuation will provide the most consistent outcomes. The rental evidence largely refers to the land only on which the airstrip sits and consequently it is necessary to value the land and buildings and other features by other means. Rather than having a complex hybrid valuation methodology for which there is little or no legal authority, it is considered the best method would be to use the contractor’s basis.\n\nAdjustments and allowances for the contractor’s element There are five principal ways in which the contractor’s basis of valuation can be adjusted to reflect the situations prevailing at airstrips, gliding clubs and similar hereditaments. They are:-\n\na. Value only those parts of the airfield / helipad / heliport appropriate to the operation being carried out;\n\nb. Omit those parts totally redundant or surplus to requirements, or in excess of the required operations at the airstrip/ helipad / heliport;\n\nc. At stage 2, reflect by allowances the disabilities which may exist in the items valued at stage 1;\n\nd. Value an appropriate area of land at an appropriate value in the light of the facts;\n\ne. Make allowance at stage 5 for those disabilities not taken account of in stages 1-4\n\nSpecific Features\n\nThese are to be added to the value of the land:\n\nSurfaced Runways / helipads and heliports\n\nThe runway, particularly if surfaced, is normally the most costly part of an airfield or strip, especially in the case of a small airfield. Careful consideration will need to be given in circumstances where, for historical reasons it may be that rural airfields have runways vastly in excess of what is now required (e.g. wartime and ex-MOD airfields). The value arising from such a runway may be substantial and it is for the valuer to consider whether the additional value is justifiable. In many cases VOs should consider the substitute approach, valuing what is reasonably required by the operator, rather than the actual runway. As a guide:\n\nA runway of maximum 1000 x 30 m [30,000 sq m] should be considered to be the norm for a gliding site, but some are less, in which event the smaller area would be valued (reference to Pooley’s Flight Guide may be of assistance here and further advice may be sought from one of the specialist airport valuers ).\n\nThe minimum for a helipad is likely to be in the order of 38m x16 m and some may be significantly larger resembling short air strips [235m x 32m].\n\nHelipads and heliports within this category consist of stand-alone hereditaments which are not subordinate parts of larger hereditaments, such as a race course or hotel, which are Category E. Stand-alone Heliports and Helipads should be identified from Pooley’s Guide and confirmed by site inspections.\n\nOnce identified, the Non Domestic Rating Unit should notify NVU, of stand-alone Heliports and Helipads so they can be added to the list included in the Practice Note.\n\nThe basis of valuation will be the contractor’s basis and the helipad will attract costs and allowances in line with those for concrete aprons and other similar features to be found on airports. See the tables of costs and allowances in the Practice Note for the appropriate list.\n\nGrass Airstrips\n\nAt some sites ground stabilisation and drainage will have taken place to improve the durability of the runway. This may take the form of tar-spraying or earth consolidation using a mixture with cement. A surface coating may then be applied. Drainage, if present, may either be by mole-drainage or trenched tile drainage, or ideally a combination of the two. The valuation of grass runways will therefore depend on the nature of the surface, and costs will vary from £1.00 p s m for simple levelling, rolling and mowing to £2.50 p s m for drained and stabilised runway surfaces.\n\nAs a guide, a runway of 1000 x 30 m [30,000 sq m] would be considered to be the maximum at a gliding site, but some are less, in which event the smaller area would be valued.\n\nTaxiways\n\nWhere taxiways are valued or relevant to the airstrip in question, substitute widths of 10m - 15m will normally provide sufficient width. Costs will depend on the specification and will follow the guidance above or VOA Cost Guide rates. (Pooley’s flight guide may be of assistance here and further advice may be sought from one of the specialist airport valuers.)\n\nAprons\n\nAprons should be included to the extent that they form an operational purpose and would be included in a substitute hereditament. Evidence of actual use should be sufficient. Costs will depend on the specification and will follow the guidance above or VOA Cost Guide rates. (Particular care should be taken when costing aprons and stands to adopt the correct PCN)\n\nRoads\n\nRoads, particularly airside, are often surplus to requirements. Actual use may only take place through convenience rather than necessity and consideration should be given to the minimum necessary layout to provide reasonable access to pavements, particularly for fire vehicles, without undue inconvenience. Costs will depend on specification - e.g. curbs, lighting etc, and will follow VOA Cost Guide rates.\n\nBuildings\n\nNormally buildings forming part of the hereditament will be included in their entirety at stage I, although building that are totally disused or redundant at the AVD should be omitted. The nature of the airstrip operation and the likely provision in a substitute hereditament should be considered. Surpluses may occur in area, or height and where this is a factor in the costing or values used, appropriate allowances may be given. The general principle should however be observed that if a facility is essential for the operation, even only for a relatively small proportion of the time, it will probably not be surplus to any extent. This may well occur in buildings, which although of appropriate size, may have an outdated design or facilities not compatible with modern operations, warranting a separate allowance. Normally hangar type buildings will be valued having regard to the cost of equivalent agricultural buildings rather than the more sophisticated hangars found on commercial airfields\n\nFees to be adopted at a rate of 9%. It will be necessary to override the default % on the NBS spreadsheet and enter 9% manually. The RICS / BCIS Indices will be used for location factor adjustments.\n\nLand\n\nThe total area of the airstrip should exclude areas beyond what might be regarded as necessary for operational requirements and may be present only for historic reasons. A realistic approach should be taken based upon a ring fence around all facilities and including intervening grass areas which would normally be required in any substitute hereditament.\n\nIt is agreed with the BGA that the whole site will be valued on the basis of the land being at the prevailing bare agricultural land value in the locality but having regard to the circumstances and character of the particular site. As a guide the site area of no more than 30 hectares would be appropriate. Guidance as to the agricultural value to be adopted can be obtained by reference the relevant Practice Note in respect of land values (hyperlink).\n\nThe lump sum cost additions for Septic Tank Drainage; Mains Electricity; Mains Water and any End Additions are to be found in the VO PN for these classes.\n\nThere may be other features on the airfield site which merit an addition. These are likely to be limited to such features as caravan pitches and in these circumstances it is agreed that an addition should be made having regard to the local tone.\n\nDisabilities and end allowances\n\nThe purpose of occupation of the airstrip will be a relevant consideration, whether for club, private or social use.\n\nThe end allowance will have regard to whether the actual occupiers are likely to be the only potential tenants, whether profitability would be the primary objective of the hypothetical tenant at a particular site It is not feasible to give guidance on individual allowances for all factors of stage 5 or other end allowances, since each will depend on it merits.\n\nConsideration may also be given, to the possibility of agricultural exemption where the airstrip is occupied with an agricultural property, for which the normal principles of the exemption will apply. It should be noted that, particularly in the case of minor and privately owned airports and airstrips, the Contractor’s Basis may produce an apparently high rateable value at Stage IV. There should be an objective review of Stage V allowances, requiring a knowledge of the circumstances of the operation of the airport, to ensure that the rateable value is compatible with the level of activity of which the airport is capable. Close co-ordination by NVU and Non Domestic Rating Unit Valuers is important at this stage. The BGA has put forward the following grounds for Stage 5 Allowances. Any allowances under these heads have not been quantified but the totality of allowances should only exceed 10% in exceptional circumstances The following list shows the end allowances that may be applicable at many gliding clubs, but this should not be considered as a comprehensive list:\n\na) Airspace Restrictions – Airspace restrictions are defined as statutory air space restrictions imposed by the CAA, restrictions arising from the Air Navigation Orders, restrictions arising from neighbours, and air safety requirements. At their most severe these restrictions will limit the times and duration of airfield operations, including limitations on the circuits that can be flown. A medium restriction would be where local air traffic routes limit operations in the immediate vicinity of the site (e.g. within 5 nautical miles), or where it is necessary to have a local operational agreement with a local airport/airfield operator. At the lower end of the scale would be airspace restricting area navigational access to a site or physical restrictions caused by objects such as wind turbines.\n\nb) Access Restrictions – Gliding site are often remote to public access roads and/or have restrictions imposed by third parties. Gliding Clubs rely on adequate public access, so such restrictions can limit/restrict club viability. The severity of such restrictions is site specific and should not require any specialist knowledge to evaluate. At the severe level access might be over unmade roads owned by third parties with restrictions on access. Sites remote from public highways might be at a medium level.\n\nc) Non Exclusive Site Use – Many if not most gliding sites have a shared use, most commonly a dual agricultural use. For example many clubs share their sites with grazing animals requiring the herding of animals prior to and post flying, with the attendant problems of animal faeces. This restricts hours of operation and increases costs. At its most severe the site is in effect in agricultural use with gliding being a secondary use. Here the hours of operation in each type of use may be the best indication of the severity of this restriction. The restrictions in this category are caused by consecutive use as distinguished from (d) below where the issue is concurrent use.\n\nd) Multiple Site Use - Gliding Clubs rarely have sole use of an airfield and its environs and have to operate in parallel with other commercial/sports organisations. Adjacent land may have agricultural or commercial use that restricts gliding operations. For example farming on adjacent (and often open unfenced land), mean that winching operations have to be curtailed or cease; as the risk of dropping cables on farm machinery and personnel is too high. Such restrictions are usually periodic (harvesting etc.). Similarly many clubs have adjacent commercial operations and traffic which restrict operations. At its most severe a club might have to permanently limit the area useable for flying operations, or cease operations in certain wind directions. Again the degree and period of restriction should be used to categorise the severity of the restriction.\n\ne) Public Rights of Way - Many gliding clubs are in National Parks, AONBs, or similar attractive areas desirable to tourists, ramblers etc. The statutory rights to roam and/or public footpaths adjacent to, or across an airfield cause significant operational restrictions. These may require the operation of safety procedures restricting frequency of flights and may vary according to wind direction. Such restrictions should be able to be measured subjectively in relation to the duration of restrictions, or the effect on flight frequency.\n\nf) Planning Restrictions - Many gliding sites have planning restrictions that limit air navigational use. These restrictions may cover timing, frequency and/or the type of air navigational operations that are allowed.\n\ng) Statutory Restrictions - Many gliding clubs occupy sites formally owned or partially owned by a statutory authority (usually the MOD). In most cases the authority limits the use of land that is in, or was in its ownership. Summary The effect of restrictions such as those above may have a parallel or cumulative effect on the operations of a club. While it is recognised that end allowances are by their nature subjective, there needs to be some form of objective framework that provides a consistency of approach and valuation. Typically we would suggest that a club that has multiple limitations of a medium to severe level be allocated the highest end allowances.\n\nSummary\n\nThe effect of restrictions such as those above may have a parallel or cumulative effect on the operations of a club.
