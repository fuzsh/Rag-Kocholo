        "text": "Post by PB on\n\nThe Forum is still very wet behind the ears, having walked the tricky pathway of working out how to set the thing up, and where things go until early this morning..As I write these preamble to the future I have a couple of things in mind today..\n\nFirst, I should like to dedicate the site to my fallen friends who are unable to join us during our journey back to the past. I will always miss them.\n\nSecond, please accept that the Forum is only just taking its first flight, that the back-room calculations have been pretty minimal and I just hope we can make some proving flights while embellishing the 'product' as I clamber up the learning curve.\n\nSo without more ado, here is just one photo to launch the many many more that are sure to follow...\n\n\"Photo of the Day\"\n\n31/01/15\n\nIf ever a photograph carried something of the true meaning of Blackbushe Airport, this gathering of Eagle Airways Vikings and passengers taken in the 1950's surely captures a taste of the Blackbushe magic? At the time Blackbushe was London's second airport, but sadly in May, 1960, the government's axe fell full force on this magnificent airfield that had become the birth place of post-war British independent aviation. Prior to that as RAF Hartford Bridge, the airfield was a key weapon in the Tactical Air Force's operations and home to numerous allied air forces who through necessity found a safe home at what today we call, \"Blackbushe\".\n\nMore photos will follow on a daily basis - as far as possible - a long job, but the airfield's past must never be forgotten, nor must those who lives were influenced by it..\n\nPost by PB on\n\n\"Photo of the Day\"\n\n01/02/15\n\nFebruary dawns!! Day two of the resurrected photographs bearing evidence of ye olde days of Blackbushe. February, the month I dread more each year. Long ago it was the cold dark month that witnessed my first touch down on planet Earth, early in the dawn of time but slightly after the Jurassic age, though some may wonder!!\n\nToday, finding myself sitting in the same old chair, before the same computer screen, covering the \"Photo of the Day\" once again leaves me with an odd feeling. I had a strong feeling that we'd be back after the unsolicited removal of my previous four years serving the daily photo cause, but I suddenly feel that there might be some expectations that I cannot rise to. By that I think I mean that writing on the deceased thread was just a stroll though the photos in the company of what seemed appropriate words conveying facts, emotions, and things as I saw them. Running air-shows to stepping on dog poo on the Blackbushe 'common land' were all a part of my daily drone. Nothing to live up to, it just spilled out. Now it seems I have something to live up to. Can't copy the old words, so here we go again with the hopes that whatever gets written finds your approval.........\n\nSo...\n\nThis cool view of Blackbushe resident Viking G-AHOS would have been more apt yesterday as we had fresh snowfall. However, Orion's lovely old aeroplane provides another example of how Blackbushe Airport provided the most exceptional close-up views of commercial airliners from the comfort of your car! Or in my case, your bike... As a young cyclist, \"HOS\" became a regular friend as she was often on view between services. First seen at Blackbushe in May, 1957, she arrived as an ex BWIA machine for Eagle Airways. She joined Orion in August '57 becoming a feature in her distinctive green colour scheme until May, 1960. The government closed Blackbushe on 31st May, 1960. The resident airlines had no choice. Leave, or die... Sadly, Orion did not last too much longer.\n\nToday, we still have flying at Blackbushe. No commercial services, but at least it's bones are still rattling and who knows what the future holds for her surviving runway??\n\nThanks for looking in...time for breakfast!\n\nPB"
