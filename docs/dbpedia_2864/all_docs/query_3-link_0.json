        "text": "Aircraft failing to comply with NPRs and/or noise limits may be subject to additional charges as set out in the London Biggin Hill Airport Schedule of Fees and Charges. As with other London airports, frequent or repeated noise and/or track violations may result in a permanent exclusion from the airport.\n\nCalibrated Noise Monitors are located approximately 1 KM from the threshold of each runway and lie directly under the approach and departure path. Additionally, a mobile noise monitor may be positioned anywhere from time to time deemed appropriate by the airport operator. Nominal departure track limits are programmed into the NMTKS along with minimum heights set at two points in the standard departure route.\n\nOn departure speed should be restricted to V2+25 KIAS and in any case no more than 185 KIAS, in accordance with the Standard Departure Route (SDR), until passing over BIG eastbound in order to achieve the best practical angle of climb whilst keeping thrust to the minimum required for an expeditious departure.\n\nOn crossing the upwind end of Runway 21, an immediate right turn should be commenced to track 220° M in order to avoid residential housing located at Norheads Farm. In accordance with the SDR, a right turn should be commenced promptly at BIG 1 DME in order to route back over the airfield on track towards DET. Speed in excess of 185 KIAS will result in a radius of turn which exceeds the designated track limits and may therefore result in a track violation. In strong south/southwesterly winds, particular attention should be given to radius of turn.\n\nIn order to safely maintain the relatively low speed mandated by this procedure and dependent upon aircraft type, consideration should be given to delaying flap retraction until passing BIG outbound at or above 2100 FT AMSL in order to ensure a sufficiently tight radius of turn is achievable.\n\nOn departure speed should be restricted to V2+25 KIAS and in any case no more than 185 KIAS until at or above 2100 FT AMSL in order to achieve the best practical angle of climb whilst keeping thrust to the minimum required whilst at low level.\n\nIn order to safely maintain the relatively low speeds required by this procedure and dependent upon aircraft type, consideration should be given to delaying flap retraction until at or above 2100 FT AMSL in order to ensure a sufficiently tight radius of turn is achieved.\n\nThe procedure is designed to prevent unnecessary overflight of the built up areas lying to the north of the airport. Pilots should pay particular attention to avoiding overflight of these areas. Excessive speed on departure or a failure to commence a right turn immediately upon reaching BIG 1 DME will likely result in a track violation.\n\nAll circuits at London Biggin Hill Airport are conducted to the west of the aerodrome (Right Hand - Runway 21, Left Hand - Runway 03). Overflight of the following Noise Sensitive Areas should be avoided, unless necessary to fulfil an ATC instruction such as to extend downwind for spacing, Keston Village The Leavesdon Estate and Leaves Green. Aircraft unable to comply with these requirements should not plan to make use of London Biggin Hill Airport.\n\nThe NMTKS will track all aircraft arriving at and departing from London Biggin Hill Airport. Aircraft entering a Noise Sensitive Area will automatically become the subject of a track violation report which will be considered by the airport Noise Abatement and Safety Review Board (SANARB) for consideration of a penalty charge. All penalty charges levied are donated to local good causes. In the case of repeated violations of wither noise or track limits, permanent exclusion from the airport may result.\n\nRunway 03: Aircraft and crews equipped and approved for RNAV1 operations can expect to be cleared to fly the RNAV1 Transition for Runway 21 as detailed in AD 2-EGKB-7-1 (and its associated database coding table) followed by an instrument approach to Runway 21 and then circle to land on Runway 03 – this is subject to ATC clearance, weather minima and traffic conditions.\n\nAfter passing JACKO or GODLU, non-RNAV1 arrivals will be vectored by ATC for arrival at Biggin Hill prior to transfer to Biggin Hill for the appropriate approach procedure. In the event of RCF the procedures detailed in EGKB AD 2.22 paragraph 6 are to be followed.\n\nVFR Arrivals from the East:\n\nPilots should make first contact with Biggin Approach no later than 5 NM from Biggin Hill. Unless ATC issue alternative joining instructions, all aircraft should route and report 3 NM due east of Biggin Hill Airport (Note 1) descending to circuit height of 1000 FT QFE (altitude 1600 FT QNH) (Note 2), route over the mid-point of Runway 21/03 and turn downwind left-hand or right-hand as required.\n\nNote 1: Due to Runway 03 departure procedures, pilots should at all times avoid routing towards the north-eastern section of the Biggin Hill ATZ. Pilots should not turn towards the Biggin Hill ATZ until south of M25 Junction 4 (remaining at least 5 NM away from Biggin Hill) or as directed by Biggin Hill ATC.\n\nNote 2: Pilots should arrange their flight to be level at circuit height no later than 3 NM from Biggin Hill unless there is conflicting traffic. Caution: aircraft leaving the Biggin Hill ATZ between altitude 2000-2400 FT QNH eastbound.\n\nVFR Arrivals from the North, West and South:\n\nPilots should make first contact with Biggin Hill Approach at the earliest opportunity, in all cases, no later than 5 NM from Biggin Hill Airport. All inbound aircraft shall route as directed by Biggin Hill ATC and be level at circuit height of 1000 FT QFE (altitude 1600 FT QNH) no later than 3 NM from Biggin Hill unless there is conflicting traffic.\n\nCaution: Aircraft joining from the west should avoid overflying Kenley Gliding site."
