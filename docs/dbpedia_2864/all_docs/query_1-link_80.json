        "text": "No aeroplane registered in the United Kingdom shall use the aerodrome unless there is contained in its Flight Manual data and procedures for approach path angles of 5.5° or steeper and no other aeroplane shall use the aerodrome unless it has data and procedures for approach path angles of 5.5° or steeper which have been approved or otherwise authorised by the regulatory authority of the State in which it is registered.\n\nThe use of the aerodrome is subject to prior permission of the Airport Director. Additionally operators of aircraft are required to satisfy the Airport Director that they are able to comply with local noise restrictions applicable to the airport.\n\nExtensions to opening hours (shown by the latest NOTAM) are available on request to the Airport Director or his representative. Delayed aircraft may be permitted to operate 30 minutes beyond published maximum operating hours shown at AD 2.3 item 1 by prior arrangement.\n\nOperations by all aircraft shall be permitted only when the runway is dry, or if wet devoid of other than small areas of water not exceeding 3 MM in depth. Operations will be prohibited when the runway is contaminated by ice or slush to a depth exceeding 3 MM, or dry snow to a depth of 10 MM, or the reported friction measurement is reported as worse than 'medium' provided that this condition shall not apply if there is an appropriate entry covering operation from contaminated runways contained in the relevant flight manual.\n\nThe aerodrome is not available for use by single engine aircraft. Available to fixed-wing aircraft only. Recreational flying is not permitted.\n\nSingle pilot operations are not permitted.\n\nIt is not permitted to nominate EGLC as a diversion aerodrome.\n\nAll flights operating at London City Airport require a slot allocated by Airport Coordination Ltd (ACL). Requests for ad-hoc slot allocations should be made to ACL during working hours Mon-Fri 0830-1700 (0730-1600) by SITA: LONACXH; e-mail: lonacxh@acl-uk.org; or Tel: 0208-564 0605, Fax: 0208-564 0691. Outside these times, during published operating hours to Aerodrome Operations Stand Planner 0207-646 0083. OCS account holders can add, change and cancel slots at any time on the online coordination portal: https://www.online-coordination.com/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1.\n\nAll aircraft shall only commence start up and taxi when a marshaller is present and available to provide relevant signals.\n\nWhen operating on the aprons, high visibility tabards must be worn and fastened.\n\nGround service crews are responsible for removal of all chocks.\n\nPilots are requested to use minimum power when manoeuvring on and off parking stands and when entering the runway. The use of minimum power is particularly emphasised when holding at the entry points to the runway and when entering the runway.\n\nParking: Pilots should self-manoeuvre their aircraft on to the appropriate stand lead-in line (as directed by ATC) and approach the stand as closely as possible. Direction to the final parking position will be provided by marshallers. Under no circumstances may aircraft enter a stand without guidance from marshallers.\n\nUnder no circumstances may aircraft self park or taxi without guidance from marshallers.\n\nGA Apron: Pilots will be directed by ATC to taxi to the Jet Centre. Pilots must then follow the marshaller’s instructions for parking.\n\nTo ensure adequate wing tip clearance is maintained from adjacent stands, it is imperative that pilots follow the lead-out markings on all stands.\n\nPre-departure ATC clearance by datalink (DCL) is available at London City Airport for suitably equipped aircraft. If an attempt to obtain DCL is unsuccessful aircraft must instead request via RTF. Pilots are to request departure clearance no later than EOBT - 10.\n\nIf the aircraft is not adequately positioned on stand the pilot should proceed as directed by ATC. Prior to undertaking the manoeuvre, in order to re-position onto stand, the pilot must request permission from ATC to enter the taxilane and advise ATC if the aircraft is unable to follow the stand lead-off line. Only once permission has been granted by ATC shall the pilot commence the movement into the taxilane.\n\nUse of aircraft Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) are subject to strict controls as set out in published airport regulations. Between the hours of Mon-Fri 0630-2200 (0530-2100); Sat 0630-1230 (0530-1130); Sun 1230-2200 (1130-2100), APUs should be shut down as soon as practicable following arrival and not restarted until 10 minutes prior to departure, except when the outside air temperature (as promulgated by ATC) is below +5C or above +20C. Flights with departure times at or just after published airfield opening time are able to start APU from STD -10 mins but not before Mon-Sat 0620 (0520) or Sun 1220 (1120).\n\nOperators wishing to use their APU during the above conditions should contact ATC and inform them of APU start-up. This will allow ATC and AOSUAO to note APU running times that may be required by the local authority.\n\nThe use of APUs are not permitted outside of published airfield operating hours unless the airfield operating hours have been extended. Fixed Electrical Ground Power (FEGP) or Mobile Ground Power (MGP) must be used whenever available and serviceable.\n\nPilots should caution other aircraft in the process of parking when taxiing.\n\nE295/E290/BCS1 – Stand 10L.\n\nWhen parking on Stand 10, E295/E290/BCS1 pilots should plan to enter/exit at Alpha or Bravo as instructed by ATC10L,. E295/E290/BCS1 are not permitted along the full length ofto vacate the Main Taxiwayrunway at Alpha. When parking Stand 10L, Stand 9 will be vacant.\n\nAll Standard Instrument Departures have stop altitudes of 3000 FT due to presence of London TMA traffic 1000 FT above.\n\nDeparture Speed Restriction: In order to optimise the departure flow and assist in the separation between successive departing aircraft a speed limit of 250 KT IAS below FL 100 is applicable until removed by ATC. ATC may remove the speed restriction by using the phrase ‘No ATC Speed Restriction’. Pilots are reminded that this phrase does not relieve the pilot of the responsibility to adhere to the ground track of the Noise Preferential Route, which may require a speed/power limitation.\n\nIf for any reason pilots are unable to comply with the 250 KT IAS speed restriction the pilot should immediately advise ATC and state the minimum speed acceptable. If a pilot anticipates before departure that they will be unable to comply with the speed restriction, they should inform ATC when requesting start-up clearance, stating the minimum speed acceptable. In this case the pilot will be informed before take-off of any higher speed limitation.\n\nNote: RNAV 1 Departures via SOQQA\n\nPilots are to follow the RNAV 1 departure route as indicated in Chart AD 2-EGLC-6-4. However, crews should be aware that early climb instructions will be given by ATC to reach FL 70/80 by SODVU for integration with the RNAV1 Transition Arrival procedure; this will be followed by routine vectoring to join the ATS en-route network.\n\nATC may request a 7 DME NE London City position report from pilots upon departure from London City. When departing Runway 27, 7 DME NE London City is approximately equivalent to LON 25.5D, LCE04 or LCN06. When departing Runway 09, 7 DME NE London City is approximately equivalent to LON 27D, CLN 38D or LCE02."
