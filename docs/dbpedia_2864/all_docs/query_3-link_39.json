        "text": "Denver International Airport, with almost 70 mio passengers the fifth busiest airport in the USA and #16 worldwide. DIA was opened in 1995 and replaced the former Stapelton airport. With six runways on almost 35000 acres, the areal of the airport is enourmous and has plenty of room for expansions. The high amount of passengers is caused by United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines. All three carriers use DIA as a hub. Even the passangers numbers are so high, international carriers are a rare sight. Lufthansa, Icelandair, Norwegian, Edelweiss (charter) and British Airways are the only airlines from Europe. Asian or UAE carriers are scarce commodity.\n\nCargo terminal receives traffic that takes the form of UPS, FedEx and Prime Air 767s. UPS and FedEx MD-11F, A300F, and 757F also fly here. During the Christmas season, there are sometimes UPS 747-400 aircraft. Once a day, DHL sends a 737-400 and 767-200F. These usually fly in at extreme hours of the day, usually very early.\n\nWritten by Tyler Chan (Follow him on Instagram). Pictures provided by Watts Brooks, Yixin Chen and Caleb Fleming.
