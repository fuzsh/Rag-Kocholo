        "text": "Aircraft paint schemes are not just about looking good on the runway or in the hangar. The type of pain tthe \"canvas\" (airframe), and especially the application and the upkeep all need to be considered before deciding on Maui Blue or Rainforest Green.\n\nPaint is more than aesthetics — it affects the weight of the aircraft and its aerodynamics. Paint helps to protect the integrity of the airframe. It can also impact the economics of operation as the more downtime incurred from frequent painting and paint maintenance, the less time the aircraft is available for revenue-generating assignments. However, the aesthetic aspect can affect how \"safe\" one feels about an aircraft. Seeing chipped and cracked paint around a doorway as one boards the aircraft will give one pause as to how well the rest of the aircraft is maintained.\n\nOnce while boarding a small, commuter plane, a passenger looked out the window and exclaimed to the rest of the group that there was a crack on the engine and that he was not going to fly on this plane. Granted, the pilot came for a looksee, and in an effort to appease the passenger, sent for the maintenance crew to check it out.\n\nOur passenger-induced maintenance resulted in a flurry of panic for many onboard who quickly consulted their airline timetables for another flight. As it turned out, the \"crack\" in the engine was a split in the paint on the nacelle. The inspection and subsequent diagnosis took very little time, but it took almost an hour to get some of the passengers calmed down and back on the plane.\n\nPainting is an art\n\nAircraft painting is an art and a skill. Given the myriad of materials being developed for airframes, the aerospace coatings industry must keep pace with every advancement and those who perform paint application must also stay current with new products, new technologies and new application techniques.\n\nIn November 2000, The Sherwin-Williams Company opened a 25,000-sq.-ft., state-of-the-art facility in Andover, Kansas, near Wichita, for its Aerospace Coatings division. The new building incorporates training classrooms, customer service offices, color blending labs, and research and development offices.\n\nClimate-controlled comfort\n\nA 20-ft by 45-ft., temperature-controlled paint booth is the highlight of the facility as it will be used to train application technicians of all skill levels in improving their craft.\n\nNo matter what type of environment these technicians work in — whether it’s Miami in July, Minneapolis in December, or something in between — the paint booth can be programmed to achieve those conditions so that technicians can best learn how to perform painting and depainting processes within those constraints.\n\nOn-site training\n\nStuart Mack, Director – Technical Development for Sherwin-Williams Aerospace Coatings is responsible for the development of the various training programs on offer at the facility. The curriculum covers a wide spectrum of painting and depainting issues, as well as safety and environmental matters.\n\nThe inaugural training modules began in February 2001. Mack says the people who should attend the training courses vary from application technicians – of all levels of expertise – to supervisors and managers, to salespeople and distributors. Each of these groups will benefit from obtaining a better understanding of the tasks involved and best practices for painting aircraft.\n\n\"Class size is limited to 12 people right now,\" explains Mack. \"We will continue to revise and develop the curriculum with feedback from attendees.\"\n\nSome of the training modules available involve Depainting and Preparation for Painting; Topcoating; Touch Up and Spot Repair; Interior Coatings; Equipment and Spray Environment; and Safety and Environmental Issues. At the end of the training, attendees are awarded a Certificate of Completion and shops are presented with plaques from Sherwin-Williams.\n\nHigh solids vs. low solids\n\n\"It is very different to paint using a compliant, high solid coating than a low solid coating,\" cautions Mack. \"High solid coatings have a lot less solvent than low solids — it’s the solvent that is the carrier of the pigments, resins, and additives that make up the paint.\"\n\nWhile the EPA warns of the dangers of excessive solvents, for the technicians, less solvent in the mix produces new challenges in the application.\n\n\"Equipment and its setup become very important when making the shift from conventional painting processes to high solids application,\" continues Mack. \"Sherwin-Williams tries to help the end user properly configure equipment in order to promote a successful shoot.\"\n\nThe same holds true for objects to paint. The training center provides a variety of airframe materials for students to learn and practice the painting processes, or students can bring in their own materials.\n\nWax on, wax off\n\nWith so much riding on the success or failure of the paint job, upkeep is an integral element to the well-being of the finish.\n\n\"Some waxes can actually hurt the paint it is supposed to protect,\" says Mack.\n\nAnd, according to Mack, you can’t use just any cleaner on aircraft. Scrubbing splattered bugs off the wing with abrasive pads will do more damage than the bugs ever did.\n\n\"Cleaners, and even waxes, can contain cleaning agents that can do harm to the thin layer of protective resin on the surface of the aircraft.\"\n\nFor this reason, Sherwin-Williams has developed its own polish and cleaners to work specifically with – not against – its paint products.\n\nCustomer feedback\n\nCustomer feedback is important and encouraged at the training center. Not only will comments on the courses be helpful in improving the overall training experience, but Sherwin-Williams asks for feedback on the products in an effort to help its Research and Development team improve present and future offerings.\n\nDallas Finch, the Facility and Technical Director at the Aerospace Service and Training Center, offers that it’s no accident that the training center, color labs, customer service, and research and development are all under one roof.\n\n\"Excellent testing equipment certainly helps in the development and improvement of new products and improvement in our existing products,\" says Finch, \"but ultimately, the customer input as to how the products perform in real-life, real-time situations provides the greatest influence in the work being done by our research team.\"\n\nHow long should a paint job last?\n\nMack explains that the life expectancy of a paint job is directly related to its care and maintenance. Granted, there are some aircraft owners who wish to have their planes painted every year, whether it needs it or not, but a well-maintained aircraft that is properly stored can last for many years.\n\nThe new training available at the Center provides attendees with the latest information on proper coatings application techniques and coatings-related matters to help them better serve their customer’s aesthetic, safety, and economic needs.
