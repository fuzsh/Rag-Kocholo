It is the fourth largest airport in London after Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.

Contact LunaJets to organize your private flight to +41 22 782 12 12 or fill out the online form here.\n\nOxford Airport (OXF)\n\nIt is a privately owned airport located near Kidlington Cherwell District, Oxfordshire, 7 mi (10km) northwest of Oxford, 62 mi (110km) from Central London. It specialises in general and business aviation. Its location is ideal if you want to access the Shires around London. Air access and ground transportation have improved in the last years. Contact LunaJets to organize your private flight to +41 22 782 12 12 or fill out the online form here.\n\nNortholt (NHT)\n\nThis is a Royal Air Force airbase in South Ruislip, 2 mi from Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon, West London. Approximately 6 mi (10km) north of London Heathrow airport, the airbase also handles a large number of private civilian flights with prior permission. Northolt has one runway in operation, with a grooved asphalt surface. This airport is used most by the British government, for Head of State, diplomatic and governmental flights, because it is the closest to Downing Street But be careful, the airport closes at night. Contact LunaJets to organize your private flight to +41 22 782 12 12 or fill out the online form here.\n\nSouthend (SEN)\n\nThis is an international airport in the district of Rochford, Essex, England, east of London. It was very practical during the 2012 Olympic games because of its proximity to the Olympic Village. However, road access to the city center is not smooth and fast. The airport is not open at night: it closes 45 minutes after the last scheduled flight and opens every day at 4am. Contact LunaJets to organize your private flight to +41 22 782 12 12 or fill out the online form here.\n\nLondon City Airport (LCY)\n\nIt is located on a former Docklands site in the London Borough of Newham, some 7 mi (10km) East of the City of London. London City Airport has a single 4,900 ft long runway open to commercial and private aviation. London City Airport is a small airport compared to the four main international airports of London. However due to its close proximity to the Docklands and financial district, its main users are business executives, Forbes 1,000 CEO’s and bankers. London City Airport is the closest airport to central London, open to private jets. Attendance at the airport is much higher in winter because a number of airlines fly to ski destinations including Zurich, Geneva and Sion. However, pilots need specific training and aircraft must have special options to land and take-off in LCY. For these reasons, only a few private planes are authorised to land. It is also the most expensive airport in London in taxes and parking. Contact LunaJets to organize your private flight to +41 22 782 12 12 or fill out the online form here.\n\nHeathrow (LHR) and Gatwick (LGW)\n\nBoth airports are known for being the largest international airports in the United Kingdom and exceptionally they also welcome business aircraft. The priority for landing and arrival is given primarily to commercial flights. Therefore, LunaJets recommend those two airports only in case of connection with a commercial international or intercontinental flight. Otherwise your flight could be delayed in favour of other commercial airplanes, and costs are higher compared to the other London airports.\n\nBlackbushe Airport (BBS)\n\nBlackbushe Airport, in Camberley is located at the border of Hampshire and Surrey. It is a small airport offering personalized and exclusive facilities for private aviation. Contact LunaJets to organize your private flight to +41 22 782 12 12 or fill out the online form here.\n\nFarnborough (FAB)\n\nIt is situated west of London and very close to Ascot and Windsor. This is the ultimate private airport open exclusively to business aviation. Very chic, it has a private terminal designed by top UK architect Baron Norman Foster. However, the airport closes at night and traffic is restricted on weekends to protect local residents from excessive aircraft noise. This airport together with Biggin Hill, are the airports that LunaJets uses the most. Contact LunaJets to organize your private flight to +41 22 782 12 12 or fill out the online form here.\n\nBiggin Hill Airport (BQH)\n\nIt is situated in the London Borough of Bromley, located 14 mi (20km) South of Central London. The airport was formerly the Royal Air Force station and a small enclave of the airport still retains that designation. It is open to private aircraft from 630am to 10pm on weekdays and from 9am to 8pm on weekends and holidays. It has the advantage that no runway slots are required and user charges are very advantageous.\n\nLydd (LYX)"
