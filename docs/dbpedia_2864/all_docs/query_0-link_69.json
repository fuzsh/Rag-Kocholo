        "text": "Welcome to AKN Engineering, your trusted partner in precision engineering solutions for the modern construction and site engineering landscape.\n\nWith a strong foundation established in 2019 and a cumulative industry experience of 20+ years from our founders, we bring a wealth of expertise to every project we undertake.\n\nAs an ethnic minority business with 50% female leadership, we pride ourselves on our commitment to diversity and inclusivity. From our humble beginnings in setting out services, we have expanded our offerings to include site engineering services, topographic surveys, as-built surveys, machine control, and volume analysis.\n\nSetting out is a vital process in construction that involves marking the precise locations and dimensions of structures, roads, or other elements on a construction site. It ensures that the project is executed accurately and in accordance with the design plans. Surveyors and engineers use various tools and techniques to establish reference points, levels, and alignments, allowing construction teams to follow precise measurements and positioning during the building phase.\n\nTopographical surveys are detailed assessments of the natural and man-made features on a specific piece of land. These surveys provide crucial information about the elevation, contours, and physical characteristics of the site, including buildings, trees, bodies of water, and other relevant elements. By conducting topographical surveys, engineers and planners can gain a comprehensive understanding of the terrain, which is essential for making informed decisions during the design and construction phases of a project.\n\nAs-built surveys are conducted typically at the completion of a construction project to document the actual constructed conditions of the site and its improvements. These surveys serve as a comparison to the original design plans and specifications provided by the engineer during the planning phase. By conducting as-built surveys, engineers can ensure that the constructed elements align with the approved design and meet all required standards and regulations.\n\nThe main goal of volume calculation is to find out a volume of material that was mined or heaped up in predefined area and to verify if the volume corresponds to the expected value stated in project documentation. The volume is determined by a difference of topographies from two survey phases or by a difference between the survey and the project documentation.\n\nOur diverse team of experienced surveyors and site engineers brings a wealth of expertise across all of our services. Their collective experience spans a wide range of projects, from complex infrastructure developments to RC and steel frame constructions, including schools and high-rise buildings. Our engineers work collaboratively on our projects and providing a right first time service is something we pride ourselves on."
