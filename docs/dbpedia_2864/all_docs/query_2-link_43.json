        "text": "Definition\n\nA threshold not located at the extremity of a runway.\n\nSource: ICAO Annex 14\n\nDescription\n\nA displaced threshold is a threshold located at a point on the runway other than the designated beginning of the runway. Displacement of a threshold reduces the length of runway available for landings in this direction only. The portion of runway behind a displaced threshold is available for takeoffs in either direction and landings from the opposite direction.\n\nA threshold may be displaced either temporarily (due to e.g. construction works) or permanently.\n\nGround Marking and Lights\n\nA displaced threshold is marked by:\n\nA stripe showing the displaced threshold\n\nArrows along the centre line\n\nArrowheads across the width of the runway just prior the stripe in case of temporary displaced threshold\n\nNormally, runway edge lights are white (or yellow) in colour. However, in the case of a displaced threshold, the lights between the beginning of the runway and the displaced threshold are red in the approach direction (and white or yellow in the opposite direction). The runway threshold lights (green) are placed at the displaced threshold and are not co-located with the runway end lights (red).\n\nWhen the runway before a displaced threshold is unfit for the surface movement of aircraft, a closed runway marking (i.e. a large X sign painted on the ground) should be provided.\n\nWhen the surface before a threshold is paved and exceeds 60 m in length and is not suitable for normal use by aircraft, the entire length before the threshold should be marked with a chevron marking.\n\nAssociated Risks\n\nA departing aircraft may not use the full available take-off distance which, especially when combined with reduced thrust take-off, may result in:\n\nbecoming airborne closer to the runway end than expected\n\na Runway Excursion, especially if a rejected take off is made\n\nA departing crew may fail to properly align the aircraft with the runway centreline which often results in broken runway edge lights and FOD on the runway. Nighttime and the lack of runway centreline lights sometimes contribute to the confusion.\n\nA landing aircraft may touch down before the Touchdown Zone (TDZ). This is often caused by either poor pre-flight preparation or by inadequate ground marking. In any case, the reason for displacing the threshold (whether temporarily or permanently) is that landing before the TDZ was considered unsafe.\n\nA landing aircraft's crew may not be aware that the landing distance available is reduced in case of temporary displaced threshold or in case the reduction is applicable to both directions. This may result in a runway excursion.\n\nAccidents and Incidents\n\nA number of occurrences have happened that were somehow related to the presence of a displaced threshold and the risks described in the above section.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRunway Misalignment\n\nRunway Lighting\n\nRunway Designators\n\nTouchdown Zone (TDZ)\n\nWrong Runway Use\n\nFurther Reading"
