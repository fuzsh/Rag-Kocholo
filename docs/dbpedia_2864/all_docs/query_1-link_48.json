Subject to sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) below, any aircraft shall, after take-off, be operated in such a way that it will not cause more than 94 dBA Lmax by day (from 0700 to 2300 hours local time) as measured at any noise monitoring terminal at any of the sites referred to in sub-paragraph (2) above.\n\n4. Subject to sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) below, any aircraft shall, after take-off, be operated in such a way that it will not cause more than 89 dBA Lmax by night (from 2300 to 0700 hours local time) and that it will not cause more than 87 dBA Lmax during the night quota period (from 2330 to 0600 hours local time) as measured at any noise monitoring terminal at any of the sites referred to in sub-paragraph (2) above.\n\n5. The limits specified in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) above shall be adjusted in accordance with the following table in respect of any noise monitoring terminal at any of the sites referred to in the table in sub-paragraph (2) above to take account of the location of that terminal and its ground elevation relative to the aerodrome elevation.\n\nDescription\n\nAdjustment dBA\n\nSite 6\n\nminus 0.3\n\nSite 19 (A)\n\nplus 2.3\n\nSite 18 (B)\n\nplus 4.8\n\nSite 17 (C)\n\nminus 0.3\n\nSite 15 (D)\n\nminus 0.6\n\nSite 14 (E)\n\nminus 1.0\n\nSite 11 (F)\n\nplus 0.9\n\nSite 12 (G)\n\nminus 0.1\n\nSite 10 (H)\n\nplus 1.2\n\nSite 13 (I)\n\nminus 0.3\n\nSite 20 (J)\n\nminus 0.2\n\nSite 21 (K)\n\nplus 1.7\n\n6. For the purpose of determining an infringement of the limits specified in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) above, if the aircraft was required to take-off with a tailwind, an amount of up to 2 dB of the noise recorded at the noise monitor should be disregarded. The amount to be disregarded shall be:\n\n0.4 dB for a tailwind of up to 1 KT\n\n0.8 dB for a tailwind exceeding 1 KT but not exceeding 2 KT\n\n1.2 dB for a tailwind exceeding 2 KT but not exceeding 3 KT\n\n1.6 dB for a tailwind exceeding 3 KT but not exceeding 4 KT\n\n2.0 dB for a tailwind exceeding 4 KT.\n\nFor this purpose, tailwind is to be calculated from the wind data measured in the on-airfield anemometers and wind vanes according to the formula:\n\n(windspeed x cosine (runway heading minus wind direction)) x – 1.\n\n7. Where the aircraft is a jet aircraft, after passing the point referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, it shall maintain a gradient of climb of not less than 4% to an altitude of not less than 4000 FT. The aircraft shall be operated in such a way that progressively reducing noise levels at points on the ground under the flight path beyond that point are achieved.\n\n8. After the aircraft takes off from any runway specified in the first column of the following table, the aircraft shall follow the Noise Preferential Routeing Procedure specified in the third column of the table which relates to the ATC clearance previously given to the aircraft and specified in the second column of the table, whether flying in IMC or VMC:\n\nProvided that nothing in this sub-paragraph (8) shall apply:\n\nto any propeller driven aircraft whose MTWA does not exceed 5700 KG; or\n\nduring the period between 0600 and 2330 hours (local time), any propeller driven aircraft whose MTWA does not exceed 17000 KG or any Dash 7 aircraft.\n\nTake-off Runway\n\nATC Clearance\n\nProcedure\n\nTake-off Runway\n\nATC Clearance\n\nProcedure\n\n27R\n\nVia Compton\n\nStraight ahead to intercept LON VOR R255 until LON D7, then turn right onto NDB WOD QDM 268°, then to CPT VOR.\n\n27L\n\nVia Compton\n\nStraight ahead to intercept LON VOR R255 until LON D7, then turn right onto NDB WOD QDM 268°, then to CPT VOR.\n\nVia MAXIT\n\nStraight ahead to intercept LON VOR R255.

Where the aircraft is approaching the aerodrome to land it shall commensurate with its ATC clearance minimise noise disturbance by the use of continuous descent and low power, low drag operating procedures (referred to in Detailed Procedures for descent clearance in AD 2 paragraphs 3 and 4). Where the use of these procedures is not practicable, the aircraft shall maintain as high an altitude as possible. In addition, when descending on initial approach, including the closing heading, and on intermediate and final approach, thrust reductions should be achieved where possible by maintaining a ‘clean’ aircraft configuration and by landing with reduced flap, provided that in all the circumstances of the flight this is consistent with safe operation of the aircraft.\n\n10. Subject to sub-paragraph (11) below:\n\nBetween 0600 and 2330 hours (local time) where the aircraft is approaching Runway 27 (L or R) and is using the ILS in IMC or VMC it shall not descend on the glidepath below an altitude of 2500 FT (Heathrow QNH) before being established on the localizer, nor thereafter fly below the glidepath. An aircraft approaching without assistance from the ILS shall follow a descent path which will not result in its being at any time lower than the approach path that would be followed by an aircraft using the ILS glidepath, and shall follow a track to intercept the extended runway centre-line at or above 2500 FT.\n\nBetween 2330 and 0600 hours (local time) where the aircraft is approaching runway 27 (L or R) and is using the ILS in IMC or VMC it shall not descend on the glidepath below an altitude of 3000 FT (Heathrow QNH) before being established on the localizer at not less than 10 NM from touchdown, nor thereafter fly below the glidepath. An aircraft approaching without assistance from the ILS shall follow a descent path which will not result in its being at any time lower than the approach path that would be followed by an aircraft using the ILS glidepath, and shall follow a track to intercept the extended runway centre-line at or above 3000 FT.\n\nBetween 0700 and 2300 hours (local time) where the aircraft is approaching Runway 09 (L or R) and is using the ILS in IMC or VMC it shall not descend on the glidepath below an altitude of 2500 FT (Heathrow QNH) before being established on the localizer, nor thereafter fly below the glidepath. An aircraft approaching without assistance from the ILS shall follow a descent path which will not result in its being at any time lower than the approach path that would be followed by an aircraft using the ILS glidepath, and shall follow a track to intercept the extended runway centre-line at or above 2500 FT.\n\nBetween 2300 and 0700 hours (local time) where the aircraft is approaching Runway 09 (L or R) and is using the ILS in IMC or VMC it shall not descend on the glidepath below an altitude of 3000 FT (Heathrow QNH) before being established on the localizer at not less than 10 NM from touchdown, nor thereafter fly below the glidepath. An aircraft approaching without assistance from the ILS shall follow a descent path which will not result in its being at any time lower than the approach path that would be followed by an aircraft using the ILS glidepath, and shall follow a track to intercept the extended runway centre-line at or above 3000 FT.\n\n11. Nothing in sub-paragraph (10) above shall apply to any propeller driven aircraft whose MTWA does not exceed 5,700 KG.\n\n12. Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (1) - (11) above, the aircraft shall at all times be operated in a manner which is calculated to cause the least disturbance practicable in areas surrounding the aerodrome.\n\n13. The requirements set out in sub-paragraphs (1) - (12) above may at any time be departed from to the extent necessary for avoiding immediate danger or for complying with the instructions of an Air Traffic Control Unit.\n\n4 In this notice, except where the context otherwise requires:\n\n‘local time' means, during any period of summer time, the time fixed by or under the Summer Time Act 1972 (e), and outside that period, Universal Co-ordinated Time;\n\n‘dBA’ means a decibel unit of sound level measured on the A-weighted scale, which incorporates a frequency dependent weighting approximating the characteristics of human hearing;\n\n’Lmax’ means the highest instantaneous sound level recorded (with the noise monitoring terminal set at the slow meter setting);\n\nother abbreviations used are defined in GEN 2-2 of the United Kingdom Aeronautical Information Publication (Air Pilot).\n\nJ Hotchkiss\n\nDivisional Manager\n\nAviation Environmental Division\n\n7 April 2010\n\nDepartment for Transport\n\nS.I. 1981/651.\n\n1982 c.16.\n\nS.I. 1978/1303.\n\nThe Heathrow Airport – London (Noise Abatement Requirements) Notice 2004 signed by G Pendlebury on 24 March 2004.\n\n1972 c.6.\n\nNotes\n\n(These notes are not part of the notice)\n\n1. The Noise Preferential Routeing Procedures specified in the above notice are compatible with normal ATC requirements. The use of the routeings specified above is supplementary to noise abatement take-off techniques as used by piston-engined, turbo-prop, turbo- jet and turbo­fan aircraft.\n\n2. The attention of operators is drawn to the provisions of Section 78 (2) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, under which if it appears to the Secretary of State that any of the requirements in this notice have not been complied with as respects any aircraft, he may direct the manager of the aerodrome to withhold facilities for using the aerodrome from the operator of the aircraft. However, the Secretary of State accepts that occasional and exceptional breaches of the noise limits, or of the height requirement, would not be expected to lead to sanctions under Section 78 (2). Such breaches would, however, run the risk of financial penalties.\n\n3. Noise from ground running of aircraft engines is controlled in accordance with instructions issued by Heathrow Airport Limited.\n\n4. In the interests of noise abatement, certain restrictions are imposed on the operation of training flights at this aerodrome. Operators concerned are advised to obtain details from Heathrow Airport Limited.\n\n5. To minimise disturbance in areas adjacent to the aerodrome, commanders of aircraft are requested to avoid the use of reverse thrust after landing, consistent with the safe operation of the aircraft, between 2330 and 0600 hours (local time).\n\n6. Full details concerning the maximum number of occasions and the types of aircraft which are permitted to take off or land at night during specified periods at this aerodrome are promulgated by Supplement.\n\n7. For monitoring purposes, a descent will be deemed to have been continuous provided that no segment of level flight longer than 2.5 NM occurs below 6800 FT QNH and ‘level flight’ is interpreted as any segment of flight having a height change of not more than 50 FT over a track distance of 2 NM or more, as recorded in the airport Noise and track-keeping system.\n\n8. For monitoring purposes, a departure will be deemed to have complied with the Noise Preferential Routeing (NPR) if, in the portion of flight below the appropriate vectoring altitude (see note 9 below), it is properly recorded by the airport's noise and track-keeping (NTK) system as having flown wholly within the Lateral Swathe (LS). The LS is defined from the centre-line of the relevant route coded in the NTK system, based upon a map accredited for this purpose by the Department for Transport, by the closer to the route centre-line depicted on the map of (a) a pair of lines either side, each diverging at an angle of 10° from a point on the runway centre-line 2000 M from start-of-roll; and (b) a pair of parallel lines representing a distance of 1.5 KM either side of the route centre-line. For avoidance of doubt, the depicted route and LS may include curved sections representing turns.\n\n9. Aircraft which have attained an altitude of 4000 FT (Heathrow QNH) may be directed by air traffic controllers onto a different heading and commanders complying with any such direction will not by reason of so complying be deemed to have departed from the Noise Preferential Routeing."
