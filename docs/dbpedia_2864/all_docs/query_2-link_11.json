        "text": "Finding Your FlyDays Airfield\n\nWe have listed the airfields that provide flying experiences, all in one place for you to simply click and read the information provided to learn more. From flying lessons at Cumbernauld Airport and Liverpool John Lennon Airport, to helicopter flights at Coventry Airport and Wolverhampton Halfpenny Green Airport.\n\nThere's also Gliding at Hinton-in-the-Hedges Airfield and Eaglescott Airfield, Microlighting at Sheffield Aero Club and Beverley/Linley Airfield. Daredevil stunts await with our Aerobatic flights at Tatenhill Airfield and Stapleford Airfield, whilst a taste of some flying of yesteryear comes courtesy of our Vintage Tiger Moth flights at Sibson Aerodrome and Brighton City Airport.\n\nWe list experiences, lessons and gifts for the selected airfield, as well as flying lessons, experiences and gifts in the surrounding region for your ease of choice. We have tried to compile some interesting information, history and facts about the airfield and its location. We provide address details and even a map to help you plan your day to give you complete peace of mind.\n\nWhat Can I Fly at my Airfield?\n\nSome of the airfields - such as Eaglescott Airfield and Beverley/Linley Airfield - offer a wide range of flying experiences, such as flying lessons, helicopter flights, gliding, vintage flights and micro lighting all at the same venue. This could open up the potential for a fantastic flying experience day for the whole family in one go.\n\nJust think. A 40 minute Tiger Moth flight for the grandparents, a 30 minute introductory flying lesson for mum and dad; and for any spirited teenagers looking for more thrills, a Gliding discovery flight or 30 minutes Microlight flight could be ideal. Some time in the air to keep everyone happy.\n\nWith all our open gift vouchers, you purchase and, so long as you have not redeemed it and committed to a date booking, you can use your voucher as cash value. So for example, if you buy a Microlight Experience for someone, and they would prefer a Helicopter Flight, you can book a helicopter flight date instead.\n\nWe have a comprehensive list of airfields and airports from the North or the country to the South, from the East to the West, so you should have no problem finding the right place to complete your flying experience of a lifetime.\n\nHere are some of the aircraft available for a flying experience:\n\nFlying Lessons in a Cessna 152\n\nFlying Lessons in a Cessna 172\n\nDragon Rapide Flying Experiences\n\nHarvard Flying Experiences\n\nMesserschmitt Flying Experiences\n\nFlying Lessons in a Piper Cub\n\nFlying Lessons in a Piper PA28 Cherokee\n\nFlying Lessons in a Piper Warrior\n\nFlying Lessons in a Piper Tomahawk\n\nHelicopter Rides in a Robinson R22\n\nHelicopter Rides in a Robinson R44\n\nAerobatic Flights in a Tiger Moth\n\nUsing the FlyDays Airfield Map\n\nThere are two ways you can easily locate a FlyDays airfield near you to book your next flying experience. You can select from the list we have above.\n\nOr if you're wanting to compare two or even three airfields in your area, you can do this too, using our Airfield Map. You can adjust the radius to locate airfields within a given distance of your chosen region or locale.\n\nFlyDays Information\n\nAll the information we provide about our airfields and airports here on FlyDays is correct at time of writing (August 2020). However, if any of the information listed is incorrect, or in the event that we have missed out some important information or details about a particular venue, please do contact us using the details at the bottom of this page, and we will be happy to rectify this accordingly."
