The occurrence of oil/fuel spill at our airport is not frequent however if a spill happens it could be large in size so in order to be proactive we are looking for a feasible solution in which a sweeper is equipped with technology to expedite oil/fuel spill removal as well. In addition after the removal of spill from asphalt/concrete surface the airport usually applies a degreaser with water on the surface of spill to ensure that surface it cleaned from spilled oil/fuel. Therefore its also preferable that the sweeper also has a detergent dozing unit. With regards to the sweeping speed it preferred to be 40km/hr or faster given that time is a critical factor at the airport and any cleaning should be fast. In brief please below the sweeper specifications we are looking for: 1. Designed to vacuum hazardous liquids such as oil spill 2. Designed to be also used as a sweeper to brush dirt and debris with sweeping speed Not less than 40 km/hr (preferred to be faster) 3. Equipped with detergent dozing tank that is used to assist sweeping of pavement 4. Equipped with water tank to assist cleaning 5. Equipped with high pressure water nozzle Please advise if you have a sweeper with the above specifications or similar. Thank you. Best Regards\n\nI hope this message finds you well.

In this project, we will install PSR and SSR radars at 11 airports. Along with the radars, our customer demands the ADS-B receiver. We would like to take one sample and use it in our PSR and SSR verification tests before supplying ADS-B receivers to 11 airports. The accuracy of time and location of the target of the ADS-B receiver we need is very critical for us as it will be used in the verification activities . In addition, since our SSR system has a coverage range of 250 NM, the range of the ADS-B receiver must be close to this range. Finally, the ADS-B receiver must also have an asterix interface.
