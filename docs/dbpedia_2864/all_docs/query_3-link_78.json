        "text": "Post by viscount on\n\nTHROUGH THE AGES - IMAGES OF THE AIRPORT FROM ABOVE\n\n(February 2018 introduction): It has been clear since I entered the post themed on the development of runways, rather than passenger facilities, that the subject needed illustrating. I've been hunting out prints accumulated over the years and hope that they are of interest. The majority are near A4 size professional b&ws, however the clearest is that in colour. None are dated, however there are sufficient clues to bring the date down to within a few years for each one.\n\nI've no doubt that this post is one members will return to time and again to examine and compare the images closely.\n\n(October 2021 introduction): These mostly impressive images have become rather lost, as they were preceded in the original 2014 thread by several long posts with tables and detailed history information. It was suggested to me several months ago to move the aerial views to a post of their own. As I have now found and scanned further aerial photos, have now followed the suggestion and have duplicated this original post to start a fresh thread. The detailed major airport history post can be found on link: derbosoft.proboards.com/thread/16388/dates-directors-ceos-rwys-airlines\n\nIMAGE ONE A - circa 1947\n\nThis English Heritage held photo shows Liverpool Airport in 1947. The three wartime laid-down runways are not really evident, what is interesting is that the terminal apron is being significantly widened and the entrance/exit at both ends modified. The original 1939 apron being wide enough for aircraft to park, but not for aircraft to move past each other.\n\nIMAGE ONE B - circa 1959/1960\n\nA somewhat dark image, with industrial smoke haze and surface damage to the print. There is no Photography Studio or other details on the reverse. Certainly no earlier than 1958 as the clear runway markings show that is shortly after the 1957/58 rebuild of 26/08 (right to left) and the short cross-runway 35/17. The third original wartime runway 04/22 can be made out, but is unmarked having been closed in 1958. Also on zoom I can make out that the Starways hangar built at the 22 end (over to the right of the terminal) is in use, and was completed summer 1958. The photo is no later than early 1961 as changes visible on the next image have not been made yet been started.\n\nOf interest, note the road pattern camouflage painted on the roof of the former Rootes wartime aircraft, by 1960 Dunlop's, factory in the foreground. Throughout the '60s I can remember clear camouflage patterns in shades of green paint on the side walls too, fading as time progressed.\n\nIMAGE TWO - circa 1962\n\nA much clearer, but undated, John Mills professional print also taken from the south. Most likely taken during 1962. Why? Well the 1961/62 work to extend the river end of 08 by 500ft, along with a new taxiways both at that end, and between the apron and the 26 end have been constructed, and the apron itself re-laid in concrete strips during 1962. However the further two Starways hangars beside Speke Boulevard built in 1963 have yet to be started. The site of what was to become in 1965/66 the construction site of the new 10/28 runway is still pristine farm land with crops and woodland.\n\nThe deliberate confusion of the wide roads painted on the factory is clear, as are the railway sidings between Speke Boulevard and the main London line. Garston Docks are clear, as is the Bryant and May factory just beyond the 17 threshold\n\nIMAGES THREE to NINE - Second half of the 1960s\n\nImages 3 to 9 are all stamped Photoflex Photography, 3 and 4 likely all taken on the same flight, while 5 to 9 likely commissioned by G Percy Trentham (image 9 has a copyright claim to G Percy Trentham written on the back) on another flight several years later. As the new runway is close to completion, the link taxiway and associated developments on the north airfield near completion, photos 3 and 4 must be winter 1965/66, likely around January-March 1966, as construction was completed and runway opened in May 1966. Photos 5 to 9 a few years later as on one shot the 1968 extension to No.1 hangar is clear, while on photo 9 the vegetation has clearly re-established, covering all the construction disturbance.\n\nIMAGE THREE\n\nLooking down on what is now the 'north airfield', clearly showing the original runway pattern from the west. Runway 08 is in the foreground and the 1961/62 taxiway past No.39 hangar is very clear. The three' finger' apron extensions are under construction, with two complete and showing pristine white concrete, the third still being laid-down. All were complete by May.\n\nIMAGE FOUR\n\nThis photo clearly shows the extended airfield layout, with north and south airfields. This view is from the north-west, from overhead Garston. The 'finger apron' extensions can be picked out, while in the foreground is the Western Apron with sideways 'P' created by different surfaces around the WWII compass swinging circle. The changes are on the far side of the airfield. Runway 17 has been extended considerably to connect with the curved 'link' taxiway, which is still being laid. Beyond that is the 'south airfield' and 10/28 in the final stages of construction and landscaping.\n\nIMAGES FIVE and SIX\n\nA view along the length of 26 taken from the Speke end, Speke Hall Avenue is just below the bottom edge of the image. The disused 04/22 and the cross-wind runway 17/35 can be seen clearly as they cross 26/08. It is clear how close the 08 end is to the river.\n\nThe opposite view, this of the 08, river end, of the same runway looking towards Speke with the terminal over on the left edge of the image.\n\nIMAGES SEVEN and EIGHT\n\nThe 17 end of the north airfield cross-wind runway, looking to the south from over Bryant & Mays. Banks Lane is just off the bottom edge of the photo - the 'X' markings are on taxiways to 08 closed in 1961. The new 'link' taxiway can be seen extending from the runway, while the new runway 09 gantries can be seen extending out into the river\n\nThe opposite end, 35, looking from the south towards Garston from over Speke Hall. The Airport terminal is over to the right of the far end of the runway. The 1968 extension to the side of No.1 hangar is clear, while on the main apron the three 'fingers' are discernable, so before circa 1971, when two were combined into a single wide 'finger'.\n\nIMAGE NINE - later 1966 or 1967\n\nAs this image, in addition to the Photoflex Photography stamp is marked copyright G Percy Trentham (who constructed the new runway) it is likely later in 1966, or maybe 1967, once the grass surface alongside the new, long, 28/10 runway had grown and been cut. Certainly before February 1972 as with magnification the '28' lettering can be made out. A great view down the pristine bright new runway. Right on the lower edge of the image the plant nursery greenhouses right under 10 finals can be made out. The foundations can still be found in places in the scrub under the approach, just south of the runway lighting today - behind what was once the spotters 'mound' (now flattened). Indeed just visible, there are cottages on what became the 'mound'.\n\nIMAGE TEN - 1970\n\nThis image is dated circa 1970 and I cannot see any reason why it isn't. The image started life as an A3 printed sheet supplied in a 'Liverpool Airport 1933-1983, Resource Pack for Schools' with maps, short history, aircraft photos, timetable etc. The photo was folded down the middle and member ·Radiostation X' has done a good job of getting rid of the pulls and tears along a vertical central crease line. The photo must have been taken shortly before two of the 3 'finger' aprons were combined during 1971 into one large enough to turn a Boeing 707 sized aircraft onto and off. Compare with the following photo. Just 2 Viscounts can be made out on the main apron.\n\nIMAGE ELEVEN - first half 1970s, but after 1971\n\nThis charming image 5\" square image has no photographer or date stamp. A sharp and clear image so maybe professional, possibly just a great snap from an aircraft en route into Manchester, who cares, as I think this is a absolutely classic shot of Liverpool Airport during the two airfields phase 1966-1986. The dating to the first half of the 1970s is due to two of the 'finger' aprons being combined in 1971 to enable Boeing 707 sized aircraft to turn under their own power to park. With zoom magnification there are two Cambrian Viscounts on the apron in their orange top scheme which first appeared in 1971 and ended during 1976 on repaint into BA white tops.\n\nCompare the extent of the railway sidings with photo 3.\n\nIt has occurred to me while composing this post that I must have newer images of the south airfield development. Which after some while I've now dug-out and take the story forward to 1986.\n\nPost by viscount on\n\nThis Elsam, Mann and Cooper Photography print has nothing of the quality of the previous shots. Taken from over the river of the, likely by then, 09 end of the new runway. The change in magnetic heading being made in February 1972, but even on zoom I cannot find the heading numbers on the concrete. There is a Viscount having landed 27, taxiing just to the right (as the pilot would see it) of the centreline about to leave for the link. Rather a conflict of traffic if the Viscount had called a 'missed approach and go-around', but no doubt ATC had both crews well briefed. The Viscount gives little clue as to the date, I fancy anytime 70s, but certainly pre 1981 as there is no sign of construction of the new VCR to the north of the parallel taxiway. Looking at this photo again, it could be earlier, in the late 60s as the greenhouses of the plant nursey could be still there, beyond the 27 (or still at that time 28) end.\n\nLooking along the length of Runway 09 on 1st January 1975 from G-AZLM climbing out from a 26 departure. Apart from the grass now being well established, there has been little change to the south airfield since 1966 and indeed would not be until 1981.\n\nI have this transparency image as captioned as Liverpool Airport Terminal, from G-AVOF BAC-111, en route LPL-DUB on 29th March 1975 - a wet day at Easter. Even with a telephoto it does seem a rather low and a odd departure routing, perhaps we departed 08 with a tight left hand turn-out? I can remember the circumstances of the flight as I had been on a course in Scotland and there had been heavy snow and deep frosts in Liverpool (but not in the Southern Uplands), so the course ended a day early so others could get home to fix leaking property. Arriving in Dublin I had to telephone relatives to say that I was 3 hours late and 24 hours early (the humour of the Irish logic is noted)- the 24 hours early has been explained, the 3 hours late due to the in the weather disruption Cambrian/BA had a Viscount crew, but a BAC-111 to operate the service! Anyhow, although the light/exposure is poor it is a decent view of the landside of the terminal site in the mid '70s. There is a retail petrol station (red edged roof) just outside the gates on Speke Boulevard. The Airport car park, by todays standards is tiny, although looks fairly full. The fire station on the corner of Banks Road, with its rescue training tower stands out, while in the very foreground are the now long demolished 1930s Speke Road Tenements.\n\n24th March 1982 from G-BEWR, on a go-around 26. In the early '80s work commenced to slowly clear the site down towards the river and entered via Banks Road. There had been little aviation connected activity for some years, and a number of buildings empty for a fair few years, although some were occupied as small industrial units. The site was dominated by two WWII era hangars, No.39 (last used by Liverpool Aero Club) has been demolished, leaving just the concrete base, but the green No.34 hangar remains standing. No.50 hangar is still standing, but the side annex, until 1972 the MGAE/MSAE clubroom has been demolished. At the river end of the buildings, the pre WWII aero club hangar & club rooms are still standing. The new road to the Blackburne industrial estate between the houses and airport is clear. At the airport end of No.34 hangar the pale tanks of the airport fuel 'farm' are still in use. Beyond the airport boundary the Blackburne Industrial Estate, Window lane terraced housing, Garston Gas holders (the gas works had already gone) and Bryant and May factory and fields can be made out, with Mossley Hill Church in the mist on the far horizon.\n\nWith the MAS en route to Biggin Hill, departing 27 in GBHCJ HS.748 16th May 1982. The first development in the move to the South Airfield site was the construction of a new VCR and ATC offices, linked to a new RFFS accommodation The building work is essentially complete, but scaffolding is still in place on the west wall and the contractor's fencing still in place.\n\nBy 16th May 1982 the runways of the north airfield had been closed (with the exception of 17 for night departures only) since 1st April 1982. This view is down 35, now demoted to taxi-way only between the south airfield, via the link and the terminal building which was still in full use for a further 4 years. Quite what is on the grass areas, I'm not too sure, although there was a period when the space was used for parking new, unsold cars.\n\nSame May 1982 HS.748 flight (more on this flight: derbosoft.proboards.com/thread/35955/biggin-hill-airshow-1982-1983 ) showing the split site with north (old) airfield and the link taxiway around Speke Hall to the (new) south airfield. The new, somewhat lonely, VCR did not come into full use until November 1982.\n\nMarch 1983 with the VCR and RFFS facility now in full operation, seen from a passing Cherokee G-GCAT.\n\nTwo photos that could be better. Top is the full approach lighting for 27 seen from Bandeirante G-RLAY 13th June 1982, inbound from Duxford. Below are the approach lights for 09 sometime 1983.\n\n2nd July 1983 from Genair SD.30 G-BKIE on departure from 27 passing over the former 08 threshold, clearly marked with an 'X' to show the runway is out of use. No.50 and No.34 hangars are still standing, but the pre War Aero Club hangar and Club rooms have now gone. Typical Saturday with a HS.748 and Argosy on the west Apron and a Manx and Manx Data Post (red) SD.360s on the main apron. As mentioned earlier the cross runway continued to be used for night departures only, has no 'X', but the threshold is displaced and the runway is (since 11.11.82) now '16' due to magnetic drift and was eventually closed 10.01.84.\n\nDeparting 09 in Cessna 172 G-BFLV 24th November 1985. By this time the initial apron had been laid, with construction commenced in January 1983 and first used by an aircraft (Concorde) in September 1983. On 9th January 1984 the Post Office bag sorting building opened and all night mail flights now handled on the new apron. Construction of the new terminal commenced in January 1985 and was completed in April 1986. It can be seen that the ground floor glazing and doors are not installed in the terminal in November 1985, however the apron in addition to use at night by post office mail flights is also used by the newspaper flights and Guppy flights to collect A.300 and A.310 wing sections. A Saturday afternoon, with the weekend stopping Dan Air HS.748 mail-plane, an Air Bridge Merchantman day stopping before the Belfast Sunday am newspapers and a Guppy loading Airbus wing sections. No passenger flights (other than Concorde) used the apron until the end of April 1986. The final shot above shows the initial car parking being laid down. Those familiar with the site today know that much of the area behind the terminal and the VCR is now car parking.\n\nA fairly dreadful image, but the only one I have of the occasion. Date is 27th April 1986, the occasion is a flight by the MAS to be the final departure from the 1939 Art Deco airport terminal using British Midland's Friendship G-BMAE. Having had to depart from 27 on the south airfield, we made two passes to 'salute the final use of the building as a passenger terminal', along 08/26 at dusk before a routine trip along the North Wales coast and return as be the final airline passengers to use the terminal.\n\nDeparting 27 on 18th May 1986 in Aviation West Trislander G-OCME. The new terminal came into operation morning of 28th April 1986, so only open a matter of weeks before this shot. The Airport were restricted to laying the initial apron to be large enough to handle regular traffic only, and was therefore busiest at night with parked airliners, and the mail and newspaper flights. Saturday afternoons the quietest period, with just a day stopping Merchantman on the apron. Note the initial single entrance off the parallel taxiway. It was not long before the first of numerous extensions increased the area available.\n\nSame May 1986 flight looking down on the now vacated terminal and empty apron. General Aviation continued use of the hangars until finally all aviation related activity moved off the North Airfield in 2000. If uniformly lit would be a great photo of the site immediately after being closed.\n\nTHREAD TO BE CONTINUED. PLEASE HOLD BACK ON COMMENT OR ADDITIONAL PHOTOS, UNTIL MY PLANNED SEQUENCE IS COMPLETE. MAY TAKE A DAY OR TWO. THANK YOU.\n\nI think there is need for a map of the Banks Road airport buildings - think I know where there is one, just have to find it and hope it is not too large to scan. Need a couple of days as other priorities have been notified."
