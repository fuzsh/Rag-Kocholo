ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: This notice proposes to reinstate as SFAR 62-1 and modify expired Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 62, which suspended certain provisions of the regulations that require the installation and use of automatic altitude reporting (Mode C) transponders. On December 5, 1990, the FAA published SFAR No. 62, which suspended the Mode C transponder requirement for certain operations to and from specific outlying airports located within 30 miles of a terminal control area (Class B airspace area) primary airport (the Mode C Veil). The operations and routings specified in SFAR No. 62 included operations within a 2 nautical mile radius of the designated airports and along a direct route between those airports and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil. No airports were excluded from the Mode C transponder requirement if those airports were primarily served by aircraft required to install and operate Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS). SFAR No. 62 was issued with an expiration date of December 30, 1993, to allow sufficient time to upgrade ATC radar systems at the Class B airspace areas listed in the SFAR. Scheduled radar system upgrades have not been completed and operationally assessed in all of the Class B airspace areas. This notice proposes to reinstate the previous exclusions at those Class B airspace areas that have not attained improved radar coverage, amend the list of exempted airports affected by the movement of the Denver Class B airspace and Mode C veil associated with the closing of the Stapleton International Airport and opening of the Denver International Airport, Denver CO, and reinstate and amend the previous exclusions in the 4 Class B airspace areas that have attained improved radar coverage. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC-200), Airspace Docket No. 26242, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591.

Related Rulemaking Actions On May 21, 1970, the FAA published Amendment 91-78 to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (35 FR 7782), which provided for the establishment of Terminal Control Areas (TCA's). On June 21, 1988, the FAA published the Mode C final rule (53 FR 23356). The Mode C rule requires, in part, that aircraft operating within 30 miles of a Class B airspace area (formerly known as TCA) primary airport (the Mode C veil) to be equipped with an operable Mode C transponder. On December 17, 1991, the FAA published the airspace reclassification final rule (56 FR 65638). Specifically applicable to this NPRM is the reclassification of TCA airspace into Class B airspace, effective September 16, 1993. Nevertheless, the FAA did not modify any of the Mode C veils under the airspace reclassification final rule. Background As a result of regulatory proceedings initiated under Notice 88-2 (53 FR 4306, February 12, 1988), no person may operate an aircraft in the Mode C veil unless that aircraft is equipped with an operable Mode C transponder. However, aircraft otherwise authorized or directed by ATC; aircraft not originally certificated with an engine-driven electrical system or not subsequently certified with such a system installed; balloons; and gliders are excluded from the Mode C requirement in the veil. In response to over 65,000 comments received to Notice 88-2, the FAA stated that it would consider a means of providing access to outlying airports within the Mode C veil for those aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder; and that access would be allowed only to the extent that operations without an operable Mode C transponder would be consistent with maintaining adequate safety. SFAR No. 62 was proposed (55 FR 21722; May 25, 1990) to permit the operation of aircraft to and from designated airports within the Mode C veil without an operable Mode C transponder. When SFAR No. 62 was adopted (55 FR 50302; December 5, 1990), the FAA designated 306 airports, within 24 Mode C veils, at which the Mode C requirement would be suspended. SFAR No. 62 allowed for the operation of aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder in the airspace at or below the altitude specified for the airport and within 2-nautical miles of the center of the airport or along the most direct and expeditious routing (or on a routing directed by ATC) between that airport and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil, consistent with established traffic patterns, noise abatement procedures, and safety. Prior to the adoption of SFAR No. 62, any requests to deviate from the Mode C transponder requirements were handled by ATC facilities on a case-by-case basis. If approved, the ATC authorization specified all restrictions or conditions necessary to ensure that the operation could be conducted safely, without any impact on other operations. Although there were circumstances that were applicable to many operators (such as operations to and from a specified outlying airport or operations conducted in areas of no radar coverage), ATC authorizations had to be requested and granted on an individual basis. This aspect of the ATC authorization process proved to be inefficient and time consuming for both operators and ATC staff. The promulgation of SFAR No. 62 proved to be beneficial for the affected aircraft and ATC, in that it provided access to outlying airports with a minimum of ATC involvement without degrading the safety benefits of the Mode C rule. The 3-year duration of SFAR No. 62 was expected to allow for the completion or ATC radar system upgrades at each Class B airspace area primary airport. An operational evaluation was to be completed to determine the extent of the improved radar coverage within each Mode C veil achieved as a result of the radar system upgrades. It was anticipated that if extensions to the suspension of the Mode C transponder requirement for operations at certain airports were required, each extension would be addressed on a site-by-site basis. During the period that SFAR No. 62 was in effect, no known violations or derogations of safety were known to have occurred and no complaints were received by the FAA. Consequently, the FAA still believes, as stated in the original promulgation of SFAR No. 62, that the operation of an aircraft not equipped with a Mode C transponder within the Mode C veil can be accommodated safely, provided the operations are conducted outside ATC radar coverage, and are consistent with the restrictions delineated in the expired SFAR No. 62. The Proposal In support of the FAA's General Aviation Action Plan, which in part promotes increased access to airspace and eliminating unneeded equipment requirements for General Aviation (GA) aircraft, this notice proposes to reinstate and amend the former SFAR No. 62. This proposal will permit the operation of aircraft, without an operable Mode C transponder, in the airspace at or below the specified altitude and within a 2-nautical mile radius, or, if directed by ATC, within a 5- nautical mile radius, of an airport listed in section 2 of the SFAR; and in the airspace at or below the specified altitude along the most direct and expeditious routing, or on routing directed by ATC, between an airport listed in section 2 of this SFAR and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil overlying that airport, consistent with established traffic patterns, noise abatement procedures and safety. This proposed SFAR and the amended altitude designations for each airport would not supersede the provisions of Sec. 91.119, minimum safe altitudes. Routings to and from each airport are intentionally unspecified to permit the pilot to avoid operating near obstructions. As of the date of this notice, only 10 of the 24 Mode C veils have commissioned the new radar systems. This notice proposes to reinstate, without change, the exclusions previously afforded to airports associated with the 14 Mode C veils that have not commissioned the new radar systems. The FAA has conducted operational evaluations of the 10 sites that have commissioned the new radar systems to determine the extent of attained radar coverage improvement. Of the 10 sites evaluated, 6 experienced no increase in radar coverage at the altitudes and routing previously approved under SFAR No. 62. The FAA proposes to reinstate the exclusions formerly provided for by SFAR No. 62 at these 6 sites without change. Four sites have experienced improvement in radar coverage, and this notice proposes the following changes to the altitudes at which operations by aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder can be accommodated at those sites: Airports within a 30-nautical-mile radius of the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Former Proposed Airport name (AGL) (AGL) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Arant Airport, Wingate, NC........................ 2,500 2,000 Bradley Outernational Airport, China Grove, NC.... 2,500 1,500 Chester Municipal Airport, Chester, SC............ 2,500 1,600 China Grove Airport, China Grove, NC.............. 2,500 1,500 Goodnight's Airport, Kannapolis, NC............... 2,500 1,500 Knapp Airport, Marshville, NC..................... 2,500 2,000 Lake Norman Airport, Mooresville, NC.............. 2,500 2,000 Lancaster County Airport, Lancaster, SC........... 2,500 1,600 Little Mountain Airport, Denver, NC............... 2,500 2,000 Long Island Airport, Long Island, NC.............. 2,500 2,000 Miller Airport, Mooresville, NC................... 2,500 1,500 U S Heliport, Wingate, NC......................... 2,500 1,600 Unity Aerodrome Airport, Lancaster, SC............ 2,500 1,900 Wilhelm Airport, Kannapolis, NC................... 2,500 1,900 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Airports within a 30-nautical-mile radius of the Houston Intercontinental Airport and the William P.

However, during the effective period of the SFAR, the FAA will continue to conduct field evaluations, as the remaining Class B airspace areas receive and commission the new radar systems, to reassess the radar coverage within the associated Mode C veil. Additionally, the FAA will explore the feasibility of making permanent exclusions based on safety, operational impact, and radar coverage. The public will be invited to provide comment on any such proposals through further notice published in the Federal Register. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.). International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations In keeping with the U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO), it is the FAA policy to comply with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) to the maximum extent practicable. For this notice, the FAA has determined that this proposal, if adopted, would not present any difference. Regulatory Evaluation Summary The FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action,'' as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this proposed rule are summarized below. Overview When SFAR No. 62 was adopted (December 1990), the FAA designated 306 airports located within the 24 Class B airspace Mode C veils at which the Mode C requirement would be temporarily suspended. SFAR No. 62 allowed aircraft operations into and out of these designated airports without an operable Mode C transponder if these operations were conducted at and below the altitude specified, within 2-nautical miles from the airport's center, and along a direct route (or as directed by ATC) between that airport and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil. In this evaluation, the term ``Designated Airports'' refers to those outlying airports located within the 24 Class B airspace areas Mode C veils where local airport operations were beyond or below ATC radar coverage and, as such, were temporarily suspended from Mode C requirements by the forerunner of this SFAR. Benefits This proposed rule is expected to generate potential benefits in the form of: (1) Increased convenience to pilots operating aircraft not equipped with operable Mode C transponders, and (2) enhanced operational efficiency to FAA air traffic control. Prior to SFAR No. 62, aircraft not equipped with operable Mode C transponders could operate at an airport within a Mode C veil only after receiving ATC authorization. This requirement was valid at all airports within the Mode C veil, even those airports that were located beyond existing ATC radar coverage. Because ATC authorization can only be granted on a case-by-case basis, the process of obtaining ATC authorization can be inefficient and time consuming for pilots, as well as the FAA. The benefit of this proposed rule would be temporary relief from the burden of obtaining individual ATC authorizations for those aircraft operations at airports located beyond existing radar coverage. For FAA air traffic control, this proposed rule would provide benefits in the form of enhanced operational efficiency. Such enhanced efficiency would be the temporary relief of ATC from assigning authorizations, particularly during busy periods. This proposed rule would allow TAC to allocate temporarily its personnel and equipment resources to more productive functions. Although the benefits of this proposed rule have not been quantified, they are expected to be large for both aircraft operators and the FAA. Costs This proposed rule is not expected to impose costs on the FAA or society. In addition, this proposed rule would not impose significant costs on the aviation community (namely, fixed based operators). This proposed rule would not impose additional equipment or personnel costs to the FAA. The acquisition of new radar tracking systems is a routine cost of upgrading FAA equipment. No additional FAA personnel would be required, because the temporary suspension of the Mode C transponder requirement is expected to enhance air traffic control (ATC) operational efficiency by eliminating the need for ATC authorizations at the designated airports. This proposed rule would reduce the demand on ATC equipment and personnel resources. This proposed rule is not expected to impose societal costs, in the form of reduced aviation safety. When the FAA initially published SFAR No. 62, which temporarily suspended the Mode C requirements at the Designated Airports, it did so on the basis that there was no ATC radar coverage at those Designated Airports. The regulatory evaluation prepared for that final rule concluded that there would not be any adverse impact on aviation safety, because the full intent of the Mode C rule had not been realized. Furthermore, such safety would not be realized until ATC radar coverage was extended to those designated airports, through the installation of the new ASR-9 radar. Since the implementation of SFAR No. 62, ASR-9 radar has been commissioned at 10 of the 24 Class B airspace areas. Under this proposed rule, aviation safety would not be affected adversely for two reasons. First, operations at those designated airports located within the Mode C veils of the 14 Class B airspace areas not utilizing the ASR-9 radar would be temporarily excluded from the Mode C requirements. Second, operations at those designated airports, located within the Mode C veils of the 10 Class B airspace areas now equipped with ASR-9 radar, would be subject to the requirements of the Mode C rule when conducted within that associated airspace covered by the extended ASR-9 radar coverage. Operations conducted at those same airports, but below the areas of ASR-9 radar coverage, would be exempt from the Mode C rule. The areas not covered by the ASR-9 radar would be defined by a specified ceiling altitude and extend down to the surface. For example, prior to the installation of ASR-9 radar, radar coverage excluded the airspace above Airport A, from a ceiling of 2000 feet AGL down to the ground. As the result of the installation of ASR-9 radar, the airspace above Airport A, which is not excluded from the enhanced ATC coverage, is from a ceiling of 1000 feet AGL down to the ground. Under this proposed rule, operations below 1000 feet AGL would be temporarily excluded from the Mode C requirements, since operations below the altitude of 1000 feet AGL are beyond ATC radar coverage. Thus, the FAA contends that access to certain outlying airports by aircraft without Mode C transponders can be accommodated without diminishing Mode C safety benefits, provided the operation is conducted outside radar coverage. When aircraft operations are confined exclusively to areas of no radar coverage, many of the safety benefits of the Mode C rule cannot be realized. Further enhancement of the radar tracking system is expected to increase radar coverage, thus extending the Mode C benefits to more areas outside of the current radar coverage. For the aviation community, the FAA anticipates that this proposed rule would impose no significant costs on fixed base operators (FBO's). FBO's represent the most likely group to incur potential costs. When the FAA evaluated the potential cost impact of SFAR No. 62 on FBO's, it did so on the increased likelihood that some general aviation (GA) aircraft operators (without Mode C transponders) would relocate to airports outside of the Mode C veil from airports inside of the Mode C veil. If this relocation activity had materialized, FBO's inside of the Mode C veil would have incurred lost revenues from decreases in demand for mechanical repairs and related activities from some GA aircraft operators. After SFAR No. 62 was issued as a notice, the FAA did not receive any comments from FBO's with regard to cost impacts. Therefore, with no cost impact comments received on SFAR No. 62, this evaluation concludes that the proposed rule would not have any significant cost impact on any FBO's. Conclusion This proposed rule is not expected to impose costs on either the FAA or society. In addition, this proposed rule would not impose any significant costs on the aviation community (FBO's). The FAA estimates that this proposed rule would generate benefits in the form of increased convenience to some GA aircraft operators and increased operational efficiency to FAA air traffic control. Thus, the FAA contends that this proposed rule is cost-beneficial. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The types of small entities that could be potentially affected by the implementation of the proposed rule are air taxi operators and FBOs. In terms of air taxi operators, no cost impacts are anticipated by this proposed rule. This assessment is based on the FAA's estimation that these operators are already equipped with Mode C transponders. They are, in all likelihood, based at airports within the Mode C veil which fall within the radar coverage of ATC. In terms of FBO's, the FAA estimates that this proposed rule would not impose significant costs. This assessment is based on the belief that FBO's would not experience revenue losses from GA aircraft to airports outside of the Mode C veil or undesignated airports within the Mode C veil to designated airports specified in this proposed rule. Although the proposed rule provides access to a Mode C veil, the FAA believes that this proposed rule does not provide GA aircraft operators with much of an incentive to relocate. This assessment is further supported by the belief that the vast majority of those GA aircraft operators required to install Mode C transponders acquired them by December 30, 1990 (Phase II of the Mode C rule for Airport Radar Service Areas). Therefore, the FAA contends that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required because this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities. International Trade Impact Assessment This proposed rule would not have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States, nor would not have an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This proposed rule would neither impose costs on aircraft operators nor aircraft manufacturers (U.S. or foreign) that would result in a competitive disadvantage to either. The proposed rule may impose insignificant costs on FBO's in the United States. However, FBO's in the U.S. do not compete directly with FBO's in foreign countries. Therefore, no competitive trade disadvantage is expected to impact FBO's. Federalism Determination This proposed rule would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), it is determined that this proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. In addition the FAA certifies that this proposed regulation, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Order 2100.5, Policies and Procedures for Simplication, Analysis, and Review of Regulations. An initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Assessment, has been placed in the docket.
