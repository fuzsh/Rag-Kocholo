        "text": "I consider myself lucky 🍀 to be working for a company that invests in me and in my soft skills. Last week I had the opportunity to spend a few days in Amsterdam with my #Fugro colleagues, allowing us to be vulnerable and embracing empathy when reaching out to co-workers and clients. Apart from the valuable presentation skills, Natascha helped us discover a lot about ourselves and each other and, we found some truly inspirational people right there next to us. 😎 💡 One particular conversation stuck with me, about how we are used to jumping from one online meeting to another, with no time to assimilate and reflect on what happened in the “room”. 🦉 There is so much happening in an in-person meeting that the action items of an online meeting can rarely reflect the best follow-up. 🛤 The long journey back from a meeting often affords us some quiet time for reflection, if alone, or an opportunity to further discuss with colleagues. Missing out on this it melancholically felt like an unfair trade-off – number of meetings vs efficient outcomes. ⏱ Just because this world seems to all be going in the same direction, governed by technology 💻, doesn’t mean we cannot control the speed and stops along the journey to make sure we make it a #sustainable and enriching experience. This is what I was contemplating on my journey back to London, with 4 trains, 2 metros, across 4 countries for a total of 7 hours door-to-door 🚄 🚃 🚆 🚂. You might say that I am lucky to have the gift of time and to some extent it is true. But it is also a choice I made. I took the opportunity to work on urgent matters from the Eurostar and to spend some time reflecting on the training whilst embroidering my hat. At #Fugro we made our goal to create a safe and liveable world and we are committed to it in all our endeavours.

The final beam has been placed on the new six-story parking garage at Terminal 5, a crucial step in the broader $8.5 billion O'Hare 21 initiative aimed at transforming the airport into a state-of-the-art facility. 🏗️ Project Highlights: Increased Capacity: The new garage will more than double the parking capacity at Terminal 5, accommodating 2,600 vehicles. This includes both short- and long-term parking options, enhancing convenience for travelers. Modern Amenities: The garage will feature a parking guidance system to provide real-time availability of spaces and multiple electric vehicle charging stations, supporting sustainable travel options. Phased Construction: To minimize disruption, the construction is being completed in phases, allowing portions of the existing surface lot to remain open during the project. 🌟 Importance of the Project: Enhanced Passenger Experience: These improvements are part of a broader effort to provide a world-class travel experience, from curb to gate. The new infrastructure will facilitate smoother, more efficient operations at one of the world's busiest airports. Economic Impact: The project supports job creation and business opportunities, involving 60 contractors, including 14 minority-owned and 14 women-owned firms [Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) Hits Milestone on Construction of New Terminal 5 Parking Garage at O’Hare International Airport](https://lnkd.in/e4JWBm9H), [ORD 21](https://lnkd.in/ef7aEhQQ), [New Parking Garage Will Double Available Parking At O'Hare International Airport Terminal 5](https://lnkd.in/eN_pwdrF). 🌍 Looking Forward: As the project progresses towards its completion later this year, it marks a significant advancement in O'Hare's ability to meet the needs of modern air travel, improving both functionality and passenger satisfaction. 💬 Your thoughts: - ✈️ How do you think these improvements will enhance your travel experience at O'Hare? - 🔌 What other features would you like to see in airport facilities? #O'Hare21 #AirportModernization #AECOMHuntClayco #ChicagoAirport For more detailed information, visit the Chicago Department of Aviation's official site at [www.chicago.gov](https://lnkd.in/eVTq5WSA) and [ORD 21](https://www.ord21.com).\n\n#MSCCruises and the Finnish shipyard #MeyerTurku have entered negotiations to develop a new generation of mega cruise ships. The recent trend towards larger vessels has led the #Aponte group to collaborate with the Finnish shipyard for the first time, as Fincantieri and Chantiers de l'Atlantique have recently frozen the latest orders from Carnival, NorwegianCruiseLine, and RoyalCaribbean. If the deal is finalized, the project will involve designing a class of ships exceeding 250,000 tons, surpassing the #IconoftheSeas, currently the world's largest ship at 248,000 tons. Construction could begin in 2028. Regarding the layout, one possibility is that the design will be based on the #NEcOLEAP project, a visionary concept for a zero-emission mega ship presented by the Meyer Group at the recent #SeatradeCruiseGlobal in #Miami. This collaboration marks a promising step forward for #MSCCruises, showcasing their commitment to innovation and sustainability. The potential to create the world's largest and most environmentally friendly cruise ship opens up exciting new possibilities for the future of maritime travel. We look forward to seeing the transformative impact this groundbreaking project will have on the industry. #MSC #Cruise #MSCCruise #cruiseship #breakingnews #news #render\n\nDelighted to be spending the day at Biggin Hill airport. This place is steeped in history, and today serves as an unqualified business aviation success story, employing 1800 today and heading for 2500 by 2030. Demand for staff today is so high that Biggin Hill is building homes for them. They’re like the Cadburys of business aviation. Don’t forget: If you want to go to Taylor Swift concerts, you need airports like Biggin Hill. If you want there to be organ transplant flights and medical flights, you need airports like Biggin Hill. If you want your region to receive foreign direct investment, you need airports like Biggin Hill. The sector is well aware of its emissions and doesn’t want to pass the buck. But it’s worth noting that the innovations it produces can help to decarbonise other aviation sectors. Winglets are a great example of this. Contrail avoidance represents the next frontier. But that’s for another post. Today it’s about having fun at Biggin Hill.\n\nDublin Airport granted permission for £171M tunnel under runway Ireland's planning body has granted permission for a €200M (£171M) tunnel to be built under Dublin Airport, despite objections from Ryanair and a community group. An Bord Pleanála has granted Dublin Airport operator DAA permission to construct a 0.7 km long twin-cell enclosed tunnel underneath one of the airport’s runways. It will be linked to the surface by ramps and portals. The tunnel is intended to enable airside vehicles to traverse the airport’s “crosswind” runway more safely and efficiently. An Bord Pleanála’s appeals board approved the development on the basis that it would “not give rise to any unacceptable impacts on the amenities of the surrounding area or on traffic safety and convenience during construction and operation”. It also determined that the development “would not present an unacceptable risk to water quality”. The development was initially given the go-ahead by Fingal County Council in February last year. However, airline operator Ryanair - Europe's Favourite Airline appealed against the decision by claiming that the development could not be “justified economically”. It said that the development should be “subject to a cost/benefit assessment and consideration of alternatives, due to the significant costs associated with the development and the disruption that it would entail”. It also argued that the extent of the proposed excavation to construct the tunnel is “considerable” and that the DAA’s Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) “fails to provide detail on the storage or disposal of this material”. North Dublin-based residents’ group St Margaret’s The Ward (#SMTW) Environmental Designated Activity Company (#DAC) appealed against the development on environmental grounds. It said that the measures proposed to mitigate the impacts of the development on the environment were inadequate. After considering the submissions, An Bord Pleanála was satisfied that the main direct and indirect #impacts of the development on the #environment – such as #dust, #constructiontraffic, and #surface and #groundwater #pollution – would be mitigated by measures set out in the DAA’s EIAR. Speaking to The Irish Times following the decision, the DAA said: “The #tunnel is required to improve #access and #safety on the #airfield, allowing for the segregation of aircraft and vehicles, and the movement of vehicles to the west apron, which has been restricted since the opening of the North Runway in August, 2022. “Access to the west apron is critically important to #cargo operations, #transit operations, general #aviation, stand-by parking and contingency stands.” The tunnel will be around 0.7 km long, with an overall alignment of around 1.1 km in length from top of ramp to top of ramp. It will be approximately 24m in external width, and approximately 5.5m in internal height from road to tunnel ceiling. It will be up to 17.5m below existing ground level."
