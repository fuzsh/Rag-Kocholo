In a note accompanying the consultation paper the Commission says:\n\n“The Commission noted that before reaching any final recommendations it would supplement the high-level air quality modelling presented for consultation with more detailed dispersion modelling to provide greater assurance about the air quality implication of each proposal and the scope for mitigation. This work is now complete and is set out in detail in the report accompanying the consultation paper.”\n\nThe Commission’s revised analysis confirms its earlier view that EU pollution limits may be exceeded at a small number of monitoring stations if either Heathrow option goes ahead.\n\nLinks to a number of responses by various groups and organisations, to the air quality consultation.\n\nNew briefing on the Airports Commission – why their runway recommendation is likely to be flawed and incomplete\n\n29.4.2015\n\nBefore the 2010 General Election, both Conservatives and LibDems had come out against new runways in SE England. However, by September 2012 the Coalition government set up an “Independent Commission” to look into the runway issue. Though the impression has been given that the Commission’s work is thorough, painstaking, and has assiduously covered every issue, the reality is somewhat different. A short paper produced for AirportWatch (very readable) sets out the areas where the Commission’s analysis has not dealt with issues adequately, including key social, health and environmental costs. Some examples are that the extent of claimed economic benefits of a new runway are based on an “innovative” – ie. unproven – economic model, which leaves out the cost of noise and air pollution. There is obfuscation on climate change, where the bald fact is that any new runway would almost certainly be inconsistent with the UK’s climate target for 2050. Air quality work has not been done. The paper concludes: “… politicians and others should feel entirely free to make their own judgements about airport expansion – based if possible on genuinely independent and unbiased evidence. They should not be influenced by recommendations from the Airports Commission. ”\n\nhttps://www.airportwatch.org.uk/2015/04/new-briefing-on-the-airports-commission-why-their-runway-recommendation-is-likely-to-be-flawed-and-incomplete/\n\nSome of the many responses that have been sent in to the Airports Commission consultation\n\nFebruary 8, 2015\n\nThe Airports Commission consultation on its 3 short-listed runway options closed on 3rd February 2015. Responses have been sent in from a huge number of organisations, not to mention thousands of individuals. Heathrow and Gatwick have felt it necessary to blitz the south east (and further afield) with advertising, to get people to tell the Commission they want their runway. What the Commission actually wanted in responses – other than the airports’ mass mailings – was considered comments on the 58 or so documents put out by the Commission, and comments on how they have carried out their appraisals, including things they have left out. They also ask how the runway schemes could be improved, or their negative impacts mitigated. The Commission will publish “all substantive, technical responses it has received” at the same time as it makes it recommendation on the runway some time in summer 2015. On this page, AirportWatch has put links to as many responses as possible – those which have been made public. More will follow, as we locate them …..\n\nClick here to view full story…\n\nCommission publishes new report on “strategic fit” for its consultation – on possible impact of runways on air travel cost\n\nDecember 19, 2014\n\nThe Airports Commission has published another report to form the background information for its consultation. The consultation is on details of runway plans at two runway options at Heathrow, and one at Gatwick, and ends on 3rd February. The new document is entitled “Impacts of Expanding Airport Capacity on Competition and Connectivity – The case of Gatwick and Heathrow” and is by the International Transport Forum. It comes under the “strategic fit” category, and supports the strategic fit analysis in the consultation. By strategic fit the Commission means:”To provide additional capacity and connectivity in line with the assessment of need” and “To improve the experience of passengers and other users of aviation.” (Nothing to do with those affected by aviation impacts, but not passengers). The new document looks at possible scenarios of what might happen with either a Heathrow or Gatwick runway, and how airlines might react. While it is probable that both airports would have to put up landing charges, to pay for a runway etc, it is likely the extra runway capacity would reduce the cost of slots and therefore lead to lower fares. The extent this might happen is conjecture, as it is not possible to accurately predict airline etc behaviour in future.\n\nClick here to view full story…\n\nIntelligible summary of the Airports Commission consultation documents\n\nThe Airports Commission’s consultation documents on the three short-listed runway options are numerous and lengthy. But to give people an initial summary of what they say, HACAN has put together a short summary. They look at the economic claims of each (Heathrow 3rd Runway: £112bn – £211bn; Heathrow Hub: £101bn – £214bn; Gatwick: £42bn – £127bn). On jobs, the estimates vary wildly from 47,000 to 112,000. No one can say how many there will be, how well paid they will be, who will fill them and how long these jobs will last. The Commission estimates the cost of Gatwick would be £9.3 bn; cost of Heathrow Hub £13.5bn; cost of Heathrow north west runway £18.6bn. And there are many other costs, that the taxpayer would need to fund. The Commission puts the work the taxpayer would have to fund at £6.3bn for Heathrow Hub; £5.7bn for Heathrow; and £787,000 for Gatwick. The number of homes to be demolished would be at least 783 homes for Heathrow’s north west plan; 242 for Heathrow Hub; and 186 at Gatwick. On noise, the Commission expects the number in the 55 Lden contour by 2050 would be 26,000 at Gatwick; 820,000 for Heathrow north-west runway; and 1,035,100 for Heathrow Hub.\n\nAirports Commission Consultation Briefing Explained\n\nDates of Commission activities during 2014:\n\nPage 207 – 208 of https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/266668/airports-commission-interim-report.pdf\n\nJanuary 16th 2014 – start of consultation on “Appraisal Framework”.

There was a consultation draft of the appraisal framework, in January. The Appraisal Framework sets out how the Commission expects the runway scheme designs to be developed, and how the schemes will be appraised by the Commission. The deadline for scheme submissions is now 14th May (not 9th). The Appraisal Framework has a list of “sift criteria categories” which are: strategic fit, economy, surface access, environment, people, cost, operational viability, and delivery. Within these categories are a list of “appraisal modules” with things like “noise, air quality, biodiversity, carbon, water and flood risk, and place” under environment. The Commission hopes “The objectives conform to the principles of mitigating and adapting to climate change and achieving good design, and they should ensure that schemes balance national, local and commercial interests.” It adds that ” it is unlikely that proposals will meet each objective to an equal degree and that an element of ‘trade off’ between objectives might therefore be required.” Click here to view full story…\n\nAirports Commission launches 6 week consultation on appraisal framework for short-listed runway schemes\n\nDate added: January 17, 2014\n\nThe Chairman of the Airports Commission, Sir Howard Davies, launched the most recent consultation by the Commission, at the RunwaysUK conference on 16th January. This consultation is on its appraisal framework, and ends on 28th February. The aim is to set out how the runway schemes it short-listed (2 at Heathrow, one at Gatwick and the possibility one for the Isle of Grain will be added by late summer 2014) will be assessed in terms of social, economic and environmental criteria. A summary of responses will be published within 3 months of the consultation closing. The document is 127 pages long, requiring detailed and carefully considered responses. On environmental matters, the Commission lists their objectives, for appraisal of schemes, to include: minimising noise impacts; protecting local air quality; minimising CO2 emissions in airport construction and operation (not from flights); protecting quality of ground and surface water, using water efficiently and reducing flood risk; and minimising impacts on existing landscape character and heritage assets. Under the heading “People” their objectives are to maintain and where possible improve the quality of life for local residents; manage and reduce the effects of housing loss on local communities; and reduce or avoid disproportionate impacts on any social group. They also ask: Are there any other objectives that the Commission should consider, and if so what are they?
