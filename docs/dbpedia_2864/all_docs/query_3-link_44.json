        "text": "Your Private Jet to Southampton Airport\n\nAlthough Southampton Airport does not have the largest passenger volume, it is conveniently located for holidays in the south of England. There are regular flights to various top destinations in both the UK and across Europe, and a dedicated terminal for charter flights makes it a highly attractive for private jet passengers.\n\nSouthampton Airport: A Firm Place in the History of Air Travel\n\nFlights from Southampton have a long tradition. Even before the modern building was built, the airport’s location was used for flying. In 1910 the flying pioneer and owner of the property Edwin Rowland Moon, made the first attempted flight in a monoplane, the Moonbeam Mk. II. This flight was a watershed moment in the history of aviation, as almost all modern aircraft are built according to the same construction principles as the Moonbeam Mk. II. When the First World War began, the British war ministry requisitioned the airspace for military use. In 1918, the airport reopened for civilian use, with regular flights to London, Plymouth, Bristol, and Bournemouth. During the Second World War, the airport was again put under the command of the military and used as a training facility for the Royal Navy. In 1945, the airport returned to civilian operation, and in the early 1950s Southampton Airport was one of the busiest airports outside of London. Passenger numbers grew steadily and in the 1960s, after the runway was expanded and reinforced with concrete so that larger planes could take off and land, passenger numbers reached more than 270,000 a year.\n\nIn the decades since, the airport has been regularly expanded and modernised. The growing passenger numbers were accommodated by building extensions, new facilities for air traffic control and modernised technical equipment. In 1994, a new terminal was opened and in 2003 the airport exceeded one million passengers within twelve months.\n\nLocation of Southampton Airport\n\nDistances from Southampton Airport to:\n\nSouthampton port: approx. 7.5 km by car\n\nSouthampton city centre: approx. 8 km by car\n\nOcean Village (yacht marina): approx. 8 km by car\n\nUniversity of Southampton: a approx. 3 km by car\n\nSouthampton Solent University: approx. 6 km by car\n\nRelaxed and Tailored to Your Needs: Book a Charter Flight to Southampton\n\nSouthampton is well known as the port from which the Titanic departed.
