        "text": "A Vision for London Biggin Hill Airport\n\nThe Government envisages Biggin Hill as an airport open for the whole community, ones that meets the needs of:\n\nFlying Training\n\nPrivate & Corporate Aviation\n\nPassenger Flights to European destinations\n\nLBHAL supports the Government�s overall proposals for the airport which will provide a helpful contribution to meeting the runway capacity issues in the S.E. The proposals open up the airport for use by members of the public, once again giving them quick and convenient access to European flights and avoiding the congestion of the big London airports.\n\nThe proposals would also help to reduce existing surface journeys to other airports, and provide many social benefits including, convenience for local travellers, increased employment opportunities, securing the airport�s economic contribution to south London and recognising the environmental concerns expressed by residents in the past.\n\nLondon's Only Business Airport\n\nBiggin Hill has 1,800m / 6,000ft runway that is long enough to accommodate bizjets up to and including GV, Global Express, Airbus A319CJ and Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and no runway slots are needed.\n\nThe Airport enjoys a prime location just 12 miles from Central London and within easy reach of the motorway network.\n\nBiggin Hill Executive Aircraft Handling offer a dedicated, discreet and professional service to facilitate your aircraft turnaround, and can facilitate maintenance and hangar facilities, aircraft and helicopter charter, limousine service, hotel accommodation, executive inflight catering.... In short, Biggin Hill meets and exceeds the needs of the operators of corporate, fractional, private and charter aircraft that visit Biggin Hill every day from all over the World.\n\nGeneral Aviation at Biggin Hill\n\nThere are a number of flying clubs and schools at Biggin Hill offering flying training, and for the established pilot, there are hangar and maintenance providers, parts suppliers and the Biggin Hill Private Owners Association to keep you up to date with what's happening on the Airport and in the GA community.\n\nHistory:\n\nOver the past 40 years, this famous Airport has steadily changed from being a busy RAF base into a commercial regional airport. The historic ties are remembered annually at the international Biggin Hill Air Show. A summary of the history since it opened in 1917 as a communications base is as follows:-\n\n1920s Commenced flying.\n\n1930s Existing north-east south-west runway opened.\n\n1940s Battle of Britain air station with Spitfires and Hurricanes.\n\n1950s Front line RAF Station with squadrons of jet fighters.\n\n1960s Following closure of Croydon Airport, started as a civil airport with HM Immigration and Customs Port of Entry, with light aircraft training and some commercial passenger and cargo flights.\n\n1970s Acquired by Bromley Council from the RAF for ?480,000 in total (?3,342,000 at today�s prices) with a commitment to remain open as an airport. Light aircraft, flying training and commercial passenger and cargo flights increased.\n\n1980s Operated by the Council as a civil airport with up to 200,000 light aircraft flights per annum. Commercial, scheduled and/or charter passenger flights permitted.\n\n1988 The Council introduced Airports UK, an airport management company, in a bid to increase revenues, but under a legal clause in their agreement, the Council banned them from permitting scheduled passenger flights altogether. Charter flights were still permitted and members of the public still had the freedom to buy tickets to fly on them.\n\n1990s With financial pressure to invest more and more ratepayers� money to meet repairs and operating costs, the Council reversed its decision on scheduled flights in 1991 and actively supported new passenger services. The first regular flights on which the public could buy tickets were to Carlisle and Le Touquet, with services to Manchester, Paris and many other cities planned.\n\n1994 Unfortunately the measures to increase regular public transport flights did not resolve the financial difficulties of the Airport quickly.\n\nThe Council was then prevented by Government policy from spending more ratepayers� money on repairs, equipment and running costs, so it sold the Airport business �as a going concern� to London Biggin Hill Airport Limited (BHAL). The Airfield was leased for 125 years, on condition that all future costs and repairs would be borne by BHAL, with rent and a share of the profits going to the Council each year.\n\nThe Airport itself has contributed more than ?750,000 in rent and council share of turnover since 1994 and together with the tenants have added another ?3 million by way of rates. There were no specific limitations on scheduled or charter flights in the Business Sale Agreement or Lease, or any public consultations or statements by the Council about its plans to prevent members of the public in future from buying a ticket to fly from the Airport in the future.\n\n2000 Some six years after the Airport sale to BHAL, Bromley Council sought to ban individual fare paying passengers from using the Airport, saying that it had not been their intention to permit the operation of aircraft carrying individual fare paying passengers in 1994, but that they would consider applications on a �case by case� basis.\n\n2002 The matter is still not finally resolved and flights on which individuals can buy a ticket have not yet been approved by the Council. The Minister of Transport has requested that the Council and the Airport each consider and respond to the Government�s new consultation paper on UK runway capacity before concluding the dispute.\n\n2003 Government publishes White Paper 'The Future of Aviation' which sets out a 30 year policy framework for UK airport development.\n\nServices available at the Airport\n\n- Eight flying training schools for private and commercial pilots.\n\n- Hangarage and maintenance facilities for private aircraft owners.\n\n- Aircraft for charter by groups, companies or individuals.\n\n- Offices and facilities to rent for companies engaged in or using aviation.\n\n- An annual Air Show for all the family.\n\nCommunity Benefits\n\n- 1,100 jobs on-site spread over more than 40 airport and adjoining companies.\n\n- Employment opportunities from the largest diversified employment centre in the Borough.\n\n- New business for the region as a catalyst for inward investment and employment.\n\n- An annual contribution to the cost of Council and Community services from a share of turnover and/or\n\nprofits from the Airport.\n\n- Financial contributions to local community projects and amenities through the Airport Community Chest.\n\n- A choice of training and work experience programmes offered by companies at the Airport.\n\n- Quick and convenient access by air to European cities and beyond.\n\n- Tight environmental controls with increasing systems for monitoring.\n\nMore Information\n\nMore information is available from:-\n\ni) Other information sheets issued by the Airport;\n\nii) Visiting this website\n\niii) Visiting the Airport on an arranged visit, call 01959 578500\n\niv) Leaving your request on our comments line, call 01959 578580\n\nv) By visiting Airport open days;\n\nvi) Through your representative on the Airport Consultative Committee.\n\nLONDON BIGGIN HILL AIRPORT\n\nPassenger & Executive Terminal Biggin Hill Kent TN16 3BN\n\nSwitchboard Tel: +44 (0) 1959 578500 Main Fax: +44 (0) 1959 540406\n\nExecutive Aircraft Handling Tel: +44 (0) 1959 578550 / 567 Fax: +44 (0) 1959 576404 Operations & Met Tel: +44 (0) 1959 578525 Operations Fax: +44 (0) 1959 576404 AFTN: EGKBZPZX SITA: BQHAPXH\n\nE-mail: enquiries at bigginhillairport com\n\nWWW: http://www.bigginhillairport.com/\n\nImages and information placed above are from http://www.bigginhill.co.uk/airport.htm\n\nWe thank them for the data!\n\nGeneral Info Country United Kingdom ICAO ID EGKB Time UTC 0(+1DT) Latitude 51.330833\n\n51° 19' 51.00\" N Longitude 0.032500\n\n000° 01' 57.00\" E Elevation 598 feet\n\n182 meters Type Civil Magnetic Variation 002° W (01/05) Operating Agency CIVIL GOVERNMENT, (LANDING FEES AND DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE MAY BE REQUIRED) Operating Hours SEE REMARKS FOR OPERATING HOURS OR COMMUNICATIONS FOR POSSIBLE HOURS International Clearance Status Airport of Entry Daylight Savings Time Last Sunday in March to last Sunday in October\n\nCommunications TWR 134.8 THAMES RDR 132.7 ATIS 121.875 APP 129.4\n\nRunways ID Dimensions Surface PCN ILS 03/21 5912 x 148 feet\n\n1802 x 45 meters ASPHALT 045FCYU YES 11/29 2664 x 148 feet\n\n812 x 45 meters ASPHALT - NO\n\nNavaids Type ID Name Channel Freq Distance From Field Bearing From Navaid VOR-DME BIG BIGGIN 098X 115.1 At Field -\n\nSupplies/Equipment Fuel Jet A1, without icing nhibitor.\n\n100/130 MIL Spec, low lead, aviation gasoline (BLUE)\n\nRemarks CAUTION Both ends of Rwy 03-21 wid is twice that of associated edge lgt due to extra pavement on one side, pilots should ensure they are lined up correctly especially if tkof is at ngt or in low vis.
