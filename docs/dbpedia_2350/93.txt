Today we bring this amazing story of Giorgio’s endeavour to master the Danish language 📚. 👍 Give him a 'like', 'comment', and 'share'..... Hi, I am Giorgio, a 26-year-old Italian fresh graduate from Rome. I was an exchange student at Aarhus BSS, and once I graduated I moved to Aarhus, and have never regretted it. I hold a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a master’s degree in Performance Marketing, and am passionate about data analysis. For the last 5 months I have been looking for jobs here, have done my fair share of interviews and have never stopped applying for relevant positions. 🗒️ Danish from day 1! Since my goal is full integration into society, I started learning Danish from day 1, and I think that this has really made a difference, when it comes to getting interviews and socializing. In December I will pass the “prøve i dansk 3”, and I recently passed module 4 with almost maximum points. It took me 18 months of daily practice, 9 tv series, 7 podcasts, 5 movies, 3 e-books, 3 apps, 2 grammar books, 1 paperback, and many Danish songs to reach this level so fast. The satisfaction I feel when Danes compliment me for my Danish is priceless, and makes me so fulfilled! ✨ Tips to learn Danish fast: I like to say that it requires specific effort. The most common blunder I notice among fellow learners is skipping the pronunciation part, when it is the first part you should master to master everything else. The r, ø and “soft d” in “rød” are particularly difficult to pronounce, but still vital. Two essentials are unwavering motivation and daily practice. If you love a challenge, are curious and not afraid to make mistakes, you are set for a head start. 🏁 Helpful secrets: Romance languages and Danish are two very different things. Unless you already speak one of Swedish, Norwegian, German, or Dutch, your beginning will not be easy. But I will reveal a couple of helpful secrets to you today. The grammar is super simple: verbs have only 6 tenses and 2 moods, there is no inflection with pronouns and there are only two genders for nouns. Sentences are constructed pretty much like English sentences. The main difficulty for me is that almost all the word roots and endings are not derived from Latin. How to get started: Study a beginner grammar book by yourself, then an intermediate grammar book. In the meanwhile, use Duolingo, Babbel and Drops daily. Once you have mastered the pronunciation and the syntax, only then do I suggest you join a sprogskole to practice conversation. Fluency will come with time. Forgive yourself if you don’t get immediate results but never switch to English, which slows you down so much! Held og lykke med det danske! Yours, Giorgio 💛 #IEUAarhus #AarhusInternationals #Danish
