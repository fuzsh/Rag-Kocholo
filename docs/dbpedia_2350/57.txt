og

[conjunction]

(and)

So the most common Danish word is the conjunction “og” (which translates to “and”). With only two letters, this is a short word. In fact, linguists have observed across many languages that frequently used words tend to be shorter, a phenomenon known as the “brevity law” or “Zipf's law of abbreviation”. What may surprise you is that the most common word in Danish is not a definite article, as is the case in many languages; we explain the reason for this below, in the entry for the word “den”.

være

[verb]

(to be)

i

[preposition]

(in)

en

[article]

(a, an)

at

[particle]

(to)

den

[article]

(the)

In many of the languages that have them, the definite articles appear right at the top of the most commonly used words. This is not the case in Danish. The reason is that in Danish, the definite article is often a postpositive article (which means that it is attached to the end of the noun like a suffix). In Danish, it is only when the noun has an adjective or a genitive that the definite article is a separate word placed in front of the noun.

til

[preposition]

(to)

på

[preposition]

(on)

af

[preposition]

(of)

med

[preposition]

(with)

det

[pronoun]

(it)

The Danish word “det” is very common because not only does it serve as the definite article (for nouns with neuter grammatical gender), but in addition, it is also used as a pronoun —in which case it can be translated as “that” or “it”.

have

jeg

[pronoun]

(I)

som

[conjunction]

(as)

ikke

[adverb]

(not)

du

[pronoun]

(you)

In the modern Danish language, the informal pronoun “du” has become more common, and the formal pronoun “De” has become rarer. This is due to a shift that started in the 1970s in Danish society towards a more egalitarian and informal culture. This reflects a broader societal trend towards flattening social hierarchies and promoting a more casual and friendly atmosphere.

arbejde

The spelling difference between this Danish word and its German counterpart, “Arbeit”, illustrates a linguistic phenomenon called the High German consonant shift. This is discussed in this language comparison article on Danish versus German.

barn

[noun]

(child)

In linguistics and among language learners, a word like this is called a “false friend” because it resembles a word from another language (in this case the word “barn” in English), but it has a completely different meaning.

derfor

[adverb]

(therefore)

[preposition]

Danmark

[proper noun]

(Denmark)

sted

[noun]

(place)

første

[adjective]

(first)

klokke

[noun]

(bell)

The reason why the word “klokke” is frequently used in Danish is that in addition to meaning “bell”, it is also used when telling the time. For example, the phrase “Klokken er fem” means “It's five o'clock”.

del

[noun]

(part)

mere

[adjective]

(more)

både

[conjunction]

hver

[pronoun]

(each)

bare

[adverb]

(just)

uden

[preposition]

(without)

stå

[verb]

(to stand)

skrive

[verb]

(to write)

Danish is not a Latin-based language, but it has adopted some Latin words over time. One such example is the Danish verb “skrive,” meaning “to write.” It is derived from the Latin verb “scribo,” which shares the same meaning and is the root of several words in modern Romance languages like “escribir” in Spanish and “écrire” in French.

dog

[adverb]

(however)

The Danish word “dog” is an example of what is called a “false friend” in the context of language learning: it resembles an English word, but it has an entirely different meaning. In Danish, the word “dog” has no relation to the canine animal. It is an adverb that translates to “however”.

sammen

[adverb]

ligge

[verb]

(to lie, to be located)

hvilken

[pronoun]

(which)

krone

[noun]

(crown)

“Krone” is a common word in Danish because it refers to the Danish currency. The Danish krone has been the official currency of Denmark since 1875 and is also used in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The word “krone” literally means “crown” in Danish.

egen

[adjective]

(own)

ønske

[verb]

(to wish)

I

[pronoun]

(you - plural)

In Danish, the word “I” is a second-person plural pronoun used to address multiple people. It is translated to English as “you.” This may confuse English speakers learning Danish because “I” in English is the first-person singular pronoun. (see this guide to Danish pronouns)

The Danish word “svær” is an adjective that means “difficult” in English. It is interesting to note that this word also exists in Norwegian but with a different meaning.

ekstra

[adjective]

(extra)

The Danish word “ekstra” and the English word “extra” are cognates, meaning they share the same etymological origin. Both words can be traced back to the Latin term “extrā.” Interestingly, while the Danish alphabet includes the letter “x,” it is not often used in spelling Danish vocabulary words. Instead, many words that would traditionally be spelled with “x” in other languages are spelled with “ks” in Danish.

eksempel

[noun]

(example)

The Danish word “eksempel” translates to “example” in English, and it comes from the Latin word “exemplum.” However, the Danish language typically avoids using the letter “x,” so the word is spelled differently. Many Latin words that contain “x” are spelled with “ks” in Danish.

The Danish adjective “billig” translates to “cheap” in English. Interestingly, this word has its origin in the German language. The term “billig” in German also means “cheap”, and it is likely that the word was introduced into Danish through trade and commerce relations between the two countries.
