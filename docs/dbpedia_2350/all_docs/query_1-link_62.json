        "text": "Campus Pastors are available at all Danish National Universities and at most other higher educations. Campus Pastors are educated theologians and are employed by the The Church of Denmark and are often one of several counseling services at Educational Sites.\n\nThere are two Pastors at Frederiksberg Campus: Søren Kjær Bruun and Charlotte Cappi Grunnet. We come around at Copenhagen Business School, University of Copenhagen, The Royal Danish Academy of Music, University College of Copenhagen. We offer personal help and guidance for students. You don’t need to have a religious conviction to meet us.\n\nFeel free to share your concerns and struggles. Sharing your thoughts with someone else can clarify your situation. You can also share thoughts and considerations that you might not want to share with your friends or family.\n\nAll conversations are bound by confidentiality\n\nWe keep no records\n\nAll inquiries are free\n\nWe have no or only a very short waitingtime\n\nLife can be challenging in several ways. We offer you a confidential room where you can share feelings, thoughts and frustrations. Sharing can ease the pain in your mind and clarify what options you presently have.\n\nWhen I was a student I would have liked to share things with the Campus Pastors, but I thought they were only talking about faith and God. It is important for me to emphasize that you can come as you are and you do not need to have a religious conviction."
