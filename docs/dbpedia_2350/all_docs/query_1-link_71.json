Whether in one-on-one therapy sessions or working with groups, I find immense joy in facilitating personal and professional growth journeys. Throughout my life,\n\nI’ve been fascinated by development and growth, , undergoing various developmental processes myself. I’m committed to continuously exploring and testing methods and techniques, ensuring that I offer the most effective support to my clients.\n\nour needs are always at the forefront, and together, we’ll find the approach that best suits you.\n\nBefore becoming 100% self-employed in 2022, I worked in a number of workplaces, which gave me insight into very different work cultures, different core tasks and different frameworks for doing work. I also often draw on the many experiences I had in my working life before I became a trained psychologist."
