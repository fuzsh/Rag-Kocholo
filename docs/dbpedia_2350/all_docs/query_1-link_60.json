Sign up for the waiting list here.\n\nThere is now an available place. Register here.\n\nPractise your competent English intensively twice a week\n\nIf you already have a good grasp of English but want to get better at speaking fast, we recommend one of our intensive courses. You can quickly broaden your vocabulary and improve your spoken English significantly. On this intensive course, you will become more fluent when having discussions with friends or work colleagues.\n\nThis could be in-depth conversations about more abstract or complex issues such as:\n\nCrime and justice\n\nTravel and adventure\n\nDifferent cultures and communities\n\nEmotions and behaviour\n\nThe news\n\nYou will also learn language that will help you handle specific more advanced practical situations such as retelling a news story, reflecting on life events and choices, starting a conversation with a stranger, telling and reacting to a story or agreeing and disagreeing politely.\n\nThe primary focus is that you become better at speaking English, but you will also be given written assignments for homework. Most lessons will also involve studying some grammar to ensure that your English is as accurate as possible.\n\nThe course focuses on all the four language skills: speaking, listening, reading and writing as well as grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\nAs we will be meeting twice a week and there will also be homework, you will be practising your English nearly every day, which means you will get into a totally different rhythm than if you had only been going to English classes once per week.\n\nOn the course, you will typically meet students who need to improve their English because they have recently got a new job, or students who need to improve their English quickly so they can perform well in their current job.\n\nTeaching material\n\nNavigate Upper-Intermediate, Student's book, 2016 (Oxford University Press), ISBN 9780194566759. We will study selected pages. You can buy the book before the start of the course or after the first course day. You can either buy the book online at academicbooks.dk or at their shop. The book includes access to an online skills programme for self-study outside the classroom. In addition, the book can be projected onto the whiteboard so you and the other students will typically follow the teaching there as well as looking in your own book.\n\nOverview of the course layout and material\n\nYou will receive access to our online digital platform, Moodle. Moodle provides a comprehensive overview of the entire course. You will also be able to contact your classmates and discuss the activities taking place in your class.\n\nOn Moodle you can:\n\nsee the plan for the course, the individual teaching sessions and homework\n\nsee teaching materials including extra materials such as videos\n\ncommunicate with your teacher and your fellow students\n\nfollow up and catch up on lessons missed if you are absent during the course\n\nPreparation time: approx. 1-2 hours.\n\nThere is a maximum of 16 students in this class."
