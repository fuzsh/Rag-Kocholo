The series is the largest travel guide series in Scandinavia and covers more than 200 destinations around the world. The books are either about countries, regions, or cities. They contain information about the destinations’ history and culture, their attractions, and practical information such as lists of restaurants and hotels, and useful phrases in the local language.\n\nDanish books · 16T\n\nTravel guide books · 100T\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nBotany of the Færöes based upon Danish investigations – a three-volume classic scientific work on flora and vegetation of the Faroe Islands, including fungi, lichens, algae, bryophytes and vascular plants. It was published 1901 to 1908 and funded by the Carlsberg Foundation. The project was initiated by Eugen Warming, who edited the content.

The book is a sequel to The Skeptical Environmentalist (first published in Danish in 1998), which in English translation brought the author to world attention. Lomborg argues that many of the elaborate and expensive actions being considered to stop global warming will cost hundreds of billions of dollars without the same return on investment, often are based on emotional rather than strictly scientific assumptions, and may have very little impact on the world's temperature for centuries. Lomborg concludes that a limited carbon tax is needed in the First World as well as subsidies from the First World to the Third World to help fight ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nVoyage d'Egypte et de Nubie Book by Frederic Louis Norden\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 ·\n\nVoyage d'Egypte et de Nubie (1755) records Frederic Louis Norden's extensive documentation and drawings of his voyage though Egypt in 1737–38.
