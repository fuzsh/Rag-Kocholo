        "text": "Earlier this year Danish Architecture Center (Dansk Arkitektur Center) visited our office at Fælledvej for a chat with Christoffer Gamborg Breitenbauch, chairperson of the board. The interview gives a general introduction to Architects Without Borders Denmark (AWB), but with a special focus on our Build Back Green initiative in Ukraine. This initiative aspires to showcase the potential for biogenic materials, not only to support the green transition in Ukraine but also to inspire architects and builders in a wider European context. \"Our project is rooted in communal sharing - a cross-border collaboration between all design disciplines from different countries, embracing an opportunity to develop a shared vision for bio-based construction that is in direct conversation with Ukrainian architecture and culture. We hope to provide both a use-case for Ukrainian communities rebuilding and inspiration for sustainable design projects globally.\" Olena Ruban, architect & volunteer AWB We believe that a major crisis like the war in Ukraine requires both global responsibility and global knowledge. As Architects, planners and landscape architects, we have a unique skillset to solve problems related to the built environment, and as an international development organisation we already work in a broad range of culturally diverse settings. “The skill of the future architect is to be creative, to link the history of the place and the resources available with the skills that the local community possesses” Christoffer Gamborg Breitenbauch As part of our work, we constantly assess how we best collaborate with and partner up with local civil society organisations and stakeholders, who can help us understand the particular context that surrounds a project or initiative. The team responsible for the Build Back Green initiative, for example, consists primarily of skilled Ukrainian architects, living and working in Denmark. The Build Back Green project is supported by DREYERS FOND and Arup https://lnkd.in/edXgEX5T\n\nI had the pleasure of holding a workshop at Dissing+Weitling, \"Designing with LCA\", where I shared insights on how architects can integrate Life Cycle Assessments in their existing design workflow. After presenting insights about the current trends and regulations about #LCA in the Danish construction industry, I shared some practical tips and strategies to incorporate LCA in the design process. We also had a hands-on session where the participants applied what they learned to a real-life design scenario - and even put into action Entwine's tool for early carbon assessment! Thank you Dissing+Weitling for hosting the workshop, Catherine Merlo for organizing it, and all the participants for the engagement and commitment to sustainability. It is really encouraging to see companies that recognize the importance of sustainable practices and take concrete steps to integrate them into their workflow, and it was great to be a part of this process!"
