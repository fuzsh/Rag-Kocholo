        "text": "NGO \"Eye Protection\" was established in 2023. In order to help the vulnerable sections of the population who suffered as a result of military operations. The main mission is the development of Ukrainian optometry in accordance with modern international standards and the resolution of professional qualification issues, promotion of morbidity reduction, rehabilitation and restoration of working capacity of the population of Ukraine, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle. We pay a lot of attention to children, because helping children with vision problems is extremely important for their full development and successful inclusion in society. Vision problems can occur for a variety of reasons, such as birth defects, injuries, or illnesses. The \"Healthy Eyes of a Child\" project is an initiative aimed at preserving and improving visual health among children. This program aims to provide affordable and effective medical care, prevention of vision problems, and education and support for parents and teachers. The main components of the \"Healthy eyes of a child\" project: Ophthalmological examinations: - free ophthalmological examinations for children in boarding schools and orphanages. - Detection of various types of vision disorders. Information company: Conducting information events for parents, teachers and the community about the importance of caring for a child's vision. Cooperation with medical institutions: Establishing partnerships with ophthalmology clinics to provide additional consultations and treatment for children with identified problems. Providing financial support for treatment and purchase of glasses for those with limited financial opportunities. The \"Healthy Eyes of a Child\" project seeks to create an environment where eye health becomes an important part of a child's overall health. With the help of this initiative, the formation of customs and knowledge is promoted, which help in maintaining visual acuity and preventing possible problems. It is important to support such initiatives and join them, contributing to the creation of a favorable society for the development of children with visual characteristics.\n\nVIC – Sexual Assault - 2023 DNA – prejudicial evidence I was instructed by defence counsel in relation to a serious sexual assault with complex features. His honour found the prejudicial value of the DNA evidence would likely outweigh the probative value before a jury. The DNA evidence failed to support the prosecution version in their own ultimate admission. My considered expert opinion, was that the DNA evidence did not substantially go towards establishing the version as alleged. The prejudicial value of the DNA evidence was weighed in accordance with S137 of the Evidence Act (VIC) at Voir Dire. Both myself and the crown expert were heard on the stand, and Defence was successful in gaining the prosecution expert admission that the prosecution version was not directly supported by the evidence. The DNA evidence was struck out following my oral evidence. The complainant and accused were known to each other, were socialising immediately prior to the alleged event. The parties were not said to be in an intimate relationship. It was alleged that the accused did forcefully rape her, resulting in ejaculation. Internal and external swabs were taken within 6 hours, which did not identify any seminal fluid nor sperm cells. Caveat’s aside, I would highly expect to identify sperm cells should the accused have ejaculated within the complainant as alleged. An endocervical (high vagina) swab identified a partial low level matching DNA profile to the accused. Such a result would provide weak support for the accused’s DNA. It is mentionable that it cannot be scientifically determined how the deposition occurred, and social interaction may provide other viable versions. The complainant alleged that she “changed shorts” following the incident. Within the exhibits are 2 pairs of shorts and 1 pair of underpants purportedly belonging to the complainant. Interestingly, none of these 3 exhibits were subjected to any scientific testing. With consideration given to my interpretation and opinion of the evidence, Counsel formed the view, that the evidence should be challenged on its probative value. In anticipation of Voir Dire, extensive discussions were conducted with defence in relation to the scientific evidence of this matter and the relationship with the allegations. This process incorporates the relevant and persuasive aspects of the evidence, along with the potential and likely refutations from the prosecution expert that may become live during cross. Counsel was persuasive in this matter and was successful in having the evidence excluded at Voir Dire. #auslaw #expertwitness #forensicscience #trials\n\nLegal Trio Paternity Test I'm often asked about legal maternity and paternity tests, so I thought I would provide some information about the various tests through a series of posts. DNA testing can be used to determine if there is a biological relationship between two individuals. This is typically done by obtaining genetic material (DNA samples) from the two individuals via cheek swabs, then comparing these samples. The Trio Paternity Test compares a child’s DNA to the DNA of the biological mother and the alleged biological father. Both parents must participate in this test. If the mother does not participate in the test, it is called the “motherless paternity test”; however, it is preferable to have the child’s mother participate in a paternity test as well, since she contributed 50% of her DNA to the child. The results from this trio test can be used for legal purposes.\n\nThis was more powerful than I expected! A must watch for anyone in birth work, gynecology, women’s health and recipients of that care! This is eye opening, entertaining, educational and empowering!! Please join tomorrow for the final session!! OUR THEME: “An Ancestral Hearing For Truth & Reconciliation” For the Mothers of Gynecology - Anarcha, Betsey & Lucy WHEN: Mon, April 15th & Tues, April 16th from 6:00pm to 9:00pm EST WHERE: LIVE On Zoom Register (FREE!) https://lnkd.in/ezpc8gtQ (link in bio @speak.move.change) -THE MOTHERS OF GYNECOLOGY- Using artistic license and ancestral authority, we will merge the past, present and future to tell the stories of “The Mothers of Gynecology: Betsey, Anarcha & Lucy” and all of the countless women and girls, known and unknown, who were subjected to medical experimentation, sexual assault and obstetrical violence at the hands of J. Marion Sims and his supporters. Through art, music, spoken word, acting and movement, we will demonstrate how this traumatic history created a ripple effect that has impacted our current reproductive healthcare system and caused devastating outcomes for Black birthing people, their babies, families and communities. COME TO WATCH & LISTEN as we present a dramatized hearing (trial), using an African-centered, indigenous practice called an “Mbongi” to address the profound injustices that were perpetrated against enslaved Black women during one of the darkest times in US history. COME TO PARTICIPATE by hearing testimony, seeing evidence, sharing your thoughts and casting your vote. COME TO CO-CREATE with a group of reproductive visionaries who will guide us through a conversation about the current state of Black maternal health and how it can be reimagined in the present and the future. YOU DON’T WANT TO MISS IT!

Yet the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling is the only logical decision when the belief that #life begins at #conception is enshrined in law. #Science tells us something different though: human embryos, if successfully implanted, may grow to be human beings, but if they do, they will also become placenta. Furthermore, an embryo may never implant into a woman’s uterus. So. Is placenta also a human being with certain rights assigned to humans? Is a woman’s uterus legally liable if an embryo does not implant? Worse, is she liable herself? These are yet more tragic, inhuman consequences of ideological absolutism driving real world #policy and #practice."
