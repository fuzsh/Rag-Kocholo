        "text": "About the Danish registers\n\nIn Denmark there are three ship registers; The Danish Ship Register (DAS) (including the Shipbuilding Register), the Danish International Register of Shipping and the Boat Register.\n\nAll Danish ships to be used commercially must be registered in one of the registers. However, cargo vessels, barges, battens, dredging machines, floating cranes and the like which have a gross tonnage (GT) of less than four and do not have fully continuous decks are exempt from this requirement.\n\nIn the Shipbuilding Register, which is a special section of the Danish Ship Register (DAS), all ships under construction in the Kingdom of Denmark can be entered as long as the ships' construction is so long that the ships can be identified and GT is expected to be measured at a gross tonnage of 5 or more. However, ships built for recreational purposes can only be entered if they are estimated to have a GT of 20 or more.\n\nBelow are the size requirements for a ship to be entered in the various registers:\n\nThe Danish Ship Register (DAS): Here, all Danish commercial ships with a GT of 5 or more can be registered. In addition, pleasure crafts, including houseboats, which are used as a private residency, are included if they have a GT of 20 or more.\n\nThe Danish International Register of Shipping (DIS): Merchant ships (not fishing ships) that have a GT of 20 or more can be registered here. Ships registered in DIS are not allowed to transport passengers between Danish ports, unless it is a matter of sailing to and from offshore installations.\n\nThe Boat Register (FTJ): Commercial ships of between 5 and 20 gross tonnage may be included either here or in the DAS. Commercial ships of less than 5 gross tonnage can only be admitted here.\n\nThe Shipbuilding Register: Here, all ships under construction can be recorded at a Danish shipyard, as long as they are expected to have a GT of 5 or more.\n\nPlease note that pleasure crafts with a GT under 20 cannot be entered or re-entered into any ship register. When a ship is declared for registration, it is assigned signal letters. When a registered ship is deleted and later reported once more (resumption), the ship does not receive the same signal letters as it previously had. However, ships that are deleted and resumed on the same day may, by prior agreement with the Ship Register, keep the same signal letters.\n\nAbout Certificates of Nationality\n\n1. Once the ship is registered – issue of a certificate of nationality\n\nA Danish certificate of nationality documents that the ship is entitled to fly the Danish flag and is thus documentation of the ship's nationality as Danish.\n\nAll Certificates of Nationality are issued as electronic, verifiable documents. You can at any time scan the QR code on the nationality certificate and verify that the certificate is valid.\n\nIssued Certificates of Nationality are invalidated when a new certificate of nationality is issued to the ship, if the ship is deleted from the Danish register, when a bareboat-in registration expires or if the ship changes use to \"former fishing ship\".\n\nYou can access the certificate of nationality on the website of the Danish Maritime Authority in the self-service solution for ship owners with MitID or after registering as a user. See guidance here.\n\nThe certificate of nationality must always be available on board the ship, either in physical or electronic form.\n\nA. Digital report\n\nWhen the reporting of a ship, or the request to change an already registered ship, is registered, the reporter receives an email message stating: \"Your report has been processed by a case worker and you can now resume your report\".\n\nYou can then resume the report and must then enter the place in the ship's interior, fixed structure where the ship's signal letters are permanently marked in the ship's internal, fixed construction. You can then request the issuance of the certificate of nationality, which can be downloaded as a PDF file.\n\nYou can see an actual guide to this step in the guides for the different types of digital report.\n\nB. Reporting when digital report cannot be done\n\nYou will be asked by the Register of Shipping no later than in connection with the completion of the manual processing of your report to state in writing – preferably by email – where the ship's signal letters are permanently marked in the ship's internal, fixed construction. Only when you have provided this information can the certificate of nationality be issued.\n\nProvisional certificate of nationality\n\nThe Register of Shipping may, upon written request – preferably by e-mail – issue a provisional certificate of nationality. Issuing and requesting provisional certificates of nationality cannot be made in DSRG, the Self-Service solution.\n\nA provisional certificate of nationality may be issued to ships that have been registered for registration in Denmark when the ship is completed or under construction for a test drive or similar purposes. Furthermore, various things must be documented and proved.\n\nA provisional certificate of nationality is issued for a short, limited period, usually 7 – 30 days. Provisional certificates of nationality may be extended upon written request after evaluation of the circumstances.\n\nA provisional certificate of nationality can serve as a basis for issuing a list of operational limits, crew specification, insurance certificate, etc. issued by the Danish Maritime Authority.\n\nA provisional certificate of nationality makes it possible to sail under the Danish flag before the ship is registered. A provisional certificate of nationality is not a registration of the ship and no mortgage or other rights can be registered in the ship on that basis.\n\nReport of documentary evidence and documents for the issuance of a provisional certificate of nationality\n\nA. Digital report\n\nIf you wish to report digitally, you must complete the report of the ship, and the ship's new owner must sign the report.\n\nSo that you do not get slowed down in the flow, you must state that the seller is foreign (and thus cannot sign with MitID), regardless of whether it is correct or not.\n\nFurthermore, you must also submit the following in copy to the ship register:\n\nCopy of final document of title\n\nProof of the gross tonnage (GT) of the ship, for example by a copy of a Tonnage Certificate\n\nCopy of deletion or non-registration certificate if the ship is imported from abroad\n\nB. Reporting when a digital report cannot be done\n\nIn order to be issued a provisional certificate of nationality, you must submit the following:\n\nOriginal signed form on reporting of the ship for registration corresponding to the register you want to report the ship to – one of the following: Form II 1 Ship with a GT of 20 or more, Danish Ship Register, or Form II 2 Ship without registration obligations, Danish Ship Register , or Form II 3 Ship in the Danish International Ship Register, or Form II 4 Ship in the Boat Register\n\nCopy of final document of title\n\nCopy of tonnage certificate\n\nCopy of deletion or non-registration certificate if the ship is imported from abroad\n\nReport for registration or resumption of ships\n\nA. Digital report\n\nSee guidance for registration or resumption of ships\n\nPlease note that if you have a title document that is older than 30 days (issued more than 30 days ago) or the issuer of the deed does not have MitID, you can start the report digitally and then tick the box \"power of attorney is sent\" and then send the original deed to the Danish Ship Register. If the issuer of the deed has MitID, the report can also be done fully digitally in DSRG, the Self-Service solution.\n\nB. Reporting when a digital report cannot be done\n\nHere you get an overview of which documents and forms you should expect to submit to the Danish Ship Register when you report a ship for registration."
