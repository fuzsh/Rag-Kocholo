        "text": "From Laggard to Part of the Peloton\n\nDuring the early 1990s, it became increasingly clear to the medical community and the public health authorities in Denmark that cancer treatment there was lagging behind most other Western European countries. Epidemiological studies revealed that the morbidity of most cancer diseases was remarkably high in Denmark (Dansk Institut for Klinisk Epidemiologi 1993). While the medical community called for more attention to cancer treatment, it took the political system some time to respond coherently to this situation. Following, a series of ad hoc interventions during the 1990s, a political momentum accumulated by the end of the decade resulting in a series of systematic cancer plans culminating in 2007 with the implementation of the so-called procedural packages (‘pakkeforløb’), a set of standardized organizational procedures for improving treatment flow and reducing bottlenecks and waiting times covering the most common forms of cancer (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2019).\n\nThe first cancer plan, adopted in 2000, focused on an epidemiological mapping of the prevalence of the various forms of cancer in Denmark compared to other Nordic countries. This mapping showed that Denmark was lagging significantly behind its Nordic neighbours. The plan also included measures to enhance treatment capacity. The second cancer plan from 2005 introduced the notion of the procedural packages, which were finally adopted in 2007 (Regeringen og Danske Regioner 2007) and rolled out nationally during 2008/09 (Jørgensen 2018: 105). These packages combined with additional funding constitute with little doubt one of the most important improvements in cancer treatment in Demark for several decades. Cancer plan 3 from 2010 aimed at further improving treatment flows by focusing on the phases prior to and following diagnostics and hospital treatment. This included early tracking, rehabilitation and palliative care. Finally, the current Cancer plan 4 introduced in 2016 basically seeks to consolidate the former plans by strengthening prevention and improving diagnostics and treatment flows.\n\nThis chapter will first map the story of the step-by-step improvement in Danish cancer treatment since the late 1990s. It will then explore the content of these interventions and analyse the political processes leading to their adoption and implementation. It will focus on the role of key political actors, such as the Danish health authority, the Danish Regions and the Danish Cancer Society. The chapter will be based on three types of documents published in the period from around 1990 to 2020: policy documents issued by the Danish Health Authority and the Danish Regions; medical documents issued by various medical researchers; and public debate articles published in the medical journal Dagens Medicin and the national newspapers.\n\nI will argue that Danish cancer treatment policy is a programmatic success that met policy ambitions, though it is also a case of ‘relative success’, akin to a cyclist who at the early stages of the race has fallen behind who manages to bring themselves back into the race by catching up with the peloton (on degrees and relativity of policy success, see McConnell 2010). On the whole, it is also a process success in the sense that the policy saw the emergence of an enduring coalition of state, regions, patient organizations and health professionals around the goal of improving cancer treatment. Only, very recently, do we find a few actors in this coalition questioning whether or not the strong focus on cancer policy may be crowding out the attention to other diseases. Finally, it can be considered an enduring political success as the costly cancer plans have enjoyed widespread and sustained parliamentary and popular support.\n\nCombatting Cancer in Denmark\n\nHistorical and institutional context\n\nDenmark is usually regarded as belonging to the Nordic welfare state type (Esping-Andersen 1990). If there are cracks in this ideal, which there certainly are, then politicians are expected to fill in these cracks. Thus, even the right-wing parties, of both liberal and conservative bents, have realized that the road to political power in Denmark goes via the confession to the welfare state. This has been particularly clear since 2001, when the Liberal Party came into power after explicitly rejecting its previous state phobia and market-oriented celebration in favour of a strategy accepting the welfare state, though with the clear ambition of streamlining its efficacy.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the Danish economy has been strong with positive trade balance, low unemployment and low public deficits. Thus, at the face of it, the cancer treatment reforms have taken place in an exceptionally favourable economic context. However, at the same time, the growing influence of neo-liberal ideas in the shape of fixed monetary policy and restrictive fiscal policies from the late 1980s onwards meant that shifting Danish governments—of both the right-wing and left-wing bent—were constantly concerned, if not obsessed, with controlling and reducing public budget deficits and long-term public debt. In institutional terms this meant that the Ministry of Finance was granted exceptionally strong influence on welfare policies, principally regarding the allocation of resources, but on some occasions also regarding their design. The same period also saw a government situation conducive to public-health investments. From 1993 to 2001, Denmark had a Social Democrat–Social Liberal government alliance and from 2001 to 2014 a Liberal–Conservative government alliance. The Liberal politician, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who first served as Minister of Health and later as Prime Minister (2009–2011, 2015–2019, had a long-standing interest in securing an effective but also high-quality health service.\n\nThe Danish healthcare system is mainly statist, driven by government financing and regulation, though with a large share of privately provided (but publicly financed) primary healthcare (Wendt, Frisina and Rothgang 2009). The political-administrative structure of the Danish public health system has important implications for politics of cancer treatment. On the one hand, the overall responsibility for the public-health sector rests with the Ministry of Health and its key agency, the Danish Health Authority. On the other hand, the responsibility for managing the hospitals rests with the regions. This divided responsibility creates fertile ground for blame games: the central government points to the regions for inadequacies in the health services, whereas the regions point back to the central government for the lack of adequate funding. The 2007 structural reform, which merged the 14 counties into five larger regions and took away their tax-collecting rights, did not significantly change this game. Yet, the merger into larger regions may very well have eased the process towards closing smaller hospitals and concentrating cancer treatment in the largest hospitals. The latter concentration was seen by many medical professionals as necessary for improving the quality of cancer treatment.\n\nPolicy challenges\n\nThe high levels of cancer rates and relatively low treatment success rates became very clear during the 1990s through a series of epidemiological studies by the Danish Institute for Clinical Epidemiology (Kjøller et al. 1995). Systematic comparisons with other Nordic and European countries made it clear that Denmark had a problem that did not resonate well with its welfare state image (Sundhedsministeriet and Dansk Institut for Klinisk Epidemiologi 1998).\n\nThe policy challenge was two-fold. Firstly, the incidents or prevalence of certain forms of cancer, notably lung cancer but also breast cancer, was much higher in Denmark than in comparable countries. Secondly, the survival rates for all the major forms of cancer were substantially lower in Denmark than in comparable countries. This last fact proved particularly embarrassing for all those politicians who liked to boast of the merits of the Danish welfare state, including its free of charge public-health services. Thus, both the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party, the two traditional government parties, recognized in the late 1990s that something was wrong and action had to be taken in order both to reduce the prevalence of cancer as much as possible, notably lung cancer, and to improve survival rates by improving the treatment efficacy of the health services.\n\nKey actors\n\nApart from the political parties, notably the Liberal Party and the Social Democrats, three other public actors and several private actors were crucial to the policy process. The three key public actors were the Danish Health Authority, the Danish Regions, and the Ministry of Finance. The Danish Health Authority is placed under the Ministry of Health and provides medical advice to ministries, regions and municipalities. It develops and evaluates the quality of health services and preventive actions. It also formulates rules for the authorization of health-staff education. In brief, it is the operative arm of the Ministry of Health in all key public-health issues, except approving pharmaceutical products. It has been a key player in designing the cancer plans and providing the rules and regulations necessary for their implementation.\n\nThe Danish Regions is an association representing the five Danish healthcare regions. They have several tasks, but running the public-health services is by far the most important one. In particular, the regions are in charge of the daily operation of the 60 odd public hospitals in Denmark. They are also responsible for making collective agreement on payment and other issues with the medical doctors, whether GPs or specialists, operating around the country. Thus, the regions are the operational hub of all screening, curative and rehabilitation services catering to cancer patients. It is worth noting that in 2007, when the 14 counties were transformed into the current five regions, they lost their authority to collect taxes. Thus, they became entirely dependent on the central government, notably the Ministry of Finance, for the funding of their operations.\n\nThis leads us to the third public actor, the Ministry of Finance. Since the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Finance has become increasingly influential in the public administration. After having delegated most of its operational tasks to other ministries, it is now concerned wholly with long-term economic strategies, the efficiency of the public sector by pushing performance management and measurement systems, and the negotiations over the allocation of public money. Every spring, the Ministry of Finance engages in so-called negotiations with the Danish Regions on their budget and also on what the money are to be spent on. The Danish Regions really have very limited, if any, leverage in these negotiations and mostly have to accept the budget proposed by the Ministry of Finance, which for the last three decades has been strongly focused on budgetary discipline and control, something exacerbated by the Budget Law adopted in 2010. Still, the Ministry of Finance is obviously subservient to the political goals of the ruling government, such as the decisions during the 2000s to vastly expand the budget for cancer treatment.\n\nSeveral private actors contributed importantly to the policy process, notably, the non-profit Danish Cancer Society, the Patient’s Association and various medical professional associations. Of these, there is little doubt that the Danish Cancer Society has been the most influential one and, therefore, it deserves a brief introduction: It is likely the most powerful civil society organization in Denmark (Løppenthin 2017). It musters more than 400,000 members, almost 700 employees, and a turnover of 750 million Danish kroner (100 million Euros). Around 60 per cent of its budget is devoted to cancer research conducted either by funding other Danish oncologists or by its own research centre which is staffed by highly qualified researchers (Kræftens Bekæmpelse 2020). The Danish Cancer Society is able to present policy proposals based on cutting-edge scientific analyses of the cancer problem at both individual and population levels. These capacities have been systematically mobilized since the 1990s in a tireless campaign targeting the shifting Danish governments with a view to improve cancer treatment. Finally, it is worth noting that Arne Rolighed, a political scientist, who worked as the director of the Danish Cancer Society from 1999 to 2009, had a one-year leave from the post as director (2000 to 2001) in order to serve as the Minister of Health. Thus, in the formative period of the new cancer treatment policy, the Danish Cancer Society was headed by a person with intimate knowledge of and contacts with the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe other private actors largely supported the Danish Cancer Society’s call for the reorganization and expansion of resources allocated to the area of cancer treatment. However, as we shall see (in the section titled ‘Political success’) as more and more resources were allocated for cancer treatment, parts of the medical community, for example Lægeforeningen(the doctor’s association) and Danske Patienter, (the Patients Association), started expressing concerns over the lack of resources to general medicine and the treatment of psychiatric and chronic lifestyle diseases, something they partly linked to the strong political attention to cancer (and heart diseases) treatment.\n\nPolicy Design and Choice\n\nA sequence of comprehensive plans\n\nDanish cancer treatment was gradually but substantially changed from around 2000 to the mid-2010s via the four successive cancer treatment plans. The design of these plans was informed and their implementation monitored by a steering group led by the Danish Health Authority (also known as the National Board of Health). The steering group held around 25 to 30 members representing the Ministry of Health, the Danish Regions, the management of some of the largest hospitals, the Danish Cancer Society, the State Institute for Public Health, and several specialized medical societies dealing with cancer treatment (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2000: 7). It should be noted that the Danish Cancer Society participated as the only patient interest lobby group.\n\nThe cancer treatment plans took a comprehensive approach from the outset that included preventive action, screening programmes, referral procedures, the planning of diagnostics and treatment flows, expansion of state-of-the art treatment technologies, rehabilitation and palliative care (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2000: 13–19). This comprehensive approach constituted a real innovation in the Danish cancer-treatment regime, which until then had been neatly compartmentalized by GPs, hospitals (and their various departments), and various medical professions; the cooperation between these compartments had not been systematic at all.\n\nEvidence-informed design and adjustment\n\nApart from delineating a comprehensive design approach, the key contribution of the first cancer treatment plan adopted in March 2000 was to further specify the prevalence and survival rates of various cancer types and to identify the main areas for improving treatment practices. It also reiterated earlier proposals for centralizing diagnostics and, in particular, surgical treatment at larger hospitals in order to ensure that all patients received the best available treatment and to enable economy of scale regarding the use of expensive radiation technology (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2000: 68, 72, 84). This centralization process gradually took place over the next two decades, bolstered by the comprehensive structural reform whereby counties and municipalities were merged into larger units in 2007 (Indenrigs- og Sundhedsministeriet 2004). Though speculative, it does seem as if the reduction of regional units from 14 to five has eased political disagreements over the selection and placement of a limited number of specialized cancer diagnostic and treatment centres.\n\nCancer Plan II from 2005 focused on improving the organization of the patient treatment flow, which resulted in the later preparation of package courses for cancer. It also focused on tobacco prevention and the strengthening of cancer surgery (National Board of Health 2005). Two years later, the National Board of Health conducted a review of the current Danish treatment practices (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2007). This review pointed to the need for intensified efforts in package care, cancer surgery, clinical guidelines, monitoring, coherence in patient care and further interventions to reduce tobacco consumption. Following an intensive campaign by the Danish Cancer Society, the government decided to adopt the cancer packages, see the next section. These packages implied that the managers of hospitals and the relevant hospital departments step up their efforts to fully institutionalize the optimum treatment procedures and, not least, reduce waiting times for diagnostic assessment and treatment. That same year, 2007, parliament adopted the smoke-free environment regulation, which essentially prohibited indoor smoking in all public spaces and public transportation (Folketinget 2007).\n\nThe third cancer plan entailed a parliamentary decision to strengthen cancer treatment above all by improving measures before and after patient examination and treatment (Regeringen, Dansk Folkeparti and Kristendemokraterne 2010). The aim was to speed up diagnosis of suspected cancer and strengthening of early detection, improve follow-up with a significant boost in rehabilitation and palliative care, and increase survival for cancer patients and improve their quality of life before, during and after treatment. Whereas the previous Cancer Plan II had focused on boosting screening programmes and streamlining and shortening diagnostic and surgical treatment, the Cancer Plan III took a more patient-oriented approach in that it focused on improving the quality of life for patients early on in the treatment process and afterwards. Accordingly, patients and their relatives were invited into a special reference group in the spring of 2010 in order to provide input to Cancer Plan III, which was implemented at the end of the year (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2010).\n\nThe most recent Cancer Plan IV—also called the Patients’ Cancer Plan—essentially took up the cue from the previous plan by focusing on the patient’s quality of life and experience of the treatment process (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2016). This entailed having only one doctor following each patient, consulting the patient and her interests in the design of the treatment process, and targeted plans for young persons. Apart from this, the earlier efforts of further streamlining diagnostic and curative treatment were continued.\n\nAgenda-Setting and Decision-Making\n\nThe adoption of the first Cancer Plan in March 2000 was preceded by comprehensive and protracted critique of the poor Danish cancer treatment. This critique mounted in spring 1998 when several medical professions pointed to the low survival rates of Danish cancer patients compared to Norway and Sweden (Brincker 1998; NN1998). In order to accommodate this critique, the Social Democratic Minister of Health, Carsten Koch, established the steering group for cancer treatment under the auspices of the Danish Health Authority in June 1998, with the purpose of improving Danish cancer treatment (‘Udvalg skal kulegrave kræftbehandlingen’ 1998; Grund 1998). The Danish Cancer Society became a member of the steering group where it pointed to the need for reducing waiting times in cancer treatment.(‘Kræftens Bekæmpelse kræver bedre forhold for kræftpatienter’ 1998; Hannerup 1998). This point was shared by the steering group that provided advice to the Danish Health Authority until 2015 when it was replaced by the latter Authority’s board for cancer. Between 1998 and 2015, the steering group served as the Danish Cancer Society’s prime channel for influence on the political process (Jørgensen 2018: 102).\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the steering group, the Danish Health Authority issued a series of maximum waiting-time guidelines for diagnostic and curative treatments to be implemented by the counties responsible for the hospitals. However, a national survey conducted in the fall of 1998 showed that many counties/hospitals were very far from meeting these guidelines (Felsby 1998). The county politicians and the hospital directors argued that they simply did not have the economic resources necessary to meet the guidelines, and that reallocation within existing budgets would imply that other diseases would not be treated (Jessen 1998). Throughout 1999, the national newspapers kept writing critical stories about cancer patients who had to wait much longer for treatment than prescribed in the guidelines issued by the Danish Health Authority and who died as a consequence (H.F. Nielsen 1999). Finally, the epidemiological cancer study authorized by the cancer steering group in 1998 was conducted jointly by the Danish Cancer Society and the Danish Health Authority and its findings were fully quoted in the first cancer plan (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2000: 26–59).\n\nIn sum, the adoption of the first cancer plan was preceded by a very strong pressure on the government and the counties to improve cancer treatment throughout the country by bringing down waiting times for diagnostics and curative treatment, notably radiation technology, all of which required additional funding to the area.\n\nInterestingly, the second cancer plan adopted in 2005 was not preceded by any significant media attention, even if an evaluation of the first plan showed that there were still significant problems, such as unclear responsibility for ensuring the individual patient flows, long waiting times, and insufficient scanning capacity (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2004). Similarly, a comprehensive epidemiological cancer study showed that the prevalence of all major cancer types remained higher in Denmark than in the other Nordic countries, and that survival rates remained lower (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2005). In May 2006, the Cancer Society submitted a 19-page evaluation of Danish cancer treatment, criticizing both the continued high prevalence of lung cancer due to inadequate tobacco regulations and the poor survival rates for cancer patients due to inadequate diagnostics and curative treatment capacities (‘Behandlingen af danske kræftpatienter foregår i sneglefart’ 2006).\n\nInitially, this evaluation did not mobilize any political attention. Then, in November, a 50-year old woman suffering from throat cancer went on national television. She had waited not the ordinate four weeks, but 11 weeks to be treated, with the consequence that the cancer had spread fatally. The woman convinced her daughter to take her to the news studio the national broadcasting service, Danish Radio (Ehrbahn 2017). During prime-time news, she got to talk directly to the Minister of Health, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, about the long, real waiting times and their consequences. She died two weeks later. This story was taken up by all the national newspapers with the basic story that the Cancer Plan II had failed to streamline treatment flows and reduce waiting times for curative treatment (Drachman 2006; Lohse 2006; Krogh 2006). Only one month after this media critique, the government decided to allocate an additional 102 million DKK to the area (‘Ekstra millioner til sygehusene’ 2006; Green-Pedersen and Stubager 2010: 332).\n\nIn order to further spur political and public attention to the need for institutionalized and long-term improvement in cancer treatment, the Danish Cancer Society and the Danish Multidisciplinary Cancer Groups (a body of medical professionals in charge of formulating clinical guidelines for cancer treatment), organized a large conference at the Danish parliament in March 2007 (Jørgensen 2018: 103). The organizers presented strong medical evidence that the current waiting times were causing unnecessary deaths among cancer patients, and they argued that waiting not based on clinical reasons was simply unacceptable. In brief, cancer was to be regarded as an acute disease, demanding immediate diagnosis and treatment, not a chronic one.\n\nThis message rapidly gained broad political acceptance. The head of the Danish Regions, Bent Hansen, demanded that the government allocated sufficient resources to enable the regional hospitals to examine patients within 48 hours of the first indication of cancer (ibid: 104). In the autumn of 2007, additional government funds were allocated to boost radiation capacity (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2007: 10) and, more importantly, it was decided to adopt the so-called cancer packages, which substantially sped up and improved diagnostic procedures and curative treatment by the end of the 2000s (Pedersen 2009). Finally, smoking in all publicly accessible buildings was banned. Thus, after an insider strategy only directly targeting the Danish Health Authority with relatively modest results, the Cancer Society opted—successfully—to supplement this with an outsider strategy involving the major national media outlets.\n\nFrom 2007 onwards, the battle for better cancer treatment seems largely to have been won. Moreover, the development of better cancer treatment remained relatively high on the political agenda. At least, the two ensuing cancer plans from 2010 and 2016 worked to consolidate the preceding improvements in curative practice and to further develop preventive measures and, not least, the life quality and functional capacity of cancer patients. Also, while the Danish Cancer Society remained very active in the cancer steering group under the Danish Health Authority and regularly commented on the state of the cancer treatment in the national media (e.g. H.F. Nielsen 2009), it rarely came out with the trenchant critiques they had issued previously (for an exception, see S.B. Nielsen 2010).\n\nIt would be simplistic to characterize the relations between the actors supporting the improvement of Danish cancer treatment as a single dominant coalition. At least, efforts to push for better treatment during the formative period from the late 1990s to around 2007 were undertaken by an array of actors with often rather different and shifting interests. And yet, the cancer steering group under the auspices of the Danish Health Authority did constitute a loose policy network that contributed importantly to the formation and the consolidation of the new policy. Formed in 1998 by the Minister of Health it effectively stood behind the formulation of all the ensuing four cancer plans. Its broad membership by national and regional authorities, several medical professions and, not least, the Danish Cancer Society meant that it was able to feed high-level expertise and patient interests directly into the political process.\n\nObviously, the outcome of the group’s work depended on convincing successive national governments and regional council politicians of the need to improve policy and, not least, allocate substantial additional funding for the area. At no time could this political will be taken for granted. One of the obstacles for improving the cancer treatment was, and still is, the division of the responsibility for the health services between the Ministry of Health and the regions. There have been several instances of blame-gaming in the policy process where the central government and the regions have blamed each other for the many reports of malpractice and inadequate treatment (Mulvad 1998). Another obstacle has to do with partially conflicting interests between the medical profession and the Danish Cancer Society. While both agree that more resources should be allocated to the area, the oncologists and other health professionals have at times felt that their treatment procedures received unfair criticism from the Danish Cancer Society (‘Kræftens Bekæmpelse under skarp kritik’ 2010).\n\nImplementing the Plans\n\nThe period after 2007 was above all characterized by implementing and further consolidating the expectations and goals formed in the previous 10 years, even if this period also saw important additions to the policy scope. Allocating additional funding has been a crucial part of the implementation process. However, it is very difficult, if not outright impossible, to assess just how much extra money was allocated to cancer treatment in the said period. Such an assessment is particularly difficult because overall funding is decided by the government, whereas the specific funding allocated for cancer treatment is largely if not wholly decided by each of the regions. Still, judging from the agreements made between the Ministry of Finance and the regions and the public statements made by heads of the individual regions, there can be little doubt that the area has received substantial additional funding during the 2000s (e.g. H.F. Nielsen 2004; Straarup 2005; ‘Danmarks budget er klar: Ny finanslov for 2014 uden større dramatik’ 2013). For example, the Ministry of Finance allocated 0.5 billion Danish kroner for the implementation of the first cancer plan alone (Ellegaard 2000). Even in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the cancer area was provided with additional central government funding (Regeringen and Danske Regioner 2010).\n\nNotwithstanding this allocation of additional funding, both the Cancer Society and the Regions have regularly called for more resources. This call for more money may not be so surprising, both organizations have a clear interest in boosting public funding for cancer treatment. But perhaps they really have a valid point. At least in 2009, following a decade of novel investments, Danish expenditures on cancer treatment amounted to 2 per cent of the total health expenditures, half of the EU average of 4 per cent (Luengo-Fernandez et al. 2013: 1167). Moreover, the National Audit Office criticized the government and the regions for not providing convincing documentation of how and to what extent the 6.8 billion Danish kroner allocated between 2007 and 2010 to improve cancer treatment had resulted in significant improvement of treatment and reduced waiting times (Rigsrevisionen 2012).\n\nApart from unsurprising calls for more money, policy implementation was hampered by somewhat surprising factors that had little to do with funding and more to do with inability to change and optimize existing treatment processes. Thus, a comparative evaluation of the procedures for cancer diagnostics and treatment showed large and—in strictly medical terms—inexplicable differences between counties and hospitals (Kjellberg et al. 2007). On a speculative note, it seems that these differences had more to do with oncologists and department managers being seeped in established routines than with evidence-based practice.\n\nAt any rate, many of these differences were gradually removed as the second cancer plan urged counties and individual hospital department managers to streamline their treatment procedures in line with what came to be seen as best—or, at least, better—cancer treatment practice (Vinge et al. 2012: 59–60; Albinus 2013). Thus, by 2008/09 all five regions had established two to five diagnostic centres to speed up the diagnostic process. By 2012, they were expanded to systematically cater to citizens with unclear symptoms in order to clarify whether or not they had cancer (Kræftens Bekæmpelse 2017). Evaluations of the diagnostic processes by the Data Health Authority showed that the waiting times, both for diagnostic assessment and curative treatment, fell substantially during the mid-2010s (Sundhedsdatastyrelsen 2017).\n\nAssessing the Danish Approach\n\nProcess success\n\nThe preceding reconstruction of the design, choice and implementation processes indicates that notwithstanding the complexities of prioritization, resource allocation and aligning all key stakeholders behind the approach, the process by which the cancer treatments plans came about can be rated positively overall. The approach was informed by evidence, transparent, and inclusive of the key interests. It enabled the building of a broad cross-sectoral and intergovernmental coalition in which any residual disagreements were resolved pragmatically. Let us now examine whether these processes yielded programmatic and political success.\n\nPolitical success\n\nIn general, there has been quite strong political support for improving cancer policy. However, as already indicated, it took quite some time before government politicians went from mainly paying lip service to the need for improvement to actually allocating the substantial economic resources needed to effectively cut down waiting times and boost treatment technology and capacity. Between the late 1990s and 2007, during which the major transition of Danish cancer policy took place, Denmark first had a Social Democrat led government until autumn 2001, followed by a government led by the Liberal and the Conservative Parties. Interestingly, the right-wing government seemed to have been at least as committed to adopting the new cancer programmes, if not more so, than the Social Democrats.\n\nThis somewhat paradoxical situation where a right-wing government seemed at least as, if not more, supportive of public-health investments than a centre-left wing one may have both a personal and a wider strategic explanation. The personal factor may have to do with the appointment of Liberal Party parliamentarian Lars Løkke Rasmussen as Minister of Health in the new right-wing government in autumn 2001, a position he held until autumn 2007. Before that he served three years as mayor for Frederiksborg county, where he had gained intimate knowledge of the hospitals, the funding situation and their general popularity among the voters. The more strategic factor may have to do with the explicit shift of strategy undertaken by the Liberal Party in the late 1990s. In order to get back into government, the party dropped its unconditional celebration of liberalism and the blessing of the market in favour of a more centrist position that basically accepted the welfare state and its key provisions, not least public-health services.\n\nThe association of Danish Regions (formerly the Danish Counties) have consistently supported the new cancer policy, though with the important proviso that the central government allocated adequate funding for their implementation (‘Amtsborgmestre bakker op om kræftplan’ 2000). This was particularly clear in 2007, when the head of the Regions, Bent Hansen, was one of the most ardent supporters of conceiving of cancer as an acute disease that required diagnostic assessment within 48 hours of a citizen showing indications of potential cancer. While the regions may have been slow to take the necessary organizational measures at the hospitals to speed up treatment, at least prior to 2007, they have over and again sided with the Danish Cancer Society in the call for more central government funding to the area.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the medical profession was a strong and very articulate supporter of more funding to improve cancer treatment. As already shown, the Multidisciplinary Cancer Groups, which have members from a range of medical specialties that contribute to cancer treatment, worked in tandem with the Danish Cancer Society in spring 2007 to bring about political support for improving cancer treatment. This implied not only more funding, but also substantial changes in the diagnostic and treatment procedures prevailing at the time. While such changes have received strong support from the representatives of the medical professions and diagnostic processes have been sped up across all hospitals, the changes of curative treatment procedures in hospitals have taken place at a somewhat uneven pace. For example, the medical professional associations have been forced to negotiate in protracted disputes between doctors favouring centralization of surgical treatment in the larger specialized hospitals, and doctors defending the maintenance of treatment at minor, rural hospitals (Lund 2008). Politicians, who have to accommodate rural constituencies, have been slow to react to the inexplicable differences in cancer treatment practices between the large and minor hospitals, though highly publicized differences have forced them to centralize, for instance, breast cancer treatment (Pedersen 2010; Albinus 2010, 2012).\n\nFinally, general patient interest group, Danske Patienter, has expressed support for better cancer treatment (‘Dårligt overblik er sygehusenes største problem’ 2010; ‘Løkke skitserer Kræftplan III’ 2010). However, it is noteworthy just how infrequent Danske Patienter has made public statements on cancer treatment. There may be several reasons for this. The most obvious one is that Danske Patienter has delegated the advocacy and public support mobilization for cancer treatment to the Danish Cancer Society. Considering the professionalism and efficacy of the Danish Cancer Society, such a division of labour seems like a very plausible reason. However, another, supplementary, reason could be that Danske Patienter over the years has come to see that to some extent, the vast public investments in cancer treatment have come at the expense of other diseases (Schmidt 2010). Another patient group, the Alzheimer Association, has argued that mental diseases are de facto being neglected compared to cancer treatment and that the solution is to establish an expert advisory body to advise the government on how to get the most health outcomes per spent kroner (‘Patienter: Vi vil ikke vælge’ 2011); a solution that was vehemently rejected at the time by Danske Patienter with the argument that it should not be necessary to prioritize between treatment of diseases in Denmark.\n\nThis could be taken as an indication that Danske Patienter was trying to keep a unified front between all the Danish patient associations, including the Cancer Society. However, only one month later, Danske Patienter was openly disagreeing with the Danish Cancer Society in its assessment of the health agreement made between the government and the regions. Whereas the Cancer Society praised the additional funds for cancer treatment, Danske Patienter criticized the agreement for ignoring the need for improving treatment of most other diseases (‘Læger og patientforening kritiserer sundhedsaftale’ 2011). This understanding that inadequate resources to, for example, lung diseases and mental health problems may indirectly be attributed to the heavy investment in cancer treatment has since then been repeated by Danske Patienter (Carlson and Dahl-Hansen 2012; Christiansen 2018).\n\nSimilar voices over the favouritism of cancer (and heart disease) treatment at the expense of other diseases were later expressed by the Ethical Council, an advisory body on public-health issues under the Danish parliament. In 2018, the Ethical Council organized a conference in parliament in order to highlight what it saw as the unreasonable neglect of several diseases, such as certain lung diseases and mental illnesses (Det Etiske Råd 2018b, 2018a). It explicitly pointed to cancer and heart diseases as areas that had received vast political attention and economic resources at the expense of other diseases. The chairman of Danske Patienter, who participated in the conference, seemed to agree with this point, an indication that Danske Patienter has dropped the earlier strategy of simply calling for more resources for all diseases in favour of a more balanced strategy recognizing that some diseases are more in need than others.\n\nIn sum, there has in general been strong political and public support for improving cancer treatment. Today, it is almost unimaginable for politicians to start reducing the resources invested in the effective but also very expensive cancer treatment programmes. While public support, at least as expressed by the patients’ associations, remains strong, we have seen an intensification of voices that question what in their view is an unfair focus on cancer treatment at the expense of other diseases.\n\nProgrammatic success\n\nIn terms of programmatic assessment, it is still too early to assess the full impact of the four cancer plans. Yet it is evident that Danish cancer treatment has markedly improved. From 2005 to 2014, survival rates for Danish cancer patients improved significantly. Table 6.1 shows that survival rates have improved substantially for these common cancer forms. While it is very difficult to assess the extent to which these improvements are due to the new cancer treatment plans and policies, it seems reasonable to assume that they have contributed importantly to this positive change. At least, the improvements in cancer survival rates in Denmark in the period from 1990 to 2015 are significantly higher than in the other Nordic countries (Lundberg 2020). For example, the five-year survival rate for breast cancer improved 16 percentage point in Denmark, compared to 11, 13 and 8 in Finland, Norway and Sweden respectively. The most recent figures, from 2016, suggest that contemporary breast cancer survival rate is very close to the Nordic average (Lundberg 2020: 1268). Similarly, the five-year survival rate for prostate cancer improved by 51 percentage points, compared to 41, 36 and 31 in Finland, Norway and Sweden (ibid: 1271).\n\nTable 6.1\n\nCancer form/Years . 1995–1999 . 2010–14 .\n\nColon\n\n49.1\n\n65.7\n\nRectum\n\n48.1\n\n69.1\n\nPancreas\n\n3.2\n\n9.6\n\nLung\n\n8.2\n\n18.9\n\nOvary\n\n32.0\n\n42.1\n\nCancer form/Years . 1995–1999 . 2010–14 .\n\nColon\n\n49.1\n\n65.7\n\nRectum\n\n48.1\n\n69.1\n\nPancreas\n\n3.2\n\n9.6\n\nLung\n\n8.2\n\n18.9\n\nOvary\n\n32.0\n\n42.1\n\nSource: authors’ production based on: Arnold et al. (2019: 1498).\n\nNotwithstanding these impressive improvements, programmatic success is relative: it is about Denmark catching up with, rather than leading, the international pack. And even after these impressive improvements, Danish survival rates are still not on a par with those of the countries that Denmark likes to compare itself to. Table 6.2 shows that Danish survival rates for most cancer forms remain inferior to the compared countries, except Norway and the UK. A similar state applies to prostate cancer, the most frequent form of cancer among males, where Denmark has the lowest survival rate (87% five years after diagnosis) compared to the other Nordic countries (Association of Nordic Cancer Registeries 2019). Thus, there is still room for improvement in screening and treatment practices.\n\nTable 6.2\n\n. Denmark . Australia . Canada . Norway .

(2019: 1498).\n\nThere is also room for improving preventive actions aimed at reducing the development of cancer in the first place. This is particularly clear regarding lung cancer, which is strongly influenced by the level of tobacco consumption, though workplace conditions also play an important role. As indicated by Table 6.3, the prevalence of lung cancer in Demark is twice that of the other Nordic countries. Also, tobacco consumption in Denmark remains higher than in the other Nordic countries.\n\nTable 6.3\n\n. Denmark . Finland . Norway .

(2017): 137).\n\nThe higher prevalence of lung cancer among women is clearly linked to changing tobacco-consumption patterns. While the number of daily smokers in Denmark has dropped substantially over the last decades for both sexes, the reduction in male smoking has dropped from a far higher level than female smoking (Sundhedsstyrelsen 2018). Clearly the efforts to reduce smoking in Denmark, such as the ban of indoor smoking in public spaces in 2007, have not sufficiently reduced tobacco consumption. Thus, despite the policy success, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of preventive regulations, screening procedures, curative practices and rehabilitation services before Denmark is truly at the front of cancer treatment.\n\nAnalysis and Conclusions\n\nThis chapter has argued that Danish cancer policy from around 2000 onwards has largely been a success along each of the four dimensions of the PPPE model (programmatic, process, political, and endurance) used in this volume. The four consecutive cancer plans constitute a sustained effort. Over the course of 20 years, they have been able to improve diagnostic and curative procedures and capacities with the effect that survival rates for cancer patients have increased substantially and at higher rates than in the other Nordic countries in the same period. Alhough, in McConnell’s (2010) terms, programmatic success is ‘resilient’, it is certainly not ‘complete’, as has been shown. There is scope for considerable improvement with regard to preventive actions and regulations (in the area of smoking, alcohol consumption and dieting) and in the area of diagnostic and curative procedures and capacities. Overall, it is also a process success in the sense that the policy saw the emergence of an enduring coalition of state, regions, patient organizations and health professionals around the goal of improving cancer treatment. Recently, however, a few actors in this coalition have questioned whether or not the strong focus on cancer policy may be crowding out the attention to other diseases. Finally, it is a political success as the costly cancer plans have enjoyed widespread and enduring parliamentary and popular support.\n\nThe rather sudden political attention to and rather spectacular investment in the improvement of cancer treatment does not appear to be typical Danish, or even Nordic. Most public-welfare reforms are usually incremental and the result of political compromises by the various Danish coalitions or even minority governments. At least, most other historical public-health reforms in the Nordic countries have been more gradual, with the intent of reducing illness and increasing life expectancy and quality of life (Vallgårda 2003).\n\nEven if the sudden shift in cancer policy may not be typical, it may still have to do with something emblematic to the Nordic countries, namely their image as welfare states. Danish policymakers, like Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish, are not only paying lip service to the blessing of the welfare state, they also have to adapt their policies in ways that at least appear to be in support of it. If not, they are likely to be punished by the electorate, among which the support for the welfare state and its tax-financed public services has remained high (Giger 2010) in the face of several social policy retrenchment reforms since the 1980s (Green-Pedersen 2002). As already explained, the Danish Liberal Party’s strategic decision around the late 1990s to drop its overt ideological fight for a minimal state and the celebration of the free market, was a deliberate attempt to accommodate the large group of median voters supporting the welfare state. More specifically, the epidemiological studies showing that the Denmark was in fact not a welfare state when it came to cancer treatment, a point hammered out over and again by the Cancer Association, was no doubt conducive to convincing most political parties, including the Liberal Party and the Social Democrats, that significant actions had to be taken to improve cancer policy. A similar pattern of political mobilization was seen in the late 2000s, when consecutive PISA surveys indicated that the pupils of the Danish public schools were performing at low levels compared to the other Nordic countries, not least Finland (Nusche 2016).\n\nYet, the mobilization of private interest groups for a relatively narrow policy issue such as this, is certainly not unique to Denmark. At least, we find similar cancer patient group pressures on government to augment public spending from Britain, even in cases where the medicine is not very effective (Steinbrook 2008). In Sweden, a study has showed how pharmaceutical companies provide funds to patient organizations fighting for higher public-health expenditures in the treatment of cancer and other diseases (Mulinari et al. 2020).\n\nThere is no doubt a lesson here with regard to the remarkable efficacy with which a private interest group, the Danish Cancer Society, utilized a conducive political situation to the benefit of a large group of patients, though possibly at the expense of other medical patients. However, how this can be ‘applied’ is not so clear. It was/is a rather unique political situation that allowed the Danish Cancer Society to undertake its effective lobbying. But given these conditions, it could be a lesson for other interest groups on how to gain influence.\n\nFrom the point of view of the public authorities, the lesson of the cancer treatment reform is not so clear either: True, a government can profile itself on effectively improving health services with very visual policy outcome improvements. Picking such public winner cases and effectively implementing policies is a winner cause in all political systems, not just the Nordic welfare states. Yet, if the task of government is not only to gain popularity and stay in office, but to serve the whole of the population rather than a few highly articulate groups, then the lesson may be that the government should not be so easily seduced by single-issue policy reforms. It needs to pay attention to how resources can be allocated to maximize health outcomes for as many as possible. Such a macro-perspective focusing on the overall welfare (or health) benefits generated per spent tax kroner may not be a party-political winner strategy, but it is absolutely crucial for the long-term sustainability of the public-health sectors in all OECD countries, where overall expenditure remain very high.\n\nLinks to online sources\n\nChristiansen, T. and K.
