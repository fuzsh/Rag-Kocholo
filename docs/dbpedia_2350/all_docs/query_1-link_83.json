They apply to cases, to people, to all things. Included are:\n\nOver 150 scales, graphs and charts embracing the subjects of the Tone Scale, ARC, MEST, Perceptics, Logic, Thought, Emotion and Effort, Cause and Effect, Responsibility, Awareness, Knowingness, Be, Do and Have, Creation and Destruction, Havingness, Body and many more\n\nAll Codes and Creeds including the Auditor’s Code, the Code of a Scientologist, the Code of Honor, Credo of a True Group Member, the Credo of a Good and Skilled Manager and the Creed of the Church of Scientology\n\nThe Qs (Prelogics) and Logics\n\nThe Factors\n\nAll the Axioms of Dianetics and Scientology\n\nThe Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation and the Chart of Attitudes\n\nThe Dynamics\n\nThe Dichotomies\n\nThe 57 Human Perceptics\n\nPlus much more found nowhere else—it’s all here\n\nScientology 0-8 contains the very fundamentals on which every part of existence turns, on which the route to Total Freedom is built and on which you can attain the full measure of that freedom."
