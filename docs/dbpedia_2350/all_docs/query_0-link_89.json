        "text": "I’m a Professor of Communication and Digital Transformations at Copenhagen Business School, as well as Program Director for BSc in Business Administration & Digital Management and co-director of the Digital Transformations Platform.\n\nMy research focuses on questions about digital technology and society. Within this broad domain, I explore how data-driven, algorithmic operations shape knowledge production, communication and governance, how attempts to govern digital technologies and data are organized by public and private actors, and how transparency ideals and practices unfold in organizational and other social settings. Overall, my work seeks to forge stronger ties between emergent questions about technology, data and society, and more established concerns in fields such as communication, organization and management.\n\nMy publications address how digital technologies and data have emerged as key concerns in organizations (see this article in Organization Studies) and in politics (see this article in Business & Society and my book The Power of Networks). I also focus on how processes of datafication shape knowledge production (see this article in Big Data & Society) and how novel theorizations of transparency and visibility can help us make sense of digital transformations (see this article in Organization Theory and my book The Digital Prism, published by Cambridge University Press)."
