        "text": "After graduating university in 2002, at the age of 21, I was struck by a major crisis that endured a lot of mental and physical pain. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, agoraphobia, anorexia, and had severe panic attacks – it resulted in three months at the hospital and no medication was helping. In fact, my condition was getting worse, my weight was only 38 kg. I was offered disability pension but declined – I had other plans.\n\nWhile at the hospital, I was reading a lot, and among my favorite books was one on positive psychology. My desire to live life to the fullest, start a family and travel was so strong, that I was determined to get healthy despite bleak prognoses.\n\nI spent the following five years studying my conditions. Thanks to support of my family and friends, 2006 became the year, when I could get back to my regular activities and enjoy life as anyone else. I recovered completely, and a year after became a mother to a wonderful boy.\n\nMy success story is no exception. You can too become healthy by using the same methods and routines that got me out of anxiety and eating disorder. This experience has taught me that anyone can achieve great progress – and I am here to help you with my expertise.\n\nSince 2006 I have shared my life experience and effective methods with many people.\n\nWorking as a teacher at public and private schools, I was mentoring students at risk and coaching parents on how to establish good relationships with their teens. At the same time, I started a blog with advice on how to battle anxiety – later it has transformed into my anxiety support group on Facebook. During the pandemic in 2020 I decided to leave my position as a teacher at SESG (Svendborg Business School) to become a fulltime coach to be able to help as many people as possible.\n\nAs a coach I help teens and adults from Denmark and UK to improve their relationships with themselves and battle anxiety through guided self-care. This approach benefits many areas of my clients’ life – not only it makes them mentally healthy, it also has a great positive effect on their physical health.\n\nFor 17 years I have been helping people overcome their biggest fears and achieve inner peace and harmony. I use a science-based approach where simple coaching techniques and exercises help my clients change their mindset and acquire new healthy thinking habits.\n\nAs your coach, I will be consistent support in your personal growth. During our sessions we will cover many topics – it will heal you on subconscious level. My coaching style is a comforting, warm and inviting conversation about what is important to you. Together we will find the cause of your challenges and build new habits that will ensure your mental and physical well-being."
