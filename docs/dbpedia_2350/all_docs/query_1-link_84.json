The book was the result of a competition among the new generation of danish photo journalists.\n\nI have produced a number of books in english. They are published by the publishing house Ajour which is part of the danish school of journalism. The covers look like this.\n\nThe book “Musical Portraits” was reviewed in DownBeat in september 2011 with the words “This beautifully designed book”."
