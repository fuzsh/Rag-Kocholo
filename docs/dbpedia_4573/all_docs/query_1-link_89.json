        "meta_description": "Abstract. Relationships between nitrate concentrations and discharge rates (CâQ) at the catchment outlet can provide insights into sources, mobilization\nand biogeochemical transformations of nitrate within the catchment. Nitrate CâQÂ relationships often exhibit considerable scatter that might be related to variable hydrologic conditions during runoff events at sampling time, corresponding to variable sources and flow paths despite similar discharge (Q) rates. Although previous studies investigated the origins of this scatter in individual or in a few catchments, the role of different runoff event types across a large set of catchments is not yet fully understood. This study combines a hydrological runoff event classification framework with low-frequency nitrate samples in 184Â catchments to explore the role of\ndifferent runoff events in shaping long-term CâQÂ relationships and their variability across contrasting catchments. In most of the catchments, snow-impacted events produce positive deviations of concentrations, indicating an increased nitrate mobilization compared to the long-term pattern. In contrast, negative deviations occur mostly for rainfall-induced events with dry antecedent conditions, indicating the occurrence of lower nitrate concentrations (C) in river flows than their long-term pattern values during this type of event. Pronounced differences in event runoff coefficients among different event types indicate their contrasting levels of hydrologic connectivity that in turn might play a key role in controlling nitrate transport due to the activation of faster flow paths between sources and streams. Using long-term, low-frequency nitrate data, we demonstrate that runoff event types shape observed scatter in long-term CâQÂ relationships according to their level of hydrologic connectivity. In addition, we hypothesize that the level of biogeochemical attenuation of catchments can partially explain the spatial variability of the scatter during different event types.",

Lutz, Paolo Benettin, Hong Wei, and Kay KnÃ¶ller\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-109,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-109, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost studies assume no difference between transit times of water and nitrate, because nitrate is transported by water. With an 8-year high-frequency dataset of isotopic signatures of both, water and nitrate, and a transit time model, we show the temporal varying difference of nitrate and water transit times. This finding is highly relevant for applied future research related to nutrient dynamics in landscapes under anthropogenic forcing and for managing impacts of nitrate on aquatic ecosystems.\n\nConstructing a geography of heavy-tailed flood distributions: insights from common streamflow dynamics\n\nHsing-Jui Wang, Ralf Merz, and Stefano Basso\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-159,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-159, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme floods are more common than expected. Knowing where these floods are likely to occur is key for risk management. Traditional methods struggle with limited data, causing uncertainty. We use common streamflow dynamics to indicate extreme flood propensity. Analyzing data from Atlantic Europe, Northern Europe, and the U.S., we validate this novel approach and unravel intrinsic linkages between regional geographic patterns and extreme flood drivers.\n\nTechnical note: Two-component electrical-conductivity-based hydrograph separation employing an exponential mixing model (EXPECT) provides reliable high-temporal-resolution young water fraction estimates in three small Swiss catchments\n\nAlessio Gentile, Jana von Freyberg, Davide Gisolo, Davide Canone, and Stefano Ferraris\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1915–1934, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1915-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1915-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCan we leverage high-resolution and low-cost EC measurements and biweekly δ18O data to estimate the young water fraction at higher temporal resolution? Here, we present the EXPECT method that combines two widespread techniques: EC-based hydrograph separation and sine-wave models of the seasonal isotope cycles. The method is not without its limitations, but its application in three small Swiss catchments is promising for future applications in catchments with different characteristics.\n\nRegional multi-objective calibration for distributed hydrological modelling: a decision tree based approach\n\nMatteo Pesce, Alberto Viglione, Jost von Hardenberg, Larisa Tarasova, Stefano Basso, Ralf Merz, Juraj Parajka, and Rui Tong\n\nProc. IAHS, 385, 65–69, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-385-65-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-385-65-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe manuscript describes an application of PArameter Set Shuffling (PASS) approach in the Alpine region. A machine learning decision-tree algorithm is applied for the regional calibration of a conceptual semi-distributed hydrological model. Regional model efficiencies don't decrease significantly when moving in space from catchments used for the regional calibration (training) to catchments used for the procedure validation (test) and, in time, from the calibration to the verification period.\n\nChanges in flowing drainage network and stream chemistry during rainfall events for two pre-Alpine catchments\n\nIzabela Bujak-Ozga, Jana von Freyberg, Margaret Zimmer, Andrea Rinaldo, Paolo Benettin, and Ilja van Meerveld\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-67,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-67, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStream networks expand and contract affecting the amount and quality of water in perennial streams. This study presents measurements of changes in water chemistry and the flowing portion of the drainage network during rainfall events in two neighboring catchments. Despite the proximity, similar size, soil and bedrock, water chemistry and stream network dynamics differed substantially for the two catchments. These differences are attributed to the differences in slope and channel network.\n\nInferring heavy tails of flood distributions through hydrograph recession analysis\n\nHsing-Jui Wang, Ralf Merz, Soohyun Yang, and Stefano Basso\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4369–4384, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4369-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4369-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurately assessing heavy-tailed flood behavior with limited data records is challenging and can lead to inaccurate hazard estimates. Our research introduces a new index that uses hydrograph recession to identify heavy-tailed flood behavior, compare severity, and produce reliable results with short data records. This index overcomes the limitations of current metrics, which lack physical meaning and require long records. It thus provides valuable insight into the flood hazard of river basins.\n\nSeasonal variation and release of soluble reactive phosphorus in an agricultural upland headwater in central Germany\n\nMichael Rode, JÃ¶rg Tittel, Frido Reinstorf, Michael Schubert, Kay KnÃ¶ller, Benjamin Gilfedder, Florian Merensky-PÃ¶hlein, and Andreas Musolff\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1261–1277, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1261-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1261-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAgricultural catchments show elevated phosphorus (P) concentrations during summer low flow. In an agricultural stream, we found that phosphorus in groundwater was a major source of stream water phosphorus during low flow, and stream sediments derived from farmland are unlikely to have increased stream phosphorus concentrations during low water. We found no evidence that riparian wetlands contributed to soluble reactive (SR) P loads. Agricultural phosphorus was largely buffered in the soil zone.\n\nDroughts can reduce the nitrogen retention capacity of catchments\n\nCarolin Winter, Tam V. Nguyen, Andreas Musolff, Stefanie R. Lutz, Michael Rode, Rohini Kumar, and Jan H. Fleckenstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 303–318, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-303-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-303-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe increasing frequency of severe and prolonged droughts threatens our freshwater resources. While we understand drought impacts on water quantity, its effects on water quality remain largely unknown. Here, we studied the impact of the unprecedented 2018–2019 drought in Central Europe on nitrate export in a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment in Germany. We show that severe drought can reduce a catchment's capacity to retain nitrogen, intensifying the internal pollution and export of nitrate.\n\nEffect of topographic slope on the export of nitrate in humid catchments: a 3D model study\n\nJie Yang, Qiaoyu Wang, Ingo HeidbÃ¼chel, Chunhui Lu, Yueqing Xie, Andreas Musolff, and Jan H. Fleckenstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5051–5068, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5051-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5051-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assessed the effect of catchment topographic slopes on the nitrate export dynamics in terms of the nitrogen mass fluxes and concentration level using a coupled surface–subsurface model. We found that flatter landscapes tend to retain more nitrogen mass in the soil and export less nitrogen mass to the stream, explained by the reduced leaching and increased potential of degradation in flat landscapes. We emphasized that stream water quality is potentially less vulnerable in flatter landscapes.\n\nQUADICA: water QUAlity, DIscharge and Catchment Attributes for large-sample studies in Germany\n\nPia Ebeling, Rohini Kumar, Stefanie R. Lutz, Tam Nguyen, Fanny Sarrazin, Michael Weber, Olaf BÃ¼ttner, Sabine Attinger, and Andreas Musolff\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 3715–3741, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3715-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3715-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnvironmental data are critical for understanding and managing ecosystems, including the mitigation of water quality degradation. To increase data availability, we present the first large-sample water quality data set (QUADICA) of riverine macronutrient concentrations combined with water quantity, meteorological, and nutrient forcing data as well as catchment attributes. QUADICA covers 1386 German catchments to facilitate large-sample data-driven and modeling water quality assessments.\n\nBending of the concentration discharge relationship can inform about in-stream nitrate removal\n\nJoni Dehaspe, Fanny Sarrazin, Rohini Kumar, Jan H. Fleckenstein, and Andreas Musolff\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 6437–6463, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6437-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6437-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIncreased nitrate concentrations in surface waters can compromise river ecosystem health. As riverine nitrate uptake is hard to measure, we explore how low-frequency nitrate concentration and discharge observations (that are widely available) can help to identify (in)efficient uptake in river networks. We find that channel geometry and water velocity rather than the biological uptake capacity dominate the nitrate-discharge pattern at the outlet. The former can be used to predict uptake.\n\nSmall-scale topography explains patterns and dynamics of dissolved organic carbon exports from the riparian zone of a temperate, forested catchment\n\nBenedikt J. Werner, Oliver J. Lechtenfeld, Andreas Musolff, Gerrit H. de Rooij, Jie Yang, Ralf GrÃ¼ndling, Ulrike Werban, and Jan H. Fleckenstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 6067–6086, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6067-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6067-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from riparian zones (RZs) is an important yet poorly understood component of the catchment carbon budget. This study chemically and spatially classifies DOC source zones within a RZ of a small catchment to assess DOC export patterns. Results highlight that DOC export from only a small fraction of the RZ with distinct DOC composition dominates overall DOC export. The application of a spatial, topographic proxy can be used to improve DOC export models.\n\nTechnical note: Evaluation of a low-cost evaporation protection method for portable water samplers\n\nJana von Freyberg, Julia L. A. Knapp, Andrea RÃ¼cker, BjÃ¸rn Studer, and James W. Kirchner\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5821–5834, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5821-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5821-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAutomated water samplers are often used to collect precipitation and streamwater samples for subsequent isotope analysis, but the isotopic signal of these samples may be altered due to evaporative fractionation occurring during the storage inside the autosamplers in the field. In this article we present and evaluate a cost-efficient modification to the Teledyne ISCO automated water sampler that prevents isotopic enrichment through evaporative fractionation of the water samples.\n\nOn the shape of forward transit time distributions in low-order catchments\n\nIngo HeidbÃ¼chel, Jie Yang, Andreas Musolff, Peter Troch, Ty FerrÃ©, and Jan H. Fleckenstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2895–2920, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2895-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2895-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith the help of a 3-D computer model we examined how long the water of different rain events stays inside small catchments before it is discharged and how the nature of this discharge is controlled by different catchment and climate properties. We found that one can only predict the discharge dynamics when taking into account a combination of catchment and climate properties (i.e., there was not one single most important predictor). Our results can help to manage water pollution events.\n\nConcentrationâdischarge relationships vary among hydrological events, reflecting differences in event characteristics\n\nJulia L. A. Knapp, Jana von Freyberg, BjÃ¸rn Studer, Leonie Kiewiet, and James W. Kirchner\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2561–2576, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2561-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2561-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges of stream water chemistry in response to discharge changes provide important insights into the storage and release of water from the catchment. Here we investigate the variability in concentration–discharge relationships among different solutes and hydrologic events and relate it to catchment conditions and dominant water sources.\n\nTechnical note: An improved discharge sensitivity metric for young water fractions\n\nFrancesc Gallart, Jana von Freyberg, MarÃ­a Valiente, James W. Kirchner, Pilar Llorens, and JÃ©rÃ´me Latron\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1101–1107, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1101-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1101-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow catchments store and release rain or melting water is still not well known. Now, it is broadly accepted that most of the water in streams is older than several months, and a relevant part may be many years old. But the age of water depends on the stream regime, being usually younger during high flows. This paper tries to provide tools for better analysing how the age of waters varies with flow in a catchment and for comparing the behaviour of catchments diverging in climate, size and regime.\n\nHigh-frequency measurements explain quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon mobilization in a headwater catchment\n\nBenedikt J. Werner, Andreas Musolff, Oliver J. Lechtenfeld, Gerrit H. de Rooij, Marieke R. Oosterwoud, and Jan H. Fleckenstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 4497–4516, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4497-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4497-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIncreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in streams can pose a threat to downstream water resources. Analyzing data from an in-stream probe we found that hydroclimatic and hydrological drivers can describe up to 72 % of the observed DOC concentration and composition variability. Variability was found to be highest during discharge events with warm and dry preconditions. The findings suggest an impact of climate change on DOC exports and thus also on downstream water quality.\n\nTrajectories of nitrate input and output in three nested catchments along a land use gradient\n\nSophie Ehrhardt, Rohini Kumar, Jan H. Fleckenstein, Sabine Attinger, and Andreas Musolff\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3503–3524, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3503-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3503-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study shows quantitative and temporal offsets between nitrogen input and riverine output, using time series of three nested catchments in central Germany. The riverine concentrations show lagged reactions to the input, but at the same time exhibit strong inter-annual changes in the relationship between riverine discharge and concentration. The study found a strong retention of nitrogen that is dominantly assigned to a hydrological N legacy, which will affect future stream concentrations.\n\nMonitoring snowpack outflow volumes and their isotopic composition to better understand streamflow generation during rain-on-snow events\n\nAndrea RÃ¼cker, Stefan Boss, James W. Kirchner, and Jana von Freyberg\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2983–3005, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2983-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2983-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo better understand how rain-on-snow (ROS) events affect snowpack outflow volumes and streamflow generation, we measured snowpack outflow volumes and isotopic composition during 10 ROS events with automated snowmelt lysimeters at three locations in a pre-Alpine catchment. We quantified the spatio-temporal variability of snowpack outflow and its relative contribution to streamflow, and identified rainfall characteristics and initial snow depth as major controls on snow hydrological processes.\n\nStudying catchment storm response using event- and pre-event-water volumes as fractions of precipitation rather than discharge\n\nJana von Freyberg, BjÃ¸rn Studer, Michael Rinderer, and James W. Kirchner\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 5847–5865, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5847-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5847-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show event- and pre-event-water volumes as fractions of precipitation, rather than discharge, to provide an alternative and more insightful approach to study catchment hydrological processes. For this, we analyze 24 storm events using high-frequency measurements of stable water isotopes in stream water and precipitation at a pre-Alpine catchment. Antecedent wetness and storm characteristics are dominant controls on event-water discharge and pre-event-water mobilization from storage.\n\nIdeas and perspectives: Tracing terrestrial ecosystem water fluxes using hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes â challenges and opportunities from an interdisciplinary perspective\n\nDaniele Penna, Luisa Hopp, Francesca Scandellari, Scott T.

Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water are a powerful tool for tracking water fluxes, although the heterogeneity of natural systems and practical methodological issues still limit their full application. Here, we examine the challenges in this research field and highlight new perspectives based on interdisciplinary research.\n\nSensitivity of young water fractions to hydro-climatic forcing and landscape properties across 22Â Swiss catchments\n\nJana von Freyberg, Scott T. Allen, Stefan Seeger, Markus Weiler, and James W. Kirchner\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3841–3861, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-3841-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-3841-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe explored how the fraction of streamflow younger than ca. 3 months (Fyw) varies with landscape characteristics and climatic forcing, using an extensive isotope data set from 22 Swiss catchments. Overall, Fyw tends to be larger when catchments are wet and discharge is correspondingly higher, indicating an increase in the proportional contribution of faster flow paths at higher flows. We quantify this discharge sensitivity of Fyw and relate it to the dominant streamflow-generating mechanisms.\n\nEffects of climatic seasonality on the isotopic composition of evaporating soil waters\n\nPaolo Benettin, Till H. M. Volkmann, Jana von Freyberg, Jay Frentress, Daniele Penna, Todd E. Dawson, and James W. Kirchner\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2881–2890, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2881-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2881-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEvaporation causes the isotopic composition of soil water to become different from that of the original precipitation source. If multiple samples originating from the same source are available, they can be used to reconstruct the original source composition. However, soil water is influenced by seasonal variability in both precipitation sources and evaporation patterns. We show that this variability, if not accounted for, can lead to biased estimates of the precipitation source water.\n\nOn the effectiveness of recession analysis methods for capturing the characteristic storage-discharge relation: An intercomparison study\n\nXing Chen, Mukesh Kumar, Stefano Basso, and Marco Marani\n\nHydrol.

Jawitz, P. Suresh C. Rao, Christoph G. JÃ¤ger, Jan H. Fleckenstein, Michael Rode, and Dietrich Borchardt\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 4391–4407, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4391-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4391-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon and nutrient export regimes were analyzed from archetypal headwater catchments to downstream reaches. In headwater catchments, land use and lithology determine land-to-stream C, N and P transfer processes. The crucial role of riparian zones in C, N and P coupling was investigated.

The resulting data streams provide an unprecedented view of hydrochemical dynamics on the catchment scale. Based on a detailed analysis of the variable behavior of isotopic and chemical tracers in stream water and precipitation over a 4-week period, we developed a conceptual hypothesis for runoff generation in the studied catchment.\n\nA European Flood Database: facilitating comprehensive flood research beyond administrative boundaries\n\nJ.

Zimba, Miriam Coenders-Gerrits, Kawawa E. Banda, Petra Hulsman, Nick van de Giesen, Imasiku A. Nyambe, and Hubert H. G. Savenije\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

The miombo species are also said to have access to soil moisture in deep soils, including groundwater in the dry season. Satellite-based evaporation estimates, temporal trends, and magnitudes differ the most in the dry season, most likely due to inadequate understanding and representation of the highlighted miombo species attributes in simulations.\n\nRegionalization of GR4J model parameters for river flow prediction in ParanÃ¡, Brazil\n\nLouise Akemi Kuana, Arlan Scortegagna Almeida, EmÃ­lio Graciliano Ferreira Mercuri, and Steffen Manfred Noe\n\nHydrol.

The regionalization method based on physiographic–climatic similarity had the best performance for predicting daily and Q95 reference flow. We showed that basins without flow monitoring can have a good approximation of streamflow using machine learning and physiographic–climatic information as inputs.\n\nEvolution of river regimes in the Mekong River basin over 8 decades and the role of dams in recent hydrological extremes\n\nHuy Dang and Yadu Pokhrel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

These findings could help us rethink the planning of future dams and water resource management in the MRB.\n\nSkill of seasonal flow forecasts at catchment scale: an assessment across South Korea\n\nYongshin Lee, Francesca Pianosi, Andres PeÃ±uela, and Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez\n\nHydrol.

Our findings highlight that using seasonal weather forecasts for predicting flow patterns 1 to 3 months ahead is effective, especially during dry years. This suggest that seasonal weather forecasts can be helpful in improving the management of water resources.\n\nTo what extent do flood-inducing storm events change future flood hazards?\n\nMariam Khanam, Giulia Sofia, and Emmanouil N.

Predicting post-storm geomorphic changes is challenging. Using self-organizing maps and machine learning, this study forecasts post-storm alterations in stage–discharge relationships across 3101 US stream gages. The provided framework can aid in updating hazard assessments by identifying rivers prone to change, integrating channel adjustments into flood hazard assessment.\n\nWhen ancient numerical demons meet physics-informed machine learning: adjoint-based gradients for implicit differentiable modeling\n\nYalan Song, Wouter J.

We developed an adjoint-based DM for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for hydrological modeling, reducing distorted fluxes and physical parameters from errors in models that use explicit and operation-splitting schemes. With a better numerical scheme and improved structure, the adjoint-based DM matches or surpasses long short-term memory (LSTM) performance.\n\nAssessing the impact of climate change on high return levels of peak flows in Bavaria applying the CRCM5 large ensemble\n\nFlorian Willkofer, Raul R. Wood, and Ralf Ludwig\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Hence, this study uses data from a regional climate model, SMILE, to drive a high-resolution hydrological model for 98 catchments of hydrological Bavaria and exploits the large database to derive robust values for the 100-year flood events. Results indicate an increase in frequency and intensity for most catchments in the future.\n\nImpacts of climate and land surface change on catchment evapotranspiration and runoff from 1951 to 2020 in Saxony, Germany\n\nMaik Renner and Corina Hauffe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2849–2869, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2849-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2849-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate and land surface changes influence the partitioning of water balance components decisively. Their impact is quantified for 71 catchments in Saxony. Germany. Distinct signatures in the joint water and energy budgets are found: (i) past forest dieback caused a decrease in and subsequent recovery of evapotranspiration in the affected regions, and (ii) the recent shift towards higher aridity imposed a large decline in runoff that has not been seen in the observation records before.\n\nQuantifying and reducing flood forecast uncertainty by the CHUP-BMA method\n\nZhen Cui, Shenglian Guo, Hua Chen, Dedi Liu, Yanlai Zhou, and Chong-Yu Xu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2809–2829, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2809-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2809-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnsemble forecasting facilitates reliable flood forecasting and warning. This study couples the copula-based hydrologic uncertainty processor (CHUP) with Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and proposes the novel CHUP-BMA method of reducing inflow forecasting uncertainty of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The CHUP-BMA avoids the normal distribution assumption in the HUP-BMA and considers the constraint of initial conditions, which can improve the deterministic and probabilistic forecast performance.\n\nDeveloping a tile drainage module for the Cold Regions Hydrological Model: lessons from a farm in southern Ontario, Canada\n\nMazda Kompanizare, Diogo Costa, Merrin L. Macrae, John W. Pomeroy, and Richard M. Petrone\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Tile flow and water levels are simulated by considering the effect of capillary fringe thickness, drainable water and seasonal regional groundwater dynamics. The model was applied to a small well-instrumented farm in southern Ontario, Canada, where there are concerns about the impacts of agricultural drainage into Lake Erie.\n\nTo bucket or not to bucket? Analyzing the performance and interpretability of hybrid hydrological models with dynamic parameterization\n\nEduardo AcuÃ±a Espinoza, Ralf Loritz, Manuel Ãlvarez Chaves, Nicole BÃ¤uerle, and Uwe Ehret\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

One hybrid approach is the dynamic parameterization of conceptual models using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. We explored this method to evaluate the effect of the flexibility given by LSTMs on the process-based part.\n\nWidespread flooding dynamics under climate change: characterising floods using grid-based hydrological modelling and regional climate projections\n\nAdam Griffin, Alison L. Kay, Paul Sayers, Victoria Bell, Elizabeth Stewart, and Sam Carr\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2635–2650, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2635-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2635-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWidespread flooding is a major problem in the UK and is greatly affected by climate change and land-use change. To look at how widespread flooding changes in the future, climate model data (UKCP18) were used with a hydrological model (Grid-to-Grid) across the UK, and 14 400 events were identified between two time slices: 1980–2010 and 2050–2080. There was a strong increase in the number of winter events in the future time slice and in the peak return periods.\n\nHESS Opinions: The sword of Damocles of the impossible flood\n\nAlberto Montanari, Bruno Merz, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2603–2615, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2603-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2603-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods often take communities by surprise, as they are often considered virtually impossible yet are an ever-present threat similar to the sword suspended over the head of Damocles in the classical Greek anecdote. We discuss four reasons why extremely large floods carry a risk that is often larger than expected. We provide suggestions for managing the risk of megafloods by calling for a creative exploration of hazard scenarios and communicating the unknown corners of the reality of floods.\n\nMetamorphic testing of machine learning and conceptual hydrologic models\n\nPeter Reichert, Kai Ma, Marvin HÃ¶ge, Fabrizio Fenicia, Marco Baity-Jesi, Dapeng Feng, and Chaopeng Shen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2505–2529, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2505-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2505-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared the predicted change in catchment outlet discharge to precipitation and temperature change for conceptual and machine learning hydrological models. We found that machine learning models, despite providing excellent fit and prediction capabilities, can be unreliable regarding the prediction of the effect of temperature change for low-elevation catchments. This indicates the need for caution when applying them for the prediction of the effect of climate change.\n\nThe influence of human activities on streamflow reductions during the megadrought in central Chile\n\nNicolÃ¡s Ãlamos, Camila Alvarez-Garreton, Ariel MuÃ±oz, and Ãlvaro GonzÃ¡lez-Reyes\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2483–2503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2483-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2483-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we assess the effects of climate and water use on streamflow reductions and drought intensification during the last 3 decades in central Chile. We address this by contrasting streamflow observations with near-natural streamflow simulations. We conclude that while the lack of precipitation dominates streamflow reductions in the megadrought, water uses have not diminished during this time, causing a worsening of the hydrological drought conditions and maladaptation conditions.\n\nElevational control of isotopic composition and application in understanding hydrologic processes in the mid Merced River catchment, Sierra Nevada, California, USA\n\nFengjing Liu, Martha H. Conklin, and Glenn D. Shaw\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2239–2258, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2239-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2239-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMountain snowpack has been declining and more precipitation falls as rain than snow. Using stable isotopes, we found flows and flow duration in Yosemite Creek are most sensitive to climate warming due to strong evaporation of waterfalls, potentially lengthening the dry-up period of waterfalls in summer and negatively affecting tourism. Groundwater recharge in Yosemite Valley is primarily from the upper snow–rain transition (2000–2500 m) and very vulnerable to a reduction in the snow–rain ratio.\n\nEnhancing long short-term memory (LSTM)-based streamflow prediction with a spatially distributed approach\n\nQiutong Yu, Bryan A. Tolson, Hongren Shen, Ming Han, Juliane Mai, and Jimmy Lin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2107–2122, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2107-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2107-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is challenging to incorporate input variables' spatial distribution information when implementing long short-term memory (LSTM) models for streamflow prediction. This work presents a novel hybrid modelling approach to predict streamflow while accounting for spatial variability. We evaluated the performance against lumped LSTM predictions in 224 basins across the Great Lakes region in North America. This approach shows promise for predicting streamflow in large, ungauged basin.\n\nBroadleaf afforestation impacts on terrestrial hydrology insignificant compared to climate change in Great Britain\n\nMarcus Buechel, Louise Slater, and Simon Dadson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2081–2105, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAfforestation has been proposed internationally, but the hydrological implications of such large increases in the spatial extent of woodland are not fully understood. In this study, we use a land surface model to simulate hydrology across Great Britain with realistic afforestation scenarios and potential climate changes. Countrywide afforestation minimally influences hydrology, when compared to climate change, and reduces low streamflow whilst not lowering the highest flows.\n\nImpacts of spatiotemporal resolutions of precipitation on flood event simulation based on multimodel structures â a case study over the Xiang River basin in China\n\nQian Zhu, Xiaodong Qin, Dongyang Zhou, Tiantian Yang, and Xinyi Song\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1665–1686, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1665-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1665-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInput data, model and calibration strategy can affect the accuracy of flood event simulation and prediction. Satellite-based precipitation with different spatiotemporal resolutions is an important input source. Data-driven models are sometimes proven to be more accurate than hydrological models. Event-based calibration and conventional strategy are two options adopted for flood simulation. This study targets the three concerns for accurate flood event simulation and prediction.\n\nA network approach for multiscale catchment classification using traits\n\nFabio Ciulla and Charuleka Varadharajan\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1617–1651, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1617-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1617-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new method based on network science for unsupervised classification of large datasets and apply it to classify 9067 US catchments and 274 biophysical traits at multiple scales. We find that our trait-based approach produces catchment classes with distinct streamflow behavior and that spatial patterns emerge amongst pristine and human-impacted catchments. This method can be widely used beyond hydrology to identify patterns, reduce trait redundancy, and select representative sites.\n\nMulti-model approach in a variable spatial framework for streamflow simulation\n\nCyril ThÃ©bault, Charles Perrin, Vazken AndrÃ©assian, Guillaume Thirel, SÃ©bastien Legrand, and Olivier Delaigue\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1539–1566, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1539-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1539-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreamflow forecasting is useful for many applications, ranging from population safety (e.g. floods) to water resource management (e.g. agriculture or hydropower). To this end, hydrological models must be optimized. However, a model is inherently wrong. This study aims to analyse the contribution of a multi-model approach within a variable spatial framework to improve streamflow simulations. The underlying idea is to take advantage of the strength of each modelling framework tested.\n\nAdvancing understanding of lakeâwatershed hydrology: a fully coupled numerical model illustrated by Qinghai Lake\n\nLele Shu, Xiaodong Li, Yan Chang, Xianhong Meng, Hao Chen, Yuan Qi, Hongwei Wang, Zhaoguo Li, and Shihua Lyu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1477–1491, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1477-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1477-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a new model to better understand how water moves in a lake basin. Our model improves upon previous methods by accurately capturing the complexity of water movement, both on the surface and subsurface. Our model, tested using data from China's Qinghai Lake, accurately replicates complex water movements and identifies contributing factors of the lake's water balance. The findings provide a robust tool for predicting hydrological processes, aiding water resource planning.\n\nHESS Opinions: A few camels or a whole caravan?\n\nFranziska Maria Clerc-Schwarzenbach, Giovanni Selleri, Mattia Neri, Elena Toth, Ilja van Meerveld, and Jan Seibert\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-864,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-864, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare the catchment forcing data provided in large-sample datasets, namely the Caravan dataset and three of the original CAMELS datasets (US, BR, GB). We show that the differences affect hydrological model performance and that the data quality in the Caravan dataset is lower than the one in the CAMELS datasets, both for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. We want to raise awareness of the lower data quality in Caravan and we suggest possible improvements for the Caravan dataset.\n\nTechnical note: Testing the connection between hillslope-scale runoff fluctuations and streamflow hydrographs at the outlet of large river basins\n\nRicardo Mantilla, Morgan Fonley, and NicolÃ¡s VelÃ¡squez\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1373–1382, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1373-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1373-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrologists strive to “Be right for the right reasons” when modeling the hydrologic cycle; however, the datasets available to validate hydrological models are sparse, and in many cases, they comprise streamflow observations at the outlets of large catchments. In this work, we show that matching streamflow observations at the outlet of a large basin is not a reliable indicator of a correct description of the small-scale runoff processes.\n\nEmpirical stream thermal sensitivity cluster on the landscape according to geology and climate\n\nLillian M. McGill, E. Ashley Steel, and Aimee H. Fullerton\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1351–1371, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1351-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1351-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examines the relationship between air and river temperatures in Washington's Snoqualmie and Wenatchee basins. We used classification and regression approaches to show that the sensitivity of river temperature to air temperature is variable across basins and controlled largely by geology and snowmelt. Findings can be used to inform strategies for river basin restoration and conservation, such as identifying climate-insensitive areas of the basin that should be preserved and protected.\n\nKarst aquifer discharge response to rainfall interpreted as anomalous transport\n\nDan Elhanati, Nadine Goeppert, and Brian Berkowitz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-46,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-46, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA continuous time random walk framework was developed to allow modeling of a karst aquifer discharge response to measured rainfall. The application of the numerical model yielded robust fits between modeled and measured discharge values, especially for the distinctive long tails found during recession times. The findings shed light on the interplay of slow and fast flow in the karst system, and establish the application of the model for simulating flow and transport in karst systems.\n\nDeep learning for monthly rainfallârunoff modelling: a large-sample comparison with conceptual models across Australia\n\nStephanie R. Clark, Julien Lerat, Jean-Michel Perraud, and Peter Fitch\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

It is found that the deep learning models match or outperform the traditional models in over two-thirds of the river catchments, indicating feasibility in a wide variety of conditions.\n\nComment on “Are soils overrated in hydrology?” by Gao et al. (2023)\n\nYing Zhao, Mehdi Rahmati, Harry Vereecken, and Dani Or\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-629,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-629, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGao et al. (2023) question the importance of soil in hydrology, sparking debate. We acknowledge some valid points but critique their broad, unsubstantiated views on soil's role. Our response highlights three key areas: (1) the false divide between ecosystem-centric and soil-centric approaches, (2) the vital yet varied impact of soil properties, and (3) the call for a scale-aware framework. We aim to unify these perspectives, enhancing hydrology's comprehensive understanding.\n\nOn optimization of calibrations of a distributed hydrological model with spatially distributed information on snow\n\nDipti Tiwari, MÃ©lanie Trudel, and Robert Leconte\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1127–1146, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1127-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1127-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalibrating hydrological models with multi-objective functions enhances model robustness. By using spatially distributed snow information in the calibration, the model performance can be enhanced without compromising the outputs. In this study the HYDROTEL model was calibrated in seven different experiments, incorporating the SPAEF (spatial efficiency) metric alongside Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE), with the aim of identifying the optimal calibration strategy.\n\nMulti-decadal fluctuations in root zone storage capacity through vegetation adaptation to hydro-climatic variability has minor effects on the hydrological response in the Neckar basin, Germany\n\nSiyuan Wang, Markus Hrachowitz, and Gerrit Schoups\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-62,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-62, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRoot zone storage capacity (Sumax) significantly changes over multiple decades reflecting vegetation adaptation to climatic variability. However, this temporal evolution of Sumax cannot explain long-term fluctuations in the partitioning of water fluxes as expressed by deviations ΔIE from the parametric Budyko curve over time with different climatic conditions and it does not have any significant effects on shorter-term hydrological response characteristics of the upper Neckar catchment.\n\nToward interpretable LSTM-based modeling of hydrological systems\n\nLuis Andres De la Fuente, Mohammad Reza Ehsani, Hoshin Vijai Gupta, and Laura Elizabeth Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 945–971, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) is a widely used machine-learning model in hydrology, but it is difficult to extract knowledge from it. We propose HydroLSTM, which represents processes like a hydrological reservoir. Models based on HydroLSTM perform similarly to LSTM while requiring fewer cell states. The learned parameters are informative about the dominant hydrology of a catchment. Our results show how parsimony and hydrological knowledge extraction can be achieved by using the new structure.\n\nFlow intermittence prediction using a hybrid hydrological modelling approach: influence of observed intermittence data on the training of a random forest model\n\nLouise Mimeau, Annika KÃ¼nne, Flora Branger, Sven Kralisch, Alexandre Devers, and Jean-Philippe Vidal\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 851–871, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-851-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-851-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModelling flow intermittence is essential for predicting the future evolution of drying in river networks and better understanding the ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, modelling flow intermittence is challenging, and observed data on temporary rivers are scarce. This study presents a new modelling approach for predicting flow intermittence in river networks and shows that combining different sources of observed data reduces the model uncertainty.\n\nWhat controls the tail behaviour of flood series: rainfall or runoff generation?\n\nElena Macdonald, Bruno Merz, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Viet Dung Nguyen, Xiaoxiang Guan, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 833–850, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some rivers, the occurrence of extreme flood events is more likely than in other rivers – they have heavy-tailed distributions. We find that threshold processes in the runoff generation lead to such a relatively high occurrence probability of extremes. Further, we find that beyond a certain return period, i.e. for rare events, rainfall is often the dominant control compared to runoff generation. Our results can help to improve the estimation of the occurrence probability of extreme floods.\n\nSeasonal prediction of end-of-dry-season watershed behavior in a highly interconnected alluvial watershed in northern California\n\nClaire Kouba and Thomas Harter\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 691–718, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-691-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-691-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some watersheds, the severity of the dry season has a large impact on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we design a way to predict, 5–6 months in advance, how severe the dry season will be in a rural watershed in northern California. This early warning can support seasonal adaptive management. To predict these two values, we assess data about snow, rain, groundwater, and river flows. We find that maximum snowpack and total wet season rainfall best predict dry season severity.\n\nGlaciers determine the sensitivity of hydrological processes to perturbed climate in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau\n\nYi Nan and Fuqiang Tian\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 669–689, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-669-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-669-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper utilized a tracer-aided model validated by multiple datasets in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau to analyze hydrological sensitivity to climate change. The spatial pattern of the local hydrological sensitivities and the influence factors were analyzed in particular. The main finding of this paper is that the local hydrological sensitivity in mountainous basins is determined by the relationship between the glacier area ratio and the mean annual precipitation.\n\nLeveraging gauge networks and strategic discharge measurements to aid the development of continuous streamflow records\n\nMichael J. Vlah, Matthew R. V. Ross, Spencer Rhea, and Emily S. Bernhardt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 545–573, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-545-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-545-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVirtual stream gauging enables continuous streamflow estimation where a gauge might be difficult or impractical to install. We reconstructed flow at 27 gauges of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), informing ~199 site-months of missing data in the official record and improving that accuracy of official estimates at 11 sites. This study shows that machine learning, but also routine regression methods, can be used to supplement existing gauge networks and reduce monitoring costs.\n\nOn the need for physical constraints in deep learning rainfallârunoff projections under climate change: a sensitivity analysis to warming and shifts in potential evapotranspiration\n\nSungwook Wi and Scott Steinschneider\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 479–503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-479-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-479-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate whether deep learning (DL) models can produce physically plausible streamflow projections under climate change. We address this question by focusing on modeled responses to increases in temperature and potential evapotranspiration and by employing three DL and three process-based hydrological models. The results suggest that physical constraints regarding model architecture and input are necessary to promote the physical realism of DL hydrological projections under climate change.\n\nEvaluation of hydrological models on small mountainous catchments: impact of the meteorological forcings\n\nGuillaume Evin, Matthieu Le Lay, Catherine Fouchier, David Penot, Francois Colleoni, Alexandre Mas, Pierre-AndrÃ© Garambois, and Olivier Laurantin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 261–281, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological modelling of mountainous catchments is challenging for many reasons, the main one being the temporal and spatial representation of precipitation forcings. This study presents an evaluation of the hydrological modelling of 55 small mountainous catchments of the northern French Alps, focusing on the influence of the type of precipitation reanalyses used as inputs. These evaluations emphasize the added value of radar measurements, in particular for the reproduction of flood events.\n\nHESS Opinions: Never train an LSTM on a single basin\n\nFrederik Kratzert, Martin Gauch, Daniel Klotz, and Grey Nearing\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-275,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-275, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecently, a special type of neural network architecture became increasingly popular in hydrology literature. However, in most applications, this model was applied as a one-to-one replacement for hydrology models without adapting or rethinking the experimental setup. In this opinion paper, we show how this is almost always a bad decision and how using these kinds of models require the use of large-sample hydrology datasets.\n\nProjecting sediment export from two highly glacierized alpine catchments under climate change: exploring non-parametric regression as an analysis tool\n\nLena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, and Axel Bronstert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 139–161, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow suspended sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas responds to future climate change is hardly assessable as many interacting processes are involved, and appropriate physical models are lacking. We present the first study, to our knowledge, exploring machine learning to project sediment export until 2100 in two high-alpine catchments. We find that uncertainties due to methodological limitations are small until 2070. Negative trends imply that peak sediment may have already passed.\n\nSimulation-Based Inference for Parameter Estimation of Complex Watershed Simulators\n\nRobert Hull, Elena Leonarduzzi, Luis De La Fuente, Hoang Viet Tran, Andrew Bennett, Peter Melchior, Reed M. Maxwell, and Laura E. Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-264,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-264, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge-scale hydrologic a needed tool to explore complex watershed processes and how they may evolve under a changing climate. However, calibrating them can be difficult because they are costly to run and have many unknown parameters. We implement a state-of-the-art approach to model calibration with a set of experiments in the Upper Colorado River Basin.\n\nA framework for parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analysis for holistic hydrologic modeling using SWAT+\n\nSalam A. Abbas, Ryan T. Bailey, Jeremy T. White, Jeffrey G. Arnold, Michael J. White, Natalja Äerkasova, and Jungang Gao\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4485–4503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4485-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4485-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed the water budget of nested karst catchments using simple methods and modeling. By utilizing the available data on precipitation and discharge, we were able to determine the response lag-time by adopting new techniques. Additionally, we modeled snow cover dynamics and evapotranspiration with the use of Earth observations, providing a concise overview of the water budget for the basin and its subbasins. We have made the data, models, and workflows accessible for further study.\n\nComparing quantile regression forest and mixture density long short-term memory models for probabilistic post-processing of satellite precipitation-driven streamflow simulations\n\nYuhang Zhang, Aizhong Ye, Bita Analui, Phu Nguyen, Soroosh Sorooshian, Kuolin Hsu, and Yuxuan Wang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4529–4550, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study shows that while the quantile regression forest (QRF) and countable mixtures of asymmetric Laplacians long short-term memory (CMAL-LSTM) models demonstrate similar proficiency in multipoint probabilistic predictions, QRF excels in smaller watersheds and CMAL-LSTM in larger ones. CMAL-LSTM performs better in single-point deterministic predictions, whereas QRF model is more efficient overall.\n\nProjected future changes in cryosphere and hydrology of a mountainous catchment in the Upper Heihe River, China\n\nZehua Chang, Hongkai Gao, Leilei Yong, Kang Wang, Rensheng Chen, Chuntan Han, Otgonbayar Demberel, Batsuren Dorjsuren, Shugui Hou, and Zheng Duan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3043,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3043, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn integrated cryospheric-hydrologic model, FLEX-Cryo, was developed, considered glaciers, snow cover, frozen soil, and their dynamic impacts on hydrology. We utilized the model to simulate the future changes in cryosphere and hydrology in Hulu catchment. Our projections showed that the two glaciers will melt out around 2050; snow cover will reduce; and permafrost will degrade. For hydrology, runoff will decrease after glacier melt out; and permafrost degradation will increase baseflow.\n\nRecent ground thermo-hydrological changes in a southern Tibetan endorheic catchment and implications for lake level changes\n\nLÃ©o C. P. Martin, Sebastian Westermann, Michele Magni, Fanny Brun, Joel Fiddes, Yanbin Lei, Philip Kraaijenbrink, Tamara Mathys, Moritz Langer, Simon Allen, and Walter W. Immerzeel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4409–4436, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAcross the Tibetan Plateau, many large lakes have been changing level during the last decades as a response to climate change. In high-mountain environments, water fluxes from the land to the lakes are linked to the ground temperature of the land and to the energy fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, which are modified by climate change. With a numerical model, we test how these water and energy fluxes have changed over the last decades and how they influence the lake level variations.\n\nTowards robust seasonal streamflow forecasts in mountainous catchments: impact of calibration metric selection in hydrological modeling\n\nDiego Araya, Pablo A. Mendoza, Eduardo MuÃ±oz-Castro, and James McPhee\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4385–4408, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDynamical systems are used by many agencies worldwide to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts, which are critical for decision-making. Such systems rely on hydrology models, which contain parameters that are typically estimated using a target performance metric (i.e., objective function). This study explores the effects of this decision across mountainous basins in Chile, illustrating tradeoffs between seasonal forecast quality and the models' capability to simulate streamflow characteristics.\n\nModelling flood frequency and magnitude in a glacially conditioned, heterogeneous landscape: testing the importance of land cover and land use\n\nPamela E. Tetford and Joseph R. Desloges\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3977–3998, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn efficient regional flood frequency model relates drainage area to discharge, with a major assumption of similar basin conditions. In a landscape with variable glacial deposits and land use, we characterize varying hydrological function using 28 explanatory variables. We demonstrate that (1) a heterogeneous landscape requires objective model selection criteria to optimize the fit of flow data, and (2) incorporating land use as a predictor variable improves the drainage area to discharge model.\n\nDirect integration of reservoirs' operations in a hydrological model for streamflow estimation: coupling a CLSTM model with MOHID-Land\n\nAna Ramos Oliveira, Tiago Brito Ramos, LÃ­gia Pinto, and Ramiro Neves\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3875–3893, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper intends to demonstrate the adequacy of a hybrid solution to overcome the difficulties related to the incorporation of human behavior when modeling hydrological processes. Two models were implemented, one to estimate the outflow of a reservoir and the other to simulate the hydrological processes of the watershed. With both models feeding each other, results show that the proposed approach significantly improved the streamflow estimation downstream of the reservoir.\n\nModelling the regional sensitivity of snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow generation to climate over the Canadian Prairies using a basin classification approach\n\nZhihua He, Kevin Shook, Christopher Spence, John W. Pomeroy, and Colin Whitfield\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3525–3546, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study evaluated the impacts of climate change on snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow over the Canadian Prairies. The entire prairie region was divided into seven basin types. We found strong variations of hydrological sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes in different land covers and basins, which suggests that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the prairies.\n\nCited articles"
