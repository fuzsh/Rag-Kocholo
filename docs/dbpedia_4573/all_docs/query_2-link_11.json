        "meta_description": "Abstract. Accurate streamflow estimation is essential for effective water resource management and adapting to extreme events in the face of changing climate conditions. Hydrological models have been the conventional approach for streamflow interpolation and extrapolation in time and space for the past few decades. However, their large-scale applications have encountered challenges, including issues related to efficiency, complex parameterization, and constrained performance. Deep learning methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have emerged as a promising and efficient approach for large-scale streamflow estimation. In this study, we have conducted a series of experiments to identify optimal hybrid modeling schemes to consolidate physically based models with LSTM aimed at enhancing streamflow estimation in Denmark. The results show that the hybrid modeling schemes outperformed the Danish National Water Resources Model (DKM) in both gauged and ungauged basins. While the standalone LSTM rainfallârunoff model outperformed DKM in many basins, it faced challenges when predicting the streamflow in groundwater-dependent catchments. A serial hybrid modeling scheme (LSTM-q), which used DKM outputs and climate forcings as dynamic inputs for LSTM training, demonstrated higher performance. LSTM-q improved the mean NashâSutcliffe efficiency (NSE) by 0.22 in gauged basins and 0.12 in ungauged basins compared to DKM. Similar accuracy improvements were achieved with alternative hybrid schemes, i.e., by predicting the residuals between DKM-simulated streamflow and observations using LSTM. Moreover, the developed hybrid models enhanced the accuracy of extreme events, which encourages the integration of hybrid models within an operational forecasting framework. This study highlights the advantages of synergizing existing physically based hydrological models (PBMs) with LSTM models, and the proposed hybrid schemes hold the potential to achieve high-quality large-scale streamflow estimations.",

Our research indicates that the rising groundwater table due to climate change will result in an increase in landslide activity. Previous incidents of extremely wet winters have caused damage to infrastructure and buildings due to landslides. This study is the first of its kind to exclusively rely on public data and examine landslides in Denmark.\n\nData-driven modeling of hydraulic head time series: results and lessons learned from the 2022 groundwater modeling challenge\n\nRaoul Alexander Collenteur, Ezra Haaf, Mark Bakker, Tanja Liesch, Andreas Wunsch, Jenny Soonthornrangsan, Jeremy White, Nick Martin, Rui Hugman, Michael Fienen, Ed de Sousa, Didier Vanden Berghe, Xinyang Fan, Tim Peterson, Janis BikÅ¡e, Antoine Di Ciacca, Xinyue Wang, Yang Zheng, Maximilian NÃ¶lscher, Julian Koch, Raphael Schneider, Nikolas Benavides HÃ¶glund, Sivarama Krishna Reddy Chidepudi, Abel Henriot, Nicolas Massei, Abderrahim Jardani, Max Gustav Rudolph, Amir Rouhani, Jaime GÃ³mez-HernÃ¡ndez, Seifeddine Jomaa, Anna PÃ¶lz, Tim Franken, Morteza Behbooei, Jimmy Lin, Bryan Tolson, and Rojin Meysami\n\nHydrol.

For all wells, reasonable performance was obtained by at least 1 team from group. There was not 1 team that performed best for all wells. In conclusion, the challenge was a successful initiative to compare different models and learn from each other.\n\nAn inter-comparison of approaches and frameworks to quantify irrigation from satellite data\n\nSÃ¸ren Julsgaard Kragh, Jacopo Dari, Sara Modanesi, Christian Massari, Luca Brocca, Rasmus Fensholt, Simon Stisen, and Julian Koch\n\nHydrol.

To evaluate the methodologies, we compared various approaches to quantify irrigation using soil moisture, evapotranspiration, or both within a novel baseline framework, together with irrigation estimates from other studies. We show that the synergy from using two equally important components in a joint approach within a baseline framework yields better irrigation estimates.\n\nPotential of Machine learning techniques compared to MIKE-SHE model for drain flow predictions in tile-drained agricultural areas of Denmark\n\nHafsa Mahmood, Ty P.

We show that irrigation water use can be estimated with high precision by comparing satellite and rainfed hydrological model estimates of evapotranspiration. We believe that our work can support sustainable water resource management, as it addresses the uncertainty of a key component of the water balance that remains challenging to quantify.\n\nWater-table-driven greenhouse gas emission estimates guide peatland restoration at national scale\n\nJulian Koch, Lars Elsgaard, Mogens H. Greve, Steen GyldenkÃ¦rne, Cecilie Hermansen, Gregor Levin, Shubiao Wu, and Simon Stisen\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2387–2403, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2387-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2387-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUtilizing peatlands for agriculture leads to large emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide. The emissions are triggered by lowering the water table, which is a necessary step in order to make peatlands arable. Many countries aim at reducing their emissions by restoring peatlands, which can be achieved by stopping agricultural activities and thereby raising the water table. We estimate a total emission of 2.6 Mt CO2-eq for organic-rich peatlands in Denmark and a potential reduction of 77 %.\n\nMachine-learning-based downscaling of modelled climate change impacts on groundwater table depth\n\nRaphael Schneider, Julian Koch, Lars Troldborg, Hans JÃ¸rgen Henriksen, and Simon Stisen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5859–5877, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5859-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5859-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological models at high spatial resolution are computationally expensive. However, outputs from such models, such as the depth of the groundwater table, are often desired in high resolution. We developed a downscaling algorithm based on machine learning that allows us to increase spatial resolution of hydrological model outputs, alleviating computational burden. We successfully applied the downscaling algorithm to the climate-change-induced impacts on the groundwater table across Denmark.\n\nUse of expert elicitation to assign weights to climate and hydrological models in climate impact studies\n\nEva Sebok, Hans JÃ¸rgen Henriksen, Ernesto PastÃ©n-Zapata, Peter Berg, Guillaume Thirel, Anthony Lemoine, Andrea Lira-Loarca, Christiana Photiadou, Rafael Pimentel, Paul Royer-Gaspard, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen, Jean Philippe Vidal, Philippe Lucas-Picher, Markus G.

Thus, these models usually have a multitude of simulations using different future climate data. This study used the subjective opinion of experts to assess which climate and hydrological models are the most likely to correctly predict climate impacts, thereby easing the computational burden. The experts could select more likely hydrological models, while the climate models were deemed equally probable.\n\nExploring the combined use of SMAP and Sentinel-1 data for downscaling soil moisture beyond the 1 km scale\n\nRena Meyer, Wenmin Zhang, SÃ¸ren Julsgaard Kragh, Mie Andreasen, Karsten HÃ¸gh Jensen, Rasmus Fensholt, Simon Stisen, and Majken C. Looms\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3337–3357, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3337-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3337-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe amount and spatio-temporal distribution of soil moisture, the water in the upper soil, is of great relevance for agriculture and water management. Here, we investigate whether the established downscaling algorithm combining different satellite products to estimate medium-scale soil moisture is applicable to higher resolutions and whether results can be improved by accounting for land cover types. Original satellite data and downscaled soil moisture are compared with ground observations.\n\nA robust objective function for calibration of groundwater models in light of deficiencies of model structure and observations\n\nRaphael Schneider, Hans JÃ¸rgen Henriksen, and Simon Stisen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2019-685,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2019-685, 2020\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor groundwater models to deliver reliable results, their parameters often have to be estimated in an optimization process guided by some measure of model performance. In this context, we suggest the use of a novel performance metric, which is less prone to a fit to inadequate observations than the most frequently used metrics based on squared errors. Hence, calibration is more robust to deficiencies in model and observational data, which are common especially in larger scale models.\n\nModelling of the shallow water table at high spatial resolution using random forests\n\nJulian Koch, Helen Berger, Hans JÃ¸rgen Henriksen, and Torben Obel Sonnenborg\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4603–4619, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4603-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4603-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study explores novel modelling avenues using machine learning in combination with process-based models to predict the shallow water table at high spatial resolution. Due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts, the shallow groundwater is rising in many parts of the world. In order to adapt to risks induced by groundwater flooding, new modelling tools need to emerge. In this study, we found that machine learning is capable of reaching the required accuracy and resolution.\n\nThe SPAtial EFficiency metric (SPAEF): multiple-component evaluation of spatial patterns for optimization of hydrological models\n\nJulian Koch, Mehmet CÃ¼neyd Demirel, and Simon Stisen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 1873–1886, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1873-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1873-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur work addresses a key challenge in earth system modelling: how to optimally exploit the information contained in satellite remote sensing observations in the calibration of such models. For this we thoroughly test a number of measures that quantify the fit between an observed and a simulated spatial pattern. We acknowledge the difficulties associated with such a comparison and suggest using measures that regard multiple aspects of spatial information, i.e. magnitude and variability.\n\nCombining satellite data and appropriate objective functions for improved spatial pattern performance of a distributed hydrologic model\n\nMehmet C. Demirel, Juliane Mai, Gorka Mendiguren, Julian Koch, Luis Samaniego, and Simon Stisen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1299–1315, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1299-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1299-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite data offer great opportunities to improve spatial model predictions by means of spatially oriented model evaluations. In this study, satellite images are used to observe spatial patterns of evapotranspiration at the land surface. These spatial patterns are utilized in combination with streamflow observations in a model calibration framework including a novel spatial performance metric tailored to target the spatial pattern performance of a catchment-scale hydrological model.\n\nCalibration of a parsimonious distributed ecohydrological daily model in a data-scarce basin by exclusively using the spatio-temporal variation of NDVI\n\nGuiomar Ruiz-PÃ©rez, Julian Koch, Salvatore Manfreda, Kelly Caylor, and FÃ©lix FrancÃ©s\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 6235–6251, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6235-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6235-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlants are shaping the landscape and controlling the hydrological cycle, particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Remote sensing data appears as an appealing source of information for vegetation monitoring, in particular in areas with a limited amount of available field data. Here, we present an example of how remote sensing data can be exploited in a data-scarce basin. We propose a mathematical methodology that can be used as a springboard for future applications.\n\nSpatial pattern evaluation of a calibrated national hydrological model â a remote-sensing-based diagnostic approach\n\nGorka Mendiguren, Julian Koch, and Simon Stisen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 5987–6005, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5987-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5987-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study is focused on the spatial pattern evaluation of two models and describes the similarities and dissimilarities. It also discusses the factors that generate these patterns and proposes similar new approaches to minimize the differences. The study points towards a new approach in which the spatial component of the hydrological model is also calibrated and taken into account.\n\nApplication of CryoSat-2 altimetry data for river analysis and modelling\n\nRaphael Schneider, Peter Nygaard Godiksen, Heidi Villadsen, Henrik Madsen, and Peter Bauer-Gottwein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 751–764, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-751-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-751-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use water level observations from the CryoSat-2 satellite in combination with a river model of the Brahmaputra River, extracting satellite data over a dynamic river mask derived from Landsat imagery. The novelty of this work is the use of the CryoSat-2 water level observations, collected using a complex spatio-temporal sampling scheme, to calibrate a hydrodynamic river model. The resulting model accurately reproduces water levels, without precise knowledge of river bathymetry.\n\nInter-comparison of energy balance and hydrological models for land surface energy flux estimation over a whole river catchment\n\nR. Guzinski, H. Nieto, S. Stisen, and R. Fensholt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 2017–2036, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-2017-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-2017-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study compared evapotranspiration (ET) modelled by two remote sensing models and one hydrological model in a river catchment in Denmark. The results show that the spatial patterns of ET produced by the remote sensing models are more similar to each other than to the fluxes produced by the hydrological model. This indicates potential benefits to the hydrological modelling community from integrating spatial information derived through remote sensing methodology into the hydrological models.\n\nTechnical Note: Reducing the spin-up time of integrated surface waterâgroundwater models\n\nH. Ajami, J. P. Evans, M. F. McCabe, and S. Stisen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 18, 5169–5179, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-18-5169-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-18-5169-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new hybrid approach was developed to reduce the computational burden of the spin-up procedure by using a combination of model simulations and an empirical depth-to-water table function. Results illustrate that the hybrid approach reduced the spin-up period required for an integrated groundwater--surface water--land surface model (ParFlow.CLM) by up to 50%. The methodology is applicable to other coupled or integrated modeling frameworks when initialization from an equilibrium state is required.\n\nChallenges in conditioning a stochastic geological model of a heterogeneous glacial aquifer to a comprehensive soft data set\n\nJ. Koch, X. He, K. H. Jensen, and J. C. Refsgaard\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 18, 2907–2923, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-18-2907-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-18-2907-2014, 2014\n\nRelated subject area\n\nSubject: Catchment hydrology | Techniques and Approaches: Mathematical applications\n\nInferring heavy tails of flood distributions through hydrograph recession analysis\n\nHsing-Jui Wang, Ralf Merz, Soohyun Yang, and Stefano Basso\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4369–4384, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4369-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4369-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurately assessing heavy-tailed flood behavior with limited data records is challenging and can lead to inaccurate hazard estimates. Our research introduces a new index that uses hydrograph recession to identify heavy-tailed flood behavior, compare severity, and produce reliable results with short data records. This index overcomes the limitations of current metrics, which lack physical meaning and require long records. It thus provides valuable insight into the flood hazard of river basins.\n\nLandscape structures regulate the contrasting response of recession along rainfall amounts\n\nJun-Yi Lee, Ci-Jian Yang, Tsung-Ren Peng, Tsung-Yu Lee, and Jr-Chuan Huang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4279–4294, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4279-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4279-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreamflow recession, shaped by landscape and rainfall, is not well understood. This study examines their combined impact using data from 19 mountainous rivers. Longer, gentler hillslopes promote flow and reduce nonlinearity, while larger catchments with more rainfall show increased landscape heterogeneity. In small catchments, the exponent decreases with rainfall, indicating less landscape and runoff variation. Further research is needed to validate these findings across diverse regions.\n\nHydrological objective functions and ensemble averaging with the Wasserstein distance\n\nJared C. Magyar and Malcolm Sambridge\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 991–1010, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-991-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-991-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasuring the similarity of distributions of water is a useful tool for model calibration and assessment. We provide a new way of measuring this similarity for streamflow time series. It is derived from the concept of the amount of work required to rearrange one mass distribution into the other. We also use similar mathematical techniques for defining a type of average between water distributions.\n\nSpatial variability in Alpine reservoir regulation: deriving reservoir operations from streamflow using generalized additive models\n\nManuela Irene Brunner and Philippe Naveau\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 673–687, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-673-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-673-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReservoir regulation affects various streamflow characteristics. Still, information on when water is stored in and released from reservoirs is hardly available. We develop a statistical model to reconstruct reservoir operation signals from observed streamflow time series. By applying this approach to 74 catchments in the Alps, we find that reservoir management varies by catchment elevation and that seasonal redistribution from summer to winter is strongest in high-elevation catchments.\n\nRegional significance of historical trends and step changes in Australian streamflow\n\nGnanathikkam Emmanuel Amirthanathan, Mohammed Abdul Bari, Fitsum Markos Woldemeskel, Narendra Kumar Tuteja, and Paul Martinus Feikema\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 229–254, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-229-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-229-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used statistical tests to detect annual and seasonal streamflow trends and step changes across Australia. The Murray–Darling Basin and other rivers in the southern and north-eastern areas showed decreasing trends. Only rivers in the Timor Sea region in northern Australia showed significant increasing trends. Our results assist with infrastructure planning and management of water resources. This study was undertaken by the Bureau of Meteorology with its responsibility under the Water Act 2007.\n\nRiver flooding mechanisms and their changes in Europe revealed by explainable machine learning\n\nShijie Jiang, Emanuele Bevacqua, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6339–6359, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6339-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6339-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a novel explainable machine learning approach, we investigated the contributions of precipitation, temperature, and day length to different peak discharges, thereby uncovering three primary flooding mechanisms widespread in European catchments. The results indicate that flooding mechanisms have changed in numerous catchments over the past 70 years. The study highlights the potential of artificial intelligence in revealing complex changes in extreme events related to climate change.\n\nChanges in nonlinearity and stability of streamflow recession characteristics under climate warming in a large glaciated basin of the Tibetan Plateau\n\nJiarong Wang, Xi Chen, Man Gao, Qi Hu, and Jintao Liu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3901–3920, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3901-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3901-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe accelerated climate warming in the Tibetan Plateau after 1997 has strong consequences for hydrology, geography, and social wellbeing. In hydrology, the change in streamflow as a result of changes in dynamic water storage originating from glacier melt and permafrost thawing in a warming climate directly affects the available water resources for societies of some of the most populated nations in the world.\n\nA data-driven method for estimating the composition of end-members from stream water chemistry time series\n\nEsther Xu Fei and Ciaran Joseph Harman\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1977–1991, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1977-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1977-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater in streams is a mixture of water from many sources. It is sometimes possible to identify the chemical fingerprint of each source and track the time-varying contribution of that source to the total flow rate. But what if you do not know the chemical fingerprint of each source? Can you simultaneously identify the sources (called end-members), and separate the water into contributions from each, using only samples of water from the stream? Here we suggest a method for doing just that.\n\nEvaporation loss estimation of the river-lake continuum of arid inland river: Evidence from stable isotopes\n\nGuofeng Zhu, Zhigang Sun, Yuanxiao Xu, Yuwei Liu, Zhuanxia Zhang, Liyuan Sang, and Lei Wang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-75,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-75, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed the stable isotopic composition of surface water and estimated its evaporative loss in the Shiyang River Basin. The characteristics of stable isotopes in surface water show a gradual enrichment from mountainous areas to deserts, and the evaporation loss of surface water also shows a gradually increasing trend from upstream to downstream. The study of evaporative losses in the river-lake continuum contributes to the sustainable use of water resources.\n\nTechnical note: PMR â a proxy metric to assess hydrological model robustness in a changing climate\n\nPaul Royer-Gaspard, Vazken AndrÃ©assian, and Guillaume Thirel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 5703–5716, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5703-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5703-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost evaluation studies based on the differential split-sample test (DSST) endorse the consensus that rainfall–runoff models lack climatic robustness. In this technical note, we propose a new performance metric to evaluate model robustness without applying the DSST and which can be used with a single hydrological model calibration. Our work makes it possible to evaluate the temporal transferability of any hydrological model, including uncalibrated models, at a very low computational cost.\n\nCausal effects of dams and land cover changes on flood changes in mainland China\n\nWencong Yang, Hanbo Yang, Dawen Yang, and Aizhong Hou\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 2705–2720, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2705-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2705-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study quantified the causal effects of land cover changes and dams on the changes in annual maximum discharges (Q) in 757 catchments of China using panel regressions. We found that a 1 % point increase in urban areas causes a 3.9 % increase in Q, and a 1 unit increase in reservoir index causes a 21.4 % decrease in Q for catchments with no dam before. This study takes the first step to explain the human-caused flood changes on a national scale in China.\n\nCan the two-parameter recursive digital filter baseflow separation method really be calibrated by the conductivity mass balance method?\n\nWeifei Yang, Changlai Xiao, Zhihao Zhang, and Xiujuan Liang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1747–1760, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1747-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1747-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study analyzed the effectiveness of the conductivity mass balance (CMB) method for correcting the Eckhardt method. The results showed that the approach of calibrating the Eckhardt method against the CMB method provides a false calibration of total baseflow by offsetting the inherent biases in the baseflow sequences generated by the two methods. The reason for this phenomenon is the baseflow series generated by the two methods containing different transient water sources.\n\nSimultaneously determining global sensitivities of model parameters and model structure\n\nJuliane Mai, James R. Craig, and Bryan A. Tolson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5835–5858, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5835-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5835-2020, 2020\n\nTechnical note: Calculation scripts for ensemble hydrograph separation\n\nJames W. Kirchner and Julia L. A. Knapp\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5539–5558, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5539-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5539-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnsemble hydrograph separation is a powerful new tool for measuring the age distribution of streamwater. However, the calculations are complex and may be difficult for researchers to implement on their own. Here we present scripts that perform these calculations in either MATLAB or R so that researchers do not need to write their own codes. We explain how these scripts work and how to use them. We demonstrate several potential applications using a synthetic catchment data set.\n\nSpecific climate classification for Mediterranean hydrology and future evolution under Med-CORDEX regional climate model scenarios\n\nAntoine Allam, Roger Moussa, Wajdi Najem, and Claude Bocquillon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 4503–4521, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4503-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4503-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith serious concerns about global change rising in the Mediterranean, we established a new climatic classification to follow hydrological and ecohydrological activities. The classification coincided with a geographical distribution ranging from the most seasonal and driest class in the south to the least seasonal and most humid in the north. RCM scenarios showed that northern classes evolve to southern ones with shorter humid seasons and earlier snowmelt which might affect hydrologic regimes.\n\nA line-integral-based method to partition climate and catchment effects on runoff\n\nMingguo Zheng\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2365–2378, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2365-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2365-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper developed a mathematically precise method to partition climate and catchment effects on streamflow. The method reveals that both the change magnitude and pathway (timing of change), not the magnitude alone, dictate the partition unless for a linear system. The method has wide relevance. For example, it suggests that the global warming effect of carbon emission is path dependent, and an optimal pathway would facilitate a higher global budget of carbon emission.\n\nTechnical note: A two-sided affine power scaling relationship to represent the concentrationâdischarge relationship\n\nJosÃ© Manuel Tunqui Neira, Vazken AndrÃ©assian, GaÃ«lle Tallec, and Jean-Marie Mouchel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1823–1830, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1823-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1823-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper deals with the mathematical representation of concentration–discharge relationships. We propose a two-sided affine power scaling relationship (2S-APS) as an alternative to the classic one-sided power scaling relationship (commonly known as power law). We also discuss the identification of the parameters of the proposed relationship, using an appropriate numerical criterion, based on high-frequency chemical time series of the Orgeval-ORACLE observatory.\n\nOn the flood peak distributions over China\n\nLong Yang, Lachun Wang, Xiang Li, and Jie Gao\n\nHydrol.

A. Knapp, Colin Neal, Alessandro Schlumpf, Margaret Neal, and James W. Kirchner\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4367–4388, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4367-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4367-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe, present, and make publicly available two extensive data sets of stable water isotopes in streamwater and precipitation at Plynlimon, Wales, consisting of measurements at 7-hourly intervals for 17 months and at weekly intervals for 4.25 years. We use these data to calculate new water fractions and transit time distributions for different discharge rates and seasons, thus quantifying the contribution of recent precipitation to streamflow under different conditions.\n\nDoes the weighting of climate simulations result in a better quantification of hydrological impacts?\n\nHui-Min Wang, Jie Chen, Chong-Yu Xu, Hua Chen, Shenglian Guo, Ping Xie, and Xiangquan Li\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4033–4050, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4033-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4033-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen using large ensembles of global climate models in hydrological impact studies, there are pragmatic questions on whether it is necessary to weight climate models and how to weight them. We use eight methods to weight climate models straightforwardly, based on their performances in hydrological simulations, and investigate the influences of the assigned weights. This study concludes that using bias correction and equal weighting is likely viable and sufficient for hydrological impact studies.\n\nA 50-year analysis of hydrological trends and processes in a Mediterranean catchment\n\nNathalie Folton, Eric Martin, Patrick Arnaud, Pierre L'Hermite, and Mathieu Tolsa\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2699–2714, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2699-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2699-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe long-term study of precipitation, flows, flood or drought mechanisms, in the RÃ©al Collobrier research Watershed, located in South-East France, in the Mediterranean forest, improves knowledge of the water cycle and is unique tool for understanding of how catchments function. This study shows a small decrease in rainfall and a marked tendency towards a decrease in the water resources of the catchment in response to climate trends, with a consistent increase in drought severity and duration.\n\nTechnical Note: On the puzzling similarity of two water balance formulas â TurcâMezentsev vs.Â TixerontâFu\n\nVazken AndrÃ©assian and Tewfik Sari\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2339–2350, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2339-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2339-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this Technical Note, we present two water balance formulas: the Turc–Mezentsev and Tixeront–Fu formulas. These formulas have a puzzling numerical similarity, which we discuss in detail and try to interpret mathematically and hydrologically.\n\nClimate or land cover variations: what is driving observed changes in river peak flows?

Here I propose a new approach to this old problem. I show how we can use time series of isotope data to measure the average fraction of same-day rainfall appearing in streamflow, even if this fraction varies greatly from rainstorm to rainstorm. I show that we can quantify how this fraction changes from small rainstorms to big ones, and from high flows to low flows, and how it changes with the lag time between rainfall and streamflow.\n\nLand cover effects on hydrologic services under a precipitation gradient\n\nAne Zabaleta, Eneko Garmendia, Petr Mariel, Ibon Tamayo, and IÃ±aki AntigÃ¼edad\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 5227–5241, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5227-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5227-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study establishes relationships between land cover and river discharge. Using discharge data from 20 catchments of the Bay of Biscay findings showed the influence of land cover on discharge changes with the amount of precipitation, with lower annual water resources associated with the greater presence of forests. Results obtained illustrate the relevance of land planning to the management of water resources and the opportunity to consider it in future climate-change adaptation strategies.\n\nTechnical note: Long-term persistence loss of urban streams as a metric for catchment classification\n\nDusan Jovanovic, Tijana Jovanovic, Alfonso MejÃ­a, Jon Hathaway, and Edoardo Daly\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3551–3559, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-3551-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-3551-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA relationship between the Hurst (H) exponent (a long-term correlation coefficient) within a flow time series and various catchment characteristics for a number of catchments in the USA and Australia was investigated. A negative relationship with imperviousness was identified, which allowed for an efficient catchment classification, thus making the H exponent a useful metric to quantitatively assess the impact of catchment imperviousness on streamflow regime.\n\nResponses of runoff to historical and future climate variability over China\n\nChuanhao Wu, Bill X. Hu, Guoru Huang, Peng Wang, and Kai Xu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1971–1991, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1971-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1971-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChina has suffered some of the effects of global warming, and one of the potential implications of climate warming is the alteration of the temporal–spatial patterns of water resources. In this paper, the Budyko-based elasticity method was used to investigate the responses of runoff to historical and future climate variability over China at both grid and catchment scales. The results help to better understand the hydrological effects of climate change and adapt to a changing environment.\n\nCharacterization and evaluation of controls on post-fire streamflow response across western US watersheds\n\nSamuel Saxe, Terri S. Hogue, and Lauren Hay\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1221–1237, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1221-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1221-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the impact of wildfire on watershed flow regimes, examining responses across the western United States. On a national scale, our results confirm the work of prior studies: that low, high, and peak flows typically increase following a wildfire. Regionally, results are more variable and sometimes contradictory. Our results may be significant in justifying the calibration of watershed models and in contributing to the overall observational analysis of post-fire streamflow response.\n\nAnalysis and modelling of a 9.3â¯kyr palaeoflood record: correlations, clustering, and cycles\n\nAnnette Witt, Bruce D. Malamud, Clara Mangili, and Achim Brauer\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 5547–5581, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5547-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5547-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we present a unique 9.5 m palaeo-lacustrine record of 771 palaeofloods which occurred over a period of 10 000 years in the PiÃ nico–SÃ¨llere basin (southern Alps) during an interglacial period in the Pleistocene (sometime between 400 000 and 800 000 years ago). We analyse the palaeoflood series correlation, clustering, and cyclicity properties, finding a long-range cyclicity with a period of about 2030 years superimposed onto a fractional noise.\n\nClimate change impacts on Yangtze River discharge at the Three Gorges Dam\n\nSteve J. Birkinshaw, Selma B. Guerreiro, Alex Nicholson, Qiuhua Liang, Paul Quinn, Lili Zhang, Bin He, Junxian Yin, and Hayley J. Fowler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1911–1927, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1911-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1911-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Yangtze River basin in China is home to more than 400 million people and susceptible to major floods. We used projections of future precipitation and temperature from 35 of the most recent global climate models and applied this to a hydrological model of the Yangtze. Changes in the annual discharge varied between a 29.8 % decrease and a 16.0 % increase. The main reason for the difference between the models was the predicted expansion of the summer monsoon north and and west into the basin.\n\nCan assimilation of crowdsourced data in hydrological modelling improve flood prediction?\n\nMaurizio Mazzoleni, Martin Verlaan, Leonardo Alfonso, Martina Monego, Daniele Norbiato, Miche Ferri, and Dimitri P. Solomatine\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 839–861, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-839-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-839-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study assesses the potential use of crowdsourced data in hydrological modeling, which are characterized by irregular availability and variable accuracy. We show that even data with these characteristics can improve flood prediction if properly integrated into hydrological models. This study provides technological support to citizen observatories of water, in which citizens can play an active role in capturing information, leading to improved model forecasts and better flood management.\n\nDelineation of homogenous regions using hydrological variables predicted by projection pursuit regression\n\nMartin Durocher, Fateh Chebana, and Taha B. M. J. Ouarda\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4717–4729, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4717-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4717-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor regional flood frequency, it is challenging to identify regions with similar hydrological properties. Therefore, previous works have mainly proposed to use regions with similar physiographical properties. This research proposes instead to nonlinearly predict the desired hydrological properties before using them for delineation. The presented method is applied to a case study in QuÃ©bec, Canada, and leads to hydrologically relevant regions, while enhancing predictions made inside them.\n\nMultivariate hydrological data assimilation of soil moisture and groundwater head\n\nDonghua Zhang, Henrik Madsen, Marc E. Ridler, Jacob Kidmose, Karsten H. Jensen, and Jens C. Refsgaard\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4341–4357, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4341-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4341-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a method to assimilate observed groundwater head and soil moisture profiles into an integrated hydrological model. The study uses the ensemble transform Kalman filter method and the MIKE SHE hydrological model code. The proposed method is shown to be more robust and provide better results for two cases in Denmark, and is also validated using real data. The hydrological model with assimilation overall improved performance compared to the model without assimilation.\n\nOn the propagation of diel signals in river networks using analytic solutions of flow equations\n\nMorgan Fonley, Ricardo Mantilla, Scott J. Small, and Rodica Curtu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2899–2912, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2899-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2899-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe design and implement a theoretical experiment to show that, under low-flow conditions, observed streamflow discrepancies between early and late summer can be attributed to different flow velocities in the river network. By developing an analytic solution to represent flow along a given river network, we emphasize the dependence of streamflow amplitude and time delay on the geomorphology of the network. We also simulate using a realistic river network to highlight the effects of scale.\n\nDominant climatic factors driving annual runoff changes at the catchment scale across China\n\nZhongwei Huang, Hanbo Yang, and Dawen Yang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2573–2587, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2573-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2573-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe hydrologic processes have been influenced by different climatic factors. However, the dominant climatic factor driving annual runoff change is still unknown in many catchments in China. By using the climate elasticity method proposed by Yang and Yang (2011), the elasticity of runoff to climatic factors was estimated, and the dominant climatic factors driving annual runoff change were detected at catchment scale over China.\n\nData assimilation in integrated hydrological modelling in the presence of observation bias\n\nJÃ¸rn Rasmussen, Henrik Madsen, Karsten HÃ¸gh Jensen, and Jens Christian Refsgaard\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2103–2118, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2103-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2103-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the paper, observations are assimilated into a hydrological model in order to improve the model performance. Two methods for detecting and correcting systematic errors (bias) in groundwater head observations are used leading to improved results compared to standard assimilation methods which ignores any bias. This is demonstrated using both synthetic (user generated) observations and real-world observations.\n\nRecent changes in climate, hydrology and sediment load in the Wadi Abd, Algeria (1970–2010)\n\nMohammed Achite and Sylvain Ouillon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1355–1372, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1355-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1355-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges of T, P, Q and sediment fluxes in a semi-arid basin little affected by human activities are analyzed from 40 years of measurements. T increased, P decreased, an earlier onset of first summer rains occurred. The flow regime shifted from perennial to intermittent. Sediment flux almost doubled every decade. The sediment regime shifted from two equivalent seasons of sediment delivery to a single major season regime. The C–Q rating curve ability declined due to enhanced hysteresis effects.\n\nTechnical Note: Testing an improved index for analysing storm discharge–concentration hysteresis\n\nC. E. M. Lloyd, J. E. Freer, P. J. Johnes, and A. L. Collins\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 625–632, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-625-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-625-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper examines the current methodologies for quantifying storm behaviour through hysteresis analysis, and explores a new method. Each method is systematically tested and the impact on the results is examined. Recommendations are made regarding the most effective method of calculating a hysteresis index. This new method allows storm hysteresis behaviour to be directly compared between storms, parameters, and catchments, meaning it has wide application potential in water quality research.\n\nEstimating spatially distributed soil water content at small watershed scales based on decomposition of temporal anomaly and time stability analysis\n\nW. Hu and B. C. Si\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 571–587, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-571-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-571-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSpatiotemporal SWC was decomposed into into three terms (spatial forcing, temporal forcing, and interactions between spatial and temporal forcing) for near surface and root zone; Empirical orthogonal function indicated that underlying patterns exist in the interaction term at small watershed scales; Estimation of spatially distributed SWC benefits from decomposition of the interaction term; The suggested decomposition of SWC with time stability analysis has potential in SWC downscaling.\n\nImproving flood forecasting capability of physically based distributed hydrological models by parameter optimization\n\nY. Chen, J. Li, and H. Xu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 375–392, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-375-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-375-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nParameter optimization is necessary to improve the flood forecasting capability of physically based distributed hydrological model. A method for parameter optimization with particle swam optimization (PSO) algorithm has been proposed for physically based distributed hydrological model in catchment flood forecasting and validated in southern China. It has found that the appropriate particle number and maximum evolution number of PSO algorithm are 20 and 30 respectively.\n\nTime series analysis of the long-term hydrologic impacts of afforestation in the Ãgueda watershed of north-central Portugal\n\nD.
