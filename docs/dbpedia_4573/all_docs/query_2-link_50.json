        "meta_description": "Abstract. Parameter sensitivity analysis plays a critical role in efficiently determining main parameters, enhancing the effectiveness of the estimation of parameters and uncertainty quantification in hydrologic modeling. In this paper, we demonstrate an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis technique for the holistic Soil and Water Assessment ToolÂ (SWAT+) model coupled with new gwflow module, spatially distributed, physically based groundwater flow modeling. The main calculated groundwater inflows and outflows include boundary exchange, pumping, saturation excess flow, groundwaterâsurface water exchange, recharge, groundwaterâlake exchange and tile drainage outflow. We present the method for four watersheds located in different areas of the United States for 16 years (2000â2015), emphasizing regions of extensive tile drainage (Winnebago River, Minnesota, Iowa), intensive surfaceâgroundwater interactions (Nanticoke River, Delaware, Maryland), groundwater pumping for irrigation (Cache River, Missouri, Arkansas) and mountain snowmelt (Arkansas Headwaters, Colorado). The main parameters of the coupled SWAT+gwflow model are estimated utilizing the parameter estimation softwareÂ PEST. The monthly streamflow of holistic SWAT+gwflow is evaluated based on the NashâSutcliffe efficiency indexÂ (NSE), percentage biasÂ (PBIAS), determination coefficientÂ (R2) and KlingâGupta efficiency coefficientÂ (KGE), whereas groundwater head is evaluated using mean absolute errorÂ (MAE). The Morris method is employed to identify the key parameters influencing hydrological fluxes. Furthermore, the iterative ensemble smootherÂ (iES) is utilized as a technique for uncertainty quantificationÂ (UQ) and parameter estimationÂ (PE) and to decrease the computational cost owing to the large number of parameters. Depending on the watershed, key identified selected parameters include aquifer specific yield, aquifer hydraulic conductivity, recharge delay, streambed thickness, streambed hydraulic conductivity, area of groundwater inflow to tile, depth of tiles below ground surface, hydraulic conductivity of the drain perimeter, river depth (for groundwater flow processes), runoff curve number (for surface runoff processes), plant uptake compensation factor, soil evaporation compensation factor (for potential and actual evapotranspiration processes), soil available water capacity and percolation coefficient (for soil water processes). The presence of gwflow parameters permits the recognition of all key parameters in the surface and/or subsurface flow processes, with results substantially differing if the base SWAT+ models are utilized.",

For all wells, reasonable performance was obtained by at least 1 team from group. There was not 1 team that performed best for all wells. In conclusion, the challenge was a successful initiative to compare different models and learn from each other.\n\nModeling Climate Change Uncertainty and Its Impact on the Nemunas River Watershed and Curonian Lagoon Ecosystem\n\nNatalja Äerkasova, Jovita MÄÅ¾inÄ, Rasa IdzelytÄ, JÅ«ratÄ LesutienÄ, Ali Erturk, and Georg Umgiesser\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-890,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-890, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study advances the understanding of climate projection uncertainties in the Nemunas River, Curonian Lagoon, and southeastern Baltic Sea continuum by analyzing a subset of climate models, focusing on a coupled ocean and drainage basin model. This study investigates the variability and trends in environmental parameters such as water fluxes, timing, nutrient load, water temperature, ice cover, and saltwater intrusions under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios.\n\nAn ensemble-based approach for pumping optimization in an island aquifer considering parameter, observation and climate uncertainty\n\nCÃ©cile Coulon, Jeremy T.

We developed a modeling approach to identify the optimal tradeoff between groundwater pumping and probability of salinization, considering model parameter and historical observation uncertainty as well as uncertainty in sea level and recharge projections. The workflow can be implemented in a wide range of coastal settings.\n\nAddressing soil data needs and data-gaps in catchment scale environmental modelling: the European perspective\n\nBrigitta SzabÃ³, Piroska Kassai, Svajunas Plunge, Attila Nemes, PÃ©ter Braun, Michael Strauch, Felix Witing, JÃ¡nos MÃ©szÃ¡ros, and Natalja Äerkasova\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3104,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3104, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research introduces methods and tools for obtaining soil input data in European case studies for environmental models like SWAT+. With various available soil datasets and prediction methods, determining the most suitable is challenging. The study aims to i) catalogue open access datasets and prediction methods for Europe, ii) demonstrate and quantify differences between prediction approaches, and iii) offer a comprehensive workflow with open-source R codes for deriving missing soil data.\n\nCoupled hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling application for climate change impact assessment in the Nemunas river watershedâCuronian Lagoonâsoutheastern Baltic Sea continuum\n\nRasa IdzelytÄ, Natalja Äerkasova, Jovita MÄÅ¾inÄ, Toma DabuleviÄienÄ, ArtÅ«ras Razinkovas-Baziukas, Ali ErtÃ¼rk, and Georg Umgiesser\n\nOcean Sci., 19, 1047–1066, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-19-1047-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-19-1047-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work is focused on the impacts of climate change on a complex water flow system in the southeastern (SE) Baltic Sea, covering the Nemunas river basin and Curonian Lagoon. The results show that lagoon and sea will receive more water coming from the Nemunas. This will lead to a decreased frequency of saltwater inflow to the lagoon, and water will take less time to renew. Water temperatures in the entire lagoon and the SE Baltic Sea will increase steadily, and salinity values will decrease.\n\nTechnical note: Extending the SWAT model to transport chemicals through tile and groundwater flow\n\nHendrik Rathjens, Jens Kiesel, Michael Winchell, Jeffrey Arnold, and Robin Sur\n\nHydrol.

These transport pathways are, however, important to assess the amount of chemicals in streams. We added this capability to the model, which significantly improved the simulation. The representation of all transport pathways in the model enables watershed managers to develop robust strategies for reducing chemicals in streams.\n\nImproved representation of groundwater-dominated catchment using SWAT+gwflow and modifications to the gwflow module\n\nEstifanos Addisu Yimer, Ryan T.

The standalone model (SWAT+) resulted in unsatisfactory streamflow simulations while SWAT+gwflow produced streamflow that considerably mimics the measured river discharge. Furthermore, modifications to the gwflow module are made to account for the vital hydrological process (groundwater-soil profile interactions).\n\nComparing SWAT with SWAT-MODFLOW hydrological simulations when assessing the impacts of groundwater abstractions for irrigation and drinking water\n\nWei Liu, Seonggyu Park, Ryan T.

The SWAT-MODFLOW complex was further developed to enable the application of the Drain Package and an auto-irrigation routine. A PEST-based approach was developed to calibrate the coupled SWAT-MODFLOW. The SWAT-MODFLOW model produced more realistic results on groundwater abstraction effects on streamflow.\n\nRelated subject area\n\nSubject: Catchment hydrology | Techniques and Approaches: Modelling approaches\n\nEvolution of river regimes in the Mekong River basin over 8 decades and the role of dams in recent hydrological extremes\n\nHuy Dang and Yadu Pokhrel\n\nHydrol.

These findings could help us rethink the planning of future dams and water resource management in the MRB.\n\nSkill of seasonal flow forecasts at catchment scale: an assessment across South Korea\n\nYongshin Lee, Francesca Pianosi, Andres PeÃ±uela, and Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez\n\nHydrol.

Our findings highlight that using seasonal weather forecasts for predicting flow patterns 1 to 3 months ahead is effective, especially during dry years. This suggest that seasonal weather forecasts can be helpful in improving the management of water resources.\n\nTo what extent do flood-inducing storm events change future flood hazards?\n\nMariam Khanam, Giulia Sofia, and Emmanouil N.

Predicting post-storm geomorphic changes is challenging. Using self-organizing maps and machine learning, this study forecasts post-storm alterations in stage–discharge relationships across 3101 US stream gages. The provided framework can aid in updating hazard assessments by identifying rivers prone to change, integrating channel adjustments into flood hazard assessment.\n\nWhen ancient numerical demons meet physics-informed machine learning: adjoint-based gradients for implicit differentiable modeling\n\nYalan Song, Wouter J.

We developed an adjoint-based DM for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for hydrological modeling, reducing distorted fluxes and physical parameters from errors in models that use explicit and operation-splitting schemes. With a better numerical scheme and improved structure, the adjoint-based DM matches or surpasses long short-term memory (LSTM) performance.\n\nAssessing the impact of climate change on high return levels of peak flows in Bavaria applying the CRCM5 large ensemble\n\nFlorian Willkofer, Raul R.

Hence, this study uses data from a regional climate model, SMILE, to drive a high-resolution hydrological model for 98 catchments of hydrological Bavaria and exploits the large database to derive robust values for the 100-year flood events. Results indicate an increase in frequency and intensity for most catchments in the future.\n\nImpacts of climate and land surface change on catchment evapotranspiration and runoff from 1951 to 2020 in Saxony, Germany\n\nMaik Renner and Corina Hauffe\n\nHydrol.

Their impact is quantified for 71 catchments in Saxony. Germany. Distinct signatures in the joint water and energy budgets are found: (i) past forest dieback caused a decrease in and subsequent recovery of evapotranspiration in the affected regions, and (ii) the recent shift towards higher aridity imposed a large decline in runoff that has not been seen in the observation records before.\n\nQuantifying and reducing flood forecast uncertainty by the CHUP-BMA method\n\nZhen Cui, Shenglian Guo, Hua Chen, Dedi Liu, Yanlai Zhou, and Chong-Yu Xu\n\nHydrol.

This study couples the copula-based hydrologic uncertainty processor (CHUP) with Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and proposes the novel CHUP-BMA method of reducing inflow forecasting uncertainty of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The CHUP-BMA avoids the normal distribution assumption in the HUP-BMA and considers the constraint of initial conditions, which can improve the deterministic and probabilistic forecast performance.\n\nDeveloping a tile drainage module for the Cold Regions Hydrological Model: lessons from a farm in southern Ontario, Canada\n\nMazda Kompanizare, Diogo Costa, Merrin L.

Tile flow and water levels are simulated by considering the effect of capillary fringe thickness, drainable water and seasonal regional groundwater dynamics. The model was applied to a small well-instrumented farm in southern Ontario, Canada, where there are concerns about the impacts of agricultural drainage into Lake Erie.\n\nTo bucket or not to bucket?

One hybrid approach is the dynamic parameterization of conceptual models using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. We explored this method to evaluate the effect of the flexibility given by LSTMs on the process-based part.\n\nWidespread flooding dynamics under climate change: characterising floods using grid-based hydrological modelling and regional climate projections\n\nAdam Griffin, Alison L.

To look at how widespread flooding changes in the future, climate model data (UKCP18) were used with a hydrological model (Grid-to-Grid) across the UK, and 14 400 events were identified between two time slices: 1980–2010 and 2050–2080. There was a strong increase in the number of winter events in the future time slice and in the peak return periods.\n\nHESS Opinions: The sword of Damocles of the impossible flood\n\nAlberto Montanari, Bruno Merz, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol.

We discuss four reasons why extremely large floods carry a risk that is often larger than expected. We provide suggestions for managing the risk of megafloods by calling for a creative exploration of hazard scenarios and communicating the unknown corners of the reality of floods.\n\nMetamorphic testing of machine learning and conceptual hydrologic models\n\nPeter Reichert, Kai Ma, Marvin HÃ¶ge, Fabrizio Fenicia, Marco Baity-Jesi, Dapeng Feng, and Chaopeng Shen\n\nHydrol.

We found that machine learning models, despite providing excellent fit and prediction capabilities, can be unreliable regarding the prediction of the effect of temperature change for low-elevation catchments. This indicates the need for caution when applying them for the prediction of the effect of climate change.\n\nThe influence of human activities on streamflow reductions during the megadrought in central Chile\n\nNicolÃ¡s Ãlamos, Camila Alvarez-Garreton, Ariel MuÃ±oz, and Ãlvaro GonzÃ¡lez-Reyes\n\nHydrol.

We address this by contrasting streamflow observations with near-natural streamflow simulations. We conclude that while the lack of precipitation dominates streamflow reductions in the megadrought, water uses have not diminished during this time, causing a worsening of the hydrological drought conditions and maladaptation conditions.\n\nElevational control of isotopic composition and application in understanding hydrologic processes in the mid Merced River catchment, Sierra Nevada, California, USA\n\nFengjing Liu, Martha H. Conklin, and Glenn D. Shaw\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Using stable isotopes, we found flows and flow duration in Yosemite Creek are most sensitive to climate warming due to strong evaporation of waterfalls, potentially lengthening the dry-up period of waterfalls in summer and negatively affecting tourism. Groundwater recharge in Yosemite Valley is primarily from the upper snow–rain transition (2000–2500 m) and very vulnerable to a reduction in the snow–rain ratio.\n\nEnhancing long short-term memory (LSTM)-based streamflow prediction with a spatially distributed approach\n\nQiutong Yu, Bryan A.

This work presents a novel hybrid modelling approach to predict streamflow while accounting for spatial variability. We evaluated the performance against lumped LSTM predictions in 224 basins across the Great Lakes region in North America. This approach shows promise for predicting streamflow in large, ungauged basin.\n\nBroadleaf afforestation impacts on terrestrial hydrology insignificant compared to climate change in Great Britain\n\nMarcus Buechel, Louise Slater, and Simon Dadson\n\nHydrol.

In this study, we use a land surface model to simulate hydrology across Great Britain with realistic afforestation scenarios and potential climate changes. Countrywide afforestation minimally influences hydrology, when compared to climate change, and reduces low streamflow whilst not lowering the highest flows.\n\nImpacts of spatiotemporal resolutions of precipitation on flood event simulation based on multimodel structures â a case study over the Xiang River basin in China\n\nQian Zhu, Xiaodong Qin, Dongyang Zhou, Tiantian Yang, and Xinyi Song\n\nHydrol.

Satellite-based precipitation with different spatiotemporal resolutions is an important input source. Data-driven models are sometimes proven to be more accurate than hydrological models. Event-based calibration and conventional strategy are two options adopted for flood simulation. This study targets the three concerns for accurate flood event simulation and prediction.\n\nA network approach for multiscale catchment classification using traits\n\nFabio Ciulla and Charuleka Varadharajan\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We find that our trait-based approach produces catchment classes with distinct streamflow behavior and that spatial patterns emerge amongst pristine and human-impacted catchments. This method can be widely used beyond hydrology to identify patterns, reduce trait redundancy, and select representative sites.\n\nMulti-model approach in a variable spatial framework for streamflow simulation\n\nCyril ThÃ©bault, Charles Perrin, Vazken AndrÃ©assian, Guillaume Thirel, SÃ©bastien Legrand, and Olivier Delaigue\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1539–1566, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1539-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1539-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreamflow forecasting is useful for many applications, ranging from population safety (e.g. floods) to water resource management (e.g. agriculture or hydropower). To this end, hydrological models must be optimized. However, a model is inherently wrong. This study aims to analyse the contribution of a multi-model approach within a variable spatial framework to improve streamflow simulations. The underlying idea is to take advantage of the strength of each modelling framework tested.\n\nAdvancing understanding of lakeâwatershed hydrology: a fully coupled numerical model illustrated by Qinghai Lake\n\nLele Shu, Xiaodong Li, Yan Chang, Xianhong Meng, Hao Chen, Yuan Qi, Hongwei Wang, Zhaoguo Li, and Shihua Lyu\n\nHydrol.

Our model improves upon previous methods by accurately capturing the complexity of water movement, both on the surface and subsurface. Our model, tested using data from China's Qinghai Lake, accurately replicates complex water movements and identifies contributing factors of the lake's water balance. The findings provide a robust tool for predicting hydrological processes, aiding water resource planning.\n\nHESS Opinions: A few camels or a whole caravan?\n\nFranziska Maria Clerc-Schwarzenbach, Giovanni Selleri, Mattia Neri, Elena Toth, Ilja van Meerveld, and Jan Seibert\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-864,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-864, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare the catchment forcing data provided in large-sample datasets, namely the Caravan dataset and three of the original CAMELS datasets (US, BR, GB). We show that the differences affect hydrological model performance and that the data quality in the Caravan dataset is lower than the one in the CAMELS datasets, both for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. We want to raise awareness of the lower data quality in Caravan and we suggest possible improvements for the Caravan dataset.\n\nTechnical note: Testing the connection between hillslope-scale runoff fluctuations and streamflow hydrographs at the outlet of large river basins\n\nRicardo Mantilla, Morgan Fonley, and NicolÃ¡s VelÃ¡squez\n\nHydrol.

In this work, we show that matching streamflow observations at the outlet of a large basin is not a reliable indicator of a correct description of the small-scale runoff processes.\n\nEmpirical stream thermal sensitivity cluster on the landscape according to geology and climate\n\nLillian M. McGill, E. Ashley Steel, and Aimee H. Fullerton\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We used classification and regression approaches to show that the sensitivity of river temperature to air temperature is variable across basins and controlled largely by geology and snowmelt. Findings can be used to inform strategies for river basin restoration and conservation, such as identifying climate-insensitive areas of the basin that should be preserved and protected.\n\nDeep learning for monthly rainfallârunoff modelling: a large-sample comparison with conceptual models across Australia\n\nStephanie R. Clark, Julien Lerat, Jean-Michel Perraud, and Peter Fitch\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

It is found that the deep learning models match or outperform the traditional models in over two-thirds of the river catchments, indicating feasibility in a wide variety of conditions.\n\nComment on “Are soils overrated in hydrology?” by Gao et al. (2023)\n\nYing Zhao, Mehdi Rahmati, Harry Vereecken, and Dani Or\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-629,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-629, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGao et al. (2023) question the importance of soil in hydrology, sparking debate. We acknowledge some valid points but critique their broad, unsubstantiated views on soil's role. Our response highlights three key areas: (1) the false divide between ecosystem-centric and soil-centric approaches, (2) the vital yet varied impact of soil properties, and (3) the call for a scale-aware framework. We aim to unify these perspectives, enhancing hydrology's comprehensive understanding.\n\nOn optimization of calibrations of a distributed hydrological model with spatially distributed information on snow\n\nDipti Tiwari, MÃ©lanie Trudel, and Robert Leconte\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1127–1146, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1127-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1127-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalibrating hydrological models with multi-objective functions enhances model robustness. By using spatially distributed snow information in the calibration, the model performance can be enhanced without compromising the outputs. In this study the HYDROTEL model was calibrated in seven different experiments, incorporating the SPAEF (spatial efficiency) metric alongside Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE), with the aim of identifying the optimal calibration strategy.\n\nMulti-decadal fluctuations in root zone storage capacity through vegetation adaptation to hydro-climatic variability has minor effects on the hydrological response in the Neckar basin, Germany\n\nSiyuan Wang, Markus Hrachowitz, and Gerrit Schoups\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-62,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-62, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRoot zone storage capacity (Sumax) significantly changes over multiple decades reflecting vegetation adaptation to climatic variability. However, this temporal evolution of Sumax cannot explain long-term fluctuations in the partitioning of water fluxes as expressed by deviations ΔIE from the parametric Budyko curve over time with different climatic conditions and it does not have any significant effects on shorter-term hydrological response characteristics of the upper Neckar catchment.\n\nToward interpretable LSTM-based modeling of hydrological systems\n\nLuis Andres De la Fuente, Mohammad Reza Ehsani, Hoshin Vijai Gupta, and Laura Elizabeth Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 945–971, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) is a widely used machine-learning model in hydrology, but it is difficult to extract knowledge from it. We propose HydroLSTM, which represents processes like a hydrological reservoir. Models based on HydroLSTM perform similarly to LSTM while requiring fewer cell states. The learned parameters are informative about the dominant hydrology of a catchment. Our results show how parsimony and hydrological knowledge extraction can be achieved by using the new structure.\n\nFlow intermittence prediction using a hybrid hydrological modelling approach: influence of observed intermittence data on the training of a random forest model\n\nLouise Mimeau, Annika KÃ¼nne, Flora Branger, Sven Kralisch, Alexandre Devers, and Jean-Philippe Vidal\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 851–871, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-851-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-851-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModelling flow intermittence is essential for predicting the future evolution of drying in river networks and better understanding the ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, modelling flow intermittence is challenging, and observed data on temporary rivers are scarce. This study presents a new modelling approach for predicting flow intermittence in river networks and shows that combining different sources of observed data reduces the model uncertainty.\n\nWhat controls the tail behaviour of flood series: rainfall or runoff generation?\n\nElena Macdonald, Bruno Merz, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Viet Dung Nguyen, Xiaoxiang Guan, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 833–850, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some rivers, the occurrence of extreme flood events is more likely than in other rivers – they have heavy-tailed distributions. We find that threshold processes in the runoff generation lead to such a relatively high occurrence probability of extremes. Further, we find that beyond a certain return period, i.e. for rare events, rainfall is often the dominant control compared to runoff generation. Our results can help to improve the estimation of the occurrence probability of extreme floods.\n\nSeasonal prediction of end-of-dry-season watershed behavior in a highly interconnected alluvial watershed in northern California\n\nClaire Kouba and Thomas Harter\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 691–718, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-691-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-691-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some watersheds, the severity of the dry season has a large impact on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we design a way to predict, 5–6 months in advance, how severe the dry season will be in a rural watershed in northern California. This early warning can support seasonal adaptive management. To predict these two values, we assess data about snow, rain, groundwater, and river flows. We find that maximum snowpack and total wet season rainfall best predict dry season severity.\n\nGlaciers determine the sensitivity of hydrological processes to perturbed climate in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau\n\nYi Nan and Fuqiang Tian\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 669–689, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-669-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-669-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper utilized a tracer-aided model validated by multiple datasets in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau to analyze hydrological sensitivity to climate change. The spatial pattern of the local hydrological sensitivities and the influence factors were analyzed in particular. The main finding of this paper is that the local hydrological sensitivity in mountainous basins is determined by the relationship between the glacier area ratio and the mean annual precipitation.\n\nLeveraging gauge networks and strategic discharge measurements to aid the development of continuous streamflow records\n\nMichael J. Vlah, Matthew R. V. Ross, Spencer Rhea, and Emily S. Bernhardt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 545–573, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-545-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-545-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVirtual stream gauging enables continuous streamflow estimation where a gauge might be difficult or impractical to install. We reconstructed flow at 27 gauges of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), informing ~199 site-months of missing data in the official record and improving that accuracy of official estimates at 11 sites. This study shows that machine learning, but also routine regression methods, can be used to supplement existing gauge networks and reduce monitoring costs.\n\nOn the need for physical constraints in deep learning rainfallârunoff projections under climate change: a sensitivity analysis to warming and shifts in potential evapotranspiration\n\nSungwook Wi and Scott Steinschneider\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 479–503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-479-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-479-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate whether deep learning (DL) models can produce physically plausible streamflow projections under climate change. We address this question by focusing on modeled responses to increases in temperature and potential evapotranspiration and by employing three DL and three process-based hydrological models. The results suggest that physical constraints regarding model architecture and input are necessary to promote the physical realism of DL hydrological projections under climate change.\n\nEvaluation of hydrological models on small mountainous catchments: impact of the meteorological forcings\n\nGuillaume Evin, Matthieu Le Lay, Catherine Fouchier, David Penot, Francois Colleoni, Alexandre Mas, Pierre-AndrÃ© Garambois, and Olivier Laurantin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 261–281, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological modelling of mountainous catchments is challenging for many reasons, the main one being the temporal and spatial representation of precipitation forcings. This study presents an evaluation of the hydrological modelling of 55 small mountainous catchments of the northern French Alps, focusing on the influence of the type of precipitation reanalyses used as inputs. These evaluations emphasize the added value of radar measurements, in particular for the reproduction of flood events.\n\nHESS Opinions: Never train an LSTM on a single basin\n\nFrederik Kratzert, Martin Gauch, Daniel Klotz, and Grey Nearing\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-275,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-275, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecently, a special type of neural network architecture became increasingly popular in hydrology literature. However, in most applications, this model was applied as a one-to-one replacement for hydrology models without adapting or rethinking the experimental setup. In this opinion paper, we show how this is almost always a bad decision and how using these kinds of models require the use of large-sample hydrology datasets.\n\nProjecting sediment export from two highly glacierized alpine catchments under climate change: exploring non-parametric regression as an analysis tool\n\nLena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, and Axel Bronstert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 139–161, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow suspended sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas responds to future climate change is hardly assessable as many interacting processes are involved, and appropriate physical models are lacking. We present the first study, to our knowledge, exploring machine learning to project sediment export until 2100 in two high-alpine catchments. We find that uncertainties due to methodological limitations are small until 2070. Negative trends imply that peak sediment may have already passed.\n\nSimulation-Based Inference for Parameter Estimation of Complex Watershed Simulators\n\nRobert Hull, Elena Leonarduzzi, Luis De La Fuente, Hoang Viet Tran, Andrew Bennett, Peter Melchior, Reed M. Maxwell, and Laura E. Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-264,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-264, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge-scale hydrologic a needed tool to explore complex watershed processes and how they may evolve under a changing climate. However, calibrating them can be difficult because they are costly to run and have many unknown parameters. We implement a state-of-the-art approach to model calibration with a set of experiments in the Upper Colorado River Basin.\n\nOn understanding mountainous carbonate basins of the Mediterranean using parsimonious modeling solutions\n\nShima Azimi, Christian Massari, Giuseppe Formetta, Silvia Barbetta, Alberto Tazioli, Davide Fronzi, Sara Modanesi, Angelica Tarpanelli, and Riccardo Rigon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4485–4503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4485-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4485-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed the water budget of nested karst catchments using simple methods and modeling. By utilizing the available data on precipitation and discharge, we were able to determine the response lag-time by adopting new techniques. Additionally, we modeled snow cover dynamics and evapotranspiration with the use of Earth observations, providing a concise overview of the water budget for the basin and its subbasins. We have made the data, models, and workflows accessible for further study.\n\nComparing quantile regression forest and mixture density long short-term memory models for probabilistic post-processing of satellite precipitation-driven streamflow simulations\n\nYuhang Zhang, Aizhong Ye, Bita Analui, Phu Nguyen, Soroosh Sorooshian, Kuolin Hsu, and Yuxuan Wang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4529–4550, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study shows that while the quantile regression forest (QRF) and countable mixtures of asymmetric Laplacians long short-term memory (CMAL-LSTM) models demonstrate similar proficiency in multipoint probabilistic predictions, QRF excels in smaller watersheds and CMAL-LSTM in larger ones. CMAL-LSTM performs better in single-point deterministic predictions, whereas QRF model is more efficient overall.\n\nProjected future changes in cryosphere and hydrology of a mountainous catchment in the Upper Heihe River, China\n\nZehua Chang, Hongkai Gao, Leilei Yong, Kang Wang, Rensheng Chen, Chuntan Han, Otgonbayar Demberel, Batsuren Dorjsuren, Shugui Hou, and Zheng Duan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3043,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3043, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn integrated cryospheric-hydrologic model, FLEX-Cryo, was developed, considered glaciers, snow cover, frozen soil, and their dynamic impacts on hydrology. We utilized the model to simulate the future changes in cryosphere and hydrology in Hulu catchment. Our projections showed that the two glaciers will melt out around 2050; snow cover will reduce; and permafrost will degrade. For hydrology, runoff will decrease after glacier melt out; and permafrost degradation will increase baseflow.\n\nRecent ground thermo-hydrological changes in a southern Tibetan endorheic catchment and implications for lake level changes\n\nLÃ©o C. P. Martin, Sebastian Westermann, Michele Magni, Fanny Brun, Joel Fiddes, Yanbin Lei, Philip Kraaijenbrink, Tamara Mathys, Moritz Langer, Simon Allen, and Walter W. Immerzeel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4409–4436, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAcross the Tibetan Plateau, many large lakes have been changing level during the last decades as a response to climate change. In high-mountain environments, water fluxes from the land to the lakes are linked to the ground temperature of the land and to the energy fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, which are modified by climate change. With a numerical model, we test how these water and energy fluxes have changed over the last decades and how they influence the lake level variations.\n\nTowards robust seasonal streamflow forecasts in mountainous catchments: impact of calibration metric selection in hydrological modeling\n\nDiego Araya, Pablo A. Mendoza, Eduardo MuÃ±oz-Castro, and James McPhee\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4385–4408, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDynamical systems are used by many agencies worldwide to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts, which are critical for decision-making. Such systems rely on hydrology models, which contain parameters that are typically estimated using a target performance metric (i.e., objective function). This study explores the effects of this decision across mountainous basins in Chile, illustrating tradeoffs between seasonal forecast quality and the models' capability to simulate streamflow characteristics.\n\nModelling flood frequency and magnitude in a glacially conditioned, heterogeneous landscape: testing the importance of land cover and land use\n\nPamela E. Tetford and Joseph R. Desloges\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3977–3998, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn efficient regional flood frequency model relates drainage area to discharge, with a major assumption of similar basin conditions. In a landscape with variable glacial deposits and land use, we characterize varying hydrological function using 28 explanatory variables. We demonstrate that (1) a heterogeneous landscape requires objective model selection criteria to optimize the fit of flow data, and (2) incorporating land use as a predictor variable improves the drainage area to discharge model.\n\nDirect integration of reservoirs' operations in a hydrological model for streamflow estimation: coupling a CLSTM model with MOHID-Land\n\nAna Ramos Oliveira, Tiago Brito Ramos, LÃ­gia Pinto, and Ramiro Neves\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3875–3893, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper intends to demonstrate the adequacy of a hybrid solution to overcome the difficulties related to the incorporation of human behavior when modeling hydrological processes. Two models were implemented, one to estimate the outflow of a reservoir and the other to simulate the hydrological processes of the watershed. With both models feeding each other, results show that the proposed approach significantly improved the streamflow estimation downstream of the reservoir.\n\nModelling the regional sensitivity of snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow generation to climate over the Canadian Prairies using a basin classification approach\n\nZhihua He, Kevin Shook, Christopher Spence, John W. Pomeroy, and Colin Whitfield\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3525–3546, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study evaluated the impacts of climate change on snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow over the Canadian Prairies. The entire prairie region was divided into seven basin types. We found strong variations of hydrological sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes in different land covers and basins, which suggests that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the prairies.\n\nTo what extent does river routing matter in hydrological modeling?\n\nNicolÃ¡s CortÃ©s-Salazar, NicolÃ¡s VÃ¡squez, Naoki Mizukami, Pablo A. Mendoza, and Ximena Vargas\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3505–3524, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3505-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3505-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper shows how important river models can be for water resource applications that involve hydrological models and, in particular, parameter calibration. To this end, we conduct numerical experiments in a pilot basin using a combination of hydrologic model simulations obtained from a large sample of parameter sets and different routing methods. We find that routing can affect streamflow simulations, even at monthly time steps; the choice of parameters; and relevant streamflow metrics.\n\nCalibrating macroscale hydrological models in poorly gauged and heavily regulated basins\n\nDung Trung Vu, Thanh Duc Dang, Francesca Pianosi, and Stefano Galelli\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3485–3504, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3485-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3485-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe calibration of hydrological models over extensive spatial domains is often challenged by the lack of data on river discharge and the operations of hydraulic infrastructures. Here, we use satellite data to address the lack of data that could unintentionally bias the calibration process. Our study is underpinned by a computational framework that quantifies this bias and provides a safe approach to the calibration of models in poorly gauged and heavily regulated basins.\n\nAn advanced tool integrating failure and sensitivity analysis into novel modeling of the stormwater flood volume\n\nFrancesco Fatone, Bartosz SzelÄ g, PrzemysÅaw Kowal, Arthur McGarity, Adam Kiczko, Grzegorz WaÅek, Ewa Wojciechowska, MichaÅ Stachura, and Nicolas Caradot\n\nHydrol.

The applied tool enables the analysis of the influence of spatial variability in catchment and stormwater network characteristics on the relation between (SWMM) model parameters and specific flood volume, as an alternative approach to mechanistic models. The proposed method can be used at the stage of catchment model development and spatial planning management.\n\nairGRteaching: an open-source tool for teaching hydrological modeling withÂ R\n\nOlivier Delaigue, Pierre Brigode, Guillaume Thirel, and Laurent Coron\n\nHydrol.

It requires appropriate tools and teaching material. In this article, we present the airGRteaching package, which is an open-source software tool relying on widely used hydrological models. This tool proposes an interface and numerous hydrological modeling exercises representing a wide range of hydrological applications. We show how this tool can be applied to simple but real-life cases.\n\nCited articles\n\nAbbas, S., Xuan, Y., and Bailey, R.: Assessing Climate Change Impact on Water Resources in Water Demand Scenarios Using SWAT-MODFLOW-WEAP, Hydrology, 9, 164, https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology9100164, 2022.â\n\nArnold, J., Srinivasan, R., Muttiah, R., and Williams, J.: Large area hydrologic modeling and assessment partÂ I: Model development, J.
