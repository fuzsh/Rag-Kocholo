        "text": "This paper calls for the inclusion of Jewish theology as a discipline with the study of the movement on Wissenschaft des Judentums. The sources speak a clear language: considering that many of the important protagonists of the Wissenschaft movement were at the same time community rabbis, theology might be seen as the connecting link between the two occupations – a scientific, critical approach to Jewish theology made it possible for those rabbis to transfer the modern ideal of scientificity (Wissenschaftlichkeit) from their research on to their daily professional practice. But also for an all-embracing understanding and evaluation of today’s scholarship on the Wissenschaft-movement itself, the inclusion of theology seems to be reasonable: On the one hand it helps to clear up the persistent misunderstanding according to which during the nineteenth century history became “the religion of the fallen Jews”, meaning that turning to Wissenschaft was in itself a secularization process. The study of the pursuit of a historical-critical theology would demonstrate that this view is based on the confusion of the theological notion of ‘religion’ with myth and supernaturalism. On the other hand, the inclusion of theology in the study of Wissenschaft des Judentums seems to prove convincingly that this movement was not taking living Judaism down to its grave – but was in fact very interested in providing Judaism with a stable intellectual basis for a glorious future for conquering the whole spiritual world."
