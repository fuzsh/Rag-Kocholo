        "text": "Introduction\n\nOld Yiddish literature—the works created and written in the vernacular Jewish language parallel to Aramaic, Hebrew, and the non-Jewish languages from the Middle Ages to the Haskalah in the Ashkenazi world—was for a long time locked up in a complex network of prejudice and a priori associations, or the texts were simply unknown or neglected. A few philological, cultural studies were written, often with an anti-Jewish perspective, during the Renaissance period by Christian Hebraists, theologians, and humanists. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, some scholars from the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement started to take an interest in Old Yiddish literature, but “popular Jewish literature” was defined as the expression of an obsolete society. In the beginning of the twentieth century, in connection with the national movements, and the recognition of Yiddish as a language of culture, Old Yiddish texts were brought to light and studied as an essential part of Jewish tradition, not as a dead, passéist culture but as a living expression of the Jewish life. Since that period, many texts were rediscovered and many critical editions were published. Old Yiddish literature is now recognized as a field of Jewish studies, essential to the understanding of traditional Ashkenazic culture and its shift to modernity. To be fully understood, the texts must be integrated into a broad historical and cultural context, in relation to the complex totality of Jewish culture, and must be linked with other constituent elements of European Judaism. If one considers the complexity of the Yiddish compositions with their dynamic relations to Aramaic and Hebrew culture and other coterritorial, non-Jewish cultures, the longevity of this literature, which appeared in the Middle Ages and which has endured up to our own day, and the vast geographical area where Yiddish was spoken, then one begins to comprehend the difficulties involved in delimiting this field, which both transcends the partitions of its constituent disciplines and their divisions into cultural domains and crosses into numerous fields of inquiry. Old Yiddish literature appears as a transnational, pluri- or transdisciplinary field of studies that requires connection to many domains of research. For this reason, Old Yiddish studies could be either relegated to the margins of many disciplines or, on the contrary, considered as an original contribution to many fields, such as history, linguistics, literature, religious studies, cultural and social anthropology, and folklore. Due to more than a century of research, Old Yiddish literature is now considered to be an important testimony regarding many issues central to Jewish society, Ashkenazi culture, and European languages and literature.\n\nGeneral Overviews\n\nWith the exception of texts written in the sixteenth century, mostly by Christian Hebraists, humanists, and theologians, the scholarly study of Old Yiddish literature began in the end of the nineteenth century among scholars of the Wissenschaft des Judentums (“Science of Judaism”) movement, who started, in spite of their despising and disdain for “popular Jewish literature,” for the “culture of the ghetto” and of “dark ages,” to write bibliographies, catalogues of libraries, and peripheral studies of Old Yiddish texts (Zunz, Steinschneider). Ber Borochov (see Borochov 1966), a defender of the diaspora culture who struggled for the recognition and legitimization of the culture of the Jewish masses, could be considered as one of the founders of the field. For the first time he collected sources, wrote bibliographies, and studied Old Yiddish literature, not as a minor component of the Jewish tradition but as a rich heritage of the Jewish people. Inspired by the same ideological trends, the first histories of Old Yiddish literature were written (Erik 1979, Weinreich 1928, Zinberg 1972–1978). In spite of the paucity of the material, the conception of the quasi-insularity of Yiddish culture; the lack of broad perspective, especially concerning the relation among Hebrew, Jewish vernacular, and non-Jewish sources; and the role of Yiddish in multilingual Jewish society, these histories could be considered as laying the foundation for this field of study. Contemporary scholars, even if they follow the historical and philological method of the former generation, place emphasis on new perspectives of research. If some authors put emphasis on the “secular” creations or the “profane” Jewish culture, other scholars focused on the relation between traditional rabbinic literature and Old Yiddish texts. A new generation of researchers is redefining the field and is transmitting different approaches to Old Yiddish literature, based on new methodological, theoretical, historical, and cultural perspectives. They analyze Old Yiddish literature in a broader religious, cultural, historical, and linguistic context, as part of a complex polysystem connected to Hebrew literature and coterritorial culture (Shmeruk 1978). They also study how the texts were written, printed, diffused, and read, demonstrating the role of the secondary Jewish intelligentsia in the translation, adaptation, and rewriting of many canonical Jewish texts, as well as in the creation and diffusion of popular books (Baumgarten 2005, Baumgarten 2018). Many important manuscripts and early printed editions have been (re)discovered and studied, showing the richness and complexity of Old Yiddish literature. This field is now studied in many universities and institutions, showing the recognition and acceptance of Old Yiddish studies as an integral part of Jewish studies.\n\nBaumgarten, Jean.
