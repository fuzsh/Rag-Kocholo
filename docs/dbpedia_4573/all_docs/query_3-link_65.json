COUNTRIES\n\nBY THE RESEARCH STAFF OF THE\n\nCOMMISSION ON EUROPEAN JEWISH CULTURAL RECONSTRUCTION\n\nIntroductory Statement\n\nAfter preliminary negotiations extending over a number of years the Conference on Jewish Relations took the initiative in setting up a commission of leading Jewish scholars and educators in America to investigate the manifold, complex problems of the cultural reconstruction of European Jewry after the devastation of the Second World War. In the spring of 1945 this Commission secured the active collaboration of the Cultural Committee of the Joint Distribution Committee and of the American Association for Jewish Education. More recently it obtained a grant from the American Jewish Committee. Representatives of many other national Jewish organizations have likewise become actively associated with its work.\n\nIt is planned to have the Commission serve as the central research and co-ordinating body for all American activities in the field of European Jewish cultural reconstruction and work in close co-operation with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the Committee on Restoration of Continental Jewish Museums, Libraries and Archives of the Jewish Historical Society in England and other national and international organizations. According to its original \"Terms of Reference\" it proposes to accomplish the following purposes :\n\n1. To constitute, together with similar bodies, an Advisory Council to the United Nations in the restoration and/or reconstruction of the cultural aspects of European Jewish life and in the rehabilitation or redistribution of such Jewish cultural institutions (libraries, museums, schools, archives, etc.) as have been destroyed or confiscated.\n\n[p. 6]\n\n2. To serve, in collaboration with governmental or intergovernmental agencies, as a board of Trustees to take charge of and administer Jewish cultural institutions and properties formerly owned by communities now dispersed or by agencies now liquidated.\n\n3. To serve as assessors in the presentation of claims for indemnities in respect of Jewish cultural properties.\n\n4. To prepare plans for the redistribution and re-allocation of Jewish cultural material, where desirable.\n\n5. To assist in the reconstitution of the Jewish school system and in the re-establishment of centers of Jewish higher education (seminaries, university courses, etc.)\n\n6. To serve as an advisory body to see that Jewish needs and interests are properly represented in any more comprehensive educational programs that the United Nations may introduce into former Axis or Axis-occupied countries.\n\n7. To supervise the presentation of material relating to Jews in any educational programs (textbooks, college curricula, etc.) which the United Nations may introduce into former Axis or Axis-occupied countries.\n\n8. To undertake or assist in the training of personnel for Jewish cultural reconstruction in Europe.\n\n9. To take such other measures as may be deemed desirable for the advancement of European Jewish cultural life in the postwar period.\n\nThe term \"cultural reconstruction\" is not to be interpreted in any too narrow a sense. The work of the Commission will of necessity impinge upon the wider fields of communal reconstruction. The Commission wishes to concentrate its attention, however, upon such institutions as libraries, museums and archives and upon all phases of Jewish education. In view of the wholesale destruction of Jewish life and property by the Nazis reconstruction of Jewish cultural institutions cannot possibly mean mechanical restoration in their original form or, in all cases, to their previous location. The Commission intends, in collaboration with other agencies of good will, to devise if necessary some new forms better accommodated to the emergent patterns of postwar Europe. Ultimately it may also seek to help redistribute the Jewish cultural treasures in accordance with the new needs created by the new situation of world Jewry.\n\nWhile never losing sight of these ultimate major aims, the Commission has decided to concentrate first upon certain immediate tasks of research so as to ascertain the necessary basic facts for its own guidance\n\n[p. 7]\n\nand for that of other Jewish and non-Jewish organizations. The lack of readily available, reliable data concerning Jewish cultural treasures in the European countries before they were overrun by the Nazis has long been felt as a serious obstacle to intelligent action. Certainly only such data, supported by documentary evidence, may enable the agencies of the United Nations and Jewish communal leadership to identify and to ascertain the present location of those treasures which had been looted by the Nazis and to evaluate the complex problems of restoration and reparation. By maintaining direct contact with several hundred former rabbis, educators, social workers and communal leaders of the formerly Axis-occupied countries who now reside in the United States and by securing whatever information could thus far be obtained from Jewish army chaplains, press correspondents, the personnel of the Joint Distribution Committee and others now active in the European countries, the staff of the Commission has been able to accumulate a considerable body of valuable materials concerning both the former and the present status of these cultural treasures. Information on the present state of these treasures, however, is as yet insufficient to warrant publication.\n\nEven in submitting to the public the following List of these cultural treasures known to have existed before the Nazi occupation, the Commission fully realizes its tentative nature. There undoubtedly are many serious omissions and despite all genuine attempts at avoiding them, some inaccuracies in detail. But it is felt that the publication of such a list may in itself serve as a vehicle for implementing the information on both the conditions before the war and the present state of affairs. It is hoped that additions and corrections of this List will be forthcoming from readers here and abroad and incorporated in a supplement to be published before very long.\n\nThe List includes only movable treasures, such as books, documents or museum pieces. Such important antiquities as synagogues and cemeteries, though indubitably among the most characteristic Jewish communal and cultural institutions in all ages, have not been listed, for their location and present fate are easily ascertainable on the spot. Much information on these institutions, however, has been gathered by the staff of the Commission and will soon be made available to interested agencies.\n\nThis List has originated from a brief compilation prepared by the\n\n[p. 8]\n\nStaff of the Hebrew University. The Research Fellows of the Commission, Dr. Hannah Arendt (in charge of the entire project and especially of the West-European areas), Dr. Adolf Kober (Central Europe), and Dr. Raphael Mahler and Dr. Jacob Shatzky (Eastern Europe), working under the guidance of a special subcommittee of the Committee on Research, headed by Prof. Alexander Marx,1 completely revised that compilation and amplified it greatly by both additional data and fuller documentation. They were aided greatly not only by the magnificent resources of the large New York libraries but also by some valuable information accumulated in the offices of the American Jewish Committee, the World Jewish Congress, The Joint Distribution Committee, The Federation of Jews from Central Europe and other organizations. Certain significant data have also been secured from former officials of the institutions here listed. Some of these persons have taken considerable pains in fully answering pertinent questionnaires. Working under great pressure to complete this undertaking in time for immediate use the research staff of the Commission and the members of its subcommittee have earned the gratitude of all groups and persons interested in this project.\n\nIn the presentation of this List the authors have decided to begin with the German collections and to enumerate the collections outside of Germany in the alphabetical order of the countries involved. This division suggested itself because of Germany's position as the main enemy country, the great importance of its collections and the fact that ultimately much of the looted treasures from other countries will doubtless be located in some of its caches.\n\nThe principal collections of each country are placed at the head and are followed by local collections arranged by communities in alphabetical order, while smaller libraries and other minor collections are grouped separately at the end of the enumeration for each country. Some outstanding private collections, marked by an asterisk (*) are also listed. All other collections were publicly owned by either the Jewish community\n\n1 [Footnote] Prof. Freimann, in particular has proved very helpful in supplying new and reliable data from his own unmatched knowledge of European libraries. Mrs. Rachel Wischnitzer has lent her expert assistance in verifying the data concerning museums and art collections. The Research Fellows were also aided by certain directives emerging from the work of the Committee on Legal Problems, headed by Prof. Jerome Michael, and the Committee on Co-operation (also concerned with educational problems), headed by Prof. Horace M. Kallen.\n\n[p. 9]\n\nas a whole or by a Jewish association or foundation. Details as to the latter type of ownership, however, are given only for Germany and Austria, where they are likely to prove very useful in connection with claims for restoration and reparation. Names of institutions are, with few exceptions, given in the original language. Such exceptions proved unavoidable wherever the literature available in New York failed to mention the original name.\n\nThe Appendix is devoted to the important collections of Jewish books, art objects, documents, etc. known to have been included in some of the larger general libraries, museums or archives. The arrangement here follows the classification of the main list. Some scattered collections of Hebrew manuscripts, archival documents, books or antiquities, are likewise listed separately at the end of each country included in the Appendix, while details concerning the previous owners are again supplied for Germany and Austria alone. The List concludes with a full index of place-names. With the aid of this index, it is hoped, any reader will be in a position to ascertain all the cultural treasures of a particular locality recorded under the respective subdivisions.\n\nSince, as is well known, the Nazis transferred many Jewish book and art treasures from public and private collections to the various institutes organized for anti-Semitic research, it was deemed advisable to compile a special list of some of the major institutes of this type established in various countries. This list of Nazi institutes follows below.\n\nGERMANY\n\na.
