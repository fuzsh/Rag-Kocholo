Halle Berry is reportedly very upset with ex-husband David Justice. The Oscar winner, who recently announced her split from third spouse Olivier Martinez, is said to be in shock after the former baseball player lashed out at her on Twitter, accusing her of trying to "destroy [his] character" by never publicly denying rumours he hit her during their four-year marriage. A source close to the 'Extant' star, who divorced David in 1997, told gossip website TMZ.com that she has no idea what sparked his verbal attack because she has never identified the former lover that abused her and left her partially deaf in her left ear, and has no plans to do so in the future. David hit out at Halle, 46, on his social media profile for failing to help him clear his name over the years and insinuated she was responsible for her subsequent splits from second husband Eric Benet, who later voiced his support for the rant, Canadian model Gabriel Aubry and Olivier. The athlete told the Daily Mail Online he felt compelled to air his feelings in the wake of Halle's split from the French actor, saying: "So many years ago, I didn't say anything about the accusations that I abused her, but now I have three children, ages, 15, 13 and 11, two boys and one girl, and they can read this stuff and they have friends who will read it as well so I had to finally come out and say once and for all I never hit Halle Berry. "Back then it didn't matter, but it's different now. Halle never said I hit her but she never said I didn't either, which was disappointing." He added: "I am not the face of Halle Berry's exes, I won't be going on TV to talk about this. I just wanted to make sure my wife, my children and the rest of my family, friends and fans know the truth."
