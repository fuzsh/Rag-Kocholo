        "text": "Once again, actress Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubry are at odds over the custody of their daughter, Nahla. After a particularly contentious custody battle, Berry and Aubry were granted joint custody of their daughter in 2012. Recently though, there couple made another court appearance over a disagreement concerning how to care for their daughter. Specifically, Berry took Aubry back to court to settle a disagreement between the two over their daughter's hair.\n\nApparently, Aubry had Nahla's hair dyed blond, and had the child's naturally curly hair straightened. Both changes to Nahla's appearance were done without the consent of Berry. Although many would argue that such a disagreement does not deserve court intervention, Berry felt Aubry's actions were an attempt to mask the child's African American heritage - an action that may potentially have a negative impact on the child's psychological or emotional well being.\n\nAlthough the presiding court in this case did not find that Nahla's best interests were at risk, and thus did not find it necessary to modify the current custodial arrangement, the court did order both Berry and Aubry to refrain from altering Nahla's appearance until she is old enough to consent to such a change."
