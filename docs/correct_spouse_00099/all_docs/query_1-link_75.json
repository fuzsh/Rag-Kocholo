        "text": "Exes Halle Berry and Oliver Martinez have agreed to see a coach to help them better co-parent their 10-year-old son Maceo.\n\nBerry, 57, and Martinez, 58, have agreed to attend sessions to “resolve disputes and conflicts between them in an effort to successfully co-parent” Maceo, according to court documents obtained by Page Six.\n\nBoth parents will attend two individual sessions and at least six joint co-parenting sessions, per the docs.\n\nBerry’s current partner, Van Hunt, will also be allowed to attend the joint meetings.\n\nOnce the pair — who will split the cost of the sessions — reach their sixth session, the coach will decide if they need more sessions or if their work together is complete.\n\nBerry and the French actor separated in October 2015 after just two years of marriage. It wasn’t until nearly eight years later, August 2023, that they finalized their divorce and custody agreement.\n\nThey were granted joint legal custody of their son and Berry agreed to pay Martinez $8,000 in monthly child support.\n\nThe “Catwoman” star is also required to pay Martinez “4.3 percent of any income she receives above $2,000,000” in additional support.\n\nAdditionally, the actress agreed to pay Maceo’s “private school tuition, school uniforms, and school supplies,” but the payments will go directly to the school and not her ex.\n\nBerry, who has a reported net worth of $90 million, is also in charge of paying their child’s health insurance and 100 percent of all uninsured medical expenses, including therapy, according to the filing.\n\nBerry also shares a 16-year-old daughter Nahla with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry, whom she dated from 2005 to 2010.\n\nThe Academy Award winner has kept her family life quite private from the public eye, though she did celebrate Maceo’s birthday in 2021 by sharing a rare photo of him on Instagram along with a sweet message.\n\n“this little dude is 8 today!” she captioned the photo of Maceo holding up a peace sign. “Happy Birthday THUNDER! ❤️”\n\nShe also celebrated Nahla’s birthday in March that year, writing on social media, “No matter how many times I tell her I love her, I love her more than that. Happy 13th Birthday Nahla Boo.”"
