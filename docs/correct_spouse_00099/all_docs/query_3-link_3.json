        "text": "1989 – 1991: John Ronan\n\nBefore Halle Berry hit it big, she was a struggling actor booking jobs where she could. During the late ’80s and early ’90s, Berry dated John Ronan, a dentist from Chicago.\n\nFollowing their split, Ronan tried to sue Berry in 1993 for upwards of $80,000, claiming he loaned Berry the money when she was starting out, according to People.\n\nThe suit was, however, dismissed by a judge in 1994. Berry contended the money was a gift, and Ronan failed to list Berry as a debtor when he filed for bankruptcy.\n\n1992 – 1996: David Justice\n\nNot long after her split from Williams, Berry started dating Atlanta Braves baseball player David Justice. The couple dated for nearly a year before they married on New Year’s Day, 1993. Berry and Justice were married for roughly three years before they separated in early 1996. By June 1997, their divorce was finalized.\n\nAt the time of her divorce, Berry was candid about how she wanted to approach any future relationships. “After something as dramatic as a divorce, you have to step back and take a look at things,” she told People in May 1996. “I hope I’ll do things differently next time,” she said at the time, adding, “If not, I’ll be telling this story again.”\n\n1999 – 2003: Eric Benét\n\nSometime in 1999, singer and songwriter Eric Benét began courting Berry. The couple wed in January 2001 — he was by Berry’s side when she became the first Black woman to win the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role at the 2002 Oscars.\n\nThat same year, however, Benét sought help for sex addiction, and Berry had to confront her husband’s infidelity. “It was 10 days after the Acadmey Awards. I was on the top of the world,” Berry recalled to Oprah Winfrey in a 2004 interview. In that 10 days, a report from a tabloid surfaced claiming Benét cheated on Berry with “a woman of his past.”\n\nBerry was ready to go on the offensive, but she learned the truth. While filming Die Another Day in London, Benét disclosed to Berry he’d cheated on her with multiple women. “I wanted to save my marriage more than anything in the world,” Berry told Winfrey. By October 2003, the couple separated. Their divorce was finalized in January 2005.\n\n2006 – 2010: Gabriel Aubry\n\nNearly a year after her divorce from Benét was finalized, Berry started dating French-Canadian model Gabriel Aubry. The two met on the set of a Versace photoshoot.\n\nAfter three years together, Berry welcomed the couple’s only child, daughter Nahla (born March 2008). Just two years later, the couple announced their split.\n\nWhat followed Berry and Aubry’s breakup was a highly publicized custody battle over their baby girl. Berry wanted to move with Nahla to France, while Aubry contested that the move would make their joint custody aggreement incredibly difficult.\n\nBy November 2012, a judge ruled in Aubry’s favor, denying Berry’s request to move Nahla to France. It wasn’t until 2014 that the former couple finally came to an agreement regarding child support.\n\n2010 – 2015: Olivier Martinez\n\nShortly after her split from Aubry, Berry started dating French actor Olivier Martinez after meeting on set of Dark Tide.\n\nThey got engaged in 2012 and married in 2013 before welcoming a son, Maceo, in October that same year.\n\nMartinez got caught up in Berry and Aubry’s acrimonious split when they got into a physical altercation with his wife’s ex. Aubry was granted a restraining order following the November 2012 altercation in the Hollywood Hills, which reportedly began over an argument regarding Berry and Nahla moving to France, according to CNN.\n\nThe couple filed for divorce in 2015, which was eventually finalized 8 years later with Berry agreeing to pay Martinez $8,000 a month in child support and 4.3% of any income she receives above $2,000,000 in additional support.\n\n2020 – Now: Van Hunt\n\nIn 2020, Berry struck up a romance with Grammy-winning musician Van Hunt. The couple took their romance public with a sweet Instagram post in September 2020.\n\nIt actually wasn’t until April 2021 that Berry and Hunt made their red carpet debut at the Oscars. The two have been fairly reticent to publicly disclose certain details regarding their relationship, but it seems like they’ve built an incredible bond.\n\n“Their family has this ritual where, and I don’t think she would mind me saying it, they get together and have just a small acknowledgment of the day and so they, you know, they immersed me into that and welcomed me into that and it was just beautiful,” Hunt shared back in March 2021. “It was just thoughtful and considerate and sweet and that’s really the kind of person that she is, so, it was beautiful.”\n\nOf course, there have been plenty rumors suggesting Hunt and Berry got engaged — even tied the knot. From what we can tell, though, these two are wholly committed to one another."
