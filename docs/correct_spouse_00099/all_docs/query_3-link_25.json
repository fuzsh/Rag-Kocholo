The couple, who are both 47, got married at the Chateau des Conde in Burgundy, France, in July.\n\nThe actress has been married twice before, to baseball player David Justice and R&B singer/songwriter Eric Benet.\n\nOlivier Martinez has previously been in relationships with singer Kylie Minogue and British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.\n\nHalle Berry is set to play Storm in X-Men: Days of Future Past, which will be released next year.\n\nEarlier this year, the actress said filming wouldn't get in the way of her pregnancy."
