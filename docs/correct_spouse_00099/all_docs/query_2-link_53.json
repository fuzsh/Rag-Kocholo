        "text": "Halle Berry found something special with Van Hunt and has enjoyed showing off her relationship to her fans.\n\nBerry was previously married three times: to David Justice from 1993 to 1997, to Eric Benét from 2001 to 2005 and to Olivier Martinez from 2013 to 2016. She shares son Maceo (born in 2013) with Martinez and daughter Nahla (born in 2008) with ex Gabriel Aubry.\n\nBerry confirmed her relationship with Hunt in September 2020, shortly before a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Hunt was \"a wonderful, caring\" partner to the actress. While the pair had only been dating for a few months by then, the insider noted that Berry already saw the musician as The One.\n\nBerry and Hunt made their red carpet debut one year later at the 2021 Academy Awards.\n\n“Van is head over heels for Halle,” a second source told Us in April 2021. “It’s adorable to see how much he is infatuated with her.”\n\nScroll down to relive Berry and Hunt's romance:\n\nCredit: Stephen Lovekin/Shutterstock; Robb Cohen/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nMarch 2021\n\nDuring an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Hunt opened up about how Berry influenced his new music “in more ways than I can even tell you right now” in March 2021.\n\n\"I could show you rather than I could tell you, and I will show you really soon, I promise,\" he explained. \"The inspiration for our relationship goes across everything, even in my parenting. I'm a completely different person, I can say it like that, and I think that it's improved every aspect of my life.\"\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nMay 2021\n\n\"We do this thing called whatever the f--k we want! 💋\" Berry wrote alongside a photo of the twosome sharing a kiss. The actress was rocking red heart sunglasses and a simple T-shirt paired with a bikini bottom.\n\nAfter a troll commented, \"I think you love him more than he loves you!\" the Catwoman star replied,\"ummmm don't think so ... not this time.\"\n\nAnother person responded, \"You give me hope. We are the same age ... twice divorced ... I'm disenchanted with dating and then I see you two.\"\n\nBerry replied, \"Never give up on love...Keep your heart open and it will find you!\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Halle Berry/Instagram\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nThe pair sparked marriage speculation after Berry snapped a photo of the pair kissing inside a tropical chapel. However, hours later, she confirmed they were just joking and actually intended to her post to wish her followers a happy new year.\n\n“We were just having some New Year’s Day fun! People clearly don’t swipe as much as we thought they did. 😂 Thank you for the well wishes, tho’, it really touched our hearts,” she captioned a selfie with Hunt on January 1. “Now it’s OFFICIAL, the internet is no longer undefeated 😜 #nomoreswipes4me #Januaryfoolsday.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Van Hunt/Instagram\n\nJanuary 2022\n\n\"My son, Maceo, of his own volition did this little commitment ceremony for us in the back seat of the car,\" Berry told AARP the Magazine in January 2022, referring to her son with ex-husband Olivier Martinez. \"I think he finally sees me happy, and it's infectious. It was his way of saying, 'This is good. I like this. This makes me happy.'\"\n\nShe added: \"It was a very real moment for all of us. I teared up, Van was fighting back tears. Even Maceo knew he’d said something poignant. It meant a lot to us. I have two children with two different fathers. Van has a son. As a mom living this modern, blended family, all I care about is that my kids are OK with the decisions I’m making."
