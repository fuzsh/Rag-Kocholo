        "text": "Halle Berry is one happy mama, and she isn’t afraid to show it.\n\nBerry took to Instagram Thursday to celebrate her daughter Nahla’s 15th birthday. The actress paid tribute to her eldest-born with a trio of candid photos.\n\n“One of the greatest gifts the universe has given me is my daughter, Nahla,” Berry captioned the post. “Please join me in wishing her a happy 15th birthday today!”\n\nThe first photo of Berry’s post shows a framed black-and-white photo of the mother-daughter pair, while the second shows Nahla lying on a hammock with her back turned to the camera. The final photo features the teen sitting on a couch, with a hat obscuring most of her face.\n\n“She is the sun that never fades and the moon that never wanes,” Berry continued. “I love you sweet angel.”\n\nBerry, a mother of two, shares daughter Nahla with Canadian model Gabriel Aubry. The “Moonfall” star also has a 9-year-old son, Maceo, with ex-husband Olivier Martinez, a French actor.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress opened up about the impact motherhood has had on her life in an interview with AARP: The Magazine in January 2022.\n\n“My kids have been my greatest teachers. Before the world silences them, they’re truth tellers,” Berry said. “And if as adults we’re present and we listen to what they’re saying, we can learn a lot about ourselves and about the world we live in from their perspective. So, I listen to them a lot, and I learn.”\n\nOn her relationship with Nahla, Berry also spoke about seeing the world through her daughter’s eyes as an older Black woman.\n\n“My daughter Nahla was born the year Obama was elected president, so mostly she’s known a person of color in that higher position,” Berry said. “When I tell my daughter there was a time when I never thought I would see that, she’s like, ‘What? What do you mean? We’ve always had Barack Obama.’ I say, ‘No, you’ve always had Barack Obama.’”\n\nHalle Berry puts marriage rumors to rest,says she was 'just having some fun' with Van Hunt"
