        "text": "Halle Berry has been victorious in her decade-long child support battle with ex Gabriel Aubry.\n\nThe 56-year-old, who has been embroiled in costly custody battles with the fathers of her two children Nahla Aubry, 15 and Maceo Martinez, nine.\n\nShe was initially ordered to pay Gabriel, who is Nahla's father, $16,000 per month plus a lump sump of $115,000 in 2014. She later blasted the figure as \"extortion.\"\n\nShe was able to half her original payments to $8,000 in 2021 but was also ordered to pay 4.3% of any annual income she made over $1.95million.\n\nEarlier this month, Halle, who reportedly makes $10million per movie, was able to cap her additional payments at $4.5million.\n\nIn the filing obtained by the Daily Mail, Halle's payments \"shall not exceed $109,650 per year\" which is the difference between the original annual figures.\n\n\"Halle shall continue to pay Gabriel 4.3 percent of any income she receives above $1.95 million, as and for additional child support for Nahla, however, any additional payments of child support pursuant to this Paragraph shall not exceed $109,650 per year, which is the difference between 4.3 percent of $1.95 million and $4.5 million,\" the filing states.\n\n\"The parties agree that additional child support over and above $109,650 per year would exceed Nahla's reasonable needs.\"\n\nThe new agreement will remain in force until Nahla graduates from high school or until she turns 19 if she's still in school which means the long-running custody battle could finally be coming to an end.\n\nHalle and Gabriel began dating in 2005 after her divorce from her second husband Eric Benet. The couple then split five years later.\n\n\"She is, and will forever be, one of the most special and beautiful people that I have ever known, and I am certain that we will continue to have only love and respect for one another,\" Gabriel said after the breakup.\n\nThe pair also insisted that they would \"remain friends and committed parents,\" but legal proceeding began after Halle tried to relocate to France with Nahla to live with her now ex-husband Olivier Martinez.\n\nFollow the Mirror US News page on Facebook.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter and Facebook ."
