        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Halle Berry and actor Olivier Martinez are ending their two-year marriage and say they want to proceed with the best interests of their young son in mind.\n\nThe actors released a joint statement announcing the divorce on Tuesday, a day after Berry filed a divorce petition under a pseudonym. Martinez filed his own petition on Tuesday, and both cited irreconcilable differences for the breakup.\n\nBoth actors are open to joint custody, and Berry's filing repeatedly requests that a judge enter orders that are \"in the best interest\" of their 2-year-old son.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that we have come to the decision to divorce,\" the actors wrote in a joint statement. \"We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus of what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life and we hope that you respect our and, most importantly, our children's privacy as we go through this difficult period.\"\n\nBerry and Martinez met while making the 2012 film \"Dark Tide.\" They married in July 2013.\n\nThe actress' attorney filed for divorce by listing the name as \"Hal Maria\" and identified Martinez as \"Oliver Martin.\"\n\nThe filing states the pair have a prenuptial agreement that does not entitle Martinez to spousal support. She is also seeking to avoid child support payments, writing: \"Each party to equally share the cost of raising their child.\"\n\nBerry won a best actress Academy Award in 2002 for \"Monster's Ball.\" She has been married twice previously and has a 7-year-old daughter from her relationship with model Gabriel Aubry.\n\n(© Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
