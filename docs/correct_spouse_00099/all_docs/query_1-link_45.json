        "text": "Despite rumors that she has split with longtime love Gabriel Aubry, Halle Berry was all smiles at the DKMS 4th Annual Gala in New York. The actress, sans her model partner, especially lit up while talking about adorable daughter Nahla Ariela exclusively with In Touch. \"Being here at an event like this, I'm just reminded how blessed I am that I have a healthy little girl,\" Halle said about her 2-year-old with Gabriel at the April 29 soiree for DKMS, an organization that recruits bone marrow donors for leukemia patients. But maybe she was thinking of the alleged breakup when she said she doubted she'd see the stork again. \"If God says so. I don't think he's going to say so though!\" she responded when asked if she would like more children."
