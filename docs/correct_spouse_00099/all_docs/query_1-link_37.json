        "text": "Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez have agreed to keep their ongoing divorce and custody issue out of the public eye.\n\nAccording to new legal documents obtained by The Blast, the 'Bruised' star and her famous ex-husband have stipulated to use a private judge for future issues regarding their divorce and parenting their son.\n\nIn the filing, the former power couple signed off on taking any of their disputes to a retired judge named Roy L. Paul. As you know, this is a prevalent thing to do by uber-famous people, which allows them to keep all information regarding the case private. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie recently used a private judge to resolve their issues, but it didn't work out too well. But that's a whole other story.\n\nHalle Berry & Olivier Martinez Will Settle Divorce Out Of Public Eye\n\nTrending:\n\nJohn Amos’ Daughter Insists GoFundMe Is NOT ‘Fake’: ‘I Am Not Crazy’\n\nJohn Amos’ Family Tries To Raise $500K To Help Him After Alleged Elder Abuse\n\nWendy Williams’ Son Addresses Her ‘Fatal’ Alcoholism Encouraged By Collusion Between Manager & Guardian\n\n‘Green Power Ranger’ Jason David Frank’s Karate Studio Sued For Eviction After His Death\n\nBritney Spears Deletes Post Claiming She ‘Quit The Business’\n\nJohn Amos’ Daughter Insists GoFundMe Is NOT ‘Fake’: ‘I Am Not Crazy’\n\nJohn Amos’ Family Tries To Raise $500K To Help Him After Alleged Elder Abuse\n\nWendy Williams’ Son Addresses Her ‘Fatal’ Alcoholism Encouraged By Collusion Between Manager & Guardian\n\n‘Green Power Ranger’ Jason David Frank’s Karate Studio Sued For Eviction After His Death\n\nBritney Spears Deletes Post Claiming She ‘Quit The Business’\n\n\"All proceedings before the Temporary Judge shall be open to the public, with no restriction on attendance that would not be applicable if the proceedings were held in a courthouse,\" the document states.\n\nThe \"Temporary Judge is also authorized to retain a judicial assistant to assist him. (The people) hourly rate is $300/hour, and the parties will remit the fees under the agreed-upon fee split.\" Oh ya, I forgot to mention, this process isn't cheap.\n\nThe good news is that this situation typically points to famous ex-couples in a perfect place. Usually, if the parents have significant issues with each other, they keep these cases in the courthouse. It makes sense, considering just weeks after the divorce was filed, Martinez was seen sporting his wedding ring. Sources told E!, \"Everything is lovely and amicable between the two.\"\n\nHalle Berry Still With Her New Boyfriend, Van Hunt!\n\nIn 2015, Halle filed for divorce after only two years of marriage. At the time, sources close to the actress said the couple had been separated for several months.\n\nOlivier Martinez, the actress's third husband, met Berry on the \"Dark Tide\" set in 2010. The couple shares a young son, Maceo. The actress also shares a teenage daughter, Nahla, with her ex-husband Gabriel Aubry.\n\nBerry is currently in a relationship with musician Van Hunt and stepped out with him last weekend, attending the Future Artists Gala hosted by the LA County High School for the Arts. Halle addressed the situation in a recent interview with Woman's Health, saying, \"I’m a much better mother in this circumstance than I would have been had I stayed in a romantic relationship that didn’t serve me and didn’t make me feel the way I need to feel as a woman.\" Adding, \"I just feel fulfilled; I feel happy in my life romantically, as a mother, as an artist.\""
