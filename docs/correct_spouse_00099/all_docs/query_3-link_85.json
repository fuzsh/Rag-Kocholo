        "text": "In a pledge that could come as a big disappointment to current flame Gabriel Aubry, a lovesick Halle Berry has vowed never to tie the knot again.\n\n\"I will never, never get married again,\" the Oscar-winning actress tells the April issue of InStyle.\n\n\"I've come to a place where I think two people can share their lives without the ring, without the piece of paper.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old has had a rocky romantic life, with failed marriages to both baseball star David Justice and R&B singer Eric Benet.\n\nBerry met Aubry, a Canadian model nine years her junior, while shooting a Versace ad in November 2005.\n\n\"After my last relationship [with actor Michael Ealy] broke up I was feeling like \"¦ it would be okay to be on my own,\" Halle said.\n\n\"But [Aubry] was disarmingly sweet and caring and different. In the past I've been attracted to big personalities. Gabriel was shy. He hardly talked to me at first.\n\n\"It wasn't a slam dunk; it wasn't the guy just showering affection on me. It made it more interesting. We were equally matched — put it that way.\n\nDespite never wanting to walk down the aisle again, Berry said she definitely plans on making or adopting babies.\n\n\"I definitely want children. Very much,\" she said.\n\n\"I want my kids to realize it's only through hard work that any success or real joy comes. It's not about money; it's the intangible rewards — having integrity and doing what you say you're going to do.\"\n\nBerry stars with Bruce Willis in Perfect Stranger, which opens in the US on April 13.\n\nBy ninemsn staff"
