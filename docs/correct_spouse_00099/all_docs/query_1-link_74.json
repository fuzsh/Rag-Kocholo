        "text": "Some would suggest, that Halle Berry is known for two things: acting and divorce.\n\nUnfortunately while she may be extremely successful in her career she’s the quite opposite in her love life. Since her career began, she’s been linked to very attractive and successful men but has yet to permanently settle down with any of them.\n\nHer most recent relationship, we were rooting for the best but sadly our rooting failed to keep her married. This month, the couple issued a joint statement with People, announcing the end of their two year relationship.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we have come to the decision to divorce. We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus of what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life and we hope that you respect our and, most importantly, our children’s privacy as we go through this difficult period.”\n\nAs another couple bites the dust, here’s a brief and painful history of her relationship woes.\n\nDanny Wood\n\nBefore her career kicked off, Halle Berry dated New Kids Off The Block’s Danny Wood.\n\nPhoto Credit: Digital Spy\n\nWesley Snipes\n\nHalle dated her Jungle Fever co-star for a short stint in 1990. It’s also rumored that he is her ex that hit her and caused her partial deafness in her left ear.\n\nPhoto Credit: Mirror\n\nEddie Murphy\n\nShe’s was rumored to have dated her Boomerang co-star for a bit in the early ’90s.\n\nJohn Ronan\n\nBetween dating Snipes and Wood she dated Chicago dentist John Ronan from 1989 to 1991. He tried to sue her for $80k over money he said he loaned her but lost the case in court after he failed to list her as a debtor when he filed for bankruptcy in 1992.\n\nPhoto Credit: Mirror\n\nChristopher Williams\n\nHalle dated R&B singer Christopher Williams in 1992 for about a year and a half. In an interview in 2009, Williams said he and Berry ended things because of their growing careers.\n\nPhoto Credit: Mirror\n\nDavid Justice\n\nHalle married David Justice, a former pro-baseball player New Years Eve, 1992. They divorced four years later in a messy divorce where she filed a restraining order to have Justice remain at least 500 yards from her Hollywood Hills home. Years later Berry opened up about her marriage to Justice with Parade, saying she almost killed herself following their divorce.\n\nI was sitting in my car, and I knew the gas was coming when I had an image of my mother finding me. She sacrificed so much for her children, and to end my life would be an incredibly selfish thing to do. It was all about a relationship. My sense of worth was so low. I promised myself I would never be a coward again.\n\nShemar Moore\n\nShortly after divorcing David Justice she began a relationship Shemar Moore. They dated for a few months but apparently she really did a number on the actor. While speaking to BET, he explained their relationship.\n\nShe was the first woman to really knock my socks off. I fell hard for Halle. A lot of people now know we dated, but we had to keep it hush-hush at the time because she was fresh off her divorce from David Justice. I’m still grateful for that relationship. I was smitten not just because of who she was, but because we were so similar in so many ways. She was biracial, she was kind of going through the same things I was in Hollywood. Toni was a fun ride, but Halle was a necessary experience. It made me much stronger as a man, and knowing the caliber of woman I want in the future.\n\nPhoto Credit:\n\nEric Benet\n\nEveryone knows about Halle Berry’s marriage to Eric Benet. They married in 2001 and divorced in 2005 after his sex addiction caused him to cheat on the actress.\n\nPhoto Credit: IB Times\n\nMichael Ealy\n\nLike her first divorce, Halle dated actor Michael Ealy shortly after divorcing Benet in ’05. To this day, however, they refer to one another as just good friends.\n\nPhoto Credit: Mirror\n\nGabriel Aubry\n\nHalle began dating Canadian model Gabriel Aubry late 2005. While together they welcomed their daughter Nahla, in March of 2008. They stayed together for two more years before splitting in 2010 and beginning a nasty custody battle over her.\n\nPhoto Credit: IB Times\n\nOlivier Martinez\n\nHer most recent relationship was with Martinez. They began dating in 2011, got married in 2013, and welcomed their son Maceo in 2014. Currently the two are seperated until their divorce is finalized. While speaking to Extra, she assured them she’s fine with her third failed marriage and countless failed relationships.\n\nI’m doing okay, I really am. I, I keep pushing and I’m really happy to be here because whenever you’re going through anything in life, when you step outside yourself and focus on others, that’s always the best remedy for any situation that you’d rather not be dealing with.\n\nPhoto Credit: TV Guide"
