        "text": "Halle Berry is a birthday Barbie!\n\nThe actress shared photos from her 57th birthday celebration on Monday, which included a family outing with her 15-year-old daughter Nahla, whom she shares with ex Gabriel Aubry, and her boyfriend Van Hunt to the World of Barbie exhibit in Santa Monica, California.\n\n\"My mini me (but not so mini anymore) and my VanO took me to the World of Barbie for my B-day!\" Berry captioned her post on Instagram. \"I got to let my inner Barbie soar!!!! I love you guys …thank you ! And… I highly recommend it.\"\n\nThe trio stuck to the theme, each in their own unique outfits that would make Margot Robbie's Barbie and Ryan Gosling's Ken proud.\n\nBerry wore a pink slip dress with a feather neckline, bedazzled cowboy boots and a heart-shaped rainbow purse for her special day. Nahla, who towered over her mother, wore a pink floral mini dress with a corset bodice and open-toe heels. The teenager also appeared to be rocking a dyed red hairstyle.\n\nHunt participated in the Barbie theme, bringing the Kenergy to the group in a pink t-shirt and matching teddy bear backpack.\n\n'Barbie' ending: Greta Gerwig talks 'emotional' final line, creator Ruth Handler (Spoilers!)\n\nBerry's birthday post is a rare glimpse into her life as a mother. She is also mom to 9-year-old son Maceo, whom she shares with ex-husband Olivier Martinez.\n\n\"I've fought really hard to protect their privacy, and I just want them to have their life and have it be theirs,\" the \"Catwoman\" actress told Today in 2019 while discussing why she keeps her children's faces off of her social media.\n\nShe added: \"I just don't want to plaster them all over the internet. That just doesn't feel right for me. They're gonna do that soon enough. That's gonna be their life when they grow up, and they will choose when that starts.\""
