        "text": "The Oscar winner still hopes to find long-lasting love, but Patsy Kensit has no plans to ever marry again after splitting from fourth husband.\n\nShe's one of the most beautiful women in the world, but Halle Berry has found herself single once again after splitting up with model Gabriel Aubry.\n\nThe couple dated for 4 years and have a 2 year old daughter, Nahla. Berry said the split was amicable and by the time the news had reached the press her and Aubry had already moved on.\n\nDespite the split, the actress said that she's still hopeful she'll find long-lasting love.\n\nUnlike Berry, British actress Patsy Kensit has vowed never to marry again after the collapse of her fourth marriage to DJ Jeremy Healy. Kensit and Healy had only been married for a year, but their relationship had already shown signs of trouble when Healy failed to show up to the first wedding ceremony they'd organised.\n\nThe couple however did eventually marry in April 2009."
