        "text": "A judge recently granted approval for a child support settlement between Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubry, her ex-boyfriend. The settlement governs the amount of child support Berry will pay to Aubry for living expenses relating to their child, a 6-year-old girl.\n\nA Superior Court judge approved the settlement at the end of May. The settlement says that Berry must make monthly payments of $16,000 (which add up to close to $200,000 annually) for their daughter’s support. The Hollywood star will also provide money for educational tuition; however, she and Aubry will pay equal shares for their child’s medical care.\n\nAs is the case with many family law cases in Maryland, the settlement agreement in this Los Angeles case did not stop with child support. Berry also agreed to pay retroactively — $115,000 in back child support payments. Aubry will further receive $300,000 from Berry to pay for the attorneys’ fees he expended during the ex-couple’s child custody battle. The ex-couple had entered into a child custody dispute previously. Also, a judge’s order in 2012 prevented the actress from taking her daughter to live with her in France.\n\nThis case is a prime example of how men are not always the ones who are responsible for child support payments. Indeed, in some Maryland cases, the mother is required to pay child support to the father. Fathers who feel they are owed child support may wish to investigate the possibility of pursuing a legal action, either to enforce a previous child support decree or to establish their right to receive such financial assistance to help with the rearing of their children in the future."
