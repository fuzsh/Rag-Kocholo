        "text": "Halle Berry's ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry was arrested on Thanksgiving after getting into a brawl with Berry's fianc√©e Oliver Martinez, TMZ.com reports.\n\nWhen Aubry arrived at Berry's home to drop off their 4-year-old daughter, Nahla, Martinez allegedly told Berry's ex, \"We have to move on.\" This could be in reference to the recent count ruling, in which a judge denied Berry's wish to move her daughter Nahla to France.\n\nJudge rules against Halle Berry's wish to move child to France\n\nAubry allegedly reacted by shoving Martinez and trying to punch him, starting a brawl that ended with Martinez punching Aubry in the face and pinning him to the ground. Aubry suffered a broken rib and contusions to his face, while Martinez may have broken his hand and suffered neck injuries, according to the site.\n\nMartinez made a citizen's arrest for battery against Aubry, who was transported to the hospital. Martinez also went to the hospital to treat his injuries. A protective order was issued, requiring Aubry to stay 100 yards away from Berry, Martinez and daughter Nahla."
