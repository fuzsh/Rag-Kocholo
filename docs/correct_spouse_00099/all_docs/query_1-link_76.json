        "text": "The divorce of actress Halle Berry from actor Olivier Martinez has been finalized, per PEOPLE. The couple shares a son, Maceo, 9.\n\nThe Oscar winner and Martinez initially filed for divorce in October 2015 after two years of marriage.\n\nThe ruling grants joint legal custody of Maceo, for whom Berry will pay Martinez $8,000 a month in child support. In addition, the “Monster’s Ball” actress will pay her ex “4.3% of any income she receives above $2,000,000″ in additional support.\n\nAs part of the divorce, Berry will also foot the bill of her son’s private school, uniforms and school supplies, as well as any extracurricular activities, paying back Martinez back for these costs from the 2023-2024 academic year.\n\nThe couple released a statement to PEOPLE about their divorce in 2020, saying, “It is with a heavy heart that we have come to the decision to divorce.\n\n“We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus of what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life and we hope that you respect our and, most importantly, our children’s privacy as we go through this difficult period.”\n\nHalle Berry has been a mom since 2008. She has a daughter Nahla Ariela Aubry, with her ex Gabriel Aubry in March 2008. Berry’s son, Maceo-Robert Martinez, whom she shares with now ex-husband Martinez, was born five years later.\n\nMORE ON SILIVE"
