        "text": "This is pretty disturbing. Actress Halle Berry accused her ex Gabriel Aubry of racism and psychological abuse in court papers related to their custody battle over their daughter Nahla that were obtained by Radar Online. According to the outlet, the 53-year-old actress also claimed her ex had a sexual relationship with a family member and that it impacted their sex life and relationship to the point that Berry insisted they go to therapy.\n\nIn November 2005, Berry began dating the model. The couple welcomed their daughter in March 2008, but in 2010, they announced that they had ended their relationship months before — so clearly, things went south very quickly. Berry claimed in court papers that Aubry used disparaging racial terms and would not recognize their child as being biracial.\n\nThe Monster’s Ball actress also alleged in legal documents for the 2011 custody case, “After the first six months of our relationship, our sex life diminished and after one year we had sex less than three times per year … [Gabriel] refused to either recognize or accept responsibility for these issues. Instead, he criticized my body in ways which are very demeaning to women … I finally convinced Petitioner to go to a joint therapist to address these issues.”\n\nBerry also claimed that her ex told her about an incestuous relationship he was in previously that began when he was growing up in foster homes. She alleged that the model had a history of psychological issues like depression and a social anxiety disorder, but would not get help. Ultimately, the duo couldn’t get over the challenges, and they ended the relationship.\n\nIn the end, Aubry’s lawyer asked the court to take a lot of Berry’s more damaging testimony out of the record. The attorney claimed her comments about incest were “not relevant.” Thankfully, by November 2012, Berry’s lawyer announced that Berry and Aubry reached a custody agreement in court — an amicable one at that.\n\nBerry soon moved on with French actor Olivier Martinez — they began dating in 2010 and confirmed their engagement in March 2012. Berry and Martinez got married in France in July 2013, and welcomed their son — Maceo — in October 2013. Unfortunately, in 2015, the couple announced they were divorcing. Berry seems to be living a much quieter life with her kids these days and appears to have left the ugly custody battle behind her."
