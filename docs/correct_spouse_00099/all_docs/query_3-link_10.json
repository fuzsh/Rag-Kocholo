        "text": "He was one of the world hottest models\n\nBorn in 1976, Aubry was discovered during his 20s while partying in a nightclub during a ski trip to Quebec, per The Famous People. Standing at 188cm. the young man was soon in demand and went on to model for top designers like DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Versace, Valentino, Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss.\n\nHe made history as the first male model to appear on L’Uomo Vogue’s cover. Another career highlight was a Macy’s commercial in 2008 where he appeared alongside Donald Trump and Mariah Carey.\n\nIn the early 2010s, he became one of the top paid male models globally, earning US$30,000 a day and millions per year, according to Today.\n\nHe was a businessman too, and owned a cafe\n\nBesides modelling, Aubry also dipped his toes in the business world. In 2006, he opened a Cuban-inspired eatery, Café Fuego, in Manhattan, which he said was “very similar to my house, so it’s very warm”, per Hello! magazine.\n\nHowever, it later closed and he didn’t start any other F&B project. “It was fun for a while, but I don’t think I’ll go back to restaurants. That’s a tough business,” he told Daily Front Row.\n\nHe also plays the guitar and has recorded an album\n\nPlaying the guitar is Aubry’s favourite form of relaxation, he revealed to PopSugar. He even turned his hobby into a career. In 2008, he released an album named after his restaurant, “Café Fuego Volume 1”, with Latin and Cuban roots. He produced the album and played guitar, performing together with fellow Canadian musicians Marc Bell and Cristobal Tapia de Veer.\n\n“This album is our heart and soul put to music, and I hope that the Cuban, folk, and bossa nova influences that come together on the album will captivate our audiences,” he said in a statement about the album.\n\nHe leads a simple life\n\nWhen Aubry isn’t on the runway, he enjoys a daily routine like any other guy, he shared with Daily Front Row. “I’m a daddy, I go to the gym, I golf and I work around the house. It’s a pretty simple life,” he said.\n\nIn addition to guitar, golf is his other hobby. He takes part in various celebrity tournaments and has even taught his daughter, Nahla, to play in their garden at home since she was a year old, per People.\n\nHe is a low-key person and is camera shy off the runway\n\nWhile he might have made a career from walking in the spotlight, Aubry prefers staying away from it outside of work. “I was always a super shy person. I don’t like to be followed by the cameras,” he told Hello! magazine.\n\nHe isn’t very active on social media either. He has a Twitter and Instagram account but his last tweet was in 2017. “I’m a very private guy and I like to keep my life that way,” he told Daily Front Row. “Twitter and Instagram are for people who like to reach out to people to show what they’re doing, but I like to keep my life private as best I can.”\n\nBut he has a high-profile list of dates\n\nHowever, Aubry can’t always avoid the cameras as he has been linked with A-list stars from time to time.\n\nIt started in 2005 when he met Halle Berry at a photo shoot for Versace and they soon became an item, per British media. They welcomed daughter Nahla in 2008 but, in 2010, their relationship ended in chaos with a highly publicised custody battle.\n\nBerry wasn’t happy to pay Aubry US$16,000 a month in child support from 2014, even though she earned much more than him, telling Hello! magazine, “I feel I can speak on it as I’ve been paying it for a decade now. I feel if a woman or a man is having to pay support that is way more than they reasonably need to help support the child, I think that is wrong.” The amount was cut in half to US$8,000 from March 2021.\n\nAubry briefly dated Kim Kardashian in late 2010 – they were seen together enjoying a Lakers game. However, the romance lasted only a couple of weeks, possibly because Berry “didn’t want a reality star in her daughter’s life”, according to People.\n\nLast year, Aubry was rumoured to have had a summer fling with Jennifer Aniston but the two never confirmed their relationship, per Cheat Sheet."
