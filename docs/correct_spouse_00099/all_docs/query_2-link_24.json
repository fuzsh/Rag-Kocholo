        "text": "Halle Berry and her third husband, Olivier Martinez, have finalized their divorce after nearly eight grueling years of battling in court.\n\nThe Oscar winner and the French actor, both 57, decided to divorce in October 2015 after two years of marriage, but the proceedings were reportedly held up a year later because they were unable to resolve custody issues.\n\nCourt documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday and obtained by Page Six detail the terms of their agreement, which orders Berry to cough up a hefty sum of money for their only child’s expenses.\n\nThe “Catwoman” star must pay Martinez $8,000 a month in child support for their 9-year-old son, Maceo.\n\nAs of April of this year, she was also ordered to pay the “Unfaithful” star 4.3 percent of any income she receives above $2 million, which would be considered “additional child support” for Maceo.\n\nAccording to the court documents, Berry must also pay for her son’s “private school tuition, school uniforms, and school supplies,” but the payments will go directly to the school and not her ex.\n\nThe “Monster’s Ball” star also agreed to pay 100 percent of all of Maceo’s extracurricular activities, which means she will have to reimburse Martinez for the 2023-2024 school year since he had covered the costs.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nBerry will also pay for her son’s health insurance and 100 percent of all uninsured medical expenses, including therapy, per the documents.\n\nAside from the costs pertaining to her child, the “Swordfish” star, who has a reported net worth of $90 million, has “voluntarily” agreed to contribute $55,000 toward Martinez’s attorney’s fees.\n\nDespite some discrepancies in the financial aspects of this agreement, Berry and Martinez will have their fair share of quality time with Maceo, per the court documents.\n\nThe former couple worked out a schedule that allows each party to have physical custody of their son for half of the week — Monday to Wednesday or Wednesday to Friday — with alternating weekends.\n\nThey are also allowed to “make up time” if there is an inconvenience due to work commitments.\n\nBerry’s attorney and reps did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.\n\nMartinez’s rep also could not be reached.\n\nThe former couple, who married in July 2013, released a joint statement at the time of their split that read, “It is with a heavy heart that we have come to the decision to divorce.\n\n“We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus for what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life, and we hope that you respect our, and most importantly our children’s privacy, as we go through this difficult period.”\n\nPrior to Martinez, Berry was married to former MLB player David Justice from 1993 to 1997 and singer Eric Benét from 2001 to 2005.\n\nShe shares a 15-year-old daughter, Nahla, with model ex Gabriel Aubry.\n\nIn 2017, the “Gothika” star spoke about how dealing with three failed marriages has not been “easy” for her.\n\n“[As] women, we go into marriage thinking it’s going to last forever and that this is our prince on a shiny horse,” she said at the time. “That’s what fairy tales taught me as a kid … and I’m kind of anti-fairy tales today.”"
