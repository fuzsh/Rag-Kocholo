        "text": "Halle just lost her bid to move her daughter, Nahla, to France permanently, which just so happens to be Olivier's home. I can't imagine how she thought her ex would agree to essentially give up his parental rights just so she could move half-way around the world and leave him in the dust.\n\nGabriel obviously wants to have a relationship with his daughter but Halle seems to feel she is above the rules. I also have a problem with her fiancee getting involved in a situation he really should not be part of. I am sure there are a lot of hurt feelings and everything came to a head. I hope the security cameras captured something.\n\nGabriel sure got the crap beat out of him though, wow...those are some bruises.\n\nWell said!\n\nI am so sick of these women (stars or not) who think that dad is only important for the child support check.\n\nSo Halle was trying to get the courts to allow her to move to France?!?! How insensitive. Whether she likes it or not (and she must have at one point or there'd be no Nahla lol!) Gabriel is Nahla's father. She can't just cut him out of her life and moving out of the country would effectively do that. He has just as much claim to her as Halle. Why can't she see that it's a good thing for the father to be involved in her child's life? And her fiance had absolutely zero business sticking his nose into this business. He is not married to Halle, is not Nahla's father. No wonder Gabriel was confused...apparently the normal drop off/exchange for Nahla is through the nanny. You know, not through the fiance. Geez.\n\nI once knew a guy who did contract work instead of getting full time jobs. He went from one contract to another, but there was one constant. EVERY boss he had was an idiot, incompetent, etc. They did not appreciate his talents as they should. At some point, I realized the bosses were not the problem. EVERY boss cannot be an idiot and incompetent......it just defies the odds. Nope, the guy I knew was the problem, which is why he had to move from job to job. No one wanted to keep him around. He never re-signed a contract....They wanted him and his nuttiness gone.\n\nHalle Berry is much the same. Every man she is involved with is heaven sent, until she parts company with him and he is the devil. I will say she has been involved with some losers, but hey.....SHE PICKED THEM. She is a lightning rod for drama. She is a beautiful train wreck. A disaster movie in the making.\n\nMy take is the GA was useful to her as a sperm donor to make a Super Baby. Too bad for her, GA did not see things that way and actually wants to be a father to the child. The \"recently moved security camera,\" the nanny not being around for the child exchange, etc.........It all screams set up. The boyfriend needs to realize he is simply THAT. Not the new daddy.\n\nSadly, this child would probably be better off miles away from her crazy, drama-seeking mother.\n\nI once knew a guy who did contract work instead of getting full time jobs.

That's a definite red flag! What I'm more upset about, regardless of who started the brawl, is that obviously Olivier has no self control when angered. He beat the living daylights out of Gabriel. It's very concerning because what if poor Nahla gets him angry someday? He showed zero restraint against her father, while she was there in the driveway and saw no problem with beating him. That is very concerning and is why I'm sure that detectives and CPS are investigating Halle and Olivier.\n\nAnother poster mentioned it and I read it in some article, apparently the camera were \"repositioned\" just before the incident and nothing is on tape.\n\nIt said once GA spoke with police he practically begged them to get the tapes to show what really happened. He didn't know they were moved and that they caught it all on tape.\n\nThere was also something about him being arrested because OM used citizen's arrest. . I don't know how citizen's arrest works. Can someone explain?\n\nWell, first Barney and Gomer need to get into a big argument about making illegal u-turns. Then when Barney makes one, you need to have Gomer, in his best southern twang, yelling \"Citizen's ah-ray-est! Citizen's ah-ray-est!\"\n\nWhen I heard about the citizen's arrest situation at HB's house, this was what immediately came to mind as it's the only time I've ever heard of it being used!\n\nAh! That beautiful face! He should have hit OM over the head with a snow globe (reference to his part in Unfaithful, lest people think I am advocating violence).\n\nI heard on one of the radio stations this morning that all 3 were at Nahla's school program the night before Thanksgiving and Om went up to GA and said something to the effect if all these people weren't around he would pound the snot out of him. And GA thought it odd that the nanny who usually was the one at the handoff of the child wasn't there, but OM was. I guess OM is pretty pissed that the 3 of them can't move to his country and feels that GA is preventing their happy life together.\n\nYeowch!\n\nThat face is not going to be modeling anytime soon! Wonder if he had it insured. . .\n\nHalle Berry does seem to have a quite a string of men - David Justice, Eric Benet, Gabriel Aubry, now Olivier Martinez.\n\nShe has always seemed a bit unstable.\n\nRemember when she ran a red light and crashed into another car, injuring a woman? She left the scene of the accident and resulted in a 3 year probabtion.\n\nShe's also estranged from her sister.\n\nWhy can't she see that it's a good thing for the father to be involved in her child's life?\n\nShe seems to have big time daddy issues - she and her mother and sister were abandoned by their dad, so I'm sure Halle thinks she can raise Nahla just fine on her own.\n\nI didn't realize the drama that seemed to follow all of Halle's relationships.

It's all very strange. I saw some pics of Gabriel's hands and there isn't a scratch on them. If he was throwing blows, you'd think there would be some kind of evidence.\n\nI'm just astounded that Halle thinks any of this is an ideal environment for her child. Crazy crazy.\n\nI lost a lot of respect for her parenting and frankly her emotional health when I read an interview in which she stated categorically that her dd was black, she was going to raise her as black (whatever that means) and that she was going to ignore her caucasian heritage. She felt that her own caucasian heritage was irrelevant and so was her dd's. As a person of multi-racial background myself, I was appalled by such an attitude, which negates and denigrates one's own or especially, one's child's heritage. It's deceptive, deeply emotionally unhealthy and confusing.\n\n(I also cannot imagine how hurt I would be as her mother -- who is caucasian -- to hear that my heritage is something irrelevant and worth denying, especially since the mother was the one who largely raised her as a single parent.)"
