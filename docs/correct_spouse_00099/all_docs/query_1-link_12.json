        "text": "Halle Berry's divorce from ex-husband Olivier Martinez has been finalized after nearly eight years.\n\nBerry and Martinez, who share 9-year-old son Maceo, reached an agreement on their divorce and custody, according to a 33-page document obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nPer the decision, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, the former couple will share joint legal and physical custody of their son. Berry, 57, has also agreed to pay Martinez $8,000 a month in child support and 4.3% of all income she makes above $2 million.\n\nBerry is also footing the bill for Maceo's private school tuition, his extracurricular activities, his health insurance and his therapist.\n\nBerry and Martinez married in July 2013 and welcomed Maceo in October 2013. The couple filed for divorce in October 2015.\n\n\"The public documents filed in the matter should speak for themselves. The parties wanted more clarity in regards to Maceo's schedule and each of their respective time with their son,\" Martinez's attorney Matthew K. Skarin told USA TODAY in a statement Wednesday.\n\nTheir physical custody agreement outlines that Maceo will split time with his parents during the week, and the former pair will alternate custody of Maceo on the weekends. Exceptions to the agreement are for school holidays (which alternates custody for the entire break depending on the year), Maceo's birthday, Mother's Day and Father's Day.\n\nWhen Maceo is at one custodial parent's house, he is allowed one phone call or video communication before bedtime with the other custody parent, but it \"shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\"\n\nHalle Berry has Barbie-themed 57th birthday with 'not so mini anymore' daughter Nahla\n\nMaceo has also been suggested individual and family counseling \"no more than two times per month on Halle's custodial time\" amid the divorce. Berry and her daughter Nahla, who she shares with ex Gabriel Aubry, are allowed to attend these sessions. However, the documents prohibit the \"Bruised\" star's current partner Van Hunt from participating.\n\nThe agreement also outlines decorum for Berry and Martinez. \"Neither Party shall speak in a negative, disrespectful disparaging, or derogatory manner to, or about, the other Party or her/his family and/or significant other, or allow third parties to do same, to Maceo, in the presence of Maceo, or within Maceo's hearing range,\" the document states, and not in public or on social media."
