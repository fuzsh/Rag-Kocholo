He’s scheduled to appear in court Dec. 13.\n\nAubry came to Berry’s house Thanksgiving morning and police responded to a report of an assault, said Los Angeles Police Officer Julie Boyer. Aubry was injured in the altercation and was taken to a hospital where he was treated and released.\n\nEmails sent to Berry’s publicist, Meredith O’Sullivan, and Aubry’s family law attorney, Gary Fishbein, were not immediately returned.\n\nBerry and Aubry have been involved in a custody dispute involving their 4-year-old daughter, Nahla. The proceedings were sealed because the former couple are not married. Both appeared in the case as recently as Nov. 9, but neither side commented on the outcome of the hearing.\n\nBerry has been dating French actor Olivier Martinez, and he said earlier this year that they are engaged.\n\nOriginally Published: November 23, 2012 at 5:06 p.m."
