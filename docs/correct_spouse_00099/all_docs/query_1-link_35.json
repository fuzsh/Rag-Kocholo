        "text": "Originally Posted by LovelyinLa\n\nThe \"tragic mulatto\" term is offensive and outdated, even on Wiki it mentions it's during slavery, why do you even know this? I'm not biracial but I'm sure someone who is would be just as offended. They're biracial, not mulatto's anyway. Personally, I've never even heard of this term and I think it speaks volumes about those of you who not only use it but want to put this label on someone else.\n\nBack to Halle, she is like a lot of beautiful women with low self-esteem issues. They constantly pick the wrong men. One of the men she dated prior to becoming famous beat her so badly, she lost her hearing in one ear. I can't speak to David Justice but her second husband admitted to being a sex addict so she didn't make that up either. As for why she stayed with Gabriel, my guess would be she was like a lot of women in their late 30's and early 40's who want children so badly that they will put up with just about anything from a man so they can get what they want. It's desperation pure and simple. But a lot of women do this.\n\nAs the saying goes \" you can't love someone else, until you learn to love yourself\". Until she learns to love and value herself she will always float from one man to another looking for something that she can only give herself, that's a sense of self worth. I for one am not going to judge either one of them until I get more info. The thing that makes me wonder about Gabriel is the way he's \"charging\" her for watching their child while she's filming. Supposedly it's because he's missing work but he's not working anyway. It seems, that right now, the bulk of his income is coming from her. So not only does she have to cover his travel expenses, she have to pay him for babysitting his child. That's terrible. Nope, I'm not naive enough to believe he's some innocent angel and Halle is just a terror. The truth is always somewhere in the middle.\n\nHopefully, they can get it together enough for their child and take this out of the media.\n\nBut, Berry adds, \"I feel like she's black. I'm black and I'm her mother, and I believe in the one-drop theory.\"\n\nRegardless, the actress acknowledges that being biracial isn't easy.\n\n\"If you're of multiple races, you have a different challenge, a unique challenge of embracing all of who you are but still finding a way to identify yourself, and I think that's often hard for us to do,\" she explains. \"I identify as a black woman, but I've always had to embrace my mother and the white side of who I am, too. By choosing, I've often [wondered], â€˜Well, would that make her feel like I'm invalidating her by choosing to identify more with the black side of myself?'\""
