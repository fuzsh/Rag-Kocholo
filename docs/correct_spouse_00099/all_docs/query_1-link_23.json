        "text": "Halle Berry has reportedly managed to cap the amount of additional child support she has to pay to Gabriel Aubry after a decade-long legal battle.\n\nThe 56-year-old Monster’s Ball actress shares Nahla, 15, with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry, and her son Maceo, 10, with ex-husband Olivier Martinez.\n\nFollowing Halle and Gabriel’s split, the pair were embroiled in a legal battle after a judge reportedly ruled in 2014 that she pay $16,000 (£11,600) per month in child support to her ex-boyfriend.\n\nIn 2021, Halle reportedly succeeded in slashing that to $8,000 (£6,479) a month, but still had to cough up an additional 4.3 percent of any yearly income she made over $1.95million (£1.69mill).\n\nNow, according to the Daily Mail, Halle has managed to cap that additional amount at $4.5million (£3.6mill) in total.\n\n‘Halle shall continue to pay Gabriel 4.3% of any income she receives above $1.95 million, as and for additional child support for Nahla, however, any additional payments of child support pursuant to this Paragraph shall not exceed $109,650 per year, which is the difference between 4.3% of $1.95 million and $4.5 million,’ the filing, obtained by the publication, states.\n\n‘The parties agree that additional child support over and above $109,650 per year would exceed Nahla’s reasonable needs.’\n\nSo the most Halle will have to pay each year in additional to regular monthly payments will be around $110,000 per year.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Halle is worth $90million (£72mill).\n\nBack in 2021, speaking out about the issue, Halle said: ‘I feel if a woman or a man is having to pay support that is way more than they reasonably need to help support the child, I think that is wrong.’\n\nShe continued: ‘I understand some parents (man or woman) may need help, but I feel in these modern times both men and women have the responsibility to financially take care of their children and work hard and make every effort to do so.\n\n‘The way many laws are set up, people are allowed to use children in order to be awarded money to live a lifestyle that not only did they not earn, but that is way above and beyond the child’s reasonable needs and that is “the wrong” and where I see the abuse.’\n\nThe Oscar-winner stated: ‘This is just my opinion I clearly don’t own the truth. I can say i’m living it everyday and I can tell you it’s hard. I do totally understand the feelings of those men who feel they are and have been taken advantage of by the system.’\n\nIn her attempt to decrease the payments, a document submitted on Halle’s behalf reportedly stated: ‘There is no case, no law, no logic that says a healthy, active man gets to simply live off child support that the wealthier mother earns.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Halle Berry is full of gorgeous love for her nearly name twin Halle Bailey: ‘I adore you’"
