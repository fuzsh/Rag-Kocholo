        "text": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Instead of giving thanks Thursday, a fight broke out at Oscar award-winner Halle Berry's house.\n\nOfficers responded to the home around 10 a.m. following reports of an assault.\n\nBerry's ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry was arrested after allegedly getting into a brawl with the actress' fiancé French actor Olivier Martinez.\n\nAubry was at Berry's house to drop off their 4-year-old daughter, Nahla, following a custodial visit.\n\nLAPD said Berry's security had to restrain Martinez to stop the fight.\n\nBoth men were taken to Cedars Sinai Medical Center, according to police.\n\nTMZ reported Aubry suffered fractured ribs and a bruised face, while Martinez injured his hand and neck.\n\nAubry was then arrested and booked on a misdemeanor battery charge, officials said.\n\nThe male model posted $20,000 bail.\n\nA Los Angeles judge issued an emergency protective order against him, which demands he stay at least 100 yards away from Martinez, Berry and his daughter, according to TMZ.\n\nAubry and Berry broke up in 2010 and are going through a custody battle.\n\nA few weeks ago, a judge denied actress' request to move Nahla to France.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nIt's Official: Halle Berry To Marry A Third Time"
