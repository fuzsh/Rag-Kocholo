        "text": "Halle Berry and her ex, Gabriel Aubry, are back in court over child support payments (again). Berry is reportedly seeking a reduction in child support payments—from $16,000 to $3,000 per month—for the couple’s 7-year-old daughter, Nahla. The former couple has joint custody of their daughter, and this is the second time they have duked it out in court over child support. [BET]\n\nWe officially have our first glimpse of the newest member of the Curry family! Just days after NBA MVP Steph Curry and his wife, Ayesha, announced the birth of their new daughter, Ryan Carson, Steph shared a pic of the baby girl on Instagram. “I’m wayyyyyyy up I feel blessed!” Curry said on Instagram. Congrats to the happy family! [Entertainment Tonight]\n\nWhen Brandy sings, you listen, right? Apparently not if you’re a New Yorker. The legendary singer (who is also currently starring in Chicago on Broadway) performed incognito on a New York City subway earlier this week, and not a single person paid her any attention. Brandy, come to our neighborhood, and we will definitely show up and show out! [People]\n\nWNBA player Glory Johnson is seeking $20,000 per month in spousal support from her soon-to-be ex-wife Brittney Griner. The couple tied the knot in May, but Griner announced just last month that she would be seeking an annulment from Johnson, who is currently pregnant with twins. According to Johnson’s attorney, Griner has “far superior control over the family’s financial resources…[Johnson is] without the necessary financial means to pay for legal representation in this matter.” [ESPN]\n\nLeela James and Raheem DeVaughn are partnering up and hitting the road. The two R&B legends just announced The Love ‘n Soul Experience, a 25-city tour scheduled to kick off on October 7 in Charleston S.C. To top it all off, Empire songstress V. Bozeman is opening for the duo. We will be there!\n\nWait… we thought Fantasia was already married! The singer posted a pic flaunting her (ultra-fit) bod on Instagram earlier this week, saying that her trainer was about to work her hard in prep for her “big wedding day” on Saturday to her boo Kendall Taylor. “I never thought this would happen for me… I’m going to stay tight and right for him. Mr. Taylor,” she wrote. Fantasia has hinted in the past that the two already tied the knot last year, but apparently, she was simply fooling us all. [E! Online]\n\nOh, lawd. DMX is behind bars. Again. The rapper was arrested last month for owing $400,000 in back child support. He was sentenced to six months in county jail, and he’ll be serving his sentence in the Erie County Jail in Buffalo, N.Y. [The Guardian]"
