        "text": "Halle Berry and ex Olivier Martinez, ten years after they first got married and eight after they split, have just now finalized their divorce.\n\nThe former couple first met on the set of Dark Tide back in 2010, and share a son, Maceo-Robert Martinez, who is nine years old.\n\nDespite having split in 2015 – and Halle is currently in a relationship with Van Hunt – the two had a years-long court battle over their divorce, concerning child support and custody over their son.\n\nTMZ now reports that according to new court documents filed in L.A. County Superior Court, the two have at last finalized their divorce, and have agreed to joint legal and physical custody of Maceo.\n\nHalle – who also warred with ex Gabriel Aubrey child support and custody arrangements over their daughter Nahla – has reportedly landed on a similar child support agreement to that she has with Gabriel.\n\nTMZ reports she'll have to pay Olivier $8,000 a month – her initial monthly payment to Gabriel was $16,000, though now it's also $8k – and also similar to her agreement with her ex-boyfriend, she'll have to pay an additional 4.3 percent of all income she receives above $2 million.\n\nThe outlet also claims the documents include the agreement that Maceo will be attending family counseling, from which Halle's boyfriend Van is barred from attending.\n\nMORE: Halle Berry's doppelgänger daughter Nahla, 15, towers above her mom as they celebrate her 57th birthday\n\nMORE: 10 of Halle Berry's bombshell bikini moments: From Bond Girl to beach dates\n\nFurthermore, the nine-year-old will reportedly split his weeks equally between his mom and dad, and will alternate his time with them on weekends. Halle is also responsible for covering all of her son's private school tuition, plus all extracurricular activities.\n\nBack in 2012, when they were engaged, Olivier and Halle were ensnared in a legal battle against her ex Gabriel when she expressed her wishes to move to France with Olivier, along with then four-year-old Nahla.\n\nThe dispute boiled over into violence when Gabriel and Olivier were engaged in a physical fight, and Olivier was granted an emergency protective order preventing Gabriel from coming within 100 yards of Halle and Nahla; Gabriel in turn obtained a restraining order from Olivier.\n\nAlmost ten years later in 2021, she slammed the child support agreement she had with Gabriel when she shared a photo on Instagram that read: \"Women don't owe you [expletive],\" and then she wrote in the comments section: \"It takes great strength [eryday] to pay it. And BTW it's wrong and it's extortion!\" adding: \"I've been paying it for a decade now. I feel if a woman or man is having to pay support that is way more than the reasonable needs to help SUPPORT the child, I think that is wrong!\"\n\nMORE: Halle Berry reveals epic hair transformation in au naturel photo: 'My man loves this'\n\nShe continued: \"I understand some parents (man or woman) may need help, but I also feel in these modern times both men and women have the responsibility to financially take care of their children and work hard and make every effort to do so.\n\n\"The way many laws are set up, people are allowed to USE children in order to be awarded money to live a lifestyle that not only did they not earn, but that is way above and beyond the child's reasonable needs.\""
