        "text": "Halle Berry Kids: Halle Berry is a mother to daughter Nahla Ariela and son Maceo-Robert.\n\nHalle became a mom in 2008 when she had her first child, Nahla Ariela Aubry, with her ex Gabriel Aubry in March 2008. Her son, Maceo-Robert Martinez, was born five years later with her ex-husband Olivier Martinez.\n\nHalle and Olivier’s divorce was finalized in August 2023. According to court documents, Halle agreed to pay $8,000 a month in child support and cover the cost of her son’s private school tuition.\n\nHalle earned “cool mom” points by introducing her son Maceo, now 10 years old, to David Beckham after an Inter Miami game against LA Galaxy. The happy moment was captured in photos and videos that Halle shared on Instagram.\n\nHere’ everything to know about Halle Berry Kids: Nahla Ariela and Maceo-Robert.\n\nAll About Halle Berry 2 Kids\n\nHalle Berry has two kids: Nahla Ariela Aubry, born in March 2008 with Gabriel Aubry, and Maceo-Robert Martinez, born in 2013 with Olivier Martinez. Halle and Olivier divorced in August 2023, with Halle paying $8,000 a month in child support and covering Maceo’s private school tuition. Recently, Halle made Maceo happy by introducing him to David Beckham after an Inter Miami game, sharing the moment on Instagram.\n\nKeep reading to know more about the X-Men actress Halle Berry kids.\n\nNahla Ariela Aubry, 16\n\nNahla Ariela Aubry, the eldest child of Halle Berry, was born on March 16, 2008, making her 16 years old as of 2024. Her father, Gabriel Aubry, is a Canadian model who met Halle during a Versace photoshoot. This connection marked the beginning of their relationship, which eventually led to Nahla’s birth.\n\nStanding around 5’2″ as a teenager, Nahla has inherited both her parents’ good looks and their height, as her father Gabriel is notably tall at about 6’2″. She has often been seen in public with her mother, attending various events and enjoying casual outings, reflecting a normal childhood as much as possible given her mother’s fame. Nahla’s early years were marked by her parents’ high-profile custody battle following their separation in 2010. Despite these challenges, both parents have emphasized their commitment to her upbringing, focusing on providing a stable and loving environment. They have successfully co-parented, attending school events and sharing responsibilities.\n\nAs of now, Nahla is likely attending high school and possibly exploring her interests, which might include arts or sports, given her parents’ backgrounds—her mother in acting and her father in modeling.\n\nAlso Check – Jennifer Lopez Kids (All you Need to Know about Emme and Max)\n\nMaceo-Robert Martinez, 10\n\nMaceo Robert Martinez, the younger child of Halle Berry, was born on October 5, 2013. As of 2024, he is 10 years old. His father is Olivier Martinez, a French actor whom Berry married in 2013. The name “Maceo” means “Gift of God,” a name chosen to signify the joy and gratitude Berry and Martinez felt at his arrival.\n\nMaceo was born in Los Angeles, California, and his birth was particularly significant for Berry, who was 47 at the time, highlighting her continued commitment to expanding her family later in life. His birth not only brought happiness but also added a new layer of complexity and joy to Berry’s life, emphasizing her role as a nurturing mother dedicated to her children. Maceo has been occasionally spotted in public with his mother during various outings, such as park visits and trips around their Los Angeles neighborhood. These glimpses suggest a childhood filled with normal activities, shielded as much as possible from the Hollywood limelight.\n\nPhysically, Maceo is still growing but currently stands at a height typical for a boy his age, around 4’5″. Like his sister, Nahla, Maceo has features that resemble both of his parents, and as he grows, it’s likely he will share more of their physical characteristics.\n\nCurrently, Maceo is presumably in elementary school. Details about his school life or specific interests are kept private, aligning with Berry’s protective stance over her children’s exposure to media. However, given his mother’s and father’s artistic backgrounds, it’s possible that Maceo may develop an interest in the arts or sports.\n\nAlso Check –\n\nJulia Robert and Danny Moder 3 Kids\n\nMichael Jackson’s Kids: Prince Michael Jackson, Paris Jackson, Bigi Jackson\n\nMegan Fox Kids\n\nElon Musk Children\n\nConclusion\n\nHalle Berry kids, Nahla Ariela Aubry and Maceo-Robert Martinez, are a central part of her life.
