        "text": "Halle Berry and her third husband, Olivier Martinez, have officially concluded their divorce after nearly eight arduous years battling in court. The Oscar winner and the French actor, both 57, initially decided to divorce in October 2015 after two years of marriage. However, their separation was prolonged due to custody issues.\n\nCourt documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and acquired by Page Six outline their settlement terms. Berry, ordered to pay $8,000 monthly in child support for their 9-year-old son, Maceo, also faces an additional 4.3 percent of income exceeding $2 million as \"additional child support.\" She is also required to cover Maceo's private school expenses.\n\nBerry's voluntary commitment of $55,000 towards Martinez's attorney's fees, although not binding, showcases her willingness to cooperate. The custody agreement allots equal time to both parents, with alternating weekdays and weekends.\n\nThe couple's joint 2013 statement emphasized their shared focus on their son's well-being. Prior to Martinez, Berry was married twice, to David Justice and Eric Ben√©t, and shares a daughter, Nahla, with Gabriel Aubry.\n\nHalle tries to find love again\n\nBerry's openness about the challenges of marriage adds a candid touch to the narrative. In 2017, she shared, \"As women, we go into marriage thinking it's going to last forever... I'm kind of anti-fairy tales today.\"\n\nIn 2021, Berry's perspective shifted as she proclaimed her current boyfriend, Van Hunt, as the \"love of [her] life,\" stating, \"Because I failed so many times, I now know what [love] really looks like.\" The narrative strikes a balance between candid reflection and a hopeful outlook.\n\nThe divorce saga's conclusion paints a picture of financial responsibilities, custody agreements, and personal growth, showcasing the complex and evolving nature of relationships."
