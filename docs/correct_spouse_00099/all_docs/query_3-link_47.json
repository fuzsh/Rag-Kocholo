        "text": "Gabriel Aubry is a Canadian-American model, best known as the ex-partner of Halle Berry and father of their daughter, Nahla Ariela Aubry. The 6 foot 2” model of Canadian origin, Gabriel has been called one of the ‘Most Beautiful People’ by People magazine. His green eyes, blonde hair and androgynous look, made him one of the most sought after faces for hi-fashion brands like Versace, Tommy Hilfiger, Valentino, DKNY, Calvin Klein and Massimo Dutti, to name a few. A self-confessed shy person in real life, Gabriel has had a difficult childhood. Although he comes from a big family, having eight siblings, but he spent most of his early years in foster homes. This is one of the reasons he is very protective about his daughter Nahla. He enjoys playing golf and is a regular in celebrity tournaments. He is also fond of music and plays the guitar. He has played the guitar for a few songs for an album he produced and acted in, for his restaurant."
