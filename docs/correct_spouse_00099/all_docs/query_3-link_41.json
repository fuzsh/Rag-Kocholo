        "text": "At the end of October, Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez announced they were divorcing after just two years of marriage.\n\n“It is with a heavy heart that we have come to [this] decision,” the actors said in a joint statement. “We move forward with love and respect for one another.”\n\nBut if Berry’s past — and the aggressive divorce lawyers each has hired — is any indication, the parting will be anything but amicable. Martinez is her third husband and second baby-daddy and just the latest in a string of bitter breakups and ugly legal battles for the Oscar-winning actress.\n\nThe common denominator of all the drama is, of course, Berry herself — leaving many wondering why the beauty has such a beastly record with relationships.\n\n“She has always looked for ‘alpha males,’ but after this divorce, she’s going to need a long period of self-reflection before she hooks up with anyone else,” a Berry friend tells The Post.\n\nHere, a selective, sordid history of Berry’s recent relationships.\n\nDavid Justice\n\nMarried 1993 to 1997\n\nBerry’s first marriage, to former Yankee David Justice, ended with her filing a restraining order against him. Now, following the Berry-Martinez divorce announcement, he’s come out swinging on social media.\n\nHe is particularly incensed that Berry — who has spoken openly of being in an abusive relationship in which she was hit so hard that she lost 80 percent of her hearing in one ear — never made it clear to the public that he wasn’t her abuser.\n\n“She was mad at me leaving the relationship so she and her Hollywood Team just tried to destroy my character. It had to be my fault, right? Yup . . . Me, Eric, Gabriel and Olivier were all her ‘Knight in Shining Armor’, until it ends . . . Then we all become the worst guys in history. Only the guys in the relationship with Halle know the real deal . . . there will be another, of course. He’ll be called ‘The Best’ until it ends,” he recently tweeted.\n\nHe signed off with a warning to Berry’s most recent ex, Martinez. “Just wait, Olivier . . . It’s coming!”\n\nBerry’s second husband, Eric Benét, piled on, tweeting: “My man @23davidjustice is tweeting some truth dis mornin’!”\n\nJustice also used the platform to remove his name from the rumor mill of abusers — and add a new one.\n\n“When she first reported that she had been in abusive relationships, she wouldn’t name the ‘famous’ former boyfriend (WS),” he tweeted.\n\nWhile it was unclear whom, exactly, Justice was referring to, Berry dated Wesley Snipes in 1990.\n\nThe actress was none too happy with the online outbursts from her exes.\n\n“Halle was pissed that these guys, who she hadn’t spoken to in years, took advantage of her divorce announcement,” a Berry friend tells The Post. “She thought it was totally rude and ungallant.”\n\nEric Benét\n\nMarried 2001 to 2005\n\nThe actress’s second union, to R&B singer-songriter Benét, ended amid his admission that he had cheated on her.\n\nBut a source close to Benét says the singer was unfairly maligned.\n\n“He has always been painted as the villain — the sex addict who broke Halle’s heart,” the insider says. “She had a major part to play in their problems, too, and Eric feels as though she should acknowledge that.”\n\nWhile they were married, it was reported that Berry had adopted Benét’s young daughter India, who lost her mother in a car accident when she was just 15 months old. (She’s now 24.)\n\n“I’m all [India’s] got as far as a mother goes. It feels as if she’s my own,” the actress told an interviewer while married to Benét. “I don’t think anything’s going to prevent us from having a mother-daughter relationship. We’re very close, and I will always be there for her.”\n\nFollowing the divorce, the mother-daughter relationship seemed to quickly dissipate. In 2006, Benét told The Post that Berry no longer saw his daughter. “Halle used to insist she loved India, though she hasn’t seen her and has barely communicated with her in years, and not because I’ve stopped her,” he said.\n\nA Berry friend says the situation wasn’t straightforward.\n\n“Her divorce from Eric was very acrimonious and as much as she hoped to stay in India’s life, it just didn’t work out that way.”\n\nGabriel Aubry\n\nDated 2005 to 2010\n\nBerry met the hunky Canadian model while shooting a Versace campaign and had her first child, daughter Nahla, with him three years into their relationship.\n\nA friend of hers says it was an incredibly tempestuous relationship and that neither of them was willing to back down when they argued.\n\n“It was a case of two ‘alphas’ in a relationship, each wanting their own way and not being prepared to compromise,” the source says. When Nahla arrived, “they were both smitten with her but they grew more and more distant from one another. The arguments continued and they knew it wasn’t the best environment to raise a little girl in.”\n\nThe fighting continued long after the relationship ended, as the exes attempted co-parenting while Berry started a new life with Martinez.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day in 2012, Aubry dropped Nahla off at Berry’s Los Angeles home and had a fight with Martinez that sent both men to the emergency room. Aubry suffered facial cuts and a fractured rib, while former welterweight boxer Martinez sustained injuries to his hand.\n\nBoth parties claimed that the other had instigated the vicious fight. Aubry was charged with misdemeanor battery, but in court papers, the model claimed that Martinez had taunted him the previous day, while the warring family was watching Nahla’s school play.\n\n“I wish I could beat the s - - t out of you right now,” Martinez was alleged to have said. “You’re lucky we’re in a school right now. We’re going to take Nahla right now and you’re not going to follow us.”\n\nAubry claimed that Martinez was furious at the custody ruling, which meant that he and Berry were forced to stay in LA, instead of moving to France in hopes of avoiding the paparazzi.\n\n“You cost us $3 million,” Aubry alleged that Martinez said. “When you see the judge, you’re going to tell him you’re going to Paris or I’m going to kill you.”\n\nMartinez insisted that Aubry attacked him, unprovoked, and although both parties initially sought restraining orders, no charges were filed and a child-custody arrangement was finalized just days after the brawl.\n\n“Halle was devastated after the fight,” a friend reveals. “She rushed Nahla into the house so she didn’t see her dad and Olivier acting like wild animals. She knew that both Gabriel and Olivier had hot tempers, but she was furious with them for reacting in such a juvenile way.”\n\nWhile Berry blamed Aubry for instigating the brawl, she was still “mad” at Martinez in the aftermath. “She felt that he could have handled it in a different way — called the police, walked away,” the friend adds. “She has a pretty hot temper herself, but violence is the one thing she will not tolerate.”\n\nOlivier Martinez\n\nMarried 2013 to 2015 (divorce pending)\n\nMartinez and Berry appeared to have put their differences behind them when they exchanged vows in July 2013 — just three months before Berry delivered their “miracle” son, Maceo. “I didn’t think it was possible,” Berry told Ellen DeGeneres of discovering she was pregnant at age 46.\n\nWhile Martinez — who is best known for the 2002 movie “Unfaithful” and starred with Berry in 2010’s “Dark Tide” — was “delighted” to become a first-time father, an insider says, parenthood merely fueled existing tensions in the increasingly volatile relationship.\n\n“Halle was the primary breadwinner — and for a proud Gallic man, that was an issue. Being known as ‘Halle Berry’s husband’ really started to grate with him. On the flip side, she thought he should be more grateful for his lifestyle, and more supportive.”\n\nMartinez’s ‘explosive’ temper was evident in January, when he used his toddler son’s car seat to push an employee at Los Angeles’s LAX airport while the family made their way through a paparazzi swarm. The worker is now suing the couple for $5 million and Berry, according to the insider, was “incensed” by her then-husband’s inability to control his emotions.\n\nAnd while the former couple said they “wish each other nothing but happiness” in a statement, there’s evidence to the contrary.\n\nDespite what legal sources insist is an “iron-clad” prenuptual agreement, which was drawn up to protect Berry’s $70 million fortune, Martinez and Berry have filed individual divorce petitions, with both citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split.\n\nThe pair have also appointed notably aggressive divorce lawyers: Berry hired Stephen Kolodny, who has represented Mel Gibson and billionaire Kirk Kerkorian’s ex-wife Lisa Bonder Kerkorian, while Martinez has retained Laura Wasser, whose celebrity client roster has included Tom Cruise and Britney Spears.\n\n“There are a lot of issues to be ironed out,” an associate of Martinez’s tells The Post. “Olivier is determined to be a very involved father to his son, and he’s prepared to fight tooth and nail in court if it gets to that.”"
