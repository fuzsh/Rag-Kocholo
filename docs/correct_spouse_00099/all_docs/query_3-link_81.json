        "text": "LOS ANGELES (WLS) -- Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez are divorcing after two years of marriage, ABC News reports.\n\nThe couple issued a joint statement to ABC News that says, \"It is with a heavy heart that we have come to the decision to divorce. We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus of what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life and we hope that you respect our, and most importantly, our children's privacy as we go through this difficult period.\"\n\nBerry and Martinez began dating in 2010 after co-starring in the movie \"Dark Tide.\" They got engaged in 2012 and revealed they were expecting a child in 2013. They were married in France in July 2013.\n\nTheir son, Maceo, was born shortly after their wedding in October of 2013. Berry also has a daughter, Nahla, from her previous relationship with model Gabriel Aubry.\n\nThis was Berry's third marriage; she was previously married to baseball player David Justice from 1993 to 1997 and to actor Eric Benet from 2001 to 2005. It was Maritnez's first marriage."
