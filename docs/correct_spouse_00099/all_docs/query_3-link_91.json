        "text": "It's been a rocky road to love and back for Halle Berry and her ex Gabriel Aubry.\n\nAnd the drama didn't end for the pair when they called time on their relationship back in 2010.\n\nAs the 48-year-old Hollywood actress accused her former boyf of 'trying to make their daughter look white', we take a look back and the ups and downs of their relationship so far.\n\nSplit - 2010\n\nMonster Ball beauty Halle starting dating model hunk Gabriel back in 2006 and two years later they welcomed daughter Nahla.\n\nTheir love didn't last and five years after they first started dating they called it a day, with reports suggesting it was down to their nine-year age gap.\n\nThings appeared to end on good terms and both promised to \"remain friends and committed parents to their daughter\".\n\n39-year-old Gabriel also spoke out at the time to say: \"She is, and will forever be, one of the most special and beautiful people that I have ever known, and I am certain that we will continue to have only love and respect for one another.\"\n\nGabriel later went on to have a fling with Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe pair parted ways after a short time and Kimmie began dating her future husband Kris Humphries.\n\nCustody battle - 2011\n\nA year later the exes became locked in a legal battle when Halle attempted to move their daughter to France to relocate with her then-fiancé, Kylie Minogue's ex Olivier Martinez.\n\nHalle claimed a permanent move to Paris would be in the best interests for her little girl because she would be better protected from paparazzi there.\n\nA judge blocked the move.\n\nBust-up - 2011\n\nThe same year both Olivier and Gabriel were treated for injuries in hospital after an altercation.\n\nReports at the time claimed the pair had a bust-up following a normal custodial hand-off on the driveway of Halle's home.\n\nHalle has another baby - 2013\n\nHalle and her French actor hubby Olivier welcomed a son in October last year but that still wasn't the end of her troubles with Gabriel.\n\nHalle ordered to pay $16,000 a month - 2014\n\nFour years after they split a judge approved a settlement which saw the Oscar-winning actress paying $16,000 a month for child support for their 6-year-old daughter.\n\nAs well as the cash, which amounts to nearly $200,000 a year, the star was also told to pick up the bill for their daughter's tuition.\n\nHalle asks for the payments to be dropped by 80% - 2014\n\nHalle soon filed documents asking to reduce the chil support payments by 80 per cent, because she claimed Gabriel had given up work and was living solely off what she paid him, according to TMZ.\n\nHalle reportedly noted in the documents that her former flame - with whom she shares equal joint custody of their little girl - is \"perfectly capable\" of getting a job and the reduced payments will still allow Nahla to live a comfortable life.\n\nHalle accuses Gabriel of trying to make their daughter 'look white' - 2014\n\nTheir relationship took a new twist this week when Halle claimed her ex straightened their daughter's hair and highlighted it to make her look less African-American.\n\nIn a court hearing yesterday, a judge ruled that neither parent can change Nahla’s natural hair texture or colour.\n\n“I want both Gabriel and I to make decisions together that affect our daughter, her growth, her development and her general welfare,” Halle said in the court documents.\n\n“I continue to hope that Gabriel and I can find a way to work together to be successful co-parents.\n\n\"It was with regret that I concluded that I had to seek the court's intervention on these issues, but until Gabriel recognises the meaning of joint legal custody and how it is implemented, it appears that the court will be my only resort to safeguard Nahla's best interests.\"\n\nBefore her five year relationship with Gabriel, Halle was hitched to R&B singer Eric Benet from 2001 until they separated in 2003 and divorced in 2005.\n\nBefore Eric she was married to baseball player David Justice for four years."
