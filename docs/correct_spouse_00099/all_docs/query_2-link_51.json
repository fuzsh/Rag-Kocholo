        "text": "HALLE Berry accused her ex Gabriel Aubry of \"extorting\" her with the child support of their 12-year-old daughter, Nahla.\n\nThe Oscar winner, 54, said it's \"wrong\" that she pays the Canadian model, 45, to \"live a lifestyle that he didn't earn.\"\n\nHalle initially shared a post on Instagram that read: \"Women don't owe you s**t.\"\n\nA follower commented underneath: \"She owes that alimony and child support to that cracker who called her the n-word though.\"\n\nHalle hit back: \"And it takes great strength everyday to pay it. And btw it's wrong and it's extortion.\"\n\nBack in 2011, TMZ alleged that Gabriel called Halle the racial slur alongside expletives like \"you f**king b***h\" in person and in \"demeaning\" texts.\n\nHalle - who also has a 7-year-old son, Maceo, with her ex-husband, Olivier Martinez - then expanded on her views about child support.\n\nShe explained: \"I'm not going to speak on alimony as I have never asked for it, nor have I ever paid it.\n\n\"However, as for child support, I feel I can speak on it as I've been paying it for a decade now. I feel if a woman or a man is having to pay support that is way more than they reasonably need to help SUPPORT the child, I think that is wrong.\n\n\"I understand some parents (man or woman) may need help, but I feel in these modern times both men and women have the responsibility to financially take care of their children and work hard and make every effort to do so.\"\n\nThe former Bond girl continued: ''The way many laws are set up, people are allowed to USE children in order to be awarded money to live a lifestyle that not only did they not earn, but that is way above and beyond the child's reasonable needs and that is 'THE WRONG' and where I see the abuse.\n\nHalle filed court documents in 2014 asking a judge to reduce the amount of money she was paying Gabriel.\n\nThe star - who is currently dating singer Van Hunt - reportedly wanted to go from paying $16,000 a month to $3,800.\n\nA document submitted by the actress and her lawyer stated: \"There is no case, no law, no logic that says a healthy, active man gets to simply live off child support that the wealthier mother earns.\"\n\nIt is unclear if Halle is still paying Gabriel $16,000 or if the amount was reduced.\n\nHalle was also ordered in 2014 to pay Gabriel $300,000 to cover his legal costs and $115,000 retroactively in child support.\n\nThe X-Men star covers Nahla's tuition and the exes - who have equal custody of their youngster - split health fees.\n\nIn her Instagram comments, the Catwoman actress went on: \"The laws are outdated and no longer reflect the modern world.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is just my opinion, I clearly don't own the truth. I can say I'm living it every day and I can tell you it's hard.\n\n\"I do totally understand the feelings of those men who feel they are and have been taken advantage of by the system.\"\n\nHalle dated Gabriel from 2005 until their bitter split in 2010.\n\nA year later, the Monster's Ball star accused Gabriel of leaving Nahla unsupervised by the pool and of creating a situation at a London hotel where their daughter could have \"lost her life over a simple issue.\"\n\nThe judge turned down Halle's bid to move Nahla to France with her then-boyfriend Olivier Martinez.\n\nTwo weeks later, Gabriel and French actor Olivier had a brutal fist fight at Halle's California house.\n\nOlivier allegedly floored Gabriel and slammed his head on the driveway.\n\nGabriel, who came off worse in the fight, was taken to hospital but no charges were ever filed.\n\nHalle and Oliver wed in 2013 and had son Maceo before splitting two years later."
