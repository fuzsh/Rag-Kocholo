Two years later, he released an album named after his restaurant.\n\nGabriel Aubry's dating history\n\nAubry has walked the international runways for high-end brands like Versace and Ralph Lauren.

Kardashian was later seen with New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries.\n\nGabriel Aubry and Charlize Theron\n\nSouth African-born actress Charlize Theron was first romantically linked to the 47-year-old model in 2017 after being photographed together. The Italian Job star shut down the relationship rumours and claimed she had only met him briefly because their children attend the same school.\n\nHowever, in May 2022, it was reported that Gabriel and Charlize were an item, and it was stated that they were \"very casual and enjoying each other.\"\n\nDoes Halle Berry have any children?\n\nThe 57-year-old has two children: Nahla and Maceo-Robert Martinez. As mentioned earlier, the actress shares her daughter with Gabriel Aubry. She welcomed her second child, Maceo-Robert, with her husband, Olivier Martinez, in 2013.\n\nDid Halle Berry lose custody of her daughter?\n\nThe American actress has joint custody of her daughter after fighting for it in court. The Catwoman star was then engaged to actor Olivier Martinez and wanted to move to Paris, France, which is his native country.\n\nGabriel Aubry's relationship with Halle Berry and their ongoing legal battles have continued to make headlines over a decade since their breakup. The Hugo Boss model has had relationships with other women in the entertainment business, but none have led to marriage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Did Priscilla Presley ever remarry?
