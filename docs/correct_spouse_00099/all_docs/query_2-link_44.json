        "text": "Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez have put the finishing touches on their divorce after nearly eight years.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by RadarOnline, the Hollywood star will be shelling out $8,000 per month in child support to her former husband in order to care for their son Maceo, 8.\n\nThe former couple were married from 2013 until they announced the end of their romance in October 2015. In the original petition, Berry requested full custody of their son. However, the actor fought the Oscar winner, asking for joint custody. In 2016, they agreed to share physical and legal custody. However, the details were not completely ironed out.\n\nPer the recent legal filings, both \"Halle and Olivier have acknowledged to the other that by entering into a negotiated settlement of all custody and child support issues between them, each has knowingly waived her/his right to a full evidentiary hearing on the merits with respect to those issues.\"\n\nAccording to the agreement, Berry and Martinez must consult the other on critical life issues, such as any activities interfering with the other's time with the child.\n\nThe Moonfall star will also be allowed to include the boy in family therapy with her other child — daughter Nahla, 15, whom she shares with ex Gabriel Aubry. However, her current partner, Van Hunt,will not be allowed to be present for the sessions.\n\nAs for the specifics of the child support payments, Berry will hand over a total of $8,000 per month along with 4.3% of any income she receives above $2 million \"as and for additional child support for Maceo.\"\n\nMartinez will continue to foot the bill for their kid's private school in Los Angeles.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for the OK! newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer.
