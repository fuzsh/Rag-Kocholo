An email to Berry's rep was not immediately returned.\n\nActors who dated their TV family members\n\nBerry, 46, met Martinez, 47, in 2010 while filming Dark Tide. He proposed to Berry in early 2012 and the couple announced in April that they're expecting their first child together this fall. Berry is already mother to Nahla, 5, with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry, with whom Martinez famously brawled last Thanksgiving after Aubry allegedly attacked the Frenchman while dropping off Nahla.\n\nThis is Martinez's first marriage and Berry's third. She was previously married to baseball player David Justice and singer Eric Benet.\n\nView original Report: Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez Marry in France at TVGuide.com\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com"
