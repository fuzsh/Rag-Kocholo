Los Angeles - Oscar-winning screen star Halle Berry is expecting her first child with partner Gabriel Aubry, the actress confirmed to television show Access Hollywood on Tuesday.

Berry, 41, who scooped a best actress Academy Award in 2002 for her performance in Monster's Ball, told the entertainment news programme that she was three months into her pregnancy.

"Yes, I am three months pregnant," Berry said. "Gabriel and I are beyond excited and I've waited a long time for this moment in my life."

Berry and Aubry, 32, met shooting a fashion ad for Versace in November 2005 and began dating shortly afterwards.

'I will never marry again'

Earlier this year, the twice-married Berry told reporters she was keen to start a family but never wanted to tie the knot again.

"I will never, never get married again," she said. "Actually, it's just that now I've come to a place where I think two people can share their lives without the ring, without the piece of paper."
