Never say never! After swearing off matrimony six years ago, actress Halle Berry said "I do" once again on Saturday.

On Sunday, Berry's rep confirmed that she married French actor Olivier Martinez at the Chateau des Conde in Vallery, France.

Two got engaged in 2012. The marriage marks the third time down the aisle for Berry, who wed baseball player David Justice in 1993 (divorced in 1997) and married singer-songwriter Eric Benet in 2001 (divorced in 2005). This is the first marriage for Martinez.

Berry also has a child with former partner Gabriel Aubry. She's currently pregnant with her second child -- her first with Martinez.
