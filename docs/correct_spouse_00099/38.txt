HALLE Berry has split from Canadian model Gabriel Aubry, the father of her baby daughter and her partner of five years.

The twice-divorced Berry, 43, and Aubry, 34, have spent months hammering out a financial and custody arrangement, Radar Online reported.

“Gabriel just felt it wasn't working anymore," the website quoted a source as saying.

"When they were first together the 9-year age difference between them didn't faze him, she was the most beautiful woman he had ever dated and he was totally in love. But as time went on he started feeling it more and more.”

Radar quoted the source as saying they had settled on joint custody of their daughter, Nahla Ariela Aubry, born in March 2008.

"Halle was terrified that Gabriel would go after her money," the source said. "But he's a decent and proud guy and that's just not his style.”
