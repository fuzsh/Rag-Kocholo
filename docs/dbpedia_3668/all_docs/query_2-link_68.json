        "text": "New signing Stephen Mallon is available for selection for the first time as John Russell’s Sligo Rovers face Derry City at the Showgrounds on Thursday, kick off 7.45pm.\n\nSupporters are asked to note the change from the traditional game day.\n\nWinger Mallon, who signed last month, is available to play for the Bit O’Red from July 1st and goes straight into the match day squad.\n\nRovers have no fresh injury concerns following last week’s win over champions Shamrock Rovers.\n\nJohn Mahon and Conor Reynolds remain sidelined with respective achilles and leg knocks.\n\nRovers have a good recent record against the Candystripes in Sligo in recent years and have played out two draws against Ruadhiri Higgins’ team this year so far.\n\nRovers are further boosted by the signature on a permanent basis of defender Ollie Denham who signed an 18 month deal following the completion of a loan spell from Cardiff City.\n\nWhile goalkeeper Ed McGinty has committed himself to Sligo until the end of the season after his loan deal from Oxford was extended.\n\n“It’s going to be another tough game against a team chasing league silverware”, manger Russell said.\n\n“We put on a really impressive show against Shams last week and that performance showed we can play with the best the league has to offer.\n\n“There were chances at both ends in the first half, but second half we shut them out and took hold of the game thanks to two brilliant Simon Power goals.\n\n“That game is done now. We move on to Thursday and another team at the top of the table. We have almost a full squad to choose from now and we hope to keep as injury free as possible.\n\n“With a fully fit squad and everyone available to choose from, we’re a match for anyone.\n\n“Derry have threats from all sides and we have seen that in recent weeks and in the games we’ve played them in this year.\n\n“There’s a real feeling of positivity around the club at the moment and we’re looking to draw from that this Thursday.”"
