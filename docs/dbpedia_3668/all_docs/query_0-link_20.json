        "text": "An Introduction to Sports Chaplaincy\n\nWithin the Northern Ireland Football League at every club there is a myriad of talented people behind the scenes supporting the players week in and week out. From the manager, in the front line and his coaching and medical staff, the administrative staff, the scouts, the sponsors, the tea ladies, those who launder the kit, the groundsmen - the list goes on. Among these is the Club Chaplain.\n\nThe Sports Chaplain is increasingly becoming part and parcel of club life across the spectrum of not just football, but sport as a whole. The majority of the NI Football League clubs now have an appointed club Chaplain.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson, former Manchester United manager, said: \"Chaplains can be of help to all sorts of people involved with sport, when crisis, need, or difficulty comes. I commend the idea of sports chaplaincy and the work of Sports Chaplaincy UK to you.”\n\nGlentoran captain, Marcus Kane said: \"Our club chaplain helped me to gain a unique perspective on issues I had. He went above and beyond for me in my time of need.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland International Megan Bell said: \"There are so many things people don’t see going on in an athlete’s life away from the playing arena – and this is where the chaplain can play a pivotal role.\"\n\nNIFL CEO and former Cliftonville chairman, Gerard Lawlor said: \"Whilst I was chairman of Cliftonville FC, we benefited enormously from having Dario as chaplain and he has been of value to not only the players and staff but also the board.\"\n\nDavid Healy, Linfield Football Club manager and Northern Ireland record goalscorer, said: \"The value a club chaplain brings in supporting players and staff alike across the journey of life is something that we as a club have seen the benefit of and I commend the work of Sports Chaplaincy UK and Ireland within sport\"\n\nMarc Smyth, Head of Academy at Cliftonville FC and former Cliftonville FC captain, said: \"Everyone in a football club environment needs support and encouragement at some point on their journey and David has provided a welcome layer of support to everyone at Cliftonville in the Academy set up.\"\n\nDeclan Caddell, Head of Academy Crusaders FC, said: “In over 15 years as a player and now head of Academy at Crusaders FC, I and many at the club have benefited from the listening ear, care and compassion given by our chaplain Ken who has been an ever present help in trouble and an encouragement throughout.\"\n\nJordan Stewart, Linfield FC player, said: \"I was going through a difficult spell in my life with the loss of my sister and the decline of my performances on the pitch. Meeting with our club chaplain really helped me gain a fresh perspective on life and faith and his friendship I still value to this day.\"\n\nEthan Galbraith, Manchester United and Northern Ireland player, said: \"William was a tremendous help to me through challenges in my life and career and having an international team chaplain available all year means no matter where I play my club football, he is there for me. Highly recommend this support to all players.“\n\nMarissa Callaghan, Cliftonville and Northern Ireland captain, said: \"Being part of an international set up is an incredible experience. And of course it brings challenges along the way through injury and the disappointments that come around selection. We all need support on that journey and our chaplain Tracey has been a constant scource of encouragement to all the girls year round and has been amazing for us.\"\n\nRaymond Crangle, Irish FA senior referee, said: \"Being a referee brings its challenges just like it does for players and managers - we are all out there in the spotlight. And we all still have lives to lead away from the game. We are glad to have our chaplain Mark with us on our journey over the past few years. He has provided a listening ear, healthy input and has been a source of support for a number of the senior referees.”\n\nMichael McShane, Head coach Ards FC Disability Team, said: \"Everyone within the Ards FC set up have been terrifically encouraged and benefited enormously from the terrific support of our club chaplain Sam. Throughout our journey as a team, Sam has seamlessly enriched our close-knit support network for the players and staff alike.“\n\nConrad Kirkwood, Irish FA President, said: \"The Irish FA are proud to endorse and recommend this important and practical service provided by SCUK which has been made available to all Football Clubs in Northern Ireland and which we at the Association continue to benefit from.\"\n\nSports Chaplaincy UK (SCUK) has had the privilege of serving UK sport for over 30 years.\n\nThe charity started by John Boyers whilst serving as chaplain at Watford Football Club and who went on to become chaplain at Manchester United has been in existence for many years. They provide support to around 70% of the professional English and Welsh football clubs including Manchester City and Liverpool, plus almost all the professional and semi professional Scottish and Northern Irish Football League clubs and over 50% of the League of Ireland clubs in what is a new venture in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSo what is Sports Chaplaincy and what exactly does a club chaplain do?\n\nSports Chaplaincy is a Christian charity primarily aimed at the care and welfare of players and staff but also at the wider community of people within the club including supporters and families of players and staff. In the competitive world of sport it is recognised that there is a need for high quality pastoral and spiritual care regardless of age, ability or gender.\n\nWorking professionally, caring sensitively, demonstrating integrity and maintaining confidentiality are all the hallmarks of the Club Chaplain. Compassionate and resilient , each chaplain will bring with them a vast range of skills, knowledge and expertise to help build perspective and navigate individuals through areas such as uncertainty , injury and identity.\n\nChaplains are extremely supportive and bring a non-judgemental, listening ear and an empathetic and compassionate presence . As chaplains’ journey through life with all the staff at their club, they are able to provide pastoral support and spiritual care to everyone irrespective of faith tradition or no faith , through all the difficulties and challenges that life brings as well as being an encourager to all.\n\nSports Chaplaincy UK is the charity that trains, supports and helps facilitate the work of club chaplains within each setting. To this end, each chaplain will receive training covering issues ranging from safeguarding to the unique role of being a professional sportsperson and everything in between including specialised training in areas such as bereavement, trauma, addictions, family care , anxiety and stress and mental well being . They also partner and work with other organisations such as Sporting Chance, State of Mind and Care for the Family to ensure that individuals have access to the very best specialist care.\n\nFor more information on Sports Chaplaincy UK and Ireland, please CLICK HERE to download the Sports Chaplaincy Ireland brochure.\n\nThe full list of Chaplains for the 2024/2025 season is as follows;\n\nPremiership\n\nBallymena United - Alastair Beattie ([email protected]) and Trevor Kane ([email protected])\n\nCarrick Rangers - Stephen Smyth ([email protected])\n\nCliftonville - Dario Leal ([email protected]) and David Burke ([email protected])\n\nColeraine - Malcolm Ferry ([email protected])\n\nCrusaders - Frankie Weir ([email protected])\n\nDungannon Swifts - Matty Reid ([email protected])\n\nGlenavon - Paul Whittaker ([email protected])\n\nGlentoran - David Thompson ([email protected])\n\nLarne - Ian Cahoon ([email protected]) and Glenn Wilkinson ([email protected])\n\nLinfield - Paul Reid (p[email protected] )\n\nLoughgall - Dean Forbes ([email protected]) and Peter Smith\n\nPortadown - Wilson Beare ([email protected])\n\nChampionship\n\nAnnagh United - Jim Fleming ([email protected])\n\nArds - Sam Magill ([email protected])\n\nArmagh City - TBC\n\nBallinamallard United - Gordon Lee ([email protected])\n\nBallyclare Comrades - Robert Bell ([email protected])\n\nBangor - Gary Faulkner ([email protected]); Mark Johnston\n\nDundela - Danny Rankin ([email protected]) and David Rankin ([email protected])\n\nHW Welders - Robert Bailie ([email protected])\n\nInstitute - Simon McGonigle ([email protected])\n\nLimavady United - Geoff Ferris ([email protected])\n\nNewington - TBC\n\nNewry City - Conor McAleavey (cmcaleavey@sportschaplaincy.org.uk) and Scott McDonald ([email protected])\n\nPremier Intermediate League\n\nBallymacash Rangers - Andrew Thompson ([email protected])\n\nBanbridge Town - Bob McClughan ([email protected])\n\nCoagh United - Nevin Glendinning ([email protected])\n\nDergview - Peter Ferguson (pferguson@sportschaplaincy.org.uk), Ivan Gowdy and Stanley Baxter\n\nDollingstown - Stewart Quinn ([email protected])\n\nKnockbreda - Sam McBurney ([email protected])\n\nLimavady United - Geoff Ferris ([email protected])\n\nLisburn Distillery - Terry Moore ([email protected])\n\nMoyola Park - Colin Welsh ([email protected])\n\nOxford Sunnyside - TBC\n\nPortstewart - Paul Murphy ([email protected])\n\nQueens University - TBC\n\nRathfriland Rangers - TBC\n\nTobermore United - Luke Keys (lkeys@sportschaplaincy.org.uk)\n\nWarrenpoint Town - Andrew Burns ([email protected])\n\nWomen's Premiership\n\nCliftonville Ladies - TBC\n\nCrusaders Strikers - Jonny Redmond ([email protected] )\n\nDerry City Women - Charlene McGeehan ([email protected])\n\nGlentoran Women - Gail Redmond ([email protected])\n\nLarne Women - Joanne Fitzsimmons ([email protected])\n\nLinfield Women - James Bell ([email protected] ) and Rachel Kerr ([email protected])\n\nLisburn Ladies -Lois Curragh (lcurragh@sportschaplaincy.org.uk)\n\nLisburn Rangers Ladies - Lynne Gibson ([email protected])\n\nMid Ulster Ladies - Michael Currie ([email protected]) and Chloe McReynolds ([email protected])\n\nReferees"
