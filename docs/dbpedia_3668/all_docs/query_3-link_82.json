        "text": "Ohio State center Trevor Thompson’s future with the Buckeyes seems to be up in the air. The Indianapolis Star’s Kyle Neddenriep reported on Saturday afternoon that Thompson would be declaring for the draft.\n\nLater in the afternoon, the Columbus Dispatch’s Adam Jardy reported that the decision would come after the conclusion of the Buckeyes season.\n\nAfter the Buckeyes’ loss to Rutgers in the Big Ten Tournament, Thompson was noncommittal in returning to the Buckeyes. “I’m not really sure right now,” Thompson said. “I’m just frustrated right now. That’s what my focus is on. Only time will tell, I guess.”\n\nAfter last season, Thompson made himself eligible for the draft, but eventually opted to return to the Buckeyes. A recent NCAA rule change allowed Thompson, an underclassman, to enter his name into the NBA Draft without forfeiting his eligibility.\n\nThompson was a junior this past season, and could still return for a senior season based on the previously mentioned rule change. He will have until 10 days after the 2017 NBA Draft Combine to withdraw from the draft and still be eligible for his senior season."
