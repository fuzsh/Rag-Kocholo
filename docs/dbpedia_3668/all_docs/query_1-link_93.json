        "text": "It is closing in on a decade since I got the call to manage Derry City.\n\nI won’t lie. There was a certain appeal. Big club in a one-club city. It had a lot going for it.\n\nSomething nagged at me that day, though. In my head, I’d always thought of Derry as a cup team rather than a side that could win a league.\n\nAnd that hunch was backed up when I checked out their honours list.\n\nREAD MORE - James McClean is proof of the League of Ireland's potential\n\nThey were league title winners just once when they were an Irish League team and since they came south of the border to join the League of Ireland, in the 1985/86 season, they have managed just two championships.\n\nThink about this.\n\nA club founded in 1928 has won just three league titles (discounting the First Division) in 95 years. Shocking.\n\nTriumphs\n\nThey’re a Cup team. Six FAI Cups, three Irish Cups, an astonishing 11 League Cups, as well as a collection of minor cup triumphs in the City Cup, Gold Cup, Top Four Cup, is a reflection of what they are.\n\nGlamour boys. They love the big day.\n\nAny side can get lucky in the cup. History has shown, several times when a bad side has won a cup.\n\nHistory has never given us any evidence of an inadequate team bringing home a league.\n\nBut I know why previous Derry managers have paid so much attention to Cup runs. Because it buys you time.\n\nThe thing is that once you take on that job in the Brandywell, you surrender your privacy.\n\nDerry people make you welcome, don’t get me wrong. I felt at home in my seven months as manager.\n\n“Yes, Roddy,” strangers would say to you as you walked down the street.\n\nThey’d stop and talk. They’d give their opinion and advice for free.\n\nThat was fine at first. Eventually, it became suffocating.\n\nSo, I can see why managers would want a cup run, even if it is the League Cup. Get a trophy, get to a final, and you get a day out for the fans.\n\nThey love that. They can have the craic, sing their songs, shout and holler and roar and feel a civic pride in their city.\n\nAnd that’s fine.\n\nBut if you are a football manager, you want leagues rather than cups. You certainly don’t want a League Cup. I used to call it as useful as an egg cup. I’d never put a win in that on my CV because it didn’t matter.\n\nConsistency comes from winning leagues.\n\nCups to me represent bells, whistles and frills football. They are a bit flash. The league, the nitty-gritty of having to mentally dig deep, that is what determines a player’s character.\n\nAnd that is what wins you respect.\n\nWith Derry, around Dublin, what you get is a club that is admired.\n\nThey have won more FAI Cups than any other League of Ireland club since they came into the league 39 years ago.\n\nBut in terms of league titles, across the same time period, Shamrock Rovers and Dundalk have won eight each, Shels have won six, St Pat’s five, Bohs four and Cork three.\n\nThat’s a truer reflection of what they are - a honeymoon club.\n\nThey won the last League title under Felix Healy, 26 years ago.\n\nIt could be another 26 years until they win their next one.\n\nYou see the hardest thing to manage in Derry is not the board - because their chairman, Philip O’Doherty is one of the best around.\n\nTricky\n\nThe tricky bit is the crowd. Their city is a goldfish bowl.\n\nThey like to have locals in their team, which is understandable when you consider the city’s history, how it was under siege during The Troubles, and how it is geographically isolated.\n\nBut the reality is that provincial clubs need outside players in it.\n\nJust look at the populations of the country’s big urban areas.\n\nThere are 1.2m people living in Dublin – just 83,000 living in Derry.\n\nIn that context, it’s impossible for them to compete with Dublin clubs for a player base unless they go outside their city walls and bring in outsiders.\n\nI quickly realised that when I got up to Derry. I got rid of some local players and wasn’t popular for doing so.\n\nBut in my view, I was there to mould a championship-winning team, not to put together another side that could get a League Cup.\n\nWho cares about that trophy? No one, bar the sponsors, and Derry City fans.\n\nA fact of life is that supporters are erratic, no matter which club they follow.\n\nIt’s a side-effect of being so passionate.\n\nBut when you have such a passionate core of fans following you, so willing to express their opinion, as a manager you are going to come under pressure.\n\nAnd you have to be strong.\n\nYou have to pick a player based on his performance, not his address.\n\nIn this respect, Shamrock Rovers - who Derry plays tonight - have an in-built advantage over the Candystripes.\n\nThey have a much bigger player base at their disposal.\n\nThey don’t have the travel demands placed on clubs like Derry and Cork.\n\nFor Derry, every away game is a two-hour drive, minimum. For Rovers, only six of their 36 league games this season requires a journey of longer than an hour.\n\nTrust\n\nSo my sympathy is with Ruaidhri Higgins, the current Derry manager.\n\nHe has a hard job on his hands, and trust me, finishing second this year, so long as they end up closer to Rovers than they did last year, will be a decent season.\n\nFor the job he has is one of the toughest in Irish football."
