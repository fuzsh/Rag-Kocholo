I am 17 years old and currently play Defensive End for the Neenah Rockets. Along with football, I have been a part of the wrestling and track team throughout my High School career, competing at every chance possible. I am personally looking for a university that is going to provide me with the best education to give me the tools to have a successful career in the future. Along with a great education, comes my desire to want to compete at an elite level. During my Junior football season I have received VFA Honorable Mention All Conference in an elite High School conference in Wisconsin. Along with receiving All Conference Honors, I had finished the 2012 season with 46 tackles, 3 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 2 blocked passes, 1 fumble recovery and a blocked punt. During this summer, I am committed to attending the North Dakota State Football Camp in Fargo, N.D., Minnesota State and Wisconsin's Football Camp in Madison. I am looking to play either OLB, FB, or DE at the next level and would love to hear back from any college that would feel like I can contribute to their team, community, and university."
