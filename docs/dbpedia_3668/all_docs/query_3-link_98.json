        "text": "Yet another former Ohio State basketball player is getting involved with The Basketball Tournament, which is scheduled to take place in Nationwide Arena in Columbus from July 4 through July 14. Former Buckeye center Trevor Thompson is the latest familiar face to join, though he’s doing so not as a member of Ohio State’s alumni team, “Carmen’s Crew,” nor as a member of the Big Ten alumni team “Big X,” but as part of the “Red Scare,” a Dayton alumni team.\n\nThe 6-foot-11, 210-pound center is the lone Buckeye on the Dayton team, though he is joining Trey Landers, the brother of former Buckeye defensive tackle Robert Landers, and a former Dayton basketball player. During his two seasons in Columbus, Thompson started 48 games, averaging 8.5 points per game and 7.0 rebounds.\n\nHe’s far from the only Buckeye involved in the tournament, however. Big X features Andrew Dakich, CJ Jackson, Keyshawn Woods and Jae’Sean Tate, while Carmen’s Crew plays host to William Buford, Aaron Craft, Jon Diebler, Dallas Lauderdale, David Lighty, Lenzelle Smith Jr and Deshaun Thomas, along with coaching from Jared Sullinger and Evan Turner.\n\nSeveral things will have to happen for any of the three teams to meet up, though it seems likely that there will be a Buckeye battle in the top half of the bracket. Carmen’s Crew, the No. 1 seed, along with the No. 8 seeded Red Scare are both in for first round byes, while Big X, the No. 9 seed, has to knock off No. 24 Jackson TN Undersawgs to advance to a matchup with Red Scare. If Carmen’s Crew can win its first round game, it would face the winner of that Red Scare-Big X battle.\n\nCarmen’s Crew took on and beat both Big X and Red Scare in the 2019 tournament, 89-75 in round two against Big X, and 85-71 against Red Scare in the third round.\n\nPlay opens for the 2020 edition of TBT with the round of 24 on July 4."
