        "text": "Phil Coulter will launch a new foundation this month set up in memory of Derry City football captain Ryan McBride.\n\nThe Derry-born songwriter will headline a a star-studded dinner and concert at the Everglades Hotel on Saturday, May 27.\n\nThe event will officially launch the Ryan McBride foundation, which has been set up in memory of the 27-year-old footballer, who died suddenly in March.\n\nHis death came just 24 hours after he had led his club to victory in a match against Drogheda United.\n\nBorn and bred in the city, McBride had played for the club since 2011 despite opportunities to transfer to professional football in England.\n\nThe foundation aims to support and inspire young players to achieve what Ryan had accomplished and assist groups that the young sportsman supported during his life.\n\nRyan's sister, Caitlin McBride said the foundation was \"thrilled\" that Phil Coulter had pledged his support to the launch event.\n\n\"We are overwhelmed by the support we have received and are honoured to launch the Ryan McBride foundation to help keep Ryan's memory alive and to help support local up-and-coming footballers in realising their potential,\" she said.\n\nPhil Coulter said he was \"honoured\" to headline the event.\n\n\"Ryan was an excellent role model for the youth of today and through the foundation his memory will live on and he will continue to inspire local footballers,\" he said.\n\n\"I am delighted that Derry actor and singer Damian McGinty, who starred in Glee, is flying home from LA to perform at the event. The weekend of Ryan's death, Damian and I performed The Town I Loved So Well as a tribute to him and Martin McGuinness and the video of the duet has been viewed almost 100,000 times online.\""
