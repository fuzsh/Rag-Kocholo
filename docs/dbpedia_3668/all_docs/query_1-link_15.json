        "text": "Management:\n\nManager: Gerald Boyle\n\nCoach: Shaun Holmes\n\nGoalkeeping Coach: Eugene Ferry\n\nPerformance Summary:\n\nGroup B: 6th-place finish\n\nTier 2 (North): 4th-place finish\n\nShield Competition: Eliminated in the Quarter-Finals against Cork City\n\nEnda McGuill Cup: Eliminated in the second round against Dundalk\n\nTop Scorer: Sean Patton (14 goals)\n\nThe 2023 season was to be a challenging and frustrating one for all involved with the U19 squad. Under the guidance of manager Gerald Boyle – who returned to lead the team after his 2022 stint with the U17s – and coach Shaun Holmes, the season’s main objective was to find a perfect balance between winning matches and the core focus on individual player development.\n\nWhilst working hard to achieve individual player growth, there were plenty of standout moments throughout the year. Academy talents Tiernan McGinty, Sean Patton, and Callum McCay made competitive first-team debuts, highlighting the academy’s commitment to player progression. However, it’s worth noting that these academy players collectively received only 47 minutes of playing time with the senior team during the 2023 season.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Tiernan McGinty, a Falcarragh native, made an immediate impact with a goal during his debut in a 2-0 victory against Cork City in June. A month earlier, 16-year-old Sean Patton from Drumkeen played the final 17 minutes in Derry’s 4-1 triumph over UCD. Callum McCay, on the other hand, achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first player from the club’s U13 squad to rise through the academy ranks and represent the senior team. His debut took place during an emphatic 5-0 victory against UCD.\n\nInternational Representation:\n\nMeanwhile, on the international stage, Dara McAuley (Goalkeeper), Ádhamh Patton (Defender), and Callum McCay (Midfielder) represented Northern Ireland U17s at the European Championship Qualifiers in Noordwijk, Netherlands. Additionally, Tiernan McGinty and Sean Patton underwent assessments with Ireland U19s, managed by former City favourite Tom Mohan.\n\nTransfer:\n\nIn June, one of the academy’s brightest talents, 16-year-old midfielder Jack Doherty, signed a contract with EFL League One side Fleetwood Town. Doherty spent his formative years with Tristar FC, then moved on to spend one season with Oxford United before eventually joining Derry City. Jack, who previously captained Northern Ireland at the Victory Shield tournament and represented Northern Ireland U17s in the Elite Stage of the Euro Qualifiers in 2022 at just 15 years old, penned a two-year scholarship with the Lancashire club.\n\nPhase One:\n\nThe season began with a narrow defeat at home to UCD, followed by a first win seven days later. Tiernan McKinney’s hat-trick helped City to a thrilling 5-4 win over Longford Town. The U19s finished sixth in Group B, recording four wins, two losses, and four draws out of ten matches. Highlight moments included Sean Patton’s four-goal performance against Klub Kildare, Tiarnan McKinney’s impressive six goals in eight games, and a resilient 3-3 draw away to Bohemians.\n\nPlayer departures:\n\nPlayer departures during the season, coupled with injuries, affected preparations for the campaign’s second phase. With the first-team squad’s increasing strength, along with the club vying for honours, academy players are faced with increased challenges in making the breakthrough. Derry City legend Liam Coyle has also voiced concerns about the demanding environment for young players under manager Ruaidhri Higgins, considering the club’s resources.\n\nWith the lack of a U21 or reserve team at the club, several players moved on in search of first-team football. Notable transfers included attacking midfielders Tiarnan McKinney and Mark Mbuli, who moved to NIFL Premiership’s Institute FC in June. Additionally, Liam Mullan joined ‘Stute on loan in July, while centre-back Darragh McCloskey secured a deal with Dergview FC in August. Kyle McCloskey went on to join Coleraine FC.\n\nHowever, these departures created opportunities for members of the U17 panel, with Caoimhan McDermott, Callum Doherty, Brendan Roe, and Kevin Muldoon, among others, impressing when called upon.\n\nInjuries:\n\nInjuries further compounded the squad’s challenges. Conor Barr was due to attend Ireland U19 training but sustained a severe injury just days before the camp, sidelining the talented full-back for two months. Additionally, Aaron Heaney sustained an ankle injury, while Conall McGarrigle suffered a broken arm.\n\nSean Patton was the LOI Academy’s U19 leading scorer when he sustained a medial ligament injury in August, ending his season prematurely. Remarkably, between August 2022 and August 2023, Patton scored an impressive 26 goals in 27 appearances for the U17s/U19s.\n\nPhase Two:\n\nIn Phase Two, the U19s played 12 competitive games, winning six, drawing two, and losing four. Tiernan McGinty displayed clinical finishing in front of goal from a progressive midfield position, bagging seven goals in ten games. One of the more impressive performances included an 8-1 victory over Bray Wanderers at Brandywell.\n\nThe Candy Stripes finished Phase Two in fourth place, which earned them a spot in the Shield quarter-finals. However, Cork City proved too strong an opposition, with the Leesiders running out 4-2 victors. Conor Barr and Callum McCay found the back of the net for Derry.\n\nEnda McGuill Cup:\n\nIn the Enda McGuill Cup, City exited the competition at the second-round stage, losing 3-1 to Dundalk at Oriel Park. After receiving a bye in the first round, Derry headed into the game against the Lilywhites with a threadbare squad. Manager Gerald Boyle promoted four players from the U17s. Sean Patton was on the scoresheet for the Candy Stripes, converting a penalty, but a brace from Callum Bonner and a strike by Anthony Mayo proved decisive and sent the Lilywhites through to the quarter-finals.\n\nThroughout the season, the U19s fielded 37 players across 24 games; 15 contributed to the team’s 55 goals.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn summary, the 2023 season produced many challenges but offered plenty of positive learning experiences for coaches and players. It featured tangible steps forward with individual achievements, international exposure and opportunities for some promising young players to feature in the first team.\n\n2023 All Comps Record: P24; W10; D6; L8; F55; A52; GD+3\n\nGoal Scorers: (14) Sean Patton; (9) Tiernan McGinty; (6) Tiarnan McKinney; (4) Oisin Duffy; (3) Cian Kavanagh; (2) Liam Mullan, Caoimhan McDermott, Rory O’Donnell, Kevin Muldoon, Callum McCay; (1) Mark Mbuli, Conall McGarrigle, Darragh McCloskey, Jordan McEneff, Conor Barr, Own Goal.\n\nDerry City U19 Squad 2023: Fintan Doherty, Darragh McAuley, Oran White, Conor Barr, Rory O’Donnell, Ben McGonigle, Kyle McCloskey, Ádhamh Patton, Darragh McCloskey, Tiernan McGinty, Jack Doherty, Callum McCay, Conall McGarrigle, Jack McGlynn, Tiarnan McKinney, Oisin Duffy, Mark Mbuli, Liam Mullan, Aaron Heaney, Sean Patton.\n\nPromoted from the U17s: Caoimhan McDermott, Jack McLaughlin, Callum Doherty, Kevin Muldoon, Reece Monaghan, Brendan Roe, Liam Carlin, Adam Bonner, Euan Quigley, Michael Rafferty, Luke O’Donnell, Connor McDaid."
