        "text": "TALENTED Derry City captain Ryan McBride was an “inspirational leader in the dressing room and on the field of play,” mourners were told.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who died suddenly on Sunday, was a “powerful example” for people of all ages.\n\nHundreds attended the moving service for the local man at St Columba’s Church in the Northern Irish city.\n\nAfter team-mates formed a guard of honour for the young star, mourners heard how Ryan, who scored around 100 goals for the club since joining in 2011, was a “great role model”.\n\nFather Aidan Mullan told his friends, fans and family the defender was “a versatile and accomplished footballer.”\n\nFather Mullan said he had brought “thrilling moments to so many supporters of Derry City, and across Ireland, over the past seven years\".\n\nThe priest added: “The club management, the team, the supporters, all have been caught up in his natural footballing ability; in his courageous play.\n\n\"As has been said many times: Ryan would put his head where other players would not put their boot. \"He was brave and knew no fear.”\n\nAt the service President Michael D Higgins met with Ryan’s heartbroken father Lexie, who had found his son dead in bed at the weekend.\n\nHe also passed on his condolences to his sisters Colleen, Siuínín and Caitlain and partner Mairead.\n\nRyan, captain of his team for two years, died suddenly at his home in Derry, Northern Ireland, on Sunday.\n\nHis remains were taken through local streets as he was brought to the church.\n\nHe was later to be buried alongside his mum Noreen at Derry City Cemetery.\n\nHis pal and Ireland international James McClean is set to wear the number five shirt in Ryan’s memory in the Republic’s World Cup qualifier this week against Wales.\n\nHe made more than 170 appearances for his club and became captain two years ago.\n\nFather Mullan said: “As captain he was an inspirational leader in the dressing room and on the field of play.\n\n“In the last several weeks Ryan was pivotal in great performances and contributed greatly to Derry's perfect start to the season; quick reflexes, heady play and competitive spirit, made him a great role model for many young boys and girls as well as City supporters and fans throughout the area.”\n\nHe added: “And of Ryan's loving family - his unexpected death has impacted on his nearest, and on all of us, as an appalling shock.\n\n“We cannot fully take in the reality even as we carry out our funeral rites for our beloved Ryan.”\n\nNorthern Ireland gaffer Michael O’Neill welcomed a decision by the IFA to hold a minute's applause for McBride ahead of the World Cup qualifier with Norway.\n\nHe said: \"It was shocking when I heard the news on Sunday.\n\n\"It will be nice to remember Ryan with the gesture of a minute's applause before Sunday's game.\"\n\nO'Neill has vivid memories of McBride during his time coaching in the southern league.\n\nHe said: \"I was still managing in the League of Ireland when Ryan made his debut and you could see straight away he was a hometown boy playing for his hometown club.\n\n\"Derry have had a lot to deal with in the last few years and this is another big blow to the club.\n\n\"We all felt it here, particularly the likes of Daniel Lafferty who played with Ryan at Derry.\""
