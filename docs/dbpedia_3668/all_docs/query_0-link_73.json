        "text": "Article from Hoops Scene (July 5) Shamrock Rovers against Saint Patrick’s Athletic:\n\nHoops Scene contributor, Macdara Ferris, spent the recent break taking in the greatest show on earth…\n\n“Tonight it is back to a home Airtricity League game for me after I spent the mid-season World Cup break at the World Cup in South Africa. I had actually booked and paid for World Cup tickets for Ireland matches nearly 18 months ago. The disappointment of Ireland’s play off defeat was tempered somewhat by the refund of the cost of the tickets from FIFA a few days after the away game in Paris. So despite Thierry Henry’s hand ball antics a group of eight of us travelled out to the FIFA World Cup in South Africa anyway including some Shamrock Rovers fans (myself, Kevin Daly and Paddy O’Connor). A flag was made up in honour of Sepp Blatter with “Team 33 on Tour” which got much comment wherever we went including getting a mention in the New York Times no less!\n\nHaving attended one game at the France 98 World Cup, travelled out to Japan/Korea in 2002 and spending a few days in Germany in 2006, I was luckily enough to be making it a four in a row at the World Cup. It was my first chance to visit South Africa and with match tickets for games in Johannesburg and Pretoria we were trying to ignore all the horror safety stories. In fact, we couldn’t have been better looked after with all the local South Africans immersing themselves in the World Cup. This started right from the flight out with South African Airlines where all their staff were in World Cup mode wearing the South African team kit at check in. They even handed out ear plugs for the flight and the vuvuzelas. I’m a proud owner of an official World Cup 2010 vuvuzela now, green in colour of course, but I think I would be lynched if I brought it to Tallaght!\n\nThe first game we attended was the host nation’s defeat to Uruguay. It was an amazing atmosphere at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria. Listening to the South Africans sing their anthem was hairs up on the back of the neck stuff. Sadly they couldn’t replicate the form of their opening game. For Uruguay, Diego Forlan scored a cracker and then he silenced the vuvuzelas when he scored from the penalty spot before Uruguay grabbed a third.\n\nThe next day we went to the amazing Soccer City stadium to watch Argentina play the Korea Republic. An incredible stadium with a capacity of 95,000. Sadly like all the games we attended there were several thousand empty seats with most blaming FIFA and sponsors for not selling the tickets appropriately. There was several thousand South Korean fans at the game but a multiple of that from Argentina. Flags hung off every available space in the five tier stadium, one of the very best I have been to. It was a great game with Leonil Messi running the show, Higuen slotting away a hat trick and the living legend that is Maradona prowling the sidelines. We had the whole carriage on the train back into Jo’burg singing “We all dream of a team of Leonil Messis”!\n\nEverybody staying in our hotel was out for World Cup. Australian fans (who brought 15,000 fans to South Africa), Americans, English, German and Brazilian. The Americans we met had traveled out in huge numbers to support their national team but didn’t seem to show any interest in their own domestic football league which reminded me of somewhere close to home. Out next game saw their USA team come back from two goals down to level with Slovenia before a very poor refereeing decision robbed them of a famous 3-2 win. We had the Shamrock Rovers and Team 33 on Tour flags hanging at all the games and I’m told Gabriel Egan gave the Shamrock Rovers flag a mention at that game in Ellis Park. The following night we traveled back up to Pretoria to watch Cameroon be eliminated by Denmark 2-1.\n\nThe next day we took the opportunity of taking in a tour of Soweto (which is adjacent to Soccer City) which was a real eye opener. Everybody was very friendly (many wishing us happy Father’s Day for the day that was in it) and we saw how so many South Africans live with our guide showing us her “house” which shares one communal toilet and tap with 39 people living in the area. However, there is still a mix of incomes in Orlando West where we went to as on the same street the owner was out washing his fairly new BMW car. We traveled by local bus to Soccer City that evening for the game between Brazil against Cote D`Ivore. The setting of Soccer City with the sun setting behind the orange coloured stadium facade was incredible. As we were getting some photos of the stadium, the RTE team of George Hamilton and Trevor Steven dropped across to say hello. Watching some of the games on South African TV, we have been listening to our own Eoin Hand give his expert analysis sitting alongside George Weah, Paul Ince and John Barnes.\n\nWith all the inverted Irish tricolours for Ivory Coast on display outside and inside the ground it was almost like Ireland had made the World Cup. I am sure that Trapattoni wouldn’t have let Ireland make an embarrassment of ourselves like the French did. Whenever people saw the Irish colours during the tournament they always gave us a huge amount of sympathy for how Ireland were eliminated from the tournament. Indeed when we met World Cup winner Frenchman Christian Karembeu after a game, he apologised for the hand ball incident and told us the Irish should have been in the tournament. As it turned out the Brazil game was probably one of the less interesting games we were at with Brazil coasting through the game with a helping “hand” from Fabiano. Only a late Drogba goal raised the energy but Brazil won 3-1.\n\nI managed to pick up a category 4 locally priced ticket for the Italy v Slovakia game which was the final one I attended. 140 Rand or about 15euro gets you a seat in the second highest row in the stadium. The Italian team never really got going until they were too far behind a Slovakian team who punished the Italian mistakes going 2-0 up. The Italians came back into it with Pirlo off the bench trying his best . They got a stunning goal to make it 3-2 and pushed for the equaliser which would have put them through but it never came. The World Champions were out and it made it 24 goals from the six games I attended.\n\nI did manage to escape the world cup (somewhat) during the visit to South Africa. Despite the vuvuzelas and the friendly South African stewards, the World Cup is it’s own self contained kind of city which can be transported to any Coca Cola drinking, McDonalds eating or Hyundai driving location. Having said that the Mexican wave seems to be going the opposite way – something to do with being in the southern hemisphere maybe! I spent a couple of days on safari and the last few days in Cape Town amongst other things I watched games in local bars or in the FIFA Fan Fest in Grand Parade square (where Nelson Mandela gave his speech on the day he was released from prison in 1990 – I also took some time to visit Robben Island where he spent 18 years). Watching England being destroyed by Germany was very entertaining as was viewing Argentina, Holland and Brazil who all look worthy winners. Next Sunday will see the World Cup Final and will determine who will be bringing the trophy as holders to the next World Cup. I’m looking forward to Brazil 2014 already!”\n\nThe match going experience is very important here at Shamrock Rovers. Rovers have probably the best stadium facilities in the Airtricity League with nearly 6,000 covered seats with clear unobstructed views from each seat. The sense of occasion on match day is heightened further with displays by the SRFC Ultras, events in the Glenmalure Suite such as May’s Evening with Johnny Giles or this season’s addition of Hooperman who entertains both young and young at heart on match day. The match programme is also an essential part of the match going experience.\n\nThe Shamrock Rovers programme has the typical things you will expect to see in a match programme if you are familiar with football in Ireland and Britain. It will have the mix of manager’s notes, players interviews and profiles, something for the kids and a look back at previous encounters with the day’s opposition. At Rovers the manager’s programme notes have at times ranged from the sublime and ridiculous (Damien Richardson) to the nonexistent (Pat Scully) so Michael O’Neill’s notes strike a happy medium.\n\nThe programme at Rovers is not just used to extract another four euro from punters coming in the turnstile but the club does welcome this extra revenue. The club invests a significant amount of money and time in the match programme. With the move to Tallaght and the large attendances, it means that the match programme can return a nice profit to the club which last year was a tidy five figure sum. The club is committed to producing a high quality full colour programme and the quality was recognised at last week’s Irish Programme Fair with Rovers picking up another Premier Division Programme of the Year Award.\n\nFans have different relationships with the programme. Some will grab a read before kick off, maybe at half time or save it for the LUAS trip home. They may note carefully down the numbers of the players being read over the stadium public address. Others will carefully pack the programme away to ensure it is in pristine condition. If you go into the attic today of many Rovers fans, you wouldn’t be in for a big surprise to see several boxes containing old match programmes. With the club shop now selling programme holders others will have them proudly on display on their bookshelves at home.\n\nThe importance of the match programme may have reduced somewhat over the years with the emergence of new technologies providing a range of services to get up to date news on happenings at the football club. Rovers have an excellent website which is updated on a daily basis. You can follow Rovers on Facebook to get the very latest news or you can get it texted to you on your mobile phone. The unofficial SRFC Ultras Forum is where you can pick up the very latest gossip or Shamrock Rumours! Back in Milltown, the programme was published, not by the club, but by the supporters club. These days it is an official club production but shouldn’t be viewed as a Rovers Pravda publication. The programme won’t be short of an opinion or two as it attempts to stimulate a debate over that half time slice of pizza or cup of coffee (all within the constraints of libel laws and the FAI’s participation agreement of course!).\n\nMatch programmes are a serious business especially judging by the price of some programmes on sale over eBay or at last week’s Irish Programme Fair with sales of some programmes in excess of 100 euro each for some historic games. The Shamrock Rovers Heritage Trust had a stall at the event selling programmes from home games in Milltown, RDS and other Dublin venues in addition to the Tallaght based programmes. The Trust also has an extensive collection of old Shamrock Rovers programmes some of which are also available to view online (http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/about/heritage/programme-archive). This includes the programme from the European Cup match between Rovers and the famous Busby Babe Manchester United side in 1957. This programme was part of the display on view during the evening with Johnny Giles.\n\nMaybe your four euro investment this evening could be worth a multiple of that in years to come. So don’t roll up the programme on your way out of the game tonight and shove it into your back pocket, take care of it as it isn’t just a good read but could also be a good investment. Enjoy the game and tonight’s match programme!\n\nIt was a Rovers wedding that caused me to miss a few games in August. I know what you are thinking, what kind of Rovers fan organises their wedding during the season? But congratulations to Rowan and Carly all the same! Even though the wedding necessitated a trip across the Atlantic, the Ultras Forum and SRFC TV/Radio kept me up to date during the Drogheda and Cork games. As always on holidays, I checked out the football schedule to see what games were on. Real Madrid were concluding their pre-season with a trip to America but having already seen them in the confines of Tallaght I didn’t bother. Both the New York Red Bulls (sister club no doubt to some Rovers’ fans favourite Austrian club!) and the New England Revolution were both on long road trips so there was no live ‘soccer’ on view but it gave me a chance to catch a couple of games of America’s national sport, Baseball.\n\nIt was an opportunity to check out the new home of the New York Yankees and to go and see what the biggest rivalry in baseball was all about with the Boston Red Sox in town to play the Yankees. The Yankees are the Shamrock Rovers of baseball, being the most successful club in the county. Also like Rovers, the New York Yankees are playing their first season in a new stadium on land given to them by their local authority. The stadium was years in planning and was not without controversy but they did not have to ground share with the New York Mets or have to play a home game in Baltimore. They simply built a new pall park in the Bronx across the road from their old ground.\n\nThe old stadium is still there across the road and the plan is for it to be knocked down and turned into a park for the community. The new stadium has actually 5,000 less seats than the old one but its 52,000 seats spread over five tiers is very impressive. It has all the requirements of a modern stadium with corporate areas, food and drink concessions, club museum, large media section and huge score board. The Yankee fans have plenty of opportunities to visit the ground with the players playing even more games than Gary Twigg in a season with approximately 80 home games during the regular season. There were plenty of Red Sox away fans dotted around the stadium on the night and they weren’t afraid to cheer on their team even sitting amongst the faithful Yankee fans. It was almost a football style atmosphere with plenty of cheering, clapping and singing. The most risqué song was probably the home fans chanting “Boston sucks” repeatedly so I’d only imagine what they would think of a Rovers v Bohs game. A number of fans were ejected from the stadium for some heated discussions with rival fans but the copious amounts of beer drunk during the game probably didn’t help the situation.\n\nAnd what of the game? Well I won’t bore you with the ins and outs, strikes and balls but it was a very memorable game for one reason alone…the length. Americans like a victory and don’t like draws so after the end of the regulation nine innings they go into extra innings if there is no winner. Now this is fairly normal. What was not normal was the clock ticking past midnight by the 12th inning and there was still no score. We had a fourteenth inning stretch and still they played on. It was the bottom of the 15th with two out when Yankee star third base man Alex Rodriguez hit a home run to win the game. This sparked massive celebrations for the home fans that had remained till 00:45 to see a winner nearly six hours after the first pitch. With Old Blue Eyes belting out “New York, New York” over the PA and fireworks in the night sky, the capacity crowd drifted happily out of the stadium. Thankfully the subway runs later than the LUAS so we were all able to get home.\n\nI took in another baseball game when I visited the oldest Major League Baseball ground when in Boston. It was the Red Sox again this time taking on the Detroit Tigers. Fenway Park is very old school and couldn’t be much more different than the new Yankee Stadium. However, what it lacks in modernity it makes up for in character. Its current capacity is 37,000 but in 1919 Eamon de Valera held a rally in front of 40,000 people in Fenway in his efforts to garner support for an Irish Republic. The stadium has a massive lower tier around two thirds of the ground with a relatively small top tier. From home plate the bleacher seats are on the right outfield and on the left the “monsta” as the locals call it or the 11m high green monster wall at left field. It was the 624th consecutive sell out for the Red Sox on the night (that’s every game since May 2003) and the first couple of innings were missed while queuing up outside to pick up some return tickets. The touts or scalpers were offering seats in the bleachers for $50 but with some patience seats behind home plate at the back of the first tier were bought for the same price to see a home win by eight runs to two.\n\nBaseball has great traditions and even here in Ireland we would be aware of some of the big name players and the love Americans have for the game. Films like The Natural, Major League, Field of Dreams, Eight Men out and Bull Durham provide a far better feel for the game and entertainment than the football films we’ve been subjected to over the years (“When Saturday comes” anyone?). In American sports we would also be aware of evil club owners selling their home grounds against the will of the fans and moving the club to another location, that would never happen in Ireland! A night out at the baseball is a great night out for everyone especially families. The sound of the organ playing “Take me out to the ball game” and the peanuts and cracker jack being sold throughout the venue may be viewed as clichéd but that is what the night out a game is like. Looking at the commercial set up you can see comparisons with Rovers but on a much larger scale. For instance like the free scarves that Rovers handed out to fans at our game in Tolka Park last season, one of the games I went to was on a ‘T-Shirt Tuesday’. So the first 10,000 fans in the gate that evening got a free T-Shirt outlining how you know you’re a fan of that team and I’ve reworked it below with a Rovers theme. Now let’s play ball!\n\nYou know you’re a Rovers fan if…\n\nYou’re friends with Padraig on Facebook\n\nYou know how to pronounce Sives\n\n‘Hoops Scene’ is your favourite reading material\n\nYou’ve officially changed your address to Glenmalure Park\n\nYou wonder why people get off the Red LUAS line before Tallaght\n\nYou doodle SRFC during meetings or class\n\nYou know Rovers fans by their internet, not real, names\n\nFrom Hoops Scene September 19 2009 (Shamrock Rovers v Bray Wandereres)\n\nHoops Scene winner of Programme of the Year for 2009\n\nArticle in Hoops Scene (Issue 3 Rovers v Dundalk/Shelbourne March 2010)\n\nWhen Shamrock Rovers finally got to play their first game in Tallaght just over a year ago, following a double decade long odyssey, there was rejoicing from Hoops fans, residents of Tallaght and the footballing community in general. It was a great positive news story, an example of how sport can be an uplifting part of people’s lives and their community. South Dublin County Council (SDCC) stepping in to finish the stadium to its “original” plans, and going all the way to the High Court to do so, meant so much to those who have an interest in football and to Rovers fans in particular. 2009 turned out to be an incredible season with some amazing games in Tallaght and Rovers challenging for the title. Really the only thing missing was a league or cup trophy to parade around the stadium at the end of the season. So what have some people got to complain about? It seemed the only thing that vexed many, myself included, was the colour and arrangement of the seats in the stadium.\n\nWhen the builders returned to the stadium in May 2008 under the management of the local authority, the stadium became a site of pilgrimage for Rovers fans. Photo updates were posted on the official website and internet forums on a weekly, if not daily, basis. The talk was of when would the infamous roof arrive? Under previous club regimes, the builders were always a matter of “three to four weeks” away from returning to restart construction and the roof was always days away from being delivered from Continental Europe. Now with South Dublin County Council as client on the stadium, the roof arrived in August 2009. The roof looked just as depicted in the architectural sketches many fans saw for the first time at the Sidewalk Cafe in August 2000 at one of the information evenings for the stadium. The roof has a striking form with curved roof cladding spanning between tapered precast concrete roof beams giving an unobstructed view of the playing surface that fans couldn’t wait to see football be played on.\n\nThe next question everybody was asking was what colour would the seats be? The original sketches of the stadium showed the stand with green seats. Maybe it would be a green and white arrangement. During construction the odd sample seat of a variety of colours, including red, went in and then came out. However nobody really believed there would be red seats in the stadium. As autumn came the seats began to be fixed in greater numbers and everybody was in for a surprise. Greens seats…check. White seats…check. Yellow seats…can we check this? Red seats…ah now come on! The central section of the stand has an arrangement with strips of green seats mixed with sections of white. But the ends of the stands have “random” section of yellow, green, white and red seats. People were trying to read patterns in the seats. Would it be SRFC on the seats or maybe SDCC as municipal owners of the stadium? The next question asked was did these colours represent some colour arrangement in the flag of Tallaght or maybe South Dublin County Council? Confusion (and antipathy in some quarters) seemed to reign.\n\nWhen asked, the County Architect pointed out correctly that the stadium was now a municipal facility, not a stadium owned by Shamrock Rovers. So this seemed to be a reason not to have a seating arrangement of green and white. It was almost a signal to the people of South Dublin that this was their stadium and, while Shamrock Rovers were a very welcome anchor tenant, it was a stadium not just for one community organisation. Most Rovers fans could understand this viewpoint even if deep down they wanted a green or a white seat to sit in. They probably would have accepted this position quite willingly if it wasn’t for the bizarre arrangement that was unfolding before their eyes like a game of Lego or Tetris unfolding in the real world.\n\nThe Council went on to explain that the reasoning for the arrangement is that it is common in European stadia to have “an assortment of colours across the stand. This reduces the appearance of emptiness on television for events with a small attendance. It also adds visual liveliness when the stadium is not in use.” Having the mixture of seats is indeed a practice seen in a number of stadia around the globe but the arrangement in Tallaght was not the “visual liveliness” most were looking for or had seen elsewhere.\n\nThere are a number of stadia this author has been to that have used the effect of varying the seating colours from the usual single or two tone pattern with excellent results. In Ireland, the magnificent redeveloped Thomond Park stadium, winner of the People’s Choice in last year’s Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland Awards, adopts a mixture of seating. With predominantly red seats, there is a sprinkling of yellow and black seats. With Lansdowne Road stadium in redevelopment, the FAI moved two international fixtures to the Thomond Park stadium in 2009 including a disappointing small crowd watching Ireland beat the 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa 1-0. The 11,300 crowd in the stadium, which has a capacity of 25,600, certainly did seem larger on the night.\n\nIreland played in another stadium with a lively seating arrangement but the game is remembered for the penalty shoot out that saw Ireland eliminated from the 2002 World Cup by Spain. That game was played in Suwon stadium in South Korea. With the full house in the stadium that night most of those watching on the TV would have missed the mix of seating across the full range of the rainbow spectrum.\n\nAnother stadium which hosted games in a major football championship is the Estadio Jose Alvarde in Lisbon which is home to another team wearing a familiar home strip of green and white hoops, Sporting Lisbon. Redeveloped for EURO 2004 the stadium has a capacity of 50,000. Amusingly while the Lidl shop in Tallaght is across the road from our stadium, in Lisbon it is actually underneath the stands with part of the stadium home to the Lidl supermarket. It certainly gives a different meaning to the club shop! The night this author was at a game last December, we had a couple of guesses as to what the attendance was in the stadium but all were overestimates when we learned that just under 25,000 fans had watched Sporting lose 1-0 to União Leira.\n\nWith the World Cup in South Africa a mere 82 days away, it is worth highlighting the magnificent Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban that will host games such as Portugal v Brazil and one of the semi-finals. With its architectural design taking inspiration from the South African flag, its seating arrangement appears to give the stadium a full appearance even if none of the 70,000 seats are filled.\n\nBack in Tallaght some fans still annoyed with the seating insist on sitting on a green or white seat, whilst others only sit on a red or yellow one so that those seats cannot be seen by the TV cameras! The ultimate plan for the stadium in Tallaght is for it to be completed with two additional stands facing each other behind each goal. Securing funding for completing the stadium is a much higher priority that debating the arrangement of the seating. Whatever your views on the seating, what we all can agree on is that the most visual lively arrangement is to have a full Tallaght stadium with fans decked out in green and white alongside a colourful SRFC Ultras display inspiring Shamrock Rovers to victory.\n\nFrom Hoops Scene Issue 3 (Shamrock Rovers v Dundalk – 21 March 2010)\n\nPat Sullivan is hoping to make his league debut for this season in today’s game having sat out the first two league games through suspensions carried over from last season. Since making his debut in the League of Ireland in 2002, Sullivan has lined out for a number of clubs including UCD, Drogheda United, Longford Town and Cork City. During that time he has also lined out in a number of different positions on the pitch including right back, centre half and in midfield. Hoops Scene caught up with the player during the week and asked him where he thought his best position was?\n\n“Right back. I came to Rovers as a right back. I did play some games in right midfield for a few teams. At UCD they were struggling for a few players at the time and I got moved to right back. We were doing well, I stayed there and right back turned into my position. If needs be I may play at right midfield or at centre half but I don’t see myself playing there.”\n\nPat Sullivan was a Shamrock Rovers schoolboy player but it was at UCD he began his league career and so it was a missed opportunity for Rovers who hadn’t the underage set up that the club now has. “I played for Rovers under 15, 16, 17 and 18. At that time the club was not in a decent state. We had a very good team when I was under 17 and under 18 but none of the players were kept on or progressed to any sort of the level. There was no effort. There were a lot of players then that the club missed out on as there was no structure to the club then”.\n\nFor Sullivan it is clear how important it is that the correct structures are put in place to develop young players, not only on the pitch, but off it too. This is something Shamrock Rovers are working hard on now and have an impressive set up at underage level with great interest now that the club is finally based in Tallaght. He was able to attend UCD on a sports scholarship and study Sports Management whilst playing League of Ireland football. He recognises the importance that each club should put on developing their own players. “For the size of league and country that we are it’s massively important. You are never going to keep clubs going by just taking players off other teams. Look at UCD, they are the model for it, they churn players out by the year, every team has a number of UCD players. It is something our league can work on and improve. It’s not great that players leave the country at 15 or 16 and many players come back home and don’t play again. When I was younger I never had the chance to go on trials. When I went to UCD, I wanted to study along with football. If we had stricter rules, you should get your education first”.\n\nSullivan is continuing his development by studying Business Studies as well as playing with Rovers. This is made possible with the structures at Shamrock Rovers that see the squad train in the evening allowing players to study or work during the day. “I came up from Cork in September and it didn’t really give me a lot time to get a job. So I’m doing this course as I didn’t really want to let the year go to waste”. This arrangement at Rovers is different to other clubs with many still pushing the boundaries of full time football in a league that has seen three top clubs go into Examinership in the last four years.\n\nSullivan enjoyed the status of playing as a full time footballer when he moved to Cork City in 2008. “It was great when it lasts and you’re not going to say no to the money but teams find it very hard to sustain. I’m surprised that Bohemians are keeping it going. We are effectively full time but are training in the evening time which is probably the only difference between ourselves and Bohs”. That training regime sees the squad train in the early evening three times a week as Sullivan outlined, “we start the week with training on a Monday, then again Tuesday with a break on Wednesday. We then train Thursday and play Friday evening. We are in on Saturday for a run or a swim so it is a busy enough time”.\n\nSullivan’s chance to come back to Rovers last season came about due to the financial fiasco that unfolded at Cork City. While he enjoyed his football in Cork, it all got too much when wages went unpaid and cheques began to bounce. Thankfully he was able to leave and join Rovers mid-way through last season. “I was more than happy to sever ties. The club were a disgrace. I was lucky to get out”.\n\nOnce he made the move he didn’t look back, enjoyed getting on with playing football and the manner that Rovers play the game. “I started playing straight away and then we were winning which is a good settler. You’ve got to defend when you have to defend but when you get the ball in the other half of the pitch, we try to get it down, you’ve got wingers for a reason and you’ve strikers for a reason. You get your strikers in the box and you’re wingers on the wing. The majority of us like to play, that’s how I like to play. I like to defend with the best of them with tackles and headers but I love going forward as a full back and Michael O’Neill gives us licence to do that. I’m more than happy to play in that type of system”.\n\nThe style of play and the size of the pitch in Tallaght fits nicely with this philosophy. “Yeah, it’s massive. Space wise when you’re on top of the game, it is great to have that size of pitch as you can really stretch teams. It’s the way we like to play as we do have wingers and we can get it wide. It’s the way I like the game to be played and it’s the most enjoyable way of playing on the pitch”.\n\nArticle from Shamrock Rovers match day programme against Drogheda and Cork (October 2009)\n\nIn the space of four days Shamrock Rovers have a double header of games playing first against Drogheda United and then against Cork City. During the past four years, all three clubs have entered Examinership with the High Court deciding should the clubs go out of business or continue as a going concern. All the clubs had run up significant debt and sought High Court protection from their creditors who were owed sizeable amounts of money including the Revenue Commissioners who were owed a combined total in excess of 1.5 million euro. Hughes Blake was the accounting firm appointed as Examiners for all the clubs.\n\nExaminership allows court protection from creditors for typically 100 days. With High Court approval a large proportion of that debt is written off and a plan put in place to pay creditors and for the future financial viability of the club. As we have seen in the last month, companies may not get approval to even get an examiner appointed (e.g. Liam Carroll’s Zoe Development companies) and even if they do, they don’t always survive going into Examinership (e.g. O’Brien’s Irish Sandwich Bars). If an agreement can’t be made with creditors, then the company goes into liquidation with any assets sold off with preferential creditors like the Revenue Commissioners and employees getting paid first.\n\nShamrock Rovers were the first club to go through the process back in 2005. With Rovers this season riding high at the top of the table, playing in front of full houses in Tallaght, the club is almost unrecognisable from that which went into Examinership and shows how far the club has come in such a short amount of time.\n\nUnder the previous club owners, Rovers’ debts had spiralled out of control with debts of around 2.5 million euro to a long list of creditors including players, the Department of Justice, the Gardaí and various companies who were owed money for services including portable toilets, first aid at matches, bus hire companies and training facility providers. A laundrette won a case in court over money they were owed for washing the famous green and white hooped kit. The largest debt was to Revenue at over half a million euro and this figure increased during the Examinership period when the club’s books were reviewed in detail.\n\nRovers were fortunate at this time that there was already a support structure in place, through the 400 Club, who were able to fund and run the club during Examinership while the Examiner went about trying to get a new owner and agreeing payment to the creditors. Seven potential investors came forward to discuss taking over the club. It was a different economic era in Ireland at the time and it seemed most were eyeing up the potential development opportunities with the Tallaght site. However, these investors, when looking in greater detail, saw that they were not likely to make any profit on the site which now had a lapsed planning permission. So it was the 400 club who were the last man standing and took control of the club post Examinership. It was a club with a much different playing squad as all the players in the squad were made free agents with notable players like Pat McCourt (now at Celtic) leaving for Derry and Dave Mooney (now at Norwich) joining Reading. The wage bill was reduced by 1/3 down to 10 grand a week.\n\nThe creditor scheme at the end of the Examinership process saw Revenue write off a huge portion of money owed to them, preferential creditors receiving 4c for every euro owed and unsecured creditors, who were owed over a million euro in total, received about 2 per cent of that figure. Players that were owed money received 2/3 of that owed to them. Some former players who were due money decided to waive the amount owed.\n\nEntering Examinership, Rovers had debts of 2.5 million euro and exited debt free having paid a significant six figure total as settlement. Obviously clubs racking up huge debts in the vain attempt in hitting the Champions or Europa League jackpot isn’t exactly fair on other clubs who manage their finances prudently. Therefore the League put in place rules that a club going into Examinership would be docked 10 points and both Drogheda United and Cork City received this sanction. That season Rovers were docked eight points during Examinership but this was due to the fact that it emerged that the previous club owners got the club’s licence on the basis of misleading financial accounts.\n\nDrogheda United’s troubles stemmed from the failed planning process on their proposed stadium in Meath. They had debts of over 700,000 euro with half a million owed to Revenue when they went into Examinership but with a fire sale of players and their supporters raising 300,000 euro, the club avoided being wound up and kept their place in the Premier Division so that they are able to come to Tallaght this week to play what could be called an “Examinership derby”.\n\nWhen Cork City went into Examinership last year, they had with debts of 1.3m euro with Revenue owed a quarter of that amount and their kit supplier owed 25,000 euro. Once again Dave Mooney was on the move as part of an Examinership sale. Cork received 400,000 euro from Reading for the former Rovers man. However, even after successfully negotiating the Examinership process, much to the fans disgust the club last month was back in the High Court facing a winding up order put in place by Revenue. In an incredible day in the Court, it seemed certain that another Cork club would go the way of Cork Athletic, Cork Alberts, Cork United, Cork Celtic etc. It took the intervention of a benefactor who lent them 200,000 euro money to prevent Cork City going out of business. However, despite the ruling, Cork City is still in some difficulty. A friendly match against a Celtic selection was to bring much needed funds to the club but the expected full house didn’t materialise. A low point was reached when the club nearly didn’t fulfil an away fixture against St. Patrick’s Athletic because the bus company hired wouldn’t leave Cork until their debts were paid. The situation in Cork remains unresolved with club owner Tom Coughlan and fans group FORAS in disagreement as to what way the club should be run.\n\nIt is safe to say that based on evidence to date that Shamrock Rovers is a good example of how Examinership can work. Rather than the club being liquidated, it is now an integral part of the Tallaght community bringing welcome money and good publicity to the South Dublin Country Council area. Our club gives employment to playing squad of 23 players and back room team and the club generates a tidy tax amount for the public coffers. The full houses in Tallaght all season have also generated large amounts of money for the exchequer. It was a self confessed Bohemians fan in Justice Frank Clarke who presided over the Rovers Examinership case and his decision has meant that Rovers survived to play today and go head to head with Bohs for the 2009 League of Ireland title.\n\nArticle from Shamrock Rovers match day programme August 2009\n\nPhoto from http://www.gui.ie\n\nThis season Shamrock Rovers striker Gary Twigg is battling to win the League top goalscorer title having reached 15 goals by half way through the season. Five years ago Twigg was lining out on loan with English Conference side Burton Albion while Shamrock Rovers’ top goalscorer that season was Stephen Grant. So where is our top scorer from that 2004 season now? Well Grant has swapped playing on the wing to playing from the fairway and now plays on one of the professional golf tours in the United States of America which is quite an interesting journey. So how did Birr native Grant journey from the League of Ireland to the US Hooters Pro Golf Tour?\n\nStephen Grant had two spells at Shamrock Rovers. After initially being on Sunderland’s books, he returned to Ireland and played 20 games back in the 96/97 season scoring four goals (including scoring on his debut against Bohemians). He then signed for Stockport County with Rovers picking up a cheque of around about £10,000. It was during his time at Stockport he gained four Ireland u21 caps. Grant came back to Rovers in 2001 via a series of clubs including Burnley, Waterford United, Galway United and he even had a spell with Boston Bulldogs. During Rovers’ fine European run in 2003, Stephen Grant was an integral part of the team which became the first Irish side in over twenty years to win a tie both home and away in Europe. Grant scored the equaliser for the Hoops away to Odra Wodzislaw before Rovers got a late winner from his namesake Tony.\n\n2004 was to be his last year at Rovers and his last as a footballer. The year was a difficult one for Rovers with the club’s finances worsening and issues still very much unresolved on the stadium front in Tallaght. As the GAA began to delay the completion of the stadium project via the Courts, Grant was making almost weekly appearances in Croke Park. But he wasn’t playing, rather he was modelling GAA jersies in the Croke Park match programme. Spotted in a nightclub previously, he was signed up to Assets Model Agency and worked on a number of high profile advertisement campaigns as well as shoots with numerous fashion magazines and from this he earned the nickname of Zoolander with the Hoops faithful! Financially independent with business interests outside of football including a furniture business, property and family business in heating products, he also found time to indulge his passion for golf.\n\nAnd it was the golf he turned to as his main sporting interest when Rovers went into financial freefall towards Examinership in 2004. Playing in a number of Golf Union of Ireland events, he reduced his handicap from 16 down to 3. He won two Midland Alliance tournaments at Birr and Esker and competed in the Golf Links Winter Series.\n\nIn April 2007, he shot a course record 64 at the West of Ireland Championship in Rosses Point leaving up and coming golfing star Rory McIroy behind him in the field. He turned pro with the support of Horizon Sports Management who also have Graeme McDowell, Shane Lowry and Ross Fisher on their books and moved to Arizona to take part in the US Gateway Tour. He took a fifth place at Martin Downs Country Club and last year he took second place at the Broward Open in Florida and picked up his maiden win in America at the Inverrary Open.\n\nAs Grant told the Irish Sun last year:\n\n“I played soccer for 10 years and enjoyed it and this is a new challenge and I am really up for it. I’m hoping to play on the Europro Tour. I just want to see how good I really am.”\n\nThis year has been his most successful to date. Playing out of Palm Beach Gardens, he finished 21st on the money list on the Gateway tour’s “Beach Winter Series” in Florida including shooting a nine under par 63 to tie for tenth place at Palm Valley and finished 11th at the Fountain Country Club. He earned his playing card on the US Hooters Golf Tour. The tour is the third level of pro golf in the states below the Nationwide and top US PGA tour. Previous Hooters tour competitors include two time major winners John Daly and Lee Janzen, major winners and Ryder Cup players like Jim Furyk, Zach Johnson, Ben Curtis, Tom Lehman, David Toms and Chad Campbell.\n\nGrant has played five events so far this year in this very competitive tour and is currently placed in the top 150 of the tour which has 230 competitors and has picked up $4,000 in prize money. He is a bit off the number one spot which is held by Ted Potter (with $144,900 of earnings). Since May, Grant has been playing a number of events on the European Challange tour including the Credit Suisse Challange in Luterbach in Switzerland and the Karten Open in Austria.\n\nIt is a long way from the League of Ireland or a FAI Cup tie against UCD for Stephen Grant. We shall have to wait and see will any hidden golfing talent in our current squad emerge maybe at a future Shamrock Rovers Golf Classic? We certainly wouldn’t want to lose Gary Twigg for the lure of the links.\n\nArticle for Shamrock Rovers match day programme against Bohemians June 2009\n\nTonight we welcome Bohemians on their first visit to the Tallaght Stadium. It is a work in progress here and we hope on their next visit, later in the season, there will be another stand visible on the far side of the ground as you look from your seat tonight. The aim will be to accommodate a significant increase in spectators by that game with the capacity reaching towards 7,000. The history of the Tallaght Stadium project is a long one and the result is that Shamrock Rovers are now playing as anchor tenant in this municipal stadium owned by South Dublin County Council (SDCC).\n\nThis type of stadium ownership is by no means unique and there are a number of other clubs in Ireland with this structure unlike the privately owned stadium model such as Dalymount Park. Of course the Bohemian FC situation with Dalymount Park is a highly complicated one after a High Court ruling in November last year noted that Bohs hold a section of the ground in trust for a developer, Albion Enterprises Limited. This ruling puts in jeopardy another agreement Bohs made to sell their stadium to another developer. Danniger Ltd had made an agreement with Bohemians to buy Dalymount Park and move the club to a new Stadium near Castleknock. Bohemians have signalled their intent to take the matter to the Supreme Court. Like Shamrock Rovers, Bohemians is a members club and their members must await a court date, possibly two years in the future, before they know whether their plans to move to North County Dublin will come to fruition. As Rovers fans know, the courts move at their own pace so this matter will take a long time to resolve.\n\nFor Rovers, the process of gaining and losing ownership of this 12 acre site began in 1997. Then SDCC granted a lease to Rovers to build a stadium on the site that you see today. After a ruling by An Bord Pleanála, construction began in 2000. However, after investing a large amount of money including Sports Capital Grants, Sponsorship including some from Umbro Ireland and the club’s own funds, construction ceased in late 2001. Planning permission lapsed in 2004 and SDCC served forfeiture notices on the lease on the stadium from the previous Shamrock Rovers owners. The site, which can be viewed from SDCC’s offices, with its unfinished stadium had become an eyesore on the emerging modern landscape of Tallaght. SDCC and the Department of Sport, under the ministership of now Ceann Comhairle John O’Donoghue, must be congratulated for their willingness to put measures in place to complete the stadium. SDCC recognised what Rovers, who were already firmly embedded in the community with under age teams and scholarship systems, would further bring to Tallaght. They stood firm, with Rovers and support from the FAI, in defeating the High Court Judicial Review taken out by the GAA.\n\nIn Ireland, Derry City FC, Waterford United & Sporting Fingal all play their home games in facilities provided by their local authorities. Waterford Corporation funded the expansion of the RSC grounds bringing the seated capacity from 1750 up to in excess of 3000. Meanwhile Sporting Fingal currently play in a venue most Rovers fans try to forget, Morton Stadium. Fingal County Council has begun discussions about developing new facilities which Sporting Fingal would have access to. Cork City are anchor tenants in Turners Cross which is owned by the Munster FA who have increased the capacity to 7500 in one of the best stadia in the country. However, at the end of last month Drogheda United’s plans for a privately developed stadium at Bryanstown, County Meath, were abandoned after the objections by the National Road Authority to the development were upheld by An Bord Pleanála. Long term development plans have now been replaced by short term ones for United Park which is now owned by the FAI.\n\nThe municipal stadium model is one that is used extensively in Italy in conjunction with ground sharing for even the biggest clubs. In Milan, the San Siro stadium, owned by the Comune di Milano, is home to Internazionale one week and then Milan the next. Originally Milan’s home ground, Inter have played there since 1947. The Stadio Olimpico in Rome is owned by the Municipality of Rome home to the tifosi of Roma and Lazio on alternate weekends. The venue for last month’s game between Italy and Ireland was the municipal stadium in Bari. Similar to Rome and Bari, the Stadio delle Alpi in Turin, was developed for the 1990 World Cup by the local council. All three stadia have running tracks around the pitch which push the fans further away from the action. In the case of Bari and Turin, the running tracks were rarely used with poor sightlines for football spectators. The delle Alpi was not the most popular venue with Torino or Juventus fans and so the stadium was recently demolished and a new stadium for Juventus is under construction in Turin on the site. Meanwhile, Juventus have returned temporarily, and Torino permanently, as tenants of Turin Council in the Stadio Comunale (where both teams played until 1990) which was built for the 1934 World Cup and upgraded for the recent Winter Olympics now rebranded as the Stadio Olimpico di Torino.\n\nThe great Maracana stadium is also a municipal stadium. This mecca of world football is owned by the Rio de Janeiro state government. Rio club’s like Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense have small home grounds and hence tend to play most home games in the Maracana Stadium. This was another stadium that was developed for a World Cup. For the 1950 World Cup final, the stadium held nearly 200,000. This was four times greater in capacity than the second biggest stadium at the time, Hampden Park. The stadium will host the 2014 World Cup final and its current capacity is a mere 95,000 seats and so is slightly bigger than Tallaght!\n\nThe stadium in Tallaght was used last month for the first time for international football. The Irish under 17 team played a friendly game in Tallaght Stadium when they beat Poland 4-2. SDCC were making the venue available for an FAI international fixture for the first and no doubt not the last time. The FAI Umbro Intermediate Cup Final took place last week here in the Stadium with Crumlin United beating Bluebell United in an exciting 3-2 encounter. The FAI has been a firm supporter of the venue and aim to play a number of their fixtures here affording South Dublin County Council the opportunity of showcasing their venue to the wider football community. However tonight it is the citizens of South County Dublin, and the many other areas that Rovers draw their fans from, that will be cheering on their Tallaght based team against our visitors from across the Liffey in Dublin City Council territory.\n\nArticle for Shamrock Rovers match day programme against Cork March 2009\n\nApril 12th 1997 was a sad day for Shamrock Rovers Football Club and its fans. This weekend marks the 22nd year anniversary of the last game in Glenmalure Park which brought the curtain down on Shamrock Rovers playing in Milltown. Happily for the club, last month saw the Hoops play their first home game in Tallaght after a 22 year stadium odyssey.\n\nNo Irish football club in recent history has been as synonymous with their stadium as Shamrock Rovers have been. When the name Shamrock Rovers is mentioned, some people may think of the record 15 league titles and 24 FAI Cups in our possession. However, most will think of the sale of Milltown and the Tallaght Stadium saga. Over the past decade, if Rovers fans had a euro for every time somebody asked them “What is happening with that stadium in Tallaght?” the club would have some very rich benefactors. The stadium nightmare that fans, who are now the club owners, have endured is one that we have only now just woken up from.\n\nThe journey to Tallaght began with the eviction from Milltown in 1987. The disgraceful sale of Glenmalure Park by the Kilcoyne family spelt disaster for Shamrock Rovers. The club moved to Tolka Park for the next season but a boycott of the ground by fans forced the Kilcoynes to sell the club. The new owners brought Rovers to Dalymount Park temporarily before the Hoops settled in the RDS in 1990. Over 22,000 fans packed into the Ballsbridge venue for the opening game but Rovers couldn’t hang on to those crowds in the long term. We were to win our only league title since the sale of Milltown during that six year tenure in the RDS.\n\nIt was in 1997 that Shamrock Rovers began to look at leaving the RDS, after demolition works left a one sided stadium in the Dublin 4 venue, and move to a stadium to be constructed in Tallaght. Rovers, now playing again in Tolka Park, negotiated a lease for land in Tallaght from South Dublin County Council (SDCC). It was the beginning of a planning and legal battle that would last a further eleven years. Planning permission was granted in January 1998 but this was then appealed. It took a further two years before the first sod was turned in the stadium by the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, with full construction beginning in autumn of that year. The club ran into financial difficulty in November 2001 and work on the stadium ceased. During this time Rovers played in Morton Stadium, Tolka Park, Richmond Park and even played a home game in Cork against tonight’s opposition before moving on to Dalymount Park.\n\nThe game in Cork in autumn 2003 proved a real low point for the club. Evicted from Richmond Park, fans were disgusted, having travelled 250 km to see their team play in a home game, to see the team emerge in their away jersey rather than green and white hoops. The relationship with the board and the fans group, the 400 Club, began to become frayed. The owners applied for an 18 month extension to the planning permission on the stadium, which had now lapsed. This was refused by SDCC as they saw no prospect of work resuming. SDCC sought repossession of the site in January 2005. The club was in financial meltdown and in April 2005, the High Court appointed an Examiner to prevent liquidation of the club. After all the property speculators drifted away, it was the fans group, the 400 Club that emerged with ownership of the club. This was a three year period when Rovers fans were reading High Court reports as well as football match reports.\n\nIn July 2005, SDCC, in consultation with the fans, now club owners, pressed ahead with plans to complete the stadium with Rovers as their anchor tenant. A new barrier was to emerge at this time. The GAA, through Thomas Davis GAA club, objected to the fact that the stadium size did not allow for senior GAA games. Pressure from the GAA saw the local councillors go against the SDCC County Manager’s recommendations and vote to alter the stadium to accommodate a GAA pitch. However, the Department of Sport stated they would not fund this alteration as the existing structure would have to be modified and the capacity would be reduced to 4,500. In February 2006, as Rovers returned to play another season in Tolka Park, the Councillors voted to reverse their previous decision and proceed with the original soccer sized stadium. In December 2006, Thomas Davis, took out a High Court Judicial Review of that decision. Rovers fans at this stage were beginning to wonder whether the stadium site was cursed with an Indian Burial ground.\n\nThomas Davis had the full arsenal of the GAA behind them in the case to prevent the youth of Tallaght from being raised “on a diet of association football” (as they stated in their submission to the High Court). The Dublin GAA County Board, the GAA Director General and then GAA president Nickey Brennan were all vocal in supporting the Thomas Davis stance that the stadium in Tallaght should be made “big enough to accommodate GAA matches”. In December 2007, Justice Roderick Murphy ruled in favour of SDCC, and Shamrock Rovers, and against Thomas Davis. It is a decision the GAA over a year later are still not happy with complaining in their recently published Annual Report that the “decision remain(s) a huge bone of contention within the GAA”. However, they chose not to appeal to the Supreme Court so six months after the decision works began again on the Stadium. When the builders returned at the start of May 2008, they didn’t quite know what to make of it as Rovers fans descended on the Stadium to see with their own eyes that construction had begun again.\n\nMarch 13th 2009 was a momentous day for Shamrock Rovers Football Club and its fans. The opening game in Tallaght was an amazing occasion. The passion and noise generated as the teams came out was almost overwhelming and many a tear was shed on the night. 22 years of pent up frustration at the loss of Milltown and a home of our own, spilled out in a wall of noise. As our new Umbro home jersey says, “Glenmalure Park gone but not forgotten”. The sale of Milltown will no longer be a millstone around the football club’s neck. Our new base in Tallaght is the beginning of a new chapter over 22 years in the making. Let us hope that the return to a permanent home ground will see the return of silverware to the club to parade around the new stadium.\n\nArticle for Shamrock Rovers match day programme (March 2009)\n\nDifferent football clubs have different ownership structures. Some clubs are very much shaped by their Chairman. Chelsea have an oligarch, Shelbourne had an Ollie Byrne. The fans of Shamrock Rovers Football Club took over the ownership of the club back in July 2005. The club had gone into Examinership earlier that year. At the end of that Examinership period, the Shamrock Rovers fans group, the 400 Club, were the last man standing and took control of the club. We are now a members club which operates on a one member- one vote principal. The members elect the board of directors who run the club. Tomorrow will see the AGM of Shamrock Rovers Football Club taking place across the road from the Tallaght Stadium in the Maldron Hotel.\n\nThe Shamrock Rovers membership model has provided great stability for the Hoops in turbulent times for both the club and for League of Ireland football. Rovers have prepared a budget in recent seasons and have stuck to it. The wide number of members with diverse expertise and a huge amount of enthusiasm is a great resource to call upon for the club. Supporter involvement in running clubs helps with ensuring good corporative governance as well as ensuring a certain level of democracy.\n\nMany Irish football clubs have struggled to pay player wages and other bills in recent years. Some clubs have gone full time and have struggled with the wage bill and reverted to part time status or have let players go. Clubs like Sligo Rovers, Galway United and St. Patrick’s Athletic have all found themselves having to cut their cloth. While Kilkenny City has folded, Cobh Ramblers have dropped to the A Championship with Cork City and Drogheda United entering, and successfully exiting, Examinership.\n\nThe membership model is different from the shareholding model that was in vogue in the 1980’s. Clubs like Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United floated on the stock exchange making their owners very rich. While fans could buy shares, their shareholding was dwarfed by a small number of shareholders, including some financial institutions, who held most of the shares. Rather than reinvest all of the profits from the club on the pitch or in stadium development, shareholding dividends were issued to the members. At Manchester United in 2005, Shareholders United had over 35,000 members who were United shareholders but they could not prevent the Glazer family taking over the club. Fans at English clubs have changed unwanted owners like Martin Edwards or Ken Bates for another set in Glazer or Gillette and Hicks. While some “foreign” owners like Randy Lerner at Aston Villa and Roman Abromavich at Chelsea have seen their clubs be more successful on the field, the sense of detachment from the fans to the clubs owners and players continues.\n\nYet the membership model is a tried and trusted model for many clubs. The two biggest names in Spanish football are members clubs in Real Madrid and Barcelona who have in excess of 150,000 members. Members elect the club president who in the past as part of their election campaign stated if elected they will bring a certain star player to the club. Maybe we will see one of the Directors seeking re-election at the Rovers AGM tomorrow promising to bring a star Tallaght player such as Robbie Keane or Richard Dunne to the club if elected!\n\nIn Germany, Bundesliga clubs are members clubs with the Clubs administrators elected by the membership. At least 51% of the ownership of any Bundesliga club must be held by the football club members. While in Britain recently there has been a plethora of non-British club owners, the membership model is being promoted by the organisation Supporters Direct. Their aim is to promote supporters involvement at the highest level in the running of football clubs through football trusts. Such football trusts now own or control a number of clubs in British football including English club Stockport in League 1 and three clubs in League 2 (Brentford, Exeter & Notts County). In Scotland, fans were successful in taking over Clydebank and Gretna. The new Gretna club emerged following Gretna’s liquation after the death of owner Brooks Mileson who had been involved in discussion with taking over Shamrock Rovers during the Examinership period.\n\nSome clubs have maybe taken the membership element too far. Ebbsfleet United, managed by former Irish international Liam Daish, play in the Blue Square Premier Division. In 2008, they were taken over by an amalgamation of online football fans through myfootballclub.com. Their membership set the weekly playing budget and vote on all transfer dealings. Last month, their membership voted to give free admission to their game attracting an 18 year high crowd to the game which was broadcast live online to their membership. Their membership numbers have dropped in recent months but it is a membership experiment that many are watching with interest.\n\nIn America, Seattle was invited to take up a place in the top division of Major League Soccer for the 2009 season. Seattle comedian Drew Carey was instrumental in setting up their members club with the Seattle FC Alliance voting on the General Manager. A vote was also held to choose the team name with nearly 50 % of the 15,000 members voting for the name Seattle Sounders.\n\nAt Shamrock Rovers, our membership structure provides vitally important financial support as well as providing democratic structures for the club. If you are interested in taking ownership of part of this great Irish sporting institution, membership details are available on the web (http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/members/) and new members are always welcome. The greater the size of our membership, the stronger a club we can become."
