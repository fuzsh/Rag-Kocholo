        "text": "The Ben Doherty who is back at the Brandywell is a different player and person to the one that left Derry City five years ago.\n\nWith that surname, he was under the spotlight as he tried to establish himself with the Candystripes.\n\nHis father, Eamon, made over 200 appearances for the club in an eight year spell before Ben was born.\n\nREAD MORE:Bohs players have Declan Devine's 'absolute trust' as they face a 72 hour acid test of credentials\n\nDoherty junior left as a 21-year-old and with a year to run on his City contract.\n\n\"I don't think Derry fans saw the best of what I could do and, at the time, it was probably the best decision for me to go and experience men's football,\" said Doherty.\n\n\"By going to Coleraine, Larne and Glenavon and doing well, I made my own name.\n\n\"I proved myself in a way but there would have still been questions around whether I would fit into the League here.\n\n\"But I've played over 200 games now for a few different clubs, played in a lot of positions and have experienced big European nights.\n\n\"I had full belief coming back that I would show something different to what Derry fans had seen.\n\n\"Look, I think they're now seeing the best of me in terms of showing my fitness and quality. It's just a matter of keeping it going for myself.\"\n\nAsked if his dad was glad that he is a Derry player again, Doherty replied: \"I think he was glad he didn't have to do that drive to Larne every week!\n\nHe was playing in a Larne side that was top of the Premiership when he received the offer to come home.\n\nThere was surprise in some quarters that he accepted it, given Larne's position. But the 25-year-old grew weary of the daily commute from Foyleside and seized the opportunity.\n\nHe did the same when his chance came in the second game of the season.\n\nA midfielder by trade, he has been a fixture in the City defence since and made an early mark with an outstanding goal on the counter in the victory at champions Shamrock Rovers.\n\n\"There was probably question marks over what sort of player was coming back,\" he said.\n\n\"I've no problem with people's opinions. That's what makes football so good, and I'm big enough now to know that.\n\n\"When I was younger, that might have been part of my problem that I thought everyone should be liking me.\n\n\"I went away and learned that not everyone thinks you're as good as you think you are. But as long as you keep a small circle around you of people you trust, you'll be fine.\"\n\nHis dad won a FAI Cup with the club but not a League title.\n\n\"Everyone wants that, don't they,\" Doherty said. \"You want to be competing at the top end, we want to be winning those major honours.\n\n\"We've had a good start, it's just about kicking on for us. We have players who have been there and done it, Patrick McEleney and Mickey Duffy especially stand out and what they have achieved is rubbing off on very good young players.\n\n\"The quality is definitely there in the Derry dressing room.\"\n\nDoherty has noticed that quality is now around the League and has raised standards.\n\n\"That's the main difference from before,\" he said. \"I played against Fabrice Hartmann from Sligo recently and he's on loan from RB Leipzig. That didn't happen when I was first here.\n\n\"It feels like it has gone to a new level.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nSeamus Power sends Augusta crowds wild with two hole-in-ones IN A ROW\n\nJames Lowe says Leinster must on cash in on 'luxury' of home advantage in the Champions Cup\n\nChantelle Cameron responds to claim she had fellow boxer Ellie Scotney removed from Katie Taylor undercard\n\nWaterford look set to be without key trio for start of Munster Championship\n\nWhat Ireland's starting XI could look like at the 2030 World Cup"
