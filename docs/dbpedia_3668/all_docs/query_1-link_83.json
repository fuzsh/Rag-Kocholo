        "text": "5.6K\n\nShamrock Rovers vs Derry City – Monday 4th March 2024 – KO 7.45pm – Tallaght\n\nSSE Airtricity Premier Division\n\nLast season’s top two in the Airtricity Premier Division table go head-to-head on Monday evening as the Candystripes head to Tallaght to take on Shamrock Rovers in front of ‘live’ Virgin Media cameras.\n\nIt’s one of those contests that always has the feel of being vital for both teams’ title aspirations, even if it comes unrealistically early for that type of billing this time around.\n\nThe hosts have had a few extra days to prepare, coming into the game as they do on the back of their postponed fixture against Drogheda on Friday night.\n\nIn normal circumstances that might be seen as an advantage ahead of such a key fixture, but it’s possibly less so this time with Rovers having only picked up one point from their opening two matches of 2024.\n\nRuaidhri Higgins will be well pleased that his side have taken seven points from their three outings to date, including a thrilling injury-time win over St Pats at the Brandywell on Friday past.\n\n“Obviously they’re going to be fresh with their game against Drogheda United having been called off, but listen, we’ve played Friday, Monday, Friday for a long time now, so it’s nothing that the players aren’t used to.\n\n“Hopefully the momentum gathered from Friday night will stand us in good stead going into this one.”\n\n“Rovers were excellent from probably the 30 minute mark on in their game against Shels, and I think we all know by this stage the threat that they pose, and we’ll have to be prepared for that.”\n\n“They’ve obviously got plenty of talent in their squad, but so do we, and I’m sure it will be an exciting game.”\n\nThe visitors were without Sadou Diallo, Patrick McEleney and Cameron Dummigan for the weekend win over the Saints, however they have no fresh concerns following on from that and are likely to name an unchanged panel for Monday.\n\nThe game kicks off at 7.45pm live on Virgin Media Three (in Ireland, elsewhere LOITV).\n\nLOITV\n\nWatch our games live on LOITV.ie for €7 per game.\n\nOr get your season pass for €120, which gives access to the rest of the games in the league.\n\nCoverage\n\nYou can also follow the match via our social media presence.\n\nFollow our Twitter for live updates, like us on Facebook for the full-time post or follow the action on our Instagram story."
