        "text": "by Wes Goldberg\n\nKevin Durant has spent his NBA career touring the country, ingratiating himself to different fanbases before making a complicated exit. The through-line for it all has been his place on Team USA.\n\nby Jack Tien-Dana\n\nWhereas Jamal Murray once complemented Nikola Jokic, he's now wholly dependent on him; he's jerry-rigged his game around Jokic such that he can't stand on his own. Yet he remains irreplaceable for the Nuggets.\n\nby John Wilmes\n\nAuthenticity is hard to confirm in the haze of multi-billion, international entertainment products, but what's clear to all about Jaylen Brown is that he really does want to mess with your understanding of how the league works."
