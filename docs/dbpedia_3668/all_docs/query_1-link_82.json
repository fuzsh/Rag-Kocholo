        "text": "The Challenge\n\nDerry City Football Club is a professional association football club based in Derry, Northern Ireland. It plays in the League of Ireland Premier Division, the top tier of league football in the Republic of Ireland, and is the League of Ireland’s only participant from the north of Ireland. The club’s home ground is the Brandywell Stadium and the players wear red and white striped shirts from which its nickname, the Candystripes, derives.\n\nWith the logo containing so many visual elements that connect to the city of Derry, the objective was to simplify the brand to make the graphic more approachable and adaptable to a newer generation that is focused on digital platforms and technology while keeping the heritage and story of the original icon.\n\nProposal for Derry City Football Club created by ⓒ 2021 Christopher Scott\n\nDisclaimer: This personal project may not reflect the views or plans of Derry City Football Club."
