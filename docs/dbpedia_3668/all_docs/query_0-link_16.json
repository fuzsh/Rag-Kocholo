        "text": "20.2K\n\nDerry City vs Bohemians – Friday 9th September 2022 – KO 7.45pm – Brandywell\n\nSSE Airtricity League – Premier Division\n\nMatch sponsored by Hivolt Capacitors\n\nThe home side will be hoping to make it three league wins on the bounce when they entertain Bohemians in front of ‘live’ RTÉ cameras at Brandywell on Friday night (KO 7.45).\n\nRuaidhrí Higgins’ men are actually unbeaten in domestic competition since losing at the Sligo Showgrounds in May and the City boss will be hoping that they can continue that run this weekend.\n\nThe visitors’ dugout will have a new look about it of course, as Derek Pender and Trevor Croly have taken at least temporary charge following the departure of Keith Long, and the Derry manager felt that Bohs would be a potent threat regardless of who was in the hotseat.\n\n“It’s never nice to see anyone lose their job, but Keith can be very proud of the progress the club has made while he has been manager” he said.\n\n“Obviously Derek and Trevor know the club and the league very well too.”\n\n“You’ll see it across the world that teams can get a bit of a bounce out of a change of management, so we have to be ready for that”\n\n“I’ve said it many times before that Bohemians boast some of the best attacking options in the league.”\n\n“They come into this on the back of their win over Shamrock Rovers and I’m expecting a very tough and close game.”\n\n“We’re on the run-in and our supporters have a huge role to play between now and the end of the season. I’m asking them to get right behind us as we look to finish as strongly as possible. ”\n\nWill Patching and Declan Glass will face late fitness tests for the hosts who otherwise have a full squad to chose from.\n\nTickets\n\nTickets are available in outlets. List here.\n\nCoverage\n\nYou can also follow the match via our social media presence.\n\nFollow our Twitter for live updates, like us on Facebook for the full-time post or follow the action on our Instagram story."
