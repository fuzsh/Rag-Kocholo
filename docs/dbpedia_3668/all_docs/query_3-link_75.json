        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Trevor Thompson's hook shot in the first half of Saturday's game against UConn seemed to catch everyone in the arena off-guard. It certainly surprised Ohio State coach Thad Matta.\n\nThompson got a defender on his back, then smoothly floated a quick shot over his shoulder that was part of a personal 6-0 run and an 8-0 Buckeye spurt. It was something Matta wasn't sure was in Thompson's offensive repertoire.\n\n\"It seems like he's calmed down a little bit more and has a great focus about how he's playing,\" Matta said. \"He's starting to get a little more instinctive, especially on the defensive end, which is good to see. He's not as robotic. He's challenging shots and making big plays.\"\n\nConsistency has eluded Ohio State and pretty much every player on the roster this season. That's why the Buckeyes are 8-2 with wins over Providence and UConn, a close loss they let get away at then-No. 6 Virginia and a home loss to Florida Atlantic.\n\nThey've been all over the place, and unpredictable. But Thompson's been the closest thing to consistent that the Buckeyes have had.\n\nHis 17 points and 17 rebounds in a win over UConn on Saturday highlighted the best game Thompson has played in his Ohio State career. Only Jared Sullinger, Greg Oden and Evan Turner have had other games of at least 17 and 17 in the last 20 Ohio State seasons.\n\n\"Definitely came into this game with a chip on my shoulder with how I played last year, and what happened (in the game),\" said Thompson, who went scoreless and looked overwhelmed in 13 minutes of a 20-point loss at UConn last year.\n\n\"I told myself before the game that I wanted revenge and payback. That's what my mind was on.\"\n\nAveraging 11 points and nearly nine rebounds per game off the bench so far, he seems to be the most improved player on the team from last season.\n\nBut just like everything with this team, you have to temper your expectations, and ask: Does Thompson's hot start mean the Buckeyes have reliable big man? Or are these blips that don't paint the full picture?\n\nMatta brings Thompson off the bench to try to off-set the quick foul he was prone to picking up early in games last year. His numbers might soon force a change to Matta's plan. Compared to the first 10 games of last seaon, Thompson's numbers are significantly up across the board:\n\nTrevor Thompson's first 10 games\n\nYet with as well as Thompson has been playing, Matta always seems to offer a qualifier before acknowledging his improved play: \"Yeah he played good, but.\"\n\nWhy is that?\n\n\"The focus ... he can drift sometimes,\" Matta said. \"(It's about) keeping him dialed in.\"\n\nRemember last year, when Thompson played so well in an upset of Kentucky against the Wildcats' NBA-caliber big men? Thompson looked like the best big man on the floor that day, but that game wasn't a catalyst for the rest of the season.\n\nYou still see some of those momentary lapses in focus, like at first not realizing what to do when he was getting double-teamed against Virginia. The first time it happened, Thompson turned the ball over:\n\nThe second time it happened, Thompson made the right read and found Andre Wesson for a layup:\n\nThose kind of lapses are happening less frequently. Thompson seems to be finding himself in better positions to score, more aware of where's at defensively and showing that he's a more capable shot-blocker than he was a year ago.\n\nSome of his improvement can be traced to Oden's presence on the Ohio State staff as a student manager.\n\n\"It's been a blessing,\" Thompson said. \"I don't think he realizes how much of an impact he's had on me and helped me with the mental aspect of my game.\"\n\nYou have to go back to the 2011-12 season, Sullinger's last in Columbus, to find the last time a Buckeye center was playing like this. Thompson is not Sullinger. That's not what this is about. But having a center you think can rely on, and maybe play through, is a big deal.\n\nThompson, for all of the mental miscues he had last season (and still has at times) seems ready to take on that responsibility.\n\n\"My biggest thing is I just want to win,\" Thompson said. \"I trust my coaches and I love this university. I love this team. I know what I have to do to help this team win and my main focus is this team.\"\n\nThompson has been Ohio State's best player in each of its last two games, one the loss to FAU and the other the win over UConn.\n\nIn those two games combined, Ohio State shot 6-for-38 from 3-point range while Thompson really had his way on the inside.\n\nImagine if Ohio State ever got Thompson and the shooters going at the same ... Matta's already thought about that.\n\n\"Given the inside presence that he has right now, the biggest thing is we gotta start shooting the ball better,\" Matta said. \"We're getting great looks and they're not going down for us. If we can get the inside-out, I like this basketball team.\""
