        "text": "• On Saturday, October 7, 1972, Derry City played their final game in the Irish League.\n\n• On Monday, October 9, 1972, the Irish League Management Committee met to vote on a proposal put forward by Portadown Football Club, that Derry should be allowed to return to play their home games at Brandywell.\n\n• On Friday, October 13, 1972, The Derry City board withdrew their membership of the Irish League.\n\n51 years ago this week, a significant chapter in the history of Derry City Football Club unfolded.\n\nFormer club chairman, Stephen Morgan – “Derry going out of football was like a death to me. Every day it seems worse to me than it did at the time.”\n\nIt commenced on Saturday, October 7, 1972, when Derry City took to the pitch for their final Irish League match against Distillery at Seaview in Belfast. A 2-0 defeat to the whites marked the conclusion of Derry’s uninterrupted 43-year membership in the league. The lineup for that historic last game included Mahon, Sharkey, McNutt, Duffy, O’Donnell, Melly, K. McCool, L. McCool, D. O’Doherty, B. Ward Sub Wilkinson\n\nJust two days later, a crucial decision loomed. Portadown Football Club’s proposal to permit Derry City to stage their home games at Brandywell faced a pivotal vote. The proposal was narrowly defeated by a 6-5 majority.\n\nThen, on Friday, October 13, 1972, General Manager Willie Ross, speaking on behalf of the Derry City board, reluctantly announced the club’s withdrawal from the Irish League.\n\n“In view of the decision of the Irish League Management Committee to ban Brandywell, a resolution was passed unanimously by the Board of Derry City Football Club that membership of the Irish league be withdrawn as from Friday.\n\n“The board have considered all relevant matters and in particular, the fact that the Management Committee of the Irish Football League have seen fit not to accept the recommendations, and indeed, the encouragement of the security authorities that a return to Brandywell was advisable.\n\n“At considerable cost to the club, Derry City for the past three years have kept football alive in the interest of the Irish League, and indeed the community at large, in what can only be described as the most difficult of circumstances.\n\n“We thank our players and supporters who have supported us in our difficult task for the past three years and hope that they appreciate that the Board have no alternative but to come to this decision”.\n\nDespite this decision, Derry City retained its membership in the Irish Football Association (IFA) through the North-West FA. To ensure the club’s survival, the first step taken was to apply for membership in the Northwest Saturday Morning League.\n\nThe challenges faced by the Brandywell Club were substantial. Gate receipts from matches played in Coleraine were almost non-existent, with Coleraine charging a nominal £20 fee to host Derry City’s games at the Showgrounds.\n\nIn fact, Coleraine often refused to accept payment during the season, demonstrating a remarkable display of sportsmanship during those difficult times. To keep the club in existence after two years of adversity was a commendable achievement by the directors of the club.\n\nIn another act of goodwill, Ards chairman Harold Black asked what Derry paid for the loan of the ground when his side played at Coleraine. Before he left the ground he handed the rent over and said: “that’ll pay the ground for one week anyway.”\n\nHarry Cavan, president of the Irish Football Association said: “I would sincerely hope that their leaving of the league is only a temporary measure. I sincerely regret this move, but it is not a decision of the making of the Irish League, and, in fact, has been forced on Derry through the circumstances of their surroundings. I will most certainly support any move for Derry to return to the league if and when possible.”"
