        "text": "Leroy McCourt is just one player shy of a Brighton Irish XI. The older brother of Celtic and Derry City legend Paddy McCourt, Leroy has been scouting for the Premier League side since 2016.\n\nAmong the 10 players who have secured moves to the Seagulls thanks to his recommendation are Evan Ferguson and Andrew Moran. Warren O’Hora, now a regular first-team player at MK Dons after a loan move was made permanent in 2021, is another.\n\nAnd there are more who are patiently making their way through the underage structures, hoping to one day join Ferguson and Moran, who made his Premier League debut last month against Everton, as first-team players.\n\nRead next: Patrick McEleney challenges Derry City to handle pressure and deliver on potential\n\nMark O’Mahony and Jamie Mullins are the most recent recruits. Ireland Under-19 striker O’Mahony made the move from Cork City last month for around €60,000, while Mullins joined from Bohemians.\n\nBrighton’s success in bringing players over from Ireland has helped polish McCourt’s reputation within the English game.\n\nHe was name-checked this week in an interview by Ian Buckman, Brighton’s head of academy, in the ‘i’ newspaper.\n\nThe article focused on the club’s successful Irish recruitment drive, with Buckman saying: “A lot of credit would have to go to John Morling, our previous academy manager.\n\n“John previously worked with the FAI and had good knowledge of the quality and talent over there. Leroy McCourt does a lot of great work for us and keeps an eye on the players.”\n\nMcCourt isn’t one to court publicity and has turned down several interview requests in recent weeks, including this one.\n\nBut it’s easy enough to build a profile of the man responsible for the greening of Brighton by chatting to others within the thriving Derry football community.\n\nAnd the rumours on the Bogside are that a number of Brighton’s Premier League rivals would love to lure him away from the Amex.\n\nMcCourt has been involved in football in one form or another since he was a child. He has coached Shane Duffy, Michael Duffy, the McEleney brothers Patrick and Shane, and Liverpool prospect Trent Doherty.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, he has been running teams in Derry at junior and senior level for the past 25 years, has achieved a UEFA B Licence and he passed his FIFA agent exam in 2012.\n\nHe is the secretary and a coach of Foyle Harps and has also coached his brother Patrick.\n\n‘I’ve spent time with Villarreal FC learning their unique culture, philosophy and style,’ his profile reads.\n\n‘I’ve made excellent contacts in Spain and helping to move players of top standard between Spain, Europe and in and out of Ireland and Britain.\n\n‘I now work full-time in my scouting role for Brighton & HA FC, mainly scouting all age groups throughout all Ireland and on occasions in Europe.’\n\nMcCourt has travelled to several countries to scout players, including Poland, Cyprus, Spain, Portugal and Lithuania.\n\nBut according to those in the know, he is most proud of his work in sending Irish youngsters to a club that has recently become a great friend to Irish football.\n\nOne insider claimed McCourt even recommended a 14-year-old Gavin Bazunu but Brighton were not interested at the time.\n\n“Leroy would watch a player and even if he was the best player in the world, but he wasn’t a nice person, he would not recommend that lad,” said another source, explaining McCourt’s philosophy.\n\n“He could do up to 1,400 miles a week looking at players. And he keeps in touch with every player he sends over.”\n\nMcCourt’s 10 finds for Brighton include goalkeeper Killian Cahill, who was signed last year from Shamrock Rovers. Defender James Furlong, currently on-loan at Motherwell, is another former Hoop.\n\nBohemians have supplied Ferguson, O’Hora and Jamie Mullins, while Leigh Kavanagh and Moran came from Bray Wanderers, and O’Mahony from Cork City.\n\nAnd from Irish League sides Linfield and Coleraine came Ruairi McConville and Ben Wilson respectively.\n\nAaron Connolly and Jayson Molumby both joined Brighton before McCourt’s arrival, although he is still thought to have had a hand in Connolly’s move from Mervue.\n\n“It’s been a great spell for Evan,” academy chief Buckman said earlier this week.\n\n“As an academy first and foremost we’re incredibly proud of him as we are of all the players that break through.\n\n“He came to us with good experience at Bohemians and really settled well, progressing through our Under-18s and Under-21s.\n\n“He’s a great character, very level-headed, down to earth, really hard working and his goals show his qualities, all different types of goals.\n\n“He’s a great finisher, his link-up play is very good. But his temperament and personality are first class and that really helps.”\n\nFerguson’s breakthrough is the reason that Premier League clubs are looking to rebuild their Irish scouting networks, says a pal of McCourt.\n\nAnd a number of them would love to have Brighton’s Irish eye on their side.\n\nFor now, however, he will continue to drive the length and breadth of the island with a Brighton crest on his coat, looking for more players who may one day dream of following in the footsteps of Evan Ferguson.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nEx-teammate highlights key to Paddy McLaughlin's Cliftonville success\n\nThat's What I Call Football podcast with Graeme Philson\n\nGary Haveron believes Larne are a different animal this season\n\nLafferty opens up on 10-game ban for sectarian slur and Kilmarnock regrets"
