He scored during a 3–1 home win over Home Farm on 8 September 1985.\n\nDerry City's first hat-trick in the League of Ireland was scored by Kevin Mahon away at Finn Harps on 15 December 1985.\n\nDerry City's record league defeat was to Shamrock Rovers in March, 2018. The score was 6–1.\n\nDerry City's record league victory was a score of 9–1 against Galway United in October, 1986.\n\nThe club's highest scorer in the League of Ireland is Mark Farren, who played for the club from 2003 until 2012. Farren scored 114 goals in 209 competitive appearances for the club.\n\nDerry City completed a treble in the League of Ireland 1988–89 season. Shamrock Rovers are the only others to have completed this feat — three times in total.\n\nDerry are one of only three clubs (the others are Shelbourne and Bohemians) who have won both the Irish Cup and the FAI Cup.\n\nDerry are the only team in Ireland to have won both the Irish League and the League of Ireland.\n\nDerry played in the first League of Ireland match ever to be shown live on television when they visited Tolka Park to play Shelbourne FC during the 1996–97 season. The game was broadcast on RTÉ's Network 2 and finished 1–1 with Gary Beckett scoring for Derry.\n\nIn 2005, Kevin McHugh became one of just a handful of current players to join the 38-strong group of players who have scored 100 or more League of Ireland goals in the modern era.\n\nDerry's 5–1 away win against Gretna FC at Fir Park, Motherwell in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup's Second Qualifying Round is the largest away winning margin for any League of Ireland team in European competition.\n\nDerry's FAI Cup final game against St. Patrick's Athletic on 3 December 2006 was the last soccer game ever to be contested at the old Lansdowne Road stadium before the commencement of planned re-development.[7] Derry won the wind-swept game 4-3 after extra-time.\n\nDerry City is a unique club, due to its troubled and fluctuant history, in that it is one of the few clubs from the United Kingdom (and the only club in Northern Ireland) to play in the league of another country – the league of the Republic of Ireland in the case of Derry City. (See Football clubs playing in the league of another country for further general information.)\n\nDerry City hold the record for the most League of Ireland Cup wins, having won the competition 11 times.\n\nIn 2018 Jack Doyle scored the 1500th League of Ireland goal for the club in a 1–0 win over Waterford at the Brandywell\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial club site:\n\nCityWeb\n\nNews and information sites:"
