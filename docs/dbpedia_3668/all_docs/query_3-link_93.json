        "text": "Just as they seek to trim down their regular-season roster, the Warriors are also adding players.\n\nThe Warriors signed free-agent center Trevor Thompson to their training camp roster, and will be available for Friday’s preseason-finale against the Sacramento Kings at the Oracle.\n\nThe Warriors have a 19-player roster, and plan to make roster cuts following Friday’s preseason-finale to reach the league maximum 15-player roster for Tuesday’s season opener against Houston. So, there’s a good chance Thompson will play with the Warriors’ G-League affiliate in Santa Cruz.\n\nThe 23-year-old Thompson posted career-highs in points (10.6), rebounds (9.2) and blocks (1.5) during his junior year last season at Ohio State. The 7-foot-0 Thompson also played with the Boston Celtics’ summer-league team in Las Vegas, where he averaged 2.3 points, 1.5 rebounds and 7.8 minutes in four games."
