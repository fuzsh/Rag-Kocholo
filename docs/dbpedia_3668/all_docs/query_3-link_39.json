        "text": "Since leaving Ohio State following the 2016-17 season, Trevor Thompson has worked to show how his game has grown.\n\nNow, he’ll have a chance to demonstrate it on national television and potentially against some of his former teammates. Thompson, who was honorable mention all-Big Ten as a junior after averaging 10.6 points and 9.2 rebounds for the Buckeyes before leaving with a year of eligibility remaining, will participate in The Basketball Tournament as a member of team Red Scare."
