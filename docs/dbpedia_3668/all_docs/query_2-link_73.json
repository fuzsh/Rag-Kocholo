        "text": "Every now and again, football can change the world. It happened in war-torn 1980s Northern Ireland when an incredible series of events unfolded, creating an atmosphere in which a city could re-imagine itself, and its future.\n\nWorn down by years of violence in the Troubles, the city of Derry was on its knees, having spent 13 years without even a football team â€“ until four ex-footballers hatched a crazy plan. Could Derry City FC cross the hotly contested Irish border and play football in the Republic of Ireland, becoming the first team in the world to play on the other side of an international frontier?\n\nThis is the story of how they achieved their goal and the extraordinary seasons that followed, which transformed how the world saw Derry and how Derry saw itself.\n\nThis tale perfectly resonates as a story for today. At a time when globalisation is increasingly under the spotlight, the film shows how a local community can band together, triumphing over the odds and shattering the status quo."
