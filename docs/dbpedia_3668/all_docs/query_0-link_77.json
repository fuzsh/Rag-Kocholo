        "text": "Glentoran's Europa League showdown with Motherwell will be the FOURTH time the East Belfast club has locked horns with Scottish opposition in Europe.\n\nThe Ovalmen have also faced Rangers, Dundee United and Partick Thistle in UEFA competition dating back to a 7-1 aggregate defeat to Thistle in the old Fairs Cup in 1963.\n\nThe Big Two giants have yet to beat a Scottish club in Europe and will hope to change that record when they step out against Stephen Robinson’s men at Fir Park on Thursday night.\n\nGlentoran’s first qualifying round tie with Motherwell will be the ninth time an Irish League club has gone toe-to-toe with a Scottish club in Europe.\n\nThe most memorable showdowns were Celtic’s Champions League meetings with Cliftonville and Linfield in 2013 and 2017 respectively.\n\nHere, we delve into the history books to recount the eight previous times Irish League clubs have faced up to the Scots on a European stage.\n\nLINFIELD v CELTIC\n\nChampions League, 2017\n\nCeltic won 6-0 on aggregate\n\nLinfield boss David Healy branded Celtic “exceptional” after the Scottish champions cruised to a 2-0 win in Belfast and 4-0 win in Glasgow.\n\nThe Blues acquitted themselves well at Windsor Park but lost to early goals from Scot Sinclair and Tom Rogic in a game marred by minor crowd disturbances.\n\nCeltic, managed by Brendan Rodgers, killed off the tie at Celtic Park with a brace from Sinclair and further goals from Rogic and Stuart Armstrong.\n\nFormer Linfield defender Chris Casement later recalled the problems Sinclair - who scored three goal across both legs - caused the Blues defence.\n\n“It was scary,” said Casement. “He was the toughest winger I’ve faced and I genuinely didn’t know what to do to stop him.\n\n“Brendan Rodgers came in after the game in Glasgow and said ‘don’t worry, he does that to most defenders’. He and Celtic were superb.”\n\nCLIFTONVILLE v CELTIC\n\nChampions League, 2013\n\nCeltic won 5-0 on aggregate\n\nLegendary former Cliftonville boss Tommy Breslin declined to park the bus when the Reds met Celtic in the Champions League seven years ago.\n\nBreslin, who tragically passed away 12 months ago, simply told his players to enjoy the experience of going toe-to-toe with the Scottish giants.\n\n“Celtic are world renowned and to play them at Solitude is unbelievable,” he said. “This is the biggest game in the club’s history bar none and we’ll give it a real go.”\n\nThe Reds weren’t disgraced but found themselves outgunned by Celtic's superior firepower in Belfast, losing 3-0 to goals from Giorgios Samaras, Mikael Lustig and James Forrest.\n\nThe Old Firm giants won the return leg in Glasgow 2-0 with goals from Efe Ambrose and Samaras, but it was an incredibly special moment for the North Belfast club.\n\nGeorge McMullan, who captained Cliftonville at Celtic Park, said: “It was as if we were playing against 20 men - they were coming at us from all angles - but it was an incredible experience.\"\n\nGLENAVON v KILMARNOCK\n\nUEFA Cup, 2001\n\nKilmarnock won 2-0 on aggregate\n\nKilmarnock required a last gasp goal to secure a 1-0 win at Mourneview Park en route to a 2-0 aggregate victory over Glenavon in the UEFA Cup in 2001.\n\nChris Innes bagged the winner three minutes into stoppage time as Killie came out on top in Lurgan to celebrate the Scottish club's first away win in Europe in 25 years.\n\nA disconsolate Glenavon boss Colin Malone said: “It was very cruel. I thought we did enough to get the draw, but fitness told and they managed to run us down.”\n\nKillie eased through to the next round of the competition with a 1-0 win at Rugby Park.\n\nGLENTORAN v DUNDEE UNITED\n\nUEFA CUP 1989\n\nDundee United won 5-1 on aggregate\n\nDundee United boasted a young Michael O’Neill in their ranks when they beat Glentoran in the old UEFA Cup in 1989.\n\nThe Scottish club, captained by Maurice Malpas, won 3-1 in Belfast, with Johnny Jameson on the scoresheet for the Glens who were managed by Tommy Jackson\n\nGoalscorer Jameson, who drew the Ovalmen level at 1-1, said: “Up until their second goal we played really well, but they are a good side and probably deserved the win.”\n\nJim McLean’s men put the tie beyond doubt with a 2-0 win at Tannadice thanks to goals from John Clark and Kevin Gallacher who went on to star for Blackburn Rovers.\n\nCOLERAINE v DUNDEE UNITED\n\nUEFA CUP, 1987\n\nDundee United win 4-1 on aggregate\n\nUnder newly installed floodlights at the Showgrounds, Coleraine narrowly lost 1-0 to Dundee United in the first leg of their UEFA Cup showdown 33 years ago.\n\nA bumper crowd turned up to see 20-times capped Scotland striker Paul Sturrock fire home the only goal of the game just before the break.\n\nAfterwards Dundee United boss Jim McLean said: “Obviously it’s a great result, but Coleraine made it awkward for us and put on a good show for their fans.”\n\nThe Scottish side went on to win the return leg 3-1 at Tannadice with Dessie Edgar on target for Coleraine who were managed by player boss Jim Platt.\n\nFuture Northern Ireland boss Michael O’Neill featured for Coleraine in the away leg before securing a move to Newcastle United the following month for £100,000.\n\nCOLERAINE v KILMARNOCK\n\nInter-Cities Fairs Cup, 1970\n\nColeraine won 4-3 on aggregate\n\nColeraine’s 4-3 aggregate win over Kilmarnock in the UEFA Fairs Cup is the only time an Irish League club has beaten Scottish opposition in Europe.\n\nThe Bannsiders, managed by the legendary Bertie Peacock, were held 1-1 in the home leg, but shocked Killie with a memorable 3-2 win at Rugby Park.\n\nThe Scottish side looked to be cruising when they went 2-0 ahead on home soil, but Coleraine hit back with a stunning comeback in the second half.\n\nDessie Dickson, who would go on to score a record 452 goals for the Ballycastle Road club, was the hero of the hour, bagging a 12-minute hat-trick to turn the tie on its head.\n\nThe Bannsiders went on to lose 4-1 on aggregate to Sparta Rotterdam of the Netherlands in the next round.\n\nGLENTORAN v RANGERS\n\nEuropean Cup Winners Cup, 1966\n\nRangers won 5-1 on aggregate\n\nThe only time Rangers have faced Irish League opposition in Europe was when they met Glentoran in the old European Cup Winners Cup in 1966.\n\nLegendary boss and former Celtic forward John Colrain led the Glens into the glamour tie against the eventual finalists just months after being appointed manager at The Oval.\n\nThe Big Two giants secured a famous 1-1 draw in East Belfast when Billy Sinclair scored a late equaliser after George McLean gave Rangers the lead.\n\nBut the Gers won the return leg 4-0 with Scotland’s Willie Johnston - who was infamously sent home from the 1978 World Cup after failing a drugs test - on the scoresheet.\n\nThe Ibrox club went on to reach the final, only to lose 1-0 after extra-time to German kingpins Bayern Munich in Nuremberg.\n\nGLENTORAN v PARTICK THISTLE\n\nInter-Cities Fairs Cup, 1963\n\nPartick Thistle won 7-1\n\nIn only their second outing in European competition, Glentoran suffered a 7-1 thumping at the hands of Partick Thistle in the old Fairs Cup in 1963.\n\nTrevor Thompson, who is still Glentoran’s all-time top scorer on 375 goals, was on target in a 4-1 defeat in Belfast, with Thistle running out 3-0 winners in the return leg.\n\nThe Glens team turned over by Partick included several notable players including Walter Bruce and Billy McCullough who made 529 and 555 appearances for the club.\n\nOnly Paul Leeman (597), Elliott Morris (741) and Colin Nixon (794) have played more times than McCullough for the Big Two giants.\n\nAND FINALLY...\n\nA very creditable mention for Derry City who - although not an Irish League club - had local fans on the edge of their seats with a memorable 7-3 aggregate win over Gretna in the Uefa Cup in 2006.\n\nThe highlight came in the away leg when braces from Kevin Deery and Ciaran Martyn and a Darren Kelly header propelled the Candystripes to a crushing 5-1 win over the Scottish First Division side.\n\nDerry went on to play Paris St Germain in the next round, losing 2-0 on aggregate to the French giants."
