Michael Duffy’s sublime headed equaliser on 69 minutes proved decisive as the Candy Stripes went through, 5-4 on aggregate.\n\nFor only the second time in the club’s history, Derry sealed their place in the third qualifying round of a European competition.\n\nBut for one player, there was another reason to celebrate.\n\nCity defender Ronan Boyce reached a personal milestone by making his 100th appearance in a Derry jersey. He played the full ninety minutes and delivered a solid performance that we are so used to seeing in the full-back role.\n\n“He is an outstanding young player with the right mentality and someone who can help drive this club forward and it wouldn’t surprise me in years to come if he became captain of this club.” – Ruaidhri Higgins.\n\nRonan is a graduate of the Derry City Academy and is one of its greatest success stories.\n\nSix years ago, in July 2017, he made his academy debut as a 16-year-old and quickly became an integral part of Gary Duffy’s Under-17 side. He made a substitute appearance as City defeated Dundalk 5-2 in the Mark Farren Memorial Cup and has gone from strength to strength ever since.\n\nThe defender, who joined the Brandywell side from his local club Swilly Rovers, made his senior competitive debut as a second-half substitute against Cork City in 2019. He scored his first senior goal in a 1-1 draw against Drogheda United in April 2021.\n\nRonan is the perfect role model for any academy prospects who are looking to pursue a full-time career in the game. His seamless transition from the youth set-up to a regular starter in the first team has been inspiring and shows what can be achieved with the proper attitude and application.\n\n“It’s great that Ronan has been given his first professional contract. He fully deserves this and it’s good for the club and the Academy as it shows what can be achieved.”\n\n“He’s a very good defender who is comfortable on the ball and he has a great attitude. Hopefully, he goes on to make many first-team appearances and has a long and successful career.” – Under-19 coach, Shaun Holmes.\n\nRonan was rewarded for his fine form with a call-up to the Republic of Ireland U21 squad for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers against Bosnia & Herzegovina and Luxembourg in August 2021.\n\nHe made 36 appearances and scored 7 goals in his first year as a senior professional. The Ramelton native was voted the Players’ Player of the Year in 2021.\n\nStill only 22 years old, Ronan is one of nine players in the current first-team squad to have progressed through the club’s youth set-up.\n\nWe would like to congratulate Ronan on his 100th appearance and look forward to seeing him make many more for the Club.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nInjured star ruled out of Super Cup NI\n\nInjured star ruled out of Super Cup NI\n\nDerry City prospect Mikey Harkin will miss the Super Cup NI tournament due to injury.\n\nIt is the worst possible feeling for the Dungiven native who was due to represent County Derry in the prestigious competition, which kicks off tomorrow (Monday 24), but he picked up an injury during a school game six weeks ago. He was hoping to recover in time, but unfortunately, it wasn’t to be.\n\nMikey, who has represented Northern Ireland at U16 level, is gutted to miss the tournament after putting his heart and soul into being ready.\n\nHe played his formative years with Dungiven Celtic and has been a prolific goal scorer at the Derry Academy since his debut in March 2022.\n\nHe is now working hard to get back to full fitness and will continue his rehabilitation with the Derry physio team this week and hopes to be back in action by the end of August.\n\nWe wish Mikey all the best in his recovery and look forward to seeing him back in action soon.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMcGinty scores first senior goal on his competitive debut\n\nAt just 17 years and 151 days, Tiernan McGinty marks dream debut with a goal.\n\nIt was a memorable evening for one Donegal native at the Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium on Friday evening.\n\nTiernan McGinty, who is from Falcarragh, came off the bench to score his first senior goal on his competitive debut for Derry City.\n\nThe talented midfielder converted from close range after some superb work by Ben Doherty to seal a fine 2-0 win over Cork City in the Airtricity League Premier Division.\n\nCommenting on his debut, City Manager Ruairdhrí Higgins had the following to say.\n\n“Amazing, 17 years of age, he was exceptional in training on Monday. That’s the reason why we put him on, he trained extremely well.\n\n“He’s got that capability of getting into the box and with that athleticism he can get goals from midfield.\n\n“I’m delighted for him.”\n\nMcGinty has produced a number of consistent performances in his time at the Derry City Academy and fully deserves the opportunity to showcase his talent on the national stage.\n\nAt just 17 years and 151 days, Tiernan still has time on his side to become a permanent feature in the first team, while a loan deal could also be a possibility to help further his development.\n\nHe becomes the second player from the academy to make his first-team debut this year, following in the footsteps of Drumkeen native Sean Patton, who made his bow against UCD last month.\n\nSince 2019, the Candy Stripes have handed ten products from the youth setup a senior debut, with six players coming from Donegal.\n\nA tireless worker with a strong mentality and an eye for goal, McGinty has been an ever-present in the academy squads since making his debut in the EA Sports U17 League fixture against Dundalk at Oriel Park in March 2022.\n\nMcGinty signed his first professional contract with the club in August 2022.\n\nTiernan played his junior football with Glenea United.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWeekend Results (Mar 4/5)\n\nIt was a mixed weekend of results for the Derry City
