        "text": "Carlos Peña, who moved into broadcasting after playing for parts of 14 seasons in the big leagues, is the newest member of the Detroit Tigers television broadcast team.\n\nThe team announced Tuesday that Craig Monroe would return as the club’s lead TV analyst alongside newly hired play-by-play man Jason Benetti.\n\nPeña will join Dan Petry, Kirk Gibson and Todd Jones as part of the rotation of analysts. All five are former Tigers players.\n\nPeña, 45, played first base for the Tigers from 2002-2005. After retiring in 2014, he joined MLB Network as a studio analyst. He has also worked as part of the broadcast teams for the Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox.\n\nBenetti is set to call at least 127 games this year. When he’s away on other assignments, longtime radio announcer Dan Dickerson will move into the TV booth. Greg Gania, radio voice of the Double-A Erie Seawolves, will be Dickerson’s primary replacement.\n\nIn addition to his TV duties, Monroe will be an occasional partner for Dickerson on the radio side. Bobby Scales and Andy Dirks will also serve as radio analysts for a large number of games in 2024.\n\nMonroe played for the Tigers from 2002-2007 during his nine-year Major League career. He began contributing to the Tigers’ broadcasts as a studio analyst in 2012.\n\nThe Tigers decided to part ways with play-by-play man Matt Shepard after the 2023 season. They hired Benetti from the Chicago White Sox in November.\n\nOther familiar members of the Bally Sports Detroit crew will be back in 2024: Hosts John Keating and Mickey York; and reporters Johnny Kane, Trevor Thompson and Natalie Kerwin.\n\nCameron Maybin, who contributed to both radio and TV broadcasts in 2023, will not be back in 2024.\n\nThe Tigers also announced Tuesday that they will double their Spanish radio broadcasts to 45. All weekend series at Comerica Park in 2024 will have a Spanish audio feed.\n\nTIGERS’ BROADCASTS in 2024\n\nTV\n\nLead play-by-play: Jason Benetti\n\nBackup: Dan Dickerson\n\nLead analyst: Craig Monroe\n\nOther analysts: Carlos Peña, Dan Petry, Kirk Gibson and Todd Jones\n\nRadio\n\nLead play-by-play: Dan Dickerson\n\nBackup: Greg Gania\n\nAnalysts: Bobby Scales, Andy Dirks, Craig Monroe\n\nReporter: Daniella Bruce\n\nSpanish radio\n\nLead play-by-play: Carlos Guillen\n\nAnalyst: Barbaro Garbey"
