        "text": "Sandra Colleen Waites (born 15 December 1948 â€“ 28 December 1991) known professionally as Cassandra Harris, was an Australian actress.\n\nAustralian actress Cassandra Harris was born Sandra Colleen Waites, the daughter of Walter (Wally) Waites, a builder, and Roma, a hairstylist. After her mother divorced and then remarried, Sandra took her stepfather's surname of Gleeson. She studied at Narrabeen High School in Avalon, then worked at a local estate agents before enrolling in Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney. She met and married Bill Firth in 1964, but the pair soon divorced.\n\nHer first acting role was as an air-stewardess in a play called \"Boeing Boeing\" at the Palace Theatre in Sydney. She soon after landed a part in the Australian TV Show \"Beauty and the Beast\" and an early Bruce Beresford film, \"Five Days\". By the late '60s, she left her native Australia to live in London and became known as Cassandra. There she met producer Dermot Harris and had two children with him. She went on to win several acting roles, including appearances in the TV series \"Space: 1999\" and \"Dick Barton Special Agent\". Her first big screen role came in \"The Greek Tycoon\" in 1978. Her relationship with Dermot Harris ended soon after and she won another acting part, this time in 1980's \"Rough Cut\". Around the same time, she met the would-be Bond actor Pierce Brosnan and the couple married on 27th December 1980.\n\nIn 1987, Harris was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, the same disease that claimed her mother's life. Harris battled the illness for four years until she died from it on 28 December 1991, aged 43. On 28 June 2013, her daughter Charlotte died from the same disease at age 41.\n\nCountess Lisl von Schlaf, James Bond \"For your Eyes Only\" (1981)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_Harris"
