        "text": "Post by Barbara on\n\nThis year on the 28th is the 30th anniversary of the death of Cassandra Harris, Pierce's first wife who put him on Cubby Brocoli's radar.\n\nI was thinking it would be nice if we could start something where folks watch For Your Eyes Only, her Bond movie, on the 28th and send some money to Stand Up to Cancer, or some other charity. (I don't think you can donate directly to the Brosnan Trust at the SAG).\n\nHow about it? Wbo's in?\n\n-- Xen\n\nPost by Barbara on\n\nWe must belong to the same group because I read that too Eaz. It is a gorgeous piece but my only quibble is I think Cassandra Harris very much and voluntarily made her husband Bond, and much more importantly made Pierce a man Bond would admire.\n\nPost by Barbara on\n\nDid anyone do it? I am ashamed to say I have yet to make it through the whole movie. I had to crank out my DVD because for some reason the film is not up on Pluto TV or Amazon right now.\n\nPost by Barbara on\n\nI did finally watch it, and if you did too, please let me know so I can make that collage."
