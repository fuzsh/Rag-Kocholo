He shares Christopher, Sean, and Charlotte with his first wife, the late actress Cassandra Harris. He shares Dylan and Paris with his current wife, Keely Shaye Smith.\n\nPierce Brosnan always wanted his kids to “feel like they belong” and “know the love of family.” In 2008, he expressed how much he values the time he spends with his children, emphasizing the importance of their presence in his life.\n\nThe deaths of his wife Cassandra in 1991 and his daughter Charlotte in 2013 from ovarian cancer profoundly impacted him, making him even more aware of the precious time spent with his children.\n\nPierce taught his kids essential skills such as “preparation, passion, confidence, and showing up on time.” However, he encourages them to avoid pursuing a career in acting, preferring that they find their paths away from the challenges of the film industry.\n\nChristopher Brosnan, Pierce Brosnan’s estranged son, recently made a rare public appearance in London. He was seen running errands at a Waitrose grocery store on June 21, 2024. This outing marked one of the few times Christopher has been seen publicly in recent years.\n\nPierce Brosnan recently shared a heartfelt glimpse into his Father’s Day celebration on Instagram.

It was a joyful Father’s Day“.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Pierce Brosnan’s children: Sean, Chris, Charlotte, Dylan, and Paris.\n\nMeet Pierce Brosnan’s Kids\n\nPierce Brosnan has five children: Christopher, 51, Sean, 40, Dylan, 27, Paris, 23, and his late daughter, Charlotte.
