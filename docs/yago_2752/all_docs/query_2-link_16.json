        "text": "An experienced actor with a stage pedigree in her native Australia, Cassandra Harris was best known for her appearance as the second Bond girl in \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981), as well as for her devoted marriage to future 007 star, Pierce Brosnan. Born Sandra Colleen Waites on December 15, 1948 in Sydney, Australia, Harris began her acting career at 12 years old, when she enrolled at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1961. A few years later, she gained stage experience in a Sydney production of \"Boeing-Boeing\" (1964-65), French playwright Marc Camoletti's classic comedic farce. From there, Harris developed into a successful actor in her native country before beginning to appear in movies like \"The Greek Tycoon\" (1978), a jet set film detailing the lives of the rich and famous that was poorly reviewed before becoming a bomb at the box office. After a small turn in the heist thriller, \"Rough Cut\" (1980), starring Burt Reynolds, she had a small, but pivotal turn as the Countess Lisl von Schlaf - mistress to Milos Columbo (Chaim Topol), a former smuggler turned ally to James Bond (Roger Moore) - in \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981). At the time of filming, Harris was already married to her famous husband, Pierce Brosnan, whom she met at the National Theatre in London some years earlier. Harris had met privately with Bond producer, Albert R. Broccoli, to first pitch the idea of Brosnan playing 007."
