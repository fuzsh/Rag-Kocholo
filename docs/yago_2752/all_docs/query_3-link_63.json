        "text": "To us, Pierce Brosnan is an accomplished actor (James Bond, Mamma Mia!, Mrs Doubtfire…) but to his wife, Keely Shaye Smith, he’s the “finest, loveliest, tenderest person” she’s ever known.\n\nAfter first meeting on a beach in Mexico in 1994, Pierce and Keely quickly began dating.\n\nThen on August 4 in 2001, the couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony held at Ballintubber Abbey in Ireland – Pierce’s country of birth.\n\nPierce and Keely share two sons, Dylan Thomas Brosnan – born in January 1997 – and Paris Beckett Brosnan – born in February 2001.\n\nAnd as of 2024, Pierce and Keely have been together for 30 years and married for 23.\n\nOn August 4 this year, the couple celebrated the milestone anniversary by taking to Instagram.\n\n“Happy 23rd anniversary my darling Keely, my beautiful brown eyed girl, my north, my south, my east and west. All my love, should I fall behind, wait for me,” Pierce wrote.\n\n“August 4th, 2001, Ashford Castle, County Mayo, Ireland. You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known,” Keely captioned a throwback picture of the wedding.\n\n“Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together. May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flys on love’s wings.”\n\nWhat happened to Pierce Brosnan’s first wife?\n\nBefore he met Keely, Pierce was married to Australian actress Cassandra Harris.\n\nPierce and Cassandra wed in December 1980 and welcomed a son named Sean together in September 1983.\n\nPierce also adopted Cassandra’s two children – Charlotte Emily Brosnan (née Harris) and Christopher Ivan Brosnan (née Harris) – from her previous marriage to the late Dermot Harris.\n\nSadly, on December 28, 1991, Cassandra passed away after a long battle with ovarian cancer.\n\nOver the years, Pierce has been extremely candid about Cassandra’s death and his experience as a widow.\n\n“When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines and the way you view life, all this changes. Because you’re dealing with death. You’re dealing with the possibility of death and dying,” Pierce told Cigar Aficionado in 1997.\n\n“And it was that way through the chemotherapy, through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look. Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children.”\n\nHow many children does Pierce Brosnan and his wife have?\n\nPierce has 5 children.\n\nAs aforementioned, he adopted his first wife Cassandra’s children Charlotte and Chris from a previous marriage. Pierce and Cassandra also welcomed a child of their own, Sean.\n\nSadly, Charlotte passed away in 2013 from ovarian cancer and Chris is estranged from Pierce – he struggles with drug abuse and alcohol addiction and Pierce reportedly cut him off in the early 2000s after failing to get clean.\n\n“Christopher is still very lost. He’s got a rough life, but I know where he is. I can only have strong faith and believe he will recover,” Pierce told Playboy Magazine in 2005.\n\nSean, like his father, is an actor.\n\nAlso, as mentioned above, Pierce shares two kids with his current wife Keely – Dylan and Paris.\n\nDylan is a filmmaker while Paris works as a model, filmmaker and environmental activist.\n\nWhat does Keely Shaye Smith do?\n\nBefore meeting Pierce, Keely worked as a model and actress. She then transitioned into a career in journalism, working on various shows over the years like The Home Show, Unsolved Mysteries, Good Morning America, Today, Entertainment Tonight and Great Bears.\n\nKeely also made her directorial debut with the documentary film Poisoning Paradise in 2016. It highlights the toxic agricultural environment of Kauai."
