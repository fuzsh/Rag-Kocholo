        "text": "Pierce Brosnan's daughter, Charlotte, has died after a three-year battle with ovarian cancer, People reports. Charlotte, who was 41, passed away on June 28 in London.\n\n\"She was surrounded by her husband Alex, her children Isabella and Lucas and her brothers Christopher and Sean,\" Brosnan, 60, said in a statement to the magazine. \"Charlotte fought her cancer with grace and humanity, courage and dignity. Our hearts are heavy with the loss of our beautiful dear girl. We pray for her and that the cure for this wretched disease will be close at hand soon. We thank everyone for their heartfelt condolences.\"\n\nRemember other celebrities we lost this year\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Alex Smith, and their 14-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son. Charlotte lost her mother to the same disease in 1991 when Cassandra Harris, then married to Brosnan, died at the age of 50. Harris also lost her mother to ovarian cancer when she was a teenager.\n\nThe former James Bond actor adopted Charlotte, and her brother, 40-year-old Christopher, after their father, Dermot Harris, died in 1986. He has one son with Harris, 29-year-old Sean, and two children from his second marriage to Keely Shaye Smith: Dylan, 16, and Paris, 12.\n\nBrosnan most recently appeared on the small screen in the A&E mini-series Stephen King's Bag of Bones in 2011.\n\nView original Pierce Brosnan's Daughter Dies From Ovarian Cancer at TVGuide.com\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com"
