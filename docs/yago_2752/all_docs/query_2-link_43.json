        "text": "ACTOR Pierce Brosnan is mourning the death of his adult daughter Charlotte (above), who lost her battle with ovarian cancer on Friday. The 42-year-old's mother, former Bond girl Cassandra Harris, died of the same disease in 1991.\n\nIn a statement released last night, 60-year-old Brosnan said his \"darling daughter Charlotte Emily\" had died surrounded by her husband Alex, children Isabella and Lucas and brothers Christopher and Sean.\n\n\"Charlotte fought her cancer with grace and humanity, courage and dignity,\" Brosnan said. \"Our hearts are heavy with the loss of our beautiful dear girl. We pray for her and that the cure for this wretched disease will be close at hand soon.\"\n\nCharlotte was Brosnan's step-daughter from his first marriage to Cassandra Harris who played a Bond girl in For Your Eyes Only, the Daily Telegraph reports. Brosnan adopted Charlotte and her brother Christopher after their father died in 1986, and Brosnan and Cassandra had another son, Sean.\n\nCassandra died from ovarian cancer in 1991.\n\nRobert Davi, who played a drug lord in License to Kill, wrote on Twitter: \"Just been informed – my friend Pierce Brosnan has lost his daughter to an illness – my prayers and love go out to him and his family\".\n\nStephanie Zimbalist, Brosnan's co-star in TV drama Remington Steele, said on Facebook: \"Sad co-star news to announce. Please join us in sending love, prayers and sympathy to Pierce Brosnan and his family for the death of his daughter Charlotte.\"\n\nBrosnan spoke earlier this year about his new film, Love Is All You Need, in which he plays a widower who falls in love with a hairdresser suffering from cancer, the Mirror reports.\n\nThe 007 actor said he was able to draw on his own traumatic experiences, adding: \"To watch someone you love have their life eaten away – bit by bit, by this insidious and horrid disease – becomes an indelible part of your psyche\"."
