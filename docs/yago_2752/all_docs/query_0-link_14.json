Harris' mother died from the disease as well.\n\nPeople.com was first to report the story. In a statement to People, Brosnan said his daughter \"fought her cancer with grace and humanity, courage and dignity.\" He went on to say \"we pray for her and that the cure for this wretched disease will be close at hand soon.\"\n\nCassandra is survived by a husband, Alex Smith, 14-year-old daughter, Isabella, and 8-year old son, Lucas."
