        "text": "(December 15, 1942–December 28, 1991; birth name: Sandra Colleen Waites): Australian actress and late wife of actor Pierce Brosnan, who portrayed Countess Lisl Von Schlaf, mistress of Milos Columbo (Topol) in For Your Eyes Only. Born in Sydney, Harris made her feature film debut in The Greek Tycoon (1978), working alongside fellow Bond players Luciana Paluzzi and Roland Culver (Thunderball). Harris also appeared in her husband’s celebrated television series Remington Steele (4 episodes, 1982–1985). It was Harris who introduced Brosnan to producer Albert R. Broccoli during the production of For Your Eyes Only.\n\nSadly, after a four-year battle with ovarian cancer, Cassandra Harris died in December 1991, of the same disease that killed her mother and would kill her daughter, Charlotte Brosnan, in 2013 at age forty-one."
