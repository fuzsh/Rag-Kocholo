Why not come in for a bite?\"\n\nCaught In The Act\n\nRetired to a lonely beach house, James Bond discovers that the Austrian Countess' accent is slipping and she is really from Liverpool, but this doesn't discourage 007. The pair put business aside for a champaign nightcap.\n\nThe next morning, 007 finds Lisl on the beach, but the pair have unwelcome company. They are ambushed by henchman Locque and some goons on supercharged beach-buggies. Bond tries gallantly to save his new lover but she is struck down by Locque's vehicle.\n\nMemorable Quotes\n\nLisl: I am the Countess Lisl Von Schlaf.\n\nBond: My name is Bond. I'm writing a novel about Greek smugglers. Know any?\n\nLisl: Smugglers? How would I know any smugglers?\n\nBond: I would think that a lady in your position... would get to know many things. I'd be most grateful.\n\nLisl: Whoops! Me nightie's slipping.\n\nBond: So is your accent, countess. Manchester?\n\nLisl: Close. Liverpool.\n\nBond: It was an amusing performance... between you and the owner of this [Gesturing to the dressing gown he is now wearing].\n\nLisl: I love a grateful man.\n\nBiography\n\nAustralian actress Cassandra Harris was born Sandra Colleen Waites, the daughter of Walter (Wally) Waites, a builder, and Roma, a hairstylist. After her mother divorced and then remarried, Sandra took her stepfather's surname of Gleeson. She studied at Narrabeen High School in Avalon, then worked at a local estate agents before enrolling in Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney. She met and married Bill Firth in 1964, but the pair soon divorced.\n\nHer first acting role was as an air-stewardess in a play called \"Boeing Boeing\" at the Palace Theatre in Sydney. She soon after landed a part in the Australian TV Show \"Beauty and the Beast\" and an early Bruce Beresford film, \"Five Days\". By the late '60s, she left her native Australia to live in London and became known as Cassandra. There she met producer Dermot Harris and had two children with him (Charlotte and Christopher).\n\nShe went on to win several acting roles, including appearances in the TV series \"Space: 1999\" and \"Dick Barton Special Agent\". Her first big screen role came in \"The Greek Tycoon\" in 1978. Her relationship with Dermot Harris ended soon after and she won another acting part, this time in 1980's \"Rough Cut\". Around the same time, she met the would-be Bond actor Pierce Brosnan and the couple married on 27th December 1980. Soon after, the family flew to the location shoot for Cassie's portrayal of Countess Lisl in \"For Your Eyes Only\". She introduced her then pre-Remington Steele husband to Bond producer Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli at a dinner party in 1981 while working on her Bond film.\n\nAfter \"For Your Eyes Only\", Harris landed roles regularly opposite her husband on \"Remington Steele\" which screened between 1982-85, notably the two part episode \"Steele Searching\", in which she plays Felicia.\n\nBrosnan and Harris had a son, Sean, in September 1983 and stayed married until Cassie's death in 1991 after a four-year struggle against ovarian cancer. She passed away on December 28th 1991 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nShare The Story"
