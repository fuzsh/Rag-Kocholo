        "text": "Pierce Brosnan is a five-time father.\n\nThe actor welcomed a son with his late first wife, Cassandra Harris, during their time together, also adopting her two eldest children.\n\nSince he moved on with his second wife, Keely Shaye Smith, sons Dylan and Paris have joined the family.\n\nThe “Mamma Mia!” star clarified in 2017 that his “fatherly instincts are purely [his] own,” as he was raised by grandparents.\n\n“They relate back to no one because there was no one,” he explained to Esquire. “I only met [my dad] the once.”\n\nPage Six is breaking down the members of Brosnan’s big brood below.\n\nCharlotte Emily Brosnan\n\nCharlotte was born in 1971, nine years before her mom married Pierce.\n\nThe Golden Globe nominee adopted her in 1986 following the death of Charlotte’s dad, Dermot Harris, and she took Pierce’s last name.\n\nShe followed in her parents’s footsteps, studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\n\nThe actress married Alex Smith, with whom she had previously welcomed daughter Isabella and son Lucas, in June 2013.\n\nTwo weeks later, Charlotte lost her battle with ovarian cancer — the same disease her mom died of in 1991 — at age 41.\n\n“Charlotte fought her cancer with rare grace and humanity, courage and dignity,” Pierce said in a statement at the time. “Our hearts are heavy with the loss of our beautiful dear girl.”\n\nChristopher Ivan Brosnan\n\nChristopher, born in November 1972, was also adopted by Pierce after his dad’s death.\n\nHe studied screenwriting at UCLA and directing at the New York Film Academy, working as an assistant director on three of Pierce’s movies.\n\nThe “Mrs. Doubtfire” star admitted to Playboy magazine in 2005 that he had “cut off” Christopher due to drug abuse.\n\n“He knows how to get out. He doesn’t want to,” Pierce explained at the time. “I had to say, ‘Go. Get busy living, or get busy dying.’ He has my prayers.”\n\nHowever, he acknowledged his eldest son in the caption of his 2022 Father’s Day tribute via Instagram.\n\nChristopher was captured in rare photographs two years later as he ran errands in London in June 2024.\n\nSean William Brosnan\n\nPierce and Cassandra welcomed son Sean in September 1983.\n\nSean pursued acting after studying at the Central School of Speech and Drama, performing with the British Shakespeare Company and taking on minor roles.\n\nThroughout his career, Sean battled a painkiller addiction that began at age 16 after a car accident broke his back and shattered his tailbone, femur and pelvis.\n\nSean relapsed in 2013 after more than one year of sobriety in the wake of Charlotte’s death, which he admitted was an “excuse” to use in a candid interview on “Inner Space with Dr. Barbara Van Dahlen.”\n\nHe got sober in 2014 and married Sanja Banic, with whom he shares daughter Marley and son Jaxxon.\n\nSean told podcast listeners in 2019 that he has been “working in addiction” but “want[s] to become a clinician and psychologist.”\n\nDylan Thomas Brosnan\n\nFour years before Pierce and Shay Smith tied the knot in 2001, the couple welcomed son Dylan.\n\nHe and his younger brother, Paris, were raised in Hawaii and later went on to divide their time between the island and Malibu, Calif.\n\n“[We were] a bunch of kids running around a forest, looking for something to do, riding bicycles down the street, going to caves and swimming and surfing and stuff,” he told British GQ in September 2022.\n\nDylan graduated from the University of Southern California‘s School of Cinematic Arts in 2020.\n\nBefore becoming a filmmaker, Dylan modeled and released music on Soundcloud under the name Raspberry Blonde.\n\nHe has joined his famous father on multiple red carpets over the years.\n\nParis Beckett Brosnan\n\nPierce’s youngest son was born in February 2001.\n\nParis, who graduated from Loyola Marymount University in 2023, has dabbled in modeling and filmmaking over the years.\n\nHe worked with Pierce on “Black Adam” in 2022, taking on the role of production assistant."
