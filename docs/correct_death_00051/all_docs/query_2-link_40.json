I have seen close to 250 movies of his and am tatally overawed by his performances. Though he was not a star of my time. I have had summer vacations where the evenings were spent purely watching sivaji movie I really was moved to tears on hearing this news!\n\nI have heard some nonsense commenting about sivaji's over acting by people who know less!(especially in the anti-south rediff.com) But the transition from the extremely emotive drama era to the movie era was excellent done by sivaji! Sivaji combined the style of rajini and histrionic talents suprassing Kamal haasan, he just cud do any role with natural fluency! I would not know about Karnan or Veerapandi Kattabomman if not for sivaji. I dont know how they were in their real lives but if they were 0.5 as good as what sivaji potrayed, they should be great people!\n\nMore than anything else I like the way he claps his hand for \"yaaradi ne mohini\" in Uttama puthiran, everything in \"galatta kalyanam\" The manohara, V.kattabomman and parasakthi dialogues!\n\nThe best thing about him was he walked to kashmir in his peak as an actor and did a drama for some jawans fighting there.\n\nIt is a known record that Dilip Kumar remade so much movies of sivaji and got national awards for so much of them and sivaji was overlooked all his life(imagine anu malik has one!). Ironically the dadha saheb phalke award was given to him late in the 90's. FOr a person who was the first Indian to get \"chevalier\". It is a shame that he did not get recognised in his own land.\n\nAs AVM Saravanan put it. \"Sivaji was not free of sins. The biggest sin he committed was being born a tamilian. FOr which he paid dearly in terms of recognition\"\n\n-Bharath\n\nFrom: te (@ 198.73.152.100) on: Mon Jul 23 12:58:04 EDT 2001\n\nThank you sir for everything you have given us.

Satyajit Ray received it in the 80's.\n\nThat being said, Tamilians have lost one of the greatest film actors whose histrionic talents are clearly unmatched.\n\nAs RajaG poited out a raw genius. Somebody's whose artistic fire just went bersek(sometimes a bit overdone) but in most parts stunning to say the least.\n\nAnand\n\nFrom: ramesh (@ ss11.ny.us.ibm.com) on: Mon Jul 23 15:56:26 EDT 2001\n\nHe is the Dictionary of a movie acting.\n\nHe only left away from us,...but that dictionary will give us the meaning of acting for ever..!!!\n\nFrom: bm (@ spider-wg083.proxy.aol.com) on: Mon Jul 23 17:11:44 EDT 2001\n\nI remember reading about the following incident sometime back :\n\n..Cho( Ramaswamy ) once asked Sivaji Ganesan the same question that many of us would have wanted him to ask him..\" why did he overact\" - to which, the late genius took him to a room and demonstrated how he cud have done the same Veerapandia or Karnan or Vietnam veedu etc in a very subtle way and still cud be efffective . When Cho asked him why he didnt do it on screen he is supposed to have said..\"two reasons ..one the directors want it this way and two ..the average villager or a movie goer in those times didnt think it was very good \"acting\" when things were done subtly and they saw the silverscreen as only an extension of the stage where things are done dramatically ( loudly) \".Irrespective of this , we saw a great performance from him Kappalottiya thamizhan and sabash meena etc where he was absolutely world class .. This is a true example of what a thorough professional he was and how he respected the directors even if he felt otherwise about doing a certain thing..\n\nWe are lucky to have lived in his times..may his soul rest in peace.\n\nFrom: Sriram Lakshman (@ a060-0375.snfc.splitrock.net) on: Mon Jul 23 18:22:59 EDT 2001\n\nbm, this incident happened in the sets of 'thangappathakkam'. Even I saw Cho narrating this incident. Infact Sivaji is supposed to have enacted the scene in the same movie where he cries over his wife's dead body in a more subtle way. This unfortunate trend of overdoing in his movies was incorporated first by Bhimsingh and all Sivaji's fans came to the theatres expecting it to happen. Probably the reason why his experimental movies like 'Motor Sundaram piLLai' never really clicked (atleast I think so:).\n\nunnai cholli kutramillai\n\nennai cholli kutramillai\n\nkAlam seitha kOlamadi kadavuL seitha kutramadi....\n\nAlas!!!

May his soul rest in peace.\n\nFrom: ravi k.s. ravichandran (@ pub-dial62.aclis.utah.edu) on: Mon Jul 23 22:39:32 EDT 2001\n\nPeople used to say he over-acted. Even now, watching after several years later, it does not appear to me that way..because most of other actors/actresses in the scenes were really \"static\" and were conscious of the camera..while Shivaji Ganesen was \"dynamic\" and immersed in his performance. If you watch carefully you can never sense the \"camera awareness\" in his face during the scences. I noticed this in many of his movies. Relatively, his genuine performance would appear as over-acting. It seems to me rather as under-acting by other stars that contrasted his performance.\n\nFrom: aruvi (@ nas-60-191.ottawa.navipath.net) on: Mon Jul 23 23:14:05 EDT 2001\n\nSharing in the sadness...:-(\n\nFrom: e.hari (@ adsl-138-89-109-112.nnj.adsl.bellatlantic.net) on: Mon Jul 23 23:41:07 EDT 2001\n\nbm,\n\nThat is true. Overacting is the price he paid for his stardom. His acting style, which pulled the fans to his movies. If you watch his 50's and 60's, lot of movies he has given very subtle performance ( andha nall, uyarndha manidha, deiva magan). Devar magan was a classic acting. He had a great screen presence. As bharthiraja said, it is enough for me, even if he stood before the camera silenty.\n\nHis dedication, sincerty is still unmatched in the industry. I can not imagine, how frustrating it was, for this man to sit quitely at home, away from the lime light for a decade or so.\n\nI think people are drumming up too much on his overacting side. It needs special skills to do that. He can beat any other actor in their own game, but no can beat him in his own game.\n\ne.hari\n\nFrom: rf (@ pppa88-resalerockford1-3r7238.dialinx.net) on: Tue Jul 24 00:39:49 EDT 2001\n\none thing about the nadigar thilagam was his remarkably pleasant face and that constant twinkle in his eyes. something very special. a lot of the older generation like Asokan, Muthuraman, Jaisanker, Nambiar, MGR, Sivaji just had that extra geniality about him...\n\nFrom: kamalakannan (@ 202.9.162.151) on: Tue Jul 24 02:00:46 EDT 2001\n\noh really\n\ni still cant believe that the great aalamaram has fallen\n\nhe added new dimension to tfm by giving exact lip sync for all the songs with great expression and feelin besides his unmatched acting and dialogue delivery hats off\n\nwe could find tms and spb on his funeral\n\nhowever harish raghavendra was the only one from the present generation to be found there in spite of not having sung for shivaji.\n\nFrom: kavitha (@ 210-55-124-190.dialup.xtra.co.nz) on: Tue Jul 24 05:21:23 EDT 2001\n\nMay his soul rest in peace\n\nFrom: joney (@ 202.9.160.74) on: Tue Jul 24 11:08:19 EDT 2001\n\nImayangal saivathilai\n\nMay his soul rest in peace\n\nFrom: kiru (@ surf0004.sybase.com) on: Tue Jul 24 11:41:05 EDT 2001\n\nI have not been visiting this site for a while..but I wanted to come here and share with others the sadness that has come upon us with the passing away of a legend, an icon of tamil..nah the whole Indian filmdom..the great actor Sivaji Ganesan..\n\nPeople are mentioning overacting..but I remember mainly the movie posters that I used to see while walking to school..the image of sivaji in white robes, glasses and bible in hand in veLLai rOja is still vivid in memory..he was alive even in a still (I have never seen that movie FYI)..while others act ..sivAji becomes the character..You are not dead sivAji..you are alive in our memories..those celluloid rolls we will keep going back to when the memory gets vague..\n\n(Sriram Lakshman..quoting an appropriate kavignar's song really moved me and made me post this)\n\nFrom: Dorai (@ 12.144.36.2) on: Tue Jul 24 12:27:46 EDT 2001\n\nI would also add Mudhal Mariyathai to the list of movies where he showed how he can still be very effective acting in a subtler manner, especially the Poogartru Thirumbuma.. and the climax scene showing his emotions only without any words before he dies.\n\nList all pages of this thread\n\nPost comments"
