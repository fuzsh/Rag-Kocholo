        "text": "Needhi is a colour production from Sujatha Cine Arts, the production company of (The Late) actor K.Balaji. The films stars Sivaji Ganesan, Jayalalitha, Sowcar Janaki, Manorama, R.S.Manohar, M.R.R.Vasu, Major Sunderrajan, J.P. Chandhrababu and K.Balaji.\n\nRaja (Sivaji Ganesan) is a loner on the wrong side of morality. He is a truck driver and, because of his love for liquor, thinks nothing of driving his truck when seriously under the influence of liquor.\n\nOn one such trip he runs over a peasant, killing him in the process. In the trial that follows it is revealed that the man killed was the sole bread-winner of his family. To add some melodramatic effect, he also has a crippled father and a blind mother, as well as a wife and three children – all of whom face starvation following his death.\n\nRaja’s sentence for the crime is to serve one year as the servant of the bereaved family. Naturally, they all loathe and detest him and Raja is faced with the biggest challenge of his life and also learns something about himself in the process.\n\nNot exactly and unpredictable story, but undoubtedly a beautiful cinematic experience. The situation might well have been overdone, but it remains a moving story.\n\nA.L.Naaraayanan’s scripting is commendable and plays a major role in the film having achieved evergreen status. I am not ashamed to admit that there were scenes during which I teared.\n\nM.S.Visvanathan’s music is another plus point for the film and includes the immortal hit Naallai mudhal kudika maaten.\n\nMade in 1972, this early film of director C.V.Rajendran shows a keen understanding of cinematic tastes of the time and what makes a good commercial film. Despite some clichés and some corny routines, Needhi is still as relevant today as it was when it was first released.\n\nNeedhi scores 7 points out of 10.\n\nOnce a drunk, always a drunk : How true is that? That is the central issue handled by the blockbuster movie, Vasantha Maaligai, which starred Sivaji Ganesan, Vanishree, K.Balaji, Nagesh, Major Sunderrajan, V.S.Raagavan, Pandaribhai, Shrikanth, Senthaamarai and Sri Devi who was only a child star at the time.\n\nSivaji Ganesan plays a wealthy but hopeless drunk whose life revolves around alcohol. Virtual addiction is tested against the power of a woman in the form of Vanishree, but the metamorphosis is not a simple process – especially when the two begin to fall in love ; a relationship that seemed to be doomed almost once it had started.\n\nWill reason triumph over the bottle? Can Love really conquer all? The answers to these questions make up the rest of the story of Vasantha Maaligai.\n\nAs can be expected, Sivaji Ganesan puts in an unforgettable performance, closely followed by Vansihree. K.Balaji leaves an indelible mark on the film while Nagesh is responsible fr some good comedy. There are also memorable performances from Major Sunderrajan, V.S. Raagavan, Pandaribhai and Shrikanth. Child star Sridevi also makes a lasting impression.\n\nVasantha Maaligai features the music of K.V.Mahadevan and the lyrics of Kannadassan and his nephew, Panju Arunachallam. The songs have since become immortal hits and includes such memorable tracks as Mayakkamenna, Yaarukaage and Irandu Manam Vehndum.\n\nThe moving story has been penned by Kousalya Devi while scripting is handled by Balamurugan. The clashes between Vanishree and Sivaji Ganesan are realistically handled.\n\nVijaya and Suresh Combines’ Vasantha Maaligai is an entertaining movie with a moral message and is sure to be enjoyed by all.\n\nVasantha Maaligai scores 7 points out 10.\n\nTalk to anyone about the golden era of Tamil films and one title that is sure to come up is Paar Magalle Paar, the super hit film directed by one of the top directors of the time, A.Bheemsingh.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of Sivaji Ganesan’s most outstanding performances and one of the most memorable protagonists of all of Bheemsingh’s films.\n\nSivaji Ganesan plays the role of Zamindar Sivalingam, a wealthy businessman, incredibly bigoted, stubborn, domineering and altogether quite an obnoxious person.\n\nWhile he is away on business, his wife Lakshmi gives birth to a baby girl but when he rushes back, eager, excited and delighted, there are two babies in the cradle and he is told that Lakshmi had given birth to twins – both girls.\n\nFor how long can any wife keep a secret such as this from her husband? When the secret is revealed, all hell breaks loose = but this is only the beginning of the problems.\n\nSivaji Ganesan’s performance in this film is outstanding and must surely rate as one of the best of his career. Sowcar Janaki plays the hapless wife who has to contend with the tantrums and vicious temper of her unreasonable husband.\n\nM.R.Radha (father of Radharavi and Radhika) plays a most unusual role in this film and displays once again that he was a very classy actor decades ahead of his time.\n\nVijayakumarie, Pushpalatha and R.Muthuraman also put on impressive performances.\n\nPaar Magalle Paar was also the very first film of comedian Cho (now an insightful political and social analyst). His is a very impressive debut performance.\n\nAlso appearing in major roles in Paar Magalle Paar are V.K.Ramasamy, Manorama and comedian Karunanidhi.\n\nMusic by Mellisai Mannargall Visvanathan-Ramamoorthy is on par with excellence of the rest of the film, with every song a melodious hit. My favourites are the title song and Avall Parrandha Ponaalle.\n\nScripting by Aaroor Dhaas makes it a film that one can watch over and over.\n\nPaar Magalle Paar was a major milestone in Director Bheemsingh’s career and it is easy to see why.\n\nPaar Magalla Paar scores 8 points out of 10.\n\nI have, on numerous occasions, sung the praises of veteran director Shridhar. I have always believed that Shridhar was much too advanced for his time and this film, OOTY VARAI URAVU has only served to strengthen that view. Having cast Nadigar Thilagam Sivaji Ganesan and Punnagai Arasi K.R.Vijaya in the lead roles, one would expect Shridhar to weave a powerful emotion-packed drama and the initial scenes of the film lead one to expect just that. Then Shridhar displays his unquestionable artistic talent in gradually changing the focus from drama to comedy, while not ignoring the seriousness of the plot.\n\nCo-starring with Sivaji Ganesan and K.R.Vijaya in OOTYVARAI URAVU are T.S.Baalaiah, R.Muthuraman, C.K.Naagesh, V.K.Ramasamy, L.Vijayalakshmi, Sachu, Sundhariebhai and Senthaamarai.\n\nRavi – played by Sivaji Ganesan – is a hardworking youngster whose business skills and dedication to duty has seen him take over the family business started by his father, Vedhaachallam – played by T.S.Balaiah. On a trip out of town, Ravi comes across a young girl who was a victim of a hit-and-run accident. After admitting her to hospital, Ravi resumes his journey. On the train, he glances through a newspaper and comes across a Missing Persons notice. Thinking nothing of this, he settles down to enjoy the journey when he, for the first time, notices that the other passenger in the compartment was the same person the person reported missing.\n\nOn questioning her, the girl – played by K.R.Vijaya – refuses to say anything about her reasons for running away but begs Ravi not to reveal to anyone that he had seen her. Later in that journey, the girl’s luggage falls from the luggage compartment and when Ravi leans over to pick it up, he is stunned to see a photograph of his father, with another woman. Letters accompanying the photograph reveal that Vijaya is the result of an extra-marital affair by Ravi’s father. When Ravi gets over the initial shock, he decides to handle the matter in a rather surprising manner but – as would soon be revealed – the events are much more complicated than they initially appear to be. To find out what happens next, watch Shridhar’s magnificent family entertainer, OOTY VARAI URAVU.\n\nThis is one of the most entertaining of Shridhar’s films I have seen thus far. The plot is filled with twists, some dramatic – others comic and, carrying the events through, are very realistic, believable characters. Sivaji Ganesan is once again in riveting form in yet another complex character.\n\nProviding superb support and a healthy dose of glamour is a very youthful K.R.Vijaya. T.S.Balaiyah is in a delightful role but I could not help but think how the role would have been had it been portrayed by Nadigavel M.R.Radha. R.Muthuraman is in an unusual role while V.K.Ramasamy does full justic to his role. Naagesh and Sachu provide some great fun. L.Vijayalakshmi is also impressive. The best of the others are Senthaamarai and Sundhariebhai.\n\nMusic in OOTIVARAI URAVU has been scored by Mellisai Mannan M.S.Visvanathan and this is an unforgettable performance from him. Every one of the film’s six songs is a memorable hit from the beaty Thedinen Vandhadhu to the jolly Pudhu naadagathil oruy naayagi to the soulful Poo maalaiyil ohr malligai to the melodious Happy indru mudhal Happy – Every song was a melodious hit and has now graduated to evergreen status. The songs were all penned by Kaviyarasu kannadassan. Dance choreography by Pasumarthi Krishnamoorthy shows lots of experimentation but the end result is not quite pleasing. M.S.Visvanathan’s background score is very good.\n\nArt director Ganga does well but has not broken out of the stylised mode. Cinematographer N.Balakrishnan has made maximum use of the colour format, especially in the film’s many beautiful outdoor locations. Balakrsihnan’s efforts are most commendable in the film’s six songs. His indoor scenes are less impressive.\n\nProduced by Kovai Sezhiyan for K.C.Films, OOTIVARAI URAVU is entertainment at its very best and a film you will want to see over and over. This is a film that no video collection should be without and a film which showcases the immense talent of Director Shridhar.\n\nOOTIVARAI URAVU scores 9 points out of 10.\n\nMaster director A.C.Thirulogachander, who delighted cinema audiences with hit films like ANBE VAA, ATHEY KANGALL and BABU was the first director to bring together on screen Nadigar Thilagam Sivaji Ganesan and Makkall Kalainyar Jaishanker. Titled ANBALIPPU, this film also stars B.Saroja Devi, M.N.Nambiar, Nagesh, Pandaribhai, V.K.Ramasamy and Senthaamarai.\n\nSivaji Ganesan plays the rural youngster Velu – well liked and greatly respected, despite being a poor, lowly labourer. He, however, owns his own piece of land and he works hard to earn a living off this land. His childhood friend was Raja – played by Makkall Kalainyar Jaishanker. Contrary to what Velu initially expects, everyone leads him to believe that Raja, having been educated overseas, will no longer see Velu as his friend. When Raja does return to the village, he proves everyone wrong and it seems that the Golden period has commenced for Velu.\n\nRaja, however, has devised a complex plan to transform his little village first to a major town and then a city by building a mill and then following this with other related industries. This is where things begin to go wrong for the friends. Velu is a passionate farmer who regards the soil as his mother and father. One can imagine his reaction then when Raja tells him that he requires Raja’s land to build the mill. Velu finds it difficult to accept that good arable land should be wasted on industry at a time when India should have been looking to increase food production. Raja takes this refusal personally and the two friends now find themselves adversaries.\n\nEvents take a turn for the worse when the new arrival in the village, Vasudevan – played by M.N.Nambiar – decides to frame Velu for a crime he did not commit. Circumstances then threaten to destroy what was left of the friendship forever – or can matters still be rectified? If so, how? To find out, watch A.C.Thirulogachander’s classic movie, ANBALIPPU.\n\nANBALIPPU has some unforgettable acting performances. Sivaji Ganesan is simply fabulous in a kind of performance he seems to reserve for A.C.Thirulogachander. His portrayal of the principled youngster Velu underscores his immense talent and why he was then known as the undisputed Acting Hero as opposed to MGR who was seen as the Action hero. Jaishanker is in one of his best performances in a role that seems to bask in the golden light of Nadigar Thilagam. B.Saroja Devi is in a memorable role. Naagesh and V.K.Ramasamy provide the comedy track albeit at the expense of the main story. M.N.Nambiar plays his role with the usual venom while Pandaribhai and Senthaamarai are the best of the others.\n\nMusic in ANBALIPPU has been scored by Mellisai Mannar M.S.Visvanathan who has done a commendable job with the film’s background score. Visvanathan’s performance with the soundtrack is less impressive. None of the songs are very memorable. All the songs have been penned by Kaviyarasu Kannadassan. Dance choreographer A.K.Chopra does a good job with the film’s dances. Art director A.Balu does nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nStunt directors A.Vengetesan and Saminathan are very impressive especially in the fight sequence in the fire. Cinematographer Thambu handles his portfolio adequately.\n\nProduced by J.Gandhiraj, ANBALIPPU has story and direction by A.C.Thirulogachander and scripting by Aaroor Dhaas. Dhaas handles the dramatic scenes exceptionally well and much of the film’s dramatic highpoints can be attributed to Dhaas’s scriptwriting skills. The movie is a fabulous classic with a credible story and believable acting.\n\nANBALIPPU scores 8 points out of 10."
