        "text": "Finally, actor Shivaji Dev, grandson of thespian Sivaji Ganesan and son of producer Ramkumar, has come out in the open about his relationship with actress Suja Varunee, who hit the limelight with ‘Bigg Boss.’ Suja has been in the industry for a long doing special numbers but resolved to choose films with substance and proved in movies like Kuttram 23, Kidaari and Iravukku Aayiram Kangal.\n\nRumors of her relationship with Shivaji were rife and reports suggested that the duo got engaged after they were spotted at Tirupati Tirumala Temple. While not refuting the rumours, Suja would have had us believe that she was denying it. She said they were friends and asked people not to spread rumours about her “false” engagement and that she would definitely inform all if there is are official updates about her personal life.\n\nShivaji Dev, who has worked in movies like Singakutty, Pudhumugangal Thevai and Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum, took to his social media handle to put an end to the whispers. He wrote, “To all Sujavarunee fans and my media friends, it’s my responsibility to clarify a few things to see that none of your rumours hurt or affect other people’s lives. I have been in relationship with this gem of a person for more than 11 years now.”\n\nHe went on to say, “My birth name is Shiva Kumar” and that has changed to his original name from screen name. “As my mother passed away 2 years back I changed my screen name from Shivaji Dev to “Shiva Kumar” my birth name with her blessings, and I will continue my journey onscreen with this name! I’m the “Athaan” who she spoke about in ‘Big Boss’ I’m the only partner there is! Soon I will let you all know official news regarding our marriage! Until then we ask u to please maintain respect on this issue.”"
