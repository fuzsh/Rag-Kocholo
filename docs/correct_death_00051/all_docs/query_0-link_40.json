However, after his demise, my older brothers took his position. I wouldn’t call their way of showing their love negative, but it has pricked me so many times. I was suppressed, lost my confidence, maintained poor mental stability and looked fearful.\n\nSlowly, during my 20s, I started building my conviction myself. It was slow, but I ensured the foundation was strong so that none could break it.\n\nI made my first business, a boutique in Anna Nagar, when I was 23. In the era when I was receiving an overwhelming response, I got married to one of the most celebrated, renowned families in the Indian film industry in 2011. I’ve two sons now.\n\nDuring my son’s 6th birthday, we visited a school where a girl refused the donated food and instead asked for a sanitary pad. This shook me hard. \n\nWe are all dealing with so many other exterior problems wherein some young kids still are suffering to get their basic needs. That was the moment I decided to research sanitary pads.\n\nI discovered that pads are not organic and it’s a marketing gimmick. Not just that, there are a lot of other points which disturbed my harmony.\n\nI came up with ‘Honest Pads’, an 8-hour pad. I can honestly tell you what’s inside my pad and why it is so safe to use. There’s a Bamboo Charcoal placed in the center of the pad to absorb all the moisture, keep the area dry and remove odor. The sheet used in the pad can absorb around 150 ml of blood and the top layer consists of pure cotton.\n\nApart from manufacturing pads, I always educate children and adults on the right method of disposing of those pads. \n\nWhen I heard about financially dependent women, I initiated ‘Project Shakthi’, which helps women be empowered and create awareness in making self-money. \n\n(...
