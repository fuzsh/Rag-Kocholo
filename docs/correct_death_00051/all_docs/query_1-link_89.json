        "text": "Kamal Haasan has an astonishing command over the Malayalam language rather than any non-Tamil language. Indeed, he conversed with the media in Malayalam during the Indian 2 promotions in Kochi. It was at this event that the pan-India actor declared that he carries a “Made in Kerala” tag with his name, underscoring his connection with Kerala and Malayalam cinema.\n\nInterestingly, in a very recent development, the superstar has been given honourary membership in the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA). This move by the Kerala actor’s body emphasises his connection with the Malayalam industry, which has been an integral part of his film career.\n\nAlso Read: Indian 2 Tamil movie review\n\nKamal Haasan & Malayalam cinema\n\nKamal Haasan made headlines when he appreciated three recent Malayalam releases. These include Manjummel Boys, which ran successfully in all South Indian states and ended up being an all-time blockbuster by grossing over ₹200 crore globally.\n\nAfter watching the flick, the veteran actor interacted with the cast and crew of Manjummel Boys at his Chennai office. The film pays rich tribute to Kamal’s 1991 flick Guna and the popular “Kanmani Anbodu” song from the cult movie.\n\nKamal also watched director Blessy’s Aadujeevitham (The Goat Life), featuring Prithviraj Sukumaran and Amala Paul in the lead roles. The veteran actor was all praise for its technical aspects. He also showered praises on Prithviraj stating that he didn’t expect the actor to go nude in a pivotal scene.\n\nIn May, Kamal Haasan watched Thalavan, headlined by Asif Ali and Biju Menon and directed by Jis Joy. Impressed with the investigative thriller, he invited team Thalavan to Chennai and lauded their efforts.\n\nDespite his packed schedule (with films and politics), Kamal Haasan took some time out to watch these movies, which underlined his love for Malayalam cinema.\n\nNeedless to say, he is a superstar in Tamil cinema. However, Kamal always maintained a strong connection with Malayalam cinema. This became evident, time and again, from his previous statements about Malayalam films.\n\nDuring the Vishwaroopam promotions in 2013, Kamal Haasan announced that he has a special affinity for Malayalam cinema and learned a lot from his colleagues in the industry. He also praised the work of Malayalam filmmakers and actors while describing them as the “most talented technicians in the country”.\n\nHe revealed that he enjoys the laid-back and relaxed working atmosphere in the Malayalam industry when compared to its Tamil counterpart. Kamal also appreciated the emphasis on storytelling and character development in Malayalam films, which he felt was lacking in some Tamil movies.\n\nFurther, the actor urged the filmmakers in Kerala to keep the flag flying high since the whole country was watching the marvellous films being made in Malayalam.\n\nIn another instance, during a round table discussion hosted by Film Companion, Kamal Haasan dwelt at length about the dark phase in Malayalam cinema. He observed that the Malayalam film industry tried to compete with the Tamil and Telugu industries and lost its grain and the OG thing. He also blamed the OTT and censors for the dark phase.\n\nThe Indian (1996) actor recollected how impressed he was with the release of Nirmalyam (1973), directed by MT Vasudevan Nair. He said he saw it several times and went back to the theatre because it taught him cinema.\n\nDuring the promotions of Kalki 2989 AD in San Diego, Kamal said, “If it’s a complicated technical issue, we might have to take a break for logistical reasons. I come from Malayalam cinema, a small industry where it’s one long-distance run. We finish the shooting in three weeks and hence, everyone gears up for that. It sometimes exceeds 12 hours of work in a day. I come from that school. We have larger lungs, we run for longer distances.”\n\nHe was quite active in the Malayalam industry from 1972 to 1978 when he acted in around 20 movies (more than the Tamil movies he did during that period). Well, this dedication won him fans among Malayalam filmmakers too.\n\nSadly, his career in Malayalam cinema seems to have been the least documented or least discussed.\n\nRelated: I’m ‘Made in Kerala’: Kamal Haasan at ‘Indian 2’ promotions\n\nHis oeuvre in Mollywood\n\nKamal Haasan has done over 35 films in Malayalam in his illustrious career. Ks Sethumadhavan’s Kanyakumari (1974) marked his debut as a lead actor and Rita Bhaduri’s debut in cinema. The duo won laurels for their natural style of acting.\n\nThe movie also marked the debut of veteran Malayalam actor Jagathy Sreekumar.\n\nKanyakumari was a box-office hit and was shot entirely in Kanyakumari and its surroundings. Kamal received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance.\n\nWayanadan Thampan (1978), directed by P Chengazu Sivan, starred Kamal Haasan, Sridevi, and Kuthiravattam Pappu in the main roles. The Malayalam film is a folk tale dealing with a lower-caste priest named Thampan (Kamal Haasan). He is believed to have supernatural powers.\n\nThe story revolves around Thampan’s life, his struggles, and his spiritual journey. Wayanadan Thampan is considered one of the best in Kamal Haasan’s career in Malayalam cinema.\n\nTK Rajeev Kumar’s Chanakyan (1989) featured Kamal, Urmila Matondkar, Jayaram, and Thilakan in the lead roles. Jayaram and Kamal Haasan’s close association started here.\n\nIn the movie, Johnson (Kamal) plots to assassinate the corrupt chief minister Madhava Menon. He takes the help of a mimicry artist (Jayaram) to seek his revenge.\n\nChanakyan was critically acclaimed and became a commercial success, though it was ahead of its time.\n\nMadanolsavam (1987) is a romantic drama headlined by Kamal Haasan and Zarina Wahab. The film was dubbed into Tamil as Paruva Mazhai (1978) and Hindi as Dil Ka Sathi Dil (1982).\n\nIt is an unofficial remake of the English movie Love Story (1970). Kamal’s performance in the movie was well-appreciated and the song “Mada Prave Vaa” topped the chartbusters for several years.\n\nSoorarai Pottru vs Sarfira: Akshay’s flamboyance breathes new life into an effective remake\n\nFriends in Malayalam industry\n\nKamal Haasan has many friends in Malayalam cinema and these friendships demonstrate his strong connection with the industry.\n\nHe and the late Malayalam director IV Sasi were good friends. He was also friends with actress Seema, the wife of IV Sasi.\n\nKamal and IV Sasi collaborated on several films, including Ashirvadam (1977), Eeta (1978), and Vritham (1987), to mention a few. He also made a guest appearance in Sasi’s revolutionary film Avalude Raavukal (1978).\n\nThe actor always praised Sasi’s direction and innovative storytelling. The two shared a deep respect and admiration for each other’s work. They maintained a long-lasting friendship while supporting each other through the ups and downs of their careers.\n\nKamal and Seema acted together in several films. The veteran actress spoke highly of his dedication to his craft and his passion for cinema.\n\nKamal Haasan teamed up with the late Malayalam filmmaker Bharathan for Thevar Magan (1992), a superhit rural action drama. The movie also marked the first time a screenplay writing software was used in Tamil cinema.\n\nThe actor credited Bharathan for the overwhelming success of Thevar Magan. A painter, poet, and director, Bharathan brought a unique perspective to his oeuvre.\n\nDuring the Indian 2 promotions in Kochi, Kamal Haasan mentioned his love and respect for the late Malayalam actor Nedumudi Venu, who acted in Indian and Indian 2. He reiterated that Nedumudi Venu is his favourite Malayalam actor.\n\nHe fondly remembered Nedumudi Venu as one of the finest actors in Malayalam cinema and praised his ability to take on both lead and character roles.\n\nKamal recounted that Venu shared his health concerns during the shooting of Indian 2. He also emotionally recalled their conversations about celebrating the film’s (Indian 2) release together. But it didn’t happen due to Nedumudi Venu’s passing.\n\nMalayalam actor Jayaram, too, is a close friend of Kamal Haasan.\n\nKalki 2898 AD: Kamal Haasan, a hero and villain for the ages\n\nMalayalees await Kamal’s comeback\n\nDespite his strong association with Malayalam cinema, Kamal Haasan hasn’t done any Malayalam films for a long time. He last appeared in a cameo role in Four Friends (2010), directed by Saji Surendran.\n\nMovie buffs in Kerala strongly feel it’s high time that the actor made a comeback in Malayalam. During the Indian 2 promotions, when the media asked him why he wasn’t doing Malayalam films, the actor replied that the negotiations were going on with producers.\n\nThough Kamal made the statement on a lighter note, his response raised anticipation among the audience for his next Malayalam film.\n\n“I became Kamal Haasan’s fan after watching his films like Guna, Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989), and Michael Madana Kama Rajan (1990) on television. When I started watching his serious films, my mother used to talk about his previous works, which added to my fascination. When I realised he worked in Malayalam, too, I was curious,” Sajin Srijith, a film critic, told South First.\n\n“Chanakyan is the first Malayalam movie of Kamal Haasan I watched. It influenced me as a film buff and remains one of my favourite films. My admiration for Kamal grew more after discovering his strong command over Malayalam. I find this quality quite impressive because I don’t think any other South Indian actor is so well-versed in other Indian languages. The efforts he took in this regard are second to none. I wish Kamal Haasan did more Malayalam films now,” Sajin added.\n\nRenjith VP, a Bangalore-based Malayalee film enthusiast, observes that Kamal Haasan did impressive work in Malayalam.\n\n“I remember watching Kamal Haasan’s Kanyakumari, Wayanadan Thampan, and Chanakyan in my childhood days. Of these, Wayanadan Thampan was a genre-breaking movie as it had unique horror elements. I would say Chanakyan is the best revenge film made in Malayalam ever. The techniques and equipment used in the film make it unique,” Renjith told South First.\n\nRenjith recollected an old Malayalam interview, where Kamal stated that the Malayalam industry couldn’t afford him then. Nevertheless, the film lover believes Malayalam cinema can now afford Kamal Haasan and hopes to see the veteran actor in a Malayalam film soon.\n\nManesh Madhavan, an award-winning cinematographer in the Malayalam industry, told South First that though he watched most of Kamal Haasan’s Malayalam films, he likes Pushpaka Vimana (1987). “The silent movie boasts impressive technical aspects and brilliant performances,” he quipped, adding that he also likes Chanakyan.\n\nWell, the thriller won critical acclaim and minted money at the box office. It enjoys a separate fan base even today.\n\nFor now, the Malayali audience awaits the release of Kamal Haasan’s Indian 3, the third instalment in the Indian franchise under the direction of Shankar.\n\n(Edited by Y Krishna Jyothi)\n\n(South First is now on WhatsApp and Telegram)"
