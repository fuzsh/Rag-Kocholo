        "text": "When Sivaji Ganesan passed away, the All India Radio presented the obituary message saying, “We wish it were not true, just another one of his acts.”\n\nChinnaiya Manrayar, who was a native of Soorakottai village of Thanjavur District, had migrated to Villupuram on account of his business. On August 1, 1927, he was imprisoned due to his involvement in the freedom struggle and on the very same day his son Ganesan was also born as the fourth child of the family.\n\nDue to his interest in dramatics, Ganesan joined Yathartham Ponnusamy’s troop Bala Gaana Sabha. He was a ten-year-old boy then.\n\nWhen he acted the role of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, he won the admiration of Periyar who named him as Sivaji Ganesan.\n\nThe trial scene in his debut film Parasakthi made him famous. In the movie Navarathri, he did nine distinct roles.\n\nIt was he who brought the Gods and the freedom fighters right in front of our eyes.\n\nToday is the death anniversary of this great legend. Though he has left the mortal world, he will remain immortal in the hearts of people."
