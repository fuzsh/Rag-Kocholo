        "text": "Who am I? Iâ€™m Shivaji Dev, hailing from the family of Tamil film historyâ€™s greatest actor and one of the best actors of world cinema. I am Sivaji Ganesanâ€™s grandson & son of G.Ramkumar & Meenakshi Ramkumar, nephew of yester year actress Sripriya.\n\nI have my true & individual passion for films. Iâ€™m the wackiest person in my family and have lots of pressure to overcome with and have loads of patience to beat it. The time & skies are surrounding me & Iâ€™m confident that I can sense my success for my honest work. Iâ€™m a hungry actor who will be always in all ways & I love my work .Even my most dear ones my family & friends comes laterâ€¦\n\nWhat is your antidote when Motivation and Focus Dwindle?\n\nWhen my focus & motivation dwindle, I just look back at my growth and realize that I have not been idle, but I at least have given it a try. My biggest antidote is Walt Disney & his quotes ðŸ™‚\n\nHow do you respond to someone who has hurt you?\n\nI have learned to control my anger in recent times & just ignore that particular time when someone hurts me with silence. By the time they feel guilty & hesitate to talk to me and when they see me later, I go to them & say hi!!!!!\n\nAccording to you, what is true happiness ?\n\nAccording to me my true happiness is when my dream comes true & I live happily forever with my family & friends. That is more than enough for me ðŸ™‚\n\nWhat are your biggest fears in life?\n\nMy biggest fear is heights!!! Iâ€™m a total acrophobia!! but i donâ€™t like to have the word fear in my life, so starting to come through it!!\n\nWhat is real beauty according to you?\n\nI see real beauty in children & new born babies :).They are the true creation of nature.Their beauty has no words to explain!!!\n\nWhat is your favorite quote and why?\n\nI have a lot of favorite quotes because thatâ€™s what keeps me going strong. In particular the below two are my most favorite.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript."
