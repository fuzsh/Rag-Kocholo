        "text": "Actor Pradeep K Vijayan was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his house in Palavakkam on June 13, 2024, police said. The 39-year-old actor was best known for his roles in films like Thegidi, Meyaadha Maan, Teddy (2021), Irumbu Thirai (2018) and Rudhran (2023).\n\nHe was a bachelor and lived alone at his house in Sankarapuram, Palavakkam, police said. He had repeatedly complained of frequent bouts of dizziness followed by breathlessness and had sought treatment for the same.\n\nAccording to police, his friend had tried to call him at 9.30 AM on Wednesday (June 12), but he did not respond. Subsequently, some of his friends repeatedly called him, but the calls remained unanswered. One of them became suspicious and decided to knock on his door. The door was locked from inside.\n\nHe then alerted the Neelangarai police and a police sub-inspector reached the spot. With the help of the fire and rescue services, the door was broken open and Mr Vijayan was found dead in the bathroom. He had injuries on his head and face, police said.\n\nThe police found his body and sent it to the Government Hospital in Royapettah for postmortem. The Neelankarai police registered a case of unnatural death and continued investigation, which revealed that it was an accidental fall.\n\nVijayan was an employee of the Golden Rock Railway Workshop in Tiruchirappalli. His first role as a leading actor was that of Paadhai Theriyudhu Paar in 1960. At the end of that decade, he began directing, mostly in collaboration with producer K. Balaji of Sujatha Cine Arts. During the 1970s and up to the mid-1980s, he directed many of Sivaji Ganesanâ€™s films, including Kaaval Dheivam, Punniya Boomi and the 1979 blockbuster Thirisoolam.\n\nHis other notable films include Vidhi, Sattam, Viduthalai, a remake of Qurbani and Vandichakkaram. He died in 1988 during the shooting of En Rathathin Rathame, which was finally completed by his son Sundar K Vijayan. His assistants included Samuthirakani and KS Adhiyaman."
