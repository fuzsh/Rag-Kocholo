        "text": "Gemini Ganesan (born November 17, 1920, Pudukkottai princely state, British India [now Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu, India]—died March 22, 2005, Chennai, Tamil Nadu) was an Indian actor, one of the stalwarts of Tamil cinema, who acted in a variety of roles but is especially noted as a romantic lead, which earned him the title of Kadhal Mannan (“King of Romance”) among his fans. Together with his contemporaries Sivaji Ganesan and M.G. Ramachandran (known as “MGR”), Gemini Ganesan was one of the three best-known actors of 20th-century Tamil cinema.\n\nGanesan received a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and worked for a while as a teacher at his alma mater, the Madras Christian College, Tambaram, before taking a job as a casting assistant at Gemini Studios. It was this association that gave him the nickname Gemini. Ganesan’s first foray into the world of films was as an assistant to the director (and briefly as an actor) in the movie Miss Malini (1947). Initially unnoticed, Ganesan was recognized after his performance as a villain in Thai ullam (1952; “Mother’s Heart”).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nThe year 1953 was one of the turning points in Ganesan’s life, as his film Manampol mangalyam (“Ideal Husband and Wife”) was a huge hit. He remained highly popular through the 1970s, acquiring a reputation as a romantic hero. Perhaps his best performance was in Naan avanillai (1974; “I Am Not He”), his own production, in which, as a seducer of women, he played many roles. Although this film was not a commercial success, it won him high critical acclaim. His last significant screen appearance was in Avvai shanmugi (1996), a Tamil remake of the American film Mrs. Doubtfire, in which he played the romantic rival."
