        "text": "\" All the hullaballoo about 14-hr. workday! \" A big ruckus has broken out in Bengaluru, India (aka Silicon Valley of India) as the state government bending to all powerful tech companies has proposed an amendment to the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, aiming to increase the working hours of IT employees to 14 hours a day. The 70-hour work week was originally proposed some months ago by the founder of Infosys, Narayana Murthy. He stated “Our youngsters need to work for at least 70 hours a week. After the Second World War, the people of Germany and Japan worked for extra hours for the sake of their country. The youngsters in India also own the country and work hard for the sake of our economy,”. On paper, he was right, one generation has to work extra hard to lift the country to get it to the top, here in US for example, the greatest generation, men and women who returned from WWII, working extra hard laid the foundation for this country to become #1. But it was a voluntary act, not driven by labor laws. If Karnataka indeed adopts the law, combining it with horrendous traffic situation in Bengaluru, mental hospitals there will be brimming with patients, techie patients I mean! It looks like Karnataka government is trying to dismantle its status as the tech hub of the country. Only last week it proposed job quotas for locals, Kannadigas and now this. Hyderabad must be salivating; frustrated techies living on edge in Bengaluru might decide to flee to there, it could very well take India's Silicon Valley crown away from Bengaluru! As to work/ life balance Mr. Murthy might have an answer, \"just marry an ugly wife (or for women techies, an ugly husband!), you will stay at work longer\"!\n\n\" So, in what 'avatar' will Kamala Harris show up in campaigning for president? \" “Avatar” is a Sanskrit word meaning a “descent.” It refers to a deity descending to earth in a form he or she chooses to deal with evil. According to Hindu scriptures goddess Durga (originally Shiva's wife) transformed herself into goddess Kali her most ferocious avatar when she came down to earth to annihilate devil Mahishasura. She made herself fierce looking baring fanged teeth, tongue sticking out, she sure did not want to look wimpy fighting that monster. According to Hindu mythology, she fought him for 11 days until he was vanquished. That word avatar unfortunately has been butchered by the west to meaning assumption of different personalities to suit a circumstance. Of course, the movie Avatar had a totally different meaning, it referred to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora. Glad I never saw that movie! In any case, United States being a country of immigrants, its inhabitants have a habit of expressing their identities in hyphenated form, I am an Italian American, a Chinese American, an African American etc. People who are bi-racial like Kamala have a further challenge. In Kamala's case, her mother was an Indian and her father Jamaican, she wondered if she should call herself Indian American, Jamaican American or African American. Some biracial individuals handle it beautifully like President Obama did, though he had a white mother from Kansas and an African father, he identified himself as an African American. On the other hand, some don't, in actress Halle Berry's case it was messy, born to a black father and a white mother, Berry has stated that her biracial background was \"painful and confusing\". According to her own recount, Kamala grew up very close to her Indian mother as her father abandoned the family at an early age. She says she had strained relationship with her father, that in fact they had not spoken to each other in a long time. That being the case, she should be calling herself an Indian American, right? Wrong, she is careful about it, keeps her Indian connection at a distance. In spite several invites from India's Modi she never went to India after assuming VP office, Modi even called her India's daughter. btw, Jamaican president when she became VP also called her Jamaica's daughter. Indian immigrants are about 1% of US population whereas African Americans are close to 15%, do the simple math, that is where the votes are. So, it made more sense for her to assume \"African American\" avatar. It will be interesting to see if \"Kali Devi\" Kamala is able to vanquish white Mahishasura Trump at the polls! Btw, it appears Kamala got a call soon after Biden told he was out, she would get his backing, it was Bibi Netanyahu. He told her, “Congrats to Israel’s daughter-in- law, Israel is very proud of you”, you see she is married to a Jewish guy!\n\n\" BCCI's no news, very diplomatic, highly sanitized press conference! \" Leave it to Indians to say nothing using highfalutin words, they are world champions at it. India's new coach along with the chief selector held the much-ballyhooed press conference. The Indian media and cricket fans were anxious to hear the rationality deployed in their making drastic changes, i.e., sidelining Hardik Pandya, choosing SKY to replace him, getting Sharma, Kohli to play in Sri Lanka etc. Agarkar said Pandya's continued fitness was an issue (but he was fine until the last tour, was made vice-captain in recently concluded T20 WC!). The most hilarious quote was, \"The stars cannot pick and choose their series anymore\". BCCI is struggling to convey there is only one set of rules for all players but in truth none of its rules applies to its three super stars Sharma, Kohli and Bumrah. At least the first two write their own rules (when you have crores stagnating in your bank accounts you don't have to obey anyone else's rules!). Gambhir saying Sharma and Kohli have a lot of cricket left in them, they could play even in 2027 ODI WC also deserved a laugh.\n\n\"Will Idli-Sambar make a comeback at the White House? \" Well, if it does make a comeback, one should say it is about time. The last time it was served in that August house was way back in 1962 when India's C. Rajagopalachari (affectionately called Rajai) visited JFK. It was said the aroma and fragrance of shallots along with drumsticks/tomatoes in sambar spread all over the west wing. Rajaji then headed of a three-member delegation travelling under the auspices of the Gandhi Peace Foundation making a case against nuclear weapons. It was said that JFK so fascinated with an 83 old man eloquently speaking against the spread nuclear armaments that he extended his scheduled 25-minute meeting to well over an hour. That was the power of idli-sambar! if you don't know what an idli is, it is a type of savory rice cake served as breakfast, it originated in South India. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. In any case, eating hot steaming idlis placed on a plantain leaf served with coconut chutney and fragrant hot sambar is known to double a person's IQ in minutes. It is no wonder two idli consuming Indians are heading two of the largest tech companies in the world, Google and Microsoft. Another idli eater Shantanu Narayen heads Adobe. If Kamala Harris, a dark horse (or mare in this case) at this point does win, come January 2025, you could hear her call WH kitchen over the kitchen every am and bark in Tamil, \"Moonu idli, sambar apro chuda, chuda coffee konda\" (bring three idlis, sambar and later hot, hot coffee). I don't know if the current second gentleman (to be promoted to first if Kamala wins) has developed a taste for idli yet. If not, he better start quick because going with his spouse on campaign trail he has to have a super sharp mind to answer questions shot at him by the media. One of the greatest benefits my family found moving from California to Florida is, due to hot weather we can make idli batter round the year, the batter requires 92 F to ferment. In California we could only do it for a couple of months in a year during summer. India's Modi however when he visits the WH has to pack his own Dhoklas, I heard he is allergic to idlis .... seems he developed this allergy after his party got whacked badly in south India at the last election!\n\n\" Hardik Pandya is now singing blues! \" They say bad things usually come in threes and if you don't believe that, just listen to that old country song, \"Maa waaf (wife) left me, maa dawg (dog) bit me, Maa agent ran away with all maa money\"! Hardik Pandya's life has not been a bed of roses lately, in fact it has been full of thorns. He had three gut wrenching bad things happening to him in a row. The first: He made a horrible debut as MI captain in this year's IPL tournament. He not only failed with his batting/ bowling but was roundly criticized for his captaincy as well. His team did not even make it to the semis. Given vice captaincy of India team, he somehow resurrected his reputation in the recent ICC T20 world cup with solid performance and probably thought his place as Rohit Sharma's successor was secure. But unfortunately for him it did not work out well, he was not only passed over for T20 captaincy was not even named as vice-captain. Second: At the same time, he was getting booed by MI fans during the IPL matches, Pandya was dealing with a terrible domestic situation. His marriage was on the rocks. Pandya and his Serbian wife Natasa just announced official separation. Third: Fans boorish behavior during IPL has reportedly cost him his mental health; according to his friend, he has been struggling to overcome the trauma of getting booed by MI fans. The rumor is Bollywood actress Ananya Panday is helping him heal by letting him cry over her ample lap. BCCI selectors and new coach Gautam Gambhir seem to be testing out SuryaKumar Yadav (SKY) or Shubman Gill to take over leadership from Rohit Sharma in 2026. Split leadership for white and red ball cricket don't work, one leader for all three formats is the right way to go, Rohit Sharma has demonstrated one can lead effectively in all three formats. The bottom line is, Hardik Pandya is a very talented player, but BCCI seems to be all thumbs in handling him. Its accusation that he has a propensity to get injured is a bum rap, injuries are part of any sport, especially cricket. He is a true allrounder and proved he can perform well under stressful conditions in the T20 world cup final when Sharma asked him to bowl the last critical over against South Africa. He might not be the right fit to lead the team but can perform very well playing under a mature captain like Rohit Sharma. The Indian cricket will be the bigger loser if it fails to utilize his talents properly.\n\n\" So, What's next for the US Stock Market? 7/21 \" The S&P 500 closed the week down with a 2% loss at 5505. It was the worst week for the market in three months and proved to be very volatile. Much of the turbulence was caused by investors making mass exodus from big tech stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft and moving into hitherto neglected stock categories, the Dow stocks, small and mid-caps. So, what caused this sudden unexpected action? There were a couple of reasons. The first, there was a feeling for quite some time now that mega tech stocks had run too far, too fast, that they were way overvalued. The first lesson in investing is profits not booked are not profits at all and so investors sitting on fat profits from the likes of Nvidia decided to cash in. The second reason, a belief that Fed was on the verge of cutting interest rates, the market has already baked in rate cuts starting in September. During his testimony in congress last week Powell stated there was substantial risk in keeping rates higher longer than necessary as it would stunt economic growth and hurt the job market. Small caps thrive in lower interest environ as their borrowing costs for expansion, building new factories get lower. The economic data from last two months have showed inflation was slowly moving downwards towards Fed's target of 2%. The retail sales data from June reported on Tuesday was a bit contradictory though, it was flat for the month, showed less than predicted decline of 0.3%. Even May sales were also revised up to 0.3% from 0.1% suggesting American consumers were far from being tapped out. On the earnings front, banks/ finance companies with the exception of Wells Fargo and Charles Schwab had good earnings. Netflix reporting on Thursday had strong earnings as well, it seems to be immune to troubles other streamers are facing. Going forward, we move into the meat of the earnings season. The question now is if the market is going through a correction now (after its great run in June), will it pay much attention to earnings reports. We will also know if the much-ballyhooed rotation is for real when tech giants start reporting results. The rotation seemed to fizzle latter part of the week when we saw Russell 2000 going lower along with Dow and Nasdaq. I am really skeptical of this rotation. The chart below shows why the IT sector among 11 sectors has so much influence on the market, it now constitutes nearly a third of S&P 500 weighting and nearly 40% of S&P 500 gains this year have come from this sector.\n\n\" India cricket's effort to build new teams seems to be full of hiccups! \" With seniors Sharma, Kohli and Jadeja beginning their tread toward sunset, everyone thought that with so much talent at hand BCCI would build next gen teams all 3-formats in a jiffy. It appears not to be so, seems to be replete with so many stumbles. It's first attempt to groom Hardik Pandya as Sharma's successor has failed. He was supposed to lead ODI team to Sri Lanka. Now they have picked Sharma with Shubman Gill his deputy. By making Gill VC for T20 as well, it looks like Hardik is off BCCI's focus. This could be because Hardik is going through some family turbulence with rumors afloat, he is having marital troubles. Whatever the case BCCI selectors appear to be highly indecisive, their focus seems to be on just winning the next tournament using veterans (which happens to be tournament of champions in this case) and not taking a longer-term view of developing new fresh teams. As to how Gambhir will blend with Sharma-Kohli down in Sri Lanka, as well as Ravan blended with Ram-Laxman, the relationship is likely to be frosty! Gambhir will have to put up with them (or vice versa) at least until the end of next year.\n\n\" Is this market rotation for real? \" No one loves a diverse market where all stocks from all sectors march in lockstep as I do. A diverse market is a healthy market. Broad market rallies like the ones we saw in the 90s add a safety factor to our equity investments. However, with the rise of mega techs, all the old market equations have gone topsy turvy. The current market rally has been too concentrated, restricted to mega stocks like Mag 7. About 40% of recent S&P 500 gains have come from just the top 10 tech stocks. Nvidia for example now selling at a mind numbing 70 P/E has gained over 155% this year whereas a stock like GM, though it has gained 30% YTD is selling at 6 P/E. Small and mid-caps have underperformed so far this year but since the market has baked in a 100% possibility of a rate cut in September, we are now seeing them rally. Small caps flourish when interest rates are low as those companies can borrow money at reasonable rates to expand their business, build more factories. The real test to find whether we are seeing a real market rotation, or a fake one comes in a couple of weeks when mega tech stocks like MSFT, AAPL, Meta, Alphabet report their Q2 earnings. If they have barn burning numbers, I fully expect the investor herd to abandon small/ midcaps and rotate back into mega tech stocks again! btw, though most think mega stocks have \"gone too far\", the jury is still out on it. These companies (Mag 7), unlike companies in the dot.com era, have real revenues and real profits. They are showing real earnings growth to match their stock price increases, in plain words, they are walking their talk."
