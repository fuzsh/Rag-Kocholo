        "text": "I read your review to my mom. (Quarantine entertainment). She was enraged. She asked me to tell you that her dad was exactly like Vietnam Veedu Shivaji and she still cannot see the film without crying as Shivaji brings her dad alive. On the other hand, she thinks Gauravam is the over acting Shivaji, although she has heard about an actual lawyer on whom the performance is based.\n\nHaha! She‚Äôs what you‚Äôd call a fan girl when it comes to Shivaji.\n\nTo further sudharsanansampath‚Äôs point, I think a lot of people modeled themselves on films. My dad was a bit like that too. He would react like a Vietnam Veedu Sivaji or a Major Chandrakanth. Life imitates art as much as art imitates life sometimes\n\n‚Äù I‚Äôve heard a story about the time he was asked why he overacted so much. He apparently played the same scene very subtly, and said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I cannot do that. It‚Äôs just that the audiences want this.‚Äù‚Äù ‚Äì Reminds me of a similar anecdote about Talat and his famous/infamous vibrato. Once he sang without it in the recording and the music director chided him. He said he had sung it like that because that was the fashion nowadays (this incident was in the 60s when Rafi had taken over) but the music director protested that he wouldn‚Äôt be Talat without the vibrato.\n\n@Sudharshan: Gauravam was heavily inspired and to an extent, doctored by the legendary advocate V.P. Raman, who is better known today as the father of Mohan V. Raman. The pipe smoking and dressing was inspired by T.S. Krishna and T.S. Narayanaswami. More trivia here üôÇ\n\nhttp://mohanramanmuses.blogspot.com/2011/09/gowravam-re-visited.html.\n\nI think the over-the-proverbial-top acting in Vietnam Veedu was justified by the context of the content. Unlike Death of a salesman, this isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúa‚Äù salesman, it is about ‚Äúthe‚Äù salesman. It is a larger-than-life character and scale of the movie is established very early (it is a miniature Vietnam in a house, everything happens at once); he is not playing a specific neoliberal Brahmin patriarch, he is playing all neoliberal Brahmin patriarchs ever! (whereas Gauvaram is a bit more specific). Sivaji always played the archetype, whether the writing/directing was there or not. Watching it now is like watching Ranveer play Alauddin in Padmavat; the overacting is much of the fun.\n\nWe have to also accept that we Tamils are generally over the top even in our day-to-day lives. Generally the way we speak with our family and friends (literally loud), how we react to events around us, everything about us is loud. Sivaji Ganesan merely portrayed that on screen. Brilliant actor, probably India‚Äôs greatest.\n\nHe was M. Karnan (not R).\n\nI remember watching Sorgam, VV, Pattanathil Bhootham, Ganga, Jakkamma in Sun TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúKaaviya Bhudhan‚Äù during a quarterly vacation.\n\nAbout the overacting part, I think it was a wise decision. Mridhanga Chakravarthy (1983) is one film which even hard-core Sivaji fans might find it difficult to tolerate. When Ananda Vikatan panned his performance in the film, his fans made legal threats and successfully demanded an apology from the editor. This was in the 80s when his stardom was already on the wane and he started to play his age. Later during the release of Viduthalai, fans of both Sivaji and Rajini ended up in a fist-fight.\n\nThanks Yajiv! I wanted to\n\nlike the movie /- but no way for the reasons BR has listed. Still just the way the man says his wife‚Äôs name ‚Äî Savithri . It was something else.\n\nSudharsananSampath ‚Äî my maternal grandfather was just like him, I think. maybe we are related üôÇ"
