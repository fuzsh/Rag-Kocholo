His fame came from his versatility and expressive prowess in Tamil cinema.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,012,118\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#2\n\nHe was the first South Indian film actor who won a best actor award in an international film festival, the Afro-Asian Film Festival held in Cairo, Egypt during 1959. Sivaji's legacy of acting is still admired today, also being an influence to many other Indian film actors. Many contemporary actors in South India have confirmed that their acting styles were influenced by Ganesan.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,012,118\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#3\n\nActing career\n\nDebut as a lead artist\n\nApart from his immense success and reception in Tamil cinema, he has also acted in Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, and Kannada-language films. Ganesan's first film was the Tamil film Parasakthi in 1952, co-starring actress Pandari Bai. The script for the film was written and directed by the now-Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi. He took his stage name from Emperor Shivaji, one of the roles he had once enacted.[citation needed]\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,012,118\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#4\n\nDonning versatile roles\n\nIn most of Ganesan's films, he played multiple roles, commercial roles, and roles of a Hindu deity specially the Lord Shiva role. The portryal of Lord shiva in the movie Thiruvilayaadal won him lot of accolades in and around the film industry. In the film Navarathiri (1964), Ganesan donned nine different roles that represented the nine emotional states of a person.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,012,118\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#5\n\nHindi actor, Sanjeev Kumar, was inspired by this film and reprised the nine roles in Naya Din Nayi Raat in 1974. Ganesan could strike a balance between commercial cinema, Mythological cinema and experimental cinema. Sivaji was always unique when compared to other actors in India during his generation.\n\nSriramajayam\n\nGreat Emperor of Penmai\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,012,118\n\nLocation\n\nMadras @ சென்னை\n\n#6\n\nExpert analyst from cinema admitted the three best versatile actors from India at that time were Shivaji, Dr.Rajkumar and N.
