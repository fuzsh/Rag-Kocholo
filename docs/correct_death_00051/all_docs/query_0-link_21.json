        "text": "As per the plaint, in the iconic Shanti Theaters Pvt Ltd, 50 shares were held in the name of Sivaji Ganesan and 650 shares were held in the name of Kamala Ganesan. Shanti Theaters is an iconic building at Chennai's Anna Salai.\n\nIn October 2021, according to the plaint, the daughters found out that the shares held by their parents in Shanti theatres, worth Rs 82 crore, were allegedly transferred to the sons. The daughter have alleged in their complaint that Akshaya Leisure Pvt. Ltd. was appointed as the agent of Shanti Theatres, without their knowledge.\n\nA villa, later named as ‘Annai Illam’ located in Thyagaraya Nagar was bought by Ganesan in August 1958. This is the house that Ganesan lived in with his family during his time. Prabhu and Ramkumar have been living here with their families, the plaint read.\n\nIn December 1961, Ganesan bought a property under his wife Kamala's name in Chennai’s Gopalapuram. He then entered a joint venture agreement with a builder and the old building was demolished and residential apartments called the ’Sivaji Enclave’ were constructed. Ganesan and his wife retained three flats in this complex. One of these flats was allegedly gifted to Prabhu, the plaint read.\n\nFour houses in Royapettah, that span over 17,122 square feet was purchased in September 1956 by Ganesan. The daughters are residing in one of these houses. The other three properties are allegedly under the possession of the two sons who are allegedly receiving rents from the tenants. They had neglected to pay the share of the rental owned to the daughters despite repeated requests and demands on their behalf, the plaint read.\n\nSeveral lands, to the extent of 43 acres, in Manappakkam and Ramapuram were purchased by Ganesan in his name and in the name of family members “out of his own income without any support from the joint family,” the plaint read."
