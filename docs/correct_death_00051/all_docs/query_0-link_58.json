A local group invoked a court order stating that the statue was on government usurped property.\n\nHowever the court allowed the inauguration of the statue by M K Stalin, the deputy chief of the party on January 25.\n\nChennai kidney racket busted, six arrested\n\nSix people including two women who had planned to ‘sell’ their kidneys were arrested at Kilpauk hospital in Chennai last week.\n\nThe gang included three female brokers and the husband of one of the ‘donors’.\n\nPolice said the brokers Girija, Sophia and Devi were running a racket luring poor women to sell their kidneys and collecting commission. They had also forged documents to show the donors as related to the recipients.\n\nPolice said the brokers had sold their own kidneys.\n\nThis violated the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 that decreed that only relatives and close friends could receive donor kidneys.\n\nVeteran actor in hospital\n\nYesteryear Tamil actor S S Rajendran, who is a contemporary of late actors Sivaji Ganesan and M G Ramachandran, was hospitalised for chest congestion in Chennai last week.\n\nThe 88-year-old Rajendran has acted in over 300 Tamil films after debuting in 1952 in Parasakthi with Sivaji Ganesan. He is an avid theatre artiste and has produced many films, dramas and television soaps in a six-decade career. He is also the founder member of the South Indian Artistes Association and had a short stint in politics.\n\nHe has three wives including actress Vijayakumari and many children.\n\nConvict in Rajiv case seeks parole\n\nNalini Sriharan, sentenced to life in late prime minister Rajeev Gandhi’s assassination case, has applied to the Madras High Court for parole as she says she has to look after her father, a retired police inspector, at Ambalavanapuram village in Tirunelveli district.\n\nIf granted it will be Nalini’s second parole in her 22- year incarceration. Nalini said her 90-year-old father was ailing and that she had not met him for eight years.\n\nNalini had a daughter with fellow convict Murugan during her jail term who now being looked after by her relatives.\n\nGovt takes to cloud computing\n\nChief Minister Jayaram Jayalalithaa granted Rs110mn for installing cloud computing facility at the State Data Centre of the Tamil Nadu government last week.\n\nThe chief minister said this would help the State Data Centre provide quick and secure sharing of Net-related documents among all departments under its jurisdiction. Cloud computing would also cut costs of hiring infrastructure for each department.\n\nThe State Data Centre is a collaborative effort between the federal and state governments for e-governance initiatives.\n\nThree killed by speeding van\n\nA speeding van knocked down five women killing three of them instantly and injuring the others at Attayampatti on Ariyanur state highway in suburban Salem last week."
