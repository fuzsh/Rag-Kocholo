        "text": "Lata Mangeshkar's demise left the entire nation in mourning. On February 6, the legendary singer passed away after a month-long hospitalisation due to Covid-19 and other age-related illnesses. In this week's Throwback Thursday, let us rewind and look at the relationship she shared with thespian Sivaji Ganesan.\n\nDid you know that Lata Mangeshkar considered legendary superstar Sivaji Ganesan her brother? Her first direct song in Tamil was for Sivaji's son Prabhu. She sang the iconic song, Aararo, for Prabhu's Anand, which was released in 1987.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLATA MANGESHKAR AND SIVAJI GANESAN'S WHOLESOME RELATIONSHIP\n\nLata Mangeshkar loved late Sivaji Ganesan to bits. So much so that she never received any remuneration for recording the Aararo song. In an interview with The Hindu, Prabhu revealed that Lata was a huge fan of Sivaji Ganesan. Also, Lata and her sisters would fondly call Sivaji Anna (brother in English).\n\nPrabhu told the daily, \"My brother Ramkumar was particular that she should render a song for the film [Anand]. She came, sang and left for Mumbai without accepting any remuneration. She said ‘I did it for my elder brother’ [Sivaji Ganesan].\"\n\nLata Mangeshkar and Sivaji Ganesan's friendship goes back a long way. In the 60s, Lata watched one of Sivaji's films and came all the way to see him. Explaining their relationship, Prabhu said, \"A bond developed between him and her sisters which continued till yesterday. We became a family. She would regularly send photos, she even did just before the day she was hospitalised. She would send photographs of deities, Baba and my father.\"\n\nWHEN SIVAJI BUILT A BUNGALOW FOR LATA MANGESHKAR\n\nEven Sivaji considered Lata his sister and constructed a bungalow inside Annai Illam (Sivaji's residence in Chennai). Prabhu revealed that Lata would stay in the bungalow whenever she visits Chennai. She also sent gifts to Sivaji's family members often.\n\nPrabhu confirmed that his father Sivaji built a house for her and said, \"My father constructed it in two months. Since she did not like food from hotels, my mother would personally cook for her. There was no distilled water at that time and my mother sent her boiled water in a flask. She would send new clothes for our family during Deepavali and we would send them some gifts too. It happened till last year.\"\n\nLata Mangeshkar and Sivaji Ganesan shared a beautiful bond, which is a great lesson for people of this generation.\n\nALSO SEE | Lata Mangeshkar feared her legacy will not matter to future generation.
