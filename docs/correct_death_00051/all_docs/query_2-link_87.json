        "text": "I think we will have to explore the question of whether it is possible any more for a pure thespian to also be a star. Only when this happens does a star have Sivaji like longevity. There really aren’t many actors who can claim to have that kind of longevity. Dilip Kumar also enjoyed a very long career as star, if with long fallows from the 70s onwards. AB too. By the time you get to Rajni, though, you already see the change. Of course Rajni is a good actor but what has sustained his superstardom is a strong identification with his persona that goes well beyond his acting.\n\nAs late as last year, AB scored a moderate success with 102 Not Out. What sustains this kind of popularity? It is because in AB’s case, him playing his age (or higher, as in 102 NO) has been accepted by the audience. This is a must for stars to have longevity, like the way RDN and Pacino were bankable long after their youth had passed. Pacino was nearly 60 when he played Lowell Bergman in Insider. It worked because that role didn’t require him to look dashing or swoon the audience with incredible charisma (though he was still helluva charismatic as of that role); it did require intense acting. I can kinda of imagine Aamir Khan fitting into some such slot of respectable older star when he gets to that age. SRK has the chops but don’t know where he’ll be at 6-7 years from now if his questionable script selection continues.\n\nBut in Tamil, there is still no indication that it’s ok for a star to just play somebody middle aged and normal (i.e. NOT capable of getting into kola gandu and beating up a whole gang all by himself). As long as starpower is synonymous with action in Tamil, the shelf life of stars will either be limited or, as you said, dependent on their establishing and maintaining mass following that relates to their persona and not so much their acting. When you look at it, action is a relatively safe bet that way. A good actor like Liam Neeson milked it for all its worth with the Taken franchise so why not not-so-Ilayadhalapathi.\n\nVikram did try to be the mass+class star, with monster hits like Dil Dhool Samy Gemini Anniyan and performance oriented roles like Sethu, Kasi, Pithamagan, Dheiva thirumagal, Raavanan. But sadly somewhere he lost his grasp on the BO. That he took a long time to get a foothold here also went against him. But he had the charm and dynamism of a mass star, plus in certain type of character roles he shone like none other.\n\nI remember there was a guy called Babu who debuted in Bharathiraja’s Ennuyir Thozhan – who had the spark as well as acting chops. His was a breakout performance & all the magazines here hailed him as the next big thing in the industry. At that time, our industry was so starved of a good actor, that this boy went on to sign a dozen films even though Ennuyir Thozhan flopped. Sadly he met with a crippling injury during a film shoot and faded away.\n\nOh yeah Navarasa Nayagan Karthik was there – winning 4 filmfares for solid performances in Varusham 16, Kizhakku Vasal etc & He could also be the mass hero as in Agni Natchathiram, Pandi Nattu Thangam, Urimai Geetham etc – but all this just for a brief period of 5-6 years. He couldnt sustain it like a Nadigar Thilagam!\n\nAnd now there is just Dhanush – who has managed to somewhat overcome his disadvantage vis-a-vis his slender frame, in films like Maari, but his physique could still come in the way of him getting certain kind of roles. For eg, can you imagine him or any current star in the Thiruvalayadal fisherman role of Sivaji – where one should have the mannerism of fisherfolk, yet the audience should well be aware that it is the all powerful God himself in disguise. Not even Kamal could have nailed this.\n\nA question for the older generation as getting authentic TamilNadu Box office results is harder than going to moon – Did Sivaji’s offbeat films really work or did he largely sustain his stardom by his family dramas?\n\nHaving followed Kamal’s career closely, I believe that he has largely survived this long as a top hero because of his stardom/like-ability as a hero and not because he is a great actor. Many of his experimental movies like Guna, Hey Ram, Kurudhi Punal, Aalavandhan were catastrophic failures and he needed very commercial follow-up movies to survive. He also had a tremendous advantage in the fact that he could write and direct very well. So, in the worst case scenario of consecutive flops he could bounce back on his own to an extent.\n\nMost of the current stars followed Rajini’s footsteps and not Kamal’s because they have seen enough Kamal’s failures in 90s and 00s that there is no point in pursuing that path.\n\nVijay Sethupathi can be legitimately considered a star only for the past 1-2 years. His previous interesting movies were as a newcomer and then a somewhat popular face. He is either going to go via Vikram/Surya route, do commercial movies and sustain stardom longer or if he sticks with quirky small-budget movies remain in the Tier-2 list of stars.\n\nEven though Sivaji is considered the “actor” of the Sivaji/MGR dichotomy, he still often had a showy quality, with his fiery dialogues (or monologues), chameleon-like range of roles, and sometimes multiple roles being a way to show off and command the screen. He wasn’t always doing that, but those things are a form of playing to the gallery.\n\nBut to be truly “massy” an actor has to have a “makkallukku nallathu panren” kind of persona across films, without much variation in the core character, that’s instantly identifiable.\n\nBaradwaj wrote: “The circumstances that allowed a Sivaji Ganesan or even a Kamal Haasan to flourish don’t exist anymore.”\n\nWhat were those circumstances? What was the social situation and film-going climate like that made the lead in a drama like “Parasakthi” a superstar, and what was the climate going forward that sustained the superstardom of such an actor?\n\n“The success of a clutch of smaller films last year gives hope that the anti-blockbuster has a place in the market, too. But will they give us long-lasting actors whose “acting” becomes the pillar of their stardom? One can only hope.”\n\nPerhaps the people today who gravitate towards anti-blockbusters more than the mainstream films follow directors more than they do actors, hence the lack of an anti-blockbuster superstar on par with the mass heroes?\n\nI think it is going to be hard to see someone like Sivaji, with his acting skills, stardom, and longevity. Firstly, he is a great actor, got the opportunities, and he took the opportunities. Sometimes, I felt he made many bad choices, saying YES to directors who relied on tear jerkers, but still it is really surprising he overcame all those to keep acting in father roles in late 90s. His body of work is highly impressive. Along with Karnan and Veerapandiya Kattabomman, we get a Motor Sundaram Pillai and Aalaya Mani. People complain about his over the top acting, but it worked for me, except the manipulative tear jerker dramas. I am still impressed and moved by the emotional burst of Enge Nimmadhi scene from Puthiya Paravai. After Deivame, deivame song in Deivamagan, only other song where I have seen that kind of exhilaration is with Dhanush in Otha sollala from Aadukalam. Bale Pandiya, Galatta Kalyanam, Ooty Varai Uravu, he amazed us with his comic sense. While his star value helped him, he also took risks with challenging roles and stories that did not have mass appeal and actually did not do well in BO too.\n\nIMO, first thing our current lot of actors need to do is take the focus away from BO. They are always in their comfort zone, except may be Dhanush and VJS. Assuming they have the acting chops, I am giving the benefit of doubt knowing many don’t have, they have to take risks like Kamal did. Who in our lot is willing to do the role of Jack Nicholson in The Departed? Or Tom Cruise’s role in The Magnolia. I don’t think even Kamal would be ready. For those roles we have to go to Naaser or Nawazuddhin. Who can pull off the role of Sivaji in Mudhal Mariadhai?\n\nSadly the whole eco system, print, online and social media, reviewers (not you BR!!), has moved towards BO mindset, making it hard. It has become a binary, hit or miss. Yes, we need to have mass movies similar to Hollywood blockbusters. But similar to Hollywood, we need a market and recognition for movies like There will be blood, Magnolia, The Master in Tamil. Else we will never get to see another Sivaji. Malayalam seems to be faring better in this, with movies like Maheshinde Prathikaram, Sudani from Nigeria, Angamalay diaries, Thondimudhalum Drikhsakshiyum getting good reception and recognition. Still less numbers in my opinion.\n\nsomeone who was sought out for his performances rather than his “mass appeal”, someone who made dramas rather than “mass” movies\n\nDhanush is probably the closest we have to a complete star-actor today\n\nWe have another triple role in the blockbuster Thirisoolam, towards the end of that decade. And we come to the theme of this piece, that an actorly actor — someone who was sought out for his performances rather than his “mass appeal”, someone who made dramas rather than “mass” movies — was a huge star across four decades.\n\nI respectfully disagree BR. First of all, A great performance is half decided during the writing itself. A great actor understands this and completes the puzzle the writer envisioned. A great Actor like Nawazzudin Siddique can be wasted through bad writing as in Petta. Next comes the TMS. Gauravam, Personally my best pick for Sivaji’s Towering performance is at its core a “Great masala movie” with a heart-wrenching father and son sentiment and a great moral story. Part of Sivaji’s Appeal should be credited to TMS towering voice that expressed those emotions, Kannadasan Lyrics and MSV/KV Mahadevan music. “Naan Asaindal Asaiyum Agilemelame” is timeless not because of Sivaji’s great performance alone but the vision of AP Nagarajan, The titanic voice of TMS, Kannadasans lyrics and KV Mahadevan’s music. This does not mean to take away any greatness from Sivaji. The point is Sivaji “The actor” Empowered the Writers, the singer, and the lyricist and Pretty much Sivaji supercharged these people to achieve the best because he gave them infinite windows of possibilities that these people cannot see with other actors. This perfect MUTUAL symbiosis is what attracted the audience.\n\nNow coming back to the current age, Please look What Virkams has done in I. Vikram gave one of the best performances ever, a kind of performance that would have dethroned Kamal but the writing was so bad, so boring and so amateurish that all 3 years of hard work is gone. Although I want to watch Vikram’s performance, the idea of watching a boring and amateurish movie keeps me away.\n\nBottom line, I would not blame this on the audience or even the current circumstances. Anjaan and Singam series from Surya still gives me nightmares. And what a massy crowd-pleasing performance by Dhanush in Maari 2 rite? Please tell me how many quality writers/Directors that Surya, Vikram worked within the past 10 years? Tell me one example where such a movie failed. Answer Zero.(with the rare exception of 24 that still performed well at the box office and All Vetrimaaran – Dhanush Combinations were Blockbusters)).\n\nThe blame should be squarely rested on laziness and broader ambition of these star Actors and the writers/directors who work with them. Rather than going with the trend or judging what people wanted or targeting that shiny Post somewhere in future, These star actors should shed their False understanding of so-called entertainment(in your own words from Aandavan kattalai review “Entertainment that is about something, that says something”) and try to find that holy grail by working with Excellent writers, directors that they can excite and who in turn can provide broader canvas for these stars to shine. What’s missing is not the crowd’s appetite but a mutual symbiosis of star actors and great writers. Whoever does it will be celebrated more than Sivaji was celebrated.\n\nBalu: I belong to the Kamal-Rajni era, but my mom was a Sivaji fan. So as per my second-hand knowledge: Family dramas were Sivaji’s Box Office trump cards. His historicals/mythological films like Karnan Thiruvalayadal made money, however Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Kappalotiya Tamizhan were (huge?) flops though later with repeated telecasts on Doordarshan, these films became venerable. His biggest disappointment was Sivantha Mann – a mega budget film helmed by the sensational Sridhar, when, around the same time MGR was scoring with his biggies like Adimai Penn. Though Thillana Mohanambal was an all-time-blockbuster, Sivaji had more success With his Pa films with Bhimsingh, AC Tirulokachander etc and comedies like Sabash Meena, Enga Mama, Ooty varai uravu etc\n\nSomeone mentioned Motor Sundaram Pillai. Such a lovely film where Jayalalita played Sivaji’s daughter. I dont think MGR had onscreen children all through his career, but Sivaji played dad to grown up children early in his career – Gnana Oli, Motor Sundaram Pillai, Uyarndha Manidhan, Paar Magale Paar etc\n\nIf only he hadnt dabbled in politics, his last phase in films would have seen much better roles."
