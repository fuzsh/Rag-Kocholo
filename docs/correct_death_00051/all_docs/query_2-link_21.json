        "text": "Indian singer T.M. Soundarajan, who provided the singing voice for yesteryear Tamil screen stars such as Sivaji Ganesan and M.G. Ramachandran, died May 25 in Chennai, India, following a brief illness. He was 91.\n\nSoundarajan sang such Tamil hits as “Ponaal pogotum poda” in “Paalum pazamum” and the titular song in “Anbe vaa.”\n\nHis voice suited both Ganesan and Ramachandran even though both were rival stars of the 1960s. However, due to a misunderstanding with Ramachandran, the latter discontinued using Soundarajan as his singing voice in the 1970s.\n\nBorn in Madurai, Tamilnadu, Soundarajan learned South Indian classical singing at age 7. He gave his first concert at age 23 and then went into singing for South Indian film stars. From 1946 through 2007 he recorded more than 5,000 film and devotional songs, including the famous “Ullam uruguthayya” (The heart melts). His last public perf was the theme song for the 2010 World Classical Tamil Conference, organized by composer A.R. Rahman.\n\nAmong the various honors bestowed on him by Tamilnadu state was the Indian government’s Padma Shri for distinguished contributions from artists.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSurvivors include a wife and two sons."
