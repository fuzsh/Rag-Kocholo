        "text": "If you were a child in the India of early-90’s, you must remember the Doordarshan movie timings. My favourite was the rare Tamil movie that the Saturday mornings brought. It was in one of those movies that I saw Sivaji Ganesan for the first time. As it happened, it was also his best role ever – that of the great Kattabomman.\n\nVeerapandiya Kattabomman – The Talk\n\nThis movie has gone beyond the boundaries of an art and has become the pride of a language. It inspired a generation of Tamils; it could also be the most patriotic Tamil classic that the new generation has never seen. I saw it when I was in the 6th standard (or was it 5th? Hard to remember!). The image of Ganesan in a king’s attire confronting Jackson still remains spanking new in my memory; the eyes red, the head high, the look intense, and the voice reverberating on the walls of the small dining room.\n\nThis speech is one of the most recited dialogues in Indian films. Tamil language boasts of many great poets and writers, but none who speaks Tamil like Ganesan.\n\nNavarathri – The Look\n\nSivaji Ganesan is criticised by some as an actor with an exaggerated style of expressions; something that he proved wrong with Navarathri.\n\nThis was a breakthrough in Indian cinema with an actor doing nine roles in a movie. A lot of movies that followed tried to mimic this with actors playing multiple roles (2, 3, 4… up to 10!). What made this movie unique was the enthusiasm (and, of course, the passion) of Ganesan as a performer. Nobody could imagine that Ganesan could transition from a hero with exaggerated expressions to the nine roles of a supporting actor category (in a heroine-centric movie).\n\nThevar Magan – The Silence\n\nThis movie is regarded as one of the bests of Kamal Hassan, another actor of the fading era of the greats. Sivaji Ganesan’s role is limited to barely 60 minutes; and I always replay the part and watch it again and again. This is very similar to the 15 minutes of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. You can wait three hours for the 15 minutes of Brando. Thevar also happens to be Ganesan’s last significant role. Thevar passes away after an emotional argument with his son.\n\nIt is a silent death; something that we hope the heroic Thevar would have; it is peaceful, elegant, and dramatic, with his grandkids standing and playing on his chest.\n\nGanesan was a thinking actor – something that has become a rarity. That is why those of my generation do not remember the picture of Kattabomman from our textbook, but the one made immortal by Ganesan. I hope that if he was not dead, if I could see him in one more movie, and if I could hear another outburst at Jackson – sadly, it is not to be."
