        "text": "Sivaji Ganesan (born October 1, 1928, Sirkali, Tamil Nadu, India—died July 21, 2001, Chennai) was a versatile star of Indian cinema.\n\nGanesan dropped out of school at a young age in order to join a boys’ acting troupe. In 1946 he made his mark playing the title role of the Maratha emperor Sivaji—the historical character who gave him his screen name—in C.N. Annadurai’s play Sivaji Kanda Indhu Rajyam. When Annadurai formed the Dravida Munnertra Kazhagam (DMK) political party in 1949, Ganesan joined and made his film debut with the classic DMK film Parasakthi (1952). By the mid-1950s Ganesan had begun to move away from the DMK and its atheistic policies. He soon attained fame by appearing in several mythological films—one such film, Veerapandiya Kattaborman (1960), is probably his best-known work.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
