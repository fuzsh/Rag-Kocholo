Chennai: A huge statue of Tamil superstar Sivaji Ganesan will have to be removed from one of Chennai's main roads, the Madras High Court ruled today.

The city police had said that the bronze statue, nearly eight feet tall, made it difficult for drivers to correctly navigate a major intersection on the Marina Beach Road.

The police told the court in earlier hearings that the statue obstructs traffic visibility thereby risking the lives of many on the road. The police said that 21 accidents have taken place near the statue since 2012. One of these accidents was fatal, they said.

The statue was installed and unveiled in 2006 by the DMK government led by M Karunanidhi.

Sivaji Ganesan made his acting debut in a film scripted by Mr Karunanidhi in the early 50s. The star then joined the DMK and Congress briefly before exiting to establish another party, the Tamizhaga Munnetra Munnani. He was also a Rajya Sabha member of Congress.
