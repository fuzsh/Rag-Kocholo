The point of departure for this series is the commitment to regarding the North Atlantic as a centre, rather than a periphery, thus connecting the histories of peoples and communities traditionally treated in isolation: Anglo-Saxons, Scandinavians / Vikings, Celtic communities, Baltic communities, the Franks, etc. From this perspective new insights can be made into processes of transformation, economic and cultural exchange, the formation of identities, etc. It also allows for the inclusion of more distant cultures – such as Greenland, North America, and Russia – which are of increasing interest to scholars in this research context.

The image of Roland in the Basque oral tradition is quite different from the noble courtier of literature and the image of Charlemagne diverges from the Frankish chronicles written in the monasteries of northern Europe. While the Frankish tradition exalted its heroes, the Basque oral tradition, largely unknown to English readers, had a very different interpretation of the events. Charlemagne and Roland represent bringers of war, foreign paladins ignorant of the customary law of the Basques and their way of life. This book is based entirely on original historical sources, contemporaneous with the events, translated from the original Latin by the author, some presented in English for the f irst time. The author has also examined the terrain exhaustively, enabling him to provide a totally new image of the battle and its consequences. Keywords: Rencesvals, Way of Saint James, Epic traditions, historiography, Charlemagne, Roland\n\nThis book examines the events that took place in the Pyrenean pass of Errozabal (Rencesvals) on August 15, 778.1 Not only a mere battle, Errozabal is also the most dramatic episode of a historical event that affected Vasconia, the land of the Basques, for almost the entire eighth century. Indeed, the battle was not an isolated military incident but part of a complex military and political process that began after the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 and culminated with the creation of the Kingdom of Pamplona in 824. 1 The battle of Rencevals is known under a variety of different names, Rencevals (French and English), Roncevalles (Spanish), and Errozabal (Basque). The original Basque term has been preferred. However, it should be remembered that the names are interchangeable.\n\nIrujo, X., Charlemagne’s Defeat in the Pyrenees: The Battle of Rencesvals. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2021 doi 10.5117/9789463721059_pre\n\n8\n\nCHARLEMAGNE’S DEFEAT IN THE PYRENEES\n\nFollowing the penetration of Islam into Europe, the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo—the traditional rival of Vasconia since its formation in the early sixth century—suddenly disappeared in the early eighth century, giving rise to a new political landscape. Indeed, when Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into the Iberian Peninsula, the Visigoth King Rodrigo was in the vicinity of Pamplona leading a new campaign to punish the Basques. Therefore, the Basques viewed the collapse of the Visigothic order with caution, but not without a certain satisfaction and even optimism. The course of the eighth century would pit Vasconia between East and West, forcing its rulers and people to cope with the ambitions of the Christian kings of the north and the impetuous expansionism of the Caliphate of Damascus in the south. Between 714 and 732 Franks and Basques allied against Islam, but after the defeat at Poitiers the situation changed. Pepin the Short, having deposed Chilperic III in 751, became king of the Franks and, taking advantage of the weakness of Vasconia under Waiofar, wrested Aquitaine from the Basques after a bloody eight-year war (760-768), which culminated in the Basque ruler’s murder at the hands of Pepin’s assassins. In 768, Charlemagne inherited from his father Pepin not only a crown, but also a political project. Pepin’s war with the Lombard Kingdom had allied him with Rome, giving way to the dream of a Christian Empire. And the collapse in 750 of the Umayyad dynasty in Damascus led to the Frankish expansion to the south. Abd al-Rahman, last survivor of the Umayyad dynasty, established an emirate in al-Andalus in 755 but faced a serious challenge from the Muslim walis (governors) of the Ebro valley, who took advantage of the power vacuum to free themselves from the yoke of the central power. The relative weakness of the Basque Kingdom, the desire to stop the Muslim advance to the north, and, finally, the project of creating a Western Christian Empire as the heirs of the Roman Empire, convinced Charlemagne to propose in the Paderborn Diet of 777 the creation of the Marca Hispanica. This was a political venture with a certain religious streak, the genesis of the Early Medieval Crusades. However, the first aim of the Marca Hispanica was the conquest and pacification of Vasconia. It was then that Charlemagne crossed the Pyrenees. The year was 778. The consequences of the Carolingian defeat affected not only the Basque Country but the whole of the Western political picture. Charlemagne had to cope with new uprisings in Saxony in the autumn of that year and was forced to undertake a political and administrative reform of the Frankish Kingdom and its newly acquired possessions in Aquitaine and Lombardy. The defeat did not enhance the emirate, which, despite embarking on a\n\nPreface\n\n9\n\npunitive campaign on Vasconia in 781, was unable to capitalize on its victory. As regards the Basque Country, their victory cemented the alliance between the Banu Qasi, Islamized southern Basques, and the mountain leaders, including Eneko, the father of the first king of Pamplona, Eneko Aritza. While Charlemagne abandoned the idea of creating the Marca Hispanica after the 778 defeat, his son Ludovico, who became king of Aquitaine, resumed the project twenty years later and, between 797 and 812, succeeded in dominating the lands of the Basques east of the Pyrenees. After the uncertain outcome of the campaign of 812 and the disaster of the third battle of Errozabal in 824, the empire definitively abandoned the project of creating a Marca Hispanica comprising the whole Pyrenean range and replaced the original dream with a less ambitious Marca Gothica limited to the eastern Pyrenees. In the shadow of these political and military vicissitudes and after fighting three battles in the pass of Errozabal, the Kingdom of Pamplona arose around the figure of Eneko Aritza, whose father had fought in the first Rencesvals. The Battle of Errozabal is one of the most important military events of the reign of Charlemagne. Since it was one of the few defeats of the imperial army this singular episode inspired one of the earliest and most famous epic poems in Western Europe. And, even more than its impact on literature and, by extension, European culture, Errozabal also had profound political repercussions. Distinguishing between myth and reality in the eighth century has been my greatest challenge in writing this book. The few surviving historical sources have been strongly imbued with fantastic elements through the passage of time, and the literary sources have distorted reality through the incorporation of hyperbolic elements. However, we owe to these literary texts the memory of those men whom history made warriors and literature heroes. While we expect prudence, zeal, and respect for historic events—and the suffering they cause—from our chroniclers, we must never deny the pleasure of reading our history, the history of humankind, written as literature as was done nearly a thousand years ago by the master Turoldus. And if this is true for all our Medieval history, then it is even more so in the case of the events that took place here in the Pyrenees on August 15, 778, 1,240 years ago. The Basques have lived with the legend of Rencesvals for over a millennium. The ancient marketplace of the kings of Navarre in Lizarra/ Estella, city of my grandparents and great-grandparents, has a capital—the crowning head of a column—that shows a fragment of Charlemagne’s legend. There eight hundred years ago a stonemason named Martinus carved a depiction of the single combat between Roland and Ferracutus\n\n10\n\nCHARLEMAGNE’S DEFEAT IN THE PYRENEES\n\nthat, according to legend, occurred at the gates of Naiara (Najera), the burial place of the kings of Navarre. On the left side of the capital, Ferracutus rides to meet his rival wearing a large round shield bearing a star, the city’s symbol. The giant protects his body with a heavy coat of mail, made of iron, which gave him his name, Ferracutus, the Iron Chainmail Colossus. And hefted to his left there should be a long lance bearing his banner. On the capital’s front, Ferracutus, left, unwinds a long turban, which picks up, blowing in the scene’s violent wind to create a long veil. Roland confronts him, also wearing chain mail and carrying a triangular shield bearing the cross of his faith. The crash of the two heroes is brutal: Ferracutus’s spear is broken on impact with Roland’s shield, while the impact of Roland’s pike at Ferracutus’s navel sends the giant reeling, losing his stirrups and elevating his legs almost to his waist. Ferracutus does not, however, drop his shield. On the capital’s right face, Roland and Ferracutus continue the fight on foot. Roland bears his huge triangular shield, which protects practically all of him from the giant’s mace which is brandished overhead. Ferracutus by contrast has no shield and has lost his turban, which allows the master Martinus the opportunity to fully represent the fierce warrior: He screams, with his mouth wide open, and has long hair and a thick beard, which is as curly as those of the stained-glass figures of Charlemagne in the Chartres cathedral. The giant arches back as if building momentum to hit Roland, while the latter, rising from his knees, tries unsuccessfully to stick his knife in to Ferracutus’s iron chest. Everyone in Lizarra/Estella knows that Roland could only unseat Ferracutus by wrenching his thick, curly black beard and could only kill him—through divine intercession—by plunging his dagger into Ferracutus’s navel, the chainmail giant’s only weak point. Even then he did not manage to kill the colossus, who, mortally wounded and imploring Mohammed, was assisted to Naiara’s gates. Here Martinus did allow a little license. On the front of the capital, in the background, he sculpted Ferracutus on the ground, decapitated, the image of the biblical giant Goliath. Beyond the royal market in Lizarra/Estella, which is a rare and beautiful example of the non-religious European Romanesque, climbing the steep stairs to the austere church of San Pedro de la Rua, built in the twelfth century, we see another capital that tells the same story; this time Ferracutus’s spear breaks while Roland unseats the giant from his horse. Early on, epic poems sung in romance language were produced, which exalted Roland and the rest of the Frankish warriors in legend. A beautiful example of this tradition can be found in the Roncesvalles navarro that\n\nPreface\n\n11\n\nincludes Charlemagne’s speech before the body of his nephew Roland, in the stained-red fields of Rencesvals, the Errozabal of the Basques. These hundred verses were written by an educated official of the court of Charles III El Noble, King of Navarre, who may have known the kingdom well enough as he walked it to complete the 1366 census. But while the Frankish epic tradition exalted their sons killed in Errozabal, the Basque oral tradition forged a quite different interpretation from that of the poets of the Camino de Santiago (the Way of Saint James). In the eyes of this tradition, Roland represents the bearer of war, a paladin belonging to a foreign court ignorant of the customary law of the Basques and their way of life; as Basque mothers say, they do not want their sons to be soldiers. Xabier Diharce’s poem ‘Orreaga’ reflects this view. The author, writing in exile under the pseudonym of Iratzeder, whose brother was killed fighting the Nazi occupation, compares the arrival of the troops of the Reich and the events that took place in Errozabal. He raises his voice against all those cases in which a man has sought to impose a political project by force of arms, beyond reason and the rights of peoples and their lives: The beech is the most beautiful trees of the black forest On the mountains of Rencesvals goes the soul of the Basques: Between wars and gales still standing along the centuries Mature beech stands silently in the future of Europe. Some warriors, eager to slaughter, thirst for blood and fire, Wishing to crush the Europeans have been here. If Mount Ibañeta could talk about them It would first mention Roland and Charlemagne. Would have liked to behead, rob and oppress the heart And all the people, make everyone vassal. But the Basque people, always alert, have managed to rise, So that in these mountains man continues being man, with head high. Poised to breach our borders, pushed on by violence, When will the Basque soul will fly like the eagle? When will free men come out of Rencesvals? As wise and earnest as Azpilikueta? The mountain stream jumping from the mountain is so beautiful… Sons of the Fatherland, drink with all your heart the spirit of your fathers! Lift up the front and sing all at once, the War of the Basques So that hearing our cry, all of Europe will arise.2 2\n\nDiharce, Jean Mari, “Orreagako mendi gainetan”, Eguna, 4th year, No. 269, 1989, p. 26.\n\n12\n\nCHARLEMAGNE’S DEFEAT IN THE PYRENEES\n\nNear my parents’ house in Altzuza is the hill of Altzuzate, a natural stronghold that protects Pamplona’s access from Esteribar, which is where Charlemagne began his retreat through the port of Zize, before being ambushed in Errozabal by the Basques. And just 24 kilometres east of Altzuza, in Urrotz, there is a block of stone, three feet long, that Roland launched from the heights of Erro, more than 20 kilometres away, when he was about to die. As in the case of Ezpeleta, the legend says Roland missed because as he was preparing to launch a huge boulder, he slipped on some cow dung. But he seized the stone with such force it bears the imprint of his fingers. Visitors may still see the hoof prints of Roland’s steed Veillantif, in Gainekoleta, from when the hero fought, mortally wounded on the Zize pass. As recounted by Jose Maria Satrustegi, Roland covered with a jump the 13 kilometres separating Astobizkar from Luzaide, later known as Valcarlos, where the stone was engraved with the horse’s hoof at Loulone. The Roland of the Basque oral tradition is quite different from the noble courtier. But both the Roland of the Chanson and the Roland who threw rocks from the heights of Erro are legendary figures, twelve centuries from their historical reality. Equally, the Charlemagne of the Frankish chronicles which were written in the monasteries of northern Europe close to the court of Aachen, is far from the person who should have been Charles, the son of Pepin the Short and Bertha, the queen with the goose-foot. The tribulated emperor who could hear the best men of his army, his and his father’s friends, dying while fleeing in terror was behind the legendary Frankish warrior; he was also the man who took on an empire’s fate, who decided the life and death of the kingdom’s inhabitants and the fates of surrounding nations. And it was these same Basques who erected a hermitage in honour of the soldiers who were there defeated and killed and gave the name of Valcarlos (Charles’s valley) to the town that hosted the emperor that terrible night of August 15, 778. The twelfth-century pilgrim Aymeric Picaud bequeathed to us the first and most startling description of the place where the battle took place and where Charlemagne prayed to Saint James before his troops descended on Pamplona, the strongest city of the Basques: In the land of the Basques, on the road to Santiago, there is a very high mountain called Zize pass, either because this is the entrance to Hispania, or because said mountain is the transport route from one land to the other, and the rise is eight miles [thirteen kilometres] and the descent it also eight. In fact, its height is such that seems to touch the sky. He who ascends there seems to be able to reach heaven with his hand. From its summit you can see the sea in Brittany and the western sea […]. On top of\n\nPreface\n\n13\n\nthis mountain there is a place called the Cruz de Carlos, because in this place, with axes and pickaxes, hoes and other tools Charlemagne opened a path to go to Hispania with his armies and for the first time erected a cross and kneeling in the face of Galicia, he prayed to God and Santiago. Therefore, kneeling, pilgrims usually pray in this place looking towards Santiago and they all stick their crosses so that there they can be counted in thousands. And so, this is the place to raise the first prayer to Santiago.3\n\nThe present book is based entirely on original sources, contemporaneous with the events, many of which were published in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica collection and have been translated from Latin, Romance, or Basque by the author. Some of these contemporary sources are here first presented in English, mainly Latin and Arabic sources and fragments of the Basque tradition recounting the battle. There is no other geographical study of the battle’s locale. For ten years I have studied the terrain from Altzuzate to the Pyrenean Zize pass, taking photographs and measurements along the way, exploring the topography of the battlefield and walking the road that the Carolingian army traversed more than one thousand years ago.\n\n3 Rialle, Girard De; Vinson, Julien (eds.), Revue de Linguistique et de Philologie Comparée 15 (Maisonneuve de Cie, Libraires-éditeurs, 1882), 14–15.

The purpose of the 778 campaign launched by the Frankish king was not to fire up a crusade against Islam but to create a march in the Pyrenees, a vassal domain of the Frankish Kingdom bounded by the 600-kilometer (373-mile) old Roman road connecting Pamplona and Girona. Indeed, sources indicate that King Charles negotiated terms with the Muslim rulers of the Ebro valley and there was no offer on the part of the Muslim emissaries to embrace the Christian faith. However, the religious aspect provided a suitable and effective casus belli and the literary tradition presented this military adventure as the first European crusade. Keywords: Charlemagne, crusade, Marca Hispanica, Paderborn, Pamplona, Islam\n\nThe Paderborn Diet, 777 Charlemagne became king of the Franks in 768 when he reached the age of 21.1 As custom dictated, the kingdom was divided between the two brothers (divisio regnorum), and Charles ruled with his seventeen-year-old brother\n\n1 According to the date of birth (747) given by the Annales Pitaviani (Et ipso anno fuit natus Karolus rex). See Annales Petaviani, in Pertz, Georg Heinrich (ed.), Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SS, I, Hannover, 1826, pp. 10-11.

In 778, at the age of 31, Charles envisioned the renovatio Romanorum imperii, the restitution of the Roman Empire, a dream inherited from his father. The new king successfully started the first set of military campaigns of his reign between 770 and 776. In the southeast, in the year 770, Charles crushed the insurrection of Hunald II who, after the death of Pepin in 768, tried to restore the duchy of Aquitaine under the protection of Lupus II, Prince of Vasconia.3 In the northeast, the emperor’s troops entered Saxony (Carlus Saxoniam bello adgressus) and, after crossing the rivers Eder and Diemel, they arrived in the vicinity of Eresburg (Eresburgum castrum), about 40 kilometres south of Paderborn, adding these areas to the Frankish domain.4 In the south, Charlemagne started two campaigns against Lombardy (in 773-774 and 776) as a result of which he incorporated these territories under vassalage to the empire. Desiderio was divested, and Charlemagne took the iron crown and adopted the title of rex Langobardorum that he later passed to his son Pepin (781-810).5 The diet (Campus Martius or Placitum Generalis)6 was held annually at the beginning of the spring, between March and May, in different places designated by the king in the winter. The Campus Martius met for two main reasons: auxilium et consilium. Auxilium meant, in essence, to gather the troops needed in order to address the annual military campaign. The Regnum Francorum was organized as a massive military apparatus, strongly hierarchical and subject to a severe military code. Thus, at the beginning of the year the military forces that would undertake the yearly campaign met to accomplish the goal determined by the king or imposed 2 Carloman was born in 751.

While at first the Campus Martius met in March, they later convened in May (Campus Maius), apparently because the weather conditions were more favourable.7 The grass was already grown in May, and therefore it was easier and cheaper to feed the workhorses and the rest of the draft animals used during the strenuous marches of hundreds or even thousands of kilometres.8 Usually the Franks prepared for prolonged military campaigns that could span anywhere from two to four months. Sometimes, as happened in 775, the military campaigns took place simultaneously in several theatres of operation during the same season. The liberi homines subject to conscription (auxilium) came to the call of the imperial missi (missus dominicus or ‘emissaries’ of the king).9 To fail in the call of duty or fail to disburse the tax stipulated in lieu of service in these cases was punished, as this was one of the main services in the life of a free man.10 Consilium connoted the introduction and approval of matters of political, military, and ecclesiastical nature, all activities linked to the central administration of the Carolingian realm. One of the key points on the agenda was the inspection of the troops and the military equipment that the civilian (dux) and religious authorities had to contribute for the campaign.11 From this perspective, the diet reflected the hierarchy of the Frankish 7 Also referred to as Magicampus, Magi Campus, Maiscampus or, Meienfeld. These Frankish warriors’ assemblies were also known as Conventus Francorum. 8 As recorded in the Annales Petaviani, Pepin the Short first convened the Campus Maius in Nevers in 763, although it is considered that the first Campus Maius took place in 755. However, it appears that these assemblies met at the beginning of the spring, often after the celebration of Easter.

Under the Capitulare missorum generale ‘the most serene and most Christian lord emperor Charles has chosen from his noblemen the wisest and most prudent men, also various archbishops and bishops, abbots and venerable and pious laymen, and have sent them across his kingdom and, along with them, all classes of persons mentioned in the following chapters will live according to the law (‘secundum legem rectam liveth concessit’).

The Campus Martius also provided the opportunity to celebrate religious ceremonies and royal rituals. The excellent diplomatic relations that the Frankish leaders had managed to establish with the Papacy by adopting the observance of Christian rites, allowed the emperor to imbue with divine authority the origin of the temporal power of the rex Francorum, who was crowned under the title of Dei Gratia Francorum Rex. The celebration of the Campus Martius was conducted with pomp and circumstance. As referred in the Annales Laurissenses and, according to tradition, on the first day of the celebration the king, seated on his throne and surrounded by the army, received the offerings of the people in the presence of the seneschal (maior domus or domus regiae maior).12 However, the diet of 777 (Magi Campus ad Paderbruna) was unique for several reasons but mainly because for the first time it was held in the newly conquered Saxony, thus providing the Conventus Francorum a singular political character. The town of Paderborn is located about 300 kilometres northeast of the imperial seat of Herstal, captured after a long war that began five years before, in 772. It was not therefore one more annual assembly but was conceived as the council that would end the wars in Westphalia, thus asserting definitive control of the Frankish over Saxony and instituting the authority of Charlemagne on their principals. The diet was therefore prepared for methodically; as if it were a stage set, a wooden palace was erected on the site where the event would take place. The Frankish sources mention scenic arrangements as the collective baptism of the pagan chieftains in the presence of high ecclesiastical dignitaries and the blessing of the papal nuncio; the chroniclers did not avoid drawing a parallel between the rex Francorum and John the Baptist.13 The annals 12 The participation of ecclesiastical dignities in the Campus Martius was always relevant. In 751, Pepin the Short, the imperial palace’s seneschal, and yearning for the throne, asked Pope Zachary for the license to call himself ‘king’ because the person who held the title and sat on the throne during the assemblies was not a king. Thus, Pepin was proclaimed king and Childeric was tonsured and confined in a monastery as we read in the original Latin version of the Annales Laurissenses Menores.

Charlemagne thus received ‘triumphant but generous’ (Victor et Triumphator atque semper Augustus) the delegation of the Saxon chieftains who succumbed on behalf of his vassals to his rule after years of bloody struggle.15 Finally, the reception of a Muslim delegation in Paderborn made up of the walies or governors of some of the mayor cities of the Ebro valley in al-Andalus was not exempt from theatricality. The chronicles mention that ‘some Saracens from Hispania also came to this assembly, among them Ibn al-Arabi and Deiuzef [Yusuf] that in Latin is said Joseph and his son and son in law’.16 However, the annals do not agree about the Muslim envois who went to Paderborn. The Annales qui dicuntur Annales Laurissenses maiores et Einhardi include in the list of deputies the son and son in law of Yusuf al Fihri.17 However, the Annales Regni Francorum recorded that Sulayman ibn Yaqzan ibn al-Arabi cum aliis Sarracenis sociis suis assisted the diet without specifying their names.18 The Annales Mettenses Priores instead mention of pope Gregory to this present year makes 172 years.’ In King, P.

The walies who attended the imperial diet had to be highly motivated to travel 2,000 kilometres from Zaragoza to Paderborn via Barcelona. In any case, the alliance, which, because of the distances and the state of the roads at the time must have been forged at least a year earlier, was difficult to seal because it combined many and varied interests. While the chronicles are silent about the imperial designs, the events that took place in the spring and summer of 778 indicate that once Charlemagne had subdued the Saxons in the northeast (beyond the rivers Ruhr and Lippe) and the Lombards in the south (beyond the Alps), he grasped the possibility of expanding the influence of his kingdom beyond the Pyrenees to contain the Muslims south of the river Ebro. The armies of the Emirate of Cordoba had not broken into Septimania through the Pertus passage since their defeat at the hands of Pepin the Short and the subsequent occupation of Narbonne c. 757. The weakness of the emirate granted Charlemagne the possibility of taking the initiative and, crossing the line into aggressiveness, sealing an agreement with the Muslim governors opposed to Abd al-Rahman I, which would enable him to establish Frankish garrisons in the Iberian Peninsula. Along with the military and political submission of Saxony, this project was most probably the main topic of discussion at the imperial assembly of 777. The Marca Hispanica was conceived by the new king as a vassal domain of the Frankish Kingdom encompassing the southern hillside of the Pyrenees, bonded through the 600-kilometer (373-mile) old Roman road connecting Pamplona in the west with Girona in the east. The execution of this ambitious project meant to revive the armed confrontation with the Emirate of Cordoba and, thus, was only possible through the subjugation of 27 Also named Abu Tawr or Habitauro, Abitauro, Abutauro and ibi Taurus by the Frankish chroniclers. 28 Pertz, Georg Heinrich (ed.), Annales et chronica aevi Carolini, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SS, I, Hannover, 1826, p. 349.

The attendance of the walies of the Ebro valley at Paderborn has led to the conclusion that they were in agreement and that, consequently, the Muslim cities of the Ebro valley were facing the emirate. Attendance of envoys from Damascus was not feasible since the caliphate was undergoing a crisis and, above all, it was incompatible with the interest of the walies since it involved full submission to the Abbasid Empire. Similarly, in the light of events, it is hardly credible that the walies of Zaragoza and Barcelona were willing to surrender to the vassalage of a Christian prince. The fact that the wali did not need military assistance from Charlemagne to the point of paying the price of their independence had been demonstrated in the battlefield. Sulayman ibn al-Arabi had defeated ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri (nicknamed al-Siqlabi), and Hussain ibn Yahya al-Ansari had withstood the siege of Zaragoza, defeated the forces of the emir and captured their general, Ta‘iaba ibn ‘Obeyd. The caliph aimed to overthrow the Umayyad emir, restore the Abbsid order in al-Andalus, and subdue the territory to the vassalage of Baghdad. However, the defeat of al-Siqlabi had foreclosed the possibility of starting a new military campaign in the short or even medium term. Finally, there was no Basque delegation to the diet. Given that the creation of the western division of the Marca Hispanica was only possible by subduing the Basques at both sides of the Pyrenees, we must conclude that the Basques constituted, along with the Emirate of Cordoba, the main enemies of the alliance. In this context, the Dux Vasconum Lupus II played a key strategic role, as the old Roman road Ab Asturica Burdigalam crossed Vasconia from north to south and, logically, the submission of the Peninsular Vasconia would be made more feasible by controlling and even counting on the cooperation of the continental Basques. But none of the chronicles mention Basque delegates from either side of the Pyrenees in Paderborn. The Saxon poet recorded in the Annales de Gestis Caroli Magni that the Muslim leaders surrendered to some extent to the emperor.30 The Muslim 29 From the moment when the first forces of the Caliphate of Cordoba crossed the Pyrenees through Pertus in 718 until the expulsion of the last Muslim detachments in Narbonne c. 757, the Frankish Kingdom was at war with Islam. From that year until 777 the area had twenty years of relative peace. 30 Pertz, Georg Heinrich (ed.), Annales et chronica aevi Carolini, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SS, I, Hannover, 1826, pp. 234.\n\nPrecedents of the Battle\n\n23\n\nhistorian Abu al-Hassan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad, known as Ali ‘izz ad-Din ibn al-Athir al-Jazari, who wrote his chronicle four centuries after the events, agreed with the Christian authors that the walies in Paderborn paid tribute to Charlemagne in exchange for military assistance to confront the power of the Emir of Cordoba Abd-al-Rahman I, ‘the falcon of al-Andalus’.31 At a distance of 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) and with the insurmountable barrier of the Pyrenees between them, the allegiance to Charlemagne would be more easily negotiable (cheaper), more beneficial, and subtler than a pact with the emir of Cordoba or the caliph of Baghdad. On the other hand, there were precedents. In 759 the governor of Barcelona had offered the submission of his city to Pepin the Short in exchange for protection against the emir of Cordoba and, in 765 the Frankish Kingdom had sent ambassadors to Baghdad.32 Finally, the subsequent establishment of the Marca Gothica or Gothia also indicates that the provisions adopted in Paderborn were not far from what was recorded by al-Athir.33 While the chronicles do not mention it and, although we assume that the walies were independent from each other, it is not possible to def ine exactly what kind of political relationship and what military or administrative ties existed among them. On the other hand, we must also explain why, once the deal with the Muslim leaders was sealed in Paderborn, Charlemagne planned and organized such an expensive military campaign involving the conscription of two armies (‘Hispaniam quam maximo poterat belli apparatu adgreditur’)34 and facing a 3,000-kilometres march (1,864 miles). The author of the Vita Karoli Magni points out the obvious: The king arranged such a formidable force because he was going to start a military campaign in Hispania (‘Hispaniam quam maximo poterat belli apparatu adgreditur’);35 once war against the emirate south of the Ebro River was unnecessary, the only enemy of the alliance were the Basques. 31 Ibn al-Athir, Annales du Maghreb & de l’Espagne traduites et annotées par Edmond Fagnan, Typographie Adolphe Jourdan, Alger, 1898, pp. 128-129. 32 Bury, John B.; Brooke, Zachary N., The Cambridge Medieval History, Macmillan, 1913, vol. 2, pp. 604-606. 33 The events that took place subsequently indicate that the conciliation of interests was impossible to get and that the submission of the Balearic Islands (799), or the capitulation and control of Barcelona (801), Tarragona (809) and Tortosa (811) was only possible after military occupation and by maintaining garrisons headed by Frankish counts. 34 Holder-Egger, Oswald (ed.), Einhardi Vita Karoli Magni, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, Hannover & Leipzig, 1911, p. 12. 35 Holder-Egger, Oswald (ed.), Einhardi Vita Karoli Magni, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, Hannover & Leipzig, 1911, p. 12.\n\n24\n\nCHARLEMAGNE’S DEFEAT IN THE PYRENEES\n\nIn order to ensure the success of the military operations, the Frankish forces needed to capture and control the main trans-Pyrenean roads—the ancient Roman roads communicating the cities of Girona, Barcelona, Zaragoza, and Pamplona along the Ebro valley—and to keep the forces of the emirate south of the river Ebro. When ‘Abd al-Rahman sent his troops to the north against Zaragoza, the forces of Sulayman ibn al-Arabi confronted and stopped them. It follows from here that it was not the task of the emperor’s army to confront the troops of the emir. In other words, the control of the old Roman road along the Ebro valley was to be beforehand secured by the walies. The imperial troops were disposed to capture and control the south-Pyrenean Vasconia, which explains why the king himself led the army that penetrated through Errozabal. Possibly the force that crossed the Pyrenees through Pertus (in the east) was not as large as the first army, since its main task was limited to accepting the vassalage of Girona, which had been prearranged in Paderborn, recognizing the territory, and preventing the penetration of an enemy army from the southeast boundary of the Frankish Kingdom. Quite possibly Hussain ibn Yahya al-Ansari offered Charlemagne military assistance to secure the control of the main routes of the expedition south of the Pyrenees, from the south bank of the river Ebro as it passes through Tudela until Zaragoza. The same assistance would be provided by Sulayman ibn al-Arabi in the east; the control of the gate of Pertus and the way to Zaragoza. The control of the trans-Pyrenean routes was also necessary given that these were the only means of retreat. Charlemagne was at great risk when penetrating so far south, about 1,500 kilometres (932 miles) from Herstal, leaving Saxony at the mercy of a possible attack by Widukind. The capture and subsequent control of Pamplona was granted to Charlemagne. In any event, this is the most controversial point of the plan, and whatever the agreement was on the capture and control of Pamplona, the disagreement between Hussain ibn Yahya al-Ansari and the emperor motivated al-Ansari to refuse to open the doors of Zaragoza, leaving Charlemagne at the mercy of an attack of the forces of the emir and his ally Sulayman ibn al-Arabi in the hands of the Frankish king. Last but not least, Charlemagne had to take into account the religious aspect of the campaign because a league with a number of Muslim governors, even if it was an alliance against the emirate, required a major diplomatic effort in relation with the Papacy.\n\nPrecedents of the Battle\n\n25\n\nThe Marca Hispanica: A New Political Project The purpose of the campaign launched by Charlemagne in 778 was not to fire up a crusade against Islam. As far as the sources indicate, there was not on the part of the Muslim emissaries any offer in the sense of embracing the Christian faith. Although the Annales Regni Francorum do not explicitly mention the Marca Hispanica until 797 (‘Barcinona a civitas in limite Hispanico sita’)36 and do not mention a ‘committees marcae Hispanicae’ until 822,37 as noted in the previous chapter, the expedition was the first attempt to create the Marca, that is, an attempt to apply in Iberia the same political system that had provided such good results in Transalpine Lombardy in 774. This plan required the subjugation of the Basques who were not Muslims, and also the sealing of an alliance with the Muslim governors of the Ebro valley.38 However, the religious aspect provided a suitable and effective casus belli. The Marca Hispanica was not different from other marcae of the regnum Francorum, such as the Marca Britannica,39 the Marca Baioariorum, 40 the Marca Foroiuliensis, 41 and the Marca contra Saxones or Marca contra esclavos. 42 It was similar to the Roman concept of limes. 43 Characteristic of a borderland, a marca was a heavily militarized administrative unit headed 36 Kurze, Friedrich (ed.), Annales regni Francorum (741–829) qui dicuntur Annales Laurissenses maiores et Einhardi, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, VI, Hannover, 1895, p. 101. 37 Kurze, Friedrich (ed.), Annales regni Francorum (741–829) qui dicuntur Annales Laurissenses maiores et Einhardi, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, VI, Hannover, 1895, p. 158. 38 After fifty years of Muslim domination of the southern areas of the Basque Country (714-778) there were islamized Basques in the city of Tudela and surrounding areas. 39 The Annales Regni Francorum mention the Marca Britanniae under Count Wido in Kurze, Friedrich (ed.), Annales regni Francorum (741–829) qui dicuntur Annales Laurissenses maiores et Einhardi, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, VI, Hannover, 1895, p. 108. 40 The Annales Regni Francorum mention Tassilo as dux of the marca Baioariorum.

See Kurze, Friedrich (ed.), Annales regni Francorum (741–829) qui dicuntur Annales Laurissenses maiores et Einhardi, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, VI, Hannover, 1895, p. 149. 42 Kurze, Friedrich (ed.), Annales regni Francorum (741–829) qui dicuntur Annales Laurissenses maiores et Einhardi, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, VI, Hannover, 1895, pp. 36 & 149. 43 In fact, Pierre de Marca named it ‘Limes Hispanicus’. See Marca, Pierre de, Marca Hispanica sive Limes Hispanicus, hoc est geographica & historica descriptio cataloniae, ruscinonis, &\n\n26\n\nCHARLEMAGNE’S DEFEAT IN THE PYRENEES\n\nby a count or comites with broad powers and a strong military contingent and, as a consequence, rigidly hierarchical. The Comites marcae Hispanicae would report directly to the rex Francorum, who under the right of conquest accumulated the titles of possession of these territories: rex langobardorum, rex Aquitaniae, rex Vasconiae, or in our case, rex Hispaniae. The marcae therefore constitute the limes or external territories of the Carolingian Empire in opposition to the Frankish territories of the kingdom itself, namely Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy. From this perspective, the campaign of 778 does not differ in relation to the rest of the campaigns promoted by Charlemagne. Building an empire required subduing all those nations that, like the Lombards, Saxons, Bavarians, Avars, Slavs, Bretons, Basques, and Aquitans, were not Frankish and did not want to be part of the empire. That meant living in a constant state of war. And thus it is recorded in the Annales Regni Francorum that the regnum Francorum knew only three years of peace in the f irst thirty-two years of rule of Charlemagne: 777 (preparation of the campaign against the Basques), 781 (coronation of Charlemagne’s son in Rome), and 790 (Hoc anno nullum iter exercitale a rege factum), most likely a result of the inability to undertake a military campaign due to the episodes of famine and scarcity recorded that year. In general, since 769—when Charlemagne stormed Aquitaine—until the end of his reign in 813 (forty-four years), a total of f ifty-two major military campaigns were held. 44 The victims of these military operations were primarily the Saxons (approximately seventeen major campaigns), the Avars (seven wars), the Muslims (seven campaigns), the Lombards (approximately six campaigns), and f inally, the Bavarians, the Veneti, the Slavs, and the Bretons (two campaigns each). The Annales Regni Francorum recorded two large campaigns against the Basques before the coronation of Charlemagne in Rome in 801; however, with the beginning of the new century, the number of campaigns led by Ludovico against the Basques—in his role of king of Aquitaine—increased dramatically, especially after 803. circumiacentium populorum, ed. by É.

But the Frankish kings were not branded tyrants in virtue of the occupation campaigns against Saxony or other nations in various parts of the empire, but rather because of their attitude towards certain ecclesiastical dignitaries as Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims (845-882), who because of the financial disagreements with Carlos Martel referred to him as ‘non rex sed tyrannus’.

Years without military campaigns were rare during the reign of Pepin, and in most of these cases the reason is the preparations for engaging in a longer war. This explains, for example, the absence of military campaigns in 758 and 759, which were followed by the destructive campaign waged against Aquitaine between 760 and 768.84 The Carolingian Empire’s administrative and political system revolved around a heavily militarized and essentially on a war footing structure. The campaigns were overwhelmingly, if not entirely, campaigns for expansion of territory. Neither the strategy nor the policy, the means, or the level of repression that followed leads to the assumption that these military campaigns were defensive or preventive wars. To find an enemy became a political necessity.85 Occupation campaigns were usually accompanied by looting, burning of fields for agriculture, destruction of towns, mass evacuations, and sometimes the slaughter of prisoners of war or non-combatants. The adoption in 789 of the Admonitio generalis reflects the repressive character and, thus, punitive nature of the royal policy.

The Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae, published immediately after the conquest of Saxony and worded in order to subjugate the population, pays particular attention to the religious aspects (mass conversion processes). In essence, the Capitularies were conceived to impose religious uniformity on the imperial domains and thus assimilate the people beaten at the battlefield through a process of acculturation.86 The 797 Capitulare Saxonicum are less brutal, eliminating the death penalty for various transgressions that applied under the Capitulatio of 782. Other clauses regulated the taxation (litus) for the maintenance of the clergy; fines for those who avoided baptism, for the transgression of the laws of marriage, and for the practice of pagan rites. Another clause prohibits the Saxons from holding public assemblies not authorized by a missus dominicus.87 While it is true that the campaigns of conquest and expansion (occupatio) led by the emperor were caused essentially by economic and military factors, the official propaganda endeavored to give these wars a religious and civilizing purpose. Also, the Carolingian cultural ‘renaissance’ was founded upon the association of the concepts civilization and Christianity. From their civilizing character the Frankish kings obtained the title of Triunphator and from their religious character that of Christiannisumus. Obviously, in light of the Frankish chronicles, the subjugated peoples were 86 The Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae was characterized by its extreme severity with regard to criminal law. Death was the penalty for most religious crimes (morte moriatur). If someone killed a bishop or a priest or a deacon, he also must pay with his life. If anyone broke into a church, stole something with violence or by stealth from it or set a church on fire, they should be put to death. If someone in contempt of the Christian faith rejected the holy Lenten and ate meat, they should die (but it was in hands of the priest to find out if this person was forced by necessity to eat meat). Anyone who was considered to be deceived by the devil (diabolo deceptus crediderit) and thus followed pagan rites or ate human flesh should pay with his life. If a Saxon rejected baptism they should die; if a person persisted in maintaining hostility toward the Christians, they should die and, in general, anyone who was considered to be unfaithful to the king, would suffer the death penalty. However, the Capitulatio added that anyone who had committed these capital crimes who confessed his or her crimes to a priest and was willing to undergo penance, this person should be excused from the death penalty under the protection of the priest.

In this sense, we read in the Vita Karoli Magni that ‘none of the wars initiated by the Franks was held so persistently and with such hardness or cost as the one led against the Saxons who, like most of the Germanic peoples, were a fierce people, devil worshipers, hostile to our religion and people who did not consider a dishonour the transgression of human or divine laws’.88 Occupatio was the means of acquiring property or lands that did not belong to anyone, or res nullius. The only way to get a property right on vacant lands was to take possession of them.89 In light of the right of conquest of the eighth century, it did not matter too much if the territory acquired was empty or belonged to a barbarous (uncivilized) or pagan (non-Christian) people, since in either case it would be considered terra nullius. Thus, due to the fact that the civilizing or Christianizing character of a military campaign was the key factor to obtaining the right of conquest over the captured domain, the Church took a decisive role in determining what was and what was not legitimately acquired by occupatio; in other words, the Papacy determined to some extent the legitimacy of the military campaigns held by the emperor and, in this sense, the collaboration of the successive Carolingian kings with the Papacy became crucial, such as in the case of the mutual assistance of Pepin the Short and Pope Adrian I and the later understanding of Charlemagne and Pope Leo III. Religious imagery was the genesis of what would later culminate with the conception of the Holy Roman Empire and of Charlemagne as most Christian (Christianissimus rex) Emperor (Romanorum Imperator).90 After the coronation of the emperor in 800, under the formula ‘Carolo augusto, a Deo coronato magno et pacifico imperatori Romanorum, vita et victoria’, the capitulary of 802 (‘Capitulare Primum anni DCCCII sive capitula data Missis Dominicis; anno secundo Imperii’)91 referred to the new emperor as ‘Serenissimus et Christianissimus domnus imperator Karolus’.92 In this 88 Holder-Egger, Oswald (ed.), Einhardi Vita Karoli Magni, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, Hannover & Leipzig, 1911, p. 9. 89 Lee, Guy C., Historical Jurisprudence: An Introduction to The Systematic Study of The Development of Law, Macmillan, London, 1911, p. 237. 90 His son Ludovico Pio (Louis the Pious) would also hold the title of Ludovicus Magnus Rex Christianissimus. 91 Complete Latin edition in Ferdinand, Walter (ed.), Corpus iuris germanici antiqui, Impensis G.

Four years later, the religious aspect of the campaign in 778 was to turn the Marca Hispanica into a unique political project, with a religious element lacking in previous military campaigns undertaken by Charlemagne, since it meant confronting Islam. Classical historiography on Charlemagne in general or in particular on the events that took place in 778 typically refer to the Basques as being converted to Christianity; however, the reality in the Basque eighth century was much more complex.93 While the continental Basques (inhabitants of the ancient Roman Aquitaine)94 were intensely Christianized and, as a consequence, also the vasconum princeps were all Christians, the reality was quite different among the peninsular Basques. North of the Christianized areas of Pamplona, Deierri, and Araba, the original religion of the Basques was still predominant in the late eighth century. This religion was most likely shared with the Basques north of the Pyrenees living in the area that extended until Sobrarbe and Ribagorza to the east. On the other side, the southern area of the peninsular Vasconia, covering a large area along the river Ebro between Pancorbo and Gallur was deeply Islamized. Therefore, three religions coexisted in Vasconia in 778 although the native pagan religion was the most widespread. After the creation of the Kingdom of Pamplona in 824, Christianity was rapidly spread over the northern valleys, and thus we can infer that only by the eleventh century the Christian religion was the followed by most of the Basques on both sides of the Pyrenees. In any case, the creation of the Marca Hispanica had the necessary elements to be presented in the form of a political project marked by a strong religious character. Charlemagne took the necessary diplomatic measures in order to justify the conquest and thus convert the annexation campaign into a crusade or even into a preventive campaign against the Muslim pirates and the expansion of the Emirate of Cordoba, which had waged a war in Septimania in 718 when troops, led by Al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi, penetrated into the area for the first time (in the time of Charlemagne’s grandfather Charles Martel). War in Septimania would not end until the conquest of Narbonne by Pepin the Short (Charlemagne’s father) in 757. 93 Bard, Rachel, Navarra: The Durable Kingdom, University of Nevada Press, Reno, 1982, p. 13. 94 According to Julius Caesar (The Gallic War) Gaul was divided in to three areas populated by peoples speaking different languages, holding diverse institutions and living under various laws. Aquitaine, or Vasconia, stretching between the rivers Garonne and the Pyrenees, was one of these three territories. See Allen, J. H.; Allen, W. F.; Hudson, Henry P. (eds.), Caesar’s The Gallic War, Ginn & co., Boston, 1891, p. 2.\n\n34\n\nCHARLEMAGNE’S DEFEAT IN THE PYRENEES\n\nCharlemagne had agreed to travel to Rome on Easter Day (April 14)95 778 to have his son Carloman baptized by Pope Adrian I (772-795).96 However, after the celebration of the Paderborn diet in 777 the emperor decided to undertake the military campaign and, as the Codex Carolinus records, Charlemagne received the blessing of Pope Adrian I in May 778, when the expedition was already underway.97 The blessing, like the later crowning, granted the emperor the legitimacy to proclaim the divine origin of his temporal power over the Marca Hispanica and other parts of his kingdom under the formula ‘Karolus divina ordinante providentia rex’.98 Under the doctrine of terra nullius that would later lead to the political concept of the crusades, the papal blessing subsequently gave rise to the falsification of a document, the Donatio Constantini, by which the Pope reserved his temporal authority over the territories not yet Christianized. Under this authority, the Pope would delegate to Christian kings the right to occupy and control the lands conquered or occupied by force. In practice, Charlemagne held the military and political power, but the papal authorization endowed divine authority onn his royal power, all of which is condensed in the following formula: ‘Karolus, gratia Dei regnique francorum rector, et devotus sanctae ecclesiae defensor atque adjustor in ómnibus apostolicae sedis.’99 Subsequent to these events and with the purpose of conferring a religious character on the campaign, the legend of Charlemagne’s crusade was exploited. According to the legend, the apostle James appeared in a dream to Charlemagne and told him that, following the Milky Way, he should occupy Galicia (the northern peninsular coast or the Way of Saint James) to liberate his tomb from Muslim rule. This legend was represented in the 95 King identifies 19 April 778 as Easter day. See King, P. D., Charlemagne: Translated Sources, P. D. King, Lambrigg, Kendal, Cumbria, 1987, p. 344. 96 Charlemagne’s son would be finally baptized by Pope Adrian I in 781 under the name of Pepin. 97 Pope Adrian’s letters to Charlemagne of May 778 are contained in the Codex Carolinus, a collection of about 100 letters between various Frankish kings and different popes between 739 and 791, which was compiled in 791. Unfortunately, the compilation only collects the letters written by the Papacy.

In this sense the Annales Mettenses recorded that ‘in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord 778, King Charles, moved by the entreaties and lamentations of the Christians who were in Hispania under the servitude of the cruel Saracens, came with his army to Hispania’.100 The diffusion of the campaign’s religious character also gave rise to the legend of the Oriflamme or banner of St. Denis (signum Karoli Magni), which was allegedly given by Pope Adrian I to Charlemagne as a symbol of the crusade against the infidel.101\n\n100 Simson, Bernhard von (ed.), Annales Mettenses Priores, Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), SSRG, X, Hannover & Leipzig, 1905, p. 66.

The author provides a detailed description of the itinerary of the two Frankish armies that entered the Iberian Peninsula and the chronology of the march from April to August 778. This chapter is divided into four sections. The march on Vasconia by the Carolingian army at the beginning of the campaign in the spring of 778, the siege and capture of the city of Pamplona in June 778, the infructuous siege of Zaragoza in July and the final retreat and destruction of Pamplona by King Charles in August 778. Keywords: Charlemagne, 778, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Islam\n\nVasconia was a vast territory enclosed between the courses of the rivers Garonne in the north and Ebro in the south. The research of the toponymy carried out to the present day conf irms that within the limits of the most inaccessible areas of the Pyrenees, Vasconia extended to the river Noguera in Ribagorza and the episode of Uthman ibn Naissa (Munuza) in 732 shows that the area of influence of the Basques went as deep as to Cerdanya.1 Unfortunately, the historical sources did not identify the leaders who defeated the Frankish army, but the first king of Pamplona, Eneko Aritza (c. 770-852), was count of Bigorre and Sobrarbe, which conf irms the presence of Basque warlords in Ribagorza before the beginning of the ninth century. However, this immense territory bound by cultural and linguistic ties was not unified under a single central power directly linked to one princeps 1 Flórez, Enrique, España sagrada, vol. 8, Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid, 1869, pp. 310311.

Basque cities also had their own administration linked by federative ties to the rest of Vasconia. As consigned by the Frankish chronicles, Lupus II was the princeps vasconum for a peaceful period of between ten and thirty years, from c. 767 or 769 to c. 778, or even 801.2 There is no mention in the chronicles of any princeps vasconum until 801, when the chronicles make reference to the son of Lupus II, Sancho I Lupus, as taking part in the siege of Barcelona.3 In the peninsular Vasconia, which had started to be known as Navarre by various historical sources, 4 several Basque warlords or buruzagis were mentioned, probably the ones who led the troops that ambushed 2 The Annales Regni Francorum, the Annales Laurisensses and the Annales Mettenses Priores all mention ‘Lupus Wasconum Princeps’ and the Einhardi Vita Karoli Magni mentions ‘Lupus dux Wasconum’ in 769.

Charles Higounet points that Hunald II, who had taken up arms against Charlemagne to restore the independence of the Duchy of Aquitaine after Pepin the Short’s death in 768, was the leader of the Basques during the Battle of Errozabal.

However, the Annales Regni do not mention Lupus who appears in the Chronicle of Ernoldo Nicello (Ermoldus Nigellus): Haec rex: atque Lupus fatur sic Santio contra, Santio, qui propriae gentis agebat opus, Wasconum princeps, Caroli nutrimine fretus, Ingenio atque fide qui superabat avos: ‘Rex, censura tibi, nobis parece necesse est, Haustus consilii cujus ab ore fluit.

The Arab chroniclers mention that during the campaign of retribution against the Basques and insurgent Muslims that took place in 781, just three years after the Battle of Errozabal, the Basques had a leader named Eneko (Enneco), probably brother-in-law of Ximen the Strong. Ibn Hayyan and Ibn Hazm say that Eneko died in 820.5 Eneko must have governed in Pamplona and its surrounding region, and certainly had to hold a relevant political and social role among the peninsular Basques since he fathered Eneko or Enneco Ennecones, who was called Wannaqo ibn Wannaqo by Arab chroniclers6 and nicknamed Aritza (oak or the strong in Basque), the first king of Pamplona, who was crowned in 824 and reigned until 852.7 The Muslim sources also refer to Ximen the Strong, of the Ximena family (Ibn Hayyan called him Shemen al Agra)8 as ruling over an area that roughly corresponds with the current Deierri, around Lizarra.9 The Muslim\n\n5 Estornés Lasa, Bernardo, Historia General de Euskal Herria. 476-824 época vascona, in Enciclopedia General Ilustrada del País Vasco, vol. 2, Auñamendi, Donostia, 1981, pp. 274-276. 6 Enneco Ennecones is the transliteration into Latin of the Basque name Eneko Enekoitz meaning ‘Eneko son of Eneko’. Eneko was also identified in the chronicles as Enneco Ennequez. There are also other variants such as Uneko, Wanko, Wennkoh, Induon, and Endeka. See Estornés Lasa, Bernardo, Historia General de Euskal Herria. 476-824 época vascona, in Enciclopedia General Ilustrada del País Vasco, vol. 2, Auñamendi, Donostia, 1981, pp. 274-276. 7 Ibn Hayyan gave him the nickname of ‘the Basque’ and Ibn Hazm named him ‘Aritza’. Évariste Lévi Provençal argued that Eneko was the father of King Enneco Ennequez or Eneko Enekoitz in the original Basque language (Iñigo Íñiguez or Íñigo Arista in Spanish), whose father, in any case, certainly was called Eneko.

According to the Codex Calixtinus, Estella is a city where the bread is good, the wine excellent is plenty of meat and fish, and is rich in all kinds of delicacies. The original Latin version is in Fita y Colomer, Fidel; Vinson, Julien, Le codex de saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle, Maisonneuve et Cie, Paris, 1882, p. 5. For another English version see Melczer, William, The Pilgrim’s Guide to Santiago de Compostela, Italica Press Inc., New York, 1993, p. 86. Also, around the same time Peter the Venerable: ‘There is in Hispania a noble and famous city that in virtue of its location and the fertility of the lands that surround it as well as for the large number of people that inhabit it, is far superior to other cities around (quibus rebús próxima castella exsuperat).’ Bouthillier, Denise (ed.), Petri Cluniacensis Abbatis De miraculis libri duo, Brepols, Turnhout, 1988, p. 86.\n\n40\n\nCHARLEMAGNE’S DEFEAT IN THE PYRENEES\n\nchroniclers also recorded Ibn Belaskot, the ‘son of Belasko’, who controlled in 781 an area extending between the regions between Pamplona and Lizarra.10 Finally, the chronicles also record the lineage of the Banu Qasi, whose patriarch Fortun ibn Qasi, father Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, married the widow of Eneko Aritza and controlled the area around the city of Tudela, which was occupied sporadically by the Frankish army in the campaign of 778.11 Family ties binding the aforementioned leaders suggest that these Basque principals acted together, confronting a common enemy. On the other hand, the incorporation of Deierri and the region of Lizarra to the Kingdom of Pamplona after the coronation of Eneko Aritza in 824 also leads to the conclusion that beyond family ties, these lands were also associated by political ties. Moreover, the chronicles do not record any rising or commotion before or after the establishment of the Kingdom of Pamplona and, as stated above, all these territories and their leaders were incorporated by promissio fidei to the crown of Pamplona under the figure of a single Rex Pampilonensis. As we have already noted, outside the borders of Vasconia, Asturias was ruled by Silo (774-783). Pope Adrian I (from 772 until his death in 795) headed the Papacy. ‘Abd al-Rahman I was the emir of Cordoba and Muhammad ibn Mansur al-Mahdi (775-785) was the caliph of Baghdad.\n\nMarch on Vasconia In the spring of 778 (late March or early April), after placing garrisons at selected points along the border with Saxony, Charlemagne launched the military expedition to take possession of the Muslim cities and occupy the region of Pamplona, and as recorded in the Vita Karoli Magni, crossed the Pyrenees ‘with the greatest war machine he had’.12 Also, the Annales Mettenses Priores underlined the scale of the emperor’s armies recording 10 Lafuente Alcántara, Emilio (ed.), Ajbar Machmua (Colección de tradiciones), Crónica anónima del siglo XI, Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid, 1867, p. 105.

First, the chronicles consistently record that there was no military campaign in 777, suggesting that the emperor focused his energies, resources, and time on the submission of Saxony, which culminated in the diet of Paderborn, and organizing the campaign of 778, which also was forged in the diet of 777. As pointed out in the previous chapter, most military campaigns were organized in the winter months, and very few years are recorded in which no campaign was held. All this suggests that the preparations for 778 demanded an additional effort that prevented the conduction of a campaign in 777. In addition, as revealed by the sources, the army was composed of Frankish mercenaries, as well as nearly all peoples subjugated by the emperor: Bavarians, Lombards, Burgundians, Septimanians, and even Muslims et coniugentes.16 Interestingly, the sources do not mention Basques or Aquitanians among the king’s troops.
