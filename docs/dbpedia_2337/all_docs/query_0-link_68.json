(1550-1614), Apostle of Charity, Spiritual Director, Counsellor, Administrator, Teacher, Reformer, Advisor and is known as the Apostle of Lima. He was ordained in 1864 and went on to serve the sick and the poor in Peru. Tezza’s new religious congregation was established with the sole aim of sick relief who followed the Rule of the Camillian order as a branch of it. Patronage – Daughters of St Camillus. He was Beatified on 4 November 2001 by St Pope John Paul II.\n\nBirth and youth\n\nFr Louis Tezza was born in Conegliano (TV) on 1st November 1841, the only son of Augustine Tezza and Cathetine Nedwiedt. His father, who was a medical doctor, died when Louis was nine and his mother decided to move to Padova, where Louis continued his studies. At the age of fifteen he entered the Camillian Order (Ministers of the Sick of St Camillus de Lellis). Having entrusted her son to the Camillian noviciate and being certain of the authenticity of his vocation, she herself entered the convent of the Visitation where she was renowned as an exceptional woman and religious sister.\n\nAfter his ordination Louis was entrusted with the formation of the young religious. Four years later he was presented with an opportunity of fulfilling a long standing desire by becoming a missionary to Africa but obedience decreed that he obey his legitimate superiors who were not in favour of the venture. Instead of Africa, he was transferred to Rome as novice master.\n\nIn 1871 Fr Louis was sent to the new foundation in France as novice master, where he would later become the first provincial. Through his dedication and zeal he succeeded in establishing the common life within the community, while at the same time setting up specific Camillian social facilities in the local areas for the spiritual and corporal benefit of the sick. With the suppression of the religious institutes in 1880 he was expelled from France, as he was seen as a foreigner. However, he secretly returned and managed to unite the religious who were scattered here and there throughout the country. Thus he not alone resisted the suppression but he was responsible for laying the foundations for the development that would later follow.\n\nHe was elected Procurator and Vicar General of the Camillians in 1891 and on his return to Rome he providentially met Josephine Vannini (beatified on 16 October 1994). He had for some time cherished in his heart the desire to establish a group of consecrated women who would serve the sick in accordance with the spirit and charism of St Camillus de Lellis. Thus on the 2 February 1892, the Congregation of the Daughters of St Camillus was born, enriching the Camillian charism with the feminine characteristics of tenderness, hospitality, intuition and attentive listening. These were the very gifts which Camillus sought in his religious when they assisted the sick. The Institute was approved by the Holy See in 1931 and has experienced a rapid growth and expansion.\n\nThe Apostle of Lima\n\nJust when it appeared that Fr Louis’ activity was drawing to a close, another very important chapter was about to be written. At the age of 59 he was sent to Peru as Official Visitor, with the brief of reforming the Camillian community of Lima, which for over a century had been separated from the Order and now risked being suppressed. This task was seen as involving a short stay in Lima but when the time to return to Rome came both the Archbishop and the Apostolic Nuncio considered his presence indispensable, defining him as “as a man inspired by God and providential for Lima”. He accepted their request, sanctioned by his superiors, as the will of God and entrusted all to Providence. Thus he remained in Lima for 23 years, until his death.\n\nDuring this time he was to enrich his surroundings with his great charity and love of God, expressed through the exercise of an intense apostolic activity. Besides his work in re-establishing the regular life in the religious communities, he dedicated himself to the needs of the sick, especially those who were poor, in their homes, in the hospitals and in the prisons. He was confessor and spiritual director to the archdiocesan seminary and various religious Congregations. He was sought as a counsellor both in the Nunciature and in Archbishop’s House. He successfully helped another founder, the servant of God Teresa Candamo, overcome her initial difficulties with her new Institute.\n\nHis discreet work and intelligent and deep love, coupled with his loving and authoritative character, led to his being regarded as the “saint of Lima”. Here F. Louis died on 23 September 1923. An unknown visitor carved the words “Apostle of Lima” on his tomb.\n\nHe was described by the Cardinal Lauri as “the holiest priest in the diocese of Lima” and on his death the faithful distributed a remembrance card which highlights the main traits of his sanctity:\n\n“he was sought after as a father and venerated as a saint – he is no longer with us but he continues to teach us from the tomb; his presence and comportment was angelic; his word was that that of a minister of the gospel; his heart a repository of noble affection; his mission was always salvific.\n\nHe passed among us as a heavenly vision, ever good and humble, always charitable. Faith was the basis of all his work while goodness enveloped him like a mantle and tiara”\n\nHis mortal remains are to be found in the Generalate of the Daughters of St Camillus on the Via Anagnina in Grottaferrata (Rome)….Vatican.va\n\nThought for the Day – 25 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:19-21 and The Memorial of St Vincent Strambi C.P. (1745-1824)\n\nThought for the Day – 25 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:19-21 and The Memorial of St Vincent Strambi C.P. (1745-1824)\n\nLeo XII, who succeeded Pius VII, was a warm admirer of Vincent. When he received his request to be allowed to retire from the dioceses of Macerata and Tolentino, he seems to have regarded it as an opportunity to take him to Rome and have him always by his side. This, of course, was not at all what Vincent had been hoping and praying for. What he wanted was to hide himself in some obscure Passionist monastery and there prepare himself for death. Instead he was to have apartments at the Quirinal and be almost on every day parade as the Pope’s confidant. However, he took this destruction of all his cherished hopes with a surprising calmness. He apparently had some sort of inward assurance that since his death was not far off it did not matter much after all. To a friend who was condoling with him on his disappointment, he said enigmatically: ‘Oh, it will turn out all right. St Sylvester will see to it.’ And to another friend he said joyfully ‘You will see I shall be only forty days at the Quirinal and then it will be SS. John and Paul’s!’ Subsequent events solved the enigma and explained his joy.\n\nLeo XII was scarcely three months Pope when all the ailments of a shattered constitution assailed him with fury and threatened to cut short a reign that was more than promising great things for the Church. Towards the end of December, 1823, he was considered past all hope of recovery. Vincent visited him one evening during those days and found him so ill that he remained only a short time. On returning to his own apartments, he ordered his evening meal to be prepared a little earlier than usual. He said he would have to rise very hurriedly that night and wished to get some sleep. In fact, at midnight the Pope was taken so bad that it was thought advisable to give him the Last Sacraments. When told how serious his condition was the Pope asked for Vincent to be called. Vincent then administered Extreme Unction and the Viaticum. Afterwards, as he was speaking to the Pope about spiritual things and exhorting him to great confidence in God, his face suddenly took on a particularly joyous aspect. ‘Holy Father, he said with conviction, ‘someone is going to offer his life for you and I shall go now and say Mass for your recovery.’\n\nAll who assisted at that Mass of Vincent later on testified to the extraordinary fervour with which he said it. When it was over he enquired how the Pope was and on being told that he was much better, he said in accents of great joy:\n\n‘Our Lady has accepted the sacrifice and the grace has been granted.”\n\nThe Pope recovered but Vincent had a stroke on the feast of St Sylvester and died on the following day, 1 January 1824. Cardinal Wiseman, Archbishop of Westminster, in his ‘Recollections of the Last Four Popes, tells how everyone believed that Leo XII owed his life to Vincent. ‘All Rome, he says, ‘attributed the unexpected recovery to the prayers of a saintly Bishop, who was sent for at the Pope’s request. This was Monsignor Strambi, of the Congregation of the Passion. He came immediately, saw the Pope, and assured him of his recovery, as he had offered up to heaven his own valueless life in exchange for one so precious. It did indeed seem as if he had transfused his own vitality into the Pope’s languid frame. He himself died soon after and the Pontiff rose like one from the tomb.’\n\nThe circumstances of Vincent’s death called wider attention to his great sanctity. His body, extraordinarily flexible and life-like, lay in state in one of the halls of the Quirinal for three days and in the Basilica of SS. John and Paul for five days. During that time there was a ceaseless stream of people filing past it, many of whom surreptitiously cut off bits of the Passionist habit in which he was clothed. One of the many important ecclesiastics who came to honour Vincent in death was Abbot Cappellari, who was to become Pope Gregory XVI. Noting the uncorpse-like appearance of the body he tried an experiment. He took Vincent’s right hand in his own and with it formed with the greatest of ease the sign of the cross.\n\nVincent’s funeral was attended by all the members of the Papal Court and the Roman nobility as well as by a vast number of priests, religious and people. Having been, as he had prophesied, forty days at the Quirinal, he was laid to rest in SS. John and Paul’s beside St Paul of the Cross.\n\nIn the bulky volumes that have been written on the profane history of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we find little or no mention of this hero of sanctity. The scales of value of historians failed to register one who was neither a soldier, nor a savant, nor a scientist. Yet, if the standards of the soul are higher than those of the body; St Vincent Strambi accomplished something that weighed down heavily the scales of Divine value-something that merits an eternal remembrance – he lived a life of virtue and selfdenial for God’s sake and he saved innumerable souls.

She reportedly additionally received 68 messages from Jesus Christ. Numerous healings, including the cure of a boy with a brain tumour, have been documented.\n\nEvery 25 September, the city of San Nicolás hosts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and faithful who meet to venerate and honor the statue of Our Lady of the Rosary of St Nicholas. In 2003, on the twentieth anniversary of the first apparition of Our Lady, the second largest group ever congregated: 400,000 faithful. Pilgrims came from all the provinces of Argentina, with a group of more than 1,000 people from Buenos Aires who travelled the whole 240 km distance on foot – a distance three times greater than that from Buenos Aires to the national Basilica of Our Lady of Luján. On 25 September 2013, thirty years after the first apparition of Our Lady, 500,000 people gathered surpassing the record of 2004 when the greatest number of pilgrims visited.\n\nIn a decree signed on 22 May 2016 and made public a few days later, Héctor Cardelli, Bishop of the Diocese of San Nicolás, declared that the apparitions that took place in city of San Nicolás were supernatural in origin.

(1745-1824)\n\nSaint of the Day – 25 September – St Vincent Strambi C.P. (1745-1824) Passionist Religious Priest and Bishop of Macerata and Tolentino, Apostle of Charity, Preacher, Teacher, a man of great learning and prodigious memory.\n\nBorn in 1745 at Civitavecchia near Rome, the son of a wealthy businessman, Saint Vincent Strambi never showed any inclination for any occupation other than the service of God. He found his vocation when after his ordination as a deacon in 1767, he made a retreat amid the Passionists of Monte Fogliano, where Saint Paul of the Cross (1694-1775), their founder, was residing at the time. The Passionist houses are called retreats and by their Rule must be situated outside cities. Saint Paul of the Cross told his brethren on his deathbed, as he had taught them during his active years, to conserve always the spirit of prayer, solitude and poverty, in that way the apostolic success of their works would also be conserved. The life of contemplation, essential formation for any fruitful works, was what Saint Vincent Strambi already desired.\n\nIt was formally declared by St Vincent’s last secretary, Monsignor Catervo Serrani, that it would not be temerity to believe that he knew by heart all the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The same might have been said of his knowledge of Sacred Scripture. His studies of religion, ever an inexhaustible wealth, continued throughout his lifetime, yet his preaching was so simple that all could easily grasp his thought. He never used notes but taught according to the needs of his listeners, which he always discerned with exactitude after praying intently at the foot of the crucifix. As he studied, he seemed to see around his desk the faces of his spiritual children, waiting for the bread of life he was destined to break for them. This method of study has been preserved among his followers in the Order; the Passionists think of and pray for, their future spiritual children before they study.\n\nSaint Vincent became a bishop after many years of preaching missions all over Italy. But never could he forget his Order, though he had to put aside its habit. Saint Paul of the Cross on his deathbed had said to him several times: ‘Padre Vincenzino, I recommend to you the poor Congregation’. When Saint Vincent asked what he wished him to do, Saint Paul replied: ‘You will do great things! You will do great good ! I recommend to you this poor Congregation!’\n\nIn 1773 Father Paul put the former seminary prefect and rector in charge of the training of the young students for future missionary preaching at the newly acquired monastery of Sts John and Paul in Rome. Eventually Father Vincent would write a manual on Sacred Eloquence. In this way Father Vincent was able to be with St Paul during the final years of his life. Paul saw in this young man the apostolic spirit of holiness he was bequeathing to his congregation. We are told that as he was dying St Paul one day turned to Father Vincent Mary and told him he was entrusting the congregation to his care.\n\nVincent, like the others, missed the founder very much as he continued to prepare young Passionists for the missionary apostolate. He also went forth to preach missions as often as possible.\n\nAs bishop of Macerata and Tolentino, he continued whenever possible to rise at midnight for the divine office and regretted being unable to dedicate more than five hours to prayer each day. He called in the poor and gave them alms, he visited the hospitals and the prisoners, blessed, embraced and helped them. He visited every religious house of his diocese, then the Canons and the parish priests. He preached for his clergy a beautiful mission, then organised specialised services for the various professions of the laity, saying, the lawyers need different instruction and different sowings than the merchants or the physicians, for example, to each his own portion of the truth! His table was very frugal, never did he permit more than two dishes. He reduced expenditures to a minimum, to be able to give more to the poor.\n\nHe wished to resign as bishop at the age of seventy-eight and Pope Leo XII ceded to his wish but asked him to come to Rome as his counsellor. That his life was soon to end was revealed to him and when the Holy Father was about to die that same year, he offered his life to save that of the Vicar of Christ. He did not say so directly but told everyone not to be anxious, because the Pope would live. Someone he knew had offered his life for him, he added. The prayer was answered on the very day he said this, 24 December, the Pope rose, suddenly cured. Three days later Saint Vincent was struck by apoplexy and died on 1 January 1824. He was Canonised by Pope Pius XII in 1950.\n\nIn 1780 he became rector of the Community of Sts John and Paul. In 1781 he was elected provincial. He also served as provincial and general consultor. During this time that he published a biography of the founder. Father Vincent used the testimonies of eye-witnesses as given in the Canonisation processes. It is said that he wrote the life of St Paul on his knees, out of reverence for the founder. His “Life” of Saint Paul has become a classic.\n\nThought for the Day – 24 September – The Memorial of Bl Anton Martin Slomsek (1800-1862)\n\nThought for the Day – 24 September – The Memorial of Bl Anton Martin Slomsek (1800-1862)\n\n“Teacher and educator, writer and poet, biographer and critic,\n\nlover of his mother tongue and fighter for national equality,\n\npatriot, speaker and preacher, ecumenical worker\n\nand theological teacher of the Slovene people,\n\npriest and bishop.\n\nSlomsek’s personality is like a mosaic,\n\neach stone has its own colour, its own function and size\n\nbut all together provide the image of a saint,\n\nthat is a person who is open to the breath of the Holy Spirit,\n\nwho prophetically understands the signs of the time and responds to them,\n\nwho understands how to use all natural and supernatural means\n\nto realise the kingdom of God on earth.”\n\nDr Franc Kramberger, Bishop of Maribor, Slovenia, 1999\n\n“Only with a sound formation can men and women be prepared to build a world that is open to the perennial values of truth and love.”\n\nSt John Paul at the Beatification of Bl Anton (Sunday, 19 September 1999)\n\nBlessed Anton Martin Slomsek, Pray for us!\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 24 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:16–18 – Speaking of: Living the Light\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 24 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:16–18 – Monday of the Twenty fifth week in Ordinary Time, Year B\n\n“No one after lighting a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed but puts it on a stand, that those who enter may see the light.”…Luke 8:16\n\nSpeaking of: Living the Light\n\n“Do not have Jesus Christ on your lips\n\nand the world in your heart?”\n\n“Christianity is not,\n\na matter of persuading people\n\nof particular ideas\n\nbut of inviting them,\n\nto share in the greatness of Christ.”\n\n“A Christian is not his own master,\n\nsince all his time belongs to God.”\n\n“We recognise a tree by its fruit\n\nand we ought to be able to recognise\n\na Christian by his action.\n\nThe fruit of faith should be evident in our lives,\n\nfor being a Christian is more than making\n\nsound professions of faith.\n\nIt should reveal itself in practical and visible ways.\n\nIndeed it is better to keep quiet about our beliefs\n\nand live them out,\n\nthan to talk eloquently about what we believe\n\nbut fail to live by it.”\n\n“Christianity is not a matter of persuading people of particular ideas\n\nbut of inviting them to share in the greatness of Christ.\n\nSo pray that I may never fall into the trap of impressing people\n\nwith clever speech but instead, I may learn to speak with humility,\n\ndesiring only to impress people with Christ Himself.”\n\n“Labour together with one another;\n\nstrive in company together;\n\nrun together; suffer together; sleep together;\n\nand awake together,\n\nas the stewards and associates\n\nand servants of God.\n\nPlease Him under whom you fight\n\nand from whom you receive your wages.\n\nLet none of you be found a deserter.\n\nLet your baptism endure as your arms;\n\nyour faith as your helmet;\n\nyour love as your spear;\n\nyour patience as a complete panoply.\n\nLet your works be the charge assigned to you,\n\nthat you may receive a worthy recompense.\n\nBe long-suffering, therefore, with one another,\n\nin meekness, as God is towards you.\n\nMay I have joy of you for ever!\n\nGive.” … (St Ignatius of Antioch: The Epistles)\n\n“Pray without ceasing on behalf of other men…\n\nFor cannot he that falls, rise again?”\n\nSt Ignatius of Antioch (c 35-c 108) Martyr – Father of the Church\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 24 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:16–18\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 24 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:16–18 – Monday of the Twenty fifth week in Ordinary Time, Year B\n\n“No one after lighting a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed but puts it on a stand, that those who enter may see the light.”…Luke 8:16\n\nREFLECTION – “Christ,” wrote a Father of the Church, (Saint John Chrysostom), “has left us in this world to be like lamps…, to act like leaven…, to become seed, to bear fruit.” If our lives were to have this kind of impact, we would not need to open our mouths. Words would be unnecessary if we could show our works. There wouldn’t be a single pagan left if we were truly christians.\n\nWe should avoid making the mistake of thinking that the apostolate consists, in the witness of a few pious practices. We are christians, you and I but at the same time and without resolution of continuity, we are citizens and fellow-workers at very clear obligations, which we are to carry out in an exemplary fashion if we want to become holy once and for all. It is Jesus Christ who urges us: “You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and then set it under a bushel basket; it is set on a lampstand , where it gives light to all in the house.

This deplorable state was due to the fact that the Austrian officials endeavoured to suppress the national language and, to achieve this end, introduced foreign teachers thoroughly distasteful to the people, whom in turn they despised. Moreover, books, magazines, papers and other educational influences were lacking, not because they would not have been gladly welcomed but because they were forbidden by the Government, in its fear of Panslavism.\n\nThis situation Bishop Slomsek was compelled to face. A man of initiative and discernment, the changes he wrought in a short time were wonderful. In the Constitution of 1848, granting national rights long denied, he found his instrument. Following this measure, though only after many futile attempts, he received official sanction to undertake the reform of the schools. The first fruits of his labours were a series of excellent text-books, many from his own pen, which proved powerful factors in the growth and development of religious as well as national education.\n\nThe founding of the weekly, “Drobtinice” (Crumbs), was his next step. Essays and books on a great variety of subjects, embracing practically every question on which his countrymen stood in need of enlightenment, were published in quick succession and his vigorous and incisive style, well adapted to the intelligence of his readers, though not lacking scholarly refinement, made his works exceedingly popular.\n\nHis pastorals and sermons constitute a literature of lasting value. In 1841 he sought to realise a dream of years — the establishment of a society for the spread of Catholic literature. Unfortunately, the movement was branded as Panslavistic and failed at the time but ten years later this organisation was effected and Druzba sv. Mohora began sending a few instructive books to Catholic homes. Today, a million educational volumes have been distributed among a million and a half of people.\n\nAlthough Bl Anton was ardent and active in the interests of his own race, yet he was admired and loved by great men of other nations and his kindness and tact eliminated all bitterness from the controversies in which he was forced to engage.\n\nPatriotism, the education of his people, their temporal and spiritual welfare, were his inspiring motives, as the non-Catholic Makusev remarks: “Education, based on religion and nationality, was his lofty aim”.\n\nHumility and childlike simplicity marked his life.

In this appearance she carried two bags of coins for use in ransoming Christians imprisoned by Moors. On 10 August 1218, the Mercedarian Order was legally constituted at Barcelona, Spain by King James of Aragon and was approved by Pope Gregory IX on 17 January 1235. The Mercedarians celebrated their institution on the Sunday nearest to 1 August because it was on 1 August 1218 that the Blessed Virgin showed Saint Peter Nolasco the white habit of the Order. This custom was approved by the Congregation of Rites on 4 April 1615. On 22 February 1696 it was extended to the entire Latin Church and the date changed to 24 September. St Peter Nolasco (1189-1256) was the Founder of the Mercedarian Order – Memorial 28 January.\n\nPatronages –\n\n• Bahía Blanca, Argentina, archdiocese of\n\n• Barcelona, Spain\n\n• Dominican Republic\n\nOur Lady of Walsingham/Virgin of the Sea:\n\nIn 1061 Lady Richeldis de Faverches, lady of the manor near the village of Walsingham, Norfolk, England, was taken in spirit to Nazareth. There Our Lady asked her to build a replica, in Norfolk, of the Holy House where she had been born, grew up, and received the Annunciation of Christ’s impending birth. She immediately did, constructing a house 23’6″ by 12’10” according to the plan given her. Its fame slowly spread, and in 1150 a group of Augustinian Canons built a priory beside it. Its fame continued to grow, and for centuries it was a point of pilgrimage for all classes, the recipient of many expensive gifts.\n\nIn 1534 Walsingham became one of the first houses to sign the Oath of Supremacy, recognising Henry VIII as head of the Church in England. Dissenters were executed and in 1538 the House was stripped of its valuables, its statue of the Virgin taken to London, England to be burned, its buildings used as farm sheds for the next three centuries.\n\nIn 1896 Charlotte Boyd purchased the old Slipper Chapel and donated it to Downside Abbey. In 1897 Pope Leo XIII re-founded the ancient shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham, and pilgrimages were permitted to resume. The statue of Our Lady was re-enshrined in 1922, beginning an era of cooperation at the shrine between Catholics and Anglicans. In 1981 construction began on the Chapel of Reconciliation, a cooperative effort between the two confessions and located near the shrine. The feast of Our Lady of Walsingham was reinstated in 2000.\n\nIn 2012 the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter for Anglicans joining the Church was given its patron as the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title Our Lady of Walsingham.\n\nPatronages –\n\n• England\n\n• East Anglia, England, diocese of\n\n• Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter\n\nSt Anathalon of Milan\n\nSt Andochius of Autun\n\nSt Anthony Gonzalez\n\nBl Anton Martin Slomsek (1800-1862)\n\nBiographical details here: https://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/saint-of-the-day-24-september-blessed-anton-martin-slomshek-1800-1862/\n\nSt Chuniald\n\nBl Colomba Matylda Gabriel\n\nSt Coprio\n\nSt Erinhard\n\nSt Felix of Autun\n\nSt Gerard Sagredo\n\nSt Geremarus\n\nSt Gislar\n\nSt Isarnus of Toulouse\n\nSt Lupus of Lyons\n\nSt Pacificus of Severino\n\nSt Paphnutius of Egypt\n\nBl Robert Hardesty\n\nSt Rusticus of Clermont\n\nSt. Rupert of Salzburg\n\nSt Terence of Persaro\n\nSt Thyrsus of Autun\n\nSt Ysarn of Saint Victor\n\nBl William Spenser\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Chalcedon – (49 saints): Forty-nine Christian choir singers of the church in Chalcedon in Asia Minor who were martyred together in their persecutions of Diocletian in 304.\n\nMartyred in the Spanish Civil War:\n\n• Blessed Antonio Pancorbo López\n\n• Blessed Esteban García y García\n\n• Blessed José María Ferrándiz Hernández\n\n• Blessed Juan Francisco Joya Corralero\n\n• Blessed Luis de Erdoiza Zamalloa\n\n• Blessed Manuel Gómez Contioso\n\n• Blessed Melchor Rodríguez Villastrigo\n\n• Blessed Pascual Ferrer Botella\n\n• Blessed Rafael Rodríguez Mesa\n\n• Blessed Santiago Arriaga Arrien\n\nSunday Reflection – 23 September – Twenty-fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time, Year B and the Memorial of St Padre Pio (1887-1968)\n\nSunday Reflection – 23 September – Twenty-fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time, Year B and the Memorial of St Padre Pio (1887-1968)\n\n“It is easier for the earth to be without the sun than without the Mass.”\n\nFrom a letter to Annita Rodote on 25 July 1915 on how to attend Mass:\n\n“The Divine Master calls the church the house of prayer.

Like other wonder-workers such as Francis of Paola (1416-1507), Pio freely contradicted inviolable laws of nature. He appeared in two places at the same time to help people in trouble. He summoned friends by mental telepathy or by causing them to smell the scent of violets, which was associated with his presence. He read people’s thoughts and used that special knowledge to tease them . He dumbfounded people in the confessional by describing all their sins in detail. He accurately predicted future events, including his own death. He healed people of deafness, blindness and incurable diseases. And for fifty years he bore Christ’s wounds on his body and suffered enormously because of them.\n\nHow do we understand the appearance of such a “medieval” figure in our contemporary world? Perhaps we should not be surprised that God acts dramatically to get our attention when we lose sight of spiritual realities. God sent Padre Pio to us as a light to challenge the darkness of the mid-twentieth century and to offer hope to a world racked by depression and war.\n\nSt Padre Pio, Pray for Us!\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 23 September – Twenty-fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time, Year B and The Memorial of St Padre Pio (1887-1968)\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 23 September – Twenty-fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time, Year B and The Memorial of St Padre Pio (1887-1968)\n\n“Do not fear!

Among those to have held the position of pope, Peter, Linus and Clement are specifically mentioned in the New Testament. Linus is mentioned in the closing greeting of the Second Epistle to Timothy as being with Paul in Rome near the end of Paul’s life.\n\nThe earliest witness to Linus’s status as bishop was Irenaeus (c 130-202), who in about the year 180 wrote, “The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate.” Linus is presented by St Jerome (343-420) as “the first after Peter to be in charge of the Roman Church” and by Eusebius as “the first to receive the episcopate of the church at Rome, after the martyrdom of Paul and Peter”. St John Chrysostom wrote, “This Linus, was second Bishop of the Church of Rome after Peter”, while the Liberian Catalogue presents Peter as the first Bishop of Rome and Linus as his successor in the same office.\n\nThe Liber Pontificalis (Latin for ‘pontifical book’ or Book of the Popes is a book of biographies of popes from Saint Peter until the 15th century), also presents a list that makes Linus the second in the line of bishops of Rome, after Peter, while also stating that Peter consecrated two bishops, Linus and Anacletus, for the priestly service of the community, devoting himself instead to prayer and preaching and that it was to Clement that he entrusted the Church as a whole, appointing him as his successor. Tertullian too wrote of Clement as the successor of Peter. Jerome classified Clement as “the fourth bishop of Rome after Peter” (i.e., fourth in a series that included Peter), adding that, “most of the Latins think that Clement was second after the apostle.”\n\nThe Apostolic Constitutions denote that Linus, who was consecrated by Paul, was the first bishop of Rome and was succeeded by Clement, who was ordained and consecrated by Peter. Cletus is considered Linus’s successor by Irenaeus and the others cited above, who present Linus either as the first bishop of Rome after Peter.\n\nAccording to Liber Pontificalis, Linus issued a decree that women should cover their heads in church, created the first fifteen bishops and that he died a martyr and was buried on the Vatican Hill next to Peter. It gives the date of his death as 23 September, the date on which his feast is still celebrated. His name is included in the Roman Canon of the Mass.\n\nWith respect to Linus’s supposed decree requiring women to cover their heads, J.P. Kirsch commented in the Catholic Encyclopedia: “Without doubt this decree is apocryphal and copied by the author of the Liber Pontificalis from the first Epistle of St Paul to the Corinthians (11:5) and arbitrarily attributed to the first successor of the Apostle in Rome. The statement made in the same source, that Linus suffered martyrdom, cannot be proved and is improbable. For between Nero and Domitian there is no mention of any persecution of the Roman Church and Irenaeus (1. c., III, iv, 3) from among the early Roman bishops designates only “Telesphorus as a glorious martyr.”\n\nThe Roman Martyrology does not list Linus as a martyr. The entry about him is as follows: “At Rome, commemoration of Saint Linus, Pope, who, according to Irenaeus, was the person to whom the blessed Apostles entrusted the episcopal care of the Church founded in the City and whom blessed Paul the Apostle mentions as associated with him.”\n\nMemorials of the Saints – 23 September\n\nSt Padre Pio/ Pius of Pietrelcina OFM Cap (1887-1968) (Memorial)\n\nbiography here: https://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/saint-of-the-day-23-september-st-pio-of-pietrelcina-o-f-m-cap/\n\nSt Alfonso Burgos\n\nSt Adamnan of Iona\n\nBl Antonio of Tlaxcala\n\nBl Bernardina Maria Jablonska\n\nSt Cissa of Northumbria\n\nSt Constantius of Ancona\n\nBl Cristobal of Tlaxcala\n\nBl Emilie Tavernier Gamelin\n\nBl Francisco de Paula Victor\n\nBl Guy of Durnes\n\nBl Helen Duglioli\n\nBl Juan of Tlaxcala\n\nSt Pope Linus (c 10 – c 76) Successor to St Peter\n\nSt Peter Acontanto\n\nSt Polyxena\n\nSt Thecla of Iconium (1st century)\n\nBl William Way\n\nSt Xantippa\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Syracuse – (4 saints): Group of Christians deported from Syracuse, Sicily by invading Saracens and sent to North Africa where they were tortured and executed for their faith.

On being led to his throne in church, he pushed the silken cushions aside and with tears kissed the ground. His first visit was to the prison. Two-thirds of his episcopal revenues were annually spent in alms. He daily fed five hundred needy persons, made himself responsible for the bringing up of the city’s orphans and sheltered neglected foundlings with a mother’s care.\n\nHe wore the same habit that he had received in the novitiate, mending it himself. The canons and domestics were ashamed of him but they could not convince him to change. Several hundred poor came to Thomas’s door each morning and received a meal, drink and money. When criticised because he was at times being taken advantage of, he replied:\n\n“If there are people who refuse to work, that is for the governor and the police to deal with. My duty, is to assist and relieve those, who come to my door.”\n\nDuring his eleven years’ episcopate, not one poor maiden was married without an alms from the archbishop. Spurred by his example, the rich and the selfish became liberal and generous. And when, on the Nativity of Our Lady, 1555, after one week of illness, Saint Thomas was about to breathe his last, he gave his bed to a poor man and asked to be placed on the floor.\n\nHoly Mass was being celebrated in his presence when after Communion he breathed his last, reciting the words: “Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.”\n\nIt has been said that at his death he was probably the only poor man in his see.\n\nThis is our “mark” – this generosity to the poor, this utter self-giving and mercy. This total trust in Divine Providence. We are often tempted to tend our image in others’ eyes, without paying sufficient attention to how we look to Christ. St Thomas still urges us to rethink our priorities.\n\nWe will be known by our fruits!\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 22 September – The Memorial of St Thomas of Villanova O.S.A (1488-1555)\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 22 September – The Memorial of St Thomas of Villanova O.S.A (1488-1555)\n\n“I am, notwithstanding, inexcusable, if I do not love You;\n\nfor You grant Your love to all who desire or ask it.\n\nI cannot see without light:\n\nyet if I shut my eyes in the midst of the noon-day light,\n\nthe fault is in me, not in the sun.”\n\n“What great profit you gain from God when you are generous!\n\nYou give a coin and receive a kingdom;\n\nyou give bread from wheat and receive the Bread of Life;\n\nyou give a transitory good and receive an everlasting one.\n\nYou will receive it back, a hundred times more than you offered.”\n\n“If you want God to hear your prayers,\n\nhear the voice of the poor!”\n\n“If you wish God to anticipate your wants,\n\nprovide those of the needy without waiting for them to ask you.\n\nEspecially anticipate the needs of those\n\nwho are ashamed to beg.\n\nTo make them ask for alms is to make them buy it.”\n\n“Dismiss all anger and look into yourself a little.\n\nRemember that he of whom you are speaking is your brother\n\nand as he is, in the way of salvation,\n\nGod can make him a saint, in spite of his present weakness.”\n\nSt Thomas of Villanova (1488-1555)\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 22 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:4–15\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 22 September – Today’s Gospel: Luke 8:4–15 – Saturday of the Twenty-fourth week in Ordinary Time, Year B\n\n“And as for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart and bring forth fruit with patience.”…Luke 8:15\n\nREFLECTION – “If you ask me what Jesus Christ means by this sower who goes out early to cast his seed over his field then, my brethren, that sower is the good God Himself, who began the work of our salvation from the beginning of the world by sending us His prophets before the coming of Christ, to teach us what was needed, if we would be saved. Not content with sending His servants, He came Himself, He marked out the way we should take, He came to make known His holy Word.\n\nDo you know what a person is like who is not fed by this holy Word?… Such a person is like a patient without a doctor, a traveller who is lost and without a guide, a poverty stricken person without means of help. Brethren, it is absolutely impossible to love and please God, unless we are fed by this divine Word. What can draw us to follow Him unless by knowing Him? And who enables us to know Him, with all His perfections, beauty and love for us, if not the Word of God, who teaches us about everything He has done for us and the good things He has in store for us in the next life?”…St John Marie Vianney (1786-1859)\n\n“This parable reminds us that we are the soil where the Lord tirelessly sows the seed of His Word and of His love. How do we receive it? And it will do us good not to forget that we too are sowers. God sows good seed and here too we can also ask ourselves: which type of seed comes out of our heart and our mouth? Remember, what counts, is … what comes out of the mouth and of the heart.”…Pope Francis – Angelus, 13 July 2014\n\nPRAYER – All-powerful, eternal God, splendour of true light and neverending day, turn our ears and hearts to Your Word, that we may hear and live by the seed You have sown. May all that grows in us be of Your good seed and yield fruit a hundredfold.

Patronages – against cramps, against gout, alpine troops, armies, cloth dyers, clothmakers, infantrymen, Pontifical Swiss Guards, soldiers, swordsmiths, weavers, Austria, Sardinia, diocese of Angers, France, diocese of Magdeburg, Germany, 4 cities.\n\nThe Roman legion of Christians, called the Theban Legion, under the presidency of their General, Maurice, numbered more than six thousand men. They marched from the East into Gaul, which was in revolt. They were camped near the Lake of Geneva, when they received orders to join with the others in a solemn sacrifice to the gods. They retired a little farther away, to a site today called Saint Maurice d’Augaune, in order to abstain but were told to return and join in the festival with the others.\n\nThey found themselves in the sad necessity of disobeying the command. It was not an act of felony for these brave soldiers, who had already fought many battles but of heroic loyalty. Nonetheless, the barbaric prince gave the order to decimate the Legion. It would seem the emperor’s messengers might have feared a forced resistance but the disciples of Jesus Christ hoped for nothing but a peaceful victory over the world and the demon, with all his false gods.\n\nThe names of the soldiers were written on papers and placed in the caps of the centurions, for 600 were destined to perish as examples. These embraced their comrades, who encouraged them and even envied their fate. The plain soon flowed with the blood of the martyrs. The survivors persisted in declaring themselves Christians and the butchery began again – the blood of another 600 reddened the waters of the Rhone. The others all persevered in their faith and Saint Maurice sent to the tyrant an admirable letter, saying:\n\n“Emperor, we are your soldiers, we are ready to combat the enemies of the empire but we are also Christians and we owe fidelity to the true God. We are not rebels but we prefer to die, innocent, rather than to live, guilty.”\n\nThe Emperor, seeing himself defeated, ordered them all to be massacred. As the massacre began, these generous soldiers deposed their weapons, offered their necks to the sword and suffered themselves to be butchered in silence.\n\nMemorials of the Saints – 22 September\n\nSt Augustinus Yu Chin-Kil\n\nSt Basilia\n\nSt Digna of Rome\n\nSt Emerita of Rome\n\nSt Emmeramus\n\nSt Florentius the Venerable\n\nSt Ignatius of Santhia\n\nSt Irais\n\nSt Jonas\n\nBl Joseph Marchandon\n\nSt Lauto of Coutances\n\nSt Lindru of Partois\n\nSt Maurice & Co\n\nBl Otto of Freising\n\nSt Sadalberga\n\nSt Sanctinus of Meaux\n\nSt Silvanus of Levroux\n\nSt Thomas of Villanueva/Villanova O.S.A.

Around the year 287, Maximian led the army across the Alps to Agaunum, an area in modern Switzerland, in order to suppress a revolt by the Bagandre in Gaul. In connection with battle, the army offered public sacrifices to the Roman gods; the Theban Legion refused to participate.

Jesus loves you with a loving partiality in spite of all your unworthiness. He sends down a torrent of graces upon you and yet you complain. It is about time this ended and you convinced yourself that you are greatly in the Lord’s debt.\n\nHence, less complaints, more gratitude and a great deal of thanksgiving. You ought to ask Our Lord for just one thing – to love Him. All the rest should be thanksgiving.\n\nLet us Pray:\n\nGracious God,\n\nYou generously blessed Your servant, Padre Pio, with the gifts of the Spirit.\n\nYou marked his body with the five wounds of Christ Crucified,\n\nas a powerful witness to the saving Passion and Death of Your Son\n\nand as a stirring inspiration to many people,\n\nof Your infinite mercy, forgiveness and love.\n\nIn the confessional, Padre Pio laboured endlessly for the salvation of souls.\n\nThrough his powerful intercession,\n\nmany who suffered were healed of sickness and disease.\n\nEndowed with the gift of discernment, he could read people’s hearts.\n\nWith dignity and intense devotion, he celebrated daily Mass,\n\ninviting countless men and women to a greater union with Jesus Christ,\n\nin the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nHis life was a celebration of love for You\n\nand an oblation of himself in gratitude to You.\n\nWe pray that You will bless us too\n\nwith total love and thanksgiving.\n\nThrough the intercession of Saint Pio,\n\nwe confidently beseech You to to grant us the grace of\n\n………………… (state your petition here).\n\nHelp us to imitate his example of prayerful holiness and compassion,\n\nso that we, too, may faithfully follow the Risen Lord\n\nand one day rejoice in the Kingdom,\n\nwhere You live and reign forever and ever.\n\nAmen\n\nThought for the Day – 21 September – The Feast of St Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist- Today’s Gospel: Matthew 9:9–13\n\nThought for the Day – 21 September – The Feast of St Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist- Today’s Gospel: Matthew 9:9–13\n\nThank you, Matthew, for your story, because it is you who writes your own story. Thank you, because you were a sinner and became an Apostle. And that is very encouraging for me because I’m a sinner and have to become an Apostle. Thank you, Matthew, because you were a publican who was lining his pockets with the money of the Jews but when Jesus called you, you were ready to leave everything and follow Him.\n\nThank you, Matthew, because you could have stayed where you were thinking that it was crazy to leave your job, your money, your plans and your future… but you were brave enough to follow Jesus instead. And I give thanks with you to Jesus because He knew you well and was aware of the great things that you could do. While on that day some of the Jews looked at you with disdain, that Jew, Jesus of Nazareth, passed by your tax office and smiled at you. He stood there, gazing at you with affection, a loving look, the like of which a publican in Palestine had probably never experienced. And you couldn’t look anywhere else. That loving face of Jesus was inviting you to do something special with your life.\n\nYou weren’t happy and Jesus offered you Happiness. You were wasting your life and Jesus invited you to do something great with it. You only loved your money but Jesus helped you to expand your heart to love God and others more than yourself. Your talents were wasted in that tax office and millions of souls were waiting for you. Thank you, Matthew, because you said ‘yes’ to Jesus.\n\nMary, Queen of the Apostles, help me to have the courage to say ‘yes’ to Him as well and become a saint, like you, like St Matthew and please pray for us all!\n\nFr George Boronat M.D. S.T.D is a Catholic priest from the Prelature of Opus Dei, working in the Archdiocese of Southwark in London.\n\nWe thank You, heavenly Father,\n\nfor the witness of Your apostle\n\nand evangelist Matthew\n\nto the Gospel of Your Son our Saviour\n\nand we pray that, after his example,\n\nwe may with ready wills and hearts\n\nobey the calling of our Lord to follow Him;\n\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord,\n\nwho lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit,\n\none God, now and forever.\n\nAmen\n\nAnd about the story of Pope Francis and St Matthew here: https://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/thought-for-the-day-21-september-the-feast-of-st-matthew-apostle-and-evangelist-pope-francis-and-the-calling-of-st-matthew/"
