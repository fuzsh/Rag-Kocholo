        "text": "Through the educational experience of the «seminar of representation», which is an annual event dedicated to students of the first year architecture at ENAU, this article attempts to explain the pedagogical approach taken to approach the societal relationship to the space of the medina of Tunis and to assist the students in the understanding of this articulation by means of their spatial experiences. The purpose of this article is on the genesis of the idea of the seminar «session 2017-2018», its theoretical foundations and its spatial projections in terms of pedagogical approach adopted and organization of this annual event in the space of the medina. It will present this pedagogical experience relating to the connection between the place «support of study», presented in terms of spatial structure, and the projected educational event.\n\n1.

Despite these important assets, Morocco is facing some serious stagnation in reaching their tourism ambitions as have been defined in their Vision 2020. To identify their relevance for (urban) tourism, it is crucial to understand and to include the historic and multi-layered development. Based on two empirical approaches, we highlight the tourism potential of each medina in terms of the strategic assets and the availability of tourism infrastructure based on information from AirBNB, Booking, and Tripadvisor. Data from these accommodation websites illustrates existing power-law relations in terms of size and scale, and a natural grouping and patterns in the touristic activity of the medina’s. Based on our findings, we propose a research agenda which could further support the Moroccan government in reaching their tourism ambitions with a strong emphasize on urban tourism and the ancient multi-layered medin...\n\nIn ancient times, bazaars were an included part of the city life; bifurcating from the city structure and reflecting each era's architectural characteristics. they are also the source of communications and trade activities. However, due to the quick changes in the cities' spatial configurations that we are living in and the mutation in the materials and methods of construction, these traditional spaces started to run a risk of possible identity loss and a risk of cultural memory alteration. However, despite the disturbing contradiction which is affecting the traditional allure of such spaces, they still reflect an undying identity. They still talk about the engraved collective memory through several architectural traits and lived experiences. Tunisian Medina is one such place that had seen its spatial configuration changing slowly affecting the bazaars initial state. The Medina is also a \"particular space\": it is one cradle of Islamic Arabic trait. Despite the absence of historical documents and official records, the relative conservation of Tunisian urban fabric is enough to permit serious research in the field. It is true that there are a large number of buildings in ruins that made the Medina look different from its old state. However, it is still possible to reconstitute traditional urban structures from contemporary analysis and oral testimony. Its formal configuration has undergone relatively few transformations since ancient times but it still reflect a remarkable typo-morphological continuity spanning over several centuries. What stimulated the exploration of this particular study is the resistive traits noticed in the Medina's bazaars in the modern westernized world. This article explores how the cultural continuity of traditional bazaars can be a stimulus to enhance the resistance against globalization-induced identity loss.\n\nThe intra-urban mobility of Jewish minorities in modernizing spaces in colonial North Africa and beyond is often associated with a linear process of upward social and economic mobility and a related disengagement from the community's 'traditional' spaces, which are associated with pre-modern underdevelopment and cultural segregation. Drawing on spatial theories that pay specific attention to how urban space is experienced and imagined, this article offers a different perspective on intra-urban mobility among a modernizing Jewish society: as dialectical and contextual mental transitions between the oppositional experiences of 'modern-colonial' and 'traditionalcommunal' spaces that mutually shape modern Jewish life across their real and imagined townscapes. Focusing on one of the most vibrant sites of urbanization in North Africa-the international city of Tangier and nearby Tetuan, from the early 20 th century until the 1960s-I show how this dynamic transition was essential in shaping ethnic identity among a mobile Jewish middle class."
