        "text": "Last week I had the pleasure of hosting a workshop at Middlesex university with an inspiring range of sustainable UK startups, exploring how to support small businesses to adopt nature-positive practices. Our conversations were deeper and more insightful than I could have hoped for, and we unearthed a lot of the subtle barriers that are facing SMEs. I‚Äôll be working with participants in the coming weeks and months, but here are some headline takeaways from our work so far: CARBON TUNNEL VISION: There is an abundance of mediocre support for businesses undergoing the transition to sustainable practices, but most of this is narrowly focused on emissions and climate change, demonstrating ‚Äòcarbon tunnel vision‚Äô, and overlooking the crucial impacts of business on biodiversity. We need to build on the momentum generated around climate change to put renewed pressure on the world of business to account for its impact on the planet as a whole. That means strategically amplifying the successes and learnings of trailblazers like those who are ahead of this curve, but it also means continuing to reframe what ‚Äògood business‚Äô actually means: greenwashing your extractive and exploitative practices is not a solution, it‚Äôs part of the problem. COORDINATED INTERVENTIONS: The start-up journey is often lonely, confusing, and frustrating. Expecting already-stretched founders to champion complex practices like natural capital assessment without meaningful support is plainly unrealistic. Dedicated and highly visible spaces for peer-to-peer learning, in conjunction with AI-augmented triaging tools, promise to ease this burden and unleash new waves of nature-positive innovation in the private sector. But those of us wanting to intervene here must make sure not to crowd each other out in what is already an overwhelmingly busy space. Proactive collaboration between the researchers, the tool builders, and the consultants that are positioned to offer this support is (as always) vital. CULTURES OF FINANCE: The world of finance is (slowly) waking up to the urgency of the crises it has funded, and (some) change is a foot. But even while some institutional investors begin to prioritise social and environmental returns, many eminently fundable organisations report that the funders they speak to often ‚Äújust don‚Äôt get it‚Äù. We need to accelerate the cultural changes underway in the world of business finance. There is a role for awareness-raising and greater sector connectivity, yes, but this shift also calls for bold policy action. A fair few fingers were pointed at the likes of UKRI, for example, for presiding over government funding systems that are simply unfit-for-purpose in an era of planetary crisis. I‚Äôd love to hear from folks in my network about their experiences here - what do you think needs to be done to better support the worlds of small business and small business finance to start taking their impacts on nature more seriously?\n\n‚åõ The countdown is on - it's time for the final spurt! ‚åõ In 5 days, on 12.04. is the final end of our crowdinvesting campaign and it's not impossible to make it üí™ But even if we don't reach the full amount of ‚Ç¨1,250,000, we are anything but disappointed! Our financing consists of crowdinvesting, investments from banks and equity investors and every single amount flows into the construction of our SOLARBAKERYS. ‚òÄÔ∏è ü§ùAnd we can already achieve so much with this: ‚ñ™Ô∏è create 120 jobs per bakery ‚ñ™Ô∏è 100 of which are traders who sell the bread at local markets ‚ñ™Ô∏è produce around 3000 loaves a day per bakery üòç And what gives us more joy than knowing that the first SOLARBAKERYS will soon be selling sustainable baked bread on the store shelves? üçûü•êü•ñ We owe this above all to you investors! So many thanks to each and every one of you who has accompanied and supported us along the way and will continue to do so in the future. üíõ If you want to take advantage of the last chance, you can still make your contribution via CONDA Crowdinvesting until Friday: https://lnkd.in/esxMqQJN #CrowdInvesting #Entrepreneurship #Africa #Change #RenewableEnergy #Sustainable #Impact #Empowerment #SolarEnergy #SolarRevolution #ClimateAction #SolarSolutions #Employment Note pursuant to Section 12 (2) and (3) of the German Investment Act (Verm√∂gensanlagengesetz): The acquisition of this investment involves considerable risks and may result in the complete loss of the assets invested. The promised return is not guaranteed and may also be lower.\n\n#southafrica still has some way to go towards developing #entrepreneurship as a significant #driver of #economicdevelopment, #jobcreation and #socialcohesion. The economy has consistently #underperformed for more than a decade now with growth in real #GDP per capita declining since 2011. Despite almost three decades of #democracy, the country remains one of the most #unequal societies in the world. This current scenario urgently requires a more #dynamic, #employmentintensive and #innovationled #growthtrajectory and even more so given the recent and persisting global pandemic. To achieve this will require a #prioritised and more directed #policyframework at a #national and #regional level. A focus on #entrepreneurship would stimulate the #development of more successful #enterprises and formalise many aspects of the South African economy. Importantly, the type of #entrepreneurship required should demonstrate three characteristics: #Socialentrepreneurship: that addresses issues such as #inequality, #healthcare, #poverty and #hunger, and #environmentalsustainability that are based on #businessmodels that create tangible #economicvalue at scale. Finally, governments and other stakeholders require robust and credible #data to make #keydecisions that stimulate #sustainableforms of #entrepreneurship and #healthyentrepreneurialecosystems, There are also persistent #obstacles to #entrepreneurship that need addressing. Notably, a #digitaldivide that disadvantages mainly #women and #youth in #ruralareas and the #informaleconomy in #African countries continues to exist. Lack of #suitableskills, weak supporting #infrastructure, #inadequatepolicy and systems, #shortsightedleadership as well as #culturalbarriers are among the range of issues that compromise translating the full potential of #technology and the #digitaleconomy into impactful #developmentoutcomes. #Governmentsupportagencies Small Enterprise Development Agency_gov (@Seda) Seda provides #businessdevelopment and #supportservices for #smallenterprises through its national network. The agency also implements programmes targeted at #businessdevelopment in areas prioritised by the government. A key #challenge for the delivery of Seda services is that the existing services #vary considerably in #depth and #quality across the #entrepreneurialecosystem. Despite its challenges, Seda has cemented its status as a #leadingfacilitator of #businessdevelopment #supportservices across the #SouthAfrican #entrepreneurialecosystem. Services are delivered in #collaboration with external #businessdevelopment service providers to ensure impact. Over the past two decades, the South African Government has introduced many programmes to promote entrepreneurship development. The average expert ratings of how well these programmes have been implemented and how effective they are suggest a low return on effort and investment according to Stellenbosch Business School author of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor"
