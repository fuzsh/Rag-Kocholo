        "text": "Last Thursday, we were privileged to bring an exceptional entrepreneur and person, Ovidiu Bujorean from Washington, DC to speak to students from Fitionești and Găgești, Vrancea County, where he is originally from. Ovidiu accepted our invitation to share his journey with 5th to 8th-grade students, from joining AIESEC and becoming their president, to starting the LEADERS Foundation in Romania, and going to the US to study at Harvard and MIT University. He also shared his experience from designing global communities such as the Global Innovation through Science and Technology Initiative (GIST), which became a US State Department program active in more than 120 countries and won recognition from President Obama and Secretaries Kerry and Clinton. In his journey, he significantly contributed to technology, entrepreneurship, and government, while keeping close to his heart his determination to make a difference in international development. He emphasized to students some of the global trends and fertile areas for future entrepreneurs, such as biotechnology, AI, cybersecurity, and climate change. Currently, Ovidiu is a Senior Technical Director, Investments, and Innovative Finance at AV Ventures/ ACDI VOCA. AV Ventures is the impact investing subsidiary of ACDI VOCA and it manages $40M in impact investing capital through its funds in Ghana, Kenya, Burkina Faso and Central Asia. Students were curious to learn how they can grow and become entrepreneurs, as well as personal questions about moving to the US. Ovidiu genuinely answered their questions and emphasized the importance of having mentors, building relationships with peers, and cultivating those relationships over time. Ovidiu's message to students was: \"Don't wait for someone else to do something about the opportunities you see around you; think about what you can do about it. Don't be afraid of failures and making mistakes. The most important thing is to be courageous and try, you may be successful or not, but you will definitely gain valuable experience.\" Heartfelt gratitude to Ovidiu for accepting our invitation and authentically sharing his journey. We are deeply honored and profoundly inspired by your story. The Entrepreneurs - Role Models for Youth project was launched at the beginning of November with the aim of promoting entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial skills by bringing 10 Romanian-American entrepreneurs into the school ecosystem. The Entrepreneurs - Role Models for Youth project has a duration of 8 months and is implemented by AllGrow with funding from the US Embassy Bucharest, Romania. #allgrow #rolemodels #entrepreneurship #education #romania"
