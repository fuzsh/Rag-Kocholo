Junot enters Portugal 19 November. 27 October 1807 Treaty of Fontainebleau signed by Charles IV of Spain and Napoleon I of France Fontainebleau Treaty The accord proposed the division of the Kingdom of Portugal and all Portuguese dominions between the signatories. 19–30 November 1807 Portugal (Invasion of) Portugal 29 November 1807 Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil The Royal Court of Portugal, headed by the Prince Regent, Prince John and his mother, Maria I of Portugal, set sail for Brazil, escorted by the British Royal Navy, led by Sir Sidney Smith and Sir Graham Moore (younger brother of Sir John Moore). 17−19 March 1808 Aranjuez (Mutiny of) Aranjuez, Madrid 19 March 1808 Abdication: Charles IV of Spain abdicates in favour of his son, Ferdinand VII[3] Aranjuez, Madrid 23 March 1808 Murat enters Madrid[3] Madrid Manoeuvre (French) In his letter to his brother Louis, dated 27 March 1808, offering him the throne of Spain, Napoleon stated that he had 100,000 troops in Spain, and that 40,000 of them had entered Madrid with Murat on 23 March 1808.[4] 24 March 1808 Ferdinand VII enters Madrid[3] Madrid Manoeuvre (French) 2 May 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising Madrid Uprising: French victory Following the fighting at the Royal Palace, rebellion spread to other parts of the city, with street fighting in different areas including heavy fighting around the Puerta del Sol, the Puerta de Toledo and at the barracks of Monteleón. Martial law was imposed on the city. Hundreds of people died in the fighting, including around 150 French soldiers. The uprising was depicted by the Spanish artist Goya in The Second of May 1808 (The Charge of the Mamelukes) and The Third of May 1808. 24 May 1808 Dupont marches from Toledo Toledo – Córdoba Manoeuvre (French) After having originally received orders from Murat to head for Cádiz, and countermanded by Napoleon, thinking that his troops might be needed in Madrid, Dupont finally leaves Toledo with 18,000 second-line troops, originally raised as provisional or reserve formations, intended either for internal police services or garrison duty. 5 June 1808 Despeñaperros Jaén, Andalusia Spanish victory (guerrillas) Two squadrons of French dragoons were attacked by insurgents at the northern entrance to the pass of Despenaperros, a steep gorge (defile) in the Sierra Morena, that separates Castile-La Mancha (including Madrid) and Andalusia, and forced to retreat to the nearby town of Almuradiel. 5 June 1808 Santa Cruz de Mudela (Uprising of) Ciudad Real, Castile-La Mancha Uprising: Spanish victory The 700 French troops stationed in the village of Santa Cruz de Mudela are attacked by the population. 109 French soldiers are killed and 113 taken prisoner, while the rest flee back in the direction of Madrid, to Valdepeñas. 6 June 1808 Porto (Uprising of) Porto (Portugal) Uprising: Spanish victory On hearing of the rebellion in Spain, Spanish General Belesta, having participated in the Invasion of Portugal, and stationed in Porto with 6,000 Spanish troops, captures the French General of Division Quesnel, and marches to Coruña to join the fight against the French troops, sparking off a series of uprisings throughout the north of Portugal. 6 June 1808 Valdepeñas (Uprising of) Ciudad Real, Castile-La Mancha Uprising: Spanish victory Following the previous day's uprising in Santa Cruz de Mudela, Ligier-Belair and Roize, at the head of some 800 troops, together with some 300 soldiers that had escaped from the Santa Cruz uprising prepare to march through the town of Valdepeñas. The population attack the leading column and Ligier-Belair sends in the dragoons, who are also forced to retreat. The resulting truce stipulates that the French troops will not pass through the village in return for a day's worth of food supplies. The guerrilla actions at Santa Cruz and Valdepeñas, together with more isolated actions in the Sierra Morena itself, effectively cut French military communications between Madrid and Andalusia for around a month. 6 June 1808 Coronation of Joseph I Madrid Napoleon's elder brother, Joseph Bonaparte, proclaimed King of Spain.[5] His reign lasted until 11 December 1813, when he abdicated and returned to France after the French defeat at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. 6 June 1808 Bruch (First battle of) Barcelona, Catalonia Spanish victory See also Bruch (Second battle of). Often grouped together as one battle, there were in fact two separate battles, separated by more than a week, with different armies and commanders involved: of the 12 French regiments that participated, only one of them fought at both battles. 7 June 1808 Alcolea Bridge (Battle of) Córdoba, Andalusia French victory At Alcolea, 10 km from Córdoba, Dupont's troops are engaged in their first battle in Andalusia against 3,000 regular troops under Pedro Agustín de Echávarri who try to protect the bridge over the Guadalquivir. The same day, Dupont captures Córdoba. 7 June 1808 Córdoba Córdoba, Andalusia French victory On their way to Seville, and ultimately to Cádiz, Dupont's 18,000 troops capture Córdoba, ransacking the city over four days. However, damaging guerrilla actions force Dupont to withdraw towards Madrid to meet up with Gobert's division, that had set out from Madrid on July 2 to reinforce Dupont. Only one brigade of this division ultimately reached Dupont, the rest being needed to hold the road north (to Madrid) against the guerrillas. 9 June 1808 – 14 June 1808 Rosily Squadron (Capture of) Cádiz, Andalusia Spanish victory 19 June 1808 Vedel marches from Toledo Toledo – La Carolina Manoeuvre (French) Vedel, with the 6,000 men, 700 horse, and 12 guns of the 2nd Division, sets out south from Toledo to force a passage over the Sierra Morena, hold the mountains from the guerrillas, and link up with Dupont, pacifying Castile-La Mancha along the way. Vedel is joined during the march by small detachments under Roize and Ligier-Belair. 26 June 1808 Puerta del Rey (mountain pass) Jaén, Andalusia French victory Vedel's column face Lieutenant-Colonel Valdecaños' detachment of Spanish regulars and guerrillas with six guns blocking the mountain pass. The following day, Vedel meets up with Dupont at La Carolina, reestablishing military communications with Madrid after a month of disruption. With the reinforcements from Vedel and Gobert, Dupont now has 20,000 men, albeit short of supplies.[6] 12 June 1808 Cabezón (Battle of) Valladolid, Castile and León French victory 14 June 1808 Bruch (Second battle of) Barcelona, Catalonia Spanish victory See also Bruch (First battle of) 15 June 1808 — 14 August 1808 Zaragoza (First siege of) Zaragoza, Aragón Spanish victory 20 and 21 June 1808 Gerona (Battle of) Girona, Catalonia Spanish victory 24 June – 26 June 1808 Valencia (Battle of) Valencia, Valencia Spanish victory 27 June 1808 Gijón: Arrival of British officers Asturias Delegation In response to the Junta General of Asturias' request to London, the Portland administration sent three British Army officers, led by a lieutenant colonel, to Gijón to assess the state of affairs. Following the Spanish victory at Bailén the following month, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Viscount Castlereagh sent a second delegation, led by General Sir James Leith, who arrived in Gijón on 30 August 1808 charged with seeing how the north of Spain could be reinforced to prevent Napoleon sending in more troops through Irun, and isolating him in Madrid or Burgos. Leith would join Baird's forces in November 1808.[7] 14 July 1808 Medina de Rioseco (Battle of) Valladolid, Castile and León French victory Also known as the Battle of Moclín, from the name of a nearby hill held by Spanish infantry. 16 July 1808 – 19 July 1808 Bailén (Battle of) Jaén, Andalusia Spanish victory (decisive) Having lost some 2,000 men on the battlefield, together with some 800 Swiss troops that had gone over to Reding's Swiss regiment, Dupont called for a truce, formally surrendered his remaining 17,600 men on 23 July. Under the terms of surrender, Dupont, Vedel and their troops were to be repatriated to France. However, with the exception of the most senior officers, most of the French rank and file were confined on hulks in Cádiz, before being transported to the uninhabited island of Cabrera, where half of the 7,000 men starved to death.[8] 24 July 1808 – 16 August 1808 Gerona (Second siege of) Girona, Catalonia Spanish victory 29 July 1808 Évora (Battle of) Alentejo (Portugal) French victory The following day, the French General Loison massacred the men, women, and children, of Évora, marking the future of the relationships between the different nations. 7 August 1808 – 11 October 1808 Evacuation of the La Romana Division Denmark–Spain by sea Manoeuvre (Spanish) Some 9,000 men stationed in Denmark, belonging to the 15,000-strong Division of the North, comprising Spanish troops commanded by Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana, defected from the armies of the First French Empire under the leadership of Marshal Bernadotte. Transported aboard British navy ships, on reaching Santander, they reinforced Blake's Army of Galicia. Entering into battle at Valmaseda, on 5 November 1808, they defeated Victor's army, only to be defeated by the same forces a few days later at the Battle of Espinosa. 17 August 1808 Roliça (Battle of) Leiria (Portugal) Anglo-Portuguese victory, tactical French retreat The first battle fought by the British army during the Peninsular War. 21 August 1808 Vimeiro (Battle of) Lisbon (Portugal) Anglo-Portuguese victory Led to the signing of the Convention of Sintra on 30 August 1808, putting an end to Napoleon's invasion of Portugal. 30 August 1808 Sintra (Convention of) Lisbon (Portugal) French troops abandon Portugal Following his victory at the Battle of Vimeiro (21 August) Sir Arthur Wellesley, against his wishes, was ordered by his immediate superiors, Sir Harry Burrard and Sir Hew Dalrymple, to sign the preliminary Armistice. The subsequent convention, agreed between Dalrymple and Kellerman, and despite the protests of the Portuguese commander, Freire,[9] allowed the evacuation of Junot's 20,900 troops from Portugal to France with all their equipment and 'personal property' (mostly loot) aboard Royal Navy ships. The public outcry in Britain led to an inquiry, held 14 November to 27 December 1808, which cleared all three British officers. Shortly after, George Woodward would caricature Wellesley in The Convention of Cintra, a Portuguese Gambol for the amusement of Iohn Bull, London, 1809[9] 31 October 1808 Pancorbo (Battle of) Biscay, Basque Country Indecisive Although a tactical victory for the French, it was considered a strategic blunder 5 November 1808 Valmaseda (Battle of) Biscay, Basque Country Spanish victory 7 November – 5 December 1808 Roses (Siege of) Girona, Catalonia French victory 10 and 11 November 1808 Espinosa (Battle of) Burgos, Castile and León French victory 23 November 1808 Tudela (Battle of) Tudela, Navarre French-Polish victory 30 November 1808 Somosierra (Battle of) Mountain pass 60 miles north of Madrid separating the provinces of Madrid and Segovia French victory Famous for the Polish light cavalry uphill charge, in columns of four, against Spanish artillery positions. The heavily outnumbered Spanish detachment of conscripts and artillery were unable to stop the Grande Armée's advance on Madrid, and Napoleon entered the capital of Spain on 4 December, a month after entering the country.[5] 4 December 1808 Napoleon enters Madrid with 80,000 troops.[10] Madrid French victory Napoleon turns his troops against Moore's British forces, who are forced to retreat back towards Galicia three weeks later and, after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, withdraw from Spain. 20 December 1808 – 20 February 1809 Zaragoza (Second siege of) Zaragoza, Aragón French victory 16 December 1808 Cardadeu (Battle of) Barcelona, Catalonia French victory 21 December 1808 Molins de Rey (Battle of) Barcelona, Catalonia French victory 21 December 1808 Sahagún (Battle of) León, Castile and León British victory 25 December 1808 Retreat to Corunna British retreat John Moore starts a 250-mile (400 km) retreat and reaches La Coruña on 14 January 30 December 1808 Mansilla (Battle of) León, Castile and León French victory 1 January 1809 Castellón (Battle of) Girona, Catalonia Spanish victory This Castellón refers to Castelló d'Empúries, in Catalonia, not the town or province in Valencia. 3 January 1809 Cacabelo (Battle of) León, Castile and León British victory 13 January 1809 Uclés (Battle of) Cuenca, Castile-La Mancha French victory 14 January 1809 Treaty between Great Britain and Spain London Treaty \"Treaty of peace, friendship, and alliance\" by which Britain recognises Fernando as King of Spain.[11] 16 January 1809 Corunna (Battle of) A Coruña, Galicia Different analyses:\n\nBritish tactical victory[12][13][14]\n\nFrench strategic victory[15][16][17]\n\nThe British troops were able complete their embarkation, but left the port cities of Corunna and Ferrol, as well as the whole of northern Spain, to be captured and occupied by the French.
