Some of our most potent ideas reach beyond reason, received wisdom, and common sense. They lurk at chthonic levels, emerging from scientifically inaccessible, rationally unfathomable recesses. Bad memories distort them. So do warped understanding, maddening experience, magical fantasies, and sheer delusion. The history of ideas is patched with crazy paving. Is there a straight way through it – a single story that allows for all the tensions and contradictions and yet makes sense? The effort to find one is worthwhile because ideas are the starting point of everything else in history. They shape the world we inhabit. Outside our control, impersonal forces set limits to what we can do: evolution, climate, heredity, chaos, the random mutations of microbes, the seismic convulsions of the Earth. But they cannot stop us reimagining our world and labouring to realize what we imagine. Ideas are more robust than anything organic. You can blast, burn, and bury thinkers, but their thoughts endure. To understand our present and unlock possible futures, we need true accounts of what we think and of how and why we think it: the cognitive processes that trigger the reimaginings we call ideas; the individuals, schools, traditions, and networks that transmit them; the external influences from culture and nature that colour, condition, and tweak them. This book is an attempt to provide such an account. It is not meant to be comprehensive. It deals only with ideas from the past that are still around today, forming and informing our world, making\n\nxii | Out of Our Minds and misleading it. By ‘ideas’ I mean thoughts that are products of imagination – exceeding experience and excelling mere anticipation. They are different from ordinary thoughts not only because they are new but because they involve seeing what has never before been seen. Those covered in this book may take the form of visions or inspiration, but are different from mental ‘trips’ – incoherent transports or ecstasies – or mental music (unless or until words are set to it) because they constitute models for changing the world. My subtitle, including ‘What We Think’, is meant seriously. Some historians will call this ‘presentism’ and deplore it, but I use it only as a principle of selection, not a lens through which to refract light from the past to fit the present. To avoid misunderstanding, I may have to say that by speaking of ‘what we think’ I do not mean to refer to all the mental occurrences or processes we call thoughts – only to the ideas from the past that we still think about: what we think in the sense of the mental armoury we have inherited for confronting enduring or new problems. ‘We’, to whom I refer, are not everyone. By using the word I mean to invoke ideas that have appealed beyond their places of origins and have been adopted by all – or nearly all – over the world, in all – or nearly all – cultures. They have dissenters as well as adherents, but you cannot dissent from an idea you have not thought about. Many, perhaps most people, are barely aware of and utterly uninterested in most of the selected ideas, which, however, are part of the background of shared wisdom or folly against which even the indifferent lead their lives. In three respects, mine is unlike any previous writer’s attempt to narrate the history of ideas. First, I include the underexplored problem of how and why we have ideas in the first place: why, by comparison with other, selectively similar animals, our imaginations bristle with so many novelties, probe so far beyond experience, and picture so many different versions of reality. I try to use revelations from cognitive science to expose the faculties that make us, among comparable species, exceptionally productive of ideas. Readers uninterested in theoretical pourparlers can skip to p. 33. Second, instead of following the usual routine and relying only on written records, I start the story in deep layers of evidence, reconstructing thoughts of our Palaeolithic ancestors and even, in the limited degree the sources permit, reaching for ideas that came out of the minds of\n\nPreface | xiii\n\ncognate or preceding species of hominins and hominids. Among revelations that will, I hope, surprise most readers are: the antiquity of much of the toolkit of ideas on which we rely; the subtlety and profundity of the thinking of early Homo sapiens; and how little we have added to the stock of ideas we inherited from the remote past. Finally, I depart from the convention of writing the history of ideas as if it were a parade of the thoughts of individual thinkers. I cannot avoid mentioning Confucius and Christ, Einstein and Epicurus, Darwin and Diogenes. But in this book, the disembodied ideas are the heroes and the villains. I try to follow their migrations in and out of the minds that conceived and received them. I do not think that ideas are autonomous. On the contrary, they do not – because they cannot – operate outside minds. But they seem intelligible to me only if we acknowledge that genius is just part of the systems that encourage them, and that circumstances, cultural contexts, and environmental constraints, as well as people, play their parts in the story. And I am interested as much in the transmission of ideas, through media that sometimes pollute and mutate them, as in their parturition – which is never immaculate. There is no one way of tracking ideas across time and cultures, because in pace, direction, and means their migrations are so various. Sometimes they spread like stains, getting fainter and shallower as they go; sometimes they creep like lice, drawing attention to themselves by irritating their hosts into awareness. Sometimes they seem to fall like leaves on a windless day, and rot for a while before they start anything new. Sometimes they get airborne, zooming in erratic swarms and alighting in unpredictable places, or they succumb to the wind and get blown where it listeth. Sometimes they behave like atomic particles, popping up simultaneously in mutually distant places in defiance of normal laws of motion. The story matches the matrix of history in general, as ideas, like cultures, multiply and diverge, pullulate and perish, exchange and reconverge, without ever – in any sustained fashion – progressing or developing or evolving, or gaining in simplicity or complexity, or fitting any other formula. In the early phases of the story, all the ideas we know about seem to be the common property of humankind, carried, unforgotten, from a single culture of origin over time and across migrants’ changing\n\nxiv | Out of Our Minds environments. Increasingly, however, for reasons I try to explore, some regions and some cultures demonstrate peculiar inventiveness. The focus of the book therefore narrows, first to privileged parts of Eurasia, later to what we conventionally call the West. Toward the end of the book, other parts of the world figure mainly as receptors of ideas most of which originate in Europe and North America. I hope no reader mistakes this for myopia or prejudice: it is just a reflection of the way things were. Similarly, the globe-wide perspective and shifting focus of earlier chapters are the results not of political correctness or cultural relativism or anti-Eurocentrism, but of the reality of a world in which cultural exchanges happened in different directions. I hope readers will notice and credit the fact that throughout the book I explore non-Western contributions to ideas and intellectual movements commonly or properly regarded as Western in origin. I do so not for the sake of political correctness but in deference to the truth. Even in the long passages that focus on the West, the book is not primarily about Western ideas but about those that, wherever they originated, have spread so widely as to become fully intelligible, for good and ill, only as part of the intellectual heritage of humankind. Equally, obviously, most of the thinkers I mention were male, because the book is about one of the many areas of human endeavour in which one sex has been disproportionately preponderant. I hope and expect that historians of twenty-first-century ideas, when they get round to the subject with the benefits of hindsight, will properly be able to mention a lot of women. In each chapter, I try to keep commonly conceived categories distinct, dealing separately with political and moral thinking, epistemology and science, religion and suprarational or subrational notions. In most contexts, the distinctions are, at best, only partly valid. Respecting them is a strategy of convenience and I have tried to make the interchanges, overlaps, and blurred edges apparent at every stage. Compression and selection are necessary evils. Selection always leaves some readers fuming at the omission of whatever seems more important to them than to the author: I ask their indulgence. The ideas I identify and select will, at least at the margins, be different from those other historians might want to put into a book of this kind were they to try to write one: I rely on every writer’s prerogative – which is not to have to write other writers’ books for them. Compression is in some\n\nPreface | xv\n\nways a self-defeating device, because the swifter the pace of a book, the more slowly readers must go to take in all of it. But it seems better to engage readers’ time with concision than waste it with dilatation. I should make one further principle of selection clear: this book is about ideas, understood as merely mental events (or perhaps cerebral ones – though for reasons that will become clear I prefer not to use the term and wish to retain, at least provisionally, a distinction between mind and brain). Though I try to say something about why each idea is important, readers mainly interested in the technologies that ideas trigger or the movements they inspire need to look elsewhere. The pages that follow garner a lot of work dispersed over many years: from various books I have written, dozens of articles in different journals or collaborative works, and scores of papers and lectures delivered at assorted academic venues. Because I have devoted a lot of attention in the past to environmental history and the history of material culture, it may look as if I have switched to a new approach, via the mind. But minds mediated or originated almost all the evidence we have about the human past. Mental behaviours shape our physical actions. Culture starts in the mind and takes shape when minds meet, in the learning and examples that transmit it across generations. I have always thought that ideas are literally primordial, and occasionally I have foregrounded them, especially in Truth: A History (1997), an attempt at a typology of techniques various cultures have relied on to tell truth from falsehood; Ideas (2003), a collection of very brief essays, of between 300 and 500 words each, in which I tried to isolate some important notions – 182 of them, almost all of which reappear in various ways in the present book; and A Foot in the River (2015), a comparison of biological and cultural explanations of cultural change. Though some readers of Civilizations (2001), in which I approached global history through biomes instead of using countries or communities or regions or civilizations as units of study, and of The World: A History (2007) have told me I am a materialist, ideas hover and swerve through those books, too, stirring the mixture, impelling events. Here, I put what I know of the history of ideas together in an unprecedented way, weaving strands into a global narrative, and threading among them mental events I have never touched before. The publisher’s editors – Sam Carter, Jonathan Bentley-Smith, and Kathleen McCully – have helped a lot, as did four\n\nxvi | Out of Our Minds anonymous academic readers. At every stage, I have gathered advice and useful reactions from too many people to mention – especially from the undergraduates who over the last few years have followed my courses on the history of ideas at the University of Notre Dame, and have worked so hard to put me right. In combining the results, I benefited uniquely from Will Murphy’s suggestions. ‘I want you’, he said, ‘to write a history of the human imagination.’ That still seems an unimaginably big imagination for me to picture. If such a history is possible, what follows is or includes a small contribution toward it. Felipe Fernández-Armesto Notre Dame, IN, All Saints’ Day, 2017\n\nChapter 1 Mind Out of Matter The Mainspring of Ideas\n\nI\n\nfeel guilty, now that he is dead, because I could never bring myself to like him. Edgar was a senior colleague, to whom, when I was young, I had to defer. He had become a professor when universities were expanding unrestrainedly and jobs multiplied faster than the talent to fill them: competence rather than excellence and indifference rather than vocation were enough. Edgar concealed his inferiority behind complacency and self-congratulation. He bullied his students and patronized his peers. One of the ways in which he enjoyed annoying me was by deprecating my beloved dog. ‘Imagine’, he would say, ‘how little goes on in that pea-sized brain – incapable of thought, just responding to nasty little stimuli from the scent of mouldering scraps and whiffs of other dogs’ urine.’ ‘You can see how unintelligent he is’, Edgar added, whenever the dog disobliged him by ignoring his commands. Secretly and silently, I suspected that Edgar comforted himself by comparison with the dog only because his own mind would be wanting by any other standard. Gradually, however, I came to realize that his attitude reflected common prejudices and fallacies about the way we think. We humans tend to class ourselves as more intelligent than other species, even though the intelligences in question are of such different orders as to make any comparison largely meaningless: it would be no more intelligent, in a dog, to waste time devising an algorithm than for a human to sniff for a mate. We mistake for dumbness what is really dissent from or incomprehension of our priorities. My disappointment at\n\n2 | Out of Our Minds my dog’s unresponsiveness to my efforts to make him fetch for me, for instance, is, from his perspective, no more puzzling than my neglect of old bones or my inability to detect an interesting spoor. We call animals intelligent when they do our bidding, whereas if we encountered the same subservience in fellow humans we should despise it as evidence of lack of initiative or critical thought. The matter is beyond proof, but a lifetime’s observation of my own family’s dogs has convinced me that they discriminate between commands on rational calculations of interest. Ivan Pavlov thought canine behaviour was conditioned – which, like rare instances of human behaviour, it sometimes is; but dogs defy expectations when they try to solve doggy problems, rather than humanly designed puzzles: problems, that is, conceived not to interest us but to involve them. I once saw my dog, for instance, devise a new squirrel-catching strategy, after many unsuccessful experiments, by stationing himself at right angles to the path between two trees at a point equidistant from both. The plan did not yield a squirrel, but it was, by any standards, intelligently thought out. In his own way, for his own purposes, as two of the most dedicated researchers on canine intelligence say, ‘Your dog is a genius.’1 René Descartes decided that his dog had no more thought or feeling than a machine (and supposedly concluded that he could punish him without moral qualms);2 the dog, I suspect, recognized Descartes, by contrast, as a sentient, ratiocinative fellow-being. If so, which of the two showed more common sense or practical wisdom? As with intelligence, most other ways of trying to measure humans’ distance from other animals in capacities we share with them are doomed to failure. The claim that we have a special property of consciousness remains just a claim, because there is no satisfactory way of seeing that deeply into other creatures’ minds. To know that humans are uniquely sensitive or empathetic, or existentially intuitive, or aware of time, or gifted by God or nature with a peculiar, privileged faculty – such as a ‘language acquisition device’,3 or an aesthetic tic, or a moral sense, or a discriminating power of judgement, or an eternally redeemable rational soul, or a meta-mental level of thinking about thinking, or an unparalleled skill in inference capable of deducing universals from instances, or any of the other supposed possessions that humans congratulate themselves on collectively monopolizing – we would need\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 3\n\nto be able to talk it over with fellow-creatures in other species, or else craft objective tests that have so far eluded our efforts. All that observation and experiment can guarantee, so far, is that humans’ endowment of creative and imaginative mental properties that we share with other animals is palpably, visibly, stunningly enormous. It is proper to ask why and how the divergences in quantity arise, whether or not one suspects differences in quality, too. This book is about what I think is the most conspicuous such divergence. Humans do exceed dogs and, as far as we know, all other animals, in ability of a peculiar and, to us, exciting and rewarding kind: the power to grasp (and even in some abnormally ingenious humans to generate) the imagined acts (or products of such acts) that we call ideas. The creativity gap between human animals and the rest is vastly greater than that in, say, tool use or self-awareness or theory of mind or effectiveness in communication. Only a human – I want to say – can imagine a canine Bach or a simian Poe or a ‘literally’ reptilian Plato or a cetacean Dostoevsky who insists that two times two might be five.4 I am not fully authorized to say so, because a chimp or a dog or a bacillus may secretly harbour such imaginings; but if so, he or it does nothing about it, whereas humans declare their fantasies and project them onto the world, sometimes with revolutionary effects. With peculiar frequency and intensity, we can picture the world to ourselves differently from the way it looks, or responds to our senses. When that happens, we have an idea, as I understand the word. The results of this capacity are startling, because we often go on to refashion the world in whatever way we have pictured it. Therefore we innovate more than any other species; we devise more ways of life, more diversity of culture, more tools and techniques, more arts and crafts, and more outright lies than other animals. A human can hear a note and compose a symphony; see a stick and turn it mentally into a missile; survey a landscape and envision a city; taste bread and wine and sense the presence of God; count and leap to infinity and eternity; endure frustration and conceive perfection; look at his chains and fancy himself free. We do not see similar outcomes from fancies other animals may have. Anyone who wants to apply the words ‘intelligence’ or ‘reason’ to the faculty that enables ideas can, of course, do so. But the word that best\n\n4 | Out of Our Minds denotes it is surely ‘imagination’ or perhaps ‘creativity’. The degree to which humans are, as far as we know, uniquely creative seems vast by comparison with any of the other ways in which we have traditionally been said to excel other animals.5 So the first questions for a history of ideas are, ‘Where does active, powerful, teeming imagination come from?’ and, ‘Why are humans peculiarly imaginative animals?’ The questions have been strangely neglected, perhaps in part because of an unsatisfactory assumption: that imagination is just a cumulative product of intensive thinking and needs no special explanation (see p. 10). The nearest thing in the available literature to an evolutionary account of the origins of imagination credits sexual selection: imaginative behaviour, so goes the theory, is conspicuous exhibitionism, likely to attract mates – the human equivalent of unfolding a peacock’s tail.6 At most, the theory locates imagination in a class of evolved faculties, but fails to account for it: if imagination belongs among the results of sexual selection it occupies a pretty lowly place, compared with physical attractions and practical considerations. If only mental musculature were sexier than a six-pack, or a poet more recommendable as a mate than a plumber! I recall a story about one of Henry Kissinger’s mistresses who reportedly said, when her sexual taste was questioned, ‘Why have a body that can stop a tank when you can have a brain that can stop a war?’ I make no comment on her judgement, her sincerity, or her representative value. Neuroscientists, who like to make their own peacock-displays of brain scans, associating thoughts of every kind with neuronal activity, have not been able to trap a creature at a moment of especially imaginative thinking. In any case, brain scanning has limited powers of explanation: electrical and chemical changes in the brain show that mental events are happening, but are at least as likely to be effects as causes.7 I do not mean that neurological evidence is contemptible: it helps us know when memory, for instance, is active, and helps us track constituents or ingredients of imagination at work. At present, however, no scientific narrative recounts satisfactorily how humans became imaginatively supercharged. If we want to understand how humans generate the ideas that are the subject of this book, one good way of starting is by comparing our relevant resources with those of other animals: it can be no more than\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 5\n\na starting point because humans are at least as different from all other animals as every non-human species is from all the others. But, in the absence of angels and extra-terrestrials, the creatures with whom we share the planet are our obvious subjects. Our usual assumptions about the relative excellence of humans’ equipment are not entirely false, but the comparison, as we shall see, is less to our advantage than we commonly suppose. For present purposes I focus on the brain, not because I think mind and brain are synonymous or coterminous but because the brain is the organ in which our bodies register thoughts. Ideas may exist outside the material universe, but we have to look at the brain for evidence that we have them. As we study the evidence, a paradox will emerge: some of our relative deficiencies of brainpower contribute to making us richly imaginative, and therefore abundantly productive of ideas. Evolution is an inescapable part of the background. Ideas, as far as we can tell at present, are probably psychic, not organic or material. Except for people who believe in ‘memes’ (the ‘units of culture’ Richard Dawkins dreamed up to behave like genes)8 ideas are not themselves subject to evolutionary laws. But they work with our bodies: our brains process and manage them, our limbs and digits and muscles and speech organs apply and communicate them. Everything we do with our thoughts, and a fortiori with ideas, which are thoughts of a special kind or special order, has to deploy the equipment that evolution has given us. In the pages that follow I intend to argue that evolution has endowed us with superabundant powers of anticipation, and relatively feeble memories; that imagination issues from the collision of those two faculties; that our fertility in producing ideas is a consequence; and that our ideas, in turn, are the sources of our mutable, volatile history as a species.9\n\nBig Brains, Big Thoughts? One of Edgar’s widely shared fallacies was his conviction that the bigger your brain, the better you think.10 I once read that Turgenev had an almost uniquely big brain, whereas Anatole France had an almost\n\n6 | Out of Our Minds uniquely small one. I no longer recall where I learned this and have no means of verifying it, but se non è vero è ben trovato: both writers were great geniuses. Women have bigger brains, on average and relative to body size, than men; Neanderthals had bigger brains than Homo sapiens; Palaeolithic people exceeded moderns in the dimensions of their brains. Will anyone aver that these differences correspond to differences in power of thought? A few years ago, on the island of Flores in Indonesia, archaeologists discovered the remains of a creature with a brain smaller than a chimpanzee’s, but with a toolkit comparable to what one might expect to find in excavations of our own ancestors of about forty thousand years ago, whose brains were, on average, bigger than ours. Big brains are not necessary to big thoughts:11 a microchip is big enough to do most of what most people’s brains can achieve. Human brains are almost as much of an encumbrance as an amenity: to emulate the microchip they need more nourishment, process more blood, and use up a lot more energy than is necessary. As far as we know, most brain cells are dormant for most of the time. Neuroscientists have speculated about the purpose of the apparently inert astrocytes that vastly outnumber the measurably functional neurons – but no consensus has emerged on what most brain-volume is for or whether it is for anything at all.12 The size of human brains is not, therefore, a necessary condition for human-style thinking, but is probably what evolutionary jargon calls a ‘spandrel’ – a by-product of the evolution of the faculties that equip us to think.13 Most of the human brain, to put it bluntly, is probably functionless junk, like tonsils and appendixes. To say that it would not be there unless it were useful – only we do not know how – is obviously fallacious or else an expression of over-confidence in the efficiency of evolution,14 which, as Darwin acknowledged, perhaps in an unguarded moment, is no more consistently targeted than the wind.15 It is not hard to see how humans’ brains might have become bigger than they would be if a conscious and competent designer were at work. Diet conditions brain growth: fruit is more nourishing and more demanding for foragers than leaves, and meat more so than fruit. As the most omnivorous of apes, our ancestors needed and nourished the biggest brains.16 Or they may have added brain cells in order to live in\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 7\n\nlarger groups than most other creatures. The bigger your group, the more data you have to handle; rather than starting over and designing a brain fit for purpose, nature grows the brain you already have, stuffing your skull with cortex, multiplying folds and caruncles, extruding lobules. That is perhaps why brain size among apes (though not primates generally) is roughly proportionate to group size.17 Advantages accrue: in consequence, more neurons can interact in our brains than in those of other species; but more efficient compression could contrive the same effect. By other animals’ standards, we have brains with a lot more room for thought; but all the functions we can identify – by seeing, for instance, what people can no longer do if parts of their brains fail or are excised – are part of the equipment of various species. Brain size, in short, helps explain why we do more thinking than other apes, but not why we do thinking of a different order.\n\nThe Galactic Overview Instead, therefore, of complimenting ourselves for our big brains, or congratulating ourselves on the superiority of human intelligence, it may be helpful to focus on the exact cerebral functions or instances of intelligent behaviour in which our species seems peculiarly well endowed or most adept. We have to face an immediate difficulty: most humans do not do much thinking. ‘Oh’, they implicitly echo Keats, ‘for a life of sensation, not of thought!’ Usually, humans’ brains are seriously under-employed. Most of us leave others to do our thinking for us and never have thoughts beyond those that outsiders have put into our heads: hence the success of advertising and propaganda. Imitation, repetition, and follow-theleader may, by some standards, be classed as intelligent behaviour. Why not obey the tyrant who feeds you? Why not ape those apparently wiser or stronger than yourself? For limited purposes, such as survival in a hostile environment, or ease in more amenable circumstances, these may be well-chosen strategies. But domesticated non-humans show plenty of intelligence of that kind – the fawning hound, the submissive sheep. If we want to identify uniquely human thinking we have to focus on the large minority of humans who do a lot of it: those who\n\n8 | Out of Our Minds are responsible for the big, conspicuous differences between our lives and those of other creatures. To understand what those differences are, we need to shift perspective. Difference-spotting is almost entirely a matter of perspective. If, for example, I ask members of one of my classes at the University of Notre Dame to identify the differences between classmates, they will point to small and often trivial details: Maura has more freckles than Elizabeth; Billy always wears long sleeves, whereas Armand is always in a T-shirt. Xiaoxing is a year younger than everyone else. An outsider, looking at the class with a degree of objectivity unattainable from the inside, will see the big picture and approach the question impersonally, looking for classifiable differences. ‘Forty per cent are male’, he or she will say, ‘and the rest female. Most of your students are white, but three have features that look East Asian, two look as if they have South Asian origin, and two are black. The roster seems to have a surprisingly large number of names of Irish origin’, and so on. Both perspectives yield true observations, but for present purposes we want data of the kind more easily visible to the outsider. To spot the big peculiarities of human thinking, compared with that of other animals, we have to try for a similar degree of objectivity. A thought experiment will help. If I try to envisage the most objective standpoint accessible to my mind, I come up with a sort of cosmic crow’s nest, where a lookout with godlike powers of vision can see the entire planet, and the whole history of every species on it, in a single glance, from an immense distance of time and space, like the onlooker who, in The Aleph, a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, perceived all the events of every creature’s past simultaneously. How would such a privileged observer assess the difference between us and other animals? The cosmic lookout, I suspect, would say, ‘Basically you’re all the same – inefficient, short-lived arrangements of cells. But I notice some odd things about you humans. You do most of what all the other species do, but you do a lot more of it. As far as I can tell, you have more thoughts, tackle more tasks, penetrate more places, adopt more foods, and elaborate more political and social forms, with more stratification, more specialization, and more economic activities. You develop more lifeways, more rites, more technologies, more buildings, more aesthetic fancies, more modifications of the environment, more\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 9\n\nconsumption and production, more arts and crafts, more means of communication; you devise more culture, and – in short – turn over more ideas with more speed and variety than any other creature I can see. As far as I can tell, you put more time and effort than other animals into self-contemplation, the identification of values, the attempt to generalize or analyse; you devote vast mental resources to telling stories previously untold, composing images of what no one ever saw, and making music no ear ever heard before. By comparison with most of your competitor-species you are torpid, weak, tailless, deficient in prowess, and poorly fitted with fangs and claws (though you are, luckily, good at throwing missiles and have agile hands). Yet, despite your ill-endowed, ill-shaped bodies, your capacity for responding to problems, exceeding minimal solutions, and rethinking your futures has given you a surprising degree of mastery on your planet.’ These observations might not make the lookout admire us. He or she would notice the uniqueness of every species and might not think ours was of an order superior to all the others’. But though we may not be unique in being innovative and creative (that would be another self-congratulatory claim, belied by evidence), our power to innovate and create seems unique in range and depth and abundance. In these respects, the differences between humans and non-humans carry us beyond culture, of which, as we shall see, many species are capable, to the uniquely human practice we call civilization, in which we reshape the world to suit ourselves.18\n\nBecoming Imaginative How could our brains have helped us to this improbable, unparalleled destination? The brain, like every evolved organ, is the way it is because conditions in the environment have favoured the survival and transmission of some genetic mutations over others. Its function is to respond to the world outside it – to solve the practical problems the world poses, to meet the exigencies it demands, to cope with the traps it lays and the constraints it tangles. The repertoire of thoughts that belongs in this book is of another kind, a different order. They constitute the sort of creativity enchantingly called ‘fantasia’ in Italian,\n\n10 | Out of Our Minds with resonances of fantasy that exceed what is real. They create worlds other than the ones we inhabit: worlds unverifiable outside our minds and unrealized in existing experience (such as refashioned futures and virtual pasts), or unrealizable (such as eternity or heaven or hell) with resources that we know, from experience or observation, that we command. V. S. Ramachandran, a neurologist who has hunted valiantly for differences between humans and other apes, puts it like this: ‘How can a three-pound mass of jelly … imagine angels, contemplate the meaning of infinity, and even question its own place in the cosmos?’19 There are two traditional answers: one popular in scientific tradition, the other in metaphysics. The strictly scientific answer is that quantity becomes quality when a critical threshold is crossed: humans’ brains, according to this line of thinking, are so much bigger than those of other apes that they become different in kind. It is not necessary for the brain to have a specialized function for creativity or for the generation of ideas: those events ensue from the sheer abundance of thinking of more mundane kinds that emanates from big brains. On the other hand, the metaphysical answer is to say that creativity is a function of an immaterial faculty, commonly called a mind or a rational soul, which is unique to humans, or of which humans possess a unique kind. Either answer, though not both, may be true. But neither seems plausible to everyone. To accept the first, we need to be able to identify the threshold beyond which brains leap from responsiveness to creativity. To accept the second, we have to be metaphysically inclined. Mind, according to sceptics, is just a fancy word for functions of the brain that neurology cannot quite pin down in the present state of knowledge. So how can we improve on the traditional answers? I propose reformulating the question to make it less vague, specifying the exact thought-generating function we want to explain. The term that best denotes what is special about human thinking is probably ‘imagination’ – which covers fantasia, innovation, creativity, re-crafting old thoughts, having new ones, and all the fruits of inspiration and ecstasy. Imagination is a big, daunting word, but it corresponds to an easily grasped reality: the power of seeing what is not there. Historians, like me, for instance, have to reconfigure in imagination a vanished past. Visionaries who found religions must bring to mind\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 11\n\nunseen worlds. Storytellers must exceed experience to recount what never really happened. Painters and sculptors must, as Shakespeare said, ‘surpass the life’ and even photographers must capture unglimpsed perspectives or rearrange reality if they are going to produce art rather than record. Analysts must abstract conclusions otherwise invisible in the data. Inventors and entrepreneurs must think ahead beyond the world they inhabit to one they can remake. Statesmen and reformers must rethink possible futures and devise ways to realize better ones and forestall worse. At the heart of every idea worth the name is an act of imagination – experience excelled or transcended, reality reprocessed to generate something more than a snapshot or echo. So what makes humans super-imaginative? Three faculties, I suggest, are the constituents of imagination. Two are unmistakably products of evolution. On the third, the jury is out. First comes memory – one of the mental faculties we call on for inventiveness, starting, whenever we think or make something new, with what we remember of whatever we thought or made before. Most of us want our memories to be good – accurate, faithful to a real past, reliable as foundations for the future. But surprisingly, perhaps, bad memory turns out to be what helps most in the making of imagination.\n\nRemembering Wrongly Unsurprisingly, in most tests of how human thinking compares with that of other animals, humans score highly: after all, we devise the tests. Humans are relatively good at thinking about more than one thing at a time, divining what other creatures might be thinking about, and handling large repertoires of humanly selected symbols.20 Memory, however, is one of the kinds of thinking at which, even by human standards, other animals can rival or outstrip us. Remembering information of relevant kinds is one of the most striking faculties in which non-humans can excel. Beau, my dog, beats me – metaphorically, not in the sense Descartes envisaged – in retaining memories of people and routes. He can reconstruct, unbidden, any walk he has ever been on. After six years without seeing an old friend of mine, he recognized her on her next visit, rushing off to present her with a toy that she had\n\n12 | Out of Our Minds given him on the previous occasion. Beau makes me willing to believe Homer’s story of how only the family dog recognized Odysseus when the hero returned from his wanderings. He retrieves toys or bones unerringly, while I waste my time seeking misfiled notes and errant reading glasses. Anyone who has a pet or a non-human work-partner can match stories of their enviable powers of memory. Yet most people still echo Robert Burns’s pitying address to his ‘wee, sleekit, cow’rin’, tim’rous’ mouse, whom, he thought, ‘the present only toucheth’, as if the little beast were frozen in time and isolated from past and future.21 But this sort of distinction between brutish and human memory is probably another example of unjustified human self-congratulation. We do not have to rely on anecdotal stories of dogs of suspected shagginess. Controlled studies confirm that in some respects our memories are feeble by other animals’ standards. Scrub-jays, for instance, know what food they hide and remember where and when they hide it. Even without food-inducements, rats retrace routes in complex labyrinths, whereas I get muddled in the simplest garden mazes. They recall the order in which they encounter smells. Clearly, therefore, they pass tests of what specialists call episodic memory: the supposedly human prerogative of travelling back, as it were, in time by recalling experiences in sequence.22 Clive Wynne, the apostle of non-human minds, whose fame is founded on the vividness with which he can imagine what it would be like to be a bat, has summarized some relevant experiments. Pigeons, he points out, retain for months, without degradation, memories of hundreds of arbitrary visual patterns associable with food. They home in on their own lofts after long absences. Bees recall the whereabouts of food, and how to find it in a maze. Chimpanzees retrieve from apparently casually selected locations the stones they use as anvils for cracking nuts. In laboratories, challenged to perform for rewards, they remember the correct order in which to press keys on a computer screen or keyboard. And ‘vampire bats can remember who has given them a blood donation in the past and use that information in deciding whether to respond to a petitioner who is begging for a little blood’.23 Belittlers of non-human memory can insist that many non-human animals’ responses are no better, as evidence of thinking, than the\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 13\n\nfawning and cowering of Pavlov’s dogs, who, back in the 1890s, started to salivate when they saw their feeder, not – according to the theory that became notorious as ‘behaviourism’ – because they remembered him but because the sight of him triggered psychic associations. The apparent memory feats of rats, bats, pigeons, and apes – any surviving behaviourist might claim – more resemble conditioned reflexes or reactions to stimuli than recollections retrieved from a permanent store. Apart from prejudice, we have no good grounds for making such a distinction. St Augustine, whom I revere as, in most other respects, a model of clear thinking, was a behaviourist avant la lettre. He thought that a horse could retrieve a path when he was following it, as each step triggered the next, but could not recall it back in his stable. Even the saint, however, cannot have been sure about that. No experiment can verify the assumption. Augustine’s only basis for making it was a religious conviction: that God would hardly condescend to give horses minds resembling those of His chosen species. Equally dogmatic successors today make a similar mistake. Most psychologists have stopped believing that human behaviour can be controlled by conditioning: why retain the same discredited belief in trying to understand other animals? For material directly comparable with human experience we can turn to experiments with chimpanzees and gorillas. They resemble us in relevant ways. We can access their own accounts of their behaviour. We can converse with them – within the limited sphere our common interests permit – in humanly devised language. They do not have mouths and throats formed to make the same range of sounds that figure in humans’ spoken languages but non-human apes are remarkably good at learning to use symbolic systems – that is, languages – of other kinds. By following examples and heeding instruction, just as human learners do or should do if they are good students, apes can deploy many of the manual signs and representative letters or images that humans use. Panzee, for example, is an exceptionally dexterous symbol-juggling female chimpanzee at Georgia State University. She communicates with her carers via cards, which she brandishes, and keyboards, which she taps to access particular signs. In a typical experiment, while Panzee watched, researchers hid dozens of succulent fruits, toy snakes, balloons, and paper shapes. Without prompting, except by being shown\n\n14 | Out of Our Minds the symbol for each object in turn, Panzee remembered where the little treasures were and could guide keepers to them. Even after relatively long intervals of up to sixteen hours she recalled the locations of more than ninety per cent. No ‘cheating’ was involved. Panzee had never had to obtain food by pointing to places outside her enclosure before. Her keepers could provide no help, conscious or unconscious, because they were not privy in advance to any information about the hiding-places. Panzee, therefore, did more than show that chimps have an instinct for finding food in the wild: she made it clear that they – or at least she – can remember unique events. As well as displaying what we might call retrospective prowess, she displays a kind of prospective skill, applying her memory to advantage in predicting the future by foreseeing where food will be found.24 In another intriguing experiment, using her keyboard, she guided a carer to the whereabouts of concealed objects – peanuts, for preference, but including non-comestible items in which she had no active interest. The head of her lab, Charles Menzel, says, ‘Animal memory systems have always been underestimated – the upper limits are not really known.’25 Among Panzee’s rival rememberers is Ayuma, a quick-witted chimpanzee in a research facility in Kyoto. She became famous in 2008 as the star of a TV show, beating human contestants in a computerized memory game. Participants had to memorize numerals that appeared on a screen for a tiny fraction of a second. Ayuma recalled eighty per cent accurately. Her nine human rivals all scored zero.26 With practice humans can ape Ayuma.27 Evidence in chimpanzees’ favour, however, has continued to accumulate. If one discounts uncharacteristic prodigies, typical humans can remember sequences of seven numbers; other apes can remember more and can learn them faster. Ape Memory is a video game for members of our species who want to try to reach simian levels of excellence. King, a gorilla resident of Monkey Jungle, Miami, Florida, inspired a version called Gorilla Memory. King is good at counting. He communicates with humans by waving and pointing to icons printed on cards. When primatologists picked on him for memory tests he was thirty years old – too well stricken with maturity, one might think, to be receptive in learning new tricks. But he knew human peculiarities from long experience. He showed that he could master past events in time, arraying them in order. With a\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 15\n\nlevel of performance significantly well above chance, he could recall each of three foods and could reverse, when asked to do so, the order in which he ate them.28 He can connect individuals with foods they have given him, even when his keepers have forgotten who provided which treat, just as my dog can associate, in memory, his toys with the benefactors who bestowed them. Both King and Beau would, on these showings, make far better witnesses than most humans at a criminal identity parade. A team tested King by performing acts that were new to him, including physical jerks and charades – pretending to steal a phone, or playing ‘air guitar’. When they asked King who had done which performance, he got the answer right sixty per cent of the time. The score may seem modest – but try getting humans to emulate it.29 Chimps can locate memories in time, arrange them in order, and use them to make predictions. The work of Gema Martin-Ordas at Leipzig Zoo stands out among experiments that have challenged claims that such faculties are uniquely human. In 2009, eight chimpanzees and four orang-utans watched her use a long stick to reach a banana. She then hid the stick and another, too short for the job, in different locations for the apes to find. Three years later, with no promptings in the interval, the sticks returned to their former places. A banana was suitably installed, too. Would the apes be able to get at it? All the participants, except for one orang-utan, recalled the location of the right stick without effort. Other apes, who had not taken part in the previous exercise, were unable to do so. To capture memories and store them for future use, therefore, is part of the cognitive equipment humans share with other apes.30 A more sophisticated experiment designed by psychologist Colin Camerer and primatologist Tetsuro Matsuzawa tested chimps’ and humans’ ability to project predictions from remembered events. Subjects from both species played a game in which they observed other individuals’ moves on a touch screen and then had an opportunity to win rewards by predicting what they would choose next. Chimps proved, on average, better at detecting the patterns than their human rivals, apparently because they could remember longer sequences of moves. The game tests for superior memory and strategic capability: how well the players recall opponent’s selections; how well they detect patterns in choice-making; how cleverly they make their own\n\n16 | Out of Our Minds predictions. The results suggest that some chimps, at least, excel some humans in these skills.31 So Edgar was wrong, in the present connection, to belittle nonhuman intellects. I do not mean to suggest that human memories are incapable of prodigious feats. Preachers, performers, and examinees can often parade stupendous amounts of data. Vaudeville acts formerly hauled vast chains of facts before audiences, like Mr Memory in Hitchcock’s version of The Thirty-Nine Steps. There are idiot-savants who can reel off the contents of the telephone directory. In some comparable functions, however, where memory is in play, non-human animals outclass us. Most people recoil when you tell them that human memories are not the best on our planet, but it is worth pausing to think about this counterintuitive notion. Humans have almost always assumed that any faculty that might justify us in classifying ourselves apart from other beasts must be a superior faculty. But maybe we should have been looking at what is inferior – at least, inferior in some respects – in us. Memory is not in every respect humans’ most glorious gift, compared with that of other animals. Poverty, unreliability, deficiency, and distortions corrode it. We may not like to acknowledge the fact, because it is always hard to forfeit self-regard. We prize our memories and take pride in them because they seem so precious for our sense of self – something we are only just beginning to concede to other animals. Literature – psychological, forensic, imaginative – is full of evidence of the weakness of most humans’ recollections. Perhaps the most effective way of summoning up a sense of how badly memory works is to look at one of Salvador Dalí’s most famous paintings – a bleak landscape scattered with disturbing, misshapen objects. He called the painting The Persistence of Memory but that is one of the artist’s characteristic ironies: the real subject is how memory fades and warps. In the background is a westering sky, where the light is in retreat, over an indistinct sea, in which every feature seems to dissolve. Then comes a crumbling cliff, as if eroded, like memory, by the passage of time, and a blank slate, from which every impression has been erased. A dead, truncated tree, from which all life has withered, juts into the middle ground, over an almost traceless shore. Huge chronometers, stopped at different moments, sag and wilt, as if to proclaim the mutability\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 17\n\ntime inflicts, the contradictions it unwinds. Bugs seem to eat away at the casing of another watch in the foreground, while in the centre of the composition a monstrous, menacing shape seems to have been transferred from some evil fantasy by Hieronymus Bosch. Memories do turn into monsters. Time does subvert recall. Recollections decay. The inefficiencies of human memory bridge the difference between memory and imagination. The difference is not, in any case, very great. Memory, like imagination, is a faculty of seeing something that is not present to our senses. If imagination is, as defined above, the power to see what is not really there, memory enables us to see what is there no longer: it is, in a sense, a specialized form of imagination. Memory works by forming representations of facts and events – which is also what imagination does. Mnemotechnics, the ancient ‘art of memory’ that Cicero used to deliver speeches in the Roman courts and senate, assigns a vivid image – which may not be a naturally suggestive symbol – to each point the speaker wants to make. A bloody hand might stand for a humdrum point of procedure, a lovely rose or a luscious fruit for the deplorable vices of the speaker’s opponent.32 Observations of how the brain works confirm the contiguity of memory and imagination: as far as we can tell, both ‘happen’ in overlapping areas. Almost identical electrical and chemical activity goes on in the brain when imagination and memory are at work. Memory and imagination overlap. But some philosophers are reluctant to acknowledge that fact.33 I blame Aristotle. He insisted, with his usual common sense, that memories must refer to the past – and the past, he pointed out, was fundamentally unlike imaginary events because it really happened. Sometimes, however, life traduces common sense. In practice, memories and imaginings fuse. But memories are closest to imaginings when they are false. Their creative power consists in distorting recollections. Misremembering recasts reality as fantasy, experience as speculation. Every time we misremember something old, we are imagining something new. We mingle and mangle the past with features it never really had. Life would be unbearable otherwise. Daniel Schacter, the Harvard cognitive scientist who monitors what happens in the brain when memories are registered and retrieved, points out that evolution has given us bad\n\n18 | Out of Our Minds memories to spare us from the burden of cluttering our minds. We have to make space in the lumber room, discarding relatively unimportant data to focus on what we really need.34 Women who remember faithfully the real pain of childbirth will be reluctant to repeat it. Socialites and networkers have to filter the names and faces of people they do not need. Soldiers would never return to the trenches, unless they suppressed or romanticized the horrors of war. Old men remember their feats – according to Shakespeare – ‘with advantages’. To these self-interested modifications of memory, we add outright errors. We mistake our imaginatively transformed recollections for literal copies of the events we recall. The memories we think we ‘recover’ in hypnosis or psychotherapy can really be fantasies or distortions, but they have life-changing power for good and ill. We can live with the quicksilver slips and slidings of our individual memories; but when we share and record them in enduring forms, the outcome is social memory: a received version of the past, which can reach back to times no individual can claim to remember. The same vices raddle it: self-interest, rose-tinting, and sins of transmission. Propaganda engraves falsehood on pedestals, copies it into textbooks, slaps it onto billboards, and insinuates it into ritual. In consequence, social memory is often unresponsive to facts or intractable to historical revision. If psychologists can detect false memory syndrome in individuals, historians can disclose it in entire societies. Workers in jurisprudence may want to demur. The similarity of memory and imagination subverts the value of legal testimony. For law courts, it would be convenient to divide fanciful versions from real accounts. We know, however, that witness statements rarely tally in practice. The most widely cited text is fictional but true to life: In a Grove, a short story from 1922 by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, inspired one of the great works of cinema, Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon. Witnesses to a murder give mutually contradictory evidence; a shaman releases the testimony of the victim’s ghost. But the reader – or the audience of the movie version – remains unconvinced. Every trial, every comparison of testimony, confirms the unreliability of memory. ‘You were all in gold’, sings a reminiscent, ageing lover in the stage-musical version of Gigi. The lady corrects him: ‘I was dressed in blue.’ ‘Oh yes’, is his\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 19\n\nrejoinder. ‘I remember it well.’ In our various ways, we all remember equally badly. Poorly functioning memory helps to make humans outstandingly imaginative. Every false memory is a glimpse of a possible new future that, if we so choose, we can try to fashion for ourselves.\n\nAnticipating Accurately The distortions of memory enlarge imagination but do not wholly account for it. We also need what the biomedical researcher Robert Arp calls ‘scenario visualization’: a fancy name for what one might more simply call practical imagination. Arp links it with a psychological adaptation that might have arisen – uniquely, he thinks – among our hominin ancestors in the course of making complicated tools, such as spear-throwing devices for hunting.35 Among surviving species, no other creature has a mind’s eye powerful enough to transform a stick into a javelin, and then, by a further imaginative leap, to add a throwing spear. The test, expressed in these terms, may be unfair: other animals do re-envision sticks: chimpanzees, for instance, are capable of seeing them as means of fishing for termites or guiding floating objects towards a riverbank or smiting nuts or for wielding, for enhanced effect, in an aggression display. If they do not see them as potential spears, that may be because no other animal is as good at throwing as humans typically are.36 Non-human apes, who do relatively little throwing to relatively little effect, find practical uses for sticks, all of which involve some ‘scenario visualization’ or capacity for imaginatively foreseeing a solution. Many animals, especially species with evolutionary pasts as predators or prey, deploy imagination in problem-solving. When a rat finds a way through a maze, it is reasonable to assume that the creature knows where he or she is going. When, by trial and error over a period of weeks, my dog in his youth developed his ingenious (though ultimately unavailing) strategy for catching squirrels (see p. 2), he displayed, in a small way, imaginative foresight. Dogs also dream. So do cats. You can see them twitching in their sleep, scrabbling with their paws, and making noises consistent with\n\n20 | Out of Our Minds wakeful states of excitement or anxiety. Their eyes revolve in sleep, matching the rapid eye-movement of dreaming humans.37 In dreams pets may be rehearsing or relishing playfulness or reliving or anticipating adventures with prey or other food. This does not mean that when awake they can imagine unreality with the same freedom as human minds exhibit: sleep is a special, untypical form of consciousness that bestows exceptional licence. But in dreaming non-humans do share a visionary property of human minds. They also help us envisage the circumstances in which our ancestors acquired the power of imagination. Like Arp’s tool-makers, my dog hunts: indeed, dogs and humans have a long history of hunting together. A canine evolutionary psychologist, if there were such a thing, would identify a lot of behaviour, even in the most placid lapdog, as a product of predation: eviscerating a fluffy toy, mock-fighting in play, scratching at a scent in a rug as if trying to dig out a rabbit warren or foxhole. I do not want to invoke the concept of ‘Man the Hunter’, which feminist critique has impugned (although ‘man’, to me, is a word of common gender, unconfined to either sex). Because hunting is a form of foraging, ‘The Human Forager’ may be a better term in any case. Still, in species that prey and are preyed on, hunting genuinely stimulates the development of imagination in the long run. It does so, I suggest, because hunting and hunted creatures need to evolve an intermediate faculty, which I call anticipation. If imagination is the power to see what is not there, and memory is the power to see what is there no longer, anticipation is of a similar sort: the property of being able to see what is not there yet, envisaging dangers or opportunities beyond the next rise or behind the next tree trunk, foreseeing where food might be found or peril might lurk. Like memory, therefore, anticipation is a faculty at the threshold of imagination – poised to cross, like an intrusive salesman or an importunate caller. Like memory, again, anticipation jostles with imagination in overlapping regions of the brain. All three faculties conjure absent scenes. Blend bad memory and good anticipation together: imagination results. Anticipation is probably a product of evolution, a faculty selected for survival and encoded in heritable genes. The discovery of ‘mirror neurons’ – particles in the brains of some species, including our own,\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 21\n\nthat respond similarly when we observe an action or perform it ourselves – excited expectations, about a quarter of a century ago, that they would disclose the roots of empathy and imitation; more remarkably, however, measurements of activity of these ‘suculs’ in macaques demonstrated powers of anticipation: in experiments in 2005, some monkeys only saw people move as if to grasp food; others witnessed the completed action. Both groups responded identically.38 Culture can encourage anticipation, but only if evolution supplies the material to work with. Predator and prey both need it, because each needs to anticipate the movements of the other. Humans have a lot of it because we need a lot of it. We need more of it than our competitor-species, because we have so little of almost everything else that matters. We are slow in eluding predators, catching prey, and outrunning rivals in the race for food. Because we are clumsy in climbing, a lot of foods are effectively beyond our reach and a lot of refuge is denied us. We are not as sharp-eyed as most rival animals. Our skill in scenting prey or danger, or hearing from afar, has probably declined since hominid times, but is never likely to have matched canids, say, or felines. We have pitiably feeble fangs and claws. Our ancestors had to commit themselves to the hunt despite the way other species with superior equipment dominated the niche: hominin digestive equipment, from jaws to guts, was inadequate to deal with most plants; so carnivorism became compulsory, perhaps as much as three or four million years ago. First as scavengers and gradually, increasingly as hunters, in the line of evolution that produced us, hominins had to find ways of acquiring meat for food. Evolution gave us few physical advantages to make up for our defects. Bipedalism freed hands and hoisted heads, but our overall agility remains laggard, and by becoming merely feet, our lowest extremities ceased to be available as useful extra hands. The biggest adjustment evolution made in our favour is that no species can challenge our average skill in throwing and in fashioning objects to throw and tools to throw them with; we can therefore deploy missiles against the prey we cannot catch and the predators who can catch us. To aim at moving objects, however, we need keenly developed anticipation, so as to predict how the target is likely to shift. Anticipation is the evolved skill that minimized our deficiencies and maximized our potential. A\n\n22 | Out of Our Minds lot of the arguments that help to explain human anticipation apply to other primates. Indeed, all primates seem well endowed with the same faculty. Some of them even show potential, at least, for flights of imagination recognizably like those of humans. Some paint pictures (like Congo the chimp, whose canvases command thousands of dollars at auction), while some coin new words, as Washoe, the linguistically adept ape of the Yerkes Institute, did when she referred to a Brazil nut as a ‘rock-berry’ in American sign-language, and became the first ape to construct a term for an item her keepers had not labelled. She also devised ‘water birds’ to designate swans even when they were out of water. Other non-human apes invent technologies, introduce cultural practices, and change the way they look by adorning themselves with what seems to be a protean aesthetic sensibility – though they never take these practices anything like as far as humans. What then makes us the most imaginative primates? In part, no doubt, the selectively superior memories we observe in chimpanzees and gorillas account for the difference: you need, as we have seen, a bad memory to be maximally imaginative. In part, too, we can point to differing levels of attainment in physical prowess: we need most anticipation, among primates, because we have least strength and agility. Evolutionary psychology – that divisive discipline, which pits disdainers against disciples – can supply the rest of the answer. Uniquely, among extant primates, we humans have a long hunting history behind us. Our dependence on hunted foods is extreme. Chimpanzees hunt, as, to a lesser extent, do bonobos (who used to be classified as ‘dwarf chimpanzees’). But it means much less to them than it does to us. They are stunningly proficient in tracking prey and positioning themselves for the kill, but no one observed them hunting until the 1960s: that may be a trick of the evidence, but the environmental stresses human encroachments inflicted on them may have forced them to develop new food sources by or at that time. In any case, hunting is a marginal activity for chimpanzees, whereas it was the foundation of the viability of human societies for ninety per cent of the time Homo sapiens has existed. Typically, hunting chimps get up to three per cent of the calorific content of their diet from the hunt; a study, on the other hand, of ten typical hunting peoples in tropical environments, similar to those favoured by chimps, yielded hugely higher figures. On average,\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 23\n\nthe selected communities derived nearly sixty per cent of their intake from hunted meat.39 Overwhelmingly, moreover, chimpanzee carnivores focus on a narrow range of species, including wild pigs and small antelopes, with preference, at least in Gombe where most observations have been recorded, for colobus monkeys. Every human community, by contrast, has a rich variety of prey. Chiefly, perhaps, because hunting is still a relatively infrequent practice among chimpanzees, and the young have only occasional opportunities to learn, it takes up to twenty years to train a chimp to be a top-rated hunter, able to head off the fleeing colobus or block his route to trap him; novices begin, like beaters in humans’ hunting, by springing the trap – scaring the prey into flight. Human youngsters, by contrast, can become proficient after a few expeditions.40 Even in the course of their limited experience as hunters you can literally see chimpanzees cultivating a faculty of anticipation, estimating the likely path of prey and planning and concerting efforts to channel and block it with all the elegance of an American football defence tracking a runner or receiver. Hunting hones anticipation for every creature that practises it. But it is not surprising that Homo sapiens has a more developed faculty of anticipation than other, comparable creatures – even more than our most closely related surviving species. Highly developed powers of anticipation are likely to precede fertile imaginations. When we anticipate, we imagine prey or predator behind the next obstacle. We guess in advance the way a threat or chance will spring. But imagination is more than anticipation. It is, in part, the consequence of a superabundant faculty of anticipation, because, once one can envisage enemies or victims or problems or outcomes ahead of their appearance, one can, presumably, envisage other, ever less probable objects, ending with what is unexperienced or invisible or metaphysical or impossible – such as a new species, a previously unsampled food, unheard music, fantastic stories, a new colour, or a monster, or a sprite, or a number greater than infinity, or God. We can even think of Nothing – perhaps the most defiant leap any imagination has ever made, since the idea of Nothing is, by definition, unexampled in experience and ungraspable in reality. That is how our power of anticipation leads us, through imagination, to ideas.\n\n24 | Out of Our Minds Imagination reaches beyond the range accessible to anticipation and memory; unlike normal products of evolution, it exceeds the demands of survival and confers no competitive edge. Culture stimulates it, partly by rewarding it and partly by enhancing it: we praise the bard, pay the piper, fear the shaman, obey the priest, revere the artist. We unlock visions with dance and drums and music and alcohol and excitants and narcotics. I hope, however, that readers will agree to see imagination as the outcome of two evolved faculties in combination: our bad memories, which distort experience so wildly that they become creative; and our overdeveloped powers of anticipation, which crowd our minds with images beyond those we need. Any reader who remains unconvinced that memory and anticipation constitute imagination may like to try a thought experiment: try imagining what life would be like without them. Without recalling effects of memory, or looking ahead to a future bereft of memory, you cannot do it. Your best recourse is to refer – again, deploying memory – to a fictional character deficient in both faculties. To Sergeant Troy in Far From the Madding Crowd, ‘memories were an encumbrance and anticipation a superfluity’. In consequence, his mental and emotional life was impoverished, without real empathy for others or admirable accomplishments for himself.\n\nThinking with Tongues Alongside memory and anticipation, language is the last ingredient of imagination. By ‘language’ I mean a system of symbols: an agreed pattern or code of gestures and utterances with no necessarily obvious resemblance to the things signified. If you show me a picture of a pig, I get an idea of what you want to refer to, because a picture is representative, not symbolic. But if you say ‘pig’ to me, I do not know what you mean unless I know the code, because words are symbols. Language contributes to imagination to this extent: we need it to turn imaginings, which may take the form of images or noises, into communicable ideas. Some people think or claim to think that you cannot conceive of anything unless you have a term for it. Jacob Bronowski was among them. He was one of the last great polymaths and believed passionately\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 25\n\nthat imagination is a uniquely human gift. ‘The ability’, he said, shortly before his death in 1974, ‘to conceive of things which are not present to the senses is crucial to the development of man. And this ability requires the existence of a symbol somewhere inside the mind for something that is not there.’41 Some kinds of thinking do depend on language. Speakers of English or Dutch, for instance, understand the relationship between sex and gender differently from people who think in, say, Spanish or French, and who therefore have no words of common gender at their disposal, and yet who are used to designating male creatures by feminine terms and vice versa. Spanish feminists, in partial consequence, coin feminine terms to designate, for instance, female lawyers and ministers, while leaving other designations untouched, whereas their Anglophone counterparts, equally illogically, abjure such feminine words as they have, renouncing, for instance, ‘actress’ or ‘authoress’. Yet scholars used to exaggerate the extent to which the languages we speak have measurable effects on how we perceive the world.42 On the basis of currently available evidence, it seems more commonly the case that we devise words to express our ideas, rather than the other way round. Experiments show, for instance, that human infants make systematic choices before they make symbolic utterances.43 We may not be able to say how thought can happen without language, but it is at least possible to conceive of a thing first and invent a term or other symbol for it afterwards. ‘Angels’, as Umberto Eco once said, summarizing Dante, ‘do not speak. For they understand each other through a sort of instantaneous mental reading, and they know everything they are allowed to know … not by any use of language but by watching the Divine Mind.’44 It makes just as good sense to say that language is the result of imagination as that it is a necessary precondition. Symbols – and language is a system of symbols, in which utterances or other signs stand for their referents – resemble tools. If my case so far is valid, symbols and tools alike are results of a single property of the creatures that devise them: the ability to see what is not there – to fill gaps in vision, and to re-envisage one thing as if it were something else. That is how a stick can become a proxy for an absent limb or a lens transform an eye. Similarly, in language, sounds stand for emotions or objects and evoke absent entities. My wife and dog, as I write these\n\n26 | Out of Our Minds lines, are four thousand miles away; but I can summon them symbolically by mentioning them. I have finished my cup of coffee, but because the image of it, brimming and steaming, is in my mind, I can conjure the phantasm of it in writing. Of course, once we have a repertoire of symbols the effect on imagination is freeing and fertilizing; and the more abundant the symbols, the more prolific the results. Language (or any symbolic system) and imagination nourish each other, but they may originate independently. Language was, presumably, the first system of signs people developed. But how long ago did that happen? Fallacies – or, at least, unwarranted assumptions – underlie almost all our thinking about language. Disputes over the configuration of jaws and palates have dominated controversy about the dating of the first language; but vocal equipment is irrelevant: it can affect the kind of language you use but not the feasibility of language in general. In any case, we tend to assume that language is for communication and socialization, creating bonds of mutual understanding and facilitating collaboration: the human equivalent of monkeys picking at one another’s lice or dogs exchanging sniffs and licks. But language may have started as mere self-expression, uttered to communicate one’s pain or joy or frustration or fulfilment only to oneself. Our ancestors’ first vocalizations were, presumably, physical effects of bodily convulsions, such as sneezes, coughs, yawns, expectorations, exhalations, farts. The first utterances with deeper significance might have been purrs of satisfaction, smacks of the lips, or pensive murmurs. And when people first consciously used noises or gestures or utterances to make a point, it is surely as likely to have been a hostile point, warning off predators or rivals with a snarl or scream or a display of prowess, as an attempt to set up a partnership of more than a merely sexual nature. Besides, if language is for communication, it does not do its job very well. No symbol exactly matches what it signifies. Even signifiers specifically designed to resemble objects are often obscure or misleading. One day, I noticed a fellow-diner in search of the lavatory in a pretentious restaurant. He poised uncertainly for a moment between doors marked respectively with pictures of a strawberry and a banana, before realization dawned. I often blink uncomprehendingly at the icons designers scatter over my computer screen. I once read a perhaps\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 27\n\nfanciful newspaper report of the writer’s attempt to buy a small gold cross pendant as a baptismal gift. ‘Do you’, the shop assistant asked, ‘want one with a little man on it?’ Since most of the signs language deploys are arbitrary, and have no resemblance to the object signified, the chances of misleading multiply. Misunderstanding – which we usually condemn for breaking peace, marring marriage, occluding the classroom, and impeding efficiency – can be fruitful; it can make ideas multiply. Many new ideas are old ideas, misunderstood. Language contributes to the formulation of ideas and the flow of innovation, through distortions and disasters as well as through successful communication.\n\nProducing Cultures Memory and anticipation, then, with perhaps a little help from language, are the factories of imagination. Ideas, if my argument is right so far, are the end products of the process. So what? What difference do ideas make to the real world? Don’t vast forces – climate and disease, evolution and environment, economic laws and historical determinants – shape it, beyond the reach of human power to change what is bound to happen anyway? You can’t think your way out of the clockwork of the cosmos. Or can you? Can you escape the wheels without getting crushed among the cogs? I propose that ideas, rather than impersonal forces, make the world; that almost everything we do starts in our minds, with reimagined worlds that we then try to construct in reality. We often fail, but even our failures impact on events and jar them into new patterns, new courses. The oddness of our experience is obvious if, again, we compare ourselves with other animals. Plenty of other species have societies: they live in packs or herds or hives or anthills of varying complexity but – species by species and habitat for habitat – uniform patterning marks the way they live. As far as we can tell, instinct regulates their relationships and predicts their behaviour. Some species have culture – which I distinguish from non-cultural or pre-cultural kinds of socialization whenever creatures learn behaviours by experience and\n\n28 | Out of Our Minds pass them on to subsequent generations by example, teaching, learning, and tradition. The first discovery of non-human culture occurred in Japan in 1953, when primatologists observed a young female macaque monkey, whom they called Imo, behave in unprecedented ways. Until then, members of Imo’s tribe prepared sweet potatoes for eating by scraping off the dirt. Imo discovered that you can wash them in a spring or the sea. Her fellow-macaques had difficulty separating food-grains from the sand that clung to them. Imo found that by plunging them in water you can separate them easily, scooping up the edible matter as the heavier sand sinks. Imo was not just a genius: she was also a teacher. Her mother, her siblings, and, little by little, the rest of the tribe learned to imitate her techniques. To this day, the monkeys continue her practices. They have become cultural in an unequivocal sense: rites practised for the sake of upholding tradition rather than for any practical effect. The monkeys still dip their sweet potatoes in the sea, even if you present them with ready-washed specimens.45 Over the last seven decades, science has revealed ever increasing instances of culture beyond the human sphere, first among primates, subsequently among dolphins and whales, crows and songbirds, elephants and rats. One researcher has even suggested that the capacity for culture is universal and detectible in bacteria so that, potentially, any species might develop it given time and appropriate environmental pressures or opportunities.46 However that may be, on present evidence no animal has gone nearly so far along the cultural trajectory as Homo sapiens. We can measure how cultures diverge: the more variation, the greater the total amount of cultural change. But only humans display much material to study in this respect. Whales have pretty much the same social relationships wherever they graze and blow. So do most other social species. Chimpanzees exhibit divergence: in some places, for instance, they crack nuts with stones; in others they wield sticks to fish for termites. But human differences dwarf such instances. Baboons’ mating habits cover an interesting range from monogamous unions to sultanic seraglio-gathering and serial polygamy, but again they seem unable to match the variety of humans’ couplings. Other animals’ cultures are not stagnant – but they seem so by comparison with ours. There is now a whole academic sub-discipline\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 29\n\ndevoted to chimpanzee archaeology. Julio Mercader of the University of Calgary and his colleagues and students dig up sites chimps have frequented for thousands of years; so far, however, they have found remarkable continuities in the selection and use of tools, but not much evidence of innovation since the animals first began to crack nuts with the help of stones. Chimpanzee politics, too, are a rich field of study. Frans de Waal of the Yerkes Institute has made a speciality of the study of what he calls Chimpanzee Machiavellianism.47 And of course, chimp societies experience political change in the form of leadership contests, which often produce violent reversals of fortune for one alpha male or another, and for the gangs of toughs who surround and support candidates for the role of top ape. Occasionally, we can glimpse chimps’ potential for revolutionary change, when, for instance, an intelligent chimp usurps, for a while, the role of the alpha male. The classic case is that of Mike, a small and feeble but clever chimpanzee of Gombe, who seized power over his tribe in 1964. Enhancing his displays of aggression by clashing big cans that he filched from the primatologist’s camp, he intimidated the alpha male into submission and remained in control for six years.48 He was the first chimpanzee revolutionary we know of, who not only usurped leadership but changed the way a leader emerged. We can assume, therefore, that similar revolutions could occur deep in the hominid past. But even Mike was not clever enough to devise a way of passing power on without the intervention of another putsch by a resurgent alpha male.49 A remarkable transformation of political culture occurred among some baboons in 1986, when the entire elite was wiped out, perhaps as a result of eating poisonous trash from a human midden, perhaps because of tuberculosis. No new alpha male arose to take over: instead, a system of wide power-sharing emerged, with females playing major roles.50 Chimpanzee tribes sometimes split when young males secede in the hope of finding mates outside the group. Wars between the secessionists and the vieille garde frequently ensue. But these fluctuations take place within an overall pattern of barely disturbed continuity. The structures of chimpanzee societies hardly alter. Compared with the rapid turnover and amazing diversity of human political systems, variation in other primates’ politics is tiny.\n\n30 | Out of Our Minds\n\nThe Power of Thought So the problem historians are called on to solve is, ‘Why does history happen at all?’ Why is the story of humankind so crowded with change, so crammed with incident, whereas other social and cultural animals’ lifeways diverge at most only a little from place to place and time to time? Two theories are on the table: the first, that it is all to do with matter; the second, that it is all to do with mind. People used to think that mind and matter were very different types of thing. The satirist who coined the Punch joke that appears as an epigraph to this book expressed the perfect mutual exclusivity of the concepts – mind was no matter, and matter never mind. The distinction no longer seems reliable. Scholars and scientists reject what they call ‘mind–body dualism’. We now know that when we have ideas, or, more generally, whenever thoughts arise in our minds, physical and chemical process accompany them in the brain. The way we think, moreover, is trapped in the physical world. We cannot escape the constraints of our environments and the pressures and stresses from outside ourselves that encroach on our freedom to think. We are prisoners of evolution – limited to the capacities with which nature has endowed us. Material drives – such as hunger, lust, fear – have measurable effects on our metabolisms and invade and warp our thoughts. I do not think, however, that human behaviour can be explained only in terms of response to material exigencies, first, because the stresses that arise from the physical framework of life also affect other animals, and so cannot be invoked to explain what is peculiarly human; and, second, because the rhythms of change in evolution and environment tend to be relatively slow or fitful, whereas the turnover of new behaviour in humans is bewilderingly fast. Instead, or additionally, I propose mind – by which I simply mean the property of producing ideas – as the chief cause of change: the place where human diversity starts. Mind in this sense is not the same thing as the brain, nor a part or particle embedded in it. It more resembles, perhaps, a process of interaction between cerebral functions – the creative flash and crash you see and hear when memory and anticipation spark and scrape against each other. The claim that we make our own world\n\nMind Out of Matter: The Mainspring of Ideas | 31\n\nis frightening to those of us who fear the terrible responsibilities that flow from freedom. Superstitions ascribe our ideas to the promptings of imps or angels, demons or gods, or attribute our ancestors’ innovations to extraterrestrial whisperers and manipulators. For Marxists and other historicists, our minds are the playthings of impersonal forces, doomed or destined by the course of history, to which we may as well assent as we cannot restrain or reverse it. For sociobiologists, we can think only what is in our genes. For memeticists, ideas are autonomous and evolve according to a dynamic of their own, invading our brains as viruses invade our bodies. All these evasions seem to me to fail to confront our real experience of ideas. We have ideas because we think them up, not thanks to any force outside ourselves. To seek to accumulate and juxtapose information may be an instinctive way we have of trying to make sense of it. There comes a point, however, when the ‘sense’ we make of knowledge transcends anything in our experience, or when the intellectual pleasure it gives us exceeds material need. At that point, an idea is born. Human ways of life are volatile because they change in response to ideas. Our species’ most extraordinary facility, compared with the rest of creation, is our capacity for generating ideas so powerful and persistent that they make us seek ways of applying them, altering our environs, and generating further change. Put it like this: we re-envision our world – imagining a shelter more efficient than nature provides, or a weapon stronger than our arms, or a greater abundance of possessions, or a city, or a different mate, or a dead enemy, or an afterlife. When we get those ideas we strive to realize them, if they seem desirable, or to frustrate them, if they inspire us with dread. Either way, we ignite change. That is why ideas are important: they really are the sources of most of the other kinds of change that distinguish human experience.\n\nChapter 2 Gathering Thoughts Thinking Before Agriculture\n\nI\n\nf what I have said so far is right, the logical conclusion is that the history of thinking should include non-human creatures. We have, however, little or no access to the thoughts even of the other animals with whom we interact most closely. Extinct species of hominid predecessors or hominin ancestors, however, have left tantalizing evidence of their ideas.1\n\nThe Moral Cannibals: The Earliest Ideas? The earliest instance I know of lies among the detritus of a cannibal feast eaten about 800,000 years ago in a cave in Atapuerca, Spain. Specialists bicker about how to classify the feasters, who probably belonged to a species ancestral to our own but preceding ours by so long an interval – of some 600,000 years – that anything they had in common with us seems astonishing. They split bones of their own species to suck out the marrow. But there was more to the feast than hunger or gluttony. These were thinking cannibals. We have trained ourselves to recoil from cannibalism and to see it as treason against our species: a form of sub-human savagery. The evidence, however, suggests the opposite: cannibalism is typically – you might almost say peculiarly, even definingly – human and cultural. Under the stones of every civilization lie human bones, snapped and sucked. Most of us nowadays, like chimpanzees beholding occasional cannibal aberrations\n\n34 | Out of Our Minds among their peers, react uncomprehendingly. But in most human societies, for most of the past, we should have accepted cannibalism as normal – embedded in the way society works. No other mammals practise it so regularly or on such a large scale as we do: indeed, all others tend to avoid it except in extreme circumstances – which suggests that it did not come ‘naturally’ to our ancestors: they had to think about it. It is consistent with just about everything we know about the nature of cannibalism to assume that the Atapuerca cannibals were performing a thoughtful ritual, underlain by an idea: an attempt to achieve an imagined effect, augmenting the eaters’ powers or reshaping their natures. Cannibals sometimes eat people to survive famine or deprivation or top up protein-deficient diets.2 Overwhelmingly, however, more reflective aims, moral or mental, aesthetic or social, inspire them: self-transformation, the appropriation of power, the ritualization of the eater’s relationship with the eaten, revenge, or the ethic of victory. Normally, where it is normal, cannibalism occurs in war, as an act symbolizing dominance of the defeated. Or human meat is the gods’ food and cannibalism a form of divine communion. In a crazed frenzy, villagers of Hautefaye in the Dordogne in 1870 devoured one of their neighbours, whom a mad rumour misidentified as a ‘Prussian’ invader or spy, because nothing save cannibalism could satiate the fury they felt.3 For the Orokaiva people of Papua, it – until the island authorities banned it in the 1960s – was their way of ‘capturing spirits’ in compensation for lost warriors. The Hua of New Guinea ate their dead to conserve vital fluids they believed to be non-renewable in nature. In the same highlands, Gimi women used to guarantee the renewal of their fertility by consuming dead menfolk. ‘We would not leave a man to rot!’ was their traditional cry. ‘We take pity on him! Come to me, so you shall not rot on the ground: let your body dissolve inside me!’4 They unconsciously echoed the Brahmins who, in an anecdote of Herodotus, defended cannibalism on the grounds that other ways of disposing of the dead were impious.5 Until ‘pacification’ in the 1960s the Amazonian Huari ate their slaughtered enemies in revenge and their close kin in ‘compassion’ – to spare them the indignity of putrefaction. Aztec warriors ingested morsels of the bodies of battle-captives to\n\nGathering Thoughts: Thinking Before Agriculture | 35\n\nacquire their virtue and valour.6 The hominids of Atapuerca launched an adventure in thought.7 Theirs was the earliest recoverable idea – recorded deep in layers of cognitive stratigraphy: the idea that thinkers can change themselves, appropriate qualities not their own, become something other than what they are. All subsequent ideas echo from the cave-walls of Atapuerca: we are still trying to refashion ourselves and remake our world. By about 300,000 years ago – still long before the advent of Homo sapiens – when a landslide sealed the cave-mouth and turned Atapuerca into a kind of time-capsule, the locals were stacking the bones of their dead in recognizable patterns. What the rite meant is unfathomable, but it was a rite. It had meaning. It suggests, at a minimum, another idea – the distinction between life and death – and perhaps a kind of religious sensibility that treats the dead as deserving of the honour or trouble of the living.\n\nInklings of Afterlife There is similar but more easily interpreted evidence in burials of some forty thousand years ago: recent enough to coincide with Homo sapiens but actually belonging to the distinct species we call Neanderthals. There is in principle no good reason to suppose that Neanderthals were less imaginative or less produ"
