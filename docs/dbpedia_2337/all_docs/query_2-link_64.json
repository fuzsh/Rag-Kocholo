        "text": "Poetry and History. Representations of Lepanto / Poesía e Historia. Representaciones de Lepanto is a bilingual workshop (English and Spanish), aiming to explore significant representations of the Battle of Lepanto in Spanish works of Literature and History, composed during the XVI-th and XVII-th centuries, and to trace their impact on the construction of the Spanish Empire cultural identity.\n\nThe workshop enjoys the presence and contributions of important scholars in the field, coming from various prestigious academic education and research institutions, such as Roberta ALVITI (Università degli studi di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale), Fernando José PANCORBO MURILLO (University of Basel), Oana-Andreia SÂMBRIAN (Romanian Academy), Rachel SCOTT (King´s College London), and Şizen YIACOUP (University of Liverpool).\n\nThe meetings will take place on 4 September 2019, being hosted by ICUB-Humanities, a research division of The Research Institute of the University of Bucharest. The event is part of the project From Famagusta to Lepanto: Spain between Cultural Inferiority and Imperial Aggrandizing by Silvia-Alexandra ȘTEFAN, supported fellow of the ICUB-Humanities, University of Bucharest."
