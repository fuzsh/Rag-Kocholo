        "text": "Today I am delighted to celebrate a new book by fellow author Stuart Rudge, Master of Battle which is the exhilarating fourth instalment of the Legend of the Cid.\n\nPeace reigns in the Kingdom of Leon-Castile, and Antonio Perez returns to his native Asturias to discover the fate of his remaining family. Whilst there, he reconnects with Jimena, his childhood companion and the girl he once loved. But when his loyal friend Rodrigo and Jimena fall in love, Antonio is consumed by jealousy. As the wedding of two of his closest companions approaches, Antonio must battle his enemies and his inner demons, lest it lead to the ruin of all he holds dear.\n\nHaving secured his borders, Alfonso VI of Leon-Castile pushes south against the Moors. When a raid by the Moors threatens Castile, Rodrigo leads his men on a daring campaign of vengeance. But with the venture a credible threat to the uneasy peace Alfonso has brokered with the taifa kings, Rodrigo’s bravado could have dire consequences to himself and the security of the kingdom. With enemies old and new circling, will Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar find greatness on the battlefields of Hispania, and cement his reputation as one of the most feared warriors in the land, or will his actions lead to his ruin?\n\nStuart’s excellent series focuses on the hero, El Cid who is one of the most famous warriors of his age and of course, every great warrior has to have a great sword!\n\nEl Cid and Tizona\n\nMany warriors of renown and legend have a named blade which strikes fear in enemies and courage in allies in equal measure, such as King Arthur’s Excalibur, and Charlemagne’s Joyeuse. Fans of fantasy will recognise Aragorn’s Anduril from Lord of the Rings, or Jon Snow’s Longclaw in A Song of Ice and Fire. The blade of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, El Cid Campeador, can almost certainly be included in a list of revered weapons. The older perception of Tizona is that of a weapon which inspired the men of Hispania to drive the Moors from Spain. But where did it come from, and how did the Cid receive it? This article hopes to sift legend from mystery and discover the origins of Tizona.\n\nThe sword believed to be Tizona in the Museum of Burgos\n\nImage: Wikipedia\n\nThe name of the sword of the Cid first appears in the Cantar del mio Cid, where it is called Tizon; the poem dates to around 1160-1200 AD, just a few generations after the Cid lived, and though some historians doubt its existence, it seems highly likely to me that he carried a blade of that name. The Thesaurus of Castilian or Spanish Language claims Tizon comes from the Latin titio, which means ’embers, burning wood’, whilst in other sources it has been stylised as ‘firebrand, burning torch’. Though a real sword with the same name is currently housed in the Museum of Burgos, it is most certainly not the original. An examination of the blade in 2001 suggested it could have originated in the eleventh century, but the cross guard and pommel are of a Gothic style and date to a few centuries later; the scholar Ramón Menéndez Pidal claims the entire sword is a fraud. I believe the sword is not the one which the Cid would have carried, mainly because the blade does not look Moorish in design, and it was said to have been made from Toledo steel, so more than likely would have carried some sort of Moorish decoration or, because smiths who could craft Toledo steel were few and far between, a mark or signature of the smith would perhaps be present.\n\nBut if the Cid did have a blade names Tizona, where did it come from? He had a military career spanning nearly four decades, and fought countless battles, so it is almost impossible to say. It could have been taken from a Moorish captive after some raid or significant battle; it may have been a gift from the amir of Zaragoza when he was employed after his exile by Alfonso, or from al-Mutamid of Seville after the battle of Cabra. The Cantar del mio Cid claims he won it from the King Yusuf of Valencia. As a historical fiction writer, I have used a little bit of research and creativity to produce an original origin story for the Cid’s acquisition of Tizona.\n\nEl Cid with Tizona\n\nImage: https://apetcher.wordpress.com/\n\nThe Historia Roderici claims that the Cid did battle and defeated a champion of Medinaceli, but does not provide a date as to when this duel allegedly took place. Medinaceli is a town in eastern Spain in what was the kingdom of Toledo, and the name derives from the Arabic Medina Salim, which meant ‘the safe city’ as it was perched on top of a hill, surrounded by a stout wall and protected by a castle. In the year 1080, a raiding party of Moors proceeded north from Medinaceli, or the area around it, and attacked the fortress of Gormaz, at that time under Castilian control, and laid waste to it. In retaliation, El Cid led an attack of his own and devastated the Moorish countryside, taking many slaves back to Castile with him. In popular tradition this is the final straw for Alfonso, who already had a strained relationship with the Cid, and exiled him from Leon-Castile. During the Cid’s act of retribution against the Moors, is this where he faced the champion of Medinaceli? It seems entirely plausible, and so in Master of Battle, it was all too tempting to include the duel and have the Cid take the sword of his adversary as his own.\n\nWe will likely never know how the Cid came into possession of his legendary blade Tizona, but its existence in his literature highlights his qualities as a warrior of great renown. What makes the Cid so extraordinary is that he has an epic poem written about him, as well as several histories, and a legendary sword which became synonymous with him just as his faithful stead Babieca has. Some Spaniards would argue the Cid’s importance as a legendary figure just as much as an Englishman would stake a case for that of King Arthur and Excalibur. What sets him aside is that he was a real man, and his deeds helped inspire the warriors of Hispania, both Christian and Muslim, to face their enemies with courage and zeal, under the light of the legendary Tizona.\n\nAbout Stuart Rudge\n\nStuart Rudge was born and raised in Middlesbrough, where he still lives. His love of history came from his father and uncle, both avid readers of history, and his love of table top war gaming and strategy video games. He studied Ancient History and Archaeology at Newcastle University, and has spent his fair share of time in muddy trenches, digging up treasure at Bamburgh Castle.\n\nHe has worked in the retail sector and volunteered in museums, before working in York Minster, which he considered the perfect office. His love of writing blossomed within the historic walls, and he knew there were stories within which had to be told. Despite a move into the shipping and logistics sector (a far cry to what he hoped to ever do), his love of writing has only grown stronger.\n\nAmazon Link:\n\nUK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09C4KLW8Y\n\nUS: https://www.amazon.coM/gp/product/B09C4KLW8Y\n\nRise of a Champion and Blood Feud are the first two instalments of the Legend of the Cid series. He hopes to establish himself as a household name in the mould of Bernard Cornwell, Giles Kristian, Ben Kane and Matthew Harffy, amongst a host of his favourite writers.\n\nYou can find Stuart on social media and his website:\n\nTwitter: @stu_rudge\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/stuartrudgeauthor\n\nWebsite: https://stuartrudge.wordpress.com/\n\nI am very pleased to welcome two writer friends and collaborators to the blog today: Alison Morton and Helen Hollick, both of whom I met for the first time at the 2012 Historical Novel Society Conference in London. Crikey, what a long time ago that seems!\n\nBoth Alison and Helen have been successful in the genre of historical fiction, but now they are applying their considerable skills to an entirely different genre.\n\nIt was only when Helen Hollick met up with Alison Morton for an author get together in Bristol, that they realised, purely by coincidence, that they were both considering branching out from their familiar genres to turn to crime … writing it that is!\n\nAlison (a self-confessed ‘Roman nut’) has six novels, a collection of short stories and two novellas from her Roma Nova alternative history series firmly under her belt. As Derek knows, she had always wondered what a society would be like if part of the Roman Empire still existed. And she took to creating characters and their adventures of courage and endurance in the face of treason, conspiracy and insurrection – all very Roman elements! However, it was the thriller element of these stories that she enjoyed writing the most.\n\nAuthor Conn Iggulden, who read and endorsed Alison’s novel INSURRECTIO, suggested that she should turn one of her Roma Novan heroines into a member of a modern day European investigation agency and write the story as a crime thriller. The result, is Double Identity. French-English protagonist, Mélisende des Pittones, expects a peaceful retirement from her army life into domestic married bliss, but when her fiancé is murdered she finds herself recalled and forced to work with grumpy English detective DS McCracken.\n\nHelen had her Arthurian trilogy, two novels about the events that led to the Battle of Hastings in 1066 (one of which was a USA Today bestseller,) her pirate-based Sea Witch nautical adventure voyages, a couple of non-fiction books about pirates and smugglers and several short stories included in a couple of anthologies. She discovered the ‘cosy mystery’, genre through reading (and enjoying!) author Debbie Young’s Sophie Sayers series. These led to reading more of the same genre – some of which made her think, ‘I could do as good as these.’ She chose to base A Mirror Murder on her decade of experience of working as a library assistant back in the 1970s, with her protagonist, Jan Christopher, being the niece of DCI Toby Christopher – and the girlfriend of his Detective Sergeant, Laurie Walker.\n\nHelen is now working on a second murder mystery for the Jan Christopher Mysteries, and one of these days she’ll get Voyage Six of the Sea Witch Voyages finished. Alison has around 34,000 words of a Roma Nova story in early draft form, and 27,000 words of the second instalment of her new crime thriller series. Both will be eagerly awaited by her readers!\n\nABOUT DOUBLE IDENTITY by Alison Morton\n\nDeeply in love, a chic Parisian lifestyle before her. Now she’s facing prison for murder.\n\nIt’s three days since Mel des Pittones threw in her job as an intelligence analyst with the French special forces to marry financial trader Gérard Rohlbert. But her dream turns to nightmare when she wakes to find him dead in bed beside her.\n\nHer horror deepens when she’s accused of his murder. Met Police detective Jeff McCracken wants to pin Gérard’s death on her. Mel must track down the real killer, even if that means being forced to work with the obnoxious McCracken.\n\nBut as she unpicks her fiancé’s past, she discovers his shocking secret life. To get to the truth, she has to go undercover and finds almost everybody around her is hiding a second self. Mel can trust nobody. Can she uncover the real killer before they stop her?\n\nBuying links\n\nFor all ebook and paperback retailers: https://bit.ly/3s0XUlV\n\nKindle: https://mybook.to/DoubleIdentity\n\nABOUT A MIRROR MURDER by Helen Hollick\n\nEighteen-year-old library assistant Jan Christopher’s life is to change on a rainy Friday evening in July 1971, when her legal guardian and uncle, DCI Toby Christopher, gives her a lift home after work. Driving the car, is her uncle’s new Detective Constable, Laurie Walker – and it is love at first sight for the young couple.\n\nBut romance is soon to take a back seat when a baby boy is taken from his pram, a naked man is scaring young ladies in nearby Epping Forest, and an elderly lady is found, brutally murdered… Are the events related? How will they affect the staff and public of the local library where Jan works – and will a blossoming romance survive a police investigation into murder?\n\nBUYING LINK:\n\nAmazon Author Page (Universal Link) http://viewauthor.at/HelenHollick\n\nABOUT ALISON\n\nAlison Morton writes award-winning thrillers series featuring tough, but compassionate heroines.\n\n“Grips like a vice – a writer to watch out for” says crime thriller writer Adrian Magson about Roma Nova series starter INCEPTIO. All six full-length Roma Nova thrillers have won the BRAG Medallion, the prestigious award for indie fiction. SUCCESSIO, AURELIA and INSURRECTIO were selected as Historical Novel Society’s Indie Editor’s Choices. AURELIA was a finalist in the 2016 HNS Indie Award. The Bookseller selected SUCCESSIO as Editor’s Choice in its inaugural indie review.\n\nShe blends her deep love of France with six years’ military service and a life of reading crime, historical, adventure and thriller fiction. On the way, she collected a BA in modern languages and an MA in history. She now lives in Poitou in France, where part of Double Identity is set and is writing a sequel as well as continuing her Roma Nova series. Alison continues to write thrillers and drink wine in France with her husband.\n\nConnect with Alison on her thriller site: https://alison-morton.com\n\nFacebook author page: https://www.facebook.com/AlisonMortonAuthor\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/alison_morton @alison_morton\n\nAlison’s writing blog: https://alisonmortonauthor.com\n\nNewsletter sign-up: http://eepurl.com/ckNeFL\n\nABOUT HELEN\n\nHelen and her family moved from north-east London in 2013 after finding an eighteenth-century North Devon farmhouse through being a ‘victim’ on BBC TV’s popular Escape To The Country show.\n\nFirst accepted for publication by William Heinemann in 1993 – a week after her fortieth birthday – Helen then became a USA Today Bestseller with her historical novel, The Forever Queen (titled A Hollow Crown in the UK) with the sequel, Harold the King (US: I Am The Chosen King) being novels that explore the events that led to the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Her Pendragon’s Banner Trilogy is a fifth-century version of the Arthurian legend, and she also writes a pirate-based nautical adventure/fantasy series, The Sea Witch Voyages. She has other ideas for other tales – and would like the time to write them!\n\nCONNECT WITH HELEN:\n\nWebsite: www.helenhollick.net\n\nNewsletter Subscription: http://tinyletter.com/HelenHollick\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/HelenHollickAuthor\n\nTwitter: @HelenHollick\n\nThank you, Derek, for hosting us on our joint tour. Readers may recognise us as your fellow contributors to the recently published Betrayal anthology of historical stories as well as seasoned historical fiction writers. But as with everything in the writing world, things never stand still…\n\nI’m delighted to welcome to my blog today popular historical novelist, Helen Hollick who, with fellow author, Annie Whitehead is revisiting a very interesting period of Britain’s past.\n\nThe subject matter of Helen’s post is currently very much on my mind as I write book 3 of my Last of the Romans series and attempt to negotiate fifth century Britain – a veritable black hole for historical evidence. Those of us writing about this period must address, at some time, the thorny question of “King Arthur” and that is what Helen is doing today.\n\nKing Arthur. From Roman Britain To Saxon England\n\nby Helen Hollick\n\nSo what’s that title all about then? Are you looking puzzled? Maybe scratching your head? Do I hear you muttering something like, ‘But King Arthur was a knight. You know, Medieval chivalry, searching for the Holy Grail, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Merlin and all that stuff! What’s he got to do with Roman or Saxon Britain?’\n\nWell, actually, to be brutally honest, there is no evidence whatsoever to show, let alone prove, that King Arthur existed at any point of history, be it Roman, Saxon, Plantagenet, Tudor… If he had been a real person during the period of knights in armour (roughly 1200s – 1500s) we would have had some form of written documentation about him. Earlier than this, there is nothing about him in The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Bede writing c731, makes no mention of him in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Nor is there anything definite, aside from a couple of very obscure possible references, in Gildas’s sixth century writing of De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, where he is bemoaning the fact that the structure of Roman authority has vanished and the law of the Church has gone to pot. He does mention a victory against the Saxons at Mons Badonicus (Mount Badon) which resulted in a generation of peace between the Britons and Saxons, but infuriatingly he does not give a location or the name of the battle commanders, British or Saxon.\n\nA Welsh ecclesiastic, Nennius, does talk of Arthur in his Historia Brittonum where he lists twelve battles, giving Arthur the title ‘dux bellorum’ (war commander or leader), claiming that this Arthur fought alongside the kings of the Britons. Which is possible, but alas, Nennius was inclined to make things up, so is not likely to be factual after all.\n\nThe Welsh Annales Cambriae, which were composed in the mid-tenth century, gives a date of Mount Badon as 516 and states Arthur’s death as 537 at the Battle of Camlann. This is a record written several hundred years after the sixth century – time enough for inaccuracies and augmented legends to make their mark. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s pseudo-historical chronicle, the Historia Regum Britanniae, written c1136, was the first literary work to give Arthur the title of ‘King’. Other sources mention his name, but these are all poems, legends, stories, and mostly date from the eighth to the twelfth centuries.\n\nAnother alternative is that maybe the legend of ‘Arthur’ sprang from the deeds of a successful commander who had a different name. There was a real chap called Riothamus who lived in the late fifth century and is listed as ‘a king of the Britons’ by the Byzantine historian Jordanes who wrote in the mid-sixth century – so maybe a little more reliable? What is fact, is that in 460 a Roman diplomat, Bishop Sidonius Apollinaris wrote to Riothamus pleading for aid against unrest among the Bretons living in Armoric (Brittany). In 470 the Western Roman Emperor, Anthemius was campaigning against the Visigoths in Gaul (France). Here again, Anthemius asks for help from Riothamus. Jordanes states that he crossed the sea into Gaul with an army of 12,000 soldiers. The campaign failed because of treachery and Riothamus was defeated at Déols. He retreated north to Burgundy and was never seen or heard of again. Writer and historian, Geoffrey Ashe, has suggested that ‘Riothamus’ could be a title, not a name – meaning something like ‘King Most’ or ‘High King’, which is plausible, but again, not proven.\n\nThere has been academic debate about the existence of Arthur for many years, but it has to be accepted that, beyond the realm of fiction, the bloke just didn’t exist. Brian David, in a 2019 review, stated that, ‘Few topics in late antique and medieval history elicit scholarly groans quite like the idea of a supposedly “factual” King Arthur. Yet historians and other scholars made cases for Arthur’s existence in historical and literary studies until the 1980s. For academics today, the question of the realism of King Arthur has been largely banished to popular books, video games, and movies.’\n\nAs with Robin Hood, it is possible that the legends and myths of Arthur sprung from a real person who played some small, obscure, part in history during those turbulent, confused years between the going of the Romans and the coming of the Saxons. A period we used to call The Dark Ages because of the almost total lack of creditable documentation. Even so, Arthur was most definitely not a king, didn’t have a castle, didn’t achieve huge victories in battle, and didn’t have a magic sword.\n\nWhat is real, however, are the numerous wonderful stories about Arthur!\n\nThere are many of them, from Geoffrey of Monmouth to Disney, via authors such as Mary Stewart, Rosemary Sutcliff, T.H.White, Stephan Lawhead, Persia Woolley, Bernard Cornwell – and myself. My Pendragon’s Banner Trilogy was first published in the 1990s, and is still popular here in 2020. My Arthur is based on the early Welsh legends: there is no Lancelot, Gawain or Merlin in my books.\n\nNo magic, no fantasy. I do use Ashe’s suggestion that Riothamus was Arthur, because I think it is a good theory. My Arthur starts out as an illegitimate boy favoured by Uthr Pendragon and detested by Morgause, Uther’s mistress. They arrive in Gwynedd, North Wales to meet up with Prince Cunedda and his sons, in order to join forces to fight against Vortigern, the tyrant king of Britain. Uthr is slain, and Arthur is revealed to be his son and heir to the kingdom.\n\nFrom there, the boy, Arthur, becomes the man, who became the king, who became the legend. He has to fight long and hard to gain his kingdom, and the woman he loves, Gwenhwyfar, daughter of Cunedda. To keep both, he has to fight even longer and harder against those Britons who want a return of the old ways of Rome, against the Picts north of the Wall – and against the Saxons who come, in places willing to make treaties and settle in peace, but elsewhere, determined to fight for the land they want to make their own.\n\nMy Arthur is a down-to-earth realistic man with hopes and fears, with capabilities and flaws. He gets some things right, others he gets wrong. He loves Gwenhwyfar, but their relationship has its ups and downs.\n\nFactual history, my trilogy is not.\n\nBut it is a darn good read!\n\n© Helen Hollick\n\nThe Pendragon’s Banner Trilogy\n\nThe Kingmaking : Pendragon’s Banner : Shadow Of The King\n\nAvailable via Helen’s Amazon Author Page:\n\nhttp://viewauthor.at/HelenHollick\n\nLINKS\n\nWebsite: www.helenhollick.net\n\nNewsletter Subscription: http://tinyletter.com/HelenHollick\n\nMain Blog: www.ofhistoryandkings.blogspot.com\n\nTwitter: @HelenHollick\n\nFollow The Tour here: https://discoveringdiamonds.blogspot.com/p/follow-tour-and-step-back-into-saxon.html\n\nMercedes Rochelle has just published The King’s Retribution, the second book, of her series set in the England of Richard II and I’m delighted to host the penultimate spot on her book’s blog tour.\n\nIf you read A KING UNDER SIEGE you might remember that we left off just as Richard declared his majority at age 22. He was able to rise above the humiliation inflicted on him during the Merciless Parliament, but the fear that it could happen again haunted him the rest of his life. Ten years was a long time to wait before taking revenge on your enemies, but King Richard II was a patient man. Hiding his antagonism toward the Lords Appellant, once he felt strong enough to wreak his revenge he was swift and merciless. Alas for Richard, he went too far, and in his eagerness to protect his crown, Richard underestimated the very man who would take it from him: Henry Bolingbroke.\n\nRecently I caught up with the author to find out a bit more about her take on writing in general and in particular, the historical fiction she writes.\n\nHi Mercedes,\n\nI’m really pleased to have the opportunity to talk to you. Let’s start with an easy question – and one I’m sure you will have been asked before: did you always want to be a writer, or did you just somehow stumble into it?\n\nAnd, if it helps, can you explain why historical fiction in particular?\n\nHi Derek.\n\nThanks for interviewing me. I had an inkling in 5th grade when my teacher (who I can’t remember) gave me special attention, but it wasn’t until my college days that I thought I might give it a serious try. It’s funny, thinking about historical fiction. I was an English major, and at the time I was obsessed with the 19th century novel, without associating it with historical fiction. I was reading Sir Walter Scott, Alexandre Dumas, and Victor Hugo (among others) and I still didn’t “get” the genre. It makes me laugh, now!\n\nIt wasn’t until I discovered Sharon Penman in the ‘80s that I suddenly recognized historical fiction as a real genre, like science fiction or fantasy. And I was well into my first book by then! I admit, by the time I finished my first novel (now called Heir To A Prophecy—after many rewrites) I had gotten the idea, though that’s not how I started the book.\n\nYour most recent books, A King Under Siege, and the new one, The King’s Retribution, focus on the reign of Richard II. Now, he is hardly the most popular, or even a very well-known, king of England – so, what appealed to you about him?\n\nI’ve never been one to take the easy way out! I remember in high school composition, when others were writing about their summer vacation, I tackled Cardinal Richelieu and absolutism in France. Ha! (Of course, I had just finished The Three Musketeers.) Anyway, just like my first novel, I was inspired by Shakespeare. Inspiration is so hard to define, isn’t it? Shakespeare’s Richard II was not a likeable character, but by the prison scene I was captivated. Who was this poignant, tragic figure? I knew absolutely nothing about him (I wasn’t big on history then, either) and filed him in my memory for more than thirty years. But he never went away.\n\nHow did you go about researching the period of Richard II’s reign and what challenges did you face?\n\nRichard II had a bad rap, just like Richard III. No one dared cross the usurper; the victors told the story, and for centuries most historians bought the propaganda without a quibble. Fortunately, 20th century scholars gave it another look, and a less biased, more balanced picture mitigated a lot of misconceptions. It seems that everything Richard did was controversial; sorting out his misdeeds gave me many, many puzzling days. And I still wonder what I’m missing.\n\nI just counted more than 30 books that I read completely through to research these two novels, and I have three large looseleaf binders full of academic journals. The articles are the most helpful because they are so focused. Thank goodness for the internet!\n\nWhat is it about this king that you would want your readers to take away after reading your books?\n\nAlthough King Richard was no angel and it’s difficult to excuse some of his more notorious behaviour, I hope the reader comes to understand that he was a product of his upbringing and the calamity of his formative years. That old expression, “Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,” was certainly applicable to Richard; actually, I can’t think of any child king that turned out well. But to make matters worse, when his uncles should have nurtured him, they rather ground him down—especially his uncle Gloucester, who led the pack that crushed him during the Merciless Parliament and murdered his friends and advisors. I think there’s room for sympathy for a youth thrust into a position of such responsibility, with no role model and no peers.\n\nWhen you write, do you have any special routine? So, for example: Do you always write at a certain time of day? Do you write at home, or in a particular place? Do you like to work in silence – or with music in the background?\n\nI do all my writing at home, in strictest silence. I usually wait until late afternoon after I have spent the day working on my day job (I sell real estate) or marketing (a task that never ends). I have a nice set up in my loft; my desktop computer is where I sit down and do my marketing, and next to it I have my laptop on a bookcase at standing height. I’m up and down all day, but I always try to write on my feet, like Hemingway. It makes me think better!\n\nWhen you write, are you a planner, or do you like to wing it a bit?\n\nOh, I’m definitely a pantser. I feel so much better having learned that Bernard Cornwell is also a pantser! We fly by the seat of our pants. Writing historical fiction, I know how the story is going to progress—and end. But getting there is the challenge. Usually the most critical events are fraught with contradictions, so I encircle myself with my source material and go from book to book until I decide which historian’s opinion makes the most sense. It can take me hours to finish an important scene. Sometimes, even though I might think about an event for months, I really don’t know what I’m going to do until I get there. And then, I never look back!\n\nWhen you are writing, what sort of scenes do you like to write best – action, romance…?\n\nI think my best scenes are the dialog. In Richard’s story, there are many innuendos that need to be sorted through “out loud”. He is known for following a lot of advice, so I let his friends conspire with him.\n\nWhat aspect of the whole writing process do you enjoy most – and least?\n\nI’m one of those people who doesn’t particularly like writing but who loves having written. My favorite part is the research. A new discovery while researching is such a rush to me, I could jump for joy. Sometimes a random comment dropped by a historian reveals a whole new depth to my character. While writing, when my protagonist does something I’m not expecting, I get such a thrill it makes all the drudgery worthwhile. I can only assume it’s something knocking around in my subconscious that I picked up along the way.\n\nThe part I like the least is the segue. I like jumping from climax to climax, but of course that’s ridiculous. You need to give the reader a chance to breathe, and the pace needs to be variable. Much as I hate to admit it, sometimes the segue actually gives the reader some necessary background, if done correctly. I find that I usually don’t give my transitions the attention they deserve until one of my last drafts.\n\nDo you have a character of your own creation that you particularly like – or that you have a great empathy for?\n\nI make up very few characters—none in my Plantagenet Legacy. There are enough real-life people to sort out. The most challenging part is fleshing out a historical person who has been widely ignored. In these books, Thomas de Mowbray needed a lot of extrapolating. For some reason I found very little information about him, even though he plays a critical role in Richard’s reign. I found him to be a sympathetic underdog, though most historians agree he was a slippery character. He did a lot of Richard’s dirty work, yet I think the king underappreciated him. He certainly did not hold up well against Bolingbroke! I felt for the poor guy; he got a bad deal.\n\nYou’ve written quite a number of books now – how has writing changed for you since you wrote your first book?\n\nPractice makes perfect, as they say! I’ve learned to quit worrying about production and quit worrying about making a perfect first draft. I’ve learned to keep going on that first draft, even when it’s not working for me. I’ll even skip a part by making myself a note then moving on. Just get something down. Anything. By the second draft, I understand my characters better and voila! often my problem is solved because I know how they would react to such-and-such a situation. Also, these days I am favoured by beta readers, who make a huge difference; I like to turn my baby over to them after the second draft, and their input makes a huge difference. I never had that “helping hand” before the internet.\n\nAre you a full time writer or only part time?\n\nI’m very fortunate in that I can make my own daily schedule. After that, I think of myself as a seasonal writer. When the weather is great, I go outside in my garden. When the weather is terrible, I’ve got my nose to the proverbial grindstone. In the past, when I neglected my garden to write, I deeply regretted it; after a certain point, it was so overgrown there’s no recovering. So now, I take advantage of beautiful days in the knowledge that there will be plenty of rainy days to make up for it.\n\nAnd, in either case, when you’re not writing, how do you like to spend your time?\n\nI’m so boring. See above.\n\nIf you could write anything you wanted, is there another genre you would choose to write in? Or perhaps you have a lingering idea for a project which you’ve not explored but which never seems to want to go away.\n\nI hate to say it, but I’m stuck on historical fiction! I’m not even sure I could write anything else. Well, straight history, perhaps, but I don’t have any initials behind my name so I would feel like a fraud.\n\nWhat sort of books do you like to read as a rule and what are you reading at the moment?\n\nThe vast bulk of my reading is history and historical fiction. Though I do like to throw in a little Nero Wolfe for levity! Right now I’m reading (and enjoying) “The Shadow Queen” by Anne O’Brien. I had to finish my Richard II books before I picked it up, because I didn’t want to be unduly influenced; the book is about Richard’s mother, Joan of Kent. And for my history, I’m reading Ian Mortimer’s “The Fears of Henry IV” for the third time, in preparation for my next book. Mortimer is very enjoyable, although I have to be careful about his bias. I’ve noticed that he leaves things out that might weaken his argument (he doesn’t like Richard II). But he gives a great overview.\n\nAnd a final, very important and defining, question: what’s your drink of choice? Are you a coffee or tea person, or both – or neither?\n\nOh definitely coffee! I hope you’re not insulted. With a Drambuie chaser.\n\nHa ha! Insulted? No, I’m a dedicated drinker of coffee myself!\n\nThanks for talking to me; it’s always interesting to hear how another writer approaches their craft. I’ve found that a lot of your responses resonate with me – apart from standing up to write!\n\nSo the next question of course is where can you get Mercedes’ new book?\n\nThe King’s Retribution: Book 2 of The Plantagenet Legacy was published on April 1st 2020 by Sergeant Press and is available from Amazon:\n\nAmazon.com: https://www.amazon.com/Kings-Retribution-Book-Plantagenet-Legacy-ebook/dp/B085ZGL7SK\n\nAmazon UK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kings-Retribution-Book-Plantagenet-Legacy-ebook/dp/B085ZGL7SK/\n\nNow, of course, you’ll want to find out more about the author, Mercedes Rochelle, well here’s something to start you off:\n\nMercedes Rochelle\n\nBorn in St. Louis MO with a degree from University of Missouri, Mercedes Rochelle learned about living history as a re-enactor and has been enamored with historical fiction ever since. A move to New York to do research and two careers ensued, but writing fiction remains her primary vocation. She lives in Sergeantsville, NJ with her husband in a log home they had built themselves.\n\nConnect with Mercedes: Website • Blog • Facebook • Twitter\n\nI am delighted to host the very first stop on this Blog Tour for Diana Jackson’s new book: Missing – Past and Present.\n\nI was lucky enough to get hold of a copy of this book just before it came out on February 28th and really enjoyed it.\n\nFirst, here’s what the blurb says:\n\nFollowing the mysterious disappearance of her husband, Dorothy Gibbons, affectionately known as Lady Pink Hat, trudged the lanes around Drumford, homeless and directionless. Alone, she rolled a dice, reflecting on her life, times both painful and pleasant. She stumbled upon The Grange, which changed the course of her life. In her isolation and surrounded by old books Dorothy began to write …\n\nAn 18th Century aspirant nun, Millie, ran away from The Grange …\n\nJamal Hussain, a Syrian refugee and asylum seeker, was fostered under the careful wing of Dorothy until leaving school and finding work. He and his brother settled in a nearby flat until the misguided Ahmed Hussain also disappeared.\n\nWith three missing people, who will discover the truth? Is it Millie who is still haunting The Grange until her story is told?\n\nHere’s how the author sees the book:\n\n“This novel is special to me because it is influenced, in part, by my experience volunteering in a soup kitchen in Bedfordshire and also at a local food-bank here in Fife. My experience as a course team leader and personal tutor at a College of Further Education in the heart of Luton and a teacher of English as a Second Language is also reflected, where I gained valuable insights into social issues and difficulties some young people of today face.”\n\nAnd here’s my take on Missing: Past and Present\n\nMost books I read are full of violent action, but though there is very little such action in this book, I really liked the story of a woman who re-invents herself after a bewildering set of events that almost destroy her.\n\nDiana’s book is easy to read and a little addictive right from the start and that is down to the quality of writing. The first person, conversational style pulled me in as if I was following a thread; and I kept pulling at that thread, never entirely sure where it was going to take me.\n\nIt is an intriguing story and the strength of it lies in the nature of the central character, Dot. I really wanted to know how things turned out for her. Why? Because she’s a victim, but not a pathetic one; she somehow rises above the problems that seek to overwhelm her. She shows courage and determination in spades – and she has that almost indefinable ability to: ‘just get on with it’.\n\nDot is also a character who is easy to identify with – because she is, despite her difficulties, very much of this world. Diana has created a complex character – very practical and worldly on the one hand, yet, as her difficulties reveal, quite blinkered and naïve on the other.\n\nThis book also has a story within a story: the Nun’s Tale, which is where the ‘past and present’ in the title comes in. Writing a story is both cathartic for the character Dot and interesting for the reader. Intertwining the two parallel stories could not have been easy and sometimes perhaps it seems a little forced, but it works. It also enhances the settings of the book and gives it a much broader scope than the contemporary story alone would have provided.\n\nThe story brings in several themes: a love of books; an appreciation of, and interaction with, the simple, everyday things in life – and even with the local wildlife. It also touches on social issues such as interracial relationships, the nature of faith and provision for the poor and homeless. But on all these issues, the book has a light touch and they are skilfully woven into the fabric of the tale.\n\nIt’s a book that is well worth reading.\n\nWhere can you get it?\n\nLook no further than: Amazon: https://books2read.com/u/3LDy2w\n\nNow, of course, you’ll want to find out more about the author, Diana Jackson, and here’s something to start you off:\n\nDiana Jackson\n\nAfter six years in the wilderness, (wandering the Fife Coastal Path and finding her way back to writing, to be precise!) author Diana Jackson is about to launch the second novel in her Mystery Inspired by History series. A retired teacher of sixty one years, Diana Jackson has published five works since 2009. Her first, historical romantic fiction, Riduna, set in the Victorian era, was published by Pegasus Elliot Mc Kenzie in 2009 but was re-launched by Eventispress in 2012 – a writer’s indie collaborative publisher, through which all her other works have been published:\n\n2012 Ancasta, Guide me Swiftly Home ~ Riduna’s sequel\n\n2013 The Life and Demise of Norman Campbell ~ a memoir\n\n2014 Murder Now and Then ~ a mystery set in two time zones, 1919 and 2019\n\n2017 The Healing Paths of Fife ~ a personal fantasy memoir\n\nAfter moving to Fife from Bedfordshire in 2014 Diana has had a break from her life as an author to settle into her new life within the Kinghorn Community. The Healing Paths of Fife tells of that journey. Rejuvenated, she finally turned to finishing MISSING, Past and Present.\n\nPublication date: February 28th 2020 Kindle Release Date\n\nPublisher: Eventispress (21 Feb. 2020)\n\nConnect with Diana: Website • Blog • Twitter • Facebook\n\nAs part of this Christmas season blog hop by members of the Historical Writers Forum, I’ve chosen to revisit a Christmas scene with a difference.\n\nA persistent, though occasional, medieval Christmas tradition was the election by lot of a ‘Lord of Misrule’ to organise the seasonal festivities. This would usually be a peasant or household servant whose temporary role would represent a brief turning of society upside down. This was practised neither universally nor regularly but occurred in some of the noble households. The ‘lord’ would preside over mummers’ plays, singing, dancing and general revelry. Ale and wine flowed pretty freely by all accounts but it was of course only a short term role reversal.\n\nThe Slaughter of the Innocents is known to be one of many mystery plays performed during the latter half of the fifteenth century. It represents the biblical massacre of children by King Herod at the time of the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn the following extract from Kingdom of Rebels, Book 3 of the Rebels and Brothers series, I have put these two Christmas traditions together and, of course, it turns out to be a recipe for trouble…\n\nLady Eleanor Elder and others of her brother, Ned’s affinity have ended up at the castle of their enemy, Sir Thomas Gate – though he does not yet know it. By Christmas they have still not been discovered but they are all desperate to protect Ned’s young son, John Elder. The only resident of the castle who knows their true identities is the priest, Father Baston. Since Sir Thomas is away celebrating Christmas elsewhere, Eleanor hopes for some respite from the fear of discovery.\n\nA constant thorn in her side is a certain Master Weaver – rather an over-mighty servant at the best of times and a nasty piece of work as well.\n\nHere we find Eleanor and her comrades at the Christmas feast overseen by the Lord of Misrule…\n\nWhen evening came there was a mood of good-humoured anticipation as the feast began. Torches burned brightly around the Great Hall and the Lord of Misrule held court at the high table. Eleanor had heard of the custom where one of the servants was briefly ennobled for part of the Christmas season, turning the natural order upside down.\n\n“Shouldn’t we have a say in who the Lord of Misrule is?” she whispered to Bess.\n\nBess shrugged. “Aye, well, it’s Weaver – do you want to argue about it? I know I don’t.”\n\n“I suppose Weaver appointed Weaver,” said Eleanor, “yet… I don’t see him as one to dream up festivities to cheer us all.”\n\nThough all was undoubtedly cheerful and festive, Eleanor knew how much sweated effort had gone into the preparation of the feast. No-one – not even Weaver – normally went out of their way to annoy the cooks. But Weaver’s call for a feast had thrown the kitchens into turmoil. Food was already scarce from the overcrowding and she imagined that the cooks had taken their lord and lady’s absence to mean that no extravagant feasts would be required. But they had reckoned without Weaver, who was revelling in his new position of authority.\n\nAt the high table he dispensed freely the contents of Thomas Gate’s wine cellar and elsewhere in the hall the ale flowed in large quantities.\n\nEleanor sat far from the high table with some of the other members of the household. She drank little ale and took only a small share of the squat, oblong pies of shredded beef. Some of her comrades, however, were indulging themselves fully and she could not begrudge them. But she knew that if she drank too much ale, she would either become loud or morose – possibly both – and, in any case, she could see nothing here to celebrate.\n\nShe was tired even before the mummers’ play began and their theme, the massacre of the innocents, did little to lighten her mood. It was appropriate for the day, she recognised, but the solemn play changed the atmosphere in the hall. Typical of Weaver, she thought, to end a merry feast with a tale of murdered children. The only blessing was that the play was not very long and afterwards the players, sympathetic to their audience, did their best to lift the gloom with a few bawdy songs.\n\nThen Weaver stood up and Eleanor assumed he was going to toast the mummers but he did not.\n\n“Our friends, the mummers,” said Weaver, “have given us our story for this eve – the deaths of those poor innocent children at the hands of the bloody tyrant King Herod. I was speaking about this to our own priest, Father Baston, only this afternoon.”\n\nEleanor felt a prick of alarm at the mention of the priest. She could not quite imagine Weaver discussing King Herod with Father Baston – or anyone else for that matter.\n\n“It’s long been a tradition to choose one child to represent the suffering of all those poor children.”\n\nWhat was Weaver gibbering about? It was a tradition she had never heard of and these drunken sots didn’t want to hear about suffering, they were trying to escape from it.\n\n“Margaret,” called Weaver, “fetch the boy.”\n\nEleanor edged further into the hall as Margaret – one of Weaver’s intimates – lifted John from a corner of the floor where he had been sleeping. He groaned and Bess screamed: “Leave the boy alone!”\n\n“Calm yourself, lass,” said Weaver smiling, “it’s only make believe – like the mummers. The boy will come to no harm.”\n\nOthers chorused their approval and told Bess to sit down. John was wide awake now and went with Margaret to the dais.\n\nEleanor scanned the hall for Hal and found him leaning against the end wall not far from the high table. He looked on, smiling, but he was a poor actor and one look at his tense shoulders told her enough. His hand, she noticed, rested on his knife hilt. Looking around the hall more carefully, she saw that there were several armed men two of whom were by the door, close by her. Closing her eyes, she felt for her knife in the garter around her upper thigh, but it would not be easy to retrieve if she needed it in a hurry.\n\nWeaver had his hand on John’s shoulder now. “What are you called, lad?” he asked.\n\nJohn, undaunted by his rude awakening and the noisy crowd, answered with his customary confidence. “I’m called John.”\n\n“… my lord,” Weaver added, through gritted teeth.\n\n“Do you call me lord?” asked John, in confusion, since he had so far slept through the whole of the Lord of Misrule’s reign.\n\nWeaver gave him a sharp slap around the head. Eleanor saw Hal flinch and take half a pace forward. She too moved a little closer.\n\n“You address me as ‘my lord’,” explained Weaver.\n\n“Do I?” asked John. “Why?”\n\nEleanor held her breath. She doubted Weaver had met many four year old boys but she knew for certain that he had never come across one like John Elder. If he was not careful, John would have him running round in circles. But that would not be good either…\n\n“Enough, boy. Hold your tongue!” snapped Weaver.\n\nA knife appeared in his hand and he brandished it theatrically for the audience. Eleanor suspected that even Weaver would not hurt a child so publicly so she doubted John was in any genuine danger; she just wished that Weaver would get the show over with. It all seemed so pointless and not at all what Weaver was about. And then suddenly it struck her and she knew that all this was not about any ceremony, or entertainment, at all. Somehow Weaver must have found out who had met with Father Baston and now, one by one, he was seeking to flush them all out.\n\nRaising his knife, Weaver played once more to the crowd until John kicked him in the shin. Weaver yelped for, knowing John, he would have kicked as hard as he could. Though Weaver made a wild grab for him, John slipped from his grasp. Many of those watching laughed but Weaver was stung by the insult. He lunged again to catch the boy but John was too quick and made for Hal, who was already heading towards him.\n\n“Grab the little turd!” shouted Weaver. “I’ll skin him!”\n\nJohn hugged Hal around the knees and, as several men closed on them, Hal held out his knife.\n\n“I have him, my lord,” said Hal, “but surely this has gone far enough. He’s just a boy.”\n\n“I’ll judge whether I’ve finished or not!” bellowed Weaver.\n\nChaos had erupted in the hall. Women were screaming and men were shouting. Some called for calm, others for arms. Eleanor, watching Weaver make his way towards Hal, feared that unless she did something, it would end badly for them all.\n\n“Oh, Good Christ, keep me safe,” she muttered, as she pushed forward towards the dais. She elbowed her way to Hal and punched his arm to get his attention.\n\n“Don’t try to help me,” she whispered, as she drew level with him. “Just take the boy out.”\n\n“What are you going to do,” he asked.\n\n“Go!” hissed Eleanor as she passed on towards Weaver. A glance back told her that Hal had lifted up John and was pushing his way towards the door. With a little relief, she took a deep breath and focused on Weaver.\n\n“You!” she screamed at him. “Pisspot! I’ll have words with you!”\n\nSilence fell upon the hall like a hammer blow. When Margaret moved to intercept her, Eleanor gave her a brief smile before slapping her as hard as she could across the cheek. Staggering back a pace, Margaret wiped a smear of blood from her lip.\n\n“You’ll regret that, you bitch!” she snarled.\n\nSweeping past her, Eleanor made straight for Weaver. She raised her hand to strike him next but he was swift – too swift for her. Seizing her arm, he forced her down onto her knees. She glanced towards the door and was pleased to see that Hal and John had disappeared.\n\nWeaver pulled her head down until her lips brushed the cloth covering his groin. Almost overpowered by the smell of stale urine, she swayed back onto her haunches.\n\n“Now that I’m down here,” she cried, “you’re such a disappointment.”\n\nThe audience in the hall loved that but their laughter goaded Weaver into a response.\n\n“Look again!” he roared, grasping Eleanor around the neck to pull her face into his groin.\n\nIt was the moment to concede… to do what he asked… to abase herself… and survive. For an instant Eleanor considered such a course, but only for an instant, for it was not her way. Instead, she thrust her hand between his legs and pulled hard on what she found there. Weaver screamed and cracked her head down against the dais.\n\nWhen she shook her head, a drop of blood dripped onto the wooden boards. The bastard had cut her. Cursing her wilful spirit, she thought about reaching for the knife – but she might need it later; perhaps it was better left hidden for now. All the same, Weaver needed to know that she could give as good as she got.\n\nLifting her head, she smiled to discover that he was still bent almost double. Too late, she saw Margaret swing the jug of wine at her . . . .\n\nAh well, with Lady Eleanor you always get trouble…\n\nI hope you will visit the other posts in this festive blog hop from a group of fabulous writers.\n\nHere are the other contributors:\n\n6th Dec Jen Black https://jenblackauthor.blogspot.com/\n\n9th Dec Jen Wilson Jennifercwilsonwriter.wordpress.com\n\n11th Dec Janet Wertman https://janetwertman.com/\n\n12 Dec Margaret Skea https://margaretskea.com/blog/\n\n13th Dec Sue Barnard http://broad-thoughts-from-a-home.blogspot.com/\n\n14th Dec Cathie Dunn https://cathiedunn.blogspot.com/\n\n15th Dec Lynn Bryant http://www.lynnbryant.co.uk/blog/\n\n16th Dec Samantha Wilcoxson https://samanthawilcoxson.blogspot.com/\n\n17th Dec Nicky Moxey https://nickymoxey.com/2019/12/17/christmas-gifting-in-1181\n\n18th Dec Nancy Jardine https://nancyjardine.blogspot.com\n\n19th Dec Wendy J Dunn http://www.wendyjdunn.com/christmas-at-the-tudor-court-a…/\n\n20th Dec Judith Arnopp https://juditharnoppnovelist.blogspot.com/atudorchristmas\n\n21st Dec Tim Hodkinson http://timhodkinson.blogspot.com/\n\n22nd Dec Vanessa Couchman https://vanessacouchmanwriter.com/blog/\n\n23rd Dec Christine Hancock https://byrhtnoth.com/\n\n24th Dec Paula Lofting https://paulaloftinghistoricalnovel.worpress.com\n\nIn 1228, the monk, Hereticus, talks to Lady Nicholaa de Haye, one of the staunchest defenders of the king and his kingdom, at her manor at Swaton in Lincolnshire, as he gathers information for his forthcoming blockbuster chronicle: The Last days of King John…\n\nLady Nicholaa, you’ve lived a very long life during a most turbulent period of our history, but when you inherited your father’s estates and became castellan of Lincoln castle in 1169, did you ever imagine what you would be required to do to keep your inheritance?\n\nWell no, of course not. I assumed that I would marry, and the husband would do all the duties of the castellan, with me at the hearth, raising the children – and maybe overseeing the management of our own estates. That’s how it is for most women. I never expected to have to defend the castle once, let alone three times! But, needs must, as you know. Just because Gerard – my husband, Gerard de Canville – was away didn’t mean I was going to give up – Gerard left the castle in my care and I wasn’t about to let him down.\n\nWas it your own decision to marry Gerard de Canville? Were you content with the choice?\n\nI took some advice on the matter, of course. If I wanted to keep hold of Lincoln Castle, I knew I would have to marry. Gerard was a sensible choice; good family, good connections. His family had a history of serving the crown, just as mine did and his family lands in Normandy were close to our own de la Haye lands. And, as he was a younger son, he did not have many estates of his own to distract him, so he could concentrate his energies on securing and administering my own inheritance. He was a good choice – we made a good team.\n\nWhat was going through your mind in 1191 when William Longchamp turned up to lay siege to Lincoln Castle?\n\nThat he was not getting MY castle. It had been my father’s and grandfather’s before me and the man was definitely outreaching himself by laying siege to me! I’m not saying I wasn’t nervous – I had never actually been in a siege before, let alone in charge of the castle’s defences, but I wasn’t going to shirk my responsibilities just because that horrible justiciar wanted to give Lincoln to his own man. After six weeks of getting nowhere with the siege, he got the message and left.\n\nOne observer has commented that you defended the castle “manfully” – do you see that as a compliment or an insult?\n\nWell, in my day and age, it is definitely a compliment. These chronicler monks have little to do with women, so have very few comparisons to draw on. In fact, it is a compliment that they mention me at all – the monks do have a tendency to ignore the accomplishments of women.\n\nEr, yes, I suppose… Anyway, in 1193, Richard was your anointed king. Why then did you and your husband support John in his rebellion against his absent brother?\n\nGerard had no choice. We were sworn to John, you see; we had given him our oath and that meant something to us. And many were forced to choose between their divided loyalties, not just us. In the long term, it proved to be the right decision. Even then, many expected John to be the next king, no one wanted to get on his wrong side.\n\nNo, I suppose not and your support of John almost brought about your ruin when Richard returned. That must have been a low point – did you ever expect to regain your lands and responsibilities again?\n\nThat was a difficult time, yes. Kicked out of my beloved Lincoln Castle, spending six years in the ‘wilderness’, but we remained philosophical about it, fortunes rise and fall. We did manage to keep our other lands, though it cost us a fortune (2,000 marks!). I always lived in hope that I would one day be allowed to go home.\n\nWhy did you remain steadfastly loyal to John throughout his reign, despite his reputation as a cruel king?\n\nAh, THE question! I know it is something Sharon has thought long and hard about whilst writing my story. But, honestly, John was always good to me and my family. He stood by us, restored Lincoln Castle to us almost as soon as he came to the throne. I know his reputation, and some of the things he has done, but he has always remained steadfast towards me and I had no reason to betray him.\n\nThough you are a woman, King John placed immense trust in you – why do you think that was?\n\nWell, I did hold Lincoln Castle against all-comers – several times! I am a practical person, and I think John appreciated that. He knew I would get the job done – and I have proven that I don’t flinch when it comes to a fight.\n\nWhy do you think so many of your fellow barons rose in rebellion against John and invited Louis to rule England?\n\nAh, that old saying, ‘the grass is always greener’. I’m sure they all believed it. And many of them – such as Salisbury and Warenne – only went over to the French once they believed there was no way back for John. I’m sure they thought it better to be on the winning side, for the sakes of their family and lands. Now, don’t get me wrong, John made mistakes and something needed to be done, but inviting the French over? Honestly!\n\nWere you disappointed that John gave William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury the right to arrange the marriage of your granddaughter, Idonea?\n\nDisappointed but not surprised. Salisbury is John’s half-brother after all, and John needed to keep him sweet. Politics is all about favours and position these days.\n\nWere you surprised when King John appointed you as Sheriff of Lincoln – surely only a man should hold such a high position?\n\nI think I have proved many times that I am just as capable as any man! John was short of loyal supporters in 1216. The French held London. And there was I, reliable Nicholaa. Seeing as I already held the castle, making me sheriff was a sensible decision, to be honest, and I believe I carried out my duties efficiently.\n\nI’m sure you did! But how do you think King John’s death in October 1216 changed things both for you and the kingdom?\n\nVery little at first. Louis was still in England and still gaining ground. It wasn’t until 1217 that he came to Lincoln to demand I relinquish the castle to him – you can imagine my response! However, it gave the rebels a way to come back into the king’s peace without losing face, didn’t it? Gave them the chance to say, ‘we were against John, not England’. Although, for some, it did take them a little time… Maybe they needed to be sure which way the wind was blowing …\n\nYou held Lincoln Castle against several besieging forces over the years – how was Louis’ siege in 1217 different?\n\nWell, with the 1216 siege I could just pay off the rebels and they went home – I don’t think their hearts were really in it. Louis was more determined – he brought up heavy siege machinery to bombard the castle walls. He came and asked me personally to surrender the castle, promising no one would be hurt. I refused, of course. Having seen off two sieging armies already, I knew I could hold out. I also knew I had to – the French could not get their hands on Lincoln Castle, it was one of the few remaining bastions in England. It was hard, though, especially knowing that the city was against us – I had lived among these people my whole life and they supported the rebels.\n\nWhy do you think William Marshal was so determined to come to your aid and how did you feel when you saw his banners advancing from the north?\n\nWe had been under siege for 6 weeks by that point and the besiegers had kept up a steady pounding of the castle walls for all that time. The city had allied with the rebels. My men were determined, but I was beginning to wonder how long I would have to hold out. I must admit, it was quite a relief to see Marshal’s army on the horizon. I believe he said something in his speech before the battle, about it being dishonourable not to help so brave a lady. He was a chivalrous man, one of the best I have known.\n\nHow did you feel about the terrible slaughter and destruction meted out during and after the battle of Lincoln?\n\nI should say that the citizens brought it on themselves – they sided with the rebels against myself and my garrison. However, it was such a dreadful tragedy, especially for those women and children drowned in the river as they were trying to get away.\n\nThough you seemed happy enough to relinquish Lincoln Castle to John in 1216, when it was taken from you in 1217 you contested the decision. Why?\n\nIn 1216 I was grieving, had just lost my husband and knew that if I relinquished the castle, John would just hand it over to my son, Richard, keeping it in the family, so-to-speak. By 1217 I had my old fight back. Lincoln Castle was mine by right! And I wasn’t going to let that knave Salisbury get his hands on everything that was mine, just because my granddaughter was married to his son.\n\nWhen you faced your darkest hours, what motivated you to hold on, despite the difficulties and dangers you faced?\n\nDuty and family. Lincoln Castle had been my father’s before me and his father’s before him. And was determined to pass it to my son, Richard, or my granddaughter after Richard’s death. I was never going to give it up without a fight – what kind of de la Haye would I be if I did that?\n\nOf all you have achieved in your long life, what gives you the most pride?\n\nKnowing that no one captured Lincoln Castle while it was in my charge. I have a better record of defending against sieges than most men!\n\nThank you, Lady Nicholaa, for your honest and – dare I say – robust answers to my irksome questions. You may be sure that I – though a monk who might be ‘inclined to ignore the accomplishments of women’ – will do all I can to ensure that your bravery will be remembered for a very long time to come.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNicholaa de Haye is just one of numerous medieval women given a new stage in the non-fiction history books written by Sharon Bennett Connolly.\n\nSharon is very generously offering a Giveaway Competition prize of a signed paperback of Heroines of the Medieval World – worldwide offer!\n\nAll you have to do to have a chance of winning this great book – believe me I’ve read it! – is to leave a comment either below on this blog or on my Facebook Author page.

She has studied history academically and just for fun – and even worked as a tour guide at historical sites, including Conisbrough Castle.\n\nBorn in Yorkshire, she studied at University in Northampton before working in Customer Service roles at Disneyland in Paris and Eurostar in London.\n\nShe is now having great fun, passing on her love of the past to her son, hunting dragons through Medieval castles or exploring the hidden alcoves of Tudor Manor Houses.\n\nFor Christmas 2014, her husband gave her a blog as a gift – History … the Interesting Bits (www.historytheinterestingbits.com), allowing her to indulge in that love of history.\n\nSharon started researching and writing about the lesser-known stories and people from European history, the stories that have always fascinated. Quite by accident, she started focusing on medieval women. And in 2016 she was given the opportunity to write her first non-fiction book, Heroines of the Medieval World, which was published by Amberley in September 2017.\n\nShe has just published her second non-fiction book, Silk and the Sword: The Women of the Norman Conquest, and is now working on Ladies of Magna Carta, which will be published by Pen & Sword in May 2020.\n\nSharon’s Links:\n\nWebsite; https://historytheinterestingbits.com/\n\nTwitter: @Thehistorybits\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Thehistorybits/\n\nBuy the books: Amazon UK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharon-Bennett-Connolly/e/B072156Z8V/\n\nAmazon US: https://www.amazon.com/Bennett-Connolly-Sharon/e/B072156Z8V\n\nThere are more character interviews coming up too…\n\nFind out more on the Historical Writers Forum Blog Hop page\n\nN.B. Major – and I mean major! – Spoiler Alert!!\n\nNow that the dust and ash has settled – and there was a hell of a lot of ash to settle! – I feel I should put down a few thoughts on the whole great project that was Game of Thrones. I’ve left it a few days so that I’m not giving a knee jerk reaction to the final series and its outcome.\n\nFirstly, let me say that I read all the books – but, if GRR Martin had decided to ever write the ending, I probably would not have bothered to read it. Though I carried on reading, he lost me round about book 4 when he found that he had dug himself into a bit of a hole. The TV series, however, I have really enjoyed – though I know I won’t be alone in expressing some doubts about series 8 – but more of that later.\n\nGame of Thrones set new standards for a TV series and it deserves to be lauded for doing so. The scripts, the acting, the settings, the cinematography and general production values, especially in the last few series, have all been fantastic. Martin’s characters have been vividly brought to life by a wonderful cast – and, while we wallow in self-pity that it’s all over, let’s not forget the stellar performances of some who perished earlier in the piece – notably Charles Dance and Diana Rigg. For me – and I suspect many others – the standout performances of the series came from Tyrion [Peter Dinklage] and Cersei [Lena Headley] but probably my own personal favourite was Sansa Stark [Sophie Turner] in a less flamboyant – and thus very difficult – role.\n\nThere were many, many wonderful performances, which brings me – with heavy heart – to poor old Daenerys and Jon Snow. In the immediate aftermath of the series I wasn’t sure what I thought about how the story of those two characters played out. But, having tossed it over for a while in my mind, my overall reaction is just immense disappointment, bordering on anger. What a waste!\n\nI don’t think series 8 began badly and, for me, the whole resolution of the war in the north with the dead and the Night King was very well done. But after that, it was as if the writers sat around and said: “Blimey, now what are we going to do?”\n\nI suppose there is an element of genius in what the writers did: i.e. take two characters that the audience love and trash them. Was the idea to shock the viewer in the last couple of episodes as they have done so many times – and so effectively – in the previous series? If so, then it certainly came as a surprise to me and I reckon millions of others! Whatever they had in mind, as many have already said, the ending was deeply unsatisfying. Does it matter? Well, yes, it does, because Game of Thrones was set to be the greatest fantasy series of all time and the programme makers fumbled their final task.\n\nI could live with the way the Lannister twins ended because there was, after all, a certain poignancy at least to it; and too, Arya Stark setting off into the unknown west was both appropriate and satisfying, BUT… almost everything else was dripping with anti-climax. Why bother giving Jon Snow such a labyrinthine backstory if you’re just going to send him off beyond the wall again? I mean, hang on, why is there still a wall anyway and what are the Night’s Watch guarding against? All the wildlings have moved south of the wall and they’re sort of ‘on side’ now so, why have a Night’s Watch at all?\n\nBut, whatever happened to Jon, Daenerys deserved better treatment – far better. The writers might insist that the warning signs of her dark character were there earlier, but there is a hell of a difference between roasting a few unrepentant rebel leaders and immolating an entire city for no apparent advantage. For the story arc, I do think that Daenerys had to die, but her death surely had to be more meaningful and tragic than being put down like a mad dog. To make Jon Snow wield the weapon that killed her might have amused the writers but it didn’t amuse me. I don’t think the dragon was overjoyed about it either – though, in fairness, Drogo the dragon offered more in the way of pathos than any other character, except maybe Tyrion. I think we all saw the melting of the iron throne coming, but what went before was criminal!\n\nSo, let’s move on to the scene where the surviving heads of the noble houses have to decide who should be king. Let me begin by saying that the whole situation at that point is based upon nonsense. I know it’s fantasy but a little consistency and common sense would be nice. Somehow both the Dothraki and the Unsullied – despite incurring massive casualties in previous episodes – seem to have actually increased in number – despite the fact that since neither is from Westeros, they can’t be reinforced. Unless Daenerys has been using a replicator she discovered in an old Star Trek Voyager studio, I don’t see how there would be enough of either group left to fill a small pub. Yet there they are in huge numbers with no other soldiers to be seen.\n\nWhat does it matter you ask? Well, it matters because that scene is dominated by the threat posed by Daenerys’ victorious army – an army that even in a fantasy world must by then have been largely composed of men who were neither Dothraki nor Unsullied. Jon Snow wanders about after King’s Landing as if he has no men at all whereas he actually has an entire northern army. So it’s ridiculous and thus, the whole premise of that scene is garbage. But sadly, the garbage doesn’t stop there, because making Brandon Stark king is the stupidest possible outcome and one that all his previous utterings have made highly unlikely, to say the least. Seers don’t tend to be very effective kings since they spend most of their time in a different world – their role is to advise kings because they can ‘see’ stuff!\n\nThe only bright spot in the scene was Sansa showing her mettle yet again. I wonder if Sophie Turner said to the writers: “I’m not having that shit! If you’re going with Bran as king then I’m taking the north with me!” Sansa, as ever, making the best of a bad job.\n\nI’m all for unconventional stories and breaking new ground and so on, but this felt like a mistake of massive proportions. Jon Snow, the long lost Targaryen heir should have ended up as king after Daenerys was perhaps mortally wounded and her dragon killed in battle. The result is that an epic series that should be remembered for all the great characters and storylines it gave us, will now be forever tarnished by its weak and unsatisfying ending.\n\nTo be honest, I’d rather Drogo had just incinerated the entire seven kingdoms…\n\nSilk and the Sword: The Women of the Norman Conquest\n\nThe Norman Conquest is, I suppose, a period about which we all know at least a little bit. We have heard of Harold Godwinson, William the Conqueror and perhaps Harald Hardrada of Norway – the three men who contribute most to the story of 1066. Some of us who have studied the period a little more closely will be aware of the exploits and influence of other men. We may even know something of several women of the period, but to be honest we won’t know very much. What this book does – and does very effectively – is to give the women of the conquest centre stage.\n\nI think it is exceptionally difficult to look at the events of the 11th century through the eyes of a woman, but Ms Bennett Connolly teases every last detail out of the few tenuous threads of evidence that the women have left us. She does it in a very measured way, for at no point does the reader feel that his credulity is being overstretched. There is always a balance in what is said and how it is expressed. One should not underestimate the skill required to strike such a balance between understating and overstating the role of any individual – male or female – when the evidence is so sparse. This fine judgement is one reason why the book is so effective.\n\nYou would think that, with such limited raw material, all we would end up with is a procession of clone women all doing much the same thing in much the same way. But the writer manages to create distinct individuals and set them in the context of both the events and the society of the 11th century. But she does more than that; she manages to focus in on their individual lives. So, not only do we get a sense of their roles in the state, but we also have an insight into their personal lives in their relationships with their husbands or children in their own households.\n\nPermeating through this book is a recurrent theme of the perilous position of high born women in this period. Often they are merely bargaining counters in the marriage game; frequently a woman of royal or noble birth was married several times and each time was expected to produce a brood of heirs. But we also read of their important role in administration, negotiation and the church.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult task attempted by the author is to lead the reader through the sometimes labyrinthine genealogies of the Saxons – amongst others. The problem is that to have any hope of grasping who a particular woman is, we have to see how she is connected to others. But how do you do that with clarity? The solution in this book is a lot of repetition: rather like saying to the reader this is the sister of ‘so and so’ – you’ll remember ‘so and so’ he was the one who… etc, etc.\n\nThe first couple of times that I encountered this repetition I was unsure about it, but then I saw that it was essential in a book of this scope. Without this ‘hand rail’ of constant reminders, I would have fallen off the mountain of detail because every page brings new characters to the story. The way the book is written enabled me to understand the connections – which are numerous – between the women of the time.\n\nTwo women stand out in the book for me: Emma of Normandy and Gytha of Wessex – those two I found especially interesting, but the strength of the book is also in the other little gems that I was completely unaware of, such as Judith of Flanders and St Margaret of Scotland.\n\nMs Bennett Connolly writes in a clear and interesting style that made the book a pleasure to read, but I also learned an enormous amount about both the women and the events they witnessed and I regard myself as fortunate to have received an advance review copy.\n\nDecember 2018"
