        "text": "SPANISH ORDERS OF CHIVALRY AND DECORATIONS OF HONOUR\n\nBy Harrold E. Gillingham\n\nOf Spain , more than of any other country, is it true that the history of a nation reflects the character of its people. From the very earliest times, religious faith has played a prominent part in the life and in the history of the Spaniards. The oncoming of the Moor left no room for a passive theology—the kings and princes of the Spain of the Middle Ages were literally, and in very truth, \"Defenders of the Faith\". In consequence, and because theirs was so essentially a combination of the religious and the military life, it is not surprising to find many of the Orders of Chivalry originating in the Iberian peninsula during this troublesome period. Nor is it other than might have been anticipated that they gradually disappeared with the suppression of the Arab invaders.\n\nTo trace the story of these Orders is peculiarly difficult. Even in Spain , where the records may still be in existence, the task would be Herculean. Fortunately, for the purposes of this monograph, it is superfluous because it has already been very ably and very admirably done in a volume written by Professor Georgiana Goddard King and published by the Hispanic Society of America, entitled \"A Brief Account of the Military Orders in Spain \". Our concern, herein, is rather with the badges and insignia of these brotherhoods and of those which have followed them, and reference to their history is made only where necessary to make clear facts regarding these emblems.\n\nA further brief word is required regarding our sources. For the earliest orders, the gathering of data and the sifting of conflicting statements regarding origins and reorganizations would be the task of a life-time. The centuries that have elapsed have thrown over such beginnings a veil difficult to penetrate. There is satisfaction, therefore, in finding that the importance of their records was appreciated in the seventeenth century, when the writers were not so removed in point of time from the circumstances which they attempted to fix. Favine in 1620, Ashmole in 1672 and again in 1715, and Giustiniani in 1692, endeavored to gather and sift such material as could be found in their day, and since much of what they wrote is carefully annotated and otherwise bears evidence of careful examination, there is the greater reason for considering it trustworthy. Even then, the writers, again and again, are at a loss. The days when feudalism flourished were given to fighting for existence rather than in writing of what was done. The gathering under one cover of such information as is available regarding the badges of these Orders and of those of a later day, together with the military medals of award, is the object of this volume.\n\nORDER OF THE OAK OF NAVARRE. This is the earliest Spanish Military Order known to us. It was founded in 722 A. D. by Don Garcia Ximines, a French prince and Count of Bigorre , born in 688 and crowned on May 3, 716, as King of Navarre . He succeeded in driving the invading Moors from Navarre and parts of Aragon , and won for himself and his descendant kings the title of \"Most loyal defenders of the Faith.\" He died in 758 after a reign of forty-two years, and was buried at the hermitage of Saint John Baptist de la Pegna, near his castle. He created this order in thankfulness for his great victory over the infidels, and pledged its members to the defense of the Christian faith. While marching against the Moors in the year 722, Ximines saw in a vision a red cross adored by angels, at the top of an oak. The badge is in the form of a verdant oak tree, at the top of which appears a plain red cross. The cross is described by Guistiniani, the Italian writer, as a cross flory. Andrew Favine, the French writer of 1620, gives little credence to the accounts of the establishment of this Order. He states that Garcia Ximines changed the ancient arms of his family and adopted this device.\n\nORDER OF THE LILY OF NAVARRE . This seems to have been created in 1048 by Garcia VI, King of Navarre (1034-1054) in honour of his recovery from \"a languishing sickness\". He dedicated it to the Virgin, hence it is sometimes called the \"Order of Saint Mary of the Lily\". Favine states that effigies of the successors to Garcia, with this order about their necks, may be seen in the churches of St. Mary of Nagera , St. Saviour de Leyra, St. Mary la Reale of Pampeluna , St. John de la Pegna, and at Ronceau. The order disappeared about the middle of the seventeenth century. Giustiniani, Marquez and Perrot give credit for the institution of the order to Sancho IV (1023-1034), and fix the date of its foundation as 1023. They also differ on the form of the badge, a gold collar of two chains, on which the gothic letter M, for Mary, is repeated. From this collar an oval gold medallion with a lily, surmounted by the letter M, crowned, is suspended.\n\nORDER OF SAINT SAVIOUR, also called the Order of Aragon , and Saint Sauveur de Mon- tréal. In 1118, Alphonso I, \"The Battler\", King of Navarre , Aragon , Leon , Castile and Toledo , instituted this order. It consisted of French and Spanish noblemen who had assisted him in his wars. With the conquest of the Moors, the main purpose of the order was achieved; and in the 16th century, its property passed to the Crown. Giustiniani lists the Grand Masters until 1665. Favine says the badge was a red cross, ancrée—sometimes called moline, that is, with the ends divided and turned over.\n\nORDER OF TRUXILLO. While there appears to have been an order of knighthood in Truxillo (Trugillo) in Spain as early as 1227, little information concerning it is obtainable. In that year, Don Arias Perez Dallego, the Master, took Truxillo from the Moors. Pierre Daviti mentions the existence of this order as early as 1213. Ashmole states \"But there is not any Writer that gives an account of what was the Ensign or Badge of the Order\", and Clark holds that they combined with the Order of Alcantara .\n\nORDER OF THE BAND OR SCARF Founded in 1332 by Alphonso XI , King of Leon and Castile (1312-1350), in the city of Vittoria. Favine states that it was instituted in the city of Valencia in 1330; Sansovin gives the city as Burgos , and the year as 1368, while Maigne gives credit to John I and fixes the date as 1390. The order was created as a mark of distinction for those who assisted Alphonso XI in the conquest of the Moors, and only men of noble birth were admitted. The insignia was a red silk band or scarf, worn across the left shoulder and under the right arm. Most of the authorities indicate it as having been shortlived, though Clark states that it was revived in 1700 by Philip V, King of Spain .\n\nORDER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT (also called Order of the Dove). Founded at Segovia in 1390 by John I, King of Leon and Castile (1358-1390), though Favine makes the date 1379, stating that the order was discontinued on the death of the founder. The badge was a gold collar ornamented with curved and pointed rays of the sun. From this a gold and white enamelled dove with eyes and beak of red, was suspended.\n\nORDER OF THE LILY OF ARAGON. Ferdinand of Castile (1379-1416) founded this order in 1403. Favine gives the date as 1410, and calls it the Order of the Looking Glass of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Castile . He states that it was transferred to Aragon in 1413 when Ferdinand received that Kingdom, and that it was continued by the sons of the founder and then abolished. The insignia was a gold collar composed of alternate griffons and pots of flowering lilies. Clark and Giustiniani describe an oval pendant, bearing the image of the Virgin and Child.\n\nORDER OF OUR LADY OF MERCY. James I of Aragon , having been a prisoner of Simon, Earl of Montfort, in France , where he suffered many hardships, vowed if he escaped, to devote his time and energy toward the release of Christian prisoners in the hands of the Moors. This order seems to have been established about the year 1218, some state on St. Lawrence's Day. In 1261, women were admitted to the order. It was combined with the Order of Montesa in 1317, and these two, later, with the Order of Calatrava . The badge is shield shaped, the lower part bearing red and white enamelled stripes (the arms of Aragon ), and the upper part the white cross of the Church of Barcelona , on a red field. The whole is surmounted by a ducal coronet.\n\nORDER OF THE ROSARY OF TOLEDO . Roderick, the Bishop of Toledo , is the reputed founder of this order, in the year 1212. Its object was providing opposition to the Moors, but like most of these orders it had specified religious requirements. The badge is given as a silver and black cross flory, on the centre of which is a gold medallion with the figure of the Virgin holding the Child on her right arm, and with a rosary in the left hand.\n\nORDER OF ESCAMA OR THE SCALE. In 1420 John II (1406-1454), King of Castile and Leon , founded this order to encourage the nobility to war against the Moors. It was discontinued after the death of the king in 1454. The insignia is a red cross with a surface resembling fish scales, hence the name. Why this device was chosen, the historians fail to divulge.\n\nORDER OF JESUS CHRIST, or Order of the Militia of St. Dominic. St. Dominic of the Guzman family of Spain founded this order in Languedoc , France , in 1206, to offset the schism of the heretic Albigenses. It was revived in the sixteenth century in Spain under the influence of the Church, and combined with the Papal Order of St. Peter the Martyr. It flourished in Spain for two centuries but is generally conceded to be strictly a religious order. Various names have been assigned, such as The Militia of St. Dominic, Order of the Cross of Jesus Christ, and Order of St. Peter and St. Dominic. The insignia is an oval of gold surmounted by a crown, on the obverse of which is a cross of four fleur-de-lis joined, each arm being half white and half black. On the reverse is an upright cross, with an olive tree on the left and a sword with point upward on the right. The ribbon is red.\n\nORDER OF THE BATTLE AXE. Founded in 1149 by Raymond Bérenger, Count of Barcelona , to reward the women of Tortosa who, armed with battle axes, contributed largely to the repulse of an attack of the Moors. Little is known of its existence, and the insignia is given as a red battle axe, which the members wore on their cloaks.\n\nORDER OF CONCORD. Credit is given to Ferdinand, (1200-1252), King of Castile and Leon , for the foundation of this order, though Maigne gives the date as 1261 but without record of its insignia. Other writers do not mention it.\n\nORDER OF THE STAR. This is said to have been founded by Alphonso V during his reign from 1416 to 1458. The name is derived from a star worn on the cloak by some of the knights. Little else is known of it.\n\nMILITARY ORDER OF CALATRAVA . Sancho III of Toledo , King of Castile , instituted this order in 1158; it was the first military Order in that kingdom. The castle of Calatrava had been taken in 714 from Rodrigo, King of the Visigoths by the Moors , who held it for over four hundred years. Don Alphonso I of Aragon , recaptured it in 1147 and gave it to the Knights Templars as a bulwark against the infidels. Eight years later, the gift was returned. Sancho (son of Alphonso) gave it and the task of its defense to Don Raymond, Abbot of the Monastery of St. Mary de Fitero, in Navarre . He, with Don Diego of Velasquez, fortified the castle and settled there with associates from Castile and Toledo . Thus arose the Order of the Knights of Calatrava or Militia of Calatrava . The Order was approved by Pope Alexander III, September 25, 1164. Pope Benedict XIII assigned them a \"cross flory\" in 1396. The Mastership of this and of the Orders of St. James of the Sword and of Alcantara , according to Ashmole, were perpetually vested in the crown of Castile in 1523 by Pope Adrian VI . There was but one class of members—Chevaliers, who must be of noble birth. In 1219, the Ladies' Order of Calatrava was instituted by Dona Gazelas Maria Yonnes. The badge is the same as that for the men, a white-enamelled gold-edged diamond on which is a red-enamelled cross fleury, i. e. with fleur-de-lis at the ends; the outer leaves are elongated, to rest upon the arms, and the points turn out. This is surmounted by a trophy of flags and a plumed helmet. The ribbon is bright red watered-silk. Favine says the badge is \"A Red Cross Flouredeluced\".\n\nORDER OF ALCANTARA . The Order of St. Julian of Pereyro was founded in 1176 by Ferdinand II, King of Leon and Galicia . It derived its name from the town in which their first monastery was built. The badge was a green pear tree sewed to their mantles. After Alphonso IX, King of Leon , had captured the Castilian town of Alcantara from the Moors in 1213, he gave it to Don Martin Fernandez de Quintana, Grand Master of the Order of Calatrava . In 1218, the city of Alcantara was given by the Knights of Calatrava to Don Nunno Fernandez, the third Master of the Order of St. Julian de Pereyro and his fellow knights, who then styled themselves the Knights of Alcantara. In accepting the city they became subject to the Order of Calatrava , and changed their cross to what Favine calls \"A Greene crosse Flouredeluced\". This insignia is identical with that of Calatrava , save that the colour is green, as is also the suspension ribbon. This order has but one class—Chevaliers, who must be of the nobility. Pope Adrian VI (1552-1523), granted the revenues of this order as well as those of St. James and Calatrava to the crown of Castile for ever.\n\nORDER OF OUR LADY OF MONTESA, or of St. George. This order was founded in 1316 (or, as some state, in 1317) at Montesa, a city of Valencia , by James II (1291-1327), King of Aragon and Valencia . The knights were subject to the rules of the Order of Calatrava . In 1399, the Order of St. George of Alfama , which had been founded in 1201 at Tortosa , was incorporated into this. Ashmole is the authority for the statement that in 1317 the Order of St. Mary de Merced in Aragon was amalgamated with this Order of Montesa. The badge is diamond-shaped, enamelled yellow, with gold edges and with a plain red-enamelled cross in the center; the whole is surmounted by a trophy of flags and a plumed helmet. The ribbon is bright red watered-silk.\n\nORDER OF CHARLES III. Sometimes called the Royal and Distinguished Order of Charles III or of the Immaculate Conception. The order was formed by the Sovereign of that name on September 19, 1771, to commemorate the birth of his grandson, Charles Clement. Charles III conferred upon the order the vast estates of the house of Ximenes. The order ranks next to the Golden Fleece in importance, and is awarded for merit and service rendered the State. It is sometimes conferred on foreigners. During the reign of Joseph Bonaparte (1808-1815), with the exception of the Golden Fleece, this and all other Spanish Orders were abolished. There are five classes—Grand Cross, Commanders of the first and second class, Officers and Chevaliers. The insignia is a ball-tipped Maltese cross of gold, enamelled in light blue with white edges. In the angles are gold fleur-de-lis. It is surmounted by a gold crown for the Grand Cross, and by a gold laurel wreath for the other classes. The collar is of gold, composed of fourteen castles, fourteen lions, seven ciphers of Charles III, and six enamelled trophies. On the obverse oval medallion, edged with blue, is the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. On the reverse is the cipher of the founder within two laurel wreaths, encircled by a blue band inscribed VIRTUTI ET MERITO. The ribbon is light blue with a white band in the centre. The Grand Cross plaque, of faceted silver, is similar in shape to the cross, with gold fleur-de-lis in the angles, and has a centre medallion of the obverse of the cross and the motto VIRTUTI ET MERITO. The plaque of the Commanders of the first grade is similar in shape and medallion, but with silver fleur-de-lis, while that for a second grade Commander is of silver but with a centre medallion bearing the cipher of Charles III within a laurel wreath.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. II\n\nOrder of Charles III\n\nORDER OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE. Founded at Bruges on January 10, 1429 (or 1430), by Philip le Bon , Duke of Burgundy , on the occasion of his third marriage, with Isabella, the daughter of John I, King of Portugal . The reign of Philip the Good (1396-1467) was a period of luxury and show, of pageant and display. Bruges, that ancient and attractive city of Flanders , whose exchange is the oldest in Europe , was at that time the seat of the Court of the Dukes of Burgundy . The Letters Patent say the order was dedicated to the Glory of God, the Holy Mother, and to St. Andrew the Apostle. Its object was promoting the Catholic religion and exhorting all men to live virtuously. The Greek fable of the Argonauts under Jason, sailing from Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece, is thought to have led Philip to institute the order, but some believe it was the great revenues he derived from the wool trade of Flanders .\n\nThe Order of the Golden Fleece is claimed by Austria as well as by Spain . Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy (1396-1467), married Isabella of Portugal ; their son, Charles the Bold (1433-1477), left but one child, Mary, who, in 1477, married Maximillian I of Austria , a Hapsburg and Holy Roman Emperor. Their son Philip (1478-1506), who married in 1496 the Infanta Joanna of Spain (Joan la Loco, the crazy, the second daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile ), thus became later, Philip I of Castile and Aragon . His son Charles (1500-1558) was Charles I of Spain and also Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire. Charles V relinquished the Austrian throne to his brother Ferdinand, having in 1556 assigned the Spanish kingdom and the Netherland provinces to his son Philip II of Spain (1527-1598), to whom he gave the Grand Mastership and treasures of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Since that time the Kings of Spain have claimed the order, while the Hapsburgs of Austria claimed the sovereignty under one of its statutes, which says of the Order, \"dont serons nous chef et souverain et aprés nous nos Successeurs, Ducs de Bourgogne.\" While the territories of the Dukedom of Burgundy went to France , the title has been retained by the Hapsburg family without territorial claim. After the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, Philip le Bel, the son of his only child, Mary of Burgundy , wife of Maximillian I of Austria , became the Grand Master of the Order. The sovereignty of the order remained in dispute between the house of Hapsburg and the Kings of Spain , until Charles II died childless in 1702. Philip V of Spain , a Bourbon and the grandson of Louis IV of France , at this time claimed the Grand Mastership of the Order, and after a long dispute the question was referred to the Congress of Cambrai in 1721, when the Order was recognized both for Spain and Austria and each portion independent of the other. Since the World War, King Albert of Belgium laid claim to the treasures of the order, in the name of the cities of Bruges , Brussels and Ghent , but this was rejected by a committee of three jurists, to whom the question had been referred by the Reparation Commission and which approved the decision of the Committee. The archives and treasures of the Order remain in Vienna , where they had been transferred from Brussels in 1700 by Charles VI, Emperor of Austria , owing to the French wars. The Spanish order is never given to an Austrian nor is the Austrian order awarded to a Spaniard.\n\nThe order has always ranked as the most illustrious and distinguished order of Spain ; it was the only Spanish order which was not abolished by Joseph Bonaparte in 1808, and was actually confirmed by him in 1809. \"The Duke of Wellington was created a grandee of the first class of the Spanish Order of the Golden Fleece, with the title of the Duke of Cuidad Roderigo, and appointed Captain General of the Spanish Armies. His Grace had two badges, one formerly worn by Emperor Charles V , and the other presented to him at Madrid by the Countess de Chincona, a princess of the Royal house of Bourbon , having been originally the property of the Duc\". 1 The insignia of the order is a Golden Fleece suspended at the middle, from a blue-enamelled flint-stone, emitting flames of fire, enamelled red, which in turn is hung from a scroll and medallion. The ribbon is bright red. The grand collar of the order is alternate flint-stones enamelled blue with red flames and double fusils or firesteels interlaced to represent double B's for Burgundy . The insignia of the Keeper of the Rolls (Le Greffier) is an oval medal of gold (55 mm x 45 mm) composed of rays with twelve gold balls on alternate bars; with a white-enamelled oval in the centre, on which is a miniature of the badge, encircled by a red-enamelled band looped at the top. This oval is surrounded by a pointed border of gold, and the decoration is suspended by a bright red ribbon. The insignia of the Austrian order varies at the top and has, on a scroll, the motto Pretium non vile laborum (Not a bad reward for labour).\n\nORDER OF ST. JAMES OF THE SWORD (Santiago di Campostella). In 1175 this order and the rules governing it were sanctioned by a bull of Pope Alexander III. From this document we learn that its organization had taken place in 1170. There is also, however, evidence that this may have been a reorganization, and that the rather uncertain traditions which assign the be- ginnings of the Order of Santiago to more than a century before this, have some basis. 2 Whatever may have been the statutes or the purposes governing the earlier order, after 1170 its knights took a prominent part in repelling the Moor and in upholding the faith. With the passing of the years, and with the repression of the Moors, the wealth of the order increased greatly, as did also the fame and prowess of its members. In these regards it rivalled the other Spanish orders such as that of Alcantara . In 1493, its property was claimed for the Crown by Ferdinand and Isabella. Membership was limited to the nobility, and in 1312 some provision for the admission of noble-women was made.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. III\n\nOrder of Saint James of the Sword\n\nThe badge of the Order is of enamel, a white oval, edged with gold, on which is a red cross, the arms of which terminate in fleur-de-lis, the upper part of the upright being heart-shaped, the lower shaped like a sword. The oval is surmounted by a gold trophy of flags and plumed helmet, the whole suspended by a bright red ribbon of watered-silk. Portugal has an Order of St. James of the Sword, of which Favine says, 3 \"This Order St. \"James was Established likewise in Portugall , \"where it attained to many Commanderies, confessing Ucles to be Chiefe of the Order: until \"the time of the King of Portugall Dom Denys, 4 \"who would have a Great Maister and Chiefe \"of the Order alone in his owne Kingdome, with-\"out any subjection to that of Castile .\"\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. IV\n\nRoyal Order of Maria Louisa\n\nROYAL ORDER OF MARIA LOUISA. Founded on April 19, 1792, by Charles IV (1748-1819) and named in honour of his Queen, Maria Louisa of Parma . The order has but one class and is conferred by the Queen on ladies only. It is under the patronage of Saint Ferdinand. The insignia is a gold Maltese cross, enamelled white with wide violet edges. Between the angles are the alternate towers and lions of Castile and Aragon , connected by gold chains. A gold laurel-wreath surmounts the cross. The obverse medallion bears the effigy of St. Ferdinand in royal robes, and crowned. The reverse has the cipher of the Queen, M. L. surrounded by the legend REAL ORDEN DE LA REYNA MARIA LUISA. The ribbon is violet with a centre band of white.\n\nROYAL ORDER OF SPAIN . This was established in 1809 by Joseph Bonaparte to reward those who were loyal to the Napoleonic cause. It was abolished in 1814 by Ferdinand VII upon his return to the Spanish throne. There are three grades: Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers. The insignia is a five-pointed red-enamelled star, ball tipped, and edged with gold. On the gold obverse medallion is the tower of Castile , encircled by a blue band inscribed JOS. NAPOLEO REX HISP ET IND. On the reverse medallion is the lion of Aragon within a blue-enamelled band inscribed VIRTUTE ET FIDE. The ribbon is bright red. The plaque is an eight-pointed star of faceted silver rays, on which is a five-pointed red-enamelled star, with a gold lion rampant at the centre.\n\nTHE RED CROSS. Founded on July 31, 1864, by Royal Decree. It is divided into three classes: the plaque of honour and merit, the medal of gold and the silver medal. The plaque is an eight-pointed silver-faceted star on which is superimposed a white-enamelled gold-edged Maltese cross, with a gold crown above, and gold castles and facing lions' heads in the angles of the cross. In the medallion is the red-enamelled Geneva cross encircled by a black band with gold letters, OB:CIVES:SERVATOS. The gold medal is composed of eight-pointed rays of gold surmounted by a gold mural crown. In the centre of the rays is a red cross on a white medallion, encircled by IN HOC SIGNO SALUS. This, in turn, is surrounded by a green-enamelled wreath; and under the white centre is a gold shield bearing a white-enamelled Maltese cross. The gold medal is worn suspended from a neck ribbon of white with a wide red stripe in the centre. The silver medal is round with a mural crown above and partly resting on the medal. In the centre is the red Geneva cross on a white shield, encircled by a green laurel wreath; around this, on a white band, is IN HOC SIGNO SALUS, in gold letters. At the lower part and under the shield is a shield of gold bearing a white Maltese cross. This medal is worn, with a white ribbon with wide red stripe in the centre, and suspended from a gold bar-pin.\n\nROYAL AND MILITARY ORDER OF SAINT HERMENEGILDO . Founded on November 28, 1814, by Ferdinand VII . It is awarded to officers of the Army and Navy for long and distinguished service. The Saint for whom the order was so appropriately named was the son of Leovigild , the last of the Visigothic kings holding to Arianism. Hermenègildo, being converted to orthodox Christianity by his Frankish wife, headed an unsuccessful insurrection. When captured, he refused to abjure his faith, and was executed. He was canonized by Sixtus V during the reign of Philip II . There are three classes: Grand Cross, and Knights of the First and Second Classes—awarded according to rank and length of service. The badge is a white-enamelled gold cross, patté, surmounted by a royal crown. On the obverse medallion of blue enamel is a gold figure of Hermenègildo on horseback, surrounded by a blue band inscribed PREMIO A LA CONSTANCIA MILITAR. On the reverse medallion of gold is F.VII. The ribbon is white with a carmine band in the centre (formerly it was of violet with two white stripes). The plaque is a large Maltese cross, ball-tipped with silver rays in the angles. In the centre is a replica of the above obverse medallion, save that the band with the inscription is enamel, surrounded by a laurel wreath. This order was conferred upon the Duke of Wellington in 1816, by the King of Spain .\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. V\n\nThe Red Cross\n\nROYAL AND MILITARY ORDER OF SAINT FERDINAND. At a meeting of the Cortes held at Cadiz on January 27, 1811, during the attempt to free Spain from the French domination, it was proposed to institute the Order of the Sword of Saint Ferdinand. On August 31 of that year, the National Order of Saint Ferdinand was adopted. The name was again changed on August 29, 1814, to the Military Order of Saint Ferdinand; and on January 19, 1815, the Royal and Military Order of Saint Ferdinand was founded by the King, Ferdinand VII , and dedicated to Ferdinand II (1200-1252), whose body lies buried in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Seville . The order was reconfirmed by a decree of June 29, 1918, issued by Alphonso XIII. The decoration is awarded for exceptional military or naval service, to officers and enlisted men. There are five classes: the first and lowest consists of a gold Maltese cross, ball-tipped, of white enamel, bearing on the obverse medallion a figure of St. Ferdinand, surrounded by a blue band inscribed AL MERITO MILITAR. The reverse has two globes, crowned, surrounded by a blue band inscribed EL REY Y LA PATRIA. The various classes of this order are issued in several forms. The lowest, or first class, has the cross superimposed on a laurel wreath and surmounted by a similar wreath for suspension. The second class is without the laurel wreath above, the third class is like the first, and the fourth class has an ornamental leaf design above and is not superimposed on a wreath. The fifth or highest class is a plaque of faceted silver rays forming the cross superimposed on a green laurel wreath, with the figure of St. Ferdinand in the centre, encircled by a band inscribed AL MERITO MILITAR. The plaques of the second and fourth classes have four red-enamelled swords, with handles meeting in the centre, the blades forming a cross. There is also a small silver cross for privates, which does not class them as Knights. Another form of this decoration, awarded during the reign of Queen Christina and still given to Generals and other high officers, is styled the Cross of Saint Ferdinand and is composed of four swords with gold handles and red-enamelled blades. The handles meet at the centre with the guards forming a circle, while the blades make the arms of the cross. This is also issued superimposed on a green laurel wreath, but no authority for this variation has been found. The ribbon for this decoration is bright red with a yellow stripe each side.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. VII\n\nRoyal and Military Order of Saint Ferdinand\n\nThe highest class decoration of this order was presented to the Duke of Wellington on April 29, 1812, by the Cortes of Spain , and later in that year they bestowed on him the estate of Soto de Roma in Granada, \"in the name of the Spanish Nation in testimony of its sincere gratitude\". The decoration was also awarded to other British officers who assisted Spain during the Carlist wars.\n\nORDER OF ISABELLA THE CATHOLIC, often called the Royal American Order of Isabella the Catholic, was founded on March 24, 1815, by Ferdinand VII , as a reward for loyalty either in the kingdom or in the American colonies of Spain . Later it was awarded for merit. It was placed under the patronage of St. Isabella (1451-1504), surnamed la Catolica, Queen of Castile and wife of Ferdinand of Aragon . It was during the reign of Isabella the Catholic that Columbus discovered America, and during the reign of Ferdinand VII , the founder of this order, that Florida was sold to the United States (1819), and that most of the other American colonies were lost to Spain . One of the objects in establishing this order, apparently, was to reward certain of the American colonial officials and dignitaries.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. VIII\n\nCross of Saint Ferdinand\n\nReign of Queen Christina\n\nThere are five grades: Grand Cross, Commanders with plaque, Commanders, Chevaliers and Chevaliers of the Silver Cross. The insignia is a red-enamelled Maltese cross, indented at the extremities, with wide-edged gold borders and ball-tipped points, surmounted by a green laurel wreath, and with gold rays in the angles. On the obverse medallion are the pillars of Hercules 5 inscribed PLUS ULTRA, and two blue globes crowned, surrounded by a white band inscribed A LA LEALTAD ACRISOLADA.\n\nOn the reverse medallion is FR 7 crowned, within a white band inscribed POR ISABEL LA CATOLICA. The cross of the fifth class is all silver and with no rays in the angles and no enamel. The plaque of the first class is similar to the obverse of the cross, minus the laurel wreath, with gold rays in the angles and with both the above mottoes on the encircling band. The plaque of the second class is smaller and has the cipher of the reigning monarch in the centre. The ribbon is white with broad yellow lateral stripes.\n\nSome authorities state that a silver medal of the order was given to a number of the American Indian subjects, though this is not confirmed. A sixth class was instituted in April, 1907, by Alphonso XIII, consisting of silver and bronze medals, 32 mm. in diameter, bearing on the obverse a replica of the cross without the rays, and on the reverse the crowned monogram of Ferdinand VII .\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. IX\n\nOrder of Isabella the Catholic\n\nTo judge from the varieties of this decoration, they were very generously bestowed and not very highly valued.\n\nORDER OF MARIA ISABELLA LOUISA or ISABELLA II. Founded on June 19, 1833, by Ferdinand VII , in honour of his daughter by his fourth wife, Maria Christina of Naples . Its purpose was to reward men of the Army and Navy who were loyal to the Infanta, the presumptive heiress. As Ferdinand had no sons, he abolished the Salic law in Spain about 1830, and at his death in 1833, Maria Isabella Louisa was proclaimed Queen. The Carlist war resulted. For officers, the decoration is a white-enamelled cross moline, with a gold crown above. On the obverse medallion, in a red-enamelled field, is a gold bust of the Queen encircled by a blue band inscribed ISABEL II REINA DE ESPANA. On the reverse, in a red field is M. I. L. encircled by a blue band inscribed AL VALORE MILITAR. The cross for non-commissioned officers is of silver, bearing on the obverse an oval medallion with the initials M. I. L. The reverse is plain and the ribbon is light blue. After 1839, the decoration was awarded for service in the Army or Navy of ten years or over. Many of these decorations were awarded to the detachment of Royal Artillery and Marines, who formed part of the British volunteer forces under General Sir De Lacy Evans K.C.B., who in 1835 was sent in command of the \"Spanish Legion\" of ten thousand troops, to aid the Queen against Don Carlos. Evans remained two years and gained several brilliant victories. The cross in silver was also given to the British men for service at San Sebastian on May 5, 1836, and at Bilbao on December 24, 1836.\n\nORDER OF MILITARY MERIT. Maria Isabelle Louisa (Isabelle II) was dethroned in 1868 as a result of the Civil War. The attempt of the Carlists to secure the throne was a continuous source of trouble during her reign of thirty-five years. In order to reward her adherents, Isabella founded this order on August 3, 1864, for the military and civilians and for deeds not of sufficient importance to warrant the conferring of higher orders. It was reconfirmed on December 30, 1889, and is now awarded for individual merit in military operations to officers and soldiers and also to civilians.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. X\n\nOrder of Maria Isabella Louisa\n\nThe decoration is a plain gold-edged, red-enamelled cross surmounted by a royal crown, the upper arm of which is partly plain. In this plain space is engraved the action and date for which the award is made. The circular medallion bears the Arms of Spain with a Bourbon shield in the centre. The reverse medallion bears the initials of the founder, Y 2, and sometimes those of the reigning sovereign. When awarded to pensioners and for services not in actual combat, the cross is red with a white band on each cross-arm. The ribbon is red with a white stripe in the centre when awarded for war service. For the troops, the cross is all silver with no enamel and the ribbon is white with a red centre.\n\nThe plaque is an eight-pointed star of faceted rays on which is a duplication of the obverse of the cross with fleurs-de-lis in the angles and a crown on the upper cross-arm instead of surmounting it.\n\nORDER OF NAVAL MERIT. This was founded August 3, 1866, for the men of the Navy under conditions similar to those of the Order of Military Merit. The decoration is similar, except that the lower cross arm is longer, and in place of the medallion a gold anchor is superimposed. The ribbon is red with a broad yellow stripe in the centre. The cross for Pensioners has a white stripe on each of the arms and the ribbon is white with a blue stripe in the centre.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. XI\n\nOrder of Military Merit\n\nAnother cross of Merit for the Navy was founded September 22, 1816, to be given to those who took part in the War of Independence of 1808, and a description will be found under the decorations for that period.\n\nORDER OF CIVIL MERIT. This resembles the cross of Military Merit, except that the enamel is white and the ribbon is white with a red stripe in the centre.\n\nORDER OF AGRICULTURAL MERIT. This was founded on December 1, 1905, by Alphonso XIII, for those eminent in agriculture. There are three grades: gold with a green ribbon, silver with a green and silver ribbon, and copper with a green knot of ribbon, according to the nature of the award. The decoration is a white-enamelled Maltese cross, double-pointed and ball-tipped, in the centre of which is a medallion with the symbols of agriculture. On the reverse is engraved the name of the recipient, the date and cause of award.\n\nORDER OF BENEFICENCIA. Founded on May 17, 1856, by Isabella II (1830-1904), daughter of Ferdinand VII , in recognition of humane and charitable work. Some authorities give Ferdinand VII credit for its recreation in 1820 at the time of the cholera epidemic in Manila, but that decoration differs materially (See page 88). There are three grades for the Order of Charity: Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers, and these are awarded both to men and to women. The decoration is a six-pointed, ball-tipped star, enamelled white with black edges; gold rays are in the angles, and the whole is surmounted by a palm wreath. In the centre red medallion is a gold figure of Charity with children, surrounded by a band, on which is inscribed A LA CARIDAD. The medallion on the reverse has in the centre the cipher of the founder Y 2 surrounded by the words BENEFICENCIA PUBLICA. The ribbon is white with a black band on each side. The plaque of the first class consists of the six-pointed star as above described, superimposed on a gold laurel wreath and rays of faceted silver.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. XII\n\nOrder of Beneficencia\n\nCIVIL ORDER OF ALPHONSO XII. This order was founded on May 23, 1902, by King Alphonso XIII in honour of his father who died in 1885. Alphonso XIII (Leon-Ferdinand-Marie-Jacques-Isidore-Paschal-Antoine) the posthumous son of Alphonso XII and Marie Christine (Arch-Duchess of Austria ), was born in Madrid on May 17, 1886, and proclaimed King of Spain on the day of his birth. His mother ruled as Regent during his minority, and he is the only surviving ruler of that once powerful Bourbon family from which so many European kings have sprung, and who have held such power in the politics of the continent.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. XIII\n\nCivil Order of Alphonso XII\n\nThe order is bestowed for literary and artistic merit and is composed of three classes: Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers. The badge is composed of rays of violet enamel, on which is a radiant disc representing the sun. Superimposed thereon and within a gold palm and green laurel wreath, is an eagle with spread wings. Above the eagle is A XII, crowned—below, ALTIORA-PETO and a shield bearing the Arms of Spain . The ribbon is violet. The plaque is similar to the badge but larger, and the Commanders wear a large violet silk button on their ribbon.\n\nROYAL ORDER OF MARIA CHRISTINA. Founded by Alphonso XIII on July 19, 1889, for the Army, and in January of the following year for the Navy. It was discontinued on June 19, 1918, but reinstated March 16, 1925. It is to reward distinguished individual merit, and when given to Generals or Colonels is all gold; for Majors and Lieutenant-Colonels, it is of silver and gold, and for junior officers and enlisted men, it is of bronze and gold. The decoration is a plaque of faceted rays on which is superimposed a cross with laurel wreath entwined and four swords with hilts outward. The arms of the cross have curved ends and bear on the upper arm a gold crown; on the others, a gold fleur-de-lis. In the centre are the Arms of Spain in colour, surrounded by a blue band inscribed AL MERITO EN CAMPANA. The cross is similar to the plaque but smaller, and the ribbon is red and yellow with a white stripe on each side, and carmine edges.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, there were many other decorations established and bestowed upon the Army, Navy and civilians for their efforts to support the throne of Spain . These are given below in order of the events. It will be noticed that many of them were not founded until long after the occurrences for which they were bestowed. In probably no other country have there been so many decorations given for military service and of so great a variety. It seems as if the designers of these have vied with each other in making each new decoration entirely different from its predecessor.\n\nCROSS FOR SAPPERS AT ALCALA DE HENARES , 1808. Founded on October 1, 1817, and awarded to the two Companies of Sappers and Engineers under General Legues, who, at the beginning of the French invasion after the events at Madrid in 1808, refused to serve under the French, and assisted in saving the flags, the military stores and arms of the first division, and in escaping from Alcalá de Henares on May 2, 1808, and fleeing to Sierra de Cuenca .\n\nThe decoration is a gold cross ball-tipped and enamelled red, with blue triangles of enamel at the ends of the cross arms, and the whole surmounted by a royal crown. A white medallion in the centre bears six mountain peaks, from one of which flies a white flag bearing the letters Z. M. P., the initials of Zapadores (sappers), Minadores (miners) and Pontoneros (pontoon men). This is encircled by a white band inscribed MI LEALTAD Y VALOR TE CONSERVARON. On the blue reverse medallion is SALIDO DE LOS ZAPADORES MAYO DE 1808. The ribbon is bright red.\n\nCROSS FOR VALENÇAY 1808. When Ferdinand VII was sent to Valençay (Indre) by the French in May, 1808, he was accompanied by a number of faithful adherents. He remained in the home of Talleyrand for five years, returning to Spain in March of 1814, when Napoleon's Empire was tottering. On August 23rd of that year, he instituted this decoration for those who had gone with him into exile. It is a blue-enamelled Greek cross surmounted by a gold crown. On the ends of the cross and in the angles are gold flames, and on the blue-enamelled medallion is a gold head of the founder surrounded by a white band inscribed FER NAN DO 7o 1814. The reverse medallion of light blue has in the centre a dog, of gold, beneath which is FIDES, surrounded by two chains and VALENÇAY 1808. The ribbon is violet.\n\nSPANISH DECORATIONS\n\nPl. XIV\n\nSappers at Alcala Alcolea\n\nSt. George Bailen\n\nCROSS FOR ADHERENTS OF THE KING. The Spanish subjects who by their loyalty to the king, incurred the displeasure of Don Manuel Godoy, the Prince of Peace, were interned by him in the Chateau of St. Laurenzo. To honour these loyal subjects, Ferdinand VII founded this decoration on December 5, 1814. It is a white-enamelled cross moline with gilt balls in the angles, and surmounted by a green laurel wreath. On the blue medallion encircled by a red band is a golden grid and a palm. The reverse medallion of blue is inscribed POR EL REY / PREMIO / A LA INO / CENCIA.

Ferdinand VII created this by Royal Decree on November 6, 1814, as a reward to those who were taken prisoner by the French during the war for Independence. By a later Decree of November 5, 1900, it was awarded to all who were captured during the Cuban and Philippine war, and by a Decree of July 7, 1921, for those wounded in the service or captured in meritorious action.\n\nIt is issued in gold for officers and cadets, in silver for others, and is 32 mm. in diameter. In the centre is a castle tower surrounded by the inscription SUFRIMIENTO POR LA PATRIA, around which is a chain within two narrow lines; the whole being encircled with a laurel wreath which forms the edge of the medal. The ribbon is yellow, with narrow green stripes at each side, for those captured; and for the wounded, a red cross is embroidered on the ribbon.\n\nCROSS FOR CIVILIANS IN FRANCE .

The French troops under General Dupont outclassed the natives, who retired defeated. On June 3, 1815, the cross was authorized by Ferdinand VII . It was of gold for the officers, and of silver for the privates who had distinguished themselves in this engagement. It consists of two crossed logs in the form of a St. Andrews Cross, enamelled red, surmounted by laurel and palm branches tied with a ribbon, and with a tassel below. On the obverse medallion of white is a triple-arched bridge, around which in gold letters is LA BATALLA DE ALCOLEA . The reverse medallion is inscribed LIBERTAD DE ESPANA 7 DE JUNIO 1808.

Dupont was on his way to Cadiz and was hampered at every turn by the Spaniards who bitterly resented the Napoleonic domination. This was after the Little Corsican had placed his brother Joseph on the throne and incarcerated Ferdinand at Valençay (Indre).\n\nThe decoration is an oval gilt medal, having in the centre two crossed swords tied with a ribbon, from which hangs an inverted eagle. In the upper part of the field is a laurel wreath and a scroll which bears the legend BAILEN 19 DE JULIO 1808. The ribbon is red with a yellow stripe in the centre.\n\nCROSS FOR SARAGOSSA 1808-1809. Ferdinand VII authorized this cross on August 30, 1814, for those who had distinguished themselves in the defense of Saragossa in Aragon from June 16 to August 14, 1808, when the Spaniards under Don Jose De Palafox and Calvo di Rozas, defeated the French troops under Marshal Lefebvre who was compelled to retreat to Pampeluna. When the French again attacked the city in December, 1808, the Spanish were compelled to sur- render on February 20, 1809, after having lost nearly 60,000 men. The Maltese cross, of gold for officers and of bronze for the soldiers, is red enamelled with broad ends surmounted by a mural crown, and bears on an oval white medallion, within a laurel wreath, a figure of St. Mary on a pedestal. On the blue reverse medallion is EL REY A LS. DEF DE ZAR (The king to the defenders of Saragossa ). The ribbon is yellow with four narrow red stripes.
