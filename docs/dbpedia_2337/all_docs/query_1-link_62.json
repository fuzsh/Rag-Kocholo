But being written in Hebrew, it was accessible to only a relatively small number of readers outside of Israel. There was a manifest need for a translation into one of the more widely used languages. The Jewish Publication Society was proud to undertake this task. The first draft of the translation was based on the first edi­ tion of the work, which appeared in two volumes (Am Oved, Tel Aviv, 1945). When the second edition appeared, somewhat revised and published in a single large volume (1959), the Eng­ lish translation was revised accordingly. This volume may, therefore, be regarded as a translation of the second edition. Here and there—principally in chapter VII of this book—the text has been slightly abridged, with the approval of the au­ thor. Elsewhere, on the other hand, principally in the notes, the translation contains material not found in either of the Hebrew editions but supplied by the author to the translator (e.g., pp. 384–8). v\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only. To purchase your own copy of the book with enhanced functionality go to www.publishersrow.com\n\n<< Chapter >>\n\nHome | TOC | Index\n\nA point of major interest in the book is the author’s frequent quotation, both in the text and in the notes, from Hebrew sources of Hispano-Jewish history, especially in the sections dealing with its social and economic aspects. These quotations, some of them quite long, cover a wide range of literature and include selections from rabbinic responsa, ethical treatises, works of mysticism and theology, polemics, poetry and other literary expressions of Jewish life. With very few exceptions, all such quotations are here translated into English for the first time. The chapter divisions of the English translation differ slightly from those of the Hebrew original. The long chapter III of the first and second Hebrew editions is represented by chapters III, IV, V and VI of the translation. The first part of chapter IV of the Hebrew version is here included as chapter VII. The translation of this book was an arduous task. Expert knowledge of Hebrew and English had to be supplemented with knowledge of Aramaic, in which some of the quotations are couched, and of both Arabic and Latin which left traces on Spanish Jewish life. Nor was this enough, since a translator of this book had to be fully conversant with both Spanish and Jewish history. Dr. Louis Schoffman, of Brooklyn College, pos­ sesses all these qualifications to an eminent degree. The Jew­ ish Publication Society wishes to express to him its whole­ hearted thanks, as does the author, who checked on the trans­ lation and approved it. Thanks are also due to Miss Lotte Levensohn who has pre­ pared a preliminary draft of Part Two of the work. Chapter VII of this volume is based largely on her draft. The quota­ tions, however, found in this chapter, and all the notes were translated by Dr. Schoffman. Mr. Bernard Sandler prepared the index to this volume. It is limited to personal and place names; a complete index will appear at the end of Volume Two.\n\nvi\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

It is a story that occupies a distinguished place in the annals of our people, covering, as it does, a period which is virtually the only one in the entire history of the Diaspora—with the ex­ ception of modern times—that we are able to study in its entirety, throughout all the stages of rise and decline. Out of the great treasury of historical documents, preserved in the archives of Spain, we reconstruct the successive tiers of his­ torical facts, and through the prism of the Hebrew literature written during this period we look into the minds of the bearers of that history. For they were men who were able— to the extent possible in those days—to grasp the meaning of their destiny and to give expression to the thoughts that filled their hearts. Modern historiography is inclined to re­ gard the history of the Jews in Christian Spain as a sequel to the Golden Age of Hebrew and Judaeo-Arabic culture which preceded it; and, to be sure, the period with which we are concerned cannot be properly understood without refer­ ence to the former. Our period, however, differs from the one which preceded it in its specific political and religious prob­ lems. The contest between Judaism and Christianity, which the Middle Ages inherited from ancient times, took on here more poignant form than anywhere else. History brought one of the most creative Jewish commu­ nities of the Diaspora into collaboration with one of the most gifted peoples of Christian Europe, the Spaniards. Far-reaching historical developments, affecting both groups, carried this association to dramatic heights and brought it to a tragic end. The war against their Moslem neighbors caused the Spaniards to become at once the most tolerant and the most fanatical people in medieval Christendom. The political ob­ jectives of the Reconquest opened up to the Jews broad op­ portunities for outwardly directed growth, but its religious 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The internal conflicts and external pressures, engendered by these conditions, are akin to the trials which beset our people today. The medieval Jew lived in a time midway be­ tween the original creative epoch of the national genius and the modern period of disintegration of traditional values. He entered the Middle Ages with a many-sided legacy which he himself had not created. The Jewish masses, for the most part, were not yet conscious of the difficulties inherent in such a condition. They did not yet feel bowed beneath the weight of a ponderous heritage, but still drew sustenance from those spiritual sources which had served as fountain­ heads of creativity for the preceding generations. Only occa­ sionally were its ranks broken by individuals who, under the force of political and religious pressure from without, were led to desert their faith and their people. Eventually, the influences behind the political and religious oppression allied themselves more closely in a common destructive assault upon Judaism in Spain than they did in any other period of Jewish history. These external forces were assisted from within by a rationalism and scepticism which undermined tradition, the accepted ways of thinking, the logical bases for ritual practices, and the belief in the mission of Israel and the purpose and meaning of its Diaspora. Hellenic thought illuminated with its cold light the bitter battle for survival fought by Judaism against Christianity in Spain.\n\nT H E L INES\n\nOF\n\nD EVELOPMENT\n\nIN\n\nA NTIQUITY\n\nThe history of the Jews in Spain constitutes but one chap­ ter in the comprehensive story which covers the period dur­ ing which the Jews were caught between the two great reli­ gious and political powers, Christianity and Islam.

Christianity and Islam were the religions in power, and the Jews resided under their dominion as a subject people. The fate of our people de­ pended upon the fortunes of the younger Christian and Mos­ lem nations who entered upon the stage of history at a later date than the Jews, and borrowed heavily from earlier civi­ lizations. Jewish history, however, though tied up with the histories of these nations, remained, nevertheless, distin­ guished from them by its antiquity and by its inner force, which still carries it forward. It is closer, fundamentally, to the histories of the peoples of Far Eastern Asia. Like them, the Jewish people preserved its heritage of national tradi­ tions in their original purity against that process of religious and cultural assimilation to which the peoples of Europe and the Near East succumbed during the decline of the Roman Empire and the period of the barbarian invasions. The his­ torian, therefore, who would trace the subsequent history of our people, finds himself compelled to set down a few land­ marks marking the course of our peopled progress prior to its dispersal throughout Christendom. In its earliest days the Jewish nation found itself in the midst of great powers and foreign cultures. It borrowed from them certain external forms, but remained ever conscious of the sharp contrasts that distinguished it from the other na­ tions despite the latter’s political might and cultural wealth. It had its own moral and theological outlook, regarding itself as intimately bound with God, who was the God of all man­ kind. It occupied, therefore, a unique position in the history of mankind. The consciousness of a bond between Israel and God determined and defined the position of the Jew among the nations, his relationship to his environment and his in­ ner conduct. He raised himself above his environment by a life of holiness. Inwardly, Israelite society was founded upon the fundamental qualities of simplicity, brotherhood, and love. 4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

This historic world outlook, and the patterns of political and social life based upon it, grew out of a purely religious orientation. It had no scientific rationale and drew no distinction between ritual law and social precepts. Its teachings were intended primarily to introduce into the ex­ isting law the spirit of love for God and fellow man. But in the end, all these elements—historical, legal, ethical, and theological—fused into one mold, which impressed itself upon succeeding generations and compelled them to create a new society, unique in form and structure. Such a society, founded upon the precepts of the Torah, was established by Ezra the Scribe. He jealously guarded the “sa­ cred seed” from intermingling with the Gentiles and partici­ pating in their idolatrous practices. He restored the Holy Temple and revived Jewish national life on Jewish soil. But this renewed community remained under the tutelage of a foreign power, and the privileges which it was granted by the kings of Persia were substantially the same as those which the Jews throughout the Diaspora were wont to receive centuries later. The Hasmoneans, many generations after Ezra, saved their nation from betraying the Covenant by assimilating with the Greek civilization, and “while all the nations of the world lay prostrate before the idol, they remained standing erect like the palms.” The heroism exhibited by this small group of pietists in Palestine remained a shining example for all suc­ ceeding ages; but when it came to implementing the structure of national life, differences arose in the interpretation of the hallowed traditions and the means of realizing them in life. Was the nation to be organized as a semi-Hellenized state, pursuing a realistic political course, or was it to constitute a theocratic national center under the aegis of foreign powers? Was it better to yield to the might of Rome or to wage a national war for the establishment of a “kingdom of God”? 5\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Palestine, with its Temple, pietist movements, and wealth of sacred traditions, had around it, even during that period, a widely dispersed Diaspora, exhibiting the fundamental char­ acteristics of the Jewish dispersion of a later day—a Diaspora with rights curtailed and living only on limited sufferance, waiting for the Redeemer, defending itself against attackers, and wrestling with a theoretical antisemitism which exploited the obvious contradiction between the avowed mission of Israel and his actual state of dependence. There already ap­ peared, in this environment, the type of Jew who betrayed his people and scoffed at the ancestral tradition. But this type had not yet become a conspicuous social phenomenon. The Judaeo-Hellenistic literature, though couched in borrowed forms, was, nevertheless, fully nationalist and religious in content. It differed from the polemic literature of the Mid­ dle Ages and of the modern age of enlightenment in that it did not remain on the defensive but set out to destroy pa­ ganism, to disseminate Jewish lore among the Gentile na­ tions, and to implant the pure virtues of Israel in the hearts and homes of the depraved pagan masses. It did not seek to disguise the inherent contradiction between the religio-nationalist teachings of Israel and Graeco-Roman culture. To­ gether with the Palestinian center, the Diaspora held to the messianic conception of history, which differs so radically from the rationalist view of cause and effect in history up­ held by the Greek philosophers. It shared with the Palestin­ ian center the belief in God, who “exercises His will” in hu­ man history “whenever He will,” who delivers His people from its suffering and its persecutors, directs the progress of all mankind toward a predetermined goal, “changeth the times and the seasons, removeth kings and setteth up kings” 6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

There is a marked similarity between the develop­ ment of the Halakha and Aggada, down to the completion of the Talmud, and the growth of Christianity from its beginnings down to Augustine. From one common fountainhead, that is, Jewish life during the period of the Second Temple, flowed two separate streams, two complete and well-defined ways of life, which to this day characterize Judaism and Christianity. With­ out a knowledge of them it is impossible to understand Jew­ ish life during the Middle Ages. Ordinary historical laws brought it about that the contributions of a small group, ac­ tive during a limited period, achieved authoritative status among the Jews for ages to come. Yet more than historical accident was involved. The teachings of the Tannaim gave expression to the innate tendencies of their people, to national folk concepts, remote from Western ways of thinking. They collected and compiled the surviving memories of national freedom, of a natural life on native soil, of the Holy Temple, whence issued teaching and atonement for Israel and for all the world, of those days when the divine grace still rested on the nation. The Halakha and Aggada together offer a complete and well-defined way of life, strong enough to preserve the people which pursues it in the face of all the tempests of his­ tory. They are the products of a religious-nationalist vitality which glows in every statement and whose vigor interpen­ etrates every teaching. The teachings of Judaism by the sages of the Mishna, as a mythic, monotheistic folk religion, devel­ oped the theological and ethical elements of the Pentateuch, 7\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Endowed with insight into the human heart, these masters took the spiritual values which were born and throve in so exalted an atmosphere and put them within the mental grasp of the simple man, the peasant, the laborer, and the petty bourgeois of European society to this day. A people of farmers and townsmen, living on its own soil, formed the social background of the Mishna. The scholars were closely attached to their people. Their primary concern was the national and religious survival of Israel in a period of politi­ cal stress and persecution. A number of the scholars were themselves artisans and earned their livelihood by the toil of their hands. The true democratic spirit of a pietist community prevailed in the academies. No distinction was made between rich and poor: in fact, the God of Israel “loves the poor.” Humility and meekness were considered noble traits. “Let a man be ever of the persecuted and not of the persecutors, of the humiliated and not of the humiliators.” A privileged po­ sition was accorded only to the prince of the house of David, the preservation of whose lineage and grandeur was regarded as a guarantee of the nation’s own survival. The sages of the Mishna were fundamentally ascetics and their lore was as­ cetic. Their pure asceticism did not distinguish in quality between the observance of the ritual commandments, the pursuit of social justice, and the introspective purging of the heart. A savant like Rabbi Phineas ben Yair, so meticulous in his observance of the ritual law and the principles of eq­ uity, also outlined ten progressive steps of spiritual prepa­ ration by which one ascends to Piety (Hasidut) which, in turn, leads to Divine Inspiration and ultimately to Resurrec­ tion and the appearance of Elijah the Prophet, the herald of the Redemption (Jerus. Talmud, Shabbat, I, 3, and Shekalim, III, 3; cf. Mishna Sota, IX, 15; cf. also Jerus. Talmud, Demai, I, 3; Babyl. Talmud, Hullin, 7a–7b; Aboda Zara, 20b). In some instances the scholar was identified with the popular saint who has the power to perform miracles and bring rain­ 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Sometimes he appeared as a mystic, a master of recon­ dite lore. Some, it was believed, were vouchsafed divine rev­ elation through the medium of a heavenly voice or a personal visit from the Prophet Elijah. The sages of the Talmud moved in an atmosphere of miracles and many miraculous acts were credited to them. The precepts of the Law itself, to be sure, do not rest upon miracles or visions, but are founded upon tradition and the tried methods of biblical hermeneutics. But even the dialectic method of study bore a mytho-theological character. In spite of the temporary nature of the circum­ stances under which this Law was developed, and despite the danger of petrifaction to which all inherited tradition is ex­ posed, this Law was destined to guide and preserve the peo­ ple. The authors of the Mishna, in endowing the people of Israel with a wealth of law and precepts, did not intend to provide them with a guide for a prolonged Diaspora. They believed their own times to be close to the Messianic Age. The growth of the Halakha paralleled in some ways the development of the Roman Law. The Jewish scholars collected the elements of positive law, both the fruits of the nation’s own creative genius and some which bore the stamp of outside influences, analyzed them in the light of their underlying prin­ ciples, and developed them further by applying the established methods of interpreting the Law. This collection, like the Roman Law, included laws which grew out of the specific conditions of a given period but remained in effect beyond it and were accepted by later generations, long after the con­ ditions responsible for their origin had ceased to exist. True to the spirit of the Bible, the scholars of the Mishna laid down statutes and precepts inspired by love of God and fellow man. Many laws were based entirely upon this principle, such as the laws of charity—providing for the care of orphans, en­ dowing indigent brides, being hospitable to strangers, com­ forting the sick, burying the dead, consoling the bereaved, redeeming captives, and similar benevolent deeds—which 9\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The same sages sought to instil this spirit into all of the statutory law. “He who would lead a life of piety,” they taught, “must ob­ serve the laws of damages.” Alongside the positive law, they set up guiding principles for a pietist way of life and laid down rules of virtuous conduct whose violation, though not punishable by the hand of man, called for retribution directly from Heaven. The legislation of the Mishna was meant to serve only as an interim code whose laws were to be given authoritative interpretation only in the Messianic Age. Thus, when the positive law failed to meet the requirements of their moral conscience, they refrained from making a deci­ sion, keeping the problem in abeyance by stating, “Let the matter rest until Elijah comes.” Talmudic jurisprudence never distinguished, as Roman Law did, between the civil and criminal law (ius) and the ritual law (fas). But their intuitive religious sense, which did not need the aid of Greek science, taught the rabbis to distinguish be­ tween “commandments written in the Bible, which, had they not been written, deserved to be inscribed—such as the pro­ hibition of robbery, adultery, idolatry, blasphemy, and murder”—and ordinances, “which human passion and pagan thought question—such as the prohibitions against eating the swine’s flesh and the wearing of garments of mixed fibers, and the provisions for levirate release (halitza), the purification of the leper, the rituals of the red heifer and the scapegoat.” They distinguished between commandments whose observ­ ance is incumbent upon Israel alone and the “seven precepts of the descendants of Noah,” obligatory for all mankind. The teachings of the Tannaim represent a religious and nationalist reaction to pagan civilization, culture, and politi­ cal power—the enemy and oppressor of Jewry. Hellenized Judaism learned from Hellenic culture to raise the banner of its teachings before the outside world in demonstrative and aggressive action. Even after the destruction of the Second 10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The authors of the Mishna sought to confine Jewish culture to the limits of the Halakha and Aggada. Every child and common artisan in Israel, they felt, possessed knowledge and learning enough to match the lore and science of the other nations. “Thou shall not say,” the sages admonished, “I have studied Jewish learning; I may now study the culture of the other nations.” “Adopt not their institutions,” they warned, “their theaters, circuses, and stadia.” An entire tractate, Aboda Zara, was devoted to teaching, in great detail, how a Jew should guard against contact with idolatry and heresy, the latter including also the young Christian movement. There were, besides, laws which grew out of the struggle for political and religious existence which the Jewish nation had to wage, even in its own land, against the foreign con­ queror. These are the well-known statutes which were later exploited for their own ends by all sorts of antisemites and apologists. Included among them are certain laws, as, for ex­ ample, those applying to informers, which continued to have practical application in the Jews’ struggle for religious and national survival during the Middle Ages. In the conflict be­ tween Israel and Edom (Rome), the latter employed ruthless tactics. The emperors of pagan Rome continued in Palestine the campaign of persecution against Jews and Judaism initi­ ated by Antiochus Epiphanes, while the Christian em perors found religious justification for their policy of oppression. Rome forbade the observance of the commandments of the faith, the study of Torah, the ordination of scholars, the sanc­ tification of the new month, and the intercalation of the leapyear month. It exiled the scholars from the religious centers in Palestine, and dislodged the people from its ancestral home in Judaea. A new chapter was added then to the history of Jewish martyrology. The duty of martyrdom was then formu­ lated in the words, “One must submit to death in preference 11\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Talmud, Sanhedrin, I, 2).“It is better to dwell in the desert in Eretz Yisrael than in a palace abroad” (Genesis Rabbah, 39). There could be no com­ promise between the Jewish nation and the foreign power in this struggle. In the teachings of the Palestinian scholars one does not find the formula, evolved in Babylonia, staling that “the law of the government is law unto us,” nor does a prayer for the welfare of the government exist in their liturgy as in that of the western Diaspora. The Jews were in the end com­ pelled to concede, against their will, that “this nation (i.e., Rome) was granted dominion by Heaven”; and only in the third century, for the first time, was a warning issued not to revolt against the foreign powers. Talmudic Law does not deal much with the details of the Jew’s relationship to the Gentile state and society, the very question to which the Christians zealously devoted the greater part of their teach­ ings and precepts. Except for the laws regarding idolatry and the injunction against restoring to Gentile courts of law, fu­ ture generations in the Diaspora remained without an au­ thoritative guide for the conduct of their relations with the people among whom they lived. Jewish circles voiced increasingly derogatory opinions of pagan society. As against the dictum that the righteous of all the nations merit salvation in the world to come, there are other statements condemning the pagans to Hell, from which the people of Israel are saved by virtue of their observance of the commandments. Our sages were very careful not to divide the universe into two spheres, the domain of God and the realm of Satan, but their view of the kingdom of Edom (i.e., Rome) prepared the ground for Augustiners definition of the conflict between the civitas Dei (city of God) and the civitas diaboli (city of the devil). “Rabbi Judah spoke up and 12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

They built forums, they constructed bridges, they erected Baths’ Rabbi Simeon son of Yohai replied and said, ‘What­ ever they built, they did so only for their own advantage. They built forums in order to house harlots there, baths—to refresh themselves in them, bridges—to collect tolls for them’ ” (Sabbath, 33b). “Why is Edom called a villain (Heb. naval)? Because he filled the world with villainy (Heb. navlut). He erected temples of idolatry, brothels, theaters, and circuses” (Midrash to Psalm 14). Other homilies express similar distrust and suspicion of the pagan world. The people of Israel was dispersed throughout the empire of Edom. Already in the Palestinian Aggada the opinion was current that the Jewish dispersion must cover the entire earth and be subjected to the domination of all seventy nations. The aggadic picture of the Diaspora was fitted into the frame of the Roman Empire, which was said to be unable to exist without the Jewish dispersion just as the world cannot exist without the winds. The Diaspora has a Salvationist mission. “The Holy One, blessed be He, dispersed the people of Israel among the nations in order that they may acquire proselytes” (Pesahim, 87b), and that they may atone for the sins of all mankind. Wherever Israel is exiled, it is accompanied by the Divine Presence. The day of redemption was believed to be close at hand, bringing with it the national and political re­ habilitation of the Jewish people and the salvation of human­ ity. Just as the realization of the Jewish messianic ideal was inconceivable without the revival of the people’s national life in its historic homeland, so it was equally impossible—in the opinion of most authorities—to divorce from this concept the eschatology of universal salvation. The liturgy confirms this opinion in texts such as these, “They shall all become one community, doing Thy will wholeheartedly . . . ,” and “Thou alone shall reign over all Thy works. . . .” The foregoing are a few fundamental characteristics of the 13\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Their code repre­ sented a complete, detailed, and well-ordered world outlook. Their attitude was conceived in an atmosphere of mythologi­ cal thinking where care was taken not to couch religious ide­ als in rational terms or to express their relation to the prac­ tical world in matter-of-fact language. Therein lay their strength and also their weakness. 1 Christianity, on the other hand, introduced the belief in a divine Messiah who had already appeared and in a Church whose function in history was to offer immediate salvation. Christianity borrowed from Judaism, not only its fundamen­ tal religious and ethical principles, but also its specific ori­ entation to the world around it. Until the Roman Empire turned Christian, the position of Christianity with respect to the Empire and pagan society was similar to the position of Israel among the nations. Christianity succeeded in convert­ ing the Roman Empire, not only because it discarded the national and ritual elements of the teachings of the rabbis, but also because it presented the mythic elements common to both Judaism and Christianity in simple, rational terms, and related them to existing social and political conditions. From the time the two religions separated and until the end of the Middle Ages the rivalry between Judaism and Chris­ tianity did not revolve around fundamental differences of faith and ethics, but took the form of a contest between two divergent conceptions of human history and two conflicting approaches to the problem of salvation, each seeking to gain ascendancy over the other. Without a knowledge of these theoretical considerations it is impossible to understand the harsh fate which befell our people during the Middle Ages. In the fourth century Christianity entered into an alliance with the Roman Empire, for all the latter’s iniquities, in an­ ticipation of the day when it would possess enough strength to inculcate the spirit of righteousness and divine justice into 14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Fortified with this outlook, the Christian Church rose to a dominant position among the pow­ ers of the earth, whereas Israel remained alone, fulfilling the function of the “city of God” besieged by the wicked, surviv­ ing only by dint of its faith in God who can be trusted to fulfil His promise. The Christian Church, united with the Roman Empire, wiped out pagan worship, but it could not and dared not destroy Israel completely. “Slay them not, lest my peo­ ple forget; make them wander to and fro by Thy power” (Psalms 59. 12). Slay not the Jews—Augustine, the foremost teacher of medieval Christianity, taught—lest the nations forget My teachings, but scatter them throughout the world. It is forbidden to kill the Jews. They are to be preserved so that they, who are the guardians of the Holy Scriptures, may attest to the truth of Christianity. They must, however, be dispersed throughout the world and subjugated politically, as it is written, “And the elder shall serve the younger” (Gen­ esis 25. 23). Israel must ever be a wanderer and fugitive on earth, like Cain the fratricide, bearing a sign, so that any­ one encountering him would not kill him. These teachings were applied in practice. The Roman emperors relegated the dispersed Jews to the position of second-class citizens with limited rights. They enacted laws to prevent the spread of Judaism. They oppressed the Jewish community in Palestine and abolished the official authority of the Patriarch. Christi­ anity, thus, in doctrine and in deed, imposed upon Israel the sentence of Galut (dispersion).\n\nT HE JEWS\n\nOF\n\nSPAIN UNDER\n\nTHE\n\nROMANS\n\nAND THE\n\nVISIGOTHS\n\nThe beginnings of Jewish settlement in Spain, as in all lands of the Diaspora, early became the subject of legend. From the tenth century onward numerous accounts circulated concern­ ing Jewish families as well as communities whose forebears were reputed to have been exiled from Judaea by Titus, or even by Nebuchadnezzar, and brought to Spain. These ac­ 15\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Jews and Christians alike sought to associate their origins with the earliest and most hallowed traditions of mankind. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the conversos (converted Jews) sought support from these legends in apologetic at­ tempts to deny responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus by proving that their ancestors had had no part in it. But origi­ nally the prevailing motive in the development of this leg­ end was the conviction of the Spanish Jews that their descent from the tribe of Judah, exiled to Spain after the destruction of the First Temple, was responsible for their high level of culture. This tradition first gained currency in the tenth cen­ tury in the days of the distinguished statesman, Hasdai ben Isaac ibn Shaprut. Older still was the identification of Spain with the biblical “Sefarad,” in the interpretation of the verse of the Prophet Obadiah which speaks of “the captivity of Je­ rusalem that is in Sefarad.” According to the exegete, the Prophet prophesied the destruction of Edom, identified as Rome, and the ingathering of the Diaspora, including the tribe which was exiled to the far end of the Roman Empire, namely, Spain. Such an interpretation could suggest itself to the exegete only at a time when the Roman Empire consisted principally of the lands around the Mediterranean, and when Spain was regarded as its remotest province. Such political and geographic allusions, therefore, must date back to the latter days of the Roman Empire, or, at the very latest, to the period of Visigothic rule in Spain. At this point legend already merges with historic fact. 1a The first Jews to settle in Spain were part of the ancient Diaspora which was dispersed throughout all corners of the Roman Empire. Already the apostle Paul intended to visit Spain, undoubtedly to establish contact with a Judaeo-Christian community in existence there. More specific information comes to us from the period following the alliance of the Chris­ 16\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Severus, bishop of Majorca, in a letter written in the year 418, gives an account of the forced conversion to Christianity of the Jews on the island of Minorca. Violent street fighting be­ tween Jews and Christians, incited by the bishop, broke out in the town of Magona, on that island. The synagogue was set on fire. The Jews encouraged one another to remember the Maccabean martyrs and to die for the Divine Law. The women especially excelled in deeds of heroism and self-sacrifice. A few men succeeded in hiding for several days in the forests and in ravines in the mountains, but their efforts to take to the sea and escape from the place of persecution failed. The most distinguished members of the community yielded to the pressure. Severus claims to have gained five hundred and forty Jewish souls on that small island. The Jews of Magona, like their brethren throughout the western Diaspora, had constituted until then a distinct national and religious community. At the same time, until the new Christian legislation succeeded in disturbing the harmony, they had also taken part in the political life of the city, enjoy­ ing equal rights with all the other inhabitants. The head of the Jewish community was exempted from the onerous duties that went with a seat on the Curia (municipal council) and also held the highly honored and coveted position of Defensor. Many of the townsmen accepted his protection (Patrocinium). Another Jew bore the title Comes Provinciae. Most of the Jews were wealthy landowners. They bore Latin and Greek names for the most part, and only in a few cases Hebrew names. Many names, which later became famous because of the distinguished personalities who bore them, originated, no doubt, during this period (e.g., aeare, Cresques = Crescens; jprc , Perfet = Perfectus). The condition of the Jews on the Spanish mainland must have been similar to that on the is­ land. We hear that, shortly before the aforesaid persecution, 17\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

We see, therefore, that a sizable Jewish population lived in the Iberian peninsula prior to its conquest by the Germanic tribes. It is important to bear this fact in mind for an understanding of the later history of the Jews in Spain. 2 The Visigothic conquerors did not at first introduce any changes in the status of the Jews. The legislation in force in the seventh century seems to indicate that ownership of land formed the basis of existence for the Jews as well as for the Goths and the Romans. The Jews cultivated their soil with their own hands or with the help of slaves. They held land in lease or rented it out under the prevailing terms of ten­ ancy. Some served as stewards (villici) of estates owned by Christians. Of their town life we know very little. The Ro­ man Municipal Law remained in force, but we do not know whether the social and economic position of the Jews living in towns remained the same. Only incidentally do we learn of Jews engaging in overseas commerce. One may conclude from existing sources, however, that the Jews concentrated primarily in the culturally advanced centers: the capital To­ ledo, the southern and eastern regions—the Andalusia and Catalonia of a later day—which lay along the Mediterranean coast, where we shall find most of the Jews living also dur­ ing the Arabic and the second Christian periods. But there is no trace in Spain of the specific economic development of the Jews of the Middle Ages, whose beginnings were already in evidence among the Jews in the Frankish kingdom. How the political differences, which arose in Spain follow­ ing the Germanic invasions, affected the position of the Jews is not clear. In the civil courts Jews were judged according to Roman Law. Yet they were not regarded as full Roman citizens, since the provisions of the Theodosian Code, which cur-tailed Jewish rights in accordance with Christian teach­ ings, were included in the first Visigothic code of law, the Lex 18\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

This code forbade Jews to hold public office, to inter­ marry with Christians, to build new synagogues, to own Chris-tian slaves, to persecute apostates, etc. These provi­ sions were not, however, always enforced. In their outer forms of life the Jews were closer to the Ro­ mans than to the Visigoths, but religious fanaticism stood as a barrier between them. The Jews, it appears, were required to pay a special tax. In the larger cities they were organized into separate communities. The decrees issued against them during the later persecutions tell us something of their inner life. They observed the fundamental precepts of Jewish Law— circumcision, the Sabbath and festivals, dietary laws, marital laws and the laws pertaining to slaves. They read religious tracts, written most likely in Latin, to strengthen their faith. In 589 the Visigothic king changed his Arian faith for the Roman Catholic and proceeded to oppress the Jews in the manner practiced throughout the Catholic world. A few years earlier, in 576, in the city of Arvemum (Clermont) in the neighboring Frankish kingdom, the local bishop, following a street battle between Jews and Christians, compelled the Jews to choose between baptism and expulsion. A little later, in 582, the Merovingian king, Chilperic, ordered all the Jews of his realm to be baptized. The Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, who still exercised jurisdiction over certain areas of Spain, followed his victory over the Persians and Jews in Palestine in 628 with an order to convert by force all the Jews throughout the prov­ inces of his Empire, and the Merovingian Dagobert is said to have followed his example. Both Gaul and the Byzantine province of Africa provide us with information conceming the spiritual conflicts suffered by the forced converts. Through­ out the Jewish world a generation of heroes and saints must have arisen then and saved Jewry from utter extinction. In Spain the era of persecutions was opened by King Sisebut 19\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

He ordered all Christians freed from all relation­ ships rendering them dependent upon Jews. The Jews were required to give up their Christian slaves and servants as well as their Christian tenants, together with the land the latter held in lease, and to transfer them to Christian control or set them free, without making their freedom conditional upon their observance of Judaism. A Jew who converted a Chris­ tian to Judaism was to suffer death and confiscation of prop­ erty. Children of Christian female slaves by their Jewish mas­ ters were to be brought up as Christians. Jews who accepted Christianity were to retain their property. The clear purpose of the law was to prevent proselytization by Jews and to en­ courage their own conversion. Full enforcement of this law would have shaken the foundations of the economic life of the Jews. They were excluded from the natural social structure as it existed at the end of the Roman period. under the new con­ ditions, deprived of slaves and tenants, it became virtually impossible for them to cultivate or even own large estates. A short time later Sisebut ordered the Jews either to ac­ cept Christianity or leave the country. The problem of forced converts, which was already a painful one throughout the Byz­ antine Empire, now began to unfold itself in Spain as a trag­ edy which was to last several generations. The royal decree could not with a single stroke extirpate from the hearts of the Jews the faith of their fathers; and the decree, it appears, was not fully enforced. In order to deal with the new situation, a council of the bishops of the realm met in Toledo in 633 and decreed that Jews shall not be converted by force, but that those already converted must remain Christians and must be prevented from practicing the Jewish faith. Their children shall be taken from them and brought up as Christians. The slaves they had circumcised shall be set free. The testimony of converts found practicing their old faith shall not be trusted. The marriage of a Jew and a Christian shall be invalid, unless 20\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Converts as well as Jews shall be excluded from public office. These laws struck not only the Jews but also the converts, who were suspected of remaining faithful to the religion of their fathers. Five years later a Church council forbade all non-Catholics to reside in the country. The converts were placed under strict episcopal supervision. They were not permitted to travel within the country without a permit signed by the local Church authori­ ties. Every Jew was required to take an oath, according to a fixed formula, that he had given up Jewish law and practice. The penalty for relapsing varied, according to the seriousness of the offense, from religious penance to flogging, loss of a limb, confiscation of property, or burning at the stake. The Church never did succeed in converting all the Jews in the country. It was simply unable to keep an eye on all of them. The nobility, still devoutly Arian in their faith and wa­ vering in their loyalty to the crown, needed the services of the Jews and gave them refuge on their estates. Isidore, bishop of Seville, and Julian, bishop of Toledo, wrote polemic works against Judaism. But the Jews too had books to strengthen their faith, preaching the messianic hope supported by escha­ tological computations, and telling tales of a king of the tribe of Judah holding sway somewhere in the East. A new but vain attempt to enforce the anti-Jewish legisla­ tion was made by King Ervig in 681. To the laws of his pred­ ecessors he added even more oppressive restrictions. Severe penalties were ordered for the evasion of baptism, the observ­ ance of Jewish precepts, religious instruction, and the distri­ bution of tracts defending the Jewish faith and disparaging the Christian. Ervig also attempted to enforce at last Sisebut’s decree releasing Christian slaves and tenants from Jewish control.

He further forbade professing Jews to enter seaports, lest they escape overseas, and to engage in business transactions with Christians. He ex­ empted converts from the payment of taxes, and levied their burden upon the remaining Jews. He ordered that all the land and slaves acquired by Jews over a period of many years be taken over by the state treasury at a fixed price. At the Church council of Toledo in 694, serious political accusations were hurled against the Jews. It was charged that they not only sought to undermine the Church, but were also plotting to seize the crown, massacre the Catholics and destroy the country along with the people; that they were conspiring with “the Hebrews across the sea” for help in executing their plan. These accusations were inspired, no doubt, by the messianic agitation among the Jews and by their connections with the rebellious nobility. As punishment the council decreed that the property of all the Jews be confiscated, they themselves be impressed into slavery, and their lands turned over to their former slaves for cultivation. 3 This conciliar decree of the year 694 constitutes the last authentic documentary evidence bearing upon the struggle between Judaism and Christianity in Visigothic Spain. The series of events which took place in Spain during the seventh century remained a symbol and example for the Christian fa­ natics of the latter Middle Ages. These events occurred in a historical, religious and social setting that was still of the ancient world. The last foundations of the Roman Empire had, however, already begun to crumble beneath the blows of the Arab conquerors.\n\nM OSLEM S PAIN In the year 711 the Arabs invaded Spain and in a victori­ ous campaign of only a few years conquered the entire country.4 According to a later tradition, the conquerors settled Jews in the cities of Cordova, Granada, Seville, Elvira and Toledo, 22\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

This tradi­ tion was utilized by Christian writers from the twelfth cen­ tury on for anti-Jewish propaganda; they converted it into stories of Jewish treachery and conspiracy with the foreign invader. The original tradition does have a basis of truth. Settlements of Jewish merchants were established near Arab military garrisons also in other lands. In Spain the Arabs were able to make use of Jewish communities already there. It seems that at first the Arabs did not permit the growth of a large Jewish community in Cordova, capital of Andalusia, which soon became a caliphate independent of Bagdad, “for it was the seat of the Caliph, full of Moslems with a few Jews.” Neighboring Lucena, however, later the seat of a famous acad­ emy which flourished until the twelfth century, is referred to in a responsum of Rabbi Natronai, Gaon of Sura (853), as “a city of many Jews . . . there is not a Gentile among you.” Arab geographers of the tenth and twelfth centuries already call Granada and Tarragona “Jewish cities.” It is safe to assume that Jewish merchants resided in many localities in the forti­ fied sections of the city, sharing all the responsibilities and privileges of its defense, as they did later under Christian rule. The Moslem tribesmen who came from the East did not quickly adapt themselves to the norms of city life. But the Arabs did not attempt to upset the social order that had ex­ isted in Spain prior to their invasion. They themselves formed only a thin ruling stratum. The Mozarabic Christians retained their language and customs, and their influence gave Arabic culture in Spain its individual character. The Christians and Jews who remained loyal to their faith enjoyed national and religious autonomy. Jews and Christians filled various offices at the court of the caliph and in the state administration, as they did in the caliphate of Bagdad. The Mohammedan rul­ ers needed Jewish and Christian officials, since the Moslem tribesmen proved neither qualified nor trustworthy. Moslem religious fanaticism, which from time to time made the life 23\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The Jewish posi­ tion was not seriously affected by these persecutions. The Christians complained that the caliphs delegated Moslems and Jews to be present at the sessions of Church councils. Arabic Spain became a refuge for Jews. To the great cha­ grin of Christian Europe, a deacon of Alemannic descent by the name of Bodo went to Saragossa, embraced Judaism, took the name of Eleazar and married a Jewish girl (839). His writ­ ings in a messianic vein, denouncing Christianity, drew replies from Alvarus, a leader of the Christian zealots in Cordova. Both writers, remarkably enough, made use of the Talmud. Our earliest evidence of correspondence between the gaonim of Babylonia and Jewish scholars in Lucena and Barcelona— the latter city remained almost without interruption in Chris­ tian hands—dates back to this period. A well known legend has Rabbi Natronai Gaon make a miraculously rapid journey to Spain, spread learning there and return to Babylon as miraculously as he had gone.5 The invasions of the Germanic tribes in the west and the Arab conquests in the east and south destroyed the political and social foundations of the Roman Empire and of ancient civilization. As a result of this mighty upheaval both Jews and Christians were faced with new and ever-changing tasks. The forms of religious thought and action, which bore the stamp of the historical era during which they evolved, were now fixed for all time. The Catholic Church aspired to con­ trol human society by wielding the power of the sacraments, regardless of the changing world order. The Synagogue, for its part, learned to wait for divine intervention to bring about the reign of justice on earth. Judaism revealed its greatness and distinction through the collection of the traditions and precepts inherited from preceding generations. Its great 24\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The mythological and the rational elements of the tradition together continued to mold the character of the people. The gift of myth-weaving, rooted deep within the peopled soul, wove tales of alluring charm round the peopled sufferings; but the principal duty of the Jew on earth was to be the study of the Torah. And, as Torah came to permeate Jewish life ever more fully, its effect upon the spiritual, social and economic life became more and more pronounced. As the Talmud became an ever more dominant factor in life, consideration was given time and again by certain groups within the people to the same problem which had troubled the Hellenistic Jews—the one rising out of the difficulty of recon­ ciling the nationalist-mythical approach with the ways of ra­ tional philosophic thought. The rationalists saw no way other than to accept the Torah as handed down and to justify it, or, as was done at a later date, to elevate it to new heights of mysticism. Without the help of historical criticism, the medi­ eval Jews were not capable of penetrating to the basic ide­ als given expression in Halakha and the Aggada and to set them up as guides in the conduct of their lives. At the be­ ginning of this chapter we tried to indicate briefly the origi­ nal aims of the authors of the Mishna. Since their day the aggadic and halakhic traditions had increased, but without their practical application growing apace. The rationalist line of thinking failed to recognize even the purest and most pre­ cious gems of tannaitic Aggada, while the Talmud, particu­ larly the Babylonian, added tales of saints and miracles, as seen by the naive popular mind. The Halakha in Babylonia had developed along pilpulistic lines, foreign even to contem­ porary Palestinian scholars. [“ ‘He has made me dwell in dark places’ (Lamentations 3. 6)—that is the Babylonian Talmud” (Sanh. 24a).] 25\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The laws of the Talmud, whether ritual, civil, or criminal, were made to implement the theoretical bases of simple religious and moral ideals, not to circumvent them. The Karaites made a last attempt to discard the results of this late development and to direct the growth of the Halakha along less complicated lines. The Karaites did not differ fundamentally from the Rabbanites in their lines of thinking, which were nationalist and religious, inclining toward myth and ritualism and extreme asceticism. But the Talmud overcame all opposition. The latest layer of Jewish tradition became the dominant one through a process of historical development characteristic of that period. Only through the acceptance of the final form of the tradition was it possible to retain the uniform character of Judaism. The acceptance of the law of the Babylonian Talmud by the communities of the Diaspora was not due to apathy on their part or to the failure of their own creative powers. It came rather as a result of a planned campaign by the academies of Babylonia to impose the authority of the Babylonian Tal­ mud upon the entire Diaspora. To be sure, their religious and ethnic bonds had kept the scattered Jewish communities united even earlier, but their practices and customs had dif­ fered and even been at variance with some of the principles regarded by the authors of the Mishna as fundamental. The Diaspora had had no common tongue; teachers of the law were not to be found in western Europe; the law of the Mishna did not achieve full authority throughout the wide Diaspora until this very period which served as an area of transition from ancient times to the Middle Ages. The begin­ nings of the great change remain obscure, but its final results are clear and evident. A unifying revivalist movement, ascetic in character, swept over all the communities of the Diaspora. 26\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Hebrew now supplanted Aramaic, Greek and Latin in the communal affairs of the Jews and even became the spo­ ken tongue of wide circles. The calendar, fixed by computa­ tion, was accepted throughout the Diaspora. It was a proc­ ess which led to the renewal and strengthening of the bonds between the western Diaspora and the academies in Palestine and Babylonia. Yet, at the same time, the Jewish communities in the west became self-reliant and independent of the east. The historical development of a people is not guided by religion and precept alone. Such demands of the inner life sometimes clash with and are subject to conditions imposed by the world outside. In place of the old Roman Empire came the ruling policies of the Moslem powers, the Eastern Roman Empire of Byzantium, and the Western Roman Empire allied with the kingdom of the Franks, the kernel of the Europe of the future. This new political setting confronted Judaism with problems, both theoretical and practical, for which no satis­ factory solutions were to be found in the original Halakha. The law of the Palestinian sages was based on the principle of legitimate opposition to the pagan enemy power. Talmudic Halakha did not appreciably modify this attitude. Only after the passing of the ancient world did there arise, openly and clearly, the problem of the relation of the Jews to the Gen­ tile society and state and to the national states of Europe which came into being at a later date. As long as the messianic ideal and the hope of redemption were kept alive, a certain consciousness of conflict between Israel and the dominant power was bound to persist. In prac­ tice, however, the Jews began to show signs of adapting themselves to life in Diaspora lands. The Christians, follow­ ing Augustine’s teachings, subjected the Jews to the status of slaves of the crown (servi regis). 6 Though this principle 27\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The caliphs, to be sure, were unaware of this principle, but in practice they differed little from the Christians in their treatment of the Jews. Foreign rulers of all ranks were thus able to uti­ lize Jews for their own personal ends. This in turn opened to the Jews the doors to outside society, within which it ena­ bled them to gain for themselves social and economic posi­ tions. The Jew of the Diaspora became the spiritual as well as material middleman. In Christian Europe he eventually be­ came a professional moneylender. He became the loyal serv­ ant of the feudal lords, the financier, tax-collector and physi­ cian of the crown. The position of the Jews close to the court was widely regarded among them as a boon from God. The Jewish courtier was sent by divine Providence to be the de­ fender of his people in time of need, and he was, moreover, permitted to pursue secular learning. Thus, in the very period when the Babylonian Talmud attained full authority, restric­ tions were relaxed in matters which had been strictly forbid­ den by the early pietists. Some modern scholars have come to accept such phenomena, which then appeared on the Jewish scene, as characteristic, whereas actually they were still in direct conflict with the pure ideals adhered to by the people and their spiritual leaders. Every succeeding generation saw the rise of reformers who sought to restore Judaism to its pristine state and to replace it on its original foundations. The specific character of the revived Hebrew culture and the nature of its bearers became apparent, from the tenth century on, in Spain as in the other communities east and west: the rise of Hebrew culture was connected with external po­ litical factors. The Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III (912–961), hav­ ing suppressed the separatist political forces, established a unified and powerful kingdom whose high cultural level com­ 28\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

This great power had only a few small Christian states in the north as neighbors— the kingdom of Leon which was for a time united with Na­ varre, the county of Barcelona and a few tiny principalities. The caliph’s political power rested upon Slavic and Germanic slaves. Among his non-Moslem courtiers was Abu Yusuf Hasdai ibn Shaprut, the first Jewish personality in Spain whose life and work are known to us. Hasdai’s position was that of court physician; but he was also engaged in the translation of scientific works. Being well versed in languages, he served in a diplomatic capacity in negotiations with foreign rulers and thereby exercised an influence on foreign policy. He was thus the first to exercise functions which Jewish physicians performed at a later date in the courts of the Christian kings. In 956 Hasdai, on behalf of the caliph, received John, abbot of Gorze in Lorraine, the emissary of the German emperor, Otto I. In the same year Hasdai was sent to the Christian court of Leon to conclude a pact of friendship. In 958 he went on another diplomatic mission to Pamplona, capital of Navarre. Sancho, king of Leon and Navarre, had been expelled from Leon by the no­ bility and had fled to his grandmother, Tota, in Pamplona. Abd-ar-Rahman promised, through his Jewish emissary, to bring Sancho back to Leon, in return for the rights to ten fortresses. The Christian king, accompanied by his grand­ mother, was brought to Cordova in triumphal procession to undergo medical treatment by the Jewish physician. This event was celebrated in glowing verse by the two poet-proteges of Hasdai, Dunash ben Labrat and Menahem ben Saruk. From Hasdai’s letter to the king of the Khazars we learn of his duties as supervisor over the trade of foreign mer­ chants, “whose commerce and affairs cannot be conducted except through my hand and at my command.” It is quite possible that Hasdai was entrusted with the collection of port tolls and customs and with certain phases of the financial 29\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

There is, to be sure, room for doubt whether the famous letter of Hasdai to the king of the Khazars was actually written by him or at his command. But it is certain that the letter already circulated in Spain dur­ ing the eleventh century and may have been written during the generation following Hasdai’s death for nationalist and religious propaganda purposes. Hasdai’s career served as a model and precedent for the many Jewish statesmen who flourished in Spain during the five centuries following. In his own day, his position was looked upon as a guarantee of his people’s survival. “When our God saw their affliction and toil, “and none remaining shut up or left at large” (I Kings 21. 21), He caused me to be presented to the king, treated me with kindness and turned the king’s heart toward me, not on account of my own virtues but because of His kindness and His covenant. The afflicted and depressed sheep thereby gathered strength in deliverance, and the hands of their oppressors were weak­ ened. They were relieved of their affliction and their yoke was lightened, through the mercy of our Lord.” Tradition also associates with the name of Hasdai and his times the begin­ nings of Hebrew literature in Spain, the establishment of new centers of learning independent of the authority of the gaonim of the East, and the awakening within this young community in Israel of a consciousness of its own political and cultural importance which entitled it to the position of lead­ ership over the entire people. 7 At the height of the caliphate’s power the court at Cordova was almost the sole support of the oppressed Jewish popula­ tion scattered throughout the land. In the beginning of the eleventh century, however, mighty Al-Andalus broke up into several small states. In Cordova as well as in Seville aristo­ cratic republics were formed, which lasted until the family 30\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Tyrants of pure Arab blood held sway in Saragossa and Valencia. Berber chieftains were in power in Malaga, Granada and Badajoz. Slavic gener­ als ruled in Almeria, Denia and the Balearic islands. This pat­ tern of republics and principalities resembled closely the po­ litical structure of Italy during the Renaissance. Both were characterized by a high level of culture in both the scientific and esthetic fields, by ways of thinking which reviewed criti­ cally all historical, political and religious phenomena, and by tyrannical methods of government, devoid of religious or moral conscience. In the north, small Christian states formed—Leon, Castile, Navarre, Aragon, Barcelona and others— peopled by a military yeomanry, with nascent urban centers. Despite their profoundly different culture, the latter states could not avoid being influenced by the civilization of their Arab neighbors. At the same time, the Christians had already begun their attacks against the Arabs, and some of their successful offensives carried them as far as the southern regions of Andalusia. Jewish history in Spain was affected by these political de­ velopments. The capitals of the small Arab principalities be­ came the centers of Jewish culture. In the courts of the princes, Jews rose to positions of eminence and influence. The fate of the Jewish communities was closely bound up with the political fortunes of these Jewish courtiers, whose personal rise or fall often carried with it the prosperity or ruin of their community. We obtain most of our knowledge of this period from contemporary Hebrew poetry, fostered and cultivated under the tutelage of the Jewish courtiers. From what we know of Jewish life and influence in Granada, and to a lesser degree in Saragossa, we are justified in tak­ ing the conditions there as typical of the other Arab states. Only in Cordova, which was ruled by a number of aristocratic families, were Jews consistently harassed. In Seville, a Jewbaiting cadi was in power for a while, but was eventually 31\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

It would not be correct to assert that the pure-blooded Arab princes excluded the Jews from their courts, whereas the semi-civilized Berbers and Slavs attracted them because they were unable to conduct the affairs of state without the help of cultured Jews. In reality the treatment accorded the Jews by the several states varied according to their political structures. In a republic headed by aristocratic families there was no room for Jewish statesmen. On the other hand, a mon­ arch or other autocrat, the absolute ruler over an unfriendly native population, would attract to his service Jews—the per­ petual “aliens”—on whose loyal support he could count in se­ curing his regime. This phenomenon, in varying forms, mani­ fested itself time and again also in the history of Christian Europe. The foremost among the Jewish statesmen of that period was Samuel ha-Nagid.8 Over a period of thirty years, marked by uninterrupted warfare, he conducted both the domestic and foreign affairs of the kingdom of Granada. At the same time he was a rabbinic scholar of note and an authority in Halakha. He rose to the defense of his people and his faith and engaged in a polemic with Ibn Hazm, one of the leading Moslem scholars of his day. Samuel occupies a unique posi­ tion among the Hebrew poets in Spain. He sang not only of sacred faith and secular love, but also of ruthless war. Samuel was born in Cordova, where he became a wealthy merchant engaged in overseas commerce. During the political disorders which broke out in Cordova in 1013, Samuel, like many other Jews, fled and settled in Malaga. He was soon called to the service of Habbus, the king of Granada. The account of Samuel’s rise as given by Abraham ibn Daud, the Spanish-Jewish historian of the twelfth century, is well known. Samuel “was a merchant, and would sit in his store, which was adjacent to the palace of Ibn al-‘Arif, the vizir of Habbus ben Makhsan, king of the Philistines (i.e., 32\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The vizir’s maid would request of him that he write letters for her to her master the vizir. . . .” His skill in letter writing was reponsible for his rise to high office and for his becoming one of the king’s foremost ministers. One cannot take this legend literally and believe that Samuel rose from poverty to prominence through pure chance. He very likely brought considerable wealth with him to Gra­ nada, which helped him pave his way. In his earliest poems, which may have been written in Cordova, he expressed strong ambition for great achievements. The road to the top was not all straight and smooth. As a result of charges brought against them, Samuel was removed, in 1020, from a post in the local administration, and his father-in-law and nephew were executed. Nevertheless we find him, a few years later, vizir and katib (secretary) of king Habbus and Nagid over all the Jews of the realm. After Habbus’ death, his two sons vied for the crown, each supported by a faction of the leading politicians. The Jewish courtiers also took part in the quarrel, on one side or the other. Finally, the elder son, Badis, came out victorious, and with him Samuel, who had supported him throughout. The Jewish members of the op­ position fled to Seville. Samuel ha-Nagid’s career from here on may be studied in detail from his extant poetry. He continued until his death in 1056 to direct the foreign affairs of the small kingdom. Every year he accompanied the troops in the field on their campaigns. Expansionist ambitions, characteristic of all the small states in Spain, were the mainspring also of Samuel’s foreign policy. Yet it was all too conspicuous that a Jew was directing the foreign affairs of Granada, a fact which was a constant thorn in the side of the orthodox Moslems. Samuel, on the other hand, regarded himself as designated by Provi­ dence to make Granada the defender of his people who were being oppressed in neighboring states. The precarious posi­ tion of the Jews became apparent during the disturbances 33\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Ibn ‘Abbas, the vizar of the Slavic king of Almeria, hated the Jews. He circulated throughout the near-by states inflammatory tracts, attacking Samuel ha-Nagid and all Jews. He demanded of Badis that he dismiss his Jewish vizir. A provocative visit by the king of Almeria led to open warfare between his forces and those of Granada. The king of Almeria fell in battle. Ibn ‘Abbas was brought to Granada in chains and executed there at Samuel’s command. The Nagid celebrated the victory in verses of thanksgiving to God and wrote to the academies and schol­ ars in Palestine, Babylonia, Africa (Kairawan) and Egypt about the Lord’s great deeds. The Jewish question also figured as a side issue in the wars between Granada and Seville. Motadhid, the cadi of Seville, was highly praised by the nationalist Arabs for leading the fight against the Berbers, among whom Jewish influence was strong. But Samuel saw in him the oppressor of the Jews in his state. The wars that followed between Granada and Seville were fought principally for the political hegemony of southern Spain, and the details of the struggle are not important for our account. There is no doubt, however, that the Jewish vizir devoted his best energies to strengthening the position of his master, the autocrat of Granada. From Samuel’s poetry it would appear that he was entirely absorbed in this world of wars, uprisings, murders, intrigue and treachery. In domestic affairs, Samuel did, as his enemies charged, utilize every available means to get rid of opponents and to elevate his friends. His poetic accounts of his military expe­ riences he dedicated for the most part to his son Joseph, who was to succeed him. He would also send his paeans of victory to the rabbis in Kairawan and Fostat (Egypt), to the acad­ emies in Babylonia, to the exilarch in Bagdad, and especially to the leaders of the Jewish community in Jerusalem. In a poem celebrating his victory over Seville in 1055, which he sent to the Exilarch Hezekiah—whom he addresses as “the 34\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

On the battlefield, the God of Israel fights for him and angels descend to his side. The patriarchs plead for him, “and out of their dust draw succor with ropes of prayer.” Their intercession serves him in time of trial. Samuel believes that God deals justice on earth and is due to set the universe aright. The simple faith of his people and his own political ambitions are in perfect harmony. “I shall rise,” he writes, “over the heights of death to eternal life and shall travel past Hades to Paradise.” He knows that his work is abhorrent, that he is drowning in a sea of blood and is in need of atone­ ment. He turns with longing to Zion, where residence is atonement for sin. He wants to live in the Holy Land and be purified there. He dreams of the era of the nation’s youth which is to be restored when redemption comes. 9 Samuel ha-Nagid was succeeded by his son Joseph. One Arab historian testifies that Joseph conducted the affairs of state with manifest energy, increased the country’s wealth, saw to it that the state revenues were collected on time and appointed Jews to high public office. But much abuse was heaped upon him as well. Lately there have come to light the memoirs of Abdallah, the grandson of Badis, wherein the Jewish vizir is bitterly denounced. It was charged that Joseph had poisoned Balukin, the son of Badis; that during a drinking revel he had, with his own hand, killed one of the highest officials of the realm, a Jew of the opposing faction; that he had entered into a conspiracy to surrender the king­ 35\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Joseph’s activities fed the ha­ tred of the religious and nationalist fanatics among the Ar­ abs. One of them, a certain Abu Ishak of Elvira, wrote in­ flammatory poems attacking Joseph, seeking to incite the populace against him. Thanks to the influence of the Jewish katib, they charged, the Jews rose from lowly station, from the state of shut-out dogs, which is their lot all over the world, to the position of masters. They divide the kingdom of Granada among themselves into districts, and everywhere one of the accursed Jews is master. They collect the taxes. They eat their fill and dress luxuriously. They slaughter their cattle in the Arab markets and leave to the non-Jews the meat ritually forbidden to themselves. Joseph built himself a palace of marble, equipped with fresh water fountains. The welfare of the Arabs is in his hands; and while they wait at his door, he scoffs at them and their religion. This vicious propaganda brought about the desired result. In 1066 Joseph was assassinated and many Jews were massacred along with him in the city of Granada and in other parts of the country. Only a few years later, however, Jews again were holding high office in Granada. 10 Conditions similar to the above prevailed in the other prin­ cipalities of Moslem Spain. The Jews acquired political skill and the technique of public administration; and they eventu­ ally brought their talents and experience to the courts of the Christian princes in the north. A fuller evaluation of this glorious period in Jewish history requires a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of Arabic civilization. 11 The Jews of Spain lived during this time in a part of the vast Moham­ medan domain. Within this political and cultural sphere Pal­ estine retained its natural place as the national and religious center of Jewry. Except for local differences, the level of civilization in the west and in the east was the same. Regu­ 36\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Jewish communal leadership was in the hands of a small group of men of wealth and education who were influential at court. The Jewish court officials of this period, like those who served in similar capacity in the courts of Christian monarchs later on, were the owners of large estates and even entire villages. But the Jewish masses derived their livelihood from the cultivation of fields and orchards, from manufacture and handicraft. The Hebrew poetry of this period reflects primarily the life of the upper classes, the bourgeoisie and courtiers, who en­ joyed their life, tasted the pleasures of wine, women, palaces and gardens, and pursued the literary arts and the sciences. Traditional religiosity lived in harmony with secular culture. Boys and young men studied the Talmud and Hebrew gram­ mar along with poetry and “Greek Wisdom.” Political ambi­ tion, the passion for erotic experience, the desire for rational understanding penetrated the Jewish community, bringing disintegration and heresy on the one hand, and leading, on the other, to the refinement of the traditional religious con­ cepts and to the strengthening of the national consciousness which acquired a modern political hue. Jewish culture in Spain was guided by a line of thinking different from that of the authors of the Mishna and ex­ pressed itself in a way of life different from that of the pietists of German Jewry who died a martyr’s death for their faith. And yet the Spanish Jews clung fast to those roots from which one can never entirely tear himself away. They created for their people a national-religious lyrical poetry of singu­ lar quality-new, yet old-and explained the meaning of their people’s fate. The causes for these cultural achievements did not lie in external circumstances alone. Politically this period 37\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The poetry of Solomon ibn Gabirol and his contemporaries is full of plaints and laments over the people’s state of subjugation and exile. Absolutism and tyranny mark the political practices of that age. The cultural activity fostered by the courtiers was allowed to flourish only through the neglect and the religious and moral laxity of the rulers, and not as a result of the definite policy of tolerance and individual freedom. In the south and in the north, both in Islam and in Christianity, nationalist and reli­ gious movements, primitive in character, were forming, which were due to make an end of the existing laxity. Nevertheless, the patterns of life developed in the small Moslem states already laid the foundations for Jewish existence in Spain under Christian rule.\n\n38\n\nI This Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

This community was in contact with the Babylonian cultural centers. It is known to have addressed questions to Rab Amram Gaon (869–887). A Jew by the name of Judah, or Judacot, brought (876–877) news from Barcelona to Emperor Charles the Bald and carried back from the emperor’s court ten pounds of silver for the bishop of Barcelona for the re­ pair of his church. 2 39\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

From this time on we have abundant evidence of Jewish ownership of landed property in Barcelona and its environs and throughout Catalonia.3 The Jews bought, sold and exchanged parcels of land, leased them or rented them out under the terms of existing law. Most of the Jewish estates lay close to the city. The Jews did not buy land merely as an investment, but cultivated their fields and vineyards themselves, as was the case also in France and Germany. Both in southern France and in Catalonia we find villages and hamlets called “Jewish Village” (villa judaica), but whether they owed their names to their Jewish owners or Jewish inhabitants is not clear.4 In any case, land was the basis of the economy and social position of the Jews. We hear a Jew pleading, like a man deeply rooted in the soil for generations, “I do not want my ancestral estate to fall into the hands of strangers.”5 There were no legal limitations on the acquisition of land by Jews. They held their land in allodial ownership or under lease. The same laws which gov­ erned the sale and lease of land among Christians applied also in transactions of this kind between Jews and Christians and even between Jews and ecclesiastical institutions. The urban life of Barcelona began to flourish about this time, and the Jews were an integral part of it. By the end of the eleventh century a Jewish quarter (callis iudaicus), situ­ ated near the cathedral and the castle of the count, was in existence; and it remained in the same location until the destruction of the Jewish community in 1391.6 Jewish shops and stalls were to be found, in the middle of the twelfth cen­ tury, in the marketplace outside the city walls near the old fort.7 The urban economy of Barcelona, benefiting Jews and Christians alike, continued to expand in even greater meas­ ure from this period on. Even before this date the sources 40\n\nT H E EARL Y RECONQUEST EARLY\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

Wealthy Jews engaged in moneylending activities, extending loans to the counts of Barcelona among others. Jews were minting coins for these counts in the eleventh century, and some gold coins were named after the Jewish goldsmith who executed them. 8 A roster of the Jewish households of Barce­ lona, compiled in 1079, contains about sixty names, and the community at this time already had a long tradition behind it. The texts of the distinctive Hebrew shetarot (legal instru­ ments), in use in legal transactions between members of the community, formed the basis, in the beginning of the twelfth century, for the well-known treatise, Sefer ha-Shetarot, by Judah ben Barzilai al-Barceloni. 9 In legal transactions be­ tween a Jew and a Christian a Hebrew shetar would some­ times be drawn up and, where the matter was settled in a Spanish court of law, the Latin text would be followed by a summary in Hebrew with Hebrew signatures. Privileges granted by the count to the Jews of Barcelona, regulating testimony and court procedure in legal suits be­ tween Jews and Christians, are mentioned for the first time in a document of the middle of the twelfth century, but there is reason to believe that their origin was of earlier date. 10 The Jewish privileges of the Carolingian era no doubt served as the prototype for Catalonia, as they did for the rest of Chris­ tian Europe. It must be assumed that the relation of the Jews to the local count was one of near-servitude. Only on this basis can we explain the acquisition by the count of the es­ tates of the Jews killed in 985 and his confiscation, in 1022, of the property of a Jew who committed adultery with a married Christian woman. The Jew himself escaped death by conversion. The old Catalonian code of law, the Usatges de Barcelona, compiled between the years 1053 and 1071, clearly provides that the wergild to be paid for the killing or injury of a Jew is to be fixed arbitrarily by the count, which is not 41\n\nA History of the Jews in Christian Spain\n\nThis Library PDF version is for the use on an institutional computer only.

The entire code reveals the influence of the contemporary reform propaganda ema­ nating from Rome.11 It is this influence, rather than prevail­ ing custom, that is responsible for the enactment that a Christian should under no circumstances be required to swear to a Jew. Otherwise, the equality of Jews with Chris­ tians in bearing testimony in court remained. A Church coun­ cil, which was convened in Gerona in 1068 by the papal leg­ ate Hugo Candidus, decreed that the Jews must pay the tithes for land bought from Christians. The roster of the Jews of Barcelona, of the year 1079, is especially significant. It is part of an overall agreement whereby two brothers, heirs to the county of Barcelona, divided the inheritance between them. Only the Jewish inhabitants are listed in the text, a fact which proves that the estate of the deceased count in­ cluded, as one of its valuable assets, the special property rights over the Jews, whose relation to their ruler expressed itself in terms of personal vassalage rather than political allegiance. Our information regarding the Jews living in the mountain­ ous regions of old Aragon and Navarre is rather meager. In 1062 King Sancho Ramirez freed the inhabitants of Jaca, Jews and bakers excepted, from the obligation to grind their flour in the mills of the overlord. The Jews did not succeed in freeing themselves from this semi-servile obligation until some years later. 12 By the end of the eleventh century there were Jews living in Estella, Ruesta and Montclus. Mention is made, in the extant documents, of several commercial lev­ ies, tithes and fines paid by them. In Estella the Jews lived in the local citadel as well as in a nearby hamlet, and both communities paid an annual tax (paria) to the crown. 12a In Castile there were Jews living as early as the second half of the tenth century. The special rights that the count exercised over them indicate that their legal position was dependence"
