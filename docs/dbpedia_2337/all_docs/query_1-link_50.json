This document provides an introduction and first chapter to a book about the municipal militias in medieval Iberia between 1000-1284. It describes an encounter between the militias of Segovia and Ávila against an Almoravid force from Córdoba. The Christian militias, hundreds of kilometers from home, engaged and surprised the Almoravid prince Tâshfìn's army at night, inflicting many casualties before the Muslims fled. The militias acquired valuable plunder and returned home successfully. This introductory chapter aims to demonstrate that by the mid-12th century, the town militias were well-organized military forces that supported the kingdom's needs and could operate offensively on campaigns",
