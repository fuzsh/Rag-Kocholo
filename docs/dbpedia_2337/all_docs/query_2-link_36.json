The Middle Danube was a crucial frontier and a crossroads for population and cultural movement. Here, we present genome-wide data from 136 Balkan individuals dated to the 1st millennium CE. Despite extensive militarization and cultural influence, we find little ancestry contribution from peoples of Italic descent. However, we trace a large-scale influx of people of Anatolian ancestry during the Imperial period. Between ∼250 and 550 CE, we detect migrants with ancestry from Central/Northern Europe and the Steppe, confirming that “barbarian” migrations were propelled by ethnically diverse confederations. Following the end of Roman control, we detect the large-scale arrival of individuals who were genetically similar to modern Eastern European Slavic-speaking populations, who contributed 30%–60% of the ancestry of Balkan people, representing one of the largest permanent demographic changes anywhere in Europe during the Migration Period.\n\n“The Genetic Legacy of African Americans from Catoctin Furnace.” Science 381:1-13 (2023).\n\nÉ.

We analyzed 27 individuals from Maryland’s Catoctin Furnace African American Cemetery (1774–1850), identifying 41,799 genetic relatives among consenting research participants in 23andMe, Inc.’s genetic database. One of the highest concentrations of close relatives is in Maryland, suggesting that descendants of the Catoctin individuals remain in the area. We find that many of the Catoctin individuals derived African ancestry from the Wolof or Kongo groups and European ancestry from Great Britain and Ireland. This study demonstrates the power of joint analysis of historical DNA and large datasets generated through direct-to-consumer ancestry testing.\n\n“Early contact between late farming and pastoralist societies in southeastern Europe.” Nature 620: 358-365 (2023).\n\nS.

Haak.\n\nArchaeogenetic studies have described two main genetic turnover events in prehistoric western Eurasia: one associated with the spread of farming and a sedentary lifestyle starting around 7000–6000 BC and a second with the expansion of pastoralist groups from the Eurasian steppes starting around 3300 BC. The period between these events saw new economies emerging on the basis of key innovations, including metallurgy, wheel and wagon and horse domestication. However, what happened between the demise of the Copper Age settlements around 4250 BC and the expansion of pastoralists remains poorly understood. To address this question, we analysed genome-wide data from 135 ancient individuals from the contact zone between southeastern Europe and the northwestern Black Sea region spanning this critical time period. While we observe genetic continuity between Neolithic and Copper Age groups from major sites in the same region, from around 4500 BC on, groups from the northwestern Black Sea region carried varying amounts of mixed ancestries derived from Copper Age groups and those from the forest/steppe zones, indicating genetic and cultural contact over a period of around 1,000 years earlier than anticipated. We propose that the transfer of critical innovations between farmers and transitional foragers/herders from different ecogeographic zones during this early contact was integral to the formation, rise and expansion of pastoralist groups around 3300 BC.\n\n“Facilitating accessible, rapid, and appropriate processing of ancient metagenomic data with AMDirT.”F1000Research (2023).\n\nM.

(2023)\n\nBackground: Access to sample-level metadata is important when selecting public metagenomic sequencing datasets for reuse in new biological analyses. The Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics community (SPAAM, https://spaam-community.github.io) has previously published AncientMetagenomeDir, a collection of curated and standardised sample metadata tables for metagenomic and microbial genome datasets generated from ancient samples. However, while sample-level information is useful for identifying relevant samples for inclusion in new projects, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) library construction and sequencing metadata are also essential for appropriately reprocessing ancient metagenomic data. Currently, recovering information for downloading and preparing such data is difficult when laboratory and bioinformatic metadata is heterogeneously recorded in prose-based publications. Methods: Through a series of community-based hackathon events, AncientMetagenomeDir was updated to provide standardised library-level metadata of existing and new ancient metagenomic samples. In tandem, the companion tool 'AMDirT' was developed to facilitate automated metadata curation and data validation, as well as rapid data filtering and downloading. Results: AncientMetagenomeDir was extended to include standardised metadata of over 5000 ancient metagenomic libraries. The companion tool 'AMDirT' provides both graphical- and command-line interface based access to such metadata for users from a wide range of computational backgrounds. We also report on errors with metadata reporting that appear to commonly occur during data upload and provide suggestions on how to improve the quality of data sharing by the community. Conclusions: Together, both standardised metadata and tooling will help towards easier incorporation and reuse of public ancient metagenomic datasets into future analyses.\n\n“Isotopic and proteomic evidence for communal stability at Pre-Pottery Neolithic Jericho in the Southern Levant.” Scientific Reports 13, 16360 (2023).\n\nX. Wang, B. Zhang, Y. Sun, T. Ingman, S. Eisenmann, M. Lucas, E. Scott, J. Ilgner, G. Wu, P. le Roux, X. Wu, X. Zhang, A. Fan, P. Roberts, P.W. Stockhammer.\n\nAs one of the key, long-term occupied sites in the Southern Levant, Jericho was one of the most important early Neolithic centres to witness social and economic changes associated with the domestication of plants and animals. This study applies strontium (87Sr/86Sr), oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) isotope analyses to the enamel of 52 human teeth from Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) layers of Jericho to directly study human diet and mobility and investigate the degree of consolidation and the flexibility of social organization of Jericho society in the PPN period. The results indicate only two non-local individuals out of the 44 sampled inhabitants identified by strontium isotope analysis and are consistent with the presence of a largely sedentary community at PPN Jericho with no evidence for large-scale migration. We also construct strontium spatial baselines (87Sr/86Sr map) with local 87Sr/86Sr signatures for the sites across the Southern Levant based on systematic compilation and analysis of available data. In addition, we apply proteomic analysis of sex-specific amelogenin peptides in tooth enamel for sex estimation of the sampled individuals (n = 44), the results of which showed a sex-biased ratio (more male than female detected in this sample pool) in Jericho society during the PPN period, which may be due to the limited sample size or selective ritual practices like particular burial zones used for specific groups. We also pretreated a batch of human bone samples recovered from PPNB Jericho for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses for dietary investigations. However, the extracted collagen showed poor preservation and no valid δ13C or δ15N data were obtained.\n\n“Yersinia pestis in the Early Bronze Age Cemetery of Drasenhofen. The Currently Oldest Plague Deaths in Austria in their Cultural-Historical Context.” Archaeologica Austriaca 107: I–XXII (2023).\n\nG.U. Neumann, F. Kanz, A. Furtwängler, K. Fiebig, D. Verdianu, P.W. Stockhammer, K. Rebay-Salisbury.\n\nWithin the framework of an interdisciplinary analysis of the Early Bronze Age burials from Drasenhofen, evidence was found for what are currently the oldest plague victims in Austria. The male individuals, who died at the age of 23–30 and 22–27 years, respectively, were buried not far from each other in the north-easternmost and south-easternmost grave of the row cemetery comprising a total of 22 graves. Despite the spatial and temporal proximity, the genetic pathogen analyses detected two different strains of plague bacteria (Yersinia pestis). Thus, it was not one infection that was transmitted within the Bronze Age group, but two independent infection events. In this article, we present the phylogenetic positions of these two Yersinia pestis strains together with other prehistoric, historic and modern plague genomes known so far, discuss biological basics of transmission and possible transmission routes, and attempt a cultural-historical interpretation in comparison with similar anthropological and archaeological contexts.\n\n“Should we give the bones a name? (De-)personalization and objectification of prehistoric people.” In: M. Renger/S. Schreiber/A. Veling (Hrsg.) Theorie | Archäologie | Reflexion 1. Kontroversen und Ansätze im deutschsprachigen Diskurs. Theoriedenken in der Archäologie 1. Propylaeum, 423–452 (2023).\n\nK. Hofmann, C. Sanchez-Stockhammer, P.W. Stockhammer.\n\n“What is your name?” is not a question that prehistoric archaeologists can ask a person they have excavated. Rather, the ‘human remains’ are carefully documented, numbered, identified, and archived as objects. In rare cases, however, the archaeological context confronts us with an individual who seems to be looking at us from the past, because of his or her special preservation (e.g. as a bog or an ice corpse). In such cases, the finders sometimes feel compelled to give that individual a name – a new name due to their lack of knowledge of the original name, if there ever was one. Ultimately, however, most of the deceased are and remain objects for the current researchers, depersonalised remains that are desubjectivised even further in the context of archaeological documentation practices. For a few years now, bioarchaeological approaches have made it possible to shed a completely new light on the lives of these anonymous bones, allowing us to learn about the lives of these individuals in an unprecedented way. A human being with individual traits begins to emerge from the bones – a human being, however, whom we continue to list under a catalogue number and objectively refer to in the accompanying publication as “find site, grave number” (or using similar codes). But does this do justice to the deceased? Shouldn’t the new potential for gaining knowledge about past individual lives force us to consider giving a name to these individuals? Or would that pose the danger of nostrification (i.e. of making the other from a distant and alien past too much our own)? Where does the appreciation of the remains as human beings begin and where do we cross the thin line to appropriation? In our contribution we discuss current naming practices, their consequences on the perception of human remains, the results of an online survey, and future developments resulting from novel approaches to gaining knowledge. We hope to raise awareness for a reflective approach toward naming practices in archaeology and the descriptions and narratives that commonly accompany these naming practices.\n\n“Fostering Women and Mobile Children in Final Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Central Europe.” In: K. Kristiansen/G. Kroonen/E. Willerslev (Hrsg.), The Indo-European Puzzle Revisited. Integrating Archaeology, Genetics, and Linguistics. Cambridge University Press, 303–307 (2023).\n\nP.W. Stockhammer.\n\nOver the last several years, it has become clear that Central and Western Europe witnessed an enormous transformation during the third millennium – not only in cultural terms, as has long been clear from the appearance of the Corded Ware Complex (CWC) and the Bell Beaker Complex (BBC), but also from a genetic point of view: archaeogenetic analyses from Central Europe to the British Isles and the Iberian Peninsula have revealed genetic signatures with an origin in the western Eurasian steppe regions (Haak et al. 2015; Allentoft et al. 2015; Olalde et al. 2018; Olalde et al. 2019; Fernandes et al. 2020). Whereas early publications on this topic employed dubious vocabulary, like “Yamnaya migration,” there is no doubt that the spread of genes from east to west in prehistoric times could only take place through mobile individuals. Archaeogenetic studies have also suggested a sex bias in these mobile people and that the migration process was predominantly related to male mobility (Goldberg et al. 2017). Since the publication of the scientific results for the Iberian Peninsula (Olalde et al. 2019), newspapers have even interpreted this as evidence of male hoards invading Spain and committing genocide of the local male population. There is no doubt that such simplified narratives do justice neither to archaeological theory nor to the aim of narrating a complex past in a comprehensible manner.\n\n“Rethinking Migrations in Late Prehistoric Eurasia: An Introduction.” In: M. Fernández-Götz, C. Nimura, P.W. Stockhammer, R. Cartwright (Hrsg.) Rethinking Migrations in Late Prehistoric Eurasia. Proceedings of the British Academy 254. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1–20 (2023).\n\nM. Fernández-Götz, C. Nimura, P.W. Stockhammer, R. Cartwright.\n\nMobility has always been a defining feature of the human journey, from prehistory to the present. This chapter serves as an introduction to our volume on population movements in late prehistoric Eurasia, outlining the background, scope, and aims of the book. It provides definitions for key terms such as mobility, migration, colonisation, and diaspora, as well as a discussion of specific modalities such as forced migration and return migration. The history of research is outlined in order to understand the main trends, methodologies, and shifts over time, and their interconnection with the wider intellectual and political context. Finally, the chapter offers insights into the current state of research, and concludes by summarising the different contributions contained in the volume.\n\n“Mobility at the Onset of the Bronze Age: A Bioarchaeological Perspective.” In: M.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 170–188 (2023).\n\nP.W. Stockhammer, K. Massy.\n\nThis paper presents the results of a long-term interdisciplinary research project in the micro-region of the Lech Valley in southern Germany. The comprehensive bioarchaeological study of burials from the Late Neolithic until the early Middle Bronze Age brought to light a strict patrilocal system, where each farmstead was populated by a biologically related core family. In addition to that, women from afar – c. 400–600 km – came into the Lech Valley, lived in the different farmsteads, possessed a high status, but never had any offspring visible in local burial grounds. Finally, we identified the biologically non-related, local, and poor burials as the remains of menial staff living together with the nuclear family and the women from afar in each of the farmsteads, thus shedding completely new light on the complexity and social inequality of farmsteads in the Early Bronze Age.\n\n“Natural products from reconstructed bacterial genomes of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic.” Science 380: 619-624 (2023).\n\nM.

Stallforth.\n\nMajor advances over the past decade in the field of ancient DNA are providing access to past paleogenomic diversity, but the diverse functions and biosynthetic capabilities of this growing paleome remain largely elusive. We investigated the dental calculus of 12 Neanderthals and 52 anatomically modern humans ranging from 100,000 years ago to the present and reconstructed 459 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster shared by seven Middle and Upper Paleolithic individuals that allows for the heterologous production of a class of previously unknown metabolites that we name “paleofurans.” This paleobiotechnological approach demonstrates that viable biosynthetic machinery can be produced from the preserved genetic material of ancient organisms, allowing access to natural products from the Pleistocene and providing a promising area for natural product exploration.\n\nTop of Form\n\n“Ethical considerations when co-analyzing ancient DNA and data from private genetic databases.” The American Journal of Human Genetics 110: 1-7 (2023).\n\nÉ. Harney, K. Sirak, J. Sedig, S. Micheletti, R. Curry, S.A. Esselmann, D. Reich.\n\nAncient DNA studies have begun to explore the possibility of identifying identical DNA segments shared between historical and living people. This research requires access to large genetic datasets to maximize the likelihood of identifying previously unknown, close genetic connections. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, such as 23andMe, Inc., manage by far the largest and most diverse genetic databases that can be used for this purpose. It is therefore important to think carefully about guidelines for carrying out collaborations between researchers and such companies. Such collaborations require consideration of ethical issues, including policies for sharing ancient DNA datasets, and ensuring reproducibility of research findings when access to privately controlled genetic datasets is limited. At the same time, they introduce unique possibilities for returning results to the research participants whose data are analyzed, including those who are identified as close genetic relatives of historical individuals, thereby enabling ancient DNA research to contribute to the restoration of information about ancestral connections that were lost over time, which can be particularly meaningful for families and groups where such history has not been well documented. We explore these issues by describing our experience designing and carrying out a study searching for genetic connections between 18th- and 19th-century enslaved and free African Americans who labored at Catoctin Furnace, Maryland, and 23andMe research participants. We share our experience in the hope of helping future researchers navigate similar ethical considerations, recognizing that our perspective is part of a larger conversation about best ethical practices.\n\n“Interactions between Trypillian farmers and North Pontic forager-pastoralists in Eneolithic central Ukraine.” PLoS ONE 18, e0285449 (2023).\n\nA.G. Nikitin, M. Videiko, N. Patterson, V. Renson, D. Reich.\n\nThe establishment of agrarian economy in Eneolithic East Europe is associated with the Pre-Cucuteni-Cucuteni-Trypillia complex (PCCTC). PCCTC farmers interacted with Eneolithic forager-pastoralist groups of the North Pontic steppe as PCCTC extended from the Carpathian foothills to the Dnipro Valley beginning in the late 5th millennium BCE. While the cultural interaction between the two groups is evident through the Cucuteni C pottery style that carries steppe influence, the extent of biological interactions between Trypillian farmers and the steppe remains unclear. Here we report the analysis of artefacts from the late 5th millennium Trypillian settlement at the Kolomiytsiv Yar Tract (KYT) archaeological complex in central Ukraine, focusing on a human bone fragment found in the Trypillian context at KYT. Diet stable isotope ratios obtained from the bone fragment suggest the diet of the KYT individual to be within the range of forager-pastoralists of the North Pontic area. Strontium isotope ratios of the KYT individual are consistent with having originated from contexts of the Serednii Stih (Sredny Stog) culture sites of the Middle Dnipro Valley. Genetic analysis of the KYT individual indicates ancestry derived from a proto-Yamna population such as Serednii Stih. Overall, the KYT archaeological site presents evidence of interactions between Trypillians and Eneolithic Pontic steppe inhabitants of the Serednii Stih horizon and suggests a potential for gene flow between the two groups as early as the beginning of the 4th millennium BCE.\n\n“High conservation of the dental plaque microbiome community across populations with differing subsistence strategies.” Molecular Biology and Evolution (2023).\n\nI.M. Velsko, S. Gallois, R. Stahl, A. Henry, C. Warinner.\n\nIndustrialization—including urbanization, participation in the global food chain and consumption of heavily processed foods—is thought to drive substantial shifts in the human microbiome. While diet strongly influences stool microbiome composition, the influence of diet on the oral microbiome is largely speculative. Multiple ecologically distinct surfaces in the mouth, each harbouring a unique microbial community, pose a challenge to assessing changes in the oral microbiome in the context of industrialization, as the results depend on the oral site under study. Here, we investigated whether microbial communities of dental plaque, the dense biofilm on non-shedding tooth surfaces, are distinctly different across populations with dissimilar subsistence strategies and degree of industrialized market integration. Using a metagenomic approach, we compared the dental plaque microbiomes of Baka foragers and Nzime subsistence agriculturalists in Cameroon (n = 46) with the dental plaque and calculus microbiomes of highly industrialized populations in North America and Europe (n = 38). We found that differences in microbial taxonomic composition between populations were minimal, with high conservation of abundant microbial taxa and no significant differences in microbial diversity related to dietary practices. Instead, we find that the major source of variation in dental plaque microbial species composition is related to tooth location and oxygen availability, which may be influenced by toothbrushing or other dental hygiene measures. Our results support that dental plaque, in contrast to the stool microbiome, maintains an inherent stability against ecological perturbations in the oral environment.\n\n“Density separation of petrous bone powders for optimized ancient DNA yields.” Genome Research 33, 622-31 (2023).\n\nD.M.

Borgia, A. Coppa, M. Dobes, P. Veleminsky, D. Reich, L.S. Bell, R. Pinhasi.\n\nDensity separation is a process routinely used to segregate minerals, organic matter, and even microplastics, from soils and sediments. Here we apply density separation to archaeological bone powders before DNA extraction to increase endogenous DNA recovery relative to a standard control extraction of the same powders. Using nontoxic heavy liquid solutions, we separated powders from the petrous bones of 10 individuals of similar archaeological preservation into eight density intervals (2.15 to 2.45 g/cm3, in 0.05 increments). We found that the 2.30 to 2.35 g/cm3 and 2.35 to 2.40 g/cm3 intervals yielded up to 5.28-fold more endogenous unique DNA than the corresponding standard extraction (and up to 8.53-fold before duplicate read removal), while maintaining signals of ancient DNA authenticity and not reducing library complexity. Although small 0.05 g/cm3 intervals may maximally optimize yields, a single separation to remove materials with a density above 2.40 g/cm3 yielded up to 2.57-fold more endogenous DNA on average, which enables the simultaneous separation of samples that vary in preservation or in the type of material analyzed. While requiring no new ancient DNA laboratory equipment and fewer than 30 min of extra laboratory work, the implementation of density separation before DNA extraction can substantially boost endogenous DNA yields without decreasing library complexity. Although subsequent studies are required, we present theoretical and practical foundations that may prove useful when applied to other ancient DNA substrates such as teeth, other bones, and sediments.\n\n“Genetic population structure of the Xiongnu Empire at imperial and local scales.” Science Advances 9, eadf3904 (2023).\n\nJ.H. Lee, B.K. Miller, J. Bayarsaikhan, E. Johannesson, A. Ventresca Miller, C. Warinner, C. Jeong.\n\nThe Xiongnu established the first nomadic imperial power, controlling the Eastern Eurasian steppe from ca. 200 BCE to 100 CE. Recent archaeogenetic studies identified extreme levels of genetic diversity across the empire, corroborating historical records of the Xiongnu Empire being multiethnic. However, it has remained unknown how this diversity was structured at the local community level or by sociopolitical status. To address this, we investigated aristocratic and local elite cemeteries at the western frontier of the empire. Analyzing genome-wide data from 18 individuals, we show that genetic diversity within these communities was comparable to the empire as a whole, and that high diversity was also observed within extended families. Genetic heterogeneity was highest among the lowest-status individuals, implying diverse origins, while higher-status individuals harbored less genetic diversity, suggesting that elite status and power was concentrated within specific subsets of the broader Xiongnu population.\n\n“Entwined African and Asian genetic roots of medieval peoples of the Swahili coast.” Nature 615, 866-73 (2023).\n\nE.S.

Kusimba.\n\nThe urban peoples of the Swahili coast traded across eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean and were among the first practitioners of Islam among sub-Saharan people. The extent to which these early interactions between Africans and non-Africans were accompanied by genetic exchange remains unknown. Here we report ancient DNA data for 80 individuals from 6 medieval and early modern (AD 1250–1800) coastal towns and an inland town after AD 1650. More than half of the DNA of many of the individuals from coastal towns originates from primarily female ancestors from Africa, with a large proportion—and occasionally more than half—of the DNA coming from Asian ancestors. The Asian ancestry includes components associated with Persia and India, with 80–90% of the Asian DNA originating from Persian men. Peoples of African and Asian origins began to mix by about AD 1000, coinciding with the large-scale adoption of Islam. Before about AD 1500, the Southwest Asian ancestry was mainly Persian-related, consistent with the narrative of the Kilwa Chronicle, the oldest history told by people of the Swahili coast. After this time, the sources of DNA became increasingly Arabian, consistent with evidence of growing interactions with southern Arabia. Subsequent interactions with Asian and African people further changed the ancestry of present-day people of the Swahili coast in relation to the medieval individuals whose DNA we sequenced.\n\n“On the limits of fitting complex models of population history to f-statistics.” eLife 12:e85492 (2023).\n\nR. Maier, P. Flegontov, O. Flegontova, U. Isildak, P. Changmai, D. Reich.\n\nOur understanding of population history in deep time has been assisted by fitting admixture graphs ('AGs') to data: models that specify the ordering of population splits and mixtures, which along with the amount of genetic drift on each lineage and the proportions of mixture, is the only information needed to predict the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations. Not needing to specify population size changes, split times, or whether admixture events were sudden or drawn out simplifies the space of models that need to be searched. However, the space of possible AGs relating populations is vast and cannot be sampled fully, and thus most published studies have identified fitting AGs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the vast majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all AGs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this findGraphs tool within a software package, ADMIXTOOLS 2, which is a reimplementation of the ADMIXTOOLS software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to AGs that played key roles in eight published studies and find that graphs modeling more than six populations and two or three admixture events are often not unique, with many alternative models fitting nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from AGs should only be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature, that fit the allele frequency correlation data, and that are not obviously wrong.\n\n“Ancient mitogenomes from the Southern Pampas of Argentina reflect local differentiation and limited extra-regional linkages after rapid initial colonization.” American Journal of Biological Anthropology.

Nores.\n\nThis study aims to contribute to the recovery of Indigenous evolutionary history in the Southern Pampas region of Argentina through an analysis of ancient complete mitochondrial genomes. We generated DNA data for nine complete mitogenomes from the Southern Pampas, dated to between 2531 and 723 cal BP. In combination with previously published ancient mitogenomes from the region and from throughout South America, we documented instances of extra-regional lineage-sharing, and estimated coalescent ages for local lineages using a Bayesian method with tip calibrations in a phylogenetic analysis. We identified a novel mitochondrial haplogroup, B2b16, and two recently defined haplogroups, A2ay and B2ak1, as well as three local haplotypes within founder haplogroups C1b and C1d. We detected lineage-sharing with ancient and contemporary individuals from Central Argentina, but not with ancient or contemporary samples from North Patagonian or Littoral regions of Argentina, despite archeological evidence of cultural interactions with the latter regions. The estimated coalescent age of these shared lineages is ~10,000 years BP.\n\n“Kinship practices in Early Iron Age South-east Europe: Genetic and isotopic analysis of burials from the Dolge njive barrow cemetery, Dolenjska, Slovenia.” Antiquity.

Reich.\n\nThe burial of multiple individuals within a single funerary monument invites speculation about the relationships between the deceased: were they chosen on the basis of status, gender or relatedness, for example? Here, the authors present the results of aDNA and isotope analyses conducted on seven individuals from an Early Iron Age barrow at Dolge njive, south-eastern Slovenia. All seven individuals are close biological relatives. While the group composition suggests strict adherence to neither patrilineal nor matrilineal structures, the funerary tradition appears highly gendered, and family links through both the male and female lines seem important in structuring of the community. The results have implications for understanding of kinship and funerary practices in late prehistoric Europe.\n\n“Biomolecular analyses enable new insights into ancient Egyptian embalming.” Nature 614, 287–293 (2023).\n\nM.

Stockhammer.\n\nThe ability of the ancient Egyptians to preserve the human body through embalming has not only fascinated people since antiquity, but also has always raised the question of how this outstanding chemical and ritual process was practically achieved. Here we integrate archaeological, philological and organic residue analyses, shedding new light on the practice and economy of embalming in ancient Egypt. We analysed the organic contents of 31 ceramic vessels recovered from a 26th Dynasty embalming workshop at Saqqara. These vessels were labelled according to their content and/or use, enabling us to correlate organic substances with their Egyptian names and specific embalming practices. We identified specific mixtures of fragrant or antiseptic oils, tars and resins that were used to embalm the head and treat the wrappings using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses. Our study of the Saqqara workshop extends interpretations from a micro-level analysis highlighting the socio-economic status of a tomb owner to macro-level interpretations of the society. The identification of non-local organic substances enables the reconstruction of trade networks that provided ancient Egyptian embalmers with the substances required for mummification. This extensive demand for foreign products promoted trade both within the Mediterranean (for example, Pistacia and conifer by-products) and with tropical forest regions (for example, dammar and elemi). Additionally, we show that at Saqqara, antiu and sefet—well known from ancient texts and usually translated as ‘myrrh’ or ‘incense’ and ‘a sacred oil’—refer to a coniferous oils-or-tars-based mixture and an unguent with plant additives, respectively.\n\n“Dental calculus.” Handbook of Archaeological Sciences, 2nd Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, eds. M. Pollard, C. Makarewicz, and R. Armitage (2023).\n\nZ. Fagernäs, C. Warinner.\n\nDental calculus, also known as tooth tartar, is a mineralized form of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that naturally forms on teeth. Dental calculus forms through the calcification of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that forms naturally on the surface of teeth. Dental calculus is ubiquitous in the archaeological record, found in all areas of the world and in populations from all time periods. Because multiple types of biomolecules and micro-remains are preserved over long time periods in dental calculus, studies of dental calculus have many different applications. This chapter discusses how studies of dental calculus have been used to investigate the oral microbiome, the host, diet, and craft activities in the past. In addition to genetic studies of the oral microbiome, proteins and metabolites within archaeological dental calculus can also be highly informative about the microorganisms inhabiting the oral cavity, as well as host immunological response.\n\n“Ancient DNA reveals admixture history and endogamy in the prehistoric Aegean.” Nature Ecology & Evolution 7, 290-303 (2023).\n\nE.

Jeong and P.W. Stockhammer.\n\nThe Neolithic and Bronze Ages were highly transformative periods for the genetic history of Europe but for the Aegean—a region fundamental to Europe’s prehistory—the biological dimensions of cultural transitions have been elucidated only to a limited extent so far. We have analysed newly generated genome-wide data from 102 ancient individuals from Crete, the Greek mainland and the Aegean Islands, spanning from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. We found that the early farmers from Crete shared the same ancestry as other contemporaneous Neolithic Aegeans. In contrast, the end of the Neolithic period and the following Early Bronze Age were marked by ‘eastern’ gene flow, which was predominantly of Anatolian origin in Crete. Confirming previous findings for additional Central/Eastern European ancestry in the Greek mainland by the Middle Bronze Age, we additionally show that such genetic signatures appeared in Crete gradually from the seventeenth to twelfth centuries BC, a period when the influence of the mainland over the island intensified. Biological and cultural connectedness within the Aegean is also supported by the finding of consanguineous endogamy practiced at high frequencies, unprecedented in the global ancient DNA record. Our results highlight the potential of archaeogenomic approaches in the Aegean for unravelling the interplay of genetic admixture, marital and other cultural practices.\n\n“Isotopic and DNA analyses reveal multiscale PPNB mobility and migration across Southeastern Anatolia and the Southern Levant.” PNAS 120 (4) e2210611120 (2023).\n\nX.

Stockhammer.\n\nGrowing reliance on animal and plant domestication in the Near East and beyond during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) (the ninth to eighth millennium BC) has often been associated with a “revolutionary” social transformation from mobility toward more sedentary lifestyles. We are able to yield nuanced insights into the process of the Neolithization in the Near East based on a bioarchaeological approach integrating isotopic and archaeogenetic analyses on the bone remains recovered from Nevalı Çori, a site occupied from the early PPNB in Turkey where some of the earliest evidence of animal and plant domestication emerged, and from Ba'ja, a typical late PPNB site in Jordan. In addition, we present the archaeological sequence of Nevalı Çori together with newly generated radiocarbon dates. Our results are based on strontium (87Sr/86Sr), carbon, and oxygen (δ18O and δ13Ccarb) isotopic analyses conducted on 28 human and 29 animal individuals from the site of Nevalı Çori. 87Sr/86Sr results indicate mobility and connection with the contemporaneous surrounding sites during the earlier PPNB prior to an apparent decline in this mobility at a time of growing reliance on domesticates. Genome-wide data from six human individuals from Nevalı Çori and Ba'ja demonstrate a diverse gene pool at Nevalı Çori that supports connectedness within the Fertile Crescent during the earlier phases of Neolithization and evidence of consanguineous union in the PPNB Ba'ja and the Iron Age Nevalı Çori.\n\n2022\n\n“An Archaeology of Microbes.” Journal of Anthropological Research, 78 (4), 420-458 (2022).\n\nC. Warinner.\n\nHumans have a deep and complex relationship with microbes. Beyond disease, microbes also profoundly shape human health and behavior through their activity in the microbiome and their diverse roles in food and cuisine. And yet we know very little about the origin, evolution, or ecology of the trillions of microorganisms that call us home. Recent advances in genomic and proteomic technologies are opening up dramatic new opportunities in the field of microbial archaeology, enabling us to investigate the complex and diverse microbial communities that have long inhabited our human bodies and our food systems—both in sickness and in health. From epidemic disease to alcoholic beverages, microbes are the invisible and often overlooked figures that have profoundly shaped human culture and influenced the course of human history. Emerging research on microbes is impacting how we investigate the human past and changing how we understand human and microbial cultures today. Here the developing field of microbial archaeology is discussed, including its current practice and future outlook.\n\n“The Anglo-Saxon migration and the formation of the early English gene pool.” Nature 610, 112-119 (2022).\n\nJ.

Schiffels.\n\nThe history of the British Isles and Ireland is characterized by multiple periods of major cultural change, including the influential transformation after the end of Roman rule, which precipitated shifts in language, settlement patterns and material culture. The extent to which migration from continental Europe mediated these transitions is a matter of long-standing debate. Here we study genome-wide ancient DNA from 460 medieval northwestern Europeans—including 278 individuals from England—alongside archaeological data, to infer contemporary population dynamics. We identify a substantial increase of continental northern European ancestry in early medieval England, which is closely related to the early medieval and present-day inhabitants of Germany and Denmark, implying large-scale substantial migration across the North Sea into Britain during the Early Middle Ages. As a result, the individuals who we analysed from eastern England derived up to 76% of their ancestry from the continental North Sea zone, albeit with substantial regional variation and heterogeneity within sites. We show that women with immigrant ancestry were more often furnished with grave goods than women with local ancestry, whereas men with weapons were as likely not to be of immigrant ancestry. A comparison with present-day Britain indicates that subsequent demographic events reduced the fraction of continental northern European ancestry while introducing further ancestry components into the English gene pool, including substantial southwestern European ancestry most closely related to that seen in Iron Age France.\n\n“Genome-wide data from medieval German Jews show that the Ashkenazi founder event pre-dated the 14th century.” Cell 185 (25), 4703-4716 (2022).\n\nS.

Reich.\n\nWe report genome-wide data from 33 Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), dated to the 14th century, obtained following a salvage excavation at the medieval Jewish cemetery of Erfurt, Germany. The Erfurt individuals are genetically similar to modern AJ, but they show more variability in Eastern European-related ancestry than modern AJ. A third of the Erfurt individuals carried a mitochondrial lineage common in modern AJ and eight carried pathogenic variants known to affect AJ today. These observations, together with high levels of runs of homozygosity, suggest that the Erfurt community had already experienced the major reduction in size that affected modern AJ. The Erfurt bottleneck was more severe, implying substructure in medieval AJ. Overall, our results suggest that the AJ founder event and the acquisition of the main sources of ancestry pre-dated the 14th century and highlight late medieval genetic heterogeneity no longer present in modern AJ.\n\n“The diverse genetic origins of a Classical period Greek army.”PNAS 119 (41) e2205272119 (2022).\n\nL.J.

Often seen as a dividing force, warfare is in fact another catalyst of culture contact. We provide insight into the demographic dynamics of ancient warfare by reporting genome-wide data from fifth-century soldiers who fought for the army of the Greek Sicilian colony of Himera, along with representatives of the civilian population, nearby indigenous settlements, and 96 present-day individuals from Italy and Greece. Unlike the rest of the sample, many soldiers had ancestral origins in northern Europe, the Steppe, and the Caucasus. Integrating genetic, archaeological, isotopic, and historical data, these results illustrate the significant role mercenaries played in ancient Greek armies and highlight how participation in war contributed to continental-scale human mobility in the Classical world.\n\n“Finding Mycenaeans in Minoan Crete? Isotope and DNA analysis of human mobility in Bronze Age Crete.” PLOS ONE 17(8): e0272144 (2022).\n\nM. Richards, C. Smith, O. Nehlich, V. Grimes, D. Weston, A. Mittnik, J. Krause, K. Dobney, Y. Tzedakis, H. Martlew.\n\nWe undertook a large-scale study of Neolithic and Bronze Age human mobility on Crete using biomolecular methods (isotope analysis, DNA), with a particular focus on sites dating to the Late Bronze Age (‘Late Minoan’) period. We measured the strontium and sulphur isotope values of animal remains from archaeological sites around the island of Crete to determine the local baseline values. We then measured the strontium and sulphur values of humans from Late Neolithic and Bronze Age sites. Our results indicate that most of the humans have sulphur and strontium isotope values consistent with being local to Crete, showing no evidence for a wide-scale movement of people from the Greek mainland or other areas away from Crete in these time periods. However, we found four individuals from the late Bronze Age (Late Minoan III) cemetery of Armenoi with sulphur isotope values not typically found in Crete and are instead consistent with an origin elsewhere. This cemetery at Armenoi also has one of only a few examples of the newly adopted Mycenaean Linear B script on Crete found outside of the palace sites, pointing to an influence (trade and possible migration) from the mainland, which may then be the place of origin of these four individuals. DNA (mtDNA) studies of eight Late Bronze Age individuals from Armenoi have results consistent with people living in Aegean region at this time and cannot be used to distinguish between individuals from Crete (‘Minoans’) and the Greek mainland [‘Mycenaeans’]).\n\n“Ancient DNA from Protohistoric Period Cambodia indicates that South Asians admixed with local populations as early as 1st–3rd centuries CE.” Nature Scientific Reports 12, 22507 (2022).\n\nP.

Flegontov.\n\nIndian cultural influence is remarkable in present-day Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), and it may have stimulated early state formation in the region. Various present-day populations in MSEA harbor a low level of South Asian ancestry, but previous studies failed to detect such ancestry in any ancient individual from MSEA. In this study, we discovered a substantial level of South Asian admixture (ca. 40–50%) in a Protohistoric individual from the Vat Komnou cemetery at the Angkor Borei site in Cambodia. The location and direct radiocarbon dating result on the human bone (95% confidence interval is 78–234 calCE) indicate that this individual lived during the early period of Funan, one of the earliest states in MSEA, which shows that the South Asian gene flow to Cambodia started about a millennium earlier than indicated by previous published results of genetic dating relying on present-day populations. Plausible proxies for the South Asian ancestry source in this individual are present-day populations in Southern India, and the individual shares more genetic drift with present-day Cambodians than with most present-day East and Southeast Asian populations.\n\n“A Bioarchaeological Investigation of Fraternal Stillborn Twins from Tell el-Hesi.” Near Eastern Archaeology 85, 228-37 (2022).\n\nJ. Ullinger, L. Gregoricka, R. Bernardos, D. Reich, A. Langston, P. Ferreri, B. Ingram.\n\nA double nonadult burial excavated at the Ottoman period (1600–1800 CE) cemetery at Tell el-Hesi was hypothesized to belong to a set of stillborn twins. This study incorporated the use of multiple bioarchaeological techniques in order to assess both the age and survival of the perinates. Cranial and long-bone measurements were undertaken to determine age at death, while stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were considered alongside microCT assessments of bacterial bioerosion in the cortices of long bones to identify whether these infants were born alive and had breastfed. Ancient DNA analysis can now identify twins with greater certainty and was also employed to confirm the sex and biological relationship between these two individuals. Using these various lines of evidence, we test two hypotheses, ultimately finding support for both: (1) the two perinates buried together from Tell el-Hesi were fraternal female twins; and (2) these perinates were likely stillborn.\n\n“Life and death in early colonial Campeche: new insights from ancient DNA.” Antiquity 96 (388): 937-54 (2022).\n\nV.

The authors combine previous analyses with newly generated genome-wide data from 10 individuals to trace detailed life histories of the mostly young, local Indigenous Americans and first-generation European and African immigrants, none of whom show evidence of genetic admixture. These results provide insights into the individual lives and social divides of the town's founder communities and demonstrate how ancient DNA analyses can contribute to understanding early colonial encounters.\n\n“Pedigree-based Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates.” PloS ONE 17 (6), e0270374 (2022).\n\nK. Massy, R. Friedrich, A. Mittnik, P.W Stockhammer.\n\nWithin the last decade, archaeogenetic analysis has revolutionized archaeological research and enabled novel insights into mobility, relatedness and health of past societies. Now, it is possible to develop these results further and integrate archaeogenetic insights into biological relatedness with radiocarbon dates as means of chronologically sequenced information. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of combining relative chronological information with absolute radiocarbon dates by Bayesian interpretation in order to improve age determinations. Using artificial pedigrees with four sets of simulated radiocarbon dates we show that the combination of relationship information with radiocarbon dates improves the age determination in many cases at least between 20 to 50%. Calibrated age ranges are more constrained than simply calibrating radiocarbon ages independently from each other. Thereby, the precision of modelled ages depends on the precision of the single radiocarbon dates, the number of modelled generations, the shape of the calibration curve and the availability of samples that can be precisely fixed in time due to specific patterns in the calibration curve (\"anchor points\"). Ambiguous calibrated radiocarbon dates, which are caused by inversions of the calibration curve, can be partly or almost entirely resolved through Bayesian modelling based upon information from pedigrees. Finally, we discuss selected case studies of biological pedigrees achieved for Early Bronze Age Southern Germany by recent archaeogenetic analysis, whereby the sites and pedigrees differ with regard to the quality of information, which can be used for a Bayesian model of the radiocarbon dates. In accordance with the abstract models, radiocarbon dates can again be better constrained and are therefore more applicable for archaeological interpretation and chronological placement of the dated individuals.\n\n“HAYSTAC: A Bayesian framework for robust and rapid species identification in high-throughput sequencing data.” PLoS Computational Biology 18(9): e1010493 (2022).\n\nE.A. Dimopouls, A. Carmagnini, I.M. Velsko, C. Warinner, G. Larson, L.A. Frantz, E. Irving-Pease.\n\nIdentification of specific species in metagenomic samples is critical for several key applications, yet many tools available require large computational power and are often prone to false positive identifications. Here we describe High-AccuracY and Scalable Taxonomic Assignment of MetagenomiC data (HAYSTAC), which can estimate the probability that a specific taxon is present in a metagenome. HAYSTAC provides a user-friendly tool to construct databases, based on publicly available genomes, that are used for competitive read mapping. It then uses a novel Bayesian framework to infer the abundance and statistical support for each species identification and provide per-read species classification. Unlike other methods, HAYSTAC is specifically designed to efficiently handle both ancient and modern DNA data, as well as incomplete reference databases, making it possible to run highly accurate hypothesis-driven analyses (i.e., assessing the presence of a specific species) on variably sized reference databases while dramatically improving processing speeds. We tested the performance and accuracy of HAYSTAC using simulated Illumina libraries, both with and without ancient DNA damage, and compared the results to other currently available methods (i.e., Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq, MALT/HOPS, and Sigma). HAYSTAC identified fewer false positives than both Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq and MALT in all simulations, and fewer than Sigma in simulations of ancient data. It uses less memory than Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq as well as MALT both during database construction and sample analysis. Lastly, we used HAYSTAC to search for specific pathogens in two published ancient metagenomic datasets, demonstrating how it can be applied to empirical datasets. HAYSTAC is available from https://github.com/antonisdim/HAYSTAC.\n\n“Ecology, not host phylogeny, shapes the oral microbiome in closely related species.” Molecular Biology and Evolution 39:12 (2022).\n\nM. Moraitou, A. Forsythe, J.A. Fellows Yates, J.C. Brealey, C. Warinner, K. Guschanski.\n\nHost-associated microbiomes are essential for a multitude of biological processes. Placed at the contact zone between external and internal environments, the little-studied oral microbiome has important roles in host physiology and health. Here, we investigate the roles of host evolutionary relationships and ecology in shaping the oral microbiome in three closely related gorilla subspecies (mountain, Grauer's, and western lowland gorillas) using shotgun metagenomics of 46 museum-preserved dental calculus samples. We find that the oral microbiomes of mountain gorillas are functionally and taxonomically distinct from the other two subspecies, despite close evolutionary relationships and geographic proximity with Grauer's gorillas. Grauer's gorillas show intermediate bacterial taxonomic and functional, and dietary profiles. Altitudinal differences in gorilla subspecies ranges appear to explain these patterns, suggesting a close connection between dental calculus microbiomes and the environment, likely mediated through diet. This is further supported by the presence of gorilla subspecies-specific phyllosphere/rhizosphere taxa in the oral microbiome. Mountain gorillas show a high abundance of nitrate-reducing oral taxa, which may promote adaptation to a high-altitude lifestyle by modulating blood pressure. Our results suggest that ecology, rather than evolutionary relationships and geographic distribution, shape the oral microbiome in these closely related species.\n\n“Your horse is a donkey! Identifying domesticated equids from Western Iberia using collagen fingerprinting.” Journal of Archaeological Science 149:105696 (2022).\n\nR. Paladugu, K. Korzow-Richter, M.J. Valente, S. Gabriel, C. Detry, C. Warinner, C. Barrocas Dias.\n\nSkeletal remains of two equid species, Equus caballus (horse) and Equus asinus (donkey), have been found in archaeological contexts throughout Iberia since the Palaeolithic and Chalcolithic periods, respectively. These two species play different economic and cultural roles, and therefore it is important to be able to distinguish between the two species to better understand their relative importance in the past human societies. The most reliable morphological features for distinguishing between the two domesticated equids are based on cranial measurements and tooth enamel folds, leading to only a small percentage of archaeological remains that can be identified to species. Ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis can be used to reliably distinguish the two equids, but it can be cost prohibitive to apply to large assemblages, and aDNA preservation of non-cranial elements is often low. Collagen peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, also known as zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS), is a minimally destructive and cost-effective alternative to aDNA analysis for taxonomic determination. However, current ZooMS markers lack resolution below the genus level Equus. In this paper, we report a novel ZooMS peptide marker that reliably distinguishes between horses and donkeys using the enzyme chymotrypsin. We apply this peptide marker to taxonomically identify bones from the Iberian Peninsula ranging from the Iron Age to the Late Modern Period. The peptide biomarker has the potential to facilitate the collection of morphological data for zooarchaeological studies of equids in Iberia and throughout Eurasia and Africa.\n\n“Ancient dental calculus preserves signatures of biofilm succession and inter-individual variation independent of dental pathology.” PNAS Nexus 1: 1-14 (2022).\n\nI.

Hoogland, C. Warinner.\n\nDental calculus preserves oral microbes, enabling comparative studies of the oral microbiome and health through time. However, small sample sizes and limited dental health metadata have hindered health-focused investigations to date. Here, we investigate the relationship between tobacco pipe smoking and dental calculus microbiomes. Dental calculus from 75 individuals from the 19th century Middenbeemster skeletal collection (Netherlands) were analyzed by metagenomics. Demographic and dental health parameters were systematically recorded, including the presence/number of pipe notches. Comparative data sets from European populations before and after the introduction of tobacco were also analyzed. Calculus species profiles were compared with oral pathology to examine associations between microbiome community, smoking behavior, and oral health status. The Middenbeemster individuals exhibited relatively poor oral health, with a high prevalence of periodontal disease, caries, heavy calculus deposits, and antemortem tooth loss. No associations between pipe notches and dental pathologies, or microbial species composition, were found. Calculus samples before and after the introduction of tobacco showed highly similar species profiles. Observed interindividual microbiome differences were consistent with previously described variation in human populations from the Upper Paleolithic to the present. Dental calculus may not preserve microbial indicators of health and disease status as distinctly as dental plaque.\n\n“Remembering St. Louis Individual: Structural violence and acute bacterial infections in a historical anatomical collection.” Communications Biology 5:1050 (2022).\n\nR.M. Austin, M. Zuckerman, T.P. Honap, H. Lee, G.K. Ward, C. Warinner, K. Sankaranarayanan, C.A. Hofman.\n\nIncomplete documentary evidence, variable biomolecular preservation, and limited skeletal responses have hindered assessment of acute infections in the past. This study was initially developed to explore the diagnostic potential of dental calculus to identify infectious diseases, however, the breadth and depth of information gained from a particular individual, St. Louis Individual (St.LI), enabled an individualized assessment and demanded broader disciplinary introspection of ethical research conduct. Here, we document the embodiment of structural violence in a 23-year-old Black and/or African American male, who died of lobar pneumonia in 1930s St. Louis, Missouri. St.LI exhibits evidence of systemic poor health, including chronic oral infections and a probable tuberculosis infection. Metagenomic sequencing of dental calculus recovered three pre-antibiotic era pathogen genomes, which likely contributed to the lobar pneumonia cause of death (CoD): Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.8X); Acinetobacter nosocomialis (28.4X); and Acinetobacter junii (30.1X). Ante- and perimortem evidence of St.LI’s lived experiences chronicle the poverty, systemic racism, and race-based structural violence experienced by marginalized communities in St. Louis, which contributed to St.LI’s poor health, CoD, anatomization, and inclusion in the Robert J. Terry Anatomical Collection. These same embodied inequalities continue to manifest as health disparities affecting many contemporary communities in the United States.\n\n“Plastic Purity and Sacred Dairy: Microbes, Vitality and Standardisation in Mongolian Dairying.” Copenhagen Journal of Asian Studies 40(1): 66-90 (2022).\n\nB. Reichhardt, S. Abrahms-Kavunenko.\n\nBy investigating the growing use of plastics within Mongolian dairying, this paper explores emerging microbial/social assemblages as they relate to local and imported ideas of purity and hygiene. Although many Mongolian herders prefer to use dairy equipment made from materials such as wood and hide, these items are increasingly being replaced by plastic ones. As new infrastructure connects northern herders to more extensive markets, it presents challenges for herders and for the microbial communities with whom they co-exist, placing herders under increasing pressures to compete with large-scale dairy enterprises that brand, package and distribute standardized dairy products. Looking at the changing material culture of Mongolian dairying and its relationships with microbial communities, this paper examines two emergent notions of purity: the first in which sterility is generated and contained and the second in which living dairy is harnessed and grown.\n\n“The genetic history of the Southern Arc: a bridge between West Asia and Europe.” Science 377: 6609 eabm4247 (2022).\n\nI.

Two streams of migration transmitted Caucasus and Anatolian/Levantine ancestry northward, and the Yamnaya pastoralists, formed on the steppe, then spread southward into the Balkans and across the Caucasus into Armenia, where they left numerous patrilineal descendants. Anatolia was transformed by intra–West Asian gene flow, with negligible impact of the later Yamnaya migrations. This contrasts with all other regions where Indo-European languages were spoken, suggesting that the homeland of the Indo-Anatolian language family was in West Asia, with only secondary dispersals of non-Anatolian Indo-Europeans from the steppe.\n\n“Ancient DNA from Mesopotamia suggests distinct Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic migrations into Anatolia.” Science 377: 6609, 982-987 (2022).\n\nI.

We show that these and neighboring populations were formed through admixture of pre-Neolithic sources related to Anatolian, Caucasus, and Levantine hunter-gatherers, forming a Neolithic continuum of ancestry mirroring the geography of West Asia. By analyzing Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic populations of Anatolia, we show that the former were derived from admixture between Mesopotamian-related and local Epipaleolithic-related sources, but the latter experienced additional Levantine-related gene flow, thus documenting at least two pulses of migration from the Fertile Crescent heartland to the early farmers of Anatolia.\n\n“A genetic probe into the ancient and medieval history of Southern Europe and West Asia.” Science 377: 6609, 940-951 (2022).\n\nI.

Mycenaean period elites in Greece did not differ from the general population and included both people with some steppe ancestry and others, like the Griffin Warrior, without it. Similarly, people in the central area of the Urartian Kingdom around Lake Van lacked the steppe ancestry characteristic of the kingdom’s northern provinces. Anatolia exhibited extraordinary continuity down to the Roman and Byzantine periods, with its people serving as the demographic core of much of the Roman Empire, including the city of Rome itself.

Stockhammer.\n\nDuring the late 3rd millennium BCE, the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East witnessed societal changes in many regions, which are usually explained with a combination of social and climatic factors. However, recent archaeogenetic research forces us to rethink models regarding the role of infectious diseases in past societal trajectories. The plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, which was involved in some of the most destructive historical pandemics, circulated across Eurasia at least from the onset of the 3rd millennium BCE, but the challenging preservation of ancient DNA in warmer climates has restricted the identification of Y. pestis from this period to temperate climatic regions. As such, evidence from culturally prominent regions such as the Eastern Mediterranean is currently lacking. Here, we present genetic evidence for the presence of Y. pestis and Salmonella enterica, the causative agent of typhoid/enteric fever, from this period of transformation in Crete, detected at the cave site Hagios Charalambos. We reconstructed one Y. pestis genome that forms part of a now-extinct lineage of Y. pestis strains from the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age that were likely not yet adapted for transmission via fleas. Furthermore, we reconstructed two ancient S. enterica genomes from the Para C lineage, which cluster with contemporary strains that were likely not yet fully host adapted to humans. The occurrence of these two virulent pathogens at the end of the Early Minoan period in Crete emphasizes the necessity to re-introduce infectious diseases as an additional factor possibly contributing to the transformation of early complex societies in the Aegean and beyond.\n\n“The source of the Black Death in fourteenth-century central Eurasia.” Nature 606, 718–724 (2022).\n\nM.A. Spyrou, L.

Krause.\n\nThe origin of the medieval Black Death pandemic (AD 1346–1353) has been a topic of continuous investigation because of the pandemic’s extensive demographic impact and long-lasting consequences. Until now, the most debated archaeological evidence potentially associated with the pandemic’s initiation derives from cemeteries located near Lake Issyk-Kul of modern-day Kyrgyzstan. These sites are thought to have housed victims of a fourteenth-century epidemic as tombstone inscriptions directly dated to 1338–1339 state ‘pestilence’ as the cause of death for the buried individuals. Here we report ancient DNA data from seven individuals exhumed from two of these cemeteries, Kara-Djigach and Burana. Our synthesis of archaeological, historical and ancient genomic data shows a clear involvement of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis in this epidemic event. Two reconstructed ancient Y. pestis genomes represent a single strain and are identified as the most recent common ancestor of a major diversification commonly associated with the pandemic’s emergence, here dated to the first half of the fourteenth century. Comparisons with present-day diversity from Y. pestis reservoirs in the extended Tian Shan region support a local emergence of the recovered ancient strain. Through multiple lines of evidence, our data support an early fourteenth-century source of the second plague pandemic in central Eurasia.\n\n“Palaeogenomic analysis of black rat (Rattus rattus) reveals multiple European introductions associated with human economic history.” Nature Communications 13:2399 (2022).\n\nH.

Orton.\n\nThe distribution of the black rat (Rattus rattus) has been heavily influenced by its association with humans. The dispersal history of this non-native commensal rodent across Europe, however, remains poorly understood, and different introductions may have occurred during the Roman and medieval periods. Here, in order to reconstruct the population history of European black rats, we first generate a de novo genome assembly of the black rat. We then sequence 67 ancient and three modern black rat mitogenomes, and 36 ancient and three modern nuclear genomes from archaeological sites spanning the 1st-17th centuries CE in Europe and North Africa. Analyses of our newly reported sequences, together with published mitochondrial DNA sequences, confirm that black rats were introduced into the Mediterranean and Europe from Southwest Asia. Genomic analyses of the ancient rats reveal a population turnover in temperate Europe between the 6th and 10th centuries CE, coincident with an archaeologically attested decline in the black rat population. The near disappearance and re-emergence of black rats in Europe may have been the result of the breakdown of the Roman Empire, the First Plague Pandemic, and/or post-Roman climatic cooling.\n\n“Ancient genomes from the Himalayas illuminate the genetic history of Tibetans and their Tibeto-Burman speaking neighbors.” Nature Communications 13:1203 (2022).\n\nC.

Jeong.\n\nPresent-day Tibetans have adapted both genetically and culturally to the high altitude environment of the Tibetan Plateau, but fundamental questions about their origins remain unanswered. Recent archaeological and genetic research suggests the presence of an early population on the Plateau within the past 40 thousand years, followed by the arrival of subsequent groups within the past 10 thousand years. Here, we obtain new genome-wide data for 33 ancient individuals from high elevation sites on the southern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau in Nepal, who we show are most closely related to present-day Tibetans. They derive most of their ancestry from groups related to Late Neolithic populations at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau but also harbor a minor genetic component from a distinct and deep Paleolithic Eurasian ancestry. In contrast to their Tibetan neighbors, present-day non-Tibetan Tibeto-Burman speakers living at mid-elevations along the southern and eastern margins of the Plateau form a genetic cline that reflects a distinct genetic history. Finally, a comparison between ancient and present-day highlanders confirms ongoing positive selection of high altitude adaptive alleles.\n\n“Ancient DNA and deep population structure in sub-Saharan African foragers.” Nature 603: 290–296 (2022).\n\nM.

Prendergast.\n\nMultiple lines of genetic and archaeological evidence suggest that there were major demographic changes in the terminal Late Pleistocene epoch and early Holocene epoch of sub-Saharan Africa. Inferences about this period are challenging to make because demographic shifts in the past 5,000 years have obscured the structures of more ancient populations. Here we present genome-wide ancient DNA data for six individuals from eastern and south-central Africa spanning the past approximately 18,000 years (doubling the time depth of sub-Saharan African ancient DNA), increase the data quality for 15 previously published ancient individuals and analyse these alongside data from 13 other published ancient individuals. The ancestry of the individuals in our study area can be modelled as a geographically structured mixture of three highly divergent source populations, probably reflecting Pleistocene interactions around 80–20 thousand years ago, including deeply diverged eastern and southern African lineages, plus a previously unappreciated ubiquitous distribution of ancestry that occurs in highest proportion today in central African rainforest hunter-gatherers. Once established, this structure remained highly stable, with limited long-range gene flow. These results provide a new line of genetic evidence in support of hypotheses that have emerged from archaeological analyses but remain contested, suggesting increasing regionalization at the end of the Pleistocene epoch.\n\n“Paleoproteomics.” Chemical Reviews (2022).\n\nC.

Paleoproteomics research leverages the longevity and diversity of proteins to explore fundamental questions about the past. While its origins predate the characterization of DNA, it was only with the advent of soft ionization mass spectrometry that the study of ancient proteins became truly feasible. Technological gains over the past 20 years have allowed increasing opportunities to better understand preservation, degradation, and recovery of the rich bioarchive of ancient proteins found in the archaeological and paleontological records. Growing from a handful of studies in the 1990s on individual highly abundant ancient proteins, paleoproteomics today is an expanding field with diverse applications ranging from the taxonomic identification of highly fragmented bones and shells and the phylogenetic resolution of extinct species to the exploration of past cuisines from dental calculus and pottery food crusts and the characterization of past diseases. More broadly, these studies have opened new doors in understanding past human–animal interactions, the reconstruction of past environments and environmental changes, the expansion of the hominin fossil record through large scale screening of nondiagnostic bone fragments, and the phylogenetic resolution of the vertebrate fossil record. Even with these advances, much of the ancient proteomic record still remains unexplored. Here we provide an overview of the history of the field, a summary of the major methods and applications currently in use, and a critical evaluation of current challenges. We conclude by looking to the future, for which innovative solutions and emerging technology will play an important role in enabling us to access the still unexplored “dark” proteome, allowing for a fuller understanding of the role ancient proteins can play in the interpretation of the past.\n\n“Lowest Common Ancestor for SAM/BAM/CRAM alignment files.” Journal of Open Source Science 7(74), 4360 (2022).\n\nM.

Richter, M. Seabrook, M. Codlin M, C. Warinner.\n\nCollagen peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, also known as zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS), is a rapidly growing analytical technique in the fields of archaeology, ecology, and cultural heritage. Minimally destructive and cost effective, ZooMS enables rapid taxonomic identification of large bone assemblages, cultural heritage objects, and other organic materials of animal origin. As its importance grows as both a research and a conservation tool, it is critical to ensure that its expanding body of users understands its fundamental principles, strengths, and limitations. Here, we outline the basic functionality of ZooMS and provide guidance on interpreting collagen spectra from archaeological bones. We further examine the growing potential of applying ZooMS to nonmammalian assemblages, discuss available options for minimally and nondestructive analyses, and explore the potential for peptide mass fingerprinting to be expanded to noncollagenous proteins. We describe the current limitations of the method regarding accessibility, and we propose solutions for the future. Finally, we review the explosive growth of ZooMS over the past decade and highlight the remarkably diverse applications for which the technique is suited. Zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) is a powerful application of collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) first developed just over a decade ago. Based on the measurement of tryptic collagen peptides using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer, it leverages the high abundance and long-term preservation of collagen in bone and other animal tissues with the analytical power of mass spectrometry (MS) in order to provide robust taxonomic identifications using minimally destructive methods. Since 2009, ZooMS has been used for diverse applications in archaeology and paleontology, ecology and conservation, and cultural heritage. The key features of ZooMS that have led to its rapid expansion are its low sample input requirements and its relatively low analytical cost per sample compared with other biomolecular identification methods. This allows for large-scale taxonomic investigations that can augment morphological analyses of faunal assemblages as well as provide taxonomic clarity for animal remains or products lacking diagnostic features, as is common for worked bone artifacts and cultural heritage objects.\n\n“Stone Age Yersinia pestis genomes shed light on the early evolution, diversity, and ecology of plague.” PNAS 119(17): e2116722119 (2022).\n\nA.

Stockhammer, W. Haak, J. Krause, A. Herbig.\n\nThe bacterium Yersinia pestis has caused numerous historically documented outbreaks of plague and research using ancient DNA could demonstrate that it already affected human populations during the Neolithic. However, the pathogen’s genetic diversity, geographic spread, and transmission dynamics during this early period of Y. pestis evolution are largely unexplored. Here, we describe a set of ancient plague genomes up to 5,000 y old from across Eurasia. Our data demonstrate that two genetically distinct forms of Y. pestis evolved in parallel and were both distributed across vast geographic distances, potentially occupying different ecological niches. Interpreted within the archeological context, our results suggest that the spread of plague during this period was linked to increased human mobility and intensification of animal husbandry.\n\n“Emergence and intensification of dairying in the Caucasus and Eurasian steppes.” Nature Ecology and Evolution 6, 813–822 (2022).\n\nA.

Warinner. 2022)\n\nArchaeological and archaeogenetic evidence points to the Pontic–Caspian steppe zone between the Caucasus and the Black Sea as the crucible from which the earliest steppe pastoralist societies arose and spread, ultimately influencing populations from Europe to Inner Asia. However, little is known about their economic foundations and the factors that may have contributed to their extensive mobility. Here, we investigate dietary proteins within the dental calculus proteomes of 45 individuals spanning the Neolithic to Greco-Roman periods in the Pontic–Caspian Steppe and neighbouring South Caucasus, Oka–Volga–Don and East Urals regions. We find that sheep dairying accompanies the earliest forms of Eneolithic pastoralism in the North Caucasus. During the fourth millennium BC, Maykop and early Yamnaya populations also focused dairying exclusively on sheep while reserving cattle for traction and other purposes. We observe a breakdown in livestock specialization and an economic diversification of dairy herds coinciding with aridification during the subsequent late Yamnaya and North Caucasus Culture phases, followed by severe climate deterioration during the Catacomb and Lola periods. The need for additional pastures to support these herds may have driven the heightened mobility of the Middle and Late Bronze Age periods. Following a hiatus of more than 500 years, the North Caucasian steppe was repopulated by Early Iron Age societies with a broad mobile dairy economy, including a new focus on horse milking.\n\n“Understanding the microbial biogeography of ancient human dentitions to guide study design and interpretation.” FEMS Microbes 3: xtac006 (2022).\n\nZ.

Warinner.\n\nThe oral cavity is a heterogeneous environment, varying in factors such as pH, oxygen levels, and salivary flow. These factors affect the microbial community composition and distribution of species in dental plaque, but it is not known how well these patterns are reflected in archaeological dental calculus. In most archaeological studies, a single sample of dental calculus is studied per individual and is assumed to represent the entire oral cavity. However, it is not known if this sampling strategy introduces biases into studies of the ancient oral microbiome. Here, we present the results of a shotgun metagenomic study of a dense sampling of dental calculus from four Chalcolithic individuals from the southeast Iberian peninsula (ca. 4500–5000 BP). Interindividual differences in microbial composition are found to be much larger than intraindividual differences, indicating that a single sample can indeed represent an individual in most cases. However, there are minor spatial patterns in species distribution within the oral cavity that should be taken into account when designing a study or interpreting results. Finally, we show that plant DNA identified in the samples is likely of postmortem origin, demonstrating the importance of including environmental controls or additional lines of biomolecular evidence in dietary interpretations.\n\n“The spatiotemporal patterns of major human admixture events during the European Holocene.” eLife 77625 (2022).\n\nM. Chintalapati, N. Patterson, P. Moorjani.\n\nRecent studies have shown that admixture has been pervasive throughout human history. While several methods exist for dating admixture in contemporary populations, they are not suitable for sparse, low coverage ancient genomic data. Thus, we developed DATES (Distribution of Ancestry Tracts of Evolutionary Signals) that leverages ancestry covariance patterns across the genome of a single individual to infer the timing of admixture. DATES provides reliable estimates under various demographic scenarios and outperforms available methods for ancient DNA applications.
