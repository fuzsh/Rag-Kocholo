        "text": "Warning! I‚Äôm plagiarising‚Ä¶ myself‚Ä¶ by reposting something I‚Äôd written before!üí• I just read Noam Chomsky‚Äôs view on generative AI systems as be glorified plagiarism machines, and a threat to academic writing. While I have enormous respect for Prof. Chomsky, an intellectual giant of great influence, I can‚Äôt help but feel that his views here are nostalgic and equivalent to those on the flaws and inferior performance of the mechanical horse today known as the car. ChatGPT, Baird and the multitude of other generative AI system herald the arrival of not just a new generation of incredibly powerful AI systems, but more importantly the arrival of an entirely different way of working in the creative fields (writing, music composition, graphic arts, software development, etc). Rather than attempting to discredit these tools through terms like ‚Äúplagiarism‚Äù, we should invest our energy into redesigning curricula and job descriptions to leverage these tools in positive and productive ways. But I digress, back to plagiarising myself‚Ä¶ Are generative AI systems glorified plagiarism machines? I would strongly argue they are not. To quote from an OpenAI blog post: ‚ÄúTo train a generative model we first collect a large amount of data in some domain (e.g., think millions of images, sentences, or sounds, etc.) and then train a model to generate data like it ‚Ä¶ The trick is that the neural networks we use as generative models have a number of parameters significantly smaller than the amount of data we train them on, so the models are forced to discover and efficiently internalize the essence of the data in order to generate it.‚Äù To translate this, generative AI models do not store any of the examples they are trained on. Instead, they create an abstract representation of what it means to create the type of data they have been exposed to. This abstract representation (the genrative network) is able to create content, such as an image or paragraph of text, in response to a stimulus. This, at a high conceptual level, is no different to an art student who has studied and been inspired by the works of great painters, or a budding writer who has read widely and evolved a writing style influenced by the readings. Thus, imho generative AI systems are not plagiarism machines or copyright infringers. But they certainly are a potential disruptive force when it comes to content creation! #ai #neuralnetworks #content #generativeai"
