        "text": "Agree or disagree with Chomsky—and there is ample reason to do both—anyone of any ideological bent might at least find much to admire in his approach to thinking—which is to say that he does it with depth, rigor, and a reliance on data. When roughly 60% of news consumers get their news entirely in headlines and the same number share stories online that they haven’t read, it turns out that’s not such a small deal. On top of that, Noam Chomsky is also pretty funny. You'll want to hear him explain what he means when he says, “The history of life on earth refutes the claim that it’s better to be smart than stupid.”\n\nHow to listen to The New York Public Library Podcast\n\nSubscribing to The NYPL Podcast on your mobile device is the easiest way to make sure you never miss an episode.
