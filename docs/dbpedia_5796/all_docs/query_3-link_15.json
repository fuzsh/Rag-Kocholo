        "text": "What is linguistics?\n\nWhile Skinner focused on the language people were observed using, Chomsky was interested in the underlying structure of language. This shift in focus affected not only how we view the structure of language, but how it might be learned as well; while Skinner believed that children learn language by imitating and repeating what they hear, Chomsky hypothesized that language learning went far deeper than that.\n\nChomsky made the study of language scientific. He demonstrated that despite the observable variety of the world’s languages, there is likely only one inventory of linguistic features. All languages — dead, still used, or even future ones — are combinations of these elements. After Chomsky, linguistics is defined as ‘the scientific study of language’— ‘language’ in the singular.\n\nWhy does the scientific study of linguistics matter?\n\nWhen we treat language as a science, we can:\n\nStart with general theories that explain why languages are the way they are. Chomsky’s theory, for example, says that there is a universal basis, or faculty, in the mind, innate in every human and dedicated to language, that incorporates the basic features of language. What we all do while learning our mother tongue at a tender age, then, is determine relationships between these features based on the data we get by exposure to an unorganized and random set of utterances via interaction with other speakers.\n\nThen, these theories generate testable hypotheses, rules, and falsifiable predictions about what occurs in a language, relative to all human languages. The data used to test these hypotheses are native speakers’ intuitions on the grammatical and ungrammatical nature of the sentences of their language: What we study is what people implicitly know about their language. We do not study whether sentences abide by the ‘rules’ of grammar, but whether grammatical and ungrammatical sentences can be explained with the hypotheses we make.\n\nTo give an example, we don’t study why ‘He love mangoes’ is incorrect; rather, we investigate why ‘John eats occasionally mangos’ is not a well-formed sentence in English, while it is perfectly grammatical in Greek. What prevents the adverb ‘occasionally’ from being placed between the verb ‘eats’ and the noun ‘mangos’ in English, but not in Greek? Or take Sicilian and Italian, for example — what makes them so grammatically different? By examining native speakers’ underlying knowledge we get a better understanding of how the mind works: language is a window into the mind.\n\nAnd finally, we see how well these theories can accommodate empirical data. This can result in hypotheses being changed, refined, or even abandoned after they are tested. As our theories about the structure of language grow, they help to inform theories of how languages might be learned.\n\nIn linguistics, as in the other sciences, we aim at explaining some data and not everything — making small steps at a time. Many steps have been made since 1957, but we still have a long way to go. However, we have a solid path to follow thanks to Noam Chomsky.\n\nEmbark on a new linguistic adventure today with Mango’s 70+ language and culture courses.
