        "text": "Few American thinkers have held as renowned a standing and widely acknowledged expertise on such a broad range of topics as Noam Chomsky. Chomsky’s unmatched command on a multitude of issues has proven both versatile and sustained since the mid-twentieth century. Chomsky has reliably written, presented, and commented on many of the most prominent topics in US and global current events and history throughout his career, and his critiques and analyses have spanned education and society, systemic racism, domestic politics, linguistics and education, geopolitical structures, and more. This chapter seeks to offer a broad biographical overview of Chomsky’s life and works and, using a variety of primary and second-hand sources, aims to illustrate some of his motivations, key contributions, and legacies. The Introduction will shed light on Chomsky’s education and career, family and early life, and political dispositions. Following an analysis of Chomsky’s possible influences, the chapter will offer a summary of his key contributions. Next, a section on new insights will precede an outline of elements of still-unfinished business in Chomsky’s prolific career of impressive accomplishments and unmatched impact. Finally, the chapter’s conclusion will summarize Chomsky’s astounding contributions to educational thinking."
