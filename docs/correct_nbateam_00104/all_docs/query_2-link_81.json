        "text": "A professional basketball team, the Oklahoma City Thunder plays in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). For the first 41 years of its existence, the franchise was based in Seattle and named the Seattle Supersonics. The Supersonics won three conference titles (1978, 1979, 1996) and the 1979 NBA championship. The team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008.\n\nThe Supersonics began play in 1967 and were the first major North American sports franchise based in the Pacific Northwest. Their name was inspired by Seattle’s aerospace industry and was usually shortened to the Sonics. Early teams were notable for featuring player-coach Lenny Wilkens, guard Fred (Downtown Freddie) Brown, and All-Star center-forward Spencer Haywood. The Sonics first made the play-offs in the 1974–75 season, when the team, under the guidance of head coach Bill Russell, finished 43–39 and defeated the Detroit Pistons in a first-round postseason series.\n\nDuring the 1977–78 season Wilkens returned to Seattle to serve as the team’s head coach. He turned around a Sonics team that was 5–17 at the time of his hire and led them to a fourth-place conference finish. In the play-offs the Sonics defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, the Portland Trail Blazers, and the Denver Nuggets to reach the NBA finals, where they lost to the Washington Bullets. The two teams met in the finals again the following season, with the Sonics—led by guards Dennis Johnson and Gus Williams, as well as center Jack Sikma—winning the rematch to capture the team’s first NBA championship. Seattle advanced to the conference finals again in 1979–80 but was eliminated by a Lakers team featuring rookie sensation Magic Johnson.\n\nIn the 1980s the Sonics frequently made the play-offs, with one notable postseason run coming in 1986–87. After posting a lackluster 39–43 record in the regular season, the Sonics upset the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets in the play-offs en route to another conference finals loss to the Lakers. George Karl became Seattle’s head coach midway through the 1991–92 season, taking over a high-flying team that starred point guard Gary Payton and power forward Shawn Kemp. In Karl’s first full season as coach (1992–93), the Supersonics advanced to the Western Conference finals but were defeated by the Phoenix Suns. In the next season the Sonics compiled the best regular-season record in the NBA only to become the first top-seeded team in league history to lose in the first round of the play-offs to an eighth-seeded team (the Denver Nuggets). In 1995–96 the Sonics posted a 64–18 record, the best in the Western Conference that year and at the time the 10th best in NBA history. In the postseason the Supersonics won their first three play-off series to reach the NBA finals, where they lost to Michael Jordan and the dominant Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe Sonics followed their NBA finals run with two straight seasons that ended in a second-round play-off loss. Karl was fired in 1998, and Seattle entered a rebuilding period. Led by head coach Nate McMillan and the shooting of Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis, the Sonics won a surprising division championship in 2004–05 and advanced to the conference semifinals.\n\nWhile the team struggled in the early 2000s, a number of off-court events cast doubt on the team’s future in Seattle. Among them were the sale of the Sonics to a group of Oklahoma-based investors and the state and city governments’ refusals to pay for a publicly funded arena. In 2008 the franchise was relocated to Oklahoma City and renamed as the Thunder. The team quickly rebuilt and, behind the standout play of forward Kevin Durant, made the play-offs in its second season in Oklahoma City."
