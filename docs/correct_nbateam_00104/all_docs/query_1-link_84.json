        "text": "Thunder general manager Sam Presti looked into the crowd of well-dressed people at the Skirvin Hilton in downtown Oklahoma City. This wasn’t just a night to honor the Thunder general manager. This gathering was an opportunity for the Thunder organization to let those in attendance in on the principles they wanted to remain long after jump shots and championship runs.\n\nSo, as Presti accepted the Humanitarian Award from the Oklahoma Center for Community and Justice in 2016, he understood he had a platform as well. This was a room of predominantly White people in a state that was marked 72 percent White in the last U.S. Census. The mayor of Oklahoma City. Politicians. Business owners. People with money, influence and control who were there for a night to support the OCCJ’s mission to eliminate bias, bigotry and racism in Oklahoma but might otherwise never hear such a message outside those walls.\n\nIn 12 years, the Thunder have been a common ground not only for fans of the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University but also for different races and people of socioeconomic backgrounds who might never have the incentive to root for the same cause. More importantly, the Thunder have ascended to a level of real influence in the state.\n\nPresti didn’t have to say what he did about diversity, but he did.\n\n“A lot of people see it as an outcome or a goal when in reality it’s a catalyst,” Presti said. “It’s a means to an end, it’s not the end itself.\n\n“Diversity, acceptance and inclusion: These are not things you do. These are things you live. These are not destinations. These are starting points. Our diversity is our catalyst. It helps us create. It is not an outcome or box that needs to be checked.”\n\nThat was four years ago.\n\nBefore the NBA and businesses around the United States assessed their diversity in 2020, the Thunder were prioritizing a front office and staff that wasn’t dependent on the world around them to change.\n\nThe Thunder wanted to create change. Social justice has become a point of emphasis for the NBA players in the Orlando restart in the months following the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. But prior to this year’s Black Lives Matter protests, prior to late responses by businesses and sports teams to get more color into front offices being criticized for their lack of diversity, the Thunder were elevating and empowering women and people of color in their own front office.\n\n“If you are serious about leading, creating and impacting the city you call home, create opportunity for people that are different,” Presti said in 2016. “Be a catalyst. Be a creator.”\n\nTen NBA franchises currently have general managers who are minorities or people of color, but three of those 10 — Detroit’s Troy Weaver, Denver’s Calvin Booth and Chicago’s Marc Eversley — have been hired since May. None of those 10 have had their job longer than three seasons — all have been hired since 2017. It wasn’t until The Undefeated published a scathing piece in April on the lack of diversity in NBA front offices that the numbers saw their most recent spike.\n\nIn a league that’s predominantly powered by Black players, the numbers in NBA front offices are disproportionate. The Thunder, however, don’t run their front office with the intention of hiring minorities and women but as a core tenant of what is required to run a business.\n\nWhen Presti was hired by the Seattle SuperSonics in 2007, his first hire as general manager was Scott Perry, who worked in the Pistons’ front office during multiple NBA Finals and Eastern Conference finals appearances in the 2000s. Presti also kept Rich Cho, who was a longtime SuperSonics executive. As assistant general managers, Perry and Cho comprised one of the most diverse front-office setups in the NBA, and Weaver was added to the Thunder’s front office in 2008 as a vice president/assistant general manager, replacing Perry, who went back to Detroit.\n\n“Sam did a good job bringing diversity in the workplace,” Cho, now the vice president of basketball strategy for the Memphis Grizzlies, told The Athletic. “It’s definitely something you notice.\n\n“It’s also important to have diversity because every person looks at experiences through their own lens. The more diversity you have, the more perspective you’ll have on different topics. When an issue or problem arises, you can tackle it from a lot of different angles than with a staff that’s not as diverse.”\n\nIn 12 seasons in Oklahoma City, the Thunder have taken pride in not just the hiring of people of color and women but their advancement within their organization or other NBA teams. Former Thunder players (Royal Ivey, Mike Wilks, Nazr Mohammed, Eric Maynor) get opportunities not just as coaches but as scouts. Assistant general managers such as Weaver, Perry and Cho are sought after by other organizations. The Thunder have had a handful of Black security assistants go on to become security directors with other teams.\n\nBlack women such as Ayana Lawson, the Thunder’s senior director of community and lifestyle services, and Amanda Green, vice president of team counsel and strategic alignment, have established key roles in the organization over eight to 12 years. Lawson started as an intern in Memphis, became a video coordinator for the WNBA’s Seattle Storm, then added the title of player services coordinator of the Seattle SuperSonics before moving with the team to Oklahoma City in 2008 to become the director of player services.\n\nThe Thunder created a position for Green in 2012 after she had interned under Presti in San Antonio, where he was the assistant general manager. Green, who has worked as an intellectual property attorney for the NBA, has been integral in the Thunder front office’s handling of the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement over the past eight years.\n\nBut inclusion goes beyond titles. When the Thunder were courting Anthony Morrow in free agency in 2014, Weaver played a major role in convincing him to come to Oklahoma City. During the pre-draft process, Green and Lawson are meeting players for dinner. The Thunder have specifically created initiatives within their organization to help players transition into front-office roles.\n\nMohammed wasn’t the first Thunder player to transition from the court to the front office — Mike Wilks became a Thunder scout, then assistant coach after his playing career — but he was the first player to accept a position as a professional evaluation scout under the Thunder’s initiative to help create education for former players in off-court careers.\n\nIn three seasons, Mohammed went from a pro scout to being considered for a front-office role with the Chicago Bulls in April.\n\n“You have to give a lot of credit to Sam in the sense of he gets the best talent, regardless of it being minority or any other subgroup, but through the process, he’s also a person who’s open and aware of filling positions that are there,” Mohammad told The Athletic.\n\nFormer players such as Mohammed are often the beneficiaries of post-career jobs within the front office. But people of color and women who want to get into the NBA and don’t have a background as a player often have it tougher. It’s why what the Thunder are working on in cooperation with Creative Artists Agency is important.\n\nIn early July, the Thunder and CAA announced the Thunder Fellows Program, a partnership designed to assist Black high school and college students to career opportunities in professional sports. Just as important is the location of the program. The Thunder’s Data & Analytics Center will be built at a to-be-determined site in the Historic Greenwood District of Tulsa, the site of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in which Black businesses were destroyed and hundreds of Blacks were killed by White rioters.\n\nMohammad planted the seeds for his post-playing career well before he retired, making it known to front-office figures around the league that he wanted to become an executive. The Thunder Fellows Program is an effort to create career opportunities and a pipeline for Black students into sports who otherwise might not have the opportunity.\n\n“That’s something that the Thunder and Sam — everything we do, we kind of do there — we’re going to go forward and have an impact as far as helping minorities get into the business, whether there was a partnership or not, because it’s in the DNA of the Thunder,” Mohammed said. “It’s great to see, starting a partnership like that, because it’s going to give people opportunities that probably wouldn’t have gotten those opportunities.”\n\nIn the lead-up to the NBA’s restart, a point of emphasis for NBA commissioner Adam Silver, NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum and the National Basketball Players Association has been the lack of diversity among league executives.\n\n“I am encouraged that the last three GMs that have been hired have been African-American, but we have more work to do,” Tatum said in July. “It’s the most number of African-American GMs that we’ve had in the last 15, 20 years, but we still have more work to do. But I’m encouraged that our teams are also making that commitment to building that pipeline and to providing opportunities for African-Americans, for women in this league.”\n\nIn Orlando, Thunder guard Chris Paul has been adamant about keeping the focus on the Black Lives Matter movement and social justice. Included in that focus is the continued reform of the NBA’s front offices.\n\n“It’s predominantly African-American players; you would like to see more people hired in executive positions,” said Paul, the president of the NBPA. “So the league has told us, and I think it’s up to us, the players, the union, to make sure we hold them to that and make sure that more people of color, women, continue to keep being in these executive roles all throughout the league.”\n\nThe importance of diversity in front offices hasn’t been lost on the players. Thunder players celebrated the hiring of Weaver in Detroit not just because the longtime executive waited more than a decade to get his shot at running a franchise. Weaver’s elevation to general manager in Detroit can provide an entry point for future Black executives, as well as inspiration.\n\nFormer Thunder forward Kevin Durant said it was just as important to see Weaver excel at his position as it was to see him attain it.\n\n“You like to see people in those positions who actually know what they’re doing,” Durant told The Athletic. “A lot of people don’t really know what those positions mean.\n\n“To see guys like Troy who are consummate professionals, who come to work every single day and is good at his job on top of being Black, it holds me accountable and makes me better every day to see a person stand up for what he believes in as far as being professional, building relationships with guys from Day 1 and actually loving being on the court, actually loving basketball. I think Troy exemplifies that every single day. I wish every executive did that throughout the league.”\n\nMorrow looks at the ascension of Black executives in NBA front offices as a culture-shifting move, one that’s bigger than the recent string of hired Black general managers.\n\n“When you see African-American GMs that have success, this is huge,” Morrow told The Athletic. “It’s not just about Troy. It’s bigger than him. It’s big for other African-American executives, coaches, player development guys, film guys, to see that.\n\n“You don’t feel like there’s a ceiling where you’re not going to be able to go any higher than you are now or higher than assistant coach. This is like confirmation. There are a lot of guys I want to see in his position one day. It’s more about putting that work in. When you look at how many African-American GMs (there are), there’s not many of them. When you see one of them get that, it’s confirmation for my young guys, my homies in player development, assistant coaches to see that. It’s like ‘all right’ because you know he’s going to bring some people with him, and those guys will have an opportunity now. It’s one of those opportunities where he can open that door for more guys with that same basketball mind and passion he has.”\n\nWeaver was a massive part of the Thunder’s front office but leaves a void — and an opportunity — in his departure.\n\nThe Thunder haven’t made a formal announcement about who will replace Weaver, but Will Dawkins — who has been with them for more than a decade and has led the scouting department since 2017 — is primed to be elevated to a larger role. When that happens, it will be another example of what Mohammed said was in the Thunder’s DNA.\n\nPart of that DNA was Presti’s speaking to a ballroom of suits in 2016, four years before a nation was once again forced to pay attention to the inequalities in plain sight.\n\n“I’ve felt like where I was in a situation on other teams where there weren’t any people of color or minorities in the front office,” Mohammed said. “You just didn’t see much of it, or there weren’t any who had any power in those positions.\n\n“With Oklahoma City, it’s always kind of been there. We’ve always had Troy, Amanda, Will — you see a lot of people in positions where they are contributing and are a huge part of the organization.”\n\n(Photo of Nazr Mohammed and Sam Presti: Andrew D.
