        "text": "This post was written in partnership with Sling TV.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder exceeded expectations again last season, taking a spot in the 2024 Playoffs. Unfortunately, the team wasn't about to beat out the Mavs to get to the Finals. Now, fans can get ready for the 2024/25 season.\n\nFor OKC fans, there are plenty of ways to watch the team’s games — even without a cable subscription. Below, we’ll explain how to tune into Thunder basketball using live TV streaming services.\n\nWhat channels are Oklahoma City Thunder games on this season?\n\nAs part of the NBA’s long-standing agreement with Disney and Turner Sports, you can find national NBA broadcasts on ABC, ESPN and TNT. NBA TV airs its own slate of national games as well. Across these four networks, OKC fans can watch 13 nationally televised games featuring the Thunder in 2023-24.\n\nOther games will air on Bally Sports Oklahoma, the Thunder’s regional broadcast partner. However, the team recently announced that it would show its remaining Friday night games on local over-the-air channels across Oklahoma (including KSBI in Oklahoma City) instead of Bally Sports Oklahoma. Unfortunately, due to contractual issues, these games will not be available on streaming services.\n\nSo, which live TV streaming services carry these networks? Here’s a quick look at where to find every channel you need to watch Thunder basketball.\n\nSling TV DIRECTV STREAM Fubo Hulu + Live TV YouTube TV ABC\n\n✔*\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\nESPN\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\nTNT\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\nNBA TV\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\nBally Sports Oklahoma\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n*Local channels only available in select markets\n\nHow to watch the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sling TV (Featured partner)\n\nIf other streaming options are a little too pricey for you, turn to Sling. Sling TV offers a way to keep up with the Thunder this season — at a much lower price point. With a subscription to Sling Orange, plus the Sports Extra add-on, you can catch every national OKC broadcast in 2023-24. This package comes with 45 channels, including ESPN, TNT and NBA TV, plus 50 hours of cloud DVD storage. You’d need Sling Blue or Sling Orange & Blue to add ABC, but that’s not available in the Oklahoma City market and isn’t scheduled to show any Thunder games this season.\n\nAs a Sling TV subscriber, you won’t be able to watch regional Thunder broadcasts since the provider doesn’t carry Bally Sports Oklahoma. However, with a subscription to Bally Sports Plus, you can supplement your Sling TV plan with regional coverage and still pay a similar price to what you’d pay for other sports streaming services.\n\nIf you want to be sure you catch as much OKC basketball as possible, then DIRECTV STREAM is a great option. This is the only streaming service that offers ABC, ESPN, TNT, NBA TV and Bally Sports Oklahoma — the key channels you’ll need to watch Thunder broadcasts this year.\n\nTo access these networks, you’ll need to upgrade to the Choice plan, which comes with 105+ channels per month (including Bally Sports Oklahoma if you live in the OKC TV market). This is one of the best sports streaming packages available, featuring not only the essential NBA channels but also live sports staples like ACCN, ESPNU, NFL Network, Fox Sports 1 (FS1) and SEC Network. All DIRECTV STREAM plans also include unlimited cloud DVR storage, so you can record Thunder games and watch them on your own time.\n\nIf you live outside the Thunder market, you’re not out of luck. In that case, you can add NBA League Pass to your plan to tune into out-of-market broadcasts for the Thunder and every other team outside your local area.\n\nHow to watch the Oklahoma City Thunder on Fubo\n\nFor Thunder fans, Fubo may not be as comprehensive as DIRECTV STREAM, but it’s a close runner-up. As a subscriber in the Oklahoma City TV market, all Fubo plans will include ABC, ESPN and Bally Sports Oklahoma, with the option to add NBA TV for an additional monthly fee. Plus, all Fubo plans come with unlimited cloud DVR storage. The only downside is that Fubo doesn’t include TNT, so you’ll miss the handful of Thunder games that air on that network.\n\nNonetheless, Fubo’s Pro plan is one of the best sports-focused options available. With more than 170 channels, including heavy hitters like ESPN2, FS1, Big Ten Network, NFL Network and beIN Sports, OKC fans will find nearly every one of their team’s games, plus a whole lot more to enjoy here.\n\nLike DIRECTV STREAM, Fubo also offers NBA League Pass for out-of-market OKC fans. This add-on costs $14.99 per month and ensures you can catch every regional broadcast from outside the Thunder TV market.\n\nHow to watch the Oklahoma City Thunder on Hulu + Live TV\n\nCompared to DIRECTV STREAM or Fubo, Hulu + Live TV doesn’t offer quite as much live sports content, but it’s still a solid option for Thunder fans. Each plan features unlimited DVR storage and more than 95 channels, including ABC, ESPN and TNT, not to mention other major sports networks like ESPN2, Big Ten Network, CBS Sports Network, NFL Network and FS1.\n\nBut Hulu + Live TV has a unique advantage over its competitors: It includes access to ESPN Plus content, along with massive on-demand libraries on Hulu and Disney Plus. The service offers serious value for cord-cutters who are looking for a mix of live and on-demand sports, entertainment, news and more.\n\nHowever, if you’re a Thunder fan, you may be disappointed with the limited coverage available for the team. Hulu + Live TV doesn’t offer NBA TV, Bally Sports Oklahoma or NBA League Pass, so you’ll only be able to catch a few nationally televised games here.\n\nIf you still want to enjoy Hulu’s excellent mix of content without missing out on Thunder games, consider a subscription to Bally Sports Plus. If you live in the OKC market, you can pay $19.99 a month to watch almost every regional broadcast (except for the Friday night games on local stations).\n\nHow to watch the Oklahoma City Thunder on YouTube TV\n\nYouTube TV offers every national Thunder broadcast, along with a mix of more live sports, news and entertainment. Plans include unlimited DVR and more than 100 live TV channels, including ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV. With YouTube TV, you’ll also get plenty of other sports content on networks like ESPN2, FS1, NFL Network, ACC Network and ESPNU. Unfortunately, though, YouTube TV doesn’t offer Bally Sports Oklahoma in its base plan or as an add-on.\n\nWith that said, if you’re outside of the Thunder TV market, you can watch every OKC basketball game on YouTube TV with NBA League Pass. These plans cost $14.99 per month and give you access to every single regional broadcast outside your area.\n\nHow to watch Oklahoma City Thunder out-of-market games with NBA League Pass\n\nOutside the Oklahoma City TV market, no live TV streaming services offer Bally Sports Oklahoma. However, if you don’t live within this market, you can sign up for NBA League Pass to watch every single Thunder game that’s not airing on national TV during the 2023-24 season.\n\nNBA League Pass plans start at $89.99 per season (for a Thunder-only subscription) or $99.99 per season (for access to all teams). You can sign up on the NBA’s website or add this package to your DIRECTV STREAM, Fubo or YouTube TV subscription, as well as some other cable providers or streaming partners like Amazon or Roku.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat streaming service has OKC Thunder games?\n\nMost live TV streaming services (including Sling TV, Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV) show Oklahoma City Thunder games. However, if you want to watch as many games as possible, DIRECTV STREAM is your best option.\n\nCan I watch NBA games on YouTube?\n\nNo, you can’t watch live NBA games on YouTube, but you can watch NBA basketball with a YouTube TV subscription. Its base plan costs $72.99 per month and includes key channels like ABC, ESPN, NBA TV and TNT.\n\nHow can I watch Bally Sports in Oklahoma?\n\nIf you live in the OKC Thunder TV market, you can stream Bally Sports Oklahoma with Fubo or DIRECTV STREAM, starting at $79.99 per month and $108.99 per month, respectively. Otherwise, you can sign up for a standalone Bally Sports Plus subscription ($19.99 per month) through the Bally Sports website."
