        "text": "CHICAGO — Veteran center Nazr Mohammed says he is staying with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nMohammed announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he will re-sign with his hometown team, saying it was \"an easy decision\" and he was looking forward to \"going to battle with a group of guys who never made excuses and just tried to find a way to win.\"\n\nSeveral media outlets also reported that the Bulls have agreed to a two-year deal with Mike Dunleavy Jr. as they try to boost their shooting. Dunleavy, an 11-year veteran, spent the past two years with Milwaukee and averaged 10.5 points while shooting 42.8 percent on 3-pointers.\n\nThe Bulls also drafted New Mexico's Tony Snell and Florida's Erik Murphy to boost their perimeter game."
