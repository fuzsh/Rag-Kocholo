        "text": "Last year, Nazr Mohammed officially retired from the NBA after an 18-year career. Now, he’s going back…to the front office.\n\nThis afternoon, Nazr announced he has accepted a role as a scout for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He explained his decision to come out of retirement in a post for The Players’ Tribune.\n\n“My experience playing this game has given me a perspective that I think can help build a successful team. Talent is crucial to winning championships, but maybe even more important is establishing a culture that values character and a strong work ethic. I believe you can find all those qualities in one individual, you just have to know what to look for. I’ve been in a championship locker rooms at the collegiate (1996 and 1998 NCAA Champion at Kentucky) and the professional level (2005 NBA champion with the Spurs) so I know what it looks and feels like. I’m really proud of these accomplishments, and now I’m just looking forward to channeling those experiences into this new challenge.”\n\nAs you can see in the picture above, Nazr was at the Kentucky/Harvard game on Saturday. In addition to checking in on his alma mater, was he also checking out some future pros?\n\n[Nazr Mohammed: I’m Back (Again)]\n\n[mobile_ad]"
