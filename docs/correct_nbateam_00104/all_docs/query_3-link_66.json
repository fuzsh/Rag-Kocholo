        "text": "CHICAGO (AP) â€” The father of Philadelphia 76ers player Nazr Mohammed has been found murdered in his auto parts business, Chicago police said. <br><br>Alhaji Mohammed, 55, of the Chicago suburb of Country\n\nBy: News On 6\n\nCHICAGO (AP) â€” The father of Philadelphia 76ers player Nazr Mohammed has been found murdered in his auto parts business, Chicago police said.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed, 55, of the Chicago suburb of Country Club Hills, was found dead Monday night in the store he owned on Chicago's South Side, Sgt. Bernard Ryan said.\n\nAccording to police, he died of apparent blunt force trauma. The Cook County medical examiner's office ruled the death a homicide. Detectives said they did not have any suspects in the killing.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed's son, Nazr, played for Kentucky for three years and was a member of the 1996 NCAA Championship team before leaving school early to enter the NBA draft.\n\nNazr Mohammed, 22, said he was at an airport outside Cincinnati on Monday when his brother called with the news.\n\n``I immediately came to Chicago,'' Mohammed said. ``This is a real bad time for my family right now. We are at a loss for words.''\n\nOn July 16, Nazr Mohammed and Antoine Walker, who play for the Boston Celtics, were victims of an armed robbery in Chicago. They said they were robbed of $3,000 cash, a $55,000 watch and other jewelry.\n\nNazr Mohammed and Walker were sitting in a vehicle with three friends at 4:15 a.m. that morning, waiting for a South Side restaurant to open when three men approached and demanded cash and their valuables, Chicago Police Officer Joseph Bourgoyne said.\n\nBoth Walker and Mohammed are Chicago natives."
