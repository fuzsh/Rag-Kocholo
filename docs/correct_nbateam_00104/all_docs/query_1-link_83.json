        "text": "Nazr Mohammed has signed a one-year extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder, reports Darnell Mayberry of The Oklahoman. Mohammed would have become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 if he didn't reach an agreement with the Thunder, who traded for the center in February, shipping out young big man prospect D.J. White.\n\nMohammed soon turns 34, and has been an effective defender and rebounder throughout his 12-season career. By locking up Mohammed for the 2011-12 season -- should the season actually occur -- Oklahoma City's frontcourt would seem to be set. Serge Ibaka is under his rookie scale contract for two more seasons, and this season the Thunder extended Nick Collison through the 2014-15 season and traded for Kendrick Perkins, who the team then extended through that same year. That's a solid four-player big man rotation for Scott Brooks to work with.\n\nUp next for the Thunder: locking up Russell Westbrook, who will enter the final season of his rookie deal but (under the current system) is eligible for an early extension this July. That can't be handled until the league begins the next official season -- which a lockout would delay -- but remains a note of great interest for those wondering how close to all in the team will go with the point guard."
