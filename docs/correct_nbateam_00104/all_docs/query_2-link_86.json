        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks head north to face the Oklahoma City Thunder Tuesday night, kicking off their round two series of the NBA Playoffs. Dallas polished off the Los Angeles Clippers a few days ago, winning that series 4-2. The Thunder, meanwhile, have had over a week to gameplan and consider their upcoming opponent after throttling the New Orleans Pelicans in a 4-0 sweep. Let’s get to the key things:\n\nWHO: Dallas Mavericks at Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nWHAT: Playoffs? Are you kidding me?!\n\nWHERE: Paycom Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\nWHEN: 8:30 p.m. CST\n\nHOW: TNT or Max (formerly HBO Max)\n\nThe Mavericks have the injury report you’d expect. Maxi Kleber is out with his shoulder injury suffered in game six against the Clippers. Olivier Maxence Prosper is also out still with his ankle injury. Luka Doncic is on the injury report now with his sprained knee, but he’s listed as probable. The Thunder don’t have any injuries listed on the report.\n\nWe’ve had some preview work on this series. After the game one preview and betting post, there’s this longer look at positional matchups that’s a pretty great primer on the series. There’s also this really good argument on Dereck Lively being the key to the series. Josh and I did a recording last night on what we expect from the series as well\n\nI don’t know if the Mavericks are going to win this series. But I’d REALLY like them to win game one. They are 0-4 in game ones during head coach Jason Kidd’s tenure. They’ve also won most of the series they’ve played! Which is impressive! I just want them to win game one though, surprise me, change the series.\n\nWe’ll be back after the game with the usual stuff. Thanks so much for hanging out. Go Mavs!"
