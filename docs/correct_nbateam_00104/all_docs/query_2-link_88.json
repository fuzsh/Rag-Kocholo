        "text": "The top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder rallied on the road to even their series 2-2 against the Dallas Mavericks in their second-round playoff matchup.\n\nThe Mavs handed the Thunder their first two losses of the 2024 playoffs in Games 2 and 3 before OKC staged a fourth-quarter rally on Monday to pull out a 100-96 victory.\n\nThe series has been dominated by how the games will be officiated. Free throws decided Game 4. It was just the fifth playoff game in NBA history in which one team shot 55% or worse at the line while the other shot 95% or better. But here's the rub: this was the first time in NBA history in which both of those teams attempted at least 20 free-throws.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander has stepped up when his team needs him most. He scored or assisted on 18 of OKC's final 22 points over the final six minutes in Game 4. He also added eight rebounds and five assists. Chet Holmgren added 18 of his own along with nine rebounds and four blocks."
