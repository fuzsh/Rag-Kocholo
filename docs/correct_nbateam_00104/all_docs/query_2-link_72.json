        "text": "As the Oklahoma City Thunder embark on a pair of summer league circuits, important developmental opportunities are presented to young players the organization is investing in.\n\nDuring a three-day event in Salt Lake City this week, Oklahoma City played in a trio of contests as a preliminary event to the larger NBA Summer League in Las Vegas later this week.\n\nWhile most of the players on the Thunder’s summer league roster won’t ever see the court at the NBA level in Oklahoma City, there are a few key pieces that have a real shot at breaking into the rotation in the next year or two.\n\nResults\n\nIn the Thunder’s opening contest of the event, the team was blown out by the Philadelphia 76ers as Oklahoma City couldn’t find ways to get stops on the defensive end. It was a slow start to the summer for the Thunder, but from there, things took a turn for the best. In the final two contests, OKC beat the Utah Jazz by 23 points then edged past the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday to finish 2-1 in Salt Lake City.\n\nTop Performers\n\nAjay Mitchell\n\nStats: 3 GP | 15.3 PPG | 5.0APG | 3.3RPG | 64.3% FG | 33.3% 3PT\n\nThe No. 38 overall pick in last month’s draft, Mitchell has been one of the most impressive incoming rookies of any summer league event thus far. What’s been most unique about his play thus far is the variety of ways he’s been able to plug himself into the offense.\n\nA combo guard with the ability to play in either backcourt spot, Mitchell notched a 10-assist game on Tuesday, followed by a 21-point outing on Wednesday. Depending on whether his team needs scoring or facilitation, Mitchell is able to adapt his game.\n\nOusmane Dieng\n\nStats: 3 GP | 15.7 PPG | 6.0 APG | 5.0 RPG | 34.6% FG | 40.0% 3PT\n\nThe clear headliner of the Thunder’s summer league roster, Dieng is the most experienced of the group but also the youngest at 21 years old. If Dieng can make a developmental leap this summer, he has every opportunity to be in the Thunder’s rotation next season.\n\nEven then, his performance in Salt Lake City was very inconsistent on both ends of the floor. He hasn’t found a way to use his positional size and skillset to his advantage, often looking outmatched physically and lacking aggressiveness. The 3-point shot was falling for Dieng during his Salt Lake City campaign, but he really struggled when it came to finishing at the rim and just inside the arc.\n\nDillon Jones\n\nStats: 3 GP | 12.3 PPG | 7.7 RPG | 5.3 APG | 43.3% FG | 35.7% 3PT\n\nThe only first-round pick on the Thunder’s roster who took the floor from this recent draft was Jones, and he made the most of his opportunity. Showcasing his ability to clean the glass and dish the rock, the incoming rookie looked ahead of his peers from a processing and production standpoint in all three of these contests.\n\nWhile he doesn’t necessarily need to be a scorer at the next level, Jones proved once again he has the ability to do so when needed. In fact, on Tuesday against the Jazz he scored an efficient 21 points on just eight shots attempts and was the best player on the floor all night.\n\nAdam Flagler\n\nStats: 3 GP | 12.3 PPG | 3.3 RPG | 1.7 APG | 36.8% FG | 29.6% 3PT\n\nAfter a phenomenal opening game in which he knocked down six 3-pointers, Flagler went just 2-of-13 from beyond the arc in the final two games. His ability to knock down big shots is abundantly clear, but the former NCAA Champion did struggle for a good portion of his time in Salt Lake City.\n\nCurrently on a two-way deal with the Thunder for the upcoming season, he has much work to do if he wants to earn NBA minutes. Flagler has the characteristics of a solid backup guard in the league, but has little room for error due to his lack of size.\n\nKeyontae Johnson\n\nStats: 2 GP | 9.5 PPG | 5.0 RPG | 1.0 SPG | 40.0% FG | 84.6% FT\n\nA second-round pick by the Thunder last summer, Johnson’s future with the team is one of the big storylines of the summer now that his two-way contract has come to an end. He has much to play for in summer league, but did look solid in Salt Lake City.\n\nJohnson has tremendous athleticism and a skillset that has value in the NBA. The 24-year-old struggled some shooting the ball in his two summer league games thus far, but did a great job attacking the rim and getting to the free throw line.\n\nOther Themes"
