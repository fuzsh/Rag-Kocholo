        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nGritty and hard-working in the paint. Takes high-percentage shots and uses his long arms and good effort to pile up rebounds. Will score consistently inside if given the chance. Is a little short for a center and not a top shot-blocker. A somewhat inconsistent performer who's often best in spurts. Doesn't hit his free throws regularly enough, or pass the ball enough."
