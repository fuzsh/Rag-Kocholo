        "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder will return to Wichita, Kan. and Tulsa, Okla. during the 2014 preseason, the team announced today. The Thunder will host the Toronto Raptors at the INTRUST Bank Arena in Wichita on Oct. 17 at 7:00 pm followed by a contest versus the Minnesota Timberwolves at the BOK Center in Tulsa on Oct. 19 at 6:00 pm.\n\n\"We are excited to be bringing Thunder Basketball back to Wichita and Tulsa, where we have sold out our games in both cities for two straight years,” said Brian Byrnes, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing for the Thunder. “We continue to be overwhelmed and humbled by the tremendous loyalty of our fans throughout Oklahoma and neighboring states. They watch our games on TV, buy Thunder merchandise and strongly support the team. This tradition of bringing games to Tulsa and Wichita is a way for us to continue to connect to and thank our fans in those communities. It serves as a reminder for us about the impact our team has even beyond our local community.\"\n\nThis marks the Thunder’s third consecutive preseason appearance in Wichita and the sixth time the team has visited Tulsa during the exhibition season.\n\nTickets for both preseason games will go on sale on a to-be-determined date in mid-April.\n\nThe Thunder will announce its entire 2014 preseason schedule at a later date."
