        "text": "Rocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nThe Chicago Bulls added some depth to their frontcourt with the re-signing of center Nazr Mohammed.\n\nThe move was announced on the team's official Twitter account Monday:\n\nMohammed has played for eight different teams over his 16-year career, proving to be a quality defender and consistent rebounder in the low post. The 37-year-old veteran spent the past two seasons with Chicago, averaging 2.0 points and 2.6 rebounds in 8.8 minutes per game.\n\nWhile the 6'10\" player does not always get a lot of playing time, he did average 11.2 rebounds per 36 minutes last season, proving he can be productive when he gets a chance.\n\nESPN's Jon Greenberg provides a look at what Mohammed provides the franchise:\n\nThe LeBron James reference comes from arguably the center's most memorable moment with the Bulls during the 2013 playoffs:\n\nAlthough picking up a technical foul is rarely a highlight, it shows Mohammed's nature as a hard-nosed player who makes things difficult for opponents.\n\nMeanwhile, this is a chance for the Chicago native to remain close to home for his 17th year in the league. Late last season, he spoke about how important basketball is where he grew up.\n\n\"It's a way of life,\" Mohammed told CSN Chicago. \"Growing up here, you had to learn how to play basketball. It was just something that was a badge of honor. Everybody in my neighborhood played. We got playground legends. It's just the way it is.\"\n\nThe Bulls already have one of the better frontcourts in the NBA with Joakim Noah, Pau Gasol and Taj Gibson, but Mohammed should be able to provide quality minutes off the bench while keeping the regulars as fresh as possible throughout the season.\n\nWith Chicago hoping to contend for an NBA title, this type of move could end up making the difference. At the very least, it will make things easier for the rest of the squad while causing problems for opponents throughout the year."
