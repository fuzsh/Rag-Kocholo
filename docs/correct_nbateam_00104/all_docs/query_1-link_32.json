        "text": "Both Mohammed and Thunder management had expressed their desire to get a new deal done. “We are pleased to be able to keep Nazr in the Thunder family,” Thunder general manager Sam Presti said in statement announcing the deal. “He is a valuable part of our organization both on and off the floor. His professionalism, experience, and on-court play have had a positive impact on our young and evolving roster.”\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder has agreed to a contract extension with center Nazr Mohammed, effectively keeping the 13-year veteran from becoming an unrestricted free agent on Friday. Terms of the deal, which could be announced as early as Tuesday, were not immediately known. But the extension is for one year. As a player with 10-plus years of NBA service, Mohammed’s is entitled to a minimum contract of $1,399,507. Mohammed earned $6,883,800 this season."
