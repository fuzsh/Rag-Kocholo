        "text": "Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt seems like the Chicago Bulls are on the verge of completing a deal that will bring veteran player Nazr Mohammed to the Windy City.\n\nNick Friedell of ESPN Chicago reported that:\n\nA league source confirmed late Saturday night that the Bulls are on the verge of signing veteran center Nazr Mohammed.\n\nWhile the deal hasn't become official yet, the New York Post reported early Sunday that Mohammed has decided to sign with the Bulls over the Brooklyn Nets and both teams have been notified about the decision.\n\nIt seems like it is only a matter of time before the deal becomes official, so what exactly will Nazr Mohammed be able to bring to the Chicago Bulls?\n\nYes, the argument is there that he will be able to bring leadership and a veteran presence to the team—but how important is that?\n\nHe played last season for the Oklahoma City Thunder, who basically did just as well as the Chicago Bulls did. Neither of them won the NBA title, and realistically, that is all that matters.\n\nYears ago, Mohammed played for San Antonio and had the best seasons of his career there. Bulls fans, however, should not start thinking that he will be able to regain the same form he showed with the Spurs. It is just not going to happen.\n\nThe only kind of experience and presence that Mohammed will be able to bring will be shown on the sidelines and in the dressing room.\n\nSure, he was able to pick up lots of experience during that time in San Antonio—which included an NBA championship—but it does not seem like he has been able to use it since them.\n\nAll he will be is a voice in the locker room who the Bulls are paying to talk.\n\nThat experience will never be shown on-court, as his play has degraded since his time with the Spurs. He is a veteran now, but not the same type of veteran presence that Ray Allen will be able to provide the Heat with. Allen can still play ball, whereas Mohammed is little more than a cheap alternative for one year until something else can be found.\n\nYou can expect him to play just over double digits in minutes per game if you go by how much he was playing last season with the Thunder.\n\nThe key element of the Mohammed signing is that he comes cheap—cheaper than Omer Asik would have been had the Bulls matched the offer sheet he signed with the Houston Rockets.\n\nMohammed is way past his prime and will not provide much, if anything, for the Bulls on the court. He may be able to pitch in with a big offensive board or a few points down low, but it all comes with a liability.\n\nMohammed is not a good defender, and will be undersized down low in his expected matchups. Yes, he can get a steal or a block here or there, but his defense will not help the Bulls.\n\nIt seems the team's money could be better spent on a player that has some skill and something to bring to the basketball court, not just the locker room. The Bulls are tight for cash, and it would make more sense to spend money for one year on someone who can help with their other needs.\n\nIn the end, the only skill that Mohammed brings to the Bulls, should he sign with them, is the ability to bring down rebounds, something that the Bulls do not need. His skill only waters down the Bulls, rather than adds to the team's needs, like depth scoring and a backup for Derrick Rose should he not return for a while.\n\nFor a team that led the NBA last year in rebounds per game, it seems that they are adding to a category they already excel in.\n\nAlthough Nazr Mohammed can be considered a good bench player who will add big-man depth to a contending team, it is not the kind of depth that the Bulls need. True, they need someone to fill in the space left by Asik, but no one should expect Mohammed to be able to make any difference to this Bulls roster or to make them a better team.\n\nFirst and foremost, he is no Asik.\n\nHe fills a space and will provide what he can when asked, but he will not make any difference to the Bulls' 2012-13 season."
