        "text": "On February 24th, 2011, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded forward D.J. White and guard Morris Peterson to the Charlotte Bobcats for center Nazr Mohammed.\n\nWhen we think of championship contenders in the early-2010s, we think of teams having size, toughness and rebounding. The Oklahoma City Thunder were a team on the rise featuring a young core of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Jeff Green, Serge Ibaka, and James Harden. Following a promising 50-32 run during the 2009-10 season, the Thunder ran into a juggernaut in the Los Angeles Lakers that featured a superior frontcourt featuring Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, and Ron Artest.\n\nThe Thunder felt that competing in the West required bolstering their frontcourt situation, and that led to them making two important acquisitions. First, they acquired center Kendrick Perkins in a multi-player deal, and then they traded for center Nazr Mohammed in a deal with the struggling Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nMohammed was originally acquired by the Bobcats after a failed attempt by the Detroit Pistons to replace center Ben Wallace led to Mohammed’s departure. He was signed to a five-year, $30 million deal in 2006 after Wallace left the Pistons to sign with the Chicago Bulls. Mohammed was traded only a season and a half after the contract was signed.\n\nMohammed received playing time as a fill-in starter and reserve center immediately upon his arrival in Charlotte. In his first time with Charlotte, Mohammed played in 61 games (29 starts) and contributed 9.3 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 0.9 BPG in 23.3 MPG. The Bobcats finished with their third 50-plus loss season in the first four seasons of the franchise’s existence.\n\nIn response to the disappointing ‘07-'08 season, the Bobcats hired coach Larry Brown to replace previous coach Sam Vincent. That coaching change did not benefit Mohammed. Brown kept Mohammed on the bench for much of the season. The University of Kentucky product only appeared in 39 games and produced a minuscule 2.7 PPG and 2.0 RPG in 8.7 MPG. A big part in Mohammed falling out of the rotation was the acquisition of center DeSagana Diop in a trade with the Dallas Mavericks. Mohammed played in only eight of the team’s last 41 games and expressed frustration with his lack of playing time and requested a trade. The Bobcats finished the season with a 35-47 record leaving them out of postseason play once again.\n\nThe Bobcats made a big franchise-altering move when they dealt inaugural draft pick Emeka Okafor to the New Orleans Hornets for center Tyson Chandler. Mohammed found his way into the Bobcats rotation for much of the 2009-10 season. He played in 58 games (missed 24 games with a nerve injury in his back) and made 29 starts. Mohammed averaged 7.9 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 0.7 BPG in 17.0 MPG. The Bobcats initially struggled with a 10-16 start during the 2009-10 season, but the team rebounded under a number one ranked defense in the NBA to finished with a franchise-best 44-38 record.\n\nCharlotte entered the postseason as the seventh seed facing the second-seeded Orlando Magic in the first round. Mohammed was featured in a three-man rotation at the center position during the series with Chandler and midseason acquisition Theo Ratliff. All three big men accrued fouls while trying to contain star Dwight Howard. The 'Cats managed to hold Howard to meager numbers of 9.8 PPG on 48.1% from the field. That still didn’t matter as Orlando swept Charlotte in a closer than expected series.\n\nMohammed was thrust into the starting center role for the beginning of the 2010-11 season after the offseason trade that sent Chandler to Dallas in a four-player deal. The Bobcats struggled at the start of the 2010-11 season with a disappointing 9-19 start before coach Brown resigned and Paul Silas took over on an interim basis. They were 25-32 when they made the decision to rebuild by trading the only All-Star in franchise history Gerald Wallace in a separate trade. Mohammed was next to go with his expiring contract being sent to OKC. Amid all the chaos in Charlotte, Mohammed participated in 51 games (30 starts) and produced 7.3 PPG, 4.9 RPG and 0.9 BPG in 16.7 MPG before the trade occurred. Mohammed’s averages in Charlotte were 7.2 PPG, 5.1 RPG and 0.8 BPG in 209 games. He shot 51% from the field and 61% from the free-throw line in that time.\n\nD.J. White was drafted in the first round of the 2008 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons and was traded on draft night for second rounders Walter Sharpe and Trent Plaisted. White’s rookie season with the Thunder was very brief. He missed all but seven games due to two surgeries to remove a benign growth in his jaw. The Thunder fired coach P.J. Carleismo and replaced him with Scotty Brooks after a 1-12 start. The Thunder finished 23-59 that season.\n\nWhite’s sophomore year was a struggle as well. He played in only 12 games due to surgery on a fractured right thumb. The Thunder experienced their first playoff run during the 2009-10 season, when they won 50 games. The inexperienced Thunder challenged the Lakers, but came up short in a 4-2 series loss.\n\nMorris Peterson was acquired by the Oklahoma City Thunder from the New Orleans Hornets on the day of the 2010 NBA draft along with rookie Cole Aldrich for rookies Quincy Pondexter and Craig Brackins. Peterson only played four games for OKC averaging 1.0 PPG before the trade. White saw limited action in 23 games for the Thunder in his third season before the midseason deal. In just 9.5 MPG, White managed 2.8 PPG and 2.3 RPG before the deal. White played in 42 career games for OKC with numbers of 4.4 PPG and 2.5 RPG in 10.7 MPG, while shooting 52% from the field and 73% from the charity stripe.\n\nNazr Mohammed received quality playing time with the Thunder after the trade. He played in 24 games (7 starts) and averaged 17.9 MPG, 6.9 PPG, 4.8 RPG and 0.7 SPG as the Thunder completed their 2010-11 campaign with a 55-27 record. In the postseason, Mohammed continued his role as a backup center as the Thunder defeated the Denver Nuggets 4-1 in the first round of the 2011 playoffs. Mohammed played in every game for the Thunder when they managed to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies in the semifinals 4-3 despite facing a 2-1 deficit. The Thunder’s playoff run ended in the Conference Finals when they lost to the eventual NBA champion Dallas Mavericks in five games. Mohammed and the Thunder agreed to a one-year contract extension worth about $3.75 million prior to the 2011 NBA lockout.\n\nIn Mohammed’s first full season with the Thunder, he participated in 63 games (1 start) and managed 2.7 PPG and 2.2 RPG in 11.0 MPG. The Thunder finished with the second best record in the Western Conference with a 47-19 record. The Thunder managed to advance all the way to the NBA Finals after sweeping Dallas in the first round, defeating the Lakers 4-1 in the Semis, and coming back from a 2-0 deficit to defeat the San Antonio Spurs. OKC faced the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals, but failed to win a game after Game One and lost the series 4-1.\n\nMohammed became a free agent after the season and signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Bulls for the veteran’s minimum. In 87 career games with OKC, Mohammed averaged 3.9 PPG and 3.3 RPG on 51% from the field and 60% from the free-throw line in that time frame.\n\nPeterson’s expiring contract was waived four days after the trade was completed. White received a boost in playing time upon his arrival in Charlotte. He played in 24 games and produced 8.5 PPG, 4.4 RPG and 0.6 APG in 19.4 MPG for a Bobcats team that finished 34-48.\n\nDuring the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, White continued his role as a backup forward for Charlotte. He participated in 58 games (11 starts) and produced 6.8 PPG, 3.6 RPG and 0.8 APG in 18.9 MPG. The Bobcats struggled mightily throughout the '11-'12 season. They finished with the worst record in NBA history at 7-59 (10.6 winning percentage). White signed with the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association in the 2012 offseason. He departed Charlotte with averages of 7.3 PPG, 3.8 RPG and 0.8 APG in 82 games with the Bobcats. The Indiana product shot 50% on FGs and 73% on FTs in that time.\n\nD.J. White after return to OKC as member of Bobcats (via The Oklahoman):\n\n“As much as I loved it here, I wanted to play. I know it’s a business. Nine times out of 10, I wasn’t going to be here for forever anyway. I love the guys here, but I have to do what’s best for me.”\n\nNazr Mohammed Q&A (via The Oklahoman):\n\nThe Oklahoman: Before you joined the Thunder, what did you think of the franchise?\n\nNazr Mohammed: “Honestly, I had heard great things about the organization from guys who had been here. (Former Thunder guard) Kevin Ollie is pretty cool, and he was telling me great things about the coaching staff and the organization.”\n\nTO: And now that you’ve been with the team?\n\nNM: \"I’m extremely happy. You’ve got 22-year-old guys who are more professional than guys who have been in the league seven, eight, nine years. These guys have a focus to detail. KD (Kevin Durant) is amazing. He goes hard every drill, every practice. He’s 22 years old. Even when it’s a light day, he’s going hard. He’s a special guy, a special player.“\n\nTO: You were busy playing in Charlotte, so obviously you didn’t have much of a chance to see the Thunder since it arrived in OKC.\n\nNM: \"You saw them twice a year and you wanted to beat them when you played, but you weren’t battling them for a playoff position or anything so I didn’t really watch many games. Of course, everyone knew Kevin and Russ (Westbrook) were up-and-coming players.”\n\nMohammed on relationship with VP and GM Sam Presti (via The Oklahoman):\n\n“Oh, that’s a huge reason why I’m here. No question. We just had a good relationship and that translated to me coming here.”\n\nOklahoma City Thunder executive vice president and general manager Sam Presti (via Thunder.com):\n\n“We would like to thank both D.J. and Morris for their many contributions here in Oklahoma City on and off the court. For the past three seasons, D.J. has been the ultimate teammate and one of our hardest workers. Morris has been a consummate professional and I wish them both success. Nazr will bring veteran leadership and playoff experience to our roster and we are excited for him to join our team in Oklahoma City.”\n\nOn Mohammed’s diligence in preparation and professionalism (via The Oklahoman):"
