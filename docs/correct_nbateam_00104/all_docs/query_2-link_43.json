        "text": "I like to watch the videos and read the articles to stay caught up with all thatâs going on with the team. They even include some content thatâs also distributed in the NBA app but if you watch it here there are shorter ads!! I like the new feature of choosing from a wide selection of app icons, though strangely it doesnât change my Watch app icon. Regardless itâs still overall a great app!!\n\nPrior to the update, season ticket holders could see a list of what similar tickets sold for and a list of what others were selling for. Now, it only lists the face value and the average of similar tickets are going for (which is generally a decent range). Itâs made it much more difficult to know if Iâm asking too much or not enough for tickets when I want to sell my tickets. Taking away that feature from the app has made selling tickets a guessing game. If the list of sold tickets would come back, it would be tremendously helpful for season ticket holders."
