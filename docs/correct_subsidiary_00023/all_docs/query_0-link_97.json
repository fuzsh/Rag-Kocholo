        "text": "Moving to the U.S. with my family at a young age, I had to learn a different dialect of Chinese to watch the two hours of Chinese language television that were available at the time. Now, of course, there is a vast universe of foreign-language media in this country â a great example of how supply scales to meet demand.\n\nThatâs been a core theme of my career: helping companies scale through hypergrowth. At Vontu (acquired by Symantec), Box, and Twitch, I joined companies at the point where employees knew each othersâ names and went on to grow 10 times or more in a couple of years. I learned quickly that scaling anything â a product, a team, a culture, a company â is more successful when you approach it with a growth mindset. This is accomplished through scaling and then iterating on a playbook that consists of identifying core competence, articulating competitive strength, building collaborations and establishing standardized processes across every constituency when it makes sense.\n\nI met the team at GC while I was leading products for international markets for Twitch. Before that point, I hadnât really thought of venture capital as a career option. When I learned that one of GCâs core tenets is directly supporting the growth of its portfolio companies, it became obvious that this is a place in which I could be a force multiplier. Thatâs an exciting opportunity for someone who thrives on fast growth, diverse people, and brilliant ideas.\n\nMy joys outside the office are my family, listening to great books, and traveling. Iâm also a certified yoga instructor and serve on the Education Committee of the San Francisco Symphony, which brings equitable access to music education throughout the greater San Francisco Bay Area."
