        "text": "We’re very excited to welcome Joseph Ansanelli to Greylock, as a General Partner in our Silicon Valley office. Joseph is joining our enterprise team and will be focused on investing in security, emerging mobile applications, and solutions for the enterprise. As his Linkedin bio succinctly says, Joseph is an entrepreneur. It best describes why we found ourselves wanting to work with Joseph — he’s founded multiple successful companies, he’s advised and seeded multiple successful companies, and proven his skill at advising young start-ups thru growth phases to successful operating entities. More importantly to us, Joseph is a great match for our culture — high integrity, intelligent, practical, and a company builder.\n\nJoseph has started three companies that have successfully been acquired. Most recently, Joseph co-founded and served as CEO of Vontu, which defined a new security category, data loss prevention, and quickly became the market leader. In 2007, after an exciting run as an independent company, Symmantec acquired Vontu for $350 million and Joseph became an executive of Symantec. Prior to Vontu, Joseph co-founded and was CEO of Connectify, an enterprise software marketing platform. Connectify was acquired by Kana, which subsequently went public in 1999. His first company, Trio Development, was acquired by Apple, which he co-founded while still in college at Penn.\n\nSince leaving Symantec, Joseph has invested in several early stage enterprise Saas, mobile, and security companies. He has taken active roles in Lookout, where he serves as Chairman, Pipewise, and Smartling and has been an advisor to Mobile Iron. Joseph has developed a reputation among entrepreneurs as not only an early stage investor but someone who works tirelessly to help entrepreneurs build great teams and companies. His work counseling entrepreneurs and helping them build companies has demonstrated to us many of the skills we see as crucial to longer term success as a partner at Greylock.\n\nJoseph is joining Greylock at an exciting time in the enterprise software market and an exciting time in our portfolio. Forces as diverse as the cloud, flash storage, big data/no SQL, mobile, and the consumerization of IT have created a landscape ripe for disruption. We already see this within our enterprise portfolio at Greylock: Imperva (IMPV) went public in 2011, Service-Now (NOW) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) have both recently completed IPOs. And we have an amazing portfolio of enterprise companies such as Workday driving innovation for enterprise applications in the Cloud, Pure Storage disrupting the storage market, and Cloudera defining the market big data and hadoop.\n\nJoseph can be reached at jansanelli [at] greylock.com, or followed on Twitter @ansanelli.\n\nWelcome Joseph! I’m looking forward to seeing your success firsthand.\n\n- David Sze"
