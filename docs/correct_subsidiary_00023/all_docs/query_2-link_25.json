        "text": "Today is a proud day for all of us at CloudKnox Security as we expanded our family with world-class company builders.\n\nWe announced $12M in a new round of funding earlier today and welcome Sorenson Ventures to our team of investors, which includes ClearSky Security, Dell Technologies Capital and Foundation Capital. We are also very pleased to welcome Stephen Ward, CISO at The Home Depot, Ken Elefant of Sorenson Ventures and Suresh Batchu, co-founder and CTO at Mobile Iron to our board of directors.\n\nI am also very thrilled that John Donnelly has joined the CloudKnox management team as VP of sales. Before joining CloudKnox, John has held several global sales leadership roles. I had the opportunity to work with John when he was the SVP of Sales at MobileIron, where he led the company’s global revenue growth and sales operations. Prior to MobileIron, he was Vice President of Sales at Symantec, which he joined when it acquired Vontu in 2007. At Vontu, John led the worldwide sales operation, and established the company as the top provider of enterprise data loss protection solutions. Over the course of his career, John has also grown several startup companies from early stage to exit via IPO or acquisition. They include Talking Blocks, Kana Communications, Connectify, and NetGravity.\n\nThe new investment, board and executive team expansion follows a very successful 2019. We experienced triple digit growth in 2019 that was fueled by rising demand from enterprise organizations looking to protect their critical cloud resources from accidental and malicious insider threats.\n\nWe are seeing this explosive growth, because there has been an exponential increase in the number and complexity of managing identities and cloud resources in hybrid- and multi-cloud environments. The number of identities accessing the cloud infrastructure has increased by 50x, driven by the increase in non-human identities needed for automation. These identities can access more than 40,000 high-risk privileges across the major cloud platforms, which can potentially impact the infrastructure adversely. Most identities only use less than 1% of the privileges that have been granted.\n\nThis has transformed identities into over-privileged superpowers with significant infrastructure risk exposure. The most effective way to address this challenge is by automatically implementing a least privilege policy framework with elevated privileges on demand based on dynamic usage.\n\nMore companies will turn to automated systems that continuously monitor and manage the privileges of all identities across hybrid and multi-clouds to counter this challenge. In fact, at AWS re:Invent last November, AWS’s CISO Stephen Schmidt said that if a customer properly implements a least privilege policy, there is relatively little an actor has access to once they are authenticated – significantly reducing the customer’s risk.\n\nThat’s precisely the solution that CloudKnox provides and we’re looking forward to even more success with the guidance of our entire team of investors, board members and executives."
