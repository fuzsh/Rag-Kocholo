        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 13, 2009 -- AppDynamics, a provider of next-generation Application Performance Management solutions, today announced that Steve Roop has joined the company as vice president of marketing. Mr. Roop brings nearly 20 years of experience in high-tech marketing to the role, and will be responsible for all facets of marketing including branding, demand generation, product marketing, competitive intelligence, marketing communications, and public relations.\n\n\"Steve comes to AppDynamics with a proven track record of driving comprehensive marketing strategies for high-growth organizations,\" said Jyoti Bansal, AppDynamics founder & CEO. \"As AppDynamics has already shipped version 1.0 of its product and attracted companies that are enthusiastic about the simple yet powerful AppDynamics solution for application management and cloud orchestration, my mission is to add the kind of depth and experience to the management team that Steve Roop represents.\"\n\n\"I'm thrilled to be joining AppDynamics as it begins to reshape the application monitoring and performance management landscape in its own image,\" Steve Roop said. \"The tools designed for application performance management are no longer applicable to today's world of distributed applications in cloud, virtual, and physical environments, and IT professionals need a solution that will simplify their lives as they continue to support and maintain application health and performance.\"\n\nPrior to joining AppDynamics, Mr. Roop was the VP of Marketing at Vontu--a startup funded and advised by venture capital firms Benchmark Capital, Venrock, and USVP--which was acquired by Symantec for $350 million in late 2007. Mr. Roop's marketing strategies enabled Vontu to become the recognized market leader, secure a dominant market share position in key vertical markets, and achieve a 70 percent win-rate in competitive selling situations.\n\nMr. Roop also held several high-level executive positions at PeopleSoft, where he was responsible for setting global marketing vision and strategy for PeopleSoft's product, industry, and service offerings. Prior to PeopleSoft, Mr. Roop was a Senior Manager at Accenture, where he led successful call center, supply chain, and ERP projects for his clients.\n\nAbout AppDynamics\n\nAppDynamics is the Application Intelligence company.
