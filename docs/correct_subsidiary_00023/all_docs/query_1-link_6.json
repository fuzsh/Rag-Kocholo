        "text": "News Release\n\nSymantec to Acquire Vontu\n\nLeading data loss prevention solution strengthens Symantec’s Security 2.0 vision of protecting information\n\nSymantec Corp. (Nasdaq: SYMC) today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Vontu, the leader in Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, for US$350 million, which will be paid in cash and assumed options. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2007, subject to receiving regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\n\nData loss prevention solutions help organisations prevent the loss of confidential or proprietary information wherever it is stored or being used. Vontu’s products will complement Symantec’s existing portfolio of endpoint and network security, storage and compliance solutions, to provide customers with the most comprehensive platform for data loss prevention on the market today. The acquisition builds on Symantec’s strong partnership with Vontu and will provide an important component of Symantec’s Security 2.0 vision, which shifts the focus of security from simply securing systems and devices to also protecting the information itself.\n\n“The combination of Symantec’s existing portfolio and Vontu’s leading products and dedicated team enables us to deliver a central component of our Security 2.0 vision to customers − information-centric security that protects both the device and the information itself,” said Tom Kendra, group president, Security and Data Management Group, Symantec. “In a business environment that is increasingly competitive, transparent and regulated, companies need confidence that their most valuable asset – information – is safe. Only then will security become more of a business enabler rather than a business inhibitor.”\n\nCompanies today are struggling to determine where their most sensitive information is stored, how it is being used, who has access to it and how to prevent it from being lost or compromised. To address the risk of data loss, organisations in every industry are adopting DLP solutions that enable them to find and protect sensitive data stored throughout the enterprise, monitor and prevent confidential data from being copied or sent outside the company and automatically enforce data protection policies.\n\n“The next wave of security is based on one simple idea – it’s about the information,” said Joseph Ansanelli, CEO, Vontu, Inc. “By joining forces with Symantec and building upon their strength in enterprise security and storage solutions, we will be uniquely positioned to help customers answer the important questions as to where their confidential information is stored, how it is being used and how best to prevent its loss.”\n\nSymantec expects this transaction to be US$0.02 dilutive to FY08 non-GAAP earnings per share and expects FY08 GAAP earnings per share to be more diluted due to purchase accounting, stock based compensation and acquisition related charges associated with the transaction.\n\nLeading Solutions that Prevent the Loss of Confidential Data Wherever it is Stored or Used\n\nVontu will bring a best-in-class DLP platform to Symantec’s already strong security and storage portfolio. Vontu’s Network and Endpoint Data Discovery and Protection solutions help organisations understand where confidential information is stored and quickly find and fix exposed data on servers, systems and endpoints. Vontu Data Monitoring and Prevention solutions stop confidential data from being sent outside the organisation through email, web or IM. They also monitor and prevent confidential data on endpoints from being copied to removable media or downloaded to local drives. Vontu also offers a centralised platform with all of its products for policy management, detection, workflow and remediation.\n\nFor more information on how Vontu will complement Symantec’s existing offerings and planned integration between the portfolios, please visit: http://www.symantec.com/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=20071105_02.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFor additional information on the Vontu acquisition please visit: http://go.symantec.com/vontu.\n\nAbout Vontu\n\nVontu is the leading provider of Data Loss Prevention solutions that combine endpoint and network-based technology to accurately detect and automatically protect confidential data wherever it is stored or used.
