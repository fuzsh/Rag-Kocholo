        "text": "A] Mobile Prevent for Web Server - Basic configuration\n\nB] Configuring the Mobile Prevent for Web Server\n\nA] Mobile Prevent for Web Server - Basic configuration :\n\nDetection servers are configured from each server's individual Configure Server screen. To display the Configure Server screen, go to the Overview screen (System > Servers > Overview) and click the name of the server in the list. That server's Server Detail screen appears. Click Configure to display the Configure Server screen.\n\nA Mobile Prevent for Web Server Configure Server screen is divided into a general section and one tab:\n\na] General section. This section specifies the server's name, host, and port.\n\nb] ICAP tab. This tab is for configuring Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) capture.\n\nUse the ICAP tab to configure Web-based network traffic. The ICAP tab is divided into the following sections:\n\nc] The Trial Mode section enables you to test prevention without blocking traffic. When trial mode is selected, the server detects incidents and creates incident reports, but it does not block any traffic. This option enables you to test your policies without blocking traffic. Check the box to enable trial mode.\n\nd] The Request Filtering section configures traffic filtering criteria:\n\nIgnore Requests Smaller Than :\n\nSpecify the minimum body size of HTTP requests to inspect on this server. The default value is 4096 bytes. HTTP requests with bodies smaller than this number are not inspected.\n\nIgnore Requests without Attachments :\n\nCheck this box to inspect only those HTTP requests that contain attachments.\n\nIgnore Requests to Hosts or Domains :\n\nEnter the host names or domains whose requests should be filtered out (ignored). Enter one host or domain name per line.\n\nIgnore Requests from User Agents :\n\nEnter the names of user agents whose requests should be filtered out (ignored). Enter one agent per line.\n\nNote: The Response Filtering section is not supported for Mobile Prevent for Web.\n\nThe Response Filtering section configures the filtering criteria to manage HTTP responses:\n\ne] The Connection section configures settings for the ICAP connection between an HTTP proxy server and the Mobile Prevent for Web Server:\n\nTCP Port :\n\nSpecify the TCP port number that this server is to use to listen to ICAP requests. The same value must be configured on the HTTP proxy sending ICAP requests to this server. The recommended value is 1344.\n\nMaximum Number of Requests :\n\nEnter the maximum number of simultaneous ICAP connections from the HTTP proxy that are allowed. The default is 25.\n\nMaximum Number of Responses :\n\nEnter the maximum number of simultaneous ICAP response connections from the HTTP proxy or proxies that are allowed. The default is 25.\n\nConnection Backlog :\n\nEnter the maximum number of waiting connections allowed. Each waiting connection means that a user waits at their browser. The minimum value is 1.\n\nf] The Mobile section configures settings for the Mobile Prevent for Web Server.\n\nMobile IP Ranges :\n\nThe range of IP addresses that your VPN Server is configured to assign to your mobile devices. The IP addresses are used to identify your mobile devices in the reporting section.\n\nIn addition to the settings available through the Configure Server screen, you can specify advanced settings for this server. To specify advanced configuration parameters, click Server Settings on the server's Overview screen. Use caution when modifying Advanced Server settings. Check with Symantec Support before you change any advanced setting.\n\nB] Configuring the Mobile Prevent for Web Server :\n\nYou can use a number of configuration options for Mobile Prevent for Web Server. For example, you can configure the server to:\n\nIgnore small HTTP/S requests or responses.\n\nIgnore requests to or responses from a particular host or domain (such as the domain of a business subsidiary).\n\nIgnore user search engine queries.\n\nTo modify your Mobile Prevent for Web Server configuration please follow the below procedures....\n\nProcedure Step 1 : Go to System > Servers > Overview and click the Mobile Prevent for Web Server.\n\nProcedure Step 2 :On the Server Detail screen that appears, click Configure.\n\nYou can verify or modify settings on the ICAP tab as described in subsequent steps. The tab is divided into several sections: Request Filtering, Response Filtering, and Connection.\n\nProcedure Step 3 :Verify or change the Trial Mode setting.\n\nProcedure Step 4 :Verify or modify the filter options for requests from HTTP clients (user agents). The options in the Request Filtering section are as follows:\n\nIgnore Requests Smaller Than :\n\nSpecifies the minimum body size of HTTP requests to inspect. (The default is 4096 bytes.) For example, search-strings typed in to search engines such as Yahoo or Google are usually short. By adjusting this value, you can exclude those searches from inspection.\n\nIgnore Requests without Attachments :\n\nCauses the server to inspect only the requests that contain attachments. This option can be useful if you are mainly concerned with requests intended to post sensitive files.\n\nIgnore Requests to Hosts or Domains :\n\nCauses the server to ignore requests to the hosts or domains you specify. This option can be useful if you expect a lot of HTTP traffic between the domains of your corporate headquarters and branch offices. You can type one or more host or domain names (for example, www.company.com), each on its own line.\n\nIgnore Requests from User Agents :\n\nCauses the server to ignore requests from user agents (HTTP clients) you specify. This option can be useful if your organization uses a program or language (such as Java) that makes frequent HTTP requests. You can type one or more user agent values (for example, java/6.0.29), each on its own line.\n\nNote: The Response Filtering options are not supported for Mobile Prevent.\n\nProcedure Step 5 : Verify or modify the filter options for responses from Web servers. The options in the Response Filtering section are as follows:\n\nIgnore Responses Smaller Than :\n\nSpecifies the minimum size of the body of HTTP responses that are inspected by this server. (Default is 4096 bytes.)\n\nInspect Content Type :\n\nSpecifies the MIME content types that Symantec Data Loss Prevention should monitor in responses. By default, this field contains content-type values for Microsoft Office, PDF, and plain text formats. To add others, type one MIME content type per line. For example, type application/wordperfect5.1 to have Symantec Data Loss Prevention analyze WordPerfect 5.1 files.\n\nNote that it is generally more efficient to specify MIME content types at the Web proxy level.\n\nIgnore Responses from Hosts or Domains :\n\nCauses the server to ignore responses from the hosts or domains you specify. You can type one or more host or domain names (for example, www.company.com), each on its own line.\n\nIgnore Responses to User Agents :\n\nCauses the server to ignore responses to user agents (HTTP clients) you specify. You can type one or more user agent values (for example, java/1.4.2_xx), each on its own line.\n\nProcedure Step 6 : Verify or modify settings for the ICAP connection between the HTTP proxy server and the Mobile Prevent for Web Server. The Connection options are as follows:\n\nTCP Port :\n\nSpecifies the TCP port number over which this server listens for ICAP requests. This number must match the value that is configured on the HTTP proxy that sends ICAP requests to this server. The recommended value is 1344.\n\nMaximum Number of Requests :\n\nSpecifies the maximum number of simultaneous ICAP request connections from the HTTP proxy or proxies. The default is 25.\n\nMaximum Number of Responses :\n\nSpecifies the maximum number of simultaneous ICAP response connections from the HTTP proxy or proxies. The default is 25.\n\nConnection Backlog :\n\nSpecifies the number of waiting connections allowed. A waiting connection is a user waiting for an HTTP response from the browser. The minimum value is 1. If the HTTP proxy gets too many requests (or responses), the proxy handles them according to your proxy configuration. You can configure the HTTP proxy to block any requests (or responses) greater than this number.\n\nProcedure Step 7 : In the Mobile IP Ranges fields, enter the range of IP addresses that your VPN server is configured to assign to mobile devices. The IP addresses are used to identify the incidents that were triggered from mobile devices as Mobile incidents.\n\nThe IP addresses you enter into this range do not dynamically affect the VPN Server. This range is only to identify your mobile devices in the administration console. You must enter the exact same range of IP addresses when you configure the VPN Server to assign the addresses.\n\nProcedure Step 8 : Click Save to exit the Configure Server screen and then click Done to exit the Server Detail screen.\n\nUse the following instructions to configure Network Prevent Server to operate either in reflecting or forwarding mode.\n\nTo configure the Network Prevent Server :\n\nProcedure Step 1 : Log on to the Enforce Server administration console for the Symantec Data Loss Prevention system you want to configure.\n\nProcedure Step 2 : Select System > Servers > Overview to display the list of configured servers.\n\nProcedure Step 3 : Click the name of the Network Prevent Server that you want to configure.\n\nProcedure Step 4 : Click Configure.\n\nProcedure Step 5 : Deselect Trial Mode to enable blocking of email messages that are found to violate Symantec Data Loss Prevention policies.\n\nProcedure Step 6 : Configure reflecting mode or forwarding mode by modifying the following fields:\n\nNext Hop Configuration :\n\nSelect Reflect to operate Network Prevent Server in reflecting mode. Select Forward to operate in forwarding mode.\n\nNote: If you select Forward you must also select Enable MX Lookup or Disable MX Lookup to configure the method used to determine the next-hop MTA.\n\nEnable MX Lookup :\n\nThis option applies only to forwarding mode configurations.\n\nSelect Enable MX Lookup to perform a DNS query on a domain name to obtain the mail exchange (MX) records for the server. Network Prevent Server uses the returned MX records to select the address of the next hop mail server.\n\nIf you select Enable MX Lookup, also add one or more domain names in the Enter Domains text box. For example:\n\ncompanyname.comNetwork Prevent Server performs MX record queries for the domain names that you specify.\n\nNote: You must include at least one valid entry in the Enter Domains text box to successfully configure forwarding mode behavior.\n\nDisable MX Lookup :\n\nThis field applies only to forwarding mode configurations.\n\nSelect Disable MX Lookup if you want to specify the exact hostname or IP address of one or more next-hop MTAs. Network Prevent Server uses the hostnames or addresses that you specify and does not perform an MX record lookup.\n\nIf you select Disable MX Lookup, also add one or more hostnames or IP addresses for next-hop MTAs in the Enter Hostnames text box. You can specify multiple entries by placing each entry on a separate line. For example:\n\nsmtp1.companyname.com\n\nsmtp2.companyname.com\n\nsmtp3.companyname.comNetwork Prevent Server always tries to proxy to the first MTA that you specify in the list. If that MTA is not available, Network Prevent Server tries the next available entry in the list.\n\nNote: You must include at least one valid entry in the Enter Hostnames text box to successfully configure forwarding mode behavior.\n\nProcedure Step 7 : Click Save.\n\nProcedure Step 8 : Click Server Settings to verify or configure these advanced settings:\n\nRequestProcessor.ServerSocketPort :\n\nEnsure that this value matches the number of the SMTP Listener port to which the upstream MTA sends email messages. The default is 10025.\n\nNote: Many Linux systems restrict ports below 1024 to root access. Network Prevent cannot bind to these restricted ports. If the computer receives mail for inspection on a restricted port (for example, port 25), reconfigure the computer to route traffic from the restricted port to the non-restricted Network Prevent port (port 10025 by default).\n\nSee Second Last Paragraph to Configuring Linux IP tables to reroute traffic from a restricted port.\n\nRequestProcessor.MTAResubmitPort :\n\nEnsure that this value matches the number of the SMTP Listener port on the upstream MTA to which the Network Prevent Server returns mail. The default is 10026.\n\nRequestProcessor.AddDefaultHeader :\n\nBy default, Network Prevent Server uses a header to identify all email messages that it has processed. The header and value are specified in the RequestProcessor.DefaultPassHeader field.\n\nChange the value of this field to false if you do not want to add a header to each message.\n\nRequestProcessor.AddDefaultPassHeader :\n\nThis field specifies the header and value that Network Prevent Server adds to each email message that it processes. The default header and value is X-CFilter-Loop: Reflected. Change the value of this field if you want to add a different header to each processed message.\n\nIf you do not want to add a header to each email message, set the AddDefaultPassHeader field to False.\n\nNote: Always configure both RequestProcessor.ServerSocketPort and RequestProcessor.MTAResubmitPort, whether you implement reflecting or forwarding mode. With forwarding mode, RequestProcessor.ServerSocketPort specifies the SMTP Listener port on the detection server to which the upstream MTA sends email messages. RequestProcessor.MTAResubmitPort is the SMTP Listener port on the downstream MTA to which the detection server sends email messages.\n\nProcedure Step 9 : Click Save.\n\nProcedure Step 10 : Click Done.\n\nProcedure Step 11 : If your email delivery system uses TLS communication in forwarding mode, each next-hop mail server in the proxy chain must support TLS and must authenticate itself to the previous hop. This means that Network Prevent Server must authenticate itself to the upstream MTA, and the next-hop MTA must authenticate itself to Network Prevent Server. Proper authentication requires that each mail server stores the public key certificate for the next hop mail server in its local keystore file.\n\nConfiguring Linux IP tables to reroute traffic from a restricted port :\n\nMany Linux systems restrict ports below 1024 to root access. Network Prevent cannot bind to these restricted ports.\n\nIf the computer receives mail for inspection on a restricted port (for example, port 25), use the iptables command to route that traffic to a non-restricted port, such as the Network Prevent default port 10025. Then ensure that Network Prevent listens on the non-restricted port to inspect email.\n\nUse the following instructions to configure a Linux system to route from port 25 to port 10025. If you use a different restricted port or Network Prevent port, enter the correct values in the iptables commands.\n\nTo configure route traffic from port 25 to port 10025 :\n\nProcedure Step A] Configure Network Prevent to use the default port 10025 if necessary.\n\nSee Configuring Network Prevent Server for reflecting or forwarding mode :\n\nProcedure Step B] In a terminal window on the Network Prevent computer, enter the following commands to reroute traffic from port 25 to port 10025:\n\niptables -N Vontu-INPUT\n\niptables -A Vontu-INPUT -s 0/0 -p tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT\n\niptables -I INPUT 1 -s 0/0 -p tcp -j Vontu-INPUT\n\niptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 25 -j REDIRECT --to-ports=10025\n\niptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables\n\nNote: If you only want to test local IP routing between the ports with Telnet, use the command: iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -o lo -p tcp --destination-port 25 -j REDIRECT --to-ports=10025\n\nIf later you decide to delete the IP tables entry, use the command:\n\niptables -t nat -D OUTPUT -o lo -p tcp --destination-port 25 -j REDIRECT --to-ports=10025\n\nFollow the below procedure steps provided here to deploy Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins.\n\nProcedure Step 1 : Obtain (or create) an Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in zip file.\n\nContact a Symantec partner or Symantec sales representative.\n\nEndpoint FlexResponse plug-ins are not available with the default Symantec Data Loss Prevention installation.\n\nProcedure Step 2 : Configure any Endpoint credentials on the Enforce Server. (Note :This step is optional)\n\nConfiguring endpoint credentials :\n\nYou must add credentials to the Credential Store before you can access credentials for Endpoint FlexResponse or the Endpoint Discover Quarantine response rule. The credentials are stored in an encrypted folder on all endpoint computers that are connected to an Endpoint Server. Because all endpoint computers store the credentials, you must be careful about the type of credentials you store. Use credentials that cannot access other areas of your system. Before your endpoint credentials can be used, you must enable the Enforce Server to recognize them.\n\nTo create endpoint credentials\n\n1] Go to: System > Settings > General.\n\n2] Click Configure.\n\n3] Under the Credential Management section, ensure that the Allow Saved Credentials on Endpoint Agent checkbox is selected.\n\n4] Click Save.\n\n5] Go to: System > Settings > Credentials.\n\n6] Click Add Credential.\n\n7] Under the General section, enter the details of the credential you want to add.\n\n8] Under Usage Permission, select Servers and Endpoint agents.\n\n9] Click Save.\n\nProcedure Step 3 : Deploy the plug-in to your endpoint computers using the Endpoint FlexResponse utility and third-party systems management software (SMS).\n\nAbout deploying Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins on endpoint computers\n\nYou must install Symantec DLP Agents on the endpoint computers before deploying Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins. The Agents must be connected to an active Endpoint Server.\n\nSee the Symantec Data Loss Prevention Installation Guide for information on how to install the agents.\n\nYou must deploy Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins on each endpoint computer where you require Endpoint FlexResponse actions. You can use a manual installation or a silent installation method to deploy the plug-in. Silent installation methods involve using systems management software (SMS), to distribute and install software on all of your endpoint computers. You may need to create SMS scripts to access the installation folder.\n\nThis section assumes that you have created or otherwise obtained an Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in that is packaged as a ZIP file.\n\nDeploying an Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in on endpoint computers requires the following steps:\n\nStep 1 : Copy the Endpoint FlexResponse utility to your endpoint computers.:\n\nYou use the Endpoint FlexResponse utility to manage Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins. The Endpoint FlexResponse utility is not part of the default Symantec Data Loss Prevention download and is only available through Symantec or Symantec partners.\n\nStep 2 : Copy any third-party Python modules that your plug-in requires to your endpoint computers.\n\nStep 3 : Enable Endpoint FlexResponse on the Enforce Server :\n\nEnabling Endpoint FlexResponse on the Enforce Server\n\nBefore you can use Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins in your response rules, you must enable Endpoint FlexResponse functionality through the Enforce Server. By default, Endpoint FlexResponse functionality is not enabled. You enable Endpoint FlexResponse functionality through the Advanced Agent Settings.\n\nTo enable Endpoint FlexResponse functionality\n\n1] Open the Enforce Server administration console and navigate to: System > Agents > Agent Configuration and open the Agent configuration that is currently applied to the Endpoint Server that is connected to the Agents where you are deploying the Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in.\n\n2] Click the Advanced Agents Settings tab.\n\n3] Find the PostProcessor.ENABLE_FLEXRESPONSE.int setting.\n\n4] Change the setting to 1.\n\n5] Click Save and Apply.\n\nStep 4 : Deploy the Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in using the Endpoint FlexResponse utility. (flrinst.exe). Use one of the following options:\n\nDeploy your plug-in manually on a single endpoint computer. This option is most useful when you are developing or testing an Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in.\n\nDeploying an Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in using the Endpoint FlexResponse utility\n\nYou use the Endpoint FlexResponse utility to deploy Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins. The plug-ins must be in a .zip package format.\n\nTo deploy an Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in\n\n1] On an endpoint computer, open a command window and navigate to the Symantec DLP Agent installation tools directory. The default location of this directory is c:\\Program Files\\Manufacturer\\Endpoint Agent\\\n\n2] Enter the following command:\n\nflrinst.exe -op=install\n\n-package=<path_to_plug-in>\n\n-p=<myToolsPassword>Where:\n\n<myToolsPassword> is the Tools password for your Symantec Data Loss Prevention deployment. If you have not specified a Tools password, use the default password: VontuStop.\n\n<path_to_plug-in name> is the full path to the plug-in .zip file.\n\nFor example:\n\nflrinst -op=install -package=c:\\installs\\myFlexResponse_plugin.zip -p=myToolsPassword\n\nDeploy your plug-in using a silent installation process and SMS software. This option is most useful when you are deploying a production-ready Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in.\n\nDeploying Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins using a silent installation process\n\nYou can use system management software (SMS) to deploy Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins on multiple endpoint computers. Although the details of creating installation scripts for SMS software are beyond the scope of this document, note the following requirements:\n\nYou must install Symantec DLP Agents on the endpoint computers before deploying Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins. The Agents must be connected to an active Endpoint Server.\n\nYou must install the Endpoint FlexResponse utility (flrinst.exe) on each endpoint computer where you will deploy Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins.\n\nYou must make the Endpoint FlexResponse package ( a .zip file) available to each endpoint computer. You can copy the package to each endpoint computer, or you can make the package available on a network drive that is accessible by all endpoint computers.\n\nTo deploy your plug-in, use the command-line options of the Endpoint FlexResponse utility when creating your installation scripts.\n\nRemove the Endpoint FlexResponse utility after deploying your plug-in. If you leave the utility installed on the endpoint computers, a malicious user could use the utility to uninstall or alter your Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in.\n\nSee your individual SMS application documentation for more information on how to deploy using SMS.\n\nThe Endpoint FlexResponse utility is only available through Symantec and Symantec partners. It is not included with the Symantec Data Loss Prevention distribution.\n\nStep 5 : Create response rules that use Endpoint: FlexResponse actions that reference the plug-in, and add these rules to an active policy.\n\nSee \"Implementing policy detection\" in the Symantec Data Loss Prevention System Administration Guide.\n\nProcedure Step 4 : Enable Endpoint FlexResponse actions on your Enforce Server :\n\nEnabling Endpoint FlexResponse on the Enforce Server\n\nBefore you can use Endpoint FlexResponse plug-ins in your response rules, you must enable Endpoint FlexResponse functionality through the Enforce Server. By default, Endpoint FlexResponse functionality is not enabled. You enable Endpoint FlexResponse functionality through the Advanced Agent Settings.\n\nTo enable Endpoint FlexResponse functionality\n\n1] Open the Enforce Server administration console and navigate to: System > Agents > Agent Configuration and open the Agent configuration that is currently applied to the Endpoint Server that is connected to the Agents where you are deploying the Endpoint FlexResponse plug-in.\n\n2] Click the Advanced Agents Settings tab.\n\n3] Find the PostProcessor.ENABLE_FLEXRESPONSE.int setting.\n\n4] Change the setting to 1.\n\n5] Click Save and Apply.\n\nProcedure Step 5 : Add Endpoint FlexResponse actions to your response rules :\n\nAdding a new response rule\n\nAdd a new response rule from the Manage > Policies > Response Rules > New Response Rule screen.\n\nTo add a new response rule\n\nClick Add Response Rule at the Manage > Policies > Response Rules screen.\n\nAt the New Response Rule screen, select one of the following options:\n\nAutomated Response\n\nThe system automatically executes the response action as the server evaluates incidents (default option).\n\nSmart Response\n\nAn authorized user executes the response action from the Incident Snapshot screen in the Enforce Server administration console.\n\nClick Next to configure the response rule.\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention provides filtering capabilities at multiple levels to ensure optimal system performance. For example, an email marketing server can generate a large number of email messages that are not relevant to you. Filter those email messages from detection. Use the Configure Protocol page to achieve the desired functional and performance goals.\n\nI am going to explain you step by step configuration procedure for protocol filtering.....\n\nA] Configure protocol screen :\n\nB] Protocol configuration examples :\n\nNow .......\n\nA] Configure protocol screen :\n\nUse this screen to configure a new protocol or to modify the options for a system-configured protocol. Symantec Data Loss Prevention handles protocols differently, depending on whether they are system-configured (preconfigured in the Symantec Data Loss Prevention system) or user-configured. Symantec Data Loss Prevention recognizes system-configured protocols (such as SMTP and HTTP) based on protocol signature. It recognizes user-configured TCP protocols (such as telnet) based on the port over which the traffic travels.\n\nEnter or modify information about the protocol in available fields. :\n\nField : Name :\n\nEnter or modify the protocol name. You can use up to 256 characters. The protocol name appears in a number of places in the system, so be sure to provide a user-friendly name.\n\nField : Port :\n\nThis field appears only for user-configured TCP protocols. Enter one or more port numbers that are associated with the protocol. Separate port numbers with commas or hyphens. For example: 18, 23, 25-29, 82. If you configure a telnet protocol, enter 23 as the port number.\n\nField : Low Ports Monitored :\n\nThis field appears only for system-configured protocols, such as HTML and SMTP. Enter port numbers lower than 1024 that you want Symantec Data Loss Prevention to monitor. Cumulatively, ports you specify for any protocols serve as a positive filter. The ports tell Symantec Data Loss Prevention to monitor traffic of all protocol types on each of the specified ports. For example, if you specify port 25 for the SMTP entry, that port is monitored for traffic of all listed protocol types. Note that ports lower than 1024 are not monitored if you do not specify them for at least one protocol. By default, Symantec Data Loss Prevention monitors traffic on ports equal to or greater than 1024.\n\nField : IP :\n\nEnter any IP-based filters you want to use. If you leave this field blank, Symantec Data Loss Prevention matches and stores all streams. The format of the IP protocol filters (found in the protocol definitions and protocol filter definitions) is:\n\nIP Protocol Filter := protocol_filter_entry\n\n[;\n\nprotocol_filter_entry\n\n]\n\nProtocol Filter Entry := -|+,\n\ndestination_subnetwork_description\n\n,\n\nsource_ subnetwork_description\n\nSubnetwork description := network_address\n\n/\n\nsubnet_bitmask_size | *\n\nEach stream is evaluated in order against the filter entries until an entry matches the stream's IP parameters.\n\nA minus sign (-) at the start of the entry indicates that the stream is dropped.\n\nA plus sign (+) at the start of the entry indicates that the stream is kept.\n\nA subnet network description of * means that any packet matches this entry.\n\nA subnet bitmask size of 32 means that the entry must match the exact network address.\n\nFor example, the filter +,10.67.0.0/16,*;-,*,* matches all streams going to network 10.67.x.x but does not match any other traffic.\n\nNote:\n\nThe more specific you are when you define the recognition characteristics, the more specific your results. For example, if you define only one specific IP address, only incidents involved that IP address are captured. If you do not define any IP addresses, or if you define a wide range of IP addresses, you achieve broader results.\n\nField : Filtering (may override at server level) :\n\nThe Filtering fields enable you to specify details about the traffic you want to ignore to reduce the load and improve system performance. This section is also included in the Protocol Filter menu for individual Servers.\n\nField : IP Filter :\n\nFilters out unwanted traffic in the protocol; uses the same IP Protocol Filter format as for IP.\n\nField : L7 Sender Filter :\n\nSpecify any of the following items to evaluate:\n\nThe sender email (for SMTP/MSN IM)\n\nIP addresses (for UTCP)\n\nProxy-authenticated user names (for proxied HTTP/FTP)\n\nUser names (for AIM/Yahoo IM)\n\nSee the L7 Recipient Filter description for more information about the format of filter entries.\n\nField : L7 Recipient Filter :\n\nAny recipient email (for SMTP/MSN IM/FTP) or IP addresses (for UTCP), user names (for Yahoo IM/AIM), or URLs (for HTTP) to be evaluated.\n\nYou can use filters to include (inspect) or exclude (ignore) messages from specific senders or to specific recipients. You must precede each entry with a plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) to include or exclude matching results. For example:\n\nAny email address mask that starts with a plus sign (+) keeps matching messages for inspection. If you add the sender filter +*@abc.com, all messages that are sent from anyone in the abc.com domain are inspected.\n\nAny email address mask that starts with a minus sign (-) excludes matching messages from inspection. If you add the recipient filter -*@xyz.com, all messages that are sent to anyone in the xyz.com domain are not inspected.\n\nIf you add an asterisk (*) to the end of the filter expression, any message not explicitly matching any of the filter masks is ignored. For example, if you add the sender filter +*@abc.com,*, all messages from anyone in the abc.com domain are inspected, but all other messages are ignored.\n\nYou can also include asterisk wildcards elsewhere in the address strings. The specific filter syntax depends on the protocol. For example, for email addresses you can use wildcards anywhere in the filter string as follows:\n\n+*@symantec.com inspects all email to/from symantec.com.\n\n+*.symantec.com inspects all email to/from any subdomains of symantec.com.\n\n-*symantec.com excludes all email to/from any email address ending in symantec.com.\n\n-phil@fakedomain.com excludes all email to/from phil@fakedomain.com.\n\nThe order in which filters are evaluated is from left to right. For example, if you add the recipient filter\n\n-ceo@xyz.com, +*@xyz.com,*,all messages that are sent to ceo@xyz.com are ignored, and all messages that are sent to anyone in the xyz.com domain are inspected. The last asterisk tells the filter to ignore all other messages.\n\nIf the sender and recipient filters conflict, the resulting message is ignored. For example, this situation can happen if the sender filter for a particular message evaluates as \"inspect\" and the recipient filter evaluates as \"ignore.\"\n\nIf a recipient filter has multiple exclusion masks, recipients can match any of the exclusion masks and the message is excluded. For example, if the recipient filter is -*@xyz.com, -*@abc.com, all the messages that are sent to xyz.com and abc.com domains are ignored. Also, the messages that are sent to either xyz.com or abc.com (but not both) are ignored. If messages have any additional recipients in other domains, the messages are inspected.\n\nYou can monitor messages sent from the xyz.com domain but ignore message sent to that domain by adding the following filters:\n\nL7 Sender Filter: +*@xyz.com, *\n\nL7 Recipient Filter: -*@xyz.com\n\nFiled : Content :\n\nAn inclusion-based approach to filter out unwanted messages using text matching against the captured stream of packets. Every content filter entry must be matched or the stream is dropped. The format of the content filter is:\n\nContent Filter := content_filter_entry\n\n[;\n\ncontent_filter_entry\n\n]\n\nContent Filter Entry := I,\n\nheading_name\n\n,\n\nheading_value\n\n[,\n\nheading_ value\n\n]\n\nThe process traverses the stream looking for the heading name. One of the heading values must match the text following the heading name. Whitespace is ignored between the heading and the value. Capitalization is ignored.\n\nFor example, a filter of I,user-agent:,mozilla,opera;I,content-type:,multipart matches only those streams that have the text user-agent: followed immediately by mozilla or opera and the text content-type: followed immediately by the text multipart.\n\nAnother example is a stream with user-agent:mozilla and content-type:multipart is retained; a stream with user-agent:mozilla and content-type:text/plain is dropped.\n\nField : Search Depth :\n\nHow many packets deep to search for the specified text string.\n\nNote: The deeper the search, the longer it takes.\n\nField : Sampling (Processed/10000) :\n\nThe number out of each 10,000 messages you want to monitor as a representative sampling. For example, enter 10000 to have Symantec Data Loss Prevention search every message in this protocol. If you enter 200, it searches 200 out of every 10,000 messages.\n\nField : Content Processing :\n\nUse the Content Processing section to specify how to handle the messages in this protocol.\n\nSelect one of the following options:\n\nGeneric String Extraction - Evaluate the entire message against all applicable policies.\n\nDon't Process Content - Do not evaluate the content at all; count every message as an incident.\n\nField : Incident Representation :\n\nSelect one of the following options:\n\nUni-Directional - Evaluate only outgoing traffic.\n\nBi-Directional - Evaluate one character at a time from both directions of the connection. Represent them as two separate blocks of text, one for each direction.. This option is generally used for Telnet and similar protocols.\n\nBi-Directional Interlaced - Evaluate a text block at a time from both directions of the connection. Try to put the blocks back in the order in which they were transmitted. They are intermingled. There may be multiple blocks of text. This option is generally used for instant messaging and similar protocols.\n\nField : Maximum wait until written :\n\nThe maximum number of 5-second intervals a stream remains active without traffic before the stream is written to disk.\n\nField : Maximum wait until dropped :\n\nThe maximum number of 5-second intervals a stream remains in memory after the stream content is dumped to disk.\n\nField : Maximum stream packets :\n\nThe maximum number of packets in a stream before that stream is spooled to disk.\n\nField : Minimum stream size :\n\nThe minimum size of the stream.\n\nField : Maximum stream size :\n\nThe maximum size of the stream.\n\nField : Segment Interval :\n\nThe number of 5-second intervals between attempts to segment persistent streams into individual messages.\n\nField : No Traffic Notification Timeout :\n\nThe number of seconds that no new packets are seen on the protocol before a system warning is posted.\n\nField : Is Terminated on FIN :\n\nIf you select this option, you indicate that a FIN packet or RST packet causes the stream to be written to disk immediately.\n\nClick Save to save all changes to the protocol.\n\nFor changes to take effect, you must restart the affected servers. Any changes to IP filters require restarting any Monitor Servers. Any changes to L7 filters require restarting all Monitor and Prevent Servers.\n\nClick Cancel to cancel all changes to the protocol.\n\nB] Protocol configuration examples :\n\nYou configure protocols to indicate which network traffic the system captures, processes, and presents to you. Protocols are divided into two categories:\n\nSystem protocols are the protocols that Symantec Data Loss Prevention fully supports.\n\nCustom protocols let you define and monitor network communication that Symantec Data Loss Prevention does not fully support. Symantec Data Loss Prevention also provides a number of well known protocols as custom protocols.\n\nThe following examples show common protocol configurations:\n\n1] Filtering HTTP for browser-generated traffic\n\n2] Monitoring only outbound email\n\n3] Monitoring for the existence of prohibited traffic\n\n4] Monitoring for high port incidents\n\n1] Filtering HTTP for browser-generated traffic :\n\nHTTP has a wide variety of encapsulated content. HTTP header values often define the type of content in the stream. The header values are name value pairs. For example the program that launched an HTTP request is often described after the header name User-agent.\n\nThis example filters HTTP headers based on the User-agent to capture data from browsers. These browsers contain User-agent values of Mozilla or Opera.\n\nTo filter HTTP headers based on the User-agent\n\ni] Select System > Settings > Protocols from the navigation bar.\n\nii] Select the HTTP protocol.\n\niii] In the Filtering (may override at server level) section of the page, enter the following in the Content field:\n\nI,user-agent:,mozilla,operaClick Save, and then restart the servers.\n\niv] If you use a custom configuration, you must make the same change in every server's HTTP configuration.\n\n2] Monitoring only outbound email :\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention can capture inbound email and outbound email at an organization. Outbound email is often identified as the most important email to monitor. In most organizations, the email servers are located in a set of subnets.\n\nTo set up SMTP to monitor only a certain set of subnets\n\ni] Select System > Settings > Protocols from the navigation bar.\n\nii] Select the SMTP protocol.\n\niii] In the Filtering (may override at server level) section of the page, enter the following in the Content field:\n\n+,*,10.1.0/16;-,*,*This example assumes that the source net where your Servers are located is 10.1.0.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. The rule filters out any SMTP traffic not coming from the 10.1 subnet.\n\niv] Click Save, and then restart the monitors.\n\nYou must make the same change in local Server configurations.\n\n3] Monitoring for the existence of prohibited traffic :\n\nIn some cases, it is helpful to know if traffic occurs for a certain protocol or destination. For instance, traffic to address 10.1.2.3 on ports 5000 thru 5010 may indicate the existence of an online service that is prohibited in any organization. The traffic may be encrypted or otherwise unreadable and may create many incidents, so you might want to record its existence only.\n\nTo record only the existence of traffic\n\ni] Select System > Settings > Protocols from the navigation bar.\n\nii] Click Add Protocol.\n\niii] Enter a name for the protocol in the Name field.\n\niv] In the Recognition section of the page, enter the following information:\n\nField name\n\nEntry\n\nPorts\n\n5000-5010\n\nIP\n\n+,10.1.2.3/32 ,*;-,*,*\n\nv] Click Save.\n\nThe new protocol appears at the end of the protocol list. You can use the new protocol in policies and report filters.\n\n4] Monitoring for high port incidents :\n\nIn some organizations, firewalls allow connections between high port applications like p2p. This traffic can occur over any port and may be interspersed with a great deal of random data. To identify potential areas of investigation without overwhelming the Server with traffic, you can create a sampling protocol.\n\nTo create a sampling protocol\n\ni] Select System > Settings > Protocols from the navigation bar.\n\nii] Click Add Protocol.\n\niii] Enter a name for the protocol in the Name field.\n\nIiv] n the Recognition section of the page, enter the following into the Ports field:\n\n1025-36355This entry instructs the protocol to match any high port traffic.\n\nv] In the Filtering section of the page, enter the following into the Sampling field:\n\n100This value reduces the number of streams created that Symantec Data Loss Prevention inspects. Adjust this number based on the server's ability to process the new traffic in a timely fashion.\n\nvi] Click Save.\n\nvii] Look for the new protocol at the end of the protocol list. If the protocol is not at the bottom of the list, move it there. Moving it ensures that more well-defined traffic is not mistakenly defined as this generic traffic.\n\nLanguage packs for Symantec Data Loss Prevention localize the product for a particular language on Windows-based systems. After a language pack has been added to Symantec Data Loss Prevention, administrators can specify it as the system-wide default. If multiple language packs have been made available by the administrator for use, individual users can choose the language they want to work in.\n\nThe use of locales and languages is specified through the Enforce Server administration console by the following roles:\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention administrator. Specifies that one of the available languages be the default system-wide language and sets the locale.\n\nIndividual Symantec Data Loss Prevention user. Chooses which of the available locales to use.\n\nNote:\n\nThe addition of multiple language packs could slightly affect Enforce Server performance, depending on the number of languages and customizations present. This results because an additional set of indexes has to be built and maintained for each language.\n\nWarning: Do not modify the Oracle database NLS_LANGUAGE and NLS_TERRITORY settings.\n\nLanguage pack selection results in the following:\n\n@ Its locale becomes available to administrators and end users in Enforce Server Configuration screen.\n\n@ Enforce Server screens, menu items, commands, and messages appear in the language.\n\n@ The Symantec Data Loss Prevention Help system may be displayed in the language.\n\nLanguage packs for Symantec Data Loss Prevention are available from Symantec File Connect.\n\nCaution: When you install a new version of Symantec Data Loss Prevention, any language packs you have installed are deleted. For a new, localized version of Symantec Data Loss Prevention, you must upgrade to a new version of the language pack.\n\nAbout locales :\n\nA locale provides the following:\n\n@ Displays dates and numbers in formats appropriate for that locale.\n\n@ Sorts lists and reports based on text columns, such as \"policy name\" or \"file owner,\" alphabetically according to the rules of the locale.\n\nLocales are installed as part of a language pack.\n\nAn administrator can also configure an additional locale for use by individual users. This additional locale need only be supported by the required version of Java.\n\nFor a list of these locales, see http://java.sun.com/j2se/version/docs/guide/intl/locale.doc.html, where version equals the currently supported Java version.\n\nAny locales listed as \"fully supported locales\" or as \"also provided, but not tested\" may be used except Turkish. English is the default locale, so it need not be independently selected.\n\nThe locale can be specified at product installation time, as described in the Symantec Data Loss Prevention Installation Guide. It can also be configured at a later time using the Language Pack Utility.\n\nA Symantec Data Loss Prevention administrator specifies which of the available languages is the default system-wide language.\n\nTo choose the default language for all users\n\n1] On the Enforce Server, go to System > Settings > General and click Configure.\n\nThe Edit General Settings screen is displayed.\n\n2] Scroll to the Language section of the Edit General Settings screen, and click the button next to the language you want to use as the system-wide default.\n\n3] Click Save.\n\nIndividual Symantec Data Loss Prevention users can choose which of the available languages and locales they want to use by updating their profiles.\n\nAdministrators can use the Language Pack Utility to update the available languages.\n\nUsing the Language Pack Utility :\n\nTo make a specific locale available for Symantec Data Loss Prevention, you add language packs through the Language Pack Utility.\n\nYou run the Language Pack Utility from the command line. Its executable, LanguagePackUtility.exe, resides in the \\Vontu\\Protect\\bin directory.\n\nTo use the Language Pack Utility, you must have Read, Write, and Execute permissions on all of the \\Vontu folders and subfolders.\n\nTo display help for the utility, such as the list of valid options and their flags, enter LanguagePackUtility without any flags.\n\nNote: Running the Language Pack Utility causes the VontuManager and VontuIncidentPersister services to stop for as long as 20 seconds. Any users who are logged on to the Enforce Server administration console will be logged out automatically. When finished making its updates, the utility restarts the services automatically, and users can log back on to the administration console.\n\nLanguage packs for Symantec Data Loss Prevention can be obtained from Symantec File Connect.\n\nTo add a language pack (Windows)\n\n1] Advise other users that anyone currently using the Enforce Server administration console must save their work and log off.\n\n2] Run the Language Pack Utility with the -a flag followed by the name of the ZIP file for that language pack. Enter:\n\nLanguagePackUtility -a filenamewhere filename is the fully qualified path and name of the language pack ZIP file.\n\nFor example, if the Japanese language pack ZIP file is stored in c:\\temp, add it by entering:\n\nLanguagePackUtility -a c:\\temp\\Symantec_DLP_10.5_Lang_Pack-JP.zip\n\nTo add multiple language packs during the same session, specify multiple file names, separated by spaces, for example:\n\nLanguagePackUtility -a\n\nc:\\temp\\Symantec_DLP_10.5_Lang_Pack-TW.zip\n\nSymantec_DLP_10.5_Lang_Pack-CS.zip\n\n3] Log on to the Enforce Server administration console and confirm that the new language option is available on the Edit General Settings screen. To do this, go to System > Settings > General > Configure > Edit General Settings.\n\nTo add a language pack (Linux) :\n\n1] Advise other users that anyone currently using the Enforce Server administration console must save their work and log off.\n\n2] Open a terminal session to the Enforce Server host and switch to the DLP_system_account by running the following command:\n\nsu - DLP_system_account\n\n3] Run the following command:\n\nDLP_home/Protect/bin/LanguagePackUtility -a <path to language pack zip file>\n\n4] Log on to the Enforce Server administration console and confirm that the new language option is available on the Edit General Settings screen. To do this, go to System > Settings > General > Configure > Edit General Settings.\n\nTo remove a language pack :\n\n1] Advise users that anyone currently using the Enforce Server administration console must save their work and log off.\n\n2] Run the Language Pack Utility with the -r flag followed by the Java locale code of the language pack you want to remove. Enter:\n\nLanguagePackUtility -r localewhere locale is a valid Java locale code corresponding to a Symantec Data Loss Prevention language pack.\n\nFor example, to remove the French language pack enter:\n\nLanguagePackUtility -r fr_FR\n\nTo remove multiple language packs during the same session, specify multiple file names, separated by spaces.\n\n3] Log on to the Enforce Server administration console and confirm that the language pack is no longer available on the Edit General Settings screen. To do this, go to System > Settings > General > Configure > Edit General Settings.\n\nRemoving a language pack has the following effects:\n\n@ Users can no longer select the locale of the removed language pack for individual use.\n\nNote: If the locale of the language pack is supported by the version of Java required for running Symantec Data Loss Prevention, the administrator can later specify it as an alternate locale for any users who need it.\n\n@ The locale reverts to the system-wide default configured by the administrator.\n\n@ If the removed language was the system-wide default locale, the system locale reverts to English.\n\nTo change or add a locale :\n\n1] Advise users that anyone currently using the Enforce Server administration console must save their work and log off.\n\n2] Run the Language Pack Utility using the -c flag followed by the Java locale code for the locale that you want to change or add. Enter:\n\nLanguagePackUtility -c localewhere locale is a valid locale code recognized by Java, such as pt_PT for Portuguese.\n\nFor example, to change the locale to Brazilian Portuguese enter:\n\nLanguagePackUtility -c pt_BR\n\n3] Log on to the Enforce Server administration console and confirm that the new alternate locale is now available on the Edit General Settings screen. To do this, go to System > Settings > General > Configure > Edit General Settings.\n\nIf you specify a locale for which there is no language pack, \"Translations not available\" appears next to the locale name. This means that formatting and sort order are appropriate for the locale, but the Enforce Server administration console screens and online Help are not translated.\n\nNote: Administrators can only make one additional locale available for users that is not based on a previously installed Symantec Data Loss Prevention language pack.\n\nAbout support for character sets, languages, and locales :\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention fully supports international deployments by offering a large number of languages and localization options:\n\n@ Policy creation and violation detection across many languages.\n\nThe supported languages can be used in keywords, data identifiers, regular expressions, exact data profiles (EDM) and document profiles (IDM).\n\n@ Operation on localized and Multilingual User Interface (MUI) versions of Windows operating systems.\n\n@ International character sets. To view and work with international character sets, the system on which you are viewing the Enforce Server administration console must have the appropriate capabilities.\n\n@ Locale-based date and number formats, as well as sort orders for lists and reports.\n\n@ Localized user interface (UI) and Help system. Language packs for Symantec Data Loss Prevention provide language-specific versions of the Enforce Server administration console. They may also provide language-specific versions of the online Help system.\n\nNote: These language packs are added separately following initial product installation.\n\n@ Localized product documentation.\n\nNote: If the Enforce Server runs on a Linux host, you must install language fonts on the host machine using the Linux Package Manager application. Language font packages begin with fonts-<language_name>. For example, fonts-japanese-0.20061016-4.el5.noarch\n\nSupported languages for detection :\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention supports a large number of languages for detection. Policies can be defined that accurately detect and report on the violations found in content in these languages.\n\nArabic\n\nBrazilian Portuguese\n\nChinese (traditional)\n\nChinese (simplified)\n\nCzech\n\nDanish\n\nDutch\n\nEnglish\n\nFinnish\n\nFrench\n\nGerman\n\nGreek\n\nHebrew\n\nHungarian\n\nItalian\n\nJapanese\n\nKorean\n\nNorwegian\n\nPolish\n\nPortuguese\n\nRomanian\n\nRussian\n\nSpanish\n\nSwedish\n\nTurkish\n\n*Symantec Data Loss Prevention cannot be installed on a Windows operating system that is localized for the Turkish language, and you cannot choose Turkish as an alternate locale.\n\nFor additional information about specific languages, see the Symantec Data Loss Prevention Release Notes.\n\nA number of capabilities are not implied by this support:\n\n@ Technical support provided in a non-English language. Because Symantec Data Loss Prevention supports a particular language does not imply that technical support is delivered in that language.\n\n@ Localized administrative user interface (UI) and documentation. Support for a language does not imply that the UI or product documentation has been localized into that language. However, even without a localized UI, user-defined portions of the UI such as pop-up notification messages on the endpoint can still be localized into any language by entering the appropriate text in the UI.\n\n@ Localized content. Keywords are used in a number of areas of the product, including policy templates and data identifiers. Support for a language does not imply that these keywords have been translated into that language. Users may, however, add keywords in the new language through the Enforce Server administration console.\n\n@ New file types, protocols, applications, or encodings. Support for a language does not imply support for any new file types, protocols, applications, or encodings that may be prevalent in that language or region other than what is already supported in the product.\n\n@ Language-specific normalization. An example of normalization is to treat accented and unaccented versions of a character as the same. The product already performs a number of normalizations, including standard Unicode normalization that should cover the vast majority of cases. However, it does not mean that all potential normalizations are included.\n\n@ Region-specific normalization and validation. An example of this is the awareness the product has of the format of North American phone numbers, which allows it to treat different versions of a number as the same, and to identify invalid numbers in EDM source files. Support for a language does not imply this kind of functionality for that language or region.\n\nItems in these excluded categories are tracked as individual product enhancements on a language- or region-specific basis. Please contact Symantec Support for additional information on language-related enhancements or plans for the languages not listed.\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention for Mobile connects to your corporate network through Wi-Fi access or through cellular 3G connectivity. Network traffic for Webmail, third-party applications such as Yahoo and Facebook, and corporate email applications including Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync,IBM Lotus Notes Traveller, is sent through the HTTP/S protocol. Corporate email can be sent through Microsoft ActiveSync as either HTTP or HTTPS protocol information. Microsoft ActiveSync receives the information from the corporate proxy server after it has gone through detection; then, sends the message to the corporate Exchange Server. Messages that are sent through applications such as Facebook or Dropbox can be blocked from the message, depending on your policies.\n\nThe above graphic illustrates the connections necessary to enable Symantec Data Loss Prevention for Mobile:\n\nMobile devices must connect to the corporate network through a virtual private network (VPN) to send corporate messages or access the corporate network. The Mobile Prevent solution requires that mobile devices use the VPN On Demand feature to create a constant, protected VPN connection. If you are not connected to the corporate network, Mobile Prevent cannot detect any policy violations.\n\nYour mobile device connects to the VPN server to gain access to your corporate network.\n\nThe VPN server assigns an IP address to each mobile device that connects to it. These IP addresses form a VPN subnetwork. The VPN subnetwork lets your mobile devices access the corporate network and the corporate proxy server. You can specify a range of IP addresses that your VPN server can assign to other devices. All of the IP addresses that the VPN server assigns to your mobile devices are within this range. If a range of addresses were not specified for your VPN server, the network could randomly assign IP addresses to your mobile devices. A specific range of IP addresses lets Symantec Data Loss Prevention identify which IP addresses are assigned to mobile devices and which addresses are not connected. Using a range of IP addresses assists in identifying which mobile device generated an incident.\n\nIf you deploy Mobile Prevent and Network Prevent together, the IP address identifies Network and Mobile incident types.\n\nOn the Mobile Prevent side, VPN On Demand ensures that the VPN connection is not interrupted. Apple mobile devices use VPN On Demand to dynamically create a VPN session. VPN on Demand starts the VPN session when connecting to a specific list of configured domains (for example .com, .net, or .org). Certificate-based authentication is required to configure the VPN On Demand feature. By configuring how VPN On Demand automatically enables VPN on an iOS mobile device, you can ensure that all traffic goes through your corporate network. You need a Web proxy that is deployed in transparent mode to route traffic from the mobile devices in your corporate network to Symantec Data Loss Prevention. The network traffic is routed uses the ICAP service.\n\nYou can use a mobile device management (MDM) solution to apply the network and VPN configuration.\n\nVPN configuration can be specified in a configuration profile by your mobile device management (MDM) solution. The MDM solution applies a configuration profile to each mobile device that you want to connect to your corporate network.\n\nUse a mobile device management (MDM) solution to manage and apply a wide variety of configuration settings to multiple mobile devices. You can load user profiles where corporate mail settings, VPN settings, security certificates, and proxy server settings are preconfigured onto the mobile devices. To access the Mobile Prevent for Web Server, you must use an MDM solution to apply the VPN server configuration profile. The VPN server configuration profile sets the conditions for VPN On Demand to route all network traffic through the VPN and into your corporate network. Only network traffic flowing in your corporate network can be monitored for violations.\n\nImplementing Mobile Prevent :\n\nThe Mobile Prevent for Web Server integrates with a VPN server, an MDM solution, and a Web proxy server using ICAP. If it detects confidential data in Web content, the proxy will reject requests or remove HTML content as specified in your Mobile Prevent policies.\n\nFirst, you need to know the high-level steps that are required for implementing Mobile Prevent. You can check the cross-referenced sections for more details. There are two deployment scenarios for Mobile Prevent: the Mobile Prevent as a standalone product, and Mobile Prevent installed in combination with Network Prevent. The following procedure assumes that you are implementing Mobile Prevent as a standalone product. If you want to implement Mobile Prevent and Network Prevent, you must also follow the implementation instructions for Network Prevent.\n\nAbout deploying Mobile Prevent as a standalone solution :\n\nWhen you deploy Mobile Prevent as a standalone solution, no other detection server is deployed with the Mobile Prevent for Web Server. The Mobile Prevent for Web Server interacts with the Enforce Server and the corporate proxy server to monitor and prevent incidents on mobile devices. The following diagram describes how the Mobile Prevent solution fits into your corporate infrastructure:\n\nIn this deployment, mobile devices connect to the corporate network through your VPN server. The VPN server assigns each mobile device an IP address. This address lets the device access the internal corporate network. After the device is assigned a unique IP address, all HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP traffic is monitored by the Mobile Prevent for Web Server. Each device must be connected to the corporate network through the VPN. If the VPN connection to the corporate network is lost, Mobile Prevent cannot detect any violations.\n\niPads and iPhones use a native feature called VPN On Demand to create a secure VPN connection automatically without user intervention. VPN On Demand requires certificate-based authentication to create the connection to the VPN Server.\n\nAfter the VPN connection is established, traffic is sent through the proxy server and analyzed by Mobile Prevent for Web Server. Traffic between the proxy server and the Mobile Prevent for Web Server is done over the ICAP protocol. If no violations are discovered, the traffic is sent to its destination either internally or externally. If violations are discovered, an incident is created and response actions are implemented. Incidents are recorded on the Enforce Server.\n\nWhen a mobile device sends an email through Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, the HTTP/HTTPS packets are sent to the ActiveSync server. The packets are then sent to the Exchange Server. Any corporate email should go through Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. Mobile Prevent does not support the SMTP protocol.\n\nNote: Mobile Prevent does not support response mode (RESPMOD).\n\nBelow implementing procedures assume that you already have your VPN and proxy servers running in your environment.\n\nProcedure Step 1 : Add a new Mobile Prevent Server.\n\nAdding a detection server\n\nAdd the detection servers that you want to your Symantec Data Loss Prevention system from the System > Servers > Overview screen.\n\nYou can add the following types of servers:\n\nNetwork Monitor Server, which monitors network traffic.\n\nNetwork Protect Server, which inspects stored data for policy violations (Network Discover).\n\nNetwork Prevent Server, which prevents SMTP violations.\n\nNetwork Prevent Server, which prevents ICAP proxy server violations such as FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS.\n\nMobile Prevent for Web Server, which monitors and prevents HTTPS, HTTPS, and FTP violations over mobile devices.\n\nNote:\n\nIf your Symantec Data Loss Prevention license includes both Mobile Prevent for Web and Network Prevent for Web Servers you add a single detection server called Network and Mobile Prevent for Web Server.\n\nEndpoint Server, which controls Symantec DLP Agents that monitor endpoint computers.\n\nClassification Server, which analyzes email messages that are sent from a Symantec Enterprise Vault filter, and provides a classification result that Enterprise Vault can use to perform tagging, archival, and deletion as necessary.\n\nProcedure Step 2: Configure your Mobile Prevent Server.\n\nConfiguring the Mobile Prevent for Web Server\n\nYou can use a number of configuration options for Mobile Prevent for Web Server. For example, you can configure the server to:\n\nIgnore small HTTP/S requests or responses.\n\nIgnore requests to or responses from a particular host or domain (such as the domain of a business subsidiary).\n\nIgnore user search engine queries.\n\nTo modify your Mobile Prevent for Web Server configuration\n\nGo to System > Servers > Overview and click the Mobile Prevent for Web Server.\n\nOn the Server Detail screen that appears, click Configure.\n\nYou can verify or modify settings on the ICAP tab as described in subsequent steps. The tab is divided into several sections: Request Filtering, Response Filtering, and Connection.\n\nVerify or change the Trial Mode setting.\n\nVerify or modify the filter options for requests from HTTP clients (user agents). The options in the Request Filtering section are as follows:\n\nIgnore Requests Smaller Than\n\nSpecifies the minimum body size of HTTP requests to inspect. (The default is 4096 bytes.) For example, search-strings typed in to search engines such as Yahoo or Google are usually short. By adjusting this value, you can exclude those searches from inspection.\n\nIgnore Requests without Attachments\n\nCauses the server to inspect only the requests that contain attachments. This option can be useful if you are mainly concerned with requests intended to post sensitive files.\n\nIgnore Requests to Hosts or Domains\n\nCauses the server to ignore requests to the hosts or domains you specify. This option can be useful if you expect a lot of HTTP traffic between the domains of your corporate headquarters and branch offices. You can type one or more host or domain names (for example, www.company.com), each on its own line.\n\nIgnore Requests from User Agents\n\nCauses the server to ignore requests from user agents (HTTP clients) you specify. This option can be useful if your organization uses a program or language (such as Java) that makes frequent HTTP requests. You can type one or more user agent values (for example, java/6.0.29), each on its own line.\n\nNote: The Response Filtering options are not supported for Mobile Prevent.\n\nVerify or modify the filter options for responses from Web servers. The options in the Response Filtering section are as follows:\n\nIgnore Responses Smaller Than\n\nSpecifies the minimum size of the body of HTTP responses that are inspected by this server. (Default is 4096 bytes.)\n\nInspect Content Type\n\nSpecifies the MIME content types that Symantec Data Loss Prevention should monitor in responses. By default, this field contains content-type values for Microsoft Office, PDF, and plain text formats. To add others, type one MIME content type per line. For example, type application/wordperfect5.1 to have Symantec Data Loss Prevention analyze WordPerfect 5.1 files.\n\nNote that it is generally more efficient to specify MIME content types at the Web proxy level.\n\nIgnore Responses from Hosts or Domains\n\nCauses the server to ignore responses from the hosts or domains you specify. You can type one or more host or domain names (for example, www.company.com), each on its own line.\n\nIgnore Responses to User Agents\n\nCauses the server to ignore responses to user agents (HTTP clients) you specify. You can type one or more user agent values (for example, java/1.4.2_xx), each on its own line.\n\nVerify or modify settings for the ICAP connection between the HTTP proxy server and the Mobile Prevent for Web Server. The Connection options are as follows:\n\nTCP Port\n\nSpecifies the TCP port number over which this server listens for ICAP requests. This number must match the value that is configured on the HTTP proxy that sends ICAP requests to this server. The recommended value is 1344.\n\nMaximum Number of Requests\n\nSpecifies the maximum number of simultaneous ICAP request connections from the HTTP proxy or proxies. The default is 25.\n\nMaximum Number of Responses\n\nSpecifies the maximum number of simultaneous ICAP response connections from the HTTP proxy or proxies. The default is 25.\n\nConnection Backlog\n\nSpecifies the number of waiting connections allowed. A waiting connection is a user waiting for an HTTP response from the browser. The minimum value is 1. If the HTTP proxy gets too many requests (or responses), the proxy handles them according to your proxy configuration. You can configure the HTTP proxy to block any requests (or responses) greater than this number.\n\nIn the Mobile IP Ranges fields, enter the range of IP addresses that your VPN server is configured to assign to mobile devices. The IP addresses are used to identify the incidents that were triggered from mobile devices as Mobile incidents.\n\nThe IP addresses you enter into this range do not dynamically affect the VPN Server. This range is only to identify your mobile devices in the administration console. You must enter the exact same range of IP addresses when you configure the VPN Server to assign the addresses.\n\nClick Save to exit the Configure Server screen and then click Done to exit the Server Detail screen.\n\nProcedure Step 3: Configure your VPN Server with the IP address range that you want to assign to the corporate mobile devices for the Mobile Prevent sub-network\n\nProcedure Step 4 : Configure your VPN profile with the MDM application.\n\nYou must configure the VPN profile before mobile devices can connect to the corporate network. The VPN profile combines security certificates, the VPN server configuration settings, VPN On Demand settings, and any network configuration settings. Normally, the VPN profile is set and applied through your MDM solution. Along with the VPN profile, you can configure other aspects of your mobile device such as Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, firewall properties, or LDAP settings.\n\nProcedure Step 5 : Define ICAP services on proxy to route traffic to Mobile Prevent Web Server.\n\nProcedure Step 6 : Create and deploy a policy for Mobile Prevent.\n\nCreating policies for Mobile Prevent\n\nYou can create the policies that include most standard response rules. The response rules include Add Note, Limit Incident Data Retention, Log to a Syslog Server, Set Attribute, and Set Status.\n\nYou can also incorporate the response rules that are specific to Mobile Prevent Server as follows:\n\nNetwork Prevent and Mobile Prevent: Block HTTP/HTTPS\n\nBlocks the posts that contain confidential data (as defined in your policies). This includes Web postings, Web-based email messages, and files that are uploaded to Web sites or attached to Web-based email messages.\n\nNote:\n\nCertain applications may not provide an adequate response to the Network Prevent and Mobile Prevent: Block HTTP/HTTPS response action. This behavior has been observed with the Yahoo! Mail application when a detection server blocks a file upload. If a user tries to upload an email attachment and the attachment triggers a Network Prevent: Block HTTP/HTTPS response action, Yahoo! Mail does not respond or display an error message to indicate that the file is blocked. Instead, Yahoo! Mail appears to continue uploading the selected file, but the upload never completes. The user must manually cancel the upload at some point by pressing Cancel.\n\nOther applications may also exhibit this behavior, depending on how they handle the block request. In these cases a detection server incident is created and the file upload is blocked even though the application provides no such indication.\n\nNetwork Prevent and Mobile Prevent: Remove HTTP/HTTPS Content\n\nRemoves confidential data from posts that contain confidential data (as defined in your policies). This includes Web-based email messages and files that are uploaded to Web sites. Note that the Remove HTTP/HTTPS Content action works only on requests.\n\nNetwork Prevent and Mobile Prevent: Block FTP Request\n\nBlocks FTP transfers that contain confidential data (as defined in your policies).\n\nFor details on setting up any response rule action, open the online Help.\n\nGo to Manage > Policies > Response Rules and click Add Response Rule.\n\nEven if you do not incorporate response rules into your policy, Mobile Prevent captures incidents as long as your policies contain detection rules. You can set up such policies to monitor Web and FTP activity on your mobile device before implementing the policies that block or remove content.\n\nIf you have configured your proxy to forward both HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses, your policies work on both. For example, policies are applied to both an upload to a Web site and a download from a Web site.\n\nTo create a test policy for Mobile Prevent\n\nIn the Enforce Server administration console, create a response rule that includes one of the actions specific to Mobile Prevent. For example, create a response rule that includes the Network Prevent and Mobile Prevent: Block HTTP/HTTPS action.\n\nCreate a policy that incorporates the response rule you configured in the previous step.\n\nFor example, create a policy called Test Policy as follows:\n\nInclude a Content Matches Keyword detection rule that matches on the keyword \"secret.\"\n\nInclude a Network Prevent and Mobile Prevent: Block HTTP/HTTPS response rule.\n\nAssociate it with the Default policy group.\n\nProcedure Step 7 : Test the system by generating an incident against your test policy.\n\nTesting Mobile Prevent\n\nYou can test Mobile Prevent by sending an email that violates your test policy.\n\nTo test your system\n\nConnect your mobile device to the Internet and connect to your corporate VPN.\n\nOpen your corporate email client and send an email with an attachment containing confidential data. For example, access your Microsoft Outlook client and send an email with an attachment containing the word secret and paragraphs of other text.\n\nIn the Enforce Server administration console, go to Incidents > Mobile and click Incidents - All. Look for the resulting incident. For example, search for an incident entry that includes the appropriate timestamp and policy name.\n\nClick on the relevant incident entry to see the complete incident snapshot.\n\nProcedure Step 8 : If required, troubleshoot the implementation.\n\nSee the Symantec Data Loss Prevention System Requirements and Compatibility Guide for more details on configuring Mobile Prevent to work within your organization.\n\nLately it has been noticed an increasing spread of threats which, entering a system by various means are encrypting several files on the attacked system like office documents, database files, e-mail archives, which represent a value for the attacked customer.\n\nThose threats generally, after encrypting the files, sometimes delete themselves or propagate through the network.\n\nTo decrypt the file the hackers generally ask to pay a certain amount of money.\n\nIn order not to create misunderstandings, customers need to be aware of the following: encrypted files will remain encrypted. These should be replaced from a known-good backup (and Enterprises are responsible for regularly backing up their own important data).\n\nSymantec products do not decrypt files that have been affected by these threats.\n\nWhy? The reason is as simple as very often not considered. The majority of these kind of threats is using an RSA public-key cryptography at 1024 or 2048 bits. Despit of a number of commercial tools which are released the truth is such: for large RSA key sizes (in excess of 1024 bits), no efficient method for solving this problem is known (this is the so called \"RSA problem\")\n\nTo know more about it:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_problem\n\nAnyway, to pay the hackers is not a solution at all.\n\nWhen a customer pays the hackers, there is no guarantee that the attacker can or will supply a method of unlocking their computer or decrypting their files. For some variants, Symantec has received reports that the threat was received, the attacker provided a code to allow the threat to un-do the encryption that has been done on the customer’s files. Then, once Symantec updated our detection, the threat .exe is removed (deleted/quarantined) and the un-encryption can no longer continue.\n\nWhen customers pay hackers for threats, such as these, it encourages attackers to continue these tactics and additional attacks against everyone.\n\nPlease do not pay the hackers!\n\nAdditional information about those threats\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/docs/TECH211589\n\nhttps://www-secure.symantec.com/connect/blogs/ransomcrypt-thriving-menace\n\nhttps://www-secure.symantec.com/connect/blogs/cryptolocker-alert-millions-uk-targeted-mass-spam-campaign\n\nhttps://www-secure.symantec.com/connect/blogs/cryptolocker-qa-menace-year\n\nFirst Response\n\nIf the infection somehow already entered in our environment, the damage, unfortunately is already done.\n\nAnyway, if we identify the threat in a timely manner, we can prevent the threat to spread and contain the damage.\n\nWhenever you find a system in your environment which is being infected from this kind of encrypting threat, the first thing to do, even more than in other cases is:\n\nIsolate the machine from the network!!\n\nAfterwards, you will need to identify the virus finding the executable file and submit it to Symantec Security Response.\n\nHint: in order to help yourself in identifying the malicious files, you can run a threat analysis on the affected machine using the SymHelp tool:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH215519\n\nThen, contact the Symantec Enterprise Technical Support to know how to submit files:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/support/contact_techsupp_static.jsp\n\nIn order to stop the eventual expanding of the threat in your environment, through the Symantec Endpoint Protection, you can use the “Application and Device Control” component to block the execution of that specific file, identifying it through the hash MD5:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH93451\n\nAn alternative way to get the hash MD5:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH96745\n\nOnce the threat has been blocked and the incoming new definitions from Symantec will remove the threat we can restore our data from backup.\n\nThere are many ways to maintain a safe backup of sensible data: each organization can choose the most suitable to its needs. Here an example:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/recovering-ransomlocked-files-using-built-windows-tools\n\nHow to prevent this unpleasant situation to repeat?\n\nWhat the most of the people who faced this kind of threat at least once surely will desire, it is not to face it anymore.\n\nTo achieve this it is possible to take proactive steps to protect our environment.\n\n- Disable Auto-Run\n\nThe first thing to do, if not done already, surely is disable Auto-Run feature on all machines:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH104447\n\n- Enable IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) component:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH95347\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH104434\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/two-reasons-why-ips-must-have-your-network\n\n- Increase the overall security\n\nMoreover, again using the “Application and Device Control” component it is possible, it is possible to harden the overall security of the system with a specific policy:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH132337\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH132307\n\nAnyway, this is a general mean of prevention, helpful but not specific for this kind of threats.\n\nIt is always recommended to test the policy accurately before applying it massively to any production environment.\n\n- Lock your system down\n\nSurely effective solution which will protect you from this and other kind of threats, it is to use the Symantec Endpoint Protection feature which is called “System Lockdown”.\n\nIt is based on the idea that an organization uses a determined and pre-allowed set of application which can be collected and allowed by an administrator, blocking the execution of anything else.\n\nThis document contains a guide to this feature:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=HOWTO55130\n\nCAUTION! Anyone who would like to implement this feature is invited to test it deeply! An incorrect deployment of the feature can highly compromise the functionality of the systems in object.\n\n- Granular approach (using Application and Device Control)\n\nWe can implement an application and device control policy to block the execution of the most common file extensions used by this class of threats, in the paths which are known to be the common launch points.\n\nAbout “Application and Device Control” in general:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/security_response/security updates/list.jsp?fid=adc\n\nAttached to this article it is given an example of policy which can be imported in SEP Manager and it is ready to use.\n\nPlease keep in mind: before implementing this policy massively in a production environment, test it on a small grouop of machine, verify its compatibility to your needs. Also feel free to customize it as you may find more appropriate\n\nWhat are the features of our policy?\n\n- Blocking Auto-Run (works out of the box)\n\n- Blocks access to script files (works out of the box)\n\n- Blocks execution from removable drives (the details about the device types should be added. For an example of device ID check: http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?pag...)\n\n- Blocks the execution of files with extension “.exe”, “.com”, “.scr”, “.pif” from the known launch points of those threats and also from some kinds of archives.\n\nHere the complete list:\n\n%appdata%\\\n\n%appdata%\\*\\\n\n%temp%\\\n\n%temp%\\*\\\n\n%temp%\\rar*\\\n\n%temp%\\7z*\\\n\n%temp%\\wz*\\\n\n%temp%\\*.zip\\\n\n%iappdata%\\\n\n%localappdata%\\\n\n%localappdata%\\*\\\n\n%userprofile%\\Local Settings\\Application\\\n\n%userprofile%\\Local Settings\\Application\\*\\\n\nC:\\$Recycle.Bin\\\n\nC:\\$Recycle.Bin\\*\\\n\nPlease Note: This policy is going to block whatever file with the listed extension which is executing from the given locations. This may include also genuine third party applications or custom made applications.\n\nYou can anyway exclude custom application from being blocked adding them in the section “Do not apply to the following processes” located in the condition of the rule.\n\nThere are two most powerful tools from Sysinternals that can help us lot in our search for\n\nsuspected threats on our systems.\n\n1. Autoruns for Windows\n\n2. Procexp\n\nAUTORUNS :\n\nYou can download Autoruns for Windows from\n\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx\n\nRuns on Windows XP and higher and Server 2003 and higher\n\nLogon This entry results in scans of standard autostart locations such as the\n\nStartup folder for the current user and all users, the Run Registry keys, and\n\nstandard application launch locations.\n\nExplorer Select this entry to see Explorer shell extensions, browser helper\n\nobjects, explorer toolbars, active setup executions, and shell execute\n\nhooks.\n\nInternet Explorer This entry shows Browser Helper Objects (BHO's),\n\nInternet Explorer toolbars and extensions.\n\nServices All Windows services configured to start automatically when the\n\nsystem boots.\n\nDrivers This displays all kernel-mode drivers registered on the system\n\nexcept those that are disabled.\n\nScheduled Tasks Task scheduler tasks configured to start at boot or logon.\n\nAppInit DLLs This has Autoruns shows DLLs registered as application\n\ninitialization DLLs.\n\nBoot Execute Native images (as opposed to Windows images) that run\n\nearly during the boot process.\n\nImage Hijacks Image file execution options and command prompt\n\nautostarts.\n\nKnown DLLs This reports the location of DLLs that Windows loads into\n\napplications that reference them.\n\nWinlogon Notifications Shows DLLs that register for Winlogon notification\n\nof logon events.\n\nWinsock Providers Shows registered Winsock protocols, including\n\nWinsock service providers. Malware often installs itself as a Winsock\n\nservice provider because there are few tools that can remove them.\n\nAutoruns can uninstall them, but cannot disable them.\n\nLSA Providers Shows registers Local Security Authority (LSA)\n\nauthentication, notification and security packages.\n\nPrinter Monitor Drivers Displays DLLs that load into the print spooling\n\nservice. Malware has used this support to autostart itself.\n\nSidebar Displays Windows Vista sidebar gadgets\n\nGetting More Information about an Entry\n\nThere are several ways to get more information about an autorun location\n\nor entry. To view a location or entry in Explorer or Regedit chose Jump To\n\nin the Entry menu or double-click on the entry or location's line in the\n\ndisplay. You can view Explorer's file properties dialog for an entry's image\n\nfile by choosing Properties in the Entry menu. You can also have Autoruns\n\nautomatically execute an Internet search in your browser by selecting\n\nSearch Online in the Entry menu.\n\nAutoruns is the best and most reliable (Since it is from Microsoft\n\nSysinternals ) tool for determining whether a file is Legitimate or\n\nSuspicious.\n\nDownload and run Autoruns. Once it is executed it takes few minutes\n\n(sometimes) to scan all the entries on your computer.\n\nOnce this is done on the top click on \"Options\" and select \"Hide Microsoft\n\nand Windows entries\" then click on the refresh button.\n\nNow whatever is left behind is the common load point for any Threat on\n\nyour System.\n\nBrowse through each of the tabs to check if you find anything without a\n\npublisher or with a suspicious Name.\n\nYou will get the location and the registry entry for that file.\n\nThe best part is, If you are not sure about the file just right-click on it and\n\nclick \"Search Online\" and it will try to find some information on that file or\n\nentry. Once you have got any suspicious entries either you just go ahead\n\nand delete it by right-clicking on it or Submit it to Symantec Security\n\nResponse so that they will review the file and get back to you.\n\nIf it is clean you will get a mail that it is clean. If it is a threat you will get a\n\nmail with complete steps on how to get rid of it and what actually it is\n\n(Trojan/Worm/Spyware etc )\n\nTo submit the file to Symantec Security response go to\n\nhttps://submit.symantec.com/retail or /basic or /Essential or /BCS\n\ndepending on your support contract with Symantec.\n\nPROCEXP :\n\nYou can download this tool from\n\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx\n\nIt can be used in Windows XP and higher and Server 2003 and higher\n\nProcess Explorer is an advanced process management utility. You can call\n\nit an advanced version of Task Manager\n\nYou can view detailed information about a process including its icon,\n\ncommand-line, full image path, memory statistics, user account, security\n\nattributes, and more. When you highlight a particular process you can view\n\nthe DLLs it has loaded or the operating system resource handles it has\n\nopen.\n\nWhen we look at the Task Manager we are not able to determine what are\n\nlegitimate files and what are Unknown or threat files. We can also get the\n\nlocation of where the file is located.\n\nThreats mostly load under svchost.exe or rundll32.exe so in the task\n\nmanager it just shows that either svchost or rundll32 is running but when\n\nwe use Procexp we can know which DLL or while file is loading under\n\nthese and the location as well.\n\nIt also has a color coding and a publisher name against each process that\n\nmakes us easier to determine whether it is legitimate or suspicious.\n\nOnce we get the filename we can submit it to\n\nhttps://submit.symantec.com/retail or /basic or /Essential or /BCS\n\ndepending on your support contract with Symantec.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is the sixth of an informal series on how to keep your enterprise environment secure using often-overlooked capabilities of Symantec Endpoint Protection (and the OS upon which it functions).\n\nThe first article, Using SEPM Alerts and Reports to Combat a Malware Outbreak, demonstrated how to use reporting features of SEP 12.1's SONAR component to identify Suspicious files for which there were no AntiVirus signatures yet created.\n\nThe second, Recovering Ransomlocked Files Using Built-In Windows Tools, deals with a few possible ways how to prevent and recover from one of today's most-destructive threats, should it infect your network and hold your data hostage.\n\nThird came Two Reasons why IPS is a \"Must Have\" for your Network, which illustrated how SEP's optional Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) component can help security admins keep their organization secure and track down infected computers on the network\n\nThe Day After: Necessary Steps after a Virus Outbreak is for use after the attacks have ended. This fourth article intends to help admins prevent further attacks and make recovery from any future infection as painless as possible.\n\nKilling Conficker: How to Eradicate W32.Downadup for Good gives admins the techniques they need to eliminate one of their network's most persistent pests: W32.Downadup, also known as the Conficker worm.\n\nThis new \"Symantec Insider Tip\" article aims to provide advice and examples of how to get your suspicious files to the correct team, in the correct format, with all the correct information necessary for speedy processing.\n\nSymantec's Official Article\n\nBy \"submission\" I mean sending questionable files to Symantec's Security Response department for analysis. Please read the following article for the official word on the submissions process.\n\nHow to Use the Web Submission Process to Submit Suspicious Files\n\nArticle URL http://www.symantec.com/docs/TECH102419\n\nTip!\n\nFor files that are suspected of being malicious, your Technical Support Engineer can provide the correct submission URL based on your current contract.\n\nFor files that are you believe to be safe but are being detected, use Symantec's False Positive Submission Site regardless of your contract.\n\nWhat to Submit\n\nSymantec adds protecion against thousands of new threats every day. Definitions are continuously updated in response to submissions received by customers, so please submit:\n\nFiles that are given bad reputations by the SymHelp Threat Analysis Scan with a recommendation to \"submit\" or \"remove\"\n\nFiles that are recommended for submission by Symantec Tech Support, after your SymHelp diagnostics or other logs are examined\n\nFiles which other vendors detect but are not found by Symantec Endpoint Protection or another Symantec security product\n\nFiles which a SEPM's SONAR or IPS reports indicate are responsible for suspicious activity\n\nMalicious files that are engineered to attack Android, Linux, Mac and other non-Windows systems are also submitted through the same web portals. There's no special URL necessary for non-Windows threats.\n\nWhat Not to Submit\n\nIn almost all cases, Security Response needs the undetected malicious executable file which is responsbile for the infection. Submitting any of the following to them will be of little use.\n\nText files, .ini files, .xml files and similar\n\nFiles that have been corrupted or locked by a threat like Trojan.Cryptolocker\n\nPhishing mails (these are not harmful in themselves- if there is a mail with a suspicious attachment, submit that attachment. If the mail has a link to an .exe, download the .exe and submit that)\n\nFiles that have been digitally signed by Microsoft or another major vendor.\n\nFiles that are already detected by SEP or another Symantec security product (.vbn for example)\n\nScreenshots of the malicious file or the damage it has done\n\nOutput from the SymHelp diagnostic tool (send those .sdbz or .sdbd files to Technical Support, not directly to Security Response!)\n\nAny materials related to a new or existing Technical Support case\n\nFor safety reasons, anything submitted to Security Response stays in Security Response. Those files cannot be forwarded on to other departments.\n\nThe web portal system will not be able to process:\n\nFiles larger than 20 MB\n\nCompressed (zipped) files with more than 9 files inside\n\nCompressed (zipped) files which contain more than 20 MB of content\n\nCompressed (zipped) files with a password\n\nCompressed into a format other that ZIP or RAR\n\nAlso:\n\nIf you believe that a detection is a False Positive, please only submit it to https://submit.symantec.com/false_positive/. That's the way to make sure they get to the correct team.\n\nHow to Submit It\n\nWhen filling out the form, you will need to provide your name, company name, email address and Support ID number. You can also enter comments into the Additional File Information field.\n\nTip!\n\nPlease be sure that the email address used for submissions is a Contact Email address associated with your company's account. Otherwise the submission may not be processed as quickly as your contract entitles.\n\nEnsuring Everything is On Track\n\nImmediately after submitting, there will be an acknowledgement screen displayed. A short time later, an email will be dispatched containing the submission's Tracking Number.\n\n[TRACKING]: Symantec Security Response Automation (Tracking #XXXXXXXX)\n\nUse that reference should you need to make contact with any questions. If hours pass without receiving a Tracking Number, please check your junk mail folder or the email processing rules within your company. If there still is no sign of the mail, contact Technical Support to ensure that the submission has in fact been successfully recived and is being queued up for processing. (They can identify the submission using the unique MD5 hash of one of the submitted files or the email address that was specified.)\n\nSubmissions may be processed quickly or it may require several days. This all depends on the current amount of activity in the worldwide threat landscape- something beyond Symantec's control.\n\nWhen analysis is complete, another email will be dispatched which contains an overview of the findings.\n\n[CLOSED]: Symantec Security Response Automation (Tracking #XXXXXXXX)\n\nIf that suspicious file has been confirmed to be malicious, this mail will contain information on how to download new Rapid Release definitions so you can apply protection throughout your organization.\n\nThe final mail sent will supply details, when available, on what file changes, network activity and other nastiness this particular malicious file does.\n\nSymantec Security Response Scribe Automation (Tracking #XXXXXXXX) [BETA]\n\nWhat to do while Submissions are being Processed\n\nIf you have submitted a file that you believe is malicious, don't just wait for Security Response to produce definitions against it! There are important actions that must be taken in order to prevent that infection from spreading its damage throughout your network. See Step 3. Quarantine the Infected Computers in the following article:\n\nBest Practices for Troubleshooting Viruses on a Network\n\nArticle URL http://www.symantec.com/docs/TECH122466\n\nIf you can't just pull the network cable on the infected computer, there are many ways SEP's components can lock down the system and the network and help slow the spread of the threat.\n\nIt's also a good idea to submit the file to threatexpert.com for a quick, automated analysis of the file. That may alert you to (for example) Internet IP addresses or domains that you should be blocking at the corporate firewall, severing communications to the threat's remote Command & Control servers.\n\nHow to submit files to ThreatExpert\n\nArticle URL http://www.symantec.com/docs/TECH96745\n\nFAQ for Y-O-U\n\nQ. Can't I just email the malicious file to Symantec?\n\nA. No, the only method of getting suspicious content to Security Response is via the web portal. Sales, Tech Support and other departments within Symantec cannot receive potentially malicious content.\n\nQ. I thought SEP was automatically making a lot of submissions of files in the background- why don't I get Tracking Numbers for those?\n\nA. When configured to do so, SEP will send anonymous data to Security Response. Symantec Response and the Global Intelligence Network use this submitted information to quickly formulate responses to new and developing security threats. The data that you submit improves Symantec's ability to respond to threats and customize protection. (So, please do always allow submissions!)\n\nAs the information submitted is done so anonymously, there is no way to trace it back and send out a tracking number. The article below has details:\n\nEnabling or disabling client submissions to Symantec Security Response\n\nArticle URL http://www.symantec.com/docs/HOWTO81000\n\nQ. We have found a mountain of malicious files! We've put them all in one giant 500 MB .zip. I can submit that, right?\n\nA. Sorry, no. Think of all the freight deliveries coming into a city. Rather than building a supersized railroad with tracks 100 feet apart and a car big as a cruise ship, all the incoming goods are divided up into a long train of standard-sized freight cars. That's the way the delivery system is designed. The same goes for submissions to Security Response. Each .zip needs to have no more than 9 files within and a decompressed size of 20 MB or else it will go off the tracks.\n\nQ. What if the file I need to submit is larger than 20 MB?\n\nA. Malicious files are generally (but not always!) smaller than that. For large files, check with Tech Support. They can supply instructions on how to proceed.\n\nQ. In my spare time I am building a comprehensive collection of every executable that has ever existed. Wow, there's a heaping cartload, and I'm only up to 1996! Just in case one of them may have been malicious, I'll submit these beauties all at once to Security Response to see if there has ever been a variant of virus, worm, or whatsit that your engineers have never seen.\n\nA. Thanks, but no. Please only submit files that are suspected of being malware involved in a current outbreak on your own network. Our resources are committed to helping combat today's real-world security threats.\n\nQ. I write code for a software company. Is there any way to submit my latest build to Symantec, ahead of its public release, to make sure my customers won't experience False Positives on this new (and initially unknown) version?\n\nA. Yes! This article has all the details:\n\nSoftware developer would like to add his/her software to the Symantec White-List.\n\nArticle URL http://www.symantec.com/docs/TECH132220\n\nConclusion\n\nIf in doubt about whether or not to submit a particular file, please do ask! Tech Support has trained experts who can examine a diagnostic and swiftly spot the suspicious materials within. They can also provide best practice and recommendations that can help keep your network, data and users safe.\n\nMany thanks for reading! Please do leave comments and feedback below."
