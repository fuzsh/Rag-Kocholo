Unstructured Data: Trends and Observations • It’s growing – Over 60% per year (IDC) • It’s spread out – Distributed file servers, the cloud, self service groupware sites • It contains an organization’s intellectual property – Source code, designs, strategy, financials • It’s increasingly targeted by thieves – Hydraq – a small infection, but targeted highest value IP – Malicious insiders – steal IP for financial gain and career advancement – Malicious outsiders – steal product designs for counterfeit Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 2\n\n3. The Challenges Protecting Intellectual Property (IP) • It’s hard to define – The differences between sensitive and non-sensitive data are often subtle • It’s hard to find – It’s intermingled with large volumes of low value data • It’s often very vulnerable – permissions are “loose” – Users create new data repositories and inadvertently grant broad access • Users don’t understand the risk of data leaks – Data security is not their primary mission Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 3\n\n4. Data Loss Prevention 11 – What’s New • Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 simplifies the detection and protection of enterprises’ most valuable information Vector Machine Learning: Reduce the time and expertise required to develop policies to protect unstructured data and IP • Requires less effort and expertise than describing content; requires a smaller sample than fingerprinting Risk Scoring: Identify the most risky data by combining content, usage and access information • Gives business units the information they need to directly address “hot spots” Data Owner Remediation: Identify data owners and notify them that they need to fix their exposed sensitive data • Reduces the time to achieve measurable risk reduction by involving data owners in the clean up effort Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 4\n\n5. Detecting Unstructured Data: The Challenge Today Describe Fingerprint • How do I identify relevant • What if I can’t access all keywords? confidential docs? •How do I avoid false positives? • How do I account for new docs? • How do I tune policies? • How do I protect the endpoint?

Vector Machine Learning: Finds Sensitive Data Learn Describe Fingerprint • Learns by positive and negative examples • Automates keyword identification and enables easier tuning • Improves accuracy, reduces false positives • Detects new content without having to fingerprint it first Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 6 Symantec Proprietary & Confidential - This information is not a commitment, promise or legal obligation to deliver any material, code or functionality\n\n7.

Risk Scoring – Identifies Data at Greatest Risk Find and fix the most risky data • Highlights the most risky folders • Score is based on incident type, severity and folder accessibility • Tells the organization where to focus initial data clean up and lock down efforts Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 8\n\n9.

Data Owner Remediation – Creates Security Awareness Educating data owners is the key to reducing risk Discover data, and track usage with Data Insight • Automatically notifies data owners that their sensitive files are potentially at risk Re-scan Report • Reduces the time to achieve measurable risk reduction by involving data owners in the clean up effort Alert data owners; advise them via email about how to protect their data Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 10\n\n11. Symantec Data Loss Prevention – Products Storage Endpoint Network Symantec™ Data Loss Prevention Symantec™ Symantec™ Network Discover Data Loss Prevention Data Loss Prevention Endpoint Discover Network Monitor Symantec™ Data Loss Prevention Data Insight Symantec™ Symantec™ Symantec™ Data Loss Prevention Data Loss Prevention Data Loss Prevention Endpoint Prevent Network Prevent Network Protect Management Platform Symantec™ Data Loss Prevention Enforce Platform Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 11\n\n12. Data Loss Prevention for Endpoint Enhancements • Flexibility to use a applications and storage devices while protecting sensitive data • Automatically apply encryption or Enterprise Rights Management (ERM) Endpoint Trusted Devices assures that sensitive data can only be copied to approved storage devices Application File Access Control ensures user drive applications such as iTunes, Skype and WebEx cannot access sensitive data FlexResponse can automatically apply encryption or Enterprise Rights Management to sensitive data Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11\n\n13. Summary • Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 simplifies the detection and protection of enterprises’ most valuable information • Vector Machine Learning is unique to Symantec – Streamlines policy implementation, particularly for distributed IP • Risk Scoring prioritizes data at risk – Quickly identifies where to start data clean up efforts • Data Owner Remediation educates users about risk – Reduces the time and effort to achieve risk reduction • Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 is the result of our broad customer experience Symantec Data Loss Prevention 11 13\n\n14.
