The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m., in room 2123, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Cliff Stearns (chairman) presiding. Members present: Representatives Stearns, Shimkus, Shadegg, Pitts, Bono, Issa, Schakowsky, Towns, Davis, Green, and McCarthy. Staff present: Ramsen Betfarhad, policy coordinator and majority counsel; Jill Latham, legislative clerk; Jon Tripp, deputy communications director; David Cavicke, majority counsel; and David Nelson, minority counsel. Mr. Stearns. Good morning. Welcome to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection's hearing on cybersecurity and consumer data. I am pleased that we are joined this morning by a group of distinguished witnesses. And all of us look forward to your testimony. On November 15, 2001, nearly 2 years ago to the day, the subcommittee held a hearing entitled, ``Cybersecurity: Private Sector Efforts Addressing Cyber Threats.'' The focal point of that hearing, as it is with this hearing, was cybersecurity as it related to consumer data used in stream of commerce. We are fortunate that three of our witnesses, Ms. Davidson, Mr. Schmidt, and Mr. Morrow, all of whom testified at the hearing 2 years ago, have joined us today to reflect on what has transpired with regard to cybersecurity in the last 2 years. Normally you don't have people back to give you a little post-analysis. So we are very fortunate to have that.I am confident their insights, along with the testimony of the other witnesses, will be particularly helpful to our better understanding the issue, its evolution, and what we believe is its increasing significance. The subcommittee's hearings 2 years ago was held in the shadow of the tragic events of September 11, when we as a Nation, it seemed, had become obsessed with security. Of course, that was and is understandable. Yet the problem that gave rise to cybersecurity concerns that predated September 11, in just the years 2000 and 2001, as a result of only three cyberattacks--the ``I Love You'' and ``Code Red'' viruses and the February 2000 denial-of-service attacks--the media reported losses in excess of $10 billion. The number of cyberattacks, as reported by the Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT, at the Carnegie Mellon University, was expected to nearly double in 2001 from 2,000 to 40,000. Now, fast forward 2 years. In 2003, the ``SQL Slammer'' worm disrupted computers around the globe. And during the attack, half of all Internet traffic was being lost. The SoBig.F virus clogged e-mail boxes and networks around the world, and became the fastest spreading virus on record, infecting 1 in 17 e-mails at its peak. Showing a bit of humor, the creator of the Blaster worm, which caused some 500,000 computers running Windows to crash, targeted the Microsoft Web site from which users could download the program and the patch to protect their vulnerability with Microsoft Windows code, the very weakness in Windows that the worm itself was exploiting. The virus and worm attacks of 2003 did bring about disruptions, such as the SQL Slammer worm, knocking out Bank of America's ATM machines for a while, but overall they did little reported damage. Although the ultimate objective of the SoBig.F virus is not known, the 2003 vintage of viruses and worms, like most of the ones that preceded them, did not have a malicious or destructive payload. If they did, their impact would have been very, very different. These viruses and worm attacks are external attacks to the networks, and, as such, according to some estimates, only represent 30 percent of computer attacks. The remaining 70 percent of the attacks are carried out from within the corporate firewalls. Those attacks or security breaches taking place within the corporate firewalls, many argue, are the most costly and, of course, the least reported. I raise the issue of virus and worm payload within corporate firewall breaches, because one key question I want answered today is ``What are the real risks and costs to consumers from cybersecurity breaches, and what poses the most risk to cybersecurity?'' One response to breaches in cybersecurity by industry and government alike has been increased spending on security technologies. UBS Warburg estimates that such spending will increase from $6 billion in 2001 to over $13 billion in the year 2003. Meanwhile, other data suggests that companies spend less than just 3 percent of their technology budget on security. The technology budgets tend to be around 3 percent of revenues. So why are these expenditures so low? Some argue because there is no real understanding of quantifiable cost associated with cybersecurity breaches, even among senior managers. Is this true? This is another question for the panel to consider. Finally, many argue that cybersecurity is not just a technological problem and thus can't be solved by adding new and improved technologies defending against cyberattacks, but, rather, they argue that it is as much a governance or management issue as it is a technological problem. Strategic decisions, such as deciding the appropriate balance between cost and risk, are ones that only senior managers can take. And without a clear mandate from the top management, cybersecurity measures will be disregarded as just simply nuisances by rank- and-file employees. Moreover, it appears that there is increased management participation mostly when it is mandated either directly or indirectly by government regulations. For example, the Graham- Leach-Bliley Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or enforcement actions by the Federal Trade Commission. I want to know, are these observations accurate? If so, is there an optimum role for the Federal Government to play when it comes to protecting consumers from cybersecurity threats? With that, I conclude my opening statement and welcome the ranking member for her opening statement. Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for conveying this important hearing today. Cybersecurity is one of those words that have recently entered our lexicon. Most people are probably confused, as I was, the first time they hear or see it in print. There are no doubt several interpretations of the word. It is one of those things like electricity or television signals that we all hope someone else understands enough to assure its availability. Before widespread viruses and ID theft became somewhat of a norm, we were able to take cybersecurity for granted. Of course, it should be safe to operate a home computer or a Palm Pilot. Unfortunately more and more Americans, a disproportionate share in and around Chicago, by the way, have come to a very personal understanding of how vulnerable our information technology, storage, and transmittal systems are. No longer is cybersecurity something over which just government and corporate technicians fret. Life savings now disappear before victims are even aware that there is a threat to the security of their personal and financial information. Highly sensitive personal information is available for sale without the knowledge, much less the consent, of targeted individuals. Americans expect that their government and the private sector institutions they rely upon for financial and other services will protect their privacy, and that those they rely on for cybersecurity will do their job. It is becoming increasingly apparent that consumers are not being adequately protected. Estimates of the economic impact of cybercrimes on society vary widely. One of our witnesses will tell us that identify theft alone totaled $24 billion last year, and is expected to escalate to $73 billion by the end of this year. If he is correct, this means that identity theft will cost Americans more, perhaps much more, than the authorized cost of the war in Iraq. Another witness tells us that 1 in 10 Americans has been victimized by identify theft. Each of these heists is estimated to cost nearly $10,000; clearly this problem is reaching epidemic proportions. Added to the economic cost is the loss of our invaluable privacy. We are all aware of the Orwellian dangers that may flow from personal information that the government can tap, using sophisticated technology. What many of us do not adequately understand is the danger of intrusive prying by private interests. The expropriation of commercially useful data from each and every one of us that accesses the Internet from a computer where personal information is stored is a continuous process. And, of course, there is no reason to believe that firms interested in selling us something are the only ones looking. I look forward to the testimony of the Federal Trade Commission regarding what the Federal Government is doing to control this electronic crime spree. I hope in the future we can also hear from the Justice Department or the agencies that regulate financial institutions, because it is my understanding that much, if not most, of identify theft is perpetrated by employees of banks, insurance companies, and the like. I would have liked to hear directly from those private institutions as well. Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, I am looking forward to hearing from the witnesses you have assembled. I am sure they will be able to give us a sufficiently comprehensive picture of the problems with our cybersecurity systems from which we can fashion whatever policy changes may be necessary to protect the privacy, pocketbook, and safety of our constituents. And, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you, as always, to end this epidemic. I look forward hearing from each of our witnesses, and I thank them for taking time to share their expertise with us today. Mr. Stearns. I thank the gentlelady. The gentlelady from California, Ms. Bono. Mrs. Bono. Good morning, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to hearing from your colleagues and the witnesses on the issue of cybersecurity as it relates to consumers. Cybersecurity and the protection of consumer data is a very real issue that the government, businesses, and consumers alike must acknowledge and respond to. Of course, there are many things that consumers can do to protect themselves. Antivirus software and patches are regularly available for downloading and updating. Moreover, one should always be cautious while downloading software. Consumers should avoid opening e-mails from strangers and should be hesitant to disclose personally identifiable information over nonsecure sites. However, the methods of hacking into computers and data bases are just as evolving as the technologies on which they reside and function. Recently I introduced H.R. 2929, also known as the Safeguards Against Privacy Invasions Act, or the Spy Act. This bill aims to put consumers in the loop. Unfortunately, consumers regularly and unknowingly download software programs that have the ability to track their every move. Consumers are sometimes informed when they download such software. However, the notice is buried deep inside multi- thousand-word documents that are filled with technical terms and legalese that would confuse even a high-tech expert. Many spyware programs are purposefully designed to shut off any antivirus or firewall software program it detects. The Spy Act would help prevent Internet spying by requiring spyware entities to inform computer users of the presence of such software, the nature of spyware, and its intended function. Moreover, before downloading such software, spyware companies would first have to obtain permission from the computer user. This a very basic concept. The PC has become our new town square and global market as well as our private data base. If a consumer downloads software that can monitor the information shared during transactions for the sake of the consumer as well as e-commerce, it is imperative that the consumer be informed of whom he or she is inviting into their computer and what he or she is capable of. After being informed, the consumer should have the chance to decide whether to continue with that download. Since the introduction of H.R. 2929, I have had the opportunity to speak with many different sectors of the technology industry and retail businesses that operate on the Internet. Through these discussions I have received meaningful feedback, and I am currently working on refining H.R. 2929. Once installed on computers, some spyware programs--like viruses embedded among code for other programs--in effect how these programs function on the users computer. Additionally, spyware is becoming more and more difficult to detect and remove. Usually such programs are bundled with another unrelated application that cannot be easily removed, even after the unrelated application has been removed. According to a recent study, many problems with computer performance can be linked in some way to spyware and its applications. Additionally, some computers have several hundred spyware advertizing applications running, which inevitably slow down computers and can cause lockups. If you have spyware on your computer, you most likely are getting more pop-up advertisements than you would have if you have had no such software on your computer. Moreover, the advertisers may not always be forthcoming. Many times spyware entities contract with companies to post advertisements and, in turn, post such advertisements on the Web sites of competitors. The result is confusion. In other words, while visiting the Web site for Company A, you may be browsing to purchase a product. However, while browsing, a pop- up link may appear, informing you of a great sale. Under the impression that you are looking at a link for Company A, you may purchase the product, all the while uninformed that the product was purchased via a pop-up link from Company B. I have often thought that this would be a very effective campaign tool, too, to put out a link and have someone go to my opponent's Web site and my Web site pops up. All of these consumer disadvantages can be decreased or eliminated if disclosures surrounding spyware are required and enforced. If consumers are informed about spyware, chances are they will not choose to download the software. Upon choosing not to download software, consumers' computers will run more efficiently, their antivirus programs and firewalls will function better, they can decide which information to share and not share, and consumers will not be deceived into buying a product or service from unknown entities or voting for our opponents. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses on the issue. Mr. Stearns. I thank the gentlelady. Mr. Green. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and our ranking member for holding this important hearing on cybersecurity and its impact on consumers. The proliferation of Internet-based services and commerce has dramatically changed the world we live in, and many of these changes have been for the better, with consumers able to make almost any purchase imaginable on line. Unfortunately, these computing advances also create a fertile ground for fraudulent activities and thus increase the pressing need for computer security. The problems are coming from all directions. We have viruses, computer worms that are attempting to swarm our networks and are causing terrible harm to computer users and billions in damages to U.S. Businesses. We have unsolicited e- mails taking over our in-boxes, spam that at the very least is an annoyance and at worst is helping to transmit these computer viruses and deliver pornographic e-mails to our children. Mr. Chairman, if I could ask unanimous consent to put in an article from Business Week that was published on August 12 about the unholy matrimony, spam versus virus. Mr. Stearns. By unanimous consent, so ordered. [The article referred to follows:] [Business Week--August 12, 2003] Unholy Matrimony: Spam and Virus By Jane Black Their common goal is subterfuge, and by combining their strategies, they could make today's junk e-mail look like a mere nuisance In June, half of all e-mail was spam--those annoying unsolicited messages that hawk everything from porn and Viagra to mortgage- refinancing deals and weight-loss patches. But if you think spam is out of control, prepare yourself. It could get a lot worse. Over the past few months, e-mail security companies have seen mounting evidence that spammers are using virus-writing techniques to assure that their sales pitches get through. At the same time, intrepid virus writers have latched onto spammers' trusty mass-mailing techniques in an effort to wreak widespread digital mayhem. ``What we're seeing is the convergence of the spammer and the malicious code writer,'' says David Perry, global director of education at antivirus company Trend Micro (TMIC). RELAY STATIONS. Witness the recent spread of a virus known as Webber, which was discovered on July 16. It carried the subject line ``Re: Your credit application.'' Users who opened the attachment downloaded a malicious program that turned a home PC into a so-called open relay server, which allows a third party to send or receive e- mail--including spam--remotely from that PC. Spammers are notorious for using open relays to hide their identities. According to British e-mail security company MessageLabs, 70% of spam comes through open relays. Then there's Sobig.E, a virus that grabs e-mail addresses from several different locations on a PC, including the Windows address book and Internet cache files. Sobig.E then tries to send a copy of itself to each address. It also uses one of the stolen addresses to forge the source of the message, so that it appears to come from someone else. MessageLabs believes Sobig.E is a spammers' virus designed to harvest legitimate e-mail addresses from users' computers. So far, no concrete evidence shows any home PCs that have been infected by either Webber or Sobig.E have been used to send spam. But experts fear that the two viruses could be ``spam zombies,'' programs that will lie in wait on a PC until called on by the spammer to send out millions of untraceable e-mails. ``I LOVE YOU'' MORE. The convergence of spam and malicious code makes sense, says Chris Miller, Symantec's (SMYC ) group product manager for enterprise e-mail security. ``They have a common goal--to do what they're doing without being seen,'' Miller says. Virus writers and spammers send out their messages from illegitimate e-mail accounts, never from the ISPs where they are registered. It isn't hard to see where the union of these two insidious groups' techniques might lead. Using such weapons as Sobig.E and Webber, spammers can hijack a user's address book, then use the PC to send out hundreds, even thousands, of junk messages. And virus writers can use mass-mailing techniques to spread malicious code even faster than before. The destructive ``I Love You'' virus of 2000 was originally sent to a small number of people. Within days it had affected tens of millions of computers and caused damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Imagine if, like spam, it had originally been mailed to a half-million computers. Security experts cite other recent examples of spam-virus convergence: Key-logger Trojans. In May, 2003, a major food-manufacturing company received a spam e-mail that, when viewed in a preview pane in Microsoft Outlook, showed a message that appeared to be an opportunity to sign up for a newsletter. First, though, the message asked the recipient to verify their e-mail log-on ID and password. That information was collected by the key-logger code and then sent to the spammer, who could then log into the user's e-mail at any time and search for valuable information. Drive-by downloads. Recent spam sent to a major airline manufacturer led unsuspecting users to Web pages where spying software was secretly downloaded without the user's knowledge. So-called spyware monitors a user's activity on the Internet and transmits that information to someone else, usually an advertiser or online marketer. Spyware can also gather information about e-mail addresses, passwords, and credit-card numbers. Drive-by downloads can be done without either notifying the user or asking permission because many users accept such a download without question, thinking it's a normal function of the Web site. CALL IT ``MALWARE.'' According to the strictest definitions, key loggers and drive-by downloads aren't viruses, which are programs that replicate themselves. (If you've seen The Matrix Reloaded, think of the way Agent Smith makes infinite copies of himself to try to destroy Keanu Reeves' Neo.) A Trojan is a program that rolls into your computer unannounced, then persuades the computer to launch it through fraud. As spam and malicious code converge, however, such definitions are becoming less useful. That's why experts like Trend Micro's Perry are now looking at a broader term--``malware''--to describe any program with malicious intent. ``With traditional hackers, the motivation has always been to prove that you're a rad dude,'' Perry said in a phone interview from the Las Vegas hacker convention DefCon. ``But when we start seeing these techniques used for commercial gain like spam, it's going to get a whole lot more serious.'' Cybersurfers, beware. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We can all agree that spam is a serious problem that both Congress and the private sector should address quickly, and I hope that Congress will act before the end of the session to enact the Wilson-Green Antispam Act of 2003, which is the strongest antispam bill in Congress. And, Mr. Chairman, again, I would like to ask unanimous consent to place into the record a letter by the Internet Committee of the National Association of Attorney Generals that talks about the Senate bill that passed and the need for strong legislation. Mr. Stearns. By the unanimous consent, so ordered. [The letter follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 90728.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 90728.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 90728.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 90728.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 90728.005 Mr. Green. Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman. When we investigate cybersecurity, however, we must also consider the increasing troubles and problem of identity theft. According to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft is the most common complaint from consumers in all 50 States. With simple personal information such as name, Social Security number, or credit card number, identity thieves can commit fraud or other crimes in our name. The implications for victims of identify theft can't be overexaggerated. They can easily include damaged credit records, unauthorized credit card charges, and bank withdrawals, not to mention the months or even years that it takes for victims to restore their good names and credit records. The magic question remains, how can we prevent these computer-related security problems that seem to be spiraling out of control? With the increased organization, efficiency, and productivity that computer systems offer, it is safe to say that our dependence on computers will continue to rise; therefore, we must ensure that we take the appropriate precautions to ensure that any information stored in or transmitted through computers, be it personal, medical, or financial, is secure. We also need to examine the extent to which the Federal Government and other law enforcement mechanisms can help solve this problem. By some estimates, less than 30 percent of computer attacks come from outside of a company or computer system. That being said, I think we have to work with the private sector to take a hard look at the practices companies are putting in place to combat attacks within their own firewall. I am also interested to hear our witnesses' experience with cybersecurity and learn their opinions on how best we can go about solving these problems. And, again, I would like to thank our panel today, and look forward to their testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Schakowsky. Mr. Stearns. Thank you. Mr. Pitts. Mr. Pitts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for convening this important hearing on cybersecurity. Rapid advances in technology are greatly impacting the lives of every American. Computer software, information systems, and cybernetworks are revolutionizing the way that we communicate, and the way we conduct business and provide services. And while there is a lot of good in the advances, there is also great potential for harm. Technology is a cat-and-mouse game. Each advancement of technology leads to an exploitation that we must vigilantly guard against, and the hearing this morning takes a look at the myriad threats to cybersecurity. One area that I am greatly concerned about is the development of peer-to-peer software. Peer-to-peer software allows individuals to download and trade files, many of which are illegal, with one another. It has also become the latest vehicle that pedophiles use to exploit and abuse innocent children by distributing child pornography. And peer-to-peer software can cause any personal information stored in a computer, such as financial or medical records, to be inadvertently shared with anyone else with the same software. And that is why my colleague Chris John and I introduced H.R. 2885, ``The Protecting Children from Peer to Peer Pornography Act.'' Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your interest in this issue. It is my hope that we can have a hearing in the near future dedicated to taking a closer look at this dangerous new software that threatens our children or a person's privacy and our cybersecurity in general. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stearns. Thank you. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Towns. Mr. Towns. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The Internet will never reach its fullest potential unless consumers feel comfortable and confident while surfing the Web and partaking in e-commerce. How can we ask citizens to put personal information, such as credit cards, PIN numbers, onto the computer if they are worried about issues such as identity theft, spam, or other privacy protections? It seems that every time we turn around there is a new virus harming commerce on the Internet, and the most pressing of these data and privacy abuses is what has come to be known as spyware. Spyware is a particularly dangerous threat to the future of e-commerce and Internet consumer confidence. Many times consumers do not even know what this software-- which can track all movements on a computer, copy keystrokes, and open security holes in networks--is open on their system, much less have the knowledge it takes to get them removed. It should also be noted that many of the peer-to-peer programs suggested Kazaa and Morpheus are funded largely by allowing these spyware companies to piggyback on their network, allowing for corporate entities to gain information about our children and their on-line habits. I am proud upon the lead Democratic sponsor of H.R. 2929, the Safeguard Against Privacy Invasion Act, with my friend from California, Mrs. Bono. This bill will ban these programs from being downloaded from the Internet to unknowing consumers. It is a commonsense approach to privacy protection, and I would like to thank the many members on both sides of the aisle from this committee who have chosen to cosponsor the bill with us, and look forward to working closely with the leadership to ensure its passage through the committee. On that note, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Stearns. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Shimkus. Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will be brief. I always want to take the opportunity to, especially in consumer protection that deals with the Internet and cybersecurity, to continue to mention .kids.us as a place safe for kids, that was passed into law, signed by the President, and now we have groups that are using it: Smithsonian.kids.us, it is safe, no hyperlinks, no chatrooms for kids under the age of 13. And so I use the bully pulpit here to continue to help build interest and movement for people to take use of .kids.us. Other than that, Mr. Chairman, I know we have got a great panel of people testifying. I want to get to that. Thank you for the time. And I yield back. Mr. Stearns. I thank the gentleman. The gentlelady from Missouri. Ms. McCarthy. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for pulling together such a distinguished panel of experts for our work today. I am going to put my remarks in the record so that we can get on learning about the wisdom that is here to be shared. Mr. Stearns. I thank the gentlelady. And the vice chairman of the committee, Mr. Shadegg. Mr. Shadegg. Thank you, too, Mr. Chairman. I too want to thank you for holding this important hearing today and for putting together a tremendous panel for us to learn from. And I do want to mention that both as a member of this subcommittee, and as a member of the Select Homeland Security Committee, I worry deeply about these issues. I have devoted a great deal of time to them, having written in 1998 the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which made identity theft a Federal crime for the first time. We have already heard here this morning the degree to which millions of Americans are victimized by that crime, and that we are losing billions of dollars to it. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, which is now in conference, includes some important provisions to deal with that issue. But there is much more we can do. And I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your holding this hearing, and I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses. Mr. Stearns. I thank my colleague. [Additional statement submitted for the record follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce Mr. Chairman, Thank you for calling this important hearing today. Cyber security is a very serious concern in today's digital world, and as our global economy and all of our lives rely more and more on computers, it will become essential that we ensure that our nation's computers--corporate, government, and personal computers--are safe from the hackers and other malefactors in the digital environment. We've learned in the last few years how much damage viruses and worms, such as ``Sobig.F'' and ``Blaster,'' can do to our computer infrastructure. In fact, the New York Times estimated that the cost of the ``I Love you'' virus alone--which seriously affected this House and this Committee--may have reached as much as $15 Billion. Computers affect almost every aspect of our daily lives. From our computers at home and our personal e-mail accounts, to the daily work of the public and private sectors, the role of computers in our society is so ubiquitous as to go almost unnoticed at times. The security of these systems however cannot go unnoticed. Not only can the e-mail system of the House of Representatives be hindered or disabled, but one shudders to think of the damage that could be done to countless consumers if someone was able to infiltrate one of the many enormous databases in this country and steal the personal information--from credit card numbers to music preferences--of millions of Americans. This kind of theft and misuse of personal data is not yet a widespread problem, but unless we all facilitate and encourage open discussion about how we best combat the bad actors, we will only see these problems grow. Most computer scientists don't say ``if'' when discussing this possibility, they say ``when.'' They believe that a truly debilitating virus will inevitably make its way around the Internet sometime in the relatively near future. Companies must take a preventive approach when looking at solutions to security problems. They must realize that, as the old adage says, ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' We must combat technology with technology. Investment must be made in the security of vital and sensitive systems, in order to ensure the confidence of the American people in the retail, banking, and health care computer systems they depend upon. But simply investing in technology to combat viruses is not enough. In the end, the private sector and the American people must work in concert to best protect the computers and networks we all use. The private sector needs to reevaluate its vulnerabilities as well as its current security priorities. The public needs to be better educated about anti-virus software and personal firewalls for their home computers, as well as the insidious ``SpyWare'' technology that can monitor individuals' computers and their actions on the Internet. I know the gentlelady from California, Ms. Bono, has introduced a bill-- H.R. 2929, ``The Safeguard Against Privacy Invasions Act''--that attempts to deal with this concern, and I look forward to working with her on the bill to try to prevent these intrusions. In the end, Mr. Chairman, it seems that the genie is out of the proverbial bottle, and this problem is not going to go away on its own. It is up to all of us to work together to safeguard our computer infrastructure to prevent the next serious virus from becoming a nationwide, indeed even a worldwide problem. Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Stearns. And with that, we will start with the panel and welcome the Honorable Orson Swindle, the Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission; Mr. Howard Schmidt, Vice President, Chief Information Security Officer of eBay; Mr. Scott Charney, Chief Trustworthy Computing Strategist from Microsoft Corporation; Mr. David Morrow, Managing Principal, Global Security and Privacy Services; Ms. Mary Ann Davidson, Chief Security Officer, Oracle Corporation; Mr. Joseph G. Ansanelli, Chairman and CEO of Vontu, Incorporated; Mr. Daniel Burton, Vice President of Government Affairs, Entrust Technologies; and Mr. Roger Thompson, Vice President of Product Development, PestPatrol, Incorporated. And we will let Commissioner Swindle start. We will go from my right to my left. I welcome you. STATEMENTS OF HON. ORSON SWINDLE, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION; HOWARD A. SCHMIDT, VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER, eBAY INC.; SCOTT CHARNEY, CHIEF TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING STRATEGIST, MICROSOFT CORPORATION; DAVID B. MORROW, MANAGING PRINCIPAL, GLOBAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY SERVICES, EDS; MARY ANN DAVIDSON, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, ORACLE CORPORATION; JOSEPH G. ANSANELLI, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, VONTU, INC.; DANIEL BURTON, VICE PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, ENTRUST TECHNOLOGIES; AND ROGER THOMPSON, VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PESTPATROL, INC. Mr. Swindle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Commission's views on Cybersecurity and Consumer Data: What is at risk for the consumer? At the outset, I believe that it is important that we not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Cybersecurity is a vast issue that faces many threats, and the challenges that the Commission faces in protecting consumers in cyberspace are numerous. The Commission takes action to protect consumers from fraud, whether they are individuals or companies who engage in identity theft, use a pretext to obtain personal information, employ deceptive spam to trick consumers into providing personal and financial information (phishing), misrepresent the sender of spam to misdirect the ``remove me'' request to an innocent third party (spoofing), or exploit computer system vulnerabilities in order to extort money from consumers (D- Square Solutions). Consumers are also placed at risk by their own conduct, such as through peer-to-peer file-sharing or failing to use firewalls and antivirus software. While there are many challenges to cybersecurity, I will focus my remarks on companies who obtain and control consumer information. The Commission addresses information security concerns through aggressive law enforcement actions, consumer and business education, and international cooperation. Through these efforts we strive to enhance the security of information systems and networks and bring attention to the fact that all users of information technology, that is, government, industry, and the general public, must play a role in this effort. If companies fail to keep their express and implied promises to protect sensitive information obtained from consumers, then those promises are deceptive. The Commission has brought enforcement actions against such companies for violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive practices. Three of these Commission cases illustrate some important principles. The case against Eli Lilly demonstrates that a company's security procedures must be appropriate for the kind of information it collects and maintains. Despite promises to maintain security of sensitive information, Eli Lilly inadvertently disclosed the names of consumers who used a prescription drug. Our case against Microsoft illustrates that there can be law violations without a known or actual breach of security. Microsoft promised consumers that it would maintain a high level of security for its Passport and Passport Wallet system of accounts. Even though there was no actual security breach, after reviewing Microsoft's systems, the Commission alleged that Microsoft failed to take reasonably appropriate measures to maintain the security of consumers' personal information. The case against Guess, Inc. illustrates that good security depends upon an ongoing process of risk assessment, identifying vulnerabilities, and taking reasonable steps to minimize or eliminate those risks. We alleged that Guess stored consumers' information, including credit card numbers, in clear unencrypted text, despite claims to the contrary. Unencrypted information is vulnerable to attackers, something that is well known in the industry and can be corrected. The Commission's settlements in these three cases require the companies to implement comprehensive information security programs. In addition, Microsoft and Guess must obtain an independent security audit every 2 years. The Commission has engaged in a broad and continuing awareness and outreach campaign to educate businesses, consumers, and political leaders about the importance of cybersecurity. We work closely with industry, government agencies, and consumer groups to expand awareness. This is the single most essential element in creating a culture of security that is increasingly necessary for the protection of our critical infrastructure. We have a first-class Web site focusing on safe computing practices. Our site provides a wealth of information on cybersecurity and how each of us can and must contribute to the effort. Our Web site registered more than 400,000 visits in the first year of deployment, making it one of the most popular FTC Web pages. And, a Google search recently indicates that 445 other Web sites link to our security site. Every House and Senate office has a copy of our safe computing disk. And I might add, I will hold this up, and I think there is a package on your desk with a lot of our information security material in the package. This CD disk was designed to assist each Member of Congress and staff in educating constituents on safe computing practices. Several Members of Congress have constructed excellent information security pages on their Web sites using information from the FTC. Each Member is an outstanding leader within his or her community and district. As the FTC's authorizing body and as the leaders in consumer protection, this committee in particular can partner with us effectively in our consumer awareness efforts on information security. Our staff and I personally are standing by to help you and join with you in leading. In addition to law enforcement and our awareness campaign, the Commission has taken an active leadership role in international efforts promoting cybersecurity. In 2002, the FTC led the U.S. Delegation, working with the OECD, to revise its security guidelines. The revised guidelines serve as an excellent, common sense starting point for government, business, and organizations to implement information security. They address accountability, awareness, and action by all participants and form the basis for international cooperation toward establishing a culture of security. The guidelines have been embraced by the United Nations, APEC, nongovernment organizations, and many international businesses and associations. In conclusion, attaining adequate information security will be a continuing journey; a long project, where complacency is not an option. I look forward to responding to your questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Hon. Orson Swindle follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Orson Swindel, Commissioner, Federal Trade Commission i. introduction Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, I am Commissioner Orson Swindle.1 I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the Federal Trade Commission's role in protecting information security and its importance to both consumers and businesses. Today, maintaining the security of our computer-driven information systems is essential to every aspect of our lives. A secure information infrastructure is required for the operation of everything from our traffic lights to our credit and financial systems, including our nuclear and electrical power supplies, and our emergency medical service. We are all, therefore, directly or indirectly linked together by this infrastructure. Consumers rely on and use computers at work and at home; increasingly, more consumers are making purchases over the Internet and paying bills and banking online. These interconnected information systems provide enormous benefits to consumers, businesses, and government alike. At the same time, however, these systems can create serious vulnerabilities that threaten the security of the information stored and maintained in these systems as well as the continued viability of the systems themselves. Every day, security breaches cause real and tangible harms to businesses, other institutions, and consumers.2 These breaches and the harm they do shake consumer confidence in the companies and systems to which they have entrusted their personal information. ii. the federal trade commission's role The Federal Trade Commission has a broad mandate to protect consumers and the Commission's approach to information security is similar to the approaches taken in our other consumer protection efforts. As such, the Commission has sought to address concerns about the security of our nation's computer systems through a combined approach that stresses the education of businesses, consumers, and government agencies about the fundamental importance of good security practices; law enforcement actions; and international cooperation. Our program encompasses efforts to ensure the security of computer networks, an understanding that we all have a role to play, as well as efforts to ensure that companies keep the promises they make to consumers about information security and privacy. In the information security matters, our enforcement tools derive from Section 5 of the FTC Act,3 which prohibits unfair or deception acts or practices, and the Commission's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Safeguard Rule (``Safeguards Rule'' or ``Rule'').4 Our educational efforts include business education to promote compliance with the law, consumer and business education to help promote a ``Culture of Security,'' international collaboration, public workshops to highlight emerging issues, and outreach to political leaders. A. Section 5 The basic consumer protection statute enforced by the Commission is Section 5 of the FTC Act, which provides that ``unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce are declared unlawful.'' 5 The statute defines ``unfair'' practices as those that ``cause[] or [are] likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.'' 6 To date, the Commission's security cases have been based on deception,7 which the Commission and the courts have defined as a material representation or omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.8 The companies that have been subject to enforcement actions have made explicit or implicit promises that they would take appropriate steps to protect sensitive information obtained from consumers. Their security measures, however, proved to be inadequate; their promises, therefore, deceptive. Through the information security enforcement actions, the Commission has come to recognize several principles that govern any information security program. 1. Security procedures should be appropriate under the circumstances First, a company's security procedures must be appropriate for the kind of information it collects and maintains. Different levels of sensitivity may dictate different types of security measures. It is highly problematic when a company inadvertently releases sensitive personal information due to inadequate security procedures. The Commission's first information security case, Eli Lilly,9 involved an alleged inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information despite the company's promises to maintain the security of that information. Specifically, Lilly put consumers' e-mail addresses in the ``To'' line of the e-mail that was sent to Prozac users who subscribed to a service on Lilly's website, essentially disclosing the identities of all of the Prozac user-subscribers. Given the sensitivity of the information involved, this disclosure was a serious breach. Nevertheless, the Commission recognized that there is no such thing as ``perfect'' security and that breaches can occur even when a company has taken all reasonable precautions. Therefore, the Commission construed statements in Lilly's privacy policy as a promise to take steps ``appropriate under the circumstances'' to protect personal information. Similarly, the complaint alleged that the breach resulted from Lilly's ``failure to maintain or implement internal measures appropriate under the circumstances to protect sensitive consumer information.'' 10 The focus was on the reasonableness of the company's efforts. According to the complaint in the Lilly matter, the company failed, among other things, to provide appropriate training and oversight for the employee who sent the e-mail and to implement appropriate checks on the process of using sensitive customer data. The order contains strong relief that should provide significant protections for consumers, as well as ``instructions'' to companies. First, it prohibits the misrepresentations about the use of, and protection for, personal information. Second, it requires Lilly to implement a comprehensive information security program similar to the program required under the FTC's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Safeguards Rule, which is discussed below. Finally, to provide additional assurances that the information security program complies with the consent order, every year the company must have its program reviewed by a qualified person to ensure compliance. 2. Not All Security Breaches Are Violations of FTC Law The second principle that arises from the Commission's enforcement in the information security area is that not all breaches of information security are violations of FTC law--the Commission is not simply saying ``gotcha'' for security breaches. Although a breach may indicate a problem with a company's security, breaches can happen, as noted above, even when a company has taken every reasonable precaution. In such instances, the breach will not violate the laws that the FTC enforces. Instead, the Commission recognizes that security is an ongoing process of using reasonable and appropriate measures in light of the circumstances. When breaches occur, our staff reviews available information to determine whether the incident warrants further examination. If it does, the staff gathers information to enable us to assess the reasonableness of the company's procedures in light of the circumstances surrounding the breach. This allows the Commission to determine whether the breach resulted from the failure to have procedures in place that are reasonable in light of the sensitivity of the information. In many instances, we have concluded that FTC action is not warranted. When we find a failure to implement reasonable procedures, however, we act. 3. Law Violations Without a Known Breach of Security The Commission's case against Microsoft 11 illustrates a third principle--that there can be law violations without a known breach of security. Because appropriate information security practices are necessary to protect consumers' privacy, companies cannot simply wait for a breach to occur before they take action. Particularly when explicit promises are made, companies have a legal obligation to take reasonable steps to guard against reasonably anticipated vulnerabilities. Like Eli Lilly, Microsoft promised consumers that it would keep their information secure. Unlike Lilly, there was no specific security breach that triggered action by the Commission. The Commission's complaint alleged that there were significant security problems that, left uncorrected, could jeopardize the privacy of millions of consumers. In particular, the complaint alleged that Microsoft did not employ ``sufficient measures reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances to maintain and protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal information obtained through Passport and Passport Wallet.'' 12 The complaint further alleged that Microsoft failed to have systems in place to prevent unauthorized access; detect unauthorized access; monitor for potential vulnerabilities; and record and retain systems information sufficient to perform security audits and investigations. Again, sensitive information was at issue-- financial information including credit card numbers. Like the Commission's order against Eli Lilly, the Microsoft order prohibits any misrepresentations about the use of, and protection for, personal information and requires Microsoft to implement a comprehensive information security program. In addition, Microsoft must have an independent professional certify, every two years, that the company's information security program meets or exceeds the standards in the order and is operating effectively. 4. Good Security is an Ongoing Process of Assessing Risks and Vulnerabilities The Commission's third case, against Guess, Inc.,13 highlighted a fourth principle--that good security is an ongoing process of assessing and addressing risks and vulnerabilities. The risks companies and consumers confront change over time. Hackers and thieves will adapt to whatever measures are in place, and new technologies likely will have new vulnerabilities waiting to be discovered. As a result, companies need to assess the risks they face on an ongoing basis and make adjustments to reduce these risks. The Guess case highlighted this crucial aspect of information security in the context of web-based applications and the databases associated with them. Databases frequently house sensitive data such as credit card numbers, and Web-based applications are often the ``front door'' to these databases. It is critical that online companies take reasonable steps to secure these aspects of their systems, especially when they have made promises about the security they provide for consumer information. In Guess, the Commission alleged that the company broke such a promise concerning sensitive information collected through its website, www.guess.com. According to the Commission's complaint, by conducting a ``web-based application'' attack on the Guess website, an attacker gained access to a database containing 191,000 credit card numbers. This particular type of attack was well known in the industry and appeared on a variety of lists of known vulnerabilities. The complaint alleged that, despite specific claims that it provided security for the information collected from consumers through its website, Guess did not: employ commonly known, relatively low-cost methods to block web- application attacks; adopt policies and procedures to identify these and other vulnerabilities; or test its website and databases for known application vulnerabilities, which would have disclosed that the website and associated databases were at risk of attack. Essentially, the Commission alleged that the company had no system in place to test for known application vulnerabilities or to detect or to block attacks once they occurred. In addition, the complaint alleged that Guess misrepresented that the personal information it obtained from consumers through www.guess.com was stored in an unreadable, encrypted format at all times; but, in fact, after launching the attack, the attacker could read the personal information, including credit card numbers, stored on www.guess.com in clear, unencrypted text. As in its prior security cases, the Commission's emphasis in Guess was on reasonableness. When the information is sensitive, the vulnerabilities well known, and the fixes inexpensive and relatively easy to implement, it is unreasonable simply to ignore the problem. As in the prior orders, the Commission's order against Guess prohibits the misrepresentations, requires Guess to implement a comprehensive information security program, and, like Microsoft, requires an independent audit every two years. B. GLB Safeguards Rule In addition to our enforcement authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, the Commission also has responsibility for enforcing its Gramm- Leach-Bliley Safeguards Rule, which requires financial institutions under the FTC's jurisdiction to develop and implement appropriate physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to protect customer information.14 The Rule became effective on May 23 of this year, and the Commission expects that it will quickly become an important enforcement and guidance tool to ensure greater security for consumers' sensitive financial information. The Safeguards Rule requires a wide variety of financial institutions to implement comprehensive protections for customer information--many of them for the first time. If fully implemented by companies, as required, the Rule could go a long way to reduce risks to this information, including identity theft. The Safeguards Rule requires financial institutions to develop a written information security plan that describes their program to protect customer information. Due to the wide variety of entities covered, the Rule requires a plan that accounts for each entity's particular circumstances--its size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of the customer information it handles. As part of its plan, each financial institution must: (1) designate one or more employees to coordinate the safeguards; (2) identify and assess the risks to customer information in each relevant area of the company's operation, and evaluate the effectiveness of the current safeguards for controlling these risks; (3) design and implement a safeguards program, and regularly monitor and test it; (4) hire appropriate service providers and contract with them to implement safeguards; and (5) evaluate and adjust the program in light of relevant circumstances, including changes in the firm's business arrangements or operations, or the results of testing and monitoring of safeguards. The Safeguards Rule requires businesses to consider all areas of their operation, but identifies three areas that are particularly important to information security: employee management and training; information systems; and management of system failures. Prior to the Rule's effective date, the Commission issued guidance to businesses covered by the Safeguards Rule to help them understand the Rule's requirements.15 Commission staff also met, and continues to meet, with a variety of trade associations and companies to alert them to the Rule's requirements and to gain a better understanding of how the Rule is affecting particular industry segments. Now that the Rule is effective, the Commission is investigating compliance by covered entities. C. Education and workshops In addition to our law enforcement efforts and conducting outreach under the Commission's Safeguard's Rule, the Commission has engaged in a broad educational campaign to educate businesses and consumers about the importance of information security and the precautions they can take to protect or minimize risks to personal information. These efforts have included creation of an information security ``mascot,'' Dewie the e-Turtle, who hosts a portion of the FTC website devoted to educating businesses and consumers about security,16 publication of business guidance regarding common vulnerabilities in computer systems,17 speeches by Commissioners and staff about the importance of this issue, and outreach to the international community. Many offices in the Commission including the Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, the Office of Public Affairs, and the Office of Congressional Relations, have participated in this effort to educate consumers and businesses. The Commission's outreach effort is centered on the Commission's information security website.18 The website registered more than 400,000 visits in its first year of deployment, making it one of the most popular FTC web pages. The site is now available in CD-ROM and PDF format and frequently updated with new information for consumers on cybersecurity issues. In addition, the Commission's Office of Consumer and Business Education has produced a video news release, which has been seen by an estimated 1.5 million consumers; distributed 160,000 postcards featuring Dewie and his information security message to approximately 400 college campuses nationwide; and coordinated the 2003 National Consumer Protection Week with a consortium of public- and private-sector organizations around the theme of information security. Finally, the Commission's Office of Congressional Relations has conducted outreach through constituent service representatives in each of the 535 House and Senate member offices by mailing ``Safe Computing'' CDs. We would like to thank Chairman Stearns for his leadership on the issue of cybersecurity, and for encouraging his colleagues, in his July 18, 2003 ``Dear Colleague'' letter announcing the delivery of the FTC's safe Internet practices outreach kit, to educate their constituents on safe computing practices. In addition, the Commission uses opportunities that arise in non- security cases to educate the public about security issues. For example, in early November, the Commission announced that a district court issued a temporary restraining order in an action against D Squared Solutions, and its principals.19 The complaint alleged that the defendants operated a scam that barraged consumers' computers with repeated Windows Messenger Service pop up ads--most of which advertised software that consumers could purchase for about $25 to block future pop ups. Part of what made the defendants' conduct so egregious is that consumers continued to be bombarded by pop-ups, even when they were off of the Internet and working in other applications such as word-processing or spreadsheet programs and that the defendants allegedly either sold or licensed their pop-up sending-software to other people allowing them to engage in the conduct. The defendants' website allegedly offered software that would allow buyers to send pop- ups to 135,000 Internet addresses per hour, along with a database of more than two billion unique addresses. Contrary to the defendants' representations, consumers, when educated about how the Windows operating systems works, can actually stop pop-up spam at no cost by changing the Windows default system. In addition to bringing a law enforcement action to halt the defendants' conduct, the Commission issued an alert to consumers about the security issues raised in the case. The ``Consumer Alert'' provides instructions for consumers on how to disable the Windows Messenger Service in order to avoid other pop-up spam. The alert 20 also discusses the use of firewalls to block hackers from accessing consumers' computers. Finally, the Commission continues, and will continue, to host workshops on information security issues when appropriate. Last summer, the Commission hosted two workshops focusing on the role technology plays in protecting personal information.21 The first workshop focused on the technologies available to consumers to protect themselves. Panelists generally agreed that, to succeed in the marketplace, these technologies must be easy to use and built into the basic hardware and software consumers purchase. The second workshop focused on the technologies available to businesses. We learned that businesses, like consumers, need technology that is easy to use and compatible with their other systems. Unfortunately, we also heard that too many technologies are sold before undergoing adequate testing and quality control, frustrating progress in this area. The Commission also held a workshop on unsolicited commercial e- mail (``spam'') which was instructive about the security risks that spam poses. We learned that, in addition to other problems, spam can also serve as a vehicle for malicious and damaging code. D. International Efforts In addition to our cases and domestic efforts, the Commission has taken an active international role in promoting cybersecurity. We recognize that American society and societies around the world need to think about security in a new way. The Internet and associated technology have literally made us a global community. We are joining with our neighbors in the global community in this enormous effort to educate and establish a culture of security. During the summer of 2002, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (``OECD'') issued a set of principles for establishing a culture of security--principles that can assist us all in minimizing our vulnerabilities. Commissioner Swindle has had the opportunity to work with this organization and to head the U.S. Delegation to the Experts Group on the post-September 11 review of existing OECD Security Guidelines and to the Working Party on Information Security and Privacy. The OECD principles are contained in a document entitled ``Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security.'' 22 The nine principles are an excellent, common-sense starting point for formulating a workable approach to security. They address awareness, accountability, and action. They also reflect the principles that guide the FTC in its analysis of security-related cases, including that security architecture and procedures should be appropriate for the kind of information collected and maintained and that good security is an ongoing process of assessing and addressing risks and vulnerabilities. These principles can be incorporated at all levels of use among consumers, government policy makers, and industry. They already have been the model for more sector-specific guidance by industry groups and associations. Besides the OECD, the Commission also is involved in information privacy and cybersecurity work undertaken by the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (``APEC'') forum. APEC's Council of Ministers endorsed the OECD Security Guidelines in 2002. Promoting information system and network security is one of its chief priorities. The APEC Electronic Commerce Steering Group (``ECSG'') promotes awareness and responsibility for cybersecurity among small and medium-sized businesses that interact with consumers. Commission staff participated in APEC workshop and business education efforts this past year and is actively engaged in this work for the foreseeable future. Along with the OECD and APEC, in December 2002, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity. Other UN groups, international organizations, and bilateral groups with whom the Commission has dialogues, including the TransAtlantic Business and Consumer Dialogues, the Global Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce, and bilateral governmental partners in Asia and in the EU also are working on cybersecurity initiatives. Notwithstanding these global efforts, developing a ``Culture of Security'' is a daunting challenge. The FTC and other government agencies have a role to play, but the government cannot do this alone, nor should it try. The Commission is working with consumer groups, business, trade associations, and educators to instill this new way of thinking. We are encouraging our global partners to do the same and to share what is learned. iii. conclusion The Commission, through law enforcement and consumer and business education, is committed to reducing the harm that occurs through information security breaches. Maintaining good security practices is a critical step in preventing these breaches and the resulting harms, which can range from major nuisance to major destruction. The critical lesson in this information-based economy is that we are all in this together: government, private industry, and consumers, and we must all take appropriate steps to create a culture of security. ENDNOTES 1 The views expressed in this statement represent the views of the Commission. My oral presentation and responses to questions are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Commission or any other Commissioner. 2 For example, our recently released Identity Theft Report, available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/09/synovatereport.pdf, showed that over 27 million individuals have been victims of identity theft, which may have occurred either offline or online, in the last five years, including almost 10 million individuals in the last year alone. The survey also showed that the average loss to businesses was $4800 per victim. Although various laws limit consumers' liability for identity theft, their average loss was still $500--and much higher in certain circumstances. 3 15 U.S.C. 45. 4 16 C.F.R.

Chairman Stearns, distinguished members of the committee, my name is Howard Schmidt. I am the Vice President and Chief of Information Security for eBay, where I lead a team responsible for ensuring the trustworthiness and security of the services that bring so many global citizens together each day in this tremendous global marketplace. I would like to thank you again for the opportunity to come before the committee for the second time and your continued leadership in this very important issue. Prior to arriving at eBay a few months ago, I had the privilege of being appointed by President Bush to lead, with Richard Clarke, the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, which represented one part of the overall government response to the threat of cybersecurity attacks in the wake of September 11; and after 31 years retired, and we successfully published the National Strategy Defense for Cyberspace, working with a team of dedicated public servants, this body, and the American public. In addition to my day job, I continue to proudly serve at the U.S. Army Reserves, assigned to the 701st MP Group as a Special Agent with the computer crimes section, and also serve on the board of directors for ISC Squared, the body that oversees certification for security professionals through the CISSB certification. My remarks today will focus primarily on the changes that have taken place with both business and government to create the level of information-sharing and collaboration necessary to improve cybersecurity and to further improve security for consumers, as well as how the sharing and collaboration has indeed improved the level of information and protection of consumer data. I would like to provide my update in specific examples of improvement in four major areas. Those areas are awareness and education, product enhancement, government activities and private sector initiatives. While these examples will not be comprehensive, they will indeed be some representative efforts we have undergone. I would also state, even though my comments are very optimistic as where we have come from, I think we will also have a long way to go. I think under the block of awareness and education, one of the biggest visible changes that has taken place is the increase in dialog and training to better inform the end user and consumer on how to secure their computer systems and their information. One of the first consumer-targeted awareness programs was truly a joint public/private partnership between many of the companies, the FTC, NSA, as well as some other government agencies, and it took place in the formation of the Cybersecurity Alliance, and the creation of our Web site, staysafeonline.info, which we drove out of the efforts of the White House. This Web site has a wealth of information to help even the most inexperienced users understand cybersecurity, potential threats from on-line criminals, and steps they can take to protect themselves. In addition, we at the White House held a series of town hall meetings over the past 18 months to meet with private sector partners, individuals, parent-teacher organizations, with speakers ranging from CEOs of major financial institutions, to my distinguished colleague to my left, Commissioner Orson Swindle. Many of these town meetings were also Webcast to get the broadest audience to be able to see them and participate over the Internet. Private sector companies have also held free seminars around the country, providing awareness to citizens. Many of these sessions focused on informing the elderly, one of the segments of our society who has received great benefits in the on-line world and the resources that it can provide. Also, as we enter the holiday season, there will be mass media campaigns to educate consumers further on how to safely and securely enjoy the richness and robustness of the on-line e-commerce world. Under product enhancements, another major improvement we have seen over the past 2 years has been the way security is now offered as a standard within software and hardware. One very visible example is with the hardware provided to use wireless technology and broadband, we now see firewalls being built directly into these components as well as antivirus software being built into wireless modem operations. Major operating systems have now auto update features as antivirus functions. Many antivirus vendors have done an amazing job in speeding up the detection and analysis of many of the threats that you have mentioned in your opening comments of the viruses and trojans that are found in the wire. Many of them even provide free on-line services for consumers to be able to download and inspect their systems as a public service, and I noticed in the paper this morning, one of them is now offering free antivirus software for the next year. Under the heading of government activities, there have been a number of great activities beyond the creation of the National Strategy to Defend Cyberspace. Recently the Department of Homeland Security created the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon as a focal point for building partnerships based on cybersecurity response networks and providing a notification network of threats and vulnerabilities as they are discovered. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Secret Service, and the FBI have significantly improved the response times and increased priorities around the investigation of cybercrimes. As a matter of fact, Director Mueller has placed cybercrime as one of the top five priorities within the FBI, and the Secret Service is growing a cadre of expert agents working with private sector called the Electronic Crime Task Force. Additionally, the Department of Defense continues to work in that area as well. On the government effort, since these things have no borders, the State Department has done a wonderful job in creating multilateral and bilateral discussions with international partners, many of which the industry colleagues, some of us sitting here today, have been a part of since the very beginning. Two quick examples in the private sector initiatives: We know that there will be no silver bullets in enhancing cybersecurity, but recently we created a coalition to address specifically the area of on-line identity theft. We have fully recognized that the vast majority of identity theft occurs in the off-line world through dumpster diving and other mechanisms, but we have seen, as many of you have, an increase in criminals attempting to do the same thing on line. The two recent methods are what we call phishing, with a p- h, or spoofed e-mails, where criminals send out thousands of e- mails telling people to update their information. We are working to address this in four areas: building new technologies to prevent this; second, to provide awareness and training to consumers so they are better informed to not fall victim to these scams; third, to share information amongst very competitive companies on protection of these things; and fourth, to work with the law enforcement community to prevent these people through deterrence of investigation. In closing, I want to cite three specific areas I think that we can look at because, despite the great security enhancements we have seen and will continue to see, there are clear challenges you must address. We must review our commitment to enhance consumer awareness of basic cybersecurity practices, and the recent attacks have once again demonstrated how home users are now becoming the target. Second, while we build an effective response network, we must not lose sight of the innovation frontier. Technologists on the horizon hold the potential to dramatically and potentially decisively transform our cybersecurity challenges. Self-healing computers, embedded technologies, can enable devices that recognize and defend against these attacks. We must not inhibit their ability to move forward in collaboration with our best universities. And, finally, we must recognize that cybersecurity is no longer merely about product services and strategies. What is at stake in the effective implementation of advanced cybersecurity technology is nothing less than the ability to unleash the next wave of IT-led growth in jobs and productivity. Cybersecurity is an essential enabler. In closing, I want to say that the next step of this will be on December 2 and 3. Homeland Security has invited a lot of the public service or private sector organizations to create a summit, creating a task force to move forward in a lot of those areas that we mentioned and we care very deeply about. This concludes my prepared remarks and I thank you for the opportunity to be here. [The prepared statement of Howard A. Schmidt follows:] Prepared Statement of Howard A. Schmidt, Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer, eBay Corporation introduction Chairman Stearns, distinguished members of the Committee, my name is Howard A. Schmidt. I am the Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer for eBay, where I lead a team responsible for ensuring the trustworthiness and security of the services that bring so many global citizens together in this tremendous global marketplace each day. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to come before this Committee again as well as your continued leadership on this very important issue. Prior to my current position at eBay and subsequent to my last appearance, I had the privilege of being appointed by President Bush to lead, with Richard Clarke, the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, which represented one part of the overall governmental response to the threat of cyber security attacks in the wake of September 11. I retired from 31 years of public service after completing and publishing the ``National Strategy to Defend Cyberspace,'' working with a team of dedicated public servants, this body, and the American public. I have had the privilege of working with committed individuals in the private sector, law enforcement, and government to forge the collaboration and cooperation that is so essential to safeguard cyber space for everyone, from inexperienced home users to large well-run corporate enterprises. I assisted in the formation of some of the first collaborative efforts in the law enforcement community to address cyber crime in local law enforcement and the FBI. I also helped lead the creation of the Information Technology Information Sharing and Analysis Center (IT-ISAC) and had the honor of serving as its first president. I continue to proudly serve in the U.S. Army reserves, assigned to the 701st MP Group, (CID) as a Special Agent with the computer crime unit at CID headquarters. I also serve on the Board of Directors for ISC2, the body that oversees certification of security professionals through the CISSP certification. My remarks today will focus primarily on the changes that have taken place within both business and government to create the level of information sharing and collaboration necessary to improve Cybersecurity and further improve security for consumers, as well as how this sharing and collaboration has improved the level of information and protection of consumer computer data. Today, the Internet connects over 170 million computers and an estimated 680 million users, with an estimated growth to 904 million by the end of 2004. From major data operations conducting large-scale financial transactions, to wireless devices keeping families connected, the Internet touches virtually all aspects of our economy and quality of life. eBay is a prime example of how deeply ingrained the Internet is in American life. Every day on eBay, millions of Americans, along with millions of people in countries around the world, come together to buy and sell all types of goods and services. Business relationships and, often, deep friendships are formed on the basis of commerce and shared interests. The eBay marketplace reflects the enormous power of the Internet to unite humanity at a crucial moment in history. More pointedly, the Internet has become a fundamental component of business processes--enhancing productivity by speeding connectivity between remote locations or across functional operations. The Internet is deeply ingrained in managing power, producing chemicals, designing and manufacturing cars, managing money and delivering government services ranging from human services to environmental permitting. The flip side of these productivity-enhancing applications is an increase in attacks against the online community. Today the Internet is utilized by hundreds of millions of users all across the globe sending information ranging from homework assignments and simple greetings to the most sensitive financial and operational data of government and industry, all at the speed of light. The Internet landscape also includes a private sector security industry that has grown to an estimated $17 billion per year in goods and services. And, as we are all painfully aware, attack speeds today are measured in seconds, not days. I would like to provide my update in the format specific examples of improvement in four major areas. Those areas are: Awareness and education; product enhancements; government activities; and private sector initiatives. While we have made significant progress, I also want to stress that we still have much work to do and will continue to improve overall Cybersecurity by continued improvement in some of the examples I will mention today. Awareness & Education: One of the biggest visible changes that has taken place is increased dialogue and training to better inform the end user on how to secure their computers and information. One of the first consumer- targeted awareness programs was truly a joint private-public partnership. This partnership took place in the form of the Cyber Security Alliance. The alliance combined the expertise of a number of private sector entities with the efforts of government partners to create a comprehensive website for consumers. The website, www.staysafeonline.info has a wealth of information to help even the most inexperienced users understand cyber security, potential threats from online criminals, and steps they can take to protect themselves. In addition, the White House held a series of town hall meetings around the country with private sector partners. These town hall meetings were open to the public and well-attended, with speakers ranging from CEOs of major financial institutions and exchanges, to subject-matter experts in cyber security. Many of these town hall meetings were webcast so those that could not attend in person could participate over the Internet. Private sector companies have also held free seminars around the country to provide awareness to citizens. Many of the sessions focused on informing the elderly, one of the segments of our society that has received great benefit from the online world and the resources that it provides. As we enter the holiday shopping season, there will be mass media campaigns to educate consumers on how to safely and securely enjoy the richness and robustness of the online e-commerce world. In the category of formal education, the National Security Agency (NSA) has a program identifying universities that meet the criteria to be designated a center of academic excellence in information security. This NSA program not only ensures the education of the next generation of information security professionals, but also guarantees that the university has sound cyber security practices in place as well as awareness education for the students, who make up a large number of the online users and consumers. The NSA also administers the Cyber Corp program with NSF and OPM, providing scholarships for students in cyber security. Product Enhancements: Another major improvement that we have seen in the past two years is the way security enhancements are now offered standard in software and hardware. One very visible example is the hardware provided to use wireless technology. Broadband technology (Cable modem, DSL, satellites etc.) has given us capabilities and speeds that were only available to corporations before. We now see firewalls and the ability to download anti-virus software being built into wireless modems. The major operating systems now have auto-update features included, and are now being turned on by default in more future versions. Products are now being shipped with many services turned off by default, thus making them more secure. Many of the online email services block potentially malicious code and do a much better job of blocking the Spam that often contains malicious functions. Anti-virus vendors have done an amazing job in speeding up the detection, analysis and updates for many of the viruses that are found in the wild. Many of them even provide free online virus scans as a public service to assist consumers. Government Activities: There have been a number of government actions that have taken place since I last appeared before this committee--most notably the creation of the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board and the release of the National Strategy to Defend Cyberspace. This critical document set the framework for much of the private public partnerships, focusing a section on home users and small/medium enterprises. I would also argue that the consolidation of cyber security related organizations into the Department of Homeland Security in the Infrastructure Protection Director was a valuable reorganization. The bringing together of the NIPC (FBI), Fed-CIRC (GSA), CIAO (Commerce), Energy Information Assurance Division (DoE) and the National Communications System (DoD) created a center of excellence that, with the help of focused leadership, will move to implement the national strategy. This new organization is called the National Cyber Security Division. Recent action taken by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create the US CERT at Carnegie Mellon University has the potential to significantly enhance security for all users. The US CERT is designed to serve as a focal point for building partnerships based cyber security response network and provide a notification network as threats and vulnerabilities are discovered. The goal for US CERT is to ensure that there is an average response time of no less than 30 minutes in the case of any attack. The very specific nature of this goal is designed to deliberately focus the US CERT on building broad participation by the private sector. The US CERT will undertake the following major initiatives: Develop common incident and vulnerability reporting protocols to accelerate information sharing across the public and private response communities; Develop initiatives to enhance and promote the development of response and warning technologies; and Forge partnerships to improve incident prevention methods and technologies; The Dept. of Justice, the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI have significantly decreased their response times and increased priorities around investigations of cyber crimes. Director Mueller has placed cyber crime in the top 5 priorities at the FBI, and the Secret Service has added a number of electronic crime task forces in order to successfully investigate and prosecute cyber criminals. All of the Defense Department's investigative organizations have led the way investigating cyber crimes and have some of the best investigators in the world. The Department of Justice, through its Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, has chaired the G-8 Subcommittee on cyber crime and has been a significant driving force in combating worldwide cyber crime. Since there are no borders when it comes to cyber space, and criminal attacks on consumers can come from all corners of the world, the State Department has conducted bilateral and multilateral discussions to ensure that there is international cooperation in the effort to protect cyber security. I have had the extreme pleasure of working with Commissioner Swindel of the Federal Trade Commission, who has been a beacon of light for the protection of consumers' privacy and security. With his help in the creation of the FTC's ``Dewey'' program and his tireless support for town hall meetings, he truly has created a ``culture of security'' globally. Private Sector Initiatives: While there will be no silver bullets in enhancing cyber security, the private sector continues to grow its capabilities and make solid improvement in securing their part of cyberspace . Two of the earliest examples of private-public cooperation for ``Cyber Crime/Cyber Security'' were the the High Tech Crime Investigators Association (HTCIA) and the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA). Both organizations date back to the mid/late 80's and are dedicated to sharing nformation on cyber crime and information security. They still exist today and their membership and value have increased significantly over the years. Most recently, the private sector has created a coalition that I see as an excellent example of efforts to enhance consumer cyber security. As you are probably aware, identity theft is a major problem. While the vast majority of ID theft occurs in the physical world, we have seen an increase in the activities of criminals to commit the same types of crime online. The most recent method is by using what we call ``phishing'' or ``spoofed'' emails. The criminals will send out thousands of emails telling people that there is an error with their online account and ask them to fill in an ``update form'' or their account will be closed. This form has the look and feel of major e- commerce sites--there was even a fake email from someone pretendingto be the FBI and asking unsuspecting users to enter personal information into a fake web site. To combat this, many of the major players in the e-commerce space banded together to create an Anti-Online ID Theft Coalition. The Coalition boasts many private sector members, with the Information Technology Association of America providing support as the executive director. The Coalition has four major goals: 1) to build technology to reduce the likelihood of these mails even reaching their intended victim; 2) to provide awareness training to consumers so they can more readily identify these criminal acts; 3) to share information on new scams amongst the various security teams; and 4) to insure accountability by working with law enforcement to identify and prosecute these bad actors. In a larger perspective, Sector Coordinators representing each of the major sectors of our economy have been appointed to fight potential cyber attack. A sector coordinator is an individual in the private sector identified by the sector lead agency to coordinate their sector, acting as an honest broker to organize and bring the sector together to work cooperatively on sector cyber security protection issues. The sector coordinator can be an individual or an institution from a private entity. These private sector leaders provide the central conduit to the federal government for the information needed to develop an accurate understanding of what is going on throughout the nation's infrastructures on a strategic level with regards to critical infrastructure protection activities. The sector coordinators and the various sector members were key to the creation of the National Strategy to Defend Cyber Space. In addition, there has been a number of new private sector Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). An ISAC is an operational mechanism to enable members to share information about vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents (cyber and physical). The sector coordinator develops these Centers with support from the sector liaison. In some cases, an ISAC Manager may be designated, who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ISAC, to work with the sector coordinator or the sector coordinating body with support from DHS and the lead federal agencies. Despite these security enhancements, we can be certain that as increased collaboration continues to enhance our protection and responsiveness, the nature and sophistication of attacks will certainly evolve. There are clear challenges we must continue to address. First, we must renew our commitment to enhance consumer awareness of basic cyber security practices. The recent attacks demonstrate that home users can be used as an effective pathway to launch attacks, or as a gateway into large enterprises. We need to build on the public/ private initiatives to promote cyber security with a focused and aggressive outreach effort to benefit all consumers. Second, while we build an effective response network we must not lose sight of the innovation frontier. Technologies on the horizon hold the potential to dramatically and potentially decisively transform our cyber security challenges. Self-healing computers, embedded technologies that enable devices to recognize and defend against attacks, and devices which enhance both security and privacy are within reach with an aggressive technology development agenda. This effort must be industry-led in collaboration with our best Universities. Most importantly, it must be synergistically linked with our response initiatives. Finally, we must recognize that cyber security is no longer merely about products, services and strategies to protect key operations. What is at stake in the effective implementation of advanced cyber security technologies and strategies is nothing less than the ability to unleash the next wave of information technology-led growth in jobs and productivity. Cyber security is an essential enabler to the advent of the next generation Internet and all it holds for how we work, live, and learn. I don't want to close without mentioning my expectation that many of these challenges will be addressed, and indeed met head-on, with tangible commitments and deliverables through the upcoming National Cyber Security Summit, to be held on December 2-3, 2003. This Summit will be co-hosted by the Information Technology Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, TechNet and the Business Software Alliance, with the support of the Department of Homeland Security. I have the honor to serve at that summit, as will many of the brightest minds and most innovative companies across all sectors of the economy. The work of this summit will continue past December 2-3 through task force work programs that will drive toward solutions in intense work before, during, and beyond the Summit. We "
