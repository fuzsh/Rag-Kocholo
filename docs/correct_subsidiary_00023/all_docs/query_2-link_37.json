        "text": "IN THE BOARDROOM™ with...\n\nMr. Tim Bennett\n\nPresident\n\nCyber Security Industry Alliance\n\nwww.csialliance.org\n\nSecuritySolutionsWatch.com: Thank you for joining us today, Tim. Please give us an overview of your background and a brief history of the CSIA.\n\nTim Bennett: My background is primarily a blend of 28 years experience in public policy related to international trade and investment issues and 8 years of association management experience in the tech industry, including serving three years as Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Executive Vice President of the American Electronics Association (AeA). In the latter role, I directed all operations for AeA’s 18 U.S. offices and 2500 members, managed the organization's offices in Beijing, Brussels and Tokyo, and staffed two board committees. Prior to that, I served as a US trade negotiator for over 11 years, most of it in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. I was one of the \"lead\" US negotiators in the Uruguay Round of GATT Negotiations, which led to the World Trade Organization. Previously, I was a consultant on international issues for many years, mainly with the DC-based law firm Steptoe & Johnson.\n\nCSIA was launched at the RSA Conference 2004 by a group of 12 innovative security software, hardware and services vendors. John Thompson, Chairman and CEO of Symantec Corp. and CSIA's first board chairman, announced the formation of this new, non-profit organization whose mission is to improve cyber security through public policy initiatives, public sector partnerships, corporate outreach, public education and alignment behind emerging industry technology standards. Its creation reflected the frustration of the founding member companies with the inadequate attention paid to these cyber security issues elsewhere.\n\nCurrently, CSIA’s primary objectives are (1) seeking federal legislation on data security and data breach notification in the U.S; (2) seeking strengthened security provisions in the EU e-privacy directive concerning electronic communications by introducing data breach notification obligations and minimum security requirements for electronic communication providers; (3) seeking antispyware federal legislation that includes strong criminal penalties; (4) seeking legislative improvements to the Federal Information Systems Management Act to ensure stronger and more secure information systems in federal agencies; and (5) increasing the amount of interchange among the C-level executives of our member companies.\n\nSecuritySolutionsWatch.com: We understand that you became President of the CSIA In April 2007. What is your perspective on the achievements of the CSIA since it began its operations in 2004?\n\nTim Bennett: The organization has covered a lot of ground in three and one-half years. It led a diverse industry coalition in obtaining U.S. Senate ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, headed up the lobbying effort to obtain the creation of an Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security and Telecommunications in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, has served on numerous U.S. government advisory committees working on critical infrastructure protection, testified frequently before congressional committees, won the national award in 2005 for best online association newsletter, and opened an office in Brussels in September 2006 to better address numerous cyber policy issues in the EU. Many associations can't match such a list of accomplishments even after a decade.\n\nSecuritySolutionsWatch.com: Who are the CSIA members and what is their niche in the network security space?\n\nTim Bennett:\n\nOur members are leaders in the industry, representing a diverse, international cross section of the information security market. They include: Application Security, Inc.; CA, Inc. (NYSE: CA); Bharosa Inc.; BSI Management Systems; Crossroads Systems, Inc. (OTCBB Pink Sheets: CRDS.PK); Entrust, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENTU); F-Secure Corporation (HEX: FSC1V); IBM Internet Security Systems Inc. (NYSE: IBM); iPass Inc. (NASDAQ: IPAS); Lavasoft; MXI Security; PGP Corporation; Qualys, Inc.; RSA, The Security Division of EMC (NYSE: EMC); Secure Computing Corporation (NASDAQ: SCUR); Surety, Inc.; SurfControl Plc (LSE: SRF); Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC); TechGuard Security, LLC; and Vontu, Inc.\n\nHere is some more information about a few of our members in their own words:\n\n“BSI Management Systems is a global accredited certified body that audits and certifies organizations to the international information security standard ISO/IEC 27001. Many companies around the world use ISO 27001 to build proactive processes that allow for detection and mitigation of network security (and other related system) vulnerabilities and threats through Information security management by identifying information security risks and implementing appropriate controls to manage those risks. The effectiveness of this system is then monitored on an on-going basis, along with a continual review to the risks. Certification to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 reinforces to customers through an independent third-party, that they operates an effective system, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.” – John DiMaria; Certified Six Sigma BB, HISP Product Manager; Business Continuity, ISMS, ITSM; BSI Management Systems\n\n“Lavasoft is the original anti-spyware company, laying the groundwork for what has become an industry of extreme economic proportions. We hold firm to our corporate vision that every computer user, regardless of economic status or geographic location, has the power (and the right) to control their individual privacy and security, and thus Ad-Aware freeware will always be a solution available for low-risk computer users. At the same time we provide advanced security solutions to protect sophisticated and higher-risk computer users. Lavasoft is simply not satisfied to provide a ‘band-aid fix’ for privacy intrusion, but in creating real social change in the industry, and we embrace the extra effort required to work hand-in-hand with adware distributors to develop solutions that do not compromise individual and business computer users.”-- Jason King, CEO, Lavasoft\n\n\"In today's wide open world of broadband Internet access, mobile devices and virtual organizations, network-centric security is not enough. That is why data-centric solutions for protecting sensitive personal and corporate information are now a top priority for IT Security. At Vontu, we help Chief Security Officers answer three basic questions: Where is my confidential data stored? Where is it being sent or copied? And how can I automatically enforce our data security policies to prevent data loss, demonstrate compliance, and maintain trust in our brand.\" –Joseph Ansanelli, Co-founder and CEO, Vontu, Inc.\n\nSecuritySolutionsWatch.com: May we have a brief legislative update – what legislation has already been passed to improve cyber security and what is on the legislative agenda going forward. Are these legislative initiatives working?"
