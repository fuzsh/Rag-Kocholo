        "text": "This article takes you through using the Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention migration assistant for Symantec and Forcepoint.\n\nBefore you start with migration, ensure you've met the following prerequisites:\n\nComplete the steps in the Before you begin section.\n\nEnsure that you've exported the required DLP policy files from your current DLP solution.\n\nOnce a policy is migrated, you can test and fine-tune it in Microsoft Purview DLP.\n\nSteps for migration\n\nUse these steps to perform a DLP policy migration:\n\nStep 1: Sign in to your account\n\nStep 2: Upload the policies that are being migrated\n\nStep 3: Edit policy settings\n\nStep 4: Review premigration feasibility report\n\nStep 5: Merge policies and choose to test or turn on your policies\n\nStep 6: Migration in progress\n\nStep 7: View the migration report\n\nNext Steps: After policy import\n\nInteractive guide\n\nCheck out this interactive guide for a visual walkthrough of the migration process.\n\nStep 1: Log in to your account\n\nAfter you've installed and launched the migration assistant, you need to log in.\n\nYou are greeted with a welcome screen.\n\nSelect Get Started and the migration assistant will check if your environment is set up correctly.\n\nSelect Next.\n\nEnter your username and select Login.\n\nEnter your password in the browser window that opens and select Sign in.\n\nNote\n\nThis application uses the Exchange Online PowerShell module. Basic authentication must be enabled in WinRM on the local computer. For more information, see Prerequisites for the Exchange Online PowerShell module.\n\nWait until your login is validated. Simultaneously, the migration assistant fetches information that is required in later stages of the migration process.\n\nOnce you're logged in, choose Next.\n\nStep 2: Upload the policies that are being migrated\n\nYou need to upload your current DLP policy exports, which act as input for the migration assistant. The policies you upload will be migrated to the Microsoft Purview DLP platform.\n\nSelect which DLP solution you want to migrate policies from.\n\nTo upload the files, select Browse.\n\nSelect the required policy files in the File Explorer pop-up window and choose Open.\n\nSymantec DLP\n\nFor migrating policies from Symantec DLP, you need to upload the XML files that you have exported from Symantec DLP.\n\nYou can select more than one XML file to migrate multiple policies at a time. It's best to migrate anywhere from one to three policies at a time to avoid confusion during later stages of the migration process.\n\nNote\n\nEnsure that the XML files you upload are Symantec DLP policy exports only and no other kind of XML.\n\nForcepoint DLP\n\nFor migrating policies from Forcepoint DLP, you need to upload the policy backup (.bak) file from Forcepoint DLP.\n\nThe tool shows you a list of your selected input policy files. You may modify your selection from the policy list.\n\nOnce you've completed with the selection of policy files you wish to migrate, select Next and move to the next step.\n\nStep 3: Edit policy settings\n\nOnce you input the policies you want to migrate, the migration assistant processes those files and map Symantec and Forcepoint DLP policy elements to Microsoft DLP elements.\n\nImportant\n\nThere may be some items that may need your review and will be marked with 'Needs review' warning symbol.\n\nKeywords, Data Identifiers and Regular expressions\n\nSymantec DLP and Forcepoint DLP differ from Microsoft Purview Information Protection in how they allow users to define sensitive information that needs to be protected.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Information Protection allows users to define sensitive items that need protection as sensitive information types (SITs), or through trainable classifiers. Microsoft provides many commonly used SITs like Credit Card Number that are preconfigured. If these don't meet your needs, you can create your own custom SITs.\n\nThe most common ways in which Symantec and Forcepoint users specify the types of sensitive information that need to be protected are:\n\nUsing out-of-box (OOB) Data Identifiers\n\nCustomizing OOB Data Identifiers\n\nDefining regular expressions and/or keywords in DLP rules\n\nThe migration assistant takes care of each of the above scenarios in one of these two ways:\n\nMap to an existing OOB SIT: For each sensitive data type for which there's an equivalent SIT in Microsoft DLP, the migration assistant attempts to create a 1:1 mapping. It automatically maps OOB Symantec or Forcepoint Data Identifiers to preconfigured Microsoft SITs, if an equivalent exists. If you want to bring the Symantec or Forcepoint Data Identifier over as-is, then you can create a new SIT as described in the next step.\n\nMigrate as a new custom SIT: For each sensitive data type for which there isn't an equivalent SIT available in Microsoft DLP, the migration assistant will automatically create a new SIT. Similarly, any regular expression(s) or keyword(s) defined directly in rules will be brought over as a new custom SIT.\n\nInclusions, Exclusions and Response Rules\n\nThe current version of the migration assistant brings over policies with âGenerate Incident Reportâ as a default action. Also, DLP policies in Microsoft DLP automatically log events in Unified Audit Log and won't need a separate action equivalent to âSyslogâ in Symantec DLP.\n\nIn addition to the automatically migrated response rules (or DLP actions), you can manually add (or remove) actions to the policies using the Compliance portal after the migration assistant has successfully migrated the policies.\n\nYou are able to see a list of all your policies and rules within them along with their status. You can select different policies from the left column to see Details for each policy. By default, the tool displays all items that need review. You can toggle to see all items in a given policy by choosing the Show All Items button at the top of the Details section.\n\nPolicy Details\n\nPolicy Name - You can edit the name of the policy before migration.\n\nEach policy is divided into two sections:\n\nKeywords, Data Identifiers and Regular expressions- These are migrated as sensitive information types (SITs) in Microsoft DLP.\n\nRules - These are automatically mapped to different Microsoft DLP conditions. Each row in the table shows\n\nThe name that the SIT will have when migrated\n\nPotential issues that may affect migration\n\nType of rule as detected from the input policy\n\nStatus:\n\nBlank/empty status - This row element is migrated without issues.\n\nNeeds Review - This row element may have one or more issues and may require some input from you.\n\nInformational - This row element may have one or more changes needed for migration but will be autoresolved.\n\nUnsupported - This row element isn't supported for migration by the tool and may need to be migrated manually after the tool exits.\n\nEdit button\n\nExtend policy coverage to other Microsoft locations. - You can extend your current Symantec policies to other Microsoft locations in addition to the original scope of the policy.\n\nFor example, a Purview DLP policy that's scoped to email can be extended to SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, and Endpoint Devices.\n\nThe migration assistant auto-creates a new policy based on the original policy with all supported rules for that given workload. One or more rules may be dropped if not supported for a given workload.\n\nFor example, the Email subject is condition may be dropped while extending an email (Exchange) DLP policy to OneDrive.\n\nSome checkboxes may be disabled by default if there are no supported conditions available in extended locations.\n\nEditing a row element - When editing one or more row elements, you are navigated to an Edit screen with more details about that row element. If there are any issues, they'll be reported via a yellow banner at the top of the screen. You may need to make changes to the content in the editable sections. Those changes will then be incorporated at the time of migration. Once you resolve the issues in the content, the yellow banner disappears.\n\nUse existing SITs from the tenant to automatically replace the current SIT. You may choose to replace the current SIT (which is being edited) with another SIT from your tenant.\n\nYou can manually change any of the mappings by selecting the corresponding row in the âTargetâ column. This opens a drop-down list with all the out-of-box SITs (OOB SITs) and all the custom SITs (if any) that you may have previously created. You can choose the option to which you wish to map to the âSourceâ row item. Alternatively, you can also choose the option New SIT from the drop-down. The migration assistant will then bring over the Source SIT as a new custom SIT.\n\nWe strongly recommend using existing SITs to replace current SITs wherever possible to help reduce creation of duplicate SITs and also reduce effort of optimizing multiple custom SITs of the same kind. Learn more about sensitive information type entity definitions.\n\nWarning\n\nMicrosoft DLP platform has a threshold for up to 10 rule packages per tenant. This limit is enough for most customers, but the creation of many duplicate custom SITs may quickly lead you to hitting this threshold without the ability to create any new custom SITs.\n\nAfter you've reviewed all the policies and the rules within them, select Next. If one or more of the policies contain at least one element with Needs Review status, then youâll see a Continue with errors button instead of Next.\n\nStep 4: Review pre-migration feasibility report\n\nThe premigration feasibility report shows you how you can expect the policies to be migrated. Review this report and make any necessary adjustments prior to starting a migration run.\n\nReview these details and choose Next.\n\nStep 5: Merge policy and select policy mode\n\nEach of the DLP policies will be split into multiple rules depending on the workloads selected and support for underlying conditions and exceptions for those workloads.\n\nThe tool allows you to merge each of these rules with compatible target policies for the same workload. These target policies may be existing Microsoft Purview DLP policies which you may have created earlier or new policies that you are importing along with the policy you wish to merge.\n\nMerging policies together will create a single Microsoft Purview DLP policy with multiple rules within. This allows for better management of policies.\n\nFor each of the DLP policies that will be created, they can be in one of three states:\n\nOn (Yes, turn it on right away)\n\nSimulate (Run the policy in simulation mode and Show policy tips)\n\nOff (No,keep it off. I'll turn it on later)\n\nYou can set the state in the migration assistant prior to migrating a policy using these two steps:\n\nChoose whether to turn on or off from the following three options:\n\nTurn on policy immediately.\n\nTurn on policy in simulation mode first. Remove from simulation mode later manually.\n\nKeep it off. Turn it on later manually.\n\nWe recommend you to bring over the policies first in simulation mode. You can monitor the alerts that the policy generates, and fine-tune it as required by your organization. Once your policy is fine-tuned, you can turn it on or put it into production.\n\nSelect Start Migration to import your policy. A new PowerShell window opens asking you to sign in again.\n\nAfter you sign in, PowerShell scripts will run that creates new policies in Microsoft DLP with all the data in the input policy files, and any other settings you made during the previous migration assistant steps.\n\nWait until the script completes finishes with a Success/Failure message. Then, new SITs and policies start showing up in the Compliance portal as well.\n\nStep 6: Migration in progress\n\nIn this step, the migration tool creates DLP policies in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n\nNote\n\nRefrain from closing the tool window while policies are being created as it may cause incomplete SITs and policies, which may require you to manually clean up later.\n\nIf an error occurs during migration, you can choose one of these actions to try and fix as a next step.\n\nTry Again - Policy creation is attempted again.\n\nRollback all changes - All SITs and policies for that session will be deleted.\n\nRollback failed policies - Only the failed SITs and policies for that session will be deleted.\n\nImportant\n\nWhen you choose to rollback any changes, it may take two to four hours for the entire rollback to take place. The migration assistant tool window needs to be kept open for the entire duration for a successful rollback.\n\nOnce the policies are migrated, select Next to view the migration report.\n\nStep 7: View the migration report\n\nYou can view the migration report once your policies are imported and the migration process is complete.\n\nEach session gets its own report. A session begins at the time you launch the app and ends when you exit the app or when migration process is completed.\n\nTechnical report\n\nYou can select the Save Technical Report button to save a more detailed excel-based report that is divided into three sheets:\n\nOverview\n\nPolicy Details\n\nSIT Details\n\nOverview Sheet - This sheet provides an overview of the migration session with the following details:\n\nTenantâs name.\n\nTimestamp of session.\n\nOverall summary stats for that session.\n\nInput policy level details, migration status and comments/recommendations.\n\nPolicy Details - This sheet provides a detailed view of each migrated policy created or not created with the following information:\n\nMapping of source policy and target policy(s) created.\n\nList of workloads each policy is applied to.\n\nAnalysis status stating if the policy is migrated completely, partially or can't migrate.\n\nFor workloads other than Exchange, this would typically show as Complete since we create a policy with the Content contains condition, which is supported across all workloads.\n\nMigration status describing if the policy migration was a success or failure.\n\nComments/recommendations with more details of that policy.\n\nSIT Details - This sheet provides information about all the sensitive information types (SITs) that were migrated with following information:\n\nPolicy-wise mapping of Input and Output SITs created.\n\nValidation fixes with information about validation errors that occurred during the migration process.\n\nComments about SIT automapping, and remediation steps.\n\nNext steps: After policy import\n\nYou should visit the compliance portal and validate the policies you migrated.\n\nCheck Sensitive Information Types\n\nTo validate that the SITs were created, navigate to Data Classification > Classifiers > Sensitive Info Types and look for the SITs. You can also sort the list on Publisher and check for SITs with a publisher name of âDLP Migration Toolâ.\n\nRename SITs as needed. For many SITs, you may notice there are similar names, often followed by roman numerals. To avoid confusion and duplication post-migration, you should rename these SITs. This is true for cases where your regular expressions and keywords are defined directly in rules within your input Symantec or Forcepoint DLP policies.\n\nTest and fine-tune SITs as needed. You should test and fine-tune the migrated SITs. The migration assistant creates new SITs with a few standard settings, which might not be right for your tenant so look out for the following:\n\nRegular expressions: Unsupported or deleted regexes (during migration)\n\nKeywords\n\nCase sensitive versus insensitive keywords\n\nString versus word match\n\nProximity\n\nOptional validators\n\nCheck DLP policies\n\nValidate the DLP policies created\n\nChoose Data Loss Prevention from left panel and check if new policies are created.\n\nAdd any missing policy elements\n\nWhile most of the input Symantec and Forcepoint DLP policy elements (like conditions, exclusions, or actions) will get migrated, often a few elements from your input Symantec or Forcepoint DLP policy may get dropped during the migration process. This is a known limitation of the migration assistant. In this scenario, you'll have to manually add these elements to the policy as they're supported by the Microsoft Purview DLP platform.\n\nTest and fine-tune the policy\n\nYou can test the policy and fine-tune it as per the needs of your organization.\n\nTurn the policy on\n\nOnce fine-tuned, you can turn on this policy or put the policy in production mode.\n\nBring over any remaining policies\n\nYou can go back to bring over the next policy or next batch of policies using the migration assistant.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you see an error on welcome screen after selecting Get Started, follow these steps:\n\nConfirm that you've installed all the prerequisites using the links/versions mentioned in Before you start.\n\nEnsure that you've restarted the machine after installing the prerequisites.\n\nEnsure that you're running the tool in admin mode using the Run as administrator option when starting the application.\n\nEnsure that your PowerShell module path is set correctly using these steps:\n\nGo to Edit system environment variables.\n\nAdd this path in the PsModulePath user variable: C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\Modules.\n\nMove this up and keep at the top.\n\nRestart the tool in administrator mode.\n\nIf you're unable to install/uninstall due to another app/process installation, follow these steps:\n\nRight click on the task bar to open Task Manager. If necessary, choose More Details.\n\nOn the Details tab, look for msiexec.exe and select End Task.\n\nTry to install or uninstall again, or, wait until the installation is finished.\n\nTo report issues to Microsoft:\n\nCollect logs - Find the logs generated by the migration assistant on your local machine at the following path: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\MigrationAssistantforMicrosoftPurviewDLP\\Logs.\n\nSend email - Send us the details about your issue along with the latest logs at dlpmigrations@microsoft.com or contact your CXE / FastTrack / Microsoft partner to share your feedback and suggestions.\n\nReporting errors & providing feedback\n\nTo report errors, raise feature requests, or share more feedback, reach out to us at dlpmigrations@microsoft.com or contact your CXE / FastTrack / Microsoft partner.\n\nTelemetry Notice\n\nData Collection: This software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send it to Microsoft.
