        "text": "About\n\nWith over 35 years of venture capital experience, Steve has led, co-led or served on the boards of the firm’s investments in Trusteer (acquired by IBM), Guidewire Software (IPO), Box (IPO), Imperva (IPO), Xylan (IPO), Epic Design (IPO), Check Point Software (IPO), New Focus (IPO), Active Semiconductor (acquired by Quorvo), Appthority (acquired by Symantec), Savings.com (acquired by Cox Target Media), Vontu (acquired by Symantec), Sierra Monolithics (acquired by Semtech), Verity (IPO), Occam Networks (IPO and acquired by Calix), CipherTrust (acquired by Secure Computing), Accelerated Networks (IPO), Parametric Technology (Rasna), NetDynamics (acquired by SUN), Stratacom (IPO), Harmonic Lightwaves (IPO), Elantec (IPO), CenterView Software (acquired by Sybase), Applied Digital Access (IPO) and Micro Linear (IPO). Steve currently serves on the boards of AirEye, Badge, Cato Networks, Human Interest, Informed.iq, Kryptowire, Quantifind and Zefr.\n\nSteve enjoys the role of coach and mentor to CEOs and finds it rewarding to help them consider new solutions or gain a broadened perspective on the market environment. “Markets define themselves based on business or consumers that have a need and are most often evolutionary, not revolutionary,” he notes. “The consumerization and globalization of technology are especially interesting now. The evolution from an enterprise model to one that is consumer-facing is big.”\n\nSteve is the former executive board member and Treasurer of the National Venture Capital Association. Steve served as President of WAVC (Western Association of Venture Capital) and is currently a board member of the World Affairs Council, the Stanford GSB Venture Capital Fund and President of the Stanford DAPER Investment Fund. He holds a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and an M.B.A. from Stanford Business School, where he was an Arjay Miller Scholar."
