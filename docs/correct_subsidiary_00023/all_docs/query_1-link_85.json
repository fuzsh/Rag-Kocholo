Zinet also holds relevant industry security certifications, GCLD, CISA, CCSK, CYSA+, AWS CCP. Zinet became inspired by her children to start writing children’s books.

Proud in Her Hijab is a bestseller and the winner of the 2021 Distinguished Authors Guild and 2022 Literary Titans book awards.

Being a Black immigrant woman who transitioned into the cybersecurity field not too long ago, Zinet has learned about the glaring lack of diversity within the industry.
