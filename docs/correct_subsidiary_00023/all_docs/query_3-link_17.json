        "text": "With McAfee having announced the $20-million acquisition of Onigma Ltd., a privately held Israeli provider of data loss prevention (DLP) software and services, other major security players also are looking to make DLP acquisitions.\n\nDLP is a fast-growing segment of the security market concerned with monitoring, managing, and preventing the leakage of confidential information from enterprises and governments.\n\nSome DLP solutions are deployed at the network perimeter, intercepting sensitive outbound content by using a lexicon database or a hashing system, while others are deployed on host computers, monitoring not only what data leaves the computer over the network but also checking to prevent restricted downloads, whether over the network or from USB storage keys.\n\nOne of the early leaders in the DLP space is Vontu, which had aggregate financing of about $25 million as of 2005. According to industry rumor, Vontu is the DLP company that security-market leader Symantec has targeted for acquisition.\n\nVontu and Symantec have a pre-existing relationship that extends back more than a year. More recently, Vontu has licensed DLP technology to Symantec that will be included in a new Symantec product, Premium Content Control, which will be delivered as part of the Symantec Mail Security (SMS) 8300 appliance, scheduled to be generally available generally on October 31, 2006.\n\nThe rumored acquisition might not occur immediately, but there’s enough buzz to suggest it is likely to happen soon."
