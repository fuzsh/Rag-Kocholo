        "text": "Data is the lifeblood of any modern business, but it also comes with significant challenges and risks. Data protection is a crucial aspect of any data strategy, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked, misused, or compromised. Data loss prevention (DLP) is a key component of data protection, preventing unauthorized access, sharing, or transfer of data that could harm the business or its customers.\n\nHowever, not all DLP solutions are created equal. Some are more complex, costly, and difficult to manage than others. Some are more integrated, flexible, and scalable than others. Some are more suited to the cloud, hybrid, or on-premise environments than others. Choosing the right DLP solution can make a huge difference in the effectiveness, efficiency, and security of your data protection strategy.\n\nIf you are currently using Symantec Vontu DLP, you might be wondering if there is a better alternative. Symantec Vontu is a legacy DLP solution that has been around for a long time, but it also comes with several limitations and challenges, especially for organizations that are using or planning to use Microsoft's cloud services. Symantec Vontu is not fully integrated with Microsoft's ecosystem, requires complex and manual configuration and management, and might not offer the best performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for your business.\n\nThat's why you should consider migrating to Microsoft Purview DLP, a modern and advanced DLP solution that is designed to work seamlessly with Microsoft's cloud services and offers numerous benefits for your business. Microsoft Purview DLP is a part of Microsoft Purview, a comprehensive data governance service that helps you discover, catalog, classify, and protect your data across your enterprise. Microsoft Purview DLP leverages the power of Microsoft's cloud capabilities, artificial intelligence, and analytics to provide a superior DLP solution that can help you save money, secure data, and simplify data management.\n\nSave Money with Microsoft Purview DLP by migrating from Vontu\n\nOne of the main benefits of migrating to Microsoft Purview DLP is the potential cost savings that you can achieve. Microsoft Purview DLP offers a more cost-effective and resource-efficient DLP solution than Symantec Vontu DLP, especially for organizations that have Microsoft E3 or E5 subscriptions. Here are some of the ways that Microsoft Purview DLP can help you save money:\n\nLicensing Costs: If you have Microsoft E3 or E5 subscriptions, you already have access to Microsoft Purview DLP features, which means you don't need to pay additional licensing fees for a separate DLP solution. This can lead to significant savings in the long run, as you can leverage the integrated DLP features that Microsoft provides for its cloud services, such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Teams. You can also benefit from other Microsoft 365 security and compliance tools that are included in your subscription, such as Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Information Protection, and Microsoft Compliance Manager.\n\nMigration Costs: Migrating from Symantec Vontu DLP to Microsoft Purview DLP can incur some costs, such as hiring consultants, purchasing new hardware, customizing software, and training users. However, these costs can be minimized by following best practices and leveraging the existing resources and expertise that you have with Microsoft's cloud services. For instance, you can use the pre-built templates and automated policy recommendations that Microsoft Purview DLP provides to speed up the migration process and reduce the need for manual configuration and testing. You can also use the built-in connectors and APIs that Microsoft Purview DLP offers to integrate with your existing systems, such as Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, and ServiceNow, without requiring substantial redevelopment efforts.\n\nTraining Costs: The learning curve for Microsoft Purview DLP is much lower than that of Symantec Vontu DLP, as Microsoft Purview DLP has a more intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the configuration and management of DLP policies. This means that you can reduce the training costs and time required for your administrators and users to become proficient with the new system. You can also leverage the extensive documentation and support that Microsoft provides for its cloud services, as well as the online community and forums that can help you with any questions or issues that you might encounter.\n\nResource Efficiency: Microsoft Purview DLP enables you to optimize your IT resources by centralizing and simplifying the management of DLP policies across your enterprise. You can manage all your policies from a single interface, reducing the complexity and overhead of maintaining multiple systems and consoles. You can also benefit from the automation and machine learning capabilities that Microsoft Purview DLP provides, such as proactive policy recommendations, automated incident response, and advanced analytics and reporting. These features can help you identify and mitigate risks more effectively, streamline workflows, and free up valuable IT staff time for higher-priority tasks.\n\nSecure Data with Microsoft Purview DLP\n\nAnother major benefit of migrating to Microsoft Purview DLP is the enhanced data security that you can achieve. Microsoft Purview DLP offers a more robust and comprehensive DLP solution than Symantec Vontu DLP, especially for organizations that are using or planning to use Microsoft's cloud services. Here are some of the ways that Microsoft Purview DLP can help you secure data:\n\nData Discovery and Classification: Microsoft Purview DLP leverages the data discovery and classification capabilities of Microsoft Purview, which helps you scan and catalog your data across your enterprise, including on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. You can use Microsoft Purview to automatically or manually classify your data based on its sensitivity, such as confidential, personal, or public. You can also use Microsoft Purview to apply labels and metadata to your data, such as retention policies, encryption keys, or access permissions. These features help you gain visibility and control over your data, enabling you to apply appropriate DLP policies and protect your data accordingly.\n\nPolicy and Rule Translation: Microsoft Purview DLP provides a variety of pre-built templates for common DLP policies, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, which you can use to quickly deploy policies that adhere to industry standards and best practices. You can also customize these templates or create your own policies based on your specific business needs and compliance requirements. Microsoft Purview DLP uses a flexible and powerful mechanism for defining and enforcing policies, which allows you to translate your existing rules and policies from Symantec Vontu DLP without losing functionality or coverage. You can also use the automated policy recommendations that Microsoft Purview DLP provides to enhance your policies and address any gaps or risks that you might have.\n\nStructured Information Types (SITs) with Exact Data Matching (EDM): Microsoft Purview DLP supports SITs with EDM, which is a feature that allows you to detect and protect structured information types, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or bank account numbers, using exact data matching logic. This feature helps you prevent the leakage of sensitive data that might not be detected by regular expressions or keywords. Microsoft Purview DLP allows you to configure SITs with EDM using a similar process as Symantec Vontu DLP, ensuring that you can maintain the same level of detection accuracy and performance.
