        "text": "DLP and CASB come together in a single solution to provide complete visibility and control of data in the cloud\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – Oct. 26, 2016 – Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ:SYMC), the world’s leading cyber security company, today announced the integration of Symantec Data Loss Prevention (DLP) with Symantec CloudSOC (formerly Blue Coat’s Elastica CloudSOC Cloud Access Security Broker [CASB]) and Cloud Data Protection products to address the needs of the cloud generation. This integrated solution provides chief information security officers (CISOs) visibility and control over all sensitive content that users upload, store and share via the cloud, protecting confidential information through all stages of its lifecycle, anywhere and everywhere it travels.\n\n“For the first time, users have a solution that protects data in a holistic manner, regardless of where the data comes from or where it’s going,” said Mike Fey, Symantec president and chief operating officer. “We are moving quickly to integrate our solutions and deliver a combined product portfolio to deliver integrated cyber defense solutions across customers’ entire IT environment. Symantec is uniquely positioned to bring market-leading solutions, fed by the largest threat intelligence network, to offer unprecedented protection to the cloud generation.”\n\nAs enterprises become more reliant on the cloud to improve collaboration and flexibility, it’s increasingly difficult for CISOs to keep track of, maintain compliance of and secure sensitive company data as it flows between on-premises systems, mobile applications and in cloud services. This data might include personal records, protected health information or payment archives. According to the recent Blue Coat Elastica Shadow Data Report, 23 percent of all files in cloud apps are broadly shared, and 12 percent of those files contain sensitive or compliance-related data[1]. Enterprises typically use a variety of point solutions and siloed security tools that don’t protect all the sensitive data, creating security gaps and opening the door to leaks and attacks.\n\nComprehensive Data Protection\n\nThis offering combines market-leading Symantec DLP — which discovers, monitors and protects sensitive data across network, endpoint, storage and cloud — with Symantec’s CloudSOC CASB and Cloud Data Protection products to secure data and user activity in Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. By combining these technologies, customers can now seamlessly migrate their DLP solution to the cloud, leveraging all of their existing policies and workflow integrations to better protect enterprise assets — on-premises, in private clouds, and in public cloud applications and services. The integrated Symantec solution optimizes performance and reduces bandwidth requirements by using cloud computing resources for data in the cloud, while staying fully integrated with on-premises DLP rules and workflows.\n\nExtend Visibility and Control to Cloud Apps\n\nSymantec DLP Cloud and Symantec CloudSOC offers a comprehensive solution that gives users end-to-end visibility and a single point of control over sensitive data that is created, shared and manipulated across multiple channels. Leveraging Symantec’s industry-leading data loss prevention solution and Blue Coat’s best-in-class, data-science-driven CASB, it protects data through its lifecycle, eliminating cloud application blind spots, uncovering hidden data residing in the cloud, and ensuring DLP policies extend across cloud and on-premises applications.\n\nSymantec DLP Cloud and CloudSOC offers customers the ability to:\n\nExtend DLP Coverage: Direct visibility of all types of content in more than 60 cloud apps, including Office 365, Box, Dropbox, Google Apps or Salesforce\n\nMaximize DLP Investment: Leverage existing DLP policies and workflows for cloud apps as well as endpoints, networks and data centers\n\nGain Full CASB Functionality: Constant monitoring and control of all content additions, changes and access rights in cloud apps\n\nIncreased Performance: Optimize bandwidth and latency by leveraging an integrated pure cloud solution\n\nSymantec DLP Cloud and CloudSOC offers superior content detection, activity logging, forensic investigation and policy enforcement capabilities to safely enable the use of sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud applications and ensure compliance for cloud data.\n\nKeep Data Safe in Cloud Apps With Encryption and Tokenization\n\nThe integration of Symantec Cloud Data Protection adds powerful new data protection capabilities to Symantec DLP, allowing customers to address cloud data compliance, privacy and residency concerns. DLP policies can now be configured to selectively encrypt or tokenize cloud SaaS application information based on the data detected in an application’s field or file attachments. When the policy is enforced, sensitive information is replaced with a token or an encrypted value while still inside the organization’s firewall, prior to going to a cloud environment for processing and storage. Since clear-text data is encrypted or tokenized in transit, at rest and in use within cloud applications, compliance and IT risk teams can be confident that their regulated data is not exposed while outside their control.\n\nAvailability\n\nSymantec DLP Cloud and CloudSOC is now available in the U.S. and will be available globally by Q1 2017. Symantec DLP and Cloud Data Protection are available now. Additional information can be viewed here.\n\nAs part of its continuous integration efforts, Symantec also announced today the merging of Blue Coat Threat Intelligence into its Global Intelligence Network, creating the industry’s largest and most diverse set of threat data.
