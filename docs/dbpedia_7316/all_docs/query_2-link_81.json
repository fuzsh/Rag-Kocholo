        "text": "LOUIS RENAULT (1877-1944)\n\nNeetu Sinha\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLouis Renault, a man who is an inventor, racing driver and French entrepreneur, born on February 12, 1877, in a Parisian family at 14 places de Laborde in Paris and died on October 24, 1944, in the prison of Fresnes near Paris. He is the youngest of all as he has a sister Marie Berthe (1868-1889), and three brothers, Marie Joseph (1863-1886), Fernand (1865-1909) and Marcel (1872-26 May 1903).Mr. Alfred Renault, father of Louis Renault was master in the trade of fabrics and buttons and Mrs. Louise Berthe Magnien, his mother was the daughter of great traders. He belongs to an old Alsatian Jewish family.\n\nLIFE\n\nIn his childhood, though he was shy, lonely and little talkative but was passionate about mechanics and electricity. In 1891 at an early age of 14, he set up a workshop at the end of the garden of the family second home in Boulogne-Billancourt near Paris. His passion drives him to lock himself in his creative solitude. Though he neglected his studies, he modifies a Pan hard engine, multiplies inventions, tirelessly draws plans and files his first patent. He spends a lot of his time in the workshop where Leon Serpollet makes steam car engines.\n\nHe completed his baccalaureate at the Condorcet high school and decided to abandon his studies so that he could rely on his prolific imagination, intuition, and pragmatism.\n\nIn 1898, at the age of 21, he created his first cart, Renault Type A which he took on the entire Lepic street with his brothers and friends on December 24, 1898, during the Christmas Eve. Thereafter he pocketed 12 orders and then he decided to become a car manufacturer. A few months later, he filed the patent of the gearbox to \"direct catch\". On February 25, 1899, his two brothers Marcel and Fernand founded the company Renault Frères at 10 rue du Cours in Boulogne-Billancourt with 60 employees including Louis who was just simple employee put to the test and beneficiary of his patent.\n\nIn August 1899, Louis lined up with his brother Marcel at Amateur Drivers Cup and won his first race and thereafter Renault brothers got success in several others. Due to this, the brand name of Renault got on high with an increase in a number of orders for cars. This was the phase when Renault was on top in its category.\n\nFirst World War\n\nDuring the First World War, Louis Renault took active participation and in addition to cars, trucks, tractors, shells, and rockets, he builds elements of rifles and cannons and aircraft engines. Though initially in August 1914, the factories of Billancourt were partly closed due to the advancement of the German army forced to reopen the factory. He was sent to Bordeaux to meet Minister Millerand, folded with the Poincaré government and was ordered for making shells for the army. Due to harsh working conditions until 1917, he introduced an important social reforms and created large worker cooperative in consultation with Albert Thomas in 1916. His exceptional contribution to the Allied victory makes him an international hero and increases the image of the Renault Company in the world.\n\nIn 1921, Louis successfully transformed the \"Société Anonyme des Factories Renault (SAUR)\" into an industrial empire and brought a bank into its capital to face the global competition. Renault plant Île Seguin in Boulogne-Billancourt, symbol of workers' social struggles. Louis Renault invests a lot of money and time in the Chausey archipelago. He also enters into unrestrained competition in all industrial and technical fields with his great rival André Citroën at the expense of small manufacturers who are gradually disappearing.\n\nVery well introduced in political circles, he becomes the official supplier of major public transport companies. In 1934, Louis Renault's health brutally degraded from a right kidney calculus. On February 21, 1935, he met Adolf Hitler in Berlin for two hours at the Reich Chancellery to preserve peace in Europe through an economic agreement between the two countries in the framework of a Franco-German agreement.\n\nIn May 1940 during Second World War, he flew to the United States to accelerate the production of tanks for the purpose of resisting the German advance. But in March 1942, during allied bombing hit, the plant witnesses 500 dead bodies and around 2,000 wounding in Boulogne-Billancourt which results him to return from the US for rebuilding. After the liberation of Paris, he is accused of collaboration. A warrant is issued against him on 19 September 1944 for \"undermining the external security of the State\".\n\nOn September 23, 1944, his health deteriorated quickly in prison and later he was transferred to Paris clinic where he dies. His last word would have been: \"the Factory ...\" He is buried in Herqueville in the Eure, a commune of his farmland of 1,700 hectares in which he owned a castle where he has been extended in parts.\n\nHIS INVENTIONS"
