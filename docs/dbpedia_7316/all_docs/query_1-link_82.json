        "text": "Curiosity may be the defining creative trait of Patrick le Quément’s. His tenure at Renault Design accordingly was about an ongoing quest, rather than a final destination. Hence the Senior Vice President Design and his team envisaging the brand’s style to be guided by an ethos, rather than a set of styling cues. However, defining that ethos was a considerable challenge in itself.\n\nThe least expected discoveries that we made with our designers was that the non-French team members seemed to be the greatest supporters of our quest to find a unique positioning for Renault through Frenchness. For those whom we had hired came not only to join Renault, but also to live in Paris, under the spell of the dialectical baguette that ruled us all, as well as the promise of a stroll on the Champs Elysée, the peeling red paint on the café signs, or the bewitching smell of fresh bread from the Boulangerie, which all resulted in a charm that made everything seem right, seem… charming.\n\nOn the other hand, quite a few of the French designers, particularly those that had a long past with the company did not really understand what we were aiming for. It was akin to the story I’ve regularly told of the man walking along the bank of a stream, on a scorcher of a day, who wonders if he can take a dip in the river to cool down, but is uncertain regarding the water’s temperature. Seeing a fish swimming along the bank, he asks the fish: «Hey fish, how’s the water?» To which the fish replies: «Water, what water?»\n\nThe Vel Satis and Avantime concept cars may have laid the stylistic groundwork for Mégane II, but they only truly proved that sound ideas were in place - how these ideas were to be implemented was an altogether different, crucial issue. As history has taught, time and again, the best ideas are worth nought if they remain theoretical - or are critically diluted.\n\nThere was something that all designers, be they French or coming from any other nation, agreed upon, however: that Renault Engineering had to engage in their own cultural revolution. For if Renault were outstanding in their creativity, when it came to developing a new concept, they were simply far removed from world’s best standards when it came to inventing an attractive vehicle package, such as Audi would come up with, time after time.\n\nIn those days, Renault’s engineers were in the hands of three schools of Engineering: the Arts & Métiers, the Central School or, if one was dealing with the true élite, the Ecole Polytechnique. About the latter’s graduates, the following was regularly claimed: «They know everything, and nothing else». And so it was that I came into this company, as a mere stylist - even if I had a diploma in Industrial Design, as well as an MBA. To these engineers’ eyes, I was just an artist and therefore close to a manual worker, and clearly not one cut to think strategically.\n\nIt was the arrogance of a few of its leaders, «them from the old school» that particularly irritated me. The ones who had criticised American cars’ handling, when they ran American Motors, as being like a bar of soap in a bidet. That same bunch who, at the when time «Le Style» still reported to Engineering, had described to a journalist that the role of stylists was to dress up the hunchback."
