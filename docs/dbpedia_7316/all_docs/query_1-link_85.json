        "text": "Twistwrench.\n\nMy Dad's 10 AX has Renault Freres on the hubcaps. So does my brother's 08. My 12 AX and all our later ones have Renault Automobiles. My chassis plate says \"RENAULT Constructeurs\". I am pretty sure the earlier plates say RENAULT FRERES, but I dont have one today to observe.\n\nActually in the Georgiano book, it says that the company was renamed in 09 dropping the Freres after the death of one of the brothers.\n\nThanks\n\nBob\n\nI did some more research on the brothers. Louis Renault's car,designed in 1898 had shaft drive,direct drive top gear and a tubular chassis. He slaved away with his brother,Marcel in a tiny shed in his father's garden which is still there--in the forecourt of the great Renault factory in Paris--with the bench,lathe, and drill press etc. On 30 March, 1899 Societe Renault Freres was founded in Billancourt,where the family had holdings in their button-making business and the 22 year old Louis had learned to be a mechanic. The early years saw both brothers involved with racing.Imagine today's company owners doing their own racing.Marcel won the Paris to Vienna race of1902, a1060 mile race with 137 participants In the 1903 Paris to Madrid race Marcel died. Louis got out of racing and even considered closing the factory but a third brother,Fernand ,shut down the button business and joined the company.\n\nThis information comes mostly from \"History of the Motor Car\" by Marco Matteucci. I am still searching for Info on when it ceased being \"Freres\"\n\nIn 1909 Fernand died. I think he got sick in 1906 and effectively stopped working for the company.Since there were no more brothers left, Louis changed the name to Les Automobiles Renault. In 1922 Les Automobiles ceased to exist and Anonyme de Usines Renault was born.\n\nIn 1939 civilian production ended. When the Nazis took over they forced Renault and all other French companies to work for them. Louis allegedly slowed down production as much as possible. In 42-43 the factories were bombed.The allies liberated France in 1944 and Louis was arrested and charged with collaboration. He died while awaiting trial on 24 )ctober in Fresnes Prison under a shroud of secrecy. ( an autopsy revealed his neck was broken). After the war the government under Charles DeGaulle nationalised renault.I think they stole it.\n\nHey Twisty, is that your 1914 Renault in the Nov-Dec issue of Antique Automobile? Beautiful car"
