        "text": "Renault was founded in 1898 by Louis Renault and his brothers Marcel and Fernand. The first Renault car was the Renault Voiturette 1CV, sold in 1898. Renault began manufacturing its own engines in 1903 and became the best-selling foreign brand in New York in 1907-1908.\n\nRenault's participation in motor racing helped to publicize its vehicles, and the company fostered its reputation for innovation from early on. During World War I, Renault branched out into ammunition, military aircraft engines, and vehicles, including the revolutionary Renault FT tank. Louis Renault was awarded the Legion of Honour for his company's contributions. Renault later expanded into manufacturing buses, commercial cargo vehicles, and trucks.\n\nLouis Renault expanded Renault's scope after the First World War, producing agricultural and industrial machinery. Renault struggled to compete with the increasingly popular small, affordable \"people's cars.\" Problems with the US stock market and the workforce slowed the company's growth. Renault also had to find a way to distribute its vehicles more efficiently. In 1920, Louis signed one of its first distribution contracts with Gustave Gueudet. Renault cars during this time period had two model lines; the economy four-cylinder engine models and the luxury six-cylinder models. Renault offered eight body styles. The London operation was important to Renault in 1928. Renault took over the aircraft manufacturer Caudron and focused on producing small airplanes. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Renault was surpassed by Citroën as the largest car manufacturer in France.\n\nDuring World War II, Renault refused to produce tanks for Nazi Germany and instead produced trucks. In 1942, the British and Americans bombed the Renault factory causing heavy damage. After the liberation of Paris in 1944, the French government requisitioned the Renault factories and Louis Renault was arrested and incarcerated, dying under unclear circumstances while awaiting trial. The company was posthumously expropriated from Louis Renault and nationalized as Régie Nationale des Usines Renault. Under the leadership of Pierre Lefaucheux, Renault experienced both commercial resurgence and labor unrest in the 1950s and 1960s. The company launched several successful models, including the rear-engine 4CV, the Dauphine, Renault 4, Renault 8, Renault 10, Renault 16, and Renault 6. The company celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1970 and continued to grow aggressively.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Renault expanded globally by establishing subsidiaries in Eastern Europe, South America, and South East Asia. The company also diversified into other industries, including taking a controlling stake in Automobiles Alpine and collaborating with Nash Motors Rambler and its successor American Motors Corporation. Renault tried to penetrate the North American market but failed. The company also collaborated with Peugeot until the latter acquired Citroen and formed PSA, reducing their collaboration. In 1980, Renault produced over two million cars and LCVs and added 54,086 buses/coaches and trucks. Renault partnered with American Motors Corporation, lending AMC operating capital and buying a minority 22.5% stake in the company in late 1979. The partnership resulted in the marketing of Jeep vehicles in Europe. The Renault-AMC marketing effort in passenger cars was unsuccessful compared to the popularity of Jeep vehicles.\n\nIn the 1980s, Renault faced financial difficulties and underwent a major restructuring process, including cutting costs, selling non-core assets, and withdrawing from motorsports.\n\nIn 1994, Renault announced plans to sell shares to the public, which were completed in 1996. This allowed the company to expand into new markets and develop its infrastructure. Renault experienced financial problems and Carlos Ghosn was appointed to tackle the issue by implementing cost-cutting measures, organisational changes and introducing a lean production system. After Volvo's exit, Renault searched for a new partner and entered into an alliance with Nissan in 1999, which was the first of its kind involving a Japanese and French company. Renault continued to operate as a standalone company but with the intent to collaborate with its alliance partner. Renault sold various assets to finance its inversions and acquisitions, refocusing itself as a car and van manufacturer. Renault developed a reputation for distinctive, outlandish design and became known for car safety. In 2010, Renault entered into an alliance with Daimler to develop a replacement for the Smart based on the Twingo. In February 2010, Renault opened a new production factory near Tangier, Morocco, with an annual output capacity of 170,000 vehicles.\n\nRenault restructured its automotive division in January 2021 into four units, including Renault, Dacia and Lada, Alpine, and Mobilize. In February 2021, Renault launched the SUV Kiger in India, but in April 2021, the company reported a 1.1% revenue decline and planned to reduce car production and focus on high-margin models. In November 2022, Renault announced plans to spin off its electric car development into a subsidiary called Ampere and its powertrain production and development operations into a joint venture with Geely.\n\nRenault has a history of innovation, including Louis Renault's direct drive gear in 1899, the first four-wheel disc brake system in the Renault 8 in 1963, and the CARMINAT real-time system for location and weather information in 1988, which is now included in the Renault R-link system and Carminat TomTom devices.\n\nRenault Group offers a range of products and services related to automobiles, electric vehicles, and mobility solutions. The company's main product offerings include passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and electric vehicles. Some of the popular car models produced by Renault Group include the Clio, Megane, Captur, and the electric Zoe. The company also offers a range of commercial vehicles under the Renault Trucks brand, including vans, pickup trucks, and heavy-duty trucks.\n\nIn addition to its traditional automotive products, Renault Group has been focusing on developing innovative mobility solutions to meet the changing needs of consumers. The company's mobility services include car-sharing, ride-sharing, and other mobility platforms. Renault Group has also invested heavily in electric vehicles and has a wide range of electric vehicles on offer, including the Zoe, Twingo, and Kangoo.\n\nThrough its various acquisitions, Renault Group also produces other brands: Dacia, Mobilize, and Alpine.\n\nDacia is a Romanian car manufacturer that was acquired by Renault in 1999. Dacia is known for producing affordable cars with simple designs and features, making them popular in emerging markets. Dacia models are typically sold under the Dacia brand, but some are sold under the Renault brand in certain markets. Dacia models are known for their practicality and reliability, and the brand has won several awards for its value for money.\n\nMobilize is a new brand launched by Renault in 2021, focused on mobility services and solutions. Mobilize aims to provide innovative mobility solutions to individuals and businesses, including car-sharing, ride-sharing, and last-mile delivery services. Mobilize also offers a range of electric vehicles and charging solutions for businesses and fleets. The brand's goal is to help reduce the environmental impact of transportation while providing convenient and affordable mobility solutions.\n\nAlpine is a French sports car manufacturer that was acquired by Renault in 1973. Alpine is known for producing lightweight, high-performance sports cars that offer a thrilling driving experience. The brand was revived in 2017 with the launch of the A110, a two-seater sports car that pays homage to the original Alpine A110 of the 1960s. Alpine is focused on producing high-performance electric and hybrid sports cars, as well as developing new mobility solutions and technologies. The brand is also involved in motorsports, including endurance racing and Formula 1.\n\nRenault Group also provides financing and leasing services for its customers through its financing arm, RCI Bank and Services. RCI Bank and Services offer financing solutions for individuals and businesses, including traditional car loans, leasing, and fleet management services."
