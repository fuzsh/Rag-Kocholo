        "text": "Renault cars are manufactured by Renault S.A., a French vehicle manufacturer producing cars, vans, buses, tractors, and trucks. The company is well known for numerous revolutionary designs, security technologies, and motor racing.\n\nProducing cars since late 1898, the Renault corporation was founded in 1899 as Société Renault Frères by Louis Renault, his brothers Marcel and Fernand, and his friends Thomas Evert and Julian Wyer. Louis was a bright, aspiring young engineer who had already designed and built several models before teaming up with his brothers, who had honed their business skills working for their father’s textiles firm. While Louis handled design and production, Marcel and Fernand handled company management.\n\nThe very first of the Renault cars, the Renault Voiturette 1CV was sold to a friend of Louis’ father after giving him a test ride on December 24, 1898. The client was so impressed with the way the tiny car ran and how it climbed the streets that he bought it.\n\nThe brothers immediately recognised the publicity that could be obtained for their vehicles by participation in motor racing and Renault made itself known through achieving instant success in the first city-to-city races held in Switzerland, resulting in rapid expansion for the company. Both Louis and Marcel Renault raced company vehicles, but Marcel was killed in an accident during the 1903 Paris-Madrid race. Although Louis Renault never raced again, his company remained very involved, including their Renault AK 90CV winning the first ever Grand Prix motor racing event in 1906. Louis was to take full control of the company as the only remaining brother in 1906 when Fernand retired for health reasons.\n\nThe Renault reputation for innovation of Renault cars was fostered from very early on. In 1899, Renault launched the first production sedan car as well as patenting the first turbocharger.Renault manufactured taxis, buses and commercial cargo vehicles in the pre-war years, and during World War I (1914 – 1918) branched out into ammunition, military airplanes and vehicles such as the revolutionary Renault FT-17 tank. By the end of the war, Renault was the number one private manufacturer in France.\n\nTimeline\n\n1898 – Louis Renault founded Renault\n\n1903 – Marcel Renault dies in a car accident\n\n1943 – The Renault factory in Billancourt is attacked by the German army\n\n1944 – Louis Renault dies\n\n1961 – The Renault 4 goes on sale to give Renault a practical competitor for the likes of the Citroen 2CV and Volkswagen Beetle.\n\n1965 – Renault launches the world’s first production hatchback – the Renault 16.\n\n1971 – Renault launches the Renault 15 and Renault 17 two-door coupes, giving it a serious competitor for the Ford Capri.\n\n1972 – Renault cars enter the new “supermini” market with its R5 hatchback, one of the first such cars in this sector.
