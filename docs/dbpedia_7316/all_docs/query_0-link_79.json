        "text": "Patrick grits his teeth and confronts the past.\n\nThe problem was that he had asked me so nicely. Above all, Alain Dubois-Dumée was a very likeable man, and as head of Renault’s Corporate Communications, he had been so helpful and congenial in all presentations associated with our past concept cars. So there he sat, and guilelessly requested whether our concept car for the coming Paris motor Show could possibly be a retro design based on the Renault 4CV — after all, it would mark its fiftieth birthday. “You know”, he added, “like Volkswagen has done with the Beetle”? Oh yes! I did remember that ‘Back to the Future’ Concept One that was presented by Volkswagen at the 1994 Detroit Motor Show.\n\nTo me, this notion was anathema; the idea of not simply taking our lead from another manufacturer, but sinking into the too low, too soft a couch of ‘retro design’ smacked of a lack of confidence in the future, or worse, a lack of inspiration. Having already publicly expressed my desire to avoid retro design, this was the equivalent of my having to eat my own hat. Well, I accepted to take that unsavoury spoonful of cod liver oil and get on with it, but what option had I if we wanted to continue to unfold our vision of the future through concept cars that were essential to changing Renault’s image?\n\nLouis Renault had not been too keen on rear-engine cars and more than hesitant to give the go ahead to the 4CV programme but, his top three collaborators: Fernand Picard, the most senior engineer, Robert Barhaud who designed the body, and Charles-Edmond Serre, a senior administrative director, managed to convince him, which only goes to show that he was starting to lose his iron control of the company. And so it was that, in 1945, after having been given a once-over by Ferdinand Porsche, the 4CV was readied for production.\n\nIt was the very first mass production Renault to adopt Ford manufacturing principles, making it possible to reduce its production cost, in order to come up with an affordable price and promote its mass distribution to the population. Over one million units of the diminutive four-door were manufactured, and was only replaced in 1961, by the front wheel drive 4L, which became the first worthy and innovative rival to the Citroen 2CV.\n\nI never did like the 4CV, and I admit to having hated the thing after it was associated with a very personal tragedy which took place when I was only eleven years old. My father, Jean le Quément was an officer in the French Foreign Legion. He would never have owned a 4CV, for you see. . . he liked cars. The Renault came into his life when a spinster friend of my parents bought a lottery ticket whilst strolling on the Canebière, that large cosmopolitan boulevard in Marseille. Her prize? One of those little 4CV blighters.\n\nMy father relished the freedom the motorcar offered and had the unfortunate idea of suggesting that she keep it and learn how to drive, passing her test on her sixth attempt. He also promised to accompany her on her first journey to our holiday home in the Haute Provence and, despite my father’s premonition on the evening before the journey was to take place, he did not pretext a last minute excuse — he was after all an officer. They drove out of Marseille and just before reaching Aix-en-Provence, the inevitable accident occurred. She survived, but my father was mortally wounded, dying two months later. I never did like 4CVs . . .\n\nThe Fiftie was presented to the Design team as a ‘fun project’, and all the designers who wanted to join the Advanced Design Department in order to participate were welcomed in a large meeting room, sketch pads and biros in hand. The briefing began with my enthusiastic introduction, admitting that it was a somewhat unusual type of project but, that I knew we would come up with something fresh, unique, oozing with charm and be instantly recognisable as genetically linked to the 4CV. This was followed by Jean-Marie Souquet, our friend from Product Planning, who made an historic fly over the positioning of the 4CV in the post-war story of our company and, he then referred to our decision that it would be based on the Renault Spider’s aluminium chassis, fitted with carbon fibre bodywork, to become a lightweight, two-seater mid-engined berlinette.\n\nWhat he did not mention was that we would forego the original Spider’s powerplant, the 150hp 2-litre engine, for a yet to be launched 1149cc engine delivering a more modest 60bhp to put a spotlight on a later to be commercialised engine for the Twingo and Clio. I had vetoed this part of the announcement, as it might have given a shudder to our resident petrolheads, who were expecting something more powerful, with a throaty sound.\n\nAnd then Jean-François Venet, the departmental Director of Advanced Design, took over for the rest of the meeting, listing the key attributes. He presented the vehicle package, saying that it was still subject to their creative input, added what we targeted in terms of dimensions, and the timing that was to be respected.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThereafter began the design competition which generated a very large contribution of both exterior and interior proposals and two clear winners: Benoit Jacob for the exterior design and Axel Breun for the interior. This duo was joined by an essential third party, Isabelle Charles of Colour and Trim.\n\nBenoit Jacob was a young tall, lanky Frenchman, whose hair was seldom in conference with a comb; a bit of a mad car fiend who already had some design successes under his belt and, when he eventually left Renault Design, had penned the Laguna II, the Dacia Logan and the Spider, which is quite an eclectic collection. He would later be in charge of Advanced Design at BMW.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAxel Breun was a German autodidact designer, a brilliant illustrator whose work was regularly published in the German press, whom I hired when in Volkswagen, but who later elected to migrate to Renault. He was a versatile designer who had major creative inputs in concept cars as well as production cars, like the interior of the production Vel Satis which Vladimir Lenin would probably have described as ‘palatial Bourgeois decadence’. Later, after my departure, Axel became Renault’s Design director for concept cars.\n\nAs for Isabelle she drove fast, very fast indeed, later taking part in off-road rallies. She was very communicative and an ardent defendant of her colour and trim proposals, speaking as she drove, contributing to so many projects but, if I had to choose one in her creative journey, I would choose Avantime and its rapturous colour statement.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nBenoit came up with a cute and frivolous design proposal, which bore unmistakable hints of the 4CV, but nevertheless remained an autonomous design statement, dominated by proportions that were decidedly that of a sportive two-door coupé. What with its short nose harbouring fine whiskers, apostrophe shaped headlamps and a side-view dominated by the presence of a large aluminium finished air intake, giving it an unmistakable performance touch. There was also that propulsive mischievous rump, crowned by tail-lamps that were shaped like flickering kites. That was to be an idea that was borrowed by designer, Thiérry Metroz, to also adorn the rear end of Avantime.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nFiftie’s interior was a joyous prolongation of the theme set by the exterior design, simple and charming. The seats were designed to lie down like on the Twingo, and transform our snug interior into a real cozy bed for a siesta. The seats were trimmed in cotton and linen and the whole interior was colour coordinated in a combination of a light tone beige, accompanied with touches of the exterior body colour and the presence of the aluminium chassis on the borders of the floorpan, as well as more enduring vinyl to welcome your moccasins.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe instruments, and almost all the command switches, were fitted on a centrally located vertical band in the highly simplified and perfectly flush instrument panel, into which the HiFi system, as well as the heating/air conditioning, shared a home with a telephone system. Rattan made a most welcomed appearance on the side door panels, giving the whole interior a touch of laid-back, peaceful weekends. Isabelle and Axel also proposed to integrate a picnic basket stowed in the front-mounted luggage area, which for me became a must, as it was reminiscent of the picnic hamper from Harrods, which my parents stowed in the back of our Hudson Terraplane for our regular weekend visits to the Calanques near Marseille.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAs we developed the project, there came a number of features we decided to include, like the Targa-style roof, which used four removable panels that could be stored beneath the flat-folding rear window. This feature was directly inspired by the 1946 4CV, which could be ordered with a soft top that allowed its passengers the view of low-flying seagulls when approaching the coast . . . What is happiness, we asked, but a drive with the one you love in a Fiftie?\n\nCentre-stage on the Renault stand at the 1996 Paris Motor Show, Fiftie was a success with the public, as it allowed Grandpa to contribute his recollections of his paid leave in the summer of 1947, when he drove his own, yellow butter-coloured 4CV, painted with what remained of the vast surplus of desert camouflage paint from Rommel’s Afrika Korps. Then there was the press gang who always seemed to pass in front of it with beaming smiles — the only questions they ever asked was, when would it be launched? As for us, we were happy that they were happy, but our thoughts were already concentrated on the next one, which had to be the big one . . .\n\n. . . and it was!\n\nFIFTIE Z07 : Paris October 1996\n\nDesign Project Director : Jean-François Venet\n\nDesign Engineering: Stefan Guergen\n\nDesign & Concept Car Product Planning Manager : Jean-Marie Souquet\n\nExterior designer : Benoit Jacob\n\nInterior designer : Axel Breun\n\nColour and Trim : Isabelle Charles\n\nEngine spec: D7F 4 cylinder 1149cc 60 HP at 5,250rpm\n\nDimensions : 376 x 182 x 148cm wheelbase 234cm.\n\nPhoto captions.
