Louis, the\n\n[youngest, in 1896 abandoned the draper's counter yo\n\nenter the Delaunay-Belleville establishment as a\n\ndraughtsman. The great, boiler firm at the time\n\nwas occupied solely with steam engines. In 1897\n\nLouis Renault applied to Panhard-Levassor for a posi-\n\ntion, and was bluntly informed that no amateurs were\n\nwanted. The youth induced his mother to provide\n\nhim with a small workshop adjoining the house, where\n\nhe began the construction of cars. In 1898 the fac-\n\ntory occupied an area of 230 square yards, employed\n\nsix workmen, and produced six cars within 12 months.\n\nFirst success came in 1899, when the small vehicle,\n\nwon Paris—Rambouillet, Paris—Trouville, and Paris—\n\nOstend races. Marcel Renault, five years older than\n\nhis brother Louis, abandoned the drapery establishment,\n\nfor the motor car business about this time, and took\n\ncharge of the business department, at the same time\n\nracing with the machines produced by his brother.\n\nGradually Ferdinand, the eldest of the three, be-\n\ncame interested in the business, and when Marcel\n\nwas killed in the Paris-Madrid race of 1903, he took\n\nover the management.\n\nInstead of six workmen, the Billancourt factory last\n\nyear had a staff of 2600, and an output of 5000 cars a\n\nyear. At 32 and 45 years of age respectively, the two\n\nbrothers were wealthy, both decorated with the Legion\n\nof Honour, and at the head of one of the finest indus-\n\ntrial enterprises the world can boast.\n\nThe General Motor Company, Limited, are the local\n\nrepresentatives of Renault Freres.\n\nGOULBURN, Friday.\n\nThe Amateur Bicycle Club's five miles road race this\n\nafternoon resulted:—J. Hurley, 10s, 1; E. Thorough-\n\ngood, 50s, 2; M. Hurley, scratch, 3. Points were\n\nalso awarded to the next three—W. Wilson, 50s; H.\n\nRandall, 00s; A. Gregson, 35s. Time, 11m 12s.
