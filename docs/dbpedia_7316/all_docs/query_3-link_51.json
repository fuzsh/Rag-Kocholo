This body style is hard to pull off and I don't think anybody has really done it well on this kind of platform. I agree this looks pretty shit, but I don't think that's the norm for Peugeot.\n\nmy issue is not with peugoet and their styling, which is great, my issue is with renault which seems as if they are just mimicing peugeot's styling.\n\nGilles Vidal, the Renault design VP, formely from Peugeot head desinger, might be reason why things are beginning to look similar here.\n\nmy issue is not with peugoet and their styling, which is great, my issue is with renault which seems as if they are just mimicing peugeot's styling.\n\nGilles Vidal, the Renault design VP, formely from Peugeot head desinger, might be reason why things are beginning to look similar here.\n\nAh, sorry, bit of brain fade there, I meant Renault. I was going to mention the 408 as being another example that doesn't work for me, got off track.\n\nIs this a replacement for the Arkana, or is it higher up the line-up?\n\nHigher in the lineup, flagship in fact. 200ps HEV or 300ps PHEV will be available. The awkwardly proportioned Arkana is based on the B-segment platform of the Clio/Captur.\n\nThe styling is very Peugeot, pretty uninspiring.\n\nPerhaps you meant uninspired? Indeed it's been designed under the leadership of Peugeot's ex-chief of design, but that's also why it looks so sharp and chiseled and very premium: the crisp, clear cut and finely detailed headlights and taillights, the sculpted roof, the big wheels for such a contained volume (20\" here and 21\" available later for a 4710mm overall length), virtually no bodyfat and no flat and plain body surface anywhere. Regardless of the Peugeot inspiration, I find it very inspiring per se in absolute terms, and I think it wipes the floor with most other SUV coupés out there and definitely rivals the X4 and GLC Coupé premium alternatives design-wise.\n\nHigher in the lineup, flagship in fact. 200ps HEV or 300ps PHEV will be available. The awkwardly proportioned Arkana is based on the B-segment platform of the Clio/Captur.\n\nI thought the Arkana was higher-up, since the Clio based SAV is the Captur. So the Arkana is basically a reskinned Captur?\n\nIt does sell well, around here, and actually looks descent!\n\nThe PHEV 300 version will have 2 electric motors sitting on the rear axle.\n\nWhich is a nice occasion to remember this revolutionary hybrid concept from 1995, weighing in at an unbelievable 875kg thanks to the use of carbon fiber with inputs from Aérospatiale and Pagani:\n\nChrono 115, episode 5: Back on NEXT concept-car story - Renault Group\n\nOn 18 June 1995, Renault introduced NEXT, a completely revolutionary concept car: a family hybrid vehicle with a conventional engine in the front and two electric motor-wheels at the back. It could reach a top speed of 165kph. NEXT was the creation of the “Exploratory Vehicles Unit”, which was..."
