        "text": "Though the Renault Corporation was not officially founded until 1899, it was on Christmas Eve of 1898 that Louis Renault sold his first car, following a test drive, of course.\n\nIt was called the Renault Voiturette 1CV, and, in various guises, was sold until 1903. It had a top speed of 20mph, unthinkable back in the day.\n\nBy 1908, Renault was the largest car manufacturer in France, building around 3,500 units that year. Today, the company builds around 10,000 vehicles every single day across its various brands.\n\nThough incredibly commonplace on today's roads, it wasn't until 1961, with the launch of the Renault 4, that the \"hatchback\" was first seen on European highways.\n\nThe 4 was the first two-box car that had a steeply raked rear end with a one-piece tailgate that lifted upwards.\n\nIt was originally marketed as a \"small station wagon\" by the company, until the term \"hatchback\" was coined around 1970.\n\nIntroduced in 1965, the R16 replaced the brand's larger family car, the Renault Fregat√©, to instant success.\n\nIts comfort-focused interior and brilliant practicality meant it was a huge hit with a wide range of buyers, but particularly families.\n\nProduction continued for an impressive 15 years, with Renault building more than 1.8 million units.\n\nIn the first month after going on sale, Renault only managed to sell a mere nine examples of their brand-new people carrier, the Espace.\n\nDespite this monumentally slow start, the model soon became a huge hit in its home nation, and was introduced into the UK in August 1985 where it again proved popular.\n\nWidely regarded as the first true \"MPV\", the Espace delivered unrivalled levels of practicality, space and comfort.\n\nLaunched in April 1993, the original Renault Twingo was popular in Europe until 2007. During its production run, it changed the course of the city driving forever by proving that even extremely small cars could be tremendously practical, and useful.\n\nThe Renault Twingo II was released in 2007 at the Geneva Motor Show, offering a whole new Clio-inspired design including improved safety features.\n\nThe most recent generation, launched in 2014, sported a rear-mounted engine that allowed for an impressively spacious cabin."
