        "text": "Renault 4CV\n\n1947 - 1961\n\nThe first French car to reach the 1 million sales figure, the Renault 4CV was manufactured from 1946 to 1961, it being inspired by the economy and design of the Volkswagen Beetle. During World War II and with Germany occupying France Renault was under very strict instructions to design and manufacture military and commercial vehicles. Fernand Picard, Charles-Edmond Serre and Jean-Auguste Riolfo lead the team to design a small economical motor vehicle which was suitable for the difficult years that immediately occurred post World War 2. More >>\n\nRenault Fregate\n\n1951 - 1960\n\nMost commentators of the day felt the Fregate was Renaults attempt to move \"up market\", an ambitious attempt given the company was still under the control of the French Government following its incestuous relationship with the 3rd Reich. More >>\n\nRenault Dauphine\n\n1956 - 1968\n\nThe Dauphine was, like its predecessor the 4CV, a unibody constructed vehicle. The Dauphine however, was a four door sedan with conventionally opening doors, unlike the \"suicide\" doors of the 4CV. More >>\n\nRenault Caravelle\n\n1959 - 1968\n\nRenault entered the American postwar market in 1949 with the small 4CV sedan. This car struggled with its tiny 760cc 19-bhp rear-mounted, water-cooled engine. With a top speed of around 55 mph it was almost unsalable in the US resulting in only 1400 sales in that time declining to 374 by 1952. In 1953 Renault made some changes of adding the 110 Â¼ inch wheel base, 60 bhp Fregate sedan but it was priced nearly $400 more than a Buick special, so it never got off the ground. More >>\n\nRenault 4\n\n1961 - 1993\n\nThe Renault 4 was the first car with a fifth door, and thus it was the first true hatchback. Today it remains the most produced French car ever, reaching production figures over 8,000,000... More >>\n\nRenault Alpine A110\n\n1963 - 1973\n\nIt was when Renault put a modified 1600 cc. engine borrowed from the R16 that the Alpine became a world beater, taking the first 3 places in Monte Carlo Rally in 1971 and World Rally Championships in 1971 and 1973. More >>\n\nRenault 8\n\n1963 - 1971\n\nAt the time, many journalists thought the R8 was a step backward for Renault as they had, the previous year, released the R4 with a more traditional front engine / front-wheel drive configuration. What Renault engineers banked on was the continuing popularity of rear engined cars in the European market. More >>\n\nRenault 16\n\n1964 - 1979\n\nWhen Renault introduced its model 16 in December 1964 the concept of a five-door saloon was very new. It used a rear hatchback door with fold-down rear seats and although it had awkward styling, at the time it was unique. More >>\n\nRenault 16TS\n\n1968 - 1979\n\nThe Renault engineers had done far more than simply bore the motor out a little, and the 16TS remains an object lesson in how to make something good something great. More >>\n\nRenault 6\n\n1968 - 1971\n\nThe Renault 6 was designed to supercede the Renault 4, and part of its design brief was that it should be larger, better looking and more luxurious - and thus more expensive. More >>\n\nRenault 12\n\n1969 - 1980\n\nThe Renault 12 featured very modern styling (for 1969!) which had clean, straight-cut lines featuring a classic \"3 box\" layout of four doors and a boot - however it was never as good as the Renault 16. More >>\n\nRenault 10\n\n1965 - 1971\n\nIf you took the time to take more than a casual glance at the Renault 10, you would quickly realise just how magnificiently proportioned and well engineered this wonderful car was, its sleek thoroughbred lines, its discreet touches of chrome. It was beautiful, elegant and restrained, a beauty that was so typically French. More >>\n\nRenault 5\n\n1972 - 1996\n\nIt was Renault's first supermini, and its most prominent feature was its styling by Michel Boue (who died before the car's release), which included a steeply sloping rear hatchback and front fascia. More >>\n\nRenault 16TX\n\n1973 - 1979\n\nGiven the Renault 16TS had been released in 1968, to some extent the car had dated, however the TX remained a fascinating car nevertheless. More >>\n\nRenault 30TS\n\n1975 - 1981\n\nOn April 25th, 1975 the Renault 30TS went on sale in its native France, offering more of everything than any modern Renault, and signalling to the rest of the world that the French factory intended to continue offering highly individual machinery throughout their range. More >>\n\nRenault American Alliance\n\n1982 - 1987\n\nThe Renault American Alliance was more than just a new car at its release. Indeed many considerred it to be an important political event, marking the strong return of Renault to the American market through the medium of its relationship with American Motors, which built the Alliance - an Americanized R9 - in its plant at Kenosha, Wisconsin. More >>\n\nRenault 5 Turbo\n\n1980 - 1984\n\nSet on fully exploiting their turbo image, the Regie Renault started to a modified R5 for Group 4 in 1975. Not only was the car intended to be a challenger in the World Rally Championship, it was also to be sold to the (sporting) public in detuned form, and was to embody a 'silhouette' look relevant to the front-drive/front-engined R5 hatchback so that the homme dans la rue could identify with the new car. More >>\n\nRenault Fuego\n\n1980 - 1984\n\nBy no stretch of imagination could Renault's pre 1980 coupe range be deescribed as an overwhelming success. But things were about to change, with the release of a new semi-sporting two-door series which the big French manufacturer made great efforts to combine good looks with technical refinement. More >>"
