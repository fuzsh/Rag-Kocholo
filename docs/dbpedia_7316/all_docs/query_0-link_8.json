        "text": "Renault built his first automobile in 1898. He and his brothers Fernand and Marcel then built a series of small cars and formed the automobile firm Renault Frères (“Renault Brothers”). Renault vehicles attracted much attention by winning numerous road races until Marcel was killed during a Paris-Madrid run in 1903. Renault then abandoned racing and concentrated on manufacturing. In 1918 he produced the Renault tank, which was often used as a troop-escort vehicle in the last months of World War I. He continued to increase the productive capacity of his Boulogne-Billancourt works and after the war extended his production to include farm equipment, marine and industrial machinery, and diesel motors.\n\nHis continued production of military equipment under the German occupation in World War II led to his being incarcerated after liberation on charges of collaboration. He died while awaiting trial; the Renault company was subsequently nationalized. See also Renault."
