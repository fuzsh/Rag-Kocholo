(Brief) history of Renault

Birth

The Renault company was founded in 1898 by three brothers, Louis, Marcel and Fernand Renault, initially under the name “Renault Frères”. Initially targeting a wealthy clientele, they moved into cabs, with an initial order for 250 vehicles in 1905.

The company also took part in motor racing, with the brothers (Marcel and Louis) going so far as to drive their vehicles themselves. Their successes (Marcel won the Paris-Vienne race in 1902) accelerated the company’s development.

However, Marcel was killed in a race in 1903, prompting Louis to stop racing. In 1906, Fernand retires from the company for health reasons. In 1908, Louis bought out his brothers’ shares and renamed the company Renault.

Renault and the world wars

In 1914, the company diversified, producing munitions and military aircraft. In 1917, they even developed the iconic Renault FT, said to have been“the most effective tracked armored fighting vehicle of the First World War“.

In 1922, the company opened up its capital and became a Société Anonyme.

The company then moved into agricultural and industrial machinery.

By 1928, Renault was producing 45,809 cars a year.

With the outbreak of the Second World War and the Occupation, the Renault factories were seized by the German authorities, and Prince Von Urach was put in charge. The plants were bombed by the Allies on March 3, 1942 and again in September 1943.

In August 1944, the factories were liberated, but Louis Renault was imprisoned on charges of collaboration. Ill at the time of his imprisonment, he died a month later in Fresnes prison. He was 67 years old.

The company was nationalized in 1945, becoming the “Régie Nationale des Usines Renault” with Pierre Lefaucheux at its head.

A nationalized company

Renault developed the 4CV in 1947, which was one of the first popular cars in France and a symbol of the country’s post-war modernization. It scored a number of successes in motor racing.

More than a million units were produced when it ceased production in 1961, and it was replaced by the Dauphine, of which more than 2 million were built.

In 1984, the Régie was“on the brink of the abyss“, with a deficit of 12.5 billion francs. The chairman was dismissed and replaced by Georges Besse, who was assassinated on November 17, 1986 by anAction Directe commando.

The carmaker was privatized in 1990 and floated on the stock market in 1994.
