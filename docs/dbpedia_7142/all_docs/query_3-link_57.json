The company has a dual listing with shares trading on both the London Stock Exchange and the Australian ASX.\n\nRio Tinto is named for a mining area in Spain. The mines at Rio Tinto have been in operation off and on since 3,000 BC and produce copper, silver, and gold among other minerals. The mines were rediscovered most recently in 1556 and then fell into the hands of the Spanish government in 1724. The Spanish government was a poor steward of the operations and eventually put it up for auction. In 1873 a group of businessmen bought the property for a steal that included Spain’s relinquishing its rights to any future profits.\n\nThe consortium quickly commenced operations as Rio Tinto Mining and focused on developing its resources. Within 10 years it was a leading producer of copper and then it fell into the hands of the Rothschilds. The Rothschilds expanded the operations but failed to diversify the company in a meaningful way. The company reached a peak in the early 1900s that was dashed by WWI and the loss of the US as an end market but the story is not over.\n\nA new management team took control of the business in 1925 and began to diversify the company. Their efforts opened up new territories in other countries including Africa and Australia which was instrumental to long-term success. An increasingly fascist government made it difficult to operate in Spain and led the company to divest itself of its original asset, the Rio Tinto Mine. That could not have been done without operations in other countries. Another series of mergers and acquisitions will grow the company to global status.\n\nToday, Rio Tinto is a diversified and integrated mining operation that engages in the exploration, development and production of mineral-based resources. The company operates in 4 key segments that include Iron Ore, Aluminum, Copper & Diamonds and Energy & Minerals. The company operates mines, smelters and refiners in about 35 countries producing iron ore and iron, bauxite and alumina, industrial diamonds, gold, borates, titanium dioxide and lithium among many other minerals and products. The bulk of operations are in Australia and Canada which are both rich in natural resources.\n\nThe company’s products are used by all end markets and are essential for the transition to green energy. Not only is the iron and copper required to build the infrastructure but lithium and other minerals are key for electrification. Rio Tinto products are necessary for agriculture and include several key fertilizers including borates.\n\nWritten by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\n\nRead More\n\nRIO Stock News Headlines\n\nSee More Headlines\n\nReceive RIO Stock News and Ratings via Email\n\nSign-up to receive the latest news and ratings for Rio Tinto Group and its competitors with MarketBeat's FREE daily newsletter.\n\nEmail Address\n\nCompany Calendar\n\nLast Earnings\n\n2/23/2022\n\nToday\n\n8/16/2024\n\nEx-Dividend for 9/26 Dividend\n\n8/16/2024\n\nEx-Dividend for 9/26 Dividend\n\n8/16/2024\n\nDividend Payable\n\n9/26/2024\n\nDividend Payable\n\n9/26/2024\n\nFiscal Year End\n\n12/31/2024\n\nIndustry, Sector and Symbol\n\nSector\n\nBasic Materials\n\nIndustry\n\nMetal mining\n\nSub-Industry\n\nMetals & Mining\n\nCurrent Symbol\n\nNYSE:RIO\n\nPrevious Symbol\n\nNYSE:RTP\n\nCUSIP\n\nN/A\n\nCIK\n\n863064\n\nPhone\n\n442077812000\n\nFax\n\n44-20-7781-1800\n\nEmployees\n\n57,000\n\nYear Founded\n\n1873\n\nProfitability\n\nTrailing P/E Ratio\n\nN/A\n\nForward P/E Ratio\n\n8.28\n\nP/E Growth\n\n0.35\n\nNet Income\n\nN/A\n\nNet Margins\n\nN/A\n\nPretax Margin\n\nN/A\n\nReturn on Equity\n\nN/A\n\nReturn on Assets\n\nN/A\n\nDebt\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio\n\n0.23\n\nCurrent Ratio\n\n1.70\n\nQuick Ratio\n\n1.16\n\nSales & Book Value\n\nAnnual Sales\n\n$54.18 billion\n\nPrice / Sales\n\n1.42\n\nCash Flow\n\n$13.24 per share\n\nPrice / Cash Flow\n\n4.63\n\nBook Value\n\n$45.03 per share\n\nPrice / Book\n\n1.36\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nOutstanding Shares\n\n1,252,575,000\n\nFree Float\n\nN/A\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$76.78 billion\n\nOptionable\n\nOptionable\n\nBeta\n\n0.67\n\nSocial Links\n\nClick the link below and we'll send you MarketBeat's guide to investing in electric vehicle technologies (EV) and which EV stocks show the most promise.\n\nGet This Free Report\n\nKey Executives\n\nMr. Jakob Stausholm M.S.
