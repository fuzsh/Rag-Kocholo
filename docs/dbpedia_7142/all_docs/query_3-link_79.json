        "text": "Synopsis\n\nNovelis, the international subsidiary of Hindalco Industries, could bid for the rolled products division of global metals major Rio Tinto Alcan as the Aditya Birla Group seeks to buy high value manufacturing products in Europe and the US.\n\nMUMBAI: Novelis, the international subsidiary of Hindalco Industries, could bid for the rolled products division of global metals major Rio Tinto Alcan as the Aditya Birla Group seeks to buy high value manufacturing products in Europe and the US.\n\nThe rolled products division of Rio Tinto Alcan is valued at about $3 billion, according to international brokerages. Mining and metals major Rio Tinto Alcan had annual revenue of $41 billion last year of which the aluminium business contributed $12 billion. It has plants in the US and France and is an established world leader in the aerospace market.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the development, the Aditya Birla Group is currently evaluating the possibility of bidding. If it decides to bid, it will likely compete with aggressive metals investment fund Apollo Global Management and possible suitors such as Kaiser Aluminium. The Birlas are also looking at options such as owning less than 100% of the rolled products division.\n\nA French newspaper recently reported that Apollo could take 51%, while French strategic investment firm FSI could own up to 10%. Rio Tinto Alcan would then retain the remaining 39%.\n\nRio Tinto Alcan has been selling assets to repay debt raised to acquire Canada’s Alcan for $38 billion in 2007. Early this year it sold its packaging business for $1.2 billion. A Hindalco spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. An email sent to Rio Tinto Alcan also did not elicit any response.\n\nHindalco MD Debu Bhattacharya had earlier spoken about the advantages of owning upstream assets in Asia and Africa — typically bauxite mines and alumina refineries — and in acquiring advanced smelting technology from the West. Such a move would insulate Hindalco from strong price fluctuations in bauxite and aluminium products, he had said.\n\nNovelis was acquired in 2007 by Hindalco with the same principles in mind, as the Atlanta-based company is a leader in rolling metals for beverage cans. The acquisition catapulted Mumbai-based Hindalco into the ranks of the world’s top five producers with clients such as Coke and Pepsi.\n\nBidding for the rolled products unit would not pose any anti-trust concerns for Novelis as the Atlanta-based unit does not make products for aerospace. European and US regulations generally do not allow companies gain a near monopoly position in any industry. One of Novelis’ likely rivals, the investment fund Apollo, owns Noranda Aluminium Holding Corp with alumina refining, smelting and rolled product assets.\n\nOne advantage for Novelis, should it decide to bid aggressively, is familiarity with Alcan’s systems and processes. Novelis had been spun out of Alcan and many executives at the Atlanta-based company are its former employees.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nHNIs invested in Piramal PMS.
