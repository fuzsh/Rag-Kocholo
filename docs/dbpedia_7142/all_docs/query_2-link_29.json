Im in a good earning job paying zero rent so i have a fair bit of disposable income..but doing a few figures Its got me buggered how your average Joe paying a mortgage,2-3kids can afford to buy a $90k boat new like I see a few people doing+ being able to afford to go fishing every weekend.when you sit down and look hard at what catching a fish would cost you per week it starts to get scary. is $300 a week worth the effort? makes you realise",
