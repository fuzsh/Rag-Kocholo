        "text": "By Chuck Stinnett\n\nRio Tinto Alcan intends to sell its nearly 500-employee Sebree aluminum smelter here at some point, the international mining company announced.\n\nThe Sebree smelter is one of 13 facilities that parent company Rio Tinto characterized Sunday as being \"non-core assets,\" meaning they are no longer part of the company's strategic plan.\n\nSix Australian and New Zealand aluminum facilities will be rolled into a new company, to be called Pacific Aluminum, that will eventually be sold.\n\nRio Tinto Alcan will continue to operate Sebree and the six other properties ? including three specialty alumina plants and an alumina refinery in France and Germany as well as an aluminum smelter and a power plant at Lynemouth, England ? \"while it further investigates divestment options,\" the company said Sunday evening.\n\nThe Lynemouth smelter and power plant potentially could be closed, it said.\n\nBut a similar fate isn't envisioned at Sebree.\n\n\"Sebree has been identified for divestment,\" Rio Tinto Alcan spokesman Bryan Tucker said in email message, adding, \"we do not believe that Sebree is at risk of shutdown at this point in time. We just modernized the baking furnace\" ? a $37 million investment ? \"and the plant has a flexible power contract.\"\n\n\"The assets identified for divestment are sound businesses that are well-managed with productive workforces. But they are no longer aligned with our strategy and we believe they have a bright future under new ownership,\" Rio Tinto CEO Tom Albanese said in a statement.\n\nThe company wants to \"develop and operate top-tier, long-life, low-cost assets,\" according to Tucker. \"Sebree is a sound, well-managed plant with a productive workforce and we believe it will have a solid future under new owners with different strategies.\"\n\nIt's anyone's guess who a new owner for the Sebree smelter might be; the possibilities range from one of the few remaining aluminum producers to a private equity firm. Spokesmen for two aluminum companies ? Alcoa (which operates the Warrick Works across the river at Newburgh, Ind.) and Century Aluminum (which operates a smelter at Hawesville, Ky.) ? declined comment, citing corporate policy to not comment on speculation about acquisitions.\n\nA spokesman at the international headquarters of the United Steelworkers of America, which represents hourly workers at the Sebree plant, said the union has no comment on the announcement yet.\n\nThe sale of the Sebree smelter and other plants may not be immediate. \"The strength of our balance sheet means that we can choose the most opportune method and timing to divest these assets, which may not occur until the economic climate improves,\" Albanese said. \"In the meantime, we will continue to run these operations safely and efficiently.\n\n\"This move is a further significant step towards achieving our performance targets in the aluminum product group,\" he continued. \"We have already made good progress, with plans in place to generate sustainable performance improvement, and we are investing at a number of our core assets.\"\n\nRio Tinto would retain some Alcan plants, notably the hydroelectric-power smelters in Canada.\n\n\"We are already well on our way to building a truly outstanding aluminium business,\" said Jacynthe Cote, CEO of Rio Tinto Alcan, which is the aluminum division of Rio Tinto. \"Streamlining the product group allows Rio Tinto Alcan to concentrate its efforts even more on driving performance improvements and investing in growth to increase shareholder value.\"\n\nThe announcement opens the latest chapter in the often-uncertain life of the nearly 40-year-old smelter.\n\nThe former Anaconda Aluminum plant opened in 1973 with bright hopes. But its outlook dimmed in the 1980s, largely because power supplier Big Rivers Electric Corp. began raising its rates to pay for a power plant in turned out to not need. That hurt the Sebree plant's ability to compete with smelters that used cheap hydroelectric power in Canada and elsewhere.\n\nMontreal-based Alcan Aluminum purchased the smelter from then-owner ARCO Metals in 1985, but only because Alcan wanted to buy 40 percent of a new aluminum rolling mill in Logan County, Ky., and ARCO insisted that the Sebree smelter be part of the deal.\n\nThe Sebree plant's fortunes hit a low ebb in 1986, when a strike took place after the company sought wage and benefit concessions from union workers to compensate for high power costs. One aluminum production potline had already been closed at the time; Alcan shut a second potline when the strike began, leaving it operating at only one-third capacity.\n\nEventually, the strike was settled and the aluminum market rebounded, and the Sebree smelter has operated for most of the past two decades with all three potlines in operation.\n\nNew concerns arose a few years ago. As part of its financial restructuring, Big Rivers had leased its power plants to a subsidiary of Louisville-based E.ON U.S. The lease proved to be a big money-loser for E.ON, which offered to pay Big Rivers nearly $400 million to unwind the deal.\n\nAlcan insisted that the unwind, which included a new contract and a more favorable price for electricity, was crucial to its smelter's survival. But the city of Henderson and Henderson Municipal Power and Light ? which own one of the power plants involved in the lease ? refused for more than a year to approve the unwind because of a variety of issues.\n\nThe unwind was finally settled in mid-2009, and the Sebree smelter's future looked brighter than it had in years. In early 2010, Gov. Steve Beshear announced that Rio Tinto planned to invest $50 million at the plant to boost efficiency and productivity.\n\nStill, a cloud hung over Rio Tinto Alcan. Many analysts questioned whether Rio Tinto ? an international mining company with headquarters in the United Kingdom and Australia ? had overspent when it paid $38 billion to acquire Alcan Inc. in 2007, just before recession struck. It has been selling businesses and cutting costs ever since to reduce debt.\n\nLast December, Rio Tinto revealed that it planned to sell some of the Alcan aluminum smelters and bauxite refineries ? \"smaller, older assets that exist in the portfolio that maybe don't have much upside in terms of expandibility or extension of life,\" in the words of Rio Tinto chief financial officer Guy Elliott.\n\nThe Sebree smelter once had plans for adding a fourth potline ? a gravel footprint for the planned building was added years ago ? but Alcan long ago abandoned any notion of such an expansion because of power costs."
