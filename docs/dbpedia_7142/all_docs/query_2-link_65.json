        "text": "Instilling care, courage and curiosity at Rio Tinto\n\nRio Tinto’s Didier Arseguel carries significant responsibility for the mining giant as Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium’s vice president, technology. He’s in charge of tech, R&D and innovation worldwide, as well as one of the company’s major decarbonization streams. But the French native – who has been in Canada since 2012, and actually prefers Québec winters to his homeland’s – also dedicates time to Rio Tinto’s newcomers.\n\n“This fall,” says Arseguel, “I will be speaking with our graduate program’s North American cohort about my role in the company, and answering any questions they may have. It’s an important part of the program to have senior leaders do that. Part of my job is to ensure that things keep going well here, and the new grads – future leaders, with different perspectives from a different generation – are absolutely crucial.”\n\nRio Tinto’s two-year graduate program is open about the challenges that recent university grads face. The first sentence in the program guide welcomes young people to a “volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment (VUCA),” before moving directly to providing insight into “the Rio Tinto strategy and how we live our values and behaviours.” Those values – care, courage and curiosity – infuse the program and help attract the future leaders Rio Tinto wants.\n\nSarah-Lee Fortin entered the graduate program in 2018, and is now a strategic project advisor reporting directly to Arseguel, who calls her “my right hand.” For someone like the Laval chemical engineering grad, who has a strong sense of curiosity and love of travel, Rio Tinto had much to offer.\n\n“There were rotations within the base site, Sorel-Tracy in Québec in my case, in the first year,” Fortin says, “and six months in South Africa during the second.” The travel certainly caught the eye of Fortin, who will begin a two-year stint back in South Africa early in 2024, but so did the variety of job experience to be gained.\n\n“Different plants, different processes, different countries – there was a lot to learn and discover,” says Fortin. “I was hired as a full-time permanent employee, except there was more time dedicated to focusing on my development, paired with great exposure opportunities. Together, it was a very attractive program, a really good fit with my personal interests.”\n\nOutside the graduate program, Rio Tinto also matches its employees’ values through community engagement policies that can be tailored to individual interests. A recognition program rewards exemplary employees with tokens, which they can give to selected local organizations of their choice. And then there’s the prospect of what Arseguel calls “the challenging but fantastically interesting” task of decarbonizing operations.\n\nBut for newcomers like Fortin, the grad program matters most, citing the mentoring she received during her two years in the program. “There were a lot of important conversations about our corporate values, professional engineering values and the situations where they have to be applied.”\n\nAnd the program is significant for Rio Tinto itself, Arseguel says, circling back to his session with the North American grads. “This communication we’re talking about doesn’t work one way only. Our program participants, they care, their curiosity is very high. And their courage? They ask questions that other people may not ask. From the company side, we just have to ensure that we listen, we take care of them and we bring them to their full potential.”\n\nRio Tinto encourages employees to open every door\n\nAmra Basic, vice president, people, at Rio Tinto, began her 17-year career with the company in Salt Lake City, moved to its U.K. headquarters, then back to Utah before coming to Montréal. So she has every personal as well as professional reason to say employees can “wander the world with Rio Tinto.” It’s even possible, she adds, to do that within a hub like Montréal.\n\n“Many of our people in Montréal support not just our Canadian operations, but some are performing entirely global roles,” Basic says. “We are unique here in providing opportunities that go beyond helping us make Rio Tinto stronger in Canada.\n\n“There are opportunities to work with other hubs like Brisbane in Australia or our headquarters in London – Montréal is a great place for cross-pollination and talent development.”\n\nEven the Montréal offices have been reshaped for collaboration, encounters with different teams and chances to learn new aspects of the business. “We have a space for everyone: brainstorming areas and open desk spaces that encourage teamwork and collaboration, inspiration rooms, conversation spaces, quiet corners when in need of deep concentration, and access to the technology to keep people connected virtually,” says Basic.\n\nRio Tinto’s framework for talent management strongly encourages employees to articulate their career and development goals, and provides ample opportunity to explore them. That, in turn, is a powerful force not just in retention but also in recruitment, says Tania D’Amico, performance and value lead, Northern Hemisphere, with Rio Tinto Safe Production System.\n\n“I had worked in other industries previously – pharmaceuticals and aerospace – and what attracted me to Rio Tinto six years ago was they were just starting their internal consulting group,” D’Amico says. “I thought it was really brave and bold to move towards internal consulting at a time when there was a lot of outside consulting happening in other industries.\n\n“It meant using teams of their own people, not outsiders, to consider issues, and that offered access to different cultures, ways of work and leadership styles, plus opportunities to work with different commodities,” she adds. “It meant people moving around, whether inside the Montréal hub or to other sites. And every leader I’ve had really pushed the personal development front.”\n\nRio Tinto’s ultimate goal is to attract, develop and maintain a strong talent pipeline, says Basic, pointing to the company’s holistic approach to employee health, safety and well-being, and the broad spectrum of benefits the company offers. “If we want to stay in business and attract the best, we have to make sure that people are excited to come back to work the next day.”\n\nHence the continuous development focus, which includes structured training programs, coaching, mentoring, job sharing, opportunities to work on cross-disciplinary projects, and regional and global assignments that involve moving to another country for a period of time.\n\n“The only way we can deliver on our performance is when people are engaged and performing to their full potential,” Basic says, “and this is when both company and employee can thrive.”\n\nFor D’Amico, Rio Tinto’s approach enriches the employee experience just as much. “What I tell people about working here is that, if you have a passion for learning and continuous improvement, if you have a growth mindset and want access to new things, this is the right company for you. It will expose you to so many opportunities.”\n\nAnd even, literally or figuratively, move you around the planet."
