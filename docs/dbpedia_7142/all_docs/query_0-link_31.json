        "text": "Rio Tinto confirmed Tuesday its decision to axe a revamp of its high-cost Gove alumina refinery in Australia's Northern Territory, also saying for a second time in as many months that the plant's future was again under review.\n\nThe company, however, plans to continue its bauxite mining operations at Gove.\n\n\"Rio Tinto will be consulting with employees and the community in the coming weeks, and will advise all stakeholders about its [Gove refinery] decision at the earliest opportunity,\" spokesman Bruce Tobin said.\n\nIn the meantime, there will be no change to refining operations until a decision on the future of the refinery has been made, Tobin said.\n\nRio Tinto announced in February plans to convert the 2.65 million mt/year alumina refinery to gas, from heavy fuel oil. Converting the refinery to gas would significantly improve the facility's cost position, and help underpin its long-term operating life, the company had said earlier.\n\nTobin said on Tuesday, however, that the gas conversion project will no longer proceed due to continuing low alumina prices, a high exchange rate and substantial after-tax losses for the refinery.\n\nIn September, Rio Tinto subsidiary Pacific Aluminium had warned local staff that the Gove refinery's future was once again being reviewed following a reduced offer of subsidized gas from the Northern Territory government.\n\n\"In February 2013, the Northern Territory government committed to release 300 petajoules of gas from Power and Water Corp.'s contract with Eni for on-sale to Gove refinery. [But] since then, the Northern Territory government has announced it is prepared to offer 175 petajoules of gas,\" Pacific Aluminium spokesman Anthony Havers said at the time.\n\nRio Tinto called off in August its planned divestment of Pacific Aluminium, and subsequently reintegrated the unit into the Rio Tinto Alcan group.\n\nThe mine at Gove can turn out more than 8.2 million mt/year of bauxite."
