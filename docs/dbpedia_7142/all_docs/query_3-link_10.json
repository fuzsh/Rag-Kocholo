        "text": "LONDON â€” Rio Tinto, the British-Australian mining company, has agreed to buy the Canadian aluminum company Alcan for $38.1 billion, the two companies said Thursday.\n\nIt is a deal that analysts say reflects growing global demand for mineral commodities amid only marginal growth in supply.\n\nThe offer far exceeds the $28 billion hostile bid by Alcoa that the Alcan board rejected in May. The acquisition would create the world's largest aluminum company.\n\nIn a joint statement, Rio Tinto and Alcan said that Rio Tinto was offering $101 per share for Alcan in an all-cash deal and that Alcan's board was recommending the offer to shareholders.\n\nPaul Skinner, Rio Tinto's chairman, said, \"This transaction combines two leading and complementary aluminum businesses, and is a further step in Rio Tinto's strategy of creating shareholder value through investing in high-quality, large-scale, low-cost and long-life assets in attractive sectors.\"\n\nUnder the deal, a new company named Rio Tinto Alcan would be based in Montreal and would be \"a new global leader in the aluminum industry with large, long life, low cost assets worldwide,\" the companies said. The new company would be headed by Alcan's chief executive, Richard Evans.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
