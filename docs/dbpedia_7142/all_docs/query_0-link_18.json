        "text": "State-owned power generator Meridian Energy of New Zealand announced last week that Rio Tinto has approached it to renegotiate the electricity contract for its aluminium smelter at Bluff. The business unit of Rio Tinto that approached Meridian was Pacific Aluminium, the majority shareholder of New Zealand Aluminium Smelters. NZAS is New Zealand’s only aluminium smelter and is located on the Tiwai Peninsula. It alone accounts for 15% of New Zealand’s total electricity consumption. The move comes at a time when Rio is assessing the commercial viability of the smelter in face of soaring input costs(mainly energy), falling prices, and industry overcapacity. A strengthening New Zealand dollar is adding to Rio’s woes.\n\nSee Full Analysis for Rio Tinto Here\n\nWhat triggered the move\n\nThe contract to be renegotiated was concluded in 2007 and would have come into force in January next year. Under the contract, Rio’s take or pay obligations will rise from 543.75 megawatts annually at present to 572MW annually, with the electricity price calculated on a formula that takes into account exchange rates and global aluminium prices. We believe that paying the price for power as stipulated in the contract is no longer possible for Rio as it battles a prolonged slump in the aluminium market. Also, Rio decided to cut production by 15% in July at this smelter so its energy requirements would be less but the company would still end up paying for the higher quantity negotiated in the contract. The NZAS smelter was put up for sale last year but looking at the slump in the market, Rio is in no hurry to sell at the moment. Although NZAS reported a $46 million after-tax profit last year, that was only due to a one-off $65.9 million settlement of a long-standing insurance claim. Without that claim, it would have reported a second year of losses in the region of $20 million.\n\nAluminium business blues\n\nRio shut down its Lynemouth aluminium smelter in the UK at the end of March this year. Aluminium prices fell 20% last year and a further 15% in the first half of 2012. Rio has stated that it is not going to keep operating businesses that are not commercially viable. Another smelter in Bell Bay, Australia was in danger of being shut down but a 13 year power subsidy agreement with the Tasmanian government prevented it. Rio seems to be adopting the same strategy with NZAS. Some time back, Rio transferred its Australian and New Zealand assets into a new business group known as Pacific Aluminium, which was managed separately from the Rio Tinto Alcan group to which these assets originally belonged. This was done with the express purpose of divestment as Rio no longer saw these units as being aligned with its business strategy.\n\nGoing forward\n\nWe believe that the company’s aluminium business needs to be downsized given its drag on profits. The underlying earnings for the business, which excludes the Pacific Aluminium group, dropped by 93% to $24 million year-over-year.\n\nAs a whole, the company has a strong long-term demand outlook and is expecting the Chinese economy to grow by approximately 8% in 2012. The management attributes this optimism to its expectation that the stimulus measures announced by the Chinese government in the second quarter will start flowing through to infrastructure investment in the next few months. This, we believe, is quite likely, given that the latest inflation numbers in China fell to 1.7%. This will provide room for more monetary stimulus to support growth, even though the effects may only be visible in the future. Despite negative macroeconomic sentiments in Europe and a nascent US economic recovery, Rio’s order books are full. Rio Tinto seems to be banking on its superior asset base and the high quality of its growth pipeline to deliver future benefits.\n\nAluminium constitutes a small portion of Rio’s business so we don’t expect problems in this segment to have a significant impact on the company’s valuation.\n\nUnderstand How a Company’s Products Impact its Stock at Trefis"
