        "text": "UNSUSTAINABLE:\n\n2 | Unsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto\n\nTo maximize profits, Rio Tinto needs a social license to operate. Its ability to exploit the next great mineral deposit could be compromised without one. It is no surprise that Rio Tinto spends millions of dollars every year to portray itself as a socially responsible company that respects its stakeholders.\n\nHowever, the facts tell otherwise. “Unsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto” examines Rio Tinto’s claims that it operates in a sustainable matter.\n\nThe company breaks what it calls its sustainable development strategy into four categories: Environment, Economic, Social, Governance. However, their claims about their performance in those categories are contradicted by the facts.\n\nSocial\n\nRio Tinto claims they are building enduring relationships and a zero harm culture.\n\nFACTS\n\n40 workers were killed at Rio Tinto fully or partially owned operations in 2013. In the case of a disaster in Indonesia that killed 28 of the workers, a national human rights commission found it could have been avoided. Over one-third of the company’s workforce is continually exposed to work noise levels at which hearing loss can be predicted.\n\nEconomic\n\nRio Tinto claims they are creating prosperity for their stakeholders.\n\nFACTS\n\nRio Tinto took huge losses on its investment in Mozambique, while at the same time forcing people off their land. Rio Tinto took huge losses on its Alcan acquisition, while at the same time laying off thousands of workers and provoking a costly labour dispute.\n\nEnvironment\n\nRio Tinto claims they are managing valuable natural resources and addressing global challenges.\n\nFACT In a single month last year, Rio Tinto had uranium spills at both of its uranium operations.\n\nGovernance\n\nRio Tinto claims they are maintaining high standards of responsibility and accountability.\n\nFACTS Rio Tinto said it would seek free, prior and informed consent from communities before mining. However, affected communities say otherwise. Rio Tinto says that closure costs of its operations represent a significant financial liability, however they publish little detail on how they calculate those liabilities.\n\nRio Tinto’s blind pursuit of profit at any cost has caused disputes with numerous unions as well as environmental, community and indigenous groups. IndustriALL Global Union has launched a campaign working with civil society organizations to defend against Rio Tinto’s abuses. This report, “Unsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto” (industriall-union. org/riotinto) is part of that effort.\n\nThe report should be read by Rio Tinto stakeholders including workers, members of communities where Rio Tinto operates or plans to operate, regulatory agencies, elected officials, civil society organizations as well as shareholders and others in the investment community.\n\nThrough demonstrating that Rio Tinto does not operate in a sustainable manner, our aim is to force the company to live by its own claims.\n\nUnsustainable:\n\nthe ugly truth about Rio Tinto\n\n4 | Unsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto\n\nSocial\n\nRio Tinto claims to be building enduring relationships and a zero harm culture. The evidence points to the contrary.\n\nLabour Relations\n\nRio Tinto reports that it has made voluntary commitments to the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global Compact. Both of these recognize the fundamental right of workers to establish and join trade unions. But Rio Tinto’s actual approach to labour relations is underpinned by what the company calls “direct engagement”. This principle frames unions as an undesirable third party in the employer-employee relationship.\n\nIn a formal submission to a government review of Australian labour law in 2012, Rio Tinto declares that it “is committed to establishing a direct relationship with every employee as a foundation from which to build employee engagement irrespective of the employment arrangement under which the employee has been employed”. In a further elaboration of the principle of direct engagement, a senior Rio Tinto executive claimed that “legislation must take account of the need for ‘direct engagement between management and the work force’ and that it is best to limit ‘the influence of third parties in areas of the business in particular that are more properly the province of management.” 2\n\nPrior to the recent government review, Rio Tinto used previous Australian labour legislation to advance various forms of individual contracts over union collective agreements. Rio Tinto was successful in using these strategies to deunionise much of its Australian workforce.\n\nRio Tinto’s deunionization drive and general anti-union approach creates conflictual relations with unions that continue to represent its workers both in Australia and abroad. They have also provoked numerous strong responses from unions under attack by the company.\n\nIndustriALL affiliate the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) endured a bitter dispute with Rio Tinto in 2010 at a Borax mine in southern California, USA. Rio Tinto attempted to impose new precarious contracts on workers that would have increased overtime, scrap the seniority system in place at the time and give managers discretion to cut jobs and hours. After the ILWU put the issue to a vote that unanimously rejected the new conditions, workers who turned up for work the next day found they were\n\nlocked out by the company. The ILWU mounted a successful global campaign that forced Rio Tinto to relent.\n\nIn 2012 Rio Tinto locked out 780 workers at an aluminium smelter in Alma, Quebec. Workers were effectively being punished for rejecting management attempts to halve salaries and outsource the workforce. The lock-out lasted for six months, but after taking on Rio Tinto and tarnishing the company’s image in its connection with the London Olympics, the United Steelworkers union was able to get the company to back down from its extreme demands.\n\nIndustriALL affiliate the Australian Workers’ Union scored a historic victory by winning back collective bargaining rights at the Bell Bay aluminum smelter in 2013 after a multi-year organizing drive that Rio Tinto fought hard against.\n\nIn New Zealand, IndustriALL affiliate the New Zealand Engineering, Printing & Manufacturing Union brought a case to the courts that involved New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited, a Rio Tinto Alcan majority owned smelter. The company was ordered to pay back workers owed annual leave that they were legally entitled to but never received.\n\nIn Mongolia, a Rio Tinto worker was dismissed for protesting against discrimination over the remuneration paid to Mongolian employees. The unequal remuneration between Mongolian nationals and expatriates employed by Rio Tinto translated into a disparity of MNT 3 million for local Mongolian, to MNT 30 million for expatriates a month on average. The Ministry of Labour confirmed at the time that Rio Tinto was in violation of the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement “in the most blatant, wanton manner and never made a single step towards enforcing this obligation”. Following similar rulings by two lower courts, the Supreme Court ruled that the termination of the employee was unjust and unlawful.\n\nDespite strong fightbacks from unions, Rio Tinto’s abuse of workers and their unions as well as the attendant polarization of labour relations continues. Rio Tinto has a particularly bad record in increasing the use of precarious work and then abusing precarious workers.\n\nIn August 2013, Redpath Mongolia, a contractor that employs workers at Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine, fired about 1,700 workers. The reason for firing the workers was never disclosed but was apparently linked to revenue sharing of the mine with the government of Mongolia, and other terms of the investment agreement. Turquoise Hill Resources, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, announced on 12 August 2013 that until “matters can be resolved with the Mongolian government and a new timetable has been agreed”, the funding and development of the\n\n2 ABC Lateline, 18/09/\n\nUnsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto | 5\n\nmine’s underground expansion would be delayed. Redpath Mongolia was involved in the building of the underground portion of the mine.\n\nUnions representing Rio Tinto employees in North America report that Rio Tinto is continuously seeking for ways to contract out work. Contracted out work is often more precarious and with less pay and benefits than direct employment. Unions in North America believe that Rio Tinto attempts to contract out more work in order to shrink the number of employees the unions represent and thereby weaken the unions so they have less bargaining power with Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto’s drive to contract out more work has been a primary contributing factor in labour disputes in the U. and Canada.\n\nPrecarious work in Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, Rio Tinto’s approach to unions and to precarious work is evident in its handling of the dispute with IndustriALL Global Union affiliate, the Fédération des Syndicats des Travailleurs de l’Energie et des Mines (FISEMA). QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) is majority owned by Rio Tinto. Since the end of 2008, the joint venture has been producing ilmenite near Fort Dauphin, in southern Madagascar.\n\nIn July 2013, QMM ended its contract with the security company OMEGA Risk Solutions and opted for two cheaper security companies. 300 workers were collectively dismissed with merely one month’s notice. When FISEMA tried to engage in dialogue with QMM regarding the dismissal, the company refused.\n\nIn August 2013, a regional tripartite labour committee was established to facilitate dialogue between the workers and OMEGA. Astoundingly, QMM was not represented as an employer but acted as one of the mediators.\n\nA proposal was made that 85 per cent of the dismissed workers would be hired by the new security companies. It was also proposed that the remaining workers would have access to relevant training.\n\nThe dismissed workers who were hired by the new security companies are earning 20 per cent less than they were earning when employed by OMEGA. No training has yet been provided to the remaining workers, and many of these workers are today unemployed.\n\nDialogue between the workers and OMEGA has ended and OMEGA is no longer present in Fort Dauphin. FISEMA has tried to make an appeal to the Labour Inspectorate and the Labour Court, only to be given the answer that as the employer, OMEGA, is absent there is no possibility of appeal.\n\nWorkers’ health\n\nRio Tinto’s 2013 Annual report carries a headline message of a new corporate mission to “turn our safety performance around.” This follows 40 reported deaths at fully or partially owned Rio Tinto operations in 2013. However, their report contains unsubstantiated claims and refers to unreported data.\n\nRio Tinto presents limited information on the health of their workers. Their health and safety data is constructed using four metrics– the All Injury Frequency Rate, Lost-Time Injury Rate, Fatalities and new Occupational Illnesses. It is presented with some unsubstantiated narrative on corporate-aspirational targets on improvement.\n\nThere is no evidence that Rio Tinto’s management culture encourages the full reporting of health and safety data. On the contrary, a number of unions at Rio Tinto report that management creates a culture of fear by punishing people for getting hurt. As a result people are afraid to report their injuries at work, and so health and safety problems go unaddressed.\n\nTargets referred to in company reports – on a 30 per cent reduction of new occupational illnesses and on a 10 per cent reduction in workers exposed to dangerous noise levels, and on the general “zero harm” target – have no credible account of how Rio Tinto will seek to achieve them. The Sustainable Development Report seems to hope for change based on “building a culture” which involves “workers’ ownership of their own safety”.\n\nRio Tinto’s focus on workers being responsible for their own safety is reflected in the company’s approach to silica dust at its operations in Labrador, Canada. The union representing Rio Tinto employees there reports that the company provides outdated dust collectors, puts a low priority on clean-up, and did away with the onsite full-time health and safety manger. The union reports the company instead focuses on forcing workers to wear masks that the workers find it nearly impossible to work with. Silica dust exposure can result in silicosis and cancer.\n\nEvaluation of performance with regard to targets requires more disaggregated information than Rio Tinto provides. Occupational diseases are notoriously under- recognized, under-diagnosed and under-reported. Rio Tinto’s claim of radically reduced numbers of new cases of occupational illness per 10,000 employees over the space of five years, when many of the most serious occupational diseases take many years to develop and even longer to present symptoms, is simply not credible without extensive explanation.\n\nThe “Semi Quantitative Risk Assessment” which Rio Tinto reports to be in use implies a subjective\n\nUnsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto | 7\n\nUS government cables in 2009 revealed by wikileaks in 2012 reported that under the 2009 Investment Agreement, Rio Tinto got its required flexibility on “labour, technology, taxes and other issues”. GOM officials moved through parliament essential law changes on roads, taxation and water, including by amending laws to allow Rio Tinto to abstract ground- water.\n\nAs part of the development of the mine, from 2004 onwards some of the herders had been moved off their land and away from their traditional seasonal ranges and watering sources. At that point safeguard protections of the World Bank, a lender to the project, were officially triggered.\n\nRio Tinto was mandated to produce an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) as a result of seeking billions of dollars in loan finance and political risk insurance from development banks and export guarantee agencies. After the ESIA was published in late 2012, the US government [USG] decided to abstain on a vote to provide support for the project partly based on environmental policy concerns. This was consistent with NGO claims that the ESIA was inadequate with vital information completely missing or undeveloped, and that it dealt only with the construction phase of the project. The USG and NGOs shared concerns about water issues and the treatment of herders.\n\nThere have also been two “donor/client” independent project audits in connection with the banks’ loans and insurance for the project. The first audit in January 2013 reviewed information including non-public reports, and found with varying degrees of certainty that there are three areas where herders’ water resources have been lost or damaged in the west and north of the mine, and that nothing in the management plans provides a mechanism for promptly addressing this critical and widespread problem. It criticised the failure to make available a report on hydrogeologic conditions at the mine-site.\n\nThe latest audit published in February 2014 deals with a period when Rio Tinto continued to mine the open- pit and transport concentrates over dust roads but had shut down construction of the deep mine shafts. The shutdown resulted in 1700 workers employed by contractor Redpath being rapidly laid-off in August. The audit states that Rio Tinto failed to provide a mandatory advance notification to the Lenders of such a large-scale retrenchment.\n\nThis latest audit criticised Rio Tinto’s management approach as inadequate because it did not “reflect a precautionary approach”. The 2013 Operational Management Plans failed to provide any detailed assessment of how the operation manages acid- rock drainage. The wastes from the continuing excavation\n\nof two shafts were not being assessed effectively for potential acid generation, overall acid/base accounting was not sufficiently detailed, and potential acid generating rock was not being dumped adequately.\n\nNomadic herders are fighting back in the face of threats to their water and pastures. The herders filed complaints to the World Bank about their displacement and about the diversion of the seasonal Undai river. They remain frustrated with the slow pace and lack of commitment by the company to review and address their inadequate compensation program.\n\nGovernance\n\nRio Tinto claims to maintain high standards of responsibility and accountability, and that its reputation for acting responsibly plays a critical role in its success as a business. But closer scrutiny reveals a company that deserves a reputation for being irresponsible.\n\nClosure\n\nRio Tinto state rightly that closure costs represent a significant financial liability with total provisions amounting to $8 billion. There is no published information on how the total figure is comprised. They don’t give any information on mandatory bonds posted during the life of mines. Net Present Value formulae said by Rio Tinto to calculate future liabilities as an approach to meeting future responsibilities for closure and post-closure monitoring are unrevealed and may under-provide for meeting such liabilities.\n\nHuman rights\n\nRio Tinto state that they take various actions to support and respect human rights consistent with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They also state that they voluntarily comply with various other voluntary schemes such as the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises.\n\nRio Tinto use a widely-used Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting framework to present some of their sustainability reporting.\n\nCatalyst Australia reviewed Rio Tinto’s sustainability reporting and company performance as part of a wider Australian company analysis across “six topics\n\ngender equality, labour standards, supply chains, environmental impact, sustainability engagement and community investment”. 3\n\n3 Catalyst CSR Dashboard, GRI Reporting Snapshot, March 2014\n\n8 | Unsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto\n\nIn Catalyst’s judgment Rio Tinto achieved only very limited compliance with what the GRI reporting guidelines required. Catalyst judged Rio Tinto’s compliance at 50 per cent of what they need to report in order to comply with GRI framework reporting.\n\nIn several areas Rio Tinto are adamant in refusing to collate data – employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, composition of governance bodies and breakdown of employees by diversity indicators.\n\nThe big areas of omissions in reporting concern human rights. Catalyst analysed as inadequate Rio Tinto’s reporting on human rights clauses/screening in suppliers’ and contractors’ agreements; actions taken to support the rights to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining where those rights are at “significant risk”; measures taken to eliminate forced labour in operations where there is significant risks of incidents of this. Rio Tinto state that it is compliant with these without providing any significant information.\n\nCatalyst similarly found that Rio Tinto offered no significant information about how they approach “stakeholder engagement” nor on “key topics and concerns raised through stakeholder engagement and how the organisation has responded”.\n\nRio Tinto stated that they comply with GRI indicator “Public Policy development, participation in public policy development, and lobbying”, but only partially report on how their business units are analysed for corruption risks and nowhere do they describe their lobbying. It does become known however through various means.\n\nRecent Freedom of Information Act responses from the UK Government show that the UK and Australian governments have persistently lobbied on behalf of Rio Tinto in the US courts dealing with litigation over their complicity in Papua New Guinea’s bloody suppression of an independence movement in Bougainville that developed from opposition the gross environmental harm caused by their Panguna copper mine. UK Government intervention were made in 2007, 2009 and 2011 against a class action being brought against Rio Tinto.\n\nRio Tinto describe briefly that they made organisational changes after the 2011 publication of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights – [which are] “based on a shared responsibility between nation states’ duty to protect and a corporate responsibility to respect”.\n\nThe significance of their omission of “remedies” – the third leg of the 2011 UN Guiding Principles is in the fact that extractive and other multinationals like Rio Tinto lobbied hard to roll back the 2008 “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework report which analysed the lack of access to justice for people living and working in weak governance zones against corporate power, and identified the need for effective\n\nsanctions. The corporate push against hard sanctions and remedies to the soft notion of local grievance mechanisms succeeded.\n\nRio Tinto state that they strive to achieve the free prior informed consent of indigenous communities. They claim that they apply “a participatory process so that local community members understand our operations and what is proposed in agreements [which are] evidence of Free, Prior Informed Consent (FPIC)... although we prefer to secure what we call broad- based, free, prior, informed support.”\n\nIn October 2013 the UN Working Group on Human Rights and TNCs reported to the General Assembly that much more needs to be done by business including Rio Tinto to protect indigenous peoples’ rights. The Working Group part of the UN Human Rights Council and the OHCHRs approved and filed reports including the Annual report of the Rights and Resources Initiative which stated that:\n\n“The mining giant Rio Tinto said in 2012 that it would seek “free, prior and informed consent” from communities before mining. But analysts of the company’s actions said in 2013 that the commitment was applied “where possible” and seemingly only if host governments approved. Many communities were unimpressed by Rio Tinto’s pledge, saying at the company’s annual meeting in London in April that their consent was not being obtained.”\n\nThe report specifically criticised Rio Tinto over its operations in Mozambique and Mongolia.\n\nResolution copper and the rights of\n\nindigenous peoples\n\nRio Tinto is leading an effort to win permitting for an underground copper mine known as Resolution Copper in a semi-desert area of Arizona, USA.\n\nThe Arizona Mining Reform Coalition reports that threats posed by the project have united Native American Tribes, local communities, concerned miners, recreation, conservation, and religious organization in opposition.\n\nMining companies have asked the US Forest Service several times for access to the areas, but each time this has been refused on the grounds that they are too important for ecological and recreational reasons. The entire area is also sacred to Native American Tribes.\n\nResolution is engaged in shortcircuiting normal US mining permitting by attempting to introduce a private bill into Congress proposing a land exchange in which they would offer the Forest Service other land in exchange for the public land where the mine would be located. This manouvre is designed to avoid effective\n\n10 | Unsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto\n\nMozambique\n\nTwo of the worlds largest mining companies, Vale and Rio Tinto are seeking to extract coal from huge coal fields in Mozambiques Tete Province. It is possible that the two projects, if properly taxed could help Mozambique bring benefit to the people of Tete Province. However, for a number of reasons, there is little reason to believe the projects are going to benefit the people of Mozambique.\n\nThere is a lack of transparency and accountability and little publicly available information about the companies’ activities. Civil society cannot access development agreements and contracts between mining companies and government are confidential.\n\nAlthough mining has brought a new lease of economic life to Tete province, this does not benefit local communities. In general only foreign companies are benefitting from the procurement of goods and services and local entrepreneurs are not involved.\n\nThe mining projects disrupt the way of life of the local people through resettlement, and cause an associated loss of livelihood and the lack of access to the natural resources on which those livelihoods were dependent.\n\nRio Tinto moved people from Capanga to Mwaladzi. At Capanga, residents relied on their proximity to the river not only for agriculture, but also to bathe, wash clothes, play and socialise. The land around Mwaladzi is arid and requires irrigation if it is to be farmed successfully. There are serious shortages of water for both agricultural and domestic use. Water pumps were provided but these fall into disrepair or cannot function during power cuts. Water has at times to be delivered by truck and sometimes people go without for three days.\n\nMwaladzi is also 40 km away from markets in the district capital in Moatize whereas before, they were within walking distance. This, plus the scarcity of baobab trees around the new settlement, means the people are not able to sell firewood, charcoal, and wild fruits with which they generated a cash income in addition to farming or if crops failed. Jobs generated by Rio Tinto (and Vale) in the construction phase were just short term.\n\nResettled community leaders have been instructed not to speak with civil society activists, journalists and other agencies without prior approval from the district administrator. Withheld permission has prevented UNICEF from conducting research and programming in the resettled villages. Such actions undermine the right to freedom of expression confirming the view of Human Rights Watch that the surge in mining in Tete Province can pose “grave risks to human rights.” 5\n\nEnvironment\n\nRio Tinto claims that respect for the environment is central to its approach to sustainable development. However its environmental reporting is often murky and its performance toxic.\n\nRio Tinto report aggregated totals for the volume of water they say they withdraw, discharge and recycle. This meets the second lowest level of reporting “requirements” of the voluntary GRI scheme. There is little sense of the differential impact (depending upon whether it’s a wet zone or an arid zone) their withdrawal and use of water have on the environment and communities.\n\nThere are additional GRI water-use categories seeking information on “water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water” and “water sources and related habitats significantly affected by discharge of water”. Rio Tinto does not use these categories and so provides less information on the impact of its water use.\n\nGrasberg\n\nSince 1995 Rio Tinto have been mired in continuing international criticism over their active involvement in Grasberg, in a joint venture with Freeport McMoRan (FCX) known as PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI).\n\nThe Indonesian environmental group WALHI quantified the impacts of Grasberg’s controversial riverine waste dumping and their waste rock dumping filling in two adjacent valleys. 6 They showed that 1 billion tons of mining waste had been dumped into the Ajkwa river system, and this would equate to 4 billion tons by the contractual end of the mining in 2041.\n\nThe Norwegian State Pension Fund disinvested from Freeport in 2006 on grounds of their investment risk being unethical because of Grasberg’s continuing serious environmental damage and unwillingness to improve environmental management. They disinvested from Rio Tinto in 2008 on similar ethical grounds. The disinvestments were of $19 million in Freeport and $786 million in Rio Tinto. They noted but didn’t investigate reports of Freeport’s complicity in human rights violations.\n\nThe New Zealand State Superannuation Fund disinvested from Freeport in Sept 2012 over human rights abuses associated with the mine involving torture, illegal detentions, and killings by security forces protecting the mine. Sweden’s state-owned pension funds, on advice from its ethical advisory council, disinvested in Freeport in October 2013 over\n\n5 hrw/sites/default/files/reports/mozambique0513_brochure_web.pdf 6 The Environmental Impacts of Freeport-Rio Tinto’s Copper and Gold Mining Operation in Indonesia, 2006\n\nUnsustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto | 11\n\nits causing serious adverse environmental impacts that contravene the UN Convention on Biological Diversity through its mining operations in Papua.\n\nWhat Rio Tinto continue to value most about mining Grasberg is the low operating costs, the lack of regulatory need for international good practice tailings management, the lack of liability to traditional owners for forcibly appropriated land, the very large increase in profits after 2021 at more predictable levels, and the planned increasing development of underground ores bodies using block-caving. It’s clear that Rio Tinto’s involvement in Freeport can be lucrative. It’s also clear that it continues to be unethical.\n\nBiodiversity\n\nRio Tinto claim that they are committed to not negatively impacting biodiversity. However they also acknowledge the fact that 50% of the areas where they mine are of very high or high biodiversity value. In order to justify mining in these areas, the company developed their Net Positive Impact (NPI) policy. Rio Tinto consider that their ilmenite dredge-mining in the forests of Madagascar is their “test case” of this policy. This mine is operated by QMM, of which Rio Tinto holds a majority.\n\nCritical to Rio Tinto’s NPI policy is the idea of biodiversity offsetting. Biodiversity offsetting is creating or restoring biodiversity habitats in exchange for negative impacts on biodiversity of a project, in this case Rio Tinto’s ilmenite mining project. In reports published by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), an argument is made for biodiversity offsetting producing NPI by 2065. The modelling shows NPI over 50 years based on the assumptions that existing baseline forest as trees can be devalued to 40% value by using a crude assessment of canopy, and that positive net biodiversity outcomes can be forecast from restoration and from investment in “biodiversity offsets at several forest sites in the region, of c,000 ha of forest” and other unspecified offsetting. In terms of the depletion of several Critically Endangered species, the report does not consider “whether enrichment would be feasible or desirable”. 7\n\nIn a recent interview Gemma Holloway, sustainable development consultant to Rio Tinto conceded that “QMM has struggled to engage communities and to implement effective social development projects to\n\nimprove the wellbeing of local people affected by the mine.” 8\n\nEthical Corporation quote her as saying that the “company’s track record on the environmental front has, however, been far from exemplary and its involvement in forest management in the areas around its existing and future mining sites has aggravated relations with local communities, and in some areas led to increased forest degradation and communities retaliating against their loss of ownership of local resources.\n\nWaste\n\nRio Tinto state overall quantities of waste production – an “estimated 1,878 million tonnes of mineral waste (predominantly waste rock and tailings)”. They include a brief report on the acid rock drainage [ARD] hazards in the 24 of their mines that they have visited and assessed since 2004. They fail to describe or quantify the impacts of the ARD hazards particularly on local water sources and how they plan to manage such hazards. At their new copper mine in Mongolia, an independent audit found that their ARD management has specific failings in risk assessment and management decision-making. 9 This underscore the need for Rio Tinto to report more informatively.\n\nEnergy\n\nIn 2010 EU environmental lawyers Client Earth complained to a UK financial regulator about the inadequacy of Rio Tinto’s public reporting of its risks and uncertainties assessments on several of its controversial operations and on the specific product uranium. 10\n\nRio Tinto has uranium mining pollution legacy issues in Northern Territory Australia at its former Rum Jungle mine. The untreated polluted site has had two publicly- funded clean-up programmes since 2009 totalling over AUD 20 million seeking to remediate the still highly polluted site including continued leaking into surface water resources. The site has been a restricted area since 1989. The intensification of the pollution is caused by acid mine drainage. 11\n\nIn December last year in almost identical incidents, defective concentrator tanks burst at Rio Tinto’s\n\n7 portals.iucn/library/efiles/edocs/2011-062.pdf; Temple, H., Anstee, S., Ekstrom, J., Pilgrim, J., Rabenantoandro, J., Ramanamanjato, J.-B., Randriatafika, F. & Vincelette, M.
