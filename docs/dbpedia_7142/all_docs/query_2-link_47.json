        "text": "I'm on a plane and have a bit of time for a reflective post.... A month or so ago marks my 20 year anniversary working for Rio Tinto. My family and I moved to Nhulunbuy in 2004 for my new job at what was then the Alcan Gove alumina refinery. A couple of years later we had the G3 expansion and a number of experienced Canadian and French engineers moved over to help us commission the new refinery. Of course most people from that era have now left or retired but some are still in the company and still great friends (Stephane Torsiello, Martin Lavoie & Jean Marc Rouusseaux to name a few and Neil Hofstee was there at the time). When they joined our team I remember how incredulous I was when they said how long their colleagues in Canada and France had worked for the company (10, 20, even 30+ years was normal to them!). Prior to that job I had followed the work in mining, and like many Australian engineers I hadn't stayed more than 2-3 years with any company at a time. I now look back and realise that I have been with Rio Tinto for a long time, much longer than I imagined possible. I have been thinking about this milestone a lot over the last few months and I am a little surprised (in a good way) to realise how proud I am of this achievement. Over the last 20 years I feel very fortunate to have had a variety of challenges in operations, studies, commissioning, technical support and technical leadership. More importantly I feel very privileged to have worked with so many great people over that time in such a fantastic company!"
