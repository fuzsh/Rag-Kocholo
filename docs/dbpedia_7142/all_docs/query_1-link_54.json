        "text": "Case Type: business turnaround.\n\nConsulting Firm: FTI Consulting 1st round job interview.\n\nIndustry Coverage: Mining & Metals Production.\n\nCase Interview Questions #00080: Your client Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (LSE: RIO) is a global leader of aluminum mining and production and currently the second largest aluminum manufacturer in the world (behind United Company Rusal). It was created in 2007 as the result of the merger between Rio Tinto PLC’s Canadian subsidiary Rio Tinto Canada Holding Inc., and Canadian mining company Alcan Inc.\n\nAlthough Rio Tinto Alcan’s unit costs are competitive, the company’s profit margins have been declining every year in the last five years and the management is anticipating cash flow difficulties any time. What would you advise them to do to turn around the business?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to you if asked)\n\n1. Demand for aluminum is growing slowly and prices have been stable. Demand is elastic in the short-run because users will take advantage of low prices to make forward purchases, but is inelastic over the medium to long run.\n\n2. The supply of bauxite, the ore for aluminum, has been declining, which has driven up world prices.\n\n3. The industry is very capital intensive and currently operates at 75% capacity. Distressed by declining profits, Rio Tinto Alcan currently operates at 85% capacity.\n\n4. Aluminum is sold on world markets at world prices stated in dollars. The dollar’s value has been declining relative to other currencies.\n\n5. 70% of Rio Tinto Alcan’s output is currently sold in the United States. It may be necessary to expand into other emerging markets like China and India."
