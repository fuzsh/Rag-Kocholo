A lot of it is just greenwashing and handout grabbing. Lots of your taxes used to fund research and experimental schemes which never stand a chance of achieving anything significant\n\nAll hydro schemes undergo a detailed risk assessment at the planning stage and this (most definitely) includes an assessment of payback time for the proposed concrete mass. Use is made of recycled concrete from e.g. buildings/bridges etc. Where is the evidence for your \"larger schemes\" claim ?\n\nYour \"Small schemes...\" sentence lacks any details to beat the triviality and facile nature of its statements. It seems that you are inclined to blaze away indiscriminately and without real knowledge. It would be impossible for the Environment Agency to approve any hydro scheme which did not offer significant sustainability benefits, and no landowner or backer would think of investing a penny unless there were a rock solid RTI time.\n\nIt is indeed only a few days ago that the Environment Agency renewed the abstraction / production licence of the hydro-electric station which I manage, after a 5 year continuous assessment of the environmental impacts and benefit, and we have made a significant contribution of nearly 2 million kWh to the national power bill in that time. And over the last three weeks in the winter run, we have recorded more salmon over 800mm length ascending the weirs than at any time in the last 24 years. This is a likely consequence of a complicated series of fish passes and larinier which were designed from the outset to improve the upstream passage of running fish, plus a major release of 8000 fry just over 6 years ago by a salmon trust\n\nPlease think carefully and provide verifiable data before you damn hydro with your untenable and wild comments.\n\nAll hydro schemes undergo a detailed risk assessment at the planning stage and this (most definitely) includes an assessment of payback time for the proposed concrete mass.

Use is made of recycled concrete from e.g. buildings/bridges etc. Where is the evidence for your \"larger schemes\" claim ?\n\nYour \"Small schemes...\" sentence lacks any details to beat the triviality and facile nature of its statements. It seems that you are inclined to blaze away indiscriminately and without real knowledge. It would be impossible for the Environment Agency to approve any hydro scheme which did not offer significant sustainability benefits, and no landowner or backer would think of investing a penny unless there were a rock solid RTI time.\n\nIt is indeed only a few days ago that the Environment Agency renewed the abstraction / production licence of the hydro-electric station which I manage, after a 5 year continuous assessment of the environmental impacts and benefit, and we have made a significant contribution of nearly 2 million kWh to the national power bill in that time. And over the last three weeks in the winter run, we have recorded more salmon over 800mm length ascending the weirs than at any time in the last 24 years. This is a likely consequence of a complicated series of fish passes and larinier which were designed from the outset to improve the upstream passage of running fish, plus a major release of 8000 fry just over 6 years ago by a salmon trust\n\nPlease think carefully and provide verifiable data before you damn hydro with your untenable and wild comments.\n\nPerhaps if we didn't have so many civil servants running around after tuppenny-ha'penny schemes for the benefit of subsidy recipients, they could have got to grips with having an actual energy policy?\n\nGroan, the FUD arguments, it’s stultifying. There are ways to mitigate those issues. We just need to get on with things like this. Nuclear, wave, geothermal too.\n\nIf we destroy the ecosphere we starve. Not a trivial consequence. Step warily in disturbing Mother Earth, she may not react the way we want. There are no ways to create an alternative 400 square mile tidal mudflat and sandbanks if we dam the Severn\n\nThe Severn Estuary barrage has been discussed endlessly and deemed either impractical or over destructive or both. The papers supporting it are so scientifically naive as to make one wonder if they were sketched out by an ad agency. Even the Cardiff Barage created for urban enhancement proved to be a stagnant disaster at first and need aerating like a giant aquarium to keep it nice let alone productive\n\nSome tidal streams such as between various Scottish Islands are well worth harnessing if only we could make the turbine systems robust enough though a turbine in the Corryvreckan might by a bit of a job. Other breeding grounds for our feathered and scaled brothers are best left alone. I quite like hydro in its place\n\nSolar plants in the Sahara are probably mankinds best hope. We just need to learn to think big and stop going to war with/stealing from each other.\n\nIf we destroy the ecosphere we starve. Not a trivial consequence.

We just need to learn to think big and stop going to war with/stealing from each other.\n\nI don‘t think displacing a number of wading birds and reducing razor clam numbers counts as destroying the ecosphere. It could more accurately be said that their loss is to protect the ecosphere. Also, it would not destroy the mud flats. The period between high and low tide would be considerably reduced, that’s all.\n\nI agree the Sahara has the potential to provide huge energy. By my reckoning all the world’s energy needs handsomely. If it were my choice I would just take it. The current residents are not capable of utilising it and there are so few living there to oppose a military offensive, it would be such a great economic and environmental prize for Britain and the world to justify a little war and theft. So I don’t share your pacifist view. This was of course how the world’s greatest empire did things. I don’t understand why it has gone out of favour."
