It's Ornella Barra, the first Italian woman to appear in the Fortune "Most Powerful Women in Business List" with the 25 most powerful managers in the EMEA area (Europe, Middle East and Africa) followed in twenty-second position by Marina Berlusconi. Since 1988, the famous Fortune magazine has drawn up an annual ranking of the 25 women who have made the most of their business success in the last 12 months. Last week it was the turn of the all-US ranking of the most powerful women that she crowned Mary Barra, manager of General Motors.

In the ranking that concerns us, the most influential manager is the Spanish one Ana Botin, president of Banco Santander, followed by Alison Cooper of Imperial Tobacco and in third place from the Swede Annika Falkengren from the Seb group. We find the first Italian in fifth place, an improvement on last year's eighth place.

Ornella Barra, born in 1953, originally from Chiavari is Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President and Chief Executive of Global Wholesale and International Retail. The company, with a presence in over 25 countries, has more than 370 employees and is the world leader in products and services for health and wellness in pharmacies.
