        "text": "Emanuela Barilla, Adriano Galliani, Stefano Pessina and companies allegedly linked to ex premier Silvio Berlusconi and entrepreneur and former Formula 1 manager Flavio Briatore are among a further 100 Italians and firms named as holding offshore accounts to allegedly dodge taxes according to a Panama Papers article that will appear in newsweekly l'Espresso Friday, news editor Vittorio Malagutti said Thursday.\n\nThe names appear in documents leaked from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca and now at the centre of a global financial scandal. \"There are 100 (names) in all, entrepreneurs, professionals, managers from all over Italy,\" Malagutti said. \"These include Sport Image International of the British Virgin Islands, a company belonging to the galaxy of Silvio Berlusconi that came under investigation some 20 years ago for paying Milan footballers in black,\" he continued. \"Adriano Galliani and two other former Fininvest managers, Giancarlo Foscale and Livio Gironi, are indicated as administrators of Sport Image, founded in 1989. Instead, (offshore company) Struie is a strongbox also created by Mossack Fonseca, and used by both Forza Italia's leader and Flavio Briatore (though their names do not appear directly in the Panama Papers),\" Malagutti said. L'Espresso has also reconstructed the alleged off-shore dealings of other well-known figures in the Italian economy including Emanuela Barilla, a shareholder in the Mulino Bianco bakery products group, and pharmaceuticals industry magnate Stefano Pessina.\n\nHe and his partner Ornella Barra are alleged to control an off-shore company called Farniente Holding - literally translated as 'Do nothing Holding' in Italian. Last Friday the newsweekly named designer Valentino, comic and director Carlo Verdone and TV host Barbara D'Urso as being among a first list of 100 Italians holding offshore accounts.\n\nAll three, through their lawyers, flatly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© Copyright ANSA"
