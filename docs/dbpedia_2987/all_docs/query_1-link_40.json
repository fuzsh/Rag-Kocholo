        "text": "The Boots bosses have issued a major update over their plans for the UK market. US owner Walgreens is upgrading Boots’ high-street stores and the new beauty halls aim to take on the likes of Sephora, the high street giant's bosses have confirmed.\n\nOrnella Barra, the head of Walgreens’ international empire, and Seb James, the UK boss, say Boots is offering 20,000 consultations a month and Advantage Card data on customers will support clinical trials. They spoke to the Sunday Times this weekend.\n\n“Boots is very important for Walgreens,” Barra explained. “It’s in a very good position in the market, so at the moment, the best solution is for Boots to remain part of the group.” They confirmed plans to upgrade 70 shops this year, followed by 100 more next year.\n\nREAD MORE State pensioners warned over 'eight reasons' they won't get State Pension\n\n“Stefano has an entrepreneur’s spirit. As an entrepreneur you know the company has good moments and bad moments,” Barra said. “Walgreens is solid, it has a strong team, 123 years of history, thousands of stores and an iconic brand. Stefano remains committed to finding the solution, supporting our chief executive, Tim Wentworth.”\n\n“We would accept that not all our stores are at the standard we want them to be, but we have an aspiration to have a great Boots store in every town and no stores that we are ashamed of,” said Anthony Hemmerdinger, the retail director at Boots UK.\n\n“Five or six years ago, we were among the worst in terms of our digital presence, but now we are in the pack. When the new platform goes live in a year’s time, we will be on the leader board,” James said."
