        "text": "Another year may have flown by, but that does not mean pharmacy professionals have not been investing time to lay important foundations for a thriving career.\n\nPharmacy students have also been busy navigating their way through Oriel: the new centralised recruitment system for preregistration training. Our articles dedicated to guiding students through the system were among the most popular in Careers and\n\nTomorrow’s Pharmacist\n\nthis year.\n\nHere are the five professional career and student articles you valued most in 2019:\n\n5. Qualified Persons: seven things pharmacists needs to know\n\nThere is a strong interest in jobs for pharmacy professionals in the pharmaceutical industry, not least in the role of Qualified Person (QP). Carol Candlish, pharmaceutical industry QP and Responsible Person, and Kina Vyas, professional development pharmacist at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS), provide an overview of the role and important considerations for pharmacy professionals interested in pursuing it.\n\n4. Ornella Barra: from community pharmacist to one of the world’s leading business women\n\nOnly 36% of female pharmacists in the UK reach the most senior levels in the profession, so it is refreshing to feature Ornella Barra: a pharmacist and co-chief operating officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance. In March, Barra sat down with Gino Martini, chief scientist at the RPS, to share her humble beginnings in community pharmacy and her meteoric rise to become one of the most successful women in business in the world.\n\n3. Dispensing errors: where does responsibility lie?\n\nWe take a look at accountability for dispensing errors, as part of our professional dilemma series, and it clearly resonates with readers. Pharmacists and legal experts weigh in on the most appropriate course of action when a dispensing error occurs.\n\n2. Oriel situational judgement test: what pharmacy students need to know\n\nOriel is in its second year, but there’s still a lack of consistent information about the process. In this article, authors Khalid Khan, Aamer Safdar and Atif Shamim do an exceptional job of creating several invaluable resources to guide students through what can be a confusing series of mandatory assessments.\n\n1. How to succeed in the Oriel multiple mini interviews\n\nKhalid Khan, Aamer Safdar and Atif Shamim share their top tips for preparing for the short face-to-face interviews that form part of the Oriel recruitment testing process."
