She remains committed to scientific research and is an Honorary Professor and Honorary Doctor of Science at the University of Nottingham School of Pharmacy, as well as a lecturer on the MPharm course. She was instrumental in setting up a research partnership between Alliance Boots and the University of Manchester to further develop the understanding of skin ageing. Ornella also oversees all corporate social responsibility activities across Walgreens Boots Alliance, and was heavily involved in the Alliance Boots pan-European partnership with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Charitable Trust as well as the partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support in the UK."
