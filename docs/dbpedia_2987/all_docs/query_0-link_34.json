Copyright under Universal Copyright I Convention. 1970: An Analysis The business of doing business in the recording industry in 1970 more or less reflected the general state of the economy. For the first half of the /ear, however, the industry seemed comfortably insulated from the gen- eral downturn, validating the theory that recordings, especially to the young, possess “necessity” status. While an increase of 9% in industry sales — as estimated by the RIAA — seems to give validity to this concept, the tight-money situation caught up with the business, and is expected to make the bottom-line showings of a lot of companies less than rosy. It would seem, however, that the industry did not stint on attempts — some im- mensely successful — to uncover, pro- mote and come through with acts that look like long-range finds, such as The Jackson Five, Elton John, Melanie, James Taylor, Rare Earth and the Car- penters. And if the industry needed a clue to its potential, it could turn to the amazing 1 million plus sales of a 3-LP soundtrack production of “Wood- stock.” The economic question as it relates to the music business over the next 12 months is, again, reflective of the economy as a whole. Can the industry afford to seek out and pro- mote with vigor its talent finds if the economy fails to expand? 1970 was also a year of soul-search- ing for the business. Two of its bright- est stars, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Jop- lin, were among the casualties of drug abuse. Even before their deaths, the Vice President of the United States and a Commissioner of the FCC viewed rock as a major source of promoting drug abuse and general permissive- ness. Generally, the industry answered back in a strong voice that rock music, oft times a music of social reflection, mirrored the culture of Its time, more recently even propagandizing against the use of hard drugs. The industry also found a friend in one FCC Com- missioner, Nicholas Johnson, who has made broad attacks against Govern- mental censorship of the arts. 1970 was the year in which a new home entertainment medium began to pick up steam. This is the world of the video recording configurations. As tooling up for hardware was taking place for late 1971 introduction, soft- ware deals, mainly in the area of fea- ture films, were being firmed. While there’s general agreement that the video cartridge is a revolutionary step forward in home entertainment, some wonder If all the present publicity on the medium — still years away from mass use — will cut into recording sales, especially those of tape cart- ridges. Others claimed that current musical libraries in this area might prove dated by the time they reached the public. Coping with economic conditions, fending off critical attacks on its music and the development of the visual cart- ridge are vital facts-of-life in the im- mediate future of the recording busi- ness. 1 CashBox December CashBox TOPlOO 1 MY SWEET LORD __ George Harrison-Apple 2995 (2} ONE LESS BELL TO ANSWER Fifth Dimension-Bell 940 3 TEARS OF A CLOWN ®Smokey Robinson & Miracles-Tamla 54199 KNOCK THREE TIMES ® Dawn-Bell 938 BLACK MAGIC WOMAN ®Santana-Columbia 45270 DOES ANYBODY REALLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

[■ Fox Agency Tape Piracy Action Against 20 Outlets In Florida Podolor: Top 40 Radio Breathii g New Life Into The Singles Market “In certain areas bootleggers have opened stores dealing exclusively in bootleg products. One of the defen- dants in the Tampa action, Triangle Tape City, opened such a store in St. Petersburg right next to a music and record store in business for over 18 years, Lefter’s Music Company. The owners of the legitimate store were being severely hurt, and no doubt would have suffered great loss of sales, especially during the Christmas season, if we had not moved.” “There is no question but that thousands of bootleg cartridges are being sold each week, but we are beginning to make significant inroads in the traffic. As a result of our actions, retailers are afraid to handle it. They are a prime target in our campaign.” “While we can’t get to everybody at once, in due time all retailers caught with the merchandise in their stores will be sued.” Berman would not say where Fox would strike next, but he did indicate that his attorneys were intensively (Cont'd on p. 109) HOLLYWOOD — “Top 40 radio sta- tions, in an attempt to counteract the growing influence of FM under- grounders, have put a new breath of life into the once-dying singles mar- ket,” according to indie producer Richard Podolor. Podolor, who’s just earned his 19th RIAA gold disk in the last 18 months. He points to the heated competition between many major market Top 40’s to be the first to predict and break a single out of a new album as an important boost to flagging singles sales. “When the AM’ers first realized they were losing their older teen au- dience to FM, they tried to fight back with an ‘album cut’ policy, but all that did was dilute their program- ming,” says Podolor. “Now, they’ve learned to apply their ‘tight playlist’ concept to albums, concentrating on one, or maybe two cuts from a given album, and creating a market for the eventual single. By keeping the unfa- miliar music to a minimum, they are able to satisfy the growing taste of their young audience, without aliena- Revive Verve & Forecast Labels; 3-Part Structure Under Mansfield NEW YORK — Twenty-seven music publisher principals of the Harry Fox Agency instituted an action on Dec. 11 against 20 record and tape retailers and wholesalers throughout Florida for tape piracy. The defendants are charged with the illegal sale of pirated 8-track car- tridges bearing the label “Stereo 8.” Late on Dec. 11 United States Dis- trict Judge Ben Krentzman directed all of the defendants to show cause in the United States District Court, last Fri. (18), why they should not be enjoined from the sale of such cart- ridges. Pending a hearing. Judge Krentzman restrained the defendants from the further sale of the product. Largest Venture In disclosing the action Berman said: “The bootleg tapes which are the target of our Florida campaign are the same unmarked ‘Stereo 8’ pro- duct which was the subject of our successful action against retailers and distributors in the United States District Court in Connecticut in November. The ‘Stereo 8’ operation is unquestionably the largest and most sophisticated bootleg venture in the United States, with a highly clandes- tine distribution system. These ras- cals now have a printed catalog which they make available to re- tailers. Recordings by every artist and group of any consequence are available. In fact, the catalog even has a Christmas supplement. Current- Iv there are over 320 different 8 track cartridges available.” “When we instituted our action in November, one of the track papers reproduced the label, with a request that anyone having information con- cerning the operation communicate with our attorneys, Abeles and Clark. As a result they have been inundated with reports from respon- sible dealers all over the country who are being hurt by this operation. But the bootleggers promptly adopted a new label to obstruct our identifica- tion.” Half Bogus Sales Berman said his investigation shows that in some areas of the country sale of the Stereo 8 product is accounting for at least one-half of all 8-track cartridge sales. “Frequent- ly the bootleg cartridges are avail- able before the legitimate recordings are available. For example, we pur- chased the Bob Dylan “New Morn- ing” album in a bootleg cartridge in Tampa, although the Columbia car- tridge was not yet available.” FRONT COVER: Perry Como once again sends Christmas Greetings to the music world on the cover of Cash Box. The RCA songster thus revives a tradi- tion in which he appeared for 12 straight years on the year-end cover issue of Cash Box. The artist is presently giving new credence to the fact that the so-called “good music” format is one that always survives changing sounds on recordings.

This is a major financial comeback for the company, which in the previ- ous fiscal period declared a loss of $35,366,000. As for the music divi- sions, a deficit of $11,985,000 was turned into a $55,000 profit in the new period. Aubrey became president of MGM in Oct., 1969. He later named Mike Curb to run the company’s mu- sic division. For the music division, gross volume for the year came to $20,188,000. For the fourth quarter, volume reached $6,955,000, with a net income of $445,000, as compared to a loss in the same quarter last year of $6,386,000. Curb attributes music di- vision profits this year to two Micha- el Parks chart LP’s, a million selling single by Eric Burden, a Bobby Bloom smash, three top C&W smashes with Hank Williams Jr., Mel Tillis and Billy Walker, strong sales on the “Strawberry Statement” al- bum and the recent Eric Burdon LP. Also to music publishing which had an Elvis Presley hit (“You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me”), a Hot Legs charter (“Neanderthal Man”) and the Crow’s “King of Rock and Roll” on Amaret, all in the last quar- ter. Aubrey also stated that the compa- ny’s bank indebtedness was reduced by $52,091,000, or 63%. He claimed that a profit would be realized for the first fiscal period of the new the initial release. Verve /Forecast will consist of new free-form experi- mental pop. Verve /Forecast was the label that originally discovered such talent as Laura Nyro, Tim Hardin, The Mothers of Invention, Blues Pro- ject, Richie Havens, Ian & Sylvia, etc. “The Verve catalog is the largest jazz catalog in music,” Curb said, “and is probably the most important historically.” “We are going to re- lease carefully structured jazz pack- ages that should prove to be invalu- able to the collector and new buyer alike. It is our goal to continue and enhance the reputation of Verve and Veiwe/ Forecast which has always been a true purveyor of the avant- garde in the recording world.” MGM 70 Profits year, ending in Nov.

Show, in which CBS is a six-figure investor, is set to open on Broadway on March 30. It has a score by Alan Jay Lemer and John Barry.

Columbia has already marketed four original cast albums this season, including “The Rothchilds,” “Two By Two,” “Bob & Ray — The Two & Only,” and “Paul Sills Storyteller Theatre.” ting their older audience.” The result : of this new trend, according to Podo- I lor, is that the singles buyer is no longer abruptly becoming an album buyer, but instead will continue to support the singles market for a long period. Underground Singles “Last year, record companies had to fight to get singles exposure for their album acts,” Podolor asserts. “Although many undergo und groups did have hit records (including such Podolor-produced acts as Three Dog Night, Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf and Blues Image), they were the re- sult of strong promotion.

Subject is a cut from the Bloodrock 2 LP released as an abbreviated single under the title “D.O.A.” The anti- drinking-when-driving message is termed by Capitol’s national singles promotion manager Evan Reynolds as a “soft sell but hardly subliminal crusade against intoxication during the holiday season.” Record, according to Reynolds, was first aired by underground stations but has crossed over onto several powerhouse outlets as KLIF (Dal- las), KYA (San Francisco) and WFUN (Miami). It’s drawing imme- diate phone response whenever it’s aired. “Several radio stations had ex- pressed interest in playing it after the holidays because they felt it might be a little morbid for this time of year. But in reality it has come to our attention that some stations are programming it for that very reason. They feel it is a public service state- ment,” says Reynolds. “D.O.A.” (Dead on Arrival) is ! termed a “heavy but not hard rock | record” by Reynolds who feels it is i conceivable that it could be played on j some MOR outlets also. “It is ■ reaching a much larger demographic j audience than we first believed it could.” Side hit the Cash Box top 100 I this week at #94.

S. tour to a rewarding finale last week, as he presented the group with three gold albums. The ceremony took place at a gala soiree and cocktail reception hosted by London Records last Tuesday (15) at the Friars Club, the night follow- ing the group’s two concert sellout at Carnegie Hall, closing their third lO-da-\"^ tour of America of the year. Sir Edward was presented to the audience of more than 200 guests, representing press and radio as well as agency and record dealer figures, by Walt Maguire, head of London’s pop A&R division. Sir Edward presented each member of the five- man group with three gold LP’s for the albums, “In Search of the Lost Chord,” “To Our Children’s Chil- dren’s Children,” and “A Suestion of Balance”. First of these three is on the Moody’s former Deram label, while the latter two are on their own Threshold label, distributed by Lon- don. Earlier this year, the group also received gold disks for their Deram albums, “Threshold of a Dream” and “Days of Future Passed.” Thus, the Moody Blues have now scored with gold record awards for all five of their currently released albums. Be- yond this, all five of the awards have been won during the past three months, which is believed to be a record. According to plans now on the drawing board, the group is expected to return to the U. S. in April, fol- lowing completion of sessions for a new album which will get underway after the first of the year. Cap. Signs Albatross HOLLYWOOD — Capitol Records has announced the signing of the British group Albatross to an exclu- sive recording contract, according to Artie Mogull, executive producer and vice president, A&R division. Their debut album is scheduled to be released in early January, and the group is to make their first American tour in March. Albatross is managed by the Robert Stigwood Organization in London, New York, and Los Ange- les, on top product — new and recent re- cordings by the label’s best-selling artists: the Band, the Beatles, Glen Campbell, Grand Funk, Merle Hag- gard, the Lettermen and many oth- ers, along with leading Angel artists. Capitol will support this “Clear- ance Sale” in several ways, according to Rocco Catena, vice president of Merchandising. “We’ve started off by borrowing from the ‘January White Sale’ idea. We sent out an initial teaser mailing to all accounts of a printed hand towel, which will be fol- lowed in part by display kits featur- ing clotheslines, clothespins, and beach towels.” Capitol accounts will also receive an elaborate ad mat kit enclosing advertising “modules” for co-op use, sample layout sheets, check lists and order blanks. The label’s sales force has already begun an intensive ac- count coverage in preparation for the Dec. 26 launch date. Said Catena, “We hope by this ex- tensive concentration to achieve five particular aims: to direct consumer thinking from holiday purchasing to ‘catalogue awareness,’ to stimulate store traffic by offering accounts an aggressive sales promotion, to mo- tivate the consumer to spend a good portion of his ‘gift dollars’ on Capi- tol and Angel product, to attract the new owner of playback equipment, and to assist the account in reducing the bulk of ‘left-over’ holiday stock.” Edwards: Chess Lahles i a For Renewed Flow Of ¥mim NEW YORK — With its A&R dept, set for full-scale operations, the Chess label operation of the GRT Record Group is ready to roll again with a steady flow of product. This is the word from Esmond Edwards, re- cently-appointed A&R vp, following an A&R meet in New York. New York-based execs and the label’s staff producers from Chicago planned al- bum and singles schedules through next April. The flow, coming from Chess, Checker, Cadet and Cadet Concept, will originate, Esmond said, largely from a roster of producer and artists in Chicago. “Our new policy,” he added, “will also enable us to obtain product from the best independent producers, who are a major source of new talent.” He noted that a coordi- nated release schedule would be backed by “solid” merchandising, promo and publicity campaigns. Attending the meet at the New York Hilton were Edwards, Len Levy, head of the GRT Record Group, Amie Orleans, vice president of marketing for Chess; Joe Gowan, vice president of administration for the GRT group. Art Milhman, con- troller; Ralph Bass, producer for Chess in Chicago; and staff producers Gene Barge, Charles Stepney, Sonny Thompson and Cash McCall. Planned as the first of regular meetings with the Chicago A&R staff, the conclave proved productive. The recording schedule for the rest ‘Silhouettes In Courage’ Profiles Black Role In History On 8 LP’s Project Cost At $300,000 $300,000 album put the blacks’ NEW YORK — A project designed to role in history, particularly Ameri- can, into proper perspective has been marketed by Silhouettes In Courage, Inc. The production, conceived by com- poser-producer Charles Jones, pres- ident of SIC, is a series of four al- bums, each containing two LP’s. Jones and co-producer Warren C. Slaten called upon the services of more than 1500 actors, writers, musi- cians and historians to undertake the project, which required more than 28,- 000 hours of technical production. These included historians Prof. William Loren Katz and Dr. Benja- min Quarles and performers Ossie Da- vis, Brock Peters, Frederick O’Neal and Ruby Dee. Jones, who said the RCA and Columbia labels gave aid in the preparation of the fourth volume, said that sales would be handled through mail-order and regular rec- ord distribution channels. The com- plete set lists at $45, while individual volumes sell at $11.95. Jones expects a particular strong response from ed- ucational institutions. As noted at a reception at Mastertone Sound Studi- os in New York, where most of the recording took place, the series rep- resents a “needed corrective in Amer- ican history courses,” in the belief that the black man’s role in building America has generally gone unrecog- nized in history texts. ‘Unknowns’ Revealed On Canada Media See Inf I News Report In addition to the disks, a cassette version is being prepared by Educa- tional Designs, a company dealing with educational materials. SIC, located at 22 East 40th St. in New York, has also produced several other recording projects. These in- clude “P.S. 186,” 15% of the income from which will be donated to the Parents Teachers Association and a student bus service in Atlanta; and an LP of serious music works by black composers Howard Swanson and Jones himself, with Benjamin Steinberg conducting the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra. Fifteen per- cent of the latter LP profits will be contributed to the Symphony of the Air. Jones, who noted that he had bor- rowed the $300,000 to make the series, plans other endeavors, some in the area of TV.
