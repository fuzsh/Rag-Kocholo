        "text": "You know what they say … When in Rome, do as the Ospreys do! Today's international spotlight takes us to Italy where our alumna, Alma Laias (’97, ’99), has turned the Roman Holiday into a lifestyle as the senior adviser of public affairs for the American Chamber of Commerce in Italy. When Laias initially visited some of her friends attending the University of North Florida, between the great reputation and the beautiful location, she was sold on becoming an Osprey. As an undergraduate student, she got degrees from the UNF - College of Arts and Sciences in communication and international relations, while also working at the UNF International Center. She stuck around to attend the UNF Graduate School and earned her master’s in public administration while serving as the international student advisor and eventually acting director of the office of International Affairs. In her role, she would work daily with students seeking advice and support on academic matters, housing assistance, international visas, health insurance and anything personal. “We were their family in their new country,” she said. Laias considers herself an Italian American with deep love for “Belpaese.” She said, “After every summer holidays in Italy, l would bring with me and share with my colleagues in Florida, the beauty of every monument, plaza, street, church, museum l visited, and the smell of every cappuccino and pizza l had.” In 2000, she got a new role as an international affairs adviser for the Camera dei deputati (Chamber of Deputies in Italy) and made the move to Roma. After serving in that role for seven years, she got promoted to head of international relations. She also spent a few years as the director of institutional relations for The American University of Rome. In 2014, she got an opportunity to join the American Chamber of Commerce as a business development adviser, and in 2020, she was promoted to senior adviser of public affairs. In her role, she optimizes the relationship between the Italian Parliament and the U.S. Congress, the Italian Embassy in Washington D.C., the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF), the U.S. American Chamber of Commerce and other government agencies. She also works with Italian companies to create opportunities for them to invest abroad. Among her many achievements, one that is very close to her heart is the relationship with American universities that each year send their students to Italy for a full immersion academic course. When Ospreys study abroad, she helps organize meetings with members of Italian Parliament during their trip to Rome. She credits her amazing professors from UNF who taught her how to work as a team and learn to respect different cultures and values. She still keeps in contact with them 25 years later."
