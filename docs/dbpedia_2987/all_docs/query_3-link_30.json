        "text": "The majority of Pessina's fortune is derived from a 16.8% stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance, a publicly traded drugstore operator that has about 9,000 stores in the US, according to its website. He controls his stake through Luxembourg-based holding companies Alliance Sante Participations and NewCIP II, according to local registry filings.\n\nHe obtained a stake in Walgreens in 2012, after the US company bought 45% of closely held Alliance Boots for $6.7 billion. Walgreens exercised its option to buy the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots for 3.1 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) in cash and 144.3 million Walgreens shares on Aug. 6, 2014. The deal was completed on Dec. 31, 2014. Pessina is assigned 35% of the proceeds from this second transaction based on the economic interest ASP held in Alliance Boots at the time.\n\nThe value of the billionaire's cash investments is based on an analysis of dividends, insider transactions, asset sales and taxes.\n\nA spokeswoman for Pessina declined to comment on his net worth.\n\nStefano Pessina was born in 1941 in Pescara on the east coast of Italy, when his father, Oreste, was serving at an air force base there. He studied nuclear engineering at the University of Milan, and worked at the university as an academic before joining market researcher AC Nielsen. He left in 1974 to help run the family's ailing pharmaceutical distribution company.\n\nHe began buying smaller pharmaceutical distribution companies in Italy, and after creating Luxembourg-based holding company Alliance Sante expanded across Europe. In 1986, Pessina bought Di Pharma, a pharmaceutical company headed by Ornella Barra, creating a business and personal partnership between the two that continues today.\n\nPessina merged Alliance Sante with London-based pharmaceutical cooperative Unichem to create Alliance Unichem in 1997. Eight years later, the company announced the 7 billion pound ($12.3 billion) merger of Alliance Unichem with Boots, the UK's biggest pharmacy chain. The deal was finalized on July 31, 2006, creating publicly traded Alliance Boots, Europe's biggest drug distributor. Pessina joined with private equity firm KKR the following year to acquire all of Alliance Boots for $22 billion in a leveraged buyout.\n\nWalgreen, the biggest US drugstore operator, paid $6.7 billion in cash and stock for a 45% stake in Alliance Boots in 2012. In the deal, Pessina obtained a 7.7% stake in Walgreen and retained 18% of Alliance Boots. The American drugstore chain exercised its option to buy the rest of the company for $5.2 billion in cash and 144.3 million Walgreen shares in August 2014. The transaction completed on Dec. 31, 2014.\n\nHe lives in Monaco with partner Barra."
