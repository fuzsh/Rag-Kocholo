As it is, the 71-year-old billionaire has no intention of slowing down.\n\nEven having enriched himself beyond most people’s dreams through a series of huge healthcare deals — the latest being the £10bn merger of Boots with America’s biggest pharmacy chain, Walgreens — Pessina works seven days a week. He shuns holidays and has no use for fast cars.\n\n“Work is interesting and it keeps me busy,” he shrugs.\n\n“I would say that it’s the best recipe not to worry about my age, and the fact that life is passing. If you are busy you have other things, more practical things,"
