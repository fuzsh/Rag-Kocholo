        "text": "The retail world is abuzz with news that Stefano Pessina, CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, has decided to step down from his role and will assume a position as executive chairman of WBA following the selection of a new CEO. While the level of Pessina’s involvement in WBA's day-to-day business was never certain, his departure will make waves and does reflect a larger story about WBA’s current difficulties and leadership instability.\n\nFor several years now, there has been a rumor that Pessina was eyeing a different role within WBA. This less visible position would allow him to pursue the kind of mergers and acquisitions that made him famous (and the 107th wealthiest man in the world) while delegating the day-to-day operations of his company to someone younger and more interested in the duties of a CEO at the head of a multinational retail drug conglomerate. Pessina's strength is in drug wholesale and distribution. A nuclear engineer by education, Pessina started his drug empire with his family’s drug wholesale business in Naples, Italy. Broadly speaking, there are no retail drug chains in Italy – pharmacies are mostly family-owned and concerned with the selling of drugs and other health products rather than the typical pharmacy/front store experience seen in the United States. So retail as it is known in the US and UK is a somewhat foreign topic to Pessina. Further acquisitions within Italy gave birth to Alliance (and Stefano’s business and personal relationship with co-COO Ornella Barra), which in turn led to expansion into France, the UK, Russia, China, and eventually the acquisitions of Boots and Walgreens.\n\nHaving built the company from the ground-up, Walgreens Boots Alliance is a personal thing for Stefano Pessina and, though he is no longer WBA’s CEO, he will still hold considerable influence within the company - he is its largest shareholder (holding 15% of the company’s shares) and he selected much of WBA’s senior leadership. So while some publications may begin writing retrospectives about Pessina’s tenure as CEO, WBA is still Pessina’s company, and he will continue to play a sizeable role in its strategy.\n\nPessina leaves his CEO position with much of his business in a state of flux. COVID-19 has disrupted Walgreens and Boots, and both retailers were battling declines in store traffic and sales even before the advent of the global pandemic. As a result, rumors have swirled around WBA, and there is little to indicate that these will subside anytime soon – last year, there was a rumor that Pessina was engineering the largest public to private company transition in history with KKR. Only a month ago, Walgreens experts sounded out the possible sale of Boots to cut WBA’s losses and buy it time. Pessina’s resignation will do little to quiet the perceived chaos around WBA.\n\nIn Italian sport, there is a phrase used to describe a coach who is called in the closing months of an athletic season to salvage a poorly-performing team’s results and finish the season on a peaceful note – “traghettatore” or, ferryman. It’s an apt word for what’s happening at Walgreens Boots Alliance. Still working its way through a turnaround strategy and massive Transformational Cost Management Program, Walgreens Boots Alliance needs a ferryman who can return the company to the kind of growth it once enjoyed. Stefano Pessina wasn’t willing to fulfill that role."
