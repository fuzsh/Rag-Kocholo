        "text": "Italy's quiet billionaire, Stefano Pessina, did the unthinkable last year when he masterminded the merger of high street chemist Boots with his lesser-known drugs wholesaler Alliance UniChem.\n\nBut the former nuclear engineer, nicknamed the 'silver fox' for his glossy hair and superior deal-stalking abilities, dropped the equivalent of an atom bomb on the City 10 days ago when he proposed an audacious near-£10bn bid for the new group before it had even issued its maiden preliminary results.\n\nThe £10-a-share approach, backed by private equity house Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, has been rebuffed, but it is widely considered to have been just a prelude to the main act.\n\nUnlike Boots's chairman, City grandee Sir Nigel Rudd, Pessina is an enigma who has ducked the limelight despite holding senior positions in the British public arena for a decade.\n\nAlthough his main domicile is alongside billionaire high rollers such as Sir Philip Green in Monaco, the 65-year-old has a low profile in both Britain and his native country. And despite a personal fortune that stretches to £1.2bn, according to the Forbes rich list, there are no flashy birthday parties in the Maldives with A-list celebs. He prefers opera.\n\nMonaco neighbours say he is no playboy; he doesn't own a football club and his only known extravagance is a 50-metre yacht berthed off Sardinia. Friends say he is not ostentatious but does indulge passions for both art and boat design. He also enjoys the outdoors, especially sailing, and keeps fit playing tennis and swimming.\n\nA source close to him concedes that building his business empire is his life, but adds: 'He is not an automaton. He is good-humoured and quick to laugh and share a joke, but doesn't speak or act without thinking first.'\n\nNeither is the fiercely intelligent businessman cosseted by his wealth. He is said to travel among the great unwashed, scouting deals around the world by taxi and train.\n\nNick Bubb of broking house Pali International says his first impressions were of a 'jovial Italian grandad'. But a friend of Pessina's hints at a steelier core: 'He has not got a huge ego and keeps a low profile. But he is one of the toughest people I have ever met.' Analysts will also point out how favourable the deal Pessina secured for Alliance in the merger was. 'For 49.8 per cent, Alliance UniChem contributed all the debt and less of the assets,' observes Seymour Pierce analyst Richard Ratner.\n\nPessina's reticence may be the reserve of an intellectual. Born into a well-heeled Milanese family, he studied nuclear engineering at university and held a number of academic posts before applying his considerable brainpower to his father's drugs wholesale business Alleanza Farmaceutica, which later became Alliance Sante. He expanded the firm with a spate of takeovers, striking deals in Italy, France, Portugal and Spain, culminating in a merger with British-listed UniChem in 1997. He became chief executive of newly formed Alliance UniChem, then deputy chairman in 2004.\n\nOne of Pessina's many deals also netted him a long-term partner in the shape of glamorous Alliance Boots director Ornella Barra, who sold him her regional Italian pharmacy business in 1986. Since then she has become his partner and most trusted lieutenant, working alongside him in increasingly senior roles. But despite being a long-term item, the pair never married and have no children. Pessina, a Catholic, has never divorced his wife and has two adult children.\n\nThe personal stakes are high in the blockbuster deal Pessina is proposing. He is Alliance Boots's largest shareholder, with a 15 per cent stake that at £10 a share is worth close to £1.4bn . If a subsequent offer wins the backing of the board he is expected to retain a £1bn equity stake in the business.\n\nHis haste to privatise Alliance Boots is ostensibly born of frustration at the City's scepticism about its prospects. Reasonable Christmas trading was greeted with disdain by the market; the firm's shares were the biggest faller on the FTSE for two days on the trot.\n\nBut it seems a little early in the day for Pessina to be delisting. The ink on the £7.8bn tie-up is barely dry and such a seasoned dealmaker is unlikely to be throwing his toys out of the pram already; he stalked Boots for at least six years. And without even a set of full-year results to go on, no one in the City has more of an inside track on the progress being made by Alliance Boots - which has promised to deliver £100m in cost savings - than Pessina.\n\nPaolo Scaroni, who was Alliance UniChem's chairman at the time of the merger, is said to have asked suitors: 'How would you change the business to make it worth what you will have to pay?' Then, Pessina was apparently the man with all the answers. Now shareholders should be asking why he isn't telling them what they are.\n\nWhen in Britain\n\nAlliance Boots executive deputy chairman Stefano Pessina is among an elite band of Italians injecting some flavour into British business life. The last Italian to make such a splash in British business was former Selfridges supremo Vittorio Radice. The design guru was hired to build a furniture chain for Marks & Spencer but the pilot 'Lifestore', later nicknamed 'Deathstore', was a feat of style over substance. Chief executive Stuart Rose said arrivederci, pronto.\n\nThe stereotype of Italian businessmen tends towards hot-headed machismo, but comments by Cable & Wireless chairman Richard Lapthorne debunk the macho myth. He once praised former chief executive Francesco Caio's lack of ego. That did not stop C&W saying ciao to Caio in last March's reshuffle, but the dapper Italian has since resurfaced at investment bank Lehman Brothers.\n\nGiven the accepted supremacy of Italian over British cuisine, it is no surprise Italian entrepreneurs have made a splash in the leisure industry, from the late Scots-Italian hotelier Lord Forte, who opened Britain's first motorway service station, to Antonio Carluccio, whose eponymous cafe chain floated in 2005, and celebrity chef Aldo Zilli, who is currently taking airline food to task.\n\nA glimpse into the darker side of the Italian business psyche was afforded by the bitter experience of Sir Martin Sorrell this week. The WPP boss is suing former business associates Marco Benatti and Marco Tinelli over vicious blogs that labelled him a 'mad dwarf'. Not quite the 'sleeping with the fishes' approach of Mafia cliche, but cross an Italian and risk their wrath in cyberspace, it seems."
