        "text": "The eighth edition of the Prix Monte-Carlo Woman of the Year Award was devoted this year to the theme \"Art & Science\" on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci. During the evening, sponsored by the Walgreens Boots Alliance, the public could discover the women who received the awards.\n\nIn the presence of HSH Prince Albert II , Minister Marie-Pierre Gramaglia and President of the National Council Stéphane Valeri,\n\nthe winners were Sougwen Chung (Chinese-Canadian) Monte-Carlo “Woman of the Year” Award 2019 ; Elena Rossoni-Notter (Monaco) Monte-Carlo “Woman of the Year Award”-Monaco ; and ORLAN (France) Special Award for her entire career.\n\nHSH Prince Albert II of Monaco met the winners who told him about their journeys and careers, with Cinzia Sgambati-Colman, President of the Award, and Ornella Barra, Co-Chief Operating Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, sponsor of the Award since the first edition in 2012.\n\nSougwen Chung was elected winner of the 2019 Monte-Carlo Woman of the Year Award for her artistic work. Chinese-born multimedia artist who grew up in Canada and lives in New York, she has been working with robots since 2015, exploring the links between the handmade and design machines, to understand the relationship between humans and computers. Her multi-faceted artistic practice also includes film, painting, sculpture, installation and performance. \"Omnia for Omnia\" from 2018 reinvents the tradition of landscape painting with a work in which it uses a team of robots and the dynamic flow of New York City. She participates in improvised drawing performances with a robotic arm she calls DOUG. Chung is an artist-in-residence at Google and the New Museum's cultural incubator, New Inc. and a former research fellow at the MIT Media Lab. In 2017, she was one of three artists selected to participate in a new partnership between Nokia Bell Labs and NEW Inc. to support artists working with emerging technologies such as robotics, machine learning and LANCER biometrics.\n\nElena Rossoni-Notter , director of the Museum of Prehistoric Archeology of Monaco received the Monte-Carlo Woman of the Year Award – Monaco, for her commitment, tenacity, research, discovery and dissemination of archaeologist research on the territory Monegasque. Elena started working at the museum in 2014 as an archaeologist.\n\nShe carried out several excavations in the Principality of Monaco where there was in fact a settlement of men and women from prehistoric times. Elena Rossoni-Notter was appointed Director of the Museum in April 2018 by the Prince. Now the goal is to show the many treasures contained in the museum and never before shown to the public, and to continue to search for hidden treasures in the ground and caves.\n\nNot long ago, in a cave under the gardens of Saint-Martin, the director and her team found ancient remains of men, including a skull, which, thanks to digital programs, will soon have a face.\n\nORLAN , received the Monte-Carlo “Woman of the Year” Special Award for her career. An avant-garde pioneer in the field of art, science and technology, she has always provoked debate. ORLAN worked with her body and embodied on her skin all the complexities of identity. Operated, scanned, remodeled in 3D, virtualized, her body questions itself and provokes debate. The artist continued her creative process until creating, with a French robotics company, a robot in her image: the ORLANoid.\n\nIn October 2017, ORLAN was awarded the Female Excellence Award for all her work as an artist by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
