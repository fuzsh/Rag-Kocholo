        "text": "OrnellaPronunciationItalian: [orˈnɛlla]GenderfeminineLanguage(s)ItalianOriginMeaningFraxinus ornusOther namesVariant form(s)Ornelia\n\nOrnella is an Italian feminine given name, probably derived from ornello, \"flowering ash tree\" (Fraxinus ornus). It was coined by Gabriele D'Annunzio in his 1904 play The Daughter of Iorio[1][2][3] and popularized by the fame of singer Ornella Vanoni and, later, of actress Ornella Muti. It is most widespread in central and northern Italy, as well as in Abruzzo, while it is rarer in the South of the country.[2][4]\n\nClosely related but very rare names include Ornelia, and the masculine versions Ornello and Ornelio.[2][4]\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nOrnella Barra (born 1953), Italian-born Monegasque businesswoman\n\nOrnella Bertorotta (born 1967), Italian politician\n\nOrnella Ferrara (born 1968), Italian long-distance runner\n\nOrnella Livingston (born 1991), Jamaican sprinter\n\nOrnella Muti (born 1955 as Francesca Romana Rivelli), Italian actress\n\nOrnella Oettl Reyes (born 1991), Peruvian-German Alpine skier\n\nOrnella Ongaro (born 1990), French motorcycle racer\n\nOrnella Palla (born 1990), Uruguayan handball player\n\nOrnella Vanoni (born 1934), Italian pop singer"
