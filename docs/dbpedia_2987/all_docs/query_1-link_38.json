        "text": "After owner Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) decided not to pursue a ¬£5 billion sale or stock market flotation of the company for the second time in two years, Boots CEO Sebastian James plans to step down in November. WBA will continue a strategic review of Boots' assets despite the company's strong recent trading performance, with like-for-like sales rising 5.8% in pharmacy and 6% in retail. The proprietor is still dedicated to making investments in Boots UK and coming up with creative ideas to help the company reach its full potential. Amid worries about the state of the world economy and difficulties in finding a suitable replacement for Boots' ¬£8 billion pension plan, the failed sale plan attracted only one formal offer worth roughly ¬£5.5 billion. Following his appointment as Boots' CEO in 2018, Sebastian James has agreed to take on a new position in the health care world. With roughly 1900 locations across the UK, Boots employs about 52,000 people. #TalkSocialToUs #Boots #WalgreensBootsAlliance #BusinessLeadership #StrategicReview #UKEconomy #TheSocialTalks\n\nDoctor and a pharmacist coming to a local Walgreens near you? A few years ago, my preceptor, a banker-turned-pharmacist explained the business model of community pharmacies slowly shifting into an end-to-end care model, I am seeing the slow fruition into reality. Walgreens Boots Alliance, like other retail health companies, is bullish on primary care as demand surges for accessible health care. Interested to see Tim Wentworth's experience in healthcare services and in pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) operations transform Walgreens sales and profitability by helping the company to better position itself as a primary care provider and manage its costs. (Also thank you, Mr Wentworth for acknowledging pharmacists!) Prior, he was the CEO of Cigna, and before that, he was CEO of Express Scripts which he grew into a Fortune 22 company, boasting 26,000 employees, and over $100 billion in revenue. ü§î Though I am not a practicing pharmacist, curious to see how pharmacists can use this shift in care as a fuel for advocacy for pharmacists right to prescribe. After all, pharmacists have been the most accessible HCPs for years‚ÄîAND we are trained to have business acumen in the space. üëãüèª See the growing number of WAG-led medical group acquisitions: https://lnkd.in/gwjSb53f üëãüèª See Mr Wentworth's accomplishments in healthcare: https://lnkd.in/g7KpMsXj. #wag #walgreensboothsalliance #righttoprescribe #pharmacyadvocacy #communitypharmacists #primarycare #healthcareproviders\n\nA year or so ago, rumors swirled that Walgreens wanted to sell Boots UK, the UK-based retailer it owns. Walgreens bought Boots across two transactions in 2012 and 2014. In total, it paid $22 billion for the business. Notably, Walgreens‚Äô market capitalization is now just $10.2 billion ‚Äì so the whole company is worth way less than it paid for Boots. That, in itself, is an indictment of the way Walgreens has been managed. The original rationale for selling was to raise cash which could be returned to investors and pumped into the US business as Walgreens pursued its healthcare dreams. However, partly due to softness in the capital markets, modest interest never translated into a sale. Today, the mood music has changed. Walgreens wants to hold on to Boots. With the US business in a tailspin, and with healthcare ambitions not having paid off, Boots is one of the few parts of the group that‚Äôs actually performing. On the retail side, Walgreens in the US has seen comparable sales decline in 6 out of the past 7 quarters. Comparatively, Boots‚Äô comparable retail sales have risen consistently and by very solid levels. Why this difference? At a basic level, it is simply because Boots is a better run business, and it is a way better retailer than Walgreens. It always has been. Sadly, Walgreens hasn‚Äôt really learned much from Boots and has not fully capitalized on the brands that Boots owns, like No 7, in its stores in the US. It has also failed to capitalize on the premium beauty boom, whereas Boots in the UK has taken full advantage of that growth spot. The good news is that Walgreens says it wants to invest in Boots to retain its number one position in the UK health and beauty market. That includes improving some stores that have been neglected. Cynically, however, this could be a tactic to keep the cash flowing and keep the valuation up for when a sale can be made. What Walgreens really should be doing, of course, is learning more from Boots and applying some of the thinking in the US. I chatted with the Sunday Times about Boots; the article also contains some very interesting observations from the management of Boots and Walgreens.

I like Brittain as he is smart and he always tells the unvarnished truth. It was interesting that both Brittain and I were saying the same things: namely that Walgreens is a badly run company that has only itself to blame for its current challenges. If you want to understand how badly Walgreens has performed, just take a look at its market cap. Back in 2015, Walgreens was valued at $100.8 billion. Today it is valued at $10.5 billion. That's an absolutely astonishing 90% or $90.3 billion decline in value. Consider this too: Walgreens is now worth less than the $22 billion it cost it to buy Boots UK - a company it still owns. Such a precipitous drop isn't a function of economic challenges or of consumers cutting back. It's a function of deep neglect and numerous mistakes over many years: poor hiring, overpaying for acquisitions, dabbling in healthcare without fixing the core of the business, botched IT projects, abysmal retail execution, no real innovation, neglecting store staff and resourcing, not adapting to changing consumer habits, and so the list goes on. The blame for current woes lies firmly at the feet of management, of that there can be no doubt. #retail #retailnews #pharmacy #drugstores #healthcare #medical\n\nüî¥ Breaking News: Boots chief James quits after owner's ¬£5bn sale plan stalls - Sky News Big news in the retail world!
