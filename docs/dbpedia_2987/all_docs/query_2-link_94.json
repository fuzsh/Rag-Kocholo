Event panellists featured Alex Gorsky, Chairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson; Jean-Paul Agon, CEO, L’Oréal; Valerie Jarrett, President, The Obama Foundation, and Dr. Sally Uren, OBE.\n\nThroughout the event, WBA outlined its annual contributions towards global sustainability including special efforts towards four focus areas namely health communities, healthy planet, an inclusive workplace, and a sustainable marketplace.\n\nIn her address at the virtual event, Ornella Barra, COO, and Chairman of the CSR committee, said, “Our purpose at WBA is to help people live healthier and happier lives. Everyone deserves the opportunity to fulfill his or her potential, regardless of where one lives.”\n\nFor communities, WBA arranged for COVID-19 testing in underserved communities and organized special awareness programs based on health inequities in Chicago. Furthermore, the company set up safe spaces across the UK, Ireland, and Chile for domestic violence victims along with beauty programs for cancer patients.\n\nAccording to WBA CSR Report 2020, six major brands under the company aegis including NO7, Liz Earle, Sleek MakeUP, Walgreens, and Boots UK house, Soap&Glory, and Botanics signed a commitment to reduce plastic usage and impact across their product lines. In order to ensure effective implementation, employees and industry groups will work hand-in-hand towards amicable solutions.\n\nMoreover, WBA made it mandatory for each of their vendors catering to any of their health, beauty, food, home products, and paper goods brand to use a safety lab selected at random by the company. Through vendor agreement and responsibility of regular testing, WBA would ensure high product standards for its customers.\n\nIn its report, Walgreens Boots Alliance highlighted over $30 million raised from significant campaigns organized in partnership with organizations like Red Nose Day ($15 million), LLS and Komen ($10.8 million), Vitamin Angels ($2 million), BBC Children in Need ($1.4 million), American Heart Association ($1.2 million), American Red Cross ($900,000), etc."
