        "text": "Billionaire Stefano Pessina - deputy chairman of Alliance Boots and the man behind the £9.7bn surprise takeover approach for the group - has been the driving force behind the health retailer and pharmaceutical giant.\n\nThe 65-year-old is credited with orchestrating last July's £7.8bn tie-up between Alliance UniChem, the group he effectively created over 30 years, and Boots.\n\nBut the Milan-born entrepreneur enjoyed relative anonymity until the deal last year, despite presiding over one of the continent's largest drugs distributors and retailers and ranking in the world's rich list with an estimated fortune of £1.18bn, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nHe was renowned by analysts for being a private individual before the merger, and was said to travel around Europe in taxis and trains and refrain from doing interviews or talking about his private life.\n\nMr Pessina founded Franco-Italian group Alliance Sante in 1977, later merging the pharmaceutical wholesaling business with UniChem in 1997, when he was appointed to the board.\n\nHe acted as chief executive of the enlarged group for three years until December 2004 and latterly as deputy chairman.\n\nHowever the Italianbnaire is a nuclear engineer by profession and held a number of academic posts before entering the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nHe also previously worked as an independent business consultant and for marketing research firm ACNielsen.\n\nMr Pessina left academia to take on his father's small drugs wholesale business, establishing Alleanza Farmaceutica, which later became Alliance Sante, growing the firm largely by acquisition.\n\nHis buying spree involved takeovers across Europe, including deals in Italy, France, Portugal and Spain.\n\nMr Pessina is said to have met his long-term partner Ornella Barra following one of these acquisitions.\n\nMs Barra, a former pharmacist, sold her regional Italian pharmacy business to Mr Pessina in 1986 and has since enjoyed senior positions in the group as it evolved, appointed as executive director at Alliance UniChem in 1997 and now acting as wholesale and commercial affairs director of Alliance Boots.\n\nMr Pessina's move to partner with private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for the takeover has led to concerns over conflicts of interest, with Ms Barra and her partner understood to be excluded from emergency board meetings at Alliance Boots, which are expected to take place today, and board members reportedly barred from talking to Mr Pessina.\n\nAnalyst Nick Bubb of Pali International said with the risk of the bid failing, which could see Mr Pessina forced to step down and possibly sell his 15% stake in the group, it is a gamble the entrepreneur must be confident will pay off.\n\nHe said: 'He's pretty confident that £10-a-share is a fair price and it is, but is it right to take the group private less than nine months since the merger of Boots and Alliance UniChem went through?\n\n'It seems way too soon for the management to conclude that public life is not for them.'\n\nHe added: 'Pessina's big aim with the merger was to use the enlarged company as a platform to do more acquisitions and deals but it is not clear whether he has been unable to do what he wants or what he would do in private.'\n\nMr Pessina has been praised as a skilled dealmaker and engineered the Alliance Boots merger so that seven of the 13 directors are former Alliance UniChem people, including Ms Barra and group finance director George Fairweather.\n\nHanded responsibility for integration of the two businesses and group strategy, Mr Pessina is often said to hold the reins at Alliance Boots while chief executive Richard Baker is left to look after day-to-day operations."
