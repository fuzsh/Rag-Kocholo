        "text": "Stefano Pessina, the man plotting with a private equity group to buy the firm that owns the Boots chain, has only himself to blame if he is viewed with suspicion. For someone with one of the largest personal stakes by value - £1.5bn - of any director in a public British company he expects a remarkable degree of privacy.\n\nPessina is unknown to the public in his native Italy, having long since left to live in the tax haven of Monaco. His partner, also on the Alliance Boots board, is another publicity-shy Italian, Ornella Barra. But he is - or was - married to someone else. Italian newspaper reports many years ago called her a housewife and said they had two children. Pessina's PR representative said he did not know if she was dead or alive.\n\nThe chubby, white-haired, blue-eyed Pessina makes radically different impressions on those he encounters. Five people who had met him all agreed he was tough - \"hard as nails\", said one - and implacably rational, but not arrogant. Other comments might have been made about entirely different people. One person called him \"arid\"; another \"jovial\". He had \"a good sense of humour\", ventured a friend and colleague. Someone he met recently said: \"The amount of energy he conveys in his communication is staggering.\" Yet another dismissed him as \"very dull\".\n\nTen years ago, an Italian interviewer asked Pessina what he liked doing most. The reply was \"building\". It was an odd answer. Building is what engineers enjoy. But then that is what Pessina first dreamed of doing. He was born in 1941 in Pescara on the east coast of Italy, though only because his father was serving there as an airforce officer. He was brought up between Milan, Como and Naples. Italians note that he speaks with the slightly gargled \"r\" of the upper-middle classes. He studied nuclear engineering at university in Milan and, in 1967, stayed on as a research student. It was a heady time. There was revolution and marijuana in the air. Pessina decided he would be better off elsewhere, and joined a marketing firm. He got the opportunity to go back to some sort of building in 1974 when his father, Oreste, asked him to restructure the family company, which was in pharmaceuticals distribution.\n\nChain reaction\n\nHe soon discovered two things. One was that, by applying the skills he had learned and the then-arcane science of information technology, he could invent ways to manage inventories and distribute products that dramatically increased profits. The other was that, in inflation-racked 1970s Europe, you could buy companies cheaply. Or for nothing.\n\nBy applying his systems to the companies in his expanding pharmaceuticals group, ultimately called Alleanza Salute, he could lift profits as much as fourfold and use the surplus to buy more companies. The chain reaction brought him into contact with the attractive Barra. She sold her family's drug supply firm to Pessina in 1986, but joined him as managing director of the enlarged company.\n\nBy then, Alleanza Salute had 20% of the market and Italy seemed small. In 1991, Pessina set up a parallel French group, Alliance Santé, which started buying companies in Europe and beyond. He later created a Luxembourg-based holding company, also called Alliance Santé, to control the two groups and it was this firm that, in 1997, he merged with the British company Unichem to form a group encompassing pharmaceutical wholesaling and retailing. That raised the only hitch in Pessina's vast construction project.\n\nUnichem had to disclose that the man who was to be executive deputy chairman of the new group was charged in Italy with \"aggravated fraudulent bankruptcy\" and \"aggravated fraud in the obtaining of public financing\". The accusations arose from the purchase of two small firms from a state-owned corporate rescue vehicle by a company in which Pessina had a minority stake. According to his spokesman, the charges were dropped or dismissed in 2000.\n\nPessina was the real power at Alliance Unichem, owning almost a third of the equity. The group bought at an even more frenetic rate than its predecessors. By 2005, when he invited Boots's chairman, Sir Nigel Rudd, and its chief executive, Richard Baker, for merger talks on his yacht off Sardinia, Alliance Unichem had acquired more than 500 companies and stormed the FTSE 100.\n\nThe success of the merger of Boots with Alliance Unichem made Pessina an anomaly, both in Italian and British terms. By Anglo-Saxon standards, he had a huge personal holding - 15% of one of the UK's biggest companies. Yet the striking aspect for Italians was his readiness to sacrifice equity, and thus control, in pursuit of funding for expansion. By tradition, Italy's capitalists are reluctant to go public and share ownership with outsiders. Raising money internally, or from banks, \"kept things in the family\" and in many cases avoided the need for disclosure of the jiggery-pokery that all too often characterised Italian business (see Parmalat, Cirio, etc).\n\nPessina was unimpressed by the traditional model (\"Sooner or later heirs destroy family firms,\" he once said). He preferred the Anglo-Saxon way. \"If I had not continually tapped the stock exchange and diluted my interest,\" he told the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore in 2002, \"today [Allied Unichem] would not be even half the size it is.\"\n\nFrustrated\n\nIn this sense, the latest bid is a U-turn, for it would mean taking Alliance Boots back into private ownership. Those close to Pessina say he is frustrated by demands for quarterly accounting, impatient with the scrutiny of financial analysts and upset by media questions about the propriety of Barra's presence on the board. All that would be consistent with his desire for secrecy.\n\nSo is he, in fact, a more typical Italian capitalist than he proclaimed? Luca Solca of Bernstein Research, an Italian who has made an in-depth analysis of Alliance Boots, does not dismiss the idea. But he offers a more charitable explanation: that Pessina remains a builder, that he wants to grow the company, not strip it, but that he can see more clearly than the City the vast opportunities created by the deregulation of pharmaceutical distribution in continental Europe. \"The more I learn about this business, the more I understand its huge, underlying value,\" Solca said.\n\nPessina recently visited Bernstein's offices for an investor conference, he recalled. \"When he was speaking about the future, his eyes would light up.\"\n\nExplainer: Takeover target\n\n· Alliance Boots was formed last July through a £7bn merger between Alliance UniChem and Boots, creating a health and beauty group with 100,000 employees. It became a company with a pharmaceuticals distribution network spanning 14 countries, running 2,600 healthcare shops in the UK and 400 pharmacies outside Britain. Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance UniChem became executive deputy chairman of the enlarged group, Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots, also remained in that role, as did Richard Baker, chief executive of Boots.\n\nThat was less than eight months ago. During that period, the enlarged group had time to post its interim results in November, when it announced good trading results and said its summer merger was progressing \"so far so good\".\n\nThen, last Friday, rumours emerged that Alliance Boots had received a takeover approach. This was dismissed as speculation, until a statement was released saying it had indeed received an offer. It emerged that Mr Pessina was behind the £10-a-share approach, backed by private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.\n\nThe board rejected the bid on Monday, saying it failed to reflect the \"fundamental value\" of the business."
