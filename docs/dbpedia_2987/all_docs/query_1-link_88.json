        "text": "Stefano Pessina is in irrepressible mood. It's just three hours after the board of Alliance Boots has agreed to open its books to the Italian, and he's already talking about the next deal.\n\nHe's flanked by minders, making sure that he doesn't say anything that would upset the Takeover Panel, but he is excited and keen to talk. \"I am an entrepreneur,\" he says, trying to explain why he is pushing ahead with the controversial deal to take Alliance Boots private, even in the face of a pretty hostile media and some sceptical shareholders.\n\nTheir scepticism is easy to understand.\n\nJust eight months after Mr Pessina orchestrated the merger of his pharmaceutical wholesale business with the Boots retail chain, he now wants to take the whole business private with the backing of private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts - the original \"barbarians at the gate\".\n\nConsidering he owns 15pc of the shares (worth £1.5bn) and controls the majority of the members on the board, many people suspect that Mr Pessina has plotted this all along. To make matters worse, say his critics, his long-term partner, Ornella Barra, sits on the board. Surely he is now putting a gun to the head of other shareholders, they say.\n\nIt's an accusation he laughs off. \"It is really beyond belief to think of this deal as a Machiavellian project of putting two companies together and then shopping for a private equity partner. It's complete nonsense.\" His laughter fills the enormous boardroom of KKR's offices in London - a room filled with expensive modern art, including both an Anish Kapoor and a Rachel Whiteread sculpture. It's from these grand offices, overlooking Green Park, that Mr Pessina and his backers have plotted their assault on Alliance Boots.\n\nBut Mr Pessina is adamant that, when he persuaded Boots shareholders to merge with his company last year, he had no inkling that this is how it would end up. \"The reality is there is continuous evolution. I really thought that when we did this merger this could be a stable situation for several years.\"\n\nThen the irrepressible dealmaker comes out again. \"I thought there would be another big deal, another merger but within the industry.\"\n\nMost 65-year-old billionaires are contemplating a quiet life on sailing around the oceans of the world. Mr Pessina owns a 50m yacht - one of the rare signs of his substantial wealth - but retirement is not something on his agenda.\n\nHe confesses to living a peripatetic lifestyle, jetting between his home in Monaco, where he has to spend at least 90 nights a year to qualify for its low-tax regime, and his offices in Italy and in London. The two mobiles and a BlackBerry laid in front of him are clearly more important than any office.\n\nHis background is atypical of most billionaires. He shares neither of the clichés that many of his contemporaries in the super-rich club possess - neither inherited wealth, nor a tough start in life that fuelled his ambition.\n\nHe was born into a comfortable, middle-class family in Milan, where his father ran a range of businesses, including a pharmacy wholesaling company. Mr Pessina studied nuclear physics at Milan University, and briefly contemplated going into academia, a life that you can see him relishing. At times, mid-sentence, he closes his eyes and lapses into deep thought, before continuing with his argument.\n\nThis culminated in 1997 when Mr Pessina merged his business with Unichem, the British wholesaler that also owned a chain of retail pharmacies. Not only did this give him a listing on the London stock market, it was a crucial step in realising his dream of controlling a network of pharmacies across Europe - a network that would become ever more valuable as governments relied more heavily on the private sector to pick up the escalating health bill of an ageing population. The deal to merge with Boots was a logical step, even if much of the City did not understand it at the time.\n\nAs part of the restless dealmaking, he came across Ornella Barra. They met in 1982, when she was 28 and he was 40. Four years later she sold her business to Mr Pessina's and since then the pair have become pretty inseparable both professionally and personally. They share a home in Monaco and enthusiasm for working tirelessly.\n\nThe details of their partnership have been raked over in recent weeks by the press, something that Mr Pessina feels deeply uncomfortable about. His view is that they hardly ever show their face in public, never throw swanky parties, and therefore should be left in peace. \"I don't have a great ego. I don't enjoy seeing my face in the newspaper. It's just my character.\"\n\nHowever, this desire for privacy is not the reason why he wants to take Alliance Boots private, he insists. And neither is a sense of frustration with the being a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange - a factor invariably cited by City commentators. \"I am not frustrated with the City; I've just seen a better opportunity to move the business on.\"\n\nHis argument is that public shareholders are not willing to put up with the volatility that he wants to subject the company to.\n\nMind you, he hasn't given the public markets much time to test out this theory, considering Alliance Boots's shares only started trading last summer. It also seems unusual that he has teamed up with private equity, notorious for taking a short-term approach to running companies. Mr Pessina is aware it might look odd, but he says: \"I had always seen private equity as very smart guys, but people there for the short-term. I am always there for the long-term. And KKR persuaded me they were in for the long term\"\n\nKKR's supporters point out that the average length of time it invests in companies is seven years - far longer than most private equity investors.\n\nBut is Mr Pessina committed to the deal? If another private equity firm came along, what would stop him grabbing his mobile phones and Blackberry and upping sticks to another private equity office. After all, rivals such as Blackstone and Guy Hands' Terra Firma are monitoring the situation very carefully.\n\nA friend of Mr Pessina reckons that any such move would be completely counter to his style - which, despite the tireless negotiating, is based on an old-fashioned handshake. \"He has a huge respect for money, but a little bit more or a little bit less makes no difference to him.\"\n\nWith £1.5bn to his name, it's a position he can afford to take."
