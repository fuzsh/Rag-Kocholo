For decades, Italian comedies from this period, called comedy Italian style or commedia all’italiana, have been known through a handful of critically acclaimed productions, those that had the good fortune of commercialization outside Italy usually following an international prize, such as Pietro Germi’s stylistically innovative Divorce Italian Style (Divorzio all’italiana, 1961) and its unprecedented Oscar for Best Screenplay in 1963. However, such international recognitions, too sporadic in time, have tended to hide the immense number of productions made in Italy during the two decades. One of the primary goals of this publication is to provide readers with a comprehensive panorama of comedy Italian style, beginning with the late fifties and continuing until the late seventies, in tandem with an in-depth investigation of how these films functioned within a society in an economic and social state of flux. This sophisticated comedy movement, led by a group of prolific screenwriters and promoted by outstanding actors and directors, successfully convinced popular audiences and film critics of the quality and value of comedy as a cinematographic genre. In fact, its inherent ability for collective observation and what appeared to be a noticeable disregard for morality made films of the commedia all’italiana an accurate social barometer and a powerful tool to mirror the time’s struggles within Italian society and its many calamities. An important point to note is that the definition of the commedia all’italiana, awkwardly translated in English as comedy Italian style, could lead readers and spectators to an indistinguishable terminology conundrum since commedia all’italiana remotely evokes the literary period known as the commedia\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\ndell’arte (which as will be noted in a moment influenced it in specific ways) as well as the postwar commercial genre known as neorealismo rosa. Therefore, it is important to note the chronological constraints of the commedia all’italiana (1958–1979) as well as its directed thematic interests. More a movement than a genre itself, comedy Italian style consistently presented a prevailing dose of social satire using popular comedic elements to represent contemporary Italian society. For the above-mentioned reasons, this study does not include films such as Steno’s highly popular An American in Rome (Un americano a Roma, 1954), the Don Camillo saga, the innumerable films featuring Totò, Vittorio De Sica’s Marriage Italian Style (Matrimonio all’italiana, 1964), Mario Monicelli’s L’armata Brancaleone (1966), Alberto Sordi’s Stardust (Polvere di stelle, 1973) and Smoke over London (Fumo di Londra, 1966), or Luciano Salce’s Fantozzi series whose endless sequels hit the national box office from 1975 to 1996, among others; these films never belonged to the commedia all’italiana movement. The movement drew inspiration from a number of sources, uniquely combined and in varying ways, to reflect the mood at the time and consistently result in an unpredictable tragedy (i.e., from television, commercial cinema, and reality itself). One of the sources of commedia all’italiana is the abovementioned literary movement, the commedia dell’arte, but it was equally inspired by popular culture and directly confronted the religious, economic, political, and social angst of the changing climate in Italy. The present volume examines the evolution of the genre and its thematics in chronological order. It is divided into three parts, each part corresponding to a decade (fifties, sixties, and seventies), and further subdivided into chapters. Each chapter offers the historical context, a discussion of the genre development, and a consideration of the period’s most representative directors, films, and actors. Chapter one, “The Forerunners,” explores the different inspirational sources of Italian comedic elements in films from its introduction at the turn of the twentieth century. More than just an adaptation or review of theatrical comedies, Italian film comedies included a range of influences, from their very own commedia dell’arte tradition of social satire to the influence of Hollywood comedies of the silent era, as well as the Telefoni Bianchi comedies from the prewar Cinecittà era. While actors often came from the stage of the Avanspettacolo, this chapter also emphasizes the role of seminal screenwriters who for the most part had collaborated in the production of satirical journals like the Marc’Aurelio in the 1930s. Chapter two, “The Age of Neorealismo Rosa,” narrates the development of Italian comedy during the postwar era and in particular the influence of neorealist cinema and its subsequent neorealismo rosa movement on popular audiences and comedy filmmakers. One of the most crucial sections of the present volume is the explanation of the fundamental differences between commedia italiana and commedia all’italiana; this careful delineation is made through a study of the work of Mario Monicelli and Steno’s Cops and Robbers (Guardie e ladri, 1951),\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nFederico Fellini’s I vitelloni (1953) and The Swindle (Il bidone, 1955), and of course, the influential Big Deal on Madonna Street (I soliti ignoti, 1958), making a strong impact on the community of future authors. The second part is called “The Years of Euphoria and the Commedia all’italiana” and begins with chapter three, “Italian Comedy in the 1960s,” a section that offers an overview of Italy during the years of the economic miracle or the so-called boom economico. This section offers a detailed synopsis of the Italian film industry in the 1960s through an examination of the role of state censorship during these years of profuse cinematographic productivity and innovation as well as an investigation of the reasons for the success of the commedia all’italiana. In addition, the second part of the chapter explores the so-called “art of getting by” in the commedia all’italiana, representing the prototype of modern Italian comedic characters. Chapter four, “The Protagonists of the New Comedy Style,” is organized around the most important filmmakers of the early sixties whose emblematic productions are the most representative of the new comedy in Italy. The list includes directors Dino Risi and his vivid social satires like The Monsters (I mostri, 1963) and The Easy Life (Il sorpasso, 1962), Mario Monicelli whose comedies often dealt with historical narratives like The Great War (La grande guerra, 1959), Luigi Comencini and Everybody Go Home (Tutti a casa, 1960), Pietro Germi with two seminal comedies centered on the south, most notably with the internationally acclaimed Divorce Italian Style (Divorzio all’italiana, 1961), as well as directors like Alberto Lattuada with Mafioso (1963), Antonio Pietrangeli’s The Magnificent Cuckold (Il magnifico cornuto, 1964), and Luigi Zampa’s Il vigile (1960). The third and final part, called “The Final Act of the commedia all’italiana,” begins with chapter five, “Italian Comedy in the 1970s,” and introduces a detailed analysis of the political situation during the “Lead Years,” then shifts to examine the Italian film industry of the 1970s and the economic dilemma within the cinematographic industry that resulted with the deregulation of media laws and the subsequent greater presence and importance of television. In addition, this chapter focuses on Italian comedy following the economic boom with a careful eye to what Ettore Scola’s filmmaking and his emblematic discourse of cynicism accomplished as well as how Marco Ferreri’s inclination for the “grotesque style” exerted an influence on other Italian filmmakers, even outside the realm of film comedy. Finally, chapter six “The Last Protagonists,” presents the most important productions of the last decade, many of which were often mistaken for dramas due to the high level of cynicism, unconventionality, and tragic endings. The main protagonists of the final decade represented, although each with idiosyncratic humor, a scathing portrait of an amoral society; these include Dino Risi by now the most expert comedy filmmaker, Lina Wertmüller with her own exuberance and cinematographic virtuosity, Federico Fellini who accomplished a successful return to comedy, Alberto Sordi and his humanistic vision of social comedies, Mario Monicelli with the treatment of difficult subjects, and finally Luigi Comencini with his usual depth in terms of composition and narrative structure.\n\nxiv\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nIn an effort to acquaint English-speaking readers with some of the most emblematic dialogues and place in relief Italian humor of the commedia all’italiana, I have placed translations of film dialogues within the book. Because most of the original screenplays are not available or simply have never been published, I directly transcribed the dialogues from visual supports (mainly DVDs) and then translated the excerpts (with the assistance of film and language experts) into English, maintaining intact as much as possible the meaning and nature of Italian humor (instead of transcribing English subtitles which are often restrictive and inaccurate or translating faithfully the words). Whereas Continuum and the author have made every effort to identify holders of copyright materials used in this book, in some particular instances this was not always possible and we would like to extend our sincerest apologies to any copyright holders whose rights we may have unintentionally missed. If any omission exists, Continuum welcomes suggestions, and when possible will include them in any future editions of the work.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMy deepest gratitude goes to Dino Risi, who received me on three occasions in Rome and graciously offered several of his own photographs, one of which is on the cover of this book. Many thanks to Mario Monicelli, who welcomed a phone interview just hours before leaving for Tunisia. I am also honored to have been hosted by Furio Scarpelli, who offered an exciting discussion on the origins of the commedia. I am most grateful to Carlo Verdone for a very pleasant and informative interview conducted in his home in Rome. Among the numerous people who have helped me throughout the development of this project, I would like to thank Evander Lomke, former senior editor at Continuum, without whom this publication would never have been possible. I would also like to thank David Barker, editorial director at Continuum, who took over the project with great interest until its completion, along with Amy Wagner, copyeditor, and Gabriella Page-Fort, publishing services supervisor. Comedy Italian Style greatly benefited from the expertise and passion of my longtime friend, Corrado Corradini, who, thanks to his unlimited knowledge of Italian cinema as well as his appreciation of linguistic subtleties, was able to reveal some of the enigmas of Italian humor. I am also indebted to Peter Bondanella for endorsing the book project and, as always, for giving me some invaluable feedback on Italian cinema. His book, Italian Cinema, which I first read in 1996, remains an inspiration. I would also like to express my gratitude to Jean Gili, who agreed to meet with me in Paris and shared his vast experience with Italian comedy. Many thanks to Danielle Hipkins, who generously shared an article she wrote for a film conference in London in October 2006. I would like to extend my gratitude to Fabrizio Corallo and Gioia Donati for helping me getting in touch with several key figures in the Italian film industry in Rome. For the documentation of this volume, I am indebted to Elisabetta Chiarotti, Rosaria Alba, and Antonella Felicioni xv\n\nxvi\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nfrom the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome who helped to locate valuable photographs, Andrea Amatiste from the Istituto Luce in Rome, and also to Maria Cidda and Umberto Cicconi from the Archivio Allori in Rome. In addition, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the staff of the library at Elon University library, with a special nod to Lynn Melchor, interlibrary loan coordinator, Sandra Kilpatrick, acquisition specialist, and Lynne Bisko, non-print librarian, for their rare aptitude for patience in light of my numerous unusual requests. Many thanks to Ilaria Cecchi from Archivio Reporters Associati in Rome, who offered her assistance on several photographs, and Ron Mandelbaum from the Photofest Archives in New York; to Giovanni Feliciotto from Taormina, who provided several films on DVD, as well as to the personnel from the Iconothèque at the Cinémathèque Francaise in Paris. On a personal note, I would like to thank my brother Jérôme for his technical assistance with photographs, as well as my cousins Rossana and Bruno, who many years ago screened several important Italian comedy films for me in their home in Milan. Many thanks to my friend Sandro Picchietti, with whom numerous hours were spent watching Amici miei endless times. My everlasting thanks also go to my father, Jean-Jacques, who always communicated his passion for Italian cinema and, in particular, for Federico Fellini. As a young child growing up in the seventies and discovering this new cinema, I developed a parallel fascination, which today is expressed in a concrete form. At last, I am very happy to thank, as well as to dedicate, this book to Kristin, my wife, whose patience once more have made this project possible and a finished product thanks to her knowledge of both English and Italian.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of the present book is to reintroduce some of the most prevalent and representative Italian film comedies of the 1960s and 1970s to English-speaking readers and spectators.

In addition, the second part of the chapter explores the so-called “art of getting by” in the commedia all’italiana, representing the prototype of modern Italian comedic characters. Chapter four, “The Protagonists of the New Comedy Style,” is organized around the most important filmmakers of the early sixties whose emblematic productions are the most representative of the new comedy in Italy. The list includes directors Dino Risi and his vivid social satires like The Monsters (I mostri, 1963) and The Easy Life (Il sorpasso, 1962), Mario Monicelli whose comedies often dealt with historical narratives like The Great War (La grande guerra, 1959), Luigi Comencini and Everybody Go Home (Tutti a casa, 1960), Pietro Germi with two seminal comedies centered on the south, most notably with the internationally acclaimed Divorce Italian Style (Divorzio all’italiana, 1961), as well as directors like Alberto Lattuada with Mafioso (1963), Antonio Pietrangeli’s The Magnificent Cuckold (Il magnifico cornuto, 1964), and Luigi Zampa’s Il vigile (1960). The third and final part, called “The Final Act of the commedia all’italiana,” begins with chapter five, “Italian Comedy in the 1970s,” and introduces a detailed analysis of the political situation during the “Lead Years,” then shifts to examine the Italian film industry of the 1970s and the economic dilemma within the cinematographic industry that resulted with the deregulation of media laws and the subsequent greater presence and importance of television. In addition, this chapter focuses on Italian comedy following the economic boom with a careful eye to what Ettore Scola’s filmmaking and his emblematic discourse of cynicism accomplished as well as how Marco Ferreri’s inclination for the “grotesque style” exerted an influence on other Italian filmmakers, even outside the realm of film comedy. Finally, chapter six “The Last Protagonists,” presents the most important productions of the last decade, many of which were often mistaken for dramas due to the high level of cynicism, unconventionality, and tragic endings. The main protagonists of the final decade represented, although each with idiosyncratic humor, a scathing portrait of an amoral society; these include Dino Risi by now the most expert comedy filmmaker, Lina Wertmüller with her own exuberance and cinematographic virtuosity, Federico Fellini who accomplished a successful return to comedy, Alberto Sordi and his humanistic vision of social comedies, Mario Monicelli with the treatment of difficult subjects, and finally Luigi Comencini with his usual depth in terms of composition and narrative structure.\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nIn an effort to acquaint English-speaking readers with some of the most emblematic dialogues and place in relief Italian humor of the commedia all’italiana, I have placed translations of film dialogues within the book. Because most of the original screenplays are not available or simply have never been published, I directly transcribed the dialogues from visual supports (mainly DVDs) and then translated the excerpts (with the assistance of film and language experts) into English, maintaining intact as much as possible the meaning and nature of Italian humor (instead of transcribing English subtitles which are often restrictive and inaccurate or translating faithfully the words). Whereas Continuum and the author have made every effort to identify holders of copyright materials used in this book, in some particular instances this was not always possible and we would like to extend our sincerest apologies to any copyright holders whose rights we may have unintentionally missed. If any omission exists, Continuum welcomes suggestions, and when possible will include them in any future editions of the work.\n\nChapter 1 The Forerunners The purpose of this first chapter is to offer a panoramic view of the different functions of traditional Italian comedies with respect to their recurrent and influential effect on the commedia all’italiana, also known as comedy Italian style, which surfaced between the late fifties and the early sixties. The secondary objective is a demonstration that the commedia all’italiana, although deeply rooted in historical conventions, radically differed from its ancestors: the prewar telefoni bianchi and the neorealismo rosa of the postwar era.1 The reasons for this radical transformation were several seminal and propitious contemporary events: the irresistible wind of change caused by the advent of the economic boom, the widespread distribution of television and resulting dynamics between small and large screen, the initial decline of state censorship over the film industry maintained for a decade by the Christian Democrat administration, and finally, exceptional artistic dynamics created by phenomenal actors, screenwriters, and filmmakers. Entirely original and idiosyncratic by nature, comedy Italian style was able to synthesize not only a new lifestyle, but also a national identity and a unique cinematography, which triggered an immediate enthusiastic response among popular audiences. With secured success at the box office, and growing support of producers, the commedia all’italiana successfully moved forward to become the financial backbone of the entire Italian film industry for well over the next two decades.\n\nThe Origins of Italian Comedy The volume’s central discussion answers seminal questions on the commedia’s identity to gain a more comprehensive vision of the genre, including the following: What is the fascination and influence of cynical comedies, social satires, and grotesque parodies? What is the relationship between comedy and narratives?\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nWhy do Italian comedies almost always include a minor yet significant dose of (un)predictable tragedy? Do Italian satires merely represent the product of literary ingenuity or the visual record of a quotidian human experience? Can a fictive comic tale have any significance with regard to morality, human psychology, or any other realm of philosophical reflection? Can a narration or screenplay enlighten the readers/spectators of popular culture about the complexities of human struggle? As Italian film historian Aldo Viganò once wrote, “There are two faithful sources of inspiration for Italian pop culture: lyrical opera and commedia dell’arte.”2 Therefore, it comes as no surprise that for Anglo-Saxon spectatorship, the Italian comic mind, heir of a long tradition of literary realism, makes its premise on a combination of authentic dramatic narratives contradicted by comic situations. Finally, the following reading of the present volume needs an imperative semantic clarification. Neglected by many film historians, the subtle differentiations between the different phases of evolution related to Italian comedy deserve today a long-awaited explicit articulation, which will shed light on the numerous and confusing labels attributed to the respective époques of the Italian comedy. The first that comes to mind is the prestigious commedia dell’arte, the ancient art of satirical theater from the Italian Renaissance, which often serves as a point of reference throughout the present volume, as it is the historical source of inspiration for the large part of Italian comedies. Second, the term commedia italiana often corresponds to the conventional bourgeois comedies of the postwar era, usually dominated by slapstick humor, many of which belong to the neorealismo rosa period. Finally, and most importantly, the term commedia all’italiana, also called “comedy Italian style,” designates comedies from approximately 1958 to 1979 that all share a common denominator: a new type of ruthless social satires under the lens of cynicism and grotesque. Therefore, for the sake of the present study’s comprehension, it is crucial for the reader to bear in mind the above-mentioned terminology. Before any attempt is made to draft definitions of comedy Italian style and conceptualize its principles, it is important to keep in mind that Italian humor has always shown inherent interest in observing reality and society faithfully while simultaneously presenting a “de-sacralizing” vision of the world. For centuries, Italian comedies have functioned as vehicles for social satires that ultimately represented the dark aspect of human nature and society’s evils. The golden age of Italian comedy, the commedia all’italiana, asserted itself at the very end of the 1950s to blossom in the 1960s and ended as a principal genre at the end of the 1970s.3 The phenomenon, the most prolific Italian cinematographic movement considering the number of long feature films produced in two consecutive decades, was the unexpected result of decades of long culmination from political and socioeconomic aftermaths. In his article “Le istituzioni\n\nThe Forerunners\n\ndel comico e la forma-commedia,” Maurizio Grande underlined the constant dilemma for comical protagonists—between acceptance into society and their rejection from it—through four different thematic contents of comedies: narratives linked to the integration into society, narratives linked to the forced adjustment to social norms, narratives linked to concealed identity, and narratives linked to lost innocence.4 One could easily superimpose an ensemble of subgenres to Grande’s categorization: comedies of societal customs, social satires, musical comedies, romantic comedies, burlesque comedies (including farces and vaudevilles), among others. However, in order to better understand the authentic nature and evolution of Italian satirical comedies, and despite the above-mentioned categorizations, the present volume will privilege both chronological and thematic approaches. Throughout the centuries of prolific national history, Italian popular culture has always valued humor as the ultimate weapon of wit; an impressive achievement if one considers the innumerable cultural referents to Italian comedy style around the world. Whether in the medieval conventions of short stories dear to Boccaccio’s Decameron and his strong vein of irony or sarcasm, or Renaissance taste for farces like Machiavelli’s La mandragola (1524), or the commedia dell’arte with Carlo Goldoni (1707–93), the so-called beffa (Italian medieval farce) has been at the epicenter of Italian comedy writers’ modus operandi. As previously mentioned, the primary intention of this chapter is to present the main traits that constituted Italian traditional comedy before the advent of the commedia all’italiana at the end of the 1950s. The goal is then to introduce some of the most prominent aspects of film forms, narratives, and history that contributed to the formation of the comedy genre between 1945 and circa 1958. Asserting that Italian comedy (as opposed to the commedia all’italiana) indirectly took its roots from the ancient Greek comedy is certainly nothing new, as the characterization during its development in history and its connection to its first early modern rendition with the medieval farce, also known as the beffa, and, of course, the commedia dell’arte after the sixteenth century, has been the center of attention of much scholarly research. And it is precisely this improvisational theater, which for more than four centuries has shaped and defined Italian humor and comedy until the present. Filmmaker Mario Monicelli (b. in 1915), author of numerous comedy films over the course of seven decades, gave a persuasive definition of the ancient tradition, stressing the importance of the combination of laughter and despair as an omnipresent theme in Italian comedy: This is truly part of the Italian tradition; it’s something that comes from the commedia dell’arte. Commedia dell’arte heroes are always desperate poor devils who are battling against life, against the world, against hunger, misery, illness, violence. Nevertheless, all of this is transformed into laughter, transmuted into cruel joking, in mockery rather then\n\n10\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE wholehearted laughter. This approach belongs to a very Italian tradition that I have always defended.5\n\nThe commedia dell’arte was not only known for its astute protagonists who successfully and happily trespassed on established social rules or for its legendary use of masks and improvisation, but also for its inherent ability to promote prolific dialogues, a quintessential dynamic of the artistic performance. The commedia dell’arte of Arlecchino, servitore du due padroni, was in a certain sense conjuring misery and injustice by evoking the possibility that he could refuse the established order and established forms of power. Though limited in its audience scope, the commedia discourse was a flickering light of hope, soon perfected by Molière (1622–73) and later Carlo Goldoni (who despite the improvement brought to the genre, institutionalized its dynamics and consequently fossilized them into literary conventions).6 Whether satire, parody, farce, or even simple burlesque comedies, contemporary Italian humor has excelled in its popular proliferation by effectively transforming any given dimension of ridicule into a sophisticated work of derision. During its two glorious decades, comedy Italian style possessed an inherent particularity, as it appeared to be a genre without a myth or rather mythical paradigm (unlike Westerns, Peplums, or historical films, which all included it), as Italian film scholar Aldo Viganò noted: Unlike Westerns, horror films, musical comedies or melodrama, comedy is in fact a genre without mythological characters and places. Its main referent is never something archaic and universal, but rather is linked to quotidian life and [harsh] reality.7 Indeed, the examination of the specific uses of humor in the commedia provides a thorough understanding of the role of the films and their intended focus on the vicissitudes of Italian individuals struggling in daily life through the advent of modernity and economic changes (as Totò often liked to remind film critics “misery is the script of true comedy”). This introduction illuminates the present perspective on this under-explored yet extremely popular entertainment genre, and the profound disposition of Italian satires to provide sociological interrogations, introspective examinations, and perhaps to reveal its indifference (or excess of critical distance) towards the film medium itself. According to Ettore Scola, “The commedia all’italiana comes from anonymous parents, but we are all sons of the commedia all’italiana.”8 Coming from one of its most prolific writers, this battuta implies the unfathomable dimension of the origins and its endless quest for the original creators. The many varieties of comic disciplines would certainly constitute too vast and diverse of a field for an introduction to this genre. Therefore, it is from the absence of emotional and historical background (or mythical entourage) that the new comedy Italian style\n\nThe Forerunners\n\n11\n\ncreated its very own, straight out from the daily reality of the booming sixties, such as in Vittorio De Sica’s Il boom (1963), Dino Risi’s A Difficult Life (Una vita difficile, 1961), or The Easy Life (Il sorpasso, 1962).\n\nThe Silent Era and the Prestige of Hollywood Comedies Evolving into the third largest film industry (far behind France and the U.S.) due to its organizational atomization and lack of centralized structures, Italian silent productions were mainly dominated by an inclination toward historical reconstitutions (i.e., Mario Caserini and Eleuterio Rodolfi’s Last Days of Pompeii [Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei, 1913] or Enrico Guazzoni’s Marc’Antonio e Cleopatra, 1913). Italian comedies of the silent era were characterized by the success of the Cretinetti series (authored and interpreted by French actor André Deed before World War I) and the so-called “comica finale,” a popular subgenre usually presented after the screening of long feature films of cinematographic shows. One of the popular comic genres was burlesque comedy, whose culmination extended from the invention of the cinematograph (1895 in Lyon, France) to the last years of World War I. The best representative was dramaturge and screenwriter Lucio d’Ambra (1880–1939) who collaborated with many filmmakers, including Carmine Gallone, an immensely popular professional. With silent productions such as Il re, le torri, gli alfieri (1916), Wives and Oranges (Le mogli e le arance, 1917), Il girotondo degli undici lancieri (1919), all directed and written by d’Ambra, a new influential style became popular among general audiences (reportedly inspiring Ernst Lubitsch himself). However, over the course of a few years, d’Ambra’s appreciation slowly diminished with the Italian public for its lack of renewal and ambition, as his style was often compared to commedie leggere (a slightly pejorative term to describe less innovative narratives meaning in Italian “light” comedies). The silent film era was described as a very codified art, and therefore did not possess much leverage for innovation, which explains why Italian comedy was never prolific nor competitive during these early years (i.e., with the exception of Alessandro Blasetti’s Sole! in 1928, and Mario Camerini’s Rotaie in 1929 being distributed abroad). Unlike France, which did not have a similar multidialectal situation but benefited from an important production of silent film comedies, Italy was gifted with many different regional vernaculars and therefore dialect comedies had to wait for the advent of sound in order to flourish. The battuta or comic line made its beginnings on the large screen and served as a catalyst for popular audiences to remember a film for its memorable line rather than physical feats of skill. Two actors can be labeled as the modern forefathers of the future comedy Italian style. Famous in part due to his play entitled Nerone (1917), and later in Alessandro Blasetti’s film version Nerone (1930), Ettore Petrolini\n\n12\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\n(1884–1936) developed an artistic significance with the long-time neglected farce genre reminiscent of the commedia dell’arte. In this pioneering “sound” satire on the excesses generated by the lust of power, Petrolini’s multiple personae were able to coax and elude the censorship of the Fascist regime. Along with Petrolini, Raffaele Viviani (1888–1950), the other celebrated albeit shortlived protagonist of the Neapolitan theater scene, specialized in comedy rooted among the lower depths of society (far from Eduardo De Filippo’s bourgeois comedies, as for instance with Alessandro Blasetti’s La tavola dei poveri, 1932). Since the golden age of the commedia dell’arte, tragic and comic elements had never been so close. In these days, comedies not only depended on genuine feats of skills and other physical tours de force, but were also regulated on precise comedic timing. The crescendo preceding a liberating battuta had to be synchronized to the right moment: a second too late or too early and an entire scene could lose its effect, miss its point, and ultimately let a film fall into oblivion. The silent era eventually came to an end in the late twenties with the first talking pictures from America (Alan Crossland’s The Jazz Singer, 1927), bringing a wind of change to all Europeans national cinemas. In 1930, Gennaro Righelli’s La canzone dell’amore (1930), based on a short story written by Luigi Pirandello (1867–1936), coincidentally named In Silenzio, opened the way for many successful musical comedies, as it was also the very first Italian “talking” motion picture film to be released in Italian theaters the following year. With the urgent need to reestablish themselves with the Italian cinema industry, many veteran Italian filmmakers and comedy authors found inspiration from comedies made in Hollywood. Inspired by the American comedy tradition made famous by Howard Hawks’ Bringing Up Baby (1938), Ernst Lubitsch’s Ninotchka (1939), Frank Capra’s It Happened One Night (1934), George Cukor’s The Philadelphia Story (1940), or later Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot (1959), Italian comedies of the prewar era maintained a similar cinematography, albeit in their own style, many of which ranged from character-driven absurd humor to compilations of clever gags.9 Some similarities are worth noting, such as the happy ending so characteristic of Hollywood comedies in the late 1930s and subsequently implemented in the telefoni bianchi comedies (literally known as “white telephone”). In addition, protagonists evolved in an Italy rather unknown to popular audiences, one in which money, luxury, and fictive romance stood light-years away from the spectatorship’s quotidian life. In a similar manner to its American counterpart, Italian comedy protagonists rarely dealt with money concerns on screen (with the exception of Camerini’s I Will Give a Million [Darò un milione] starring Vittorio De Sica in 1936).10 Perhaps the most compelling difference that persisted between the two national comedy styles was the predominance of the notion of “dream” attainable in Hollywood narratives whereas Italian comedy offered more realistic endings; though neglected in the narratives, social elements and their\n\nThe Forerunners\n\n13\n\nineluctable consequences eventually regained their relevance at the end of Italian films. With the prestige of Hollywood comedies reaching out to Italian writers and producers, a strong element of choreography surfaced in new comedies of the sound era, inspired by musical comedies, and their inherent theatricalization of the plot, all converging toward a greater cinematic sophistication.\n\nThe Prewar Era, Cinecettà, and Telefoni Bianchi Italian cinema in the thirties was dominated by the omnipresent censorship of the Fascist regime, and when it was not solicited, most filmmakers, like Mario Camerini or Alessandro Blasetti, took upon themselves an even more disconcerting phenomenon of self-censorship. Although comedy could have been the only genre to possibly outsmart the wheels of Mussolini’s censorship, no significant production could claim such a feat. Romantic comedies, melodramatic cinema, and sophisticated narrations inspired by the refined comedies made in Hollywood all came from the same mold; these comedies stood light-years away from the contemporary hardships encountered by Italian popular audiences. The “a-temporal” approach to narration clearly defined the new comic genre of the decade in Italy. Following the Fascist regime’s modest and temporary conquest of colonial victories in Africa (Ethiopia in May 1936 along with the protectorate of Libya, Eritrea, and Somalia), the government drove Italian popular audiences toward new allegorical horizons: fictionalized realities became the norm and blurred the then current political realities. In addition, the scarcity of innovation and the lack of thematic diversity contributed to the temporary stagnation of the comedy genre. Mussolini’s decision to implement a partial ban on the importation of Hollywood films (January 1, 1939) left Italian comedies with little or no competition; in response, Hollywood’s major distributors—MGM, Paramount, Twentieth Century Fox, and Warner Bros—withdrew from the Italian market in protest. Despite the unusual international climate that favored a strategy of “easy escapism,” the decade produced some fine Italian comedies. The revelation came from a young Neapolitan actor, Vittorio De Sica, who quickly proved to become the prodigy of the prewar era. He featured in Mario Camerini’s What Scoundrels Men Are! (Gli uomini che mascalzoni, 1932) followed by similar successes in I’ll Give a Million (Darò un milione, 1936), Mister Max (Il signor Max, 1937), and Department Store (I grandi magazzini, 1939). With the exception of Camerini’s cinema, which displayed a modest attempt to satirize, all the comedy films of the decade employed the same model: mundane bourgeois comedies that had few innovations or unexpected twists. This era of the so-called telefoni bianchi (“white telephones”), which began in 1937 and ended in 1941, was defined by a period of political jubilation as well as a popular euphoria with the rediscovery by middle-class Italians of the\n\n14\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\npossibilities for entertainment (in great part generated by Fascist propaganda). Consequently, the entertainment industry, and cinema in particular, were the first to benefit from this emerging trend, which also corresponded with the inauguration of the mythical Cinecittà on April 28, 1937. The short-lived phenomenon could best be epitomized by an artistic orientation to display (more or less forcefully) a glamorous cinematography that included at least one scene of a luxurious interior with protagonists using the emblematic white telephone (symbol of wealth and elegance as opposed to the common and ordinary black telephone). Once again, many filmmakers felt compelled to self-censor and consequently turned their expertise toward a so-called “light comedy” style that included the artists’ comic battute. With World War II, the wind changed, and Italian popular audiences began to realize that these comedies no longer corresponded with their expectations, in terms of entertainment, and the phenomenon disappeared as quickly as it had surfaced a few years earlier. Alessandro Blasetti’s Four Steps in the Clouds (Quattro passi fra le nuvole, 1942), which heralded the advent of the first neorealism elements in comedies, confirmed the trend of the moment to search for tangible answers rather than inaccessible dreams.\n\nThe Marc’ Aurelio and the New Screenwriters Italian satirical comedies, unlike the French and the Anglo-Saxon, had the unique ability to observe signs of the time without artistic concession. The compelling observations of postwar-era Italy revealed the difficult, quite humoristic apprenticeship of democracy as unprecedented political events evolved with an ever-increasing speed. As World War II came to an abrupt end, and as Italy prepared for its colossal reconstruction effort, the question of popular entertainment remained predominant in its relevance to the evolution of culture among Italian popular audiences. One of the predominant concerns of film scholars was the preoccupation of the genre’s literary origins. In the case of the commedia dell’arte, the answer, as previously mentioned, evoked the ancient literary source as an evident inspiration in its form and content, while commedia all’italiana seems to be just the opposite. As a matter of fact, one could take this idea further along by arguing that indeed no contemporary literature can rightly claim exclusive paternity of the new comedy genre since most of its inspiration came from oral sources. With the exception of satirical journals, the entire paradigm came from the people and in its literary elite. Director Mario Monicelli describes the fundamental nonliterary dimension of comedy Italian style: Most likely, Un borghese piccolo piccolo [was] not a commedia all’italiana. Above all, coming from a novel from [Vincenzo] Cerami, it did not have\n\nThe Forerunners\n\n15\n\nthat intention. It became a commedia all’italiana only because it has been interpreted by Sordi.11 Italian satirical publications were one of the important bases of development of comic films during the first part of the twentieth century. One of them, the Marc’Aurelio, founded in Rome in 1914, was a prosperous satirical magazine, which included many renowned collaborators during the Fascist years of the 1930s, such as Vittorio Metz (1904–84) and Cesare Zavattini (1902–89). Its success triggered the creation of similar periodicals, like Bertoldo, begun in Milan in 1937 by Giovannino Guareschi (1908–68) and Giovanni Mosca (1908–83), and later, the Candido in 1945, which produced a long series of vignettisti caricaturisti (caricaturists) whose caustic and nonconformist satirical humor was extremely popular among the Italian middle class. These prewar-era years became important as the moment when a new modern comic mind took shape, entirely original and extremely fertile in comedic appeal. Vittorio Metz himself defined the new comedy style: We Italian humorists stand out from French and what is considered English humor, since for years we have evolved on a completely different field. Our [humor] is animated, dismaying, fulminating, a violent comedy that has the rare quality to reach easily both intellectuals and the people.12 Thanks to its surrealist tone, the Marc’Aurelio avoided much government censorship, as the bulk of its satirical caricatures were taken from everyday life or chronicles of daily newspapers. By the end of the decade, it had a prosperous turnout of 400,000 copies per edition, and was in its own way a medium of resistance to fascism, as with subtle persuasion it was able to convey a humor underlying the fictitious integrity of the Fascist press. The Marc’Aurelio, though benefiting from a national prestige, had to compete with other publications such as Il Travaso, La Tribuna, Don Basilio, Calendario, or Bufamario. From this unprecedented concentration of talent, a new generation of screenwriters was born, whose particularity did not emerge from the traditional mold of cinematographic critique but rather a literary background, already comfortable with transformation of the content of quotidian reality into witty vignettes. After the war, most of them entered the Italian film industry to collaborate on screenplays for the neorealist comedies, a genre in high demand. Screenwriters like Vitaliano Brancati13 (1907–54), Achille Campanile14 (1899–1977), Oreste Del Buono (1923–2003), Federico Fellini15 (1920–93), Alessandro Continenza16 (1920–96), Ennio de Concini17 (b. 1923), Ennio Flaiano18 (1910–72), Ruggero Maccari19 (1919–89), Marcello Marchesi20 (1912–78), Steno21 (1915–88), and Ettore Scola22 (b. 1931) met regularly in public places and in one in particular bar, the now famous “Otello della Concordia,” in via della croce in Rome.\n\n16\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nInterestingly enough, the momentum of the satirical publications as well as the interest in the tradition of avanspettacolo diminished during the postwar era before falling into oblivion at the end of the 1950s, coincidently corresponding with the sudden advent of the commedia all’italiana on the big screen. It was precisely the avanspettacolo (comic shows presented before a live audience in between two feature films), a subgenre of comedy/theater that gained visible notoriety between the 1930s and the first years of the economic boom. Heir of the teatro di varietà (variety shows), the avanspettacolo was designed to entertain popular audiences before the screening of the main feature film, hence its brief duration. Because of the unpredictable nature of the comic challenge, the genre was never considered an authentic protagonist of the comedy scene, though it was the springboard of many artists like Ettore Petrolini, the forerunner of the genre, and also Erminio Macario (1902–80), Totò (1898–1967), and Renato Rascel (1912–91), among others.\n\nNotes These comedies also evoke, for the most part, a sense of remote past that directly recalls the image of an anarchical medieval time, much like Boccaccio’s Decameron and the famous beffa (medieval farce). 2 Aldo Viganò, Commedia italiana in cento film (Genoa: Le mani, 1995), 11. 3 Dino Risi was the first filmmaker to openly criticize the new label generated by the Italian critique. The main contention was based on the fact that the title all’italiana denied the Italian specificity of what was done before: “Perché questo giudizio limitativo, riduttivo? Le commedie prodotte in America si chiamano commedie americane, quelle che facciamo in Italia su delle situazioni e dei problemi nazionali, chiamamole commedie italiane e basta. I critici amano le etichette, le formule che spesso si rivelano odiose, nocive e il più delle volte improprie.” (“Why such a limiting and reductive judgment? Comedies produced in America are called American comedies; the ones we do in Italy on problems and situations of national scale, let’s call them Italian comedies, and that’s it. Critics love labels, formulas that at the end prove to be awful, negative and most of the time inappropriate.” Translated from Italian by the author.)

Its intellectual integrity and force not only drove many filmmakers to adopt and apply its artistic point of view for other genres (drama, comedies, documentaries, and so forth), but it also represented the only cinema worthexportation for other spectatorships at the end of the 1940s. Comedy was also at that time a vector for new cinematographic concepts. As Mario Monicelli described it, neorealism was not the only way to put twenty years of hardship and misery behind, and in its own way, humor on the big screen could move crowds, albeit not with the realistic vision of Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Thief (Ladri di biciclette, 1948) or Roberto Rossellini’s Germany Year Zero (Germania, anno zero, 1948), but it opened new perspectives to the popular audience. As Mario Monicelli stated, “Laughter became a chance for redemption, a liberating experience, the losers’ voice that was rising against the social rules.” 1\n\nNeorealism and Neorealismo Rosa in Question According to French historian Jean Gili, the new observation of reality through a sensible social conscience during the wake of World War II broke new ground in the intimate rapport between Italian comedy and social conscience: “Neorealism put the comedy genre back on a road it should have never left, if it were not for twenty years of Fascism: the observation by humor, irony, satire of Italy’s social problems.”2 Caught between a film genre and a cinematographic movement, Italian neorealism, against all odds, served as a vehicle to reorganize and conceptualize a genre almost abandoned by most talented comedy filmmakers. In 1945, Italian general audiences were 19\n\n20\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nexperiencing a serious “deficit in laughter,” but despite the noncomical nature of neorealist cinematography, the latter was able to inspire countless comedy filmmakers. This connection to neorealism is obvious with the legendary scene in Roberto Rossellini’s Open City (Roma, città aperta, 1945) where Don Pietro Pellegrini (Aldo Fabrizi), a priest working clandestinely for the resistance, hits an old man with a cooking pan in order to keep him silent while nearby German soldiers search the building. This episode became the emblematic scene par excellence of what neorealism had to convey toward future genres self-proclaimed as heirs of its legacy. For screenwriter Rodolfo Sonego, the comedy element even in the darkest tragedies such as Rossellini’s Open City was acting as a safety valve, a device without which no narrative could fully operate in the spectators’ mind. As Italian film scholar Pietro Pintus explained: The comic element becomes the catalyst for the evil present inside the narrative material. Probably, [it is] a necessity not only for the author but for the audience that leads to building humoristic solutions in order to digest this evil, this tragedy.3 One of the prominent filmmakers directly inspired by the neorealist movement was Luciano Emmer, with Domenica d’agosto (1950) and Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna (1953). Both films, coauthored by screenwriter Sergio Amidei (1904–81) and inspired by parallel narrative structures reminiscent of Rossellini’s Paisà, presented a multitude of characters that energized the screen with a new comicità generated by situations that mixed collective experience with individuality. Another example was Mario Monicelli’s Toto Looks for an Apartment (Totò cerca casa, 1949), an early film dealing with a contemporary issue whose implications were urgent social issues (the question of housing in those years of the postwar era). Vitttorio De Sica’s Miracle in Milan (Miracolo a Milano, 1951), though not a comedy per se, uniquely added a fantastic dimension to a comedic narrative. Though the film included a myriad of visual innovations, it was never considered part of the neorealismo rosa (romanticized comedies through the lens of realism) as it appeared in most anthologies of Italian comedies, since its tone and style clearly differed from mainstream popular comedies of the decade (a forerunner of magic realism rather than commedia all’italiana). In addition to the above-mentioned comedies, it is important to point out some other comedy experiences whose commercial release as well as artistic achievement contributed to the history of Italian comedies. These films include Gennaro Righelli’s Down with Misery (Abbasso la miseria, 1948), Luigi Zampa’s L’onorevole Angelina (1948), Monicelli’s Vita da cani (1950), and Steno and Monicelli’s Guardie e ladri (1951)—the latter will be studied further in this introduction.\n\nThe Age of Neorealismo Rosa\n\n21\n\nAs the box office of the decade revealed, the comedy genre was highly popular in the postwar years, as many filmmakers invested time and money in order to produce popular comedies (i.e., Totò made 64 comedy films between 1945 and 1960 and a total of 107 in his entire career). Unlike many other comic actors, Totò’s films always included a social background that depicted an element of misery inherent in Italian society’s lower class. One example, illustrated in Monicelli’s Totò cerca casa, brilliantly depicted the tragedy of homelessness and severe unemployment. As evident as the present connection with the neorealist movement may be, the immediate postwar era is still remembered to this day for its exceptional neorealist productions rather than the comedies themselves. Concomitantly with the conclusion of the neorealist experience, a new comedy flavor surfaced under the label of neorealismo rosa, and gained importance and recognition from Italian popular audiences. This comedy style never was, nor was intended to be, a subgenre of neorealism, though the name may bring confusion to whom the paternity of the genre should befall (the first reason that comes to mind being its remote interest in social and political issues). In addition, the new comedy style was limited in its organization, themes, and artistic development; dependent on conventional narrative frames; and rarely in tune with the social economic and political contemporary background. Neorealismo rosa came from a combination of neorealism (for lead actors) and avanspettacolo scenarios (for supporting roles). Unlike neorealism, which began before the end of the war, neorealismo rosa originated at the beginning of the 1950s to compensate the neorealist artistic preponderance (though only a small minority of Italian moviegoers saw the neorealist masterpieces at a time when “sad” films were not commercially successful). So the question of a potential reaction may be better explained in terms of inspiration rather than opposition. The roots of neorealismo rosa should be examined with the same method as for neorealism: as a reaction to the war and two decades of fictionalized propaganda. As Ettore Scola explained: During those years, as a possible reaction to neorealism, to its grave and tragic films on Italy destroyed by bombs and poverty, the first Italian comedies were characterized by superficial films, which used anything to make people laugh but were not completely honest.4 Scola is right in his assertion that neorealismo rosa wanted to move away from the patterns of neorealism, even though at the end it appeared to be a reaction to prewar comedies (1930s as well as 1940s) more than a reaction to neorealism. The neorealismo rosa definition could be best described as an authentic observation of pseudodramatic reality through a comic lens. One of the characteristics attributed to the new neorealismo rosa was its prominent element of qualunquismo (indifference), reducing social issues to the\n\n22\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\ntrivial or remote background. Sentimentalism was usually at the basis of the plot, the inexorable love intrigue as a primary narrative element, as for instance, in the manifesto film from Luigi Comencini entitled Bread, Love and Dreams (Pane, amore e fantasia, 1953) followed a year later by Bread, Love and Jealousy (Pane, amore e gelosia, 1954) starring Gina Lollobrigida and Vittorio De Sica. With such casts, the new genre was far from the precepts of neorealism, since their productions used very few nonprofessional actors.5 Another major difference with the preceding movement was the substitution of a sociopolitical investigation by a custom satire heavily based on national or regional characterizations, as for instance, in Vittorio De Sica’s The Gold of Naples (L’oro di Napoli, 1954). Coincidentally, it was during these years of commercial success generated by the neoreaslimo rosa that the Italian comic cinema experienced an unprecedented distortion of its own nature by associating with a movement rather than a genre, which in theory had little in common with centuries of comedy tradition. While many old-school filmmakers happily embraced the movement (Alessandro Blasetti, Mauro Bolognini, Camillo Mastrocinque, Vittorio De Sica, or Luigi Comencini, who later joined the cause of the commedia all’italiana), a few young directors kept a critical distance from the movement. Although very slow in its expansion, this artistic change brought the simple desire to establish a much sharper vision (i.e., Mario Monicelli and Dino Risi), a new point of view that watched society and its social evils under a microscope. The horrors of war, the devastations and the endemic misery rapidly brought Italian audiences to reality and confirmed the deceitful content of two decades of Fascist propaganda\n\nTotò (Ferdinando Esposito) in Mario Monicelli’s Cops and Robbers (Guardie e ladri, 1951)\n\nThe Age of Neorealismo Rosa\n\n23\n\nas well as escapism. As a matter of fact, neorealismo rosa never was intended to be a transgression of neorealism; on the contrary, far from being a last interval of its process, it was actually the logical evolution of a genre that had never been able to experience success on a critical level. Under the leadership of Mario Monicelli or Dino Risi, many filmmakers understood that taboo subjects or politically incorrect materials, which could not be faithfully represented on the screen through drama, were in fact partly achievable through comedy. The Italian public, which was not necessarily inclined to openly discuss certain subjects (i.e., sexuality, adultery, or religion), was receptive to the same delicate matter as long as it could adopt a convincingly derisive point of view. So in the early years of the postwar era, and in particular the period subsequent to the establishment of the Christian Democrat government, censorship took new targets to eventually assert itself more powerfully. As paradoxical as it may appear, Fascist censorship was less active as authors exerted a higher level of self-censorship. The Christian Democrat censorship was therefore more aggressive against filmmakers and producers, requiring sometimes twenty cuts in one single feature film (the case of Mario Monicelli’s Totò and Carolina [Totò e Carolina] in 1955). As a consequence, comedies of the 1950s greatly suffered from state censorship, which in many cases prevented the freedom to depict social injustices, with their burden of situational absurdity often indirectly incriminating the responsibility of the Christian Democrat order. This explains in part why so many producers, anticipating a secured investment with Totò’s persona and his unalterable national popularity, never dared to change the course of his art direction, thus remaining limited in their social commentary (adding more farce to his acting repertoire was therefore the safe thing to do). In light of the omnipresent limitations, many comedy authors experienced great difficulty differentiating themselves from the “sophisticated” comedies of the preceding decade (i.e., Mario Bonnard Before the Postman [Avanti c’è posto, 1942]). The result was light comedies with little critical substance to offer. So was there a conscious effort from the perspective of the screenwriters to bring a significant dose of nobility to the genre? A pertinent question indeed when taking into consideration that up to that date the genre was destined to amuse popular audiences in need of quick entertainment given the difficult reality of the postwar reconstruction effort. Furio Scarpelli commented on the ephemeral aspect of immediate postwar comedies, arguing that authors were convinced that the comic films were to last a season, a summer at least, and fall into oblivion for eternity since no playback devices existed at the time: “Had we known that years later critics would reexamine them, perhaps we would have made them differently…. We would not have written things so lightly, just to laugh.”6 Here, in all modesty, Furio Scarpelli failed to mention that the exceptional quality of comedy writers rapidly compensated the lack of time required to prepare the filmmakers’ screenplays.\n\n24\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nDespite all the novelty brought by neorealismo rosa, Italian comedy of the mid-fifties was still very far from the advent of the commedia all’italiana. The collective humor of the 1950s, also known as commedia corale, continued to dominate the large screen with the exception of Totò, whose individuality had always made himself his “own genre.” Despite the reconstruction efforts collectively congregating Italians from all regions and all social origins, the new country remained very much an individualist nation, where spontaneous gatherings remained scarce (besides in the work or social sphere). As pointed out by British historian Paul Ginsborg: In other regions, especially the Veneto and some parts of Lombardy, the strongest tradition of collective action and solidarity was a Catholic one, of mutual aid and cooperative societies. In many part of the South, and not only the South, the only forms of collective action were feast days and pilgrimages.7 Along with the predominance of collective humor, the conventional patriarchal apprehension about women’s sexuality and its social promotion was evidently more and more present within Italian comedies. Camillo Mastrocinque’s Totò, Peppino, and the Hussy (Totò, Peppino e la malafemmina, 1956); Alessandro Blasetti’s Lucky to Be a Woman (La fortuna di essere donna, 1956); Mario Costa’s Arrivano i dollari (1957); Vittorio Sala’s Costa azzurra (1959); Mauro Bolognini’s Wild Love (Gli innamorati, 1955); Giorgio Bianchi’s The Moralist (Il moralista, 1959); Vittorio De Sica’s The Gold of Naples (L’oro di Napoli, 1954); and Antonio Pietrangeli’s The Bachelor (Lo scapolo, 1955) are just a handful of examples representing female sexuality still struggling to break new ground in terms of identity and representation, still remote from what will be obtained less than a decade later. This characteristic was all the more pertinent that masculinity 8 was also associated with childhood. As Gunsberg wrote on comedy: The comic association of masculinity with childhood in a number of comedies, especially in its propensity for play rather than work, and in its toying with consumerism, might be taken as an indication that Italy was not ready to deal with the rapidity spreading consumer culture.9 The comedies of the 1950s presented distinctive narratives, all of which included numerous equivocal situations, quid pro quos, travestiments, personality exchanges. In a nutshell, and to paraphrase Enrico Giacovelli’s phrase, they corresponded to an imborghesimento della commedia di borgata (a growing element of bourgeoisie in nonurban comedy).10 While the urban settings inspired countless comedies, new locations began to surface with the “beach comedy,” midway between the pseudopastoral style of comedies of the postwar era and the future urban fast-paced comedies of the economic boom\n\nThe Age of Neorealismo Rosa\n\n25\n\n(adventurous comedies heralding the future era of consumerism, first-time romantic affairs, extramarital relations, discotheques, partial nudity, implicit sexuality). Alberto Lattuada’s The Beach (La spiaggia, 1954), starring French heartthrob Martine Carol, was an example of the trend. Though prominent at home, the Italian film industry could not compete abroad with foreign industries and exported a relatively small number of long feature films. In light of this economic situation, most producers had no other choice but to concentrate on a national audience, choosing to illustrate the quotidian of their existence on the large screen. After the boom of the 1960s, many producers also became distributors. For many filmmakers, it was a major setback for creativity and their margin for freedom. By being compelled to satisfy popular audiences, producers were less attentive to the filmmakers’ request and more concerned with popular spectatorship trends (i.e., the request for more erotically charged motion pictures). The decade never saw a real proliferation of political satires. Two exceptions were Luigi Zampa’s The Art of Getting Along (L’arte di arrangiarsi, 1954) that indirectly alluded to the capacity of politicians to adapt and reinvent for the different political époques of modern Italy, and, of course, the most famous of all political satires the Don Camillo saga, a political farce rather than satire, exemplified by the myth of Peppone and Don Camillo in Julien Duvivier’s The Little World of Don Camillo (Il piccolo mondo di Don Camillo, 1952), followed by his own The Return of Don Camillo (Il ritorno di Don Camillo, 1953), Carmine Gallone’s Don Camillo’s Last Round (Don Camillo e l’onorevole Peppone, 1955), and Don Camillo: Monsignor (Don Camillo monsignore ma non troppo, 1961), and finally, Luigi Comencini’s Don Camillo in Moscow (Il compagno Don Camillo, 1965).\n\nA Special Case in Italian Comedy: Totò Considered by generations of moviegoers as the greatest Italian comic actor of all time, Antonio de Curtis (1898–1967), nicknamed Totò “il principe della risata,” like many comedy actors, benefited from great success and public acclaim in Italy while never experiencing international fame. Despite an undisputable physical talent for slapstick comedy due to a unique mimetic performance reminiscent of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, the Neapolitan actor was not always fortunate, as many of his films included a series of repetitive stunts and gags adapted for the large screen. In 1937, he set the tone for his future personae with a brilliant lead performance in a long feature film, Gero Zambuto’s Fermo con le mani! The defining moment of his career occurred in the 1940s when he crossed the path of review writer Michele Galdieri, in addition to iconic actress Anna Magnani (Roberto Rossellini’s Roma, città aperta in 1945 or Luigi Zampa’s L’onorevole Angelina in 1947). To his credit, Totò was convincingly able to project on the screen the stereotypical image of the southerner, poor and\n\n26\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nused to the art of getting by, reused and perfected by the commedia all’italiana in the 1960s. With a true talent for improvisation on the set, Totò possessed an inherent anarchical profile, in the end, delivering an unexpected narrative, and eventually bringing confusion to the pre-established order. Due to a growing eye disease, which after 1957 seriously hampered the development of his career, the actor was progressively compelled to abandon the theater scene. Slowly Totò accumulated identical roles, everlastingly recycling his comical genius that was often associated with Peppino de Filippo in numerous farces. It wasn’t until his small, but providential appearance in Mario Monicelli’s Big Deal on Madonna Street (I soliti ignoti, 1958) as Dante, a different role for him, which marked a turning point in his career as well as the comedy of the 1950s. Many film historians viewed this historical collaboration as the symbol of the “passaggio del testimone” from the postwar generation (Totò, Memmo Carotenuto) to the new one, the future protagonists of the commedia all’italiana (Vittorio Gassman, Marcello Mastroianni). While some of these film historians erroneously associated Totò with the commedia all’italiana, his career mainly included comedy of the postwar era, since he rarely contributed to the emergent movement/genre in the 1960s. Most filmmakers preferred the fresh talent of Vittorio Gassman, Nino Manfredi, or Ugo Tognazzi. Protagonists of the commedia all’italiana imposed characters filled with preponderant negative traits such as cattiveria (malevolence), hypocrisy, vanity, cowardness, a paradigm indeed far from Totò’s universe, best illustrated by Alberto Sordi in Dino Risi’s The Widower (Il vedovo, 1959) or Antonio Pietrangeli’s The Bachelor (Lo scapolo, 1955). His most important performances, all of which remained outside the commedia all’italiana movement, included Mario Mattoli’s Totò al giro d’Italia (1954); Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia’s Totò le Moko (1949); Luigi Comencini’s L’imperatore di Capri (1949); Mario Mattoli’s Totò sceicco (1950); Monicelli’s Totò and the King of Rome (Totò e i re di Roma, 1951); Steno and Monicelli’s Cops and Robbers (Guardie e ladri, 1951); Vittorio De Sica’s The Gold of Naples (L’oro di Napoli, 1954); Monicelli’s Totò and Carolina (Totò e Caroline, 1955); Mauro Bolognini’s You’re on Your Own (Arrangiatevi!, 1959); Alberto Lattuada’s La Mandragola (1965); Dino Risi’s Operation San Gennaro (Operazione San Gennaro, 1966); and Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Hawks and Sparrows (Uccellacci e uccellini, 1966). From variety shows to avanspettacolo, Totò’s films have been watched by an immense popular audience (mainly in Italy), which is over 270 million spectators; an unequaled performance to this day. The 1950s comedies were also characterized by the growing tendency to display behavioral contradictions (more and more mental rather than physical). The case of Luigi Zampa’s Ladro lui ladra lei (1958) illustrated the evolution of Italian humor now mature enough to utilize the dialectal duality (a humor based on immediate discrepancy between dialect versus standard Italian) mixed in the same scene in order to produce the intended comic relief. One of the most emblematic scenes of the decade comes from this film; Cencio\n\nThe Age of Neorealismo Rosa\n\n27\n\nAlberto Sordi (Cencio) in Luigi Zampa’s Ladro lui ladra lei (1958) (Alberto Sordi), an expert crook dressed as a cardinal of the Church, scheduled to meet a businessman in order to help him send money illegally to Switzerland, stands at a window from an ecclesiastical library to authenticate his credibility. However, outside his accomplice Cesira (Sylva Koscina), the woman who is to alert him of the businessman’s arrival, is being verbally harassed by two youngsters on a scooter. Cencio, who sees no other choice, asks the two ruffians to leave her alone in proper ecclesiastical Italian. They both obstinately refuse and engage in a provocative behavior toward the clergyman, who is now compelled to curse at them in Roman dialect in order to scare them away: “e bisogna che ve ne annate! Mannaggia!” (“Get the hell outta here!”) Though the stratagem works, Sordi remembers that he is still inside a crowded library filled with ecclesiastical members who at this moment all stare at him in utter disbelief. During the second half of the decade, a few postwar comedies were characterized by a common desire to take the comedy genre away from its neorealist roots. Some of them, like Nanny Loy’s Il marito (1958) or Antonio Pietrangeli’s The Bachelor (Lo scapolo, 1955), adopted plots closer to quotidian reality and began to engage in a strategy of social and gender commentary as a main priority. At one point, scenarists and filmmakers realized that a stronger comedy was needed; one that would prove to both popular audiences and producers alike that the underlining negative aspects of modern Italian society and consumerism was a way to both entertain and bring social responsiveness\n\n28\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nto the public eye (Pietro Germi’s Divorzio all’italiana and the question of the south, which will be developed in the next chapter). One emergent aspect of comedy was the implementation of an unusual dose of cynicism. Although still very remote from the commedia all’italiana of the 1960s, cynicism and irony were in a way the best advocate to evoke reforms for Italian society and impose a self-examination of its own humankind. As screenwriter Furio Scarpelli recalled: Everyone from our generation makes that kind of cinema, giving a great part to irony. Irony is part of the tragedy of life; it is necessary to narrate it…. Why have so many friends and students uselessly endured trying to make their cinematographic story convincing? Because sometimes, inside, these incitements lack these enrichments, this boiler, this engine…. What replaced this impulse is what was called in Italy a psycho-sociological progress, that is to say, to give value to what you are, to narrate one’s self. It is very difficult to discover the abyss that exists between this self-consciousness, this exhibition, and its use to achieve works that talk about others and interest them.11\n\nDifferences Between Commedia Italiana and Commedia all’Italiana Even though the commedia all’italiana may be considered by the nonspecialist a subgenre of Italian film comedy, the genre/movement actually surpassed Italian comedy in term of critical and popular success, both national and international. The key to the performance was in large part for its authors to transpose successfully the personal and common struggle of the average Italian into a product of national appeal (i.e., the vicissitudes of Communist journalist Silvio Magnozzi in Dino Risi’s A Dificult Life [Una vita difficile, 1961], forced to compromise his ideals to survive economically, thus representing in emblematic scope the story of millions of Italian in the early years of the economic miracle). The new developments brought by the commedia all’italiana were numerous. Because attempting to classify their importance would be an endless task, one should point out that the most important discrepancy between postwar comedy and the new commedia all’italiana was the level of social observation and its subsequent engagement. If the “light comedies” of the 1950s as well as the ones that emanated from the neorealismo rosa era did not carry with them a social implication toward the already conquered popular audiences, the new comedies of the 1960s were just the opposite. Comedy Italian style’s primary intentions were both to serve the purpose of entertainment as well as to incite a validation of social satire from the spectators’ point of view: not just humor for its own sake, but also a certain level of intellectual reflection on society, politics, and humanity. As film historian Lorenzo Quaglietti wrote in 1963 in the journal Cinemasessanta:\n\nThe Age of Neorealismo Rosa\n\n29\n\nRecently, Italian film comedy has gone through a complex transformation. Many low quality products with gratuitous and provincial humor seem to have disappeared from our screens to make room for more ambitious works that report with great interest their attention on the most paradoxical aspects of Italian reality.12 Comedy Italian style was born step by step through a social and political conscience (from the Italian comedy) that initiated the stamina and leadership of screenwriters such Cesare Zavattini (1902–89) and Sergio Amidei. They were able to conjugate drama and irony in a comical manner without losing the ultimate target of social commentary. However, it is important to remember the preponderant influence of Sergio Amidei, who collaborated for the neorealist adventure with cineastes such as Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica for Open City (Roma città aperta, 1945), Shoe-Shine (Sciuscià, 1946), Paisan (Paisà, 1946), Germany Year Zero (Germania anno zero, 1947), or Stromboli (Stromboli terra di Dio, 1949). In the late 1950s, while the new comedy style became reality, Amidei experienced a second wind and wrote for Big Deal on Madonna Street (I soliti ignoti, 1958), Generale Della Rovere (Il generale Della Rovere, 1959), Roaring Years (Anni ruggenti, 1962), Il medico della mutua (1968), Il prof. dott. Guido Tersilli primario della clinica Villa Celeste convenzionata con le mutue (1969), Why (Detenuto in attesa di giudizio, 1971), and An Average Little Man (Un borghese piccolo piccolo, 1977). Indeed, with the new comedy style, laughter was no longer the only objective for screenwriters, producers, and directors as they began shifting their focus toward cultural stimulus, even triggering a social consciousness to the popular audiences. Furio Scarpelli explained that comic films of the 1950s were in large part made to satisfy producers and a public with a dire need to be entertained and forget the hardship of the immediate postwar era and the painful effort of reconstruction.13 But what characterized comedy Italian style in the 1960s was its resemblance to political films (similar to Francesco Rosi’s Hands Over the City [Mani basse sulla città, 1963] or Elio Petrri’s Investigation of a Private Citizen [Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto, 1970]) in terms of documentation and the journalistic approach to the subject in their investigation of reality. Consequently, filmmakers and screenwriters felt the need to be more assertive and give a substantial political and social message within the content. From this, the commedia all’italiana was born, and laughter was able from now on to take a different shape and content. However, the new style was criticized on occasion for its forceful approach to contemporary problems without suggesting a salutary exit to viewers. The absence of didactic conclusions, a trademark of the new comedies, was also a reminder of the profound dislike for morality from authors. Only years later, did spectators fully appreciate the authenticity of the screenplay as well as the importance of their performance. For the first time, Italian comedy, unlike the bourgeois comedies of the preceding decade,\n\n30\n\nCOMEDY ITALIAN STYLE\n\nimproved the depth of the narrative discourse by exposing the confrontation between amoral protagonists and a quotidian reality abandoned by civil values. The second predominant distinction between the two cinematographic époques was without a doubt the presence of cynicism. The advent of the new comedies at the end of the 1950s, following Big Deal on Madonna Street (Soliti ignoti), implemented a new dimension in the narrative, which ultimately established cynicism and cruelty as a legitimate cinematic ingredient. The old vision of reality of postwar Italy’s reconstruction effort had been seen through the infantilized glare of generations of conventional filmmakers, whereas the vision of the economic boom was all of a sudden scrutinized through the adult lens of cynicism and composure. Dino Risi, who like many filmmakers successfully made the transition between both cinemas, explained his position in defense of cynicism. In my opinion, cynicism is not a defect, it is not a negative attitude; it is a way of saying things as you try to get to the truth, without prejudice and without compromise. Cynicism is a very beautiful way of looking at reality, without pretending, without hiding anything.14 One of the predominant characteristics of the rapport between popular audiences and actors was the process of identification that for several decades never experienced much change; the comic hero often communicated a positive message to the audience (with a visible absence of sarcasm). One of adaptation and insertion into a society, as cruel as it may have been, was the unavoidable background of the narrative. On the other hand, the new comedy of the 1960s allowed the public to identify with a more human comic protagonist, filled with defects and even an unprecedented dimension of malice, even cruelty. Hence the explosion of Alberto Sordi’s character type and the unconditional fidelity the Italian popular audiences granted him until the end of the seventies. Monicelli’s views on sentimentalism were also explicit as he considered it “an element that I or the commedia all’italiana hate.”15 In this respect, one can go as far as to say that the comedies of the 1950s proposed a comic protagonist oftentimes as victim (i.e., Marcello Mastroianni, the victim of Sophia Loren’s deceitful tricks in Alessandro Blasetti’s Too Bad She’s Bad [Peccato che sia una canaglia] in 1954) whereas a decade later the new comedy Italian style of the 1960s preferred to emphasize the cruel and sarcastic nature of the comic hero. While the comic protagonist of the economic miracle eventually experienced hardship and despair, he/she was also able to express a new dimension, unknown a few years before. Mario Monicelli underlined the potential brutality of the new comedy. We thought about filters, customs, chronicles, current affairs to unmask weaknesses and subterfuges, flaws and pettiness of everyday people, turning upside down common truths and destroying myths, with malice\n\nThe Age of Neorealismo Rosa\n\n31\n\nand no mercy, since the commedia is mean, even ruthless. With this objective, verisimilitude takes on a decisive role. It is a demand but also a weapon for our battlefield.16 In other words, the malice and psychological ruse no longer corr"
