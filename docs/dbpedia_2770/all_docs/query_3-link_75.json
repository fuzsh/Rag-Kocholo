        "text": "Retailers began taking big bites of prime real estate in The Big Apple in 2024.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, retail space availability on Madison Avenue was at 16%. Today it is below 6%. On lower Fifth Avenue in last yearâs first quarter, 24% of retail space was open for leasing. By the end of Q1 2024, availability there had dropped by almost 10 points to 14.5%.\n\nThatâs according to JLLâs first quarter New York Retail report, which points out that much of that space has been swallowed up by luxury retailers including Gucci, Rolex, and Louis Vuiton. The average prime availability rate for the first quarter was 15.4%, well below the rate of 21% in 2019 and peak availability of 28% in 2021.\n\nAverage prime submarkets saw a year-over-year decrease in availability rates of 2.3% and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 0.5%. Availability rates for the first quarter differed by submarket. Madison Avenueâs decline was a record low, and lower Fifth Avenueâs was close to 2019âs record low of 12.9%.\n\nNot all luxury landings in Manhattan fared as well, however. The Meatpacking Districtâs rate rose to 30.6% availability rate in the first quarter, up considerably from the 24.1% it posted in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAverage asking rent per square foot has increased with decreased availability, but is still far from pre-COVID highs. In the first quarter of 2024, unweighted average asking rent was $537 per sq. ft., compared to $495 in the first quarter of 2022. Average prime asking rents decreased slightly from $544 in the first quarter of 2023 and $545 in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nMost submarkets saw a slight year-over-year decrease in average asking rents. Herald Square saw a more dramatic decrease than others from $532 in the first quarter of 2023 to $485 in the most recent quarter. Two submarkets, Upper Fifth Ave. (+4.9%) and Times Square (+23.8%), saw a year-over-year increase in average asking rents.\n\nJLL provided a list of significant retail signings in the first quarter of the year, broken down by neighborhood, borough, and square footage:\n\nWegmans (Upper West Side, 58,874 sq. ft.)\n\nBedford Stuyvesant Beginnings Charter (Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 51,498 sq. ft.)\n\nLâOreal (Hudson Yards, 45,863 sq. ft.)\n\nFood Hall (Midtown, 34,822 sq. ft.)\n\nMuseum of Mathematics (NoMad, 25,158 sq. ft.)\n\nDel Friscoâs Double Eagle Steakhouse (Rock Center, 25,246 sq. ft.)\n\nGU (SoHo, 25,000) sq. ft.)\n\nFitness Factory (Harlem, 22,407 sq. ft.)\n\nUrban Outfitters (SoHo, 20,816 sq. ft.)\n\nAvra Steak (34th St., 20,000 sq. ft.)\n\nAdvantageCare Physicians - EmblemHealth (Flatiron, 18,390 sq. ft.)\n\nBioLife Plasma Services (Harlem, 16,698 sq. ft.)\n\nRooftop Hospitality Group (Near Penn Station, 15,000 sq. ft.)\n\nArcâteryx (Lower Fifth Ave., 12,689) sq. ft.)\n\nGUI Korean Steakhouse (Midtown West, 10,202 sq. ft.)\n\nJLLâs more than 550 global research professionals track and analyze economic and property trends and forecast future conditions in over 60 countries."
