        "text": "5th Avenue (or Quinta Avenida in Spanish) is the backbone of downtown Playa del Carmen.\n\nIt functions as the staple of this quaint small coastal city!\n\nYou may be wondering “What is 5th Avenue”?\n\nI hadn’t heard of it either until I got here…\n\nMost people associate 5th Avenue with New York but little did you know that Playa, in fact, has it’s own 5th Avenue, or as it’s locally known Quinta Avenida.\n\n5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen is a 5-mile long pedestrian-only walkway dedicated to catering to all of your touristic needs, and it’s an absolute MUST during your next visit here.\n\nWith a great eye, you can find a lot of great stuff on Quinta Avenida but here are a few places to start.\n\nThe best things to see and do on 5th Avenue include:\n\nSephora (makeup)\n\nFrida Kahlo Museum (cultural)\n\nVictoria Secret (shopping)\n\nAquarium Beach (entertainment)\n\nThe Thompson Rooftop Pool (relaxing)\n\nThe Carmen – Deck 5 Rooftop Pool (relaxing)\n\nParque Fundadores (entertainment / relaxing)\n\n12th Street – for Partying! (nightlife)\n\nQuinta Alegria – Shopping Mall (shopping)\n\nChez Celine (bakery)\n\nGaston Charo Art Gallery (cultural)\n\nBack to top\n\nBest Things to See and Do Along 5th Avenue\n\nOne thing is for sure…there is always something going on 5th Avenue!\n\nWhether it’s interesting performances, cultural events, or new shops popping up this place is forever changing and evolving. It’s colorful, vibrant, and bustling!\n\nOf course, some information is subject to change as things move fast here in Playa but I’ve tried to provide you with the highlights that have already stood the test of time.\n\nBut wander freely and keep your eyes peeled for new and cool updates and be sure to let us know in the comments section what you found.\n\nWe would love to hear from you. 🙂 Enjoy!\n\n1. Sephora\n\nMakeup lovers, rejoice!\n\nThere is nothing worse than forgetting an essential for your vacay, whether you need your highlighter for the glow upon an evening or if it smashed on the plane Sephora is here to cater to all of your beauty needs at amazing prices.\n\nIf you are from England you will probably be way more excited about this than the average American as us Brit’s don’t actually have the privilege of having Sephora in the UK yet (yeah, it sucks).\n\nMeaning it’s super hard to get our hands on American brands such as Tarte or ABH without paying extortionate shipping fees.\n\nSo, budget well and my advice would be to stock up on your Anastasia Beverly Hills Dip Brow Pomade while you are here!\n\nLOCATION\n\nBack to top\n\n2. Frida Kahlo Museum\n\nFrida Kahlo was a Mexican artist who is undoubtedly one of the most influential artists in Mexico.\n\nHer artistic legacy and life story have made her a symbol of courage in the face of adversity.\n\nShe painted many iconic portraits and self-portraits inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico’s diverse cultural history.\n\nHer work explores questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.\n\nThe Riviera Maya Frida Kahlo museum is situated in Playa del Carmen along 5th avenue and is an absolute must for any art or history mavens.\n\nHer footprints have marked Mexican society in more ways than one.\n\nHow much is the Frida Kahlo museum in Playa del Carmen?\n\nFor the general public entrance is $15 USD. However, there is a 10% discount for Mexican nationals.\n\nEach space has its own specialized guide on the subject of each room.\n\nYou can buy your tickets from the contact center or at the box office when you arrive.\n\nIt’s open Monday – Sunday from 9.00 am to 11.00 pm\n\nDiscounts include:\n\nValid at the ticket office with valid credentials (INE or Passport)\n\n10% Mexicans\n\n50% Premises and children from 5 to 11 years old\n\n30% Students, teachers, seniors and people with disabilities\n\nUnder 5 years free entry\n\n*Discounts do not add up to other offers\n\nLOCATION\n\nBack to top\n\n3. Victoria Secret\n\nIf you can’t treat yourself to something fancy while on vacation, when can you?\n\nVictoria Secret claims to sell the best bras in the world and the sexiest lingerie.\n\nHowever, they have expanded their line to include sportswear, swimwear, pajamas, accessories, fragrances and more.\n\nIt’s a smaller store than normal, however, it’s the first one here in Playa del Carmen so safe to say the ladies here are pretty happy regardless.\n\nDefinitely worth having a browse. A girl can never have too many bikinis, especially when vacaying in the Caribbean.\n\nLOCATION\n\nBack to top\n\n4. Aquarium Beach\n\nTechnically, this place isn’t actually on 5th Avenue however, it is just a few steps away and makes the perfect rainy day activity, especially if you have kids.\n\nI actually really enjoyed my time here, I wasn’t expecting much but I loved it!\n\nThe place is planned out well, and as you journey through the different rooms there is a guide on hand to explain what’s happening in the themed exhibits.\n\nL’Aqaurium is home to over 200+species of marine animals.\n\nThis project was created by Blau Life in conjunction with experts to provide an education center for learning about our marine life. This project is supported by the Ministry of Education in Mexico.\n\nHow much is the entrance to Aquarium Beach?\n\nFor foreigners = $ 15 USD\n\nNationals = $ 179 pesos (presenting official photo ID)\n\n$ 149 pesos Quintana Roo residents (presenting an official ID with photo)\n\n$ 140 pesos older adults presenting credentials INAPAM.\n\nTo get to the entrance you will have to go up some escalators to get to the second level of Plaza Corazon on the front side-facing 5th Avenue.\n\nNote: This aquarium is wheelchair accessible. There are elevators to all levels.\n\nThe aquarium will be open daily from 11:00am-9: 00 pm.\n\nLOCATION\n\nBack to top\n\n5. The Thompson Rooftop Pool\n\nPrepare yourself for one of the most stunning rooftop pools in Playa del Carmen. This is 100% one of my favorite hangout spots.\n\nIf you want a break from getting sand in your hair get your fair share of sun, rest, and relaxation from the comfort of a rooftop pool, with great drinks and even better views.\n\nThe Thompson is one of Playa del Carmen’s hippest, most luxurious hotels right on 5th Avenue.\n\nThe highlights of this location are the two rooftop restaurants and infinity pool.\n\nThe rooftop pool offers exhilarating 360° panoramic views of Playa del Carmen and 5th Avenue.\n\nThe best part of all is that you can visit this pool during the day even if you aren’t staying at the hotel.

Parque Fundadores\n\nThis may be the first place you see in Playa del Carmen if you come by bus from the airport. Parque Fundadores is the park in Playa del Carmen just outside of the bus station on 5th Avenue.\n\nThe name means “Founding Fathers Park” and it is one of the original areas in Playa del Carmen at the tip of Avenue Juarez.\n\nThis public space is forever reinventing itself.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic scene on this park is the Portal Maya Statue in Playa del Carmen. This huge bronze structure was place here in late 2011.\n\nIt is entitled “Portal Maya 2012”. It celebrates the Mayan calendar and the date of December 21st. 2012. The sculpture was designed by artist Arturo Taravez who is from Guanajuato, Mexico. The sculpture is 16 meters high or about 52 feet high.\n\nDefinitely picture worthy!\n\nYou will also see the white stucco church used for many church and wedding services.\n\nJust taking the time to come and see here or bringing the kids to play in the park gives you a chance to appreciate what an interesting place Playa del Carmen really is.\n\nA recent new addition to the park is the flying Papantla performers.\n\nThese epic performers literally fly around a 30 meter (98ft.) pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum. According to one myth, the ritual was created to ask the gods to end a severe drought.\n\nLOCATION\n\nBack to top\n\n8. 12th Street – Partying!\n\nSo, again this place isn’t technically on 5th Avenue but it’s tangent to it and it’s the place to go for nightlife!\n\nFor a full breakdown of all the hotspots on 12th street read my ultimate guide to nightlife in Playa del Carmen here.\n\nYou’ll find infamous clubs such as Palazzo and Coco Bongo.\n\nWhat I love about Playa del Carmen opposed to my home town of Manchester is that all the best places for nightlife are on the same street meaning you can walk from one place to the next without getting taxis.\n\nThis street can get very lively in an evening so just drink responsibly and look out for one another.\n\nLOCATION\n\nBack to top\n\n9.
