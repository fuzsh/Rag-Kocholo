        "text": "I started my walk on the streets of the Lower Flatiron District in between my volunteer time at Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen. I had been working in the pantry for both the morning and afternoon shifts and we finished the morning shift an hour early. I decided to walk down to the neighborhood on break and then walk as many blocks as I could that afternoon. I was able to walk from West 19th to West 17th and then walk back to Holy Apostles in time for lunch and then the next shift.\n\nEach block offered its own surprises. A lot of new restaurants have opened in the area, and I have to say the prices were quite high on most of them. I am sure that the rents are getting higher in this very trendy area. There has also been a transition from commercial to residential in these gorgeous Beaux-Arts and Geo-Classical buildings.\n\nThese were buildings that were built to last as the headquarters for businesses that have long since passed. Even some before the Great Depression. Their legacy remains as you admire the details and embellishments of the buildings that line the streets here. Urban Renewal in the 1960’s was the fate of this neighborhood that has thankfully been rediscovered by a population that finally realizes that they ‘don’t build them like this anymore.’\n\nWalking down West 19th Street, like most of the neighborhood was a mixture of architectural types with marble features and embellishments. The Siegel-Cooper Department store dominated most of the block from West 19th to West 18th and the beautiful details on the building were most impressive on the sides of the building as is the front of the building on Sixth Avenue.\n\nThe Seigel-Cooper Department store facing Sixth Avenue.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegel-Cooper_Company\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2010/08/big-store-1896-siegel-cooper-department.html#google_vignette\n\nThe details of the building were just as impressive when you turned the corner on the next two blocks and were able to admire the rest of the building. This can be seen on both sides of the store on West 19th and West 18th Streets.\n\nThe old Siegel-Cooper Department store while walking down West 19th Street.\n\nThe Siegel-Cooper Department store was a Chicago based store that was founded in 1877 by Henry Siegel, Frank H. Cooper and Isaac Keim. They opened the New York City store in 1896 on the Ladies Mile Shopping District. The store was designed by the architectural firm of DeLemons & Cordes in the Beaux-Arts design. When it opened, it was the largest department store in the world until Macy’s opened in 1902 (Wiki).\n\nThe Siegal Cooper insignia on the top and sides of the building.\n\nThe window details in the front of the store.\n\nThe windows on the front and sides of the buildings are so elegant.\n\nHenry Siegel over-extended himself and sold the company in 1902 to an investor and the store declared bankruptcy in 1915 and closed in 1917. After the store closed, it was used as a military hospital and then as a warehouse. Today after years of being used as a warehouse, it now has several retailers located in the store space (Wiki).\n\nAnother building that stood out on West 19th Street was 11 West 19th Street. It was built in 1904 as an office building in the Beaux Arts design. It has since been converted to apartments.\n\n11 West 19th Street\n\nhttps://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/12369/11-W-19-St-New-York-NY-10011/\n\nhttps://www.apartments.com/11-w-19th-st-new-york-ny/889qny2/\n\nThe beautiful details to 11 West 19th Street\n\nAs I turned around Sixth Avenue and walked past the former Price Building, I saw the extensions of the building that lined West 18th Street.\n\nThe former D. Price & Company Ladies clothing store at 604-612 Sixth Avenue.\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-price-buildling-604-612-sixth-avenue.html\n\nD. Price and Company was once a fancy women’s store at the turn of the last century which ceased business in the 1920’s upon Mr. Price’s death and the store moved out as the shopping district changed by the 1930’s (DaytonianinManhattan.com).\n\nThe lion design was very prominent on many of these buildings.\n\nThe signage was very prominent on the buildings and I even saw where McCrorey’s had their business.\n\nThe Price Building extension\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-price-buildling-604-612-sixth-avenue.html\n\nThe McCrorey Building on West 18th Street\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCrory_Stores\n\nMcCrorey’s was a discount store that had leased part of the Price Building to gain entry to the neighborhood. It closed in the early 1930’s as the neighborhood changed (Wiki).\n\nThe I passed 3 West 18th Street which was another charming building.\n\n3 West 18th Street\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/3-west-18-street-new_york\n\nhttps://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/12347/3-W-18-St-New-York-NY-10011/\n\n3 West 18th Street was built as a commercial building back in 1900 and is still in use for that purpose. The outside of the building has a Neo-Classical look about it.\n\nThe details of 3 West 18th Street\n\nWhen I was walking down West 17th Street to Fifth Avenue, I looked up and saw a series of what I thought was dogs staring down on me from above and I saw the characters from 26 West 17th Street. This is the one building on the block that really stood out.\n\n26 West 17th Street\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/26-west-17-street-new_york\n\nhttps://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/12308/26-W-17-St-New-York-NY-10011/\n\nThis interesting building was built in 1907 and is still being used for commercial purposes. When you look closer they were not dogs but lions staring back at you.\n\nThe details on the outside of 26 West 17th Street\n\nThe intricate detail work of the embellishments of 26 West 17th Street. The lions have a very inquisitive look about them.\n\nI then passed the exquisitely designed 33-35 West 17th Street. This office building was constructed in 1907 and is still being used for commercial use today.\n\n33-35 West 17th Street\n\n33-35 West 17th Street\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/33-W-17th-St-New-York-NY/16574913/\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/property/9256921-33-west-17-street-7a\n\nI had to race back to the Soup Kitchen for my second shift in the Pantry so I had to wait until two days later when I was in the City to visit the MoMA for an exhibition to finish the neighborhood. Before I headed down to the Flatiron district, I revisited the Upper West Side and covered neighborhoods that I had not been to in four years. Many buildings had been under scaffolding and others I had just missed when walking through the first time.\n\nThen it was back down to West 16th Street and was floored by the detailed by the campus of The Church of Francis Xavier at 36 West 16th Street. The Church is one of the most beautiful I have seen in the City.\n\nThe Church of Francis Xavier at 36 West 16th Street\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.Francis_Xavier_Church(Manhattan)\n\nReview on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d13394639-Reviews-Church_of_St_Francis_Xavier-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nThe details on the church are beautiful.\n\nThe church was designed by architect Patrick Charles Keely in the Roman Basilica style and the exterior of the church designed in the Neo-baroque style. The church has been in continual use since 1882 and was dedicated by the Archbishop Michael Corrigan that December (Wiki). The high school complex is attached and just down the road from the original church.\n\nThe Church of Frances Xavier High School at 30 West 16th Street\n\nhttps://www.xavierhs.org/\n\nThe history of the high school dates back to the early 1800’s. What was to become Fordham University opened in 1841 and was placed under the direction of the Jesuits in 1846. It was a member of that community, Fr. John Larkin, S.J., who in 1847 traveled to Lower Manhattan to found Xavier. The Regents of the University of the State of New York chartered Xavier in 1861 Francis Xavier HS website).\n\nIn 1886, the military department was established under the direction of the National Guard, beginning a lasting military heritage that continues to thrive today. 1897 saw the class systems reorganized to complete the break between college and high school departments. In 1912, the college was closed, and full emphasis was placed on secondary education. The enrollment was 338 at that time. With the National Defense Act of 1916, the Congress of the United States created a Reserve Officer’s Training Corps (ROTC) program and authorized the establishment of Junior ROTC units at secondary schools that would offer a course of military training for a minimum of three academic years. In 1935 Xavier’s military program became a JROTC unit (Francis Xavier HS website).\n\nIn 1968, Xavier was raised to the status of a military institute, offering four years of military science and training. Graduates were then eligible for two years credit towards Senior ROTC advancement and one honor cadet could be nominated for each of the major service academies. The JROTC program became optional for students in 1971 (Francis Xavier HS website).\n\nWhen I was walking on the other side of the street from the high school, I noticed this unique urban garden that this homeowner created and I was struck about the choice of plants and the colors and the vibrance of the plantings. It really pepped up the block.\n\nThe urban garden in front of 33 West 16th Street was unique and colorful.\n\nWhen I walked down West 15th Street, it was later in the afternoon and I could see shadows forming in the corners of the buildings. The back of the Francis Xavier Church and School was the Xavier Mission, which was busy with people lining up to receive food packages. The blocks below West 17th Street until you get to West 14th Street are more residential. The church complex pretty much takes up most of the blocks along West 15th and 16th Streets.\n\nThe back part of the school and church complex and the residential area of West 15th Street\n\nWeird street art along West 15th Street\n\nI was not sure whether this street artist was commenting on greed, making fun of those who have money or mocking the wealthy but I thought this was interesting.\n\nThere was one standout along West 15th and it was the toy store, Kidding Around, which has been a neighborhood staple since 1993. The store was founded in 1989 on Bleeker Street and has been part of the neighborhood for over thirty years. The store’s philosophy has been “We are a local family-owned toy store founded on the idea that good toys inspire creativity and educate while encouraging family interaction and fun!” (Kidding Around website).\n\nKidding Around at 60 West 15th Street\n\nThe display window for Kidding Around\n\nThe toys in the window of Kidding Around\n\nhttps://kiddingaroundtoys.com/pages/about-us\n\nThis interesting little toy store is stocked from floor to ceiling with interactive and educational toys in a whimsical environment. The displays and the signage just add to the fun. Both kids and adults alike when I was walking around were having a good time.\n\nThe Dolls and Board Games section of the store.\n\nThe Science and Book section of the store.\n\nI finished my walk of the Lower Flatiron District just as it was getting dark. The sun was still peeking out but the early evening was upon me. This is a neighborhood in transition with a lot of renovation and building going on and there will be more changes in the future as these projects finish. It may not be the ‘fashionable’ shopping district of the early 1800’s but it is holding its own.\n\nThese beautiful old buildings are finding life again as condos and apartments bringing a new energy to a neighborhood that is growing to be a ‘university’ community with the New School, NYU and CUNY moving into the area. There is a certain vibe and energy happening here.\n\nRead my blog on Walking the Borders and Avenues of the Lower Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/47757\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWith Graduation behind me and in between Summer classes, I am finally exploring the streets below 23rd Street. I never thought I would get here. It had been two long semesters and the Christmas from hell. I don’t think my feet ever hit the floor. I just kept going.\n\nI finally got back to the Flatiron District. This is where the lines get a blurry with the neighborhoods. The Flatiron District overlaps with Union Square which overlaps with Gramercy Park. NoMAD mixes with the Flatiron District and Rose Hill and then Kips Bay and Gramercy Park again. It gets very confusing so I just repeat the roads in other neighborhoods. Since the official southern border of the Flatiron District is West 20th Street, I looked to the neighborhood to walk.\n\nThe Lower Flatiron District by McCreery’s Department store on 15th Street.\n\nI decided to defy what the relators say and I cut the neighborhoods by Avenues. I decided that Lower Flatiron District would be from West 20th to West 14th Streets between Sixth and Fifth Avenues. Union Square would be from West 20th to West 14th Streets between Fifth and Irving Place. From there I would finish Gramercy Park past Irving Place and then Lower Chelsea from West 23rd to West 14th Street from Sixth Avenue to Twelve Avenue. Have I confused you yet? It is for me and I am not sure if the residents of these communities know what neighborhood association to join.\n\nI started my walk along the northern section of the neighborhood which I had walked before the semester had started at NYU. I started on West 20th Street and it was like visiting an old friend. It was then I realized that I had not walked this neighborhood in two years and that a lot had changed in that time. I had finished walking it in 2022 before Grad school had even started.\n\nWalking through Chelsea to West 20th Street. I love how the purple in this restaurant stands out every summer. I walked through the outside seating to Shukette, a restaurant at 230 Ninth Avenue.\n\nReview on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d23736354-Reviews-Shukette-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nAt the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 20th Street, another building got my attention at 650 Sixth Avenue.

They were finding new use like the buildings in Midtown South and in NoMAD and become very desirable.\n\nThere was true beauty in the details of 20 West 20th Street that was built in 1906.

The Presbyterian Building was built in 1893 and was designed by architect James B. Baker and was designed in the French Gothic style. It was to be used by the Presbyterian Church as their base for domestic and foreign missions and used as office space. The Panic of 1893 changed that, and they had to lease the space out (Daytonian in Manhattan).\n\n156 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/156-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/14050649/\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/02/presbyterian-building-156-fifth-avenue.html\n\nI then took the long walk down Fifth Avenue and all the architectural treasures it contains.

The stunning Second Empire building is faced in marble, brick, and cast-iron, features stacked arch orders and a prominent, two-story, pavilioned mansard roof. Arnold Constable & Co. was founded by Aaron Arnold, who opened a small dry goods store in the city in 1825 (Buildings of New England).\n\nAs the business prospered he moved into larger quarters numerous times. In 1842, James Constable, an employee, married Arnold’s daughter Henrietta and was subsequently made a partner. From this, the company was renamed Arnold Constable & Co. In its heyday, Arnold Constable & Co. was the largest dealer to the elite in New York City, supplying the latest fashions to a clientele that included the leading families in the city (Buildings of New England).\n\n103 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/103-5-avenue-new_york\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/07/1896-beaux-arts-pierrepont-building-103.html\n\ninteresting history.

These were once the headquarters of companies that are now long gone but are housing the new future companies leading us into the 21st Century.\n\nLooking up Fifth Avenue from 15th Street and the core of the Lower Flatiron District.\n\nWest 14th Street is a Hodge podge of building types and in various conditions. COVID really hit 14th Street businesses hard and between the pandemic, urban renewal of the neighborhood and changing tastes of building types, there is only a few buildings left from the era when this was a major shopping street at the turn of the last century. This was before everything moved up to the 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue area.\n\nMuch of the block between Fifth and Sixth Avenue is in the process of being knocked down, renovated or both. Still there are some architectural gems still left on the street.\n\nOn the corner of Fifth Avenue and West 14th Street is 80 Fifth Avenue.\n\n80 Fifth Avenue from the corner view\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/80-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/4632221/\n\n80 Fifth Avenue is an elaborately-detailed Renaissance Revival style office building that was constructed by the architecture firm of Buchman and Fox. This building was constructed in 1908 to be used as manufacturing and office space (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nSeeing better detail work on the building from the West 14th Street view.\n\nThis beautiful building’s lower and upper levels feature decorative floral and geometric ornamentation, elaborate cornices, and angled bay windows on the third floor. Ornamented pilasters are found at either side of these windows, with slightly more austere middle floors and in its arched windows and elaborate ornamentation at the top story (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nThe beautiful detail work on 80 Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe building’s history has a long past of companies that have worked in these offices but the most prominent had been the creation of the gay organization, The National Gay Task Force. Among the Task Force’s accomplishments during the time it was located at 80 Fifth Avenue included getting the American Psychiatric Association to end its classification of homosexuality as a mental illness; getting the federal government to end its ban on employing gay or lesbian people in any federal agencies (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nWalking past buildings that are being renovating or built much of what must have been there from the turn of the last century had been torn down and that beauty in the buildings that must have been the ‘Ladies Shopping District’ in the early 1900’s. The only other building on West 14th Street that had the same characteristics and beauty is 56 West 14th Street by the corner of West 14th and Sixth Avenue.\n\n56 West 14th Street-The former R. H. Macy Annex\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2023/06/the-r-h-macy-co-annex-56-west-14th.html\n\nThis Neo-Classically designed building was the annex to the original Macy’s store that stood at the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 14th Street. R.H. Macy Dry Goods originally opened in a small building (since demolished) on this corner in 1858, and as its success grew it expanded into a number of neighboring buildings. No. 56 was built in 1898 by then-owners Isador & Nathan Straus. It was designed by architects William Schickel and Isaac E. Ditmars (Moskowitz, Sam Off the Grid).\n\nThe elaborate embellishments of 56 West 14th Street\n\nThe interesting details of the building.\n\nFour years later, in 1902, the department store moved uptown to it’s present location on Herald Square, which is the current headquarters of the store.\n\nWalking up Sixth Avenue towards West 20th Street, there is again the same issue. Most of the more elaborate buildings are closer to the edge of West 20th Street. Walking back up toward the heart of the former “Ladies Garment Mile” along Sixth Avenue from West 18th Street to West 23rd Street, the lower part of Sixth Avenue is similar in look to West 14th Street. A mish-mosh architectural styles from years of knocking down the older buildings. Inside are a variety of fast food restaurants, coffee shops and small stores.\n\nThe first building left of the former shopping district is the former Pace Building at 610 Sixth Avenue.\n\n610 Sixth Avenue-The former Price building\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-price-buildling-604-612-sixth-avenue.html\n\nDavid Price opened his first women’s clothing store, D.

Today after years of being used as a warehouse, it now has several retailers located in the store space (Wiki).\n\nAcross the street from the Siegel-Cooper store is the old B. Altman & Company store before they moved to East 34th Street.\n\n625 Fifth Avenue-The old B. Altman & Company Department Store.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Altman_and_Company\n\nB. Altman & Company was founded in 1865 as a family store that eventually came under the control of Benjamin Altman. It moved from its Third Avenue and Tenth Street location to 621 Sixth Avenue in 1877. The store expanded four times in this location to cover what is now 625 Sixth Avenue. The store was designed in the Neo-Grec design and built in four stages. First by architects David and John Jardine for the original store in 1877 and then the extension in 1880. Then by architect William Hume in 1887 and then by architects Buchman & Fox in 1910. The store moved to the corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street in 1906 when the shopping district moved to 34th Street (Wiki).\n\nThe last old department store on the Ladies Mile Shopping District is at 641 Sixth Avenue on the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 20th Street.\n\n641 Sixth Avenue-The old Simpson Crawford Department Store\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/12/exclusive-1902-simpson-crawford-dept.html#google_vignette\n\nSimpson Crawford like many stores on Sixth Avenue had its humble beginnings on 19th Street. The store continued to grow and expand catering to the ‘carriage trade’ and selling the finest merchandise. After their new store was destroyed in a fire in 1880, they opened the store at 641 Sixth Avenue in 1899 which was designed by architectural firm William H. Hume & Son in the Beaux-Arts design (dayoninmanhattan.com).\n\nThe details of 641 Sixth Avenue.\n\nThis part of the Flatiron District feels so different from the northern part of the neighborhood. So much of it has disappeared over the years that the character has changed. It does not have the distinction of the blocks between 23rd and 20th streets. There are blocks of these types of buildings whereas the blocks of the old shopping districts of the early to late 1800’s from 14th to 18th Streets have slowly disappeared over time. Older buildings have since been replaced with modern office and apartment buildings. The buildings have even been refitted for apartments and for the growing college campuses in the area.\n\nWhile there are many architectural gems in this neighborhood, it just goes to show the progression of Manhattan and how things have changed in the last 100 years. The City keeps marching on. Still this section of the Lower Flatiron District shows just how important this part of the old “Midtown Manhattan” was from the Civil War until WWI. Just look up and admire all the details on each building. There are a surprise and delight for the eyes.\n\nThe Street art on West 15th Street off Sixth Avenue “I Love New York”\n\nRead my blog on Walking the Streets of the Lower Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/47757\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Flatiron District has to be one of the most interesting and beautiful architectural neighborhoods in New York City. Serving as the old “Midtown” from the end of the Civil War until WWI and the move uptown, this area was once the shopping, entertainment and commerce area of Manhattan.\n\nWhen all the department stores and businesses moved uptown first to 34th Street and then eventually to their current locations on upper Fifth and Madison Avenues as the City core changed, the businesses left a treasure trove of exquisitely designed former office buildings and department stores that are being refitted for new businesses that are moving into this area.\n\nThe core of the Flatiron District on FIfth Avenue below 23rd Street\n\nWhat was old has become new again as the desire for these well-built and designed buildings has become a paramount to new tech and marketing businesses. The buildings may have the appearance of the turn of the last century but there are being remodeled inside with the latest Internet technology and premium office space.\n\nI started my walk down Sixth Avenue again on West 24th Street admiring the old department store buildings of the “Ladies Shopping Mile” with their Beaux Art style architecture and curvature symbols with the initials of companies that no longer exist. Just look up at the lions’ heads and pillars that dominate this architecture, and it shows this type of embellishment was used to draw customers in and showcase their elegant wares. These are now the home of discount retailers and small business offices.\n\nOn the side streets of this district, you see how companies used to impress the outside world with their elegant buildings as a ‘calling card’ of who they were as a company. Tucked between more modern buildings, there are some true architectural gems all over the neighborhood. You really have to stop and admire the detail work of these buildings.\n\nAs I rounded the corner down West 24th Street, slightly hidden by scaffolding but still seeing its beauty was 46 West 24th Street, the Masonic Lodge.\n\n46 West 24th Street-The Masonic Lodge (Streeteasy.com)\n\nhttps://www.newyorkitecture.com/tag/46-w-24th-street/\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/24-west-46-street-new_york\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2018/05/masonic-temple-and-masonic-hall.html\n\nThe Masonic Lodge’s elegant structure was designed by architect Henry Percy Knowles in the Beaux Arts style and was completed in 1910. It was built for the offices of the Masonic Lodge on West 23rd Street and its embellishments were made of stone and brick work (Daytonian in Manhattan). It’s currently going through a renovation but you can see all its beautiful decorations on the side and top of the building.\n\nMaking my way down West 24th Street, you come to the center of the neighborhood, Madison Square Park, which the Flatiron District shares with Rose Hill, NoMAD and Kips Bay to the east and Gramercy Park to the south. These neighborhoods overlap between Fifth and Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue South, so take time to read my blogs below on those neighborhoods as well to share in all the wonderful things you will see in this section of the Manhattan.\n\nMadison Square Park has become like a second home to me since walking this set of neighborhoods. It is a nice place to relax under shade trees in the hot weather and have snacks and eat your lunch while spending time people watching. It is also the home of many statutes of fascinating people and getting to know their history as well.\n\nMadison Square Park is an interesting little oasis from all the traffic and office space. It has an interesting history since it was designated a public space in 1686 by British Royal Governor Thomas Dongan. It has served as a potter’s field, an arsenal and a home for delinquents. In 1847, the space was leveled, landscaped and enclosed as a park. It became part of the New York Park system in 1870. There are many historical figures featured in the park (NYCParks.org).\n\nThe park today is a major meeting spot for residents and tourists alike with a dog track and the original Shake Shack restaurant.\n\nMadison Square Park in the Spring when I was walking the length of Broadway\n\nhttps://madisonsquarepark.org/\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/madison-square-park\n\nAn interesting sculpture that that welcomes you into Madison Square Park is the statue of William Henry Seward, the former Governor of New York State, US Senator and Secretary of State during the Civil War.

Arthur, who had taken oath just two blocks away in his New York townhouse where the Kalustyan’s Specialty Foods is located at 123 Lexington Avenue (See My Walk in Kips Bay below). I thought about what was going on in our government today and what they must have gone through with this transition.\n\nThe Statue of Chester A. Arthur in Madison Square Park\n\nPresident Chester A.

He studied sculpture abroad in Paris in the late 1870’s and was known for his historical sculptures of important figures of the time (Wiki).\n\nThe Admiral David Farragut statue in Madison Square Park by artist Augustus St. Gaudens\n\nAdmiral David Farragut\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Farragut\n\nAnother interesting statue that stands out in Madison Square Park is the of Civil War Navy hero, Admiral David Farragut. Admiral Farragut commanded the Union Blockade of Southern cities and helped capture New Orleans. The statute was designed by sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens. This was the artist’s first major commission when it was dedicated in 1881 (NYCParks.org).\n\nAugustus St. Gaudens\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/saga/index.htm\n\nAugustus St. Gaudens was an Irish born American artist whose specialty during the Beaux-Arts era was monuments to Civil War heroes. He had created the statue the William Tecumseh Sherman in the Central Park Mall on Fifth Avenue along with this statue of Admiral Farragut. He had studied at the National Academy of Design, apprenticed in Paris and then studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts (Wiki).\n\nThe Roscoe Conkling statue on the south side of the park\n\nSenator Roscoe Conkling\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Conkling\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/madison-square-park/monuments/319\n\nRoscoe Conkling was an American lawyer and Republican politician who represented New York in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate (Wiki).\n\nArtist John Quincy Adams Ward\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams_Ward\n\nHe trained for seven years (1849 to 1856) under the well-established sculptor, Henry Kirk Brown and then Ward went to Washington in 1857, where he made a name for himself with portrait busts of men in public life (Wiki).\n\nThe statue was created by sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward in 1893. Referred to as “the Dean of American Sculptors,” Ward contributed nine sculptures to the parks of New York, among them Horace Greeley (1890) now in City Hall Park, Alexander Holley (1888) in Washington Square Park, William Earl Dodge (1885), now in Bryant Park. Ward’s depiction of Conkling is a sensitive and vigorous portrait of him posed (NYCParks.com).\n\nI love walking around the park in the summer, when you can admire the flowers and green lawns and relax under the shade of tree on one of the benches. When I walking through the park after classes during Christmas, the park was like a ‘Winter Wonderland’ with white lights lining the park, the Christmas tree in the corner of the park and Shake Shack decorated for Christmas.\n\nMadison Square Park at Christmas time\n\nShake Shack decorated for Christmas\n\nhttps://shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park-ny#/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d24104174-Reviews-Shake_Shack_Madison_Square_Park-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nThe Madison Square Park Christmas tree\n\nEven during the day Christmas is in full swing in Madison Square Park\n\nI crossed the park and entered the other side of the park that the Flatiron neighborhood shares with NoMAD and Rose Hill neighborhoods. This section of the neighborhood is still home to many headquarters of companies and the architecture displays the company’s influence in their industries.\n\n315 Park Avenue South\n\nhttps://www.metro-manhattan.com/buildings/315-park-avenue-south-office-space-for-lease/\n\nThe detail work at 315 Park Avenue South\n\nThe building was designed by architect William C. Frohne in the Beaux Arts style and was completed in 1911. The building was known as the Remington Rand Building being the headquarters of the Remington Rand Company who used to manufacture typewriters and electric shavers (Metro Manhattan.com). Look up at the exquisite detail work of the doors, windows and roof with interesting design.\n\nAnother building that stood out as I walked down the street was 125 East 24th Street, the St. Francis of the Friends of the Poor.\n\n125 East 24th Street-St. Francis Friends of the Poor Building\n\nhttps://www.stfrancisfriends.org/\n\nThe structure was built in the late 1880’s as the home of William Frances Oakley. When he passed aways in 1888, it became the Beechwood Hotel, a residential hotel for the carriage trade. In the 1937, it became a writing school and by the early 1950’s it was turned in SRO. In 1979, the Friars of St. Francis of Assisi bought the building as housing for the homeless with psychiatric issues. It is now home to the St. Francis Friends of the Poor, where it is a community for people who need assistance with their issues and helps them live a better and more productive life (Wiki/St. Francis Friends of the Poor.com).\n\nThe street art on the wall of the building is interesting and faces Lexington Avenue. One the corner of East 24th Street & Lexington Avenue is the Friends House New York, a housing unit. Painted on the wall is a very unique painting by Italian street artist, Jacopo Ceccarelli.\n\nPainting by artist Jacopo Ceccarelli\n\nThe mural is on the corner of East 24th & Lexington Avenue-The St. Francis Residence Building\n\nhttps://stfrancisfriends.org/\n\nArtist Jacopo Ceccarelli\n\nhttp://doartfoundation.org/index.html@p=3375.html\n\nThe Milan born street artist, who goes by the name “Never 2501” hones his skills after moving to San Paolo, painting murals with an edge that got global recognition. He uses geometric forms in his work with circles and lines creating the abstract (Do Art Foundation).\n\nAs I walked Lexington Avenue, it was like visiting an old friend. I had not walked around Kips Bay, which shares the border with the Flatiron District in a long time. The Baruch College promenade had finally been finished and students in their summer classes were hanging out there.\n\nRestaurants that had shuttered when I was walking around the neighborhood had finally reopened and catering to the students and hotel guests in the area. I still did not see a lot of office workers, but the tourists have definitely come back to Manhattan. I have heard many languages on the streets.\n\nAs I walked back down East 24th Street, I noticed buildings that I had seen on walks in the neighborhood come back to life. It was nice to see people walking around the neighborhood again. As I crossed Park Avenue South, I saw the buildings that share the neighborhood with the NoMAD/Rose Hill neighborhood, and it looked like people were coming and going that afternoon.\n\nAs I walked closer to Madison Square Park, I noticed the large vault entrances to 11 Madison Avenue, the old Metropolitan Life North Building that had just been renovated. There was also the beauty of 5 Madison Avenue that now serves as the New Edition Hotel.\n\nIt was designed by architects Napoleon LeBrun & Sons inspired by St. Marks Campanile in Venice. From 1909 to 1913 this was the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower building. It was once the tallest building in the world until 1913 when the Woolworth Building was finished (Curbed.com/Wiki).\n\n5 Madison Avenue-The New Edition Hotel\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Life_Insurance_Company_Tower\n\nhttps://www.editionhotels.com/new-york/\n\nReview on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d7787303-Reviews-The_New_York_EDITION-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nI remembered these impressive buildings facing Madison Square Park on my last visit to the neighborhood as they share the same borders with NoMAD (North of Madison Square Park) and Rose Hill Farm neighborhood.\n\n11 Madison Avenue-Met Life North Building\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Life_North_Building\n\nhttps://www.sapir.com/11-madison-ave-2\n\nOwned by the Sapir Corporation now, the building was built in 1929 at the start of the Great Depression and was designed by architects Harvey Wiley Corbett and D. Everett Waid. It was built in the Art Deco style with clean lines and interesting embellishments on the interior of the building (Wiki). It is now home to many well-known companies (Wiki/Sapir Corporation).\n\nThe details in the entrance of 11 Madison Avenue\n\nI crossed the park again and made my way back down West 24th Street. I rounded the corner on West 23rd Street to see many striking gems along this street as well. On the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 23rd Street is 701 Sixth Avenue, the old Ehrich Brothers Department Store. The building was constructed in 1889 by architect William Schickel & Company with additions by Buchman & Deisler and Buchman & Fox in 1889 (Wiki).\n\nEhrich Brothers Department Store building at 701 Sixth Avenue (Wiki)\n\nhttp://wikimapia.org/8876315/Ehrich-Brothers-Co-Department-Store-Building\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/06/1889-ehrich-brothers-dry-goods-store.html\n\nAnother addition was added by Taylor & Levi in 1911 when the store was leased to J.L. Kesner. They added the terra cotta “K”s that can still be seen from the top of the storefront. The store folded in 1913 and then was used for manufacturing and offices as the shopping district moved to 34th Street and the Fifth Avenue area (Wiki).\n\nAt the corner of the neighborhood on Sixth Avenue and West 23rd Street at 100 West 23rd Street is the second Macy’s Department Store building. This was on the very edge of the Ladies Shopping Mile that once stretched along Sixth Avenue.\n\nThe building was built in 1871 and you can see all the elaborate embellishments on it with interesting stone carvings and elegant window design and some wrought iron details on different parts of the building. It was the last location of the store before it moved to its current location at 151 West 34th Street.\n\n100 West 23rd Street (Renthop.com) is an old Macy’s\n\nhttps://www.renthop.com/building/100-west-23rd-street-new-york-ny-10011\n\nAcross the street on the other corner is The Caroline building at 60 West 23rd Street. This inventive new building showcases the future of the neighborhood and was once home to the former McCreery’s Department Store.\n\nThe Caroline Building at 60 West 23rd Street\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/the-caroline-60-west-23-street-new_york\n\nhttps://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/defunct-department-stores/\n\nThe stretch of West 23rd Street from Sixth to Fifth Avenues was once lined with elegant department stores and specialty stores extending this ‘Shopping Mile’ to the retail palaces of Broadway above Union Square.\n\nThe plaque outside the Carolina Building\n\nThe “William Shakespeare” that once stood at the Booth Theater from the 1800’s\n\nOne of my favorite buildings that stands out and was the filming spot for ‘McMillian Toys’ in the movie “Big” is the former Sterns Brothers building at 36 West 23rd Street. You have to look on the opposite side of the street to appreciate the beauty of the building.\n\n36 West 23rd Street-The Sterns Brothers store\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2010/12/stern-brothers-dry-goods-west-23rd.html\n\nThe beautiful detail work above the entrance of the former Stern’s Brothers Department store\n\nThe stonework is amazing\n\nThe Stern’s Brothers Department store was built in five stage over a period of forty years. The original store which is the core of the building was built in 1878, where this magnificent entrance is located and the two wings of the building were built with the success of the store. The original store was designed by German architect Henry Fernbach in the Renaissance Revival style (Daytonian).\n\nThe store was added to two more times with the final addition coming in 1892 with an extension by architect William Schickel. When the migration of department stores moved to the new shopping district on 34th Street, Stern’s moved with it. The store today is Home Depot.\n\nOn the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street is 186 Fifth Avenue, which was built for the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1883.\n\nThe Western Union Building on the corner of West 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue is 186 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/flatiron-union-square/186-fifth-avenue/39081\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-1883-western-union-building-186.html\n\nThe building was designed by architect Henry J. Hardenberger in the Queen Anne style with its details being in brick and terra cotta (Daytonian in Manhattan). The building just finished a restoration, and you can see the details by the windows and dormers.\n\nThe Flatiron Building at 175 Fifth Avenue over the summer in all its glory\n\nAs you look down further on the square, you will see the Flatiron Building one of the most famous and most photographed buildings in New York City. The building was designed by Daniel Burnham as a Renaissance Palazzo with Beaux-Arts style. The original name for the building was the “Fuller Building” for the Company. The name “Flatiron” comes from a cast iron clothes iron from the turn of the last century. (Wiki)\n\nDuring the summer, street art created by both local and international artists are a big part of the decor on Broadway. This interesting work “Dancer” was by artist Tomokazu Matsumaya and was on display in the plaza next to the Flatiron Building.\n\nThe interesting artwork “Dancer” by artist Tomokazu Matsuyama in the 23rd Street Plaza next to the Flatiron Building during the summer months\n\nThe work by artist Tomokazu Matsuyama (gone by December 2022)\n\nArtist Tomokazu Matsuyama\n\nhttps://www.matzu.net/\n\nArtist Tomokazu Matsuyama is a Japanese Contemporary Visual artist from Japan who now lives in Brooklyn. He graduated from Sophia University in Tokyo and then attended Pratt Institute where he got his MFA in Communications Design. His influences are in global arts and is known for his sculptures (Wiki/Bio).\n\nEast 23rd Street that faces Bryant Park is a very commercial district with many interesting restaurant concepts from chain restaurants to independents that want to become chains. During the summer as it ended before school started, around the holidays I was able to eat in most of them. These places cater to the businesses that surround Madison Square Park and the families that come into the park to walk their dogs and use the playgrounds and dog parks.\n\nThe 23rd Street “Restaurant Row” south of Madison Square Park\n\nThe McDonald’s at 26 East 23rd Street is always popular and is open late nights. The food and the service is really good here.\n\nMcDonald’s at 26 East 23rd Street\n\nhttps://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/location/ny/new-york/336-e-23rd-st/2241.html\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5096294-Reviews-McDonald_s-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/541\n\nI still love the Bundles when they are offered.\n\nNext to McDonald’s at 28 East 23rd Street is Dim Sum Sam, a dim sum restaurant that now has four locations in New York City. The only problem with this restaurant is that the further they move uptown from Chinatown, the higher the prices go for Dim Sum. A Roast Pork bun, although really good, is getting to be almost $3.00 instead of the $1.50-$2.00 it is in Chinatown. I know rents are more up here but there is only so much people will pay for this. Still the food is really good and when I can’t make the trip to Chinatown, this is my go to place.\n\nDim Sum Sam at 28 East 23rd Street\n\nhttps://www.zmenu.com/dim-sum-sam-new-york-online-menu/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d23885390-Reviews-Dim_Sum_Sam-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nAnother local chain with several restaurants in New York City is Little Italy Pizza at 34 East 23rd Street. Their pizza, calzones and rolls are the best in all of their locations. They are also very reasonable for all their meals in all of their locations.\n\nLittle Italy Pizza at 34 East 23rd Street\n\nhttps://www.littleitalymenu.com/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/898\n\nThe Cheese Pizza here is excellent.\n\nNext to Little Italy Pizza is another chain store delight, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, whose fried and iced doughnuts are the best.

It carries items such as burgers, breakfast bowls and of course, pancakes. The day I was there one of the workers daughter was doing her homework while talking to her mother who was cooking the pancakes. It was a cute exchange between mother and daughter.\n\nFlip’d by IHOP at 110 East 23rd Street\n\nhttps://www.flipd.com/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d23843292-r882052998-Flip_d_By_Ihop-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nThe Hamburger and French Fries at Flip’d are really good and I enjoyed my meal on my last trip there\n\nThe afternoon that I was there in the summer, Madison Square Park was really busy with people sunning themselves and walking their dogs. The afternoon lunch crowd was sharing the benches with nannies and moms and a few homeless people edging their way onto the benches. In the Fall, it was people eating lunch and walking their dogs. By Christmas, with the mild weather, people were still walking their dogs, admiring the lights and tourists coming back to the City were filling the tables of the decorated Shake Shack.\n\nWhen I went to visit the Christmas tree again during the day in December, I came across this interesting sculpture to add to what is already in the park.\n\nThe statue ‘Havah…to breathe, air, life ” in Madison Square Park\n\nArtist Shahzia Sikander is a Pakistani-American visual artist. She specializes in drawing, painting, printmaking and animation. She is a graduate of the National College of Arts Lahore in Pakistan and a graduate of Rhode Island School of Design in a MFA in Painting and Printmaking.\n\nArtist Shahzia Sikander\n\nhttps://www.shahziasikander.com/\n\nThis fascinating sculpture will be in Madison Square Park for a limited amount of time. The storyboard above has a description of the statue. This adds a whole new dimension to the sculptures that line the park.\n\nAs you round the block again down East 23rd to West 23rd (with Fifth Avenue always being the dividing line) and you will see on the right is the beauty of 29 West 23rd Street. This turn of the last century building is now renovated and the home of Iron23, an event space.\n\n29 West 23rd Street-now the Flatiron House\n\nThis elegant entertaining space can now be used for parties and events with long halls and high ceilings showing off it elegant features. A few doors down is another interesting building with the most unique and interesting details to the ornamentation of the building at 39 West 23rd Street.\n\n39 West 23rd Street\n\nThe detail work of 39 West 23rd Street towards the far right of the building\n\nhttps://nyc.marketproof.com/article/flatiron-house-at-39-west-23rd-street-launches-sales-nears-completion-in-flatiron-district-manhattan-at-39-w-23rd-st-flatiron-house-10010-on-feb-2nd-2022\n\nIt is attached to the two buildings to the left and please check out the attached website to see the interiors. They have really created something special inside these buildings. It is a creative use of old and new in the same building as it is now an elegant condo complex.\n\nWhen you turn the corner again on Sixth Avenue, you are again faced with the lining of old department store buildings on both sides of the street and the elegant facade of the Ehrich Brothers Department Store to the the right that stretches from West 23rd to West 22nd Streets as you start the walk down West 22nd Street back to Park Avenue South.\n\nAmong the architectural gems of West 22nd Street is 7 West 22nd Street, The Spinning Wheel building. This elegant building was built in 19010-story Neoclassical/Renaissance-revival office building completed in 1901. Designed by architect James Barnes Baker as a store-and-loft building, it is three bays wide, with a 2-story rusticated limestone base, a 7-story arcaded midsection, and a 1-story attic. Over the entrances in the building’s end bays, “Spinning Wheel Building” is written in the cast-iron entablature. A limestone cornice with egg-and-dart molding caps the 2nd floor (Wiki).\n\n7 West 22nd Street\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/3-7-W-22nd-St-New-York-NY/22852967/\n\nhttps://www.squarefoot.com/building/ny/new-york/7-west-22nd-street/a984a850-d663-4f1c-bf10-9107e27f0a50\n\nhttps://www.realtyhop.com/building/7-west-22nd-street-new-york-ny-10010\n\nhttp://wikimapia.org/29288370/Spinning-Wheel-Building\n\nWalking closer to the edge of Fifth Avenue is the detailed 4 West 22nd Street.

Which once served as a bank is now a gourmet grocery store for residents on the Flatiron /Gramercy Park neighborhood.\n\n278 Park Avenue-The Bank for Savings Building\n\nhttps://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/13116/280-Park-Ave-S-New-York-NY-10010/\n\nhttps://www.mortonwilliams.com/our-locations\n\nKnown today as Gramercy Place, the property at 278 Park Avenue South was once the location of the New York Bank for Savings. The original bank building was completed in 1894 and though it was subsequently knocked down, the 1986-built Gramercy Place still showcases elements of the original building, including the marble and teak lobby (Propertyshark.com). It is now home to the Morton Williams Supermarket.\n\nAcross Park Avenue South from the former bank is 281 Park Avenue-The Fotograski Museum New York and the former Church Mission House. It was designed by architects Robert W. Gibson and Edward J. Neville and was finished in 1894. It was home to the Episcopal Church’s Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society. It was inspired with a Medieval style design (Wiki).\n\n281 Park Avenue-The Fotograski Museum on the edge of Park Avenue South and East 22nd Street\n\nhttps://www.fotografiska.com/visit\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Missions_House\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jennawang/2018/06/25/inside-the-building-that-toppled-anna-delvey/?sh=65463cab3310\n\nThe History of the Fotografiska Museum:\n\n(from the museum website)\n\nFotografiska New York is the NYC location of the renowned Stockholm-based destination for the world’s best photography. Founded in 2010, Fotografiska was built on the foundation of photography as a haven for inclusivity and free expression.\n\nThe Fotografiska Museum in Manhattan\n\nOur goal is to inspire a more conscious world through the art of photography. We showcase the greatest photographers, whether they’re emerging artists or already established internationally.\n\nThe building is a registered landmark built in 1894 and originally named “The Church Mission House”. We’ve renovated this iconic jewel to be a new experience of world-class art, cultural events, retail, and epicurean dining, in an awe-inspiring space.\n\nThe Dining area of the Fotografiska Museum\n\nThe Fotografiska Museum is the latest museum to enter the very crowded collection of museums in Manhattan. The beauty of this museum is that artist has a say of how the show is mounted which gives an interesting perspective to viewing shows here.\n\nMy “Trends in Tourism” class at NYU when we visited the museum in October 2022.\n\nI headed back down East 22st Street, I passed all this interesting architecture and thought back to the architects who designed it, the period it was created and how it was being refigured into modern times for new businesses and living spaces.\n\nAs I crossed Sixth Avenue again to East 21st from East 22nd, I admired the old department store buildings again and stopped in front of the old Adams Dry Goods building at 675 Sixth Avenue and looked up at all the beautiful embellishments.\n\nSamuel Adams, a merchant who had been selling upscale clothing and furnishing to customers in the area decided to open a store on Sixth Avenue. He used the architectural firm of DeLemos & Cordes, who had designed the Seigel-Cooper Department Store and the six-story building opened in 1902. The store was the first in New York City to use the new Pneumatic tubes to transport money and messages throughout the store (Wiki).\n\nAdam’s Dry Goods Store when it opened in 1902\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2010/10/1900-adams-co-building-675-sixth-avenue.html\n\nhttp://wikimapia.org/16882716/Adams-Dry-Goods-Store-Building\n\nThe problem with the store was its location. He built the store at the very edge of the neighborhood as the business changed. As the shopping area started to decline in the early 1900’s, Adams sold the store to Hugh O’Neill Dry Goods Store and they merged the two companies together, converting three floors of the Adams Dry Goods store to furniture. This concept was not popular as well and the businesses failed, and the store closed in 1913 (Wiki & the tour guide).\n\nAdams Dry Goods Store today at Sixth Avenue between West 21st and 22nd Streets\n\nThe store has gone through a manufacturing stage and in the 80’s became part of the change to large box retailing. The building now houses eBay and several stores including Trader Joe’s and Michael’s. As we could see on the tour, the old department stores are finding new life in retailing.\n\nThe detail work of the old Adams Dry Goods Store at 675 Sixth Avenue\n\n675 Sixth Avenue-The Adams Dry Goods Store\n\nThe store that sits to the right is the former Adams Dry Goods Store at 675 Sixth Avenue between West 21st and 22nd Street.\n\nWhen I crossed Sixth Avenue again, as I was walking down West 21st Street and faced the beauty of the former Hugh O’Neil Department Store between West 21st and 20th Streets.\n\nOur next stop was in front of Hugh O’Neill’s Dry Goods Store at 655 Sixth Avenue between West 20th and 21st Streets. It was built by the firm of Mortimer C. Merritt in the neo-Greco style who built the four stages of the building between 1887-1890 (Wiki & the tour guide).\n\nThe Hugh O’Neill Store when it opened in 1890\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_Building\n\nHugh O’Neill had started a small dry goods business right after the Civil War in 1865 with a small store around Union Square. In 1870, he decided to build a trade on the middle market customer and offered discounts on goods. The four floors of merchandise contained laces, ribbons, clocks and on the upper floors women’s and children’s clothing (Wiki).\n\nWhen O’Neill died in 1902, the shopping area had just begun its decline and in 1906 it merged with Adams Dry Goods up the block. A year later they both went out of business as the area gave way to manufacturing. The building today has been converted into condos.\n\nThe Hugh O’Neill store today\n\nAs I walked down West 21st Street, I was greeted by 30 West 21st Street. Like most of the buildings in the district, it has almost a confection look to it. It is amazing how the renovations of these buildings over the last three years have brought back their original beauty. Built in 1907, this confection has been renovated to office space in recent years.\n\n30 West 21st Street\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/30-W-21st-St-New-York-NY/16081709/\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/alma-lofts\n\nThis beautiful turn of the last century building was once Danceteria, a trendy after hours club from 1980 to 1986. It had been one of the popular after hours clubs in Manhattan and the Hamptons. In 2008, the building was sold for renovation for office space and condos (Wiki).\n\nDanceteria:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danceteria\n\nThis famous scene of “Desperately Seeking Susan” was shot at 30 West 21st Street\n\nDown the street as you are approaching Fifth Avenue, I passed the costume company Abracadabra at 19 West 21st Street. When I entered the store around Halloween, the store was extremely busy with customers walking around choosing costumes and the staff restocking the store and helping people with their selections. While I was admiring the displays, one of the staff members said he would turn them on so that I could see how they behave. I felt like I had just entered a torture chamber in a haunted house.\n\nAbracadabra at 19 West 21st Street\n\nhttps://abracadabranyc.com/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d15010693-Reviews-Abracadabra_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nMy review on LittleShoponMainStreet@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/littleshoponmainstreet.wordpress.com/1800\n\nAbracadabra front display\n\nAbracadabra front display. This man really looks like he is getting electrocuted\n\nAbracadabra has a wonderful selection of costumes, props and decorations\n\nAbracadabra is one of those stores that just stands out when you walk in. Every day is Halloween when you walk in the door and everything is there to shock and amaze you. It is a interesting blend of theater, imagination and creativity that makes the store come to life. Even the staff walk around in masks and costumes showing off the merchandise. Many I am sure are actors and artists using their own sense of style to show the costumes off.\n\nThere is no lack of interesting costumes to try on or accessories to match them. When you enter the store you are overwhelmed by the selection of items to choose from. Each section of the store dedicated to a certain type of costume. When you head downstairs, you so a lot of the makeup and masks that use to finish a outfit. You will walk around the store with a sense of wonder of walking into a funhouse. The store is an experience.\n\nThe core of the Flatiron District really is Fifth Avenue with all its elegant and detailed buildings. As you cross Fifth Avenue to East 21st Street the beauty of 160 and 141 Fifth Avenue really standout.\n\n160 Fifth Avenue was designed by architect R.H. Robertson in 1891 and was previously home to the offices of McKim, Mead and White architectural firm. Throughout the 1920’s, the building served as headquarters for E.H. Van Ingen & Company, a large importer of woolen goods. It is now as modern office space with a rooftop garden (Medas.com).\n\n160 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://www.mdeas.com/160-fifth-ave\n\nWalking past Fifth Avenue is 141 Fifth Avenue another confection of architecture. This gorgeous building was built in 1897 by architect Robert Maynicke, who had also designed Sohmer Piano Building at 170 Fifth Avenue, in the Beaux Arts style for the Merchant Bank of New York (Flatironnomade.nyc/fsiarchitecture.com).\n\n141 Fifth Avenue\n\n141 Fifth Avenue-The Merchants Bank of New York Building\n\nhttp://www.fsi-architecture.com/building-renovations/141-fifth-avenue-new-york-ny\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/141-fifth-avenue-new_york\n\nThis impressive bank has recently been converted to luxury apartments with a current one sold at over three million dollars.\n\nThe detail work of 141 Fifth Avenue\n\nWhen I passed 21 East 21st Street, I admired the elegance of this building that looked like an old mansion. It was built in 1900 as an apartment building and is now high end condos. The beauty of the details and the red color makes the building really stand out amongst the others on the block.\n\n21 East 21st Street\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/21-east-21-street-new_york\n\nhttps://www.apartments.com/21-east-21st-street-new-york-ny/5gexbgp/\n\nJust a few steps down the block is 24 East 21st Street with a smiling face guarding the door. This former commercial building was built in 1930 and has been converted into apartments called Infinity Flats. You have to look at the detail work around corniche area of the roof and around the entrance. The building is detailed and elegant.\n\n24 East 21st Street\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/flatiron-union-square/infinity-flats-24-east-21st-street/review/34921\n\n24 East 21st Street\n\nFurther down East 21st Street I walked past the detailed confection of 32 East 21st Street. The beauty of this confection is the carved stone detail work around the lower windows and doorways. The building was restored and renovated and is now the home for Harding’s, a local upscale restaurant. The building was originally a printing press office.\n\n32 East 21st Street\n\n32 East 21st Street\n\nThe entrance to 32 East 21st Street now the home of Harding’s Restaurant\n\nhttp://www.hardingsnyc.com/location\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d4586275-Reviews-Harding_s-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nAt the end of the block that borders the Flatiron District and Gramercy Park is a the historic The Parish of the Cavalry of St. George at 61 Gramercy Park North. The church stands guard between the old and new buildings of the neighborhood and sets the tone of many of the older buildings on the block that once housed religious centers.\n\nParish of the Cavalry of St. George at 61 Gramercy Park North\n\nhttps://www.calvarystgeorges.org/\n\nThe parish was founded in 1749 and the church moved to this spot in 1846. It was said that Edith Wharton used this church as the inspiration for the church in “The Age of Innocence”. It was designed by architect James Renwick Jr. in the Gothic Revival style.\n\nThis particular walk took so much time to write because I had just finished my walk about a week before graduate school started at NYU. I got so caught up in the first weeks of classes that I had to put everything aside and concentrate on school. This actually gave me more time to explore the neighborhood and see all the details in the buildings. I really discovered the beauty of the Flatiron district.\n\nThe Flatiron District at night walking through after classes\n\nAfter my many walks through the streets of the Flatiron District and visiting Madison Square Park during the last several months, I decided to take the subway back to Chinatown again to try some restaurants that I wanted to add to my blogs.\n\nI returned to some of the places I had tried in past weeks. I visited multiple times because I just wanted to try more items on the menu. The dumplings and baked goods that I had tried were wonderful and I wanted to try more items on the menu to make a comparison. Now that I had my new IPhone, I wanted to take more pictures and update blogs for readers.\n\nI have been building up my blog, DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com and wanted to see how many of them had stayed open post pandemic. Many of these little ‘hole in the wall’ restaurants are going strong as Chinatown is continuing to come back to life.\n\nMy blog “DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/\n\nI started my walk in Chinatown at China North Dumpling at 27A Essex Street across from Seward Park for some fried dumplings. For ten large boiled dumplings that were really juicy and well cooked, four spring rolls and a Coke it was $7.00. Everything was so well made, and you can watch from the counter the ladies making the fresh dumplings right in front of you. The place is real bare bones, but the food and the service are amazing. Try to eat at the counter and watch everything get prepared.\n\nChina North Dumpling at 27A Essex Street located in the Lower East Side\n\nhttp://www.china-north-dumpling.com/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7608410-Reviews-China_North_Dumpling-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoestringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2981\n\nThe Fried Dumplings here are excellent.\n\nIn needed something sweet after all the fried foods so I headed back to Yue Lai Bakery at 137 East Broadway to look for a baked pork bun. They had none left at that time of the day, but they were having a special on their baked goods three for $2.00 and I picked out a Coconut Bun, a Cream filled Bun and a Plain Bun.\n\nThey bagged it all up for me and I walked over to Sewart Park across the street and sat on the benches and ate them one by one. The Cream and Plain buns were really good and very sweet, and everything was so soft and well baked. I ended up sharing the Coconut Bun with the little birds in the park who surrounded me looking for a handout.\n\nYue Lai Bakery at 137 East Broadway\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/250454930/Yue-Lai-Bakery-New-York-NY\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d24850332-Reviews-Yue_Lai_Bakery-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2996\n\nThe buns here are delicious.\n\nAfter a nice rest in the park and enjoying the sunshine and watching families play with their kids, I found myself still hungry. So, I walked down Hester Street from the park and made my way to King Dumpling this time for some steamed Pork and Chive Dumplings. For ten dumplings and a Coke it was only $5.00. The Steamed Pork & Chive Dumplings were excellent and again were freshly made right in front of us. They are large and well-cooked and burst with juiciness when you bite into them.\n\nKing Dumpling at 74 Hester Street\n\nThe Fried Dumplings here are excellent and made in front of you\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Chinese-Restaurant/King-Dumplings-358670851431724/\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/31859492/King-Dumplings-New-York-NY\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d17726251-Reviews-King_Dumplings-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2988\n\nThe place was packed with customers and people getting takeout. It is amazing to me how many people write about both King Dumpling and China North Dumpling and I had never really noticed them before. I saw them on a Fung Brothers “Cheap Chinatown Eats” video and then wanted to try them.\n\nMy last stop on the eating tour because even after twenty dumplings, four spring rolls, three pastries and three Cokes, I was still hungry and needed that baked pork bun. I found it at Happy Star Bakery at 160 East Broadway and it was just $1.75. Not the $3.50 in Midtown as I recently found at Dim Sum Sam in the Theater District. It was soft and chewy and filled with the most amazing, chopped pork and baked into a sweet dough. I barely made it out the door and I was finished with it.\n\nHappy Star Bakery at 160 East Broadway\n\nhttps://zmenu.com/happy-star-bakery-corp-new-york-online-menu/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d24887287-Reviews-Happy_Star_Bakery-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/3043\n\nDinner that night was at ENoodle at 5 Catherine Street. I am not sure where I got my appetite from that evening but I managed to eat an entree of Roast Pork on top of rice and an order of Spring Rolls. Everything was delicious. You really have to search for this place as it is behind all this scaffolding. Again I had been watching Fung Brothers videos and they have mentioned this restaurant. It is worth the trip. The service is nice and the food reasonable and excellent.\n\nE Noodle House at 5 Catherine Street (now closed in January 2024)\n\nhttps://www.enoodle.nyc/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d15165908-Reviews-E_Noodle-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nAll that running around really made me hungry over the last few months. When you are walking around the Flatiron District, my best advice is to look up and really look at the details of the buildings in this neighborhood. They really are special. You will not see buildings built like this again.\n\nPassing Madison Square Park at night is quite a site!\n\nPlaces to Eat:\n\nChina North Dumpling\n\n27A Essex Street\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\nhttp://www.china-north-dumpling.com/\n\nOpen: Sunday-Saturday 9:00am-11:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7608410-Reviews-China_North_Dumpling-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2981\n\nYue Lai Bakery\n\n137 East Broadway\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(917) 257-2263\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/250454930/Yue-Lai-Bakery-New-York-NY\n\nOpen: Sunday-Saturday 6:00am-7:30pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d24850332-Reviews-Yue_Lai_Bakery-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2996\n\nKing Dumpling\n\n74 Hester Street\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(917) 251-1249\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Chinese-Restaurant/King-Dumplings-358670851431724/\n\nhttps://www.restaurantji.com/ny/new-york/king-dumpling-/\n\nOpen: Sunday-Thursday 9:00am-10:00pm/Friday 9:00am-9:00pm/Saturday 9:00am-10:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d17726251-Reviews-King_Dumpling-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2988\n\nHappy Star Bakery\n\n160 East Broadway\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(212) 608-8899\n\nhttps://zmenu.com/happy-star-bakery-corp-new-york-online-menu/\n\nOpen: Sunday 6:30am-7:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/3043\n\nE Noodle House\n\n5 Catherine Street\n\nNew York, NY 10038\n\n(212) 226-8919\n\nhttps://www.enoodle.nyc/\n\nOpen: Sunday-Saturday 10:00am-8:30pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d15165908-Reviews-E_Noodle-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nPlaces to Visit:\n\nMadison Square Park\n\n11 Madison Avenue\n\nNew York, NY 10010\n\n(212) 520-7600\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/madisonsquarepark/\n\nhttps://madisonsquarepark.org/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/madisonsquarepark\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d501513-Reviews-Madison_Square_Park-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nMy review on VisitingaMuseum.com:\n\nSeward Park\n\nCanal and Essex Streets\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(212) 639-9675\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/seward-park/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seward_Park_(Manhattan)\n\nOpen: Sunday-Saturday 7:00am-10:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nAbracadabra NYC\n\n19 West 21st Street\n\nNew York, NY 10010\n\n(212) 627-5194\n\nhttps://abracadabranyc.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AbracadabraNYC\n\nOpen: Sunday 1:00pm-7:00pm/Monday-Saturday 11:00am-7:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d15010693-Reviews-Abracadabra_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nRead my other blogs on walking the Flatiron District:\n\nDay Two Hundred and Forty-Four: Walking the Avenues of the Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/25776\n\nDay Two Hundred and Forty-Two: Walking the Borders of the Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/24726\n\nDay Two Hundred and Forty-Seven: Walking the Streets of the Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/25874\n\nReading Blogs on NoMAD, Rose Hill, and Kips Bay:\n\nPlease read my other blog on walking the Avenues and Streets of NoMAD/Rose Hill:\n\nDay One Hundred & Ninety: Walking the Streets and Avenues of NoMAD/Rose Hill:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/16776\n\nPlease read my other blog on walking the Borders of NoMAD/Rose Hill:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/16580\n\nPlease enjoy my blog on ‘Walking the Borders of Kips Bay’ on MywalkinManhattan.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/15049\n\nPlease enjoy my blog on ‘Walking the Streets of Kips Bay’ on MywalkinManhattan.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/15954\n\nPlease enjoy my blog on “Walking the Avenues of Kips Bay” on MywalkinManhattan.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/15820\n\nThe Flatiron District on Fifth Avenue in 2023\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe weather finally broke, and it has cooled down to a pleasant 87 degrees. Thank God because it was a nice day in the City walk around and visit the Flatiron District without sweating like crazy. The last few walks I have done in the neighborhood have been in the mid 90’s and that got to be too much.\n\nI had spent the morning working in Social Services at the Soup Kitchen, helping people with things like getting clothes, writing out haircut vouchers and getting them toiletries. It is a lot of running around but the best part was that I really felt that I was helping people in need. The weather cooperated, and it was so nice to be outside enjoying the sunshine. It was a productive afternoon.\n\nAfter I finished lunch, I was off to walk the Avenues of the Flatiron District. I have to admit that this has been one of the harder neighborhoods to research because there are so many amazing buildings to view, and the architecture is so detailed that it takes time to look up at all the ornamentation on the buildings. As I said in my previous blog on the borders of the neighborhood, these companies built these buildings to impress and last forever.\n\nI started the walk at the intersection of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and West 25th Street at the General Worth Memorial, a distinct triangle park right across the street from Madison Square Park. This is the Memorial to and burial site of General William Jenkins Worth.\n\nWilliam Jenkins Worth was a native New Yorker (Hudson, NY) and decorated Army officer who had served our country in the Battles of 1812, The Second Seminole War and the Mexican American War. His series of campaigns shaped this Country to where it is today. He died working for the Department of Texas in 1849 (Wiki).\n\nArmy General William Jenkins Worth\n\nThe General’s remains are buried under the monument at Worth Square at the corner of Fifth Avenue, Broadway and East 24th and 25th Street. General Worth was interned here in November of 1857 on the anniversary of the British leaving the colonies (NYCParks.org).\n\nThe Worth Monument between East 24th and East 25th Street at Broadway and Fifth Avenue\n\nThe Worth Monument was designed by artist James Goodwin Batterson, whose main profession was one of the founders of the Travelers Insurance Company in Hartford, CT and helped design the Library of Congress Building in Washington DC. He had immersed himself in his father’s quarrying and stone importing business early in his career and traveled extensively to Europe and Egypt for the job. He designed this monument in 1857 (Wiki).\n\nArtist and Designer James Goodwin Batterson\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Batterson\n\nTurning the corner at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue is Madison Square Park, named after our fourth President of the United States, James Madison. This well landscaped park is the gathering place of the residents of NoMAD and has a wonderful playground that has been busy the whole time I have spent in the neighborhood.\n\nMadison Square Park is an interesting little oasis from all the traffic and office space. It has an interesting history since it was designated a public space in 1686 by British Royal Governor Thomas Dongan. It has served as a potter’s field, an arsenal and a home for delinquents. In 1847, the space was leveled, landscaped and enclosed as a park. It became part of the New York Park system in 1870. There are many historical figures featured in the park (NYCParks.org). The park today is a major meeting spot for residents and tourists alike with a dog track and the original Shake Shack restaurant.\n\nMadison Square Park in the Spring when I was walking the length of Broadway\n\nhttps://madisonsquarepark.org/\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/madison-square-park\n\nWhen I walked into the park to take a break, it must have been the busiest section of the neighborhood between the playground and the original Shake Shack that were serving food to a crowd clung to their cellphones.\n\nAnother sculpture that is in Madison Square Park is the statue of William Henry Stewart, the former Governor of New York State, US Senator and Secretary of State during the Civil War. He also negotiated the Alaskan Purchase in 1867.\n\nGovernor William Henry Stewart statue in Madison Square Park\n\nGovernor William Henry Sewart, who negotiated the Alaskan Purchase “Sewart’s Folly”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Seward#:~:text=William%20Henry%20Seward%20(May%2016,as%20a%20United%20States%20Senator.\n\nThe statue was designed by artist Randolph Rogers an American born sculptor who studied in Italy. He was a Neoclassical artist known for his famous historical commissions.\n\nArtist Randolph Rogers\n\nhttps://www.shsart.org/randolph-rogers\n\nMadison Square Park is noted for its beautiful plantings, shaded paths and for being home to the first Shake Shack, a Danny Meyers restaurant and popular upscale fast-food restaurant.\n\nThe very first Shake Shack is in Madison Square Park\n\nhttps://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/\n\nAs you look down further on the square, you will see the Flatiron Building one of the most famous and most photographed buildings in New York City. The building was designed by Daniel Burnham as a Renaissance Palazzo with Beaux-Arts style. The original name for the building was the “Fuller Building” for the Company. The name “Flatiron” comes from a cast iron clothes iron from the turn of the last century. (Wiki)\n\nThe ‘Flatiron’ Building at 175 Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatiron_Building\n\nAs you pass the Flatiron Building and continue the walk south between 23rd and 14th Streets, take a look up to admire the buildings that once help make up the “Ladies Shopping Mile”, once the most fashionable neighborhood after the Civil War for shopping, hotels and entertainment (See my blog in MywalkinManhattan.com “Walking the Ladies Shopping Mile”).\n\nMy Christmas Blog on “Victorian Christmas in New York City”: Day One Hundred and Twenty-Eight:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/8117\n\nThe buildings that line Broadway from the Flatiron Building until you get to Bowling Green Park at the tip of Manhattan are some of the most beautiful and detailed examples of Victorian architecture and were built between 1870 to about 1915. You really need to put the cellphone down and look up when walking south on both sides or you might miss the details of these buildings.\n\n907 Broadway-The Warren Building\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/bushwick/907-broadway/83372\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-1891-warren-building-nos-903-907.html\n\nThe Warren Building is another example of turn on the last century elegance. Designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White in 1896, the building was designed in the Neo-Renaissance style (Daytonian).\n\nOne of the most elegant buildings on this part of Broadway is the former “Lord & Taylor” building at 901 Broadway. The building was constructed for the department store in 1870 and was the main store until 1914. Really take time to look at the detail work of the store and step inside. The Mansard Roof is an amazing touch. In 2022, it is now a restaurant on the lower level.\n\n901 Broadway “Lord & Taylor” building from 1870-1914\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/former-lord-taylor-building\n\nI walked back through Madison Square Park after my walk down Broadway and there were two small jazz concerts that were going on at opposite side of the park. Two three person combos were entertaining people by the fountain and near Shake Shack and on a sunny after there was a pretty big crowd enjoying the park and listening to the music.\n\nWalking down Fifth Avenue was interesting on both sides as you will notice how ornate the buildings are as you travel from West 25th to West 20th Street leading me to believe how important of a shopping and business district this once must have been. Here and there from the Flatiron Building you can see all the elegant and ornate buildings that line the Avenue.\n\nI started my walk south down Fifth Avenue and here and there you need to look up and admire the details of the buildings. On the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street is 186 Fifth Avenue, which was built for the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1883.\n\n186 Fifth Avenue-The Western Union Telegraph Company Building\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/flatiron-union-square/186-fifth-avenue/39081\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-1883-western-union-building-186.html\n\nThe building was designed by architect Henry J. Hardenberger in the Queen Anne style with its details being in brick and terra cotta (Daytonian in Manhattan). The building just finished a restoration, and you can see the details by the windows and dormers.\n\nAt 170 Fifth Avenue and West 22nd Street, you can see the beauty and elegance of the Beaux Art details of the former Sohmer Piano building. The building was built between 1897-88 and designed by architect Robert Maynicke for the owners of the Sohmer Piano Company for their showrooms and offices. The company was known for its introduction of the baby grand piano (Wiki/Daytonian in Manhattan).\n\n170 Fifth Avenue-The Sohmer Piano Building\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohmer_Piano_Building\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/06/1898-sohmer-piano-co-building-170-fifth.html\n\nAt 166 Fifth Avenue, the building has almost a confectionary look of a wedding cake. This commercial building was constructed in 1900 by the architectural firm of the Parfitt Brothers in the Northern Renaissance Revival style with all sorts of embellishments around the windows and doors with an elaborate roof design. In the beginning it housed art galleries and upscale retailers until the area became manufacturing at the turn of the last century. It has made a full swing again as a luxury retailer building on street level (Daytonian in Manhattan/Streeteasy/LoopNet.com).\n\n166 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/07/parfitt-brothers-no-166-fifth-avenue.html\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/166-5-avenue-new_york\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/166-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/25113417/\n\nOn the corner of West 21st Street and Fifth Avenue is 162 Fifth Avenue, another impressive building with interesting details. This office building was built in 1930 and is still used for commercial purposes.\n\n162 Fifth Avenue and West 21st Street\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/162-5-avenue-new_york\n\nhttps://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/united-states/properties/for-lease/retail/ny/new-york/162-fifth-avenue/s120974483s120974559-l\n\nAt the edge of the neighborhood standing guard in the Flatiron District is 156 Fifth Avenue, the Presbyterian Building. This building has an interesting past being built for the Presbyterian Church for offices for missionary work when the neighborhood housed many religious institutions (Daytonian in Manhattan/LoopNet.com).\n\n156 Fifth Avenue and West 20th Street\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/02/presbyterian-building-156-fifth-avenue.html\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/156-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/14050649/\n\nIt was designed by architect James B. Baker in the French Gothic style, and you have to admire the roof for its unique details.\n\nThe detail in the entrance of the building\n\nAs I rounded the corner of the neighborhood at West 20th Street another building caught my eye at 150 Fifth Avenue, the former Methodist Book Concern. The building was built between 1888-90 and designed by architect Edward Hale Kendall in the Romanesque Revival style. It had originally held the offices, printing and a chapel for the church. This was the section of Fifth Avenue that housed many religious offices and headquarters (Wiki).\n\n150 Fifth Avenue-The Methodist Book Concern\n\nhttps://www.150fifthave.com/\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/02/methodist-book-concern-150-5th-avenue.html\n\nWalking north back up Fifth Avenue is 141 Fifth Avenue another confection of architecture. This gorgeous building was built in 1897 by architect Robert Maynicke, who had also designed Sohmer Piano Building at 170 Fifth Avenue, in the Beaux Arts style for the Merchant Bank of New York (Flatironnomade.nyc/fsiarchitecture.com).\n\n141 Fifth Avenue-The Merchants Bank of New York Building\n\nhttp://www.fsi-architecture.com/building-renovations/141-fifth-avenue-new-york-ny\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/141-fifth-avenue-new_york\n\nThis impressive bank has recently been converted to luxury apartments with a current one sold at over three million dollars.\n\nThe entrance to 141 Fifth Avenue\n\nI made my way back up Fifth Avenue and admired all these buildings once again. Each has their own style and design and since the time of their construction continue to live on in different forms for various companies. Since many were built at the turn of the last century it also proved to me how well constructed and designed these buildings are and how desirable they are in the marketplace as you will not see this construction again. These were made to last and give this section of Manhattan its unique appearance and its own sense of character.\n\nThe Flatiron District from Fifth Avenue and East 23rd Street\n\nThe beauty of the Flatiron District at night\n\nI found myself hungry again and took the subway back down to Chinatown to visit many of the takeout places and bakeries that were on my list to visit. I have been building up my blog, DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com and wanted to see how many of them had stayed open post pandemic. Many of these little ‘hole in the wall’ restaurants are going strong as Chinatown is continuing to come back to life.\n\nMy blog “DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/\n\nI started my walk in Chinatown at China North Dumpling at 27A Essex Street across from Seward Park for some fried dumplings and spring rolls. For ten large fried dumplings that were really juicy and well cooked, four spring rolls and a Coke it was $7.00. Everything was so well made, and you can watch from the counter the ladies making the fresh dumplings right in front of you. The place is real bare bones, but the food and the service are amazing. Try to eat at the counter and watch everything get prepared.\n\nChina North Dumpling at 27A Essex Street located in the Lower East Side\n\nhttp://www.china-north-dumpling.com/\n\nThe Dumplings at China North Dumpling are made right in front of you\n\nIn needed something sweet after all the fried foods so I headed back to Yue Lai Bakery at 137 East Broadway to look for a baked pork bun. They had none left at that time of the day, but they were having a special on their baked goods three for $2.00 and I picked out a Coconut Bun, a Cream filled Bun and a Plain Bun.\n\nThey bagged it all up for me and I walked over to Sewart Park across the street and sat on the benches and ate them one by one. The Cream and Plain buns were really good and very sweet, and everything was so soft and well baked. I ended up sharing the Coconut Bun with the little birds in the park who surrounded me looking for a handout.\n\nYue Lai Bakery at 137 East Broadway\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/250454930/Yue-Lai-Bakery-New-York-NY\n\nThe buns at Yue Lai Bakery are delicious\n\nAfter a nice rest in the park and enjoying the sunshine and watching families play with their kids, I found myself still hungry. So, I walked down Hester Street from the park and made my way to King Dumpling this time for some steamed Pork and Chive Dumplings. For ten dumplings and a Coke it was only $5.00. The Steamed Pork & Chive Dumplings were excellent and again were freshly made right in front of us. They are large and well-cooked and burst with juiciness when you bite into them.\n\nKing Dumpling at 74 Hester Street\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Chinese-Restaurant/King-Dumplings-358670851431724/\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/31859492/King-Dumplings-New-York-NY\n\nSteamed Dumplings at King Dumplings are also made right in front of you\n\nThe place was packed with customers and people getting takeout. It is amazing to me how many people write about both King Dumpling and China North Dumpling and I had never really noticed them before. I saw them on a Fung Brothers “Cheap Chinatown Eats” video and then wanted to try them.\n\nMy last stop on the eating tour because even after twenty dumplings, four spring rolls, three pastries and three Cokes, I was still hungry and needed that baked pork bun. I found it at Happy Star Bakery at 160 East Broadway and it was just $1.75. Not the $3.50 in Midtown as I recently found at Dim Sum Sam in the Theater District. It was soft and chewy and filled with the most amazing, chopped pork and baked into a sweet dough. I barely made it out the door and I was finished with it.\n\nHappy Star Bakery at 160 East Broadway\n\nhttps://zmenu.com/happy-star-bakery-corp-new-york-online-menu/\n\nThe roast pork buns are amazing\n\nAfter all the munching on snacks throughout the afternoon, I needed a good walk so I double backed and walked around the Twin Bridges section of the neighborhood walking down Henry, Madison,"
