        "text": "The Disney store, whose arrival on a chic corner of Fifth Avenue in the mid-1990s heralded a fleet of corporate flagships, is preparing to exit the Manhattan stage.\n\nDisney notified state officials this week that it planned to close the 30,000-square-foot World of Disney emporium by Dec. 31, leaving its 148 employees without jobs. The closing would leave Disney without a store of its own in Manhattan for the first time in more than 15 years.\n\nThe company has smaller, simpler stores in malls in Queens, on Staten Island and in Garden City on Long Island. It has been looking for a new location near Times Square since last year but has yet to find one, said Faith Hope Consolo, chairwoman of the retail group at Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.\n\nMs. Consolo said the high cost of Disney’s prime space at a corner of 55th Street and Fifth Avenue “did not make economic sense” for the company anymore. She estimated that the company paid as much as $15 million a year in rent. For $2 million or $3 million in annual rent, Disney could get a storefront in the Times Square area that could serve its purpose of having a presence where tourists congregate, she said.\n\nA Disney spokeswoman in Orlando said the company did not renew its lease on Fifth Avenue because the rent would have been too high, She said the company was considering opening another store in Manhattan but that it would be part of the mall-store chain, not a World of Disney store run by the resorts division.\n\nThe World of Disney store on Fifth Avenue was the company’s biggest outside its theme parks when it reopened in its current state about five years ago. Before that, the space, which had been home to La Côte Basque restaurant for four decades, housed the flagship of the Disney stores chain.\n\nDisney sold its stores to another retailer, Children’s Place, in 2004, but kept the Fifth Avenue location and ran the World of Disney store through its theme-parks division. After the Children’s Place subsidiaries that operated the Disney stores filed for bankruptcy protection, Disney took the stores back last year and closed about 100 of them."
