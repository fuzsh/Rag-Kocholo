        "text": "The Financial District’s rapid transformation from an office to a residential neighborhood has been immensely beneficial to Lower Manhattan, and the area’s recent boom has been mostly free of architectural casualties. But that’s about to change thanks to demolition beginning on the old vestry at 68-74 Trinity Place, which will soon be removed to make way for a new Pelli Clarke Pelli-designed mixed-use building standing almost 500 feet tall.\n\nProperty owner Jeff Alexander and developer Summit Equities are planning to convert the six-story manufacturing building at 39 Clarkson Street, in the West Village, into nine condominiums. According to DNAinfo, three more stories will be added up top, and the cellar will be excavated to accommodate four parking spaces. A variance from the city is required for the conversion.\n\nAn anonymous LLC has filed applications for an eight-story, single-family residence at 526 Canal Street, in northern Tribeca. The building will measure an impressive 12,100 square feet, stand 100 feet tall, and will replace an existing four-unit building, which has already been slated for demolition. Living quarters will start on the third floor and span through to the seventh.\n\nAccording to Schedule A, the “grand hall” will take up of the first floor, and a wine cave, service kitchen and formal dining room can be found on the second level. Up top, the eighth floor will have a pool, hot tub and sun room, which will open up to outdoor space and a roof garden. DXA Studio is the architect of record, and may also be designing."
