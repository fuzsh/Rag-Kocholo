        "text": "For many years, only tourists regarded the Tel Aviv shoreline as the most attractive place in the city. Tel Avivians considered it indecent because of improper body exposure and unhealthy due to the seaside humidity. The shore – neglected and detached from the fabric of the city – attracted marginal groups whose behavior was considered unsuitable or even deviant (Azaryahu 2001). A classic, removed, &#39;other&#39; space resonating with Foucault&#39;s concept of heterotopia. It was only in the 1980s that the municipality and the broader public discovered the beach as an asset and that massive development took off. With these changes the marginal ecology of the shoreline and the patchwork of other worlds suddenly found itself within the fabric of the city. The shoreline became a very interesting composite of &#39;normative&#39; space dotted with &#39;pockets of deviant behavior&#39;. While some of those pockets were quickly pushed out, some maintain for decades as distinct territories...\n\nThis introduction to the thematic issue connects the contributors’ arguments to the broader context of existing literature and to current epistemological predicaments. The notion of waterfront has endured for over 100 years within planning documents and policy discourses, shaping urban strategies and citizens’ preferences across the world. This thematic issue examines the current state of narratives and discourses on waterfronts. Waterfronts are investigated to consider the conceptual work evoked to frame urban problems and build narratives that shape planning and policy action. It is asserted that narratives about waterfronts differ: while some define goals for city development relying on specific strands of expert knowledge to justify often questionable decisions, others capture the experiences and representations of waterfronts, including their subjective and autobiographical dimensions.\n\nThis dissertation examines how the urban landscape of mid-19th-century Boston’s North End was constructed and understood—physically, socially, and culturally—by the city’s different social groups. Over the course of the 19th century, Boston’s North End gained a reputation as a “slum” characterized by its deteriorating buildings, overcrowded housing, and immoral immigrant population—a stereotype that did not reflect the reality of the neighborhood’s working-class residents. The dissertation identifies specific experiences, practices, and perceptions that created different understandings of the same physical space. This study makes a significant contribution to the understanding of urban landscapes by incorporating tangible artifacts excavated from domestic contexts in analyzing intangible social processes by employing a practice theory-based framework that interweaves archaeological and historical data to address social structures on multiple spatial scales: Boston as a macro-scale landscape; the medium-scale North End neighborhood; and micro-scale individual actions. The archaeological data analyzed for the study originated from two ca. 1850–1880 privy deposits associated with working-class North End households: a brothel/tenement at 27–29 Endicott Street¬¬ and a boardinghouse at 19–21 North Square. To interpret these data within their historical and cultural context, city directory and census records are cross-referenced with Boston Valuation List tax records to compile a database of residential and commercial activity between 1850 and 1880 on the blocks surrounding these sites. The research shows how the conceptualization of the North End as a “slum” was constructed by middle-class and elite observers to assign personal responsibility to the poor for the structural poverty endemic to a capitalist economy and also to facilitate the development of their own class identities. Archaeological analysis reveals that North End residents constructed their neighborhood landscape by enacting household practices in public spaces, creating a sense of familiarity and control. They re-appropriated objects usually associated with middle-class culture by using them in unintended ways, creating new symbols and values that helped form a distinct working-class culture. By dressing and behaving in public in ways that subverted dominant social norms, working-class Bostonians used their bodies to create an urban landscape in which they and their culture could thrive."
