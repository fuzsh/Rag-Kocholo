        "text": "West:\n\nCentral Park\n\nAn 853-acre expanse of green in the middle of Manhattan, its 25 million annual visitors make it the most-visited public park in the world. Responding to calls from civic leaders like William Cullen Bryant, the city acquired the land in 1853 and held a design contest in 1857, choosing the Greensward Plan of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux (rhymes with \"Walks\"). After the moving of 3 million tons of earth and the planting of 270,000 trees and shrubs, the park—almost entirely landscaped, despite its naturalistic appearance—opened to visitors in 1859 (though not officially completed until 1873).\n\nPioneers Gate\n\nOne of the 20 gates named by the Commissioners of Central Park in 1862—though the names were not actually inscribed until 1999. The names were intended to reflect the democratic intentions of the park. In the original naming scheme, this gate was referred to as the Explorer's Gate:\n\n\"It is fitting that a welcome should be extended to the men who devote their energies to making new discoveries that enlarge the field of human action and add to the value of civilized life... A glance at the numerous expeditions that have been undertaken by Americans within the experience of the present generation, is sufficient to establish the claim of 'Explorer' to a cordial recognition.\"\n\nNo doubt the assignment of \"Pioneer\" to this gate reflects the remote character of 110th Street in the mid-19th century.\n\nHarlem Meer\n\nThis 11-acre lake (which is \"meer\" in Dutch) is the third-largest body of water in Central Park, after The Reservoir and The Lake. It was originally a brackish wetland at the coming-together of Montayne's Rivulet (now The Loch) and Harlem Creek, an inlet of the East River that no longer exists aboveground. Dredged into open water by Olmsted, it was given a concrete shoreline by Robert Moses in the 1940s that was removed in a 1990s renovation.\n\nBernard Family Playground\n\nCentral Park's smallest playground, intended for toddlers and pre-school children, has a striking view of the Meer.\n\nConservatory Garden\n\nCentral Park's only formal garden was originally a nursery to supply plantings for the park; later, from 1898 to 1934, it was home to a greenhouse known as the Conservatory. When the greenhouse had to be dismantled in 1934 because it cost too much to maintain, replacing it with a garden became one of the first efforts of the Works Projects Administration, which created more or less the current garden in 1937.\n\nThe six-acre garden is divided in three parts with distinct styles. The northern third is in the French mode, noted for its spring tulips and autumn mums; it's centered on the Untermeyer Fountain, featuring Walter Schott's sculpture Three Dancing Maidens.\n\nThe center portion is Italianate, showcasing flowering crabapple and wisteria. Its focus is a geyser fountain known as the Conservatory Garden Center Fountain.\n\nThe southernmost section is an English-style garden with abundant magnolia and lilac. A pool here presents statues of Mary and Dickon from The Secret Garden.\n\nThe wrought iron Vanderbilt Gates mark the entrance to the gardens; originally designed by George B Post for the Vanderbilt mansion at 5th Avenue and 58th Street, they were salvaged and gifted to the park in 1939 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.\n\nFormer Marion Sims Statue\n\nA statue of J. Marion Sims, a pioneer of gyneco- logical surgery, stood here from 1934 until 2018. (The statue, by Ferdinand Miller, was first placed in Bryant Park, and was moved here during subway construction to a place opposited the Academy of Medicine.) Sims' surgical experiments were conducted on enslaved women, generally without anesthesia, a brutal history that led to the relocation of his statue to Green-Wood Cemetery, where Sims is buried. (photo: Charles Smith)\n\nGirls' Gate\n\nOne of the 20 gates named by the Com- missioners of Central Park in 1862—though the names were not actually inscribed until 1999. The names were intended to reflect the democratic intentions of the park. The Commissioners wrote:\n\n\"The Boys gate and the Girls gate will convey the idea that ample opportunity for physical development is considered a necessary part of the free educational system of the city, and will recognize the fact that it is not thought sufficient for the young students of either sex to be liberally provided with schools, schoolteachers and schoolbooks, but that they must also be induced to study freely the works of nature.\"\n\nNeue Galerie\n\n1048 (corner): This six-story Louis XIII-style townhouse was designed by Carrere and Hastings for William Starr Miller (1856-1935), a lawyer and industrialist who married Edith Warren (1866-1944), the sister of architect Whitney Warren, who lived on the same block. Their daughter was Edith Starr Miller, a far-right conspiracy theorist who married Almeric Paget, Lord Queenborough, here in 1921.\n\nAfter Edith Warren Miller's death, the house was bought by Grace Vanderbilt (1870-1953), widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt III and grand dame of New York society, who had been forced to sell her palatial mansion to the Astors, and referred to this place as \"the gardener's cottage.\"\n\nThe house next became the home of YIVO, the world's largest Yiddish-language archive, now located on West 16th Street.\n\nIn 1994, it was purchased by cosmetics tycoon Richard Lauder, who opened the Neue Gallerie New York here in 2001, a museum of early 20th century German and Austrian art, featuring works by artists like Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and George Grosz. When Lauder purchased Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I for the museum in 2006 for a reported $135 million, it set a record for the highest price paid for a painting. The museum is a tribute to Lauder's late friend, the art dealer Serge Sabarsky. (cc photo: Mark Hinchman)\n\n1046: Landmark Branding calls this 1967 Modernist apartment building \"a brash and ugly intrusion into the district\" with \"all the style of a discarded pair of cheap sunglasses.\" Harry Hopkins, a top advisor to FDR, moved to an earlier house here in 1945 and died a year later (NNY).\n\n1040 (corner): A 17-story apartment building built in 1930; designed by Rosario Candela, it's noted for the picturesque collection of arcades and chimneys on its roof. Its most famous resident was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who lived here from 1964 until her death in 1994; from her full-floor 15th floor apartment, she had a view of the Temple of Dendur that she helped bring to New York, and the Reservoir that now bears her name. Other notable residents include fascist-friendly publisher Generoso Pope, Nazi-coddling Gen. Lucius Clay, Vietnam war criminal Robert McNamara and US Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.\n\nPreviously on the lot was the mansion of financier James Clews, as well as that of architect Whitney Warren, co-designer of Grand Central Station.\n\nWest:\n\nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\n(1000 5th Ave): The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City's premier art institution, was incorp- orated in 1870 and moved to this location in 1880. (The city's gift of Central Park's land to the museum is why New Yorkers can pay whatever they wish here.) The original building was designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould in a red-brick High Victorian Gothic style, already seen as dated at the time. This became the rear central portion of the museum, engulfed by the Beaux Arts facade now associated with the Met, which was designed by Richard Morris Hunt and completed in 1902 by his son, Richard Howland Hunt, and George B. Post.\n\nThe facade sculpture by Karl Bitter includes caryatids representing Sculpture, Painting, Architecture and Music, as well as portraits of the artists Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Dürer, Rembrandt and Velázquez. The blocks of stone atop the pillars were intended to become representations of Egyptian, Greek, Renaissance and Modern art, but were left unfinished for financial reasons.\n\nThe north and south wings were added by Charles Follen McKim from 1906-18. The Modernist rear wings were added by Kevin Roche from 1978-87.\n\nAmong the masterpieces in the Met's collection are Vincent Van Gogh's Wheat Field With Cypresses, El Greco's View of Toledo, Rembrandt's Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer, Vermeer's Young Woman With a Water Pitcher, Picasso's Gertrude Stein, Emanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware, John Singer Sargent's Madame X, Breugel's The Harvesters, Valasquez's Juan de Pareja and Jacques Louis David's Death of Socrates.\n\nThe 2,000-year-old Temple of Dendur, rescued from the rising waters of the Aswan Dam and relocated here in 1963, is the only complete Egyptian temple in the Western Hemisphere. It's housed in the Sackler Wing, named for the family that played a major role in the opioid crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n\nThe Period Rooms, featuring complete interiors from various eras, were used as a hiding place by the kids in From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. The title character in 1999's The Thomas Crown Affair plots an art theft at the Met, while the crew in Ocean's 8 runs a jewelry heist at the Temple of Dendur—which is also featured in When Harry Met Sally and 2007's I Am Legend.\n\nOn February 4, 1963, the Met welcomed its most famous visitor — the Mona Lisa, loaned to the US by special request of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. After a million art lovers paid their respects, the painting went back to France on March 7 and hasn't left to Louvre since.\n\nFragment of a monumental statue of Alexander the Great.\n\nGrapevines by Tiffany.\n\nEl Greco's Saint Jerome.\n\nPerseus with the head of Medusa—by Antonio Canova.\n\nAugust Saint-Gaudens' Diana, formerly atop Madison Square Garden (when it was on Madison Square).\n\nThe Met's extensive collection of armor includes a suit made for Henry VIII.\n\nPharaoh Hatshepsut, stepmother of the pharaoh to whom the Obelisk is dedicated.\n\nAmong the Met's European paintings are one-seventh of all the Vermeers in existence.\n\nUnidentified Object\n\nStanding outside the museum just to the south is this sculpture by Isamu Noguchi (1904-1988), the Japanese-American artist and designer. The son of Japanese poet Noguchi Yone and editor Leonie Gilmour, who was born on East 7th Street. Isamu was born in Los Angeles and was raised by his mother largely in Japan, but studied art in the East Village and did some of his most important work from a studio in Greenwich Village. There is a museum dedicated to his art in Long Island City.\n\nFriedman Playground\n\nThis playground is notable for the Paul Manship sculpture Group of Bears, donated to the park in memory of furniture designer Pat Hoffman Friedman by her husband. A smaller version of the three bears is found nearby at the Ancient Playground. (cc photo: Wally Gobetz)\n\nEast:\n\n1028 (corner): What appears at first glance to be one palatial mansion is actually three separate structures: On the corner is a Beaux Arts townhouse designed in 1901 by CPH Gilbert for leather manufacturer Jonathan Thorne. Next door, formerly No. 1027, was built in 1903 for financier George Crawford Clark, and No. 1028 was first occupied in 1906 by William and Mary Kingsland. The latter two buildings were skillfully designed by Van Vleck & Goldsmith to form a harmonious whole with their neighbor to the north.\n\nAfter Thorne's death in 1920, his home was purchased by Florence Vanderbilt Burden, Commodore Vanderbilt's great-granddaughter. She sold it to the Order of the Sacred Heart of Mary, which opened a school for girls here \"in connection with Marymount College,\" which promised to protect young ladies from \"socialism and chaos.\"\n\nThe school acquired the house next door in 1936, and the Kingsland house in 1950—the year the school started admitting boys—making the illusion of the three houses' unity a reality.\n\n1025: This address is just an entrance arcade to two 1955 co-ops on 83rd and 84th streets, which share only a lobby and this prestigious address. To make room for this gimmick, developers demolished a 1906 townhouse designed by Ogden Codman for Lloyd S. Bryce.\n\n1020 (corner): This 1925 building by Warren & Wetmore is \"one of the supreme residential buildings of New York,\" and one of its \"grandest pre-war apartment buildings,\" according to Carter Horsley. It has 14 floors but only 13 apartments—some of which have ceilings up to 18 feet high.\n\nWoolworth heiress Barbara Hutton moved here in 1926 when she was 14, and stayed into the 1930s (NNY). Samuel Kress, who ran a competing chain of dime stores, lived here with his collection of Italian Renaissance masterpieces. Republican fundraiser Georgette Mosbacher lived here from 1992-2017, where she threw parties attended by royalty, presidents and movie stars.\n\nPreviously at this address, from 1906-24, was the mansion of financier William Salomon, filled with old masters and antique tapestries. It had in turn replaced the grand house of Richard Arnold, founder of the Arnold & Constable dry goods store.\n\n1016 (corner): A 15-story building from 1926, designed by John B. Peterkin. Legendary acting teacher Stella Adler had been living here for many years by the time of her death in 1992. (NNY)\n\n1014: This townhouse sandwiched between two much larger apartment buildings was built in 1907, originally one of a matched pair with No. 1015. Its first owner was stock broker JAF Clarke, who in 1926 sold it to his next door neighbor, James Watson Gerard (1867-1951), whose own home was being torn down to make way for 1016.\n\nGerard, a lawyer and politician, had served as ambassador to Germany in the years leading up to World War I. Eleanor Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower were frequent visitors to his home here.\n\nAfter his widow died in 1956, the property was bought by the West German government, which opened it to the public in 1961 as Goethe House, a center to promote German culture. It served that role until 2008, when the FDNY pointed out that the building's graceful six-story open staircase would turn the building into a blast furnace in the event of a fire. It's been unoccupied since then.\n\n1010 (corner): A 15-story co-op built in 1928 by Fred F. French. Wall Street lawyer Wendell Willkie (1892-1944) spent the last 15 years of his life here, including his unsuccessful 1940 Republican challenge to FDR. New York Times publisher Arthur \"Punch\" Sulzberger was living here at the time of his death in 2013.\n\nThis was also home to Julia Meade, an actor who became famous in the early days of TV as a pitchwoman for Lincoln cars, and to JFK's sister Patricia Kennedy Lawford after her separation from actor Peter Lawford.\n\nThe Stanhope\n\n995 (corner): This 16-story building designed by Rosario Candela opened in 1927 as the Stanhope Hotel, one of New York's most prestigious hotels. Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco stayed here when they visited New York, as did Golda Meir, the Agha Khan, Maria Callas and Ringo Starr. Charlie Parker was visiting a friend here, Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswater, when he died here March 12, 1955, at the age of 34 (NNY). Socialite Kiki Preston jumped to her death from her fifth floor apartment on December 23, 1946.\n\nThe Rembrandt Room here featured pianist George Feyer from 1968 to 1980, and singer Greta Keller through 1964.\n\n993: This 19-story building, with a distinctive red-tile roof concealing its watertower, was designed by Emery Roth in 1930; it has just 17 apartments, whose occupants have included songwriter/performer George M. Cohan, who died here November 5, 1942 (NNY); financier/art collector Arthur Altschul; and PR consultant Howard Rubenstein.\n\nPreviously on this site was the manstion of Louis Stern, co-founder of Stern Bros. department store, built in 1887 to a Schickel & Ditmars design.\n\nAmerican Irish Historical Society\n\n991: A five-story Beaux Arts townhouse from 1901, originally built for Mary Augusta Leroy King, a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant. After her 1905 death, it was owned by banker David Crawford Clark, who hired Ogden Codman to redesign the interiors.\n\nUS Steel president William Ellis Corey bought it in 1918 with his wife, the former Broadway star Mabelle Gilman; he had scandalized society by leaving his first wife to marry her in 1911. This marriage, too, ended in divorce in 1923; William Corey died here in 1934.\n\nCorey's son by his first marriage sold the building in 1939 to the American Irish Historical Society, which would occupy it for the next 80 years. Battered by charges of nepotism and mismanagement, the society put the townhouse on the market in 2021.\n\nIt serves as the townhouse of billionaire Logan Roy on the TV show Succession.\n\n990 (corner): A 14-story building from 1927, designed by Rosario Candela and Warren & Wetmore. It contains only six apartments—five duplexes and a triplex penthouse. Actor Peter Lawford and his wife, the former Patricia Kennedy, bought an apartment here in 1964, though the couple soon split.\n\nPreviously on the site was the CPH Gilbert-designed Woolworth Mansion, where dime store tycoon Frank Woolworth lived from 1901 until his death here in 1901. He was living here when he built (and paid for) the Woolworth Tower in 1913. His granddaughter, Barbara Hutton, stayed here briefly after her mother's suicide at the Plaza Hotel in 1917 (NNY).\n\nWest:\n\nMiner's Gate\n\nOne of the 20 gates named by the Commis- sioners of Central Park in 1862—though the names were not actually inscribed until 1999. The names were intended to reflect the democratic intentions of the park. The term \"miner\" was intended to \"include the workers in coal, and the different ores, and also the quarrymen or miners of stone.\"\n\nAs discovered by the website PopSpots, this was the location of the pretzel vendor featured on the cover of the Steely Dan album Pretzel Logic.\n\nCedar Hill\n\nA popular hill for sledding in winter, named for the red cedars on its crest. The undulating terrain reflects glacial scarring.\n\nThe Glade\n\nThis grassy area is said to appear in the film Enchanted, part of the \"That's How You'll Know\" number. Not to be confused with the Children's Glade, which is on the opposite side of the park. This is the one with Calvert Vaux's Glade Arch, an 1862 sandstone bridge that used to carry carriage traffic over a footpath, but now just ornamently separates pedestrians from other pedestrians.\n\nJames Michael Levin Playground\n\nThis perimeter playground, built in the 1930s, was dedicated in 1987 to James Michael Levin, a three-year-old killed by a hit-and-run driver in 1959, when his mother Janice Levin funded its renovation. It's designed to appeal to toddlers.\n\nThe playground features the Sophie Irene Loeb Fountain, which portrays characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, including Alice, the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat. It was sculpted by Frederick Roth, who also made Central Park's Balto and Mother Goose, as well as the dancing bear and goat at the Central Park Zoo.\n\nSophie Irene Loeb (18761929), the fountain's namesake, was a journalist for the New York Evening World and the first president of the Child Welfare Board. One of the many reforms she campaigned for was the addition of playgrounds to Central Park.\n\nAlice in Wonderland\n\nThis 1959 sculpture by José de Creeft, featuring Alice on a giant mushroom surrounded by characters from the Lewis Carroll book, is designed to be climbed on by children. The statue was paid for by George Delacorte, who is the model for the sculpture's Mad Hatter.\n\nConservatory Water\n\nPlanned as the reflecting pool for a glass conserv- atory that was never built, it's now known as the Model Boat Pond, famous for the miniature ships sailing its waters, as featured in E.B. White's Stuart Little.\n\nWest of the pond is a statue of Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), sculpted by Georg John Lober in 1955. (Lober also made Times Square's George Cohan.) It's the site of a summer reading program.\n\nThe Conservatory Water is a prime spot to watch for Pale Male— maybe the world's most famous bird, and at 31 years old in 2021, the oldest hawk ever recorded in the wild.\n\nOn the eastern shore of the Conservatory Water is the Kerbs Memorial Boat House, where model boats are stored and rented (cc photo: Ajay Suresh). The building was built in 1954 with a donation from Jeanne Kerbs in honor of her parents; her father, Edward Kerbs, was a wealthy cigar manufacturer.\n\nPilgrim Hill\n\nAnother popular sledding hill, it's named for the statue of a pilgrim by John Quincy Adams Ward, given to the park by the New England Society in 1885. (Ward sculpted Indian Hunter, William Shakespeare and the 7th Regiment Memorial elsewhere in the park, and George Washington and the Stock Exchange pediment, both on Wall Street.)\n\nWaldo Hutchins Bench\n\nThis bench honors Waldo Hutchins (1822-1891), a commis- sioner of Central Park from 1857-69, and again from 1887-91. The bench bears a Latin motto that translates, \"You should live for another if you would live for yourself.\" It was designed by Eric Gugler, who redesigned the West Wing for FDR, and carved by the Piccirilli Brothers, who made Central Park's Maine memorial, the NYPL lions, the Custom House continents, the Washington Square Arch's Washingtons, the Stock Exchange pediment, and the Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial (cc photo: Gigi NYC).\n\nA sundial above the bench—which is an hour off during daylight savings time—bears a bronze figure by sculptor Paul Manship, as well as another Latin motto, which means, \"Do not let time destroy it\" (cc photo: Gigi NYC).\n\nA whisper on one end of the bench can be easily heard on the other, due to the curved bench's acoustics.\n\nEast:\n\nUkrainian Institute\n\nCorner (2 E 79th): A five-story townhouse built in 1899 to a CPH Gilbert design, decorated with sea life. The first owner was coal tar magnate Isaac Fletcher; after he died in 1917, it was bought by Harry Sinclair of Sinclair Oil, who spent a year in prison in connection with the Teapot Dome scandal. In 1930, the house was bought by Augustus van Horne Stuyvesant, the last patrilineal descendant of Peter Stuyvesant. Two years after his death in 1953, it became the headquarters of the Ukrainian Institute of America.\n\nFrench Cultural Services\n\n972: This five-story townhouse was built as a wedding present for William Payne Whitney and Helen Hay, given to them by Whitney's fabulously wealthy uncle, Oliver Payne. (Hay, the daughter of diplomat John Hay, was a poet and children's book writer.) The house was designed by Stanford White in Italian Renaissance style; it is considered one of his finest houses. It included a fountain with a statue White had purchased in Italy, which turned out to be by Michelangelo; it's currently on display at the Met. The architect was murdered shortly before the house was completed in 1906.\n\nWhen Payne Whitney died in 1927, the place seems to have been inherited by his son John Hay \"Jock\" Whitney, though his mother lived here until her death in 1944. The son was a very successful investor; two of his successful ventures were the Broadway hit Life With Father and the film Gone With the Wind. (Rumours that a scene from Gone With the Wind was shot in the house are unconfirmed.) Jock Whitney was the last publisher of the New York Herald Tribune, from 1961-66 (NNY).\n\nCorner (1 E 78th): Built in 1912 for James Buchanan Duke (1856-1925), a founder of the tobacco trust, to a design by Horace Trumbauer, who emulated the Hotel Lobottiere in Bordeaux. His widow Nanaline and their daughter, Doris Duke, donated the house in 1958 to NYU to house its Institute of Fine Arts.\n\nThe building has been used for such films as Arthur, The Greatest Showman and The Goldfinch.\n\n945 (corner): A 1949 building by Emery Roth & Sons has 107 units on 19 floors. The octagonal water tower on top \"conjures the aesthetics of Mayan temples or battleship leviathans,\" according to Carter Horsley.\n\nPreviously on this site was the grand-domed Temple Emanu-el, built in 1891. It merged with Temple Beth-el and moved down to 65th Street in 1939.\n\n944: A 1925 Italian Renaissance building designed by Nathan Korn; it has 14 stories and 15 co-op apartments. A white-glove co-op where the doorman actually wears white gloves, it's been home to TV personality Barbara Walters.\n\nCommonwealth Fund\n\nCorner (1 East 75th): This was the mansion of Edwin Harkness, an early investor in Standard Oil and at one point the sixth-richest person in the US. Completed in 1908 to a James Gamble Rogers design, the marble house reflects what passes for modesty in a multi-millionaire; for example, it has seven stories but appears to only have four, as two are underground and the top floor is hidden in the cornice. Harkness insisted that it bear a 75th Street and not a Fifth Avenue address, forcing his neighbor to cover up the \"1\" carved on the house next door.\n\nHarkness was a supporter of the Met, with a particular interest in Egyptology; he gave the museum its famous blue hippo. He and his wife Mary not only funded the exploration of King Tut's tomb, they visited it a year after its rediscovery.\n\nAfter the deaths of Harkness and his wife, in 1940 and 1950, respectively, the house was left to the Commonwealth Fund, founded by his mother Anna Harkness in 1918 \"to enhance the common good,\" with a particular focus on healthcare.\n\n927 (corner): This 12-story building with 12 apartments was built in 1917 to a Warren & Wetmore design. The building has been home to such notables as TV star Mary Tyler Moore, CNN anchor Paula Zahn, financier Bruce Wasserstein and shoe seller Kenneth Cole.\n\nBut the most remarkable resident of this building might be Pale Male, a red-tailed hawk and possibly the world's most famous bird. He arrived in Central Park in 1991, at a time when redtails were an uncommon site in cities. In 1993, he built a nest on 927 with his mate at the time, a hawk known as Chocolate; the nest was initially removed, but was allowed to remain when the hawks rebuilt it. Since then, Pale Male and a series of partners have raised numerous hawk chicks here.\n\nIn 2004, the co-op board voted to remove the nest once again; after an international outcry, the board backed down and allowed Pale Male and his mate at the time, Lola, to rebuild. But there hasn't been any successful hatchings at the nest since then.\n\nPale Male was still alive as of 2021, making him at least 31 years old and one of the oldest hawks on record. (cc photo: Dave Hensley)\n\n926: One of a pair of townhouse survivors, both built in 1899 to designs by CPH Gilbert. In 2008, the lease on this house was bought by Loews Hotel chair Jonathan Tisch for $21 million—purchasing the right to rent the place for $37,000 a year.\n\n925: The smaller of the pair of Gilbert townhouses was originally built for John W. Simpson, founder of the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which helped KKR take over RJR Nabisco and assisted in the IPOs for Google, Tesla, Facebook and Alibaba.\n\n923 (corner): A 21-story white-brick apartment building from 1951, one of the first post-war structures on Fifth Avenue. The address used to belong to a Neo-Classical marble townhouse designed by Robert Maynicke for Randolph Guggenheimer, a lawyer, real estate developer and one-time acting mayor.\n\nThe entire first floor was a grand entrance, and the roof was supported by caryatids. In 1928, the house was leased to drug maker Nicholas Partos, who successfully fought off a burglar here in 1928, but was himself convicted of fraud two years later (as related by Daytonian). The building was demolished along with four buildings to left and right in 1945 to make way for the present building.\n\nWest:\n\nInventor's Gate\n\nOne of the 20 gates named by the Commis- sioners of Central Park in 1862—though the names were not actually inscribed until 1999. The names were intended to reflect the democratic intentions of the park. The \"inventor\" was described as one \"whose labors are devoted to the study of natural laws, and to a searching analysis of the various mechanical possibilities that are within the scope of human effort, with a view to combine the results of the knowledge thus obtained in such a way as to confer fresh benefits on the race. To this class of minds we are indebted for the printing-press, the steam-engine, the electric telegraph, and for a thousand other but little less important discoveries.\"\n\nThere was an idea that the named gates would each be accomanied by a statue of a represent- ative figure. But the only one that seems to have happened was Byron Pickett's statue of Samuel Morse, unveiled on April 27, 1871, the telegraph inventor's operator's 80th birthday (cc photo: Peter Roan). Morse is the only person honored with a Central Park statue while still alive—a rule was passed soon afterwards making being dead a prerequisite.\n\nEast 72nd Street Playground\n\nBuilt in 1936 and redesigned in 1970 as an adventure-style playground, it underwent subsequent renovations in the late 1990s and in 2015. It was voted the best play space in Central Park in 2016.\n\nRichard Morris Hunt Memorial\n\nBuilt into the perimeter wall is a monument to Richard Morris Hunt (1827-95), a prominent Beaux Arts architect. Dedicated in 1898, the memorial features a statue of Hunt, along with figures representing Architecture and Art, by Daniel Chester French, who also did the statue of Lincoln in his memorial in DC.\n\nHunt designed the entrance of the Metropolitan Museum as well as the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. His proposal for a Classical entrance to Central Park at 60th Street and Fifth Avenue prompted the resignation of the park's designers, Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert Vaux, until the proposal was dropped.\n\nDene Summerhouse\n\nThis rustic structure visible from 5th Avenue sits atop Dene Rock and overlooks The Dene, a winding valley laid out by Olmsted that connects the Children's Zoo to East Green. It's a popular spot for weddings.\n\n107th Infantry Memorial\n\nA powerful sculpture, completed in 1927, featuring seven U.S. soldiers fighting in World War I. The sculptor, Karl Illava, was himself a sergeant in the 107th and able to depict the trauma of war from first-hand experience.\n\nThe 107th descends from a New York State Militia unit formed in 1806 in response to skirmishes with the British Navy off the coast of Sandy Hook. As the 7th Regiment, it helped to put down the Astor Place Riot in 1849, the Dead Rabbits and Bowery Boys in 1857 and the Draft Riots in 1863. Known as the Silk Stocking Regiment because of its ties to New York's social elite, it was based at the impressive Park Avenue Armory.\n\nBilly Johnson Playground\n\nAlso known as the Rustic Playground, it features play equipment made of wood and other natural materials, as well as a 45-foot slide coming down off Dene Rock.\n\nStudents' Gate\n\nOne of the 22 named entrances to Central Park—it seems to be the only one without its name carved in the perimeter wall.\n\nCorner (2 E 67th): This 13-story Rosario Candela building went up in 1926 on the site of Temple Beth-El, an 1891 synagogue designed by Brunner & Tryon that merged with Temple Emanu-El. It's home to New York Observer founder Arthur Carter, cosmetics billionaire Leonard Lauder and Loews Hotels CEO Jonathan Tisch, who paid $48 million for an apartment here in 2008.\n\nSerbian Mission\n\n854: This Beaux Arts townhouse, a survivor of what was once a row of mansions along Fifth Avenue, was built in 1905 for R. Livingston Beeckman (later governor of Rhode Island) to a design by Warren & Wetmore, architects of Grand Central Terminal.\n\nIt was bought by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946 to serve as its permanent mission to the UN; the mission was more permanent than the multiethnic nation, which was whittled down to just Serbia by 2006. A 1975 bombing broke windows in the mission; the perpetrator, Serbian nationalist Bosko Radonjic, became leader of the Irish-American crime gang The Westies after being released from prison in 1982.\n\nCorner (1 E 66th): This 19-story Rosario Candela apartment building was one of the architect's last, built in 1948. Vera Tucker, who lived here more than half a century, made headlines in 1986 when, as an 87-year-old, she knocked a pursesnatcher off his bicycle here by whacking him with her umbrella.\n\nPreviously on this was the mansion of Henry Havemeyer, founder of Domino Sugar, who with his wife Louisine amassed an amazing art collection, featuring important works by the likes of Rembrandt, El Greco, Manet, Degas and Monet (many of which ended up in the Met). The house where these were displayed was itself a masterpiece, with an interior designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. It was torn down in 1930, a year after Louisine's death.\n\nWest :\n\nThe echo-y archway connecting the Central Park Zoo to the Children's Zoo is named the Denesmouth Arch.\n\nDelacorte Music Clock\n\nEvery half hour from 8 am until 5 pm, the bronze animals on this musical clock whirl into action, playing one of the 44 songs in their repertoire. The clock was a gift from George Delacorte, founder of Dell Publishing, who also gave Central Park the Delacorte Theater and the Alice in Wonderland statue. Andrea Spadini was the sculptor.\n\nCentral Park Zoo\n\nThe zoo dates back to the earliest days of the park, when people used to donate miscellaneous animals which were displayed near the Mall. It was chartered by the New York Assembly in 1864, making it the second-oldest public zoo in the country (after Philadelphia's), and the oldest zoo in New York.\n\nIn 1865, around the time it acquired a trio of Cape buffalo General William Sherman had picked up during his march through Georgia, the menagerie was moved to the Arsenal. Against the opposition of Central Park architects Olmsted and Vaux, permanent enclosures were built on the site of the present Zoo in 1870.\n\nIn 1934, new enclosures for the animals were designed by Aymar Embury, who designed hundreds of projects for Robert Moses. Some of his neo-Georgian brick and limestone buildings, arranged in a quadrangle around the sea lion tank, still remain, but the depressing menagerie-style cages were eliminated in a 1988 redesign by Kevin Roche, Dinkeloo, after the New York Zoological Society took over the facility.\n\nThe zoo's best-known resident was Gus the polar bear, whose psychological issues stemming from captivity, and his keepers' efforts to treat his neuroses, made him his species' most famous individual--the subject of books, a play, even a song by The Tragically Hip. He died in 2013, at the advanced age of 27, one of very few bears to get a New York Times obituary. His enclosure now holds grizzly bears, who seem to fare better in captivity.\n\nOther zoo notables include Roy and Silo, a same-sex chinstrap penguin couple. (They have since broken up.) Also on view are sea lions, snow monkeys, red panda and dozens of species in an indoor rainforest. Since 2009, the zoo has been home to three rare snow leopards.\n\nA perfect symbol of wildness captured by civilization, the zoo features in such films as Madagascar, The Day After Tomorrow, Jack Nicholson's Wolf and Woody Allen's Alice; books like Mr. Popper's Penguins and Catcher in the Rye; and the Simon & Garfunkel song \"At the Zoo.\"\n\nChildren's Gate\n\nOne of the 20 gates named by the Commis- sioners of Central Park in 1862—though the names were not actually inscribed until 1999. The names were intended to reflect the democratic intentions of the park.\n\nIn the original naming scheme, the commissioners noted: \"The Park is already used freely and enjoyed heartily by troops of young children, and the Children's Gate will help to keep in mind the fact that, in the course of the next 20 years, the whole army of industrious workers, who are now vigorously laboring for the general welfare, must have received large reinforcements from the band of little ones who are today so tender and helpless.\"\n\nThis gate is well-placed opposite 64th Street, as it leads to the Central Park Zoo, many a child's favorite part of the park.\n\nThe Arsenal\n\nOne of only two buildings in Central Park that are older than the park itself, The Arsenal was, as its name suggests, originally used to store arms for the New York State National Guard. It replaced a former repository located in what's now Madison Square Park; it was constructed between 1847 and 1851 in a project overseen by state comptroller Millard Fillmore, who later became president. It was designed by architect Martin E. Thompson to look like a medieval fortress, with a crenulated cornice.\n\nIn 1857, it was bought by the city and turned into an administrative office and police station for the nascent park. In 1859, it began to accumulate a collection of animals donated by notables like PT Barnum, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and August Belmont—a menagerie that was evicted in 1871 as unsafe and smelly.\n\nFrom 1869 to 1877, it was a temporary home for the American Museum of Natural History, as well as a dinosaur reconstruction studio. It also served as an art gallery and the site of Central Park's weather station, relocated to Belvedere Castle in 1918.\n\nWien Walk\n\nEntering the park from Freedman Plaza, you will find many sketch artists and a few puppeteers or balloon animal makers. There used to be more masseuses.\n\nIt's named for Lawrence Wien, a real estate lawyer who once owned the Empire State Building and the Plaza Hotel. He gave millions of dollars to Central Park and other nonprofit causes, particularly Columbia University.\n\nFreedman Plaza\n\nDoris Freedman, the plaza's namesake, was the city's first director of cultural affairs, the founder of the Public Arts Council and president of the Municipal Arts Society. Appropriately enough, her plaza is home to a series of temporary sculptural installations.\n\nScholar's Gate\n\nOne of the 20 gates named by the Commis- sioners of Central Park in 1862—though the names were not actually inscribed until 1999. The names were intended to reflect the democratic intentions of the park.\n\nThe commissioners original naming declared that the term \"scholar\" \"includes the Poet, the Divine, the Statesman, the Lawyer, the Author, the Editor, the Teacher, the Physician, the man of Science, and all, in fact, whose contributions to the welfare of the community are of a specially intellectual character.\"\n\nThis was intended to be and is the busiest entrance to the park. The architect Richard Morris Hunt proposed a grand Classical gateway here, a proposal that seemed so contrary to what they saw as the park's democratic spirit that designers Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert Vaux resigned until the idea was dropped.\n\nHotel Pierre\n\n795 (corner): A slender 41-story tower built in 1930 for acclaimed chef Charles Pierre, whose restaurant had just been replaced by the New York Central Building. The hotel didn't take off, however, until it was bought in 1938 by millionaire J. Paul Getty, whose \"smart set\" friends began staying here.\n\nFrench director Rene Clair moved here when he fled the Nazi invasion in 1940; Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor lived here when they were married in the 1940s.\n\nDashiell Hammett started writing The Thin Man here; he checked out without paying his bill, wearing all his clothes. John O'Hara wrote his first \"Pal Joey\" story here, after telling his wife he was going to Philadelphia and instead going on a two-day binge at the Pierre.\n\nWoolworth's heiress Barbara Hutton had a suite, leading striking clerks to picket the hotel, chanting, \"Is 18 dollars a week too much?\" Other notable guests and residents: Jimmy Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Tom Jones, Claire Trevor and Charles Bronson.\n\nOn January 2, 1972, armed robbers took over the hotel to rob its safety deposit boxes of as many as $10 million in jewels. Two of the crooks were soon caught; the rest got away with the bulk of the loot.\n\nAl Pacino, Robert Redford, Lee Iacocca and George Steinbrenner were a few of the devoted customers of the hotel barber, Gio Hernandez, who died in 1989.\n\nOn Mad Men, the relaunched Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce ad agency temporily does business out of a suite here.\n\nMetropolitan Club\n\nCorner (1 E 60th): A club founded in 1891 for the rich and powerful who weren't yet blue-blooded enough for older, snootier clubs, with J.P. Morgan as its first president and Cornelius and William K. Vanderbilt among its original members. The clubhouse was built in 1894, designed by Stanford White, with an east wing with a majestic semicircular gateway added in 1912.\n\nEast:\n\nOld Squibb Building\n\n745 (corner): This 1930 office tower designed by Eli Jacques Kahn, replaced part of Marble Row, a string of white marble buildings built by Mary Mason Jones, Edith Wharton's great-aunt, who appears in The Age of Innocence as Mrs. Mingott. When Marble Row was built, in 1867-69, the neighborhood was largely unpopulated, and the white marble material flew in the face of the ubiquitous fashion for brownstone. Though the houses have all been torn down--this end of the block went in 1929--they still echo in the white and/or marble used in their replacements and in surrounding buildings.\n\nThe street-level facade here, unfortunately, was redone in colored marble in 1988--originally to honor Kahn's supposed original intentions, thwarted by Depression Era cutbacks, then, when it turned out Kahn very much wanted a white building here, just because the owners didn't like white marble.\n\nThe lobby features a ceiling mural by Arthur Covey featuring stylized airplanes flying over Manhattan.\n\nThe Squibb Building was for many years home to the magical toy store F.A.O. Schwartz, which later moved next door, and now houses Bergdorf Goodman's Men's Store.\n\n743: Gilan jewelry\n\nCorner (1 E 57th): Louis Vuitton is on the site of Mary Mason Jones' own home on Marble Row. It was replaced in 1931 with the New York Trust Co. Building, by Cross & Cross, which followed the white-marble tradition that Jones had set. From 1993-2001, this was home to the whimsical Warner Brothers Store. The handbag company came in with a remodeling that replaced much of the white marble with a glossy green plastic-like substance. \"Every dog and every cat and every people has Louis Vuitton\" --Shonen Knife.\n\nWest:\n\nCorner (2 W 52nd): Formerly the site of the mansion of Emily Vanderbilt and her husband William Douglas Sloane, paid for by Emily's father William Henry Vanderbilt. It was part of the Triple Palace, three Vanderbilt mansions designed by John Butler Snook and built from 1879-82, all paid for by Emily's father William Henry Vanderbilt.\n\n650 (corner): This building was put up by the Pahlavi Foundation, a non-profit started in 1973 by the Shah of Iran--whether as a genuine charity or as a financial scam is unclear to me. In any case, it was taken over after the Iranian Revolution by pro-Khomeini types, who changed the name of the group to the Alavi Foundation and use it to promote Islamic culture. They apparently still get most of their money from the rent on this building from businesses like Mexx clothing and Travelers Fine Jewelry.\n\nReplaced the DePinna Building, a nine-story 1928 structure.\n\n642: This was the address of the middle section of the Triple Palace, belonging to William Henry's daughter Margaret and her husband Elliott Fitch Shepard.\n\n640 (corner): First National City Bank of New York; H & M. This was the address of William Henry Vanderbilt's own piece of the Triple Palace. (Actually, he got half of the bifurcated structure, which is only fair since he paid for it.) William, who headed the railroad empire after the death of his father, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, was at his death the wealthiest person in the world. Though noted for his quip \"The public be damned!\" he was reportedly much nicer than his father. Henry Clay Frick leased the house from 1905-14 before moving to the mansion that is now the Frick Collection.\n\nWest:\n\nRockefeller Center\n\nThe land that is now Rockefeller Center was once the Elgin Botanic Garden, 20 acres of mainly medicinal herbs established by Dr. David Hosack, the physician who attended Alexander Hamilton after his fatal duel with Aaron Burr. The Lewis and Clark expedition sent plants here for identification.\n\nThe garden was sold to the state in 1810, which granted it to Columbia University, which allowed the garden to be developed. In 1929, the land was leased to John D. Rockefeller, who built on it an Art Deco masterpiece that is one of New York City's crowning architectural achievements.\n\nInternational Building\n\n636 (corner): Completed in 1935 as part of the original Rockefeller Center complex, this is a reduced-scale (41 stories) version of the RCA Building. Its north wing was originally going to be a German counterpart of the Italian, French and British buil- dings to the south, but with Nazism on the march the idea was dropped and the building was generically internationalized. Attilia Piccirilli's Youth Leading Industry and Commerce and Industry with a Caduceus adorn the entrance; symbols of the continents are atop the building.\n\nLee Lawrie's Atlas, between the two wings, can be seen from St. Patrick's altar. It's one of the sites the sailors see in the movie On the Town; it also features in Gentleman's Agreement, Bonfire of the Vanities and Hercules in New York (where it's said to be not a good likeness).\n\n626 (corner): The Palazzo D'Italia is taken up entirely by Banana Republic's flagship store--what does that say about Italy? The entrance bronzes The Italian Immigrant and Italia by Giacomo Manzu were given to Rockefeller Center by Fiat.\n\nDepartment store owner Benjamin Altman died at this address on October 7, 1913.\n\nWest:\n\nEmpire State Building\n\nThis block was the site of two mansions owned by the Astor family--the northern half was owned by Caroline (Mrs. William) Astor, whose annual parties literally defined New York society; the ballroom could hold 400 guests, and these \"Four Hundred\" were considered the who's who.\n\nThe southern half held the mansion of her nephew, William Waldorf Astor, which inspired the fashion for mansard roofs. Feuding over who had the right to be referred to as \"Mrs. Astor,\" the nephew in 1893 replaced his house with the Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Hardenbergh, in order to spite his aunt. (Waldorf was John Jacob Astor's hometown in Germany.) Caroline Astor responded by replacing her own home with the Astoria Hotel, also designed by Hardenbergh, which were combined in 1897 to create the Waldorf-Astoria (though Caroline insisted on the right to re-separate the hotels at any time). The hotel catered to the super-wealthy; B.C. Forbes, of Forbes magazine, used to have a regular poker game there with Henry Clay Frick and other plutocrats. U.S. Steel was born at the hotel in 1901. The Waldorf salad was invented there in 1896, and Thousand Island dressing popularized; the Gibson and the Rob Roy were created at the Bull & Bear Bar here. In 1929 the hotel relocated uptown, and the Empire State Building was built on this site.\n\nWith ground broken on January 22, 1930, the building took only a year and 45 days to complete. The architect, William Lamb, said his design was inspired by a pencil. At 102 stories and 1,454 feet, it was the tallest building in the world from 1931 until 1974; there are still only three buildings in the world with more floors.\n\nThe mast on top was supposed to be a mooring tower for dirigibles, but the idea was abandoned due to chronic high winds shortly before dirigibles were themselves abandoned. On July 28, 1945, a B-25 bomber flying through fog crashed into the 79th floor, killing 11 people. Allen Ginsberg briefly worked in an advertising office here. The Heartland Brewery on the ground floor used to be a branch of the Longchamps chain, decorated in Mississippi riverboat style.\n\nThe building was famously climbed by the giant gorilla in King Kong, and was a meeting place for lovers in An Affair to Remember and Sleepless in Seattle.\n\nSee the official guide to the colors of the Tower Lights.\n\nWest:\n\n212 (corner): This was the site of Dodworth Studios, where Teddy Roosevelt took dance lessons as a boy. In 1876 Delmonico's, at the time the most fashionable restaurant in New York, moved here. The women's organization Sorosis met in an upstairs room. When Delmonico's moved uptown in 1899, it became Cafe Martin, where on June 25, 1906 architect Sanford White had his last meal before being shot at his Madison Square Garden.\n\nThis 21-story neo-Gothic building, designed by Schwartz & Gross, went up in 1913; the FX cable channel was here in the 1990s. In 2019 the three-story penthouse was bought by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (along with two other apartments in the building), despite his cancellation of plans to build a second Amazon HQ in Queens.\n\n210: Dramatic bay windows and over-the-top detailing mark the Cross Chambers Building, a 1901 project of John B. Snook & Sons. Used to house Dewey's Flatiron, notable neighborhood restaurant now on 30th Street; also used to be the flagship store of Mark Cross.\n\n208: Was Yedsonic electronics\n\n206: Memories of New York, elaborate souvenir shop. On the 3rd floor is Urban Angler. Here were the offices of Seven Days, the radical news magazine, from 1975–77.\n\n204: Pentagram, international design company that has done work for the Public Theater, the Mesa Grill and the New York Times Magazine, among other clients. Used to be MK, a 1980s nightclub where Moby played his first live electronic gig in 1989.\n\n202 (corner): Commonwealth Criterion, manufacturer of Christmas decorations, is part of the Christmas District. The site of Worth House, a hotel that by 1900 housed the Berlitz School of Languages. The present building, dating to 1918, was the flagship store (with science museum) of the A.C. Gilbert Company, a toy company that made the Erector set, radioactive chemistry sets and American Flyer model trains.\n\nEast:\n\nMadison Square Park\n\nThe 1807 plan set aside 240 acres in this vicinity as The Parade, to be used for military training. In that same year, the U.S. Arsenal was built here to defend the strategic intersection of the Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) and the Eastern Post Road. By 1814, when the park was named Madison Square after the then-current president, it had been reduced to 90 acres. In 1847, when Madison Square Park was opened, less than seven acres remained.\n\nThe park, which was laid out in its current form in 1870, was the center of New York society in the 1860s and '70s. \"The vicinity of Madison Square is the brightest, prettiest and liveliest portion of the great city,\" James McCabe wrote in 1872.\n\nIn July 1901, an attempt to turn seating in the park into a for-profit concession sparked rioting.\n\nThe park provides a setting for O. Henry short stories like \"The Cop and the Anthem\" and \"The Sparrows in Madison Square\").\n\nThe U.S. Arsenal was converted by 1824 to the House of Refuge of the Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents—the first such institution in the country.\n\nAdmiral Farragut Memorial\n\n1881 commemoration of David Glasgow Farragut, Civil War fleet commander, best remembered for his \"damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead\" line. Sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, pedestal by Stanford White. Considered to be the first use of Art Nouveau in U.S.\n\nEternal Light\n\nWorld War I memorial flagpole (1918–23), said to symbolize the eternal peace produced by the \"War to End All Wars.\" When Charles Lindbergh was given a parade in 1927—attended by an estimated 4 million spectators—he stopped here to lay a wreath.\n\nWilliam Seward Statue\n\nStatue of William Seward (1801-72); an early abolitionist who became NY governor (1838–42) and a U.S. senator (1848–61), he served as secretary of state under Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. He's best remembered for buying Alaska (\"Seward's Folly\") from Russia for $7 million in 1867. In 1876, sculptor Randolph Rogers, after being stiffed on his commission, reused a cast of Lincoln's lanky body to make the statue cheaply; Seward was actually a short man with a big head."
