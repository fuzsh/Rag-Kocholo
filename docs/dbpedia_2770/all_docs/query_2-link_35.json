        "text": "Are you ready for a shopping adventure? Combine picture-perfect beaches and delicious Riviera Maya cuisine with a fun-filled day at the shops. There is nothing more exciting than finding unique souvenirs and Playa del Carmen certainly doesn’t fail to deliver. One of the most popular tourist attractions in Mexico, 5th Avenue Playa del Carmen – “La Quinta Avenida” to locals – is 22 blocks of high-end retailers, bars, restaurants, local shops, cafes, and much more. Yet, this street is so much more than its retail offering, it’s about the experience. Shop Mexico like never before and enjoy the eclectic mix of high-end luxury and traditional handicrafts sold in the 5th Avenue shops.\n\nThe best time to enjoy Playa del Carmen shopping largely depends on personal preference. Yet, it is worth noting that Playa del Carmen is a bustling tourist destination, and during high season when the weather is dryer (December to April) the streets will be busier than normal. If you wish to score a bargain, May to November is considered low season as the high temperatures can occasionally be interrupted by rain showers. It is during this time when shop owners drop their prices to attract passers-by into their colorfully decorated stores. On national holidays such as Mexican Independence Day (September 16) and Revolution Day (November 20), it is also common for shops to advertise special offers and discounts. If you are keen to mix and match your shopping trips with cultural highlights, the Riviera Maya Jazz Festival in November and the BPM Festival in January are ideal choices.\n\nHungry? Playa del Carmen’s 5th Street best restaurants won’t disappoint, no matter what you’re in the mood for. First things first, before you embark on your shopping adventure, fuel up at one of the local bars or restaurants with a traditional Mexican breakfast of Chilaquiles or Churros con Chocolate. In between hopping in and out of the 5th Avenue Playa del Carmen shops, there are many places to enjoy a well-earned pit stop. Here are some of our favorites.\n\nWhether you’re looking for a high-energy night out on the town or a chilled-out Riviera Maya evening, downtown Playa del Carmen 5th Avenue always delivers. And what’s even better is that these bars are all located a stone’s throw from the best hotels in Playa del Carmen.\n\n5th Avenue Playa del Carmen is a colorful mix of craft bazaars, independent boutiques, and Playa del Carmen shopping outlets. But, when hunting for traditional souvenirs that represent the beauty and the rich culture of the country, it is important to know what you are buying. Mexican handicrafts are an obvious choice and you will often find them sold at cheaper prices on 5th Avenue than you would at the airport. Embroidered shirts, pottery, handwoven baskets, and hammocks are all sustainable souvenirs that help support the local community. Silver jewelry is also an important souvenir since Mexico is celebrated for its high-quality silver. Tequila and Mezcal make wonderful presents for friends and family as does Mexican candy which comes in a variety of flavors ranging from sweet to spicy. If you have a large luggage allowance you may want to shop local artwork on 5th Avenue’s thriving art scene. Whatever takes your fancy, it is always rewarding to choose souvenirs that help support the local community and act as a colorful reminder of your time spent in this corner of the Mexican Caribbean."
