The olive bar alone can send Manhattanites into fits of rhapsody, and don't even get people started on the cheese. Even if you're not looking for fresh seafood or produce, the store is worth a trip just for the glimpse it provides of Upper West Side life in all its fast-talking, Democrat-voting, bagel-noshing glory. For the full Nora Ephron experience, go in the morning and have brunch at the upstairs cafe. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 2127 Broadway, +1 212 595 1888, </em><a href=\"http://www.fairwaymarket.com/\" title=\"\"><em>fairwaymarket.com</em></a>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227264691/Fairway-Market-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n173\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanThe Strandhttp://www.strandbooks.com40.733282-73.991068Quite possibly Manhattan's best book store, the Strand is one of the few shops remaining from the days when Union Square was a readers' mecca. Don't go in looking for a specific title – the shelves are far too disorganized and the selection far too eclectic to help much with that. Instead, plan to spend an hour or two (or four) losing yourself in the store's famous \"18 miles of books\", including crowded sections dedicated to contemporary fiction, biography, history, and New York City. The art books upstairs are particularly popular, as is the downstairs collection of review copies straight from the desks of the city's book critics.<br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 828 Broadway, +1 212 473 1452, </em><a href=\"http://www.strandbooks.com\" title=\"\"><em>strandbooks.com</em></a>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227382464/Strand-Bookstore--001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n174\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanBookMarchttp://www.marcjacobs.com/40.735783-74.005156Designer Marc Jacobs has spent most of the last decade colonizing a shady stretch of Bleecker Street in the West Village – and pricing out local mom-and-pop stores. One such store was the tweedy, literary Biography Bookshop, which Jacobs replaced with a bookshop of his own. BookMarc specializes in tomes about fashion and art as well as small, affordable gifts such as postcards and Marc Jacobs–branded school supplies. The mix of highbrow contemporary culture and presents for friends back home makes it feel like a museum gift shop, even if there's no museum in sight. It's a must-see for the fashion-obsessed, and a lesson in the ruthlessly Darwinian nature of New York real estate for everyone else. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 400 Bleecker Street, +1 212 620 4021, </em><a href=\"http://www.marcjacobs.com/\" title=\"\"><em>marcjacobs.com</em></a>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227438474/BookMarc-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n175\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanC.O. Bigelowhttp://www.bigelowchemists.com/40.734017-73.999245In a city where beloved diners and indie boutiques have the disturbing tendency to disappear overnight, C.O. Bigelow is remarkable for its history and tenancy. According to legend, both Mark Twain and Eleanor Roosevelt shopped at the 168-year-old apothecary, and Thomas Edison supposedly once stopped by after burning his finger working on a light bulb. Today, the store occupies a prominent spot on Sixth Avenue in the West Village and sells old-fashioned but unfusty products such as Smith's rosebud lip balm and Marvis toothpaste. It also features higher-end lines like local cult favorite Malin+Goetz skincare and decadent Diptyque candles. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 414 Avenue of the Americas, +1 212 533 2700, </em><a href=\"http://www.bigelowchemists.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bigelowchemists.com</em></a>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227551450/C.O.Bigelow-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n176\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanMurray's Cheese Shophttp://www.murrayscheese.com40.731077-74.002983The West Village has changed a lot since Spanish civil war veteran Murray Greenberg opened his shop on Bleecker in 1940, but one thing that's remained constant is the neighbourhood's love of cheese. In the 70s, Calabrian immigrant Louis Tudda bought the store from Greenberg and transformed it into a staple for local Italian families; current owner Rob Kaufelt took over in 1991 and added another revamp, bringing in gourmet varieties and adding speciality foods such as <a href=\"http://www.nimanranch.com/Index.aspx\" title=\"\">Niman Ranch</a> charcuterie. Murray's staffers take pride in their knowledge of cheese, and the store offers workshops for foodies who want to know more about the dairy arts.<br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 254 Bleecker St, +1 212 243 3289, </em><a href=\"http://www.murrayscheese.com\" title=\"\"><em>murrayscheese.com</em></a>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227612556/Murrays-Cheese-Shop-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n177\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanOakhttp://www.oaknyc.com/40.726583-73.993466Don't be intimidated by all the angular, androgynous hipsters going in and out of this NoHo shop – or actually, do, since that's part of the fun. Oak, which also has a branch in Williamsburg, keeps the city's party kids outfitted in skinny jeans, asymmetrical tank tops, and clompy boots.

Some pieces are antique, or at least retro (check out Mad Men-era bracelets that spell out names such as Peggy and Marilyn), while others are handmade from repurposed materials. It's hard to believe jewelry this affordable can also be socially responsible, but Weiner and her colleagues offset 300% of their carbon emissions and donate 5% of their after-tax profits to charity. They've also imbued their store policy with a personal touch: lose one of their earrings, for example, and they'll send you a replacement for half-price. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 173 Elizabeth Street, +1 212 334 6383, </em><a href=\"http://ericaweiner.com/\" title=\"\"><em>ericaweiner.com</em></a>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227723184/Erica-Weiner-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n179\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanKioskhttp://www.kioskkiosk.com40.723323-73.999196This wonderfully odd gift shop is as much museum as it is boutique. Every few months the owners travel to a foreign destination, where they stock up on well-designed quotidian objects and the occasional piece of folk art. Back in their raw, second-story space, they arrange their finds as if they're curating a gallery show, but price them as if they're running a drugstore. (Recent stock has included a jump rope for under $20 and a pack of multi-colored pipe cleaners for $6.) It doesn't hurt that all this eccentricity is located less than half a block off a chain-store-clogged stretch of Broadway, proving the old, weird SoHo isn't gone entirely. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 95 Spring St, +1 212 226 8601, </em><a href=\"http://kioskkiosk.com/\" title=\"\"><em>kioskkiosk.com</em></a>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227778842/Kiosk-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n180\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanDolce Vitahttp://www.dolcevita.com/40.720817-73.987858Every season, Dolce Vita pinpoints the biggest trends in women's shoes, reinterprets them in wearable, affordable ways, and sells them to half the fashion-conscious ladies in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Their ability to gauge exactly what women want is uncanny, and if the quality isn't superb, at least the price is right – try $77 for strappy flat sandals, or $149 for on-trend espadrille wedges. The big, cheery Ludlow Street shop also sells going-out tops and printed cocktail dresses, while down the block, a spin-off store called J.D. Fisk caters to the guys with equally of-the-moment shoes and menswear. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 154 Ludlow Street, +1 212 253 5935, <a href=\"http://www.dolcevita.com/\" title=\"\">dolcevita.com</a></em>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227829789/Dolce-Vita-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n181\n\nNew YorkShoppingManhattanSteven Alan Annexhttp://www.stevenalan.com/40.718367-74.005704Steven Alan knows exactly what hip New Yorkers want to wear, especially on their days off: Artfully rumpled button-downs for the men, little patterned dresses for the women. His all-American creations embody effortlessness in a city that's jam-packed with people trying too hard. (You know Jersey Shore? This is the opposite.) Alan is known as much for being a curator as a designer, filling his stores with equally cool, casual brands like APC and Rachel Comey, and he's a whiz at discovering young designers – a nod from him is a sign that an up-and-coming brand is doing something right. He's got locations around the city, but the TriBeCa Annex feels the most like home, since it shares Franklin Street with his corporate headquarters and showroom. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 103 Franklin St, +1 212 343 0692, <a href=\"http://www.stevenalan.com/\" title=\"\">stevenalan.com</a></em>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303227882226/Steven-Alan-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-best-manhattan-shops\n\n182\n\nNew YorkEatsBrooklynRoberta’shttp://www.robertaspizza.com40.704965-73.933547What began as an under-the-radar pizzeria in Brooklyn with no liquor licence and no real menu to speak of has grown, in the last three years, into a veritable gourmet juggernaut beloved by food obsessives. First and foremost, Roberta's is a pizzeria, and an excellent one at that. But it also serves an evolved, inventive menu of plates – braised tripe, duck tagliatelle, sweetbreads with taleggio, pork chops – and a little-publicised tasting menu reserved for those who call ahead. Add to that an off-site rooftop farm, a catering arm, and an in-house radio station and one gets a sense of the culinary cool that surrounds this place. Worth the detour, but beware – the weekends bring crowds. <br/><br/>\n\n• <em>261 Moore St, +1 718 417 1118, </em><a href=\"http://www.robertaspizza.com\" title=\"\"><em>robertaspizza.com</em></a><em>, mains $7-19</em>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303228277998/Robertas.-001.jpgAmanda Kludthttp://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-brooklyn-restaurants\n\n183\n\nNew YorkEatsBrooklynBeer Tablehttp://beertable.com40.663641-73.984265Ostensibly a great hangout for beer lovers due to their wide and eclectic ever-changing selection of brews, Beer Table is actually a wonderful spot for a meal. They of course serve upmarket, beer-friendly bar snacks – pickled eggs, fresh radishes with butter, caramelised onions and ricotta on toast – but they also have a seasonal, three-course dinner menu and an excellent artisanal cheese list. The offerings, which include weekend brunch, are especially ambitious given the size of the 40sq ft kitchen, and are about as affordable as it gets in this neighbourhood. Which is great, because those specialty imported microbrews can get costly.<br/><br/>\n\n• <em>427 7th Ave, + 1 718 965 1196, </em><a href=\"http://beertable.com\" title=\"\"><em>beertable.com</em></a>, <em>three courses for $25</em>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/19/1303228340353/Beer-Table-001.jpgAmanda Kludthttp://ny.eater.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-brooklyn-restaurants\n\n184\n\nNew YorkEatsBrooklynFette Sauhttp://www.fettesaubbq.com40.714142-73.956501Built out of an old auto body garage in what was once an ugly stretch of Williamsburg, Fette Sau is a barbecue and beer mecca for the neighbourhood, and a total hipster magnet. They serve all manner of smoked meats from good quality local farms. Best are their sausages, ribs, burnt end baked beans and pulled pork, but do go ahead and try some more adventures offerings like Wagyu beef cheeks and pig tails.

Motorino, located just steps from the L-train in Williamsburg, has a fiery pizza oven and is constantly packed with the young and beautiful residents of the neighbourhood. They serve some meats and cheeses, a respectable salad and a wonderful grilled mortadella, but, really, this is a place for the pizza. Get the masterly white brussels sprout pizza with pancetta, the satisfyingly spicy soppressata piccante, or the straight-up classic margherita.

The monstrous place gets packed during peak dim sum hours on the weekends, but you should go at peak times anyway to witness the hustle and bustle. The dumplings, shrimp rolls, buns, congee, and just about anything from the carts can be recommended. And for those who go during regular service, spring for a giant king crab if available.

Now more than 120 years old, Luger takes up a large building in the shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge and has served everyone from Alfred Hitchcock and James Cagney to Robert De Niro and Jerry Seinfeld. The restaurant includes a bar and two dining rooms with old wood floors, chandeliers, exposed beams and plenty of original accents. But the main reason to visit is the excellent steak.

So it was curious to see them parlay their talent and popularity into this German/American steakhouse. A little more upmarket and swanky than their rustic spots, Prime Meats looks like a turn-of-the-century saloon – both in its decor and in the look of the mustachioed staff – and serves a knockout menu of premium steaks and chops alongside Germanic meats and cheeses, homemade pretzels, addictive <em>spaetzle</em>, and a selection of fish and salads.

Which means you'll be getting thinner, chewier bagels (imported from up north), and Montreal-style cured brisket that's fattier than corned beef and moister than pastrami. But there's more than just meat at this 20-seat slither of a space. During the day, try the chicken salad topped with chicken skin or the smoked mackerel, or come at night for a gut bomb of a dinner.

For one, it's tucked into the quiet, almost hidden Vinegar Hill neighborhood, a 10-minute walk from Dumbo and most public transportation. Walking those twisty, empty cobblestone streets is like stepping into another time, another place, most definitely another city. But then the restaurant itself amplifies the experience with its cosy, old-time ambiance, wooden floors and distressed wallpaper, plus a back bar made out of a re-purposed old organ. As for the food, it's hard to go wrong but the red wattle country chop is a cult favorite.

The owners, themselves a married couple, are obsessed with sustainable production, though never at the expense of style. Ask about the provenance of a chambray shirt or a pair of house-label jeans, and you're liable to wind up getting a mini-lesson on American fashion history disguised as a funny story about the road trip they took to the factory. For girls, the shop does carry a small range of tops, dresses, and jackets, but the real focus is on Epaulet-brand clogs and footwear from such crunchy-but-trendy brands as Melissa and Toms. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 231 Smith St, +1 718 522 3800, </em><a href=\"http://www.epauletshop.com/\" title=\"\"><em>epauletshop.com</em></a>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/cities/2011/5/2/1304353856409/Epaulet-NY-shop-001.jpgIzzy Grinspan http://ny.racked.com/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-brooklyn-shopping\n\n231\n\nNew YorkShoppingBrooklynErie Basinhttp://eriebasin.com/40.676813-74.013695Hidden in quiet, industrial Red Hook, this tiny shop focusses on antique jewelry.

Only a few feet from the waterfront, pansexual (and sometimes underage) partygoers converse over cigarettes outside, and get sweaty to eclectic pop songs on the small dance floor. It has seen several incarnations: the late Don Hill opened up shop in 1991, attracting Greenwich Village skaters and scenesters like a young Chloë Sevigny. In the early noughties it was arguably the defining hipster hang-out, earning international attention and internet mockery. Today, former <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/bar/beatrice-inn/\" title=\"\">Beatrice Inn</a> owners Paul Sevigny and Nur Khan keep the place semi-seedy, throwing porn stills up on the walls, serving mixed drinks (under $10) in plastic cups, and, in their own words, \"keeping bathroom sex alive\".

André Saraiva's Le Bain, one half of the floor, even comes equipped with a mini indoor swimming pool; it's what a country kid dreams up when they think of New York City. Brooklyn-based New Yorkers and low-key visitors might find the space over-the-top. Tan seventies-style couches, dark floors, celebrity patrons like Madonna, and an expensive drink menu are all present at the sizable space. (Well, Madonna's presence isn't guaranteed.) But Le Bain's romance-ready, 360 degree views of Manhattan and New Jersey – particularly lovely from its 2,200 sq ft terrace or from its floor-to-ceiling windows – are unbeatable. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• The Standard, 444 West 13th St, </em><a href=\"http://www.standardhotels.com/new-york-city/\" title=\"\"><em>standardhotels.com</em></a>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/cities/2011/5/2/1304333553870/Le-Bain-NY-001.jpgMike Vilenskyhttp://nymag.com/author/mike%20vilenskyhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-manhattan-bars\n\n254\n\nNew YorkNightlifeManhattanBig Bar40.727501-73.986397This East Village staple, established in 1990, has a deliberately misleading moniker. It's a tiny watering hole with the feel of a cheap, old New York apartment, lit by a few red bulbs. The spot hasn't changed much since it opened: blues plays at a low volume and the few mint green booths fill with friends who are looking for a place to converse and sip a single beer on tap. Stay late enough, and the boite can have a decidedly David Lynch-like feel – disarmingly small, green and red, and stuck in the 90s – but the friendly female bartender is far less harrowing than a Lynch character. <br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 75 East 7th St</em>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/cities/2011/5/2/1304333617516/Big-Bar-NYC-001.jpgMike Vilenskyhttp://nymag.com/author/mike%20vilenskyhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-manhattan-bars\n\n255\n\nNew YorkNightlifeManhattanThe Lobby Bar at the Ace Hotelhttps://www.acehotel.com/newyork40.745603-73.987876An unlikely spot for an aggressively hip bar, the Lobby Bar is perhaps Midtown's chicest drink option, and the best place to wait for maids to ready your room. Operated by popular restaurateurs April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, taxidermy raccoons and big leather seats are scattered throughout the spacious room (which also serves as the actual hotel lobby), and the place quickly fills up with sophisticated, foreign hotel guests and generally deep-pocketed Manhattanites alike. Together, they all sip local beers in the dim light, surrounded by plush pillows, green lanterns, and scattered old books. A smaller, less cluttered space downstairs is reserved for performances and private parties.<br/><br/>\n\n•<em> 20 West 29th St, </em><a href=\"https://www.acehotel.com/newyork\" title=\"\"><em>acehotel.com</em></a>\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/cities/2011/5/2/1304333697821/The-Lobby-Bar-at-the-Ace--001.jpgMike Vilenskyhttp://nymag.com/author/mike%20vilenskyhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-manhattan-bars\n\n256\n\nNew YorkNightlifeManhattanThe Jane Ballroom http://www.thejanenyc.com40.738148-74.003017The door at this spacious, old-fashioned bar and ballroom is notoriously tight, but the scene inside – a mix of hip celebrities, young travellers, and party-hunting locals – is sometimes worth the challenge. Located in a surprisingly reasonably-priced hotel (sometimes described as a youth hostel), the boite looks like a glamorous, cruise ship ballroom after decades of wear and tear, equipped with an enormous fireplace, leather couches, an indoor balcony, and towering window velvet drapes. The parties range from decidedly quiet evenings to debaucherous concert after-parties. Wines by the glass come for $12 at the darkwood bar, which is hidden from the rest of the ballroom in case you need a breather from flirting and dancing.<br/><br/>\n\n<em>• 13 Jane Street, </em><a href=\"http://www.thejanenyc.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thejanenyc.com</em></a>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/cities/2011/5/2/1304333896929/The-Jane-Ballroom-NYC-001.jpgMike Vilenskyhttp://nymag.com/author/mike%20vilenskyhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-manhattan-bars\n\n257\n\nNew YorkNightlifeManhattanBedlamhttp://bedlamnyc.com/BEDLAMNYC/Home.html40.721828-73.980317This mixed-crowd East Village newbie offers a gay singles scene, welcome for their straight friends of both genders, and a surplus of taxidermy animals. Aiming at a spooky-yet-sexy feel, the cavernous bar, with book-themed wallpapers, includes a giant moose head, warthog, black bear, and stuffed birds among its decorative flourishes. To ease your nerves, try the Lily Bart, a cucumber vodka and lambic concoction named for the Edith Wharton character, or go with a $6 beer. On busy nights, be prepared to literally rub elbows: the space is tight, with local DJs urging patrons off the velvet red couches.<br/><br/>\n\n•<em> 40 Avenue C, </em><a href=\"http://bedlamnyc.com/BEDLAMNYC/Home.html\" title=\"\"><em>bedlamnyc.com</em></a>http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/cities/2011/5/2/1304333841640/Bedlam-bar-NYC-001.jpgMike Vilenskyhttp://nymag.com/author/mike%20vilenskyhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-manhattan-bars\n\n258\n\nNew YorkNightlifeManhattanThe Oak Roomhttp://www.oakroomny.com/]40"
