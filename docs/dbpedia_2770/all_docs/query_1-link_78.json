        "text": "The present City of New York, consisting of five boroughs, came into existence on January 1, 1898.\n\nThis article focuses on what the five-borough city replaced. This is important because the consolidation of 1898 (and others which preceded it) wiped off the map many jurisdictions which genealogists are going to encounter in their research.\n\nModern maps may not show these old cities, towns, or villages, so it is often difficult for genealogists to understand the place names they encounter in census, land, vital and other records before 1898.\n\nAfter the English seized the City of New Amsterdam in 1664 and renamed it New York, they extended its boundaries to include all of Manhattan Island. In 1683, when the Province of New York was first divided into counties, the City of New York also became New York County.\n\nThe original city was a tiny area at the island's southern tip, the rest of Manhattan consisting of scattered farms and rural villages. Slowly the urbanized area spread northward. In 1874, to accommodate this growth, New York City and County annexed from Westchester County what is now the western Bronx. Meanwhile, the village of Brooklyn became a city and eventually expanded to cover all of Kings County.\n\nIn 1894 a vote was taken in New York, Westchester, Kings, Queens and Richmond counties on a proposal to combine New York City with Brooklyn, the eastern Bronx, part of Queens County, and all of Richmond County, to form the second largest city in the world (after London). There was a large majority for the proposal, but only because of the vote in New York County. Only 50.1% of Kings County voters were in favor, and some towns, such as Flushing in Queens County, were solidly opposed.\n\nNevertheless, the overall majority ruled, and consolidation went ahead. In 1895 New York City annexed the eastern Bronx. On January 1, 1898, the City of Brooklyn, Long Island City, and the towns and villages of western Queens and all of Richmond were replaced by the Boroughs of Brooklyn (Kings County), Queens (Queens County), and Richmond (Richmond County). With the Boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx (New York County) they formed a new City of New York, briefly called \"Greater New York.\"\n\nSince 1898 there have been two important changes.\n\nIn 1914, The Bronx became a separate county of the same name.\n\nIn 1975, the Borough of Richmond was renamed the Borough of Staten Island, though remaining Richmond County.\n\nSources dated after January 1, 1898 may carry either the borough or county name, or both. In general, records generated by a city agency (such as the Department of Health) use the borough name, while those created by agencies of the state (such as the Surrogate's Court) use the county name, but this usage may not be consistent. Genealogists should be familiar with both sets of names.\n\nPrior to 1898, the City of Brooklyn maintained records very similar to those of its sister city of New York, including vital records as early as 1848. When Long Island City was created in 1870 it also began to keep vital records. The towns of Kings, Queens, Richmond and Westchester (later Bronx) counties kept records similar to those maintained by towns in the rest of the state, including vital records in 1847-49 and beginning again in 1881. Within the towns, incorporated villages sometimes kept their own vital records after 1881 (the town/village of Morrisania kept some vital records at least as early as 1872).\n\nThe Municipal Archives of the City of New York, 31 Chambers Street, Manhattan, holds many surviving records of the old cities, towns and villages. See the description of the Archives' holdings at the Archives website, and in Genealogical Resources in New York, ed. Estelle M. Guzik (New York: Jewish Genealogical Society, 2003), pp. 113-124, especially the lists of vital records and descriptions of the Richmond County Clerk's and Town Records. See also Kings County Records from the St. Francis College Collection, Now at the Municipal Archives.\n\nTo understand the maps that follow, keep in mind that in New York State, counties are made up of towns and cities. Towns in turn consist of villages, which may be incorporated (and thus have some records of their own), or unincorporated (in which case their affairs are covered by the town records).\n\nThe Bronx\n\nKings County (Brooklyn)\n\nQueens\n\nRichmond County (Staten Island)\n\nby Harry Macy Jr., FASG, FGBS\n\nOriginally published in The NYG&B Newsletter, Winter 1998\n\nUpdated June 2011\n\nÂ© 2011 The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society\n\nAll rights reserved."
