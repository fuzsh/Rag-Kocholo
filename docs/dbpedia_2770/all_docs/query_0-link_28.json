        "text": "This paper explores both the reasons for and the methods by which the East Village avant-garde first came into being. Much of the movement’s original impetus and sense of moral purpose had roots in the pre-war persecution of the European avant-garde and Expressionist traditions under the authoritarian ideologies of the German and Soviet totalitarian regimes. American critics and writers, among them the critic Clement Greenberg in 1939 and Paul Goodman in 1951, saw worrying echoes of that ideological schism between autonomy and conformity closer to home, in the rigid social conservatism of the post-war America. They advocated arts production as a counterbalance to that conservatism and as a means of influencing the hegemony. An initially small counter-community came together in Manhattan’s traditionally impoverished Lower East Side, and began reutilising that area’s neglected urban space to suit its own specific arts-oriented ambitions. The resulting art became a means of solidifying this nascent counter-culture and creating a sustainable and protective artistic environment. In this paper, I will focus on the relationship between this fledgling counterculture and its mainstream host, establishing a lasting pattern of creation and consumption extending beyond the confines of the neighbourhood (indeed, beyond the confines of art itself). This symbiotic relationship was fuelled by the ambitions of the artists and writers on one side of the divide, and by the curiosity of the public on the other. Central too, were the more mainstream sponsors – the curators, art collectors, publishers, and journalists who mediated between the two groups – this lifestyle contextualization would prove to be a very effective marketing device. The result was a wider and active engagement, though not always an easy one, between the margins and the mainstream.\n\nUrban ethnographers must understand that while we look at things using close-up lenses, most policy-makers, on the other hand, employ wide-angle lens to describe what is going on at that very same street level. In this essay the authors attempt to provide a contrast between those views in the context of the radically changed public perception of the New York City Borough of Brooklyn. When the authors began their sociological research (and social activism) in the late Twentieth Century, the neighborhoods in which they were active suffered from the spread of middle-class (white) flight and urban blight. Today, in the first two decades of the Twenty-first, the fortunes of these same areas have been reversed, but longer-term residents face new 'problems' in the form of gentrification and displacement. It is suggested here that a view from the street can provide a better sociological understanding of the bigger picture. Brooklyn's Image Then and Now The image of Brooklyn as a whole, as well as its most well-known individual neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush, and Coney Island, has always been a powerful independent force in creating and maintaining its concrete reality. Forty years ago these place names were stigmatized. Today, in 2015, Brooklyn and these areas are by all accounts in the popular media decidedly 'in' places. The Borough of Brooklyn currently occupies an elevated status as a gem in the crown of New York City as a Global City, and it is fast becoming a popular tourist destination in its own right. By almost every measure the 'Borough of churches' has moved far beyond 'renaissance' and 'revival' to enjoy a hard-earned, successfully promoted, chic and hip image that is presented to the rest of the world. As opposed to the 'bad old days' in the 1960s and 1970s the major challenges likely to confront local community and political leaders in the Twenty-first Century arise from such 'problems' as the rising cost of housing resulting from upscale gentrification by which investors compete for any available development space. A few decades ago the problems were exactly the opposite. No one at that time could have ever imagined a hip travel guide, Lonely Planet, would name Brooklyn as one of the top world destinations for 2007 (Kuntzman 2007). In 2015 the travel guide giant Fodor's advertised the first guidebook devoted only to the borough with this as its teaser: Brooklyn is the most talked about, trendsetting destination in the world. Fodor's Brooklyn, the first comprehensive guidebook to New York City's most exciting borough, is unlike any we've ever published. Written and illustrated by locals, it's infused with authentic Brooklyn flavor throughout—making it the go-to guide for locals and visitors alike.\n\nUrban ethnographers must understand that while we look at things using close-up lenses, most policy-makers, on the other hand, employ wide-angle lens to describe what is going on at that very same street level. In this chapter, the authors attempt to provide a contrast between those views in the context of the radically changed public perception of the New York City Borough of Brooklyn. When the authors began their sociological research (and social activism) in the late twentieth century, the neighborhoods in which they were active suffered from the spread of middle-class (white) flight and urban blight.
