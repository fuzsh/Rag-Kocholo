        "text": "175 Fifth Avenue | The Flatiron Building\n\nThe Fuller Building (known as the Flatiron building) is an landmark office tower containing offices for small and medium sized companies in the Midtown South district of Manhattan. (edited 2022)\n\n175 Fifth the Flatiron Building once known as the Fuller Building stands today as an Manhattan icon / landmark mostly seen and displayed in various forms of art ranging from photography to paintings.\n\nThis building’s unusual shape carries over internally as the property is known for its unorthodox layout – with oddly shaped offices and walls that flow at a slant emphasizing and meeting at this property’s “prow”. In the past these office units were the most desired with windows at the cowcatcher that offer panoramic views northwards. It’s been said that the interior office units do not accommodate modern office furniture well or allow for easy collaboration between staff members. Moreover the gender specific restrooms stand on alternating floors, and aren’t very nice – except for the one on the 18th floor – which offers views all the way to New Jersey.\n\nThis landmark stands at the junction of 23rd Street, Broadway, and Fifth Avenue – making it the only building that meets at three major thoroughfares in Manhattan.\n\nFeatures such as the narrow depth of the property do lend well to an abundance of light coming in from numerous big windows throughout the building. Common areas such as the stairwell and elevators take up an odd amount of square footage. This then causes loss factor – which has been stated to grant a tenant around 70% of the actual floor plate.\n\nWith change in the wind renting office space in The Flatiron Building will be an option for the foreseeable future. Seen in the past as a dream location today despite its quirky layout and old classic New York charm the building will be available for office space leasing as the Sorgente Group changed their plans. Now businesses can look for commercial space that is available in the commercial office market.\n\nBecause of this and other factors office availabilities & prices aren’t shown for this property; the building now is exclusively leased by MacMillan Publishers.\n\nFor more information on office spaces in, near, and around 175 Fifth, contact us and one of our brokers can provide you with all the data needed including price, floor plans, photos, and insight into the area and those comparable options.\n\nWhat this Office Building can Offer You:\n\nLandmark Building\n\nCorner Property (large windows on all three sides)\n\nJust steps from Madison Square Park and proximity to the N, R and 6 Trains\n\nFloors: 22 Stories / 285 Ft.
