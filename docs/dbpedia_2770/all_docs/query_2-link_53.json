        "text": "Stand at the lot line on the east side of Fifth Avenue opposite the Empire State Building and look downtown, and you won’t be able to discern any world-famous landmarks.\n\nBut as you cross Fifth on 34th Street heading west, the distinctive prow of the Flatiron Building sails majestically into sight. And by the time you are standing at the base of the Empire State, you have a gorgeous unobstructed view downtown of the Flatiron, thanks to the 1902 landmark’s prominent location at the crossroads of Broadway and Fifth on 23rd Street.\n\nThis is an urban magic trick that Miriam Berman, a preservationist and author of the book “Madison Square: The Park and Its Celebrated Landmarks,” likes to share with people she’s showing around.\n\nAgainst all odds, as Ms. Berman has publicly observed — both as a professional tour guide and before the city landmarks commission — these two renowned city landmarks have enjoyed an unbroken visual dialogue up and down Fifth ever since the Empire State Building was completed in 1931. The view uptown from east of the Flatiron offers an equally clear vista of the Empire State Building in all its muscular, cloud-scraping glory."
