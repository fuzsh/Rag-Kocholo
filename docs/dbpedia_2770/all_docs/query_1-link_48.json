        "text": "Construction has surpassed the halfway mark on 520 Fifth Avenue, an 88-story residential supertall skyscraper in Midtown, Manhattan. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and developed by Rabina, the 1,000-foot-tall structure will span 415,000 square feet and yield 100 condominium units, a residents-only amenity floor on level 88, boutique office floors, a private members only club called Moss, and four cellar levels. The project is located at the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and West 43rd Street, one block north of Bryant Park.\n\nMore than a dozen floors were formed since our last update in mid-March, when the reinforced concrete superstructure had just begun to climb above one of the time-consuming mechanical levels. Recent photographs show the tower gaining prominence over Midtown and its tiered massing becoming more apparent with each shallow setback. The terracotta, glass and aluminum façade and grid of arched floor-to-ceiling windows have also made substantial progress and now enclose nearly half of the superstructure. Based on the pace of progress, the building could top out before the end of the year.\n\nThe renderings in the main photo and below preview the completed look and scale of 520 Fifth Avenue from several street-level and aerial perspectives, including through the trees of Bryant Park, from West 43rd Street, and looking directly at the multifaceted crown and upper setbacks with views of Central Park in the background.\n\n520 Fifth Avenue’s condominium units will start on the 42nd floor and come in one- to four-bedroom layouts. Homes will feature ceiling heights between 10 to 14 feet tall and white oak wide-plank floors. Kitchens will come with brand-name appliances, ribbed walnut islands, white lacquer cabinetry and luminous quartzite slab countertops and backsplashes. Baths include custom vanities with marble countertops, herringbone marble flooring, and polished nickel fixtures by Waterworks. The penthouse residences will offer full-floor layouts with 360-degree views of the city.\n\nThe 24-hour attended lobby will feature custom arched mosaic flooring with reeded walnut walls, and the 88th-floor amenity space will include a glass-walled solarium, a lounge, a dining room, library, and a game room.\n\nThe nearest subways from the development are the B, D, F, M, and 7 trains at the 42nd Street-Bryant Park/Fifth Avenue station. The property is also in close proximity to the Grand Central-42nd Street station, served by the 4, 5, 6, 7, and Shuttle trains, as well as Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road trains at Grand Central Terminal and Grand Central Madison.\n\nSales launched in April for homes with prices starting at $1.7 million.\n\n520 Fifth Avenue’s completion date is posted on the construction board for June 1, 2026."
