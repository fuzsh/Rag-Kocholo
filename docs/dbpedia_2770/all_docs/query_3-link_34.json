        "text": "If you’re visiting the Big Apple with the intention of doing some shopping in New York City, you’re in the right place. My name is Antonina and I’m a NYC local. I’m also the founder of New York Dearest, a website where locals share firsthand experiences from NYC.\n\nLongtime readers of this website know that I’m not one for small talk, so, allow me to share my personal list of the best shopping in NYC.\n\nShopping in NYC (Meet the Author) | Antonina P. moved to New York City from the Pacific Northwest. She doesn’t miss the rain as much as she though she would. You can follow her weekly updates here.\n\nVisiting New York City? If you haven’t decided where to stay (yet) check out our helpful guide on Where to Stay in New York City (The 10 Best Neighborhoods for First Timers & 3 to Avoid). Don’t have time? Here’s my favorite hotel in NYC, hands down.\n\nThe Sales Tax for Shopping in NYC\n\nBefore we start, it’s prudent to go over sales taxes so you’re not caught by surprise while shopping in New York (this is especially true for international visitors).\n\nNew York City shoppers are subject to three taxes:\n\ncity sales tax (4.5%)\n\nstate sales tax (4%)\n\ncommuter sales tax (0.375%)\n\nAll told, the total sales tax for shopping in New York City clocks in at 8.875%.\n\nHowever, clothing and footwear under $110 are exempt from city and state sales tax. Don’t let it confuse you, here’s how it works: if you buy a shirt for $80 and a purse for $200, you won’t be taxed for the shirt (because it’s less than $110), but you will be charged a sales tax of 8.875% for the purse.\n\nThe Best Shopping Areas in New York City\n\n(Table of Contents)\n\nVisiting New York City? If you haven’t decided where to stay (yet) check out our helpful guide on Where to Stay in New York City (The 10 Best Neighborhoods & 3 to Avoid). Don’t have time? Here’s our favorite hotel in NYC, hands down.\n\nSoHo (South of Houston Street)\n\nThe cobble-stone streets and cast-iron buildings of SoHo are home to some of the best shopping in New York City, but that wasn’t always the case. Back in the day, this area was covered by factories and warehouses, which have since been converted into expensive condos equipped with storefronts at the ground level.\n\nYou’ll find quite the mishmash of high-end luxury designers, big department stores and unique boutiques crammed together from one block to the next. The entire shopping area spans 25 blocks, and if size alone is any indication, you can bet you’ll find anything you need.\n\nMy favorite thing about shopping in SoHo is that there’s never a shortage of great cafes and restaurants to pop into if you need to decompress. I’m a huge fan of Balthazar, one of the best bakeries in New York City.\n\nLocal’s Tip: The crowds get very intense on the weekends, try visiting SoHo during a weekday morning, if your schedule allows.\n\nSoHo Stores To Visit:\n\nThe MoMa Design Store: Offering a great selection of fascinating items ranging from small trinkets to full scale furniture, there’s always something interesting to discover. The MoMa Design Store is considered one of the best stores in New York City for art lovers.\n\nCatbird Jewelry: A local jewelry shop specializing in delicate gold jewelry and beautiful charms. The charms are a great souvenir idea!\n\nBloomingdale’s: An established department store, Bloomingdale’s is great for luxury goods and affordable brands. The Bloomingdales located in SoHo is full of great finds, but the real gem is the fact that they have a public restroom (which is almost unheard of, so take advantage).\n\nYou May Enjoy Reading: 30 Spree-Worth Stores in SoHo (Helpful Guide)\n\nLuxury NYC Shopping on Fifth Avenue\n\nIf budget isn’t a concern (way to go, you!) look no further than Fifth Avenue for the ultimate NYC shopping experience. Fifth Avenue is not only the most popular shopping area in New York City, but it’s also one of the most popular (and expensive) shopping districts in the world.\n\nThis massive shopping district is marked by luxury brands competing for attention by way of stunning window displays. It’s often said that New York is not for the timid, nowhere is this more evident than Fifth Avenue. This Avenue is a place for the loudest, riskiest and boldest stores in NYC.\n\nInteresting Fifth Avenue Stores To Know About:\n\nUniqlo: Uniqlo hails from Japan and is the 4th largest retailer in the world. A great place to stock up on basics (t shirts, pants, etc) the store spans 89,000 square feet, the retailer’s largest location worldwide. If you’re shopping in New York City on a budget, this is a great place to visit.\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue: This 10-story luxury department store neighbors the breathtaking St. Patrick’s Cathedral (one of the most beautiful churches in NYC). The store has been meeting the needs of shopping New Yorkers since 1924 and doesn’t show signs of slowing anytime soon.\n\nTiffany & Co.: If you love the movie Breakfast at Tiffany’s, make a beeline for Tiffany & Co on Fifth Avenue. This was the store featured in the film!\n\nThe Apple Store: Open 24 hours, the Apple Store located at Fifth Avenue is one of the most iconic stores in New York City. Largely thanks to an intriguing glass cube that serves as an invitation to head below ground and see what all the fuss is about. Covering 77,000 square feet, this location employs 300 people and has the largest staff of any Apple Store in the world.\n\nThe Lego Store: One of the best stores in NYC for kids, the Lego Store on Fifth Avenue covers two floors and has various fascinating NYC-themed Lego constructions (great for souvenirs!).\n\nNike Store: With an (official) name like House of Innovation 000, you better believe the Nike Store on Fifth Avenue is something special. Opened in 2018, the Nike flagship store spans 68,000 feet and covers six stories. If you’re looking for unique shopping in New York City, this immersive store is worth a visit.\n\nMadison Avenue\n\nLocated just one block from Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue is one of the best shopping areas on the Upper East Side in NYC for luxury goods. Much like Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue is home to some of the most expensive stores in the world (like a mattress store that sells mattresses priced at $250K+).\n\nHere’s some stores to check out in the area:\n\nRalph Lauren: Located in a renovated mansion, the store is a sight for sore eyes. Then, make your way to the equally charming Ralph Lauren Cafe for an afternoon pick-me-up.\n\nBloomingdale’s Flagship Store: The original Bloomingdale’s store is only two blocks east of Madison Avenue. The perk of Bloomingdale’s is getting to walk around with the most iconic shopping bag in NYC: the little brown bag!\n\nNolita\n\nRiding on the coattails of SoHo, Nolita (North of Little Italy) offers some of the trendiest shopping in Manhattan. The colorful streets of this charming neighborhood are full of local shops and cute boutiques.\n\nIt’s easy to mix this region with Soho since the two neighborhoods blend into each other, rest assured – both are great shopping areas in their own rights. Here’s a few stores to check out:\n\nL’Appartement Sézane: Sézane is a French brand that needs no introduction. It has amassed a cult-like following with its chic seasonal clothing line and decided to launch a brick-and-mortar store in Manhattan.\n\nJohn Fluevog: John Fluevog is a Canadian shoe brand best known for creating some of the most unique shoes you will ever see in your life. The designs are colorful and loud and the quality is hard to beat, pop in to see these interesting designs for yourself.\n\nLove, Adorned: If you’re jewelry shopping in New York City, swing by Love, Adorned, a charming boutique selling vintage and designer jewelry in a perfectly-curated light-soaked shop.\n\nEverlane: The Everlane brand has grown like wildfire and their store in Manhattan is one of the first brick-and-mortar locations, worth a visit alone. You can stock up on quality basic pieces without breaking the bank.\n\nBleecker Street (in the The West Village)\n\nBleecker Street is home to some of the most interesting boutique stores in New York City. You’ll find vintage stores, bookshops, cafes, pop up stores and a few big names. Make sure to visit the flagship Magnolia Bakery while you’re exploring this popular NYC shopping area.\n\nStores to check out on Bleecker Street:\n\nAnnie Bing: This brand is created by a Danish model who caught the world by storm when she opened her store in Manhattan in 2015. The store sells casual pieces that exude a relaxed vibe with prices on the higher side. But listen, with so many celebrities wearing these items, the quality speaks for itself.\n\nLove Shack Fancy: If you love beautiful vintage-inspired clothing, you need to visit Love Shack Fancy . There’s so many playful patterns and pieces in this store you can easily spend an hour exploring!\n\nIl Bisonte: Founded in 1970 in Tuscany, Il Bisonte creates timeless high-quality leather goods for everyday use using sustainable methods. You’ll find everything from beautiful bags to furniture. All items are handcrafted and made in Italy, and the prices are reasonable for the unmatched quality. Il Bisonte is one of my favorite stores in New York City.\n\nFurther Reading: 17+ Exciting Things to Do in the Charming West Village\n\nHerald Square\n\nHerald Square is a popular area to go shopping in New York City and the crowds prove it.

Their Christmas window displays are legendary and the Santaland event is what dreams are made of. This is one of the most iconic stores in Manhattan, visiting is a must!\n\nThe largest H&M store in the world\n\nLocals love shopping at affordable stores in NYC and H&M is the perfect testament to this fact. H&M opened its largest store in the world at Herald Square (63,000 square feet), I was half-expecting to get a map upon entering. The irony is that there’s two other massive H&M locations just steps away.\n\nSephora\n\nIf you love makeup, you won’t want to miss an opportunity to visit one of the largest Sephora stores in the world.

It’s full of interesting and unique home decor items that spam the gamut. You’ll find everything from furniture to candle holders, the only thing this store can’t guarantee is self control.\n\nStrand Bookstore: Founded in 1927, the Strand is the only remaining bookstore from “Book Row” which was a coalition of 48 bookstores that lined Fourth Avenue. Every single bookstore, with the exception of the Strand, closed during the Great Depression. Today this large NYC bookstore is home to 2.5 million books and serves as a safe-haven for insatiable bookworms far and wide.\n\nMeatpacking District/Chelsea\n\nIf you’re shopping in New York City with your sights set on high-end designer cloths, head straight over to the trendy Meatpacking District.\n\nThe Meatpacking District has a great vibe. The area used to be chock-full of industrial warehouses that have since been converted as new life was breathed into the neighborhood. You’ll find some of the most expensive stores in this New York City shopping area.\n\nFrom Hermes, Restoration Hardware and Christian Louboutin to more affordable stores like LuluLemon and Madewell.\n\nEast Village (For Vintage Shopping)\n\nThe East Village has developed a reputation as a bohemian safe haven. Nowhere is this more evident than in the disproportionate amount of great vintage stores in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen it comes to the best vintage shops, clear standouts are, Cloak & Dagger, L Train Vintage, East Village Vintage Collective and Cobblestones. Whatever you do, make sure to stroll down St. Marks Place while visiting the area, it’s great fun!\n\nFurther Reading: 15 Iconic East Village Activities\n\nThe Mall at Hudson Yards\n\nThe Shops at Hudson Yards is an impressive mall that spans 720,000 square feet.
