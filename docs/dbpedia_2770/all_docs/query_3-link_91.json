        "text": "55 Fifth Avenue is home to a variety of businesses and organizations. The office tower portion of the building begins on the 12th floor ascending through the 18th floor with stair access to the penthouse.\n\nThese upper floors are serviced by three elevators and a private lobby mid-block on Fifth Avenue between 12th and 13th streets.\n\nDowntown and Midtown collide in Midtown South.\n\nWith the accessibility of Midtown and the culture and vibrance of downtown’s neighborhoods and nightlife, it is no wonder that Midtown South is the most sought after office market in the nation.\n\nAccess to the A-C-E, 1-2-3, 4-5-6, N-Q-R, PATH and L trains makes for one of the easiest commutes in the city.\n\nUnion Square is the vibrant overlap point of NYC’s East Village, Greenwich Village, Flatiron District, and Gramercy neighborhoods – just a few blocks away from NoMad, Chelsea, Kips Bay, and Alphabet City.\n\nUnion Square Park is the home of the Green Market Farmer’s Market (open Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday) where you’ll find 740 regional farmers, fishers, and bakers selling their goods, rain or shine.\n\nThe park and its surrounding neighborhood is home to Kirk Brown’s famous equestrian statue of George Washington, the Strand Bookstore, Webster Hall, and Irving Plaza."
