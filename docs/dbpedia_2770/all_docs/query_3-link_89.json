        "text": "Spend A Day In\n\nNomad\n\nNoMad got its name from its location, just north of Madison Square Park, which was once a military parade ground. In fact, to this day, the park still serves as the starting point for the city’s annual veteran’s day parade.\n\nNoMad is a vibrant urban center. Certainly, one of the hottest neighborhoods in Manhattan, and 236 Fifth Avenue overlooks it all!\n\nJust around the corner from 236 Fifth is Pondicheri a casual restaurant and bakery that got its start in Houston. Located at 15 West 27th Street, the menu at this Indian-inspired eatery boasts such delights as saag paneer and lamb keema. And for breakfast (yes, breakfast) you can enjoy masala eggs or turmeric soup. Also, the “Slumdog” sandwich features a chickpea hot dog!\n\nFor a taste of old New York, take a walk around the block to Gilsey House, NYC, located at 1200 Broadway. Its grand architecture is a perfect example of the French Second Empire style. Initially built for Peter Gilsey, a Danish merchant and city alderman, it opened as a hotel in 1872. Its 300 luxurious rooms were furnished in the latest trappings of luxury for the time. So, it attracted such luminaries as Mark Twain, Diamond Jim Brady, and Oscar Wilde. The building attained landmark status in 1979, and today it houses modern luxury co-op apartments."
