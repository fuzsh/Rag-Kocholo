        "text": "BAY RIDGE — Thousands lined the streets with one objective: to have Fun on Fifth.\n\nJudging from the countless smiling faces along the avenue, the festival was a smashing success. Fifth Avenue from 69th to 85th streets included plenty of food, rides, shopping and games on Sunday, June 2.\n\nMusic was also a significant part of the festivities, with live performances by Uncle Jack, Sha-Doobie, Out of the Blue, Colonial Road, Mike McLaughlin, Sal Arnuk, Bobby Tambo and Fast Forward.\n\nThe festival took place from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Bay Ridge Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District (BID), led by Executive Director Elizabeth Lovejoy, sponsored the event.\n\n“We are thrilled to host the 30th Annual Fifth Avenue festival, which is a milestone,” Lovejoy said. “We’ve introduced exciting, new additions such as pony rides and expanded activities for children. Our aim across all our events is to create a fun, family-friendly atmosphere while driving significant foot traffic to support the success of merchants and vendors.”\n\nLovejoy has been in the BID since 2017 and executive director since August 2023.\n\n“What’s so appealing about Bay Ridge and Fifth Avenue especially is its diversity,” she said. “It’s a small town in a big city. Everyone knows each other, and that’s why Bay Ridge is so special.”\n\nAccording to Lovejoy, her greatest accomplishments thus far are obtaining a $75,000 grant from the NYC Department of Small Business Services and the Fun on Fifth festival.\n\nFormer State Sen. Marty Golden was among the festival’s spectators.\n\n“It’s events like these that mean a whole lot to the community,” Golden said. “Having people get out and enjoy themselves, getting to know their neighbors and the small businesses in the area — it’s about getting people engaged.”\n\n46th District assembly member Alec Brook-Krasny referred to the festival as “an incredible tradition that started 30 years ago.”\n\n“I’ve been here practically every year, and I so enjoy it,” Brook-Krasny said. “I certainly hope it will go on for another 100 years. It’s about having fun, eating great food and enjoying it with your friends and families.”\n\nRichie Barsamian, chairman of the Kings County Republican Party, said the festival is “another example of why Brooklyn is the capital of the world and Bay Ridge is the heart of that capital.”\n\n“Here I am on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by thousands of people,” Barsamian said. “You feel the spirit of New Yorkers here — the electricity of being a Brooklynite. You are surrounded by pretty much every group from every corner of the world. All of us together are proving that what unites us is so much stronger than anything that could ever divide us.”\n\nThe Bay Ridge Fifth Avenue BID is a non-profit organization serving Fifth Avenue between 65th and 85th streets. Fifth Avenue is a hub for over 300 locally owned businesses."
