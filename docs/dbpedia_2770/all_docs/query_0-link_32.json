When we ran out of new last stops on the various lines, we did the second, then third to last, and so on, always traveling to a new place. In this way, I learned to love and appreciate the city, one that I like to call “the world’s greatest outdoor museum.” I also developed a very close bond with my father, who gave me the greatest present a kid can have—the gift of time. The island of Manhattan is a world-famous place. When people say, “I’ve visited New York City,” 90 percent of the time they are referring to the best-known of the city’s boroughs. And by a similar margin, they have spent most of their time exploring and experiencing this island’s major attractions and sites. Almost always, they’ve taken in a Broadway show. They’ve walked down Fifth Avenue and strolled through Lord & Taylor, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Henri Bendel. In the Financial District, they toured the New York Stock Exchange. They rode to the top of the Empire State Building and viewed the gigantic Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, where they might also have seen a show put on by the Rockettes. And if they’ve seen other parts of Manhattan, they’ve usually done so by bus or a boat trip around the island. For food, they might have tried a Sabrett hot dog or a halal chicken and rice dish, both sold by street vendors; or an overstuffed pastrami sandwich at the Stage Door Deli in Midtown or Katz’s Deli on the Lower East Side, popping into Russ & Daughters as well while they’re in the neighborhood. They may also have indulged in lox, sable, or herring at Zabar’s on the Upper West Side. For upscale dining, perhaps they MY LOVE FOR WALKING THE CITY\n\nix\n\nvisited one of the many options—“21” Club, Bouley, Jean-Georges, Sparks Steak House, Daniel, Le Bernardin, and Il Mulino. There’s nothing wrong with a trip like that. After all, this is what has made the Big Apple so special. And when they return home, tourists want to tell their friends and family that they saw the sights that everyone has heard of and knows about. But is this all that’s worth seeing? What is there for those who want to explore the rest of Manhattan? For people who want to combine seeing the wellknown with the unknown? Or for those who’ve seen the regular sights several times but want to see the city from a completely new perspective? That’s why I have written this book—to reveal Manhattan in all its beauty, complexity, and mystery; to demonstrate to visitors that it has so much to offer beyond its most famous locations. This is true of every one of its many neighborhoods, from the northernmost to the southernmost areas, and from east to west across the island. Some of the points made here are true, in varying degrees, of other cities too, while other points are unique. Take Marble Hill, for instance. To walk through its quaint curved streets and take in its many private, wood-framed homes with peaks or cupolas, is to get a firsthand view of what Manhattan looked like in the nineteenth century. It’s the borough’s northernmost section and seems so far away from the noise and high-octane activity that people think of when Manhattan is mentioned. Since the community is not on Manhattan Island itself, it’s logical to think it should be part of the Bronx. But that’s not the case, due to some very interesting historical and geographical changes. Washington Heights is a hilly neighborhood consisting almost exclusively of apartment buildings constructed on rocky terrain, some of it exposed for six stories clearly visible to the naked eye. Here, I learn about former secretary of state Henry Kissinger’s teenage home, and in the area around Jumel Terrace, I discover old wooden houses in their more or less original incarnation. I’m also saddened to learn that the site of Malcolm X’s assassination, the x\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAudubon Ballroom, is not being cared for in the way it should be. This reminds me that I was waiting for a bus outside the ballroom at exactly the time it occurred. (Later in this book, I share the details of what I saw that day.) Morningside Heights has two neighborhood institutions with great food—V & T Pizzeria and the Hungarian Pastry Shop. Frank Vela, one of V & T’s owners, has a fascinating tale about his life as an immigrant in the 1940s and his experiences with Giovanni Buitoni, the famous spaghetti manufacturer. The point is that all of these communities have their own minihistories, with stories and places that will entice and delight explorers of the island. But this is equally true of the Manhattan people come to see, its central core, which visitors feel certain they know. I myself wondered if there was anything new I could say about the betterknown places. After all, this town offers many tours of all varieties (food tours, literary tours, etc.) and Manhattan is only twenty-two square miles. Moreover, as the sociologist and tour guide Jonathan Wynn points out in his wonderful book, The Tour Guide, Manhattan guides are very adept at pointing out the “odds and ends of urban life.”1 As it turned out, discovering new odds and ends wasn’t so hard. Midtown Manhattan, for example, which includes many famous places, like Carnegie Hall, the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings, Times Square, the New York Public Library, and the Theater District, has lots of other places worth seeing. Take the Alwyn Court, an elegant apartment building. Even the majority of New Yorkers have never noticed or even seen it. Nearly every inch of its exterior is encrusted with fire-breathing salamanders, flowers, urns, statues, dragons. No description of this building, either inside or out, can do it justice. It must be seen to be appreciated. There’s also a building on W. 58th Street that, when viewed a certain way, gives the distinct impression that half of it is falling down. The Diamond District on 47th Street is a familiar place for visitors, but it’s the conversation with a businesswoman there that provides insight into its inner workings. INTRODUCTION\n\nxi\n\nGreenwich Village is often thought of as a center for entertainment. Every evening as well as all day on weekends, MacDougal and 3rd Streets are filled with throngs of people looking for a good time. But the Village also has a darker, lurid side. How many people know the story of 18 W. 11th Street, where five Weathermen terrorists built a bomb factory in the basement? Three were killed in an explosion there, leaving only two Weathermen to face the music for what they had plotted to do. And what about the “House of Death,” at 14 W. 10th Street, where attorney Joel Steinberg beat his six-year-old daughter to death in one of the city’s most notorious murder cases? And that’s not the only reason for this townhouse’s name. Shortly after telling of the ghosts she saw there, a resident, Jan Bryant Bartell, died under mysterious circumstances. She and several others swore they had seen Mark Twain wandering the premises attired in a white suit. The neighborhood is also home to the Central Bar, where Irish and British expats hoot, holler, and curse as they watch home soccer games on “the telly.” For chess set collectors and players, the Chess Forum on Thompson Street is a must. To me, it was special because as a college student I had the honor of losing to Bobby Fischer, an anecdote recounted in this book. Every neighborhood has its special location that, over time, becomes embedded in the collective memory of those who have been there. At “Rock” Plaza it’s the Christmas tree, and Bleecker Street is where it’s at in the Village. And in the Wall Street area it’s the bull sculpture on Broadway, while in Times Square, the bright-red glass stairs at the TKTS booth on 47th Street is a major attraction. People often need an image to capture what they’ve experienced, but there’s much more to these neighborhoods. To truly understand the history of the Financial District it’s necessary to connect with the people who live and work there. One of them would be Paul Quinn, the owner of Jim Brady’s saloon and restaurant over at 75 Maiden Lane. He’ll tell you how they moved the bar of the world-famous Stork Club, now defunct, to his premises. But more than that, this xii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ninsightful raconteur will explain what the area was like before and after 9/11; how deserted it became and how and, even more importantly, why thousands of young families now live here. All this is just a tiny sampling of what this book presents. But it isn’t limited to a description of the relatively unknown bricks and mortar of the city’s jewels and treasures, fascinating as they may be. A city cannot be understood purely in terms of its colorful history or fascinating architecture. Its heart and soul are the people who inhabit it. They are literally the repository of its essence, and this book presents the most interesting conversations I was fortunate enough to have had with some of the hundreds of people I met in my journey through its many streets. What they say is what makes the city come alive to the reader. In Inwood, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan, I meet Sabas, an eighty-two-year-old man who lives in a cave. Most people would think of him as a homeless man, but he really isn’t. The cave is his home, and by choice. I say to him: “Well, you have a million-dollar view of the forest from here.” His answer is exquisite: “I do. I do. I see the leaves falling. I see them come down like ballet dancers. Each one is turning and twisting and bending, caressing the air. It’s a loving situation. And no two fall in the same way, so I’m overwhelmed. I’m overwhelmed.” I ask if I can give him anything. His response says it all: “Why would you have to give me anything? I have everything I need. And I have my Korean War veteran’s pension. It’s not much, but it’s enough. The creator takes care of me because I obey his natural laws.” In Washington Heights, I meet Theo, a young Greek American, who owns Jumbo Pizza and Coffee Shop. This place lives up to its name, serving up the largest slices of pizza I’ve ever seen. He’s following in his father’s path, one that epitomizes the ambition of immigrants in this city. Nearby, the journey takes place in reverse. The Brotherhood/Sister Sol at 143rd Street takes Harlem kids to other parts of the world. As Nando Rodriguez, a coordinator, tells me: “We recently took a group of kids to Brazil. In this country we think of INTRODUCTION\n\nxiii\n\nslavery as a US thing. But now they learn it existed in Brazil too.” Organizations like this enrich and change lives in these poorer parts of the city. For the children who go, the experience is something they are likely to remember for the rest of their lives. In a Harlem restaurant, a waiter tells me about his background: “My mother is Gabonese and French, and my father is Polish and Chinese. I guess I’m just an American.” These multicultural families are on the rise, especially in New York City but nationally too. I also learn about them from students in my classes at City College. On the Upper West Side I come across Jacob’s Pickles. Sounds like a pickle joint, but it’s much more. It has sour cukes, kosher cukes, pickled carrots, and many other dishes and a wide selection of beers and biscuit dishes. I chat with the proprietor, who tells me why he opened this eatery: “I always loved pickles. It was my passion. That and beer. I see pickles, beer, and biscuits as the ultimate comfort food.” His comment reflects a very New York thing—the right to take your ultimate fantasy, put it out there, and see who will buy into it. It can be a place loaded with pinball machines that you can play and pay for by the hour or by the game. It can be a shop where you choose from many varieties of mayonnaise mixed with items you never thought would be a good mix. The pickle idea seems to be a winner, judging from the number of customers there. Then there are people whose game seems to be a bit more out of touch with the masses. Yet they too survive, albeit with a smaller customer base. Take Jack Seidenberg, owner of an antiques emporium in Greenwich Village which, with its absolutely stunning merchandise, looks like a museum. Alas, he has few customers these days. “How’s business?” I ask him. “Well, I make a living. My father started this business in 1940. It’s in my blood. But with everybody shopping virtually and rents going up, more and more stores are vacant. So it’s a struggle.” “And yet, you’re happy.” “You know, I have people who come in here and wake me up from my lethargy. They say to me: ‘You must have such a wonderful xiv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nlife, being surrounded by all these beautiful works of art.’ And I’m thinking about the next sale, but they set me right, and stop me in my tracks, stop me from thinking despairing thoughts.” Jack’s dilemma is one faced by thousands of small-business owners. They are conflicted by the love they have for their work or the fact that this is simply what they know how to do and by the realization that it may all end badly. New Yorkers are what makes this city what it is. Often, they rise to the occasion. Others do not, but they are at least passive identifiers. And this raises an interesting question. Is there something that binds Manhattanites together? I think so, and it starts with an acute consciousness of place. They know that they live and work in one of the most renowned places on the planet. About 80 percent of Manhattanites work in their home borough, which means their relationship with the city is all-encompassing, in a 24/7 way. It’s one of the factors that unites them in terms of what they see, do, and think about. Clearly a wealthy resident of Park Avenue and 86th Street experiences Manhattan differently than someone from Park Avenue and 118th Street. The former may dine in a fancy restaurant while the latter works in the kitchen. But the point is that New Yorkers at every level interact with each other almost daily. The cabbie or Uber driver talks politics or shares personal information with his or her passenger.2 People from different walks of life wait on line to get into a Knicks game and a conversation happens. As a result, everyone learns about the lives of others. Some learn more because they are interested and willing to share information and stories. Others, a bit suspicious or simply introverted, gain less, but almost everyone’s horizons are broadened in varying degrees over time. This creates a shared identity, one that’s far more common in a crowded and diverse city. But what accounts for that sense of commonality? First and foremost, there is an awareness of a common history, some of it bad, some of it good. A perfect case in point is what happened in INTRODUCTION\n\nxv\n\nManhattan on 9/11. Just as people did nationally when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, one of the most frequent questions New Yorkers ask each other is “Where were you when 9/11 happened?” This creates a bond of shared tragedy that, in effect, breaks the ice among people looking for a way to do so. A second choice may be where people were during the days when the “Son of Sam” terrorized the city. There’s also a positive way to engage: “Do you remember going to Coney Island?” “Remember how the Mets almost won the World Series?” A second factor has to do with daily topics of conversation that are relevant to all New Yorkers. This includes the subways, safety, the weather, or thoughts about the police or the mayor—loaded but still avidly discussed subjects, even among strangers. If people are in agreement on these subjects, that’s fine, though less interesting. If they’re not, it’s at least an area of shared experience. Since my method in this book was to approach total strangers and encourage them to talk to me, these and other similar topics were of crucial importance, and they worked for me as they do for other Manhattan dwellers. No matter where they live in Manhattan, many people are proud to tell others that they reside in this internationally known borough. Someone who lives in a public housing project on the Lower East Side is still the resident of a borough with great cachet. I grew up in a modest neighborhood in Manhattan, not Riverside Drive or Central Park West, but between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, above 96th Street. But when, as an adult, I told people that I was raised in Manhattan I could see they were impressed. As for those who live in the finest areas of the borough—the Upper East Side, Sutton Place, Chelsea—they know they’re at the top. It is the dream of many a suburbanite from Long Island or New Jersey to retire and live “in the city.” In the larger context, New Yorkers have multiple, overlapping identities. First, we have the neighborhood, be it the Upper West Side, Gramercy Park, Hamilton Heights, or Clinton. Second, there’s the borough, whichever one the person lives in. And then we have xvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNew York City, any and every part of it. These categories are used in many ways—to impress, to identify with, to make a comment about why they are who they are. In this last case, New Yorkers are apt to see themselves in the way that they think others see them: brash, smart-alecky, edgy; aggressive but also cool, hip trend-setters. And these are just some of the ways they describe themselves. Sometimes they use what they know to be stereotypes as a way of setting themselves apart, as in “I’m not your typical New Yorker.” The neighborhoods often intersect or overlap in very interesting ways. Many Manhattan residents have chosen to live somewhere because they can get to their place of work, also in Manhattan, more quickly. Thus residents of Washington Heights, now called Hudson Heights to improve the value of the real estate (it just sounds better), select it because the A train is a quick ride to Midtown or the Financial District. Others live in Harlem because it’s close to Columbia University, where they work. A woman living all the way up near 96th Street and Park Avenue feels violated because she can see from her apartment one of the world’s tallest apartment buildings all the way down on 57th Street, and she doesn’t like the way it looks. A man from Manhattanville works as a security guard in a Midtown museum. All day long he interacts with people who are regular museum visitors. Few of them come from his neighborhood. Observing them broadens his horizons. A social worker from the West Village travels to a low-income neighborhood in Marble Hill, where she engages on an intimate level with poor residents living in a public housing project. In short, Manhattanites know there are many different “Manhattans,” but they are all part of one geographically connected and incredibly complex borough. In essence, the great equalizer in Manhattan is accessibility. People think of the tremendous cultural jewels of Manhattan, like the theater, opera, concerts, sports events—not to mention its fine restaurants and expensive jewelry and clothing stores—as beyond the reach of all but the wealthy and upper-middle class. But it’s not true. They don’t need a substantial bank account to buy a low-end INTRODUCTION\n\nxvii\n\nitem at Tiffany’s, where a chain in sterling silver sells for $50, and other items are available for under $200. They can eat in Il Mulino and select carefully from the menu offerings. They can stand on the cancellation line to get discounted tickets for a Broadway show. They can go to the same Knicks game that Spike Lee attends; they just can’t afford to sit in the box seats, unless, of course, they know an employee at the Garden. Even a reservation at Rao’s,3 one of the city’s hardest restaurants to gain entry to, is achievable, that is, if they’re cousins of the Puerto Rican chef who works there. And they can certainly visit the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. In fact, some of the best things—relaxing or jogging in Central Park, various concerts everywhere—are free. The only difference is they can’t do it on a regular basis. Still, the warm glow from that occasional pleasure can last for years in the form of “Yes, we ate at Nobu [or Marea] and it was great.” They can reminisce about that great rock concert they went to, or that dress they bought at Saks Fifth Avenue. In short, it isn’t necessarily about how often you do something but simply the fact that you did it. They even have an economic edge over one category—the tourists. They don’t have to pay airfare to get here, nor do they have to find a hotel because they’re here already. The ability, however infrequently, to do all these things makes them feel that they too are real New Yorkers. People who live in the rest of the country can’t do them so easily. And what of Manhattan’s future? It certainly looks bright, what with 65 million tourists a year visiting the city, most of them focusing on Manhattan. So long as the crime rate remains low, it will remain that way. Yet, it does have some unique problems. One is that commercial and residential interests compete intensely with each other for the limited space that’s available. The city must find creative solutions that balance these critical needs. Another issue is affordable housing. In order for the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the service industries that keep the city functioning to get to work, they must live within a reasonable commute. xviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFortunately, the nearness of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and even Staten Island reduce the urgency of this issue. But the rest of the city is rapidly gentrifying as well, and the day of reckoning when hard decisions must be made is not far off. In New York City the number of homeless people continues to rise despite the city’s continuing efforts to address the problem. Mass transit is yet another problem, one that grows more urgent as more and more people pour into its aging and deteriorating stations and trains. Band-Aid solutions won’t work here, but major repairs and construction take time, effort, and planning that will inconvenience millions. Despite issues of this sort, Manhattan has both survived and thrived. Its people and leaders have always had a can-do, nononsense attitude that problems can and must be dealt with and solved. The classic example of recent times has been the response to 9/11, but other examples abound. For instance, in 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio wanted the city to retain control of the schools. When it became clear that part of the solution required making a deal with the charter schools, which he disliked, he gritted his teeth and came to an agreement. Also in 2017, he compromised when he realized that the railroads into the city required extensive repairs. Janette Sadik-Khan, the sometimes controversial commissioner of transportation under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, was widely respected as an innovative commissioner who knew what she wanted and got it done quickly. To write this book, I re-walked most of Manhattan, which I had systematically gone through when I walked it for The New York Nobody Knows. In doing so, I wore out two pairs of Rockport shoes. I didn’t walk every block as I had done before, but I covered most of them, traversing 721 miles as measured by my pedometer. Simply walking 51st Street from west to east is about 2.5 miles, so the miles add up very quickly. Portions of some avenues or streets were sometimes revisited if subsequent information about them made it necessary. As opposed to, say, Brooklyn or Queens, which have many larger and more spacious areas, Manhattan is very dense everywhere, INTRODUCTION\n\nxix\n\nboth in area and in terms of population, so the blocks tend to have much more to see on them. This requires walking more slowly and looking very carefully at everything. It took me eleven months to complete this project. Manhattan is a compact borough, and with parking at a premium, I relied almost exclusively on mass transit, which worked out very well. I began my walks at 230th Street and systematically walked every neighborhood, from that northernmost part to the southern tip of the island at State and South Streets. I walked the streets in the daytime and at night; during the week and on weekends; in the heat, which in 2016 was really bad at times, and in the cold, which wasn’t bad at all that mild winter. Even in the few years since my first book on this topic appeared, many changes have occurred—new buildings, restaurants, community gardens, bike paths, and so on. Because of both this and my desire to write a genuinely new book, almost everything in it is new material. The approach was also different, and this played an even bigger role in why so much of the material is new. The focus and structure of the book was to create a walking guide that allows the reader to cover every single neighborhood. This means that there must be a certain number of pages on every community, regardless of how interesting—or uninteresting—it may seem at first. That forces the writer to work hard to uncover new material. What surprised me was that every area is interesting. Sometimes I just had to look at things more closely and be more creative. Some of the places described here may no longer be there when you take your walks. The city is always changing. But no doubt, there will be new places to explore of equal or even greater interest. Most of the borough is safe, but for the few areas that aren’t, the appendix has useful tips on how to walk them. To find specific places and people, consult the index. There’s a street map for each community, and you can walk it in any order you’d like, searching out whatever moves you. I don’t know where walkers will begin their walks or what they will or will xx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnot want to see. Therefore, you can start and end anywhere, and the letters are not a guide to the order in which you should see places. To cover every area, it was necessary to be selective about what was chosen for discussion. But what I picked is also meant to whet your appetite, to entice you into wandering these streets on your own, where you’re likely to make new discoveries. Post offices, community district leaders, police precincts, and local schools often differ on the precise boundaries of neighborhoods, as do experts who have carefully studied the city. In drawing these maps, I relied primarily on my own walks and personal knowledge and, for corroboration, on Kenneth Jackson’s The Encyclopedia of New York City, plus some entries in Wikipedia, mostly as a fallback. A small portion of the historical material in the book was also corroborated by Jackson’s book and Wikipedia. Most of it, however, comes from my knowledge of the subject gained from forty years of teaching the New York City course at City College and CUNY Graduate Center. The best discussion regarding boundaries appears in a 2012 New York Times article.4 There are two critical ways in which this guidebook differs from the typical one. First is its focus on impromptu conversations with people from every walk of life. These people breathe life and energy into the material. By listening to what they had to say, I gained a much deeper understanding of what Manhattan is all about—its complexity, the joys and struggles of its inhabitants, the challenges its residents face, and what helps them get through life. This enhances the reader’s and/or walker’s ability to see life as the people who live there do. Sometimes I told people I was writing a book and at other times I simply engaged them in conversation. Whenever I recorded what was being said on my iPhone, I informed people of that. No one objected, as I explained that what they were saying was very important in terms of understanding the city. New Yorkers are actually a very friendly, if sometimes gruff, lot and are often pretty chatty INTRODUCTION\n\nxxi\n\nonce they get going. I attended community events, concerts, and parties; hung out in parks; stood on street corners; frequented bars and restaurants; and did all the things necessary to appreciate the pulse and heart of this wonderful place. The second major distinction between this and most other guidebooks is its focus on the unknown parts of the city. Clearly, they aren’t completely unknown, but they are unknown to most people who live or visit here. I deliberately ignored the sites that appear in other guidebooks. It’s not that these places aren’t critical in making the city what it is. They are, but they’ve already been covered. The goal here was to discover new, hidden aspects of Manhattan. Hopefully, readers will find the effort to have been worthwhile. And now, we begin our journey.\n\nxxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMARBLE HILL INWOOD WASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\nA St. Stephen’s United Methodist Church B The “Marble Hill House”\n\nIR\n\nE AV\n\nE\n\nB\n\nAV\n\nW\n\nE\n\n23\n\n0\n\nST\n\nLL ST\n\nAR\n\nE\n\nE\n\nM\n\nAC\n\nRL\n\nRI\n\nAR CH FT\n\nS\n\nPL\n\nVA\n\nLE\n\nS\n\nN\n\nPL\n\nCO\n\nAD\n\nJA\n\nCO\n\nBU\n\nUN TE\n\nEA\n\nAN\n\nR\n\nPL\n\nAV\n\nRR TE PL N IS\n\nSE\n\nRive\n\nr\n\nB\n\n22\n\n5S\n\nM T\n\nAR\n\nBL\n\nE\n\nHI\n\nB\n\nLL\n\nAV\n\nRO\n\nEXTERIOR ST\n\nlem\n\nW\n\nA W 228 ST\n\n5 ST W 22\n\nHar\n\nHI\n\nAV\n\n8\n\nVI\n\nEW\n\n22\n\nE\n\nW\n\nAV\n\nE\n\nB TI\n\nT ET\n\nBL\n\nH\n\nAV\n\nE\n\nJO\n\nO NS\n\nN\n\nW\n\nIN\n\nE\n\nAD\n\nW\n\nAY\n\nW 22 5\n\nST\n\nMARBLE HILL I begin my walk through Manhattan with Marble Hill, where this question is very appropriate. While legally part of Manhattan or, if you will, the County of New York, it is geographically completely separated from it. Instead of being part of Manhattan Island, it is the only portion of the borough located on the North American mainland, right next to the Bronx. Though it has a Bronx zip code, most of the city’s administrative offices that serve it are in Manhattan. Attitudes about the placement, some of them quite passionate, vary among the residents, so it’s probably best to start at the beginning. Built on a natural base of soft rock, dolomite marble, the hill, with its commanding view, was important for its strategic value during the Revolution. The hill was dubbed Fort Prince Charles by British forces, and one of its most beautiful, winding, and quiet streets still bears that name. The legal separation from Manhattan came in 1897, when the Harlem River boundary was moved some blocks south by the construction of the Harlem River ship canal, due to an increase in ship traffic. Now boats could go all the way around Manhattan and on a route that also reduced the distance from the Hudson River to Long Island Sound. In 1914, the northern border was filled in. For many in this uppermost section it was a tragedy, for Marble Hill was now literally left high and dry and with a less classy, even humdrum, address in their eyes. Sociologically, this can be seen in a somewhat different light. The sociologist W. I. Thomas famously said: “If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.” To which a philosopher’s rejoinder might be: Does defining them as real make them real? Today, this area is largely Hispanic and black, but this is true of both the Bronx and Manhattan, so ethnically speaking, this part of town would be a reasonable fit in either borough. WHAT DETERMINES WHERE A NEIGHBORHOOD BELONGS?\n\n3\n\nMarble Hill has its own shopping areas, but they don’t help in the conversation about where Marble Hill belongs. If you closed your eyes and walked this part of Broadway and then Inwood’s Dyckman Street, listening to the sounds of the neighborhood, its blaring music, languages spoken, heavy traffic, or opened them and looked at the stores, you could be in either the Kingsbridge part of the Bronx, immediately north, or in Inwood, immediately south. Sure, some people will say the fact that Marble Hill is physically separated from Manhattan by a bridge puts it in the Bronx. But isn’t Roosevelt Island part of Manhattan too? So, in the end, we yield to the legal, geographical, and political definitions and the decision made by the New York Legislature in 1984 to consider it part of Manhattan. The official boundaries are 230th Street on the north, Exterior Street to the east, the Harlem River on the south, and Johnson and Irwin Avenues on the west. It’s a mostly residential area with apartment buildings, many of them in the Art Moderne style, others of old wood frame, and private Victorian homes, in varying conditions. West of Broadway, the overall effect, augmented by its numerous winding, hilly streets, is that of a quaint, rustic village, but not completely, because there are some apartment buildings here too. Some of the nicest streets to wander around on are Terrace View Avenue, which partially encircles the buildings and other streets on the hill; Adrian Avenue, Van Corlear Place, Fort Charles Place, and Marble Hill Avenue. The Promenade, on 225th Street, has apartments with gorgeous views of the Hudson River and the Palisade Cliffs, as do some of the Art Moderne buildings with their corner casement windows in the area. East of Broadway, things are very different. You have bustling shopping streets, mostly on Broadway, 225th Street, and 230th Street. There’s also the NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) Marble Hill Houses, built around 1950, which today are home to black and Hispanic low-income residents. Those familiar with Marble Hill’s location think of a small area between 225th and 228th Streets with circular streets. It is that too, 4\n\nMARBLE HILL\n\nbut there’s more to it geographically. From Broadway, I begin by walking east on 225th Street toward the Major Deegan Expressway, a short distance away. Here, there are many chain stores of the inexpensive variety—T. J. Maxx, Sports Authority, etc.—as well as fast-food places and one of two Starbucks that service the community. I approach a man in a flowing white robe, or kaftan, who’s also wearing a large, white, crocheted skullcap, or kufi, on his head. He’s selling aromatic oils of many kinds across the street from the Marble Hill Houses. It turns out he’s from Senegal. “Are these any better than, say, Chanel No. 5?” I ask as an opening conversational gambit of sorts. “Oh, yeah. They are better, because the oils are natural and pure.” I take a whiff of one and it smells quite nice. But then, looking at the name, “Weekend,” I exclaim: “Oh no! Today is Thursday. I’ll have to wait until the weekend for my wife to be able to use it!” He laughs and continues his sales pitch: “And instead of paying one hundred, you can get it for ten, twenty dollars, depending on the size you choose.” He has a point. This is not a wealthy or even middle-class area. People here don’t have the money for expensive perfume. This oil has a pleasant fragrance and is cheap, so even if the bottle is quite plainlooking it’s a great deal. Ten minutes away in upscale Riverdale, it’s a different universe. Returning to the west side of Broadway and walking up 230th Street, I make a left on Kingsbridge Avenue and, after a block, enter the old part of Marble Hill that overlooks the water. St. Stephen’s United Methodist Church on the corner of 228th Street and Marble Hill Avenue, built in 1897, is one of the oldest structures in the area. The entrance has diagonal, red-painted wooden slatted doors and features a beautiful rose window. It has adapted to better serve the changing demographics of the neighborhood, offering services in both Spanish and English. I meet Derek Winslow as he’s walking out of his multi-apartment building at 61 Marble Hill Avenue and express my admiration for MARBLE HILL\n\n5\n\nA gorgeous church from 1897 adapts—Spanish and English services. 6\n\nMARBLE HILL\n\nA Catskills vacation hotel? A one-family in Marble Hill.\n\nwhat was once a single family home built by a real estate agent in the 1890s.The black half-timbers surrounding the white squares that make up the building have a Tudor appearance, but the style isn’t really Tudor. Nonetheless, it’s a pretty house. It’s one of the oldest homes in the area and some call it the “Marble Hill House.” Derek gives his views regarding Marble Hill: “It’s a great area, very quiet, pretty safe, with real character as far as the houses go. I love the stones near the bottom of the curved brick apartment building across the street. It’s also convenient to the city with the IRT number 1 train nearby.” That’s a pretty accurate description. I walk to Fort Charles Place and see numerous private wood-frame places with peaks or cupolas, usually covered with protective shingles. People are relaxing in the early evening, chatting or enjoying an outdoor meal in their small gardens. In terms of peace and quiet, it’s a most un-Manhattan-like place and definitely worth the trip.\n\nMARBLE HILL\n\n7\n\nHar\n\nRive\n\nr\n\nHE\n\nPA\n\nVE\n\nAV ST\n\nCK MA T NS\n\nN\n\nL AG\n\nV EA\n\nC Dichter’s Pharmacy D Dyckman Farmhouse Museum E MamaSushi Restaurant F Mamajuana Restaurant G La Marina – celebrity place\n\nAY W\n\n21\n\n6S T\n\n5S T\n\n1S T\n\nW W\n\nW\n\nAV TH\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\nAV TH 20\n\n6S T\n\n5S T\n\n4S T\n\n3S T\n\n2S T\n\n1S T\n\n20\n\nW 20\n\n20\n\n7S T\n\n22\n\n9S\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nbought Manhattan for $24\n\nW W\n\n10\n\nB Site where Peter Minuit\n\n2S T\n\n3S T\n\n21\n\nW\n\n21\n\ner E\n\nW\n\nA Cave of Sabas\n\n21\n\nW\n\nRiv\n\nE\n\nT 4S\n\nDY\n\nPO\n\nAV\n\nW W\n\n20\n\nAN\n\nE\n\nTE\n\n7S T E RR\n\nW\n\nRM\n\nAV\n\nYEA\n\n8S T\n\n10\n\nIL ERM\n\nT YS\n\nE SH\n\n21\n\n21\n\nE\n\nEM\n\nV\n\nW\n\nST\n\nAD\n\nST\n\nE\n\nAY\n\nW\n\nRK\n\n21\n\n21\n\nW\n\nPA\n\nW\n\nST\n\nDW\n\nT\n\n207\n\nOA\n\nAC\n\nBR\n\nC W\n\nNG ST MI AK CUM\n\nSON NA MA SEA ST ER OP D CO\n\nRK\n\nW\n\nR ER\n\nIsham Park\n\nAM\n\nBE\n\nF\n\nAVE\n\nISH\n\nPAY\n\nW\n\nHA V\n\nG\n\nRD\n\n0S\n\nT\n\nHA VE\n\nAN\n\n9T\n\nDS\n\nIN\n\nB\n\nNR\n\nYH U\n\nInwood Hill Park\n\nDI\n\nST 5 21 T W 14 S W2\n\nON\n\nPK\n\nWY\n\nA\n\nAD\n\nHu\n\ndso\n\nnR ive\n\nr\n\nlem\n\nO\n\nN\n\nE\n\n9T\n\nRY\n\nO\n\nG\n\nBR\n\nN\n\nDS\n\nID\n\nHa rlem\n\nHE\n\nHU\n\nBR\n\nT\n\nINWOOD to the north and east, Dyckman Street on the south, and the Hudson River along the west. The US Postal Service considers Fairview Avenue to be Inwood’s southern border. However, as a trip to the area will confirm, most residents consider Dyckman Street and not Fairview Avenue to be the southern border of Inwood and the longer they have lived there the more emphatic they are about it. That includes Yours Truly, who had lived in Washington Heights for seven years. This may be, in part, because the topography immediately below Dyckman “feels” like Washington Heights. For example, “the Heights” has many buildings on both sides of Broadway that have five or more stories’ worth of concrete support foundation before the actual basement begins, and that includes Fairview Avenue and the surrounding streets. Second, Dyckman is a major thoroughfare and Fairview is a minor street. Third, most authoritative sources, including The Encyclopedia of New York City, also consider the southern border to be Dyckman. Beginning in 1906, when the IRT train began running here, Inwood became a neighborhood of apartment buildings, many of them in the Art Deco style. Its growth accelerated with the arrival of the A train in 1932. The main ethnic population groups living here were Irish and Jewish until the arrival of Dominicans in the late 1970s. This pattern accelerated over the next few decades, and today the area is predominantly Dominican, augmented by increasing numbers of more recently arrived Mexicans.5 The public housing project, Dyckman Houses, is where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar grew up. In recent years, however, the area has begun to gentrify, especially north of Dyckman Street and west of Broadway. Its reputation as a dangerous neighborhood stems from the 1970s, but overall, it’s one of the safer areas in the city. It has two wonderful parks, Inwood Hill Park and Fort THE BOUNDARIES OF THIS AREA ARE THE HARLEM RIVER\n\n9\n\nTryon Park, the latter belonging mostly to neighboring Washington Heights. The main commercial thoroughfares are Broadway; Dyckman Street, which has some nightclubs; and 207th Street. I begin my walk on Dyckman Street, near the Hudson River, where it meets Riverside Drive, and turn left. These are the last two blocks of Riverside, which begins its northward path on Manhattan’s West Side. Most people living on the Upper West Side, in Morningside Heights, and in the Washington Heights parts of Riverside Drive have no idea that this is where it ends. It’s a peaceful quiet street, and I notice some fancy cars parked here, including a black highend Jaguar sedan. Retracing my steps on Riverside and returning to Dyckman, I head east and turn left in two blocks onto Payson Avenue and soon enter Inwood Hill Park, which runs along the left side of Payson. The park has 196 acres of a naturally preserved park, complete with many shady paths, often covered with a thick canopy of leaves. There are huge trees with gnarled branches, thick underbrush along the sides of the path, and, intermittently, cliffs and giant boulders. There’s an occasional jogger or dog walker, but it’s nothing like the crowds in the upper part of nearby Fort Tryon Park. The wellmaintained soccer, tennis, and baseball fields, as well as a large manmade pond, are nearby, but I can’t see, or even hear the noise from, these recreational facilities. It is here that I meet and speak with a most interesting individual. Walking along one of these trails, my reverie is interrupted by a faint noise, which sounds like the crackling from one of those now extinct transistor radios. My hunch turns out to be right, for as I follow the noise along a dirt path, ascending a steep rocky incline, I recognize the sound of a voice reporting the news. Simultaneously I spy, between low-hanging branches, a small elderly man relaxing beneath the overhang of a rock formation. His place is not visible to those strolling along the concrete walkway below. I call out to him in greeting, and he responds affirmatively in a thin reedy voice: 10\n\nINWOOD\n\nGrand entrance to cave-home of Sabas.\n\n“How are you doing today?” “Fine. Why not?” By now I’m standing in front of his cave, or lair. He’s a small fellow and is actually dressed like a gnome—a peaked woolen hat, a red and black jacket, green pants, and soft, suede-like moccasins. He’s surrounded by black and white smallish garbage bags, a number of which seem to contain clothing, bottles, and assorted detritus. “I’m the creature from the creation,” he tells me, smiling. “That’s great to hear. I’m just turning on the tape recorder, so I won’t forget what you’re saying. You have a nice home here, and it’s got a great view; but you can’t stay here in the winter, can you?” “Why not? What’s the problem?” “Problem? Well, it’s so cold then.” “All my neighbors are here—squirrels, birds, raccoons. We all hang out together.” “You remind me of the Garden of Eden, when people lived happily with all living things. Are you a New Yorker?” INWOOD\n\n11\n\nThe palace grounds of an urban cave-dweller. 12\n\nINWOOD\n\n“Yeh. From all around here.” “I see you have this nice yellow sombrero here to protect you from the sun. What about shopping? How do you get your necessities back to your place?” “It’s not easy, but I manage.” “Did I just happen to catch you at lunch or are you here all day?” “No, I wander around the hills and elsewhere in the city. But I move between civilization and the primordial. And it’s very easy to slip from one to the other if you’re in wooded areas within the city.” “Do you like the primordial better?” “Well, it’s healthier.” “Is it dangerous here at night?” “God knows. I’m here. It’s like asking a squirrel, ‘Is it dangerous?’ It depends on who you meet, I guess. I haven’t experienced crime at night.” “What’s your name?” “Sabas, and it’s a name with a very interesting history.6 It’s from the fifth century, originally descended from the Egyptian pharaohs. And they built many monasteries in the Middle East.” “Did you serve in the Korean War?” “Yes. I was drafted. Afterwards I gambled. And you win, and you win, and you win, and you win, and then you have some money. That’s how you manage to eat. I wasn’t rich, but I always had money in my pocket. I’m eighty-two years old. I used to live on 135th Street between Amsterdam and Broadway, paying $78 a month. I had rent control. No more, though.” “You should visit me at City College, where I teach.” “Well, I camped out in St. Nicholas Park behind the college for many years. It was a wild area. I had a wonderful experience there about twenty-five years ago, going down the stairs. The students were coming up, 1,000 students, I’d guess. It was a windy day. Birds love to fly in windy weather. So, I’d be watching them fly, trying to follow these birds, which way they were going, up, down, sideways, INWOOD\n\n13\n\nfor about ten or fifteen minutes, and when I looked down all the students were gone, nowhere to be seen. I had been concentrating so hard on the birds that I forgot they were there! And I laughed and laughed hysterically. It was so funny to me. And I collapsed laughing for five minutes.” “You seem to love life.” “I’ve enjoyed my life. I’ve had a great life. I sleep here at night and it’s beautiful. I take a quick dip if it’s 50 degrees. It’s very stimulating and refreshing.” “But you must wear warm clothing in the winter.” “How dare you ask that? Are you suggesting that I go nude in the winter? Of course, I wear clothing. But I don’t always stay here. I have many, many locations. I don’t want to suffer. But I always return here. When I see these snow-clad hills, I’m happy. I prepare the area in the autumn with leaves that I can lie on under a tree or in a cave. I’ve been doing this at least half my adult life. And it’s warm. There’s no wind in here.” “When you hear the radio and catch the news, what do you think about what’s going on in the world?” “Why would I want to listen to that? It’s mostly bad. I want to think about good things.” “Well, you have a million-dollar view of the forest from here.” “I do. I do. I see the leaves falling. I see them come down like ballet dancers. Each one is turning and twisting and bending, caressing the air. It’s a loving situation. And no two fall the same way, so I’m overwhelmed. I’m overwhelmed.” “That’s beautifully put. Before I leave, let me ask you if you need any money. Can I give you something?” “Why would you have to give me anything? I have everything I need. And I have my Korean War veteran’s pension too. It’s not much, but it’s enough. The creator takes care of me because I obey his natural laws.” “I’m going home. Maybe I can call you sometime.” “I don’t have a phone. I’m antiquated.” 14\n\nINWOOD\n\nThis is, when all is said and done, a beautiful man. Sabas has carved out a life for himself that is the essence of simplicity. Allowing for the rough patches he has had throughout his life and probably still has, his outdoor existence is like a modern-day urbanized version of Thoreau’s at Walden Pond. His description of the leaves falling is quite literally “poetry in motion.” He is peaceful, friendly, rational, and at one with his environment. As in the story about the students, he is able to find joy even in seemingly inconsequential events. He isn’t really homeless. He has a home in a cave, and it’s all he needs or wants. He’s apparently in good health, perhaps better than most eighty-two-year-olds. When I look into his twinkling blue eyes, I see a happy, contented person. The ancient book Sayings of the Fathers, compiled almost 2,000 years ago, states: “Who is rich? He who is satisfied with what he has.” And is this not true of Sabas? History lives in these parts. As I walk to the park entrance, I stop at a plaque proclaiming the rock to which it is affixed to be the legendary precise location (a contradiction in terms!) where Peter Minuit reportedly purchased Manhattan Island in 1626 from the Lenape Indians for $24 (actually, 60 Dutch guilders) and some trinkets, and where a tulip tree grew to be 120 feet tall, with a girth of twenty feet. At the corner of Seaman Avenue and W. 207th Street, by the park exit, I stand in front of an elderly black man with a full white beard. He is sitting at a long folding table in front of the park and conducting a Bible study class. Seated before him are three women; two are Hispanic and the third is African American. He is reading from a Hebrew-English Bible, one typically used by Orthodox Jews. His religion seems to be a mix of Judaism and Christianity. To emphasize that, perched on his head is a black crocheted skullcap with a white cross stitched into it. “We study Jesus,” he tells me. “Why did he come into this world? What was his mission? Either he’s a liar or he was God. So we have to dissect this frog, figure out what’s true and what’s not.” “You’re wearing this unusual skullcap with a cross on it.” INWOOD\n\n15\n\n“Ah, yes,” he exclaims with a smile as his eyes open wider. “Isaac asked his father, ‘We have wood and the flint, but where’s the sacrifice?’ Abraham’s answer is everything: ‘God shall provide the answer for himself.’ Only God can do that. So whatever hung on that cross is God. Any other view is an abomination. And to be a true Jew, you must follow every letter of the law. We fast on Yom Kippur, and our hearts are truly broken when we have sinned.” This man’s voice, appearance, and persona are both warm and charismatic. He has been here for years. He harms no one, and he has his devoted followers. Like the Jehovah’s Witnesses near the Inwood train station, he is part of a veritable army of religious devotees of a variety of faiths who sort of patrol the streets looking for people willing to hear their message. They are part of the tapestry that makes up this city and gives it the reputation it deserves as a world center for freedom of expression. In two blocks I turn left onto Broadway and come to Dichter’s Pharmacy. It also houses a soda fountain that serves delicious ice cream cones at low prices. Continuing back down Broadway to W. 204th Street, I pass the well-known Dyckman Farmhouse Museum, named after the family that once inhabited this twostory Dutch Colonial. I swing right onto Dyckman and head west, toward the river. This part of the street has nightclubs and restaurants like Mamajuana Café at #247, featuring mostly Hispanic food, but there’s also a sushi place, MamaSushi at #237; both draw large crowds on the weekend. Locals complain about the noise emanating from La Marina, a club by the Hudson River that draws celebrities like Jay-Z and Beyoncé. These places are an attraction both for gentrifiers and for middle-class Dominicans who like to return to where their American lives began, a combination of nostalgia and remembering how far they have gone on the road. I turn around and go back east along Dyckman. After Broadway, I begin passing many low- and medium-priced stores. One that stands out has the familiar masks of comedy and tragedy above the shop window, but they’re reversed. The store sells sports hats, and 16\n\nINWOOD\n\nthe connection between that and the neon sign outside is unclear. The Chinese owner thought it looked nice, and so there it is. There aren’t always explanations for what turns out to be best described as a mere whim. Entering a Yemeni grocery store, I conclude my trip on a more somber note. The owner, thinking I might be, as he put it, “CIA or FBI,” pulls out his driver’s license to prove to me that “I am legal,” in case I suspect otherwise. This is a reminder that many residents in this metropolis are haunted daily by the prospect of possible arrest and deportation. Others with similar concerns may be found in the Mexican joints along Tenth Avenue that are a harbinger of Inwood’s newest and fast-growing group of immigrants.\n\nINWOOD\n\n17\n\nDY\n\nF\n\nCK MA\n\nIL LS G EO I D\n\nV EA\n\nRT\n\nFO\n\nE\n\nN BO DU\n\ner\n\nPar\n\nk\n\nC\n\nRiv\n\n5S T\n\nHa\n\nrlem\n\n3S T\n\nA Johnny Grasa barber shop\n\nI-95\n\nC Raoul Wallenberg\n\niver\n\nD The Pumpkin House\n\nPlayground\n\nem R\n\nark eP\n\nRD R\n\nMR IVE\n\nRLE\n\nE\n\nAU\n\nE\n\n18\n\nHarl\n\nE\n\nDA HA\n\nRG\n\n9S T\n\n7S T\n\nJ\n\nER\n\ndg AY\n\nE\n\nB El Nuevo Caridad\n\nST\n\nAVE\n\nHig hb ri\n\nMBE ECO EDG I\n\nDR\n\nM\n\nW VE\n\nE\n\nLL\n\nV EA\n\nHI\n\nY WA\n\nTER 6S T\n\nAM\n\nSAINT NICH OLAS AVE\n\nK L\n\n18\n\nOL\n\nWO DS\n\nTN ICH\n\nWA\n\nIN SA\n\n18\n\n18\n\n0S T\n\nM\n\n4S T\n\nW\n\nW\n\n8S T\n\nAV\n\nDWAY BROA\n\nTW A 0S T\n\nN 5S T\n\n2S T\n\n17\n\nB\n\nW\n\nAS\n\nWA D H A SWO RT VE H RT\n\nE TA V NET\n\nNA VE GTO SHIN 15\n\n17\n\n7S T\n\nER\n\nW\n\n16\n\n16\n\nRIV\n\n6S T\n\nO 4S T\n\n17\n\n8S T\n\nM\n\n15\n\nFOR\n\nN AV E\n\nRIVERSIDE DR\n\nHAVE W\n\nOA\n\nDW\n\nAY\n\n8S T\n\nBR\n\nW\n\n2S T 16 1S T\n\n0S T\n\nRLE\n\nY\n\nNR 15\n\n16\n\nW\n\nHA\n\nHU\n\nW W\n\nW\n\n17\n\n18\n\nA\n\nAV\n\nIN\n\nT AV E HURS\n\nPINE\n\nBEN 1S T\n\nW\n\nW\n\nW\n\nST\n\n16\n\nGL\n\nAV\n\nD IB LV\n\nWY PK\n\nBR CA\n\nON DS YH U NR HE\n\nDS\n\nW\n\nHE W\n\n5\n\nAD\n\nBRO\n\nr nR ive dso Hu Hud son River Greenway WY\n\nPK ON\n\n16\n\nN\n\nW\n\n16\n\nDE\n\nW\n\nW\n\nT NS\n\n18\n\nI-95\n\n17\n\nNA\n\nG\n\nH\n\nW\n\nW\n\nOD\n\nD\n\nGE\n\nW\n\nAR\n\nON B RID\n\nE\n\nH\n\nI INGT\n\nAV\n\nAN\n\nWO\n\nE\n\nERM\n\nELL\n\nG.

Until the early 1900s it was mostly estates and quite rural. But once the subway lines were able to reach it, it became a favorite of developers. Throughout most of the twentieth century, Broadway was a dividing line here, both economically and ethnically. The poorer folks lived east of the avenue and the middle classes predominated on the west side. The white population was mostly Irish and Jewish, with many of the latter consisting of refugees from Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Greeks also moved to the community in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1960s, the area east of Broadway had become quite Hispanic, most of them Puerto Ricans and, to a lesser extent, Cubans. Soviet Jews arrived in the 1970s, but the major demographic shift in the mid-1970s was the influx of large numbers of Dominicans, who eventually became the largest group. The area east of St. Nicholas Avenue from about 163rd Street south to 155th Street remained a black enclave. Today, the area is mostly Dominican to the east (the largest such concentration in the United States), with a small community of Orthodox Jews who live around Amsterdam Avenue and Laurel Hill Terrace and are affiliated with Yeshiva University’s campus there. The Irish and Jews are mostly gone as distinct ethnic groups, but there are still a few synagogues, churches, and schools to accommodate the few who remain west of Broadway. The major development today is an increase in a young population of gentrifier types who find the western side, dubbed Hudson Heights by realtors, both attractive and convenient. They include Jews, Italians, Irish, Hispanics, Chinese, Koreans, and people of many other backgrounds whose common denominator isn’t ethnicity or race, but rather young, hip, THIS IS A LARGE, SPRAWLING AREA IN UPPER MANHATTAN\n\n19\n\nand professional. There’s also a tiny upscale section that has long been home to professional and entertainment personalities. You’ll find it from 155th to 158th Street between Riverside Drive and Riverside Drive West. The primary commercial thoroughfares are Broadway, St. Nicholas Avenue, and 181st Street. There are no prominent upscale department stores, but there are small versions of them, as well as boutiques, eateries, and taverns, plus a major hospital around 168th Street, New York Presbyterian. For R & R, the main parks are Fort Tryon Park, Riverside Drive, and Highbridge Park, all with stunning views, plus walking and biking paths. As I begin my walk on Hillside Avenue where it intersects with Fort George Hill, Nagle Avenue, and twenty yards from bustling Dyckman Street, I’m struck by how quickly Hillside becomes residential and very quiet. The same is true for the surrounding small streets—Sickles, Ellwood, Arden, and Thayer Streets, Bogardus Place, and Broadway Terrace, hilly and lined with solid-brick prewar apartment buildings, most of them in good shape. I turn right off Hillside, onto Broadway where I can make out traces of the past, one of which is the former building of Congregation Ohav Sholaum on Broadway, north of Nagle Avenue. Today, it is home to the New York Child Resource Center, but the Star of David is still visible, high above the entrance, as is the cornerstone that reads, “1950.” The names and signs of Irish bars are still present on some of the avenues, though their clientele and fare have changed for the most part because of the large Dominican population now residing here. Inevitably, much has faded into obscurity over the decades. The large bowling alley near Broadway and Sherman Avenue that I frequented as a teenager, Manhattan Lanes, is now a parking garage with not a shred of evidence of its previous life visible from the street. Along Broadway, I enter the eastern edge of the lower part of Fort Tryon Park at Nagle Avenue and walk along a shaded path 20\n\nWASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\nlined with large rocks, tall trees surrounded by grass and small bushes that are not as well tended as the well-known upper section, which is home to the Cloisters and offers gorgeous views of the Hudson River and the city. This area is perfectly safe in the daytime, but not at night. This part of Fort Tryon runs along Inwood, but because its main upper part, entered from Fort Washington Avenue on the south, is geographically part of Washington Heights, the park as a whole is not considered part of Inwood. At Dyckman Street I swing right and complete the circular route I’ve taken at Hillside, but this time I go up the urban treadmill known as Fort George Hill. Invigorating on a cool day, I climb a street about nine-tenths of a mile beginning on Sherman Avenue and ending at the intersection of St. Nicholas Avenue and Wadsworth Terrace. The Dominicans are the dominant group in this area. People can be seen sitting by the windows, looking out on the street as if it were an entertainment venue. They also include mothers keeping an eye on their children. On almost every block, on a nice day, men are sitting around on folding chairs and stools, playing dominoes, conversing animatedly in rapid-fire Spanish as they mix and deal the smooth red, white, and black tiles. There are bodegas on almost every corner. Run by Dominicans, these have replaced the candy stores of an earlier, mostly Jewish and Irish generation. In a modern-day version of ethnic succession, many of the Hispanic owners are themselves being supplanted by Yemenis. They’re different in that they sell fruits, vegetables, and meat, but they also offer candy, soda, small packets of aspirin, toothpaste, and batteries. Men hang out in front of the stores and inside.7 Near 193rd Street, I stare at a most unusual barbershop located at 1632 St. Nicholas. Called Johnny Grasa, it has a twelve-foothigh glass display window, including the entrance door, which is framed by a nice wood design. In front of the window are two dark urns, connected by three bright-gold chains attached to golden brass rings. An American flag is on the left side, visible inside the shop. There’s a statue of a bald-headed man who, at first glance, looks WASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\n21\n\nOne-of-a-kind music-themed barber shop—with instruments. 22\n\nWASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\nlike he might have been “scalped” by the barber. It turns out to be a Halloween joke, a head that pops up and grins wickedly at whoever’s looking. I walk in and say hello to the barber at the first chair. He turns out to be the owner, Johnny, since that’s usually the owner’s station. Johnny looks at me a bit suspiciously, wondering what an “Americano” like me is doing here—not surprising, as the clientele in these places is almost exclusively Dominican. But that look is quickly replaced by a broad smile as I tell him that his shop is beautiful. As I’ve learned, a nice compliment goes a long way when interviewing people. “I see you’ve got all these instruments hanging on the wall—a trumpet, a keyboard, a guitar, and in pretty good condition. Why?” “They’re mine. I like to play music; so this way I can look at them when I work.” Johnny takes great pride in his place, and while it looks expensive, haircuts are a bargain at only $15. I engage in some banter with the other fellows, and then take my leave. I see and enter a restaurant on 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Washington Heights called El Nuevo Caridad. It features photos of the owner, Miguel Montas, with famous ballplayers, mostly New York Mets and Yankees. The Formica tables are laminated with photos of players. Some forty-odd menu offerings—a mix of Spanish, West Indian, and generic food—are named after the players, most of them Hispanic and some of them eternally famous, like retired Giants pitcher Juan Marichal. It reminds me of Larry David’s Los Angeles deli, where the sandwiches are identified by the names of famous Hollywood actors and personalities. By eating here, customers get deferred status from the players who have also dined here. A few blocks south and east I enter Raoul Wallenberg Playground, which runs south on Amsterdam Avenue from 188th Street. Encountering the Park and Recreation Manager, I ask him: “Who was Raoul Wallenberg?” He knows something about him but not much: “He was a man who saved Jews, I think.” “Has anyone ever WASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\n23\n\nasked about him?” “Yes, sometimes I get the question, and I’m thinking about doing a history of who he was, like they often do in parks.” There’s a real opportunity here. During World War II, some Jews fleeing the Holocaust were given refuge by the Dominican Republic, settling in the town of Sosua. Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, saved thousands of Jewish lives by issuing them protective Swedish passports. This commonality could strengthen the bonds between the Jewish and Dominican communities living in this area by bringing them together on the theme of helping those in need. From here I walk south to 181st Street and turn right, heading past Broadway. The area from 181st Street north to Fort Tryon Park and west of Broadway to the river is generally known as Hudson Heights rather than Washington Heights. It’s an invention by realtors designed to give the area cachet. It sounds better by creating an image of living in a place overlooking a scenic and historic river. In fact, other business enterprises have long used this approach here, as they have done elsewhere. For example, the Hudson View restaurant on the corner of Fort Washington Avenue and 181st Street definitely doesn’t have even a smidgen of a view of the river, and it’s unlikely it ever did unless a person could see through ten brick buildings, but that’s business. You hype what you have. At Fort Washington Avenue, I swing right and walk up to 187th Street, where I turn left. There’s no shortage of Art Deco buildings in New York, but the one at 822 W. 187th near Chittenden Avenue is truly exquisite, from the design on the doors and the exterior to the intricate markings in the lobby. And don’t miss the etched clipper ship on the silver elevator doors. I continue west and turn left on Chittenden, where I enjoy gorgeous views of the Hudson and the Palisades of New Jersey. At 16 Chittenden on the corner of 186th Street, there’s a brick private home resting on a steel reinforced cliff that overlooks the Hudson River, a true pièce de résistance. The home is also known as the Pumpkin House, so named because from the paths along the Hudson River far below or from boats in the river, 24\n\nWASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\nit looks like a jack-o’-lantern when lit up at night, because of where the windows are. Talk about the importance of location! I can actually see the demographic changes in the population by looking at the stores on 187th between Pinehurst and Fort Washington Avenues. There are ads for art and music workshops, yoga classes, and the like. There’s Waterford crystal for sale. Signs in local cafés plead for people to help owners find their lost Yorkies and West Highland terriers. There’s a pricey upscale grocery store, Frank’s Market. The process is different, however, than in Brooklyn’s Bushwick or Greenpoint because the area was always solidly middle class, even upscale. The young professionals moving in now are simply joining an existing older community of a similar socioeconomic level, not really transforming it. Rather, they are bringing in their own tastes and style of life. At Fort Washington Avenue, I turn left and soon arrive at Fort Tryon Park, one of the city’s most beautiful parks. Its appeal can immediately be appreciated upon entering it at 193rd Street and Fort Washington Avenue. There, resplendent in all its glory, is the Heather Garden. I stroll through it and enjoy the 500 or so varieties of shrubs and perennials—-dogwoods, tulips, hibiscus, azaleas, peonies, thistle, and much more. At the beginning of the garden there’s a sign: Let no one say, and say it to your shame, That all was beauty Here, until you came. A great no-littering exhortation! The park has the Met Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and home to almost 5,000 works of medieval art in a reproduced medieval stone monastery. The building is actually a reconstruction of five European abbeys, dismantled and shipped to New York City, and then reassembled into a new configuration. It has a very nice restaurant, called New Leaf, and many benches WASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\n25\n\non which to relax, but it’s the totality of the place that makes it so special. At every turn, it seems, there are breathtaking vistas of the city on one side and the Hudson River on the other, along the stone walls that line many of the walkways. You can see hills and valleys within the park, huge outcroppings of boulders, tall trees—all of which give the visitor an unparalleled feeling of peace and quiet hard to find in Manhattan. I exit the park at Fort Washington and head down to 187th Street. This whole area, sometimes called “Frankfurt on the Hudson,” was once home to thousands of German Jews, most of whom fled the Nazi regime in the 1930s.8 One of its most prominent residents was Henry Kissinger, who grew up here and attended George Washington High School. The 132 stone steps at 187th Street near his apartment building on Fort Washington Avenue, known as the “Kissinger Steps,” led down to Overlook Terrace, and Henry walked them every day to get to the school, located on Audubon Avenue and still there to this day. I trip down the stairs to Overlook Terrace and then to Bennett Avenue, where I make a left, walking up to 192nd Street. Have you ever heard of Bennett Rest? Probably not, unless you’re a local. It’s not a park; it’s not a restroom; and it’s not a playground. It’s situated on Bennett Avenue near 192nd Street and shaped in a semicircle, around which are arranged ten benches where I can sit in the shade beneath a tree or in the sun, close my eyes, and listen to the blue jays and robins serenading me or each other. Behind is a steep six-story rocky incline. Ascend it with caution. Turning around, I head south on Bennett to 181st Street and make a right. Just beyond Fort Washington I see a shop purveying Russian food. I’m surprised that it’s here since it’s not really a Russian neighborhood. It’s called “Moscow on the Hudson,” perhaps after the 1984 film starring Robin Williams, about a Russian circus musician who defects to the United States while visiting there. My conversation with the manager, a young fellow with beautiful black curly hair, is revealing. 26\n\nWASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\n“Why is this store here? Are there are Russians living here?” “Not many, but we have some, especially in the building on the corner. But most of our customers are online and we deliver. They come from all the way down on Gold Street in the Financial District, to the 70s and 80s on the West Side.” “How long have you been here?” “About sixteen or seventeen years. There used to be two other Russian stores here, but they closed.” “Why?” “Why? Because whatever they sold for five dollars we sold for three. That’s business.” As I survey the place, I see it has hundreds of items for sale— cheeses, meats, vegetables, canned products of all types, and even fresh cakes and pies. In the age of the Internet, location isn’t all that important. You can take orders from anywhere, including Europe or Asia, and have them shipped directly from the source, largely eliminating the need to make calls and even trips to distributors or manufacturers. A main shopping area in this part of the Heights is 181st Street, especially from Broadway east to Audubon Avenue. Here I pass by many affordable stores. One offers a real bargain for men’s suits: buy one, get two more for free. Sweaters are $10 apiece, but be warned— they’re 100 percent polyester. Outside one of the stores, a Hispanic woman dressed in bright blue sings the praises of Jesus, off-key but sincere-sounding. Whichever way I turn onto St. Nicholas Avenue, I have to carefully thread my way past the merchandise arrayed in almost chaotic fashion along the sidewalks, where Dominican vendors try to tempt me with bargain-basement prices, offering up shoes, dishwashing liquids, shirts, pants, brooms of every description, toys, and so on. The scene is reminiscent of what the Lower East Side’s Orchard Street used to look like in the ’50s and ’60s. And it’s but a few blocks east of Hudson Heights, reminding me that the contrasts offered by this city are even sharper because of their close proximity to each other. WASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\n27\n\nHighbridge Park along Amsterdam Avenue, whose main entrance is on 173rd Street, has been around forever. It has a huge swimming pool and an indoor recreation center, but its newest feature is the footbridge, which has been refurbished and reopened to the public, leading across the Harlem River to the Bronx. The footbridge had been closed for decades for safety reasons. In the 1980s, the neighborhoods on both the Manhattan and the Bronx side were crime- and drug-infested areas. As one knowledgeable person told me: “The authorities got tired of people being thrown off the bridge, so they closed it.” Today you can walk it in peace, strolling on a redbrick walkway with a herringbone design. Because of its unsavory past, perhaps, the fence along each side is about twelve feet high. The views of the city, both north and south, are really nice. I would see the same views from other bridges with vehicular traffic but I couldn’t take in the sights from a car in heavy traffic, especially if I was driving. On the return walk to the Manhattan side, there’s a great direct view of the Art Moderne–style water tower, built in 1934. As I stand there looking at it, I’m reminded of a different time, when I was nineteen. Seeking adventure, I joined a group of friends one evening at the base of the tower and pried away a round, woodslatted cover on the rocky ground. We descended, about ten of us, via a rope ladder and found ourselves inside an old water tunnel. We walked some fifty blocks, lighting up the tunnel with our flashlights. Seeing a manhole cover, we pushed it up and found ourselves in Mount Morris Park (now renamed Marcus Garvey Park) in the heart of Harlem. This was not long after the Harlem riots of July 1964, and tensions in the community were running high. No white person in his right mind ventured there at night, but we had let the manhole cover close shut and could not reopen it. All of us were white, and we split up and made our way to the Upper West Side, about a half-mile away, sticking to the shadows and avoiding people. We met up at 122nd Street and Broadway, unharmed and greatly relieved to have 28\n\nWASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\nmade it back to relative safety. In a way, it was a typical Gotham adventure. You do something crazy, flirt with danger, and have a story to tell to your children. Back in the present, the shortest way back to Amsterdam Avenue from the walkway involves a 97-step climb up a staircase through Highbridge Park—great exercise if you want it. There’s also a sculpture garden in the park, with some unusual creations. When I last saw it, these included a gorgeous evening dress with sequined panels and ruffles constructed out of empty potato chip bags, and an unidentified sculpture with flags and hundreds of tiny bells that looked sort of Tibetan. Many New York parks have exhibits like this, which give artists a valuable opportunity to showcase their talents. South of the park, I head down Amsterdam Avenue for about ten blocks until I reach St. Nicholas Avenue, where I veer left and come to the area surrounding Jumel Terrace, another interesting place to visit. While familiar to many local residents, it’s unknown, as I discovered, to most New Yorkers. Tucked away just east of St. Nicholas Avenue, it can be accessed most easily by climbing some stairs between 161st and 160th Streets. I found myself on Sylvan Terrace, a block of old wooden houses in a landmarked historic area. This may account for the fact that the neighborhood in the immediate vicinity remained stable enough during the bad times and was then poised to help gentrification along. It had a core, in other words. The brownstones around here are also well maintained and the tree-lined streets look very good. Today it’s racially mixed, and the houses on Sylvan Terrace sell for $1 million each or more. Nearby, the Morris-Jumel Mansion attracts visitors interested in Revolutionary War history and the sites of important events from the period. Nearby, at 555 Edgecombe Avenue by 160th Street, there’s an unusual place to hear free jazz on Sunday afternoons. That would be at the home of Marjorie Eliot, in her parlor, Studio 3F. Check the Internet for exact times. On 157th Street, between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway, I come upon a Seventh Day Adventist church that I knew had taken WASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\n29\n\nover a site where an Orthodox synagogue had previously existed more than a half-century earlier. This happens quite often, but there was a difference here. The Adventists’ form of Christianity contains many similarities to Judaism. They take the Bible literally. Thus, they do not work on Saturday, observing it as the Sabbath. Nor do they eat pork. Taking over a synagogue therefore meant something to them. It was a sanctified place. Indeed, as I entered the sanctuary, I saw that much of the original interior had been beautifully preserved—the pews, the windows, even the social hall. I speak with a Hispanic member who is modestly dressed in a long skirt, just like the Orthodox: “Every Friday night we eat dinner together in the social hall. We don’t work on the Sabbath, we don’t cook, and we don’t buy anything, although we turn on lights and we drive. We follow the Old Testament. Whatever it says, we do. We only eat kosher food—no pork, no shrimp or lobster. We have 200 members, mostly Dominican and a few Puerto Ricans.” “Since you have many Jewish practices, how do you feel about the fact that this was once a synagogue?” I ask. “Well, we feel a special holiness about this place because it was a synagogue before and many of the customs and laws we have are the same as the Jews. After all, they also observe the Sabbath.” Malcolm X was assassinated in Washington Heights in the Audubon Ballroom, at 166th Street and Broadway. An educational center with an imposing entrance has been created in his memory. Called the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, it’s an interactive museum and an event space. I show up on a weekday at noon, the only visitor besides two French tourists, and speak with someone affiliated with it. “We have some visitors,” she says, “but it’s not promoted enough. Money has been a problem. And so we’re forced to rent it out for straight-up parties—you know, drinking, cocktail dresses, sweet sixteens, you name it. I don’t like it. I mean, this is like sacred ground.” As a product of the 1960s, I strongly sympathize with her. To those who grew up in this era, 30\n\nWASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\nthe man was an inspiration, a person who overcame great hardship, only to be gunned down in the prime of his life. I go upstairs and enter the ballroom. Beautiful murals on the walls movingly present Malcolm X’s story. It is a somber place, one that invites reflection as you read the highlights of his life and his impact. A statement by Malcolm X under the last known photograph of him, dated February 18, 1965, reads: “I am only facing the facts. And I know that any moment of any day or any night could bring me death.” People are always interested in that sort of thing because it makes them feel that now they’re in the know, that they are acutely aware of how prophetic his statement was just a few days before his untimely death. The whole experience of seeing the memorial feels eerie to me because I was waiting for the uptown number 3 bus on that Sunday afternoon, February 21, 1965, along 165th Street, just east of Broadway, when I saw two men racing by me with a crowd of perhaps forty or fifty people in hot pursuit. I instinctively stepped back as far as I could inside a doorway as they went by. Malcolm X was eulogized on February 27th, and Ossie Davis spoke at his funeral before a crowd of about twenty thousand people. He was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Years later, I met one of Malcolm X’s daughters on a TV show, and when I told her what I had seen on that fateful day, she questioned me very closely about it. “What did the men look like?” she asked. I answered as best I could. I couldn’t have known if the two people I saw actually shot him or were being chased for some other reason. Today, it is widely agreed that the perpetrators were supporters of Elijah Muhammad who were angry with Malcolm X for having broken with their leader.9 For many, it seems somewhat unimportant to know which people or factions gunned him down. That knowledge has been overwhelmed by the tragedy that a man who might have united blacks and whites never got a chance to change or at least deeply affect the course of history.10\n\nWASHINGTON HEIGHTS\n\n31\n\nHAMILTON HEIGHTS MANHATTANVILLE MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS CENTRAL HARLEM EAST HARLEM\n\nCH\n\nOL\n\nAS\n\nPL\n\nS AV E\n\nOLA\n\nED AVE LAS\n\nTER\n\nTA VE\n\nN\n\nEN\n\nHO\n\nLTO\n\nILT\n\nG\n\nA City Tabernacle Seventh\n\nDay Adventist Church\n\nB Friendship Garden (Bette Midler) C Harlem Public D The Hand Pulled Noodle E Jumbo Pizza & Coffee Shop F Mural of Langston Hughes,\n\nDuke Ellington, & Billy Strayhorn\n\nMB CO GE\n\nED\n\nicho\n\n5S T\n\nSt. N\n\n13\n\nlas\n\nH W\n\nEA VE\n\nPark\n\nST.\n\n7S T\n\nM\n\nF\n\nPL\n\nNIC\n\nHA\n\nON\n\n3S T\n\nNV\n\n9S T\n\n14\n\nMI\n\n1S T\n\nCO\n\n13\n\nW 14\n\nHA\n\nW\n\n13\n\n.N I EA V\n\n5S T\n\nNR\n\nW\n\nW\n\nST.

It’s named after Alexander Hamilton, who lived here in a home known as Hamilton Grange, now relocated to 141st Street between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues. From the end of the nineteenth century until the 1930s and 1940s, it was a largely white area. It then began to attract more black residents and remained a black area through the 1960s and 1970s, when many middle-class blacks lived in the brownstones that make up a good part of the housing stock. Today, the population is predominantly Dominican, residing primarily west of Amsterdam Avenue. The remaining black population is east of Amsterdam. A major change has been added to this mix in the past eleven years, as young, mostly white students, artists, musicians, and even some young families have moved to the area. They live scattered throughout the area, along the side streets east and west of Broadway, the commercial thoroughfare in the area along with Amsterdam Avenue. Commercially, it’s a hodgepodge of Hispanic-run groceries, restaurants, clothing stores, and the like, interspersed with boutiques, wine bars, pubs, and neutral places like AT&T outlets, fast-food places, veterinarian offices, and pharmacies. Glass/metal apartment boxes are being built more frequently in the last several years, and the trend is toward gentrification. One major presence in the neighborhood is Riverbank State Park on 145th Street and Riverside Drive, which sort of unifies the neighborhood. The Drive is a popular place for everyone, and its constant pedestrian traffic makes it a fairly safe place for all. Hamilton Heights is also home to City College of New York. THE BOUNDARIES OF THIS UPPER MANHATTAN COMMUNITY\n\n35\n\nA well-known subsection is Sugar Hill, which extends roughly from 145th to 155th Street and from St. Nicholas to Edgecombe Avenues. Called “Sugar Hill” to emphasize the “sweet life” that existed there, it has been the subject of books, films, and songs and has many beautiful homes. Many well-known and wealthy African Americans lived there at one time or another, including W.E.B. Du Bois, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, and Thurgood Marshall. It’s worth noting that in recent years people have begun referring to Hamilton Heights, Manhattanville, and even Morningside Heights, as part of west, or greater, Harlem.11 If you thought that gentrification in these parts is only occurring in Central Harlem or in Hudson Heights, think again because it’s definitely happening here, in Hamilton Heights. Passing by a vestpocket park near 147th Street, I see a group of white and black mothers with their pricey carriages, supervising their toddlers. Don, a tall and fit black man, is originally from Connecticut. He’s walking his cute Pomeranian along Riverside Drive in the 140s and is an IT entrepreneur who works downtown. There seems to be a dearth of pit bulls here in contrast to what it was like fifteen years ago, when I walked up the Drive. Down-to-earth, he talks enthusiastically about his neighborhood: “This area’s great. It’s quiet and safe. There’s affordable housing, but a lot of it is market rate and quite expensive. Apartments near me, by 157th Street, are going for 1.7 million. There’s all sorts of pubs and restaurants opening up here. Entire blocks are changing before you know it, store rents are going up. Movies are made here all the time now in these streets.” A walk along 147th Street between the Drive and Broadway provides ample evidence of what has transpired. Almost every brownstone is well tended. Potted plants and gardens are beautifully arranged in front of most homes, a good example being #628. A red brick house with inviting bay windows, it has a wrought-iron terrace and an array of chrysanthemums, hydrangeas, hibiscus, coleus, 36\n\nHAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\nimpatiens, and roses that look like they belong in a House & Garden photo spread. The entire row of houses ascends, almost romantically, up a steep hill. The detailing around the cornices and doorways is often exquisite. One has a coffered checkerboard pattern on the second floor, painted in rainbow colors. I ask two young white males about the area and they confirm the dramatic change, telling me that everything’s being brought in—“shops, new apartment buildings on Broadway, and dog parks” in preparation for the expected wave of well-heeled residents. One of the many attractive side streets both east and west of Broadway is 150th Street. As I walk east toward Amsterdam Avenue, I take a look at the pink marble facade of the City Tabernacle Seventh Day Adventist Church with a nice wooden entranceway. There’s a large ornate archway over it with intricate designs of leaves and branches. Above that the rose window is closed off, and instead of the stained glass there’s a camera—a true sign of the changing times, notwithstanding the eternal nature of religion. There are Corinthian columns and a tiled roof as well, along with stained glass windows. Farther down are some beautiful brownstones and limestone homes in various styles, well preserved and well tended. And near Amsterdam there’s a surely one- of-a-kind community garden, dubbed the Friendship Garden, founded by Bette Midler and funded by the New York Restoration Project and also by a grant from the Broadway musical Wicked. It has hanging impatiens, shrubs, tomato plants, benches to sit on, tables, and a nice cobblestone walkway. But it’s the theme that draws you in. Built into the wrought-iron gate are two images of witches—one dressed in white, the other in black—because Wicked is a play about the Wizard of Oz. All of the lampposts in the garden have the word OZ at the top. The painting on the garden wall features the field of poppies associated with The Wizard of Oz. It was certainly creative thinking to approach the play’s producers and offer them free advertising in exchange for some funding. HAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\n37\n\nThe Wizard of Oz lives—“far from” the madding crowd. 38\n\nHAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\nThe building next to the garden was once home to the Joseph Loth Fair & Square Ribbon Factory, established in 1893 and running a full block between 150th and 151st Streets on Amsterdam Avenue. If you stand next to the garden on 150th Street, you can see the original, very weathered sign reading “Fair & Square” on the back of the building. It’s a reminder that this was once a manufacturing town. The red-brick building still stands and now houses a charter school. One of the best-known pubs around here with good food is Harlem Public at 3612 Broadway, near 149th Street, with a hipster-type ambience that nevertheless attracts people of all ages and is crowded even during off-hours. More unusual is a small place at 3600 called the Hand-Pulled Noodle. “Come watch us pull your noodle, slap your ribbon, and chop your ding-ding,” reads the signboard outside the place. It sounds somewhat obscene, perhaps, but it’s actually an insider description of how their noodles are made, and I’m able to watch how the kitchen workers do this. The ding ding noodles are not the usual variety of noodles, as they are folded several times and chopped into a knot. They’re native to the northwest Chinese province of Xinjiang. Regular noodles and dumplings are also available. The wallpaper features Chinese newspapers and the seating is simple, with red metal stools along wooden counters. The place is packed both at lunch and in the evening, with the line out the door. And if you’re not in the mood to wait, they even deliver. A young bearded man eating there gives me his take on the neighborhood: “I’m a designer and I’ve been living here for three months because the rents are cheap. I got a 400-square-foot two-bedroom for $1,800 a month, but I can tell you if you pay any less it gets really grim— bad building, sketchy laundry situation. This is true of everything from 135th to Inwood in the 200s, although up there it’s often not good. And no matter where you live up here it’s gonna be noisy because this part of town is heavily Dominican, but you can live with that.”\n\nHAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\n39\n\nStanding at 147th Street and Broadway, I see a sign across the street near 148th for Jumbo Pizza and Coffee Shop at 3954 Broadway. Does “jumbo” really mean giant slices? Is jumbo necessarily good? Yes on both counts, it turns out. The slices are gigantic (and fresh) and the taste is outstanding, according to a sampling of customers with whom I spoke. And the price is right, $2.25 a slice. Plus, it’s clean and attractive-looking. I chat with Theo, the young owner of Greek heritage, who tells me he opened the place two years ago. He was following in his father’s footsteps, who owned pizza shops in upper Manhattan for many years: “We’re doing very well. We have the local market, but we also do orders from as far away as Columbia University. The City College basketball team also orders from us. And we have the coffee shop because then it’s a complete A to Z restaurant.” Places like this are what make a neighborhood gel in its earlier stages, when there’s a mix of students and artsy types. Then, when and if it becomes upscale, they morph into more expensive eateries or they sell it to someone else who can do that. And sometimes, if they are renting the space, rent increases may drive them out. But until then, they stand out, they become hangouts, and they serve good food at low prices. On the south side of 142nd Street between Hamilton Place and Amsterdam Avenue, there’s a mural depicting important figures in black history—Langston Hughes, ostensibly reading his poetry from a sheet of white paper; a portrait of the bandleader and composer Duke Ellington; Billy Strayhorn, who collaborated with Ellington for about thirty years; and an unidentified woman holding some books. The mural’s lead artist was Frank Parga, a well-known painter who has done murals throughout the city. Cross the street and on the next block at 467 W. 142nd Street, you’ll see Our Lady of Lourdes Church, a fine example of Victorian Gothic architecture, built around 1903. The Brotherhood/Sister Sol is located at W. 143rd Street and is an excellent example of the many community organizations that exist 40\n\nHAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\nthroughout New York. Funded by a variety of foundations and corporations, its dedicated staff provides a home away from home for kids who come from broken families, providing love and comfort. But it also has many programs that help youngsters grow academically and professionally. Those who benefit from its services come mostly from Harlem and range in age from seven to twenty-seven. It’s a true success story, with 88 percent of the youngsters graduating from high school and 85 percent admitted to college. I speak with Nando Rodriguez, the Environmental Program Coordinator, who gives me a more personal portrait of what the group does. “We run all sorts of activities for the children. We recently took a group of kids to Brazil for a month. And they prepared for six months before they went. We think of slavery as a US thing. But now they learn it existed in Brazil too. It would normally cost about $5,000 to take someone there, but for them it’s free. We have art projects here. They take a picture of themselves and then create a self-portrait. We have taken teenage gang members and turned them into college grads.” “What about the garden? It looks like there’s a lot happening here.” “There is. We grow all sorts of stuff and they learn that things can grow here just like they do on a farm and just like rich suburban residents do in their gardens. And they learn responsibility by working on projects. We have a rock-climbing wall, turtles and fish, and a waterfall. We teach them about hydroponics. The garden is named in memory of Frank White, who many years ago chased gang members from the block who wanted to take it over. Tragically, he was shot to death in a drive-by.” This last comment illustrates how attempts to change the dynamics of a community in an area like this have faced incredible challenges. Those who reside here lived with danger every day in years past, and there are still pockets of crime. The area between 144th and 141st Streets contains some of Hamilton Heights’ prettiest side streets, with brownstones, limestones, and HAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\n41\n\nrow houses of every description. Among the nicest are the Flemish and Tudor homes between 142nd and 145th Streets on Convent Avenue. They’re right near City College of New York, and some of them are home to faculty members. From 141st to 137th Street are the iconic buildings of City College’s eleven-block campus. It’s a Gothic masterpiece made of Manhattan dark gray schist, its buildings adorned with terracotta accents. It has recently been refaced and restored to its former glory. In front of the buildings on the right side there’s a quad where students lie on the grass, enjoy lunch, and generally hang out. By coincidence, I spot the former Secretary of State Colin Powell having, as I learn, an impromptu conversation with some students who have stopped him just to talk. In 2013, the school inaugurated the Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership, and he visits there whenever he can. As I walk through the campus I listen to the students as they chat animatedly with each other. The school is today considered an excellent academic institution and its student body includes many people who cannot afford private college tuition and who consider City College to be their Harvard. They represent 160 nationalities, speaking ninety languages. The college has also produced ten Nobel laureates. This also happens to be the college where I have taught for forty-five years. Way back in 1973, when I first arrived, I found the college to be a polarized place. One indication of this was seating patterns in the school cafeteria. The tables were largely segregated, with Asian, white, Hispanic, and black students eating in separate groups. Today, it’s the opposite. Students sit together and tensions are much less in evidence, though there are occasional flare-ups. At 135th Street, I turn right and head over to Riverside Drive, turning right again to walk the drive along a beautiful promenade that runs in front of Riverside Park. People are sitting on park benches eating, reading, or people-watching, just as they do all along the Drive, from 72nd street all the way to 125th street. A half-mile north, I see the entrance to Riverbank State Park, located 42\n\nHAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\nat 145th Street. It’s one of the few parks run by the state and not the city. Unlike city parks, dogs are not allowed, but other than that it’s a marvelous facility. It features an Olympic-size pool and a rink for both roller and ice skating, depending on the season. There’s swimming all year round with classes and lessons, as well as a kayaking program. Cultural programs include art, band, guitar, keyboard, songwriting, ballet, dance, belly dancing, chess, quilting, and sewing classes. There’s also a special sports program for “little athletes” that includes ice skating and ice hockey. In addition to all this, there’s an 800-seat cultural theater for concerts and other performances, a 2,500-seat athletic complex, docking facilities for boats, playgrounds, and picnic areas. In short, it’s a state-of-the-art facility with lots to do that serves an area made up of people from every socioeconomic level. As I leave the park and continue my walk up the Drive, an elderly woman catches my eye. She’s from Haiti, it turns out, and loves the neighborhood. “I’m a niece of former Haitian President Magliore and I’ve lived here a long time and things are really getting better. More middle-class and rich people are moving in and it’s safer. But I worry about what will happen to the poor people.” It’s a legitimate concern. Hamilton Heights is part of a long swath of a low-income, predominantly Hispanic area stretching from W. 135th Street, starting in West Harlem, through Washington Heights, and then Inwood, a length of ninety blocks. What will happen to these people as the area becomes more upscale? The rents will rise way beyond what people can afford, as will prices in the local stores. Where will those displaced go? Will they only find living quarters in less-safe areas or in communities out in, say, Suffolk County, Long Island, where they’ll be far away from the jobs they now have? Much will depend on the city’s housing policies and the degree to which they are implemented. At 147th Street, I turn right and go up a steep hill to the Sugar Hill area. If you want to see how verdant and lush some of the backyards are here, you need only stand on the eastern side of Convent HAMILTON HEIGHTS\n\n43\n\nAvenue between 146th and 147th Streets and look at those that are visible from that vantage point. All manner of flora and fauna grow there, and people have flower boxes, latticed fences, soft electric globes to light up the evening, benches, and picnic tables. Black squirrels scamper up and down the trees—a whole life going on here that isn’t visible from the sidewalks. I turn right from Convent at 147th Street toward St. Nicholas Avenue, and find myself passing what is one of the best examples of the brownstones that prevail here, along with row houses. The wooden doors are polished to a high sheen; the windows are crystal clear. Henri Fouchaux, perhaps the most outstanding architect in this part of Harlem, designed "
