        "text": "The Times Square area is one of the most iconic parts of New York and one of the most popular places to stay for sightseers. Centrally located to many of the biggest attractions, Times Square is in roughly the same area as the Theater District and the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. This part of New York has everything!\n\nTimes Square itself is one of the world's most famous tourist attractions. You'll be within walking distance from attractions like Ripley's Believe it or Not and Madame Tussaud's New York. From Times Square, you're just a brief walk from major Broadway theaters in the city including the Shubert Theatre, the Minskoff Theatre, the Winter Garden Theatre, and the New Amsterdam Theatre.\n\nIf you like to eat good food when you're on vacation, you won't be disappointed by the offerings of Hell's Kitchen. This area of the city is notorious for its culinary offerings and offers world-class cuisine from all over the globe.\n\nStay in the Times Square and Theater District neighborhood if you want to be conveniently located to attractions like the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center and also hit a few Broadway shows during your stay.\n\nChelsea is located to the south of Hell's Kitchen, extending from around 15th Street to 38th Street on the west side of Manhattan. If you're wondering where to stay in New York City to fully experience the arts and culture scene, Chelsea delivers.\n\nKnown as one of NYC's premier artsy destinations, Chelsea is filled with tons of art galleries that rival the MoMA and fine dining restaurants. If you stay in this neighborhood, one of its highlight attractions is Chelsea Market, a historical area that's home to a variety of eating establishments and little shops that sell fresh produce, meats, baked goods, crafts by local artisans, and more.\n\nAnother attraction that's convenient to Chelsea hotels is the Chelsea Piers Sports & Entertainment Complex on the Hudson River. This is a sporting complex offering a spa, indoor soccer fields, a rock climbing wall, ice skating rinks, and a marina. Chelsea is also not too far from attractions like the Empire State Building, the Broadway theaters, and Rockefeller Center.\n\nUnion Square is centrally located toward the southern tip of Manhattan. It is just east of Chelsea and northeast of Greenwich Village. The Flatiron building, which was constructed in the early 20th century, is arguably the most iconic sight in this part of the city.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of the Union Square/Flatiron area is that it is located at a central hub of the New York City subway system, making it a convenient place to stay for those who are planning on getting around by subway.\n\nTip: Union Square/Flatiron is a good option for an area to stay if you want to hit both Midtown attractions like Times Square and the Empire State Building, plus major attractions way downtown like the Statue of Liberty and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum.\n\nThe Financial District is located at the southern tip of Manhattan. This area offers vacationers more peace and quiet than more bustling neighborhoods like the Theater District and Chelsea. However, the Financial District is also home to some New York attractions most vacationers won't want to miss.\n\nMost people who sightsee in New York these days will want to see the emotionally charged World Trade Center Complex and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, which recognizes one of the most important events in New York's history. The Financial District is close to other important historical attractions like the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe Financial District is the home of Wall Street and perhaps one of the most important business hubs in New York City and the entire world.\n\nHistorically, the Upper East Side (UES) has been home to the crème de la crème of New York society. This is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city with some of the most valuable real estate. The UES is also an ideal place to stay if art and culture are what is drawing you to New York.\n\nIt's convenient for visiting the Museum Mile, home to some of the best art museums in the city. This stretch of Fifth Avenue runs along the East side of Central Park and is home to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim. In addition to the art museums, Central Park itself is very accessible to hotels on the Upper East Side and is a must-see New York attraction."
