I have vivid memories of watching this film with my father and afterwards going outside to reenact various scenes from the movie in my backyard. As I grew older, I read numerous books on the Civil War, especially those written by Bruce Catton. In college, I took a class on the Civil War with Dr. James Smallwood at the University of Texas at Tyler. As part of the course requirements, I wrote a paper on Terry’s Texas Rangers. Having recently found a copy of the paper tucked away in one of my file cabinets, I realize now that it was a pitiful scholarly effort, but it did further my academic interest in the subject of Texas’s involvement in the war. Shortly after graduating from UT-Tyler, I viewed Ken Burns’s PBS special The Civil War. I still remember being mesmerized by Burns’s documentary, especially the stories related to the social and cultural aspects of the war. Just as Burns attempted to do in his documentary, I have tried to provide a balance of military, social, and cultural history to explain Texas’s involvement in one of the most pivotal moments in American history. However, I must confess that before I decided to edit this volume, I was actually in the early stages of working on a proposal for an edited volume covering Reconstruction Texas. One night as I discussed various ideas and topics for this project with my close friend James Smallwood, he suggested that I might first consider editing a similar book on the Civil War. Our conversation became the genesis of this volume. During the weeks that followed, I came to the conclusion that Smallwood was right, especially since the sesquicentennial of the war was quickly approaching. As a result, I began work on this volume. Early in this study, readers are introduced to the causes of the Civil War and the motivations behind Texas’s decision to leave the Union. Overwhelmingly, the people of Texas supported the actions of the delegates at the secession convention in a statewide referendum, paving the way for the state to secede from the Union and to officially become the seventh state to join the Confederacy. Quickly after secession, Texans found themselves engaged in a bloody and prolonged civil war against their Northern brethren. During the course of this war, the lives of thousands of Texans, both young and old, were changed forever. This study will examine how Texans experienced the conﬂict. The contributors to this anthology will take us from the battlefront to the home front; from inside the walls of a Confederate prison to inside the walls of the homes of women and viii\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nchildren who were left to fend for themselves while their husbands and fathers were away on distant battlefields; and from the halls of the state capitol to the halls of the county commissioner’s court in Colorado County. Some scholars might question the need for another study of the Civil War, especially considering the large volume of works already in print. I would answer their question by saying that it is indeed time to revisit the role that Texas played in the war. Currently, the most comprehensive anthology of the Civil War experience of Texans is Ralph Wooster’s Lone Star Blue and Gray: Essays on Texas in the Civil War. I have used Dr. Wooster’s book many times in preparing classroom lectures and find it a treasure trove of information. Having said this, I also recognize that it is now time for a new volume on Texas in the Civil War. While Dr. Wooster did a masterful job of editing his anthology of previously published articles, one cannot help but notice that the most recent article included in his work was published in 1991. A breakdown of the articles reveals that the majority of the articles were published prior to 1980. As such, I believed that a new volume was needed—one that benefited from the wealth of scholarly research that has been compiled on the subject over the last two and half decades. This study provides new facts and interpretations about well-known battles that took place in or near Texas, such as the Battle of Galveston, the Battle of Nueces, the Battle of Sabine Pass, and the Red River Campaign. At the same time, the anthology includes new research on the social and cultural aspects of the war, including the experiences of women, African Americans, Union prisoners of war, and frontier troops. In the early process of organizing this volume, I became aware that my friend and colleague Dr. Charles Grear of Prairie View A&M University was in the process of editing a similar book on Texans and the Civil War. After lengthy conversations with Dr. Grear regarding the themes and subjects that he planned to cover in his volume, I was able to develop a book very different from that of my colleagues. It is my hope that most readers will view our work as complementary, covering different aspects of similar topics. In fact, it would be a great surprise if both our volumes did not find their places on the shelves of serious scholars of Civil War Texas. While it is impossible for an editor to put together an anthology which represents a perfect balance between topics, The Seventh Star of the Confederacy: Texas during the Civil War comes as close as one can in a single volume. Aside from the scholarly overviews, there are seven chapters that have social and cultural themes and eight chapters that deal with traditional military topics. The chapters of this study are separated into four parts. Part One, “A Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War,” provides a scholarly treatment of the subject. While Alwyn Barr examines the recent schol-\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\narship on Civil War Texas, Archie McDonald provides a basic overview of the war, setting the stage for the articles that follow. Part Two, “The Time for Compromise Has Passed,” examines Texas’s role in the coming of the Civil War. In this section, Dr. Smallwood explores how Texas became engulfed in the secession movement of the 1850s and eventually broke its ties with the Union, while Linda S. Hudson provides a detailed quantitative analysis of Texas membership in the Knights of the Golden Circle and highlights the role that the Military Degree Knights played in the early phase of the war. Part Three, “In Sight of My Enemy,” focuses on Texas battlefronts. The contributors in this section provide coverage of specific events involving the Lone Star State and Texans during the years between 1861 and 1865. John Gorman’s quantitative analysis of the frontier regiments offers insights into the types of men serving on the Texas frontier. His study furthers our understanding of the frontier regiment, a group that has often been neglected in Civil War Texas historiography. Mary Jo O’Rear examines in detail the Battle of Nueces, reminding readers of the consequences that pro-Unionist Germans in Central Texas suffered at the hands of Texas Confederates. Don Willett provides a social account of the Battle of Galveston. His study brings to light new questions about potential pro-Union spies in Galveston and highlights the inept leadership of Confederate commanders at the beginning of the battle. Additionally, his study details the experiences of residents living on Galveston Island during the period of Union occupation. Edward Cotham, Charles Spurlin, and Gary Joiner provide vivid accounts of the few battles that directly impacted Texas society. The authors’ coverage of the battles at Sabine Pass, in the Coastal Bend region, and in the areas affected by General Banks’s Red River Campaign adds to our understanding of the war’s military impact on Texas. Charles Grear and James Smallwood offer valuable insights into two areas that historians have neglected. Grear studies the intricate relationship between white Confederate soldiers and their Indian allies during the war and reveals how their hatred for black troops moved them beyond their traditional contempt for one another. Smallwood’s coverage of Camp Ford provides new insights into daily life inside the camp from the perspective of Union POWs. Part Four, “Political, Social, and Cultural Life during the Civil War,” examines topics of the war that too often have been overlooked by Civil War historians. Here readers are introduced to how the state’s chief executives experienced the war; to the impact of the war on women and African Americans throughout the state; and to how the war shaped the lives of Texans at the local level in Central Texas (Colorado County). Ken Hendrickson explains the hardships that the Civil War governors of Texas faced in protecting the interests of their constituents and at the same time supporting the newly formed Confederacy. Vickie Betts examines the financial difficulties and other burdens that the war\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nplaced on women who struggled to survive while their men were away fighting on distant fronts. Ron Goodwin and Bruce Glasrud’s study provides fresh insights into how black Texans experienced the war. Carol Taylor examines the difficulties that Texas cattle ranchers experienced during their efforts to feed distant Confederate armies, while Bill Stein reveals how the war disrupted the lives of those living in Colorado County.\n\nAcknowledgments Throughout this project I have had the opportunity to work with an exceptional group of scholars. Some of them have had to overcome extraordinary obstacles to complete their chapters. Charles Spurlin became gravely ill while working on his chapter, spending more than three weeks in the hospital. Amazingly, he was the first author to send his completed chapter to me. Gary Joiner suffered a neardebilitating problem with his vision, but he also finished his chapter on time. Where other contributors might have withdrawn from such a project, these men never wavered in their commitment to completing their assigned chapters. They remain my heroes, and I am happy to report that both are recovering from their ailments. My other contributors have also amazed me. Not one of the original contributors withdrew from this project, a rarity when it comes to publishing edited volumes. I express my deepest gratitude to all the contributors for their professionalism and their untiring efforts in making this a meaningful book. I will forever be indebted to each of them. Unfortunately, while this work was in the final stages of production, I learned of the death of Bill Stein, a dear friend and a contributor to this volume. As is the case with many exceptional people, Bill died too young. He will be missed by all who knew him, and I will cherish the friendship that we shared for the rest of my life. This book is dedicated in part to his memory. Also, I greatly appreciate the staff and editors at University of North Texas Press, especially Ron Chrisman. He patiently listened to my idea at the fall 2006 meeting of the East Texas Historical Association and offered many valuable suggestions for making this volume a better book. Chrisman’s belief in this project and professionalism was very comforting during the publication process. Additionally, I want to thank my copy editors, Bonnie Lovell and Karen DeVinney, for improving the readability of the original manuscript. In addition, I want to thank Erin Buenger for being a source of inspiration. As many already know, Erin is the daughter of my former graduate advisor at Texas A&M University, Walter Buenger, and his lovely wife, Vickie. While I was a Ph.D. candidate at TAMU, Dr. Buenger taught me how to be a professional historian, but it was Erin who taught me that life is a precious gift from God. In the summer of 2002, Erin was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer that affects thousands of children across the nation. Since her diagnosis, Erin has fought a determined battle to overcome her disease. During the last few years, I have read the updates that her parents have diligently posted to Erin’s web page. These reports discuss Erin’s progress and reveal important xii\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxiii\n\nmilestones in her life. Through her web page, I have come to the conclusion that Erin is the bravest person that I have ever had the pleasure to know. She not only has continued to successfully battle her disease, but she also has become a crusader for other children suffering from the same ailment. She made trips to Washington, D.C., to talk to members of Congress, helping to convince them to pass the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. In addition, Erin is a model student; she plays soccer; she rides horses; and she is something of an outdoor adventurer. Erin is nothing short of a superhero. Because Erin has provided inspiration to all those who know her, this book is also dedicated to her. Finally, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my family for all their prayers, advice, encouragement, and moral support, and especially to Felesha, my wife, and Zachary and Tyler, my children. They have contributed to this project in their own special way. Despite all the professional assistance that I have received, as the editor, I accept full responsibility for all errors of fact, faulty interpretations, and mistaken conclusions.\n\nPart I A Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nChapter 1 The Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography by Alwyn Barr The Civil War in Texas and Texans in the war have continued to attract both professional and non-professional historians. Especially notable in recent years are the first modern general history of those topics by Ralph Wooster and the first volume providing a visual sense of the people involved in the conflict across the Lone Star State by Carl Moneyhon and Bobby Roberts.1 Thoughtful summaries of historical writings also have appeared in important essays by Randolph B. Campbell and Walter F. Bell. Campbell discussed a broader era from 1846 to 1876 with a focus on non-military topics including “population, the frontier, the economy . . . , social life and social structure, and politics.” He also raised the key questions of how much change occurred and how much continuity remained.2 Bell began after secession and concentrated primarily on writings about military campaigns and leadership, political and economic activities including Confederate-state tensions, and Confederate efforts to control or eliminate Union sentiment.3 Rather than overlap with those works of historiography, this essay will focus on what writings about Texans since 1990 contribute to some of the newer debates and questions raised by Civil War historians. Have other studies clarified our understanding of the reasons for the secession movement that led to war? Social historians have influenced military history by calling for a better sense of the enlisted men, their places in society, and their attitudes about the conflict. Social historians also have encouraged a broader understanding of how the war impacted society, including the roles of women and the status of minorities— African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans. Ultimately all of these questions may be related to the ongoing discussions of how the Union won the war and why the Confederacy lost. Two books clarify specific events of 1860 and 1861 leading to secession. Donald E. Reynolds presents a careful analysis of fires in Texas towns during 1860 that quickly came to be blamed on slaves and abolitionists. Although an unusually hot summer and faulty new matches provided a better explanation, fears by many Texans who remembered John Brown’s raid into Virginia in 1859 2\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\nled to paranoia and a wave of vigilante violence against slaves and Northerners in the Lone Star State. Anti-Republican newspaper editors who favored secession used the fires to promote their cause in Texas and across the South.4 Dale Baum, using statistical analysis, has reviewed the presidential election of 1860 and the secession referendum in 1861. He concludes that Brown’s raid and the fires, often called the “Texas Troubles,” led to the collapse of the Unionist coalition that had elected Sam Houston governor in 1859. Baum also notes economic and religious influences, with wheat farmers, who were often Disciples of Christ, in North Texas counties settled from the Upper South and German Lutherans in Central Texas as the strongest opponents of secession. Kenneth W. Howell offers the most detailed account of the anti-secession efforts by James W. Throckmorton during this period.5 Most writing on the Civil War in Texas has continued to focus on military affairs. Military campaigns and commanders have received further attention that is reviewed appropriately by Walter Bell. Three additional studies that have appeared since his essay deserve comment. Stephen A. Townsend considers the Rio Grande expedition by the Union army and navy that occupied the lower valley and the Texas coast up to Matagorda from November 1863 to March 1864. He concludes that it became the most successful Federal advance into the state by reducing the flow of cotton through Mexico and forcing a more expensive route to Laredo and Eagle Pass. Furthermore, Union forces showed United States’ concern about the French role in the Mexican civil war. Finally, the expedition allowed Unionist A. J. Hamilton to return to Texas at least briefly as its appointed governor. Different views in the Federal high command led to withdrawal of most soldiers in favor of the unsuccessful Red River Campaign in the spring of 1864.6 Historians of the Federal advance up the Red River have presented several accounts that debate the quality of leadership on both sides and whether Confederates could have achieved more with a different strategy. Jeffery S. Prushankin offers a fresh analysis by suggesting that Edmund Kirby Smith employed a Fabian retreat in the style of Joseph E. Johnston that resulted from his need to defend the entire Trans-Mississippi Department. Richard Taylor followed the more aggressive style of Stonewall Jackson as a means of defending his smaller District of Louisiana. Prushankin concludes that their efforts led to Confederate success, while their differences generated a major “crisis in command.” In a broader study, Stephen A. Dupree concludes that Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks attained most goals given him by the Union War Department, but failed as a field commander, especially in efforts to invade Texas.7 Federal focus on more important war goals and questionable decisions about how to invade Texas combined with successful Confederate defense efforts to limit the impact of the conflict on the state.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nTwo biographies further understanding of command by a Texan and by the longest-serving leader of the District of Texas. Thomas W. Cutrer presents Ben McCulloch as an able general based on experience in frontier conflicts, whose opportunity for higher rank in the Confederate army ran afoul of preference by President Jefferson Davis for United States Military Academy graduates. The complexities of commanding the Military District of Texas are explored by Paul D. Casdorph as he discusses the career of John B. Magruder.8 The enlisted men from Texas who fought in the Civil War have received increased attention in the growing number of regimental, brigade, and division histories. Like older accounts of such units, the new studies discuss movements and engagements. Unlike most early unit histories, some of the new volumes explore the group images that emerge from quantitative analysis of the soldiers. By comparing the profiles of units recruited in different areas at varied times a more complex picture begins to appear. Two of the best unit histories provide useful examples and contrasting results. Douglas Hale describes Confederate soldiers recruited in 1861 for the Third Texas Cavalry regiment. They came from families in East Texas counties that averaged almost $13,000 in property, double the level for all families in the state. Slightly over half of the men’s families owned slaves, a direct commitment to the institution and again twice the percentage for families across Texas. With a median age of about 23, only about 20 percent of the men were married with families, which allowed most to pursue more easily a combination of adventure and commitment to a cause. A little over 50 percent of the men had been engaged in aspects of agriculture, compared to about 75 percent of those in the state. Sixty percent had been born in the Lower South, which seemed to generate a stronger commitment to the Confederacy. About 30 percent came from Upper South backgrounds, while less than 10 percent came from the North or another country.9 Almost a year later Confederate leaders raised eleven regiments and a battalion of infantry in East Texas. Richard Lowe describes the men of those units that formed Walker’s Texas Division. Much like the Third Texas Cavalry and other units from the region, over three-fifths came from the Lower South, while about half as many came from the Upper South. Only one in twenty had Northern or immigrant backgrounds. These soldiers differed from the volunteers of 1861 in various ways. They averaged about four years older, with roughly half already heads of families, twice as many as in the Third Texas. They more clearly fit the general pattern of Texans with three-fourths involved in agriculture, but they held only half the amount of wealth as the average family heads across the state. One in five owned slaves, compared to one of four Texans. Thus they proved to be a more middle-class group than the elite young men of the Third Texas. Their motivations appear to have been related\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\nto concern with Union advances and maintaining a stable way of life “including white control of the black underclass.” Randolph B. Campbell, using statistics to analyze soldiers from Harrison County, offers support for most of these conclusions by Lowe and Hale. Campbell adds that a higher percentage of prosperous Texans served the Confederacy than among those of more modest means, which runs counter to the image of a rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight.10 Even greater ethnic and occupational diversity existed among Texas soldiers. Stanley S. McGowen discusses the presence of a company of German immigrants from the Hill Country in the First Texas Cavalry of the Confederate army. Charles D. Spurlin, in his introduction and conclusion to a Confederate soldier’s diary, discusses the German immigrants in some companies of the Sixth Texas Infantry from the Coastal Bend region.11 Jerry D. Thompson, in two new books, reviews and clarifies the roles and attitudes of Mexican Americans in South Texas and Mexicans in Northern Mexico who served in both the Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War as well as in the Mexican civil war of the same period.12 These volumes offer fewer details about the backgrounds of the soldiers, however, which limits comparisons. Regional differences also appear in units from North Texas. In his introduction to the diary and letters of a Confederate officer from Texas, Richard Lowe describes the men of Company H, Ninth Texas Cavalry, as recruited in 1861 from a North Texas county that voted against secession. Most of these young men came from Upper South backgrounds. Their families usually owned small farms with less wealth than the average Texas household. Slaveholders formed just one-sixth of the unit, less than the average for Texas families. Yet their early enlistment probably reflected greater commitment to Confederate views and set them apart from many neighbors who preferred to remain in the Union.13 Many of the same studies contribute to an understanding of the factors that led to a decline in the size of military units and the armies in which they served. Douglas Hale again points to key problems. In the fall of 1861 while still west of the Mississippi River the Third Texas Cavalry faced a wave of illness, primarily measles and typhoid, which left eighteen men dead and 145 discharged. Following reorganization in early 1862, the regiment had been reduced by one-third. Illness killed 9 percent of the cavalrymen during the war. Another 7 percent died on the battlefield, while 16 percent suffered wounds. Fourteen percent became prisoners at some point, with 7 percent listed as deserters. The collective impact can be seen when the regiment entered the Atlanta Campaign in the spring of 1864 with 46 percent of its remaining soldiers listed as absent.14 Lowe in his discussion of the Ninth Texas Cavalry, another regiment in Ross’s Texas Cavalry Brigade, adds that as a result of “disease, death, desertion, and wounds” the brigade had fallen from its initial strength of 4,000 men to 686 present for duty, or less than 20 percent, by November 1864.15\n\n5\n\n6\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nLowe describes similar problems as well as some differences in his history of the infantrymen in Walker’s Division that served in the Trans-Mississippi region. His quantitative analysis suggests that during 1862, the first year of service for those men, disease and illness caused the death or discharge of about 2,300 out of 12,000 soldiers. Perhaps 700 more received discharges because of age. Transfers, resignations of officers, injuries from accidents, and desertions probably removed another 1,000 men from the ranks. The division had been reduced to about 8,000 soldiers by the end of the summer. Similar problems brought the division strength down to 6,000 men, half its original size, by the spring of 1863 before seeing serious combat. Thereafter the men fought in several skirmishes and battles in which over 1,400 men met death or suffered wounds, while more than 700 became prisoners or missing. Periods of desertions resulted from lack of furloughs, supplies, and pay, combined with declining morale after Confederate defeats such as Vicksburg in 1863. Opposition to possible transfer east of the Mississippi River in 1864 caused about 450 men to head home, although officers brought back many and some others later returned. Walker’s Division had been reduced to a little more than one-fourth of it initial size by the end of the Red River Campaign.16 Lowe does not offer a figure for total desertions from the division. M. Jane Johansson, in her history of the Twenty-eighth Texas Cavalry, which had been dismounted to serve in Walker’s command, lists total losses that were below average for the division. The 44 desertions included in her figures, when projected as an average for all twelve regiments, suggest over 500 men absent without leave at some point, which may be a low estimate. Available service records for Confederate units usually do not include figures for the final months of 1864 and early 1865 when desertions increased in many military organizations. Charles Grear suggests that even some soldiers who volunteered early in the war and served east of the Mississippi River left units to protect their families in Texas, especially in those final months. Campbell in his quantitative study of Confederate soldiers from Harrison County adds further complexity to the picture by estimating that about half of the draft-age males in Texas served in some military unit. That falls below earlier projections of 60 to 75 percent, although it is still slightly higher than the average for Union states. About 20 percent of those who joined the military died of disease, illness, or combat. Yet if almost half of military age Anglo Texans did not serve in the army, then approximately 90 percent of them survived the conflict and most could help revive the state’s economy and society after the conflict.17 Because the Third Texas Cavalry faced some combat from 1861 until the end of the war, while Walker’s infantry engaged Union troops from 1863 to 1865, it is difficult to compare their casualty levels. Hale does offer a comparison, however, using the losses of Hood’s Texas Brigade of infantry in the East to conclude that foot soldiers suffered heavier losses than cavalry.18 Another infantry unit,\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\nthe Sixth Texas Infantry that served first in the Trans-Mississippi and later east of the Mississippi River, provides support for that pattern of losses, while adding further complexity. Spurlin shows that 157 men in the regiment died of disease or illness, 83 of them in Union prison camps, with 90 more discharged—about one-fourth of the regiment. Only 19 men deserted, but after Union forces captured the regiment at Arkansas Post, 152 men agreed to declare allegiance to the United States. Furthermore, 116 men obtained reassignment to other duty. Together these groups composed over a quarter of the regiment. Those killed in combat numbered 60, while 157 suffered wounds and 75 became prisoners of war separately after Arkansas Post—almost a third of the regiment. The combined losses totaled 826 men, over 80 percent of the original enlistments.19 Histories of units from areas outside of East Texas reveal more varied patterns. Richard McCaslin describes the Eleventh Texas Cavalry, raised in North Texas, as composed in part of prewar Unionists who shifted their support to the Texas state government in 1861, primarily to defend the frontier against possible Indian raids. Other members of the regiment had favored secession after the 1860 fires and fears of an abolitionist-inspired slave revolt. When the governor transferred the unit to the Confederate commander in Texas, who ordered the men to Arkansas, more than 20 percent refused to extend their service although many paid for substitutes to fill their places. Temporary conversion of the regiment to infantry in early 1862, followed by orders to cross the Mississippi River, led to numerous desertions, discharges for health reasons, and resignations by officers. The regimental strength fell from almost 800 to about 250 in three months. New recruits did allow the unit to survive and continue service east of the Mississippi.20 National background also played a role in shaping commitment. German immigrants formed companies that served in Confederate regiments with results that varied according to circumstances. McGowen explains that a company of Germans from the Hill Country served on the nearby frontier and in South Texas except for a few weeks in Louisiana during the Red River Campaign as part of the First Texas Cavalry. Probably they felt more comfortable because a German immigrant colonel, Augustus Buchel, led the regiment for a year.21 Terry Jordan edited letters from an Austin County German immigrant company that participated in the service of the Fourth Texas Cavalry from New Mexico to Texas and Louisiana.22 Walter Kamphoefner explains that German immigrants formed three companies for Waul’s Legion, with most from Austin County. When Union troops captured one company, however, several of the men signed the oath of allegiance to the United States. In similar fashion German immigrants from DeWitt and Victoria counties provided one company and half of another in the Sixth Texas Infantry. When the men of that regiment became prisoners of war at Arkansas\n\n7\n\n8\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nPost in 1862, most of the German soldiers also signed oaths of support for the Union.23 Two new studies by Jerry Thompson consider the divided and sometimes shifting allegiance of Mexican Americans in South Texas.24 More German immigrants and Mexican Americans served in Confederate units than for the Union, in part because of social pressure, conscription, and practical decisions about what action would create the least disruption in their lives. Some had assimilated to Anglo Texas society, while others changed sides when faced with new circumstances such as capture and prison camps. Others made the more difficult effort to leave the state and join the Union army. Some Civil War historians, such as Richard E. Beringer, Herman Hattaway, Archer Jones, and William N. Still, Jr., have argued that declining levels of men present for duty in Confederate armies reflect desertion and contributed to final defeat. Other historians, especially Gary Gallagher, have focused on low desertion statistics for some units to counter that view.25 Valuable studies of Texas units reveal a more complex picture. Desertions remained under 10 percent in units raised early in the war, especially from East Texas when slavery and Southern culture dominated. Greater levels of desertion and shifting allegiance appeared in units recruited in Texas counties near the state borders and frontiers, particularly after passage of the conscription law and in areas settled from the Upper South and by German immigrants and Hispanics with less commitment to Southern institutions and society. Civil War historians have been aware that more soldiers died of disease and illness than were killed on battlefields or died of their wounds. The figures for Texas units confirm that impact, but also clarify the significance of numerous discharges based on illness, disability, and age for men who could not sustain active duty. Other men gained transfers or temporary assignments to different units or duty. Together these losses reduced the size of units to one-third or one-fourth of their initial numbers by 1864, levels that clearly undercut the chances of final success. While Union regiments in general suffered similar losses, they still could be replaced because of a larger manpower pool. Richard Beringer and his coauthors, who emphasize the impact of internal issues within the Confederacy as causes for defeat, focus less on states’ rights and more on the incomplete formation of Confederate nationalism. They also suggest that defeats in the later stages of the war raised doubts among Confederates about slavery and their religious belief that God was on their side. Wooster and Bell devote attention to the tensions between Texas Governor Pendleton Murrah and Confederate military commanders in Texas and the Trans-Mississippi Department during the latter stages of the war. They clashed over transfer of state troops to the Confederate army and which level of government would regulate the cotton trade through Mexico. These issues created distractions for all involved.\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\nDale Baum applies quantitative analysis to wartime elections that often revolved around support for or opposition to the Confederate government as it expanded its powers. Other issues helped produce mixed results, although supporters of the Davis administration proved more successful. Even Governor Murrah defeated a candidate who was more critical of the Confederacy.26 John Anthony Moretta, in his biography of William Pitt Ballinger, adds to the sense of political complexity. Ballinger, a prewar lawyer and Unionist, served the Confederacy as a receiver of the property of alien enemies. Yet he experienced growing efforts by Texans who for economic reasons hid property owned by, or debts owed to, Northerners. At other times the attorney wrote editorials defending the Confederate conscription acts and martial law, while criticizing Murrah’s efforts to control state troops and the cotton trade. In the debates with state leaders, Confederate nationalism had a firm defender in Ballinger.27 Texas nationalism is offered by Clayton E. Jewett as an explanation for Murrah’s actions in conflict with the Confederate authorities. State efforts to stimulate industry and provide for some societal needs also are cited as aspects of Lone Star nationalism. Yet some of the state activities may be seen as complementary to those of the Confederacy, rather than as acts of separate nationalism. Jewett has posed a new interpretation, but the varied strength of his evidence and arguments leaves room for lively debate. Jewett follows his theme further by editing a complete edition of the memoir by Confederate Senator Williamson S. Oldham of Texas, a strong critic of many activities by the Confederate central government.28 Governor Murrah should be ranked with his counterparts in Georgia and North Carolina as one of the most outspoken defenders of state authority during the war. Despite the Confederate-state tensions, it appears the two sides found at least temporary compromises that kept their differences from reaching the level of major disruption or a full-scale political challenge to Confederate nationalism. Historians of Confederate women, such as Drew Gilpin Faust, have pointed to diverse situations and reactions as some wives and mothers sought to maintain traditional gender roles while others faced new conditions that forced varied degrees of change in roles and attitudes.29 Two published collections of letters from the wives of East Texas slaveholders reveal their concerns and views. In a volume edited by Erika Murr, the role of planter’s wife appeared to create frustrations for Lizzie Neblett even before the war. The conflict increased the tension she experienced with her absent spouse, Will, their children, and her own failings. A sense of isolation as well as difficulties in directing slaves and finding an acceptable overseer became topics for letters that at times urged her husband to come back to his family.30 M. Jane Johansson has edited letters written by Harriet Perry, who worried about similar problems as well as childbirth and fears that her husband might be killed in the war. Moving in with relatives helped her morale, however, as did her decision to hire out slaves. The illness of\n\n9\n\n10\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nher children and deaths in the family added distress as did inflation and shortages. Yet she did become increasingly involved in family economic decisions with advice from her husband and father.31 Richard Lowe provides additional insights into women’s attitudes in his chapter on the exchange of letters between husbands in Walker’s Division and their wives. He notes Neblett’s views, but also those of other wives who offered reassurances, encouragement, and affection to sustain the soldiers’ morale.32 Joleene Maddux Snider describes the less common case of Sarah Devereux, a planter’s wife who had assumed direction of the plantation when her husband, Julien, died before the war. Previously she had borne and raised children, served as a plantation mistress, whose duties including supervising house servants, and participated in a local church. When her husband had to travel out of town, she had shared direction of the field workers with an overseer and also had paid bills. While she functioned within the family concept of gender roles while he lived, her wider range of experiences allowed her to operate a profitable plantation after his death. The Civil War brought new concerns including higher taxes, impressments of some slaves to labor for the government, and worry about sons who were nearing military age. Yet she survived the conflict and, according to Snider, “expanded her concept of the boundaries of southern femininity.”33 Angela Boswell offers the most analytical account of Texas women during the war in her study of their lives in Colorado County. Family problems ranged from men absent in the army, including some who died, to inflation and shortages. As a result, widows, single women, and some wives of soldiers had to make economic decisions even though that overlapped the realm of men’s gender roles. With acceptance by most men, women created debts, leased and sold slaves and land, and directed slave labor. Some worked to operate farms. Others requested and received local government aid in feeding their families. Although divorce did not become extensive, it did increase in the immediate postwar years. Boswell concludes that the women accepted the Southern ideal in gender roles, but expanded their right to act, with the goal of sustaining the family, when husbands could not or did not fulfill their roles.34 These new studies focus on the East Texas region where Southern ideas about gender roles would be strongest and consider primarily upper- and middle-class women whose attitudes would be more fully shaped by those roles. East Texas also avoided Federal invasion, which created greater disruption and change in several regions of the Confederacy. In other areas of Texas greater conflict as well as social, economic, and ethnic differences probably created a greater range of conditions and attitudes for women. Texas towns remained small in the 1860s compared to southern river and seaports such as New Orleans and Mobile. Yet their significant place in trade and government activities gave them a potential influence beyond their size. Alwyn Barr has explored the impact of war on Galveston, the state’s leading\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\n11\n\nport and second-largest town, which faced a Union blockade throughout the war and a brief occupation in late 1862. Many civilians became refugees to Houston and other inland towns, while Confederate soldiers garrisoned the island community. Blockade runners came and went sporadically, although trade and employment declined. Churches and schools closed at times and then reopened. Soldiers and their wives protested the quality of supplies and food provided by the army, with wives being temporarily ordered off the island as a result. Yellow fever added further disruption. Some slaves escaped to Union ships or joined whites in robbery gangs. The activities of women became more diverse including the operation of some new businesses. Postwar Galveston adjusted to the end of slavery and revived with renewed trade, however, at a faster pace than many rural areas.35 Houston citizens increased their economic activities during the war, explains Paul A. Levengood, as a result of Galveston’s problems and new trade through Mexico. Consumer goods remained available despite some shortages and inflation. White refugees, often with slaves, increased the population. New businesses opened and established ones expanded. Cultural and charitable activities continued, as did schools and both white and black churches. Mary M. Cronin discusses R. R. Gilbert who wrote humorous articles for Texas newspapers that helped relieve some of the wartime tensions.36 Some Austin businessmen also conducted trade through Mexico, including business with Northern cities, as noted by Peyton O. Abbott, who edited the diary of an Austin merchant. David C. Humphrey shows that Austin suffered problems in acquiring accurate information about wartime events—especially battles. The Union blockade and a lack of rail and telegraph connections led to frequent confusion and misinformation. Confederate editors censored some news favorable to the Federal cause, probably because of the large number of Unionists in the community. Austin Confederates often celebrated early reports of victories that sometimes proved to be defeats. Thus civilian morale fluctuated wildly at times. Both Confederates and Unionists became doubtful of all news stories. After Federal forces gained control of the Mississippi River, Texas newspapers had to rely more and more on information in the Northern press about events east of that river, despite doubts about accuracy. Better reporting of Confederate victories on the Texas coast could boost morale, while fears of Union invasion in South Texas produced alarm. Humphrey suggests that perhaps the dominant themes became isolation, grasping at rumors, and doubt.37 Depending on location and local conditions, urban experiences in Texas ranged from disruption to prosperity to isolation and confusion. Randolph B. Campbell and other historians have described the impact of the Civil War on slavery in Texas as limited because Union armies did not penetrate East Texas where most slaves labored. Campbell also points to the\n\n12\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\ngrowth of the institution since white refugees brought slaves into the state to avoid their emancipation by advancing Federal forces in Arkansas and Louisiana. The Confederate army did impress slaves to construct earthworks for defense of coastal towns. As a result some planters expressed concern for the loss of labor, while slaves might face disease and dangers in new locations. Late in the war some owners sold slaves fearing their loss if the Union won, although others continued to buy bondsmen in the spring of 1865. Some slaves did continue to escape to Mexico, into towns, or to the Union navy, while others resisted slavery in individual acts.38 As Alwyn Barr has noted, some slaves facing less supervision during the conflict did in subtle ways assume more control over punishment, work pace, and their daily lives. Milton Holland, the free black son of a Texas planter and a slave mother, had been sent north for an education. He later volunteered for the Union army and as a sergeant in Virginia during 1864 received the Congressional Medal of Honor for leadership in battle.39 Historians in recent years have begun to explore more fully the instances in which Confederate soldiers shot down African Americans in the Union army who tried to surrender like other men when surrounded by the opposing army. Some Texas Confederates participated along with other troops in such actions at Poison Spring in Arkansas as well as others in the Indian Territory and Louisiana. Racial ideas and prewar fears of slave revolts apparently produced the strong emotions that led to these tragic excesses. After Poison Spring, black troops retaliated during the battle at Jenkins’s Ferry in Arkansas.40 In 1864 and 1865 Confederate military and government leaders debated the possibility of trying to recruit slaves for their army by promising some individual freedom for those who served. Philip D. Dillard offers a comparison of attitudes in Lynchburg, Virginia, and Galveston, Texas, on the proposal. In Lynchburg, close to heavy fighting in the final months of conflict, support emerged for the proposal, even though it might undercut the original reason for secession. By contrast, most Confederates in Galveston, facing no immediate threat at that time and less aware of precarious Confederate fortunes elsewhere, opposed the action as unnecessary and disruptive of society. Neither the few Galveston supporters of using black soldiers nor their numerous critics suggested that any guilt about the mistreatment of slaves influenced their views. Dillard concludes that greater war pressures had created stronger Confederate nationalism in Virginia than in Texas.41 Without a Union invasion, slavery in Texas appeared less disrupted as an institution than in most Confederate states, despite the hopes of slaves and the fears of some slaveholders. No sense of guilt about the treatment of slaves appears in the newly published collections of letters by women and their husbands in the Confederate army. The only mentions of religious concerns appear in descriptions of revivals among soldiers in 1863 and 1864. Thomas W. Cutrer has edited the letters\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\n13\n\nwritten to newspapers in Texas by Robert F. Bunting, the chaplain of the Eighth Texas Cavalry, known as Terry’s Rangers. Bunting preached to the soldiers, buried the dead as crusading martyrs, and tried through his letters to sustain civilian morale.42 It does not appear that concerns about slavery or religion played an important role in undermining Confederate morale among Texans. Gary Gallagher has argued that Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia through their early successes in 1862 and 1863 became the most important symbols of Confederate nationalism. Gallagher believes that view outweighed economic, social, and political concerns and helped maintain the morale of Confederates into the spring of 1865.43 His evidence comes primarily from the eastern Confederacy, therefore it seems useful to consider whether the new studies of Texans in the West support that concept. Humphrey suggests that the mood of Austinites rose and fell with victories and defeats wherever they might occur, with frequent confusion as the result of false rumors. Events along or near the Mississippi River, such as the Union capture of Vicksburg, or attacks along the Texas coast seemed to stir the strongest responses. Texas soldiers in the West seemed to share those views. In their letters, Lizzie and Will Neblett and Theophilus and Harriet Perry reflected a variety of views about Lee that ranged from hopeful to worried in 1863 and 1864. The only clear exception to these patterns was Gideon Lincecum, the author of letters edited by Jerry Bryan Lincecum, Edward Hake Phillips, and Peggy A. Redshaw. Lincecum, an ardent Confederate, criticized Unionists, speculation, Confederate impressment, and wealthy families helping sons avoid conscription, while recognizing public discontent with government leaders. Yet he retained confidence in Lee as late as March 1865 and, perhaps wishfully, thought others shared his view. Among Texans in the Trans-Mississippi Department, Lee’s image appeared positive but less reassuring than in the East because it was overshadowed by events closer to home.44 If trade through Mexico and the absence of a Federal invasion allowed East Texas to live with fewer problems and frustrations than many other regions of the Confederacy, the same cannot be said of most border regions in Texas. Political differences in the state led to fears and violent suppression of dissent that reveal some limits of Confederate nationalism. Some Texas Unionists accepted the judgment of secession, while others left the state, served in frontier defense units, or avoided participation in the war until passage of the first Confederate conscription act in early 1862. Richard McCaslin has written a thorough and analytical account of the most striking event that followed. In North Texas counties that opposed secession, desertions and opposition to the draft led to talk of organizing a Peace Party. A pro-Confederate vigilante committee in the fall of 1862 seized about 150 men, formed an extralegal court and under mob pressure hanged 22 men in Cooke County north of Dallas. The killing of a\n\n14\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nConfederate officer brought a new wave of retaliation including 24 more deaths by lynch law. Government leaders at last reestablished a degree of order. Some military officers continued to harass and kill dissenters over the following year. Confederate and state policy later shifted from hunting Unionists to accepting them for frontier defense units. McCaslin suggests that seeking order through vigilante tactics only led to more disorder.45 Another volume, by David Pickering and Judy Falls, extends the study of Union dissent and pro-Confederate violent opposition to Hunt and Hopkins counties east of Dallas. There too vigilantes rounded up dissenters who then faced a sham trial and hanging. Other Unionists hid in thickets to avoid similar treatment. Postwar efforts to bring vigilantes to justice failed as sympathizers helped them escape jail or manipulate the judicial system.46 Walter Kamphoefner extends the story of Unionist opposition to conscription into the central and southeastern Texas counties with large German immigrant populations, noting the Confederate use of martial law in both areas. The memoir of a Hill Country German American, edited by David R. Hoffman, lends support to that view. Stanley S. McGowen clarifies the confrontation on the Nueces River in 1862 as an attack by Confederate troops on armed Unionists headed for Mexico who initially defended themselves. Later, however, some Confederates did execute at least nine wounded Unionists. In a new general account of desertion in the Confederacy, Mark A. Weitz confirms the presence of men avoiding the draft or deserting into Mexico from Central and South Texas.47 When the United States Army withdrew from forts in West Texas after secession in 1861, the state government sought to replace them with Texas troops who would help recent settlers control areas still claimed by American Indians. A retreat by settlers of up to 100 miles resulted from Indian raids during the war according to the standard view of earlier histories about the Texas frontier. David Paul Smith in a thoughtful study clarifies three stages of Confederate and state efforts, which involved no more than a thousand men at any time. Debate over control of troops on the frontier did add to the tension between Confederate military commanders and Governor Murrah, resulting in a shortterm compromise. The tasks of the soldiers in West Texas became more complex as growing numbers of Confederate deserters, Unionists avoiding conscription, and outlaws appeared in some parts of the region. While the defense units withdrew to a second line of forts, Smith argues that the farms and ranches of most settlers lay behind that line and did not have to be abandoned. He concludes that frontier defense during the war proved comparable to that of the prewar period. Glen Sample Ely adds further complexity by arguing that Unionists, including some frontier defense rangers, left for California amid growing chaos in 1864–1865, a time in which frontier ranchers also sold cattle to the Union army in New Mexico.48\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\n15\n\nGary Clayton Anderson presents a different perspective on West Texas during the Civil War period in his volume on Anglo-American efforts to drive Native Americans out of Texas in the nineteenth century. He describes harsh winters and summer droughts that caused the deaths of many Plains Indians as well as their horses and left them too weakened to push back the advance of Anglo settlement. Instead he offers evidence of organized white outlaws stealing horses and trying to throw the blame on Native Americans. Men associated with political and military leader John R. Baylor seem to have played active roles in these schemes. Both Confederate and Union efforts in the Indian Territory to provide food for Indians also reduced their need to raid. Anderson agrees with Smith in focusing more attention on the struggle between loyal Unionists and Confederate troops and vigilantes, as well as on some Indian raids conducted for the purpose of taking cattle and other foodstuffs that were needed to feed starving tribes in the Indian territory.49 A synthesis of the conclusions in these studies may lead to a better-balanced understanding of wartime events on the frontier. A comparison of the Confederate-Indian relations with the Union-Indian relations across the West, as described by Alvin M. Josephy, suggests that the larger numbers of Union volunteers made greater inroads on Indian lands than the Confederates in Texas.50 Historians of Anglo-Indian relations in postwar Texas usually have described a time of increasing conflict. Additional studies of Reconstruction have added a sense of widespread racial violence directed at the newly freed African Americans and white Unionists as a means of reasserting Confederate dominance. Other volumes extend the study of violence by exploring the use by outlaws of Confederate imagery to gain public support. One book by Barry Crouch, Larry Peacock, and James M. Smallwood and another by Crouch and Donaly E. Brice focus on Northeast Texas, while a third volume, by Smallwood, considers the South Central region of the state. In a more sweeping analysis William D. Carrigan suggests that repeated spasms of violence and vigilantism over time, including the prewar fire scare, the extralegal wartime hangings, frontier fighting, and Reconstruction murders created a culture in which lynching would continue to be acceptable into the early twentieth century.51 This may provide a partial answer to the question by Randolph Campbell about patterns of continuity in a period of change. Several additional studies of the Civil War in Texas and Texans in the war provide a variety of fresh insights into the attitudes and actions of soldiers and civilians during the period. Relating those views and activities to larger questions about secession, soldiers’ commitments, and the impact of war on women, ethnic minorities, Confederate nationalism, and factors in victory or defeat seems more daunting and open to debate. Books related to secession in Texas suggest that fears of slave revolt and abolitionists clearly strengthened the\n\n16\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nseparatist movement. Significant reductions in soldiers present for duty probably did weaken Confederate armies late in the war. Yet health and fitness problems joined battle losses as apparently having greater impacts than desertion in East Texas units with the strongest Deep South background and commitment to slavery and the Confederate cause. Higher levels of desertion or shifts of allegiance existed in units from border areas of the state that were less involved with Southern culture and institutions. Unionist-Confederate tensions contributed to greater disruption and conflict in those areas. Additional studies suggest that responses of Texas women to the war ranged from frustrations to subtly expanded roles for meeting new problems and managing family economic affairs. With no Federal advance into most of Texas and continued trade through Mexico, women and other civilians in East Texas seem to have faced fewer disruptions than their counterparts in many Confederate states. Under those circumstances, concerns about the treatment of slaves and a loss of God’s support in the war seem to have had little impact on the attitudes of Confederate Texans. With fewer military and economic pressures, perhaps Texans and their leaders felt less need for stronger Confederate nationalism in the form of controls over state troops or the possible recruiting of slaves as soldiers. The desire of Texas soldiers in the Trans-Mississippi Department to protect their families is understandable, even when it led to temporary desertions during 1863 and 1864 in response to the possibility their units might be sent across the Mississippi River. Since Confederate defeat ultimately occurred east of the Mississippi, however, their reluctance to serve farther from home could be interpreted as a form of regionalism and a further limitation on Confederate nationalism. To the questions of continuity or change in this era there are at least two additional answers. The reoccurring instances of violence and vigilante activity across the state from the secession period throughout the war and into Reconstruction suggest a tragic example of continuity in an era of change. On a more positive note, more men seem to have survived the war than was once thought, which contributed to a more rapid revival of the postwar Texas economy and society. Discussions of change and continuity in the Civil War period can be enlivened by also considering some of the thoughtful studies about the interaction of popular myth and history. One volume on that topic offers two essays related to what appear to be contrasting popular myths, one supporting continuity and one favoring change. Kelly McMichael describes the campaign in the early twentieth century by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to build monuments honoring Confederate soldiers. Yet she sees that effort as also aimed at recognizing women’s contributions to the Lost Cause and developing their own cultural influence, albeit with mixed results. Elizabeth Hayes Turner discusses Juneteenth, the annual African American celebrations of emancipation,\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Impact of New Studies about Texas and Texans on Civil War Historiography\n\n17\n\nthat kept alive hope of equality through years of discrimination.52 Each essay, one clearly and the other with subtlety, reflect changes that for Texans began primarily in the Civil War era.\n\nNotes Ralph A.

McDonald Union with the United States lost its luster for many Texans during the decade of the 1850s. Against the backdrop of such separating wedges as disagreement with the enforcement of the Compromise of 1850 and resulting disenchantment over their loss of so much western land, the strident activity of abolitionists, and especially the violence in Kansas, many Texans reflected their Southern heritage by affirming their belief in states’ rights, especially as that related to slavery, and their acceptance of the principle of secession as the ultimate expression of that right. Hardin R. Runnels’s victory over Sam Houston in the governor’s race in 1857 can be traced to this feeling, but Houston’s victory in 1859 over Runnels came despite it. The legislature’s selection of Louis T. Wigfall, an ardent fireeater and secession advocate, to Houston’s seat in the Senate signifies the mood of the majority more than does the election of “Old Sam Jacinto” to the governorship. He won that office with hard campaigning, which invoked memories of his past leadership, but he never masked his true feelings—he was first and last a Union man. The presidential election of 1860 crystallized Texans into a secession posture. Texas delegates to the Democratic convention in Charleston, South Carolina, including Runnels, Francis R. Lubbock, Guy M. Bryan, R. B. Hubbard, and Tom Ochiltree, joined other Southerners in a demand for a party platform embracing slavery and opposing Stephen A. Douglas’s majority position on popular sovereignty. Since the Dred Scott decision confirmed the right of slave owners to take their property into the territories, Southerners assumed that slavery should be secured forever. But the election of 1860 alarmed them; the prospect of a victory by the new and radical Republican Party, a single-issue group demanding an end to slavery in the territories and eventually an end to it in the states, seemed real. Douglas was nominated by the mainstream Democrats at a second convention in Baltimore, and John Cabell Breckinridge of Kentucky won the nomination of still another group of Democrats meeting at Richmond, Virginia. Most 21\n\n22\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nIllustration 1 Gov. Sam Houston. Courtesy Library of Congress.\n\nTexans supported Breckinridge and joined other Southerners in the threat to leave the Union in the event of a victory by the Republican Party and its nominee, Abraham Lincoln. The Constitutional Union Party entered the contest, hoping to block an electoral majority and force the election into the House of Representatives where a compromise candidate might be selected. Sam Houston tried for the nomination of this party and outdrew John Bell of Tennessee on the first ballot, 57 to 68.5 votes, but when Bell was nominated, Houston thought of running as an independent candidate before finally deciding against such a move. In November, Texans voted for Breckinridge by a margin of three to one, emphasizing the secessionists’ threat to leave the Union in the event of a Lincoln victory. Breckinridge received 47,548 votes to Bell’s 15,463; Douglas received only 410 votes. Lincoln’s name was not on the Texas ballot. In response to the election, on December 20, 1860, South Carolina made good its threat to secede from the American Union. Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana followed by the end of January, and Texas was expected to become the seventh state to secede. It did so over the political corpse of Sam Houston.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Civil War and the Lone Star State: A Brief Overview\n\n23\n\nHouston attempted to ignore the popular clamor for a secession convention that began as soon as news of South Carolina’s action reached the state. When secessionist leaders became convinced that Houston would not call the legislature to consider withdrawal from the Union, they usurped his powers by calling for elections within each judicial district on January 8, 1861, to select delegates for an ad hoc secession convention. Houston then summoned the legislature into session, hoping to steal the thunder of the secessionists. His legislature would meet on January 21, a week before the convention’s delegates met on January 28. Houston hoped the legislature would prevent the convention from gathering, but many legislators were also members of the convention, and a majority of the remainder endorsed it. The convention met in Austin on January 28. That afternoon, delegates elected Oran M. Roberts as their presiding officer and passed a preliminary motion to secede from the Union by a vote of 152 to 6. During the next two days, members of the convention worked out the details of a formal ordinance of secession. A final vote on the ordinance was taken in convention on February 1. The vote was conducted in a tense session, and when James Webb Throckmorton cast a negative vote, hisses and boos rained from the gallery. Throckmorton’s courageous response, “Mr. President, when the rabble hiss, well may patriots tremble,” gave testimony that Houston did not stand completely alone. Unlike the other states of the Lower South, the delegates decided to place their ordinance before the citizens of Texas for final approval. The popular vote took place on February 23. The convention’s declaration of causes for its action for the people’s consideration included criticism of the government’s administration of commonly held territories to the exclusion of Southerners, provocative activity in Kansas, failure to protect Texans from the Indians adequately, Northern hostility to the South and its systems (slavery), the South’s minority status within the Union, and the election of a president committed to the elimination of slavery. With these considerations, the convention adjourned until March 2 to await the result of the election. The argument between secessionists and unionists was bitter. The Galveston News and the Texas Republican backed the secessionists, while the Southerner Intelligencer and the Bastrop Advertiser attacked them, but the outcome was inevitable: 46,129 in support of secession, with only 14,697 opposed. Ten Central Texas counties, a few in North Texas along the Red River, and Angelina County in East Texas, an island in a sea of secessionism, voted no. Every other county voted affirmatively. The convention met again in Austin on March 2, Texas Independence Day, and within three days confirmed separation from the Union and also Texas’s affiliation with the Confederate States of America, newly organized in\n\n24\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nMontgomery, Alabama. The Texas convention had sent unofficial delegates to the Montgomery meeting, and when official word of the secession vote arrived from Texas, the Confederate group voted their acceptance even before a formal request for admission was received. The Texas convention’s work continued. They summoned all elected officials to take an oath of loyalty to the new government on March 16. Houston agonized the entire night of March 15, and the next day, although present in the capitol, sat silently and heard his name called three times to take the oath, then heard his office vacated and his lieutenant governor, Edward Clark, sworn in to complete his term. Lincoln had offered Houston the use of 2,700 Federal troops in Texas under the command of Gen. David Twiggs, but Houston refused. He had fought for Texas, he reasoned, and even when Texas was wrong, he would not fight against her. This romantic pledge paralleled a more practical reason— Houston’s desire to avoid bloodshed. The presence of Twiggs’s command bothered many Texans, and they made an immediate demand for the Union commander to surrender his troops and all Federal property. Twiggs sympathized with the secessionists, and he tried to avoid betraying his oath to the United States by resignation. Before Twiggs was relieved, Ben McCulloch led an armed group to army headquarters in San Antonio and demanded surrender. Twiggs complied to avoid a fight, and his entire command, representing more than 10 percent of all Union forces at the time, in effect became prisoners of war, although war did not then technically exist. Most were exchanged before the fighting began in earnest. The convention also prepared for elections under Confederate statehood. Party activity, present but weak in the 1850s, ceased; the secessionists controlled the state’s affairs completely. Francis R. Lubbock defeated Edward Clark by only 124 votes to become Texas’s first Confederate governor, and John M. Crockett, mayor of Dallas, won the lieutenant governor’s post. Lubbock’s administration supported the Confederate government enthusiastically, but he left after only one term to serve President Jefferson Davis in other capacities. His successor was Pendleton Murrah of Harrison County, who defeated T. J. Chambers by 17,501 to 12,455 votes in 1863. John H. Reagan became Texas’s highest ranking Confederate civilian official when he received appointment as postmaster general in Davis’s cabinet. Louis T. Wigfall and W. S. Oldham represented Texas in the Confederate Senate. Lubbock’s job became largely the work of continuing domestic policies of the Houston-Clark administrations where war conditions permitted, and grappling with new difficulties posed by the conflict. He supported the war effort and the Confederate administration without reservation, organized home guards to fight against Indians on the frontier, mustered soldiers for fighting outside the state, and mobilized the legislature to provide for the state’s needs. Through a\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Civil War and the Lone Star State: A Brief Overview\n\n25\n\nMilitary Board, consisting of the governor, comptroller, and treasurer, Lubbock tried to establish a proper priority: win the war without undue domestic suffering. The board attempted to dispose of bonds of the United States held in Texas to purchase needed military supplies; it also suspended the debtor laws because so many of the state’s workers served in the military, raised local revenue for the support of the military units in the field, and expended Confederate treasury warrants on state needs. Murrah inherited a working state government, but one that suffered the same decline as did its parent government. Lubbock’s administration had doubled state taxes, a heavy blow since so many taxes had been remanded during the 1850s, but still the war demanded more revenue, and needy families of soldiers also increased their demand on the government. Cotton cards were purchased by the state as a relief measure for homemakers to card, spin, and weave their own cotton. A portion of local tax revenues was designated for the relief of the destitute. Murrah remained a thorough Confederate until the end of the war and he presided over the steady decline of the economic productivity of his state while the public debt increased. War’s end coincided with a near collapse of the state’s economy. Texas performed much better in fielding men for military service. Lubbock organized military districts and organized the militia for action under the state’s initial commander, Gen. Earl Van Dorn. Gen. Paul Octave Hébert soon succeeded Van Dorn and was himself replaced in November 1862, following a dispute over the conscription laws, by Gen. John Bankhead Magruder. Texas had no need for conscription in 1861. The census of 1860 revealed over 90,000 men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, and of these an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 served in the military. Over 20,000 volunteered in the first year of the war. Usually a person of wealth organized a unit, financed its first operation, and, for obvious reasons, often was elected as its initial commander. Later, conscription added increased numbers of Texans to the army. The first draft selected men between the ages of 18 and 35, but later drafts expanded to include youths of 17 and older men of 45 and 50. Texas’s most prominent soldier, Albert Sidney Johnston, commanded the Western Theater of the Confederate army until his death at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Other general officers from Texas included Felix Huston Robertson, the only native-born Texan to achieve such rank. Most Texans served outside the state. Lubbock raised thirty-two companies in 1862, calling them the Texas Brigade. They were joined by their first commander, John Bell Hood of Kentucky, later supplemented with units from Arkansas and North Carolina, and fought principally in the Eastern Theater under the command of Robert E. Lee. “My Texans,” as Lee called them, learned that his affection often placed them at the center of his battles. Over 4,000 men\n\n26\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nserved in the unit, but fewer than 700 survived the war. Another notable unit, Terry’s Texas Rangers, commanded by Gen. B. F. Terry, fought primarily in the Western Theater. Lawrence Sullivan Ross’s Brigade, organized later in the war, fought in the Western Theater and in the Trans-Mississippi Department. This department was created in 1863 to provide a separate military organization for the area after the Union regained control of the Mississippi River, thus separating the far west of the Confederacy from its political and economic control center. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith commanded the Trans-Mississippi Department, including Texas, until the end of the war. No major battles occurred within Texas, but many significant actions were fought along its borders. As early as May 1861, W. C. Young led volunteers from the Red River country into Indian Territory to attack Forts Arbuckle, Cobb, and Washita. In August, John R. Baylor led a group into southern New Mexico and proclaimed the territory as far west as Tucson as the Confederate territory of Arizona with himself as governor. And Gen. H. H. Sibley, fortunately with Gen. Tom Green along, successfully attacked Valverde with a force of 2,600 men on February 2, 1862. In March, he met Union forces under Edward R. Canby at Glorieta and was repulsed. This effectively saved New Mexico and Arizona from further Confederate encroachment. The Federal blockade became effective on the Texas coast in July 1861, and Union forces occupied Galveston in October 1862. Magruder attacked them on January 1, 1863, from a troop concentration at Virginia Point, with men on two flat-bottomed riverboats with cotton bales lining the decks for protection. He succeeded in retaking the island, and the Confederate Texans held it until 1865. Texas’s most memorable Civil War battle occurred at Sabine Pass, a narrow inlet from the Gulf of Mexico to Sabine Lake, a saltwater impoundment that received the waters of the Sabine and Neches rivers. Both rivers were navigable to rail lines. In September 1862, Federal naval personnel forced the Confederates to abandon Sabine Pass, but it was soon reoccupied by an artillery battery commanded by Lt. Dick Dowling, a Houston saloonkeeper. When Gen. Nathaniel Banks attempted to send seventeen naval vessels and a force of over 1,500 soldiers through the pass to attack the interior in September 1863, Dowling’s guns disabled two vessels in the main channel, blocking the way for the remainder of the ships, and preventing the disembarking of the Union soldiers. The Battle of Sabine Pass was hailed by Jefferson Davis as the most significant action of the war at a time when he hungered for good news after defeats at Vicksburg and Gettysburg. The battle did have a temporary negative effect on American credit in England. Banks was more successful elsewhere. His forces succeeded in capturing or controlling every port from the Rio Grande to just below Galveston, including Corpus Christi, Aransas Pass, and Indianola.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Civil War and the Lone Star State: A Brief Overview\n\n27\n\nBanks’s last attempt to invade Texas occurred in 1864. He ascended the Red River, intending to rendezvous with forces under Gen. Frederick Steele from Little Rock to capture North Texas. Steele was repulsed by Confederates under Van Dorn, and Gen. Richard Taylor stopped Banks at Mansfield, Louisiana. Some East Texans fought in this action as civilians, often with pikes and clubs, to prevent the invasion of their state. In a final action, John S. Ford led forces against black Union soldiers at Palmito Ranch near Brownsville in May 1865, nearly a month after all other forces had surrendered. During what would be the last battle of the Civil War, the Texans outmaneuvered Union forces under the command of Col. Theodore H. Barrett. Though the battle ended in a Confederate victory, it proved insignificant in changing the outcome of the war. Serious fighting took place between the Texans and Indians during the Civil War. Texans expected the Confederate army to police Indians as the American army had before the war, but the high command in far-off Virginia had too many Union soldiers on their hands to worry about Texas Indians, so Governor Lubbock organized state troops under James M. Norris for this service. Norris attempted regular patrols in the Indian country, but these proved easy for the Indians to evade, so his successor, J. E. McCord, substituted irregular scouting expeditions. As men organized for Indian service, they were repeatedly transferred to the regular army and service outside the state. Finally, J. W. Throckmorton organized a force that included many like himself who would fight Indians but not Union soldiers. The most significant Indian action was at Adobe Walls, where Union and Confederate soldiers combined to fight Comanches, and the most unsuccessful occurred at Dove Creek in January 1864, when 370 state troops attacked 1,400 Kickapoos en route to Mexico from Indian Territory. The Texans’ heavy losses made them regret the attack. Texans who remained at home did not suffer the ravages of war as did their fellow Confederates in Virginia and Tennessee; still, they had problems. Some Texans did not like the Confederate affiliation. Some, such as Houston, remained relatively quiet; others, including financier S. M. Swenson, left the state, depriving Texas of needed leadership both during and after the war; and some, such as E. J. Davis, organized Union forces to fight in Texas. Some Texas Germans disliked the Confederacy because they favored Union nationalism and disliked slavery; often they refused to volunteer or to be conscripted, and some tried to escape to Mexico. One such group was apprehended and massacred. Other Germans did serve in the Confederate army. In 1862 the Peace Party, a secret society, was organized in North Texas. It aroused fear in loyal Confederates who hanged over forty Peace Party members in Gainesville and other places. In 1864 the North Texas area also\n\n28\n\nPart I\n\nA Historical Overview of Texas and the Civil War\n\nbecame a gathering place for army deserters and ne’er-do-wells and posed a police problem for the state. In 1863 a conference of western state representatives in Marshall produced a plan to exchange Confederate cotton in Mexico for needed war materiel. The plan called for the Confederate government to take over the trade by purchasing half of each planter’s cotton and exempting the rest from impressment, to make sure the Confederacy’s major economic resource would contribute to the war effort. Murrah’s government devised an alternate “state plan,” which called for the Texas government to transport cotton to the border, return half to the owner, and secure the remainder with state bonds. The Confederate Congress preempted the state’s power in this area with a specific act, irritating some Texans. Cotton production declined steadily during the war years as more and more men entered the military services. Women, minors, men who were exempt from the draft, and some objectors continued to work and produce as best they could. But as state revenue dwindled and Confederate currency inflated, their lot was often difficult. Such necessities as salt became scarce, and people had to return to their pioneer ways to survive. They used corncob ashes as a substitute for soda; parched rye, okra, or acorns for coffee; and they made their own cloth. Murrah was inaugurated in a homespun suit partially to indicate its acceptability and partially because of its availability. Paper also grew scarce, forcing some newspapers to cease operations. Texas had little industry before the war but developed some from necessity. Arms works were established in Austin and Tyler; Marshall supported new factories; iron works functioned in East Texas; and the state penitentiary became a leading producer of cloth. Texas became a haven for refugees from other Southern states and a shipping point for slaves whose owners sought to move them from threatened territory. Both migrations provided additional problems for Texans, and many immigrants were not happy with their new home. Kate Stone, of Brokenburn Plantation in Louisiana, fled to Smith County during the Vicksburg Campaign and called her haven “the dark corner of the Confederacy.” This assessment is perhaps too harsh; Texas functioned well enough, considering its many difficulties, and its war problems were only preliminaries for greater difficulties during Reconstruction. The war ended for Texans at different times. For the survivors of Hood’s Brigade and other Texans in the Army of Northern Virginia, the end came with Lee’s surrender to Gen. U. S. Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865; for others with the Army of Tennessee, it concluded with Gen. J. E. Johnston’s surrender to Gen. W. T. Sherman at Bentonville, North Carolina, on April 19; and Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, including Texas, on June 2. But for most Texans, the day to remember was June\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Civil War and the Lone Star State: A Brief Overview\n\n29\n\n19. On that day Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston with 1,800 Federal troops to declare the war at an end and all war proclamations, including the end of African slavery, in effect. White and black Texans would one day view this as a day of liberation. But for decades most whites seethed with resentment and most blacks did not understand fully what it meant or have an opportunity to exercise their freedom. [Note: The story of Texas during secession and the Civil War has been told many times and well in general works I have read by Rupert Richardson, Ralph W. Steen, T. R. Fehrenbach, Seymour Conner, Robert Calvert and Arnoldo De León, Alwyn Barr, and more recently by James Haley, and many, many others. I have written about these years in fourth- and seventh-grade texts and in such general works as Texas: All Hail the Mighty State and Texas: A Compact History. I learned the story from these and other excellent historians, especially Ralph Wooster, Frank E. Vandiver, and T. Harry Williams, and herewith acknowledge my considerable debt to each of these, plus scores of other fine historians unmentioned here who have taught me all I know about Texas history.]\n\nPart II The Time for Compromise Has Passed\n\nChapter 3 The Impending Crisis: A Texas Perspective on the Causes of the Civil War by James M. Smallwood Although various economic, political, and social factors help explain the coming of the Civil War, it had only one predominant cause: slavery. Like their Southern brethren, Texans certainly understood the importance slavery played in stirring wartime sentiments. No single event stressed this point more clearly than the Secession Convention of Texas, where elected delegates spelled out in detail their reasons for leaving the Union on February 1, 1861.
