Along the way I have been helped by many people, and they have m y thanks. Frank E. Vandiver encouraged and guided my early work on this topic. He has insisted that I write and publish ever since. Frederick R. Zuber must have at least once wished that I had not listened to Vandiver because, besides checking my translation of quotes from Texas German newspapers, Fred read and commented upon every version of this manuscript. Babs Willis typed and corrected many of those versions. What she did not type was typed by the secretaries in the Department of History at Texas A&M University. The staff of the University of Texas Press took that typed manuscript and made it more consistent and readable. Throughout the publication process Donald J. Pisani supported me with his friendship and advice. Publication was assisted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Liz Conrad deserves special thanks for her work on the maps. From time to time others have helped, and I hope they know that I appreciate their efforts. My father was too ill to ever read what I have written, but his example of strength and courage in the face of adversity has kept me going whenever my own problems have discouraged me from continuing this project. I wish to dedicate this book to his memory.\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 9\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:01 PM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nSECESSION A N D THE U N I O N I N TEXAS\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 11\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nPrologue: Demons of Anarchy\n\n\"Sam Houston! Sam Houston! Sam Houston!\" Three times the officer of the Secession Convention of the State of Texas called for the governor to come up from his office to the legislative chambers overhead and take the prescribed oath of loyalty to the Confederate States of America. Three times Houston refused; according to legend he remained \"silent, immovable, in his chair . . . whittling steadily on.\" 1 That day, 16 March 1861, in Austin, Texas, marked the end of the long political career of Sam Houston. The roots of that career began in the War of 1812, and like so many others of his generation Houston emerged from the war a committed nationalist and a follower of Andrew Jackson. Houston's political skill aided the rise of Jackson in the 1820s, and it aided his own rise as well. In that decade Houston served as a U.S. congressman and as the governor of Tennessee. Coming to Texas in the early 1830s, he won fame by leading the Texans to victory at the Battle of San Jacinto. That battle made the Texas Revolution a success and Houston the first president, in 1836, of the Republic of Texas. After sitting out one term Houston again became president of the Republic in 1842, and in his second term as president he helped arrange the annexation of Texas. Elected as one of the state's first senators, Houston served in the U.S. Senate from 1846 to 1859, when he was elected governor of Texas. Little was constant in this long career except his devotion to Jackson and his commitment to the United States. This national perspective caused the loss of his seat in the Senate and, in 1861, finally ended his career. 2 As governor from 1859 to 1861, Houston loudly opposed all threats to the Union. Even when Abraham Lincoln was elected president and other Texans called for secession Houston wrote his son: \"The price of liberty is blood, and if an attempt is made to destroy our Union, or violate our Constitution, there will be blood shed to maintain them. The Demons of anarchy must be put down and destroyed. The miserable Demagogues & Traitors of the land, m u s t be silenced, and set at naught.\" But one month later, in December,\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 13\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\n2\n\nDemons of Anarchy\n\nmany unionists believed he had deserted their cause by calling the state legislature into a special session to consider \"relations with the Federal Government and many of the States/ 7 Once in session, in January 1861, the state legislature quickly legitimized a secession convention organized without the authority of the state government, gave that convention the legislature's own chambers as a meeting place, and retired to await its actions. Also acting quickly, the convention voted by a large margin to secede, but agreed with the governor that such action would only become legal if it were endorsed by the public in a statewide referendum. Houston, however, refused to admit that the convention had any power either to acquire the federal goverment's property in Texas or to join Texas with the six already seceded states of the Lower South in the Confederate States of America. When the convention took steps to do both before the secession referendum, Houston balked and refused to continue to cooperate with the convention. 3 Houston also refused to accept the idea that secession was necessary. He insisted that he had called the legislature into special session and had cooperated with the Secession Convention only to gauge the will of the people. As he said in a letter written a few days before the 23 February referendum: I still believe that secession will bring ruin and civil war. Yet if the people will it, I can bear it with them. I would fain not be declared an alien to my native home in old Virginia, and to the scenes of my early toil and triumph in noble Tennessee. I would not of my own choice give up the banner beneath which I have fought, the Constitution which I have revered, or the Union which I have cherished as the glorious heritage bequeathed to me by my fathers. Sixty-seven years of freedom, the recollections of past triumphs, and past sufferings, the memories of heroes whom I have seen and known, and whose venerated shades would haunt my footsteps were I to falter now, may, perhaps, have made me too devoted to the Constitution and to the Union, but be it so. Did I believe that liberty and the rights of the South demanded the sacrifice, I would not hesitate. I believe that far less concession than made to form the Constitution would now preserve it. Thus believing I cannot vote for secession. Regardless of the views of their governor, on 23 February 1861 the voters of Texas approved secession by a count of 46,153 to 14,747/ Houston, however, demanded that the public also vote on the issues of joining the Confederacy and accepting the Confederate\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 14\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\nDemons of Anarchy\n\n3\n\nConstitution. The convention refused to put those issues to another popular vote, and continued to seize federal property, force the evacuation of federal troops, and take steps to join Texas to the Confederacy. As part of this process, the convention decreed that all state officials must swear an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy. When Houston refused to appear at the appointed time to swear his oath the convention declared his office vacant. Houston declined the pleas of his friends and supporters to forcibly resist what they termed an usurpation of authority and soon thereafter left Austin. Among those urging Houston to resist secession and illegal usurpation of his authority was Abraham Lincoln. The president gave Houston a good opportunity to live up to his boasts to his son the previous November, but instead of spilling blood to preserve the Constitution he turned away from the fight. Some time in March or April 1861, the president offered the governor 70,000 soldiers to keep Texas in the Union. These troops, combined with Texas unionists and Houston's personal followers, might have allowed the hero of San Jacinto to bend Texans to his will one more time. Houston turned the plan down, claiming that he did not want to further divide the people of his state. 5 All the spark and all the attachments to the Union had not completely faded in the old man. On Houston's way from Austin to his h o m e at Cedar Point, near the city of Houston, men who had fought under the General in past days called upon him at Brenham to make a speech. He was reluctant to speak until a mob of young southern sympathizers angered him by threatening him with violence. Violence was averted when \"Hugh Mclntyre, a wealthy planter of the community and a leading secessionist, sprang upon the table and drew a large Colt revolver saying: I and 100 other friends of Governor Houston have invited him to address us, and we will kill the first m a n who insults, or who may, in any way attempt to injure him.\" After reminding the crowd that it was Houston who led the fight for Texas independence in 1836, Mclntyre is reputed to have said, \"Now, fellow-citizens, give him your close attention; and you ruffians, keep quiet, or I will kill you.\" With his old friends and comrades-in-arms standing guard with drawn revolvers, Houston went on to speak. 6 After reminding his audience of San Jacinto, as was his custom in most major speeches, Houston warmed to his topic and addressed the difficulties of relying upon reason and maintaining personal integrity while serving as an elected official in a popular democracy. As he put it:\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 15\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\n4\n\nDemons of Anarchy The Vox Populi is not always the voice of God, for when demagogues and selfish political leaders succeed in arousing public prejudice and stilling the voice of reason, then on every hand can be heard the popular cry of \"Crucify him, crucify him.\" The Vox Populi then becomes the voice of the devil, and the hiss of mobs warns all patriots that peace and good government are in peril.\n\nHouston then went on to reiterate his opposition to the Confederate government and his attachment to the United States. But the hiss of the mob and howls of their jackal leaders can not deter me nor compel me to take the oath of allegiance to a so-called Confederate Government. I protest against surrendering the Federal Constitution, its Government and its glorious flag to the Northern abolition leaders and to accept in its stead a so-called Confederate Government. Houston predicted that since the Confederacy had been founded by secession it could not endure because its member states could always secede if dissatisfied. He concluded his gloomy forecast by insisting that war between North and South was inevitable. When the tug of war comes, it will indeed be the Greek meeting Greek. Then, oh my fellow countrymen, the fearful conflict will fill our fair land with untold suffering, misfortune and disaster. The soil of our beloved South will drink deep the precious blood of our sons and brethren. In earnest prayer to our Heavenly Father, I have daily petitioned him to cast out from my mind the dark foreboding of the coming conflict. My prayers have caused the light of reason to cast the baleful shadows of the coming events before me. I cannot, nor will I close my eyes against the light and voice of reason. The die has been cast by your secession leaders, whom you have permitted to sow and broadcast the seeds of secession, and you must ere long reap the fearful harvest of conspiracy and revolution. With the cries of the ardent southerners hushed by Hugh Mclntyre's Colt and his words, Houston concluded his last public statement against the disintegration of the Union. 7 Soon after Houston's speech of 31 March 1861 in Brenham, the firing started at Fort Sumter. Lincoln called for 75,000 troops to put down an insurrection in the South, and Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas seceded to join the Confederacy. The war Houston had predicted had begun. Houston could side only with the South, and by 10 May in Independence he was saying:\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 16\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\nDemons of Anarchy\n\n5\n\nI was for preserving the Union. The voice of hope was weeks since drowned by the guns of Fort Sumter. It is not now heard above the tramp of invading armies. The mission of the Union has ceased to be one of peace and equality and now the dire alternative of yielding tamely before hostile armies, or meeting the shock like freemen, is presented to the South. In his speech at Independence Houston went on to capture the sentiment of many unionists when he declared: The time has come when a man's section is his country. I stand by mine. All my hopes, my fortunes, are centered in the South. When I see the land for whose defence my blood has been spilt, and the people whose fortunes have been mine through a quarter of a century of toil, threatened with invasion, I can but cast my lot with theirs and await the issue. From that May to his death on 26 June 1863, Houston insisted upon his loyalty to the Confederacy. He pointed proudly to his son serving in the Confederate army and loudly boasted that the shrillest voices calling for secession now skulked in the rear while his son fought at the front; his section was his country. 8 So Sam Houston comes down to us a host of contradictions, a tarnished hero often misunderstood. He was neither clearly a secessionist nor a unionist, but he knew better than any other Texan what was to come. With what Congressman John H. Reagan later called \"prophetic insight\" he foretold the spilled blood, social anarchy, inevitable destruction of slavery, and ultimate defeat of the South that would result from secession. This end was all the more tragic because he felt the pull of the two nations he had helped build—Texas and the United States—and resented both for varying from the course he had so long prescribed. Identifying self with nation, feeling the emotional force of Unionism, and seeing the inevitable end to which secession would lead, he symbolized the paradoxical southerner Lincoln never understood. Sympathetic to the Union, and an opponent of secession, when the issue was decided he, nevertheless, went with his state. 9 Quixotic but pragmatic, Houston's motivations and actions ran to extremes; so did his state's. He must have wondered that March day in Austin, while whittling in his office, just how his Texans had reached the point of joining the Confederacy. He thought he understood why the \"demons of anarchy\" were loose in the land, but his understanding gave him little solace. He blamed demagogues and incompetent leaders who performed such stupid actions as the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill. While realizing the failings of individu-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 17\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\n6\n\nDemons of Anarchy\n\nals, he m u s t have still wondered how his people could desert him. Looking back, he could recall the fight with Mexico, the establishment of an independent republic, and the desperate desire of most Texans to annex that republic to the United States. In his speeches during the secession crisis he pointed out how much Texas had prospered since annexation and how much the population had grown. People! That was one answer that might have come to him. The population of Texas after annexation in 1846 and until secession in 1861 had grown steadily, like that of Alabama or Georgia. Whites from the Lower South had moved into the state and brought with them a culture and an interest, slavery, that bound Texas to the other cottongrowing states. It is possible that by 1861 Texas was only a slightly altered extension of the Deep South and when the states of that region seceded they drew Texas with them. 10 Yet Houston knew that even in 1861 Texas did not mirror Alabama or Georgia or any other lower southern state. After all, he was the governor and he was an avowed unionist. Texas was split into many factions. Some of these factions—Whigs, immigrants from the Upper South, frontiersmen, Texans who spoke Spanish or German—had little reason to combine in secession with Texans from the Lower South and with Democrats. This factionalism accounted for Houston's election as governor in 1859, and also accounted for the failure prior to 1861 of any attempt to disrupt the Union. During his career in the Senate, however, Houston had seen that slavery and the passions it engendered could end the heterogeneity of the South and separate a united South from the North. Whether Houston would admit it or not, slavery let loose \"the demons of anarchy/ 7 Once begun, this process of anarchy would lead even the best of h u m a n beings to rash and foolish actions that could not easily be undone. Such actions would force the sanest individuals along a path they had not wished for.11 Houston could not believe in the justness or necessity of such a course. While pointing to the irrational nature of human beings he continued to pin his hopes upon reason. He saw the pragmatic benefits of being part of a large and prosperous nation. He understood the multitude of ties that had bound him to that nation since his birth. Why could others not see and understand? How could they let their passions guide them? Others, to a lesser or in some cases greater degree, did see and understand the value and importance of membership in the United States. At the end of i860, Texans basically fell into four categories. A small minority had worked for secession for nearly a decade. A larger group perceived the worth of the nation and endorsed seces-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 18\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\nDemons of Anarchy\n\n7\n\nsion only after the election of Abraham Lincoln. Another group, almost as large, still opposed secession and clung to the Union, but would support their state in any event. A small minority, the equal in numbers of the ardent secessionists, would never abandon the Union. Texans fell into these categories because of the pre-1860 cultural and political factions to which they belonged, because of the destabilizing force of slavery, and because of the chain of events which Houston referred to as anarchy. Stilling the voice of reason in the late winter and early spring of 1861, however, did not occur easily, nor did it occur completely. Houston symbolized his state. Texans were not simply secessionists or unionists. Ardent southerners retained a grain of Unionism. Militant nationalists called themselves Texans and southerners. The force of emotion and the delusion that war would not follow secession obscured these mixed feelings. Making the new nation m u c h like the old and Texans' natural desire to go along with their community eased the transition from one government to the next. Yet the change in government did not instantly create those new associations that bound the citizen to the nation, nor did it cleanly sever the old ties to the Union. Reason still bred ambivalence to secession.\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 19\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\n1 Antebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\nTexans stood on a balance beam between secession and the Union in i860, a position that accurately reflected the nature of their state. Texans by and large were recent immigrants to the state; less than one-fourth of the population could claim to have been in Texas before annexation in 1846. Their newness to Texas meant that they often identified more strongly with their former homes than with their new one. These immigrants tended to cluster into homogeneous groups that preserved their native folkways and values. The cohesiveness of these group associations, the great variety of climate and terrain in Texas, and the lack of adequate transportation in many portions of the state made the economic interests of Texas almost as diverse as its population sources. Texans from the Upper South, the Lower South, Germany, and Mexico all had different interests and values. Frontiersmen in the semiarid west, cotton planters in the humid east, and merchants on the Gulf Coast differed in their respective points of view. Political opinion in i860 mirrored this disjointed society. Culture, environment, and local self-interest all molded dissimilar attitudes toward secession. Even within the individual resident such things as partisan ties or future hopes might pull in opposite directions. Attachments to the ritual and significance of the Union and Constitution battled desires for tranquility and prosperity. Complex individuals in a dissociative society, most Texans never seriously considered secession before i860. They were too multifaceted to accomplish radical change. Inertia held them in the Union. Yet obviously something destroyed the habit of Unionism in i860 and replaced it with the new direction toward secession. It was this process that Sam Houston called \"stilling the voice of reason/ 7 In March 1861, the justification of secession seemed so slight and the mythology, prosperity, and stability of the Union so strong that Houston could only view secession as tragically irrational. 1 From a viewpoint less immediate than Houston's, secession seems equally tragic and mistaken. Secession begat the Civil War,\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 20\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\n9\n\nand the war, in addition to costing the nation a million casualties, forced Texans and southerners to abandon many of the old ways they had claimed to be defending when they seceded. If they seceded in defense of slavery, stability, and prosperity, then their actions destroyed all three. Perhaps it required tragedy and foolishness to end the evil of slavery. Still, human beings have seldom seemed so unaware of the cost of their actions as when this body of Americans moved toward secession. Houston might as easily have called secession the dance of fools. Yet Houston himself came to support the secessionists. He would join in the dance. And the metaphor of dance is appropriate. Secession was a communal, almost primal activity, that had little to do with a rational assessment of alternatives. Secessionists danced, and the music and movement drew everyone on. The voice of reason was stilled because reason was irrelevant. Perhaps, then, Texans were not so foolishly unaware of the cost of secession. Someone with the perspective of a Sam Houston could see where secession would lead, and even Sam Houston would eventually follow the secessionists. Secession and the war have a haunting aura of inevitability. Whether irrational, instinctual, foolish, or inevitable, secession is comprehensible. It was a graduated process of dissolving the old ties to the Union and of unsettling the old balance of forces which kept Texans from acting. The old ties to the Union and the competing forces within Texas society did not instantly vanish, but caused Texans to fall into groups defined by the time at which they did accept secession, and by the tenacity of their feelings for secession. As previously stated, these groups can be characterized as those who were proponents of secession prior to i860; advocates of secession because of Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency; those who accepted secession only after the public referendum of 23 February 1861; and those who never accepted the destruction of the Union. While these groups did tend to modify the behavior of their members and to force consensus, individuals in all four groups remained ambivalent about or opposed to the dissolution of the Union until the spring of 1861. In the end, secession became acceptable to all individuals but the dogged group of militant unionists because the Confederacy served as a new focal point for the old hopes and feelings previously wrapped up in the Union, and because the war made it impossible to remain ambivalent. Understanding secession, then, requires an understanding of why Texans were initially unionists and why the old balance of cultures, environments, politics, ideolo-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 21\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\n10\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\ngies, and interests that made deviation from traditional Unionism so difficult began to crumble. This understanding begins with the likeness of Texas to the plantation South. In the early spring of 1861, when it joined the other states of the Lower South in the Confederate States of America, Texas must have seemed in strange company. Isolated by distance and poor transportation, threatened by Indians and banditos, Texas appeared to be too m u c h a part of the western frontier to belong in the Confederacy. Climate, geography, history, population makeup, and regional characteristics all made Texas different from the South. Yet these differences failed to prevent its secession with Alabama, Mississippi, and the other cotton-growing States. They failed in part because, from annexation in 1846 to secession in 1861, the economy and culture of the eastern half of Texas had become increasingly like that of the plantation South. In other regions of the state and even in isolated eastern counties, Texas in 1861 remained a classic frontier region, with semisubsistence agriculture, daily struggle for survival, and egalitarian habits dominating the economy and molding a special culture. The influence of the plantation South, however, extended beyond the present reality of the 1850s. Even if they did not live in a region like the Lower South, antebellum Texans' vision of their society's future status, stability, and prosperity often came to depend upon slavery and building westward railroads that would allow the growth of a cotton-based market economy. Texans did not cease to be Americans or Texans, but to the degree that a plantation economy dominated their present and their future they became increasingly like the lower southerners. This likeness made secession possible. 2 In two regions of antebellum Texas, East Texas and the HoustonGalveston area, the plantation economy was clearly dominant. It was only in these two regions that cheap transportation, fertile lands, and favorable climate combined to make the growing of cotton and to a lesser degree sugarcane highly profitable. In actuality not all of the counties in East Texas, which have been traditionally defined as counties east of the Trinity River, were plantation counties. In some counties, such as Angelina, poor sandy soil and thick pine forests limited the development of plantations. In other counties, such as Lamar, snags and sandbars in the Red River made transportation difficult and the marketing of cotton costly. The Red River, however, was navigable from near Bowie County to its juncture with the Mississippi, and for those counties with easy access to it, the\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 22\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\n11\n\nRed River provided a perfect artery for the shipment of cotton to New Orleans. To a far lesser degree the other major rivers of East Texas, the Sabine, Neches, and Trinity, also served as carriers of cotton. Snags and sandbars in all three, however, prevented their use except when swollen beyond their normal level. 3 Geographically East Texas is an extension of the humid southeastern forests of the United States, and crops grown in the Southeast can be grown in East Texas. In this landscape and climate, so totally familiar to the Mississippians, Alabamians, and Georgians who came to Texas in increasing numbers after 1845, patterns of life soon became almost identical to those of the people of their native states. 4 Cluster migration aided the growing similarity of East Texas and the Lower South. An adventuresome individual from the Southeast would come to Texas and seek out land well suited for his agricultural habits. Then he might write home of the marvelous opportunities available in this new area. Others quickly joined the initial pioneer, and life in Texas increasingly resembled life in the immigrants' former home. East Texas first attracted settlers from the Lower South because of its proximity to their native states and its suitability for their economic system. Once established, these settlements offered a further inducement to immigrate. More cautious souls were reassured that not only the physical but the cultural environment would resemble that of their homeland. 5 Access to markets, suitable terrain and climate, and cluster migration also fostered the growth of a plantation society in the area around Houston and Galveston. In the 1850s Galveston was the most important port on the Texas coast. It offered deep and safe anchorage and was connected to inland areas by Galveston Bay, Buffalo Bayou, and the lower Trinity and San Jacinto rivers. Just down the coast from Galveston the Brazos River fed into the Gulf of Mexico, and like most Texas rivers in high water seasons it offered limited transportation. Railroads added to these natural arteries of trade. Houston businessmen were particularly adept at securing railroad transportation and by 1861 rail lines stretched from Houston up to Washington and Brazos counties and down into Brazoria County. A railroad also connected Houston with the port at Galveston, so when Buffalo Bayou was impassable goods could still flow in and out of Houston. This ease of transportation together with the fertile soil, plentiful rainfall, and long growing season of the area made the region ideal for planters, and from the days of the Republic on, immigrants from the Lower South dominated the countryside surround-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 23\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\n12\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\ning Houston and Galveston. In turn, familiar culture attracted still more settlers in the 1850s from the plantation regions of Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. 6 Some portions of the Houston-Galveston region, however, lacked the homogeneity of East Texas. In the cities of Houston and Galveston at least a third of the population was German, and a m u c h higher percentage than in the countryside was northern born. Colorado, Austin, and Washington counties contained sizable Germ a n communities whose beginnings dated back to the 1830s. The clustering of Germans in these three counties and their early arrival in Texas slowed, but did not totally prevent, the spread of a plantation society. Some Germans became planters and slaveholders while others raised cotton on a smaller scale, using free labor. Thrown into daily contact with Texans from the Lower South and living in a favorable environment with access to markets, it is not surprising that by 1861 Germans near the Gulf Coast did begin to assimilate the Lower South model. 7 In one way, the rural counties near the Gulf Coast with a high percentage of Germans characterize the antebellum history of both the Houston-Galveston and East Texas plantation regions. Each year, no matter where the population originated, assimilation made both areas more like the plantation regions of the Lower South; by 1861, these areas were in the process of becoming replicas of older plantation regions. Several pieces of evidence illustrate this growing resemblance to other plantation regions of the Lower South over the course of the 1850s. Recent studies of Harrison County (which had good access to the Red River) reveal that from 1850 to i860 the number and size of the larger landholdings grew at a faster rate than did the landholdings of the yeoman farmer. Those who owned slaves and land were also the most active politically. In both the East Texas and HoustonGalveston regions reported increases in the number of slaves, amount of improved acreage, and quantity of cotton ginned indicate that plantations were increasingly prosperous and increasingly numerous. For example, in the sugarcane- and cotton-growing counties of Brazoria, Fort Bend, and Wharton, just to the southwest of Houston, lived eighteen of the state's fifty-four slaveholders who held more than one hundred slaves in i860. In these same three counties could be found almost one-fifth of those Texans who owned over $100,000 in total property in i860. These were also the only three counties in the state where slaves made up over 65 percent of the population. Harrison, neighboring Marion, and nearby Bowie counties were among the few in which slaves made up from 5 o to 6 5 percent of the\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 24\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:02 PM\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\n13\n\npopulation. All six of these counties were moving in the direction of the more famous southern plantation regions in coastal South Carolina and Louisiana and along the Mississippi Delta. 8 Even counties or portions of counties without plantations could be considered part of a plantation region if their inhabitants were economically interdependent with planters. Texas plantations typically produced their own food supplies; planters raised enough corn, hogs, and sweet potatoes to feed their families, hands, and draft animals. If they were not self-sufficient, however, nearby yeoman farmers who primarily raised corn and herdsmen who raised hogs and cattle could supply the planters with foodstuffs. Farmers who grew a specialty crop, usually fruit, vegetables, or tobacco, might also sell a portion of what they produced to neighboring planters. Many farmers in antebellum Texas, however, were just above the subsistence level, and they sold or bartered their meager surplus of corn, livestock, or some specialized product in urban areas. It was there they obtained the few utensils, tools, and supplies they needed or wanted. Such towns might never have existed or would have been m u c h smaller had their growth not been stimulated by the outside world's demand for plantation crops. Certainly the export of lumber, livestock, and hides from eastern Texas infused some cash into the economy, but in antebellum days cotton and in some areas sugarcane were the primary stimulators of economic and urban growth. Even lumber mills, the most prevalent form of industrial activity, often sold to local customers whose incomes derived directly or indirectly from plantation crops. This was even more true of merchants and lawyers who could not have existed in a semisubsistence economy. Thus, without plantations in eastern Texas, there would have been little growth and prosperity. Those who cared for such benefits were tied to a plantation economy even if they never owned a plantation. 9 Such economic interdependence with the growers of plantation crops was traditional for most Texans east of longitude 96° west. It was part of their culture. Corn growers, stock raisers, lumber millers, lawyers, and merchants from the Lower South came to this region for the same reasons as sugar or cotton planters. The natural and cultural environment allowed them to duplicate their former lives, with one important exception: the move to the new region of Texas allowed the immigrant an opportunity to move up the economic and social ladder. These were traditional opportunities defined in traditional Lower South fashion—that is, they were interlocked with slavery and the growth of the plantation system. Most of these former southern residents shared social values, and their at-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 25\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\n14\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\ntitude toward slavery, their conception of the importance of the nation, and even their religious beliefs were very much the same. This area of Texas east of longitude 96° west, then, was the most homogeneous in the state and the most like the Lower South. Only in the cities of Houston and Galveston did any degree of economic or cultural diversity exist. 10 Of course, even in 1861 there remained some portion of former president of the Republic Mirabeau B. Lamar's dream of creating a unique Texan, or Texian, as he styled his countryman. Just as Texas became southern, southern immigrants to eastern Texas became Texian. These new Texans acquired their state's conception of itself as somehow set apart from the rest of the country. Other Texans enjoyed not only these distinctions but also a new physical environment, a different economy, and a mix of cultures unique to Texas. 11 Despite this, it was no accident that Texas seceded with the Lower South. From the founding of the Republic on, Lamar's dream of empire and a special folk had slowly died; Texas was in the process of becoming more like the South. By 1861, economics and a slaveholding culture tied the eastern half of Texas to the Lower South. By that date, as well, both aspirations for and fears of the future bonded numerous other Texans to the Lower South. Something more than economic interdependence and a common culture connected yeoman farmers to planters in antebellum Texas. Corn growers might dream of the profits and status to be achieved with cotton and slaves. Such dreams made them think of the future like planters, not semisubsistence farmers. Regardless of the cultural or subcultural group Texans had originated in, they came to the state to improve the quality of their lives. That did not mean that all Texans came to the state for profit. Some might have migrated because they wanted to preserve their traditional selfsufficient ways of life—lifestyles which forced each family to spin, weave, sew, hunt, farm, fish, and gather wood, only loosely tied to the wealth-producing market economy. Most new Texans, however, desired the security of wealth and the prestige of greater social status or political power. While these dreams were held in common, the paths to their fulfillment might be quite different. Each cultural or subcultural group tended to have a model for achieving wealth and power. An Upper South model, for example, was a farmer with a medium-sized farm who raised wheat and corn, invested in machinery to save labor, and aggressively marketed his wheat and the livestock he fattened on his corn. If this model did not prove viable in the new environment, or if another group's model demonstrated greater ability to bring wealth, status, and power, then the farmer\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 26\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\nWestern limit of the homogeneous Lower South\n\nWestern limit of the frontier\n\nMAP 1.

The key to the process of assimilation was exposure to alternative patterns of living. Texans had to see other models of behavior in action before they would change their plans for the future. Of course, the large numbers of alternative cultural models surrounding them enhanced their willingness to change. That meant that if more Texans from the Lower South lived in a county than did Germans or Texans from the Upper South, and if climate, terrain, and transportation allowed it, over time wheat and corn growers became cotton growers and slave owners, or at least aspired to that level. The long hot growing season and fertile soils of Texas coupled with steady world demand for cotton made that crop and the cotton slave culture attractive wherever rainfall and transportation permitted. In effect, with the coming of the railroad, all of Texas as far west as about longitude 98 0 west, the point at which rainfall ceased to be adequate for cotton, was potentially the domain of the Lower South. That it was not so in i860 can be attributed to the early settling of some regions by other cultural groups and continued isolation due to poor transportation. 12 Texas was not totally like the Lower South, then, but Texans could view their state as progressing in that direction. They could identify their future with Alabama and Mississippi, and with the marketing of cotton and slave ownership. Thus either common present interests or common future dreams would incline some Texans to follow Mississippi and Alabama out of the Union. Texas was the last of a series of states that emerged on the southwestern frontier from 1815 to i860, and like those before it, the young state enjoyed flush times. No state in the South enjoyed a greater share of the prosperity of the 1850s than Texas. Agriculture dominated the economy. Land was cheap and abundant. Fortunes could be made in cotton. Slaves provided an able labor force. All that was lacking was an economical means of reaching the area and of transporting agricultural products from it. By 1855, just ten years after it became a state, Texas' assessable wealth had increased fivefold. From 1850 to i860 the number of slaves increased from 58,161 to 182,566. In the same decade, the number of farms in Texas increased from 12,198 to 42,891, and improved acreage increased from 643,976 to 2,650,781. From these farms, 26,255 bales of cotton were received in 1850 at the port of Galveston. In 1856, considered a poor year for crops, over 90,000 bales of cotton were received. Sugar, cattle, molasses, and hides showed similar increases. Such growth was only the beginning for some Texans. Men like Willard Richardson, editor of the Galveston News, or Charles De Morse of the Clarks-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 28\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\n17\n\nville Standard envisioned even greater material progress for the state. The key to this progress was railroads. 13 Railroads fascinated Texas empire builders. They were to be the sinews which would bind Texas together and make it a self-sufficient and prosperous economic unit. They were also to be the means by which slavery was spread into the interior of the state. Despite the mania for railroads present since the time of the Republic, lack of capital to finance them and disputes over location and procedure delayed construction until the late 1850s. Still, the notable preoccupation with railroads evident in the newspapers and in the state and local governments of the time illustrates that Texans in the 1850s were intensely interested in economic expansion—expansion, as in the case of the Lower South, based on agriculture and commerce. Significantly, in East Texas, entrepreneurs designed railroads to further integrate the region with the economy of the Lower South. Texans like Willard Richardson thought of Texas as an empire unto itself, but still an empire closely resembling the Lower South. They looked forward to a day when railroads would facilitate the export of cotton, sugar, beef, hides, and flour, and at the same time help supply their state's own material needs through intrastate trade. With the vast cotton lands of the state opened up by railroads the potential for growth seemed unlimited. Railroads represented the reality of prosperity and economic growth. Railroads were linked with slavery. They represented dreams—dreams of a slaveholding empire based on agriculture and commerce—dreams that were common to the Lower South. 14 Texans and southerners dreamed of territorial as well as economic expansion. During the era of the Republic there had been m u c h talk of expanding Texas until it stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean; in the time of antebellum statehood similar illusions of expanding southern territory into the Caribbean and Latin America were popular. In the view of John Marshall, editor of the Austin Texas State Gazette and chairman of the state's Democratic party, Manifest Destiny was closely linked to southern nationalism. While others dreamed of an ever stronger southern economy, Marshall dreamed of expanding southern territory. Nor were these the idle thoughts of one or two fanatics. The Knights of the Golden Circle, whose purpose, as far as can be understood, was to found a great slaveholding empire in the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America, enjoyed modest popularity in Texas. Cuba was to be the geographic center of a circular empire whose radius stretched to the Mason-Dixon line in the north and down through\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 29\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\n18\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\nBrazil in the south. In 1857 John Marshall asked, \"Shall we not go on in the attempt to acquire Cuba, and thus prepare the way for an inevitable decree of destiny in the final annexation of the rest of the Antilles?\" A number of Texans would have answered yes.15 Economic and territorial expansion, then, were both tangible -and intangible links with the Lower South. Slaveholders came to Texas at an increasing rate in the 1850s. Plantation crops increased in economic importance. Settlers from the Lower South spread into the western counties. The Lower South mix of planter, farmer, and herdsman became more common. In effect, the Lower South had extended its territorial borders to include the eastern half of Texas. Much of the rest of Texas was tied to the Lower South too, but it was a m u c h more chimerical bond. In much of western Texas, slavery and the Lower South economy were not present, but the hope that the railroads would bring them there was. The belief in distant El Paso that the Southwest could be brought securely into the slaveholder's orbit helps explain that town's rabid support of secession. 16 In a like manner but on a greater scale, the institution of slavery linked Texas and the Lower South in both a real and an ethereal sense. Slavery was one concept upon which Texans demanded conformity. From time to time there had been expressions of antislavery sentiment in Texas, but the exponents of such sentiment seldom remained in the state for long.17 Rip Ford, editor, Texas Ranger, and later confederate general, probably summed up most Texans' attitudes toward slavery when after the war he wrote: \"Slavery came to the Southern man authorized by the supreme Law of the Land. It came to h i m authorized by time, and custom, and law. The assumption in the Declaration of Independence that 'all men are created equal' was not intended to include [the] African race, or was a falsehood on its face. It was an institution sanctioned by the Bible, and it had all the authority of time to uphold it.\" In the 1850s, Charles De Morse, the talented editor of the Clarksville Standard, echoed the common southern lament that it was the master who bore all the responsibilities and burdens of life, while the slave lived a happy and carefree existence. Willard Richardson, the editor of the widely circulated Galveston News and the creator of the Texas Almanac, expressed another common belief of that decade when he lauded the increase in the number of slaves in Texas. Richardson viewed slavery as essential to the economic growth of the state. John P. Osterhout, a transplanted Pennsylvanian, considered slaves both a good investment and a necessary prerequisite to a higher social status. 18 William P. Ballinger, a prominent Galveston attorney, held some reservations about the economic value of slavery, but he noted\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 30\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\n19\n\nthat slavery civilized the Negro, and was \"the only relation that can exist where the African is in any considerable numbers, and it seems to m e if the hand of Providence be visible in anything in this world it is in American slavery/ 719 In the eyes of antebellum Texans, slavery was just, moral, and beneficial to both slave and master. Only one aspect of slavery aroused much dissension in Texas: the competition between slave labor and free labor. John Marshall combined nascent populism and slavery by arguing that every m a n should be a slaveholder so that the wealthy planters would not have a stranglehold on this important facet of the economy He hoped, too, that widespread slaveholding would strengthen slavery in Texas. 20 Others were not so willing to see slave labor replace free labor. Jacob De Cordova, one of Texas's primary propagandists in the 1850s, declared slavery a \"wise provision,\" but he argued that profit and loss should determine whether slave labor or free labor was used. In the classic tradition of liberal economics he wrote: \" . . . labor, like every other marketable commodity, will always regulate itself; and there are few men indeed who, when they find out what description of labor is most profitable, will not employ it, if they can command it.\" Willard Richardson did not share De Cordova's opinion that white labor could be used to grow cotton; his disagreement with De Cordova was centered upon which labor force was the hardiest and most efficient. In effect, it was similar to the argument over whether it was best to plow with horses or mules. 21 Slaves were scarce and expensive in Texas, and since Richardson and Marshall viewed the expansion of slavery as essential to growth they became outspoken advocates of reopening the African slave trade. In doing so they attracted the wrath of Ferdinand J. Lindheimer, one of the most influential Germans in Texas and editor of the staunchly Democratic Neu Braunfelser Zeitung. Lindheimer made it clear that he, as well as most Germans, did not oppose slavery. They did oppose reopening the African slave trade because it would take jobs away from Germans, who were one of the major sources of free labor in Texas. Lindheimer further argued that the African slave trade, instead of allowing more whites to own slaves, would allow the concentration of even greater numbers of slaves in the hands of those who had the most capital. Economic, political, and social power would thus be further concentrated in the hands of the large slaveholders. Other Texans with already large investments in slaves opposed Richardson and Marshall's plan because it would drive down the value of their slaves. The attempt to reopen the African slave trade, which came to be identified with the Democratic party in 1859, cost the party dearly when Sam Houston\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 31\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\n20\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\npounced upon this issue and used it to help him win the gubernatorial election. That and the question of slave labor versus free labor were the only disparities in Texans' otherwise united stand on slavery.22 Despite the acrimonious dispute in 1859 o v e r expanding slave labor, during the secession crisis unionists seldom attempted to take advantage of some Texans' commitment to free labor. Perhaps they did not want to risk being branded abolitionists, but it was also possible that this commitment existed only temporarily. Certainly slavery, like expansionism, concerned future hopes and fears as much as present realities. R. W. Loughery expressed these hopes in the Texas Republican when he wrote in 1856: \"From the immense extent and extraordinary fertility of her lands, [Texas] is destined to become the recipient of most of the slave population of her sister States of the South. She ought, therefore, to feel a more lively interest in every question pertaining to the institution, and to its perpetuation, than any other State in which it exists/' Many Texans envisioned their state as becoming a great slaveholding empire. To threaten slavery was to flout destiny. Once again, Texans' conception of what they were to become was a strong bond to the Lower South. 23 Fear of the consequences of abolition proved to be an equally strong bond. The summer of i860 witnessed many unexplained fires and other acts labeled terrorism in Texas which many believed to be the fruit of abolitionist plots similar to John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. This was final proof to Texans that the end of slavery meant social, economic, and political anarchy. Fear of social discord has motivated the body politic since Aristotelian times, and it was no less so in antebellum Texas.24 John Marshall's Texas State Gazette most adeptly played upon these fears, and spearheaded a drive to convince all Texans, slaveholders and nonslaveholders alike, that the defense of slavery demanded secession once the black Republicans were in control of the federal government. On 17 November i860, just a few days after Abraham Lincoln was elected, a Gazette editorial read: \"The negro- s would of course be set free, and like all emancipated African slaves would prey, an idle, filthy, vicious, and worthless class upon the industrious white population.\" Even the frontier was threatened by those who wanted to end slavery if abolitionists released either Kansas ruffians or vicious Indians on northwest Texas. In summing up his position, the Gazette's editorial writer insisted: \"We are all vitally interested in defending and maintaining slavery. It cannot be destroyed without ruining and dishonoring every cotton State materially, morally, socially, and politically\" Recent scholars have argued\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 32\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\nAntebellum Texas and the Plantation South\n\n21\n\nthat it was these fears that convinced the majority of Texans to abandon the Union. Certainly in the case of U.S. Representative John H. Reagan, a man who ably expressed the moderate views of most Texans, this fear of anarchy, strengthened by Republican threats to property moved him to support secession. 25 More than anything else, slavery linked Texas to the Lower South. The attitude toward blacks was common in both the Upper and Lower South, but Texans' conception of the role slavery was to play in their own future was identical to the role of slavery in the Lower South. Furthermore, racial fears proved as potential in some parts of Texas as they were in South Carolina. Nor did the density of slavery in an area need to be high in order to provoke these fears. Secession was as hysterically discussed in Dallas, where few slaves lived, as it was in Brazoria County, where over 65 percent of the population were slaves. Slavery cemented the alliance between Texas and the Lower South. 26 This alliance between Texas and the plantation-dominated Lower South had grown more close in the years between annexation and secession. Antebellum Texas shared the economic prosperity of the cotton states. Lower South whites and blacks came to Texas in increasing numbers in these years and their influence spread throughout the state. In their attitude toward slavery Texans were in consensus with the Lower South. Still, not just the social and economic realities of 1861 tied Texas to the Lower South. Texans 7 conception of their future prosperity, the future of slavery, and the awful potential of freedom for the blacks bound Texas to Alabama. These changes in interests and dreams altered traditional politics and set the stage for secession.\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 33\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\n2 Partisanship and Ideology\n\nOnce Texans' future prospects, present interests, and cultural perceptions became more like those of lower southerners, they became increasingly similar politically; similar but not the same. Politics was more than an extension of economic opportunities and regional culture. Partisanship and local political feuds often overrode economic interests and cultural ties. By the same token, Texans held a common American ideology an ideology shaded differently in every part of the United States. Secession was a political event, an event shaped not just by regional culture and interests but by the history of partisan politics in Texas and by the evolution of American ideology in Texas. As Democrats or as members of the many successive opposition parties which competed for power and position within the state, Texans developed loyalties which split them from their neighbors and tied t h e m to Americans in distant counties and distant states. Party affiliation could make a man more of a Texan and it could make him more of a southerner, but it could also make him more of an American. Affiliation, though, was not just something inherited, or assumed because of a single particular issue. Antebellum parties, through their spokesmen on the stump and in the press, were the articulators and major carriers of ideologies from generation to generation. A two-party system was surprisingly persistent in antebellum Texas. It was persistent not just because of competition for political office and influence, but because Texans had marked ideological differences. Like political parties, ideology cut across many boundaries: Texans could be Germans, Lutherans, Democrats, and romantic nationalists. They could be planters, Baptists, Whigs, and romantic nationalists. If they met on no other level, ideologically Texans could be kin. Without political parties, however, these kindred spirits might never act in concert. Parties muted ideology for political gain. They combined for a common purpose factions with often diverse ideologies. Still, only through parties could individuals' ill-defined values and beliefs find effective political expression. Parties, despite the\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 34\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n23\n\nblurrings required of practical politics, attracted adherents because of the values and beliefs they represented. As long as such institutions that could express collective Unionism existed the nation would have a strong protector. When such an institution vanished, secession would be simpler. Texas certainly had its share of political rivalries in the 1850s. The state was governed in the main by the Democratic party, a party which became increasingly aligned with the militant secessionists of the Lower South. The Democracy (as the party was called), however, did not rule unchallenged. First the Whigs, then the KnowNothings, and finally the Opposition or Union Democrats competed with them. More than simple competition for office separated the Democrats and their opponents; the principles of those challenging the Democrats changed with the situation. A Whig was not necessarily a Know-Nothing, nor was the Know-Nothing always a member of the Opposition. Increasingly, however, the Democrats 7 opponents were distinguished by devotion to the Union and belief in its God-given greatness, while the Democrats—although still believing in the goals of an American nation—became increasingly militant in their defense of the South's place in that nation. As distinctions between parties and ideologies became clearer, it was the Opposition that defended the Union and the Democrats who attacked it. 1 A Whig party in Texas existed only briefly, but it left an important legacy. In the presidential elections of both 1848 and 1852 Whig candidates drew a surprisingly large vote despite being personally unpopular in Texas. During the same period Whigs competed successfully with Democrats in local elections, but only once, in 1853, when William B. Ochiltree ran for governor, did the Whigs achieve any degree of success in a statewide race. Most Whig support in Texas was localized in East Texas, North Texas, and in the urban and commercial areas, and although opposition parties in Texas became more broadly based, there would always be a clear distinction between Know-Nothings and Union Democrats from the old Whig areas and those from the other regions of the state. 2 These Texas Whigs brought as well the particular values and flavor of southern Whigs to any opposition party they joined. The Whig party of the South attracted prosperous planters, merchants, and professionals. The party stressed stability, economic growth, and an adherence to traditional American and Protestant values. In Texas, Whigs also tried to appeal to what their leading editorial mouthpiece, the Galveston Journal, called \"the hard fisted yeomanry of our country/ 7 and they often attacked the Democrats as being undemocratic. 3 Nor did Texas Whigs have the overwhelming support of the\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 35\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\n24\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\nlargest slaveholders, as was true of Mississippi Whigs. Still, on the whole Texas Whigs followed the southern pattern. Besides their definite economic interest in banking and internal improvements, Whigs had in common certain class ties. While not above appealing to the yeoman at election time, the bulk of Whig leadership and support came from the agricultural elite and from the commercial classes of the towns and villages across the state. Whigs, too, were often Protestant reformers who desired to uplift society and force it to conform to the Whig model of proper behavior. Even their interest in banks stemmed in part from their desire to impose order on a chaotic financial system. At any rate, all Whigs felt more at home in their own party than among the licentious Democrats. Most Whigs, after years of association with their party and competition for office with the Democrats, viewed their opponents with the same loathing modern sports fans reserve for their favorites7 archenemies. Politics was in many ways the \"great game\" of the nineteenth-century South, with each party struggling to secure victory for its candidates. Prominent speakers always drew a crowd, and the hostility aroused by flamboyant oratory often erupted into violence. Duels between rival editors and gunplay on the speaker's podium were common enough in antebellum Texas to prove the seriousness with which Texans took their politics. This sense of competition and of being set apart persisted and, combined with differences in ideology and interests, ensured that a hard kernel of opposition to the Democracy remained after the Whig party in Texas, the national party having split apart in 1854 over slavery and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, began to wither. 4 Perhaps the most crucial ideological legacy of the Whigs was the concept of nationhood. Almost all Texans placed some degree of value on the Union before i860. Whigs, however, favored a stronger and more active central government. This did not mean that they opposed the federal system. It was a question of degree. Whigs placed more emphasis on an active and authoritative national government and less on the freedom of the individual states. Whigs, too, were often romantic nationalists and had deep emotional ties to the Union. Men like James W. Throckmorton had as deep a loyalty to their country as they did to their region and state. Such a commitment was not typical of all Whigs, though, and in 1850 and i860 many southern Whigs loudly advocated secession. Still, Whigs as a whole held a broad national perspective and did not view each new crisis strictly through the eyes of a Texan or a southerner. During the crisis of 1850, in which Texans took a special interest because their claim to eastern New Mexico became a southern cause, the Galveston Journal was even willing to sacrifice the Whig party for\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 36\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n25\n\nthe Union and declared: \"In other states the terms Whig and Democrat have almost been forgotten in the absorbing question of union or disunion. The Whigs of Texas are for the Union, and, therefore, from the highest motives that can prompt men in their political views, desire no strict organization until the Union is safe from the agitation which at present threatens it.\" 5 Unfortunately for the antisecessionists, the Whigs left behind several political liabilities which hampered any opposition parties to which they later belonged. Among these liabilities were Whig opposition in the United States to the annexation of Texas and later to the Mexican War. Also important was the opposition of the TaylorFillmore administration to the Texas border claims in New Mexico. Most important in the long run, however, was the identification of the Whig party on the national level with abolitionism. In 1852 Texas Whigs reacted angrily to the nomination of General Winfield Scott for president. John B. Ashe of Galveston County, a delegate to the national convention and former Whig congressman from Tennessee, had been nominated by an earlier Whig state convention as a presidential elector but resigned from that position when Scott was nominated. He declared: \"We thoroughly understand the temper and wishes of the abolitionists of the North, to whom General Scott owes his nomination. The same power which could procure his nomination could control his administration, and then where Would we be?\" Such sentiments account for the precipitous decline in the Whig party's vote in East Texas counties. Here, where slavery was the most firmly established, threats to that peculiar institution were more important than party loyalty. Thus, by 1854 Texas Whigs carried with t h e m into any new political organization a number of serious political handicaps. 6 In 1854, with the Whig party rapidly vanishing from the political hustings, the Democratic party showed few signs of life itself. Texas politics had lacked organized political parties before 1848, and while most Texans considered themselves Democrats, it was only in regions or elections in which organized competition existed that the Democratic party as an institution had come into existence. The party had no regular convention system and very little statewide organization. Especially in the more recently settled regions of the state, local commentators would have agreed with the Austin editor who wrote in 1855: \"Hitherto a campaign could hardly be said to wear anything of a political color, and in many instances the predilections of those who offered themselves for office were not investigated, and men were chosen in consideration of services rendered in the dark and troublesome times, when side by side Democrats\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 37\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:03 PM\n\n26\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\nand Whigs struggled for the rights of many regardless of antecedents/ 7 Men called themselves Democrats when they ran for office, but what mattered most were personality and reputation. 7 This did not mean that the Democratic party was not without considerable strength within the state. The dominant personality in Texas politics had long been Sam Houston, and like Houston most Texans identified with Andrew Jackson and his political party While Whigs might still rail against ''King Andrew/' the majority of Texans in 1854 espoused Jacksonian ideology and deeply admired Houston and Jackson. They believed that all free males should vote, that political office should not be reserved for the elite, that all offices should be filled by popular elections, and that banks were evil. It was wrong for internal improvements within the states to be financed by the federal government. Corporations were to be bound by legislative restrictions because they represented concentrations of wealth and power that could corrupt the democratic system. For Democrats this did not mean that prosperity should not be encouraged by government, but that prosperity should be promoted for all men, not just the privileged few. In Houston and the legendary Jackson, Texans saw protectors of the people and defenders of the ideology of the common man. In war and in peace—by their military and political leadership—Houston and Jackson sheltered and directed their people. Fealty was owed these chieftains, and fealty meant that when the choice was clear Texans voted for their chieftain's Democratic party. The strength of the Democratic party in Texas prior to 1854 was twofold: the party represented a loosely knit collection of ideas, and it bore the stamp of the major public personalities in Texans' lives. 8 After 1854 the Democratic party would begin a period of evolution that would last about four years. The party would never totally lose its Jacksonian base, but it would change greatly. This change was caused by the high level of political turmoil within the nation itself, the increasing strength of a Lower South culture in Texas, and the statewide competition of the Know-Nothing party. Of these three, the Know-Nothing party was the clearest and simplest cause of change. Like the Democratic and Whig parties, the Know-Nothing party was an import to Texas. It began as a semisecret organization dedicated to reform, but it quickly changed into a full-fledged political party. Appealing to nativists, nationalists, and Democrat-haters, the Know-Nothings achieved considerable success in the state and local elections of 1854-1855.\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 38\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n27\n\nSince over 15 percent of the free population in Texas during the 18 5 os could be considered \"f oreign\" and since this was a rapidly growing group, the nativist planks of the Know-Nothing platform had great appeal among the American born in the state. Judging from the Know-Nothings' newspapers, nativism was based upon a closely connected series of impulses: anti-Catholicism, racism, resentment of economic competition, fear of foreign radicals, and a fear of the debasement of Anglo-Saxon institutions. Catholicism's danger grew from its undemocratic nature and the subversive influence of the Pope. According to the Know-Nothings, priests controlled the voters and the Pope controlled the priests and manipulated Catholics for his own purposes. Since all Mexicans and about half the Germans were Catholics, this meant other Texans could easily associate foreignness and Catholicism with danger. The threat to democracy was all the greater because Mexican Catholics were considered inferior beings whose genetic makeup would pollute the Anglo-Saxon bloodline. Germans as Western Europeans were not considered racially inferior, but both groups competed with Americans for jobs. This allowed the Know-Nothings to attract urban workers and craftsmen who believed their economic position threatened by foreigners. Other Texans saw the foreigners not as an economic threat but as a threat to the stability of their society. Mainly because of their alleged opposition to slavery, Germans and Mexicans had to fight the charge of being radicals and anarchists. Since some German intellectuals did criticize slavery and some Mexican abolitionists did help slaves escape, there was enough truth in the charge to keep rumors flying for years about the dangerous nature of the foreign element in Texas. In essence, the Know-Nothings considered foreigners a threat to Anglo-American society and government. 9 As an editorial in the La Grange True Issue put it in 1855, \"indiscriminate immigration, a universal amalgamation of all the schismatic Red Republicans, tumultuary propagandists, all the hyferlutin odds and ends of all the world and the rest of mankind must and will assuredly, certainly and inevitably overwhelm in dire discord and bloody wreck, the sacred citadel of liberty, and light the funeral pyre around its ruins.\" 10 This concern with the integrity of American institutions and with the ethnic purity of the American people was in some ways simply another side of the Know-Nothings' commitment to the nation. Nationalists and nativists alike were concerned with maintaining the purity and integrity of the United States. The events of the mid-185 os threatened the nation as deeply as did foreign immigration, and the clearest source of Know-Nothing strength grew from\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 39\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\n28\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\ndissatisfaction with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854 and from subsequent events in Kansas. The Kansas-Nebraska Act had been a Democratic measure, endorsed by President Franklin Pierce and passed by the votes of Democratic congressmen. In 185 5, when it began to seem to some southerners that the Kansas-Nebraska Act threatened the Union by dividing it along sectional lines and by leading to the bloody fighting between northerners and southerners in Kansas, the Democratic party was blamed for the course of events. In Texas those dissatisfied with the Democrats often joined the Know-Nothings more out of concern for the stability and safety of the Union than because of nativism. Know-Nothings accentuated this commitment to the nation by calling themselves the American party, and it became a standard argument of the Know-Nothing campaign that the Democrats sought the disruption of the Union. 11 Sam Houston was one of those who moved toward the American party because of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Almost ousted from the Democratic party because of his vote against the measure, Houston never actually joined the Know-Nothings but did support many of the party's views. In a public letter of 24 July 185 5, he maintained that the old Democratic party of Jefferson and Jackson had grown debased and that the Know-Nothings represented a return to the principles of his mentors. While not condoning any restrictions on the civil rights of immigrants, Houston endorsed the extension of the naturalization period to twenty-one years and voiced anti-Catholic sentiment. He also condemned the modern Democratic party for being under the sway of John C. Calhoun and argued that its support for the Kansas-Nebraska Act had \"built up a freesoil and abolition party.\" For these reasons he declared, \"I believe the salvation of m y country is only to be served by adherence to the principles of the American Order.\" 12 Nationalism was not simply a direct response to immediate events. Long-term commercial and economic interests had led many to support the nation and the party. With their prosperity threatened by sectional strife, the commercial centers of East Texas gave consistent support to the Know-Nothings. Here the Whig party had been strong, and the Know-Nothing party was a direct descendant. Prosperous planters, lawyers, and merchants who favored federally financed internal improvements, state banks, and a maintenance of the status quo, all of which would have enhanced or perpetuated their profitable market economy, transferred their allegiance to the Know-Nothings. Businessmen in San Antonio, where the U.S. Army made a major contribution to the economy, were another source of\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 40\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n29\n\nKnow-Nothing strength. Those most concerned with preserving the relationship among the states as well as expanding the economy were often Know-Nothings. 13 An emotional or ideological attachment to the Union also played a part in the origin of the Know-Nothing party. Many Know-Nothing adherents, like Sam Houston, claimed to be old Jacksonian Democrats—opponents of nullifiers and secessionists, proponents of a strong national government. Other conservative old-line Whigs added their own nationalism to the Know-Nothing party's and attempted to portray Know-Nothings as citizens \"that love the Union, that have the good of the country at heart, and will support the constitution/ 7 1 4 Many Know-Nothings joined the party not for nativism or nationalism but because of traditional dislike for Democrats and Democratic measures or because they saw the party as a means to gain office and influence. In this sense, then, the Know-Nothing party was a natural outgrowth of the competitive nature of southern politics. Many traditional Whigs swallowed their dislike of nativism and supported the Know-Nothing party as a conservative and beneficial force—a force much preferred to their traditional Democratic enemies. 15 Out of these complex origins—nativism, nationalism, and a sense of competition—sprang the Texas Know-Nothing party in 1854. Catching the Democrats by surprise and at first attracting nonpartisan support, the Know-Nothings made an impressive showing during their first year in Texas, with party members elected as the mayors of Galveston, Austin, and San Antonio. They went on to field a full slate of candidates for the 1855 state election. Know-Nothing success spurred the Democrats into action, and in their state convention of 1855 they demonstrated that, w h e n threatened by an outside force, they could act in concert. Despite the fact that E. M. Pease's state plan for railroad construction was a divisive issue among Democrats, they united behind the incumbent governor and attacked the Know-Nothings for their secrecy and nativism. Many Democrats who had originally joined the KnowNothings, such as W. S. Oldham, now renounced the party when it became apparent that it was competing with the Democrats for official positions. Earlier, the Know-Nothings had seemed like a club or fraternal organization with an interest in politics. By mid-1855, however, they had assumed all the trappings of a political party. By the August elections of that year the contest was, in most cases, between Know-Nothings and Democrats and not between personali-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 41\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\n30\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\nties operating within a vague and amorphous Democratic party.16 Know-Nothing successes in 1855 were mildly encouraging to the party faithful. Lemuel D. Evans's victory in the eastern congressional district was highly touted as a portent of future success. Sam Houston's flirtation with the party was also considered noteworthy. Added to this was the election of a political neutral, Stephen Crosby, as state land commissioner, and the election of several KnowNothings to the state legislature. Democrats, however, swept every statewide office except that of state land commissioner, and they remained in solid control of both the House and the Senate. They, too, had cause for rejoicing. They could claim to have beaten back the Know-Nothing challenge, and they had laid the groundwork for a highly organized party.17 Know-Nothing successes after 1855 were few; that year was the high-water mark for the party in Texas. Presidential elections were the mortar which held antebellum parties together, and when the Know-Nothings' candidate, Millard Fillmore, failed miserably in 1856, the party declined in strength across the country In Texas, the 1856 presidential campaign centered upon accusations by the Democrats that the Know-Nothings were un-American because of their nativism and secrecy, that the northern wing of their party was dominated by abolitionists, and that a vote for the Know-Nothings only aided the cause of the Republican party. Know-Nothings in turn stressed that they were moderates with a grave concern for the Union. Such appeals by the Know-Nothings swayed only limited numbers of Texans, and the party suffered a two-to-one defeat in the state. Know-Nothings carried only eight counties in 1856, and their strength, like that of the Whigs before, was highly localized. Traditional Whig counties east of the Brazos and Trinity rivers gave the Know-Nothings a sizable portion of their votes. Counties between San Antonio and Corpus Christi, where there was a lingering resentment of Mexicans among the Anglos, also either chose the KnowNothing ticket or gave it a sizable minority. Central Texas, between Austin in Travis County and Waco in McLennan County, where there were many promising young Know-Nothing leaders, was another area which cast a large vote for that party. Voters along the southwestern frontier, in Uvalde and Bandera counties, also voted for the Know-Nothings. Judging from these returns, Know-Nothing success can be attributed to the two-party tradition in the east, the ability of the Know-Nothing leaders and the appeal of the unionist platform in central Texas, and Anglo resentment of Mexicans in the counties between San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley.18 Other weaknesses besides the loss of the 1856 presidential elec-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 42\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n31\n\ntion speeded the Know-Nothings 7 demise. Slavery split the KnowNothing party on a national level, as it had split the Whigs, and after 1856 the party in Texas lost all outside impetus for growth. Discouraged by their lack of victories and by the effective assault of the Democrats on their nativism and secrecy, local organizations began to wither, and in 1857 few candidates claimed to be Know-Nothings. Instead they adopted the old Whig policy of claiming to be Democrats when speaking before Democratic audiences and acting like Whigs in front of Whig constituents. This policy had been successfully applied by Lemuel Evans and Stephen Crosby in 1855, and Know-Nothing candidates hoped that it would bring them success once again in 1857. It necessitated, however, the abandonment of a state platform, a party ticket, the convention system, and a centralized party structure; in effect, it meant the deinstitutionalization of the Know-Nothing party. Even with their efforts to shed the label of Know-Nothingism, the opponents of the Democracy fared badly in the 1857 state elections. Sam Houston, estranged from the Democrats by his vote against the Kansas-Nebraska Bill and his endorsement of the KnowNothing party, lost his bid for the governor's chair to Hardin R. Runnels, the nominee of the Democratic convention, and the wellorganized Democrats swept almost every office in the state. Even the incumbent Lemuel Evans, despite his strong stand in favor of the Union, was defeated by Judge John H. Reagan in the First Congressional District. That year marked the high point of the antebellum Democratic party in Texas; at no time was it more harmonious, more united, or more effective. That year, too, marked the virtual end of the Know-Nothing party on a statewide level. It shrank to a few remaining bastions of strength in East Texas. 19 In some ways the Know-Nothings continued the Whig legacy. Both groups held a national orientation, both favored moral reform. Both parties were strong in East Texas, North Texas, and the urbancommercial areas. Both groups drew strength from opposition to the dominant political party in the state. Know-Nothings, however, narrowed and intensified their drive for moral reform by concentrating on nativist issues. At the same time, their economic policies were less clear-cut than the Whigs. While their regional strength was roughly the same as the Whigs, the Know-Nothings also drew support in the south-central portion of the state. Here there was no tradition of opposition to the Democratic party, or no real history of party politics for that matter. This resulted in an east-west division in the state's Know-Nothing party. Those in the eastern portion of the state were more like their Whig predecessors and opposed the\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 43\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\n32\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\nDemocrats as much out of habit as anything else. Those in the west were drawn by the Unionism and nativism of the party. Despite its brief existence the Know-Nothing party contributed greatly to the political climate of the secession years by helping to remake the state's Democratic party. For the first time it could be said that Texas had an organized party with local, district, and state committees carrying on the work of the party between elections. Also for the first time the state's Democrats had a convention system that worked. Because their opponents often claimed to be Democrats, it became increasingly important to party regulars that a candidate be endorsed by a convention. These conventions and committees were usually controlled by a stable group of party leaders. Prior to 1858 some of these leaders, like Ferdinand Flake, a Galveston businessman and editor of a German-language newspaper, and George W. Paschal, a lawyer and editor of the Austin-based Southern Intelligencer, were highly vocal unionists, but after Sam Houston was ostracized from the party for his support of the Know-Nothings, the bulk of the party leadership was closely identified with the militant states' rights party of the Lower South. Ironically, the KnowNothing party, which drew much of its strength from its conservative stand on the Union, contributed to its destruction by forcing the solidification of an institution controlled by men less interested in preserving the nation and more culturally kin to the Lower South. It was equally ironic that Know-Nothings linked nationalism and nativism and, by reconfirming the Democrats' traditional defense of individual freedom and personal liberty, helped make secession palatable to nonsouthern cultural groups. The Know-Nothings' brand of nationalism implied conformity, a conformity that insisted that the American people move forward with common cultural memories toward a common national purpose. This idea of being part of one folk might appeal to some Germans and Mexicans, but when the price of being part of that folk meant giving up traditional religious practices or the drinking of lager beer, then the price seemed too high for most. It would not be difficult for the Democrats to hold the lines of party loyalty firm in the secession crisis if they could portray that crisis as another example of the Democratic party defending its supporters from the anti-individualistic ideas of the Know-Nothings recast as Republicans and unionists. 20 Not just the challenge of the Know-Nothings within Texas remade the Democratic party between 1854 and the beginning months of 1858. The party also responded to the intense distress of the na-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 44\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n33\n\ntion—troubles which cast the old Jacksonian ideology in a new light and helped weaken the symbolic impact of Houston and Jackson. The existence of the nation had been vital to Jackson and Jacksonians. Jackson had a deep emotional commitment to the nation, and Jacksonians regarded national unity as essential to the achievement of their goals. Beginning with the dispute over the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, events occurred in rapid succession which made the nation seem more a burden than a help. In 1855 and 1856 the turmoil in Kansas showed Texans that the North was growing more militant. As southerners, Texans felt under attack. The evolution of the Republican party and its strong showing in the elections of 1856 and 1857 also caused alarm. Republicans were not just abolitionists; to Texans theirs seemed a sectional party determined to promote the economic and political interests of the North no matter what the cost to the nation. Vehement Republican criticism of the Dred Scott case in 1857 suggested to Texans that even the courts and the law were not safe from Republican attack. Actions of Republican-controlled states that negated or avoided compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law reinforced the belief that not even the law would protect the South from the attacks of the Republicans. Feeling threatened, Texans were more willing to accept the Democratic party's increasingly militant defense of their rights even though this defense might threaten the existence of the nation. 21 Nationalism or commitment to the Union, though, was always more than a pragmatic concern for what the nation could or could not do for the individual. For Democrats in Texas, attachment to the nation was wrapped up in their loyalty to Sam Houston and Andrew Jackson. Sam Houston was one of only two southern Senators to vote against the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and his action was condemned in Texas as both a betrayal of the Democratic party and the South. In 1855 and 1856 he moved further from the Democratic party by all but officially endorsing the Know-Nothing party. His vote against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and near endorsement of the Know-Nothings caused a loss of public esteem. Democratic party regulars were particularly incensed and censured his actions in the state legislature, which they controlled, and at the state Democratic convention of 1856. Knowing that he would have difficulty being reelected to the Senate by the state legislature, Houston decided to run for governor in 1857. The Democrats mounted an extensive campaign against Houston, and their candidate, Hardin R. Runnels, defeated h i m by a slight margin. When the legislature did indeed fail to send h i m back to the Senate Houston seemed doomed to retirement and oblivion.\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 45\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\n34\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\nWith his defeat and discredit came not just a fall in his personal fortune but also a decline in his impact as an ongoing symbol of the nation. Andrew Jackson, of course, could no longer lose or gain popularity by his stand on the issues of the day. His death and the death of most of his contemporaries had removed from the scene the generation that had grown up during the American Revolution, had fought in the War of 1812, and had worked for the expansion of the nation through the close of the 1840s. The emotional commitment to the nation which he invoked so well in the Nullification Crisis of 1832 had less appeal to a later generation, but Jackson still remained an ongoing symbol of the nation. In the turbulent days of the 1850s, however, his stand in favor of the nation at the expense of the minority rights of South Carolina seemed less ideologically sound to Texans. Not only were they a later generation, but their experiences had shown them that the nation was not unqualifiably good. Jackson's voice and presence, which had been so strong in the 1840s and early 1850s, began to ebb with the passage of time and the impact of events. Like Sam Houston, his potency as a symbol of the nation decreased. 22 By the start of 1858 an increasing number of Texas Democrats viewed John C. Calhoun and not Andrew Jackson or Sam Houston as a more proper hero. Not only did Calhoun defend minority rights against the encroachments of the federal government and the North, Calhoun symbolized the plantation South. The willingness of the Democrats to move to a more radical defense of slavery and southern rights in 1858 was directly related to the increasing importance within Texas of an economy and a people like that of the Lower South. The growing importance of commercial agriculture based upon slavery, cotton, and the plantation system made it in the interest of Texans to align themselves with the Deep South. The increasingly high percentage of Texans who emigrated from this region reinforced the ties of economic interest with those of friendship, kinship, and common culture. As the Democratic party of the Lower South became more radical and sectional, inevitably the party in Texas was drawn into a common orbit.23 Texas in 1858, though, was still not South Carolina. Its people, economy, and landscape were more diverse, and so were its politics. Within the Democratic party, the process begun by opposition to the Know-Nothings and accelerated by the events of the 1850s and the growth of lower southern influence in Texas could not be easily reversed. A high degree of organization, reliance upon the convention system for the selection of candidates, and an increasing identifica-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 46\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n35\n\ntion with the states' rights Democrats of the Lower South seemed to be permanent characteristics of the party. This conduct was to be the midwife of a new political organization. Without the threat of external competition to keep the party united, estranged Democrats alienated by the convention system, worried by the radicalization of their party, or denied a place in the party hierarchy abandoned it. By January 1858, less than six months after its victory over Sam Houston, the party's unity had begun to crumble. Judicial nominations by political conventions were the wedges which began to cleave the Democratic party. John Marshall, now the state party chairman, was determined that his party should nominate candidates for all elected positions. Nonpartisan judicial elections, however, had long been a tradition in Texas, and Marshall's drive to secure the nomination of a Democrat to fill an opening on the Texas Supreme Court drew fire from many leading Democrats. Nonetheless, Marshall had enough support among party regulars to secure the selection of Judge C. W. Buckley as the Democrats' nominee. Other Democrats, led by George W. Paschal, joined with former Whigs or Know-Nothings like lawyer William Pitt Ballinger and editor and lawyer J. W. Barret of Marshall in support of Judge James H. Bell. They campaigned for judicial integrity and against allowing politics to corrupt the law. Buckley was the only nominee of the Democratic party opposed in 1858, but the strength of the party name did not save him. Bell won a narrow victory in August 1858, and a new political coalition began to take form.24 This coalition's strength was unwittingly aided and abetted by the actions of Governor Runnels and his ideological twin John Marshall. Throughout 1858, both warned of the dangers to the South posed by the North. Both worked to weed moderate men from the Democratic party hierarchy. Both took strong stands in favor of Kansas's Lecompton Constitution and threatened secession if the balance between North and South were not preserved by the admittance of Kansas as a slave state. Both favored the radical step of reopening the African slave trade. By the late fall of 1858, their actions had convinced many Union-loving Democrats that their old party was no longer a suitable home. 25 Already alienated from the leaders of the Democratic party by opposition to judicial nominations or fire-eating rhetoric, m e n like George Paschal were driven by still another force to abandon the party. Throughout the 1850s Democratic newspapers would accuse members of the \"Opposition\" of being \"dissatisfied office seekers.\" There was something to this argument. When George Paschal was denied a place on the Travis County delegation to the Democratic\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 47\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\n36\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\nstate convention in 1858, he was undoubtedly angered. After all, he had been on the party's central committee the year before. As orthodox southern views or orthodox views on the convention system became increasingly necessary for a position within the party, those who held different opinions were driven into the new coalition. During the fall of 1858 and the first part of 1859, a s John Marshall and George Paschal engaged in a bitter controversy over public printing, the split within the Democratic party widened. Some of the backers of Judge Bell returned to the regular Democrats, but many joined former Whigs or Know-No things in a contravening party. In the August election of 1859 these self-styled Independents or Union Democrats achieved a stunning victory over the Democracy and elected Sam Houston as governor and Andrew Jackson Hamilton as a congressman from the Second Congressional District. 26 General Houston's skill and popularity obviously aided this dramatic rise in the fortunes of what came to be called the Opposition party. 27 In his loss to Runnels in 1857 Houston had been hurt by his association with the Know-No things. Even so he had run a strong race and demonstrated that he still had tremendous personal appeal. In 1859 Houston changed his tack. Once again running against Runnels, he disassociated himself from the Know-Nothings and claimed to be a supporter of the national Democracy as opposed to the states 7 rights Democracy. As politician and rancher Francis R. Lubbock put it, \" 'Old Sam' was now out-Heroding Herod in his devotion to Democracy.\" Houston and his supporters combined this devotion with a brutal attack on Runnels's frontier policy, the convention system, and the attempt of Runnels and other Democrats to reopen the slave trade. Evoking memories of the glorious victory at San Jacinto, Houston's record of service to his state, and his constant advocacy of the Union, the Opposition threw the Democrats on the defensive in every political debate. Thus in 1859, Houston added to his hard core of personal followers many Democrats who believed in his adherence to the \"old\" party and shared his worries concerning the course the official Democratic party had followed in Texas.28 Partisanship also helped the Opposition. Former Whigs and Know-Nothings like Ben Epperson and James Barret continued their almost lifelong opposition to the Democrats. Newspapers like the San Antonio Herald and the Harrison Flag moved effortlessly from the camp of the Know-Nothings into that of the Opposition. Repeated insistence by the Opposition that they were the true descendants of the party of Andrew Jackson might have repelled a few oldtime opponents of the Democracy, but the principles of this new group had much in common with those of the Whigs and Know-\n\nBuenger_3149.pdf 48\n\n10/1/2013 7:10:04 PM\n\nPartisanship and Ideology\n\n37\n\nNothings. In reality, the Opposition was their only viable alternative. Those who opposed the traditional Democratic platform or who harbored a deep-seated antipathy for the Democrats could either remove themselves from the political forum or support the Opposition. Furthermore, in 1859, with the strength of both the sectionally oriented Republican party and the sectionally oriented states' rights Democratic party on the rise, the Union was imperiled. In Texas, the Opposition continued to be more attuned to national interests than the rival Democrats. Despite features disconcerting to the Whigs and Know-Nothings who joined it, this new hybrid carried on the legacy of the minority parties in Texas.29 Unlike its predecessors, however, this new party won elections, and the primary reason for this success was the support of disaffected Democrats.
