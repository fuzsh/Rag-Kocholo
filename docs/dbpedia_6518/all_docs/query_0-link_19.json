It focuses most particularly on the Trans-Mississippi theater, which consisted of Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, most of Louisiana (west of the Mississippi River), Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma), and Arizona Territory (two-fifths of modern-day Arizona and New Mexico), but also encompasses adjacent states, such as Kansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi, that directly influenced the Trans-Mississippi war. It is a wide swath to be sure, but one too often ignored by historians and consequently too little understood and appreciated. Topically the series embraces all aspects of the wartime story. Military history in its many guises, from the strategies of generals to the daily lives of common soldiers, forms an important part of that story, but so too do the numerous and complex political, economic, social, and diplomatic dimensions of the war. The series also provides a variety of perspectives on these topics. Most importantly, it offers the best in modern scholarship, with thoughtful, challenging monographs. Secondly, it presents new editions of important books that have gone out of print. And thirdly, it premieres expertly edited correspondence, diaries, reminiscences, and other writings by participants in the war. It is a formidable challenge, but by focusing on some of the least familiar dimensions of the conflict, The Civil War in the West significantly broadens our understanding of the nation’s most pivotal and dramatic story. Charles Grear’s edited work, The Fate of Texas: The Civil War in the Lone Star State, is a collection of eleven essays written by able and creative scholars that analyzes virtually all levels of society in Texas during the Civil War and features the public memory of the war in the modern era. As Grear states in his introduction, “The greatest strength of this anthology is its scope.” Also noteworthy is the fact that all of the essays reflect cutting-edge research and critical understanding from leading historians, and few have been published previously. This essay collection highlights a level of involvement by Texans in the Civil War that is too often neglected by historians and presents Texas as a decidedly southern, yet in many ways unusual, state seriously committed to and deeply affected by the Confederate war effort in a multitude of crucial ways. All members of Texas society (including governmental leaders, military commanders, soldiers, women, and slaves) experienced the pressures and stresses of war. The xi\n\nxii\n\nSeries Editors’ Preface\n\ncontributors to this volume illustrate those stresses by employing a variety of valuable categories of analysis, including politics, military strategy, gender, race, patriotism, class divisions, ethnic identity, emotion and psychology, and postwar reactions to defeat. Far more than previous collections of essays on Civil War Texas—all of which are now badly outdated—this book offers a complex, multidimensional, yet thoroughly accessible set of major contributions to the historiography of the war. The Fate of Texas is a much needed and important addition to the Civil War in the West series. T. Michael Parrish Daniel E. Sutherland Series Editors\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMany people helped me develop this book. Dr. Donald S. Frazier initiated the project, and thanks to an inquisitive phone call I made, he granted me the anthology. Lawrence J. Malley, the director of the University of Arkansas Press, gave of his time (and patience) to make this work possible. Profs. Steven E. Woodworth and Joseph Dawson provided guidance throughout the many stages of the project. Dr. Kenneth W. Howell, my colleague and good friend, encouraged and advised me during our numerous commutes to campus. Dr. Alexander Mendoza, my dear friend and mentor from our days as graduate students, consulted with me over the many issues related to this project. Without the help of the faculty and staff of the History Department at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, especially Maj. Jason “J. P.” Clark, during my three-week stay, I would not have finished this project on time. I owe my deepest gratitude to all my contributors. Their cooperation and dedication to this book made it a joy to work on—more importantly it would not exist without them. Thank you all. I cannot forget my family, my parents, brothers Shawn and Chad, my sister-inlaw Cynthia, and niece Kaitlyn, who all supported me throughout this process. I would especially like to thank my wife, Edna, for her patience and my stepdaughter Haley for assistance with the maps.\n\nxiii\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the spring of 1861, alarms calling for war spread across the Lone Star State. “Men of Texas, Look to Your Arms!” exclaimed Ben McCulloch, hero of many of Texas’s conflicts, in Corsicana’s Navaro Express. He concluded his appeal for soldiers using the history and memory of his past struggles for Texas: “Texians! remember your former victories, and prepare to march to others. You won your independence from Mexico, and will again do it from a more tyrannical foe.”1 With this call and many others just like it, numerous young men enlisted in the army, and Texas plunged headfirst into the bloodiest conflict in American history. Texans realized that the fate of their state lay in the results on the battlefield, which created a time of uncertainty. What was Texas’s role in the conflict? How would the men fare during the fighting? What would life be like on the home front? Once the conflict concludes, what affect would it have on the veterans and how would it be remembered? During the American Civil War, Texas faced similar obstacles as the rest of the South but had additional, unique issues. Unlike the rest of the emerging Confederacy, the Lone Star State still had a frontier and a large number of U.S. soldiers within its borders to maintain the relative peace between settlers and American Indians. Although the seat of war was hundreds of miles away on the other side of the Mississippi River, Texans not only participated in those campaigns but still had to defend their frontier homesteads. Being far removed from the balance of the Confederacy, Texans fought farthest from their homes. Three regiments, part of the popularly known Hood’s Texas Brigade, served as the shock troops of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. Numerous other regiments served in the western theater, defending Confederate territory between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains, the most famous in this region being Terry’s Texas Rangers. The state itself was vulnerable on every front, especially along its long coastline and its borders with Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Indian Territory. Although this threat was always present, and the Federals did manage to capture some territory, there was never any prolonged Union occupation in the state. Early in the war, Texans became the only Southerners who attempted to add territory to the Confederacy with the campaign to capture the Arizona and New Mexico Territory (with further ambitions to capture California and northern Mexico). Texans thus fought in more places than men from any other state, both North and South. xv\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nWith its diverse population, composed mainly of recent migrants from throughout the United States and immigrants from northern and western Europe and Mexico, Texas also experienced internal dissent from Unionists in the north and recently arrived Germans in the Hill Country. Additionally it was the only Southern state that bordered a foreign country, Mexico, which Texans not only relied on for trade but also harbored raiding bandits like Juan Cortina. It was near this border that the last major engagement of the Civil War took place between Union and Confederate Texans at Palmito Ranch. Although the Lone Star State escaped the war relatively untouched, all its people—men, women, children, African Americans, Tejanos, and Germans—were forever changed by the events that transpired. This influenced the way Texans viewed the war and reacted to the consequences of defeat, which we still try to understand today. This anthology brings together a collection of essays by noted historians on Texas in the Civil War and by junior scholars now contributing to the field. Their research provides a new understanding of the role and reactions of Texas and Texans to the Civil War. The greatest strength of this book is its scope. Contributors provide new perspectives on Texas in the Civil War that historians have generally overlooked or never explored before, ranging from new aspects in military, social, and cultural history to public history and historical memory. These studies present important facets of Texas history that can help us understand better what Texans were thinking and how the state affected the history of the United States. The first chapter is broad in scope by placing Texas’ role in the Civil War in the Confederacy’s overall strategy of the conflict, an aspect never examined in its entirety. Joseph G. Dawson III contends that Texas related to Confederate national strategy in four ways: the New Mexico Campaign, the defense of the port of Galveston, frontier and border defense, and the development of a railroad system in the Southwest. Central to this study is Pres. Jefferson Davis’s interpretation of the state’s role in the overall strategy of the Confederacy and how the status and significance of Texas changed or shifted between 1861 and 1865. Dawson clearly demonstrates that Texas and the Trans-Mississippi as a whole were not just an afterthought to the Confederate government and army but a vital component to the wide-ranging goals of the Southern nation. The following two chapters take a more intimate look at Texas soldiers. Beginning with Bell I. Wiley’s works during the 1940s and 1950s, historians started examining the soldiers’ experiences, concerns, and lifestyles. Yet common Texans only began to receive scholarly attention in the 1990s. Richard Lowe’s essay examines the nature of the relationship between Texas Confederate soldiers\n\nIntroduction xvii\n\nand their wives and children. Were these men the cold, distant, and forbidding authoritarians only minimally involved in the nurturing of their children that some historians have identified as the typical American father of the nineteenth century? Or were they, as other scholars have insisted, warm, supportive, affectionate, and directly involved in the lives of their children? The same general question applies to the soldiers’ relationships with their wives. Were these men austere patriarchs who regarded their spouses as domestic servants who also occasionally bore children? Or did they have close, affectionate ties to their wives and accord them respect as partners in family affairs? Through the use of wartime letters and diaries of Texas soldiers from all three theaters of the war, Lowe shatters the preconceived attitudes toward nineteenth-century men.2 In his essay Charles D. Grear examines the reasons Texans left the Lone Star State to risk their lives east of the Mississippi River. Why these men fought in the Civil War is a topic historians have attempted to study through many different lenses. Very few people have examined Texans in particular, especially the reasons they fought so far from their home and hearths. Before the secession crisis, waves of migrants from the eastern United States settled within the borders of Texas. But the new arrivals never severed their attachments to their former hometowns and family members in the East. Maintaining these ties allowed these individuals to feel that they had more than one home. When the war started, these attachments heavily influenced Texans in their decision to fight and which unit they would join. The remoteness of the state from the seat of war increased their desire to return east and help defend the towns they were raised in and the extended families they left behind. By analyzing the most famous Texas units, Hood’s Texas Brigade and Terry’s Texas Rangers, as well as other of the state’s commands, Grear uncovers these men’s desire to fight east of the Mississippi River. The Civil War not only affected the lives of those Texans in the army but also those remaining on the home front. The next four chapters examine events and people in the Lone Star State during the war. Although there is considerable research already on many aspects of the home front, these essays reexamine, elaborate, or present a modern approach to older topics. With newly uncovered documents, Richard B. McCaslin reexamines the Great Hanging at Gainesville, the greatest wartime atrocity in American history. Texas militia on October 1, 1862, fanned out through several counties along the Red River, arresting more than two hundred suspected Unionists. In Gainesville, the seat of government for Cooke County, vigilantes executed at least forty-two suspects for conspiring to commit treason and foment an insurrection. Few of the victims had plotted to usurp Confederate authority, and most were innocent of abolitionist sentiments, but\n\nxviii Introduction\n\ntheir pleas made little difference. Others were lynched in nearby counties as well, but the Great Hanging claimed the most lives, and Gainesville became the community most closely identified with such atrocities in subsequent accounts. This event climaxed years of vigilantism against persons accused of fostering disorder in North Texas. Not only was it the most spectacular of several such occurrences in Civil War Texas, it was also the largest mass hanging in U.S. history and attracted much contemporary notice. An inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Great Hanging offers useful insights into disaffection in the Confederacy.3 The subject of women in Texas during the Civil War has been largely ignored in the past few decades. Angela Boswell uses courthouse documents and private letters to examine the lives of and the Civil War’s influence on women in Colorado County. Like other Texans, Colorado County citizens began the Civil War believing that militaristic adventures available only to men would further define gender roles and assumptions. Men would fulfill their duties to “protect” their wives against the encroaching enemy, while women would wait at home and keep the domestic hearth burning. Southern leaders initially relied upon women merely to use their influence at home to encourage men to enlist, to support the war effort, and to contribute to the cause by making flags and clothing. But as the war required more and more men to leave the county, women were forced to take on responsibilities that challenged rather than enhanced gender roles and the assumptions about female abilities and nature. Women took over the duties left on farms and in businesses. Married women found that they had to take care of the financial and public duties of the family. Single women, and war-widowed wives, increasingly took the burdens of public activities upon themselves because they could not find male relatives to do so. Some of these women, alone and acting independently for the first time, made choices that their husbands would not have approved (such as taking new lovers). Others decided that they were willing to make their own choices even after the men returned. Overall, women in Colorado County, whether married or single, entered the public arena in large numbers during the Civil War and acted more independently than ever before.4 The analysis of refugeed slaves also has received nominal attention. Dale Baum here provides the first overarching account of this phenomenon in Texas. He presents a statistical analysis, based primarily on lists of 1860, 1861, 1862, 1863, and 1864 “Negroes Taxed,” of the best estimate of the number of slaves brought into Texas from other slave states for safekeeping during the war and pinpoints geographically the counties where the highest concentrations of bondsmen were relocated. In a more qualitative manner, he combed through\n\nIntroduction xix\n\nnumerous sources, ranging from newspapers to personal correspondence, for all references of slaves being taken to Texas. Additionally Baum provides an estimation about how many slaves and former owners left Texas immediately after the war, based on ratios of “Negroes Taxed in 1864” and blacks registered to vote in 1869, speculating from there about the influence of those who remained on local Reconstruction politics.5 In the next chapter Walter D. Kamphoefner reexamines the attitudes of Texas Germans toward the Confederacy and the related issues of slavery and race, taking issue with Terry Jordan’s interpretation that these residents were “unremarkable” in their attitudes toward slavery and secession. Kamphoefner brings four types of new evidence to bear: patterns of German (non)slaveholding in relation to their economic status, German voting in the secession referendum of 1861, evidence from German letters written during the Civil War, and German support of the Republican Party during Reconstruction. In all four of these areas, German Texans stood apart from most Anglos in their attitudes and behavior but, from the limited evidence available, showed considerable similarity with many other European immigrants in Texas.6 The two subsequent chapters represent the first studies on how the Civil War affected Texas soldiers following Appomattox. Randolph B. Campbell examines this influence on the lives of Texas soldiers after they returned home from war. Did these veterans tend to return to their original homes, receive warm welcomes, and resume ordinary lives? What toll did the physical and psychological scars of war take on these men during the postwar years? Did veterans wield notable political power in the postwar South? Did they come to enjoy a special social status in their home communities? Campbell seeks answers to these important questions by examining Harrison County as a test case.7 Carl H. Moneyhon’s essay challenges a major part of the standard history of Reconstruction Texas by examining if Texans were more defiant in the postwar years than other Southerners because they had never suffered invasion nor really felt defeat. This view was given currency to a large degree by U.S. Army officers stationed in the Lone Star State after the war, particularly Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley. Moneyhon looks at contemporary letters and diaries to determine the reaction of Texans to the war’s end, focusing on both soldiers and civilians. His review is not limited to those who remained in the state during the war but also considers the reactions of those soldiers who fought elsewhere and returned to Texas. By examining the letters of those serving in all three theaters of the war, Moneyhon presents the true reactions of Texans in the later years of the conflict.8 The concluding essays consider the resonance of the Civil War on the historical memory of Texans and the war’s interpretation in public venues, a topic\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat recently is receiving national attention and only in the past decade by Texas historians.9 Alexander Mendoza studies the meanings and conflicting implications of the George Washington Littlefield Memorial on the University of Texas at Austin campus. Even though the fountain and six statues to the purported heroes of the South, which flank the pedestrian pathways leading up to the main building, hold a prominent place in the university’s design, the truth of the matter is that most students have no idea how the Jefferson Davis statue and other Confederate monuments made their way to their location on the South Mall. To Littlefield and his supporters, the monuments meant a commemoration of their Confederate history and the South’s proper place in the reunified nation. But to a growing number of students and observers during the late twentieth century, the monuments represented a racist past. Mendoza examines clashing visions of cultural history—from public monuments to public celebrations—in order to reveal important changes in how the memory of the Civil War and the Old South have been employed at the university. Setting the conflicts of Civil War memory within a social and cultural landscape, he traces how Texans have chosen to identify themselves and altered the meanings of the Civil War in various eras to fit their contemporary convictions. By providing such insight on the conflicting identities of Texans and their flagship university, this chapter illuminates how a Confederate veteran has influenced the university’s historical outlook and shaped its architectural landscape.10 The final chapter, written by Julie Holcomb, provides a pioneering interpretation of the Civil War in museums and other public forums in Texas. Through discussions with curators and other public historians who have created memorials, exhibits, and other displays on the Civil War, Holcomb reveals how they have shaped the memory of Texas’s role in the conflict. More importantly she shares some personal experiences about presenting Civil War history in a public venue that incorporates the latest research without alienating any group in Texas or American society. The relationship between museums and the general public over the volatile and sometimes personal interpretation of the war is extremely important to all historians, for such public forums are where scholars can influence those who are not attending college and may not be interested in reading history books. The culmination of these essays displays the wealth and breadth of the history of Texas during the Civil War. Although historians have studied Texas in the Civil War for well over a century, there is still a plethora of topics that deserve greater attention, among them Tejanos in the Civil War, the common Texas soldier’s interaction with Confederate Indians, the Texas State Troops, the role of religion among Texans, the controversial Texas Cotton Bureau, and\n\nIntroduction xxi\n\nobscure Texas units in the Trans-Mississippi such as Bee’s Brigade (to name one). Only through continual research can the true extent of Texas’s role in the Civil War be revealed. It is our hope that The Fate of Texas: The Civil War and the Lone Star State, the largest collection of original research on Texas in the Civil War to date, will serve as a stimulus for future studies.\n\nJefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America. Courtesy Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.\n\n1 Texas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nH\n\nistorians have devoted increasing attention to the Confederacy’s TransMississippi region.1 Especially since 1960, they have treated a range of Trans-Mississippi military, political, economic, and social topics. In studies of strategy in the Civil War, however, Texas is not mentioned or only gets passing notice.2 Texas held a complex place in Confederate strategy. First, in 1861 Pres. Jefferson Davis decided that the Confederacy ought to expand into the West. His background and strategic outlook played important parts in his decision to initiate a western offensive. Davis authorized that Texas serve as a base for the offensive and selected a general to command the campaign. But all other strategic matters related to the state ranked below the western offensive and national expansion, as far as the president was concerned. Second, nine of the thirteen Confederate states, including Texas, had a coastline, and Davis’s national strategy called for defending the coasts. The Confederacy’s list of strategic assets included the port of Galveston, and Texas 1\n\n2\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\ncoastal defense became an issue of contention between the state government and the Davis administration. Galveston was significant economically and politically, but like New Orleans, due to other demands neither the state nor the national government filled the needs for the island’s defense. In general, by necessity and choice defending the coast was underfunded and downplayed for Texas and the entire Confederacy. Third, Confederate leaders relegated most of the frontier and border defense of Texas to the state. Indian attacks and Mexican outlaws crossing the Rio Grande presented no strategic threat to the Confederacy. Likewise, diplomacy and trade relations with Mexico slipped among national priorities, even to the point of leaving some official diplomatic matters to the Trans-Mississippi Department commander or Texas officials. Many Texans concluded that the Confederacy let down its citizens by neglecting the state’s borders. Other factors might have risen to national significance, such as the status of railroads and transporting cattle and cotton, but became regional and state matters after August 1863. Meeting in the state capital of Austin, a town of around 3,500 people, a special convention announced in favor of secession on February 1, 1861, and Texas soon joined the Confederate States of America (CSA). The Lone Star State offered the possibility of contributing significantly to the new Southern nation. Although it ranked only ninth in population among the first eleven Confederate states, Texas showed great economic potential in cotton and cattle. Vast herds of livestock, deemed capable of feeding large armies, were prospective strategic and logistical assets.3 Merchants stood ready to ship a bountiful cotton crop from Galveston. Welcoming large, deep-draft, slow ocean-going ships, Galveston’s heavy traffic ranked it fifth among ports in the South. Although a railroad connected the port to the town of Houston (population about 4,800), limited railroad mileage in the state and a lack of locomotives, railcars, and materials to lay new tracks restricted sending Texas beef to the East. Galveston and San Antonio, two attractive cities that in 1860 contained around 7,000 and 8,000 people, rivaled the size of Atlanta, Georgia (8,000), and were about the same size or larger than other Southern states’ capital cities, including Jackson, Mississippi (4,000); Baton Rouge, Louisiana (5,000); Raleigh, North Carolina (5,000); Columbia, South Carolina (8,000); and Montgomery, Alabama (8,000), the Confederacy’s first capital.4 In Montgomery on February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis took the oath as provisional president of the Confederate States of America. The new nation comprised six states, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, soon joined by Texas. In ringing tones Davis asserted in his inaugural address that the Confederacy was “moved by no interest or passion to invade the rights of others.” Contemporary Americans from North, East, South, or West\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n3\n\ncould have interpreted his remarks to mean that, as commander in chief, he did not intend to use an army or navy to force any state to join the new nation.5 Naturally Davis wanted other states to join the Confederacy, and territories might be annexed as permitted by the provisional constitution.6 As in the United States, the Confederacy’s president took primary responsibility for formulating national strategy, which always involved political choices. Strategy required decisions to allocate human and economic resources and deploy military forces in order to achieve the nation’s political goals. In this case the goal was Confederate independence. In America numerous individuals offered strategic advice to presidents, including cabinet members (particularly the secretary of war), military officers, members of Congress, and state governors. The president established a defensive strategy for the Confederacy. Critical of this policy, the Richmond Examiner lambasted him for a “defensive policy” that “not only cost us [the CSA] men, but it has cost us territory,” specifically in western Virginia and Kentucky.7 Framed not to antagonize other slave states, Davis’s strategy may be summarized using phrases that the president himself employed when addressing the Confederate Congress on April 29, 1861: “we seek no conquest” of the Northern states; “all we ask is to be let alone.” Stressing this view, biographer William Cooper concludes that Davis harbored no intent either “to capture territory” or “go beyond his borders” in 1861.8 Defense ranked high in Confederate strategic thinking, but as Davis looked for ways to capitalize on opportunities he also had to respond to Federal actions. In June, though worried about guarding what he called Virginia’s “long and indefensible border,” the president wrote to his brother: “Troops are daily arriving [near Richmond] from the South and I hope before long to be able to\n\n4\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nchange from the defensive to an offensive attitude.” He may have meant simply to shift to a local counterattack in Virginia rather than a broader offensive across the South, but such a statement indicated that the president was not thinking only in defensive terms. Of course, part of any adequate defense is developing reserves and supplies to launch counterattacks. Davis conveyed that perspective to Congress on November 18, 1861, stating that Confederate forces had responded “to roll back the tide of invasion from the border,” ranging “from the shores of the Chesapeake to the confines of Missouri and Arizona.” Part of that response came in September, when Confederate troops marched into Kentucky, a slave state, “a step which was justified not only by the necessities of self-defense on the part of the Confederate States, but also by a desire to aid the people of Kentucky.”9 Davis’s initial focus on defense set the right tone.10 When the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 12, other slave states, including Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina, went through a formal, though unofficial, process to secede. Historians discern that Virginia and Tennessee were crucial to the Confederate cause. Native state of six U.S. presidents, Virginia brought prestige as well as the naval base near Norfolk and the railroads and the huge Tredegar Iron Works of Richmond (prewar population of about 38,000, though it tripled in size) when a special convention voted for secession on April 17. The Confederacy’s capital moved to Richmond in May. Tennessee seceded on June 8 and joined the Confederacy on July 22. The Volunteer State provided the lynchpin in the chain of Confederate states and boasted the industrial city of Nashville (30,000 population) and the river port of Memphis (22,000). Thousands of draft animals and bountiful crops filled the Tennessee countryside. North Carolina, wedged between Virginia, Tennessee, and South Carolina, seceded on May 20. It contributed substantial numbers of soldiers to the Southern nation as well as the port of Wilmington. The Confederacy was growing naturally by adding other slave states.11 The South and slavery grew together. The Confederacy’s continued growth depended not only on adding the rest of the slave states but also western territories. Davis regarded the vast areas from Texas to the Pacific Ocean as a region where expansion was possible. Like most other American presidents before him, situated in a capital city in the East, Davis looked to the West with great interest. For instance, in 1850 he had delivered a lengthy speech in the U.S. Senate contending that slave labor was suitable for both mining and irrigated agriculture in the western territories. Serving as Pres. Franklin Pierce’s secretary of war from 1853 to 1856, he had paid close attention to military activities in the West, and an army post had been named for him in West Texas. He also favored a route through the Southwest for a transcontinental railroad to California.12 Davis picked up the elements of strategy throughout his life. His views began to evolve from the time of his days at the U.S. Military Academy, where\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n5\n\ncadets trained to become lieutenants, the army’s most junior officers. They appeared to have no need for courses devoted to strategy, but they discussed historical examples of generals and generalship, especially Napoleon Bonaparte. Evaluating West Point’s records, historians debate the extent to which the academy’s curriculum introduced antebellum cadets to the writings of Antoine Henri Jomini, a Swiss who had served as an officer in Napoleon’s armies.13 Jomini wrote numerous works of military analysis. In the chapter “Strategy” in his key book, Summary of the Art of War, Jomini discussed what he called “the offensivedefensive,” an approach that meant “not to await passively” the enemy’s attacks. Instead, a thoughtful leader must be watchful and willing to take counteractions that “may be advantageous in strategy as well as in tactics.” Graduating from West Point in 1828, Davis served as a subaltern until 1835 and, holding the rank of colonel from 1846 to 1847, commanded a volunteer infantry regiment during the Mexican War.14 In his memoir Davis described his Civil War strategy, calling it the “offensivedefensive.” Soon after the first battle at Bull Run (July 1861), the president had decided that the Confederate army would act “in offensive-defensive or purely defensive operations, as opportunity should offer for the one, or the renewal of [Federal] invasion require the other.” Turning to his recollection of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s counterattacks against the Union army led by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan outside Richmond in 1862, Davis wrote that those attacks “inaugurated the offensive-defensive campaign which . . . turned from the capital of the Confederacy a danger so momentous that . . . it is not seen how a policy less daring or less firmly pursued could have saved the capital from capture.” Written in French, Jomini’s Summary of the Art of War was not available in an English edition in America until 1854, but Davis, like other West Point cadets, took courses in French and developed a basic reading knowledge of the language. It is logical to assume that the future Confederate president later picked up the English translation of Jomini, but he did not attribute the concept for his wartime strategy to the Frenchman. It is not clear how much Davis knew of Jomini’s writings or if he may have taken to heart the passage about the “offensive defensive,” but his use of the same term may be more than coincidence.15 Other glimpses into Davis’s strategic thinking before 1861 confirm that he had reflected broadly on military matters. Napoleon was an important subject of books, essays, and discussions in antebellum American life, and Davis gave a speech in 1859 briefly indicating that he had thought about the problems or limitations of Napoleon’s expanding French empire. In his fourth year holding the War Department portfolio, the Mississippian showed the wide scope of his interests by mentioning the French military in the colony of Algeria, comparing forts on the Black Sea with U.S. coastal fortifications, and explaining that he approved sending U.S. Army officers to observe European armies in the Crimean\n\n6\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nWar. In 1853 a section of his first annual report as secretary of war had emphasized the vulnerability of the strip of U.S. states and territories on the Pacific, “from its wealth . . . the most inviting and from its remoteness is, of all our possessions, the most exposed to the attack of a foreign enemy.” He recommended more forts and arsenals in California, admitted as a state in 1850. Again he mentioned that irrigation in the West “would furnish the means to convert a sterile waste into a fertile region, . . . and add to the power and wealth of the United States, by extending their settlement in a continuous chain from sea to sea.” By the time of the secession crisis, colleagues knew that Davis coveted an appointment as a high-ranking general. Instead the Confederacy’s founders offered him the presidency.16 When Davis adopted an expansionist policy, like the United States had pursued since 1789, Texas provided the best base for any march west into New Mexico.17 Confederate expansion would be expected to enhance nationalism among its citizens. And the Lone Star State was vital to any Southern strategy related to the West. No matter their level of nationalistic enthusiasm, most Confederates admitted that their nascent nation possessed only limited resources and manpower, and their leaders had to figure out how to make the best use of available troops and supplies. As an antebellum secretary of war, Davis knew that transporting an army across great distances presented great challenges. Deciding to add an element of offense to his strategy, the president sought to exploit the possibilities of territorial expansion and perceived Northern weakness. The western offensive was his first notable departure from a basic defensive strategy.18 Davis ordered a departure from the defensive for multiple reasons. He took steps that he believed would bolster Confederate nationalism and contribute to winning independence. Introducing Southern forces into the western territories could promote Confederate expansion. This in turn could boost morale while encouraging Europeans to support the CSA or at least offer it official diplomatic recognition. Such an offensive would challenge the United States for control of some of the West, perhaps draining away Union resources that might be assigned to other theaters. The offensive would also challenge the Union by expanding slavery into the region. Although Davis professed that the Confederacy had “no interest . . . to invade the rights of others,” in July 1861, less than five months after his inauguration and three months after Confederate cannon fired on Fort Sumter, he met in Richmond with a former U.S. Army major, Henry Hopkins Sibley, to discuss possible military actions in the West. A native of Natchitoches, Louisiana, and a graduate of West Point in 1838, Sibley had been stationed mostly in the Trans-Mississippi during his twenty-two-year career. Approaching the presi-\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n7\n\ndent with a bold strategic idea, Sibley recommended a military offensive into New Mexico Territory and asked to lead it. As then configured, New Mexico was a huge expanse stretching from the western boundary of Texas to California. Sometimes called “Arizona,” the southern half of New Mexico Territory below the 34th parallel contained vocal Confederate sympathizers seeking to affiliate with the new nation.19 Sibley had served in the region and described to Davis what he knew about the situation there. Some Federal military units had moved out of the territory, leaving behind only weakened garrisons. New Mexico appeared vulnerable. Southern sympathizers in Arizona already might have acted, assisted by Texans, to claim that area for the Confederacy. Texas formed a crucial part in Sibley’s western strategy. Using the state as a base, he intended to raise regiments of volunteers for Confederate service and march to Santa Fe and possibly points west.20 Sibley’s attractive proposal evidently captivated Davis, but it appears likely that the president had been considering action in the Southwest for several weeks. In April Secretary of War Leroy Pope Walker had presented Davis with a lengthy report on several matters, such as coastal defense in several states, including Texas. Toward the end of this report, Walker linked Texas and the Southwest: “The importance of the question of the defenses of Texas is greatly enhanced by their connection with the future probable annexation of New Mexico and Arizona to this Confederacy.” Sibley met with Davis in July, but Walker postulated in April: “Recent events render it manifest that the most friendly disposition in those Territories exists toward this Government.” The war minister concluded, “[a] vigorous protection of the frontier of Texas bordering upon them [New Mexico and Arizona] must contribute to strengthen their confidence in our ability to maintain our own independence and to secure the permanent safety of all who shall adopt our flag.” In Montgomery hustle and bustle attended the creation of the Confederacy back in April. In Richmond, as a commander in chief at war, Davis made executive decisions every day in a crisis atmosphere during July. When Sibley sat in the president’s office, a large Union army, led by Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell, menaced the capital, with a major battle fought at Bull Run (Manassas) a few days later.21 For Davis, adding New Mexico to the Confederacy created a dilemma. One might think that he would have to forsake his words about not “invading the rights of others,” or by implication not invading territory outside the boundaries of states that had seceded and formed the Confederacy. But another notion presented itself. The president found it important that numerous Arizona residents had announced their loyalty to the Confederacy and their desire to have their area become part of the Southern nation. Davis was an honorable Southerner, and he would take offense if accused of violating his word given in\n\n8\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\npublic or private, and a president’s inaugural address was very public indeed.22 That Arizonans wanted to join the Confederacy—to “adopt our flag,” as Secretary Walker stated—allowed him to condone Confederate troops moving into New Mexico Territory. From the viewpoint of Davis and other Southerners, a military offensive into Arizona thus was not an “invasion.”23 Banking that Sibley and Secretary Walker had assessed the situation correctly, Davis adopted the idea that a modest force—only a few thousand soldiers —could annex the territory and push the Confederacy to the border of California. Many Americans knew that in the Mexican War, an expedition of around fifteen hundred American soldiers had captured Santa Fe easily and a few hundred had seized California from Mexico in 1846. Given the small size of American armies up to 1861, an expedition of two or three thousand soldiers was not deemed too small to produce significant results.24 Success of a Confederate offensive into New Mexico held out appealing returns. It could provide land for a southern transcontinental railroad. Southern sympathizers in other western territories might find encouragement to request Confederate support. This included Colorado, containing lead and silver mines, and Nevada, with rich discoveries of silver near Virginia City. Also attractive was Utah Territory, where disgruntled and resentful Mormons might align with the South because the U.S. government had deployed the army to suppress their attempt at religious separatism.25 The ultimate prize was the state of California, as Confederate veteran Trevanion Teel asserted after the war. California held multiple attractions, including legendary gold fields, the ports of San Francisco and San Diego, and agricultural land for cotton and other crops. Furthermore, gaining California could mean a bigger bonanza for morale: Davis’s nation would reach from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, making the Confederacy a transcontinental power and, as Teel pointed out, yielding more land for slavery’s expansion.26 In 1846 the United States had negotiated with Britain for a portion of Oregon and had accessioned California in 1848 after the Mexican War. Possessing much of the Pacific Coast made the United States a continental nation of great potential. And with the Union breaking up in 1861, Southern leaders wanted to inherit parts of the West.27 With several states announcing for secession, the Union seemed fragile, and in his inaugural address in March 1861, Pres. Abraham Lincoln implied that other states could leave as well. Perhaps California and Oregon would form their own republic. From California, Maj. Gen. Edwin Sumner had sent reports informing the U.S. Army Adjutant General’s Office about his concern that while most Californians evidenced a “strong Union feeling,” as many as “20,000 secession voters [were] in this state.” Sumner probably overestimated their num-\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n9\n\nbers, but in mid-1861 on his list of worries, one was the specific threat that Confederate forces moving west from Texas might inspire these western secessionists. In Richmond government authorities had difficulty assessing the strength of Southern support in California’s lightly populated southern counties. Regardless, Confederate military forces needed to annex New Mexico to begin expanding the CSA into the western territories.28 Operating on their own initiative, Texans rushed into Arizona on behalf of the Confederacy. On August 1, 1861, Lt. Col. John R. Baylor, leading three hundred soldiers of the Second Regiment, Texas Mounted Rifles, found the support he expected and established the Confederate Territory of Arizona. Transplanted from Kentucky to Texas twenty years earlier, Baylor had a reputation as an Indian fighter and newspaper publisher, briefly holding a seat in the Texas legislature. He picked the town of Mesilla, about fifty miles north of El Paso, to serve as Arizona’s territorial capital. According to his ambitious proclamation, the territorial boundary ran along the 34th parallel from Texas out to the California border. Baylor stated part of his purpose in a report to a superior officer: Arizona’s minerals could be helpful to the CSA, but holding the territory afforded “an outlet to the Pacific, . . . a matter of some importance to our Government.” Hearing about Baylor’s success, Richmond authorities acted on his proclamation on January 18, 1862, when the Confederate Congress voted to add Arizona Territory to the nation. A month later President Davis proudly informed his fellow countrymen that an official (but nonvoting) delegate represented Arizona in Congress. From his viewpoint, the Confederacy now touched California.29 Building upon these tantalizing western prospects held the lure of greatly increasing nationalism in the new nation. Historians continue to debate the strength, depth, and longevity of Confederate nationalism. Drew Gilpin Faust has postulated that “Nationalism is contingent; its creation is a process.” Part of that process could involve expanding geographic boundaries. Faust also has made the point that “Confederate nationalism was formed by the limits of the possible.”30 So much seemed possible to Jefferson Davis in the summer of 1861, including the idea of a transcontinental nation. The success of Confederate arms in the West in adding new lands to the nation logically would provide a boost to national pride and patriotism. Yet defeat might disappoint Southerners and undermine, even slightly, their devotion to the new CSA. To support Colonel Baylor’s position, a military expedition would strengthen the hold of the Confederacy on New Mexico and could lead to other gains in the West. It probably would reap diplomatic benefits as well. Capt. Gurden Chapin, a thoughtful U.S. Army officer in Santa Fe, contended that the CSA’s territorial growth might increase its chances for European recognition. Thus the\n\n10\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nConfederates sought to advance into the West, resulting in armed clashes with Federal forces determined to maintain Union authority in the region.31 Adding other Trans-Mississippi states already provided building blocks for the Confederacy’s western growth and the potential for increased nationalism. Arkansas had seceded on May 6, 1861, and joined the CSA. Davis anticipated the secession of Missouri, the other slave state west of the Mississippi River. But three Union states bracketed Missouri: Illinois to the east, Iowa to the north, and to the west Kansas, newly admitted to the Union on January 29. Nevertheless, pro-Confederate Missourians pushed ahead with their intent to take their state into the new nation. They were rewarded later, in October 1861, when a rump session of the Missouri legislature claimed to authorize secession. That was enough for the Confederate Congress. In November it officially voted to seat Missouri’s senators and congressmen and add another star to the Confederate flag. At that point all or parts of four Confederate states—Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri—were west of the Mississippi River.32 East of the river, Confederates arranged to add another state, Kentucky. Luring Kentucky was a matter of both prestige and politics. Davis and Lincoln were both natives of the state. Beside that, in September 1861, writing a letter to a confidant, Lincoln emphasized Kentucky’s strategic geographical importance to both sides: “I think that to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game [the war]. Kentucky gone, we can not hold Missouri, nor, I think, Maryland.” The president did not spell out that if the CSA added Kentucky, it would move the Confederacy’s northern border to the Ohio River and include the city of Louisville (61,000 population), with the base of the great Louisville and Nashville Railroad and several factories. For weeks after the firing on Fort Sumter, Blue Grass politicians had asserted a policy of “neutrality,” but that was a flimsy pretense. Confederate troops crossed into the state in September, and a sizable faction of sympathizers bolted from the legislature. On December 10 that group voted for Kentucky to join the CSA. Again seizing the moment, the Confederate Congress welcomed this opportunity to officially add new senators and representatives along with another star on the national flag. But ultimate control of Kentucky depended on battles fought in the coming months.33 Meanwhile, an area north of Texas was open to the Confederacy’s influence. Davis had to think about whom to name as the South’s special representative to Native American tribes in the Indian Territory. He settled on Albert Pike of Arkansas, an experienced lawyer knowledgeable about Indian affairs. Pike’s efforts yielded improved relations with the tribes and hundreds of tribesmen for military service. Nevertheless, some Texas troops patrolled the Red River and operated inside Indian Territory.34 Contemplating a map in the winter of 1861–62, the boundaries of the Confederacy had begun to fill in, no longer having a circumscribed appearance.\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n11\n\nIn March 1861 the nation contained seven states along the Gulf and Atlantic coastlines. By early 1862 a revised map of the nation, as Davis might have seen it, included in the East, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Kentucky and in the West, Arkansas, Missouri, Indian Territory, and Arizona Territory.35 As such Texas would be near the geographical center of the CSA. (By contrast, most modern maps depicting the Confederacy are quite different in appearance, with only a few showing all of the places the Southerners claimed.)36 Of course, Davis wanted the Arizona offensive to add more territory to the map of the Confederacy.37 To continue Confederate expansion, Davis and his adjutant general, Samuel Cooper, needed to determine if Henry Sibley was the right officer to lead the offensive. A forty-five-year-old career officer, Sibley had graduated from West Point in 1838 and won a brevet to major for gallantry in battle during the Mexican War. He had come to Davis’s attention during the Mississippian’s days as secretary of war as the man who designed a useful field tent for the army— and probably for another reason as well. General Cooper, now the Confederacy’s senior army officer, had met Sibley while on an inspection trip to Texas in the 1850s. By then the major had a reputation as a heavy drinker, though the army was replete with officers who drank too much alcohol.38 On July 8 a formal letter went out from Cooper naming Sibley commander of the Arizona offensive and investing him with the rank of brigadier general. Cooper confirmed aspects of the Davis-Sibley meeting: “In view of your recent service in New Mexico and knowledge of that country and the people, the president has intrusted you with the important duty of driving the Federal troops from that department.” Furthermore, Cooper ordered him to “proceed without delay to Texas, and in concert with Brigadier General Van Dorn organize . . . from Texas troops, two full regiments of cavalry [approximately 2,200 soldiers] and one battery of howitzers [about 100 artillerymen], and other such forces as you may deem necessary.” Anticipating success, he expected Sibley to “organize military government within the Territory.” Regular officers in the prewar army had gained experience in California Territory with the complex issues of military government, a circumstance making them superior to elected or appointed civilian officeholders. Those officers were not available to Davis, and it may have seemed logical that a West Point graduate would perform better at directing a military government than volunteer officers or former Texas Rangers. Sibley later also postulated that he intended to establish “satisfactory relations with the adjacent Mexican States of Chihuahua and Sonora.”39 Pending success in New Mexico, it was possible for the Sibley expedition to march farther west. On July 8 Cooper instructed that as the campaign developed, Sibley should “be guided by circumstances and your own good judgment.” This open-ended phrasing leaves the question of expansion through\n\n12\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nconquest officially unanswered. Yet five months later Secretary of War Judah Benjamin observed to the president that after Colonel Baylor’s Confederates had established Arizona Territory, Sibley’s expedition moved to reinforce Baylor, “opening a pathway to the Pacific.” Benjamin’s allusion is unmistakable: Arizona provided a steppingstone to California. Only a few weeks later, Sibley himself stated that he had ordered troops to Tucson “for the further purpose of opening communications with Southern California, whose people are favorably inclined to our Government.”40 The president picked Texas for use as a base for a risky expedition pregnant with potential. But it was not a venture that risked considerable resources. Two or three thousand men, their weapons and ammunition, and some wagons and animals made a modest investment that could pay considerable political, patriotic, diplomatic, and military dividends for the CSA. Davis was aware of the basic military principle of “concentration”—not dividing one’s forces and carrying out so many operations that all were weakened and few might succeed. Confederates could debate if Sibley’s soldiers would have been the decisive margin in battles at Pea Ridge, Arkansas; Shiloh, Tennessee; or New Orleans. Putting aside second-guessing by critics such as Texas senator Williamson Oldham, Davis was right to take a gamble in New Mexico.41 Issues of logistics—supplying and moving a military force—did not restrain Davis, Cooper, or Secretary Walker. As strategic planners, they had to balance opportunity, risk, available resources, and potential beneficial results. Any Confederate commander would have had problems forming, supplying, and transporting a western expedition in 1861–62 using only Texas resources. Assembling troops came first. By August 1861, when Sibley arrived in San Antonio, thousands of Texans already had enlisted in Confederate service and deployed outside the state to Arkansas and Missouri or east of the Mississippi River. With pressures and demands for troops elsewhere, the size of Sibley’s force would have to be modest (especially in contrast to the opposing armies in the East, where each side had fielded more than 30,000 soldiers in Virginia). Future developments indicated that Sibley would be on his own rather than expect much in the way of reinforcements—perhaps he hoped to recruit units of proConfederate residents from Arizona, Colorado, or even California. How many Federals he would encounter remained uncertain; pro-Union volunteers began enlisting in the West as Confederate forces gathered in Texas. Adequate supplies for the expedition remained a serious problem.42 Col. Henry McCulloch, brother of Brig. Gen. Ben McCulloch, the notable Texas Ranger and Confederate commander in Arkansas, complained to Brig. Gen. Paul Hébert that Sibley had “stripped [from Texas] every tent, all the clothing of every kind, and nearly all other quartermaster’s stores.”43 Even so, Sibley\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n13\n\nfound it impossible to assemble enough weapons, wagons, rations, horses, mules, and fodder to sustain his offensive. Transporting minimum supplies for his troops, Sibley acknowledged an unavoidable necessity and decided to rely on capturing resources from New Mexico’s Federal forts to provision his expedition during and after his campaign. Depending on the enemy for supplies decreased the chances for success. On the Union side, Lincoln had sworn at his inauguration “to preserve, protect, and defend” the Constitution. He decided to apply the Constitution’s terms from ocean to ocean, to all of the states and western territories, including New Mexico.44 Therefore, the president ordered available military forces, including territorial volunteers, to keep the Union intact. Lincoln gave no indication that he was dissuaded by Davis’s assertive strategy or that a Confederate offensive would puncture the Union’s will to defend the territories. To conduct that defense, Lincoln benefited greatly from the steady leadership of Col. Edward R. S. Canby. At forty-four, Canby was a Kentuckian who had graduated from West Point in 1839 and had established a sound record on the frontier, winning two brevets during the Mexican War. In New Mexico he eventually commanded around five thousand soldiers, including U.S. Regulars and volunteers from Colorado and California as well as New Mexico. Gathering these forces, Canby resolutely moved to turn back Sibley’s Texans and defeat the Confederate offensive.45 Sibley and the Confederates gained the upper hand early in the campaign. On February 21, 1862, the two armies, numbering about 2,600 Confederates and 3,800 Federals, opened the campaign at Val Verde, New Mexico, on the eastern side of the Rio Grande a few miles from Fort Craig, a Union depot filled with valuable supplies. Sibley needed to cross the river, capture the fort, and take its stores for his offensive to succeed. Soldiers and subordinate officers on both sides fought hard, clawing for weaknesses and flanking opportunities. Tom Green, a Texas colonel, saved the day for Sibley by leading a brazen assault that broke the Union line. Canby’s troops retreated to the west side of the Rio Grande, giving Sibley the traditional mark of victory by holding the battlefield. But Fort Craig’s garrison held firm, refusing to surrender. In one of the campaign’s turning points, Sibley showed that he lacked boldness and declined to gamble everything on an all-out assault on the fort. Instead he tallied political points by occupying Albuquerque and Santa Fe, New Mexico’s territorial capital. With the campaign thus far favoring the Southerners, Canby could have withered in the face of pressure, abandoned the forts still in Federal hands, and conceded the territory.46 Yet despite losing the first engagement, Canby realized that Sibley operated far from his base in Texas and had yet to threaten the largest Federal depot, Fort\n\n14\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nUnion. Suffering casualties and consuming provisions lessened Confederate chances for victory. In other words, the longer the campaign lasted without Sibley winning or receiving reinforcements or supplies, the greater the strain on his army and logistics. Showing resolve rather than folding after one defeat, maintaining sound field fortifications, and knowing he possessed supplies that Sibley needed gave Canby advantages. He capitalized on them.47 Bolstered by the determination of its subordinate officers, Sibley’s army pressed on. Almost a month after Confederates occupied Albuquerque, the opposing armies fought the second major battle of the campaign at Glorieta Pass (Apache Canyon), near Santa Fe. In a sequence of engagements over three days in late March, the outcome remained in doubt. The Federals had received reinforcements, notably the flamboyant and controversial Col. John Chivington and nine hundred Colorado volunteers, who had marched through heavy snow and across rough terrain. Sibley dithered in Albuquerque, drunk or ill, depriving his army of central direction, but tactical gains mounted for the hard-pressed Confederates. The Texans again achieved tactical victory on the battlefield, despite their numerical and logistical disadvantages, when an unexpected stroke practically ruined their campaign. Led by Chivington, Federal cavalry located the Confederate supply wagons assembled at Johnson’s Ranch away from the main fighting. The Coloradoans burned Sibley’s precious wagons and supplies and killed or drove off many of the mules and horses.48 The outcome at Glorieta meant a catastrophe for Confederate expansion and denied Davis’s goals for the offensive. Morale plummeted among Sibley’s soldiers afterward. Within days, rather than receiving the surrender of Canby, his forces, and Union forts, Sibley ordered a retreat to Texas to salvage his own command. The road back to Texas was desperate. Troops lacked food and water for themselves and their horses. Exhausted and hungry, in late April the Confederates staggered into Fort Bliss, near El Paso. The previous January Sibley had harped on his strategic theme: continuing the offensive would have fulfilled the “purpose of opening communications with Southern California, whose people are favorably inclined to our Government.” But his campaign had failed, and without recent information from the West Coast, he failed to understand that the strategic situation had changed. Federal forces firmly held California. Making a remarkable overland march, Brig. Gen. James Carleton, leading Union reinforcements from California, forced Sibley to abandon Fort Bliss, continue a debilitating retreat, and give up chances to initiate a second campaign west.49 When Sibley retreated to San Antonio in July 1862, President Davis should have removed him from command due to his failed leadership. Showing the shallowness of the pool of Confederate senior officers, Sibley remained in uniform, filling minor assignments. In the months to come, Col. John Baylor con-\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n15\n\ntinued to use the title “Governor of Arizona,” but Federal regiments regained control of New Mexico and reoccupied outposts in West Texas, including the fort named for Davis. In May Sibley reversed his outlook on the West, concluding that New Mexico Territory was “not worth a quarter of the blood and treasure expended on its conquest.”50 Standard works on the Confederacy vary in their treatment of Davis, Sibley, and Texas in relation to national expansion. Some provide no coverage, others are quite brief, and a few pack insightful analysis into a few pages. Some singlevolume histories and textbooks of the Civil War allocate nothing to the Southwest, while others demonstrate cogently the role that Texas played in Confederate strategy and hopes for national expansion. Only specialized works describe and evaluate the New Mexico campaign and its prospects for the South.51 On February 22, 1862, the outcome of the western offensive still hung in the balance as Jefferson Davis took a second inaugural oath, following an election for president in which he ran unopposed. His vision for the Confederacy in the West showed imagination, though ordering an offensive into Arizona seemed to contradict what he said in his second inaugural.52 He pointed with pride to national growth since his first inaugural—“Our Confederacy has grown from six to thirteen states”—though he made no mention of Arizona Territory. Continuing, Davis noted the important implication of acting on the defensive. Knowing that Northerners and Europeans would read copies or summaries of this speech in newspapers, the president stated that he had no intention to lead Confederates on “a war of conquest” because “the Constitution of their Confederacy admits of no coerced association.” Davis contended that the nation would operate under “the rule of voluntary association” and that Southerners supporting it (during wartime one year after the CSA’s founding) remained together for their mutual benefit exactly because it was a voluntary association of states.53 As had been traditional in the old Union, the Confederacy looked westward for new territories. Rather than prohibiting slavery in the West, the Confederate Congress and the Permanent Confederate Constitution (revised and replacing the provisional constitution) condoned and protected slavery in the TransMississippi. If the CSA had expanded, slavery would have moved west.54 Davis had reason to be both sanguine and proud of the past year’s developments, but in other ways the Confederacy was on the brink. What direction would the war take in the Western Theater and the Trans-Mississippi? Only a week before his second inaugural, Davis had issued his proclamation recognizing the existence of the Confederate Territory of Arizona. As he spoke on February 22, Sibley’s campaign was underway, having won the tactical victory at Val Verde the previous day. It would be more than a month before the New Mexico campaign was resolved, and Davis wished for news confirming his claim\n\n16\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nto Arizona: a Federal retreat from New Mexico and the march of Confederates elsewhere into the West. At the same time, the president awaited the outcome of other battles. A Confederate army under Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn was poised near Pea Ridge in northwestern Arkansas to push Union forces from that state. Davis’ favorite general, Albert Sidney Johnston, a Texan, had assembled an army to launch a counterattack against a Union army under Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant as it camped in southern Tennessee near Shiloh Church. Meanwhile a Federal naval squadron had assembled at Ship Island, Mississippi. Ostensibly there to establish a blockade of the Gulf Coast, the squadron actually prepared to attack New Orleans. When all of these confrontations culminated in favor of the Union, the first four months of 1862 produced a strategic disaster for the Confederacy. Van Dorn was defeated at Pea Ridge (also known as Elkhorn Tavern) on March 7–8, and another Texas general, Ben McCulloch, was killed in action there. Sibley was defeated at Glorieta Pass that same month and began a tortuous retreat to Texas. Johnston was killed at Shiloh, and his army retreated from Tennessee in early April. And the Federal navy captured New Orleans on April 25, with Union army units entering the city on May 1. By necessity in the spring of 1862, Davis’s strategic focus shifted east. Virginia and Tennessee became paramount, and he also determined that Vicksburg was a vital defensive bastion on the Mississippi River. Thinking about a counterattack to recapture New Orleans occupied the president for several weeks.55 Confederate leaders and Texas governors identified other strategic factors related to the state apart from expanding into New Mexico. Among the most important, Galveston’s port needed protection, along with coastal defense from Sabine Pass to Brownsville. Texas governors along with their Southern counterparts bombarded Confederate secretaries of war with advice and demands for protecting their states.56 On more than one occasion in 1861, Gov. Edward Clark contended that coastal defense was inadequate to the point of the Texas shoreline being “unprotected and peculiarly vulnerable.”57 Originally from Louisiana, Clark had arrived in Texas before it joined the Union and held various political offices before becoming lieutenant governor under the state’s hero, Sam Houston. Houston opposed secession, and a special convention forced him out of office in March. Clark stepped in to fill the rest of Houston’s term (ending in November 1861). Supporting the Confederacy, he corresponded with President Davis, the secretary of war, and Confederate military officers. The governor assertively recommended the good idea of taking cannon from inland forts and putting them in shore batteries. Pushing Texans to enlist for Confederate service, Clark sought money, weapons, and soldiers for the state’s defense and warned the legislature about deficiencies in coastal fortifications.58\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n17\n\nAbout four weeks after Clark became governor, President Lincoln declared a naval blockade of the South’s coast from Virginia to the tip of Texas. Clark mentioned the adverse effect of the blockade in his farewell to the legislature in November. During its first months, the blockade was weakest. Lincoln entertained recommendations from military officers for capturing selected points to provide coastal bases for the navy and interdict international trade with the CSA. Coastal outposts fell to Union attacks, including Norfolk, Virginia (April 1861); Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina (August 1861); and Port Royal, South Carolina (November 1861).59 While the Confederacy demonstrated consistent problems defending its coasts, Francis Lubbock, a Texas gubernatorial candidate, met with Davis in Richmond in October 1861. A few weeks earlier, in mid-August, Sibley had arrived in San Antonio and started preparing for his offensive, assisted by Governor Clark, also a candidate in the election. Sibley’s expedition took priority over other military matters in Texas, which Davis likely made evident to Lubbock, who won the gubernatorial election and took office in November.60 Davis found one of his staunchest supporters in Lubbock, who pledged his “fealty & devotion to the cause of the entire South.” Having moved to Texas in the 1830s, Lubbock ranched and held public office, including the lieutenant governorship from 1857 to 1859. He worked with Gen. Paul Hébert to improve coastal defenses, especially at Galveston Island, where the general established his headquarters. Some Texans might have been lulled into a false sense of security when the Federal navy made no serious moves against Galveston after blockaders appeared offshore. But after New Orleans fell, it became obvious that the Texas coast was also vulnerable. Hébert thereafter buried himself in specific details and dwelled on his deficiencies in weapons, soldiers, and equipment.61 Pressed to set strategic priorities, President Davis and Secretary of War Judah Benjamin in February 1862 decided that strengthening the field armies outranked coastal defense anywhere in the South. Benjamin broadcast notifications to the coastal states. For example, he called for Hébert to strip away many soldiers from the Texas coast and send them to General Van Dorn at Little Rock. Anticipating Hébert’s complaint, Benjamin asserted: “No invasion of Texas is deemed probable, but if any occurs its effects must be hazarded, and our entire forces must be thrown toward the Mississippi for the defense of that river and of the Memphis and Charleston railroad.” Benjamin also lectured Lubbock: “We must leave the coast exposed.” Growing morose, Hébert concluded that the Texas coast was almost indefensible, though he supervised placing cannon in forts and implemented other defensive measures. In October 1862 the Federal navy suddenly demanded the surrender of Galveston. Negotiations permitted the city’s Confederate defenders to withdraw unharmed, thereby avoiding a\n\n18\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nbattle. Arranging a minimal defense and reassigning some warships elsewhere, the Federals soon became complacent.62 Posted to Texas in November after a checkered record in Virginia, Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder sought to redeem himself by recapturing Galveston. Marshaling every available soldier and outfitting two steamboats with cotton bales as armor, Magruder’s enthusiasm ingratiated him with Texans. Launching a predawn attack on January 1, 1863, the Confederates, some led by Tom Green, an officer who had served in Sibley’s campaign, swept to victory after a sharp fight. Some vessels and their crews eluded capture, but most of the Union defenders were killed, wounded, or made prisoner.63 Soon enough, the blockade resumed, providing an evident danger to small, light blockade runners that entered and left port from time to time. The Galveston stock exchange soon ceased operations, businesses closed, and grass began growing in the city’s rarely used streets. The port was technically open until the end of the war, but it obviously was not handling anything near its prewar volume of trade. The blockade prevented Galveston from contributing significantly to the Trans-Mississippi’s economy. A Confederate strategic asset had depreciated in value.64 South from Galveston stretched nearly seven hundred vulnerable miles of coastline for Union forces to attack. Governor Lubbock reminded President Davis that Texas had “an immense frontier and sea-coast to look after, both of which are now seriously threatened with invasion.” Secretary of War James Seddon replied with a view not shared by the governor: “it must be admitted that Texas can only be effectually and finally defended by the success of the Confederate armies on the great central arenas of conflict” east of the Mississippi River. Meanwhile Confederate officers sometimes used slave labor to build new earthwork fortifications even though they lacked enough cannon for them. Hoping to discourage Union encroachments, gunners painted logs black to look like cannon. These efforts resulted in a thin veneer of protection, which included lookouts and mounted patrols to warn of Federal attack.65 The most spectacular Union effort to breach these coastal defenses came in September 1863 during Lubbock’s governorship. Sabine Pass, near the border of Texas and Louisiana, appeared lightly defended, and troops landing there would have access to a rail line west to Beaumont, then on to Houston. Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks drafted a plan to have gunboats support the landing of Union forces near Sabine Pass. Before sending in their troops, senior Union officers decided that the navy had to reduce a modest Confederate earthwork, Fort Griffin, mounting six cannon. There, Confederate officers had required the gunners to take target practice at stakes positioned at set ranges in the waters in front of the fort. Lt. Richard Dowling inspired the defenders. Assisted by dar-\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n19\n\ning Confederate gunboats, Dowling’s forty-two artillerymen inflicted significant damage to the Federal vessels, prevented Banks from landing his infantry in strength, and captured 400 Union prisoners. President Davis, the Confederate Congress, and Texas politicians all praised Dowling, an Irish immigrant and saloonkeeper with no significant military experience.66 Thereafter Union soldiers set up camps or occupied outposts along the Texas coast, including Brownsville and Matagorda Island in November 1863. To keep the Federals from using the short-haul rail line from Indianola to Victoria, Confederates intentionally damaged its rails and locomotives. Rather than reinforcing such modest successes and coordinating a push deeper inland at the same time, these forces withdrew and joined Banks, who launched an offensive along the Red River in 1864. His objective was capturing Shreveport, headquarters of Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department. From Shreveport, the logical next steps would lead west to Marshall, Texas, and into the interior. But the Union offensive ended in failure in April before reaching Shreveport. In the spring of 1865, about eight hundred Federals made a surprise intrusion near Brownsville, bringing on the last battle of the Civil War, a Confederate victory at Palmito Ranch, May 12–13.67 Frontier defense remained of great importance to Texans throughout the war. From the beginning of the conflict, West Texas settlers and ranchers voiced concern over Indian attacks. Following the withdrawal of U.S. Army units in 1861, this frontier lay open to Indian raids as well as a Federal invasion from New Mexico. The Confederate government and the Texas state government disputed responsibility for defending the nation’s and the state’s western border.68 Texas and the CSA also had a lengthy boundary with Mexico. This border held some promise for commerce that might benefit the blockaded Confederacy as well as bring profits to local residents. But bandits and Indian raiders along the Mexican border had created problems in antebellum years and remained a threat following secession. Underwriting costly defensive measures in the region could offset income or benefits of trade and collection of taxes. Raising military units, paying soldiers, garrisoning forts, and patrolling the Texas borders created points of contention for the rest of the war between the state and the government in Richmond. Frontier defense, funded by the Texas legislature and using state troops, remained a political priority for wartime governors. They tried to persuade the Confederate government to provide partial or complete financial support for replacing U.S. Army units at posts guarding against Indian attacks or Mexican intrusions. In a letter to Secretary of War Walker, Texas senator Williamson Oldham also emphasized that “the defense of the frontier belongs properly to\n\n20\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nthe General [CSA] Government.” Receiving limited Confederate funding for units on frontier service, state leaders realized after a few months that if Texans wanted their boundaries defended, they would have to do most of it themselves. Following up on the heels of the Sibley expedition, Union troops gained footholds in West Texas at Fort Bliss and Fort Davis, causing Governor Lubbock to fret that a general invasion was coming. (Such an action might have been worthwhile in the spring of 1864 had Union troops in Texas coordinated with Banks’s forces during the Red River campaign; instead the Union exercised economy of force and stood firm in Texas.) Nevertheless, despite realizing that the western boundary of Texas also equaled the western boundary of the Confederacy, Richmond authorities put most national resources into the war east of the Mississippi River, though authorizing modest operations in Arkansas and Missouri.69 Meanwhile Texas governors, including Pendleton Murrah, who had won election in August 1863, devoted scarce state supplies and troops to the frontiers to placate citizens’ concerns, especially their sincere worries over Indian raids. Soldiers enlisting in state frontier regiments suffered criticism for supposedly avoiding service in the famous units fighting for the Confederate cause in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia. But these men consoled themselves in the fact that they contributed directly to the state’s defense.70 Governor Murrah, in contrast to Clark and Lubbock, professed public attachment to the Confederacy but found fault with President Davis and his policies. Murrah hailed from Alabama and received an exceptional education, graduating from Brown University in Rhode Island before returning south. He set up a law practice in his native state but moved to Texas around 1850, quickly getting into politics by running for the legislature, winning on his second try in 1857. When Lubbock opted out of running for reelection, Murrah seized his chance.71 During his term, Murrah found that Confederate leaders already had decided the major factors of national strategy regarding coastal and frontier defense, but the Confederacy’s commercial and diplomatic relationships across the international border with Mexico never produced the benefits some expected. Trying to revitalize the French empire in the Americas, Emperor Napoleon III used French soldiers to enthrone Maximilian, an Austrian archduke, in Mexico City. Fumbling Confederate diplomats mishandled Maximilian’s precarious regime while contentious Southern policies soured contacts with Mexican Liberals. Confederate dealings with Mexico ranged from modest to disappointing to barren.72 Never airtight, the Union blockade curtailed the South’s overseas cotton trade, and looking for alternatives to shipping out of Galveston, Texans used wagons to transport heavy cotton for sale in Mexico. Ships took the cotton from\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n21\n\nMexico across the Gulf and eventually to waiting markets in Europe or the North. This outgoing trade from Texas into Mexico brought profits to some merchants and produced some benefits for the CSA.73 General Smith explained to Governor Murrah how the Trans-Mississippi Department benefited from the cotton trade to Mexico. By supervising much of the cotton trade, Smith obtained vital money and military supplies to keep his department operating, but Murrah, just as desperate to find money for the state’s treasury, wanted to have Texas cotton agents control as much of the trade as possible. This difference set the governor at loggerheads with the general. Although not as obstructionist or as harshly critical of Confederate policies and leaders as Govs. Joseph Brown of Georgia or Zebulon Vance of North Carolina, Murrah positioned himself among the strongest proponents of states’ rights in the Confederacy.74 Selling cotton to get military supplies and munitions from Mexico and across the Rio Grande was one thing, but transporting those goods from Texas to the Cis-Mississippi was another matter. The great distance to the rest of the Confederacy, the lack of railroads Texas and Louisiana and bridges across major rivers, and the general difficulties of overland transportation hindered the delivery of supplies to the East, particularly after the fall of New Orleans. The situation grew worse after July 1863 with the capitulation of both Vicksburg and Port Hudson, Louisiana.75 In an effort to coordinate Confederate and state goals, in August 1863 General Smith held a conference with Murrah and the other Trans-Mississippi governors or their representatives. Vested with extra authority from President Davis and Secretary of War Seddon, the general increasingly made decisions on his own after July 1863. The isolation of Smith’s command became evident in the coming months, despite Seddon’s contention that “communication with the Trans-Mississippi, while rendered somewhat more precarious and insecure, is found by no means cut off, or even seriously threatened.” In contrast, the department’s civilian leaders acknowledged that the “fall of our strongholds” on the Mississippi River resulted in “interrupting communication between the two sections of the Confederacy.”76 At the conclusion of a second conference between Smith and the western governors, the principals issued inflated reports touting the capabilities of each state and urging Southern patriots to rally to the Confederate cause. They called upon tradition, heritage, and hyperbole, asserting that “[w]estern skill and valor will prepare a San Jacinto defeat for every invading army that pollutes the soil of this department.” The governors claimed to “look forward confidently to the day when these thirteen Confederate States will in peace and safety occupy their rightful position among the great powers of the earth.”77\n\n22\n\nJoseph G. Dawson III\n\nRailroads, another strategic asset, grew in importance during the Civil War. In 1861 Texas rail lines languished in the early stages of development. Companies operated less than five hundred miles of track in the state. Most of the rail lines operated in southeastern Texas and along the coast. A short-haul line connected Indianola and Victoria near Corpus Christi. The most important tracks looked like a spider web spun around Houston. One with promise stretched east to the town of Orange, near the Louisiana border. Another reached west to Hempstead, toward the capital of Austin. A third track went south to Galveston’s port. Along the coast a separate line ran from Sabine Pass to Beaumont. All lines in East Texas provided attractive access into the interior for invading Federals. Nevertheless, neither entrepreneurs nor state agencies had taken the financial risk to construct a bridge across the Sabine River from Orange toward New Orleans and Baton Rouge. And the Mississippi River presented a greater challenge than the Sabine. The wide, fast-flowing river defied the engineering technology of the day. As Sen. Williamson Oldham lamented to Governor Clark, “We have no railroads connecting us with [the other CSA states].”78 Lacking all kinds of materials to construct railroads in 1861, Southerners had unappealing choices to make. The Confederacy needed to improve existing rail lines and build new ones, including in the Southwest. President Davis identified the missing rail link from Danville, Virginia, to Greensboro, North Carolina, as a priority. Congress acted slowly to close that gap, but a majority eventually voted for the needed appropriations. When completed in 1862, it facilitated transportation between Virginia and the rest of the CSA.79 Meanwhile the Texas legislature took modest steps in regard to railroads. It approved charters for new rail companies but provided no state financing. Indeed, by 1865 Texans operated fewer miles of track than in 1861.80 Back in Richmond, numerous matters begged for attention in Congress, and farsighted legislators advocated providing assistance to complete the rail line from New Orleans to Houston. Running near Louisiana’s Gulf coast, the tracks went from Algiers, near New Orleans, to Brashear City (modern Morgan City). The next stops in Louisiana were proposed for New Iberia, Vermilionville (modern Lafayette), and on toward the Sabine River. Before the war the thriving market of New Orleans had been easily accessible from Galveston by ship, thus proving another element delaying rail construction in the region. After Federal ships began patrolling the Gulf of Mexico and blockaders appeared off Galveston, New Orleans still acted as a magnet drawing Southern dreams of developing southwestern railroads.81 But suddenly New Orleans lost its attraction. In the spring of 1862, a Federal naval squadron captured the city. Ironically just five days earlier the\n\nTexas, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate National Strategy\n\n23\n\nConfederate Congress had approved $1.5 million to help rail construction from Brashear City to the Texas border. For good measure, three months later a Federal expedition assaulted Baton Rouge. These actions ended the possibility of completing railroad connections west from either of those cities to the Sabine River.82 Once the Federals possessed New Orleans, the Confederates needed to turn their attention northward to completing a rail line across northern Louisiana to connect Texas with the eastern Confederacy. Businessmen had invested in a short-haul line in the northeastern corner of Texas. It shipped goods from Marshall to just across the Louisiana border at Swanson’s Landing on Caddo Lake. A more promising line developed when workers extended tracks from Marshall eastward to the town of Greenwood, Louisiana, only fifteen miles from Shreveport. From there to Monroe, a major gap of one hundred miles lay undeveloped. Monroe benefited from a track connecting it with Desoto, on the Mississippi River opposite Vicksburg.83 Given the Confederacy’s needs to improve east-west communications, completing the line from Monroe west to Shreveport was a necessity. But this was a project too big to be left to private, local, and state efforts. The states of Texas and Louisiana needed to cooperate with the national government, and the Texas legislature was remiss for not taking some direct action on its own. Completing these connections would have been helpful, even if engineers were unable to build a bridge over the powerful Mississippi River.84 The Union’s capture of New Orleans caused significant repercussions for the entire Southwest. Never easy to begin with, Confederate communications from the Trans-Mississippi to the East grew more difficult. By the late summer of 1863, for several reasons, Texas was unable to contribute much strategically to the Confederacy. The state now no longer served as a base for westward expansion. The Union blockade crippled routine trade from its major port at Galveston, only partly made up by commerce across the Rio Grande. No railroads connected the state to the East. Union military power, combined with geography, resulted in the strategic isolation of Texas for the last two years of the Civil War.85\n\nLt. James R.

Who won battles and wars, and why and how they won them—these were the foremost questions in conventional historical accounts, and few readers asked for more. In the last few decades, however, increasing numbers of writers have broadened their perspectives to examine the ways in which war and society intersect. How does society shape war, and how does war shape society? This double-edged question opens countless new windows into the Civil War: discord on the home front, morale in the army, divisions of class and race, urban development, environmental effects, gender relationships, trade patterns, wartime migration—the possibilities seem limitless. This “new military history” is not as new as it is often portrayed by its practitioners. As early as 1912 the president of the American Historical Association, one Theodore Roosevelt, called for a broader definition of military history. More than six decades ago, in 1943, a young scholar named Bell Wiley published one 25\n\n26\n\nRichard Lowe\n\nof the very best examples of new military history—a book that still influences the writing of Civil War history—The Life of Johnny Reb, a close look at the character and behavior of common Confederate soldiers. Nevertheless, only in recent decades have these new questions about the war attracted sustained attention by large numbers of historians.1 One topic that has intrigued researchers interested in family and gender relations is the interaction between married men who went off to war and their wives and children on the home front. Some writers of family history have found that nineteenth-century American husbands were generally remote and cold, distant from their mates. They were overbearing patriarchs, insensitive to the emotional needs of their wives, who had to sustain themselves without the sentimental or tender support of a husband. Other scholars have detected a very different type of husband in Confederate gray: affectionate, loving, and sensitive to his family’s needs.2 Where did the Texas soldier place in this range? Did he gambol off to war with little thought of the hardships his family might encounter in his absence? Did he regard wife and children primarily as traditional trappings to full manhood? Or was the typical untamed Texan really, at heart, a sentimental and caring husband who longed for a wife’s loving embrace and a child’s playful cuddle? Hundreds of letters from soldiers in three of the state’s most storied Civil War units—Hood’s Texas Brigade, Terry’s Texas Rangers, and Walker’s Texas Division —definitely place the Texans in the second category. Some haughty patriarchs may have mingled among the other troops, but they left little evidence of their presence in their letters home to Texas. The pain of separation from loved ones struck some men even before they reached their first destinations after leaving Texas. William E. Stoker, a farmer from the Coffeeville community of Upshur County in northeastern Texas, wrote his wife shortly after marching off to Arkansas that he was already aching for home: “Betty, I cant express my feelings when I think of you and Priscilla [his young daughter]. My heart leaps, but at the same time being so fare off and cant come home and see you it almost makes my heart break.” Stoker kept his wife’s letters, but when he looked at them in moments alone, he admitted, “I cant keep from weepping about you, feeling so loley [lonely] bye your self.” To make matters worse, he had to face the possibility that he would never see her again: “I want to see you so bad, I am nearley ded but I dont know wether I will eveer be blessed with the pleasure of seeing you any more or not. . . . If I ever get the chance to come [home], I am a comeing like a feather in the wind.”3 Edward Ross, a member of the Eighth Texas Cavalry (also known as Terry’s Texas Rangers), missed his wife and children in Milam County in central Texas as soon as he crossed the state line on his way to the war. “There is but one thing\n\nWarriors, Husbands, and Fathers\n\n27\n\nthat trulbles me and that is leaveing you and the children[.] if I could see you and the children this morning how happy I would bee.” His longing for family affection continued when his regiment reached its destination in Kentucky. On a quiet Sunday night, he had time to daydream about home. “I can imagine, while I am writing this lovely Sabbath evening, that I see you and Sarah Jane, Davey, Wiley, Margaret, all down at friend Ned’s and that you are about now, calling them up to start home and perhaps trying [to] get John Pettis or William to go with you all. Such thoughts is passing through my mind.” Details of daily life that seemed mundane until he left home now called up intense emotions: “It seems to me that if I could see you and the children, that I would be willing to die.” Two weeks later Ross was still fixated on his wife and children, writing that he “dramped [dreamed] last night that I was at home with you and the children and the injoyment that it was to me in my amagination is unexspressible but when I awoke up it was a sad dissiapointment.” In fact, he continued, “there ant a hour in the day that pases over my head but what I am thinking of you and the children.”4 Pvt. Samuel Farrow of the Nineteenth Infantry (Walker’s Texas Division) likewise felt the first pangs of loneliness shortly after leaving his home in Panola County in northeastern Texas. “I wish I was with you this evening and would like very much to eat supper at home with you,” he wrote while still in Texas. “Josephine when you write to me write what is going on and how the Folks is generally throug the neighborhood generally.” Two weeks later Farrow continued on the same theme and repeated Stoker’s fear that he might never see his wife again: “Men never know what Pleasure a home [is] until he is compelled to leave his wife and children. . . . But if I never see you anymore you must remember your ever loving husband.” Arthur T. Rainey of the First Texas Infantry, bound for Virginia in the early months of the war, was homesick almost as soon as he parted with his wife. Rainey addressed a letter to “My Sweetest Little Wife” from Shreveport, Louisiana, just barely across the Texas state line: “Oh, how often I think of my little wife and child.”5 A captain in Farrow’s regiment demonstrated that early longings for home were not limited to the enlisted men. “I know I am hard but I cant read your letters with out shedding Tears,” H. A. Wallace wrote to his wife in Rusk County. A sergeant in the Seventeenth Infantry fought the same demons. John Holcombe wrote his wife, Mandy, “if I could erace the thauts of home from my mind I could make myself contented but the thauts of home makes me spend many disagreeable hours & if it was not for the cause of freedom stimulating me I could not stand it.” When he received his first letter from home, Holcombe was overcome with emotion, even in front of his fellow soldiers: “I never was so proud in my life though I could not suppress my tears to of saved my life. some\n\n28\n\nRichard Lowe\n\nof my friends asked me if any of my family was dead. when I told them they were all well & doing well they laughed at me but it was not funny to me.” Like many of his comrades, Holcombe gained a new appreciation for family"
