It is difficult to put into words how grateful we are to our colleagues for their splendid work and their remarkable patience. For several reasons, none of which can be laid upon their shoulders, eight years passed between the day we launched the project and the day the book appeared on the market. At times we feared the latter day would never come, our dream would die, and a major work of Texas historiography would never exist. But our colleagues stayed with us because, like us, they believed in the importance of the project. And so our dream has become reality. Thank you, Félix D.

He kept it afloat and steered it in the right direction until it docked in the harbor of the University of Texas Press. We also appreciate the staff at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, especially Amy Bowman and Aryn Glazier, who assisted us in getting the excellent photos that accompany this work. All of us are professional writers. All of us are aware of the potential pitfalls that can be encountered in the publishing business, and all of us agree that we have never worked with a better, more professional, more helpful, more accommodating, more encouraging team then our friends at the University of Texas Press.

Cox\n\nintroduction\n\nNearly a decade ago, several of my fellow Texas historians—Ken Hendrickson Jr., Light Cummins, Mike Collins, and Dan Utley—and I met for a cold drink and a discussion on a recurring topic among historians who reside in Texas. As we surveyed the landscape of historical literature and the significant contributors to the field, we came to the conclusion that someone should furnish a collection of essays on those who had provided outstanding contributions to the interpretation and writing of our history and how this has changed over time. Since we happened to have our discussion during the 2003 annual meeting of the Texas State Historical Association in El Paso, we dutifully concluded we should also base our survey on those who had roots in Texas—or who had at least spent a great deal of their professional careers between the Rio Grande and the Red River. In keeping with many other cultural and historic traditions, we toasted the idea and christened Ken Hendrickson and myself as the editors of this august undertaking. Whether this was the hot afternoon sun or the intoxicating idea of acknowledging some of our predecessors, we set about to make a selection of the dearly departed historians and to secure the services of some of our esteemed colleagues in this very worthwhile enterprise. As a result of this afternoon discussion in El Paso a number of years ago, Ken Hendrickson and I are pleased to announce that we have assembled a very distinguished list of Texas historians for this book. History and its interpretation is not a new profession. Recording and writing history dates to the ancient works by the great Greek and Roman historians Herodotus, Thucydides, Plutarch, and Tacitus. Oral tradition preceded written history and has been passed down and subsequently recorded. As centuries progressed and history became a more demanding study of people, events, culture, and analysis, those who chose to study and write about history reflected the times and eras in which they also lived. Even the most admired ancient historians had faults and biases that are reflected in their writings. Modern historians often studied and contemplated\n\nix\n\nthe writings of early historians as they began their own studies. A classical education was often a critical component of the education curriculum in the modern age. Just as with the earliest historians, contemporary ideas and prejudices penetrate the work of even the most scholarly authors of history to this day. A large gap, both chronological and theoretical, exists between the classical approach to history and the modern era of historical research, writing, and interpretation. For most people today, historians serve as the mediators between current generations and the past. Historians strive to present our past based on factual evidence collected from our history. In order to offer an understanding of past events, they devise explanations that include interpretation and analysis. Without interpretation, history becomes nothing more than a long uninterrupted litany of unrelated stories—not unlike many family holiday gatherings. Along with this perspective (which some may appropriately call bias) and interpretation, historians also provide a narrative and sometimes a visual context for relating the past. They bring a sense of order and understanding to events and people that may on the surface appear to be unimportant or disconnected. Historical studies and perspectives also change over time. Each generation is influenced by a number of factors that are reflected in our histories. For example, American “exceptionalism,” how we and those in other nations and cultures view our history, is one of the constant themes throughout our history. Over the past century American historians have been influenced by the culture in which they lived, the education they obtained, and the influence of their peers who study history. Furthermore, more materials for research continue to become available. For example, newly discovered correspondence, government archives that are unsealed, oral histories, and many other primary sources allow historians to refine their perspectives and subsequent generations of historians to depart from established viewpoints and beliefs. This is what brings meaning to history. It is also a reflection of how historians are just as fallible as politicians, doctors, military and business leaders, and other social icons who succumb to poor judgment and suspect conclusions. In keeping with these themes, we selected a group of historians from the nineteenth through the twentieth centuries who were connected with Texas and provided substantive contributions to the profession and our history. Texas and the greater borderlands region is the focus of their histories. They each offered new historical perspectives and interpretations, not just from a regional standpoint but also from the broader perspective of our national and cultural history. As stated earlier, source materials, perspectives, critical studies, ideology, and interpretation evolve over time. We believe that each of the historians selected for this volume illustrates how professional historians approach their selected topics. In addition, each selected historian provided his or her own unique influence in a broader context through teaching, civic involvement, and sometimes Writing the Story of texaS\n\nx\n\ninvolvement in controversial events. In doing so, they also became part of the historical record. In each of the essays on the chosen historians, we asked our contributors to develop a biographical sketch of the individual and the environment in which he or she lived, and to recognize the subject’s significant research and publications, noteworthy achievements, and contributions to the profession and to general knowledge about history. The authors also cover major public controversies or other disputes in which these historians were involved during their professional careers. They examine how their theories and impact have fared over time and how contemporary historians view them; in some cases, they place their subjects in the context of ongoing or emerging debates. Each article is written by acknowledged experts and extensively documented. In making our selection, we cast a broad net to include both professional historians and others who contributed to the historical literature of the borderlands region. Thus we include folklorists, oral historians, and others who chose to look beyond the traditional borders of history. Anglo Texans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had their roots and education in southern, not western, culture. Later historians of the twentieth century moved beyond the traditional male, southern culture to relate a more inclusive story of gender, ethnicity, and the cultural environment. Historians of later generations realized that not only the deeds of a few great men influenced our past; many others who did not possess fame and fortune provided notable contributions with significant results. All of the selected men and women historians on this list provided noteworthy publications and ideas for their generation and for those who followed. Their understanding of history along with human attributes and foibles provided great drama and tension. They also understood that progress, whether in the realm of democratic ideas, economic gain, or social justice, is never a predetermined or foreordained outcome. Some were more cynical than others. Yet all were taken with the idea of historical change and significance. In addition, these men and women were, and still are, considered accomplished writers who share a narrative that will still engage the modern reader in the Internet age. In many ways, we historians are a metaphor for the Texas weather—constantly changing, often turbulent, frequently unpredictable, yet often beautiful and inspiring. Our readers will note that the majority of historians in this volume were associated with the University of Texas. Many of the early professional historians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries maintained ties to the university in Austin for several reasons, including financial support and the existence of research archives and professional historical associations. The Texas State Historical Association (tsha), founded in 1897 at the University of Texas, introduction\n\nxi\n\nreceived much of its early support from that institution. For more than a century, members of the University of Texas history department worked closely with this association and other organizations throughout the state to further the study of Texas, the American South, and the borderlands region. As the profession expanded along with a growing population during the twentieth century, new generations of historians not directly connected to the University of Texas began to make their mark. This study reflects that change both in the locus of interest of historical study and the broader perspectives and interpretations that newer generations of historians offered. Nationally recognized regional and borderlands history programs and publishing outlets exist today at universities and colleges throughout the state, such as Texas Tech University, Texas State University, Texas Christian University, the University of Houston, North Texas University, Southern Methodist University, Angelo State University, Midwestern University, Stephen F. Austin State University, Sam Houston State University, Austin College, Trinity University, Southwestern University, and several others. Notably, the tsha relocated to North Texas University on the main campus in Denton in 2008. Many other regional and local historical associations are located throughout the state and affiliated with local colleges and universities. In choosing the deceased historians and folklorists for this list, we had to make difficult decisions, and we should note that many others who provided significant contributions could have been included. In addition, many current historians who are very much alive and producing outstanding research and publications will also one day merit a place on the roll of honor. For the purposes of this publication, we chose to begin with a select group of individuals who provided groundbreaking research along with a unique approach to relating the history of the region and its people. We also wanted to select individuals who could provide a compelling story for the reader, both at the academic level and at the level of reading history for personal insight. Not everyone can contribute solid research, coherent interpretation, and an appealing story; we believe that the historians we have selected meet these high standards. Thankfully, we also have an outstanding group of contemporary historians who furnished these insightful, engaging essays and, as an added bonus, lists of recommended readings, which will allow readers to engage with some of the seminal works by the historians chosen for this book. Sadly, as we entered the final stages of publishing this book, in 2012, two very notable Texas historians passed away. Dr. Archie P. McDonald, who provided the essay on Robert Maxwell in this volume, was Regents Professor of History at Stephen F. Austin State University. He served as the director of the East Texas Historical Association, president of the Texas State Historical Association, and a Texas Historical Commission board member. Dr. Ben H. Procter Writing the Story of texaS\n\nxii\n\nwas Cecil and Ida Green Emeritus Chair in the History Department at Texas Christian University and a president of the Texas State Historical Association. Before Dr. Procter became a history professor he played football with the Los Angeles Rams. Both of these historians influenced an entire generation of historians, many of whom are contributors to this volume. Both of these scholars certainly will be missed and will earn a place in future publications on historians who have provided significant works, interpretations, and voices to our history. We offer these essays to the reader in chronological order. The early professional historians—Charles Ramsdell, Eugene C. Barker, Walter Prescott Webb, and Earnest W. Winkler—represent the professional historians who set the first modern standard for historical works. The second generation, in the midtwentieth century—Llerena Friend, J. Frank Dobie, J. Evetts Haley, Robert Maxwell, Carlos E. Castañeda, and Robert Cotner—provided new interpretations, sources, and methods. The generation of historians in the modern, post– World War II era reflect expanded research, cultural diversity, and challenges to the histories provided by earlier generations. The final essays on Américo Paredes, Joe Frantz, Ruthe Winegarten, and David Weber illustrate the changing interpretation and telling of our history. We hope you enjoy this presentation of insights into these unique and impressive historians.\n\nintroduction\n\nxiii\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nWriting the Story of texaS\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nL igh t Tow n se n d C u m m in s\n\ncharLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\ncharles w. ramsdell\n\nCharles W. Ramsdell, who was a member of the history department at the University of Texas from 1906 until his death in 1942, was acknowledged as “the Dean” of southern historians during his lifetime. Ramsdell was a southern regionalist who believed that Texan uniqueness and exceptionalism rested on its historical development as part of the Old South.1 For him, Texas was historically southern, and understanding the South was essential to understanding the Lone Star State. Ramsdell himself was a proud southerner and a native Texan by personal background, descended from sturdy frontier folk who had made the westward-moving trek across the Sabine from the older regions of the South during the nineteenth century. His forebears settled at Salado in Central Texas, a place that appealed to them because it was developing as a commercial and educational center along the banks of a picturesque stream of the same name. His father, Augustus Ramsdell, married into the Halley family, one of the first families to settle there. Charles would eventually be one of four brothers and two sisters. He attended Thomas Arnold High School in Salado, a rigorous private institution established by a local educator and named for the great master of the Rugby School in England. As Thomas Arnold’s founder, Dr. Samuel J. Jones, proclaimed, the school sought “to rigidly maintain the high school standard, to supply the gap that exists between the grammar schools of the State and the University, and to prepare for active work.” In young Ramsdell’s case, this process proved successful. After graduation, he worked for several years as a teacher in rural schools at Alvin and McGregor, entering an occupation that was then open to high school graduates because relatively unsophisticated, oneroom schools could not attract instructors with collegiate training.2 Charles enrolled at the University of Texas in the fall term of 1900, where he embarked on the study of a “classical curriculum.” The distance between Salado and Austin, although not great in miles, proved to be a span of great proportions for Charles Ramsdell as he entered an expansive world of ideas and intellectual accomplishment. The university that Ramsdell first encountered at the dawn of the new century was almost as raw and unsophisticated as many of the young people who were arriving from across Texas to study there.3 Ramsdell was acknowledged as a popular and well-liked student. This, in part, flowed from the fact that he played football at the university and enjoyed status on campus as a gridiron hero. As historian Joe B. Frantz has noted, many football players of those early days were rough characters who “openly smoked their cigars and drank their whiskey and beer and played all night as if they were the privileged king’s guard.” Ramsdell rejected such activities. He instead had the good fortune to join the team at the same time that a new coach, Samuel H. Thompson, sternly put an end to such rollicking behaviors. One of Ramsdell’s first road trips with the team occurred in the fall of 1900 when the squad went to Dallas, where they played Vanderbilt to a 22–0 victory for Texas. Following the game, Coach charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n2\n\nThompson and several players who shared his views, including Ramsdell, stayed up all night, posting themselves in the hallways and lobby of the hotel in order to ensure that the more ribald players remained in their rooms and behaved. Ramsdell’s leadership skills earned him the honor of being named captain of the football team during his senior year, during which time he also served as president of the senior class. He helped to establish a family football dynasty at the university as well, since his three brothers also eventually played on the team. These positive athletic experiences caused Charles Ramsdell to develop a lifelong commitment to fair play and proper decorum for all varsity athletes, values that he sternly upheld in later years when he served as a faculty member on the university’s athletic council.4 If young Ramsdell’s heart was on the gridiron, his head was clearly focused on academics and scholarly accomplishment. He proved to have a facile, quick, and ready mind that was well adapted for success in the classroom. He was articulate, hardworking, industrious, and well spoken—just the sort of young man who would capture a professor’s attention. This occurred very soon in Ramsdell’s case, and the professors whose attention he garnered came from the history department, a subject for which the young scholar had a natural affinity. He entered the history program at a propitious time. The University of Texas history department was just beginning its development in 1900, on its way to eventually becoming one of the strongest in American higher education. Much of the credit for building this department rested on the labors of George Pierce Garrison, a stalwart historian who had served on the faculty since 1884. Garrison was among the first historians in the United States to write about Texas as a legitimate part of the nation’s mainstream academic history. His major book, Texas and Texans: A Contest of Civilizations, was published in 1903 during Ramsdell’s senior year in the department. The young undergraduate also knew another of the talented historians in the department, Lester G. Bugbee, a gentle soul whom students considered one of the most inspiring professors on the campus. Unfortunately, Professor Bugbee developed tuberculosis during Ramsdell’s second year and took a medical leave of absence from which he never returned, passing away in 1902. Bugbee was nonetheless an inspiring figure who influenced a love of history in the younger man. Two other historians also shaped Ramsdell’s historical vision during his years as a student in the department: Herbert Eugene Bolton and Eugene C. Barker.5 Since, as department chair, Garrison administered all of the financial aid and assistantships, Ramsdell approached him the summer before his senior year requesting some sort of employment that could help meet student expenses. This seemed a logical course of action since he had been making high grades in all of his courses and had recently been elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Garrison offered him an assistantship on the journal of the Texas State Historical Association and Light toWnSend cumminS\n\n3\n\nCharles queried: “Would the work that I might get on the Quarterly amount to very much?” Ramsdell received his assistantship and the answer to his question proved to be yes. Thus began an association between Ramsdell, the historical association, and the Southwestern Historical Quarterly that would last until his death almost forty years later. Upon receiving his B.A. degree in 1903, Charles decided to remain at the university in order to work towards a master’s degree in history. It was at this time that he developed an interest in the area of U.S. history that would eventually become his acknowledged specialty: the South. He worked with Professor Garrison in developing this interest, writing a thesis on presidential reconstruction in Texas and receiving his M.A. in 1904. The graduate program at the University of Texas was only a few years old that year, and any serious student who aspired to be a professional historian, as Ramsdell now did, received fulsome encouragement from Garrison to attend one of the major doctorate-granting universities, in his case Columbia University. Ramsdell received a fellowship there for the 1904–1905 academic year that made his attending a realistic financial possibility. Ramsdell found New York City an exciting place to study, and although he took full advantage of his academic possibilities through regular hard work, Charles also partook of the urban pleasures available in one of the nation’s largest cities. He enjoyed what he called “this noisy quarter of the world,” attending operas and plays and visiting the museums of the city when he could tear himself away from his studies.6 Above all else, however, Ramsdell remained consistently committed to academic endeavors during his time in New York City. Graduate work at Columbia took center stage for him. He relished the accomplished group of professors who composed the Columbia University history department, then one of the strongest in the nation. Ramsdell might have developed a primary love for European history had it not been for the Columbia professor who, above all others, captured his imagination. William Archibald Dunning taught graduate courses on the history of the South with particular emphasis on Reconstruction after the Civil War. A native of New Jersey, Dunning himself was a product of Columbia University, having graduated in 1881. He joined the faculty of the history department several years later after postgraduate study in Germany and continued to teach at Columbia until his death in 1922. In spite of his northern background, Professor Dunning developed in his own writing an historiographical interpretation of Reconstruction that was decidedly pro-southern in its sentiments. He believed, for example, that the newly freed slaves of the South were inherently incapable of self-government, and hence had to be appropriately controlled by whites under the banner of segregation. Dunning also stressed the punitive nature of congressional Reconstruction, a process that he felt had a devastating impact on the region. He viewed the former Confederate states as having undeservedly existed as a conquered province during the charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n4\n\ndecade after the Civil War. His analysis of the congressionally reconstructed governments of the South therefore highlighted Unionist corruption and graft, exploitation of the Freedmen for political purposes, and the unreasonably punitive manner in which the Republican-controlled state governments dealt with the white ex-Confederates.7 Ramsdell eagerly gravitated to Dunning as his major professor, especially since the young Texan had already worked on the Reconstruction era for his master’s thesis under Garrison. Indeed, Dunning had already been attracting a series of southern students who wrote doctoral dissertations dealing with a state-by-state analysis of southern Reconstruction. Ramsdell soon chose Reconstruction in Texas as his dissertation topic. This project brought him into close and mutually agreeable contact with Dunning, who would remain his champion for the remainder of their respective careers. Charles A. Beard, who was a stalwart fixture of the faculty at Columbia during those years, later observed that Dunning was the historical “godfather” to Ramsdell. At the end of two years at Columbia, Ramsdell had amassed enough doctorallevel coursework to enable him to secure a teaching position while he completed his dissertation. This proved especially fortuitous since an entry-level position had opened in Austin at the University of Texas, a department where Ramsdell as an alumnus had strong ties and for which he felt a great emotional attachment. In September of 1906 he joined the history department as instructor, which meant that he taught lower-level sections of European and American history courses. The following year, 1907–1908, his teaching load increased when departmental colleague Eugene C. Barker received an Austin fellowship for study at Harvard University. Ramsdell proved to be a hard worker, although he privately felt that Garrison somewhat unfairly exercised his prerogative as department chair to teach all of the desirable courses in U.S. history. Nonetheless, Ramsdell kept his counsel and diligently worked on his dissertation while he carried a full teaching load. His residence in Austin enabled him to mine the state archives and manuscript collections in order to research the story of Reconstruction in Texas. By 1910, the dissertation had been completed and Ramsdell received his Ph.D. in history from Columbia University. In those days, doctoral dissertations often received speedy publication with minimal expansion or significant editing.8 This proved to be the case for Ramsdell, who was now also a young husband. On his return to Texas in 1906, he had married Susanna Griffin, who was notable as a descendent of Susannah Dickinson, the woman who had survived the siege of the Alamo. In steady succession the Ramsdells had two children, and by the time Reconstruction in Texas was published, they constituted a young family happily putting down roots in Austin.9 Ramsdell’s study of Texas Reconstruction would prove to be the only booklength monograph based on primary document research that he would publish Light toWnSend cumminS\n\n5\n\nduring his entire career. It was, nonetheless, a work of scope and analysis that would stand the test of time, earning a place, where it remains to the present day, in most bibliographies of Texas and southern U.S. history. “Primarily political and constitutional history,” as one scholar has noted of the book, “it provided only incidental consideration of social and economic aspects of the period.”10 The study proved to be shorter and less analytically exhaustive than some of the other state-based studies written during that era by Dunning’s students, especially the Alabama study authored by Ramsdell’s graduate school friend Walter Linwood Fleming, who would remain a lifelong associate in the field of southern history. Fleming, who was establishing himself on the faculty at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, liked Reconstruction in Texas and gave it a solid professional review. “The work is well done,” he noted, stressing its solid writing style.11 In its pages, Ramsdell unabashedly highlighted his orientation as a southerner, writing in the opening passages that he was “naturally drawn into a sympathetic attitude toward the people whose social and political system was being ‘reconstructed.’” Accordingly, Ramsdell manifested a very stern and critical opinion of Republican leaders in Texas during the era, calling Edmund J. Davis “self-willed, obstinate, pigheaded almost beyond belief, a most intense and narrow partisan.” The book further portrayed the group around Davis as “the most unprincipled adventurers that ever graced a government,” while the governor’s state police force contained as members “the worst desperadoes in the state.”12 These viewpoints reflected Ramsdell’s opinions about the treatment afforded the South during Reconstruction, a region that he felt had been unfairly characterized in the general historical literature of the early twentieth century. “I believe that most of our histories are free from conscious sectional bias,” he would observe several years after the book’s publication, “but some fail for natural reasons to treat the South sympathetically, not only with regard to the period of a half century ago, but also that of the more recent past or the present.” Ramsdell clearly envisioned his own historical opinions as correctives to that situation.13 The appearance of his book on Texas Reconstruction presented the young scholar with the necessity of making choices regarding his future academic career. His teaching position at the University of Texas had been tenuous at best, since he had been carried on the rolls only as an adjunct professor. In that capacity, he did not have full faculty rank and could not participate as a voting member of his department. Moreover, he chafed at the fact that since the fall of 1906 he had been teaching mostly European history; Professor Garrison, as department chair, had steadfastly reserved for himself most of the courses in U.S. history. Indeed, Ramsdell’s senior colleague Eugene C. Barker was also discomfited by Garrison’s reserving for himself all of the desirable courses in American history. “It is very unfortunate,” a friend told Barker, “that Professor Garrison charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n6\n\nis not willing to welcome others in the same field with him, as it would seem plenty large enough for co-workers.”14 That situation had already in part caused the defection of historian Herbert Eugene Bolton to Stanford University, and eventually to the University of California. The teaching situation in the department changed unexpectedly during the summer of 1910 when Garrison died of a heart attack. University president Sidney Mezes promptly appointed Barker as the new chair. Barker quickly redistributed the teaching assignments and, for the first time, Ramsdell found himself teaching U.S. history.15 Ramsdell and Barker each taught sections of a course known as History 5, a sophomore introduction to American history. In addition, Ramsdell developed an upper-level offering on the Civil War and Reconstruction, to be followed later by one dealing with the antebellum South.16 Nonetheless, Ramsdell had previously been complaining to his mentor Dunning that he would like to find a position more to his liking. He was particularly concerned since the publication of his book had not resulted in a promotion or an increase in salary. This news incensed Dunning, who wrote to a mutual friend about Ramsdell’s situation in Austin, “I think this is one of the greatest outrages, and worse than that, the greatest blunder ever made by an educational institution.”17 Dunning concluded that he would make it his special task to find a better faculty position for Ramsdell. Such an opportunity presented itself during the spring of 1911 when U. B. Phillips, another Dunning student, resigned a position at Tulane University to join the faculty at the University of Michigan. Dunning excitedly wrote Ramsdell about this development and told him to apply, which the young historian did.18 Ramsdell contemplated the possible move to Tulane as a most agreeable development and, valuing honesty, told Barker of this development. “I should greatly regret to see him leave Texas,” Barker noted, “but circumstances are such that he cannot expect as much as he deserves.”19 Securing Barker’s support proved to be a wise strategy, since complications soon developed regarding Ramsdell’s application at the New Orleans school. The president of Tulane somehow formed the impression that Ramsdell was a troublemaker and a malcontent on the faculty at the University of Texas. This, of course, was not the case. Once Dunning learned of this development, Ramsdell mobilized Barker in his defense. “It would be hard to imagine a man further removed from the character of a factionalist than is Ramsdell,” Barker wrote Tulane, further noting that his colleague was “a good teacher” who was “plain, straightforward, and likable.” Barker also noted that he hoped Ramsdell would not leave Texas, where his services were very much appreciated.20 In the end, nothing came of the position at Tulane and it remained unfilled. From his vantage point in New York, however, Professor Dunning still had aspirations that Ramsdell could find a teaching position that appeared—at least from an eastern academic perspective—more prestigious than serving on the Light toWnSend cumminS\n\n7\n\nfaculty at the University of Texas. Such an opportunity presented itself the following year when the administration of Columbia University authorized a new faculty line in the history department, an expansion occasioned by the needs of a growing student body. Dunning hurriedly wrote to his star pupil in Austin, unofficially (yet in reality) offering the position. He reported to Ramsdell that the entire department enthusiastically supported his application and hoped that he would consider the position, which would pay $2,000, an amount larger than his University of Texas salary. The only negative consideration for Ramsdell, Dunning reported, was that the new position demanded primary teaching duties in European history. Ramsdell speedily replied that he would give the matter his serious consideration, reporting nonetheless that “my situation here is not bad, in fact it seems pretty favorable.” He also noted that he had no great desire to teach European history, a subject he had only recently escaped in his duties at Texas.21 When the history department chair was informed of this development, Barker saw an opportunity to use this offer as the excuse to gain for Ramsdell the promotion and salary increase he desired. Baker met with Sidney Mezes, the university president, in an effort to convince him to match Columbia’s salary offer. Mezes could not agree to this because there was then in process a university-wide abeyance in salary increases and, consequently, the funds were simply not in the school’s budget. Nonetheless, the president did his best to convince Ramsdell to stay in Austin by telling him that a promotion and salary increase would be forthcoming at the first opportunity. Ramsdell candidly told Mezes that “for many reasons I would like to stay in Texas, but that an opportunity to go to a place like Columbia was a rare one and that I would have more time to do research work there than I have here because of the enormous amount of committee work that I have had loaded on me here.”22 Nonetheless, after much consideration, Ramsdell decided to stay in Austin. “I was sorry,” Charles A. Beard wrote Ramsdell, “that you did not see your way to coming back to Columbia when they were stirring around to find a place for you.”23 In 1916, Ramsdell received his promised promotion from the University of Texas and became a full professor the following year. He later confided to his colleague Walter P. Webb, “I knew all the time that I didn’t want to go and I am glad that I don’t have to go. I suppose that I shall never leave.”24 Ramsdell’s decision to remain at the University of Texas placed him foursquare in the position of becoming a founding member of what would eventually become known as the “Old Department,” a group of historians who remained together as colleagues for almost forty years. This group included Eugene C. Barker, Milton R. Gutsch, Thad W. Riker, Frederick Duncalf, Charles W. Hackett, Walter P. Webb, Frank B. Marsh, and Ramsdell.25 From the first decade of the twentieth century until the era of World War II, these individuals built a cohesive department that made the study of history one of charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n8\n\nthe strongest disciplines in the university and brought a national reputation in professional historical circles to Garrison Hall, an office and classroom facility that was built especially for them and that became their departmental home when it opened in 1926. Ramsdell played a major role in this elevation of history at the university, but interestingly he never became well known for publishing books. Instead, his reputation came to rest on the publication of book reviews and journal articles, his historical editing, and his active participation as both a member and an officer in a number of historical associations, including the Texas State Historical Association, the Southern Historical Association, the Mississippi Valley Historical Association, and the American Historical Association. In addition, he consistently carried a heavy load of committee responsibilities throughout his career at the university, especially representing the faculty in athletic matters.26 It was in this latter capacity that he had a significant impact outside the discipline of history, not only at the university but throughout the state of Texas. Ramsdell had been placed as a faculty representative on the University Athletic Council as early as 1910 and took this responsibility very seriously, no doubt because of his own career as a varsity athlete. Ramsdell insisted upon good sportsmanship and clean athletic competition. For several years as a young faculty member he coached the track team and, in the absence of a director of athletics position at the school, he also personally booked the football games for the university. Moreover, in the years before World War I, he wrote a series of rules and regulations for athletic competitions, both at the university and for high schools in Texas. In that regard, Ramsdell was the person who envisioned and proposed creation of the modern University Interscholastic League, the agency that became the arbiter of high school athletic competition in the state. In fact, he was the author of the 1912 plan that created the league. As Ramsdell suggested that year to a group of high school administrators, “Don’t you think it would be possible to bring it within the scope of our present Interscholastic Association” and create an oversight organization that “could have a general supervision over all high school athletics?” He further explained, “It seems to me at first thought it would be necessary to district the State and have local officers carry out within the district the rules and regulations which apply all over the State.” Ramsdell accordingly wrote the proposal that, in effect, became the Athletic Division of the University Interscholastic League.27 And, in addition to his interest in regulating high school competition, he worked diligently to promote University of Texas athletics. In the fall of 1913, President Mezes excused Ramsdell from his teaching duties so that the newly promoted professor could travel to a selection of universities to determine the structure of their athletic programs, evaluate their coaching practices, and examine their football facilities, the last because the University of Texas had begun to contemplate the construction of what Light toWnSend cumminS\n\n9\n\nwould later become Memorial Stadium. Ramsdell dutifully traveled throughout the Midwest making various site visits, writing a long report upon his return to Austin that resulted in the reorganization of university athletic programs and the creation of a new position he suggested be known as Director of Physical Training; soon thereafter it was filled by L. Theo Bellmont.28 During World War I, Ramsdell assumed the chair of the University Athletic Council, a position that greatly expanded the level of his daily workload as he routinely dealt with eligibility issues regarding individual athletes, the policies of the Southwestern Conference, and the functioning of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association.29 Ramsdell’s most enduring contributions as a historian and a faculty member naturally came in the area of pedagogy, research, and publishing. He undertook all of these activities using a frame of reference of the American South and his self-concept as a southerner. Academically, in the emerging historical profession of the early twentieth century, subspecialties in U.S. history such as “Texas” and “Southern” history had not yet taken shape. Indeed, it would be historians such as Ramsdell, Barker, and their colleagues in the “Old Department” at the University of Texas who would help validate these historical orientations as legitimate fields of professional study. During the early decades of his career, it is clear that Ramsdell saw little difference between Texas and the American South as distinct historical entities. To him, they were simply one and the same. This viewpoint coincided absolutely with the accepted norms of life in the Anglo-dominated Texas of that era and specifically at the University of Texas. From its founding, the university had explicitly manifested a strong support for Southern traditions and institutions. In 1897, for example, the Texas Legislature passed a resolution containing this statement: “As representatives of the people, we request the regents of the university to exercise great care hereafter in selecting as faculty members only those who are known to be in sympathy with Southern political institutions.”30 Ramsdell completely fitted this description, which flies in the face of present-day social values. In particular, Ramsdell often articulated Anglo viewpoints about racial minorities that reflected the prevailing assumptions of his time and that he voiced without question. This can be seen in some of his scholarly articles, which overwhelmingly ignore the role of African Americans in the South. He was consistently attracted to topics that reflected the world of the white Southerner almost exclusively. “The Negro is thousands of years behind the white man,” he once wrote a correspondent, “and the mass of Negroes will never catch up.”31 These viewpoints even permeated his private life. For many years, the Ramsdell family employed an illiterate African American cook named Malvina, who earned a reputation among their friends in Austin as a consummate expert in the kitchen. Ramsdell and his wife often entertained guests who eagerly enjoyed Malvina’s cooking. Most everyone in the faculty community knew about the cook’s unusual background: early charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n10\n\nin her service to the family, she had returned to her own home one evening where she found her husband engaged in compromising activity with another woman. Malvina killed him in a fit of passion, speedily returned to the Ramsdell home, confessed her crime to them, and asked her employers what she should do. They secured an attorney for her, and as an esteemed member of the university faculty, Ramsdell later appeared in court on her behalf to argue that “being a Negro, she was rather like a child who should not be held fully responsible for her actions.” The court found Malvina guilty but, in considering the professor’s testimony, did not order her incarceration; instead, she was paroled to work out her sentence for the Ramsdell family as their domestic servant.32 As harsh as these views may seem today, they went unremarked in Ramsdell’s circle since they reflected the prevailing social norms in the white community. On the other hand, Ramsdell was considered for his time to have been a progressive and enlightened person regarding the role of women, especially in his teaching activities outside the traditional classroom. Unlike other professional historians on the East Coast, Ramsdell and his colleagues at the University of Texas paid particular attention to the needs of classroom teachers at the elementary and secondary levels. This arose from necessity since public school teachers in all subjects were required to take university coursework in order to maintain their certifications. In addition, the university’s Bureau of Extension regularly monitored public school teaching throughout Texas and offered teachers correspondence courses, while it sent professors to various locations to observe teachers in the classroom. Ramsdell engaged in these activities for many years, especially encouraging women to take advanced history courses at the university during the summer and to seek graduate degrees.33 This interest in secondary education also helped motivate the publication in 1912 of a textbook on Texas history on which Barker, Ramsdell, and Charles S. Potts of the political science department collaborated as joint authors. This book represented the first textbook of Texas history written by professionally trained, academic scholars to assess the state within the context of an analytical and historiographical perspective. It provided a balanced political, economic, constitutional, and institutional examination of Texas history that was based on a solid array of sources. Naturally, given the temper of the times and Ramsdell’s viewpoints, it stressed the southern roots of Texas culture as part of the expanding southwestern frontier of the United States. Beyond that, however, the appearance of this volume served in itself as an additional legitimization of Texas history as an increasingly valid subject of professional historical research and mainstream pedagogy.34 Ramsdell, in particular, was very proud of the book and had high hopes that it would be adopted by the State Textbook Committee, thereby insuring its financial and pedagogical success. To that end, Ramsdell embarked personally on Light toWnSend cumminS\n\n11\n\na letter-writing campaign in the spring of 1912, encouraging school superintendents all across Texas to push for its adoption. “We believe we have improved upon the scholarship as well as upon the arrangement of other books,” he wrote, “and that the teachers of Texas will heartily welcome it if it should be adopted.”35 To his chagrin, Ramsdell soon learned that he and his two coauthors had a battle on their hands with their adversary being Anna (Mrs. Percy V.) Pennybacker, a prominent Texas clubwoman and Democratic Party leader whose textbook A New History of Texas had been the statewide classroom standard since its first appearance in 1888. In many ways, although an influential book, the Pennybacker text represented the sort of nonacademic and antiquarian view of Texas history that the University of Texas authors were attempting to correct with their new volume. Pennybacker, who apparently took the appearance of the new textbook as a personal affront to her volume, launched a campaign among the women’s clubs of Texas encouraging prominent members from throughout the state to lobby the state selection committee to continue use of her book and to reject the Barker, Potts, and Ramsdell volume. Many members of these clubs were women who had significant local and statewide influence on school boards and also had influence with the legislature regarding educational matters in the public schools. To counter this development, Ramsdell sought the assistance of a wealthy and powerful university regent, H. J. Lutcher Stark, who was also a prominent booster with whom he had worked on the university athletic reforms. He complained to Stark about Pennybacker’s lobbying of the women’s clubs in the state. “Knowing that your mother and grandmother are prominently concerned in the work of the clubs,” he explained, “I wanted to see if you could not help us by checking any pressure that could be brought to bear on the clubs in your part of the state.”36 Ramsdell’s counterattack proved successful when the textbook selection committee adopted the volume, which subsequently enjoyed a long and distinguished life for decades as thousands of schoolchildren across several generations received their introduction to Texas history within its pages. Beyond the recognition that the textbook brought Ramsdell in Texas school circles, he also established a reputation for himself in the scholarly associations of professional history, an activity to which he devoted much time during his entire career at the university. He became an active member of the Texas State Historical Association at the time he joined the university faculty, continuing this affiliation until his death. He served the organization in a variety of important positions and in various capacities for almost four decades. He was the associate editor of the Southwestern Historical Quarterly from 1910 until 1938. Importantly, he also performed yeoman work for the organization by serving as its secretary-treasurer from 1907 until his passing in 1942, a record that will probably never be surpassed. Ramsdell kept meticulous financial records for charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n12\n\nthe association, recruiting and enlisting members and handling most of the routine office work of the organization in a small space allotted to the association in Garrison Hall, assisted only by occasional support from a student. Concurrently, Ramsdell also served for many years as membership representative in Texas for the American Historical Association, keeping the dues records and monies of that scholarly association for the southwestern United States.37 It was these membership funds that involved Ramsdell in one of the more colorful episodes to occur in Texas during the mid-1920s, a saga widely reported in the press as the escapades of the “flapper bandit.” During the fall term of 1926, Ramsdell employed a young female graduate student, Rebecca Bradley, as the person to assist him with keeping his association records. Unknown to him, Bradley stealthily embezzled the membership funds he kept in his office to support her social life. Shortly before Christmas she panicked, fearing that Ramsdell would discover her transgressions as he prepared the end- of-theyear deposits. It was at that point that she decided on an absolutely unorthodox scheme to repay the missing funds, money that she had already spent. She would rob a bank and thereby secure the cash to replace the embezzled funds, with the professor none the wiser. One morning toward the end of the semester, she attempted to rob the Farmers State Bank in Round Rock, located north of Austin on the highway to Dallas. In comic opera fashion, she set fire to a vacant structure located next to the bank, after which she ran into the lobby yelling, “Fire, fire!” It was her plan that surprised bank employees would be distracted in the excitement, and that she could scoop money from the teller’s drawers. Instead, they remained in place because several of them had seen her setting the fire through the bank windows and had already called the police, who arrived shortly after Rebecca fled the scene—but not before bystanders had taken the license number of her automobile. Now distraught and unaware that the Round Rock authorities had issued a regional bulletin about her car, she drove the main highway south through Austin to the nearby small town of Buda, where the very collegiate-looking, demure young woman boldly entered the town’s only bank, the Farmer’s National Bank of Buda, and, in more traditional robbery fashion, brandished a pistol. She forced startled employees to hand over $1,000 in cash. That was all she wanted. Making her getaway, she returned to Austin, where police recognized her car and arrested her, the ill-gotten gains from Buda still on the front seat next to her handgun. Somewhat improbably, it was Ramsdell whom she telephoned from the jail. He arrived to assist her and posted her bail after she gave him a full explanation of her activities. Thereafter, he worked diligently over a several-year period to have her acquitted, testifying on her behalf in a series of widely publicized trials and circuit court appeals that eventually found her innocent of bank robbery.38 Ramsdell’s other activities with professional historical associations and orgaLight toWnSend cumminS\n\n13\n\nnizations proved much more traditional and scholarly. He began in the years before World War I, for example, to attend regularly the meeting of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association, predecessor of the present-day Organization of American Historians, and also the annual gathering of the American Historical Association. Here he made the acquaintance of leading historians at the better colleges and universities in the nation, who readily accepted him into their circle. He formed strong friendships with many of these individuals over the years and engaged in an extensive correspondence with them. Following the fashion of the time, Ramsdell used these connections to secure a variety of summer appointments as a visiting professor. During the 1920s and 1930s he taught during the summer term at the state universities of Illinois, California, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Missouri, as well as at Columbia, Western Reserve, Northwestern, and Duke.39 In turn, he arranged for his association colleagues to secure reciprocal appointments in Austin, sometimes renting them his home near the campus. Ramsdell’s growing activities in the Mississippi Valley Historical Association and the American Historical Association resulted in his appearing on the program as a presenter and session commentator on many occasions. He also reviewed an increasing number of books for scholarly journals, concentrating on volumes on the antebellum South and the Confederacy. He had been increasingly attracted to the idea of a study of the Confederate government in the years after publication of his book on Reconstruction. By the early 1920s, he openly told colleagues that he was working on a comprehensive survey history of the Confederacy. And, in that regard, he began presenting a series of scholarly papers dealing with economic matters behind the lines in the Confederacy. The first of these came in 1917 when he presented a paper on the Confederate government and railroads, styling it a study of wartime administration. This resulted in the speedy publication of the paper as an article in the American Historical Review.40 He followed this essay four years later with an equally significant paper dealing with the Confederate government’s attempts to control manufacturing and the private economy during the Civil War.41 These articles established Ramsdell in the profession as the historian who would be writing a general history of the Confederacy. Over the next two decades, Ramsdell spoke regularly about the project and assiduously collected information for it. However, at the time of his death, no draft manuscript of the project could be found in his personal papers.42 Ramsdell’s inability to produce a second significant historical study after his book on Reconstruction in Texas, however, did not diminish the esteem and respect that the profession afforded him. In 1928–1929, he served as president of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association. He followed this assignment with a term on the Executive Council of the American Historical Association. By the early 1930s, he also found himself a leader in a group of historians across charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n14\n\nthe South who were working hard to organize a regional professional association for themselves. This culminated in 1935 in the creation of the Southern Historical Association, whose founding members elected Ramsdell as their first president. The crowning accolade for Ramsdell as a southern historian came in 1937 when he received an invitation to deliver the inaugural group of lectures in the Walter Linwood Fleming Lecture Series at Louisiana State University. This lecture series, named for his late friend and graduate school associate, was designed to highlight the work of distinguished southern historians. Ramsdell labored assiduously on these lectures, to which he gave the encompassing title Behind the Lines in the Southern Confederacy. These essays constitute a sophisticated analysis of the Confederate economy and the resultant inability of the southern government to provide economically for the waging of war. Ramsdell offered a cogent thesis for the failure of the South in the Civil War. “If I were asked what was the greatest single weakness of the Confederacy,” he told his audience at the Fleming Lectures, “I should say, without much hesitation, that it was in this matter of finances.” The Confederate government’s inability to manage a stable currency and its failure to maintain a functioning private economy destroyed any chances it had of winning the conflict. This interpretation eventually became known in southern history circles as the “Ramsdell Thesis,” and it contributed to the then-current debate about why the South had lost the war.43 Although the Fleming lectures carried an automatic guarantee of publication, Ramsdell could never bring himself to finish the editing of the lectures, which remained incomplete at the time of his death. Hence, friends completed the task, and the essays were published posthumously by lsU Press. This highlighted a basic problem with Ramsdell’s approach to the research and writing of history, activities that progressed slowly for him. “The chief reason why Ramsdell did not produce was due to his method of research,” one scholar later noted. “He was a perfectionist, unwilling to overlook any item in his search for knowledge.”44 His close friend Wendell H. Stephenson commented on the slowness of his writing by noting, “He needed the pressure of program committees to prepare manuscripts, the urgent solicitations of prodding editors to submit them for publication. He lacked an impelling obsession to speed his pen.”45 Whether Ramsdell reached his full publishing potential is a matter of debate. Nonetheless, what he did write has stood the test of time and remains part of the current bibliography in southern history. His books and articles, however, are not the only legacy that flowed from his labors as a southern historian to the benefit of Texas and its history. Additionally, he was profoundly concerned with collecting library and archival materials dealing with the history of the region. This was an interest that he shared with several other Dunning students from his days at Columbia University, most especially J. R. Hamilton of the University of North Carolina, who was the motivating force behind the organiLight toWnSend cumminS\n\n15\n\nzation of the massive Southern History Collection at Chapel Hill. Ramsdell, in collaboration with Eugene C. Barker, did the same at the University of Texas. These efforts coalesced for Barker and Ramsdell in 1914 when University of Texas regent George W. Littlefield created a financial endowment to collect materials “bearing on the history of the South” for the University of Texas library. Although Barker, as chair of the history department, deserves credit as the individual who worked with Littlefield in crafting this significant donation, Ramsdell played a singular role thereafter as the key member of the advisory committee that disbursed these funds for library and archival acquisitions.46 The size of the Littlefield Fund increased significantly after the death of the donor in 1920, thereby permitting increased purchases. From the very inception of the fund, Ramsdell worked closely with the university librarian and his colleagues in the history department, especially Barker, in maintaining a sound purchasing program that included both book and manuscript records. In regard to the latter, Ramsdell canvassed many of the old southern families in Texas in an effort to secure donations of manuscripts and papers to the university archives. “We wish to know if it would not be possible for you to give them,” he typically wrote one such family about their papers, “or such of them as are not too personal, to the University library. We are doing everything we can to build up a great collection on southern history, and particularly the Civil War period.”47 He also tirelessly queried the publishers of the older newspapers in the state to give their runs of back issues to the university, thus creating one of the most impressive newspaper collections in the southern United States. In the late 1930s Ramsdell embarked on two additional projects beyond the continuing acquisition of library resources as part of the Littlefield Fund activities. The first project dealt with the appearance of new microfilming technology. With the advent of photo duplication and microform, he conceived of an ambitious project that would identify, film, and deposit for researchers in the university library an array of primary source materials that were scattered all across the South, mostly in their original locations, which included courthouses, rural libraries, churches, newspaper offices, and municipalities. Most of the records filmed, according to his natural preferences, would be from the time period of the antebellum and Civil War eras. Securing support from the Littlefield Fund, Ramsdell turned to one of his graduate students, Barnes Lathrop, to undertake this project. Lathrop had come to the department in 1935 on a $200 fellowship in order to study with Ramsdell. Starting in 1937, Lathrop began to travel the South collecting and filming documents under Ramsdell’s long-distance direction. Lathrop continued this activity into 1939, often traveling in the company of his wife, who served as his assistant. The Lathrops also made an additional collecting trip in 1940, eventually amassing for the University over 400 rolls of microfilm records dealing with the history of the region.48 charLeS W. ramSdeLL\n\n16\n\nThe second project, conceived at the same time, involved the writing of a multivolume history of the South, with each chronological volume authored by an outstanding authority. When Ramsdell learned that Louisiana State University and its press was also contemplating a similar publication program, he encouraged both universities, typically, to join together in a single project to be sponsored by the Littlefield Fund. Starting in the late 1930s, he and his lsU counterpart, Wendell H. Stephenson, began working diligently to plan the series, choosing the authors and setting the editorial policy for this major set of comprehensive publications. Ramsdell, of course, planned to write the volume dealing with the Confederacy.49 The writing of this volume never occurred, as World War II and Ramsdell’s declining health intervened. By late 1941, Ramsdell was clearly not feeling well. He was now in his mid-sixties, and although the years had worn well on him, he was clearly in physical decline. That year his physician had diagnosed a heart condition and recommended treatment in a Dallas hospital where more upto-date and sophisticated procedures could be performed beyond those available in Austin. Ramsdell and his wife traveled to Dallas for this treatment during the summer of 1942.50 It was there that he took an unexpected turn for the worse and died on July 3. He might have found it ironic that his passing occurred exactly 106 years, almost to the day and minute, after Pickett’s charge at Gettysburg, the military action that established the “high water mark” of the Confederacy. With his passing, Ramsdell left the historical profession in Texas a significant legacy. In sum, he made at least four major contributions. First, he successfully worked during most of his career to have professional historians in Texas accepted by their academic colleagues elsewhere, especially in the East at the older and more established universities. He did this with significant success thanks to his many professional associations and scholarly activities. Second, he materially advanced the development of the University of Texas in the areas of academics and athletics, helping guide the school through its adolescence to become a mature academic institution. His insistence on fair play and sportsmanship in athletics, along with his role in creating the University Interscholastic League, greatly benefited the entire state. In coequal fashion, he labored mightily to bring academic excellence to the teaching of Texas history, both at the university and at the secondary level. A committed advocate of graduate studies, he directed the first doctoral dissertation in history at the University. He also worked diligently to improve research opportunities there. Third, through his work with the Texas State Historical Association, he was an important influence in legitimizing the study of the state’s history as a valid academic enterprise. His long career as associate editor of the Southwestern Historical Quarterly and his contribution to the organization as secretary-treasurer Light toWnSend cumminS\n\n17\n\nover many decades helped to make it a stable, enduring association. Moreover, the Texas history textbook that he helped to author has had an enduring impact on social studies pedagogy in the state. Fourth, as one of the founders of the subfield of southern U.S. history and as one of its greatest motivators in the 1920s and 1930s, Ramsdell significantly advanced the viewpoint that Texas was southern in terms of its regional identity. In short, for Charles Ramsdell, Texas above all else was a southern place and anyone who wished to understand it historically had to consider its southern character. For him, the South proved to be the crucial element in understanding the nature of the Lone Star State. SuggeSted reading\n\nRamsdell, Charles W. Reconstruction in Texas. New York: Columbia University Press, 1910. This book represents Ramsdell’s magnum opus. It is an expanded version of his Ph.D. dissertation, which provided the first historical analysis of this important period in Texas history. Although by today’s standards it manifests a marked bias toward the viewpoint of white, southern Democrats of that era, the study still contains useful information about Reconstruction and its impact on the state. Ramsdell, Charles W. Behind the Lines in the Southern Confederacy. Baton Rouge: Lousiana State University Press, 1944. Published after Ramsdell’s death, the essays in this volume are the presentations he gave at the prestigious Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures at lsU in 1937. They represent the basic ideas that would have been the underpinning of his survey history of the Confederate States of America, a project that he never completed. In these lectures, Ramsdell advanced his belief that the major reason for Confederate defeat in the Civil War was home front weaknesses in the South instead of military failures. noteS\n\n1.

Ramsdell’s plan to expand the University of Texas itself into the regulation of these activities resulted from this invitation. The University Interscholastic League was created in 1913 as a result of Ramsdell’s proposal to merge the Debating League of Texas with interests of the Interscholastic Athletic Association, which had written rules for high school athletics in the state. The UIL, as it quickly became known throughout Texas high schools, was structured at Ramsdell’s suggestion as a division of the University of Texas Extension.

Barker at the oPening of the san Jacinto monUment, 1939\n\nEugene Campbell Barker rose from humble origins in the late nineteenth century to become one of the most recognized Texas historians of the twentieth century. At the end of his long career, Barker was acclaimed as “the foremost authority on Texas history and one of America’s most distinguished historians” when he died in 1956. Barker achieved his dream of becoming a nationally recognized scholar and historian, but in doing so he became a controversial, combative public figure who endured both praise and criticism.1 Barker was born in the Piney Woods of East Texas near the small town of Riverside on November 10, 1874. He was the first child of Joseph and Fannie Holland Barker. The community of Riverside, approximately ninety miles north of Houston on the Trinity River, owed its existence to the Houston and Great Northern Railroad. Barker’s father, Joseph, owned a general merchandise store in Riverside that he operated his entire life. While the Barker family may have had some economic advantages over the laborers in the lumber industry and the sharecroppers of the cotton fields, they maintained a thrifty household and were among the small merchant class of nineteenth-century rural Texas. Barker recalled that this small town consisted of “a railroad station, a water tank, one store, a saloon—called a grocery, and two or three little houses.” As a child, Barker walked the railroad line to a small one-room school he attended. Joseph Barker passed away at the age of thirty-eight in 1888. Following her husband’s unexpected death, Fannie Barker moved the family, consisting of Eugene and his two younger brothers and one sister, to Palestine.2 Young Barker quit school and went to work in Palestine for the International and Great Northern Railroad. The railroad corporations of this era offered young men the opportunity to have a more reliable income and a path out of the small towns and farms. He became an expert blacksmith and joined the National Railway Master Blacksmith’s Association. He worked to support the family by day and attended school at night but never obtained a high school diploma. However, an applicant could gain admission to the University of Texas during Barker’s era if he could pass an entrance examination. The university catalogue stated that candidates for admission would be accepted if they passed exams in history, English, and mathematics. Barker traveled to Austin in September 1894 to take the required exams, but failed in English. After another year of working at the forge and attending classes at night, Barker returned in the fall of 1895 and passed the tests. He enrolled as a freshman at the University of Texas on September 23, 1895. The year he began his studies, university enrollment was 482 students with a faculty of twenty-five professors, instructors, and tutors. Barker received his B.A. in history in 1899 and his M.A. in history in 1900 from the University of Texas. His master’s thesis was titled “The Unification of Public Sentiment for the Texas Revolution.”3 eugene c. barker\n\n24\n\nBarker’s entry into the field of history coincided with the development of historical professionalism in the United States. Texas and the other southern states of the former Confederacy strove to increase their higher education institutions and programs of liberal arts studies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In addition to this new emphasis on historical writing and instruction, institutions also embarked on efforts to acquire important archival collections. These initiatives were designed to strengthen the educational institutions that lagged behind their counterparts in the North and the East. This expansion aimed to enhance and promote the research, writing, and teaching of history utilizing scientific methodology that relied on primary documents. Professional historical organizations related to the historians and their affiliated universities emerged during this time. In addition, a stronger regional and nationalistic era grew out of these initiatives, as illustrated by the careers, ideas, and historical publications of Barker and some of his fellow historians in the South. During his years at the University of Texas, the professors who provided the greatest stimulus to Barker’s intellectual growth were two colleagues in the history department: Lester Gladstone Bugbee, who taught as a tutor while he worked on his doctorate, and department chair George P. Garrison. Barker considered Bugbee “the most effective and inspiring teacher that I met anywhere during my student career.” Barker commended Bugbee for involving students in lectures, encouraging scholarship and research, and working long hours to improve his knowledge and expertise. He lauded Bugbee as one of the organizers of the Texas State Historical Association and for his work as secretary and treasurer of the young organization. Barker also credited Bugbee for his labors to bring the Bexar Archives, “one of the greatest of Texas historical sources,” from Bexar County in San Antonio to the university in 1899. The Bexar Archives contained over 250,000 document pages of official government records from Spanish colonial Texas as well as Mexican government records from Coahuila y Texas. In 1902, at the age of thirty-two, Bugbee passed away after an extended illness.4 George P. Garrison was considered a premier historian and one of the influential figures in the formation of the University of Texas. In addition to serving as a full professor of history, Garrison was one of the first Texas historians to publish in recognized national historical journals. He served as one of the founders of the Texas State Historical Association and served as the editor of its quarterly until his death in 1910. Importantly, Garrison collaborated with Bugbee to acquire the Bexar Archives for the university. Garrison also worked with Guy Morrison Bryan on the donation of the Moses Austin and Stephen F. Austin papers to the university’s collections. The combined inspiration of Bugbee and Garrison would prove to have a significant impact on the life of Eugene C. Barker.5 Patrick L. cox\n\n25\n\nAcquisition of the Bexar Archives along with the Austin and Bryan papers proved to be the impetus for Barker’s first published articles. In the January 1901 edition of the Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association, Barker contributed his first article, titled “The Difficulties of a Mexican Revenue Officer in Texas.” Barker wrote on the resistance of Anglo settlers to the efforts of Captain Antonio Tenorio and Don José Gonzales to collect customs duties at the ports of entry in Spanish Texas. “The San Jacinto Campaign in Texas,” along with “The African Slave Trade,” appeared in the January 1903 issue of the association’s quarterly. Additional articles on the Texas Revolution appeared in Publications of the Southern Historical Association in 1901. Early in his career, Barker revealed his lifelong interests in Texas history, his interest in opening new areas of historical research, and his passion for utilizing primary sources. Barker married Matilda LeGrand Weeden on May 6, 1903. The couple had one son, David Barker. In the summer of 1901, Barker left the University of Texas to begin graduate studies at the University of Chicago. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he focused on early American history. At the urging of his colleague Herbert Eugene Bolton, Barker attended the University of Pennsylvania and earned his Ph.D. in history in 1908. Barker also studied at Harvard University from 1907 to 1908. He returned to the University of Texas in the fall of 1908 to teach courses in modern European history at the behest of Chairman Garrison, but American history remained the focus of Barker’s academic research and teachings. Although anxious to return to Austin, Barker had strained relations with the departmental chair over teaching assignments. Bolton, his friend and colleague at the university, left in a dispute with Chairman Garrison. However, when Barker proposed that he teach a course on Mexico and the American Southwest, Garrison conceded. Perhaps Bolton’s decision prompted Garrison to retain Barker, the promising young historian, as a permanent member of the department.6 Barker’s decision to remain at the University of Texas proved to be propitious. Garrison died unexpectedly at his home on July 3, 1910, the victim of an apparent heart attack. Shortly after Garrison’s funeral, university president Sidney Mezes selected Barker to become the acting chair of the history department. Barker served as department chair for the next fifteen years. During that period, the department and the growth of its archives and publications achieved remarkable success. Barker expanded its financial support by enlisting contributions from individuals interested in history and the university. However, Barker also endured his share of criticism and became embroiled in an historic political battle between the university and the Texas governor. Among the many initiatives Barker launched as chair, one of the most farreaching efforts was his successful solicitation of Major George W. Littlefield. A Confederate veteran who made his fortune after the war in banking, cotton, eugene c. barker\n\n26\n\nand cattle, Littlefield became a major financial supporter and leader of the University of Texas. Following his appointment to the university’s board of regents in 1911, Barker began a quest, through frequent letters to Littlefield, to obtain donations for the acquisition of historical archives. Littlefield, a strong proponent and a defender of the Confederacy, believed that educators and history books misrepresented the interests of the South. Barker told Littlefield that unless the university received money to acquire important southern historical documents, nothing could be done to provide alternative interpretations. Barker expressed his frustration to Littlefield when he stated that, without the essential primary resources combined with scholarly research, “the resolutions and protests of the South are as ‘sounding brass and tinkling cymbals.’”7 With his appeal to sentimentality and his persistent pleas, Barker succeeded in convincing Littlefield to provide an initial $25,000 gift for the Littlefield Fund for Southern History at the University of Texas. The original committee to oversee the Littlefield Fund included Barker. The committee’s mission was to purchase books, pamphlets, newspaper files, maps, manuscripts, and other materials related to the American South. The initial gift, combined with later funding of $100,000 from the Littlefield estate, established one of the premier programs for southern history archival collections that scholars continue to use to this day. The fund provided for the acquisition of hundreds of archival collections that have served as a resource for several generations of scholars to produce volumes of history, a goal that Barker and Littlefield once envisioned. These included papers and records from antebellum plantations, newspapers, correspondence, and many collections relating to the Civil War. Fortunately, the collection that began with the purpose of defending the southern slaveholding culture evolved in the modern era to produce new histories that exposed the morally corrupt slave system. Newer publications by modern historians utilize these archives to document the ongoing struggle for civil rights in the nation. Thus, Barker’s collaborative efforts with Littlefield, along with his initiatives with other donors, demonstrated the growing importance of private contributions in support of the acquisition of historical archives and scholarly research.8 As the department chair, Barker recognized that he needed to strengthen the faculty through the addition of scholars from out of state. Only two faculty members remained on staff when Barker assumed the chair in 1910: Charles W. Ramsdell and Frederic Duncalf. As Ramsdell noted, the department was “shaken and demoralized by the departure of Bolton in 1909 and the death of Garrison.”9 Barker immediately recruited new faculty in the first two years: Thad Weed Riker, modern European history; Frank Burr Marsh, ancient history; Milton R. Gutsch, English history; Charles Wilson Hackett, Latin American history; Rudolph Biesele, American history; and Walter Prescott Webb, American history. This core group of historians remained with the university Patrick L. cox\n\n27\n\nfor decades and taught thousands of students who passed through the campus of the Forty Acres during the first half of the twentieth century. Furthermore, the reputation of the scholarship and teaching of this core group of historians solidified Barker’s leadership at the university well beyond the walls of Garrison Hall. Barker’s departmental colleagues held him in high esteem, yet a number of them noted his somewhat brusque manner and his aloofness. Some attributed this to a self-conscious attitude. He often seemed uncomfortable in formal, social settings. Walter Prescott Webb noted that Barker “was the kindest man in the world, but almost fierce in his shyness.” Dr. Milton R. Gutsch, who succeeded Barker as the history department chair, wrote, “There are those who consider Barker cold and difficult to approach. Those, however, who have worked with him or under him soon realized that the forbidding exterior concealed an unusually warm and sympathetic personality.” Rupert N. Richardson recalled examples of Barker’s famous temper that was often directed at students: “Once or twice I have fairly trembled at an explosion when he was vexed with some student.” William J. Battle wrote of Barker’s “honesty, courage and kindliness.” But along with these attributes Battle stated that “with his honesty goes a courage that does not hesitate to speak out, always forcefully, often with vehemence, occasionally with temper.”10 During a presentation honorin"
