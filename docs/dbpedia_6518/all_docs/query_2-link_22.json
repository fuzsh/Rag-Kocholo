Blast Effort to revive the Hopes of the g Al. Lant 106,000. Where Abb the names of our Grain merchants importing merchants Bankers and Rob bks. Manufacturers financial institutions and representative mechanics and Labouring men yesterday morning a Sun contained a hat of names of gentlemen who signed a letter to or. John Walter Smith second Only to Tost which was published several Days ago All of which have been added and incorporated in the present hat which presents food for reflection. In the first place there Are not to names of gentlemen in this hat who have not uniformly voted the democratic ticket a any old ticket Quot that the old democratic managers presented Tor their votes. First comes the Hurst family then the Cater family. Carter family Codd family and urn or let or standbys of the past. Then routes d let of candidates principal among which is the Hon. Ferdinand c. Latrobe who is a candidate for the i i Lawre on the democratic ticket and who Alana a letter saying he is going to support the candidate for governor on the same ticket. There might have been some misgiving about or. Latrobe is it is Well remembered that in the Campaign of 1882 it was stated by colonel Marshall and never detailed that or. Latrobe made a contribution of $1,000 for the new judge ticket and then supported and voted the regular ticket. Ii a then we have the office holders and the Tegould be office holders under or. Hayes and under or. Smith. Then come the old regular democratic ring War horses for instance or. Bernard Carter or. Edwin Warfield Gen. Clinton p. Paine Gen. Lloyd l. Jackson Gen. John Ghi of r., or. Andrew d. Jones and a number of other generals who constituted the old Gorman Rasin bodyguard. In their letter they say to or. Smith a Quot your to years of service in the state Senate together with your High personal character is sufficient guarantee that of ejected governor you will faithfully carry out every pledge made by yourself Aud your if these gentlemen will give one distinct pledge that the state platform of the party this year makes we should like to see it. Further of these gentlemen or or. Smith will give one instance in i to years service in the state Senate of his voting for a Tingle Reform measure on his own responsibility or supporting any measure concerning which he had not first consulted senator Gorman we would Uke to know it a Leo. In this letter they further say to or. Smith a that this is a contest on local issues the currency question and All other questions that divided the party in 1895 Nave been eliminated a now of the Hurst family the Carter family the Codd family the Cator family and the other gentlemen alluded to whose valiantly supported or. Hurst in 1895 can agree that there were a a questions that divided the party in 1896 which have been eliminated will they let us know what those questions were who have Quot eliminated Quot them and do they think they should have been Quot eliminated Quot in the manner in which they were Quot eliminated Quot a namely by the defeat of or. Hurst for governor Quot or.
