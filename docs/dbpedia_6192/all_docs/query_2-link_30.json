        "text": "The after school crowd was drifting into the Jegaxunlian phone store, and the staff was ready. Clad in shiny metallic windbreakers that made them look like refugees from ''Lost in Space,'' sales clerks swarmed over the young customers.\n\nThey showed the latest cellular phones by Motorola and Nokia, as well as local brands, Konka and TCL. They raved about new features like wireless Internet access and a built-in Chinese-English dictionary. They hawked plastic covers, in fluorescent red and green, to spice up a plain phone.\n\n''Everybody in China wants to own a mobile phone,'' said Hacken Hwang, 23, the store's general manager. ''For men, it's like having a cigarette lighter. For women, it's like wearing an accessory.''\n\nJegaxunlian is one of 200 stores that line a boulevard in this southern Chinese city. Local residents call it Telecom Street, and it is a popular gathering place for students, street hustlers, even off-duty soldiers. Everyone, it seems, is looking for a phone.\n\nTwo decades after American corporations began talking about China, making hyperbolic statements about selling cars and Coke to a billion people, the country finally seems to have generated a market that justifies much of the promotion.\n\nCellular telephones are a genuine revolution here. Not only are they a way for people to sidestep China's cumbersome terrestrial phone network, they are the status symbol of choice for a generation of Chinese.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
