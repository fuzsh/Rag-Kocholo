        "text": "Abstract\n\nWith the rapid development of online Community Question Answer (CQA), a large volume of valuable data has been accumulated in CQA sites, as well as a huge number of low-quality answers. To improve the user-friendliness of CQA sites and help users find high-quality answers quickly, in this paper, we propose a supervised learning model to evaluate the quality of answers on Chinese CQA sites. We build a quality evaluation model based on the pairwise learning-to-rank algorithm and combine a set of features to rank answers according to their quality. In the quality evaluation process, we also propose an innovative type of feature named \"the sentiment polarity of comments\". Experimental results on real CQA data show that our method can efficiently produce a quality-ranking list of answers. Moreover, the proposed sentiment polarity feature can improve the performance of the quality evaluation model significantly.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nM. AllahbakhshB, Benatallah, A. Ignjatovic, H.R.
