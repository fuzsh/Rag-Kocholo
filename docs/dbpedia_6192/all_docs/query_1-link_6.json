        "text": "MCNs or Multi-channel networks are quite common in China. They are also essential when trying to contact KOLs for your brand. Most KOLs are affiliated with one of these MCNs so you need to understand how MCNs work.\n\nThere are hundreds upon thousands of MCNs in China, both large and small, so keep in mind that the following list is not exhaustive and only includes some of the more popular ones with whom businesses can work with.\n\nWhat and How Do MCNs (Multi-Channel Networks) Work?\n\nChina’s MCNs are thriving. There are thousands of them in China and the number is growing. MCNs, or multi-channel networks, work in a similar way to influencer networks. They aren’t as common in the West, but they’re thriving in China.\n\nMCNs are important for content creation because they provide KOLs and influencers with a team of affiliated influencers. They also provide training and even logistical support. All in all, they help consolidate KOL resources across a variety of Chinese social media channels.\n\nIf a brand wants to work with a KOL, it’s hard to find a KOL without the help of an MCN.\n\nTypes of MCNs\n\nThere are three types of MCN agencies in China: e-commerce, content, and marketing.\n\nE-Commerce\n\nE-commerce MCNs support livestreamers with e-commerce skills or their own burgeoning product brands. The livestreamer is generally responsible for product design and content output while the MCN e-commerce department is responsible for logistical, supply-chain and shop operation management.\n\nThey work with brands looking for endorsements and sell via social e-commerce and livestreaming. Their slick content production and organized management mean they get a lot of traffic that often converts into e-commerce sales.\n\nContent\n\nContent MCNs attract KOLs who are into content production. They usually produce high-quality short videos for brands.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing MCNs provide advertisers with integrated marketing solutions and do multi-channel distribution to reach potential consumers. They also do market analysis in order to recommend the best KOL matrix/combination for clients.\n\nMCN List\n\nE-Commerce Types:\n\nQianxun (谦寻)\n\nWebsite: http://www.qxwhmcn.com/\n\nKey contact:https://www.linkmcn.cn/#/home\n\nEmail: qianxun@qianxungroup.com\n\nBased in: Hangzhou\n\nFounded in: 2017\n\nCompany size: 1,000-9,999 people\n\nIntro: Currently, it is one of the largest e-commerce companies in China and is also the Top 1 Agency in Taobao Live.\n\nServices: Livestreaming services, super supply chain, SaaS platform, territory-wide marketing, IP commercialization, new brand incubation\n\nPlatforms: Taobao, Douyin\n\nIndustries served: Beauty, Lifestyle, Food, Clothing\n\nKey competitive advantages: It has established long-term partnerships with more than 20,000 domestic and international brands, stocked hundreds of thousands of high-quality goods and built a matrix of professional livestreamer in multiple fields.\n\nCurrent clients include Ubras, Nars, Kiehl’s, etc.\n\nMei one (美one)\n\nWebsite: https://www.meione.com/\n\nEmail: hezuo@meione.cc\n\nBased in: Shanghai\n\nFounded in: 2014\n\nCompany size: 500-999 people\n\nIntro: MeiONE is an incubation platform for artists and web celebrities, providing them with the tools to build a network of contacts among multi-role users.\n\nServices: Filming, promotion, anchoring and e-commerce distribution\n\nPlatforms: Taobao, WeChat\n\nIndustries served: Beauty, Lifestyle, Food, Fashion and Electronic goods.\n\nKey competitive advantages: Meione’s top LivestremerLi Jiaqi has contributed a superb amount of traffic, with more than 1,600 brands working with Li Jiaqi and the highest number of viewers in a single livestream reaching 250 million.\n\nCurrent clients include L’ORÉAL, Shiseido, LVMH, P&G, Guerlain, Perfect Dairy, Anta, Joyoung, etc.\n\nYowant Network\n\nWebsite:https://www.ywwl.com/live.html\n\nKey contact: 0571-88515356\n\nEmail: Dongmiban@yywl.com\n\nBased in: Hangzhou\n\nFounded in: 2010\n\nCompany size: 1,000-9,999 people\n\nIntro: Hangzhou Yowant Network Technology Co., Ltd. is a comprehensive technology company with livestreaming as its core, which laid out the live e-commerce field in 2018 and completed capitalization in the same year by listing on A-share\n\nServices: Internet advertising distribution, mobile game promotion\n\nPlatforms: Taobao, Douyin, Kuaishou\n\nIndustries served: Internet, Mobile game\n\nKey competitive advantages: Yowant has more than 100 livestreamers under its banner; at the same time, Yowant Network is also one of the earlier organizations to train celebrity artists, with more than 30 collaborating artists such as Wang Zulan, Cecilia Cheung, etc. The combined fan base exceeds 500 million+, and the monthly exposure is 4 billion+.\n\nCurrent clients include: Unilever, Armani, Kiehl’s, Sulwhasoo, Dove, Kans, 3M, P&G, etc\n\nWuyou Media\n\nWebsite:https://www.wuyoumedia.com/about\n\nKey contact: 17076772255\n\nWeChat: joymedia_013\n\nBased in: Hangzhou\n\nFounded in: 2016\n\nCompany size: 1,000-9,999 people\n\nIntro: The company has main businesses in\n\nServices: Livestreaming, short-form video, commercialization, e-commerce and shop operation, integrated marketing, music production and distribution\n\nPlatforms: Douyin, Taobao\n\nIndustries served: Beauty, Lifestyle, Travel, Fashion\n\nKey competitive advantages: The company has over 90,000 signed artists, 3,000 partner brands and over 1.8 billion fans.
