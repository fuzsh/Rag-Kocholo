        "text": "Future prospects – strong growth and development\n\nDespite the major upheavals caused by the Covid pandemic, the Chinese equestrian market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and is once again poised for a period of exciting growth and development as the sector attracts new investment across all levels making it more accessible to a much wider audience.\n\nChina’s strong economic performance over recent decades has created a large and aspirational middle class who have the disposable income and time to invest in new sports and leisure activities. The country’s professional horse sports and leisure industry is directly benefiting from this trend given the country’s longstanding equine heritage, active national and regional government support, the sector’s increasingly high-profile and sophisticated image and its undoubted physical and mental health benefits for all participants.\n\nSuch is the interest in equine sports and leisure activities, new rider training facilities are emerging in cities across China including high growth locations such as Beijing and Shanghai. By providing convenient access to millions more people, this is also driving a growth in participation levels and demand for equine products and services.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the more than 1 million riding club members (pre-pandemic) are just the tip of the iceberg and strong future growth is virtually assured.\n\nOver recent years, the impressive increase in club membership and the launch of new riding, training and breeding facilities across China, we are seeing a surge in sales for a full range of high-end products including quality horses, facility and riding equipment, clothing, accessories, training and equine nutrition and health care products and services. It is an ideal time for new international suppliers to enter the Chinese market and for existing suppliers to boost their market presence and sales.\n\nWith its substantial purchasing power and huge future potential, China should be a priority market for all suppliers and manufacturers of professional equine products and services.\n\nDid you know that"
