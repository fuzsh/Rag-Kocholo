        "text": "Manufacturing of Hunan\n\ninHunan inThe economy\n\nHunan’s metallurgical industry is centred in the triangle formed by the three large cities of Changsha, Xiangtan, and Zhuzhou. Plants producing iron and steel, processed foods, and electrical equipment are located in Xiangtan, while Zhuzhou is the hub of large-scale heavy industry (notably chemical fertilizers and nonferrous metals) and commodity exports. Changsha is Hunan’s centre for light industry, which includes rice milling, food processing, aluminum smelting, and the manufacture of machine tools, bearings, and textiles. It is also famous for its handicrafts, which include xiang (border) embroideries (one of the four noted embroidery styles of China), duck-down quilts, umbrellas, and leather goods.\n\nYiyang—known as “Bamboo Town”—is typical of many of the smaller cities specializing in one particular handicraft. Nearly everything required in domestic life—from beds to scrubbing brushes—is made from bamboo. Fireworks and firecrackers produced in Liuyang are world-renowned, and porcelain wares made in Liling are known as the “cream of pottery arts of the East.”\n\nThere are several famous pottery kilns in the province that date to the Tang dynasty (618–907). Situated at Yueyang, Xiangyin, and near Changsha, these kilns have at different epochs produced all sorts of wares, according to the market of the period. Their fortunes have fluctuated through the centuries. More recently, they have increased their output, especially in the Xiangyin kilns, which produce large quantities of crockery for the general market.\n\nTransportation\n\nHunan stands at the crossroads of China’s historical lines of communication—the great waterway of the Yangtze River, which flows from Sichuan province to the sea, and the Imperial Highway, running from Guangzhou (Canton) northward to Beijing.\n\nRailway construction began in 1912, and the first line was between Wuhan and Zhuzhou; it was eventually extended south to Guangzhou and is now part of the major Beijing-Guangzhou trunk line. There is a junction at Hengyang leading to Guangxi, from where the line continues south to Vietnam. In addition, a major east-west line through southern China reaching from Zhejiang and Fujian on the east coast to central Yunnan province, traverses central Hunan and crosses the north-south trunk line at Zhuzhou. Another north-south line from Zhicheng to Liuzhou has been built through western Hunan, connecting those areas with Hubei and Guangxi.\n\nShipping is another important means of transportation, as a large portion of Hunan’s goods are moved by water. Traffic on the Xiang River is the most important. Dongting Lake has innumerable shallow waterways connecting four main rivers. Yueyang in the northeast corner of the lake is the collecting centre for the timber rafts that sail the Yangtze River to Wuhan.\n\nOne main trunk road runs from north to south, following the Beijing-Guangzhou railway into Guangdong; much of its route in Hunan is an express highway. Three other main routes run from east to west and are of growing importance because they open up areas not served by the railways. Changsha is the hub of Hunan’s international air traffic, and there are regional airports in Zhangjiajie, Changde, and other cities.\n\nGovernment and society\n\nConstitutional framework\n\nFrom 1950 to 1954 Hunan was part of the South Central China greater administrative region, which extended from Hubei in the north to Guangdong and Guangxi in the south. In 1954 provincial government throughout the country was made directly subordinate to the national government. Since then the province’s administrative structure has gone through several changes. It is now divided into 13 prefecture-level municipalities (dijishi) and one autonomous prefecture (zizhizhou). Below that level are districts under the municipality (shixiaqu), counties (xian), autonomous counties (zizhixian), and county-level municipalities (xianjishi).\n\nHealth and welfare\n\nEmphasis is laid on preventive medicine. After 1949, public health teams were sent into the country to vaccinate and inoculate and to advise on and supervise public hygiene. Debilitating diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis—an affliction of the blood and tissues that is spread by larvae in the droppings of animals in the rice fields—have been attacked, and occurrences of the maladies (notably malaria) have decreased. There has also been a marked fall in infant mortality and an increase in life expectancy since 1950.\n\nEducation\n\nBefore 1949, Western learning was largely acquired through Christian missionary or other Western-style schools, and most of the population remained illiterate. Since then a countrywide literacy drive has been pursued with vigour and enthusiasm and with a large measure of success. By the 1980s Hunan had one of the lowest illiteracy rates in the country. Changsha has retained its historic role as the province’s cultural and educational centre and is the location of Hunan University (founded 1903), Hunan Medical University (1914), National University of Defense Technology (founded 1953; moved to Changsha 1970), as well as other technical institutes, teacher-training colleges, and institutes for minorities.\n\nCultural life\n\nAlthough the aim of the national government is to promote linguistic uniformity, Hunanese—which was Chinese leader Mao Zedong’s own dialect—persists.\n\nHunan province is renowned for beautiful landscapes of lakes and mountains and for its sites of cultural and historic interest. Major scenic sites include Mount Heng near Hengyang, the southernmost of China’s five sacred mountains; the Wulingyuan scenic area near Zhangjiajie, designated a World Heritage site in 1992; and Dongting Lake itself, with its many natural areas and historic features such as Yueyang Tower (Yueyang Pavilion) at Yueyang on the north shore of the lake—one of the three famous pavilions south of the Yangtze River. Other historic sites include the Mawangdui tomb complex of the Xi (Western) Han period (206 bce–25 ce) at Changsha and Mao Zedong’s birthplace at Shaoshan (west of Xiangtan)."
