        "text": "It was one of those time periods where the children of the respective leaders of Huanyue and Xuandu were sent to stay with a martial relative for a while. Shen Qiao had wanted to prepare himself for his husband to return home from a meeting in the capital as it coincidentally aligned when their next shared rut and heat periods were going to be as they agreed on a decision of having another child prior. He made sure that Gu Hengbo’s schedule and residence was cleared for their sons to stay in for a while and because she was well trusted when it came to babysitting. The omega himself treated his children nicely and always wanted to make sure the next person watching them does the same, aside from his husband but that was a story for another day.\n\nWhile dusting a few shelves in their bedroom, Shen Qiao collapsed onto the floor and was lucky to have landed on his bed. The dust cloth fell out of his hands and he was slightly sprawled from the side. Once it was evening, the daoist felt a surge of his body heating up quickly. He quickly stood up and shook while in the process of doing so. It couldn’t be. His heat came too early and Yan Wushi wasn’t there! Shen Qiao began to panic as he began to stumble around their room, only to reach the closet for his husband’s recently worn outer robe and one of their wooden phalluses that was polished really well.\n\n“To think he gave this to me because the gift shop next door was connected to a brothel. Whatever goes on in this man’s head!”\n\nThe robe was spread out on the bed, as if Yan Wushi were to lay back and Shen Qiao were to simply climb on to ride him. This time Shen Qiao laid on it, spreading his legs to prepare himself a little bit, and to slowly slip in his toy, letting out the loudest moan of relief when it started to move. Even the daoist had to admit the sound he made was quite embarrassing. But who cares, for he has gotten the chance to somewhat relieve his aching heat symptoms from worsening and the smell of his husband was surprisingly helping. He had another day until his husband was home anyway.\n\n“Perhaps I can busy myself before he gets back.”\n\n~\n\nThe night Yan Wushi got home, he had simply fed their pet deer as a way to greet him after being gone a few days. He knew his children were sent out of their residence for a short period of time but was unable to find his husband until he heard loud squelching sounds from their room. The demonic sect leader was soon hit with a wave of his mate’s smell and it began to trigger his rut quickly but he knew he had to be quiet in the meantime. He gently slid the door open a bit to see Shen Qiao laying on his side, crying into a pillow as one of his legs was in the air and the toy phallus was being shoved inside of him at a rhythmic pace. A part of the dark cloak accentuated that lovely waist as he would feel like his arms were being wrapped around.\n\n“Yan-lang…Yan-lang! Please…”\n\nThe daoist was now crying out his name as if he were here. Yan Wushi couldn’t help but smile, swiftly making his way in on the other side of the door, in which Shen Qiao didn’t notice until he came on the cloth under him.\n\n“Did you really miss me that much? My Shen-lang, I’m here.”\n\nShen Qiao’s face began to turn beet red as tears began to roll down his eyes even more. Yan Wushi chuckled as he got closer, his length behind his pants wanting to jump out. A hand ran through the daoist’s hair, letting Yan Wushi circle his husband’s mouth around his hard length. It had been long enough for the two of them already and they both wanted one another. It was just the fact that Yan Wushi was simply extra with most things to rile Shen Qiao up.\n\n“Tsk tsk tsk, to think that you had a toy in place of this venerable one. Is this husband also a toy to you as well, A-Qiao? Do you want to toss me away when you’re done with me as well?”\n\nShen Qiao shook his head and tears began to form in his eyes. Yan Wushi couldn’t help but take pity, freeing his cock easily from his robes and allowing it to lightly slap that pretty face below. Perhaps it was time for Yan Wushi to give in just from that look alone. He began to make a move between Shen Qiao’s legs, lining his length on the rim and slowly pushing in the head, stopping right after to pull out a bit. His ankles rested on the shoulders to open up to him much more.\n\n“Foolish A-Qiao, you didn’t even bother to prepare yourself first?”\n\n“Why would I need to…I already did!”\n\n“Ah, so you were actually prepared?”\n\nShen Qiao gulped as he looked away in shame. He covered his eyes and Yan Wushi himself couldn’t help but laugh more than he should. He loved it when he acted like this. Both of them could agree that the statement wasn’t false after all. The demonic husband began to take the hands covering his husband’s face, with their fingers intertwining and soon entering back inside that wet heat again. Shen Qiao cried out loud as he felt his husband shove his entire length in one go, arching himself to grind down deeper. A slight bulge poked out of his stomach for every thrust made.\n\n“Oh? Does my A-Qiao miss this sight?”\n\nThe daoist looked up towards his husband, beads of tears running down his face as Yan Wushi began to move his hips quicker, relishing every moment and occasionally leaning down to sniff his husband’s neck. He smelt like freshly made tangren with a hint of extra cane sugar, licking over the bite mark that’s been made plenty of times with their lovemaking. Yan Wushi enjoyed the smell of this delicacy, he would even consider it a midnight snack whenever he rested near Shen Qiao. If he were lucky, he would get the chance to actually get a bite of it. This was one of those instances.\n\n“My dear A-Qiao, can you repeat the things you said when I walked through the door earlier?”\n\n“What sort of vile things? Yan-zongzhu, this is enough for me!”\n\nA hard thrust resulted as one of Yan Wushi’s hands moved over to pinch Shen Qiao’s nipple. The daoist squealed and cried even louder from it. He grew to become extremely sensitive up there from breastfeeding through those years.\n\n“Is that the right way to address your husband? Am I a mere plaything to you? Are you more comfortable calling me that when in private with your toys?”\n\n“No! I didn’t mean it like that. Please Yan-lang, please give me more!”\n\n“That’s a good wife, hang onto something while you can, hm?”\n\nYan Wushi quickly flipped Shen Qiao, moving the hands that were still held together to the wall, putting more of his body over his husband. Shen Qiao moaned loudly at their sudden change now that he could tell that the alpha was getting close. He was soon silenced with a wet kiss, drool getting everywhere on their lips, to their necks, and over their chest areas. The position allowed Yan Wushi’s other hand to run over the bulge being created with every thrust, a feeling that never got old for the two of them. His knot began to swell and catch on the edge of Shen Qiao’s rim, with every smack echoing their room along with their combined weight making their bed creak for every move made.\n\n“I’m going to, hah, Yan-lang, please allow me to-”\n\n“You mustn’t say anymore, let it out for me, A-Qiao. I’m close as well.”\n\nShen Qiao bucked his hips back towards Yan Wushi, clenching around him as he came onto their shared bed, resulting in Yan Wushi slapping Xuandu’s peach as a small punishment. The alpha was getting closer and began to nudge his knot in, with small fast thrusts resulting and his mouth sucking over his omega’s nape. He soon bit down once his climax hit and groaned loudly behind Shen Qiao, long spurts of cum resulted and filled the omega’s insides, making sure it says potent enough for their needs. The daoist’s arms slipped from the wall and gripped their pillows, yelping at the bite from behind him. Yan Wushi chuckled as he licked the nape, with both hands now around Shen Qiao’s waist feeling every burst of cum shoot inside. He could even feel a bigger bulge forming from it.\n\n“Did this venerable one provide you well? To say that your heat was rather early and you actively found a way to pleasure yourself without me, hm.”\n\n“Don’t say anything else anymore! It’s embarrassing!”\n\n“Hahaha, alright I shall refrain.”\n\nOnce Yan Wushi finished his load, he pulled out and sat back on his ankles, admiring the amount of cum gushing out of Shen Qiao’s hole and watching his stomach go back down to his original size. It was unfortunate they soiled their bed from it but Yan Wushi was nice enough to call for a servant to clean up after them, especially because it reeked of his omega’s slick and cum stains from the previous days the alpha was unavailable.\n\nHe began to prepare a warm bath for the two of them as it relieved any achy muscles, especially Shen Qiao’s. The couple placed themselves in and the omega laid against that muscled chest behind him. It felt relaxing and he was happy to be by him. Yan Wushi’s arms wrapped around the thin waist and his fingers tapped on the stomach gently.\n\n“Have we figured out names for her yet?”\n\n“How would you know if it’s a girl?”\n\n“A-Qiao we’ve already had five sons, we’re bound to at least have a daughter at some point.”\n\n“Maybe after this period subsides we can figure it out, I’m a little exhausted after these past few days.”\n\n“But-”\n\nShen Qiao shushed him as he began to nap a little bit, who knew when their next session was going to be and who was going to initiate it. He wanted to take the time to relax for the time being and knew his husband was joining once he heard a slight snore above him."
