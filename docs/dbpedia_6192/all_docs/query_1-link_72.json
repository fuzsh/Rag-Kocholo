It integrates virtual and real spaces at a high level, while simultaneously addressing development and social issues. Dr. Gao emphasized that achieving Society 5.0 requires the participation of the entire society and all citizens. It involves introducing advanced technologies such as robots and AI into all industries and social life. By implementing measures such as smart agriculture, food sales, and energy management systems, products and services are provided indiscriminately based on various needs, achieving interconnection in multiple domains.\n\nProfessor Zhou Jian, School of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University\n\nFrench literature and arts knight medalist, Professor Zhou Jian from the School of Architecture and Urban Planning at Tongji University, and national master of engineering survey and design, presented \"Interpreting the '15-Minute Community Life Circle'\".
