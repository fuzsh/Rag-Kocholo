        "text": "Blueberry Dream Pie with Streusel Topping\n\nThe blueberry crop is a banner one this year!\n\nLarger and sweeter than ever… but what to do, what to do with them all??? The possibilities are endless, blueberry pancakes, blueberry scones, blueberry smoothies, blueberry syrup, blueberry jam, blueberries on your cereal or yogurt… So. Many. Options.\n\nI’ve been seeing variations of a blueberry cream pie all over the internet, and I was intrigued. Thankfully someone volunteered to try one out, and it was a DREAM pie! I also think this would work well with other summer fruits, like blackberries… Never know unless we try it!\n\nThis fruit pie is refrigerated, making it a cool, welcome, summertime treat. The “cream” gives it a slight cheesecake quality, and the streusel topping takes it, well, over the top, in taste and texture.\n\nShare it at your next summer gathering and it will probably be requested for years to come!\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 single unbaked pie crust\n\n3 cups fresh blueberries.\n\n3/4 cup of heavy cream\n\n1/2 cup sour cream\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n⅔ cup sugar\n\n4 tablespoons flour\n\n¼ tsp salt\n\njuice of 1 lemon (2-3 Tablespoons)\n\n2 tablespoons butter, melted\n\n1/2 cup of flour\n\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n\nInstructions:\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees.\n\nPrepare bottom pie crust - pop in freezer while preparing filling.\n\nWhisk together sour cream, sugar, salt, heavy cream, vanilla, lemon zest, juice & 4 tablespoons of flour.\n\nPlace 3 cups of blueberries in unbaked pie crust, and pour sour cream mixture on top. Gently combine.\n\nBake for 25 minutes.\n\nMake the streusel topping: Mixing flour, brown sugar & melted butter together with a fork until crumbs form.\n\nRemove pie from over after first 25 minutes of baking and sprinkle streusel topping evenly over the top.\n\nReturn pie to oven and bake 20-25 minutes longer, or until golden and the filling is bubbling.\n\nLet pie cool completely then chill overnight in refrigerator.\n\nServe cold.\n\nWhat In The World?! | August Book Club\n\nI adore Leanne Morgan! She’s smart, she’s beautiful, she’s humble, and she’s sooooo funny! Relatable is the word most people use to describe her. Actually no. “Funny” is the first word, followed closely by “relatable,” but you know what I mean.\n\nShe took the time to share some laughs and stories when she joined me on my podcast, LOVE SOMEONE and while I was a fan before, that cinched our relationship. I’m one of her loudest, proudest cheerleaders now, watching her star ascend, applauding every new endeavor.\n\nFrom raising babies and doing some stand-up on the side, to social media fame, to her smash Netflix special, Leanne Morgan is now a household name and marquee’s all over the country are lighting up with it as she smashes sold-out show after sold-out show. She’s wrapped up a movie with Reese Witherspoon and Will Farrel, and a new sit-com is in the works. What more is there to do? Well, write a book, I suppose… and she did just that!\n\n“What In The World?!”, by Leanne Morgan, “A Southern Woman’s Guide To Laughing At Life’s Unexpected Curveballs And Beautiful Blessings” is available to preorder now.\n\n“For a long time, no one pulling the strings in the comedy world thought that a woman over fifty from rural Tennessee could make it in the industry. But Leanne Morgan has defied the odds, reaching millions with her musings on hormones, low-rise britches, Weight Watchers, and her opposites-attract relationship with her husband, Chuck.\n\nIn her charming southern accent, Morgan brings readers inside her quest to find her voice after spending many years trying to figure out what that meant. Along the way, we learn how she grew up as a butcher’s daughter, landed a husband with health insurance, honed her stand-up technique selling jewelry at house parties, embraced the glories of aging, and surrendered to the comfort of wearing big flesh-toned panties.\n\nEqual parts warm and hilarious, this book is a must-read by one of comedy’s rising stars—reminding you that every time life leaves you asking “What in the world?!,” something good is bound to come out of it someday.”\n\nPre-Order “What In The World?!”\n\nStar Spangled Fruit Skewers\n\nHeaded to a 4th of July BBQ tomorrow and don't know what to contribute?

My book club pick for July will take you there!\n\n“A Kingdom To Claim”, by Sian Ann Bessey, will immerse you in ancient culture, clashes, and a kingdom on the brink.\n\nWessex, AD 878\n\n“Aisley’s young life was changed forever when her father accompanied King Alfred into battle and lost his life in a deadly skirmish with the Vikings. Now, almost seven years later, the Vikings are once again rallying on Wessex’s borders, and Aisley fears that her older brother may have treacherous plans to betray the king by aligning himself with the invading Norsemen. But when Aisley encounters a handsome nobleman in the market, she feels the first stirrings of hope. Though they met only once when Aisley was a little more than a child, she recognizes him immediately as one of King Alfred’s most trusted men.”\n\nI enjoy my life so much, especially the chaotic parts, but I still need an escape every once in a while. Books, more than anything else, provide it. A few pages into “A Kingdom To Claim” and I am walking in Aisley shoes, sharing her doubts and desires, experiencing her insights and feelings as she practices her healing arts, falls in love, and fights for the future of her Saxon home.\n\nWelsh born, Idaho state resident, author Sian Ann Bessey, transports us to a time and a place that is the stuff of legends, but really DID exist.\n\nThe lives of the Viking and Saxon people during the time of King Alfred’s reign, and the Viking invasions of the British Isles will fascinate you as it does me. Rich in detail and masterfully told, “A Kingdom To Claim” is historical fiction at it’s best.\n\nPick up your copy HERE.\n\nMY BAG MY STORY\n\nMy Bag My Story is a heartfelt initiative that addresses a painful truth faced by many children in foster care.\n\nAs they move from one temporary home to another, their possessions are often carried in a trash bag. This breaks my heart. But, for every bag purchased, My Bag My Story donates a high-quality, durable bag to a foster child.\n\nThese bags are more than just practical; they are symbols of support and recognition, affirming the inherent value and worth of every child in the foster care system. Through this gesture, it not only provides something functional, but it also helps foster children feel seen and valued.\n\n\"I started My Bag My Story after becoming a foster parent and watching children always having their belongings in a trash bag or grocery sack or nothing. Everyone kept saying this was normal. I said it doesn’t have to be normal, so I set out to have bags made for kids,\" said Cara Finger, Founder of My Bag My Story. \"Having a bag to call your own instead of a trash bag gives a child dignity and makes them feel valued. A bag seems so small but makes a huge difference in their foster care experience. Making a child feel like they are worth more than trash is so important to me.\"\n\nAccording to the government site, Child Welfare Information Gateway, there are more than 391,000 American children and youth living in foster care nationwide.\n\nThe Annie E. Casey Foundation reports that as of 2021, 44% of foster children are placed with non-relative foster families.\n\nNationally, on average, children will spend 22 months in foster care. As most of you know, I care deeply about the plight of these children. I know many of you do too. We can do better by these kids, who have done nothing to deserve the situation they find themselves in.\n\nOver 8,500 children are in the foster care system in Tennessee alone. In fact, a recent report by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth, shows that Tennessee holds the top spot nationwide for the frequency of foster children moving to new homes. In 2020, 33.7% of children in Tennessee's foster care system experienced placement changes three or more times within their first year in custody.\n\nMy Bag My Story, a non-profit organization working to improve the lives of children in foster care by providing them with high-quality bags, is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, that depends on the support of local and national corporations, including Dell, The Predators Foundation, St. George’s Episcopal Church and Target… and YOU.\n\nRemember: One Bag Purchased = One Bag Donated.\n\nTo learn more, visit:\n\nMY BAG MY STORY\n\nMarvelous Mint Summer Salad\n\nAt this time of year, my gardens are full of fresh, aromatic mint, and I’m never quite sure what to do with all of it! I enjoy walking next to the garden beds it’s spilling out of, brushing up against the leaves, and breathing deeply of the scent they release, but other than that, and using the tall straight spears in flower bouquets and arrangements, I’m at a bit of a loss.\n\nEnter this fantastic summer salad! The base is chickpeas (though I’m sure a white bean would work equally well) and another winning ingredient is roasted bell peppers - the variety you’ll find on store shelved in jars with olive oil - and there’s some cucumber thrown in for crunch, some onion for zip, and feta cheese that adds to the texture… but the star of the show is fresh mint!\n\nI encourage you, as I often do, to use the recipe as a bit of a guide, adding, subtracting, and substituting with whatever you have on hand or with whatever sounds good to you. I think diced tomatoes would be yummy, and I was even wishing I had some kumquats on hand to slice into it. (Oh, and how ‘bout some sunflower seeds added just before serving?)\n\nWhatever you toss in there, be generous with the mint, and make it up ahead of time, because it needs a few hours minimum in the fridge to allow the flavors to marry and the mint leaves to soften a bit.\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained\n\n2 cups canned roasted bell peppers, chopped\n\n1 cup peeled cucumber, diced (same size as chickpeas)\n\n1/2 cup diced red onion\n\n1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, washed, and diced\n\n1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese\n\nDressing:\n\n1/4 cup lime juice\n\n2 Tablespoons honey\n\n2 Tablespoons mustard\n\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\nSalt and Pepper to taste\n\nDirections:\n\nIn large bowl combine all salad ingredients, except for feta cheese, folding to mix well.\n\nIn a small bowl, mix lime juice, honey, and mustard, then add 2-3 drops of the olive oil, and when well incorporated, add remaining oil in a steady stream whilst mixing. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\nPour dressing over salad, folding again, then top generously with feta cheese.\n\nBarry Manilow 2024 Arena Tour\n\nThis spring, millions were treated to a stunning array of lights in the night sky when the Aurora Borealis made a rare appearance in cities and towns from coast to coast.\n\nThis summer, you have a chance to be dazzled yet again, but this time, you’ll need to get tickets.\n\nBarry Manilow, the most successful Adult Contemporary artist of all time, is returning to 17 arenas this summer for his final concert in those cities.\n\nThis is not the end of the road for Barry, but it is the final curtain call for the cities below:\n\nDon’t miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime experience!

Sowards has obviously done an incredible amount of research to be able to depict the era with such realism and fascinating detail.\n\n“After an arranged marriage, Konstantin and Suzana must find a way to meet the demands of a conquering Ottoman sultan amid a torrent of setbacks and dangers much closer to their Balkan home.\n\nThe Balkans, 1373\n\nA devastating battle claimed the lives of Konstantin’s father, uncle, and most of their Serb army, leaving him to rule as a vassal of the Ottoman sultan, a role he is wholly unprepared for. Between war, famine, and a persistent band of brigands, Konstantin is nearly bankrupt. He will need to find a wealthy bride to marry if he is to have any hope of saving his lands and securing his future.\n\nA betrothal to Suzana, the daughter of a prosperous merchant, is soon arranged, and upon meeting her, Konstantin immediately feels hope that their marriage could someday grow into love. Yet, from the moment of Konstantin and Suzana’s betrothal, enemies threaten their lives, outlaws prey on their lands, and the terrors of Suzana’s abusive past haunt their fragile new relationship. As this onslaught of threats closes in, the two face challenges that will test their love, their faith, and their hope to save their people and win their freedom from the heavy weight of Ottoman oppression.”\n\nAlthough it’s an arranged marriage, neccessary because Konstantin needs the wealth Suzana’s dowry will bring to him and his floundering kingdom, I loved that our two main characters fall for one another at their first meeting. I was cheering them on from the beginning!\n\nAs a reader I too felt the cold realities of the period, wartime, and the duties and expectations placed upon the young rulers. And, as each is only human, they must also overcome personal struggles, learn and grow as individuals, and find their place in a brutal world. When hope is a meager commodity, the ability to trust in one another helps them to work through past and current traumatic events, staying resolved and steadfast in their love and the execution of their overwhelming responsibilities.\n\nIt’s action-packed, with epic nail-biting battles too. History is so much more interesting when there’s a romance to guide you through it! Just the thing to take out into the garden or tuck into a beach bag.\n\n“Beneath A Crescent Shadow, The Balkan Legends” is Book 1 in a new series, and once you’ve cracked the cover, your going to want to read them all! I know I do!\n\nOrder: “Beneath A Crescent Shadow”\n\n\"Long Yellow Dress\" new from Train + Train & REO Speedwagon Summer Tour!\n\nTrain released a brand new single “Long Yellow Dress” on April 24.

I will be wishing I was in the audience as much as I’ll love being on the stage.”\n\nREO Speedwagon’s Kevin Cronin said: “Pat Monahan and I have done several benefit shows over the years, and now we get to take out our bands for a summer full of music and fun.\n\nI love the idea of bringing together people of all ages, who share a common love for well-crafted songs and high energy live performances.

Unfortunately, he has obligations elsewhere, leaving her stuck in London.\n\nGraham Everett’s financial security depends on an investment with Mr. Lane, his long-time fried and business partner. He’ll do just about anything to secure it for his family, even if it means fighting spiled, embittered Anna for her father’s attention.\n\nLucking, Mr. Lane concocts a plan that will give everyone what they want, with one stipulation; Anna must accompany Graham to Brighton in her father’s stead and make a decision to invest—or not—based on a thorough report.\n\nBut it will take more than a day at the beach for these two headstrong hearts to admit that they’ve been wrong about each other. If they are willing to invest a little time working out their differences, they might have a chance at real love.”\n\nMom’s would love to receive this on their Mother’s Day breakfast tray along with lovingly prepared french toast, orange juice, hot tea and fresh flowers.\n\nWhen the last bite’s been eaten, tidy up the tray and leave her to her book and tea for a while, she deserves it.\n\nSweepstakes | Mother's Day Delights\n\nMom’s are heroes!

So of course I was excited to hear of the movie, Unsung Hero, (the title comes from a for KING + COUNTRY song of the same name), in theaters April 26th.\n\nBased on a remarkable true story, Unsung Hero follows the father, David Smallbone, as he moves his family from Down Under to the States, searching for a brighter future after his successful music company collapses.\n\nWith nothing more than their seven children, suitcases, and their love of music, David (portrayed by his son, for KING + COUNTRY’s Joel Smallbone) and his pregnant wife Helen (Daisy Betts) set out to rebuild their lives.\n\nHelen’s faith stands against all odds and inspires her husband and children to hold onto theirs. With their own dreams on hold, David and Helen begin to realize the musical prowess in their children, who would go on to become two of the most successful acts in Inspirational Music history: five-time GRAMMY Award®-winning artists for KING + COUNTRY and Rebecca St. James.\n\nOne of the perks of my position is often getting to see sneak-peaks at as-of-yet unreleased movies, and this one did not disappoint! The Smallbone family is one-of-a-kind! Their faith, fortitude, and fierce love for one another is evident. Their talent undeniable. It’s a moving, inspirational film that you’ll want to take the whole family to when it hits theaters later this month!\n\nThe accompanying Unsung Hero: Inspired By soundtrack is also phenomenal!

The crafter that shared this with me says she had everything (including the shims) in her craft or home supplies but encourages everyone to put their own spin on things. Pastel, polka dot, or striped carrots? Yes! Make them your own!\n\nSteps:\n\nBegin by gluing four (4) shims together to make a “carrot” shape - wide portion of the shim at one end, narrow portion at the other. If you’re using a liquid glue, bind your carrot together with rubber bands or other binding until it dries. Repeat using all 12 shims to make 3 carrots.\n\nPaint your carrots. Follow your own style sense here. Make ‘em traditional, modern, or whimsical. You’re in charge.\n\nAdd some carrot “tops”. One Dollar Tree sprig of greenery was sufficient for the 3 carrots pictured. Maybe you’d like to use dried grasses or other foliage? Again, you’re the boss.\n\nAttached the tops either with hot glue, a short nail, or a long tack - however you can get them to stay in place.\n\nTie some twine or ribbon at the top if you’d like. (If you don’t want to, you don’t have to!)\n\nDisplay and wait for Easter morning to see if Peter Cottontail took the bait!\n\nI hope you enjoy this craft. Send me photos of your finished product to D@Delilah.com, I’d love to see what you’ve come up with!\n\nHappy Easter, Happy Spring, Happy, Happy Everything!\n\nIced Lemon Loaf\n\nReprinted from 2022\n\nI don’t find myself in a Starbucks drive-thru very often, but when I do, their lemon loaf is a temptation that’s difficult - correction - impossible to pass up! I love the dense moist crumb cake and the sweet bright icing!\n\nMy sister and nephew recently tried to recreate this lemony goodness in their kitchen, because apparently he loves this treat even more than I do. Their attempt turned out temptingly tasty and quite beautiful too!\n\nPaired with a cup of Bigelow tea (might I suggest the Lemon & Echinacea?) you can’t find a more perfect spring-time mid-day pick-me-up (say that three times real fast!), or a more welcome offering at an Easter brunch table!\n\nHere’s everything you need to make 2 full loaves, one for yourself and one to share!\n\nIngredients:\n\nLoaf:\n\n3 cups all purpose flour\n\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1 cup unsalted butter – softened\n\n2 cups granulated ugar\n\n6 large eggs\n\nZest of 2 large lemons\n\n4 Tablespoons of lemon juice (plus 2 more for icing)\n\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\n2/3 cup sour cream\n\nIcing:\n\n2 cups powdered sugar\n\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n\n2 tablespoons milk or water\n\nDirections:\n\nTo make the loaves\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees\n\nGrease and flour two standard bread loaf pans\n\nWhisk the dry ingredients together in a medium-sized bowl: flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt\n\nNow, in a large bowl, beat the softened butter and the sugar together until very well combined\n\nAdd one egg at a time to the sugar and butter mix, then the vanilla, lemon zest and lemon juice\n\nAdd the dry mixture to the wet mixture a little at a time, alternating with the sour cream while mixing on low speed.\n\nOnce fully combined, pour half the mixture into one loaf pan, and repeat with the rest of the mixture into the second loaf pan. The batter will be somewhat thicker than a cake mix\n\nBake for 45 - 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted near center comes out clean\n\nCool on wire racks.\n\nFor icing:\n\nCombine powdered sugar, lemon juice, and milk (or water) mixing well, to make icing.\n\nIce loaves once cooled.\n\nSlice, serve, and enjoy!\n\n*Note - These lovely lemony loaves seem best enjoyed fresh. Left overs, though stored in a sealed baggie, became quite dry after just a few days.\n\n** 2nd Note - My nephew solved the stale loaf issue by cutting the remaining slices into cubes, placing in a bowl, and covering with half-n-half, a la, old fashioned strawberry shortcake! He says he’ll always save a few slices to do this with from now on!\n\nNew Movie | Someone Like Yo\n\nOh happy day!

And whether or not those you might find yourself reading it to, (or gifting it to,) are basketball fans, they’ll love this story of “Wat” Misaka who often felt like he didn’t fully belong to the American culture he was born into, or the Japanese culture his parents had come from, and yet, “Wat Kept Playing”.\n\nAs he got older, Wat discovered he had both a love, and an amazing talent, for the game of basketball—his troubles would often disappear, or at least recede, when he had a ball in his hands.\n\nThrough a World War, when people who looked like Wat were feared in America, through college ball, when he was the shortest person on the team, and through racist heckling from referees and others, his skills expanded, the cheers kept coming, and he found his place on the court and in the world.\n\nWat’s undeniable talent changed history as he became the first person of color to play in the NBA when he was selected by the New York Knicks in the 1947 BAA Draft.\n\nMarch Madness is upon us, and “Wat Kept Playing”, is a wonderful way to introduce young people to the game of basketball, while also delivering the important message that though finding our place in the world may not always be easy, the three-point set-up of Dream, Drill, and Determination, will get you well on your way!\n\nCheer Wat along by ordering copies of “Wat Kept Playing”.\n\nCraft Project | Rustic Heart Wall Hanging\n\nThis heart happy little project was done by a family member, and it’s so pretty I had to share!\n\nShe said she can’t take credit for the idea, she saw it done and decided to give it a try herself.\n\nInspiration tutorial by Shades of Blue Interiors. Link can be found here: Branch Heart Wall Art.\n\nThere are a few differences in the the inspiration and her rendition; the original crafter uses fallen sticks, this one is done with driftwood collected from the beach—white string was used on the original and this uses a rustic twine—and of course the color palette is different (pink versus teal).\n\nI’m told that creating the heart shape was in no way easy!\n\n1. First lay it all out. Plan to spent considerable time switching different length sticks in and out until it takes on the desired shape.\n\n2. Then, do it all over again when you tie the twine to each one and suspended it from the long rail.\n\nPro-tips:\n\nHang the rail first and ties each stick to it while hanging. (Trying to do it on a flat surface is impossible!)\n\nStart with the center stick and build out each side.\n\n3. Once you’ve got everything strung up in a heart shape, you may just decide to leave it natural… but if not, then it’s time to paint.\n\nChoose your color palette, here it starts with white, then a light teal, and finally a dark teal. You may decide to use more or less to create an ombre effect.\n\nLaying a ruler across the heart shape helped to know where to start the paint, each new layer was started about an inch down from the previous color.\n\n4. Once painted, hang once again, readjust as necessary, tighten the string/twine, and clip off any excess.\n\n5. Hang where you will enjoy!\n\nI love both, the original and our example here! And I’m sure there are countless other ways to craft something similar using this post as your inspirational jump-off point!\n\nWhat materials would you use and what color scheme?\n\nWhere would you hang this? I think a beachy cabin, a bedroom reading nook, or a bathroom would all be perfect.\n\nLet me know if you give something similar a try!"
