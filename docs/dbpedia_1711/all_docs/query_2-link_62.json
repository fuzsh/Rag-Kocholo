        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nTaylor Swift said her new album \"Midnights\" is about \"13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.\"\n\nLate-night musings and nocturnal rendezvous are common themes in Swift's music.\n\nHere's every relevant lyric we found from her previous nine albums, listed in chronological order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Take me back to the creek beds we turned up / 2 a.m. riding in your truck / And all I need is you next to me.\"\n\nSong: \"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)\"\n\nAlbum: \"Taylor Swift\" (2006)\n\nLore: This fan-favorite track on Swift's debut album was apparently inspired by her former neighbors.\n\n\"I wrote this song about a couple who lived next door to us. They'd been married forever and they came over one night for dinner and were just so cute,\" she wrote on her website, according to fan archives.\n\n\"They were talking about how they fell in love and got married, and how they met when they were just little kids. I thought it was so sweet because you can go to the grocery store and read the tabloids, and see who's breaking up and cheating on each other, or just listen to some of my songs,\" she continued. \"But it was really comforting to know that all I had to do was go home and look next door to see a perfect example of forever.\"\n\nMore recently, fans have noticed a connection between \"Mary's Song\" and \"Seven,\" the seventh track on \"Folklore.\"\n\nThe former opens with the line, \"She said, I was 7 and you were 9 / I looked at you like the stars that shined.\" The latter tells the story of a childhood friendship — or perhaps a youthful crush, considering the direct reference to hiding in a closet — that Swift still thinks about and cherishes.\n\nBoth songs feature illustrations of nature, themes of growing up, and references to father figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Oh, I remember you driving to my house / In the middle of the night / I'm the one who makes you laugh / When you know you're 'bout to cry.\"\n\nSong: \"You Belong With Me\"\n\nAlbum: \"Fearless\" (2008)\n\nLore: Swift was inspired to write a tale of \"girl-next-door-itis\" after overhearing a male friend talking to his girlfriend on the phone, \"completely on the defensive.\"\n\n\"I felt so bad for him at that moment. So I came up with the first line, 'You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset, going off about something that you said,' and I ran that into the storyline that I'm in love with him and he should be with me instead of her,\" she revealed in a since-deleted post on Big Machine's website.\n\nSwift's cowriter Liz Rose said the pair finished the song in \"one or two hours.\"\n\n\"'You Belong With Me' was written at the very end of the recording sessions for 'Fearless,'\" Rose told Rolling Stone. \"It's amazing to go back to the work tape and listen to it, because you wouldn't believe the nuances that show up in the album version, too. When she's writing something, she's already producing in her head. She hears it all.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's 2 a.m., feeling like I just lost a friend / Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.\"\n\nSong: \"Breathe\"\n\nAlbum: \"Fearless\" (2008)\n\nLore: Colbie Caillat, who cowrote and is featured on \"Breathe,\" confirmed to Insider that it was inspired by a fallout between Swift and one of her bandmates.\n\n\"I had so much respect for her,\" Caillat said. \"I think the song that we did, it was a really special thing. She was writing about something she was going through with a band member at the time, and she was pouring her heart out about it.\"\n\nFans had long suspected the track's subject is Emily Poe, Swift's former friend and fiddle player, who left her band in 2007 to attend law school. Some sources have suggested Poe was fired without cause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain / And it's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name.\"\n\nSong: \"The Way I Loved You\"\n\nAlbum: \"Fearless\" (2008)\n\nLore: \"I got this idea for a song about being in a relationship with a nice guy who is punctual and opens up the door for you and brings you flowers, but you feel nothing,\" Swift told That's Country. \"The whole time you're with him, you're thinking about the guy who was complicated and messy and frustrating.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream / It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.\"\n\nSong: \"Untouchable\"\n\nAlbum: \"Fearless Platinum Edition\" (2009)\n\nLore: \"Untouchable\" is a rendition of Luna Halo's 1999 song of the same name.\n\nAccording to the band's frontman Nathan Barlowe, Swift was asked to perform a cover during her acoustic show for Clear Channel in 2008.\n\n\"She could have chosen any cover in the world, but that's what she chose,\" Barlowe told The Tennessean. \"We lucked out, really. She covered the song and it sounded amazing, so from there, there were so many YouTube hits on it, and so many people watching it and doing imitations of it, that's when the label decided that they should put it on the record.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m. / As everything was slipping right out of our hands.\"\n\nSong: \"Mine\"\n\nAlbum: \"Speak Now\" (2010)\n\nLore: \"Mine\" is a largely fictional tale that Swift described as \"a confession of some sort.\"\n\n\"This is a situation where a guy that I just barely knew put his arm around me by the water, and I saw the entire relationship flash before my eyes, almost like a weird science-fiction movie,\" she told Yahoo! Music, per MTV News.\n\n\"After I wrote the song, things sort of fell apart, as things so often do. And I hadn't talked to him in a couple months,\" she continued. \"And the song came out, and that day, I got an e-mail from him. And I was like, 'Yes!' Because that one was sort of half-confession and half-prediction or projection of what I saw.\"\n\nThe guy in question is rumored to be the late \"Glee\" actor Cory Monteith, who was spotted out and about with Swift in early 2010. Monteith, however, said they were only ever friends.\n\nThe secret message in the album booklet is \"Toby,\" which is likely a reference to the actor who costarred in the \"Mine\" music video, Toby Hemingway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The lingering question kept me up / 2 a.m., who do you love? / I wonder 'til I'm wide awake.\"\n\nSong: \"Enchanted\"\n\nAlbum: \"Speak Now\" (2010)\n\nLore: Swift wrote \"Enchanted\" about the night she was introduced to Adam Young, otherwise known as Owl City. The two had exchanged a few emails before they met in New York City.\n\n\"I started writing that in the hotel room when I got back, because it was just this positive, wistful feeling of, 'I hope you understand just how much I loved meeting you,'\" she told Yahoo! Music. \"It was this overwhelming feeling of, 'I really hope that you're not in love with somebody.'\"\n\nSwift also said she slipped in the word \"wonderstruck\" because Young had used the word in their correspondence: \"I purposely wrote it in the song, so he would know.\"\n\nYoung confirmed speculation by releasing his own version of the song. Moreover, the secret message in the \"Speak Now\" album booklet is \"Adam.\"\n\n\"I bought her record at midnight when it came out and I was playing through it top to bottom,\" Young later told Us Weekly. \"I love the classic adding up the letters in her lyrics. I got to that song and it added up to my name and I had to take a step back and decipher the code.\"\n\nHe added: \"When I met her she was glowing and I was too. It's hard to put into words, but I was definitely wonderstruck to meet her.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I still remember the look on your face / Lit through the darkness at 1:58.\"\n\nSong: \"Last Kiss\"\n\nAlbum: \"Speak Now\" (2010)\n\nLore: \"Last Kiss\" is widely presumed to be about Joe Jonas. The teenagers dated for a few months in 2008 before weathering a messy public breakup.\n\nThe secret message for \"Last Kiss\" is \"forever and always,\" a clear callback to the 11th track on \"Fearless,\" which Swift has all but confirmed was inspired by Jonas.\n\nHowever, \"Forever & Always\" strikes a scathing tone while \"Last Kiss,\" released several years after their split, explores nostalgia and yearning that lingers beyond initial shock and heartbreak.\n\nFans have speculated the 27-second intro to \"Last Kiss\" is a reference to the couple's infamous 27-second phone call, during which Jonas ended their relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Two headlights shine through the sleepless night / And I will get you, get you alone.\"\n\nSong: \"Treacherous\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red\" (2012)\n\nLore: This song's secret message in the \"Red\" album booklet is \"won't stop till it's over,\" a lyric taken from The Temper Trap's 2008 indie anthem \"Sweet Disposition.\"\n\nThis is potentially a clue that \"Treacherous\" was written about the same person that inspired \"All Too Well\" (i.e. Jake Gyllenhaal). The beloved fifth track boasts the line, \"Oh, your sweet disposition / And my wide-eyed gaze / We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.\"\n\nHowever, the secret message could also nod to Harry Styles, whom Swift apparently began dating in late 2012. He has a slightly incorrect version of the lyric tattooed on his arm. The Temper Trap's guitarist Joseph Greer confirmed that Swift and Styles shared a love for the band during their relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night / We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light.\"\n\nSong: \"All Too Well\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red\" (2012)\n\nLore: Swift's ultimate heartbreak anthem is almost certainly about Gyllenhaal. Several specific lyrics allude to their short-lived love affair, including nods to their age gap and coffee dates in Brooklyn.\n\nThe song's long-awaited 10-minute version, released in 2021 as the final track on \"Red (Taylor's Version),\" was paired with a short film that casts Dylan O'Brien as a Gyllenhaal lookalike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It feels like a perfect night / For breakfast at midnight / To fall in love with strangers.\"\n\nSong: \"22\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red\" (2012)\n\nLore: \"22\" was a celebration of Swift's \"favorite year\" thus far, which she described as \"carefree\" mixed with \"indecision and fear.\"\n\nIn the \"Red\" album booklet, she dedicated the song to her close friends at the time, namely stylist Ashley Avignone, \"Glee\" star Dianna Agron, jewelry designer Claire Kislinger, and singer-slash-actor Selena Gomez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I bet this time of night, you're still up / I bet you're tired from a long hard week.\"\n\nSong: \"I Almost Do\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red\" (2012)\n\nLore: This song's secret message is \"wrote this instead of calling.\"\n\nSome theorize the standard edition of \"Red\" is thematically split in half: eight songs about losing and mourning love, then eight songs about finding and appreciating love.\n\nIn this interpretation, the central restraint of \"I Almost Do\" marks an essential shift. Swift still sings from a place of longing; she describes her urge to reconnect with an ex and give their relationship another try. Ultimately, however, it's a song about leaving dysfunctional love in the past.\n\nTheoretically, this leads to her breakthrough in the next song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" when Swift ditches her doubts and embraces her new path.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You said it in a simple way / 4 a.m., the second day / How strange that I don't know you at all.\"\n\nSong: \"Come Back... Be Here\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red\" (2012)\n\nLore: Many fans believe this song was inspired by Styles, though others say it's about a brief fling with Zac Efron.\n\nAccording to Swift herself, \"Come Back... Be Here\" is about \"falling for someone and then they have to go away for work.\"\n\n\"They're traveling, you're traveling, and you're thinking about them, but you're wondering how it's gonna work when there's so much distance between you,\" she told Yahoo! Music.\n\nAt a release party for \"Red,\" Swift also described the song's subject as \"a guy that I met,\" rather than an ex-boyfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again / But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man.\"\n\nSong: \"Better Man\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" (2021)\n\nLore: Although \"Better Man\" wasn't officially released by Swift until 2021, it was written around the same time as the original \"Red\" tracklist. (You can read our complete guide to \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" here.)\n\nThe lyrics thematically compliment \"All Too Well\" and the album's title track, both presumably inspired by Gyllenhaal. All three illustrate the tragic irony of breakups, which are most painful if you can remember when the relationship was \"magic.\"\n\nIn the second pre-chorus, Swift sings, \"You're talking down to me like I'll always be around.\" This recalls the second verse of \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and Swift's memories of being made to feel \"inferior\" by her ex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've had too much to drink tonight / And I know it's sad but this is what I think about / And I wake up in the middle of the night / It's like I can feel time moving.\"\n\nSong: \"Nothing New (feat. Phoebe Bridgers)\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" (2021)\n\nLore: Like \"Better Man,\" \"Nothing New\" was written during the creation of \"Red\" but cut from the original tracklist. The rerecorded version features a verse from Phoebe Bridgers, one of Swift's favorite female artists.\n\n\"I sent her this song called 'Nothing New,' which I wrote when I was 22, and it's really, really special to me. Because it was the first time I was not a shiny new artist. I was on my fourth album,\" she explained to Seth Meyers. \"I think this happens to a lot of artists, where they have their breakthrough moment, and then the moment after that is really hard for them.\"\n\nIn a diary entry dated March 2, 2012, released with physical copies of \"Lover,\" Swift revealed that she wrote \"Nothing New\" on a late-night flight while traveling from Sydney to Perth.\n\n\"I've been thinking a lot about getting older and relevancy and how all my heroes have all ended up alone,\" Swift wrote, coining a line nearly identical to one she would eventually use in her 2019 single \"The Archer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"3 a.m. and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine / Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine.\"\n\nSong: \"I Bet You Think About Me (feat. Chris Stapleton)\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" (2021)\n\nLore: \"We wanted this song to be like a comedic, tongue in cheek, funny, not caring what anyone thinks about you sort of break up song, because there are a lot of different types of heartbreak songs on 'Red,'\" Swift said in a clip sent to country radio, referring to her cowriter Lori McKenna.\n\n\"Some of them are very sincere, some of them are very stoic and heartbreaking and sad. We wanted this to be the moment where I was like, 'I don't care about anything,'\" she continued. \"We wanted to make people laugh with it, and we wanted it to be sort of a drinking song, and I think that that's what it ended up being.\n\nSeveral lines indicate that \"I Bet You Think About Me\" was inspired by the same man as \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" presumably Gyllenhaal.\n\nOnce again, Swift addresses an ex that made her feel inferior, out of step with his \"upper-crust circles\" and \"cool indie music concerts.\" She also rehashes his need for \"space.\"\n\nIn the song's music video, Swift gifts a red scarf to her ex's new wife, drawing a clear visual connection between \"I Bet You Think About Me\" and \"All Too Well.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I call, just checking up on him / He's up, 3 a.m., pacing / He says, 'It's not just a phase I'm in.'\"\n\nSong: \"Forever Winter\"\n\nAlbum: \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" (2021)\n\nLore: \"Forever Winter,\" another track from the vault that was originally cut from \"Red,\" sees Swift staying up through the wee hours of the morning, fretting about a man who was painful to love — either romantically or platonically, it's unclear.\n\nShe calls to check in at 3 a.m. while he's spiraling, and again at 5 a.m. when he's drunk. She begs him not to leave her.\n\nSimilarly, in \"Better Man,\" she sings, \"I wish it wasn't 4 a.m., standing in the mirror / Saying to myself, 'You know you had to do it' / I know the bravest thing I ever did was run.\"\n\n\"Forever Winter\" also shares thematic similarities to \"Renegade,\" a song Swift wrote with Aaron Dessner and recorded for Dessner and Justin Vernon's band Big Red Machine. The song was released on July 2, 2021, less than one month after Swift announced \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" would be her second rerecorded album.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Midnight / You come and pick me up, no headlights.\"\n\nSong: \"Style\"\n\nAlbum: \"1989\" (2014)\n\nLore: It's widely assumed that \"Style\" is about Styles. When Rolling Stone's Josh Eells asked about the obvious titular connection, he wrote that Swift responded with a \"satisfied grin\" and said, \"We should have just called it 'I'm Not Even Sorry.'\"\n\nAlthough their breakup was reported in early 2013, it's hard to know how long they were actually involved. Many of Swift's songs that seem inspired by Styles refer to a tumultuous, on-and-off romance that was mostly conducted in secretive shadows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's 2 a.m. in your car / Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start.\"\n\nSong: \"I Wish You Would\"\n\nAlbum: \"1989\" (2014)\n\nLore: This song includes several references to the same early hour, using 2 a.m. as a nostalgic thread. In each verse, Swift tweaks the imagery to evoke recurring flashbacks and magnetic attraction.\n\n\"It's 2 a.m. in my room / Headlights pass the window pane / I think of you,\" she sings in the second verse, reversing the perspective of the opening lines.\n\nIn the third verse, these doomed lovers seem to reunite: \"2 a.m., here we are / See your face, hear my voice in the dark.\"\n\nAs with much of \"1989,\" many fans speculate that \"I Wish You Would\" was inspired by Styles, particularly due to the recurring car motif that also appears in \"Style.\" Others have cited the line \"we're a crooked love in a straight line down\" as an allusion to a clandestine queer relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Small talk, he drives / Coffee at midnight.\"\n\nSong: \"You Are In Love\"\n\nAlbum: \"1989\" (2014)\n\nLore: Swift said that \"You Are in Love\" is \"loosely based on\" Jack Antonoff and Lena Dunham, who dated for five years before splitting in 2018.\n\n\"I wrote it as a kind of commentary on what their relationship has been like,\" she told Jimmy Kimmel. \"So it's actually me looking and going, 'This happened and that happened then that happened,' and that's how you knew, 'You are in love.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In the middle of the night, in my dreams / You should see the things we do, baby.\"\n\nSong: \"...Ready for It?\"\n\nAlbum: \"Reputation\" (2017)\n\nLore: This was the second single released from \"Reputation\" following \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" It acted as a primer for the album's industrial-pop sound, as well as the recurring theme of \"Crime and Punishment\" threaded throughout the tracklist.\n\n\"It talks about robbers, and thieves, and heists, and all that. And I found that to be a really interesting metaphor, but twisted in different ways throughout the album,\" Swift told fans at a release party hosted by iHeartRadio.\n\n\"The way that's presented in '...Ready for It?' is basically finding your partner in crime, and it's like, 'Oh my god, we're the same, we're the same, oh my god! Let's rob banks together, this is great!' And we'll hear that theme carried on throughout the rest of the record, but not exactly in the same way,\" she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I want your midnights / But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day.\"\n\nSong: \"New Year's Day\"\n\nAlbum: \"Reputation\" (2017)\n\nLore: \"Reputation\" was written and recorded in late 2016 and early 2017. Swift had withdrawn from the public eye following backlash ignited by Kim Kardashian and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.\n\nAround the same time, Swift began dating her current partner Joe Alwyn.\n\nSwift has described \"Reputation\" as something of a bait-and-switch — cynical and cold on the surface but, in reality, \"an album about finding love throughout all the noise.\"\n\nIndeed, the album's closing track is a tender piano ballad that sees Swift settling into a comfortable relationship, presumably with Alwyn.\n\nHowever, in some live renditions of the song, Swift has been speculated to switch the pronouns in the song's chorus to \"I want her midnights.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost / The room is on fire, invisible smoke.\"\n\nSong: \"The Archer\"\n\nAlbum: \"Lover\" (2019)\n\nLore: \"The Archer\" captures Swift's tangled sensations of love and anxiety (\"Who could ever leave me, darling / But who could stay?\"). She compares falling in love to preparing herself for \"combat\" and expresses a deep-rooted fear of being seen and understood.\n\nThis duality is explored throughout \"Lover\" on songs like \"Cornelia Street\" and the title track, a song she wrote \"really late at night.\"\n\n\"I wanted the chorus to be these really simple, existential questions that we ask ourselves when we're in love,\" she said of \"Lover\" in an interview with the New York Times. \"'Can I go where you go?' is such a heavy thing to ask somebody. 'Can we always be this close?' has so much fear in it. But so does love.\"\n\nSimilarly, before performing \"The Archer\" in BBC Radio 1's live lounge, Swift described a \"phantom fear of tragedy\" that lingers after disappointment and heartbreak.\n\n\"If you ever find something really great, or a situation that is solid, or a situation where your trust isn't being broken, sometimes you have to deal with your demons from all those times that it didn't work,\" she said. \"You have to stop yourself from thinking the worst is always going to happen.\"\n\nShe added: \"It's a song basically about having to unlearn some bad lessons that you learned in the past.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I wanna be defined by the things that I love. Not the things I hate, not the things I'm afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.\"\n\nSong: \"Daylight\"\n\nAlbum: \"Lover\" (2019)\n\nLore: These lines come at the very end of \"Daylight,\" the final track on \"Lover,\" in the form of a muffled voice recording. Swift has described the album as \"a love letter to love, in all of its maddening, passionate, exciting, enchanting, horrific, tragic, wonderful glory.\"\n\nThis song in particular acts as a foil to \"Red,\" the titular track of Swift's 2012 album: \"I once believed love would be burning red / But it's golden / Like daylight,\" she sings in the bridge.\n\nShe also revealed during a secret session with iHeartRadio that \"Daylight\" was born from the aesthetic and thematic darkness of her previous album, \"Reputation.\"\n\n\"I did gain sort of an insight that I didn't have before, which was like, even though all this stuff has happened and you, at times, feel really down about stuff that's happened in your life or your past or whatever, letting it go is a really, really, really, important step,\" she said. \"Even if you never fully get there.\"\n\n\"Reminding yourself to let things go as they present themselves, even if you can't seem to let them go yet, is a helpful exercise,\" she continued. \"And realizing that you can find love in literally the worst times in your life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They say she was seen on occasion / Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea.\"\n\nSong: \"The Last Great American Dynasty\"\n\nAlbum: \"Folklore\" (2020)\n\nLore: This song is about the whimsical and wealthy Rebekah Harkness, who once owned Swift's mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island.\n\nSwift purchased the home in 2013. Her presence in the small beach town made quite a stir, in much the same way Harkness' did. It was the site of Swift's much-scrutinized Fourth of July party in 2016, made famous by her model squad and, of course, Tom Hiddleston's \"I Heart T.S.\" tank top.\n\nIn the song's final chorus, Swift draws a direct parallel between herself and Harkness, \"the maddest woman this town has ever seen.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And when you can't sleep at night / You hear my stolen lullabies.\"\n\nSong: \"My Tears Ricochet\"\n\nAlbum: \"Folklore\" (2020)\n\nLore: Based on Swift's own words, we can assume that \"My Tears Ricochet\" was inspired by the image of an \"embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession.\"\n\nThough the song sounds like a breakup ballad, many have speculated that it's actually about Swift's rift with her former label, Big Machine Records, where she signed when she was 15 years old. The funeral motif could mean Swift is mourning that era in her career.\n\nFans theorize that \"my stolen lullabies,\" as well as the \"jewels\" her killer wears in the second verse, refer to the song rights that Swift was forced to abandon when she left the label, compelling her to rerecord her first six albums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"My twisted knife / My sleepless night / My winless fight / This has frozen my ground.\"\n\nSong: \"Hoax\"\n\nAlbum: \"Folklore\" (2020)\n\nLore: \"Hoax\" was the last song added to \"Folklore,\" written on the same night as its opening track, \"The 1.\"\n\n\"We thought it was complete, but Taylor then went back into the folder of ideas,\" producer Aaron Dessner said. \"She wrote 'The 1,' and then she wrote 'Hoax' a couple of hours later and sent them in the middle of the night.\"\n\nThe song seems to reference a variety of Swift's older tracks, including \"Look What You Made Me Do\" (\"My smoking gun\"), \"Call It What You Want\" (\"My twisted knife\"), \"Welcome to New York,\" and \"Cornelia Street\" (\"You know I left a part of me back in New York\").\n\nAt its core, \"Hoax\" is a tragic story of a woman coming undone in love. The line \"Don't want no other shade of blue but you\" seems to point to Alwyn, who is coded as blue in many of Swift's songs, although some fans believe that \"Hoax\" tells the story of a doomed queer romance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In our history, across our great divide / There is a glorious sunrise / Dappled with the flickers of light / From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind.\"\n\nSong: \"Happiness\"\n\nAlbum: \"Evermore\" (2020)\n\nLore: \"Happiness\" was the last song added to \"Evermore,\" written just one week before its release. Swift said it's about \"the realization that maybe the only path to healing is to wish happiness on the one who took it away from you.\"\n\nAt one point, the narrator alludes to the end of a seven-year relationship. She also borrows a term from \"The Great Gatsby\" character Daisy Buchanan, who says she hopes her daughter will become a \"beautiful fool\" while reflecting on her loveless marriage.\n\nIn this context, perhaps \"the dress I wore at midnight\" refers to a wedding dress, representing a marriage the narrator must leave behind.\n\nOther fans have speculated the line is a reference to Cinderella, whose ballgown transforms back into rags when the clock strikes midnight.\n\nIt could also be a callback to Swift's own experiences, detailed in songs like \"Dress\" (\"Only bought this dress so you could take it off\"), \"Dear John\" (\"The girl in the dress cried the whole way home\"), and \"Tim McGraw\" (\"When you think happiness / I hope you think that little black dress\").\n\nListen to the complete collection of Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\" on Insider's Spotify.\n\nRead next\n\nTaylor Swift Music Celebrities\n\nAdvertisement"
