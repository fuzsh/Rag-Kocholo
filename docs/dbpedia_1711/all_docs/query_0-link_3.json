        "text": "American extreme metal band\n\nAs They Sleep is an American extreme metal band from Detroit, Michigan. They have released two albums and an EP.\n\nShortly after releasing their first album, As They Sleep signed to metal label Solid State Records.[1] They released their second album, Dynasty, on November 23, 2010. Mixed by Jason Suecof (Job for a Cowboy, August Burns Red, Whitechapel) at Audio Hammer Studios, the album has one music video. Since then, they have toured with bands such as Becoming the Archetype, Living Sacrifice, The Showdown and To Speak of Wolves.[2][3]\n\nSince the release of the album, Dynasty has received very positive feedback.[4][5][6][7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to vocalist Aaron Bridgewater, the band formed in 2003 as a three piece and the other two members joined later.[8] They released an independently released self-titled EP in 2005. The band signed to Luxor Records soon after the release.\n\nTheir debut album, Blacken the Sun, was released on October 28, 2008, under Luxor Records. Produced by the band's own guitarist, Nick Morris, owner of Cloud City Studios (The Black Dahlia Murder, Walls of Jericho). Blacken The Sun was moderately successful and defined the band's unique death metal style.[2] After Blacken the Sun, the band signed to Solid State Records. Their highly acclaimed second album, Dynasty[4][5][6] was released in 2010, before leaving Solid State, and re-signing to Luxor.\n\nBridgewater stated in a recent interview that the band's new album will be titled, The Hallowed Abstract.[8]\n\nName\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band's name is a metaphor, as Bridgewater said in an interview with CCM Magazine. Here is the full quote:\n\n\"As They Sleep is a metaphor for going above and beyond to succeed, kind of like in warfare. When the enemy sneaks into camp in the middle of the night to take you out as you sleep, [you've got to do] whatever it takes to prevail.\"[9]\n\nThe band has been wondered to be a Christian, most likely due to being signed on Solid State Records, a record label with both secular and Christian bands.[10] The band leaves it up to their listeners to determine this.[10] Bridgewater stated\n\n\"We do get the 'Are you a Christian band?' question a lot, I think mainly because we're on Solid State... I have Christian roots from my childhood and I carry it with me today and I'm sure some people that read the lyrics would say it kind of reflects in the music. As far as individual beliefs, some of us have more Christian roots than others. Faith does play a part in what we're doing, but we're still a death metal band and we want to deliver death metal the way it's supposed to be. We don't have anything satanic in our music. There's no profanity in the music, either. We could go on tour with Deicide and get along with those guys just as much as we'd go on tour with Demon Hunter and get along with those guys. There's really no reason why you shouldn't get along just because your lyrical content or beliefs might be different than somebody else's.[10]\n\nBand members\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent members[11]\n\nAaron Bridgewater – vocals (2003–present)\n\nDerek Kosiba – bass (2003–present)\n\nBarry Gomez – guitar (2003–present)\n\nNick Morris – guitar (2003–present)\n\nTony Lukitsh – drums (2009–present)\n\nFormer members[11]\n\nPaul Burkett – drums (2003-2009)\n\nSession musicians[11]\n\nSteve Longworth – piano (2008)\n\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums[11]\n\nBlacken the Sun (2008)\n\nDynasty (2010)[4][5][6]\n\nThe Hallowed Abstract (TBD)\n\nEPs[11]\n\nAs They Sleep (2005)\n\nMusic Videos\n\n\"A Thousand Deaths\" (2009)\n\n\"Oracle of the Dead\" (2011)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
