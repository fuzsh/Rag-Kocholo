        "text": "I can't believe we're finally here. I've been a ball of nerves all week knowing that this album release would crush me, but there wasn't any way I could've truly predicted what was to come. Taylor has delivered us not one, but two albums full of some of the best songwriting I've ever seen. The sound is fantastic, a lot of it familiar (like a warm hug honestly) but the words - holy fuck. When she said she was a poet, she wasn't lying. I know I act like a big tough bitch because it's more interesting than being a soft little girl who cries all day everyday, but the people who actually know me, know that I'm much more the latter in real life. Everyone also knows I go on and on about how Taylor and I have lived parallel lives in a way, her albums and new songs always speaking to me at exactly the time they come out. Waiting for this album, I had to do a little thinking about whether or not we really HAVE been matching up since....Reputation, honestly. We were in love at the same time, but then I went through a really hard breakup/life change while Taylor was...still in love. I'll go as far as to say this album is what I've needed to process emotions I haven't bothered addressing over the last 6/7 years. As always, I just needed Taylor to show me the way.\n\nThe world expected this to be a gut wrenching smear campaign of Taylor's recent long term ex, Joe Alwyn. We do get a handful of songs about him, that in fact rip my soul to shreds. That being said, I am shocked by the subject of a few (possibly, more) of these songs being Matty Healy of the 1975. Not because I didn't think there would be any songs about him, they did date right as Taylor was on the rebound from Joe, and they have had history for a long time...but the DEPTH of their relationship is really what we were all blind to. Turns out, a lot of us have been a victim of a Matty Healy in our lives - a semi toxic, overwhelming love bombs breaking at our feet and turning our worlds upside down kind of situation. THAT is what I feel from a lot of this album. The intensity, the self awareness of how volatile it is, and the acceptance that it's just too chaotic to succeed. I was also shocked to see not one, but two songs for Travis Kelce. One sultry, one light hearted, with pointed references to the time they've spent together in the last 9ish months. The intensity isn't quite there for me on these ones just yet - it's very much, \"we really click, and we're just having fun.\" Honestly, just how it should be. And of course, the Kim Kardashan diss track. Perfection. 10/10. No Notes.\n\nAs is tradition, I present to you my full and complete breakdown of all 31(!!) songs and their lyrics, heavy on my personal favorite lines.\n\nPS - all of the other news outlets/blogs/websites who already had their \"breakdowns\" out by now? You either listened to the leak, or you half assed it. This masterpiece deserved time, several listen throughs, and a lot of introspection.\n\nLet us begin.\n\nFortnight (ft Post Malone)\n\nThe only \"single\" of the album (so far) and I think they hit it out of the park. I'm a massive Post Malone fan and I always love his sound on slow/sad songs. He delivered with this one. The music video is out now, and as promised, it's just as morose as we'd hoped. Featuring guest appearances by Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles (both of the Dead Poet's Society) it might be a new favorite of mine. The fashion, the passion, the CHAOS OF IT ALL! PS, Posty without tattoos? Okayyyyyy hayyyyyyyy\n\nOkay back to the song itself. She opens up the entire album with this:\n\nI was supposed to be sent away\n\nBut they forgot to come and get me\n\nI was a functioning alcoholic\n\n'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic\n\nSo, we knew it was going to be a combination of \"I'm crazy,\" \"I kind of hate myself,\" and \"I still need everyone's attention.\" Who among us?? She continues into the chorus:\n\nAnd for a fortnight, there we were, forever running\n\n'Til you sometimes ask about the weather\n\nNow you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors\n\nYour wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her\n\nA total eye roll to anyone pretending things are \"normal\" when they aren't. Avoiding the obvious, not \"saying the quiet part out loud,\" and expressing how frustrating that is (so mad, we want to MURDER!)\n\nThese lines really hit home too as a Seasonal Depression Girlie:\n\nAll my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February\n\nI took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary\n\nAnd I love you, it's ruining my life\n\nI love you, it's ruining my life\n\nFUCK. This is a near perfect way to describe trying to be in love while actually being extremely depressed. All you want is to feel normal, and it just feels impossible, which makes things all the more difficult. These lines make a lot of the lobotomy cosplay in the video make a lot of sense. (Who else is down for group lobotomies this summer????)\n\nOverall - fantastic. Great single choice, awesome feature, LOVE it.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\nAlbum title tracks can go one of two ways - awesome, or try hard. On first listen, I wasn't a huge fan of this one. I got what they were going for, but it didn't hit right away. Second listen? I'm obsessed. What was wrong with me on the first listen? This song is clever, pointed, and paints a perfect picture. Let's see:\n\nYou left your typewriter at my apartment\n\nStraight from the tortured poets department\n\nI think some things I never say\n\nLike, \"Who uses typewriters anyway?\"\n\nRight off the bat we're making fun of the entire theme of the album. Typewriters, who needs em? IMO this is the beginning of a bitter sound, like when you start to resent someone for things that didn't bother you before, or worse - things you LOVED about them before.\n\nAnd who's gonna hold you like me?\n\nAnd who's gonna know you, if not me?\n\nI laughed in your face and said\n\n\"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith\n\nThis ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots\"\n\nAnd who's gonna hold you like me?\n\nIncredible chorus. Chelsea Hotel about to be booked up until the end of time, but the comparisons here are spot on. Dylan Thomas, a drunk, miserable poet who spent his last days inside the Chelsea Hotel, and Patti Smith, songwriter/poet who spent a lot of her life being influenced by NYC (and also the Chelsea Hotel.) Two \"tortured poets\" spending time in New York, but here, Taylor is acknowledging that it isn't the reality of the situation, but more the weird fantasy roles that they're pretending to play.\n\nYou smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate\n\nWe declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist\n\nI scratch your head, you fall asleep\n\nLike a tattooed golden retriever\n\nEveryone bugging about this line but I don't know why? I like Charlie Puth! What's wrong with him? Also, for those who are in any kind of doubt that so many of these songs are about Matty….drugs + tattoos? that's him. Joe would never.\n\nBut you awaken with dread\n\nPounding nails in your head\n\nBut I've read this one where you come undone\n\nI chose this cyclone with you\n\nLove this line. Very, \"I know exactly what I've gotten myself into, and I can't act surprised this time.\" The self awareness of this album is really screaming at us, and the blatant disregard for \"the right thing to do\" makes it all even better. Our girl was just out here making mistakes at a vulnerable time, and she isn't apologizing for it!\n\nSometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me\n\nBut you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave\n\nAnd I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen\n\nEveryone we know understands why it's meant to be\n\n'Cause we're crazy\n\nSo tell me, who else is gonna know me?\n\nAt dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger\n\nAnd put it on the one people put wedding rings on\n\nAnd that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding\n\nWOOOOOO LAWD. This bridge, devastating. Lucy (Dacus, of Boygenius) and Jack Antonoff both with their finger on the pulse of the situation at hand - messy, toxic, slightly manipulative on both sides. Playing around with pretend marriage proposals?? This is where I start to feel sad for Taylor, because imagine being someone who wants that feeling so badly, and here you have someone in front of you being so nonchalant about it. It's hard to trust it, but its hard to brush it off, too. Overall, this song is very \"neither of us can stop love bombing each other.\" Love it.\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nBefore this song came out, there were theories that this song was going to be about Taylor's cat, Benjamin. I'm happy to report - it is not! Just another song about Matty Healy fumbling the fucking bag.\n\nOh, here we go again\n\nThe voices in his head\n\nCalled the rain to end our days of wild\n\nThe sickest army doll\n\nPurchased at the mall\n\nRivulets descend my plastic smile\n\nDictionary time! Rivulets are small streams, and in this case Taylor is using it to describe the way the tears are falling down her face. MOVING!\n\nMy boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh\n\nI'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh\n\n'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night\n\nI should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh\n\nMy boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh\n\nFumble, fumble fumble. Only a matter of time until \"my boy\" squeezes his toys a little too tight, and ruins them. This whole song is painting \"him\" to be the picture of someone with a juvenile way about them. \"He makes fun of you because he likes you!\" vibes. Especially with this next lyric:\n\nI know I'm just repeating mysеlf\n\nPut me back on my shelf\n\nBut first, pull the string\n\nAnd I'll tell you that he runs\n\nBecause he loves me (He loves me)\n\nFull on, making excuses for \"his\" behavior. Being aware that he's not going to change, and you either go with the flow or you get out of the situation. Taylor didn't want to get out of it!\n\nJust say when, I'd play again\n\nHe was my best friend down at the sandlot\n\nI felt more when we played pretend\n\nThan with all the Kens\n\n'Cause he took me out of my box (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nStole my tortured heart (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nLeft all these broken parts (Oh-oh)\n\nTold me I'm better off (Oh-oh)\n\nBut I'm not (Oh-oh)\n\nI'm not, I'm not\n\nIt's actually crazy how obsessed Taylor was with Matty LOL. Like, she was full blown in love with him. He could do no wrong while simultaneously doing absolutely everything wrong. She was in the mood to get her heart broken, and this song tells us that over and over. It's a good song but definitely not top 10 for me. Sounds good, but I'm starting to get Matty fatigue at this point.\n\nDown Bad\n\nBANGER, BANGER, BANGER. This song is a message to the \"fans,\" the haters who were questioning Taylor's judgement and sanity when she dated Matty shortly after her breakup with Joe. This entire song she basically says yea, I was obsessed with him, he fucked me over, get over it! I was all for the whirlwind romance thing!\n\nNow I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym\n\nEverything comes out teenage petulance\n\nFuck it if I can't have him\n\nI might just die, it would make no difference\n\nWrestling with the idea that everybody is telling you that you're literally in the middle of a train wreck, but you don't care. You'd rather die than admit defeat (or, rather die than be rid of that excitement.)\n\nDid you take all my old clothes\n\nJust to leave me here, naked and alone\n\nIn a field in my same old town\n\nThat somehow seems so hollow now?\n\nThey'll say I'm nuts if I talk about\n\nThe existence of you\n\nTaylor/Matty is SOOOOOO Carrie and Big honestly. Everyone thinks Taylor was crazy for picking this guy, but he was clearly a smooth operator. Maybe even the smoothest of all time!\n\nI'll build you a fort on some planet\n\nWhere they can all understand it\n\nHow dare you think it's romantic\n\nLeaving me safe and stranded?\n\n'Cause fuck it, I was in love\n\nSo fuck you if I can't have us\n\nThe only way to convince yourself to move on from something like this, is to channel that energy into hate. Fuck you, if I can't have us. Incredible. I absolutely love this song - the honesty, the vulnerability, all shining through in the best ways.\n\nSo Long, London\n\nDear god. Grab the tissues. It's going to be hard not just copying every single lyric into this breakdown because truly, every single lyric is important. This song is, undoubtedly, about Joe.\n\nI saw, in my mind, fairy lights through the mist\n\nI kept calm and carried the weight of the rift\n\nPulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away\n\nMy spine split from carrying us up the hill\n\nWet through my clothes, weary bones got the chill\n\nI stopped tryin' to make him laugh, stopped tryin' to drill the safe\n\nA theme that's becoming very clear to us all about Joe, is the fact that Taylor was never quite sure he actually wanted to be with her. She never really felt that security or that safety, and carried on throughout their relationship in this desperate way, trying to keep her man's attention. Even TAYLOR SWIFT can't always keep a guy interested, which is somehow comforting while being super depressing.\n\nThinkin', how much sad did you think I had\n\nDid you think I had in me?\n\nOh, the tragedy\n\nSo long, London\n\nYou'll find someone\n\nUgh. Gut punch. How much sad did you think I had in me? How long did you expect me to go on like this? That's what I get from this chorus. Sad.\n\nI didn't opt in to be your odd man out\n\nI founded the club she's heard great things about\n\nI left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath\n\nI stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use\n\nThe spirit was gonе, we would never come to\n\nAnd I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free\n\nFUCK. \"I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free\" makes me want to pull my hair out. So fucking relatable and sad. Hearing this part of the song is what turned me into a puddle of tears. Very You're Losing Me, \"I can't find a pulse, my heart won't start anymore.\"\n\nAnd you say I abandoned the ship\n\nBut I was going down with it\n\nMy white-knuckle dyin' grip\n\nHolding tight to your quiet resentment\n\nMore proof that Joe just didn't understand her, or the situation at hand. They viewed their time together in completely different ways. The \"quiet resentment\" finally got a little too loud, and it sounds like he is implementing a little bit of revisionist history to shove off his share of the blame.\n\nYou swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?\n\nI died on the altar waitin' for the proof\n\nYou sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days\n\nAnd I'm just getting color back into my face\n\nI'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place\n\nUGHHHHHH. HE RUINED LONDON FOR HER. London is so great. I would be equally pissed if someone's sour attitude and blatant apathy made me abandon a place that I loved. Heartbreaking. All in all, the tone of this track is a perfect reflection of the energy we've come to realize is exclusive to Joe. He never cared that she was Taylor Swift, and that was always the problem.\n\nBut Daddy I Love Him\n\nHere we are again, back to Matty. Thank god its a banger. Off the top we're already thinking about The Little Mermaid, Ariel exclaiming \"but daddy I love him!\" about Prince Eric, a human man. A relationship that was absolute BLASHPHEMY! UNHEARD OF! It seems the \"people who don't understand\" in this song are Taylor's friends, family, the media…really anyone who seemingly offered an unsolicited opinion or a sidelong look at her. The sound of the song is weirdly giving Fearless vibes so it's not a top 5 for me at all, but I think a lot of people will love it. It's framed almost like she took home this foreign bad boy to Nashville and the people in the town were appalled…and she loved how it ruffled people's feathers. Let's see:\n\nI forget how the West was won\n\nI forget if this was ever fun\n\nI just learned these people only raise you\n\nTo cage you\n\nSarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best\n\nClutchin' their pearls, sighing, what a mess\n\nI just learned these people try and save you\n\n'Cause they hate you\n\nSomething I've noticed about this album as a whole is that Taylor makes a TON of religious references. I'm not sure if she's just recently gotten very existential, or what. This verse we're painting them as people who are acting as if they are on a high horse (clearly.)\n\nLOL, oh, I mean, literally:\n\nToo high a horse for a simple girl\n\nTo rise above it\n\nThey slammed the door on my whole world\n\nThe one thing I wanted\n\nJudgemental bitches, that's who!\n\nNow I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned\n\nScrеamin', \"But Daddy, I love him\n\nI'm havin' his baby\"\n\nNo, I'm not, but you should see your faces\n\nI'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences\n\nNo, I'm not coming to my senses\n\nI know he's crazy, but he's the one I want\n\nDiabolical jokes from Taylor here. This entire album, while sad, really is full of a ton of dry, sarcastic jokes. My favorite kind! Gagging people with the thought of her having a baby with someone these people deem unseemly? Hilarious.\n\nI'll tell you somethin' right now\n\nI'd rather burn my whole life down\n\nThan listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'\n\nI'll tell you somethin' 'bout my good name\n\nIt's mine alone to disgrace\n\nI don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing\n\nFUCKING TELL THEM, GIRL!!!! You don't give a FUCK about what they have to say about you! If you want to burn your life down, you'll do it yourself! You're not fooled by these fake ass bitches. Never let them forget it. Originally on Genius lyrics it read, \"empire's clothing\" which I thought was a call to \"emperor's new clothes,\" exposing those who put on airs but in reality are just grifters. I think it still applies with the real lyrics being \"empath's clothing.\"\n\nGod save the most judgmental creeps\n\nWho say they want what's best for me\n\nSanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see\n\nThinkin' it can change the beat\n\nOf my heart when he touches me\n\nNow we're spelling it out nice and clear. TAYLOR DOESN'T CARE WHAT YOU THINKKKKK!!!!!!\n\nScandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer\n\nWe came back when the heat died down\n\nWent to my parents and they came around\n\nAll the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over\n\nNow I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and\n\nEven my daddy just loves him\n\nI'm his lady\n\nAnd oh my God, you should see your faces\n\nTime, doesn't it give some perspective?\n\nAnd no, you can't come to the weddin'\n\nI know it's crazy, but he's the one I want\n\nI think this song would hit harder in terms of the \"story\" of Taylor's life if she was actually with Matty now. In retrospect, it seems like a lot of grief. But, again, she doesn't give a fuck what we think! He was her wild man and there was nothing we could ever do or say to take that away from her. You go girl.\n\nFresh Out The Slammer\n\nAh, yes. A tale as old as time. This entire song is, \"hey, I just broke up with my boyfriend and I'm going to place a call to ol' faithful.\" Let's get into it:\n\nNow, pretty baby\n\nI'm runnin' back home to you\n\nFresh out the slammer\n\nI know who my first call will be to\n\n(Fresh out the slammer, oh)\n\nI'd say this one is right on the nose!\n\nAnother summer, takin' cover, rolling thunder\n\nHe don't understand me\n\nSplintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter\n\nHe was with her in dreams\n\nShe was with Joe, but FANTASIZING ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE! (Matty, again)\n\nGray and blue and fights and tunnels\n\nHandcuffed to the spell I was under\n\nFor just one hour of sunshine\n\nYears of labor, locks and ceilings\n\nIn the shade of how he was feeling\n\nBut it's gonna be alright, I did my time\n\nTough to refer to your 6 year relationship as \"jail,\" but I think we all get it by now. Also a direct reference to her line in Reputation's \"…Ready For It\" where she boasts, \"He can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor\" referring to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor's tumultuous relationship.\n\nMy friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it\n\nWatch me daily disappearing\n\nFor just one glimpse of his smile\n\nAll those nights, he kept me goin'\n\nSwirled you into all of my poems\n\nNow we're at the starting line, I did my time\n\nThis girl was OBSESSED. Absolutely infatuated. Swirling him into all of her poems! In a twisted way, it's pretty romantic.\n\nTo the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams\n\nAnd no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway\n\nAin't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here\n\nAt the park where we used to sit on children's swings\n\nWearing imaginary rings\n\nAgain with the rings! I'm beginning to think Matty fake proposed to Taylor like, every single day.\n\nAll in all, great song. Not my favorite, again we're going heavy handed for Matty and I'm a little like \"ugh, okay\" but I really do get it. She was entranced! Possibly…enchanted?\n\nFlorida!!! (ft Florence + The Machine)\n\nOne of my favorites. This one is a lot more light hearted, talking a lot about being flustered by life and wanting to disappear and start a new one…somewhere like, FLORIDA! Florence + The Machine are incredible as always, and I foresee this one being a big summer song. Taylor said in an interview that when writing this song, she had been watching a lot of Dateline. More often than not, the people featured would flee to Florida and start a new life. LOL.\n\nYou can beat the heat if you beat the charges too\n\nThey said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true\n\nAnd my friends all smell like weed or little babies\n\nAnd this city reeks of driving myself crazy\n\nA perfect way to describe someone in their 30s who isn't following a traditional life path. I can relate hard to this. All of my friends are either pregnant, just had a baby, or doing the same thing I'm doing - smoking weed on my couch every night.\n\nLittle did you know your home's really only\n\nA town you're just a guest in\n\nSo you work your life away just to pay\n\nFor a time-share down in Destin\n\nFunny Taylor is here! Florida is basically the Bermuda triangle that everyone wants to disappear into.\n\nThe hurricane with my name when it came\n\nI got drunk and I dared it to wash me away\n\nBarricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine\n\nWell, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time\n\nYes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine\n\nAll my girls got their lace and their crimes\n\nAnd your cheating husband disappeared\n\nWell, no one asks any questions here\n\nThis was Florence's line and I'm fucking obsessed. \"Me and my ghosts had a hell of a time,\" just embracing the chaos and accepting it for what it is. She has a way with words too!\n\nI need to forget, so take me to Florida\n\nI've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida\n\nTell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable\n\nAt least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida\n\nLove it. Probably the most obvious song on the album, not directed at anyone in particular and like I said, a great sound. We'll be hearing a LOT of Florida. Nicely done.\n\nGuilty As Sin?\n\nOh boy, here's the sexy song we've all been looking for. The lyrics speak for themselves:\n\nMy boredom's bone-deep\n\nThis cage was once just fine\n\nAm I allowed to cry?\n\nI dream of crackin' locks\n\nThrowin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks\n\nCrashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox\n\nI'm seeing visions\n\nAm I bad or mad or wise?\n\nWrestling with thoughts of insanity, the only way to process such strong emotions. They're nearly impossible to ignore, and like the tides, you just have to go along with them or you'll drown.\n\nWhat if he's written \"Mine\" on my upper thigh only in my mind?\n\nOne slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze\n\nOh, what a way to die\n\nI keep recalling things we never did\n\nMessy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts\n\nWithout ever touchin' his skin\n\nHow can I be guilty as sin?\n\nHere she goes fantasizing again!!! Is she guilty, just for imagining it? The verdict says: no. We've all been there, girl. Sometimes your mind gets away from you!\n\nThese fatal fantasies\n\nGiving way to labored breath takin' all of me\n\nWe've already done it in my head, if it's make-believe\n\nWhy does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?\n\nTo me this sounds like a self fulfilling prophecy, which sometimes adds unnecessary pressure to something. You've already resigned yourself to the fact that, this is going to happen. It's a runaway train.\n\nWhat if I roll the stone away?\n\nThey're gonna crucify me anyway\n\nWhat if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?\n\nIf long-suffering propriety is what they want from me\n\nThey don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly\n\nI choose you and me religiously\n\nMore religious references. In this scenario, Taylor is Jesus Christ! She recognizes no matter what she does, even if it's to save herself, it won't matter when it comes to the court of public opinion. The whole song gives that vibe - I'm guilty, no matter what. Why not lean into it? Great tune. Now that I think about it, there are rumors that the song \"SLUT!\" was a duet with Matty until this blowup happened and Taylor redid the song for herself. \"SLUT!\" kind of has the same vibes!\n\nWho's Afraid Of Little Old Me?\n\nBANGER ALERT! ANTHEM ALERT! My current #1. I fucking LOVE the energy of this song, the manic thoughts and untethered rage expressed perfectly, as always. Let's see:\n\nIf you wanted me dead, you should've just said\n\nNothing makes me feel more alive\n\nSHE'S FUELED BY THE HATERS! Don't test her!!!\n\nSo I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street\n\nCrash the party like a record scratch as I scream\n\n\"Who's afraid of little old me?\"\n\nYou should be\n\nObsessed. Chaotic and unapologetic, embracing that assumption that she's a monster on a hill and giving the crowd exactly what they want - all the crazy. And, yes, you should be afraid of it.\n\nI was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean\n\n\"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth\"\n\nWho's afraid of little old me?\n\nWell, you should be\n\nThis is her talking to the media. \"No one likes a mad woman, you made her like that.\" I love the comparison to an animal who has had all its defenses removed for fear of it destroying everyone around it. It also makes me sad to think that Taylor's been made to feel this way by so many people.\n\nSo tell me everything is not about me, but what if it is?\n\nThen say they didn't do it to hurt me, but what if they did?\n\nI wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me\n\nYou wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me\n\nSo all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs\n\nI'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?\n\nThat I'll sue you if you step on my lawn\n\nThat I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong\n\nPut narcotics into all of my songs\n\nAnd that's why you're still singin' along\n\nA succinct list of all the things that people say and assume about her. Embracing that crazy. Honestly, it's remindIng me of shaved head Britney Spears beating up the paparazzi with an umbrella. Very, ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?\n\nYou caged me and then you called me crazy\n\nI am what I am 'cause you trained me\n\nSo who's afraid of me?\n\nWho's afraid of little old me?\n\n10/10 song. The sound is great, the lyrics are even better, and the message is received loud and clear - she hears what people say, and she doesn't give a fuck.\n\nI Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\n\nThe shortest on the first half of the album, and a total play on a 1975 song in title, sound and lyrics. Another Matty special about a fuckboy who just won't change his stripes.\n\nThe smoke cloud billows out his mouth\n\nLike a freight train through a small town\n\nThe jokes that he told across the bar\n\nWere revolting and far too loud\n\nHere is where the Lavender Haze is starting to clear, and Taylor is seeing this man for who he really is - the never changing jerk he's always been, or at least, regressed back to.\n\nThey shake their heads sayin', \"God, help her\"\n\nWhen I tell 'em he's my man\n\nBut your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger\n\nI can fix him, no, really, I can\n\nAnd only I can\n\nDon't worry Tay. We've all been there. Thinking we're the one and only person who can actually change someone for the better. Spoiler - it never works!\n\nGood boy, that's right, come close\n\nI'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all mine\n\nTrust me, I can handle me a dangerous man\n\nNo really, I can\n\nNo, yea, for sure! You totally can! Lolololol. Great song. I love a delusional anthem.\n\nloml\n\nThis is the first time I finally have a little sympathy for the situation. This girl was love bombed left and right, hung out to dry, led on for years, preyed upon at a vulnerable time…all to discover that he is the LOSS of her life. It's a little unclear who this song is about, though. People really think it's about Joe, and it could be. But idk! I get Matty vibes, again.\n\nWho's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames\n\nIf we know the steps anyway?\n\nWe embroidered the memories of the time I was away\n\nStitching, \"We were just kids, babe\"\n\nI said, \"I don't mind, it takes time\"\n\nI thought I was better safe than starry-eyed\n\nI've felt a glow like this never before and never since\n\nDamn. The feelings were just SO INTENSE and that really comes through on this track.\n\nIf you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary\n\nYou and I go from one kiss to getting marriеd\n\nStill alive, killing time at the cеmetery\n\nNever quite buried\n\nAnd you suit and tie in the nick of time\n\nYou low-down boy, you stand-up guy\n\nYou holy ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life\n\nYou said I'm the love of your life\n\nAbout a million times\n\nSometimes it doesn't matter how many times you hear it, its impossible for it to sink in. Especially when you've already decided it's…kind of a crock of shit.\n\nWho's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate\n\nAnd told me I reformed you?\n\nWhen your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes\n\nWell, you took me to hell too\n\nAnd all at once, the ink bleeds\n\nA con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme\n\nI've felt a hole like this never before and ever since\n\nMajor gasp. A perfect way to describe \"too good to be true.\" Nothing comes that easily.\n\nYou shit-talked me under the table\n\nTalkin' rings and talkin' cradles\n\nI wish I could unrecall\n\nHow we almost had it all\n\nDancing phantoms on the terrace\n\nAre they second-hand embarrassed\n\nThat I can't get out of bed\n\n'Cause something counterfeit's dead?\n\nIt was legendary\n\nIt was momentary\n\nIt was unnecessary\n\nShould I let it stay buried?\n\nThis is where the conflict comes in. Talking shit and making grand promises sounds like Joe, but \"should I let it stay buried\" sounds like \"should I not have rekindled this flame\" (Matty.) Either way, there's definitely exasperation here.\n\nOh, what a valiant roar\n\nWhat a bland goodbye\n\nThe coward claimed he was a lion\n\nI'm combing through the braids of lies\n\nI'll never leave, never mind\n\nOur field of dreams engulfed in fire\n\nYour arsons match your somber eyes\n\nAnd I'll still see it until I die\n\nYou're the loss of my life\n\nGut punch, again. The bland goodbye/cowardly lion lines make me think of Joe. So much time, such a \"loving relationship\" totally gone to waste. A loss, indeed. Very sad song. I loved it.\n\nI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\n\nANOTHER BANGER ALERT!!!!! Major fucking bop. I was dancing in the shower to this today. It's all about how no matter what Taylor has going on in her life, she still has to perform, and nobody is the wiser. She explains:\n\nI can read your mind\n\n\"She's having the time of her life\n\nThere in her glittering prime\n\nThe lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night\"\n\nI can show you lies\n\nGlittering on stage at the Eras Tour through tears, literally. It's very much giving \"And I might be okay but I'm not, fine at all\" but with a fun, morbidly positive twist.\n\n'Cause I'm a real tough kid\n\nI can handle my shit\n\nThey said, \"Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it\" and I did\n\nLights, camera, bitch, smile\n\nEven when you wanna die\n\nHe said he'd love me all his life\n\nBut that life was too short\n\nBreaking down, I hit the floor\n\nAll the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, \"More\"\n\nI was grinnin' like I'm winnin'\n\nI was hittin' my marks\n\n'Cause I can do it with a broken heart\n\nWOMEN CAN DO ANYTHING! TAYLOR SWIFT CAN DO ANYTHING!\n\nI'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day\n\nI'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague\n\nI cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art\n\nYou know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart\n\nSome of the most honest lines she's ever written. Everything has gone to shit, she's depressed as hell, her man is ghosting her, and she still has to get out there and WORK.\n\nYou know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart\n\nYou know you're good, haha, good\n\n'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)\n\nAnd nobody even knows\n\nAh, try and come for my job\n\nMoral of the story? Nobody does it like Taylor. Even at her worst, she's giving us her best. We don't deserve her.\n\nThe Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\n\n\"Hi, police? I'd like to report a murder.\" Matty Healy needs to enter witness protection after this one. Don't believe me? See for yourself:\n\nWas any of it true?\n\nGazing at me starry-eyed\n\nIn your Jehovah's Witness suit\n\nWho the fuck was that guy?\n\nYou tried to buy some pills\n\nFrom a friend of friends of mine\n\nThey just ghosted you\n\nNow you know what it feels like\n\nBROOOOOOO. This man fucked up BAD. Even friends of friends don't fuck with you anymore.\n\nAnd I don't even want you back, I just want to know\n\nIf rusting my sparkling summer was the goal\n\nAnd I don't miss what we had, but could someone give\n\nA message to the smallest man who ever lived?\n\nDo we think anyone has delivered this message yet? I sure hope so!\n\nYou hung me on your wall\n\nStabbed me with your push pins\n\nIn public, showed me off\n\nThen sank in stoned oblivion\n\n'Cause once your queen had come\n\nYou'd treat her likе an also-ran\n\nYou didn't measure up\n\nIn any measurе of a man\n\nDRAG HIM QUEEN! RIGHT THROUGH THE MUD!\n\nWere you sent by someone who wanted me dead?\n\nDid you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?\n\nWere you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?\n\nIn fifty years, will all this be declassified?\n\nAnd you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, \"Good riddance\"\n\n'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden\n\nI would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside\n\nAnd you deserve prison, but you won't get time\n\nYou'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars\n\nYou crashed my party and your rental car\n\nYou said normal girls were boring\n\nBut you were gone by the morning\n\nYou kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing\n\nDRAG AFTER DRAG AFTER DRAG. Wow. Sounds like she kind of fucking hates this guy. Also, the line of \"you crashed my party\" reminds me of Betty. Was Matty Healy just James all along?\n\nThe Alchemy\n\nFinally, some sunshine and rainbows!! This is the song about Travis, and their undeniable chemistry. I'll be the first to admit it was a little jarring/cheese, but like I said - her thoughts of him should be light hearted, and that's exactly what she's telling us:\n\nThis happens once every few lifetimes\n\nThese chemicals hit me like white wine\n\nWhat if I told you I'm back?\n\nThe hospital was a drag\n\nWorst sleep that I ever had\n\nI circled you on a map\n\nI haven't come around in so long\n\nBut I'm coming back so strong\n\nHe's bringing her back to life!!! Awwwww\n\nSo when I touch down\n\nCall the amateurs and cut 'em from the team\n\nDitch the clowns, get the crown\n\nBaby, I'm the one to be\n\n'Cause the sign on your heart\n\nSaid it's still reserved for me\n\nHonestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?\n\nA little on the nose with \"touch down,\" leaving little to the imagination. I also think \"ditch the clowns\" is a direct shot at Travis' old publicist, Pia, who famously shared a photo from her friend who put a clown emoji over Taylor's face. Karma is my boyfriend!\n\nThese blokes warm the benches\n\nWe've been on a winning streak\n\nHe jokes that \"It's heroin, but this time with an E\"\n\nShe's had just about enough of these British boys, and she found a man who makes HER the hero of the story. GUSHING!!!!\n\nShirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads\n\nBeer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said\n\nThere was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league\n\nWhere's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me\n\nA perfect song for Travis. Referencing the fact that no matter what he's doing in the life he has, he always makes time for her. Even if it means ignoring the Super Bowl trophy just to give her a big fat smooch. Precious.\n\nClara Bow\n\nThis one is very intense. Clara Bow, the real person and starlet, had a tough time with the limelight and struggled with her mental health. Taylor likens herself to this, obviously. This whole song reminds me of a darker version of \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" where Taylor finds herself similar to the subject at hand. This time she isn't buying a house, she's checking into the psych ward. LOVE IT.\n\nYou look like Clara Bow\n\nIn this light, remarkable\n\nAll your life, did you know\n\nYou'd be picked like a rose?\n\nI'm not trying to exaggerate\n\nBut I think I might die if it happened\n\nDie if it happened to me\n\nNo one in my small town thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan\n\nAs usual, she was underestimated and made it big. But can she handle it?\n\nThis town is fake, but you're the real thing\n\nBreath of fresh air through smoke rings\n\nTake the glory, give everything\n\nPromise to be dazzling\n\nYou look like Stevie Nicks\n\nIn '75, the hair and lips\n\nCrowd goes wild at her fingertips\n\nHalf moonshine, a full еclipse\n\nThis all feels self explanatory to me. The parallels are real. Clara Bow, Stevie Nicks - both women who exposed their vulnerability and shot to stardom - but at what cost?\n\nBeauty is a beast that roars down on all fours\n\nDemanding more\n\nOnly when your girlish glow flickers just so\n\nDo they let you know?\n\nIt's hell on earth to be heavenly\n\nThem's the breaks, they don't come gently\n\nYou look like Taylor Swift\n\nIn this light, we're lovin' it\n\nYou've got edge, she never did\n\nThe future's bright, dazzling\n\nCementing herself among the greats, making it very clear how she feels about fame in general. It's a fickle thing, as we all know. Wrapping it up as if it's someone new being compared to Taylor, just as she was compared to others. An extremely smart song. Love it.\n\n~~~~THE ANTHOLOGY~~~~ (side 2)\n\nI can't believe how long I've been writing this blog and I'm only halfway done. WE PRESS ON!\n\nThe Black Dog\n\nThis one is a big favorite. The Black Dog is a bar that Taylor's old love is at, but she isn't there. Let's digest:\n\nI am someone who until recent events\n\nYou shared your secrets with\n\nAnd your location, you forgot to turn it off\n\nAnd so I watch as you walk\n\nInto some bar called The Black Dog\n\nAnd pierce new holes in my heart\n\nYou forgot to turn it off\n\nAnd it hits me\n\nWOOF. First off, sharing your location is insanity. I know the married crowd always feels differently but I feel strongly that it's ALWAYS done more harm than good. That being said, we've all been there. Finding out things we technically shouldn't because of technology. Ouch.\n\nI just don't understand how you don't miss me\n\nIn The Black Dog, when someone plays \"The Starting Line\"\n\nAnd you jump up, but she's too young to know this song\n\nThat was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming\n\nOld habits die screaming\n\nTo me it sounds like 1, she's upset to feel \"forgotten.\" Two, she's throwing a little shade at whoever \"he\" is with now. She's too young to even know the song that's playing at the bar. CUTS DEEP.\n\nI move through the world with a heart broken\n\nMy longing state unspoken\n\nAnd I may never open up thе way I did for you\n\nAnd all of those best laid plans\n\nYou said I needed a bravе man\n\nThen proceeded to play him\n\nUntil I believed it too\n\nAnd it kills me\n\nListen. We've all been made a fool of before. It fucking sucks. Even Taylor isn't safe from being told time and time again to trust that the truth is being delivered, when it isn't. It hurts just as bad every time.\n\nNow I wanna sell my house\n\nAnd set fire to all my clothes\n\nAnd hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons\n\nEven if I die screaming\n\nAnd I hope you hear it\n\nMore religious references, interesting. It's easy to imagine this feeling - like everything has gone to shit and you just want to burn your entire life down. Preach, girl. This song is pretty depressing and I think accurately portrays that feeling of \"losing\" someone, and how it's still a difficult thing to go through even when it's what you wanted all along.\n\nimgonnagetyouback\n\nThis one is a direct shot at Matty Healy (again.) The title of the song is written in 1975 fashion, and the references are pulled from a lot of their songs:\n\nWhether I'm gonna be your wife or\n\nGonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet\n\nBut I'm gonna get you back\n\nWhether I'm gonna curse you out or\n\nTake you back to my house, I haven't decidеd yet\n\nBut I'm gonna get you back\n\nThe 1975 song in question is called \"fallingforyou,\" with specific references to Matty's own bike, and to the fact that Taylor said she would one day bring him to her house. SCANDAL! Smash up that bike girl!\n\nSmall talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did\n\nI'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch\n\nThen ran and hid\n\nAnd I'll tell you one thing, honey\n\nI can take the upper hand and touch your body\n\nFlip the script and leave you like a dumb house party\n\nOr I might just love you 'til the end (Ah)\n\nShe's clearly conflicted here. This song sounds sassy to me, like \"maybe I will, maybe I won't.\" Threat vibes! But definitely a little angry flirting. Apart from \"the smallest man who ever lived,\" I'm willing to bet that Matty is low key loving all this attention.\n\nBygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into grey (Fading into grey)\n\nWe broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)\n\nTold my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same\n\nPick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way (Ha)\n\nImmediately in my head I've got \"so it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames.\" If anything, she's consistent! Bravo, bravo.\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: It's 11:26pm, and I've just smoked a little weed. The following reviews may reflect that.\n\nThe Albatross\n\nI really love this one. More \"monster on the hill\" vibes, Taylor clearly views herself as this giant burden on everyone else. It's sad, but man can this girl paint a picture:\n\nWise men once said\n\n\"Wild winds are death to the candle\"\n\nA rose by any other name is a scandal\n\nCautions issued, he stood\n\nShooting the messengers\n\nThey tried to warn him about her\n\nI love when Taylor writes about herself in the third person. In this instance she's obviously using the Albatross as a metaphor but it's still amazing.\n\nCross your thoughtless heart\n\nOnly liquor anoints you\n\nShe's the albatross\n\nShe is here to destroy you\n\nHell yes. Am I the Albatross? Taylor likes to refer to herself as the awful person that people paint her to be. Albatross here kind of feels like another way to say \"Maneater.\" A much more poetic way, if you will.\n\nWise men once said\n\n\"One bad seed kills the garden\"\n\n\"One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen\"\n\nLocked me up in towers\n\nBut I'd visit in your dreams\n\nAnd they tried to warn you about me\n\nOkay I am definitely the Albatross. Here I think she's trying to paint herself as \"the problem\" again. She's the one who will make you question yourself and maybe lose your moral compass. Girl, you're taking on way too much blame!\n\nWise men once read fake news\n\nAnd they believed it\n\nJackals raised their hackles\n\nYou couldn't conceive it\n\nYou were sleeping soundly\n\nWhen they dragged you from your bed\n\nAnd I tried to warn you about them\n\nSo I crossed my thoughtless heart\n\nSpread my wings like a parachute\n\nI'm the albatross\n\nI swept in at the rescue\n\nThe devil that you know\n\nLooks now more like an angel\n\nI'm the life you chose\n\nAnd all this terrible danger\n\nHere I imagine she's overcome the rumors and made it to a point where someone really KNOWS her. Or, is it that she's trying to get this across and no one is believing that she's genuine, or looking out for them, because of the terrible picture she feels has been painted of her? I really loved this one. Very sad, very self loathing, very misunderstood. I can relate!\n\nChloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\n\nWHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE? That's what everyone is asking, but I think they are truly just random names. It makes sense immediately in the beginning of the song:\n\nYour hologram stumbled into my apartment\n\nHands in the hair of somebody in darkness\n\nNamed Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\n\nAnd I just watched it happen\n\nAs the decade would play us for fools\n\nAnd you saw my bones out with somebody new\n\nWho seemed like he would've bullied you in school\n\nAnd you just watched it happen\n\nThis one to me is 1. clearly about Matty and 2, a clear depiction of \"right person, wrong time.\" It seems like these two have been doing this dance for a decade, and the timing never matched up for them. They watch each other with other people, and do nothing about it.\n\nIf you wanna break my cold, cold heart\n\nJust say, \"I loved you the way that you were\"\n\nIf you wanna tear my world apart\n\nJust say you've always wondered\n\nFUCK. Wow. Immediate tears for me on this one. What a cruel thing to say. Essentially, \"you've changed.\" Or the equivalent to, \"you aren't who I married.\"\n\nYou said some things that I can't unabsorb\n\nYou turned me into an idea of sorts\n\nYou needed me, but you needed drugs more\n\nAnd I couldn't watch it happen\n\nIf there's one thing about Matty Healy, it's that he loves drugs.\n\nSo if I sell my apartment\n\nAnd you have some kids with an internet starlet\n\nWill that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?\n\nLike it never happened\n\nPUKE. PUKE ON THE FLOOR. Are you telling me, my favorite song on Midnights, Maroon, is ABOUT MATTY????? First Cardigan, now this?? SAY IT AIN'T SO!! The internet starlet is also a line from \"The 1\"….\"you meet some woman on the internet and take her home.\" Was all of Folklore about Matty Healy? My brain is exploding. Despite all this, I fucking loved this song.\n\nHow Did It End?\n\nAnother major tearjerker. Fans think it's about Joe and I agree. Very much a \"how did we end up here?\" vibe to it.\n\nWe hereby conduct\n\nThis post-mortem\n\nHe was a hot house flower to my outdoorsmen\n\nOur maladies were such\n\nWe could not cure them\n\nAnd so a touch that was my birthright became foreign\n\nWe're getting VERYYYY poetic now. I have a feeling this song was simply a poem that she put a tune to. Right now we're looking back on a relationship that is now dead, and what happened.\n\nCome one, come all\n\nIt's happenin' again\n\nThe empathetic hunger descends\n\nWe'll tell no one\n\nExcept all of our friends\n\nWe must know\n\nHow did it end?\n\nUghhh PAINNNN. They're broken up, but it makes it too real to tell the world, so you only tell your friends. Otherwise, they'll have to prepare for all the questions. Delaying the inevitable!\n\nWe were blind to unforeseen circumstances\n\nWe learned thе right steps to different dancеs (Oh, oh-oh)\n\nAnd fell victim to interloper's glances\n\nLost the game of chance, what are the chances?\n\nSoon, they'll go home to their husbands\n\nSmug 'cause they know they can trust him\n\nThen feverishly calling their cousins\n\nThe rumor mill is always alive and well. They grew apart, neither of them had a grasp on reality, and everyone else seems to think they can just gab away about it whenever they want, behind their backs. Typical!\n\nGuess who we ran into at the shops?\n\nWalking in circles like she was lost\n\nDidn't you hear?\n\nThey called it all off\n\nOne gasp and then\n\nHow did it end?\n\nThis is where I really get got. Who among us hasn't been wandering around, wistfully lost and longing for a past love?\n\nSay it once again with feeling\n\nHow the death rattle breathing\n\nSilenced as the soul was leaving\n\nThe deflation of our dreaming\n\nLeaving me bereft and reeling\n\nMy beloved ghost and me\n\nSitting in a tree\n\nD-Y-I-N-G\n\nCHILLS. A very descriptive painting of death, a heavy handed metaphor for the death of this relationship. The opposite of K-I-S-S-I-N-G. This is some smart stuff, Tay. This song really ripped me apart and I feel like I'm not explaining it enough because it almost feels too personal. I can't imagine what it's like for Taylor to know that we all know her business, but completely understand her feelings of loss. Great song.\n\nSo High School\n\nLet's lift us back up with another sweet Travis Kelce song!!!! And a BOP at that. Normally I'm not a fan of a nostalgic/high school style track, it's just not my vibe. I do actually like this one, though. It's cute, fun, casual, lots of shoutouts to him and his friends.\n\nI feel so high school every time I look at you\n\nI wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you\n\nHe makes her feel young, wild and free!!!\n\nAnd in a blink of a crinklin' eye\n\nI'm sinkin', our fingers entwined\n\nCheeks pink in the twinkling lights\n\nTell me 'bout the first time you saw me\n\nI'll drink what you think and I'm high\n\nFrom smokin' your jokes all damn night\n\nThe brink of a wrinkle in time\n\nBittersweet sixteen suddenly\n\nI'm obsessed with the \"tell me bout the first time you saw me.\" Such an adorable conversation you always have with someone new, because it feels romantic and brings that thought of \"wow, he was loving me from afar.\" Super cute.\n\nI'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night\n\nYour friends are around, so be quiet\n\nI'm trying to stifle my sighs\n\n'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you\n\nBut look at you\n\nDo we think they actually watched American Pie together? LOL IF SO\n\nAre you gonna marry, kiss or kill me? (Kill me)\n\nIt's just a game, but really (Really)\n\nI'm bettin' on all three for us two (All three)\n\nGet my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)\n\nThen pull me to thе backseat (The backseat)\n\nNo onе's ever had me (Had me), not like you\n\nThe MFK line is a hilarious callback to an interview Travis had YEARS ago where he was asked MFK, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry. He chose to kiss Taylor and marry Katy, so it's even funnier looking back. I like her putting in the line that makes us think, \"it's just a game…but for real you would marry me, right?\" Also, these backseat lines? OKKKKK GET IT GIRL\n\nTruth, dare, spin bottles\n\nYou know how to ball, I know Aristotle\n\nBrand new, full throttle\n\nTouch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto\n\nIt's true, swear, scouts honor\n\nYou knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her\n\nBrand new, full throttle\n\nYou already know, babe\n\nWhile its laugh out loud to actually picture Taylor and Travis hanging out like this, it really is SO HIGH SCHOOL. Sitting in someone's basement while all the boys play videogames and you're huddled under a blanket in the corner. He knows ball, she knows Aristotle. POETRY AGAIN!\n\nI feel like laughin' in the middle of practice\n\nTo that impression you did of your dad again\n\nI'm hearing voices like a madman\n\nOMG a shoutout to Ed Kelce!!! Adorable. He's going to LOVE that.\n\nAll in all, a great song. Light again, showcasing the fact that they have a lot of fun, and can't get enough of each other. Underneath the surface, they're just two kids having fun.\n\nI Hate It Here\n\nAnother depression anthem. SAD GIRLS ARE EATING TONIGHT!!! Let's break it down:\n\nQuick, quick, tell me something awful\n\nLike you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy\n\nTell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is\n\nMy eternal consolation prize\n\nYou see, I was a debutante in another life, but\n\nNow I seem to be scared to go outside\n\nIf comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck\n\nNow that I know what's what\n\nTo me this song is all about being uncomfortable in your own skin, and the place you're at in life. Or, moreso not knowing how to be someone that everyone wants you to be, instead of being yourself.\n\nI hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind\n\nPeople need a key to get to, the only one is mine\n\nI read about it in a book when I was a precocious child\n\nNo mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears\n\nI'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here\n\nI hate it here\n\nAh, yes. Dissociating, a classic trauma response. Relatable!\n\nMy friends used to play a game where\n\nWe would pick a decade\n\nWe wished we could live in instead of this\n\nI'd say the 1830s but without all the racists\n\nAnd getting married off for the highest bid\n\nEveryone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now\n\nSeems like it was never even fun back then\n\nNostalgia is a mind's trick\n\nIf I'd been there, I'd hate it\n\nIt was freezing in the palace\n\nI love all this. I am NOT really a nostalgia girl. Or, I should say, I'm very selective with what I want to remember. I think it's really smart to remind people these days, who are so obsessed with the idea of nostalgia, that it's not all it's cracked up to be.\n\nI'm lonely, but I'm good\n\nI'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine\n\nI'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose\n\nThis place made me feel worthless\n\nLucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me\n\nAnd in my fantasies, I rise above it\n\nAnd way up there, I actually love it\n\nMore sadness but also more truth. Sometimes we put on a brave face even though we don't feel like we belong, or we deserve to be where we are. All in all, this is a sad song coupled with a slightly upbeat tune. It feels kind of sarcastic or defeated, back to that self deprecating energy we've kept throughout this whole album. Amazing.\n\nthanK you aIMee\n\nA masterpiece from top to bottom. I went in on this separately already. Still love it. And now, we have shirts on sale!\n\nI Look In People's Windows\n\nI love this one and it hits home for me. I, too, look in people's windows and have in fact seen things I didnt want to, or shouldn't have seen, while longing to see something else. The song makes me feel really lonely, which I'm sure is intentional.\n\nI had died the tiniest death\n\nI spied the catch in your breath\n\nOut, out, out, out, out, out\n\nNorthbound I got carried away\n\nAs you boarded your train\n\nSouth, south, south, south, south, south\n\nOur girl loves a train!! I get it. There's something both romantic and somber about a long train ride, looking out the windows, headed somewhere new or headed home.\n\nI look in people's windows\n\nTransfixed by rose golden glows\n\nThey have their friends over to drink nice wine\n\nI look in people's windows\n\nIn case you're at their table\n\nWhat if your eyes looked up and met mine\n\nOne more time\n\nDAGGER TO THE HEART. Ugh, totally heartbreaking. Feeling lost, looking for one more glimpse of a time where you felt like you were grounded. ITS SO SAD!!!!!\n\nDoes it feel alright to not know me?\n\nI'm addicted to the \"if only\"\n\nSo I look in people's windows\n\nLike I'm some deranged weirdo\n\nI attend Christmas parties from outside\n\nI look in people's windows\n\nMore self awareness about how it's something desperate that she feels ashamed to be thinking/doing. It never feels good to be left out in the cold! VERDICT: A perfect sad song.\n\nThe Prophecy\n\nI don't want to mash too many of my worlds together, but after Taylor's TIME interview where she referenced Horcruxes (from Harry Potter) I have no choice but to believe that she was inspired by the Prophecy in the story. The general message is that sometimes Taylor wishes she could rewrite what's already been written in the stars for her:\n\nHand on the throttle\n\nThought I caught lightning in a bottle\n\nOh, but it's gone again\n\nAnd it was written\n\nI got cursed like Eve got bitten\n\nOh, was it punishment?\n\nPad around when I get home\n\nI guess a lesser woman would've lost hope\n\nA greater woman wouldn't beg\n\nClearly she is feeling like she's gotten a raw deal when it comes to the relationship she's talking about here, and feels conflicted over whether or not it's \"fine\" for her to feel this way. It always is, girl!\n\nPlease\n\nI've been on my knees\n\nChange the prophecy\n\nDon't want money\n\nJust someone who wants my company\n\nLet it once be me\n\nWho do I have to speak to\n\nAbout if they can redo the prophecy?\n\nANOTHER STAB IN THE HEART. I don't want money, just someone who wants my company??? LONELY GIRLS STAND UPPPPP.\n\nCards on thе table\n\nMine play out like fools in a fablе\n\nOh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)\n\nSlow is the quicksand\n\nPoison blood from the wound of the pricked hand\n\nOh, still I dream of him\n\nDamn. Again we have her feeling like she's been made a fool of, and while thinking that it's written in the stars for her already to feel this way, she's still dreaming of a different outcome.\n\nAnd I sound like an infant\n\nFeeling like the very last drops of an ink pen\n\nA greater woman stays cool\n\nBut I howl like a wolf at the moon\n\nAnd I look unstable\n\nGathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table\n\nA greater woman has faith\n\nBut even statues crumble if they're made to wait\n\nI'm so afraid I sealed my fate\n\nNo sign of soulmates\n\nI'm just a paperweight in shades of greige\n\nSpending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay\n\nThis whole song tells me one thing: this girl just wants to feel okay. She wants to be told everything will be alright, she wants someone to make her feel safe and grounded. She's TIRED! So am I, girl. So am I.\n\nCassandra\n\nThis may or may not be another Kim/Kanye diss. It certainly seems so. The common theme is that Taylor was caught off guard by something terrible, and everyone came after her. Sounds a lot like real life!\n\nI was in my new house placing daydreams\n\nPatching up the crack along the wall\n\nI pass it and lose track of what I'm saying\n\n'Cause that's where I was when I got the call\n\nYup. The call that her shit was about to get ROCKED by a couple of liars.\n\nWhen the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'\n\nIn the streets, there's a raging riot\n\nWhen it's \"Burn the bitch,\" they're shrieking\n\nWhen the truth comes out, it's quiet\n\nA much more direct line. Kim/Kanye made a lot of noise but when it came time for the truth, they were quiet. And so was their family!\n\nSo, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst\n\nAnd tried to tell the town\n\nSo they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say\n\nDo you believe me now?\n\nI was in my tower weaving nightmares\n\nTwisting all my smiles into snarls\n\nThey say, \"What doesn't kill you makes you aware\"\n\nWhat happens if it becomes who you are?\n\nSnake references, so K/K. I love this last line - everyone always says something along the lines of \"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,\" but she's right - what if it does the exact opposite? How does anyone know if they're able to weather a storm?\n\nThey knew, they knew, they knew the whole time\n\nThat I was onto somethin'\n\nThe family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line\n\nThey all said nothin'\n\nBlood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll\n\nBet they never spared a prayer for my soul\n\nYou can mark my words that I said it first\n\nIn a mourning warning, no one heard\n\nWOW. \"blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll. I'm going to go ahead and jump on the wagon now, this is absolutely about the entire Kardashian/Jenner family. A shame, too. We all know they're all fans. A good song, cutting, sad for sure.\n\nPeter\n\nTo me, this song seems to be between two people who could never work out because of timing. Or, just not being able to find a middle ground. Taylor waited around for this person to get with it, but they just didn't. Now, she's confused and sad, seemingly blaming herself a bit for how it all turned out.\n\nForgive me, Peter\n\nMy lost fearless leader\n\nIn closets like cedar\n\nPreserved from when we were just kids\n\nIs it somethin' I did?\n\nThe goddess of timing\n\nOnce found us beguiling\n\nShe said she was trying\n\nPeter, was she lying?\n\nMy ribs get the feeling she did\n\nThis opening tells us she truly isn't sure how things fell apart. Was it timing? Or was I made to be a fool, again?\n\nYou said you were gonna grow up\n\nThen you were gonna come find me\n\nSaid you were gonna grow up\n\nThеn you were gonna come find mе\n\nSaid you were gonna grow up\n\nThen you were gonna come find me\n\nWords from the mouths of babes\n\nPromises oceans deep\n\nBut never to keep\n\nOh, never to keep\n\nEmpty promises seems to be a BIG theme on this album. Whether its Joe, Matty, the public - nobody wants to keep there word to Taylor. BLASPHEMY.\n\nWhen crossing your jet stream\n\nWe both did the best we could do\n\nUnderneath the same moon\n\nIn different galaxies\n\nMore feelings of \"missed connections.\" A lot of so close, yet so far.\n\nAnd I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn\n\nAs the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return\n\nWith your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned\n\n'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned\n\nAnd you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five\n\nAnd the shelf life of those fantasies has expired\n\nLost to the \"Lost Boys\" chapter of your life\n\nForgive me, Peter, please know that I tried\n\nTo hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)\n\nWhen you were mine\n\nBut the woman who sits by the window\n\nHas turned out the light\n\nShe waited around as long as she could, but it just wasn't worth it anymore. They are always in different seasons of life and despite who this song is \"about,\" it's really a sad idea. Things like this happen all the time, but eventually, you've got to know when to call it. It certainly sounds like Taylor has reached that point. She's apologetic, but she's doing it for the both of them. DEVASTATING!\n\nThe Bolter\n\nHere we have another great, even toned but sad song where Taylor uses a metaphor to describe herself in the third person. I LOVE IT! There were a lot of things going around about \"The Bolter\" when the track list came out, some based on folklore (a story about a hare), some based on the more obvious meaning of the word. Everyone thought it could be in reference to Joe \"bolting\" but just when we think one thing, Taylor flips us on our heads. SHE, is The Bolter.\n\nBy all accounts, she almost drowned\n\nWhen she was six in frigid water\n\nAnd I can confirm she made\n\nA curious child, ever reviled\n\nBy everyone except her own father\n\nWith a quite bewitching face\n\nSplendidly selfish, charmingly helpless\n\nExcellent fun 'til you get to know her\n\nThen she runs like it's a race\n\nBehind her back, her best mates laughed\n\nAnd they nicknamed her \"The Bolter\"\n\nTaylor's talked a lot about feeling like she was ignored and misunderstood when she was younger. It seems she's had a real sense of when she wasn't being taken seriously from a young age - preach sister! The frustration that follows would then lead her to exiting the situation, all not to feel like a burden.\n\nStarted with a kiss\n\n\"Oh, we must stop meeting like this\"\n\nBut it always ends up with a town car speeding\n\nOut the drive one evening\n\nEnded with the slam of a door\n\nThen he'll call her a whore\n\nWish he wouldn't be sore\n\nBut as she was leaving\n\nIt felt like breathing\n\nThis to me is just painting a picture of a fight. Heading into a night lying to yourselves, \"nothing's going to happen!\" when you know where it's going to go. Which means you also know when it's going to get bad, so you…BOLT. Oh, and that it feels great to do! We love running away from our problems in this Haus Of Swift!\n\nAll her fuckin' lives\n\nFlashed before her eyes\n\nIt feels like the time\n\nShe fell through the ice\n\nThen came out alive\n\nOh shit, this is actually way more intense than I remembered. It must've been a HUGE fight. I mean, yea. He called her a whore! I'd be pissed!\n\nHe was a cad, wanted her bad\n\nJust like any good trophy hunter\n\nAnd she liked the way it tastes\n\nTaming a bear, making him care\n\nWatching him jump then pulling him under\n\nAnd at first blush, this is fate\n\nWhen it's all roses, portrait poses\n\nCentral Park Lake in tiny rowboats\n\nWhat a charming Saturday\n\nThat's when she sees the littlest leaks\n\nDown in the floorboards\n\nAnd she just knows she must bolt\n\nWe've all gotten the general theme now, right? Before things get too real, LEAVE. Abandon ship, literally. That's where Taylor's head had been at. Old habits die screaming!\n\nShe's been many places with\n\nMen of many faces\n\nFirst, they're off to the races\n\nAnd she's laughing, drawin' aces\n\nBut none of it is changin'\n\nThat the chariot is waitin'\n\nHearts are hers for the breakin'\n\nThere's escape in escaping\n\nWoooowww. \"There's escape in escaping.\" What I hear, is that there is CONTROL in escaping. Absolutely. I would think that it's second nature to want to protect yourself, and always having control over your situation when so much of your life is already out of your control? That's a hard habit to kick. I'd say all in all, this song is pretty chaotic in a whirlwind romance kind of way. Kind of back to our homies Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton again. This time though, I don't think it's about Joe. Or, could it be? Maybe I've been assuming him such a dud this whole album that I haven't considered he used to have a little spice about him.\n\nRobin\n\nOn first listen it was nearly 4am after the drop, and I absolutely did not appreciate this song enough. After a few more listens, it may have to go into the category of \"so sad I can't really listen to it all the time.\" The entire thing is basically a message to a younger version of yourself, while protecting it, too.\n\nLong may you reign\n\nYou're an animal, you are bloodthirsty\n\nOut window panes talking utter nonsense\n\nYou have no idea\n\nStrings tied to levers\n\nSlowed-down clocks tethered\n\nAll this showmanship\n\nTo keep it for you in sweetness\n\nHere she's acknowledging that she would never want her younger self losing her spark or passion, and in order to do that, things must be kept from you. It seems she's realizing now as an adult that it's not in a malicious way, and the people around her wanted to protect her.\n\nWay to go, tiger\n\nHigher and higher\n\nWilder and lighter\n\nFor you\n\nLong may you roar\n\nAt your dinosaurs\n\nYou're a just ruler\n\nCovered in mud, you look ridiculous\n\nAnd you have no idea\n\nThis is more of \"keeping that childlike wonder.\" That lack of care, the freedom to be yourself. Not wanting anything to get in the way of that innocence.\n\nYou got the dragonflies above your bed\n\nYou have a favorite spot on the swing set\n\nYou have no room in your dreams for regrets\n\n(You have no idea)\n\nThe time will arrive for the cruel and the mean\n\nYou'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline\n\nBut now we'll curtail your curiosity\n\nIn sweetness\n\nMore of that (good) nostalgia Taylor loves, has me crying in the club rn. We all had something hanging above our beds like that! Ugh, what a time too. I love \"the time will arrive for the cruel and the mean,\" like there's plenty of time to have to face the reality of life. Why rush it? PS - I also had a trampoline. Just saying. So, yes. Right into the \"automatic tears\" file.\n\nThe Manuscript\n\nHoly shit, I can't believe we're on the last one. I can't decide if what I've done is impressive given the amount of time it's taken me to do it, but something tells me no. I'm going to go ahead and pat myself on the back for it, though, just so it was worth it to write ~13,000 words about all this.\n\nThe Manuscript may be the most important track on the entire album. Both sides. It's the final chapter, the end, the summary of events. The Post Mortem. Not just in this album, but in all of Taylor's life. We have tons of references to different people and things from her past, and ultimately the tone of it is, \"we're moving on.\"\n\nNow and then she rereads the manuscript\n\nOf the entire torrid affair\n\nThey compared their licenses\n\nHe said, \"I'm not a donor but\n\nI'd give you my heart if you needed it\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes and said\n\n\"You're a professional\"\n\nHe said, \"No, just a good samaritan\"\n\nHe said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was\n\nSoon they'd be pushin' strollers\n\nBut soon it was over\n\nWe start off in what seems to be the Land of Red and/or Speak Now. This little exchange that we're reminiscing on could've been Jake Gyllenhaal, or John Mayer - based on the \"they compared their licenses\" line. It all feels very \"smooth talkin' older guy.\"\n\nIn the age of him, she wished she was thirty\n\nAnd made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press\n\nAfterwards she only atе kids' cereal\n\nAnd couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed\n\nThen she dated boys who were her own age\n\nWith dart boards on the backs of their doors\n\nShe thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years\n\nEverything had been above board\n\nShe wasn't sure\n\nAnd here's more confirmation about the age difference. She wished to be older so she would feel more secure, but ultimately it wasn't the move, or her fault. The line about sleeping in her mother's bed is heartbreaking - a place she felt safe when she needed it.\n\nAnd the years passed\n\nLike scenes of a show\n\nThe professor said to write what you know\n\nLookin' backwards\n\nMight be the only way to move forward\n\nThen the actors\n\nWere hitting their marks\n\nAnd the slow dance\n\nWas alight with the sparks\n\nAnd the tears fell\n\nIn synchronicity with the score\n\nAnd at last\n\nShe knew what the agony had been for\n\nChills up my entire fucking spine. Wow. Mirrorball throwbacks, expressing how she feels like she needs to go through all this pain to put on a show - all while having the actual need to heal.\n\nThe only thing that's left is the manuscript\n\nOne last souvenir from my trip to your shores\n\nNow and then I reread the manuscript\n\nBut the story isn't mine anymore\n\nI'm sobbing on the keyboard. Holy shit. \"The Manuscript\" is the story of her life, that she gave to us. She reflects back on it sometimes, but after it's become ours, it doesn't even feel like her own anymore. She's moved on. It's ours now.\n\nI don't think there's a better way to end this blog. A complete masterpiece from top to bottom, one that will only grow with time. It's truly so much fun to throw yourself into loving something like music or storytelling, and respecting an artist who is the fucking BEST at it. Taylor Swift, as always, you are a Goddess among mortals.\n\nAnd let's add a few more words for Taylor so we hit that lucky number…13."
