        "text": "Jump head first, fearless into planning a party inspired by the country and pop princess herself. Taking these handy hints will make your soirée a true Swifty success. With her albums ranging from fun-loving, ethereal, and country-sweet to rebellious, sassy, and smart, there are plenty of ways to enjoy a Taylor Swift themed party.\n\nOver 15 years since her big break with Love Story, Taylor’s personal, professional, and music style has evolved time and time again, not to mention the excitement of the Eras Tour! Her fanbase has grown alongside it, with Swifties worldwide embracing the various parts of the icon’s career. A versatile queen makes for versatile inspiration, so there really is no end to the party opportunities in her honor.\n\nFrom a Taylor Swift birthday party theme, to wedding showers, and even New Year’s Day, get ready to celebrate in a big way with Taylor Swift party ideas. There’s a lot that goes into planning a paparazzi-worthy event, and it’s time to get started…Ready for it? Here's everything you need for a Taylor Swift themed party.\n\nPro Tip: Check out our Taylor Swift party ideas Pinterest board for more inspiration or book a Taylor Swift impersonator to really amplify your event.\n\nTaylor Swift Themed Party Invitations\n\nPhoto: Etsy\n\nLet guests know the theme in big, bold letters; meet me at midnight. Of course if you want to get the party started earlier, put the designated time below. This is a fun DIY project to get your creative juices flowing or you can browse Taylor Swift themed party invitations on Etsy.\n\nTaylor Swift Themed Party Venues\n\nWhere you at? Every Taylor Swift theme party needs a picture-perfect setting, whether that’s a dive bar on the east side or something a little more luxurious.\n\nCountry Inspired\n\nPhoto: Anna Grishenko/shutterstock.com\n\nFans of the early days will have a special nostalgia for countryside settings. Think small town, open space, and the rustic vibes that brought her debut album and Fearless to the front of the Nashville scene.\n\nA country music venue is an ideal choice for smaller events, while a barn has a spacious feel and acts as a blank canvas for larger celebrations. Gather decor items like lanterns, fairy lights, hay bales, and you’ve got yourself a space fit for a country king or queen.\n\nSeaside Soirée\n\nPhoto: ARENA Creative/shutterstock.com\n\nHave your own barbie on a boardwalk moment by the beach and enjoy a seafront celebration. Taylor is known to host an epic beach bash every summer at her last great American dynasty Holiday House in Watch Hill, so take real-life inspiration from the queen herself!\n\nFor those who run wild singing Starlight on a sunny summer's day or lovers who sit on a bench on Coney Island, the salty sea air has a special hold. Give some thought to the weather forecast for this one though. While there’s something about the way the street looks when it’s just rained, your guests may not appreciate the poetic beauty in reality!\n\nWild Woodland\n\nPhoto: LL_studio/shutterstock.com\n\nMiss Swift has an undeniable love of nature, whether she’s out of the woods or immersed in the thick of it. With a wooded or parkland space, you can set up the day any way you please, channeling your inner ethereal goddess à la Folklore and Evermore.\n\nThere’s a ticklish beauty in a rose garden filled with thorns and a serenity in an afternoon by the lakes, giving you a world of opportunity with an outdoor venue. If you envision a chilled-out day with your nearest and dearest, then a picnic in the park might be just the thing for you.\n\nFlowing ‘fits and flower-adorned hair is all the rage right now, so roll out your best blanket and soak in the sunshine like a true Taylor Swift song lyric.\n\nDive Bar\n\nPhoto: NTRdesign/shutterstock.com\n\nIf dive bar’s aren’t part of your vision for this party, you can find an upscale and tasteful bar venue available to book. Find a location in your nearest city that would inspire Taylor’s newest love story.\n\nOlive Garden\n\nPhoto: Mike Reddington/shutterstock.com\n\nA nod to a line in her song “no body, no crime,” host your Taylor Swift party at Olive Garden where Taylor and Este met up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine. Enjoy an evening of pasta, merlot, and of course, their unlimited breadsticks.\n\nTaylor Swift Themed Party Outfits\n\nIf you're wondering what to wear to a Taylor Swift themed party, take a look back at the different eras and allow your guests to choose their favorite. Taylor has supplied ample inspiration for this over the years thanks to her many phases and styles.\n\nHigh School Sweethearts\n\nPhoto: Erikson Stock/shutterstock.com\n\nBring it back to the basics with a varsity outfit guide like we see in You Belong With Me. Your friends can choose whether they want to be the superstar jock, loved-up cheerleader, or underdog nerd. This is the one high school party that everyone is promised an invite to.\n\nHipster-chic\n\nPhoto: John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images\n\nDoes it feel like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters? The trend isn’t just reserved for those who are feeling 22. Making the 2010s trend part of your event will give you the perfect excuse to wear those old clothes in your closet that you haven’t been able to part with.\n\nPajama Party\n\nPhoto: Look Studio/shutterstock.com\n\nGetting back together with your pals screams slumber party, right? Throw on matching jammies, set out the snacks, and turn the music up as you dance around the living room at your Taylor Swift themed party. Learn from Taylor’s mistake and pull the blinds to keep all peeking exes out of the picture.\n\nCardigans\n\nPhoto: Etsy\n\nBreak out the cardigan that makes you say it’s your favorite when you put it on, and wear it to the Taylor party! While any comfortable and oversize cardigan will do, replicas of the one seen in the cardigan music video are available on Etsy for purchase.\n\nThis look is best paired with a vintage tee, Levi’s, and black lipstick according to Taylor.\n\nTaylor Swift Themed Party Decorations\n\nBejeweled Decor\n\nPhoto: Lukaso82/shutterstock.com\n\nMake the whole place shimmer with Bejeweled party decorations! There are no limits for this detail; go big or go home. Think blue sparkly confetti, mirrorballs, and shiny gold star streamers to make your space shine. Incorporate blue and “Maroon” accent lighting for the ultimate “Midnights” setting.\n\nColor Schemes\n\nPhoto: Roman Samborskyi/shutterstock.com\n\nThis girl loves red so much that she named an album after it, and a color party is as good a theme as any. For other album-related inspo, look at the gothic style of Reputation and The Tortured Poets Department, Lover’s pretty pastels, or everything blue and glitter from Midnights.\n\nCan’t make up your mind? Combine it all and invite your friends and family to pick their favorite era and embrace it in their outfit!\n\nGorgeous Accents\n\nPhoto: Etsy\n\nTaylor Swift pretty much has a song lyric for every situation you can possibly be going through. New love? Check. First day of high school? Check. Not having your boyfriend show up to your 21st birthday party? Sadly, check.\n\nIf you’re feeling happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time or celebrating another occasion, you can find custom decorations available on Etsy. From a ‘Lover’ themed bachelorette party sign to an ‘I’m feeling 22’ birthday t-shirt, Etsy is your go-to party decoration destination.\n\nMidnights Balloon Clock\n\nYou heard Taylor; meet her at midnight. Use this timeframe as party decor with fun DIY crafts. Inflate 12 balloons and number them 1-12, then tape them on a blank wall in a large circle. Cut out two arrows of construction paper for the center hands and you’ve made yourself the ultimate “Midnights” clock that is larger than life.\n\nAfterglow Lighting\n\nPhoto: imging/shutterstock.com\n\nThere won’t be a need to dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light (unless you want to) with fun lighting to accent your party. Take inspiration from Taylor’s classic music videos like the fairy lights in ‘Enchanted’, the bright neon colors in ‘You Need to Calm Down’, or the warm lighting in ‘Bad Blood.’\n\nThis little touch will help bring your event to a Taylor-approved status. Bonus points if you incorporate a mirrorball-style disco ball!\n\nTaylor Swift Themed Party Entertainment\n\nLet the games begin! Judging by Taylor’s Instagram feed, she loves spending time with her squad, whether that’s hanging around having fun or heading out on the town. Take a page out of her book and get your besties together for unforgettable festivities.\n\nLive Performance\n\nPhoto: Hector Vivas/TAS23/Getty Images\n\nWhat could be more fitting than hearing some live covers of Taylor’s hits (besides seeing her live in person). Hire an acoustic singer guitarist to perform a personal show full of your favorite Taylor Swift songs.\n\nFind a Guitarist\n\nFace Painter\n\nPhoto: Maree Williams/Getty Images\n\nAny Swiftie knows the importance of the number 13, the Lover heart around Taylor's eye, or Reputation snakes. Recreate this iconic body art by booking a face painter to help guests accessorize their Taylor Swift themed party outfits.\n\nFind a Face Painter\n\nPhoto-Op\n\nPhoto: Gorodenkoff/shutterstock.com\n\nStart the day off with a celebrity-style photoshoot in a photo booth. Polaroid pictures are in, and we imagine Taylor had a thing or two to do with that. Set up a plain backdrop where you and your guests can snap your own 1989-inspired images as a keepsake of the Taylor Swift themed birthday party. Print your pic, shake it off, and add it to a paneled picture board beside all of your friends.\n\nFind a Photo Booth\n\nKeychain and Friendship Bracelet Making\n\nPhoto: Roslan RAHMAN / AFP/gettyimages\n\nSpeaking of keepsakes, does a keychain ever go out of style? We don’t think so. Whatever your thoughts are on the patriarchy, the iconic line from the ten minute song will be something we remember all too well. Get your pals around the table for some arts and crafts and enhance your car keys with a Taylor-made adornment.\n\nOf course any Taylor Swift theme party needs friendship bracelet making! Get plenty of beads with letters, stretchy string, and get ready to trade accessories with your besties during the party.\n\nKaraoke\n\nPhoto: Jacob Lund/shutterstock.com\n\nThe only teardrops on the guitar at your event will be tears of laughter during an all-out Swiftie karaoke session. There are over 200 songs in the singer’s repertoire, and your friends are bound to know the words to at least a few of them!\n\nSpice up the stage with props your pals can wear to match their song choice. A Shake It Off tutu, Fearless headband, or some Red lipstick can help bring the performance to life.\n\nFind a Karaoke DJ\n\nPin the Scarf on the Taylor\n\nPhoto: Jacob Varannay/shutterstock.com\n\nDid we ever find out what happened to that old scarf? Pinning it on Taylor is the best way to make sure she never loses sight of it again. Pin the tail on the donkey is a party favorite among kids, and who said they get to have all the fun? A cardboard cutout or poster and red scarf is all it takes, now spin your bestie around and see where the outerwear ends up. (No Taylors should be harmed in the making of these memories).\n\nThe Great War Name That Tune\n\nPhoto: ako photography/shutterstock.com\n\nQuestion…? Wouldn’t you love to go head-to-head with your fellow swifties to correctly guess the songs on the “Midnights” album? If you’re a diehard Taylor \"Mastermind” and are up for the challenge, play with her other 220+ songs for this fun and competitive game.\n\nSparklers\n\nPhoto: LStockStudio/shutterstock.com\n\nEnd the evening with a dazzling display of light. Watch the lights go down and then let sparks fly with a sparkler celebration as you round up a day of fun. This activity is sure to be one last hit at your Taylor Swift themed party. Be sure to check if this one works with your chosen space or venue, though!\n\nPicture to Burn Bonfire\n\nPhoto: Andris Barbans/shutterstock.com\n\nForget the past heartbreaks by taking Taylor’s advice and throwing the negativity away. Whether it’s a long list of ex-lovers or old pictures of people you are never, ever getting back together with, watch the sparks fly, safely of course with a picture to burn inspired bonfire.\n\nTaylor Swift Themed Party Food Ideas\n\nFrom the hearty meals of the South to decadent eats on the East Side, you and your guests can delight in a foodie experience that spans the states. Add a special touch and hire a caterer to handle the preparations of your Taylor Swift themed party food.\n\nBreakfast at Midnight\n\nPhoto: simona pilolla 2/shutterstock.com\n\nTaylor said it best; “it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight,” so indulge in your morning-time favorites at twelve o’clock during your party. Serve up some pancakes, avocado toast, and of course mimosas for this midnight breakfast.\n\nThis is Why We Can't Have Nice Wings\n\nPhoto: nelea33/shutterstock.com\n\nThis classic finger food is perfect for your Taylor Swift themed Super Bowl party or birthday celebration. Order a variety of chicken wings with your favorite sauces like Bad Blood buffalo, Lover lemon pepper, or The Tortured Poets Department teriyaki.\n\nAnti-Heroes\n\nPhoto: Arina P Habich\n\nIt's always exhausting rooting for the anti-hero, but always delicious to snack on a delicious sub! For Taylor Swift themed party food, order your favorite sandwiches to easily serve your guests. Incluse options like an Italian combo, buffalo chicken, or Philly cheesesteak.\n\nMeat and Three\n\nPhoto: Mina709/shutterstock.com\n\nThis Tennessean staple combines a meat of your choice with three sumptuous sides. Cornbread, fried pickles, sweet potato fries, and mac ‘n cheese are all solid options for a gloriously decadent dish.\n\nFish ‘n Chips\n\nPhoto: Andreea Tudor/shutterstock.com\n\nYou may not be able to take a trip to Cornelia Street and meet a London boy, but you can still enjoy traditional British food at this Swifty event. Fish ‘n chips is a well-loved treat across the pond and can fuel your friends through an evening on the dance floor.\n\nTraditionally, this meal is served wrapped in old newspaper, so why not make some prints of Reputation’s newspaper-style cover for a finishing touch?\n\nFairground Food\n\nPhoto: Ezume Images/shutterstock.com\n\nTaylor is a fan of a fairground, and with the delicious food you can find there, we’re not surprised.
