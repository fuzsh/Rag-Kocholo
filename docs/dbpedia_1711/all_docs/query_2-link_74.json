Hit the comments to access our forums and talk about what came out today, what albums you picked up, and to make mention of anything we may have missed.\n\nRead More “Albums in Stores â Aug 9th, 2024”\n\nThis past month I was able to catch up with RobbieTheUsed to discuss everything that went into his upcoming solo album. I also asked him about The Used’s latest B-sides record called Medz, The Used’s plans for celebrating their 25th anniversary as a band next year, what led him to explore this solo project, and what he likes best about pop music. Tomorrow, RobbieTheUsed will be releasing his second single from his solo album, called “The Feels”, and you can pre-save the track here.\n\nRead More “RobbieTheUsed”\n\nToday is a great day to share the new music video from indie folk artist, Kylie V, called “Lucky Streak.” On this heartfelt single, Kylie V blends an operatic voice with the songwriting chops of Halsey and Phoebe Bridgers to make their mark on the music scene. Kylie V shared:\n\nI wrote ‘Lucky Streak’ during the excruciatingly complex process of getting over someone, while everything else in my life seemed to be speeding up and getting better at a surreal pace. When I started this song in my notes, I was one one hand feeling lost and empty, and on the other hand it felt like all my dreams were beginning to come trueâlater in the month I wrote this song I played my biggest venue to date, and then flew across the country for another show. ‘Lucky Streak’ started as a folky breakup ballad, but as I worked on it with Josh (Eastman, my producer and friend), it began to blossom into what I think is one of my most fun songs, and took on an entirely different significance to me in the process.\n\nIf you’re enjoying this talented artist’s new single and video, please consider supporting Kylie V here. I was also able to catch up with Kylie V for a brief interview below.\n\nRead More “Kylie V – “Lucky Streak” (Video Premiere)”\n\nToday I’m so excited to bring everyone the new single from indie punk band, Massive Nightmares, called “Back to the Beach.” Formed in the fall of 2023, indie-punk band Massive Nightmares is composed of members of bands Great Lakes USA, No Trigger, Save Ends, and David New Joy. After a brief stint as three-piece, friend (and being in as many bands as possible, addict) Tom Ciesluk joined on bass, rounding out the four-piece with Myke Doyle on drums, Alex Heinz on lead guitar and Pat Lavalle moving over to rhythm guitar, helping to achieve a riff-heavy mix of hooks and harmonies. Massive Nightmares blends influences from melodic 2000âs punk with 80âs indie and alternative reminiscent of The Lemonheads meets the Bronx. Alex Heinz shared, “‘Back To The Beach’ is the first song I wrote post Great Lakes USA going on a hiatus, after years of chaotic riffing and screaming I wanted to change course in both my songwriting and vocal performance to something that felt more in touch with who I am now. Keeping the structure of the song very simple and focusing heavily on layering melody and harmonies (and with a massive assist from our producer Trevor Reilly) we found ourselves with breezy summer jam ready for radio. Lyrically the song is about how rad it is to go to the beach.” If you’re enjoying the early listen, please consider pre-ordering the band’s self-titled EP that releases on September 6th here.\n\nRead More “Massive Nightmares – “Back To The Beach” (Song Premiere)”"
