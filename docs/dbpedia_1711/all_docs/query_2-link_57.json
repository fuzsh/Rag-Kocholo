        "text": "> June Tabor > Songs > A Place Called England\n\nA Place Called England\n\n[ Roud - ; Mudcat 71303 ; Maggie Holland]\n\nMaggie Holland sang her own song A Place Called England on her 1999 album Getting There. She re-recorded it in 2007 for her anthology Bones. She noted on the first album:\n\nIt took me a long time to finish this song—and I probably would never even have started it if I hadnât emigrated to Scotland about six years ago. I tussled with it on long train journeys and hummed it to myself whilst grubbing about in the allotment. I could not have written it without the inspiration of Christopher Hillâs book The World Turned Upside Down, Leon Rosselsonâs song of the same name, Naomi Mitchisonâs Sea-Green Ribbons, William Cobbettâs Cottage Economy, Hamish Hendersonâs Freedom Come-All-Ye, Jean Gionoâs The Man Who Planted Trees, animated discussions with (rightly) proud and passionate Scots like Dick Gaughan (“The first place to be colonised in the British Empire was England”), and many a quiet and gentle gardener; Mr Harding, my aunt Amy Rawling, and my godfather Alan Wells, to name but three.\n\nThis YouTube video shows Maggie Holland in Antwerp, Belgium, at Folk in ât Stad on 30 March 2012:\n\nJune Tabor sang A Place Called England in 1999 on her album A Quiet Eye. This recording was later included on her 4CD anthology Always.\n\nThe Youngâuns sang A Place Called England on their 2017 CD Strangers. They noted:\n\nA Place Called England was written by Maggie Holland in the late 1990s and is arguably a more resonant and important song than it was then. Dave and Daniel are environmental activists (Daniel became better known as Swampy). Eileen Halliday achieved notoriety in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in the late 1990s by refusing huge amounts of money from Salisburyâs supermarket to buy her house, so they could knock it down and could buy a new store. The Diggers were the radical brand of agrarian socialism at St Georgeâs Hill, Surrey, in 1649. Mr Harding was a Hampshire gardener for whom Maggie also wrote the beautiful song A Proper Sort of Gardener.\n\nLyrics\n\nMaggie Hollandâs original version of A Place Called England\n\nI rode out on a bright May morning like a hero in a song,\n\nLooking for a place called England, trying to find where I belong.\n\nCouldnât find the old flood meadow or the house that I once knew;\n\nNo trace of the little river or the garden where I grew.\n\nI saw town and I saw country, motorway and sink estate;\n\nRich man in his rolling acres, poor man still outside the gate;\n\nRetail park and burger kingdom, prairie field and factory farm,\n\nRun by men who think that Englandâs only a place to park their car.\n\nBut as the train pulled from the station through the wastelands of despair\n\nFrom the corner of my eye a brightness filled the filthy air.\n\nSomeoneâs grown a patch of sunflowers though the soil is sooty black,\n\nMarigolds and a few tomatoes right beside the railway track.\n\nDown behind the terraced houses, in between the concrete towers,\n\nCompost heaps and scarlet runners, secret gardens full of flowers.\n\nMeeta grows her scented roses right beneath the big jetsâ path.\n\nBid a fortune for her garden—Eileen turns away and laughs.\n\nSo rise up, George, and wake up, Arthur, time to rouse out from your sleep.\n\nDeck the horse with sea-green ribbons, drag the old sword from the deep.\n\nHold the line for Dave and Daniel as they tunnel through the clay,\n\nWhile the oak in all its glory soaks up sun for one more day.\n\nCome all you at home with freedom whatever the land that gave you birth,\n\nThereâs room for you both root and branch as long as you love the English earth.\n\nRoom for vole and room for orchid, room for all to grow and thrive;\n\nJust less room for the fat landowner on his arse in his four-wheel drive.\n\nFor England is not flag or Empire, it is not money, it is not blood.\n\nItâs limestone gorge and granite fell, itâs Wealden clay and Severn mud,\n\nItâs blackbird singing from the May tree, lark ascending through the scales,\n\nRobin watching from your spade and English earth beneath your nails.\n\nSo hereâs two cheers for a place called England, sore abused but not yet dead;\n\nA Mr Harding sort of England hanging in there by a thread.\n\nHereâs two cheers for the crazy diggers, now their hour shall come around;\n\nWe shall plant the seed they saved us, common wealth and common ground.\n\nJune Tabor sings A Place Called England\n\nI rode out on a bright May morning like a hero in a song,\n\nLooking for a place called England, trying to find where I belong.\n\nCouldnât find the old flood meadow or the house that I once knew;\n\nNo trace of the little river or the garden where I grew.\n\nI saw town and I saw country, motorway and sink estate;\n\nRich man in his rolling acres, poor man still outside the gate;\n\nRetail park and burger kingdom, prairie field and factory farm,\n\nRun by men who think that Englandâs only a place to park their car.\n\nBut as the train pulled from the station through the wastelands of despair\n\nFrom the corner of my eye a brightness filled the filthy air.\n\nSomeoneâs sown a patch of sunflowers though the soil is sooty black,\n\nMarigolds and a few tomatoes right beside the railway track.\n\nDown behind the terraced houses, in between the concrete towers,\n\nCompost heaps and scarlet runners, secret gardens full of flowers.\n\nMeeta grows her scented roses right beneath the big jetsâ path.\n\nBid a fortune for her garden—Eileen turns away and laughs.\n\nRise up, George, and wake up, Arthur, time to rouse out from your sleep.\n\nDeck the horse with sea-green ribbons, drag the old sword from the deep.\n\nHold the line for Dave and Daniel as they tunnel through the clay,\n\nWhile the oak in all its glory soaks up sun for one more day.\n\nCome all you at home with freedom whatever the land that gave you birth,\n\nThereâs room for you both root and branch as long as you love the English earth.\n\nRoom for vole and room for orchid, room for all to grow and thrive;\n\nJust less room for the fat landowner on his arse in his four-wheel drive.\n\nFor England is not flag or Empire, it is not money and it is not blood.\n\nItâs limestone gorge and granite fell, itâs Wealden clay and Severn mud,\n\nItâs blackbird singing from the May tree, lark ascending through the scales,\n\nRobin watching from your spade and English earth beneath your nails."
