        "text": "Oh my goodness. I became obsessed with this project. I took every key word I heard in the folklore album and cross-referenced common songs. Example: The phrase, “chosen family” is in the song, The 1 and also in the song Peace. And that probably means something. It lets you know there is at least one connection between those 2 songs. And that knowledge will help untie the album, which is layered in meaning (see my other post about that). Then, I heard words in folklore that referenced Taylor’s past work. So I looked at 1989, Reputation, and Lover albums and tried to find every instance of common lyrics. For example, the word, “bleed” is in The 1 and Cardigan and Epiphany in this latest album, but it’s also in the lyric, “and if I bleed you’ll be the last to know” from the song Cruel Summer on the Lover album. It became crazy to try to use quotations, and I might italicize later so the format I used was:\n\n-Ignore any capitalization issues, they don’t mean anything. I am working from home and my work is CAPSlock, so many of these things were jotted while I worked.\n\n-Different color for each folklore song\n\n-folklore songs alphabetized for ease of sort & find\n\n-Title of folklore song bolded and underlined\n\n-the bolded word or phrase of interest with a “-” denoting each new one\n\n-wavy (is that what they’re called?) brackets {showing what other song on folklore contains that word/phrase}\n\n-brackets containing song title, followed by album name then an equals sign “=” with the quoted lyric that is connected\n\n-For many words and phrases in folklore, there are multiple song lyrics that apply from other albums, I have put each with a squiggle (?IDK the term?) to denote each\n\n-I attempted to put pictures that apply to the word/phrase/situation at hand, but WordPress is very heavy and unfriendly for that, so excuse formatting.\n\n-ctrl F was my best friend\n\nI think this is the sort of project that is never finished. For timeliness, I am posting as is, with the intention of adding more, clarifying, and amping it up.\n\nThe 1\n\n-never bleed you’re never gonna grow {also Cardigan and Epiphany} [Cruel Summer from
