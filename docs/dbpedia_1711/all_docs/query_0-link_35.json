        "text": "Knocked Loose are living up to their name by dropping the disgustingly heavy new song \"Blinding Faith\" while announcing their third studio album, You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To in the process.\n\nThere's no need for coffee or an alarm set this morning, as Knocked Loose have sufficiently smacked us all in the face and rattled us from our slumber with the crushing, over-the-top heaviness of \"Blinding Faith.\" Whirring riffs sound out like a siren against the backdrop of crushing low end bass and drums and Bryan Garris' in-your-face aggression. Simply put, it's a blistering, chaotic joyride for Knocked Loose fans certain to shake you to the core.\n\nAs for the lyrical content, \"Blinding Faith\" serves as an indictment against religious groupthink and the hypocrisy that comes with it.\n\n“It was just hilarious how many people showed up to church that I knew were rude, horrible, selfish people,” guitarist Isaac Hale reflects of attending church with his mother in his younger years. “They knew that it made them seem like a better person — or if they said the words, it would redeem them of any negative quality just because they showed face.”\n\nGet a listen and take a closer look at the lyrics below.\n\nKnocked Loose, \"Blinding Faith\"\n\nSubscribe to Loudwire on\n\nKnocked Loose, \"Blinding Faith\" Lyrics\n\nI am haunted\n\nBy the spirit again\n\nI can't feel it\n\nI pretend\n\nThere's something inside me that won't let it in\n\nIm alone\n\nSo I beg\n\nBeg for a chance in a circle of snakes\n\nA life consumed by faith\n\nFrom inside I can hear their call\n\nOffering the blood of god\n\nFall in line now\n\nBow your head\n\nI will suffer here instead of biting my tongue\n\nCondemned to a life of pain until my time has come\n\nNo promise of heaven will make me march\n\nWith my final breath\n\nI deny the church\n\nThe word becomes the law\n\nFall in line\n\nThe word becomes the law\n\nBend the knee\n\nChild of God\n\nBlinding faith\n\nFall in line\n\nBlind\n\nThe fans have also taken note. One fan noted, \"Knocked loose is getting closer and closer to just releasing an audio recording of the souls of the damned and im all for it.\" Another added, \"Knocked loose really said fuck you and got heavier.\" See more of the fan reactions to the new song below:\n\nKnocked Loose Announce a New Album\n\n\"Blinding Faith\" may be grabbing the spotlight, but there's a bigger record still to come. The new Knocked Loose album is titled You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To and it serves up a diverse collection of songs that shows their continued growth as a band.\n\nThe titular phrase originates from an experience that frontman Bryan Garris, who suffers from what he calls a “borderline phobia of flying,” had during a particularly trying flight. As he battled his nerves during takeoff, the vocalist found himself talking to a woman seated next to him. When he confided in her about his anxiety, she assured him, “You won’t go before you’re supposed to.” The sentiment seems to fit the 10-track album well.\n\n“On this album, we go the fastest we've ever gone; we go the scariest we've ever gone. We also go the catchiest and the most melodic that we've ever gone, and that's the point,” Isaac Hale says. “Instead of branching off into a specific direction, we want to encompass ALL directions.”\n\nLook for You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To on May 10. The album artwork and track listing can be found below, and you can place your physical and digital pre-orders for the album now.\n\nKnocked Loose, You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To Artwork + Track Listing\n\n1 - Thirst\n\n2 - Piece By Piece\n\n3 - Suffocate (ft.
