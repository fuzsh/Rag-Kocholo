        "text": "Taylor Swift releases ‘Fortnight’ music video featuring Post Malone\n\nThe first music video from \"Tortured Poets\" is here! Swift released the music video for \"Fortnight,\" the first single off the album which features Post Malone, Friday night as promised.\n\nThe predominately black-and-white video features Swift and Post Malone seemingly as lovers in some type of mental institution, and it appears to include multiple Easter eggs. Anyone else spot the similarities between her sculpted white gown and choker necklace in the music video and what she wore to the Grammys this year?\n\n‘Tortured Poets’ named Spotify’s most-streamed album in a single day\n\nIt's official! Less than 24 hours after its release, \"Tortured Poets\" was named Spotify's most-streamed album in a single day. And that's not all. The audio-streaming giant also said Swift became the most-streamed artist in a single day in the platform's history.\n\nAccording to a press release Spotify issued Friday evening, today's records mean that Swift holds the three most-streamed albums in a single day in Spotify history. \"Midnights\" and \"1989 (Taylor's Version) hold the No. 2 and No. 3 spots following \"Tortured Poets.\"\n\n'We hereby conduct this post-mortem,' explained\n\nThe release of \"Tortured Poets\" involved both global and digital scavenger hunts. One of them, uncovered through clues in the lyrics of Swift's discography on Apple Music revealed the sentence, \"We hereby conduct this post-mortem.\"\n\nNow, based on the lyrics to one of the songs released on the double album, we know what that means.\n\n\"How Did It End?\" opens with the lyrics, \"We hereby conduct this post-mortem,\" which the narrator implies is about the death of a relationship.\n\n\"He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsmen/ Our maladies was such/ We could not cure them/ And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign,\" she sings, implying the issues in the central relationship overruled any existing love and affection.\n\nShe then dives into the public nature of this \"post mortem\" and how her heartbreak can turn into a public spectacle — again.\n\n\"Come one, come all/ It’s happenin’ again/ The empathetic hunger descends/ We’ll tell no one/ Except all of our friends/ We must know/ How did it end?\"\n\nAaron Dessner celebrates Taylor Swift's 'vast and ambitious' 'Tortured Poets' album\n\nAaron Dessner of The National reacted to the release of \"The Tortured Poets Department\" by thanking Swift for her trust in him.\n\nDessner produced several songs on the album and first began collaborating with Swift on 2020's \"Folklore.\"\n\n\"So incredibly grateful and honored to contribute to this vast and ambitious album -- it’s not lost on me how lucky I am that @taylorswift13 shares her insane talents and trusts me to help make this music I hope you enjoy all 31 songs as much as I do!!\" he tweeted.\n\n'Tortured Poets Department' breaks another record\n\nIn addition to Spotify's streaming record, \"The Tortured Poets Department\" has officially broken an Amazon Music record, becoming the platform's most-streamed album for a first day, the streaming platform confirmed to TODAY.com Friday.\n\nWhy 1 line in the track ‘I Hate it Here’ is causing backlash\n\n\"I Hate It Here\" is one of the 15 songs released on the double album, and it's causing a bit of a stir online for one lyric specifically.\n\n“My friends used to play a game where/ We would pick a decade/ We wished we could live in instead of this/ I’d say the 1830s but without all the racists/ And getting married off for the highest bid,” Swift sings.\n\nShe goes on to complicate the story, saying no era is “fun”: “Nostalgia is a mind’s trick/ If I’d been there, I’d hate it/ It was freezing in the palace.”\n\nSwift’s version of the 1830s might involve palaces but people are pointing out what else it involved. Thirty years before the Civil War took place, slavery still was legal throughout the American South.\n\nOne X user wrote, “Pretty astonishing to stipulate that she wants to live in the 1830s, ‘except without the racists,’ and not mention slavery, so slavery still exists but everyone’s chill about it.”\n\nFans connect Swift's 'imgonnagetyouback' to Olivia Rodrigo's hit single 'Get Him Back!'\n\nOne of the 15 surprise songs released on Swift's second part of \"Tortured Poets\" is called \"imgonnagetyouback\" — and it immediately sparked comparisons to Olivia Rodrigo's song of a similar title, \"Get Him Back!\"\n\nRodrigo's \"Get Him Back!\" was released as part of her sophomore album, \"Guts,\" in 2023. Its lyrics had the narrator battling whether to get back together with someone or get revenge.\n\nRodrigo’s bridge goes: “I wanna key his car/ I wanna make him lunch/ I wanna break his heart/ And be the one to stitch it up.”\n\nOn her track, Swift sings: “Whether I’m gonna be your wife or/ Gonna smash up your bike, I haven’t decided yet/ But I’m gonna get you back.”\n\nThe comparison is notable due to the apparent falling-out Swift and Rodrigo had after the release of “Sour.” Rodrigo was accused of borrowing too much from Swift’s song “Cruel Summer” when she wrote her song “Deja Vu.” Swift and her collaborator Jack Antonoff were retroactively credited as co-writers on the Rodrigo song, but Rodrigo later told Time, “It was really frustrating to see people discredit and deny my creativity.”\n\nSome fans also suspected Rodrigo’s 2023 song “The Grudge” was about Swift.\n\nRead more here.\n\nFlavor Flav gives rave review of 'Tortured Poets'\n\nFlavor Flav has entered the chat.\n\nThe rapper shared a review of Taylor Swift's 11th studio album on X Friday, calling it \"sad and real.\"\n\n\"The best art is created from struggle and sadness,,, da anthology is sad and real and Taylor,,, It makes me wanna punch anyone that hurt that woman’s feelings,,, but no one can punch them worse than Taylor and her piano and pen. happy she found happiness,\" he wrote.\n\nFlavor Flav has publicly declared himself a Swiftie on multiple occasions. He notably attended the \"Eras Tour\" in June 2023.\n\n\"In my RED (Taylor’s Version) Era and makin new friends at #TaylorSwift,\" he posted on X.\n\n‘So High School’ lyrics: What does the Taylor Swift song mean?\n\nWhile so much of “Tortured Poets” is about heartbreak, “So High School” examines that giggly, adolescent kind of romance, transporting back to feeling like you’re 16 again.\n\nThe song has several references to staples of youth, like “I’m watching ‘American Pie’ with you on a Saturday night” and “Truth, dare, spin bottles” and “Touch me while your bros play ‘Grand Theft Auto.’”\n\nWhile we know Swift likes to write autobiographical songs, whom this song could be about is anyone’s guess. It does not seem to contain direct nods to certain people in the way that “thanK you aIMee” or “So Long, London” may have.\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nDid Taylor Swift's Time Person of the Year interview have 'Tortured Poets' Easter eggs?\n\nSwifties have officially resumed their search for all the Easter eggs they might've missed in the lead up to the \"Tortured Poet Department.\"\n\nLooking back at her interview with Time as the 2023 Person of the Year, here are some hidden references that might have been references to \"Tortured Poets\" all along.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nSwift and the Fleetwood Mac frontwoman have had a longstanding relationship, having performed together all the way back in 2010 at the Grammy Awards. Nicks, while not featured on the album, lends her pen to an introductory poem for the album. She's also referenced in \"Clara Bow,\" one of three women who have been historically examined by the public for their heartbreaks.\n\nNicks was interviewed by Time for the profile of Swift.\n\n“I don’t give Taylor advice about being famous,” Nicks said. “She doesn’t need it.”\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nSwift and Kim Kardashian have had a long-running feud since the reality star's comments and actions contributed to the public backlash that led to \"Reputation\" in 2017.\n\nFans immediately noticed on the surprise double album of \"Tortured Poets\" that one of the tracks, “thanK you aIMee,” has capital letters that spell \"KIM.\" The lyrics appear to be about a mean girl at school.\n\nKardashian, her ex Kanye West and the public feud with Swift was a focus in her Time interview. (See a timeline of their feud here.)\n\n“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” Swift said in the interview. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”\n\n'The Eras Tour'\n\nPredictably, a large part of her Time interview was about her record-breaking \"Eras Tour,\" which began in March 2023.\n\nBut \"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart,\" in which Swift's narrator sings about being \"miserable\" while performing for a crowd, puts the tour, and some of Swift's comments, in a new light.\n\n\"All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, “More” / I was grinnin’ like I’m winnin’ / I was hittin’ my marks / ‘Cause I can do it with a broken heart,\" she sings.\n\nIn December 2023, Swift told Time: “I knew this tour was harder than anything I’d ever done before by a long shot.\"\n\nThe comment was also made in reference to her strict training regiment at the gym to prepare for back-to-back nights of three hour-plus shows. In \"Down Bad,\" Swift notably sings, \"Now I'm down bad crying at the gym.\"\n\n'Barbie'\n\nDespite some fan theories, Swift was not featured on the soundtrack for the 2023 summer blockbuster \"Barbie.\"\n\nBut the film's director, Greta Gerwig, was interviewed about Swift in the Time article.\n\n“Her work as a songwriter is what speaks most clearly to me,” Gerwig said. “To write music that is from the deepest part of herself and have it directly speak into the souls of other people.”\n\nCould it have been a clue to the theme of \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\"? In the album's third track, Swift compares herself to a toy with a \"plastic smile,\" repeatedly crushed by a boy, like a child.\n\nThere's even a passing referencing to playing with Ken dolls: \"I felt more when we played pretend/ Than with all the Kens.\"\n\n'The Tortured Poets Department' breaks Spotify record for most-streamed album in a single day\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" smashed Spotify's record for most album streams in a single day, the streaming platform confirmed to Billboard Friday.\n\nThe standard version of the album dropped at midnight, and the record was broken in less than 12 hours.\n\nTaylor Swift reveals ‘Dateline’ as an inspiration for ‘Florida!!!’\n\nTaylor Swift has taken over radio stations, from Channel 13 on SiriusXM to iHeartRadio briefly renaming itself to iHeartTaylor and sharing messages from the songwriter.\n\nSwift revealed in a soundbite played on iHeartRadio that \"Florida!!!\", the eighth track of the album featuring Florence + the Machine, was inspired by \"Dateline.\"\n\n\"I'm always watching, like 'Dateline,'\" Swift said with a laugh. \"People, you know, have these crimes that they commit where they immediately skip town and go to Florida. They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.\"\n\nIt's the same with heartbreak, she said.\n\n\"I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks I want a new name. I want a new life,\" she said.\n\nOr perhaps in Swift's case — a new era?\n\nSwift has been open about her love for certain shows, books and other pop culture phenomenon. Her cats — Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson and Benjamin Button — are famously named after fictional characters.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Vogue, Swift said her favorite show of all time is \"Friends,\" but she named \"Dateline\" as her favorite show currently on air.\n\nTaylor Swift likes Instagram post with a ranking her exes and Travis Kelce. Where do they each fall?\n\nJust as fans were recovering from the shock of Taylor Swift releasing a secret double album overnight, Swift surprised fans yet again by doing something she rarely does: liking an Instagram post featuring memes about her love life.\n\nThe Instagram post in question, shared by the media company Betches, included a scene from the Lifetime reality series “Dance Moms” that showed coach Abby Lee Miller standing in front of the show’s infamous pyramid ranking system.\n\nOn “Dance Moms,” the pyramid ranked the best dancers of the week — but here, the pyramid ranks several of Swift’s exes (along with her current partner, Travis Kelce).\n\nKelce’s name unsurprisingly sits on the top of the pyramid, while Taylor Lautner, Tom Hiddleston and Harry Styles occupy the middle row.\n\nAlong the bottom row are Calvin Harris, Jake Gyllenhaal, Matty Healy, and her most recent ex, Joe Alwyn.\n\nThe Instagram post features four other slides, including a screenshot of a post from the Betches X account that reads, “Decoding Taylor Swift easter eggs feels like working 2 jobs, training for a marathon, dating a man who is emotionally unstable, and clocking in the overnight shift at the FBI all at once.”\n\nAnother slide features a screengrab of what appears to be a fan’s X post, reading, “Every time we get a new lyric the hunger games cannon goes off.”\n\nSwift didn’t appear to comment on the post, or clarify which meme(s) she appreciated the most, but the fact that she liked it at all launched her fans into orbit.\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nA deep dive on the prologue to 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nWhile Stevie Nicks' poem introduces the album, Swift also shared her own poem written \"in summation,\" like the findings of an academic thesis.\n\nIn the poem, she writes that the album is both a \"warning\" and a \"reminding\" that she \"had been struck with a case/ of a restricted humanity.\" As a result, she's entering a \"plea\" for \"temporary insanity.\"\n\nShe described being caged, seemingly by a relationship: \"Lovers spend years denying what’s ill fated/ Resentment rotting away.\"\n\nBut that ended, in \"one conversation,\" but something familiar returned to her: \"Then a crash from the skylight/ Bursting through/ Something old, someone hallowed/ who told me he could be brand new.\"\n\nShe writes that she was \"out of the microwave\" and \"out of the slammer\" — potentially a reference to track 7, \"Fresh Out The Slammer.\"\n\nBut still, that didn't last, either.\n\nIn closing, she writes that it wasn't a \"love affair,\" but a \"mutual manic phase\" and \"self-harm.\"\n\nShe adds, \"it’s the worst men that I write best.\"\n\nPer usual, Swift does not name the inspiration behind her songs. But it's notable that news broke in April 2023 that Swift and actor Joe Alwyn had split after more than six years together. A few weeks later, she was spotted out with The 1975 frontman Matty Healy, sparking dating rumors around May 2023.\n\nRead the full prologue:\n\nAt this hearing\n\nI stand before my fellow members\n\nof the Tortured Poets Department\n\nWith a summary of my findings\n\nA debrief, a detailed rewinding\n\nFor the purpose of warning\n\nFor the sake of reminding\n\nAs you might all unfortunately recall\n\nI had been struck with a case\n\nof a restricted humanity\n\nWhich explains my plea here today\n\nof temporary insanity\n\nYou see, the pendulum swings\n\nOh, the chaos it brings\n\nLeads the caged beast to do\n\nthe most curious things\n\nLovers spend years denying what’s ill fated\n\nResentment rotting away\n\ngalaxies we created\n\nStars placed and glued\n\nmeticulously by hand\n\nnext to the ceiling fan\n\nTried wishing on comets.\n\nTried dimming the shine.\n\nTried to orbit his planet.\n\nSome stars never align.\n\nAnd in one conversation, I tore down the whole sky\n\nSpring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues\n\nThen a crash from the skylight\n\nBursting through\n\nSomething old, someone hallowed,\n\nwho told me he could be brand new\n\nAnd so I was out of the oven\n\nAnd into the microwave\n\nOut of the slammer and into a tidal wave\n\nHow gallant to save the empress\n\nfrom her gilded tower\n\nSwinging a sword he could barely lift\n\nBut loneliness struck at that fateful hour\n\nLow hanging fruit on his wine stained lips\n\nHe never even scratched the surface\n\nof me.\n\nNone of them did.\n\n“In summation, it was not a love affair!”\n\nI screamed while bringing my fists\n\nto my coffee ringed desk\n\nIt was a mutual manic phase.\n\nIt was self harm.\n\nIt was house and then cardiac arrest.\n\nA smirk creeps onto this poet’s face\n\nBecause it’s the worst men that I write best.\n\nAnd so I enter into evidence\n\nMy tarnished coat of arms\n\nMy muses, acquired like bruises\n\nMy talismans and charms\n\nThe tick, tick, tick of love bombs\n\nMy veins of pitch black ink\n\nAll’s fair in love and poetry\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Chairman\n\nof The Tortured Poets Department\n\nVinyl variant of ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ includes 2 intimate poems\n\nTODAY independently determines what we cover and recommend. When you buy through our links, we earn a commission.\n\nThis may be the Swift’s most transparent album yet — literally and figuratively.\n\nThis morning, TODAY got a first look at one variant (exclusively available at Target) that underscores this transparency in the form of two “Phantom Clear” vinyl discs.\n\nAnd song lyrics aren’t the only pieces of evidence fans have to pore over. In keeping with the titular theme, this edition also contains two very personal poems: an introductory poem by Stevie Nicks (see more about that here) and a summary poem by Swift herself.\n\nWe analyzed the pages for potential clues and meaning here.\n\nStevie Nicks wrote Taylor Swift a poem for the dedication of 'Tortured Poets Department'\n\nThe CD version of Swift's 11th album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" contains a 24-page book jacket with new photos of the singer as well as two introductory poems that set the stage for the album.\n\nOne of those poems was written by none other than Stevie Nicks — who notably gets name-dropped in the 16th track, \"Clara Bow.\"\n\nNicks’ handwritten poem contains some key information at the very top that caught our eyes. “For T — and me...” is the dedication, suggesting that the message is for Swift and for Nicks herself. Swift’s favorite number 13 (which is also the date of her December birthday) is referenced twice: Aug. 13, 2023 (the date the poem was written) and Sept. 13 at 8:50 p.m. (could this be the precise time it was delivered?). Austin, Texas, is also listed as the location where it was written.\n\nNicks begins: “He was in love with her/ Or at least she thought so/ She was brokenhearted/ ~Maybe he was too~/ Neither of them knew.”\n\nNicks continues further down: “She brings joy/ He brings Shakespeare —/ It’s almost a tragedy — Says she’/ Don’t endanger me.” What’s most intriguing here is the repetition of the phrase “Don’t endanger me.” The words are also underlined, with the word “Pause” and an arrow pointing to them. Clearly, Nicks seemed to be emphasizing this particular line.\n\nThe poem continues: “She tells the truth/ She writes about it/ She’s an informer.” This could again allude to Swift’s transparency, and a history of sharing truths about her life and relationships through songwriting.\n\nIn a 2023 interview with TODAY.com, Nicks spoke about her friendship with Swift and the similarities in their approach to songwriting. “I never don’t tell the truth. And I think that’s something that if Taylor Swift, who is my friend, if Taylor got anything from me, that’s what she got,” she said. In the same interview, Nicks also said she thinks of her own writing as poems rather than songs.\n\nClick here for more.\n\nExplaining ‘thanK you aIMee’: Is this song about Kim Kardashian?\n\nThe Taylor Swift-Kim Kardashian-Kanye West feud that stems all the way back to 2009 is a piece of pop culture lore that just about everyone is familiar with by now. It seems Swift may not be over it though (after all, she did touch on it in her Time magazine story last year).\n\nA first observation about this new Swift song called \"thanK you aIMee\" is its stylization — the K and IM are capitalized, which of course spells KIM.\n\nNow let's look a bit closer at the song's lyrics. This is a song about a bully and rising up from the ashes. Some tidbits that could allude to the feud:\n\n\"I dreamed that one day I could say/ All that time you were throwing punches/ I was building something\"\n\n\"It wasn't a fair fight/ Or a clean Kill/ Each time that aIMee stomped across my grace/ And then she wrote headlines/ In the local paper laughing at each baby step I'd take\"\n\n\"I built a legacy that you can't undo/ But when I count the scars/ There's a moment of truth/ That there wouldn't be this/ If there hadn't been you\"\n\nWhat songs are on 'The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology'?\n\nSwift dropped an extra 15 \"TTPD\" songs as part of a surprise \"double album.\"\n\nWith the additional 15 songs, that brings the total number of tracks for this era to 31, her lucky No. 13 backward. It also makes the album her longest ever, edging out of “Red (Taylor’s Version)” by one song.\n\nHere's the full track list, including the new songs:\n\nFortnight (feat. Post Malone)\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nDown Bad\n\nSo Long, London\n\nBut Daddy I Love Him\n\nFresh Out the Slammer\n\nFlorida!!! (feat. Florence + The Machine)\n\nGuilty as Sin?\n\nWho’s Afraid of Little Old Me?\n\nI Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\n\nloml\n\n“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”\n\nThe Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\n\nThe Alchemy\n\nClara Bow\n\nThe Black Dog\n\nimgonnagetyouback\n\nThe Albatross\n\nChloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\n\nHow Did It End?\n\nSo High School\n\nI Hate It Here\n\nthanK you alMee\n\nI Look in People's Windows\n\nThe Prophecy\n\nCassandra\n\nPeter\n\nThe Bolter\n\nRobin\n\nThe Manuscript\n\nTaylor Swift releases the four exclusive bonus tracks on double album\n\nIn the lead-up to the \"Tortured Poets\" release date, Swift announced four editions of the album, each featuring a different bonus track.\n\nOriginally Swifties feared this would mean it'd be a minute before the bonus tracks would be available to stream. Then, a 2 a.m. surprise rolled around.\n\nSwift announced that \"Tortured Poets\" was a \"double album,\" and she released \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology,\" with 15 bonus songs, including the four bonus tracks: \"The Manuscript,\" \"The Bolter,\" \"The Albatross\" and \"The Black Dog.\"\n\nWho is Clara Bow?\n\nA nice name, “Clara Bow,” and the title of track 16 on \"Tortured Poets.\" It may ring a bell, particularly among Swifties’ older relatives. That’s because Bow was not just a real person — a movie actress who lived from 1905-1965 — but she also was the first true “It Girl.”\n\nShe was one of the first Hollywood sex symbols and celebrities, and received 35,000 letters per month at her peak, as biographer David Stenn, who wrote “Clara Bow: Runnin’ Wild” (2000) told TODAY.\n\n“We could not believe it,” Bow’s great-granddaughters, Nicole Sisneros and Brittany Grace Bells, told People magazine in February, when they learned of the track Swift would be releasing. “We were shocked and then the intrigue set in because no one from our family has been contacted or knew about this prior.”\n\nClearly, there’s something about Clara that has captured Swift’s imagination. But what?\n\n“If I were to hazard a guess, it’s because Clara Bow was both celebrated and condemned in the media in a way that male stars never were,” Stenn said. “I don’t think that double standard sadly, has left.”\n\nHe added: “Clara Bow experienced an unprecedented amount of both and endured and prevailed.”\n\nSound familiar? Well, let’s draw back our Bow and take aim at these facts about the “It Girl” of the past, who’s all the buzz nearly 120 years after she was born.\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\n‘The Alchemy’ lyrics meaning: Is the Taylor Swift song about Travis Kelce?\n\nWe have a play call from Taylor Swift: “Call the amateurs and cut them from the team!”\n\nThe second-to-last song on “The Tortured Poets Department,” “The Alchemy,” is one of the only pure love songs on an album that skews melancholy.\n\nThis is a story of a love that “happens once every few lifetimes,” Swift’s narrator sings. Alchemy refers to the quest in ancient and Medieval times to find a philosopher’s stone, which would make it possible to turn any substance, like lead, into gold.\n\nIn the context of relationships, like this song, alchemy could suggest the meeting of two people to form something wholly new, though something inexplicable (like, cough, love).\n\nBeyond medieval magic, what’s especially notable is that “The Alchemy” is replete with football imagery.\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nTaylor Swift has a message for 'The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived'\n\nContinuing the themes of rage and heartbreak throughout \"Tortured Poets,\" Swift's narrator calls out the subject of Track 14 for \"rusting my sparkling summer.\"\n\n\"I don't miss what we had, but could someone give / A message to the smallest man who ever lived?\" she sings.\n\n'Tortured Poets Department' is a 'secret double album'\n\nTaylor Swift shocked her fans early Friday morning by releasing a second half of her much-anticipated album “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\nAfter the first 16 songs were made available at midnight, a countdown appeared on her website indicating something else would be coming at 2 a.m. ET.\n\nShortly after 2 a.m., Swift announced that “Tortured Poets” is a “secret double album.”\n\n“I’d written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here’s the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn’t mine anymore… it’s all yours,” she captioned the announcement.\n\nFull story here!\n\nTrack 13: Taylor Swift makes having a 'broken heart' fun\n\nWith an upbeat tune reminiscent of \"Bejeweled\" and \"Karma\" from \"Midnights,\" Swift performs \"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart,\" seemingly referencing her time performing on the \"Eras Tour,\" which started in March 2023.\n\nWhile Swift's narrator is \"miserable, and no one even knows,\" she's also \"grinning like I'm winning\" and \"hitting my marks\" — \"'cause I can do it with a broken heart.\"\n\nWhat does 'loml' mean?\n\nIn what might be one of the saddest songs on the album, Swift's narrator sings about being told she's the love of someone's life \"about a million times.\"\n\nBut in a final twist, the song title's acronym actually means something else.\n\n\"You're the loss of my life,\" Swift sings.\n\nCan she fix him? 'No Really' She 'Can'\n\nTrack 11 asks a provocative question, again inspired by a modern dating colloquialism. To \"fix\" someone means getting a partner to address certain flaws for the sake of the relationship.\n\nThe song's narrator says the man is \"a perfect case for my certain skillset.\" In response to the people disapproving of her relationship, she says, \"I can fix him, no really I can / And only I can.\"\n\nTaylor Swift gets personal with 'Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?'\n\nWhile the title implies a cutesy tone with \"little old me,\" track 10 turns into a rage-filled rant.\n\nIn \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" Swift's narrator declares, \"You don't get to tell me about sad.\"\n\nThe song chronicles someone owning her status as something fearsome, answering the song title's question with, \"Well, you should be.\"\n\nTaylor Swift's official fan account teases lyrics that didn't make the standard version of the album\n\nFans were delighted to see lyrics from \"Tortured Poets\" teased at a Spotify pop-up in L.A. during release week.\n\nThere's just one problem.\n\nSwifties report not hearing those lyrics on the standard version of \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nTaylor Nation, the official fan account for Swift, responded to some of the questions from fans cryptically, noting, \"That's weird,\" adding a new hashtag, #TTPDBoardMeeting.\n\nAn upbeat question: 'Guilty as Sin?'\n\nThe upbeat backbeat of \"Guilty as Sin?\" feels almost out of place with another set of lyrics that inspired the heartbreak playlists Swift created: \"Am I allowed to cry?\"\n\nIn the song, Swift's narrator recalls fantasizing about a man \"without ever touching his skin.\"\n\n\"What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh only in my mind?,\" she sings, before later asking, \"How can I be guilty as sin?\"\n\nWith a seemingly similar theme to \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" Swift questions why she should care about what other people think, singing, \"They're gonna crucify me anyway.\"\n\n\"What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?\" she sings.\n\nTrack 8!!! 'Florida!!!'\n\nThe second track on \"Tortured Poets\" with a guest feature is \"Florida!!!\" with Florence + the Machine.\n\nThis album channels Florence Welch's vibe, with resounding instruments and the scream-like chorus of \"Florida.\" (We see why the exclamation points were important for the title!)\n\nThe theme of the song seemingly kicks in at the bridge with, \"I need to forget, so take me to / Florida.\"\n\nThe Sunshine State was also notably mentioned in track 1, \"Fortnight.\" Other similarities between the two songs include mentions of a \"cheating husband.\"\n\nJack Antonoff shares live reactions to 'Tortured Poets'\n\nJack Antonoff, Swift's longtime friend and collaborator, who wrote several songs on \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" shared some of his thoughts about the album on X shortly after it dropped at midnight.\n\nHe specifically shouted out \"Fresh Out The Slammer\" and \"Down Bad,\" two songs he produced.\n\nTrack 7: 'Fresh Out The Slammer'\n\nBased on the track title alone, people were reminded of the \"Reputation\" song \"Ready For It?\" more specifically the lyric, \"He can be my jailer / Burton to this Taylor.\" \"Reputation\" is widely suspected to be about Joe Alwyn.\n\nNow, Swift's narrator is \"fresh out the slammer.\" In the song, she \"did my time\" and is now at the \"starting line\" of what sounds like a new relationship.\n\n\"Fresh out the slammer, I know who / My first call will be to,\" Swift sings.\n\n‘But Daddy I Love Him’ lyrics: Does Taylor Swift’s song reference ‘The Little Mermaid’?\n\nWhen the track list to Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department“ dropped, fans zoomed in on the title of track six: “But Daddy I Love Him.”\n\nThe title appeared to be lifted from a line in “The Little Mermaid.” It’s what Ariel shouts at her domineering father, King Triton, while pleading to join Prince Eric, her human love: “Daddy, I love him!”\n\nAllie (Rachel McAdams) in “The Notebook” says a similar line while defending her relationship with a boy from the other side of the tracks: “Yes, daddy, I love him.“\n\nAre the song’s lyrics about Ariel or Allie? Not quite: They appear to be an allegory, though, about rejecting the need for approval, defying public expectation and following your heart.\n\nFrom the start, Swift’s narrator positions herself in an adversarial relationship to, well, everyone else: “I just learned these people only raise you just to cage you.” (This could potentially echo a lyric from 2020’s “This Is My Trying”: “They told me all of my cages were mental.”)\n\nHer defiance comes in the form of romantic freedom — and being loud about it.\n\nIn the song, Swift sings about a “dutiful daughter” being undone by a man who is her total opposite: “He was chaos, he was revelry.” The song echoes her romantic interest’s description in 2010’s “Mine,” in which she sings about a boy who “made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter.”\n\nThe chorus sounds like something audacious said just to provoke a reaction.\n\n“Screaming, “But daddy I love him! / I’m having his baby\" / No I’m not, but you should see your faces,” she sings.\n\nThe narrator continues to call out anyone who is telling her what to do — even if they take on a tone of trying to help. People have an issue with her relationship and try to intervene: “Soon enough the elders had convened down at the City Hall / ‘Stay away from her.’”\n\nHer response is merciless: “I’d rather burn my whole life down than listen to one more second of all this b----ing and moaning.”\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nTaylor Swift bids London 'so long'\n\nIn 2019, Taylor Swift released the upbeat pop song “London Boy.” Five years later, she’s saying “so long” to the city with her new song “So Long, London.”\n\nBoth “London Boy” and “So Long, London” are the fifth songs of their respective albums: “Lover” and “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\n“London Boy” was widely received as an ode to her then-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. She and the English actor split in the spring of 2023 after six years together.\n\nIn “So Long, London,” she appears to be saying goodbye to the city, and the relationship that put her there.\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nTaylor Swift is 'Down Bad'\n\nThe fourth track packs a punch. \"Down Bad\" is a colloquialism for having \"strong and usually unrequited feelings of attraction, desire, or infatuation,\" according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nIn the song, Swift's narrator crafts an extended metaphor of being \"beamed up\" into outer space and experiencing a \"cosmic love.\" But it doesn't last, leaving her \"down bad\" and \"crying at the gym.\"\n\nOther alien references include the lyrical phrase, \"encounters closer and closer,\" likely a tongue-in-cheek reference to 1977's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\"\n\nNext up — 'My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys'\n\nThe third track of \"Tortured Poets\" introduces a simple theme: The narrator compares herself to a toy, repeatedly destroyed by her \"boy.\"\n\nShe seemingly justifies the behavior by noting, \"You should've seen him / When he first got me.\"\n\nOther notable lyrics include a passing reference to playing with a Ken doll — fitting as the new album comes just days after \"Barbie\" star Ryan Gosling performed \"All Too Well\" on \"SNL,\" receiving praise from Swift herself.\n\nMysterious 2 a.m. countdown pops up on Taylor Swift's Instagram\n\nAs fans get their first listen of \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" a feature on Swift's Instagram has officially started a countdown to 2 a.m. ET.\n\n✌️✌️ We'll see you there!\n\nWho are Dylan Thomas and Patti Smith?\n\nIn \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" Taylor Swift fittingly references two famous poets: Dylan Thomas and Patti Smith.\n\nThomas was a 20th-century Welsh poet known for \"Do not go gentle into that good night.\" Smith, born less than 10 years before Thomas' death, is a singer-songwriter and poet associated with the punk rock movement.\n\nIn the chorus of the song, Swift sings, \"You're not Dylan Thomas / I'm not Patti Smith,\" but the reference isn't pointing to a romantic relationship. The key to their connection lies in the next line: \"This ain't the Chelsea Hotel.\"\n\nIn addition to albums like \"Horses,\" Smith is also known for her writing, including her 2010 memoir, \"Just Kids,\" which chronicles her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe in the summer of 1969, where they made a home at the Chelsea Hotel in New York.\n\nIn her memoir, Smith mentions Thomas and his influence on the space, as he spent his last few days there before he died at a hospital in New York in 1953.\n\nTaylor Swift says 'Tortured Poets' represents her 'saddest story'\n\nTaylor Swift announced the release of \"Tortured Poets\" with an Instagram post, calling the album \"an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time — one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.\"\n\nBut that story is finished, she wrote.\n\n\"This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it.\"\n\nTrack 2: The album's titular song, 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nContinuing with the elaborate metaphors set up in \"Fortnight,\" Swift introduces a new motif in track two of \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" In the opening lyrics she sings, \"You left your typewriter at my apartment / Straight from the Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nThe chorus follows Swift's narrator confronting the reality of a situation.\n\n\"You're not Dylan Thomas / I'm not Patti Smith / This ain't the Chelsea Hotel / We're modern idiots,\" she sings, referencing the famous poet and singer.\n\nThis song also features more *pointed* references, including name-dropping Charlie Puth, the singer of \"See You Again,\" as well as a \"Lucy\" and \"Jack.\" (More on that soon.)\n\nThe subject of \"The Tortured Poets Department\" isn't painted in the best light by the narrator, with lyrics like, \"Who's going to know you, if not me?\"\n\nBut Puth proves the winner: \"We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.\"\n\nFirst up: 'Fortnight'\n\n\"Tortured Poets\" opens with \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone.\n\nThe track, written by Swift and Jack Antonoff, has a medium tempo and chill synth backbeat. On the even, rhythmic chorus, Swift sounds almost ethereal, with a slight echo.\n\nThe lyrics seem to paint a portrait of a short-lived affair: \"I touched you for only a fortnight,\" she sings. Swift's narrator also describes herself as a \"good neighbor\" to the object of her affections, sung by Malone.\n\nIn the first chorus, Swift sings, \"Your wife waters flowers / I want to kill her.\" On the second go around, she says, \"My husband is cheating / I want to kill him.\"\n\nThe story ends with the narrators suggesting moving to Florida — a potential thematic connection to track 8 \"Florida!!!\"? — and buying a car.\n\n\"But it won't start up, 'til I touch, touch, touch you,\" the song ends.\n\n“Fortnight” is also the first time we hear one of the lyrics featured on the four alternate versions of the album: “I love you, it’s ruining my life.”\n\nShe's here! 'The Tortured Poets Department' is available to stream\n\nThe chairman (Taylor Swift) has officially called this meeting to order.\n\nFollow along as TODAY staff break down the 16 tracks on the standard version of \"Tortured Poets.\"\n\nWhy Taylor Swift fans are convinced ‘Tortured Poets’ will touch on Joe Alwyn split\n\nWithin minutes of the new album announcement back in February, fans took to social media to share theories about the album, ranging from the Easter eggs everyone missed to the title — and how it might connect to her ex boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, an actor.\n\nReports that Swift and Alwyn broke up started circulating in April 2023 after they first struck up a relationship in 2016.\n\nSince then, Swift’s entered into a highly publicized romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nThe theorizing about the inspiration behind “The Tortured Poets Department” only intensified after Swift released the song titles on Feb. 5. The track list alone suggests the album may be about a breakup, with songs like, “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)” and “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart.”\n\nSwift has previously said she won’t confirm what — or who — her songs are about. Rather than address her personal life in interviews, Swift weaves details into songs.\n\n“I don’t talk about my personal life in great detail. I write about it in my songs, and I feel like you can share enough about your life in your music to let people know what you’re going through,” Swift told Glamour in 2012.\n\nHere’s why fans think her upcoming 11th album will divulge details about her former relationship with Alwyn.\n\nThe ‘Tortured Poets Department’ timeline\n\nWhen Swift announced “The Tortured Poets Department,” she said the new album was a “secret” she had been keeping from fans for “the last two years.”\n\nTwo years before the Grammys in February 2022, Swift and Alwyn were still reportedly together, and the “Conversations with Friends” made a rare comment about their notoriously private relationship in an interview that April, telling the Guardian what it was like co-writing songs together.\n\n“It wasn’t like, ‘It’s 5 o’clock, it’s time to try and write a song together,’” he said. “It came about from messing around on a piano, and singing badly, then being overheard, and being, like, ‘Let’s see what happens if we get to the end of it together.’”\n\nBut the relationship might not have been all smooth sailing.\n\nConnections to ‘You’re Losing Me’\n\nIn addition to “Tortured Poets,” fans also suspected Swift sung about Alwyn in the “Midnights” vault track “You’re Losing Me,” which she released in May 2023. The song is a devastating look at the end of the relationship and came out just weeks after reports of her split with Alwyn.\n\nBut Swift’s collaborator, Jack Antonoff, later revealed on his Instagram story that the song was written in December 2021, significantly before reports of their breakup. This signaled to fans that the couple went through a rough patch before the release of “Midnights” and the song “Lavender Haze” in October 2022, a song about ignoring outside noise to protect the “real stuff,” as Swift sang.\n\n“This was 10 months after you’re losing me, The entire timeline has changed,” one fan wrote beside pics of Swift and Alwyn on a walk in 2022.\n\nWith “You’re Losing Me” having been written shortly before the window of time when “Tortured Poets” became a “secret” project, fans are doing the math: Swift’s split with Alwyn may have inspired more than just one track.\n\nRight after announcing the album’s alternative cover and bonus track during her Feb. 16 concert, Swift performed “You’re Losing Me” for the first time live, further connecting the two projects in fans’ minds.\n\n‘The Tortured Man Club’\n\nOne of the first connections to Alwyn fans made involves the new album’s title.\n\nAmid the announcement, X users resurfaced a December 2022 interview between Alwyn and Paul Mescal for Variety, in which the two revealed that they were part of a WhatsApp chat entitled the “The Tortured Man Club.” Actor Andrew Scott was the third member of the chat, they said.\n\n“It hasn’t had much use recently,” Alwyn said at the time, to which Mescal replied, “No, I feel like we’re less tortured now.”\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nWhat is a ‘fortnight’? Taylor Swift’s ‘Tortured Poets’ single sparks memes about the popular video game\n\nFortnight? Or Fortnite?\n\nThe name of the first track of \"The Tortured Poets Department\" sparked memes even before the album came out, mostly because the song and one of the most popular video games of the last few years are homophones.\n\nFortnite, a popular battle video game, first dropped in 2017. The multiplayer survival game reached the pop culture zeitgeist by 2020, inspiring the memorable kids dance craze of \"flossing.\"\n\nBut no, Swift is probably not singing about the video game on her new album \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" The spelling of the track's title suggests she's referring to a fortnight, or a unit of time for two weeks / 14 days. While the word has largely fallen out of fashion in the U.S., it's still used in Britain, according to Grammarist.com.\n\nClara Bow, is that you?\n\nIn the first look at her upcoming music video for \"Fortnight,\" Taylor Swift seems like she is on some kind of warpath.\n\nThe six-second clip opens with a typewriter writing out the phrase, \"I love you, it's ruining my life.\"\n\nThe rest of the clips are so fast, if you blink you'll miss them. But most scenes feature Swift in a rage, clad in some sort of full-length gown.\n\nAt one point, she stands in an office setting, in a black Victorian-style outfit as papers on fire land around her. In another scene, clad in a strapless white dress, she throws a chair through a window in an attempt to escape a clinical-looking room.\n\nOne close shot of Swift shows her shackled to a bed, with her eyebrows drawn on in thin lines. Fans were quick to note that the look is reminiscent of Hollywood starlet Clara Bow, who's name makes up the 16th track of the album.\n\nBranded Tinseltown's first true \"It Girl,\" Bow was a film actor who lived from 1905-1965. She got her start in silent films before transitioning to \"talkies\" and her look — bowed lips, doll-like face, thin eyebrows — became the look du jour of the 1920s.\n\nBut things weren't always easy for Bow, who became the target of much gossip and speculation over the years. For more on her life, click here.\n\n✌️hours to go!\n\nWhile we wait, we're trying to decipher all the \"two\" theories.\n\nTaylor Swift put some of her most romantic songs on a ‘heartbreak’ playlist ahead of 'Tortured Poets'\n\nAhead of the release of her highly anticipated 11th studio album “The Tortured Poets Department” on April 19, rather than drop a single from the record, Taylor Swift released five new playlists of her own songs instead.\n\nSwift’s playlists, with titles that refer to the cover art from special editions of “The Tortured Poets Department,” encompass the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.\n\nBut some of her choices sparked strong reactions from fans. For example, on her playlist about denial — or as Swift describes it, a phase of heartbreak that involves missing “red flags” — the singer included her romantic 2019 song, “Lover,” which is thought to be inspired by her ex, Joe Alwyn.\n\nRead on to learn more about each of Swift’s playlists, and some of the surprising songs included.\n\n‘I Love You, It’s Ruining My Life,’ or denial\n\nFor “I Love You, It’s Ruining My Life,” Swift explained, “This is a list of songs about getting so caught up in the idea of something that you have a hard time seeing the red flags, possibly resulting in moments of denial and maybe a little bit of delusion. Results may vary.”\n\nSongs from this playlist include “Snow on the Beach” and “Bejeweled” from “Midnights,” “Cruel Summer” and “False God” from “Lover,” “Style” and “Wildest Dreams” from “1989,” “Treacherous” from “Red,” and more. Two of the songs included, “Betty” and “Sweet Nothing,” were co-written by Alwyn under the pen name William Bowery.\n\n‘You Don’t Get to Tell Me About Sad,’ or anger\n\n“These songs all have one thing in common: I wrote them while feeling anger,” Swift explained. “Over the years, I’ve learned that anger can manifest itself in a lot of different ways, but the healthiest way that it manifests itself in my life is when I can write a song about it and then oftentimes, that helps me get past it.”\n\nAmong the songs on the playlist were“Vigilante S--t” and “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve” from “Midnights,” “Exile” and “Mad Woman” from “Folklore,” “Bad Blood” from “1989,” “Dear John” and “Better Than Revenge” from “Speak Now,” and “Tell Me Why” and “Forever & Always” from “Fearless.”\n\n‘Am I Allowed to Cry?,’ or bargaining\n\n“Times when you’re trying to make deals with yourself, or someone that you care about. You’re trying to make things better,” she explained. “You’re oftentimes feeling really desperate because oftentimes we have a gut intuition that tells us things are not going to go the way that we hope which makes us more desperate which makes us bargain more.”\n\nSwift included her songs “This Is Me Trying” and “Peace” from “Folklore,” “The Archer” and “Cornelia Street” from “Lover,” “Come Back…Be Here” from “Red,” and her feature on the song “Renegade” by Big Red Machine, a band composed of two of her collaborators, Aaron Dessner and Justin Vernon.\n\n‘Old Habits Die Screaming,’ or depression\n\nIn her playlist “Old Habits Die Screaming,” Swift said she wanted to take listeners through her songs that explore “the feelings of depression that often lace their way” through her music.\n\n“In times like these, I’ll write a song because I feel lonely or hopeless and writing a song feels like the only way to process that intensity of an emotion,” she explained. “And while these things are really, really hard to go through, I often feel like when I’m either listening to songs or writing songs that deal with this intensity of loss and helplessness, usually that’s in the phase where I’m close to getting past that feeling.”\n\nSwift included “Bigger Than the Whole Sky” from “Midnights,” “My Tears Ricochet” from “Folklore,” “Champagne Problems” and “Right Where You Left Me” from “Evermore,” “Nothing New” and “All Too Well” from “Red,” and “Last Kiss” from “Speak Now.”\n\nShe also included the vault track “You’re Losing Me,” released shortly after news of her split with Alwyn broke, which fans at the time said had some of “the saddest lyrics ever.”\n\n‘I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,’ or acceptance\n\nIn her final playlist, Swift explained that her “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” playlist brings songs where “we finally find acceptance and can start moving forward from loss or heartbreak.”\n\n“These songs represent making room for more good in your life,” she explained. “Making that choice because a lot of times when we lose things, we gain things too.”\n\nShe included the songs “Labyrinth” from “Midnights,” “August” and “Invisible String” from “Folklore,” “Happiness” and “Long Story Short” from “Evermore,” “This Love” and “Clean” from “1989,” “Begin Again” from “Red,” and “Breathe” from “Fearless.”\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nCan't stop calling it 'The Tortured Poets Society'? You're not alone\n\nShortly after Swift announced \"The Tortured Poets Department\" at the Grammys, music lovers confused it with the title of a throwback Hollywood movie starring the late Robin Williams.\n\nAfter Swift’s surprise announcement, Google searches for the 1989 drama “Dead Poets Society” skyrocketed 588%, according to NoDepositRewards.com, an online group that promotes casinos around the world.\n\nOther than both employing the word “poets” in their titles, the movie, which takes place at a fictional elite boarding school, and Swift’s album don’t appear to have much else in common.\n\nExcept ...\n\nThere’s the fact that “Dead Poets Society” was released in 1989, which is Swift's birth year and the title of one of her albums. And, of course, her new album could possibly feature songs exploring sorrow and heartbreak, topics the movie explored, too.\n\nCome to think of it, Williams’ character in the movie, an unorthodox English teacher named John Keating, inspires his young students to live by the Latin credo carpe diem, or “seize the day.” Didn’t Swift say kind of the same thing in her 2014 hit “Shake It Off”?\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nThe one album drop that Swifties can't stop 'clowning' over\n\nFans famously thought Swift's black-and-white profile picture change and her 2024 Grammys outfit predicted news of \"Reputation.\"\n\nFeb. 4 came after months of hints that seemed to point towards the rerecording, from a slew of green outfits reminiscent of a snake, the album’s signature motif, to a tweet filled with capital S’s tied to her Time Person of the Year interview. Plus, fans have already heard snippets of the “Taylor’s Version” “Look What You Made Me Do” and “Delicate” tracks.\n\nIt seemed like every few weeks fans predicted a new date for the anticipated rerecording, including Nov. 10, Nov. 26, Dec. 13 and of course, Feb. 4, the date of the Grammys.\n\nThe official X account for the Empire State Building even fell for it at one point.\n\nInstead, Swift announced \"Tortured Poets,\" a brand new album.\n\nStill, just hours before the new album arrives, fans are holding out for a \"Reputation\" surprise.\n\nSimilar to (incorrect) theories surrounding the October 2023 release of \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" fans think \"Tortured Poets\" could be a \"double album\" drop, meaning the singer would release a second surprise tied to \"Tortured Poets.\"\n\nSome have even assembled theories that the \"Reputation\" rerecording could be involved. The reveal of the Apple Music puzzle result — \"We hereby conduct this post mortem\" — immediately reminded Swifties of the imagery surrounding \"Reputation\" in 2017, specifically a line from a poem associated with the album: \"And in the death of her reputation / She felt truly alive.\"\n\nOne user found \"REP\" like part of a word search in one of Swift's Instagram posts.\n\n\"im not trying to be ungrateful im just delusional but i think dropping reputation taylor’s version together with the tortured poets department would be kinda perfect because they’re two bookends of the same relationship,\" one fan wrote on X, pointing out that while \"Reputation\" is thought to be about Joe Alwyn, \"Tortured Poets\" is thought to be about their split.\n\nBut some Swifties are tired of the \"Reputation\" speculation. The months of failed predictions have led the \"theorizing\" to be re-classified as \"clowning.\"\n\nFlashback: All the hidden references to 'Tortured Poets' from Taylor Swift's Grammys outfit\n\nThe red herring that started it at all.\n\nWhen Taylor Swift arrived to the Grammys Feb. 4 dressed in black and white, fans were convinced that an announcement regarding her \"Reputation\" rerecording was imminent.\n\nSwift arrived to the 2024 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in a stunning strapless white gown, with black elbow-high gloves.\n\nThe stark tones of her Grammys look, combined with the new black-and-white tint to her profile pictures online, fueled theories that Swift’s next major announcement will center on the rerecording of her sixth studio album.\n\nThe original album art for “Reputation” featured the singer in black-and-white with print covering the side of her face, almost like a newspaper.\n\nSwift’s acceptance speech for her 13th Grammy Awards complicated that theory, however: She revealed a new album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” was on the way. This album cover is also black and white, like “Reputation.”\n\nThe outfit now reveals the aesthetic of the album, later confirmed through the official cover art.\n\nSensuous, luxurious and almost old-Hollywood style — fitting for the final track \"Clara Bow\" — captures the vibe of \"Tortured Poets.\"\n\nThe music video teaser for \"Fortnight\" also revealed Swift in a white dress with a similar silhouette to the one she wore on Grammys night.\n\nClick here for the full article.\n\nMerch drop! Taylor Swift releases official 'Tortured Poets' jackets, jewelry and more\n\nTaylor Swift's official fan account, Taylor Nation, announced official \"Tortured Poets Department\" merchandise around 8 p.m. ET, less than four hours before the album's release.\n\nProducts include hoodies, sweatpants, earrings, a choker necklace and more.\n\nA black jacket with \"All's fair in love and poetry\" along the back as well as \"Tortured Poets Department\" jacket sold out in less than 30 minutes.\n\nTaylor Nation dubbed the attire, \"Department-issued uniforms and matching accessories.\"\n\nTaylor Swift reveals first look at upcoming music video for 'Fortnight'\n\nTaylor Swift is revealing a first look at her upcoming music video for \"Fortnight\" off her new album. The song will debut on her \"Tortured Poets Department\" album in just under four hours.\n\nIn a post shared Thursday night, a video shows snippets in black-and-white from the music video, which drops Friday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n\"At this hearing, I stand before my fellow members of The Tortured Poets Department with a summary of my findings,\" she captioned the post. \"Album tonight. Fortnight music video tomorrow at 8pm et.\"\n\nWhat Travis Kelce has said about 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nWhile Travis Kelce, football superstar and boyfriend of Taylor Swift, isn't expected to be the inspiration behind her next album \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" the tight end has previously commented on it.\n\nAhead of Super Bowl 58 in Las Vegas, which his team went on to win in overtime, Kelce told reporters that he had already listened to part of the album.\n\n“I have heard some of it. It is unbelievable,” Kelce said, per Variety. “I can’t wait for her to shake up the world when it finally drops.”\n\nKelce and Swift first sparked dating rumors in July 2023, after he talked about attending one of her \"Eras Tour\" shows on his podcast. Her first appearance at a Chiefs game in September 2023 came nearly five months after reports of Swift's split with Alwyn broke in April 2023.\n\nClick here for a refresher on the timeline of Kelce and Swift's relationship.\n\n'The Tortured Poets Department' already broke a record — more than 12 hours before its release\n\nSwift's 11th studio album became the most pre-saved album on Spotify Thursday, the streaming platform announced around 11:15 a.m. — 12 hours before the album drops at midnight.\n\nThe countdown page lists all the tracks on the standard version of the album. By pre-saving, the album is automatically added to a user's library once the album becomes available to stream.\n\nAll the ‘Tortured Poets’ lyrics Taylor Swift has already released\n\nAfter Swift announced her new album while winning her 13th Grammy, her social media accounts also shared the news.\n\n“And so I enter into evidence my tarnished coat of arms/ My muses, acquired like bruises, my talismans and charms/ The tick, tick, tick of love bombs/ My veins of pitch black ink/ All’s fair in love and poetry…” the post read, signed \"The Chairman of The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nThen, during the solar eclipse on April 8, Swift shared a video of an old-fashioned typewriter typing out the following phrase:\n\nCrowd goes wild at her fingertips, half moonshine, full eclipse\n\nSwift would go on to announce that Target will carry special vinyl variants of the album on April 14 with another post to her Instagram, writing what appeared to be more lyrics in the caption: “I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all.”\n\nThen, as part of a Spotify pop-up event in Los Angeles, several more lines were revealed starting on April 16:\n\nEven statues crumble if they’re made to wait\n\nOne less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen\n\nAs she was leaving, it felt like breathing\n\nLost the game of chance, what are the chances?\n\nCome one, come all / it’s happening again\n\nWhat’s the Taylor Swift ‘two theory’ — and could it mean a second album is coming?\n\nAnyone who knows Taylor Swift also knows that she loves an important message that's hidden in plain sight. Easter eggs, one could call them, or clues or signs.\n\nFans of Swift believe they've detected a new clue that could indicate something important: A pattern of Swift plotting the number two everywhere as of late.\n\nAllow this Swiftie TikToker to break it down for you:\n\nHere's a recap of where we've seen twos:\n\n- When Swift revealed at the Grammys she’s releasing “TTPD,” she said she had been working on the album for two years and held up two fingers. (Review the video here.)\n\n- The “TTPD” logo looks like a Roman numeral II.\n\n- In an animated video released by Swift this week teasing her upcoming music video, a clock is seen on a wall set to 2:00.\n\n- In a pop-up Spotify installation in Los Angeles promoting \"TTPD,\" fans spotted a few two references: there's a statue of a hand holding up two fingers and there are clocks also set to 2:00. (See more Easter eggs from this pop-up in the blog post below.)\n\nAnd, on Wednesday, Swift tweeted on X, \"✌️ days til THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT.\"\n\nSo what could all this mean? Swifties on TikTok have some theories: Could Swift be releasing a double album or a doing a two-album drop? (\"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" anyone?) Or could this indicate a second act coming to \"The Eras Tour\"? After all, one would expect \"TTPD\" to be incorporated into the tour somehow, especially considering \"The Eras Tour\" as we know it has been memorialized with a concert film that's now streaming.\n\nThe possibilities behind the \"two theory\" are quite endless — but keep an eye on those twos.\n\nAll the Easter eggs from the 'Tortured Poets' Spotify pop-up in LA\n\nTaylor Swift has been revealing more lyrics from her upcoming album at a Spotify pop-up in Los Angeles.\n\nHeld at The Grove, an outdoor shopping mall, a library-like display will continue to unveil more stanzas featured in the upcoming album.\n\nHere are the lyrics we’ve seen so far at the display:\n\nCrowd goes wild at her fingertips, half moonshine, full eclipse\n\nEven statues crumble if they’re made to wait\n\nOne less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen\n\nAs she was leaving, it felt like breathing\n\nLost the game of chance, what are the chances?\n\nCome one, come all / it's happening again\n\nIn addition to the lyrics being revealed from an old-fashioned book, the decor from the “library” is also believed to hold many more clues, fans believe.\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up and synthesized some of the fan theories.\n\nCard Catalog\n\nBack in ye olden days before everything was online, we used to look up books in the library by using the physical card catalog.\n\nThe Spotify display includes one such dresser, with 72 drawers total and six of them open with flowers and lace spilling out.\n\nFans have suggested that the open six drawers represent the six years Swift spent with her ex, actor Joe Alwyn, and the total of 72 represents the total months they spent together.\n\nOther fans (disclaimer: some of whom did not initially seem to know what card catalog is) postulated that the display also reminded them of a mausoleum and that the album is a post-mortem of Swift and Alwyn’s relationship.\n\nGlobes\n\nThere were a few globes on display in the pop-up, all with Miami, Florida, marked by a pin or in one instance, a nail.\n\nAs we know, there is a song titled “Florida!!!” on the album. There are fan rumors that something happened in Florida, so we’ll have to wait and see what the lyrics reveal.\n\nTypewriters\n\nThere are a few typewriters in the scene — matching the aesthetic of the album— including one that is labeled No. 3. The paper in the No. 3 typewriter is the track list, leading some Swifties to think that the label means that the third song of “TPD” —“My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys” — will be the first single.\n\nSome fans have pointed out that the T and B keys seem to be slightly off or askew on a few of the typewriters.\n\nCages\n\nFor the birdcage, some fans speculated it might be a metaphor for how Swift felt in her previous relationship but one particularly interesting theory comes from @FolklorianAna on X.\n\n“I’m sure that Taylor (Swift) has read ‘A Doll’s House’ by Henrik Ibsen and used it as a huge inspiration for TTPD,” she posted. “This play portrays a woman who cares for her husband but feels like she’s in a cage (the cages on Spotify library). Her husband also calls her constantly ‘Little Skylark.’”\n\nThere is also a statue of birds resting on a tree branch featured in the display.\n\nClocks\n\nAll the clocks point to 2:00 — it’s unclear exactly what is happening but we personally are rooting for it to be something at 2 p.m. and not 2 a.m.\n\nWe should mention that in the video she released earlier this week, there was a yellow clock seemingly set in the “Midnights” album universe that also said 2:00.\n\nDried/dead flowers\n\nThere are loads of dried flowers in the display, which fans have noted include lavender — a reference to “Lavender Haze” from “Midnights” which Swift has previously alluded to being about Alwyn in a now-deleted video.\n\nFans have also speculated that the flowers include dried Cornelia roses — truthfully, our knowledge of plants is limited and we didn’t take a close-up photo of the flowers for later analysis but that does feel right.\n\nSwift’s song “Cornelia Street” from her 2019 album, “Lover.” That album is widely believed to be about Alwyn in general, and the song is about the beginning of a relationship and falling in love.\n\nAnother fan, @giftedswifted, wrote they spotted daisies and poppies in the display underneath the book.\n\nSwift wrote in “Don’t Blame Me” on her 2017 album “Reputation” that “I once was poison ivy, but now I’m your daisy.”\n\nThe poppy reference could be from her 2022 album “Midnights” in the song “The Great War.”\n\n“Say a solemn prayer, plant a poppy in my hair,” she sings in a song clearly about a breakup using war as a metaphor.\n\nLace\n\nOn a related note, there is a ton of lace all around the display, which many fans have speculated is tied to how Swift and Alwyn did not get married despite being together for the aforementioned six years.\n\nPuzzles\n\nIn jars on the shelves, there are puzzle pieces. Some fans have said that the pieces are from The Lines puzzle, a known difficult puzzle to solve.\n\nThis could just be a meta puzzle moment — Swift literally had us at the mall on a Tuesday morning looking for easter eggs in a display and fans around the globe doing different but similar investigations — or it could be something more.\n\nTambourines\n\nThere are literally just a bunch of tambourines throughout the display. We didn’t have any great theories on this but one fan online, @BlankSpaceProd, has postulated that the tambourines have something to do with feat. Florence + The Machine, who is featured on “Florida!!!”\n\nDecember 13\n\nOne of the dates featured in the display is Friday, Dec. 13. Some fans have pointed out that Swift’s birthday is on Dec. 13 but she was born on a Wednesday. This year’s Dec. 13, Swift’s 35th birthday, is on a Friday, so it’s probably safe to assume the calendar is referencing is 2024.\n\n(Another date keeper featured in the display says April 19, which is probably a reference to the date the album drops. Famous last words, though, right?)\n\n“The Story of Us”\n\nThere is a (seemingly blank) notebook on a shelf with the handwritten letters “US” in what appears to be black pen scribbled on the front. Some fans have suggested that this is a reference to “The Story of Us” (Taylor’s Version) from her album “Speak Now.”\n\nThe books\n\nObviously, a library has to have books and many of them feature the titles of Swift’s songs on them.\n\nThe fan account @TSwiftErasTour noted that the book for “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” from the upcoming album seems to have scribbled handwriting all over it. Another book — one that looks “disgusting” as @TSwiftErasTour pointed out — seems to have “Saint” embossed on the side.\n\nPeace sign\n\nThere is a statue of a hand forming the peace sign or the number two on one of the shelves. Swift made the same gesture as she announced her new album after winning her 13th Grammy on Feb. 4.\n\nSwift’s main X account also used the peace hand symbol to mean two on April 17.\n\nStatues\n\nThere are white busts featured in the display, including one that seems to be Diana (Artemis) of Ephesus, the goddess of childbirth, fertility and the moon.\n\nOne viral tweet from @vigilantesht claims that the “original statue of Diana crumbled while waiting to be shipped to London in the 6th century due to years of neglect, succumbing to the passage of time and the elements.”\n\nTODAY.com has not been able to verify this theory and there are many surviving statues of Diana/Artemis that look similar to the bust featured in the Spotify display.\n\nQuestionable theories\n\nBecause the display is in person in Los Angeles, most Swifties are getting their information about the pop-up online from people’s photos and videos.\n\nSome fans have said that there is a bullet in the display but based on our analysis and experience, what fans perceived to be a bullet is actually just a fountain pen cap.\n\nWhat was the final message in Apple Music’s ‘TTPD’ puzzle?\n\nStarting earlier this week, Apple Music had debuted a game for Swifties: It put together a scavenger hunt of words hidden within lyrics stored in Swift's songs on Apple Music.\n\nOn Day 1, capitalized letters spelling out \"HEREBY\" were found in the track \"Glitch.\" The same pattern continued in the following five days.\n\nDay 2: \"CONDUCT\" was found in \"Peace.\"\n\nDay 3: \"THIS\" was found in \"Better Than Revenge.\"\n\nDay 4: \"POST\" was found in \"Clean.\"\n\nDay 5: \"WE\" was found in \"We Were Happy.\"\n\nDay 6: \"MORTEM\" was found in \"Begin Again.\"\n\nWhen unscrambled, the final message reads, \"We hereby conduct this post mortem.\" If you're wondering what that means, we are too.\n\nSo what's the deal with the ‘TTPD’ QR codes left in cities around the world?\n\nA mysterious mural with a QR code and “Tortured Poets” text first cropped up in Chicago earlier this week, and later similar ones erected in other major cities around the globe, including Paris, Melbourne and Sāo Paolo.\n\nWhen the mural in Chicago initially appeared, the QR code led to a YouTube short with animated typewriter text that said \"Error 321.\" That QR code now leads to a clip of a typewriter printing the letter T. The QR codes left in other cities lead to similar clips providing a different letter.\n\nThese letters had to be a message from Swift left for fans to unscramble, right? Right! Swifties on social media were able to decode the letters — which ended up spelling out \"for a fortnight.\"\n\nAs we now know, \"Fortnight,\" a track off \"TTPD\" featuring Post Malone, is the album's first single, Swift shared Thursday afternoon. She revealed the news at taylorswift.com/forafortnight.\n\nA guide to listening to ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ when it drops\n\nTaylor Nation earlier this morning released what it called a \"listening agenda\" for \"TTPD,\" staying within the theme of manuscripts.\n\nIt's a page of paper that tells readers about a \"board meeting\" happening at 12 a.m. and to consult your \"tortured muse\" before attending. It lists the album's tracks as topics of discussion, followed by directions to bring a listening device, snacks, a uniform and a dictionary. Cute!\n\n'The Tortured Poets Department' has four bonus tracks. How to listen\n\nThe day after Taylor Swift announced her 11th album at the Grammy Awards, she shared a first look at the track list and introduced the first special edition, subtitled \"The Manuscript.\"\n\nShe went on the announce four total exclusive editions of the album available in CD or vinyl, each featuring a different bonus track. While vinyl versions of each variant were available for a limited time, currently all four special editions in CD form are available for pre-order at Target.\n\nHere's a guide to all the variants of \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and all the bonus tracks:\n\n‘The Manuscript’\n\nThe edition of the album was first announced Feb. 5. The cover art features Swift looking forlorn and features the text, \"I Love You, It's Ruining My Life.\" This text is also the name of the first of Swift's \"five stages of heartbreak\" playlist, released through Apple Music on April 5.\n\nThis edition features a bonus track called \"The Manuscript.\" You can listen to the track by purchasing a vinyl or CD, available for pre-order at Target or on Swift's official online store.\n\n'The Bolter'\n\nSwift announced \"The Bolter\" edition of \"Tortured Poets\" in Melbourne Feb. 16. The alternate cover features a new photo of Swift and the text, \"You Don't Get to Tell Me About Sad.\"\n\nThe album's exclusive song, \"The Bolter,\" can be heard on an exclusive CD version of the album, available for pre-order at Target.\n\n'The Albatross'\n\nSwift announced \"The Albatross,\" another variant of the album, on Feb. 23 during her \"Eras Tour\" show in Sydney. This version features a photo of Swift looking down with the text, \"Am I Allowed To Cry?\"\n\nThis version, with the bonus track \"The Albatross,\" is available as an exclusive CD for pre-order at Target.\n\n'The Black Dog'\n\nSwift announced her fourth and final special edition, \"The Black Dog,\" on March 3 in Singapore. This album cover's subtitle reads, \"Old Habits Die Screaming.\"\n\nThe bonus track \"The Black Dog\" can be heard on an exclusive CD available for pre-order at Target.\n\n'The Tortured Poets Department' track list, including song lengths\n\nThe standard version of \"The Tortured Poets Department\" album will have 16 songs.\n\nHere's the track list, along with the length of each song, according to Spotify:\n\n\"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone — 3:48\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" — 4:53\n\n\"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\" — 3:23\n\n\"Down Bad\" — 4:21\n\n\"So Long, London\" — 4:22\n\n\"But Daddy I Love Him\" — 5:40\n\n\"Fresh Out The Slammer\" — 3:30\n\n\"Florida!!!,\" featuring Florence + The Machine — 3:35\n\n\"Guilty as Sin?\" — 4:14\n\n\"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" — 5:34\n\n\"I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\" — 2:36\n\n\"loml\" — 4:37\n\n\"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" — 3:38\n\n\"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" — 4:05\n\n\"The Alchemy\" — 3:16\n\n\"Clara Bow\" — 3:36\n\nBut this is Taylor Swift we're talking about. Of course there are bonus tracks. Various special editions of “TTPD” will have bonus songs called “The Manuscript,” “The Bolter,” “The Albatross” and “The Black Dog.”\n\nThe one thing Beyoncé’s and Taylor Swift’s 2024 albums have in common: Post Malone\n\nHip-hop star Post Malone, known for his 2018 hit \"Rockstar,\" is having a big year. His latest album, \"Austin,\" dropped in July 2023, but the rapper is featured on what might be two of the biggest albums of the year.\n\nPost Malone was featured on Beyoncé's \"Cowboy Carter\" album, which came out March 29. The rapper crooned a sweet duet with Beyoncé called \"Levii's Jeans.\"\n\nThen, he's set to be featured on \"Fortnight,\" the opening track of \"Tortured Poets\" that's also going to be the album's lead single.\n\nDid ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ album leak?\n\nSince Taylor Swift announced her 11th album and shared the track list, alleged \"leaked\" versions of the tracks have popped up on social media — but most fans chalked it up to the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nAn alleged leak of \"Fortnight,\" the first track on the album featuring Post Malone, cropped up on TikTok as early as Feb. 15, just 10 days after she released the track list. The upbeat version with the lyrics seemingly sung by Swift, \"Never made it clear, never made it right/ I've been waiting here going on a fortnight,\" is believed by fans to be created through AI.\n\nAI music generators allow users to select a genre, mood, theme and existing song inspirations to create a song.\n\nSome purported \"leaked\" versions of tracks from \"Tortured Poets\" were later debunked to be existing songs overlaid with an AI voice generator made to sound like Swift. For example, one alleged leak of \"loml\" was actually the lyrics and tune of \"Homemade Dynamite\" by Lorde.\n\nBut murmurings of a leak picked up April 17, ahead of the album's drop at midnight on April 19. Online, largely anonymous users running fan accounts shared screenshots purporting to have the song files, some of which seemingly landed on X. Many Swifties rallied online to against those leaks.\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to reps for Swift for comment.\n\nUsers were unable to search \"Taylor Swift leak\" on X by Wednesday afternoon. Typing the query into the search bar yielded a \"Something went wrong. Try reloading\" result. This was the same result that users got when they tried to search Swift's name around Jan. 27, shortly after explicit deepfakes of Swift went viral.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time one of Swift's albums have leaked online. Variety reported that, in 2014, Swift's fifth studio album, \"1989,\" leaked three days before it was set to come out.\n\nT-minus 10 hours until ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ releases — and Swift reveals her first single\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" will officially drop in 10 hours, at 12 a.m. ET on April 19 and 9 p.m. PT on April 18.\n\nThe album will be available to stream on Spotify here and on Apple Music here. You can also learn ways to buy physical copies here.\n\nSwift, meanwhile, had put a clock on taylorswift.com/forafortnight counting down to *something* happening at 2 p.m. ET. It turned out to be a link to preorder a CD for the album’s lead single, “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone.\n\nSwift earlier in the week released a video teasing her first music video off “TTPD,” which is presumably “Fortnight.” It drops at 8 p.m. ET on April 19."
