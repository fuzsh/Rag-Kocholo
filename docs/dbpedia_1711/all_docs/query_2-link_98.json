        "text": "As They Sleep delivers brutally heavy and savagely technical death metal of the highest order, crafting songs that put all pretenders to shame with memorable riffs and blasting disharmony. Dynasty, the band's second album and Solid State debut, proves exactly why they were chosen as \"The Next Great Metal Band\" in a 2009 contest presented by Metal Blade & Metal Hammer. At a time when many so called \"metal\" bands are absent any true knowledge about or dedication to the genre's roots, this fearsome fivesome shares more in common with contemporaries like Despised Icon and fellow Michigan metal mavens Black Dahlia Murder than anything \"fashionable\" or trendy. Presented with pulverizing precision, Dynasty was mixed by Jason Suecoff (All That Remains, DevilDriver, Demon Hunter). Tracks like \"Bedlam at the Nile\" and \"To the Republic\" are driven by the fire of true heavy metal which burns deep inside As They Sleep."
