        "text": "Leon is the highly anticipated fourth album from Grammy Award-winning recording artist, songwriter, and performer Leon Bridges. With 13 tracks featuring Leons signature storytelling and a unique blend of organic genre alchemy, Leon is his most poignant, powerful, and personal work to date. He takes fans on a trip through the heart of Ft. Worth he knows best, the things he holds dear, and the people and places that shaped him. Featuring production by Ian Fitchuk (Beyonce, Noah Kahan), Daniel Tashian (Kacey Musgraves), and Tyler Johnson (Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus), Leon describes the album as somewhat of a self-portrait I'm excited to share these stories about my home, about nostalgia, about my upbringing, about where I'm from, with all of you. I hope this music brings you back to your roots and your journey.\n\nTESTAMENT is an undisputed titan of thrash metal. One of the definitive acts of the historic and high-octane genre since they first emerged from the San Francisco Bay Area in 1983, the modern icons established themselves with a series of classic records (released each year from 1987 through 1990). They never wavered creatively, unleashing one acclaimed album after another across four decades.\n\nOriginally released in 1989, Practice What You Preach is the third album from TESTAMENT. Guitar World recognized the album as one of the Top 10 Shred Albums of the Eighties.\n\n5 Seconds of Summer - 5 Seconds of Summer (10th Anniversary Edition) - Red Vinyl LP\n\nOriginally known via their YouTube chart covers, Australian band, 5 Seconds of Summer rose to international fame while touring with One Direction on their Take Me Home Tour. They became the breakthrough story of 2014 in what would be a momentous year for the band. That year produced four multimillion-selling singles, including \"She Looks So Perfect,\" which would top the singles chart in the UK, \"Don't Stop,\" \"Good Girls\" and \"Amnesia.\" Their self-titled debut album topped charts around the world, becoming the biggest US debut album of the year and the biggest US debut by an Australian artist ever.\n\n10th Anniversary Edition LP on red vinyl featuring alternate front cover sleeve and 2 bonus tracks: \"Lost Boy\" and \"Mrs All American.\" These tracks were only available on the Australian and American versions of 5 Seconds Of Summer, respectively. Limited\n\nThis is a first time color vinyl pressing of the anticipated follow up to the Grammy® Award-winning 2009 release Townes titled, I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive . This 11-track set was produced by T-Bone Burnett and was Earle's first collection of original material since his 2007 Grammy® Award-winning album, Washington Square Serenade. The album includes the celebrated song\" This City,\" written for the HBO Original Series, TREMÉ, which Earle also appeared in as an actor. \"This City\" features horn arrangements by Allen Toussaint and has garnered a Grammy® Award Nomination in the Best Song Written for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Category. Other highlights include the ballad \"Every Part of Me\" and the ode to those who make their living on The Gulf Of Mexico.\n\nIn 1976, KISS dropped the bombshell on the world being DESTROYER, an album that originally received resistance from fans due to the band exploring a new sound and has long become the quintessential and all-time best selling KISS studio album.\n\nExploding with concert staples and KISS Army favorites like Detroit Rock City, Shout It OutLoud, and God Of Thunder  the albums new sounds came from the softer side of songs like Do You Love Me?,and songs heavy with orchestral arrangements including Great Expectations and their surprise hit single Beth.\n\nFor the 45th anniversary, UMe is releasing the most comprehensive Super Deluxe Edition 4CD + Blu-ray Audio boxset that will melt the KISS Armys minds. The original album on CD 1 is newly remastered by Abbey Road Mastering, CD 2 features 15 demos from Paul Stanleys and Gene Simmonss personal archives  9 of which are unreleased. CD 3 loads up with studio outtakes, alternate versions / mixes and single edits  most notably a brand-new stripped-down mix for Beth (Acoustic Mix) where we found the acoustic guitar stems recorded for the entire song but originally only used in the last several closing notes of the song on the album. CD 4 features a ripping performance from the bands visit to Paris France at the LOlympia on May 22, 1976.\n\nSteven Wilson was brought in to create a first-ever Dolby Atmos and 5.1 surround mix of the original studio album plus 2 bonus tracks Beth (Acoustic Mix) and Sweet Pain (Original Guitar Solo) the latter featuring Ace Frehleys original recorded guitar solo that was not released on the studio album (this track is available on the 2012 Destroyer: Resurrected project.)\n\nPackaging features a lift top-style box loaded with so much ephemera even KISS fans may need to seek medical advice upon receiving this boxset\n\nFew artists are storytellers as deft and disarmingly observational as Andy Shauf. The Toronto-based, Saskatchewan-raised musicians songs unfold like short fiction: theyre densely layered with colorful characters and a rich emotional depth. Like hes done throughout his career, Shauf wrote, performed, arranged, and produced every song on his new album Wilds at his studio space in the west end of Toronto.\n\nOver the course of a year-and-a-half, Shauf had written more than 50 songs, and pared down this massive body of work, into a single albums worth of material, which became 2020s highly acclaimed The Neon Skyline album. These songs focused on a theme by intertwining the individual characters stories of a group of friends who gathered for one night at the same local bar. Wilds includes songs from those same writing sessions, that did not fit into the Skyline storyline and had their own singular identity apart from that album, though he does revisit with his old friends Judy and Jeremy in this outing.\n\nSteve Earle was nineteen and had just hitchhiked from San Antonio to Nashville in 1974. Back then if you wanted to be where the best songwriters were you had to be in there. Guy Clark had moved to Nashville and if you were from Texas, Guy Clark was king. Flash forward more than forty years. In the fall of 2018, Steve and The Dukes went into House Of Blues studio in Nashville and recorded GUY in six days. 'I wanted it to sound live...When you've got a catalog like Guy's and you're only doing sixteen tracks, you know each one is going to be strong.'\n\nEarle and his current, perhaps best-ever Dukes lineup, take on these songs with a spirit of reverent glee and invention. But in the end Guy leads the listener back to its beginning, namely Guy Clark, which is what any good 'tribute' should do. Guy is a saga of friendship, its ups and downs, what endures. We are lucky that Earle remembers and honors these things, because like old friends, Guy is a diamond.\n\nHand Habits, the project of Los Angeles-based musician Meg Duffy (they/them), is back with their new album Fun House - the most ambitious Hand Habits album to date. Produced by Sasami Ashworth (SASAMI) and engineered by Kyle Thomas (King Tuff), the record was not intended as a reaction to the pandemic, but it was very much the result of taking a difficult, if much-needed, moment of pause. Emboldened by going into therapy and coaxed by Ashworth to push the songs into unexpected new shapes, the resulting music is more acutely personal and stylistically adventurous than anything youve heard from Hand Habits before. The push/pull of styles, paired with songs that move deftly between the present and past, give the record a wildly diverse, hall of mirrors quality that befits its name. Where previous Hand Habits records could be fairly insular affairs, Fun House feels ebullient, lush, a fully-realized conversation."
