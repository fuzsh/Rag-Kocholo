        "text": "Hozier - âToo Sweetâ\n\nLabel: Rubyworks Records/Columbia\n\nRelease Date: March 22, 2024\n\nAlbum: Unheard EP\n\nProducers: Andrew Hozier-Byrne, Bekon, Chakra, Pete G & Sergui Gherman\n\nSongwriters: Daniel Tannenbaum, Andrew Hozier-Byrne, Daniel Krieger, Peter Gonzales, Sergiu Gherman, Stuart Johnson & Tyler Mehlenbacher\n\nHozier recently gifted fans with four tracks that didn't make it onto his acclaimed 2023 release, Unreal Unearth, compiling them into an EP he's dubbed Unheard.\n\nIn a post on social media, the artist described the unreleased tracks, writing; \"These are songs that mightâve made it to the circles of gluttony, limbo, violence and the outward âascentâ respectively but could not for different reasons.\n\n'Empire Now', 'Fare Well' and the Allison Russell collaboration, 'Wildflower and Barleyâ, make up the mini-release, as well as one absolute banger, 'Too Sweet'.\n\n'Too Sweet' is anything but.\n\nComing alive with a singeing bass line and hot beat, the song sounds sensual, insatiable and a little bit dingy in the best ways. It's barrooms and smoke, neon and nightlife, as the creeping tune builds into an intoxicating gospel.\n\nHozier's vocals shine against the starkness, his harmonies all at once soothing and scorching.\n\n\"It canât be said Iâm an early bird\n\nItâs ten oâclock before I say a word\n\nBaby, I can never tell\n\nHow do you sleep so well\n\nYou keep telling me to live right\n\nTo go to bed before daylight\n\nBut then you wake up for the sunrise\n\nYou know you donât gotta pretend\n\nBaby, now and then\"\n\nIn the opening lines, listeners are introduced to two people at odds. One is a night-owl, an all-nighter and a late riser.\n\nThe other appears to pride a more structured lifestyle, waking up before sunrise and urging their partner to live much the same way. But Hozier sings, \"Baby, now and then...\"\n\nDonât you just wanna wake up\n\nDark as a lake\n\nSmelling like a bonfire\n\nLost in a haze\n\nIf youâre drunk on life, babe\n\nI think itâs great\n\nBut while in this world\n\nIn other words, don't you want to live, let loose and have a little fun while you still can?\n\nHozier adds, \"If youâre drunk on life, babe / I think itâs great\", but the artist has other plans.\n\nI think Iâll take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nI take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nHe craves a little bitterness, darkness, danger and his partner is quite the opposite, preferring softness, sweetness and structure instead.\n\nHe goes to sing how they treat their body like a temple with the lines, \"You treat your mouth as if itâs heavenâs gate / The rest of you like youâre the TSA, and asks, But who wants to live forever babe?\"\n\nHe wishes he could go along with that lifestyle, take the straight and narrow, but in reality...\n\nYou know youâre bright as the morning\n\nAs soft as the rain\n\nPretty as a vine\n\nAs sweet as a grape\n\nIf you can sit in a barrel\n\nMaybe Iâll wait\n\nUntil that day\n\nHozier again depicts the other person as being âsweetâ and likens them to a grape on the vine. For the first time in the song, he offers a glimmer of possibility, as he suggests that if the partner takes time to mature âin a barrelâ, then maybe their perspectives will align more closely. However, this is seemingly false hope, as - continuing on from the grape analogy - if this ages in a barrel, it'll become wine, which is still âtoo sweetâ compared to the protagonist's whiskey.\n\nI think Iâll take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nI take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nIt canât be said Iâm an early bird\n\nItâs ten oâclock before I say a word\n\nBaby, I can never tell\n\nHow do you sleep so well\n\nYou keep telling me to live right\n\nTo go to bed before daylight\n\nBut then you wake up for the sunrise\n\nYou know you donât gotta pretend\n\nBaby, now and then\n\nDonât you just wanna wake up\n\nDark as a lake\n\nSmelling like a bonfire\n\nLost in a haze\n\nIf youâre drunk on life, babe\n\nI think itâs great\n\nBut while in this world\n\nI think Iâll take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nI take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nI aim low\n\nI aim true and the ground is where I go\n\nI work late where Iâm free from the phone\n\nAnd the job gets done\n\nBut you worry some, I know\n\nBut who wants to live forever babe\n\nYou treat your mouth as if itâs heavenâs gate\n\nThe rest of you like youâre the TSA\n\nI wish that I could go along\n\nBabe, donât get me wrong\n\nYou know youâre bright as the morning\n\nAs soft as the rain\n\nPretty as a vine\n\nAs sweet as a grape\n\nIf you can sit in a barrel\n\nMaybe Iâll wait\n\nUntil that day\n\nIâd rather take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nI take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nI take my whiskey neat\n\nMy coffee black and my bed at three\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\nYouâre too sweet for me\n\n--\n\nFor more on Hozier, see below:"
