        "meta_description": "This Stays Between Us by Black Tie Dynasty, released 08 March 2005\n\n1. Crime Scene\n2. Die\n3. Ghost Of A Secretary\n4. Souls At Zero\n5. Southern Girls\n6. On Your Last Night In Town\n\nBlack Tie Dynasty delve easily into a night populated with warm leather and mixed drinks. Drawing from a large pool of collective influences, they have tapped into that same heated blood that coursed through the legendary music of groups like Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Depeche Mode to create sleek synth-rock for the modern day. Transcending mere nostalgic melancholy, they have come together on the EP, “This Stays Between Us”, and put to tape a work that is vital and immediate. The record serves as both a canvas and litmus paper, preserving the finer aspects of their dynamic stage performance while testing new ground in an effort to deconstruct any preconceived notion of their image and ability. Their signature sound is made all the more compelling for its consistency and dramatic panache.\r\n\r\nMeeting through a series of happy accidents, Black Tie Dynasty has evolved from the ashes of past lives as their agreed upon objectives become clearer and more ambitious. They manage to balance substance and style, producing a cohesive whole smartly dressed for public consumption. Eddie Thomas and Blake McWhorter, on drums and bass respectively, provide the rhythm section with its heart and nuance. Recalling the great interplay between Stephen Morris and Peter Hook, of Joy Division, they work as one well-oiled machine grafting harmonic figures onto Cory Watson’s subtle chorus and delay guitar work. Watson’s vocals show signs of a multitude of influences and style, sounding like a fusion of the young Dave Gahan and Ian McCulloch. Seething with sensual tension, he sings like a man possessed of dark secrets and the overwhelming need to unburden himself in narrative reconstructions of the visions that populate his sleep. On synths/keyboards Brian McCorcuodale gives the songs some of their most memorable riffs, stretching emotion evenly throughout every piece. Their standout performances are borne out of a shared desire to make their fans get up and move to their hypnotic rhythms. They want to arrest your attention with their atmospheric sound and presence and crave a deliberate reaction to their creative styling.\r\n\r\nPart dance record and part soundtrack to a headphone voyager’s next great trip, Black Tie Dynasty provides aural escapism that takes us back to the halcyon days of Robert Smith and Ian Curtis. Armed with the sounds of yesterday, with eyes fixed firmly upon tomorrow, they are determined to make songs that are relevant to anyone who’s ever felt lost in the shadows of this world; a sci-fi lullaby for a more cynical age.",

Do you agree you could be free before I started turning you loose? I’m gonna let you die You’ve collected all the evidence you know what they say and if you’re so concerned don’t let the stay the forecast reads\n\n3.\n\nGhost Of A Secretary 05:36\n\nThe ledger reads like a stock quote piled up on the dance floor city lights guided the way I planned to restore all of your confidence But I couldn’t stop staring my head was feeding on miscommunication peeling from the ceiling your ghost was in my home I was compelled by all rights To wash the mascara from your eyelids But the truth never comes from dry eyes So it goes Into your veins and into your clothes I wake you up and walked you home\n\n4.\n\nSouls At Zero 04:54\n\nYou do it all so well It’s poetry in motion except when the path is unknown or slightly out of focus if you don’t know by now you will never figure it out You failed to fool yourself trying to find out you do it to a fault but somebody else’s love will get you home You do it all so right you’re walking on the water all the stars ignite as they’re attaching to your body\n\n5.\n\nSouthern Girls 04:46\n\nIt’s all you can do to minimize watch old soaps and do your laundry the feds are carrying cameras I’m surprised you hadn’t noticed anything at all It’s all you can do to finalize Tell your folks or keep them guessing When there’s nothing left to articulate To your friends who say you’re cutting out too soon When all you do is wait, for a signal of the times When you’re turning out the lights on southern girls Are you gonna miss me when I’m gone?\n\n6."
