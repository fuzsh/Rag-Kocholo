This Album has a complete new story, the Cry Baby story is now ended and we have a new character: Melatonin. Melanie straggled particularly bringing this Album to life since she had to create a completely new story since PORTALS was the last Album related to the Cry Baby story. It's also the first time that Melanie makes an Album with more then 13 songs, and it's the longest Album yet. The Album is available in CD, Vinyl and digital Purchase, In the first week the Album sold over 968.000 units and 793.000 units in the second week. A Netflix show came along with the Album called \"Dynasty: Melanie Martinez Interview\" where Melanie sang the songs of the Album and she explained their meanings and said some fun facts about the Album. In an interview she said that she's gonna soon put out the Music Videos and that she already started recording some but it's tough cause she doesn't have much time before the tour and she doesn't want to keep her fans waiting too much so she's trying as fast as she can.\n\nBackground[]\n\nMelanie started recording the Album in August 2024 and she finished in May 2027, all the songs got leaked in late 2025 so Melanie had to write new songs and she used some of her Portals unreleased for the Deluxe Version.\n\nMelanie asked fans not to leak anymore in an interview in 2024 because it's really hard to make new songs but a hacker didn't listen and leaked the full Album, Melanie was concerned if she should've just released all the leaked songs so that the fans would've understood that if they leak they get the leaked version even if it's not good but she decided to just make new songs and just told her fans to please not hack.\n\nMelanie knew how to continue the story but it was difficult to make the songs because she wanted to make something completely different from her past Albums so she had to put her everything in this Album. She decided not to make a movie about this Album and she decided that she will maybe make a movie for the next one(fifth Studio Album)will not be related to Melatonin but it will be like an \"extra\" album and Melanie oficially said that her sixth Studio Album will be related to Melatonin again.\n\nTracklist[]\n\n🅴 means that the song is explicit\n\n\"Go To Sleep\"\n\n\"Pixie Wings ft.Ashnikko\"🅴\n\n\"Illusions\"🅴\n\n\"Dragon's Castle\"\n\n\"Journey\"\n\n\"Falling Down\"🅴\n\n\"Frying Wings\"🅴\n\n\"What's My Name Again?\"\n\n\"Fantasy Map\"\n\n\"Maniac\"🅴\n\n\"Am I Still Here?\"\n\n\"Paradise ft.Billie Eilish\"\n\n\"Purgatory\"🅴\n\n\"Dynasty\"\n\n\"Looser\"🅴\n\n\"Mirrors\"🅴\n\n\"Floating Up\"\n\n\"Balloons\"\n\n\"Hurt\"🅴\n\nDeluxe Tracks[]\n\n🅴 means that the song is explicit\n\n\"Corpse\"🅴\n\n\"Jinx\"🅴\n\n\"Shoot Me\"🅴\n\n\"Puzzles\"\n\n\"Not Dead Just Expired\"\n\nCut Tracks[]\n\n🅴 means that the song is explicit\n\n\"Mirror Lake\"\n\n\"Angel's Sword\"🅴\n\n\"Match\"\n\n\"Good Boy\"🅴\n\n\"What Did You Say?\"🅴\n\n\"Broken Pictures\"🅴\n\n\"Heart Pop\"\n\n\"Cigarettes\"🅴\n\n\"Perfect Model\"\n\n\"Family\"🅴\n\n\"Recovery\"\n\n\"Lights\"🅴\n\n\"Are You My Friend?\"🅴\n\nTheme[]\n\nMelanie Still Hasn't Talked about the Album Meaning but the Fans obviously have Lots of Theories and for me after listening many times to the Album the most \"convincing\" theory is that the Album actually talks about Melatonin having no friends and an abusive family and he creates a fantasy world with friends and a nice family to spend time with, some songs like \"Frying Wings\" and \"Hurt\" talk about Melatonin getting bullied by other kids and his family abusing him, mentally and sexually/physically.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMelanie wanted to release an EP before this Album but she ofcially said that the EP will come out before her seventh Studio Album.\n\nMelanie likes all the songs in this Album but they like particullarly \"Pixie Wings ft.Ashnikko\" and \"Paradise ft.Billie Eilish\".\n\nThere was supposed to be a collaboration with Bella Poarch in this Album but Bella was really busy in the making of the Album so in the end the collaboration wasn't made but in an interview Melanie said that she and Bella will probably collaborate in her sixth Studio Album or in the EP after.\n\nMelanie Oficially said that if her sixth Studio Album gets leaked she will not record new songs but just release old PORTALS unreleased.\n\nThe Album was supposed to be called \"Medieval Dynasty\" but it was later changed in just \"Dynasty\"\n\nMelanie's favorite unreleased song from this Album is \"Broken Pictures\" which talks about someone being sexually abused by a family member.\n\nThe song that Melanie relates to the most is \"Illusions\" the reason is still Unknown.\n\nDragon's Blood[]\n\nDragon's Blood is a PORTALS unreleased wich was used for inspiration for \"Dragon's Castle\", Melanie actually wanted to release \"Dragon's Blood\" when the DEMO of the Album got leaked but in the end she decided to just take inspiration and write a new song.\n\nSingles[]\n\nBefore releasing \"Dynasty\" Melanie released some singles, 1 isn't related to the Album and the other 3 are. The 3 Album singles were the first 3 songs on the Album.\n\n\"Plant\" on the 15th of August 2025\n\n\"Go To Sleep\" on the 27th of March 2027\n\n\"Pixie Wings ft.Ashnikko\" on the 6th of April 2027\n\n\"Illusions\" on the 13th of April 2027\n\nTour[]\n\nMelanie began touring in America on the 31st of October 2027 and ended on the 24th of June 2028, she then started touring in Europe on the 6th of September 2028 and ended on the 23rd of February 2029. A lot of people were wondering if she would've toured in Asia and she actually did, starting on the 14th of July 2029 and ending on the 9th of March 2030.\n\nGallery[]"
