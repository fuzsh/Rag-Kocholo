Depths III\n\nI knew one truth, and that truth was the sea.\n\nCold and knowing, it saw the coward in me.\n\nAnd as the stain of epochs lines my tongue,\n\nI choked heavy on the past, too numb to speak back.\n\nWe're each abandoned by the hands of time\n\nThat set us down to sail circles 1 across a straight line.\n\nSister moon, are we all that's left?\n\nJust a silent satellite and the sigh of flesh. 2\n\nCome down!\n\nAnd rest your lunar head on my breast,\n\nListen to the terror tear at my chest.\n\nOur masts in tatters, oars shattered,\n\nFeel free to pull me back to the vast, unforgiving mass.\n\nShould we call this art\n\nMy falling apart?\n\nThe tangents of an imbalanced heart.\n\nAs matter multiplied,\n\nI divide...\n\nBut I digress\n\nThe deprivation is taking effect.\n\nYou said if I stood against my darkness,\n\nNot all of me would die. 3\n\nBut all I see on the surface is a shadow\n\nAnd it occurs to me this could mean suicide.\n\nWhen you went quiet 4\n\nI turned to silence, 5\n\nSeven sisters 6 draw me back across the moor. 7\n\nCould you still love me in my leaving?\n\nWould you remember me by the moments we forgot?\n\nAnd as the waves slapped at my raft,\n\nI cursed the fate â like our vows,\n\nThey broke at the bow.\n\nFlanked by the mist\n\nI inhaled the breath of existence...\n\nThen you called me for one last time:\n\n\"I am the wind â the Be and the Still.\n\nI am the Depths, the Immeasurable Will.\"\n\nAnd when I awoke in that Garden,\n\nLord, did you see me as I was dreaming?\n\nI locked eyes with the storm,\n\nThe sky sank down to receive the fury of the sea.\n\nThe abolition of my being, 8\n\nThe precipice of eternity. 9\n\nIncandescence burst through the black,\n\nThe veil was torn 10 as the void collapsed.\n\nThe rains will subside.\n\nBe my eyes, 11\n\nShow me hope in the maw of the night.\n\nOur fractured pasts fall into one,\n\nA dozen stars 12 collide as a perpetual sun. 13\n\nAnd as we disintegrate,\n\nWill you be the\n\nFire that burns in my lungs?\n\nBreathe me in.\n\nWatch me burn.\n\nCome breath me in.\n\nBreathe me in.\n\nYou'll watch me burn.\n\n[1 Eternal Return.\n\n2 Charles Bukowski \"Alone with Everybody\".\n\n3 Phinehas \"Moriar\".\n\n4 Shusaku Endo \"Silence\".\n\n5 John of the Cross \"Dark Night of the Soul\".\n\n6 The protagonists of \"The Night God Slept\".\n\n7 Depths II.\n\n8 C.S.
