The Best Of Times\n\nI used to sit with him outside\n\nWe would laugh and talk for hours\n\nWhile he taught this little boy\n\nWhat it means to be a man, a father\n\nGiven to me, given to me\n\nA burden to bear, a crown to wear\n\nA pain to remind me of what I should be\n\nA lesson to learn, a dream to earn\n\nPlease the crowd and make him proud\n\nI'll be all can be, show that I'm worthy\n\nHe was always there\n\nHe would always care\n\nNever leave me scared\n\nI miss him so much...\n\nHe would never judge\n\nNever hold a grudge\n\nWhen I made my choices\n\nHe stood by me\n\nIt was the best of times\n\nIf only someone had told me\n\nHow life can fade\n\nHow king can fall\n\nI'd change my ways\n\nAnd all the days I wasted\n\nI'd spend with the ones that I love\n\nI'm all alone here\n\nI'have no one\n\nI'll face you right here\n\nI'll come undone\n\nIn her heart I found a home\n\nMy sanctuary, a place to call my own\n\nI was not the only one\n\nThere was also something darker inside her\n\nPerfect in my eyes\n\nShe would always smile\n\nFade away with style\n\nStanding by her bed\n\nOut of tears to shed\n\nShe told me to remember\n\nAll our good days\n\nIt was the best of times\n\nIf only someone had told me\n\nHow life can fade\n\nHow king can fall\n\nI'd change my ways\n\nAnd all the days I wasted\n\nI'd spend with the ones that I love\n\nWounds can be opened\n\nAnd all hearts can be broken\n\nAnd all words left unspoken\n\nMust then crawl to their graves\n\nWe will grow older\n\nAnd our nights will grow colder\n\nWhen the moment is over\n\nIt will never come back\n\n[2x]\n\nIt was the best of times\n\nIf only someone had told me\n\nHow life can fade\n\nHow king can fall\n\nI'd change my ways\n\nAnd all the days I wasted\n\nI'd spend with the ones that I love\n\nWounds can be opened\n\nAnd all hearts can be broken\n\nAnd all words left unspoken\n\nMust then crawl to their graves\n\nWe will grow older\n\nAnd our nights will grow colder\n\nWhen the moment is over\n\nIt will never come back\n\n3. A Night To Forget\n\nWhen lights go down lets have another round\n\nCome here my love, help me to search for my crown\n\nA king of fools, I'm breaking all the rules\n\nA drunken parody, I can't see the irony\n\nThis is my dynasty of pride and vanity\n\nMy broken self-esteem just can't face reality\n\nAlways the silent one, I was born to be undone\n\nSo I'll stay here in the darkness and I will\n\nLeave everything\n\nLeave everything behind me\n\nMy every sigh and every little lie\n\nAll that I have are memories so frozen\n\nNo one is flawless but baby I'm the worst\n\nPour me another one\n\nTell me I'll meet someone\n\nA spoonful of sugar makes the poison go down\n\nFeed my insanity\n\nWrite me a tragedy\n\nLet's make a memory\n\nA night to forget\n\nRain keeps falling\n\nI'll keep crawling\n\nAt three A.M. I can't remember who I am\n\nA sad and epic fail, I'm three on the Glasgow scale\n\nOnce again I vow \"I'll make this right somehow\"\n\nIt's just another lie, you'd cry if you could see me now\n\nI'm such a travesty, living out my fallacy\n\nLeave it to me to be the killer and the casualty\n\nLate nights and neon lights\n\nA thousand wrongs and zero rights\n\nThese are the steps that I must follow and I will\n\nA shot of whiskey and some wine\n\nA life in beautiful decline\n\nI try to run, I try to hide\n\nIntoxicated all the time\n\nI'll build a bridge to watch it burn\n\nPour the ashes in the urn\n\nAnd turn away just to start again\n\n4. I Will Build You A Rome\n\n[Lyrics and music by Jani Liimatainen]\n\nA word or a touch\n\nAll I need, I'm not asking for much\n\nTake my hand, I will follow you home\n\nWith these hands I will build you a Rome\n\nWhere they will never find us\n\nNo need to be scared\n\nI do not care about who you were\n\nAll that matters is right here and now\n\nWhat will come there is no way to know\n\nBut we'll face it together\n\nYou'll never need to ask for more\n\nYou know you can have it all\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nMy love, my soul, my heart\n\nAre yours if you just want\n\nTo share your life with me\n\nForevermore\n\nThey will not burn our Rome\n\nMy heart will always be your home\n\nAs long as you will have me\n\nSince we began\n\nYou have turned me into a man\n\nInto someone I wished I could be\n\nI believe and the gods they decree\n\nWe were meant for each other\n\nYou'll never need to ask for more\n\nYou know you can have it all\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe only heaven I need is you\n\nAlways so tender and always true\n\nYou are the spark that can light up my dark\n\nForever safe right here in my arms\n\nAnd I don't just love you for who you are\n\nBut for what you have made out of me\n\nNot for your beauty, so easy to see\n\nBut for making me now complete\n\n[Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n5. Too Tired To Run\n\nThere was a time when I could make your bright eyes gleam\n\nNow smiles upon your face are few and far between\n\nWe were so young, naive and blind in all our pride\n\nTo see the warning, the turning of the tide\n\nAnd I guess it's best we laid to rest\n\nAll that we had and all that we hope for\n\nIt's time to close the door\n\nStand here by my side and watch the river flow\n\nThrough fields once green, where our garden used to grow\n\nLife goes by so fast and time waits for no one\n\nToo long we stared into the sun\n\nNow days are growing dark and we're too tired to run\n\nNow that we've lost the flame, the beauty of it all\n\nOur symmetry of souls reduced to metaphor\n\nWe live, we learn some things are impossible to do\n\nAnd still I need you more than I want to\n\nBut I guess it's best we laid to rest\n\nAll that we had and all that we hoped for\n\nIt's time to close the door\n\nStand here by my side and watch the river flow\n\nThrough silent fields, where our garden used to grow\n\nLife goes by so fast and time waits for no one\n\nToo long we stared into the sun\n\nNow days are growing dark and we're too tired to run\n\nI could've been worse, but I should've been better\n\nShould've been there 'cause I said \"forever\"\n\nNow I'm here wondering what\n\nShould've, could've, would've been and\n\nI could've said more 'cause the words they matter\n\nShould've been strong so you wouldn't have shattered\n\nBut I'm here wondering what\n\nShould've, could've, would've been\n\nAnd I hope he gives more than I did\n\nAll that you need and all that you hope for\n\nStand here by my side and watch the river flow\n\nThrough silent fields, where our garden used to grow\n\nLife goes by so fast, so hold me one last time\n\nYou'll always be true love of mine\n\nAnd when the day is through I'm watching over you\n\n6. Constellation Of Tears\n\nI will write a tale that is only mine\n\nOn the page the words entwine\n\nMy creation of beauty and of passion\n\nMortal heart now writing immortal love\n\nEverything I'm dreaming of\n\nI will fashion a goddess, my obsession\n\nStains on these pages\n\nConstellation of tears\n\nLike stars with scars\n\nDark design of my twisted mind\n\nYou're the final blight of a failed playwright\n\nFigment of my madness\n\nVerse of woe and sadness\n\nWild and free, you're the raging sea\n\nAnd one day you will be the end of me\n\nYour star will be brightest\n\nIn my constellation of tears\n\nYou'll shine so bright tonight\n\nBroke my quill, I can't bend her to my will\n\nAnd the love grows stronger still\n\nWhile the rhymes they betray and the words they fail me\n\nErato, why do you hate me so?\n\nHave some heart or let me go\n\nI am old and I'm tired, uninspired\n\nStains on these pages\n\nConstellation of tears\n\nLike stars with scars\n\nDark design of my twisted mind\n\nYou're the final blight of a failed playwright\n\nFigment of my madness\n\nVerse of woe and sadness\n\nWild and free, you're the raging sea\n\nAnd one day you will be the end of me\n\nYour star will be brightest\n\nIn my constellation of tears\n\nYou'll shine so bright tonight\n\nA flame that burns twice as bright\n\nBurns half as long\n\nMine faded long ago\n\nMy queen will never claim her throne\n\nI'll always be alone, my tale be left untold\n\nStains on these pages\n\nConstellation of tears\n\nLike stars with scars\n\nDark design of my twisted mind\n\nYou're the final blight of a failed playwright\n\nFigment of my madness\n\nVerse of woe and sadness\n\nWild and free, you're the raging sea\n\nAnd one day you will be the end of me\n\nYour star will be brightest\n\nIn my constellation\n\nDark design of my twisted mind\n\nYou're the final blight of a failed playwright\n\nFigment of my madness\n\nVerse of woe and sadness\n\nWild and free, you're the raging sea\n\nAnd one day you will be the end of me\n\nYour star will be brightest\n\nIn my constellation of tears\n\nYou'll shine so bright tonight\n\n7. Antemortem\n\nThere's beauty in pain that paints every day\n\nWith colours that stay and won't fade away\n\nIn wounds that won't heal, in nightmares too real\n\nThey tell us that we can still feel\n\nIn fire we're forged and given a form\n\nThe harder the hammer the stronger the soul\n\nFor all of our tears and all of our scars\n\nThey remind us of who we are\n\nOne is for the heart we left behind\n\nOne is for a friend who said to goodbye\n\nOne is for the love we swore would never die\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nOne is for the times we were denied\n\nOne is for the feelings locked inside\n\nOne is for the secrets that we've had to hide\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nWe might've been kings\n\nWe might have been pawns\n\nWe might've been ducklings\n\nWe might have been swans\n\nThere's no grand design\n\nThere's only desire\n\nYou're either the pearl or the swine\n\nFor all that we've lost and our every tear\n\nThe choices we've made have brought us here\n\nEverything we are, everything we have\n\nWe have built from fragments\n\nOne is for the heart we left behind\n\nOne is for a friend who said to goodbye\n\nOne is for the love we swore would never die\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nOne is for the times we were denied\n\nOne is for the feelings locked inside\n\nOne is for the secrets that we've had to hide\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nPlease believe in me\n\nBecause the man you see\n\nis not the man I used to be\n\nWe may always be alone and broken\n\nBut we have survived, we are alive\n\nPlease believe in me\n\nBecause the man you see\n\nis not the man I used to be\n\nWe may always be alone and broken\n\nBut we have survived, we are alive\n\nOne is for the heart we left behind\n\nOne is for a friend who said to goodbye\n\nOne is for the love we swore would never die\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nOne is for the times we were denied\n\nOne is for the feelings locked inside\n\nOne is for the secrets that we've had to hide\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nOne is for the heart we left behind\n\nOne is for a friend who said to goodbye\n\nOne is for the love we swore would never die\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\nOne is for the times we were denied\n\nOne is for the feelings locked inside\n\nOne is for the secrets that we've had to hide\n\nBut that was in another lifetime\n\n8. My Heart Beats For No One\n\nOnce again I'm in too deep\n\nOnce again there is no sleep\n\nUnderneath these scarlit skies\n\nWhere you and me are but a stillborn dream\n\nAnd if there'll be a brand new dawn\n\nCan you tell me\n\nWhere is my home and where is my haven\n\nWhere is the heart my name has been graven in\n\nYou're still a saint in my eyes\n\nBut God I am so tired\n\nSo take the knife\n\nAnd sever the last lifeline\n\nIt's over\n\nNow one must walk alone\n\nOne is left behind\n\nThis is who we are\n\nThis is where we stand\n\nStrangers in the night\n\nOur wounds open wide\n\nKnow that when you're gone\n\nMy heart beats for no one\n\nNow I'm at the end of my rope\n\nOut of strength and out of hope\n\nYou can have what's left of me\n\nBut if you do tread carefully\n\nFor now my mind is a minefield\n\nMy heart's a haunted house\n\nYours is a taste that used to be sweeter\n\nYour every word keeps slaying the dreamer\n\nI'll gather the pieces one last time\n\nI'm not ok, I'm not fine\n\nSo dead inside\n\nLeaving heaven denied behind\n\nIt's over\n\nNow one must walk alone\n\nOne is left behind\n\nThis is who we are\n\nThis is where we stand\n\nStrangers in the night\n\nOur wounds open wide\n\nKnow that when you're gone\n\nMy heart beats for no one\n\nNow one must walk alone\n\nOne is left behind\n\nThis is who we are\n\nThis is where we stand\n\nStrangers in the night\n\nOur wounds open wide\n\nKnow that when you're gone\n\nMy heart beats for no one\n\n9. I Am Legion\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n10. Rising Sun\n\nYou always tried so hard to hide\n\nAll the pain you held inside\n\nA little piece of heaven\n\nFaded, tainted memory\n\nYou always smiled and played your part\n\nA jaded soul and hardened heart\n\nLike a child you stumbled in the dark\n\nThese are the hands that shelter you\n\nWhen the rain begins to pour\n\nThis is the heart than listens\n\nWhen you're down, can take no more\n\nNo matter what you're not alone\n\nI am always by your side\n\nI will be here when the worlds collide\n\nLet it rain and let it thunder\n\nYou'll be safe from going under\n\nYou will not drown, I won't let you down\n\nAnd when the winter comes I'll keep you warm\n\nThere's hope in every heartbeat\n\nBeautiful and complete\n\nWhen you're in too deep\n\nYou can always call on me\n\nFor no mountain is too high\n\nNo ocean is too wide\n\nFor me to come and be your rising sun\n\nI am the one to light the way\n\nThrough the darkest of your days\n\nA beacon in the night\n\nTo guide your ship back to the shore\n\nA rain to wash away the stains\n\nOf a thousand yesterdays\n\nThere's no need for you to be afraid\n\nLet it rain and let it thunder\n\nYou'll be safe from going under\n\nYou will not drown, I won't let you down\n\nAnd when the winter comes I'll keep you warm\n\nThere's hope in every heartbeat\n\nBeautiful and complete\n\nWhen you're in too deep\n\nYou can always call on me\n\nFor no mountain is too high\n\nNo ocean is too wide\n\nFor me to come and be your rising sun\n\nI will always be here standing at your door\n\nAnd my arms are open wide\n\nWaiting here until your wave will reach my shore\n\nWaiting for the eventide\n\nLet all your grief cascade on me\n\nI'll be the sea where they'll drown\n\nThere's hope in every heartbeat\n\nBeautiful and complete\n\nWhen you're in too deep\n\nYou can always call on me\n\nFor no mountain is too high\n\nNo ocean is too wide\n\nFor me to come and be our rising sun\n\nFor me to come and be our rising sun\n\n11. On The Shore\n\nI know \"forever\" is asking too much\n\nBut what if this moment is all that we've got\n\nWhat if the morning will leave us so frail\n\nLeave us alone to face another day\n\nI'm trying so hard but it's never enough\n\nYou try to stay strong but the things can get tough\n\nWe used to say \"That will never be us\"\n\nNow \"Ashes to ashes and dust to dust\"\n\nAnything you want, everything you need\n\nYou can find it all in me\n\nBut if I'm too much or I'm not enough...\n\nWhen you've hoisted your canvass and you're ready to sail\n\nI wanna tell you please don't think that you've failed\n\nIf your ship is too small and there is room for just one\n\nI will stay on the shore so you can move on\n\nAnything you want, everything you need\n\nYou can find it all in me\n\nBut if I'm too much or I'm not enough...\n\nI'm standing on the shore of my emotions\n\nWaiting for the water to rise and touch my\n\nsoul\n\nAnd every forsaken night\n\nAll I wanted was to be right by your side\n\nBut you did not hear me\n\nFor I never spoke aloud my mind\n\nI never cried\n\nAnything you want, everything you need\n\nYou can find it all in me\n\nBut if I'm too much or I'm not enough...\n\nAnything you want, everything you need\n\nYou can find it all in me\n\nBut if I'm too much or I'm not enough...\n\nI'm standing on the shore...\n\nAnything you want, everything you need\n\nYou can find it all in me\n\n12. Child Of The Wild\n\nI've always been here underneath the stars\n\nUnderneath the snow white moon\n\nI have no place to call my own\n\nAnd my future is unknown\n\nThis is my journey, I must walk alone\n\nSolitude will be my home\n\nDarkness my guide, silence my bride\n\nAnd the creed of my kind\n\nBlood will follow blood\n\nWhen the wolves howl in the dark\n\nYou will know who you are\n\nChild of the wild\n\nSoul of a vagabond\n\nA son of the moon and stars\n\nI was born to run with the wind\n\nthat races along my\n\nMind of a child\n\nHeart of a wanderer\n\nEyes always shining bright\n\nThrough the night and\n\nUnder the northern star\n\nI'll be standing\n\nStrong like my mother\n\nFierce like my father\n\nI've seen the mountains\n\nPiercing through the clouds\n\nI have heard the thunder roar\n\nSeen thousand waves kiss distant shores\n\nStill I keep searching for more\n\nI'll ask no mercy, I'm the winterborn\n\nI'm the breeze and I'm the storm\n\nI won't be caged, I can't be tamed\n\nAlways free and unchained\n\nBlood will follow blood\n\nWhen the wolves howl in the dark\n\nYou will know who you are\n\nChild of the wild\n\nSoul of a vagabond\n\nA son of the moon and stars\n\nI was born to run with the wind\n\nthat races along my\n\nMind of a child\n\nHeart of a wanderer\n\nEyes always shining bright\n\nThrough the night and\n\nUnder the northern star\n\nI'll be standing\n\nStrong like my mother\n\nFierce like my father\n\nJani Hurula: drums\n\nJani Liimatainen: guitars, vocals (backing, choirs), programming, keyboards (additional)\n\nTimo Kotipelto: vocals\n\nJonas Kuhlberg: bass\n\nJens Johansson: keyboards\n\nThanks to soringc for sending these lyrics.\n\nThanks to lintu.aiello for sending tracks ## 1, 3, 5 lyrics.\n\nThanks to rtnario for sending track #4 lyrics.\n\nThanks to stitchgirl for correcting track #2 lyrics.\n\nThanks to piider.soderman for correcting track #5 lyrics.\n\nSubmits, comments, corrections are welcomed at webmaster@darklyrics.com\n\nCAIN'S OFFERING LYRICS"
