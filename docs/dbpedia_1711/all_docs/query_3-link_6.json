        "text": "Taylor Swift is easily one of the most iconic musicians of our generation (OK. century) and over the years, she has released a lot of music. We're talking 11 studio albums, four re-recordings and countless singles, deluxe editions and live performances. Seriously you could probably fill a week of your life just listening to Taylor. What a week that would be.\n\nGiven just how many albums Taylor has released (her first was in 2006 btw), we can be forgiven for sometimes forgetting the exact order they go in and which tracks sit in which album. We swear 'Teardrops on My Guitar' is from Fearless, but turns out it's from Taylor Swift.\n\nSo, in order to help any confused Swifties, we've made a complete guide to all of Taylor's albums including just how many she has, why she's re-recording some of them and the track listings of each album. Thank us later!\n\nHow many albums does Taylor Swift have?\n\nOk, so now officially Taylor has 11 studio albums starting from Taylor Swift all the way back in 2006 to her most recent album The Tortured Poets Department which she announced at the Grammys on 4th February 2024, and was released on 19th April 2024.\n\nTaylor has four rerecorded albums which have been released in the last few years: Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and now her latest re-release 1989 (Taylor's Version). This brings the total to 14, but don't stop counting yet.\n\nThere's then the four live albums: Live From Clear Channel Stripped 2008, Speak Now World Tour Live, Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions and Lover (Live From Paris).\n\nWith these four lives albums, it takes our grand total of Taylor Swift albums to a beyond impressive 19 albums. Seriously, does Taylor ever sleep?\n\nWhich album is Taylor re-recording next?\n\nSo far Taylor has re-recorded four of the six albums she created at Big Machine Records: Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version).\n\nStill to be re-recorded are Taylor Swift, and Reputation. As Taylor has literally only just released the re-recording of 1989 (Taylor's Version), it might be a while before we get either of the next two re-recordings.\n\nWhy is Taylor Swift re-recording her albums?\n\nAs any Swiftie will know, in the last few years Taylor has been busy rerecording her own version of earlier albums. But why exactly?\n\nWell when she was starting out in her career at 15 years old she was signed onto the record label Big Machine Records, which owned the rights to her masters aka original recordings.\n\nIn 2018, after her contract with Big Machine Records ended, Taylor signed onto a new label Universal's Republic Records, and as part of the deal she owns the right to her masters. However, this didn't apply to her previously recorded music.\n\nA year later when Big Machine Records was bought by Scooter Braun (you'll know him as Justin Bieber's manager) and thereby the rights to Taylor's first six albums are owned by Braun. This decision left Taylor with no control over how the songs were used.\n\nSo by re-recording her old albums at her new label she will have the right to decide how they are used, such as appearing in TV adverts or as part of movies.\n\nCan Taylor legally re-record her albums? Yep, she sure can. As part of her contract with Big Machine Records, the company gave her the right to start re-recording from November 2020.\n\nWhich albums does Taylor Swift own?\n\nTaylor now owns any of the albums she's released at Republic Records, so right now that total is at 11 albums.\n\nThese include her five studio albums: Lover, Folklore, Evermore, Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department. There's then the four re-recordings: Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version). And of course the two live albums: Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions and Lover (Live From Paris).\n\nTaylor Swift's albums in chronological order\n\nIf you're in the mood for a complete Taylor Swift binge-listen then this is every single studio and re-recorded album of Taylor's in chronological order.\n\nTaylor Swift - 2006\n\nTaylor Swift is the very first of Taylor's albums and was released on 24th October 2006.
