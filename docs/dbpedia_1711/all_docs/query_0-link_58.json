If you feel that your copyright has been infringed by one of the video examples, please contact YouTube to have it removed from their website, and send us a notice so that we can delete the infringing material from the list.\n\nSong lists are great, Ear Training is even better!\n\nUsing famous songs to memorize intervals is an easy way to memorize intervals, but that method has limits. At some point, you will need to recognize intervals instantly, almost instinctively. This can only be achieved with Ear Training.\n\nEarMaster is the best app you can get to train your ear.
