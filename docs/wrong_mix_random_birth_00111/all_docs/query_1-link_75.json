        "text": "About the Book\n\nThis first study on Woodrow Wilson as the commander in chief during the Great War analyzes his management style before the war, his diplomacy and his battle with the Senate.\n\nIt considers the war as representing the collapse of Western traditional virtues and examines Wilson’s attempt to restore them. Emphasizing the American war effort on the domestic front, it also discusses Wilson’s rise to power, his education, career, and work as governor as necessary steps in his formation. The authors deal honestly and critically with the racism that characterized this brilliant but limited career.\n\nWilson provided many precedents for future war presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Donald Trump.\n\nAbout the Author(s)\n\nMichael P. Riccards has been the president of three colleges as well as the head of a public policy institute. He is the author of volumes on the American presidency and the papacy and lives in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nCheryl A. Flagg‘s career was in higher education, including several campuses as well as at a non-profit membership association. She has been an editor and collaborator on several publications and lives in Bunker Hill, West Virginia.\n\nBibliographic Details\n\nMichael P. Riccards and Cheryl A.
