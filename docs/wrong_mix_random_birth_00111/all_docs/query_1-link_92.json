        "text": "“As America once again takes an isolationist and nationalist turn, it is refreshing and instructive to turn back to Woodrow Wilson’s internationalist vision. Power without Victory delves beneath popular stereotypes of Wilson, both good and bad, to offer a sophisticated analysis of a pragmatic-progressive tradition in American politics that is badly needed today.”\n\nAnne-Marie Slaughter | president and CEO of New America and coauthor of The Crisis of American Foreign Policy\n\n“Required reading for all scholars working on Wilson’s development as a political thinker, or on the deeper roots of the ideas that would become known as Wilsonianism.”\n\nAmerican Historical Review\n\n“Throntveit has taken on the ambitious task of redeeming the ideal of a global political order that Wilson represented. To a substantial degree, Throntveit also seeks to rescue Wilson himself as a political visionary. While not denying Wilson’s many flaws, Throntveit believes that they can be clearly distinguished from Wilson’s positive goals for both American and global politics. . . . He offers a convincing reconstruction of how Wilson and other American progressives thought about the ideals of political community and political deliberation, as well as the value of individual experimentation.”\n\nLawfare\n\n“In this masterful work, Throntveit traces with compelling precision the sources and evolution of Woodrow Wilson’s international thought and policies. Uncovering their roots in pragmatist philosophy, particularly the ideas of William James, and in Progressive Era politics, he shows how Wilson’s approach was tested during his years in power, most significantly in the Great War and the peace conference that followed. This is the best account we have of the origins, development, and consequences of ‘Wilsonianism’ in Wilson’s own time, and as such it is essential reading for anyone interested in the history and practice of US foreign relations.”\n\nErez Manela | author of The Wilsonian Moment\n\n“Wilsonianism has been studied intensively, but its philosophical underpinnings have rarely been examined with the care found in Power without Victory. Throntveit has written one of the most judicious, careful, and thoughtful accounts of Woodrow Wilson’s international thought.”\n\nAndrew Preston | author of Sword of the Spirit, Shield of Faith: Religion in American War and Diplomacy\n\n“In Power without Victory, Throntveit brilliantly illuminates the rich intellectual terrain upon which Woodrow Wilson cast his sweeping democratic vision of global order. Strikingly original, the book reframes our understanding of Wilson and his hopes for democratic renewal at home and peaceful change abroad. In this narrative, Wilson is a man of his time, embracing a pragmatic public philosophy and spirit of reform that ran through the American and European progressive intellectual and political world. Throntveit sees clearly Wilson’s moral flaws and blind spots, but he also finds in Wilson an earnest and grandly ambitious thinker who truly did offer a vision of a transformed world in which democracy and civil virtue would reign.”\n\nG. John Ikenberry | author of Liberal Leviathan: The Origins, Crisis, and Transformation of the American System\n\n\"In the context of international relations (IR) theory, Throntveit pushes against positivist-realist, neorealist, and neoliberal renditions of Wilson as a utopian oblivious to the anarchical nature of the international system dooming individual states to the security dilemma, limiting their cooperation, and dictating that they pursue national interests defined in terms of power...Wilson thus emerges as an early proponent of constructivism, whose contemporary representatives similarly view international structures as social phenomena—products of human choices and performances—capable of progressive change.\"\n\nThe Historian\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet the latest updates on new releases, special offers, and media highlights when you subscribe to our email lists!\n\nSign up here for updates about the Press"
