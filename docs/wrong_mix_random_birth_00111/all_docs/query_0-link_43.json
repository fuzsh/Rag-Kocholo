        "text": "February 26, 2020\n\nI began reading this excellent short biography of Wilson hoping that I would come to like him better, but it didn’t turn out that way. A former college president and son of a Southern minister, Woodrow Wilson was an irritating combination of lofty ivory-tower intellectual and self-satisfied moralist with a touch of racism that served to heighten the hypocrisy. Still, he was instrumental in forming the expanding role of the modern presidency, not only by instituting the income tax, but also by establishing the role of the American president as leader of the free world, the champion of peace, justice and democracy.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt may have proclaimed the presidency a ‘bully pulpit,” but Wilson made it a reality, heightening the importance of the State of the Union by reading it aloud to Congress, fighting the economic monopolies of the trusts, coming to the aid of the democracies in the bloody European war, striving for fairness and self-determination in the peace negotiations which followed, and devoting his remaining effort and energies to establish a viable League of Nations with the power to maintain that peace. The horrors of World War II would later demonstrate how badly Wilson failed, but there is no doubt he pursued his goal of peace with selflessness and devotion.\n\nOn the subject of Woodrow’s second wife, Edith. For years I have referred to her as “the USA’s first woman president.” Although not literally true, it is a good conversation starter, and contains enough truth to produce a good argument. Woodrow was certainly weakened by a series of strokes in 1919, and, during the final year and a half of his presidency, Edith was a jealous gatekeeper and her husband’s closest confidante. After reading Brands’ book, however, I have concluded that Woodrow was still competent enough to make his own decisions. It’s just that, in his last days, he had poor powers of concentration and little patience with long briefings—similar to our current president, Donald J. Trump. Like H.R. McMasters was forced to do with our jumpy genralissimo, Edith—an intelligent, well-read woman—decided which issues to present to her husband and reduced the many pages of briefing materials to a page or two. Was Edith instrumental in setting the agenda? Of course. But “Mrs. President”? That’s going a little too far.\n\nIn conclusion, H.W. Brands led me to respect and admire Wilson more, but I still cannot bring myself to like him. After all, he locked my hero Eugene Debs up in Federal prison. His crime? An anti-war speech delivered in Canton, Ohio. Later, during Wilson’s final days, as president, even Wilson’s radical-hating attorney-general Palmer asked that Debs be pardoned because of his failing health. The pardon request was denied.\n\nSo … no, I can’t bring myself to like Woodrow Wilson. Or Edith Wilson either.\n\nMay 21, 2022\n\nA President Of Words\n\nThe Distinguished Professor of History at Texas A&M University, H.W Brands, has a rare talent for writing accessible, and engaging works covering broad periods of American history. Brands has written, for example, biographies of diverse figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Franklin Roosevelt. He has written overviews of the Gilded Age and of contemporary American history which are informative and entertaining. His books about Aaron Burr and U.S. Grant are scheduled to be published this year.\n\nBrands' short biography \"Woodrow Wilson\" (2003) is part of the American Presidents series edited by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Sean Wilentz, and it shows both the strengths and weaknesses of his writing. The book has a lyricism and an immediacy that draws in the reader. It offers a good basic portrayal of its subject and of his importance. Brands organizes his book around a basic insight into Wilson which sees the president as a \"man of words\", an intellectual, and an idealist. The book works well as an overview and introduction which focuses on Wilson's strengths but at the cost of some simplification.\n\nWilson (1856 -- 1924) served from 1913 -- 1921 as the 28th American president. Before his election to the presidency, Wilson was an academic and intellectual with several important books on politics and American history to his credit. From 1902 -- 1910, Wilson served as president of Princeton University. In 1912, Wilson ran on Progressive principles to defeat his divided opponents, former president Theodore Roosevelt and incumbent president William Howard Taft. In a short opening chapter, Brands covers Wilson's early life, his career at Princeton, his election to the presidency, and the domestic achievements of his early administration. These achievements include the reduction of the tariff, the creation of the Federal Reserve, the strengthening of antitrust laws, and the creation of the Federal Trade Commission, among much else. There is a great deal of material to be absorbed and considered for a brief chapter.\n\nThe focus of Brands' biography is on WW I and on Wilson's role in the conflict. Wilson initially sought to keep the United States neutral. As a result of a complex series of events, he sought and received a declaration of war from Congress following his reelection. The book describes the tortured course which led to the War, its prosecution by the United States, Wilson's attempt to create a peace based upon the League of Nations, and the Congressional rejection of the League. This period of American history is difficult, complex, and controversial. Brands casts Wilson and his idealistic principles in a highly positive light. There is, however, a broad divergency of historical opinion about Wilson which Brands does not develop fully. Brands also tends to downplay the Wilson administration's attack on Civil Liberties during WW I together with the Administration's strong support, and strengthening, of Jim Crow. Most of the books in the American Presidents series focus upon the strengths of their subjects rather than on their shortcomings. This approach allows the reader to focus upon the goals of each president and upon that president's understanding of the United States and of leadership. On the whole, this approach is preferable to a deflationary approach, especially in an introductory study. But readers need to use judgment and reflection.\n\nBrands, as well as his protagonist, are men of words. The words of both author and subject feature prominently in this account. For example, Brands sets the tone of his biography of Wilson at the outset:\n\n\"In the beginning was the word. And in the end was the word. And in between were words: beautiful words, soaring words, words that moved a nation and enthralled a world, words that for a wonderful moment were more powerful than armies, words that made the most terrible sacrifice seem part of a glorious struggle, words that echoed across the oceans and down the decades.\"\n\nBrands quotes extensively from Wilson throughout the short book. He allows his subject to speak for himself to give the reader a feel for Wilson's intellect, passion, and idealism. Thus, the book opens with Brands' own summation, and it closes with a moving excerpt from Wilson's second inaugural address of March, 1917. Wilson said:\n\n\"We are provincials no longer. The tragic events of the thirty months of vital turmoil through which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world. There can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are involved whether we would have it so or not.\"\n\nxxxxxxxx\n\n\"The shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled, and we shall walk with the light all about us, if we be but true to ourselves -- to ourselves as we have wished to be known in the counsels of the world and in the thought of all those who love liberty and justice and the right exalted.\"\n\nBrands' book offers an inspiring overview of an important American president and his ideals at a pivotal moment of history.\n\nRobin Friedman\n\nJune 21, 2009\n\nMany people ask when they found out that I'm a political scientist: \"When has a political scientist ever affected politics?\" Frankly, there are quite a few who have done so (think Henry Kissinger, for instance). But, above all, there is Woodrow Wilson. He served as President of the American Political Science Association and wrote a series of works that are still viewed as classics in the study of politics and public administration.\n\nThis biography, another of those brief looks at presidents in \"The American Presidents\" series, does its job well. While I agree with other reviewers that this is such a brief volume that it glosses over much of Wilson's career, the series is what it is. And I think it somewhat unfair to criticize the book for working within the parameters imposed upon it.\n\nThat said, this is a capable biography. I think a little more information about his early career, his life as an academic, an academic administrator, and governor may be covered too briefly even for this series. But that is not atypical.\n\nThe book does give a sense of his persona--aloofness, stubbornness, rigidity, certitude, erudition, persuasive ability--and how this helped him succeed, but also could lead him to take stands that hurt his cause.\n\nThe volume lays out the accomplishments with which he is associated, advancing the progressive agenda, enunciating a political perspective (\"The New Freedom\"), and the like. It also addresses his foreign policy--from the not terribly successful Mexican adventure to his leadership of the country in World War I to his efforts to transform global governance after the war (note his 14 points and his effort to establish a meaningful \"League of Nations\").\n\nHe ran into political opposition with the League. The book does a nice job--even with its brevity on this score--explaining why he failed and how the effort here plus preexisting medical problems led to his breakdown and the strange last months of his presidency.\n\nThere were contradictions with Wilson--his Southern background was associated with racism, even as his ideals led him to assist workers throughout the country with his Progressive policies. If you want a quick introduction to Wilson that nonetheless provides some understanding of his presidency, you could do a lot worse than visiting this volume.\n\nFebruary 25, 2016\n\nExcellent, and brief, introduction to President Wilson. Very little about his childhood, some background about his experience at Princeton and as Governor, but mostly about his years as President. Wilson was the President who gave us the Federal reserve, the income tax, and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as a host of other progressive legislation (child labor laws, etc.). Most of that was accomplished in his first term. In 1914, of course, Europe broke out in World War I. The book then chronicles his (eventually unsuccessful) efforts to keep the US neutral, and, of course, the battle over his Fourteen Points and the League of Nations. Excellent read. Brands, of course, is one of our best historians - he has a knack for finding the essence of a story and making clear and understandable.\n\nMarch 31, 2017\n\nAlthough Wilson was not rated as one of the best presidents I believe his intentions towards bettering the US's international reputation were solid and helped towards the formation of the United Nations. He had his faults to be sure as we all do but this is definitely a book well worth reading.\n\nApril 25, 2021\n\nI do enjoy this Presidents of the United States series thus far. I haven’t read them in order, but so far so good! It is nice that different authors are used throughout the series, keeps things fresh and focused!\n\nI like to start with 5 Stars then work my way down and up along then way when I read and then review. I took two stars off because while H. W. Brands is a great storyteller and writer. He covers a lot of ground in his studies and likes to jump all over the place historical. His writing very in many areas of American History. This typically leads to a surface level style of writing. So I would say this is a good book of you want a basic start on Woodrow Wilson, but further study is suggested (for instance only one page-in the last chapter-is devoted to Wilson’s racial views and his ties with the KKK) . This book is also good for people who really like Wilson or Wilsonian ideals, I for one do not. H. W. Brands does a good job lifting up Wilson’s critics (as in he includes the views of those who disagreed with Wilson) but he himself writes in an affirming and promoting way in regards to Wilson.\n\nI personally think Wilson belongs on my top 5 worst Presidents list, but this book was good for me to read because I got to see him through the lens of someone who likes him and his policies.\n\nApril 27, 2012\n\nExcellent short sketch of Woodrow Wilson; not really a biography per se, more of a political sketch of Wilson and his term with some biographical elements. Brands writes masterfully and powerfully. The last chapters in particular engage the reader. I've read -- or attempted to read - some biographies of Woodrow Wilson that were longer and much, much less influential on my thoughts about the president. I thought some of the ideas that Brands expands upon were quite interesting and well done in what amounts to a very small space: Woodrow Wilson's relationship with his second wife Edith was incredibly influential on both domestic and world affairs, in ways we probably will never know; that Wilson \"lived too long and died too soon\" meaning if he died from his stroke, he would have died a hero and martyr instead of a broken man, and that if he'd lived long enough, he would have seen many of his ideas come to fruition. Or another idea: \"Wilson discovered -- in the way presidents typically do -- that power isn't nearly as threatening when wielded by oneself as when one's opponents hold it.\" Isn't that true about every president, even those in the same party?\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nWoodrow Wilson is the twenty-seventh book in The American Presidents series – a biographical series chronicling the Presidents of the United States. H.W. Brands wrote this particular installment and edited by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.\n\nThomas Woodrow Wilson was an American statesman, lawyer, and academic who served as the twenty-eighth President of the United States from 1913– 1921. A member of the Democratic Party, Wilson served as the President of Princeton University and as the thirty-fourth Governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 Presidential Election. As president, he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933. He also led the United States into World War I in 1917, establishing an activist foreign policy known as \"Wilsonianism\".\n\nBrands gives a sober portrait of a president dedicated to peace yet compelled to enter a brutal war. Yet more than his actions, Brands writes eloquently of Wilson's beautiful words, soaring words, words moved a nation and enthralled a world, words that for a wonderful moment were more powerful than armies. Despite recent events, Brands' statement that Wilson's views idealism is sometimes the highest form of realism have triumphed and that the U.S. concedes the U.N.'s role at the center of world affairs.\n\nAll in all, Woodrow Wilson is a good, albeit brief biography of the twenty-eighth President and it is a good continuation to what would hopefully be a wonderful series of presidential biographies, which I plan to read in the very near future.\n\nFebruary 3, 2018\n\nI read this book as part of my research for WWI. The book itself was good, though I didn't know quite so much about Woodrow Wilson before. And now I kind of wish I didn't. But those are just personal beliefs about how the government should be run, not anything to do with the book itself. If you want to know about Woodrow Wilson, this is a good book to read or listen to.\n\nAugust 4, 2022\n\nA short overview of Wilson and his presidency by one of my favorite historians. A good intro to the topic that whetted my appetite for a more thorough treatment and analysis of one of the most important times of the modern era.\n\nApril 14, 2020\n\nA biography that emphasizes WW's internationalism and idealism, and slights the characteristics that made him uniquely incapable of realizing his vision: his sanctimony (since God was on his side, anyone who disagreed with him about the League of Nations must have been in League with Satan); his personal prejudices (the man who championed the right of self-determination for all people was a proud segregationist); and, worst of all, his faith in words words over action (if he just gave enough speeches, everything would be better!). Of course, everyone who fancies himself a moral avatar is a hypocrite in the making, it's just that Wilson couldn't be bothered to make his flaws interesting.\n\nFebruary 6, 2014\n\nH.W. Brands was my professor at Texas and we had to read this book for class and I found it does a good job of portraying not only Wilson but the situations that formed his presidency and legacy\n\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nTommy Woodrow Wilson had an interesting childhood. His dad was a preacher and the family moved quite a bit. Was not that well off but they did okay financially. Wilson realized the importance of using your voice to get your point of across. He started out at Davidson, left their went to Princeton, attended law school in Virginia then finished his doctorate at John Hopkins. Become a professor and ended up at Princeton where he made a name for himself. His ability to speak and teaching success paved the way for someone less experienced in politics to gain the popular vote. He beat teddy Roosevelt and Taft. International affairs really dominated his early presidential years particularly events in Mexico. Eventually he introduced a tariff /tax policy. Ww1 broke out and Wilson and the us remained neutral. But German sub attacks including the Lusitania led the us to join ww1. He pushed hard for the treaty of Versailles and forming a League of Nations. But no one was ready for it. It wouldn’t be until during and after ww2 people came around and realized this organization was very much needed. Wilson suffered a number of strokes during his life. Really brutal traveling thousands of miles by train everywhere and speaking for 6+ plus hours a day that had a huge negative impact on his health. Unknown how many strokes he had, probably 6-7 but eventually he had a very serious one that he never recovered from. Last 18 months of his second term he was not seen hardly by anyone. He doesn’t get high marks on fighting for equal rights as he didn’t support it.\n\nJune 18, 2019\n\nA President that time has forgotten. This book is part of the Arthur Schlesinger Series on the U.S. Presidents. A good series overall.\n\nWilson was one of the first presidents to recognize how small the world was getting, that events in Indonesia, Central America, the United States effect not just themselves and immediate neighbors but the whole Globe. Wilson's Fourteen Points was an attempt to establish a United Nations type oversight post WW l. He cajoled as much as he could to try and convince the allied countries to abandon the winner takes all approach to negotiations and drop reparations but to no avail. He preached that the old approach will shortly result in another World War, the British and French didn't care and could not be convinced otherwise.\n\nWilson also was responsible on the home front for breaking up a lot of the monopolies strangling American innovation and holding back workers and wages establishing the FTC, Income Tax, conscription, the Federal Reserve among other Federal oversight boards.\n\nI have become interested in the period between 1890 and 1920, the period when the U.S. stepped upon the world stage. This was a nice educational filler for part of that period, 1914-1920.\n\nJuly 21, 2023\n\nA decent overview of Wilson's career, necessarily limited by its brevity (presumably a requirement for the series). Brands exhibits some blind spots (for example, at one point he seems to be assuming that authoritarianism is exclusively (or even primarily) a problem of the right wing of the political spectrum). He elides some of Wilson's less attractive characteristics (for example, his self-righteousness, which was exhibited during Wilson's tenure as president of Princeton), and does not pay enough attention to dark side of Wilson's progressivism--the conviction that the Constitution was not equal to the challenges of the industrial age and the 20th century, and that the checks and balances of a republic were an impediment to efficient decision-making by experts.\n\nPerhaps that is an inherent limitation of a series like this--there is a temptation to hagiography, or at least to portray the subject in the best possible light. This is not a terrible introduction to Wilson, but is (inevitably) limited.\n\nJune 25, 2018\n\nWoodrow Wilson's first term as President may have been one of the best terms by any President. The numerous reforms and progressive legislation that was passed ranks Wilson as one of the most effective Presidents. What Brands brings out in this small biography is that his expertise was in domestic politics. His knowledge of foreign affairs was not as well versed and mistake after mistake would be made. What compounded Wilson's problems would be his idealistic rhetoric. He created a reason to fight in The Great War that could not be fulfilled by mortal politicians. Much of Wilson's rhetoric and idealism would come to fruition during World War II and after. Both for good and bad. Wilson's idealism at this particular moment in history gave him an impact that is still being felt. H. W. Brands is one of the best historians around and this very small biography is a great introduction into Woodrow Wilson.\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\nI read this book after having finished an excellent biography of Edith Wilson by Rebecca Boggs Roberts. In Ms Roberts book, President Wilson was portrayed as very dependent on both his wives, so I wanted to be able to compare portrayals. In Mr Brands biography of Mr Wilson, the President’s reliance on Edith was downplayed except for the time after his stroke. I think both books provide a more complete picture of their relationship.\n\nThis biography was intelligently written and extremely interesting. I gained a much greater understanding of WWI and the aftermath, which as we all know now, led to WWII.\n\nPresident Wilson was portrayed as a highly intelligent progressive and a somewhat naive politician ill-prepared for leading a relatively young country into a global war. At times the biography came across as a PR piece, especially as Wilson’s racism was barely mentioned.\n\nOverall, a thought provoking and compelling read.\n\nOctober 17, 2017\n\nA comprehensive biography of President Wilson. An academic who studied politics and then got the chance to actively participate. A southerner by birth who never came to terms with his racist upbringing. He was also an idealist who foreshadowed the global cooperation to prevent and deter world wars. His League of Nations concept may have prevented World War II if it had been successful. However, a debilitating stroke put him on the sidelines just when his persuasive oratory powers were need to pass the treaty. In a time without radio or television, he remained president until the end of his term, about 17 months, while his inner circle kept the his condition from the public. It would take another world war for his vision to become reality as the United Nations.\n\nMay 29, 2024\n\nThis is a brief biography of Woodrow Wilson. It is part of a series, The American Presidents. When an author is limited on length, it is interesting to see what they choose to highlight. Here Brands centers on the Versaille Treaty and the League of Nations. The Federal Reserve, Federal Trade Commission, income tax, the invasion of Mexico, Federal Trade Commission are among the many events that occurred during his administration. They are summarized here. There a couple of paragraphs acknowledging Wilson's racism. Brands includes many quotes from Wilson's writing and speeches which give the reader a view of the man.\n\nJune 7, 2020\n\nSergeant Joe Friday often said, \"Just the facts mam\" on \"Dragnet\". That's what this book is: Just the facts. It's like an extended encyclopedia article. But Brands is an excellent writer and historian. He quotes many of Wilson's speeches and writings. The book is well footnoted and there is a bibliography for further reading about Wilson's life. It serves as an fine introduction to the strengths and weaknesses of Wilson's personality as well as the events that he helped shape.\n\nOctober 30, 2020\n\nHow is this asshole going to write an entire biography on Woodrow Wilson and not mention that he won a Nobel Peace Prize!?!!? Or that the League of Nations still became a thing.\n\nIn any case, I think as I thought prior to reading this book that Wilson deserves further study. I just didn't have 1,000 pages in me for this guy. I left wanting to know more about how it all played out, so on the second swing I may try to work in something that will shed more light on WW.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nDecember 2, 2019\n\nI’d have given this a four if it had more about Wilson himself. However, it does offer a good amount of his time as president and a lot about WWI. A brief intro to the actual man. His involvement with trying to make the League of Nations was interesting. His first term went well, but his second term didn’t do so well. Unfortunately, he grew ill and couldn’t do as much as he wanted.\n\nOctober 11, 2021\n\nAnother good book in the American Presidents series. I continue to enjoy the series. It was an interesting look at one of the early progressive presidents (as far as I know). Woodrow Wilson definitely seemed like an interesting character in general. Overall, I would continue to recommend the series, this book included.\n\nFebruary 16, 2019\n\nAn interesting and short primer on Wilson. Brands is a thorough writer and historian and enjoyable read. The level of detail here is pretty shallow, but it gives you a nice image of how Wilson rose, fell and his legacy is remembered.\n\nDecember 6, 2021\n\nFor Wilson to enter the Presidency with only an academic background was catastrophic and fortold his idealistic train wreck when confronted with reality. We should have expected no less a failure than Wilson delivered.\n\nDecember 11, 2022\n\nI understand the mission of this series is to give you a short biography of each President however there is just too much going on in Wilson's life. I love H.W. Brands and will read all his books but I need to read another Wilson biography to really capture more that happened while he was alive."
