        "text": "After his election, President Wilson attended ten baseball games in town to watch the Washington Senators play. He threw out the first pitch on Opening Day in 1913, when they played the New York Yankees, a team that was appearing with that name for the first time.\n\nOn October 9th of 1915, President Wilson went to see the second game of the World Series, the first ever Fall Classic game attended by a president. Here again he threw the opening pitch. The Phillies played against the Boston Red Sox in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, Wilson missed the only appearance by a young “Babe” Ruth in the first game of the series. The President was accompanied by a woman he had recently started seeing, Edith Bolling Galt, along with her mother."
