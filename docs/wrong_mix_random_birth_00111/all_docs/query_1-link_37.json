        "text": "“We are not put into the world to sit still and know,” Wilson had told his students back at Princeton. “We are put in it to act.”\n\nAnd therein lies the reason Wilson matters most today: advocating domestic or foreign policy, he knew it was not enough for a president merely to propose, no matter how compelling his oratory. Like Barack Obama, he faced increasingly hostile partisanship; unlike Obama, he used every form of persuasion in his power, especially the practice of sustained dialogue.\n\nPresidents earn their places in history not simply through their vision and eloquence but, ultimately, through their actions—what they accomplish when they take their feet off the desk and enlist support in their causes. No act in Woodrow Wilson’s life provides a greater window into his character—or a greater lesson for our current president—than his journey in the last days of summer 1919, when he embarked upon the most quixotic venture in America’s history since its founding—a 29-city barnstorming tour by rail to enlist the American public in his plan to end all wars.\n\nThe following is adapted from A. Scott Berg’sWilson.\n\nAn unexpectedly jaunty Woodrow Wilson—in his straw boater, blue blazer, white trousers, and white shoes—strode through Washington’s Union Station that Wednesday evening, September 3, 1919. The presidential car—called the Mayflower—was attached to the rear of a Pennsylvania Railroad train and came configured with a sitting room, which doubled as a dining area, and then a bedroom for the First Lady, which connected to that of her husband. Beyond that was an “office,” with a table on which sat the president’s typewriter. Finally, there was a compartment for Edith’s maid and another for Dr. Grayson. Ahead of the Mayflower was a string of baggage cars, a diner, and Pullman cars to accommodate Wilson’s four stenographers, seven Secret Service agents, and the largest press corps ever to make a presidential tour. Because radio was still in its infancy, Wilson would rely upon those two dozen representatives of the media—journalists, still photographers, newsreel photographers, and an official from the Western Union Telegraph Company—to capture him as he attempted to gain the support of the people for his treaty. The train pulled away from the station a little after seven P.M.\n\nNo president had ever gone to such lengths for a cause. Candidates in the past had campaigned for their own political fortunes; 62-year-old Wilson was sallying forth across America purely for an ideal. The next 27 days were meant to showcase the quintessential Woodrow Wilson, who believed oratory suffused with reason, emotion, and depth of character could convert a nation.\n\nThe quest began inauspiciously the next morning at 11, when the Mayflower arrived under gray skies in Columbus, Ohio. A local streetcar strike kept many away, and the morning rain doused the spirits of some who ventured downtown, but Wilson found a capacity crowd of more than 4,000 waiting for him at Memorial Hall, where close to 2,000 people had been turned away. Despite a headache, he touched upon most of the salient aspects of the treaty and reminded his audience of the reason they had gone to war. This treaty, he said, sought “to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history.” By one o’clock, the Mayflower was heading west.\n\nBig crowds gathered at the small stations along the way, and Wilson stood on the rear platform to shake hands. In Richmond, Indiana, he delivered a short speech about the treaty: “The extraordinary achievement of this treaty is that it gives a free choice to people who never could have won it for themselves. It is for the first time in the history of international transactions an act of systematic justice and not an act of grabbing and seizing.”\n\nIn St. Louis, thousands of schoolchildren, each waving an American flag, lined a five-mile parade route as the president rode to Convention Hall. Recharged by an overflow crowd of close to 20,000 cheering citizens, Wilson walked from the back of the hall to the stage to deliver one of the most ebullient and bare-knuckled speeches of his life. “I came back from Paris bringing one of the greatest documents of human history,” he said, before spending the better part of the next hour proving as much. He clarified that the treaty was “in spirit and essence … an American document,” since American principles had penetrated to the hearts of the peoples of Europe and their representatives. Most significant of all, he said, was the Covenant of the League of Nations, which substituted consultation and arbitration for “the brutal processes of war.”\n\n“I have come out to fight for a cause,” Wilson said, leading with his prominent chin. “That cause is greater than the Senate. It is greater than the government. It is as great as the cause of mankind, and I intend, in office or out, to fight that battle as long as I live.”\n\nOn Sunday the president rested in a hotel in Des Moines. He had garnered banner headlines in the nation’s newspapers his first five days on the road. Articles initially spoke of Lodge as having taken the lead in the early innings of this great debate, but now that Wilson was swinging for the fences, the shift in the country’s mood was palpable. An overnight Republican survey in Missouri revealed that the president had flipped the state from anti- to pro-League. Edith Wilson noticed that the waves of approval helped calm her husband’s nervous energy and headaches. With friendly crowds gathering at every junction, Wilson’s secretary and adviser Joseph Tumulty wanted the president to address them from the rear platform. Here Dr. Grayson put his foot down, as he anxiously knew that each appearance and each bad night’s sleep depleted his patient’s reserves.\n\nAt five A.M. on September 8, the Mayflower rolled into Omaha, Nebraska, and over the next week, it would zigzag north before heading west. The itinerary required as many as four speeches some days, and Wilson tailored each with an unexpected twist or inspiring phrase. He walked onto the stage of the auditorium in Omaha with a prop—a copy of the treaty, so that all could see it was a lot more than the few clauses that had been debated endlessly in the press. “Why, my fellow citizens,” Wilson said, “this is one of the great charters of human liberty, and the man who picks flaws in it—or, rather, picks out the flaws that are in it, for there are flaws in it—forgets the magnitude of the thing, forgets the majesty of the thing, forgets that the counsels of more than twenty nations combined … were … unanimous in the adoption of this great instrument.”\n\n“Sometimes people call me an idealist,” he told an audience at the Armory that night in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “Well, that is the way I know I am an American.”\n\nFight to the Finish\n\nWilson encountered his first political slap of the tour the next morning as his train car waited for the reception committee to arrive at the St. Paul station. Knowing the president was scheduled to address a special session of the state legislature, Minnesota governor Joseph A. A. Burnquist—chairman of the committee and a bitter Republican opponent of the treaty—intentionally detained the group at the Capitol for half an hour, arriving at the station late with neither explanation nor apology. The president of the United States turned the other cheek. Without mentioning a single name, Wilson concluded his address with a word about the reception committees he had encountered thus far. Most, he said, had been made up of Republicans, which gave him great pleasure—“because I should be ashamed of myself if I permitted any partisan thought to enter into this great matter Everybody knows that we are all Americans. Scratch a Democrat or a Republican, and underneath it is the same stuff.”\n\nBy that evening the city was abuzz over Governor Burnquist’s insult. Fifteen thousand Minnesotans jammed into the St. Paul Auditorium and heard the president pay tribute to the soldiers who had fought in the Civil War to preserve the Union. Now, Wilson said, “we come to … the union of great nations in conference upon the interests of peace.” So rousing was Wilson, the mayor of St. Paul leapt to the stage upon the conclusion of the address. “All those in favor of the ratification of the Treaty without a single change will vote Aye,” he shouted to the crowd. And 15,000 shook the hall in agreement.\n\nEach of the next five nights saw the president traveling west on the Northern Pacific Railway. Through North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington, Wilson maintained his breakneck pace, though pounding headaches and asthma attacked him regularly.\n\nBack on Capitol Hill, neither side found any give in this tug-of-war. Primarily to stall any action, Senator Lodge staged extensive hearings on the treaty, the highlight of which was the appearance of William Bullitt, a junior diplomat whose disenchantment with Wilson had led to his resignation from the American Peace Commission, which had represented the United States at the peace talks. For hours—facing Lodge and five Republican colleagues—Bullitt made no effort to disguise his contempt for the Treaty of Versailles. His comments did little damage until he quoted Secretary of State Robert Lansing as having said, “I consider that the League of Nations at present is entirely useless.” Upon learning of Bullitt’s testimony, Lansing offered the press no comment.\n\nThe president—who heard the news from the press corps aboard the Mayflower—did the same, though Tumulty saw that Wilson was “incensed and distressed beyond measure.” Four days later, Lansing telegraphed the president his version of what he had said to Bullitt, a feeble explanation. Wilson summoned Tumulty to his compartment. “Read that,” he said, handing him the wire. No task more pressing awaited the president’s return to the White House than demanding Lansing’s resignation.\n\nThat same morning, Dr. Grayson observed small drops of saliva at the corners of the president’s mouth. His lips quivered slightly, and more spittle appeared. His face turned white. Grayson examined the rest of the itinerary, hoping to edit it. Tumulty disagreed. He knew that the treaty’s great broker was also its most convincing speaker, and Wilson had another 5,000 miles of territory to cover in which he could rally support. By the time he had reached Spokane, on September 12, his voice had weakened and, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported, “there was a suggestion of a man very much fatigued in his delivery.”\n\nWilson soldiered through two full days in the Bay Area. Thursday the 18th finished with a 600-mile ride south. Under the California sun, support for Wilson and his treaty kept growing. Thirty thousand people awaited him in the San Diego Stadium, where he experimented with a new electrical device that Grayson called a “voice phone.” On the speaker’s platform at one end of the bowl stood three sides of a 20-square-foot glass room; the “fourth wall” featured a table with megaphones, from which electrical wires carried the voice to “resonators” at various points in the stadium. Boxed in and dependent upon a mechanical contrivance, Wilson said it was the most difficult speech he had ever delivered. But, except for in one badly wired spot, all 30,000 attendees could hear his 70-minute presentation. It was tempting to think that orators could thenceforth address entire coliseums at once. If only the time had come when a president could use the radio to deliver fireside chats right into people’s homes, Wilson could have conducted an even more effective campaign without any of the physical duress.\n\nTwo hundred thousand people greeted Wilson on the streets of Los Angeles (population: 503,812) the next day—one of the most enthusiastic demonstrations in the city’s history. A capacity crowd filled the Shrine Auditorium to hear him that Saturday night, and the local press was almost unanimously supportive. Veteran newspaperman Charles H. Grasty wrote in The New York Times, “This is Woodrow Wilson country now.” Even Harry Chandler, the fiercely Republican publisher of the Los Angeles Times, admitted that the majority of Southern California was pro-League, by as much as six to one. The consensus among the press was not just that Los Angeles had been the climax of the tour but that the president had swung the national debate in his favor.\n\nOff the Rails\n\nOn Sunday, September 21, 1919, Wilson began his journey back to the White House, via Sacramento, across the Sierra Nevada. While he was suffering from asthma and headaches, the 600 miles of tracks that day cut through forest fires and burrowed through tunnels in which smoke mingled with train exhaust. By then, headaches, coughing spells, and throat irritation interfered with what little sleep he was getting, and the latest news from Washington was sure to ruin the rest. Senator Lodge had invited his Republican colleague Porter J. McCumber, a “Mild Reservationist” from North Dakota, to lunch at his house. By the time the meal ended, McCumber had agreed on a significant reservation to Article X of the Covenant, one that several Democrats came to support as well. The president fumed but proceeded to brave stifling halls in Salt Lake City and Cheyenne. In their room at the Brown Palace Hotel after their late-night arrival in Denver, Edith suggested a break in the schedule for a few days of rest. “No,” Woodrow replied, “I have caught the imagination of the people. They are eager to hear what the League stands for; and I should fail in my duty if I disappointed them.” The next morning, the president delivered a rousing speech to 12,000 people, and before lunch the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway was transporting him to Pueblo, a city of 50,000, for a two-hour visit. Although 10,000 people waited to hear him at the Fair Grounds, Wilson chose only to ride around the racetrack and wave his hand, conserving his strength for the main address, in the city’s new Memorial Hall.\n\nSecret Service agent Edmund Starling accompanied the president from the car to the auditorium, and Wilson stumbled on the single step at the entrance. Starling caught him and kept his hand on his arm as he all but lifted him up a few more steps to the speaker’s platform. Wilson did not object—which surprised Starling, as the president had always refused even the suggestion of physical assistance. “This will have to be a short speech,” Wilson indicated to the gang of newspapermen who were about to hear variations on his themes for the 40th time. “Aren’t you fellows getting pretty sick of this?”\n\nAs Wilson rose to speak, his weariness showed, especially in the weakness of his voice, but his frailties only enhanced the emotion of his message. For the first time, the reporters heard him falter on a line, having to re-start it more than once, and unexpected pauses suggested both mental confusion and physical exhaustion. Starling was so concerned he remained poised to catch the president should he collapse. He recalled Wilson’s passion on this occasion, his working himself to tears as he spoke of the primary beneficiaries of this treaty—“the children ... the next generation.”\n\nBack at the train, Wilson complained again that his head ached. The pain had not stopped all day, sometimes blinding him. When the president heard that crowds were forming at each station in Colorado, he remained awake, finding 5,000 people at Rocky Ford. Grayson extended Wilson’s apologies to the crowd for not being able to appear, but just before the train pulled away, Wilson emerged to grasp the hands of those closest to him. He waved good-bye and then retired for the night.\n\nEdith repaired to her room, where her maid brushed her hair and gave her a massage. At 11:30, by which time she thought her husband had fallen asleep, he knocked on their connecting door and asked to see her. She found him sitting on the side of his bed, his head pressed against the back of a chair set in front of him. The pain had grown so unbearable, he asked her to summon Grayson. The doctor arrived and found a man in the middle of a breakdown. He was nauseated; his face twitched; he gasped for air in the worst asthmatic attack of the trip. Wilson complained that the walls of the tiny compartment were closing in on him. Duty now demanded that Grayson recommend canceling the rest of the tour, which Wilson begged him not to suggest. In the hostile political climate, he knew that his enemies would pounce upon his cessation as a sign of weakness. He told Grayson that he would be better by Wichita and that any further discussion of aborting the trip would only keep him awake the rest of the night. Sometime around 4:30, while sitting upright in his seat, Wilson fell asleep.\n\nDr. Grayson promptly awakened Tumulty, to apprise him that continuing the trip could have fatal consequences. The two advisers conferred with Mrs. Wilson, who had just endured what she called “the longest and most heartbreaking” night of her life. As they were all of the same mind, Grayson waited for the president to awaken, at which time he would explain their decision. But when he entered the president’s compartment, he found Wilson shaving, with no intention of abandoning the schedule. Edith and Tumulty expressed their opinions, but the president would not listen. “Don’t you see that if you cancel this trip,” he explained, “Senator Lodge and his friends will say that I am a quitter and that the Western trip was a failure, and the Treaty will be lost.” Tumulty assured him that nobody would ever consider him a quitter. Gradually, Wilson faced the truth.\n\n“My dear boy,” the president said, crumbling, “this has never happened to me before. I felt it coming on yesterday. I do not know what to do.” His left arm and leg had numbed. Looking at Tumulty, he begged for a 24-hour reprieve, a postponement: “I want to show them that I can still fight and that I am not afraid.” Privately, Grayson argued, at last, that Wilson owed it to the country as well as to Mrs. Wilson and his children to “stop now before very serious developments should occur.” Now, too exhausted even to fight back, the unhappy warrior allowed, “If you feel that way about it, I will surrender.” And then, he quietly added, “This is the greatest disappointment of my life.”\n\nEDITH WOULD FIND HERSELF PRACTICALLY RUNNING THE COUNTRY AND BEING CONSIDERED THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT.\n\nGrayson beckoned Tumulty back into the room. “I don’t seem to realize it,” Wilson told him, “but I seem to have gone to pieces. The doctor is right. I am not in condition to go on.” Unable to face anyone, he looked out the window at the flat countryside instead, as tears rolled from his eyes. “He accepted the decree of Fate as gallantly as he had fought the fight,” Edith recollected, “but only he and his God knew the crucifixion that began that moment—to stretch into interminable years, during which the seal he put on his lips, never to … voice a syllable of self-pity or regret, remained unbroken.”\n\nTumulty sprang into action, calling for a stenographer and composing a statement for the press. It said that Dr. Grayson had insisted upon the cancellation of the rest of the tour—Wichita, Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Memphis, and Louisville—despite the president’s “earnest desire to complete his engagements.” From the rail-yard sidings in North Wichita, the newspaper correspondents raced to find telephones so that they might break the news to the world. After making most of the arrangements for the direct departure back to Washington, chief clerk Thomas Brahany went to the president’s compartment. He found Wilson sitting alone, slouched over, “with his head hanging and with one side of his face drooping and with saliva running out from the corner of his mouth.”\n\nThe president was up and dressed at 11 o’clock that Sunday when the train finally reached Washington—exactly 48 hours since Wichita. Although he looked like a ghost of the man who had left Union Station 25 days earlier, he summoned his strength and walked unassisted and perfectly erect from the Mayflower. His daughter Margaret ran through the train shed to greet him and waited as he bid farewell to the railroad personnel and newspapermen. She joined Edith, Grayson, and the Secret Service as they advanced toward the motorcars waiting outside. Within minutes the president was back in the White House. Grayson ordered him to bed at once—for a “complete rest” of indefinite duration; but Wilson wandered the long hall of the second floor, back and forth between his study and Edith’s room. As it was a sunny early-autumn day, with the first smack of cool air he had felt in months, he and Edith and Grayson took a two-hour drive through the city parks. The president dozed most of the time.\n\nBy October 1, his third day home, Wilson displayed small signs of improvement. He catnapped at night and during his daily drives, and his appetite was returning. He expressed renewed interest in his work, though Edith arranged to run motion pictures at night in the East Room to divert him. That night he felt chipper enough to play billiards for a few minutes. Later, he insisted on reading Scripture to Edith, as he had done every night during the war, and she delighted in hearing some vitality back in his voice.\n\nEdith had been having troubles of her own getting through the night, as she awakened frequently in order to monitor her husband’s rest. At dawn on October 2, she found him sleeping soundly, but then, around 8:30, he was sitting on the side of his bed, reaching for a water bottle. As she handed it to him, she noticed his left hand had gone limp. “I have no feeling in that hand,” he said. He asked her to rub it. But first, he wanted help in getting to the bathroom. She supported him as he staggered those few yards, but it required a huge effort on his part. More terrifying to her were his spasms of pain with every step. Edith asked if she could leave him alone long enough for her to telephone Dr. Grayson. He said yes, and in that split second, Edith made a curious decision.\n\nInstead of going to the nearby bedroom phone, which connected to operators at the White House switchboard, she hastened down the hall to a private phone wired directly to the desk in the Usher’s Room. Ike Hoover answered the call, and Mrs. Wilson said, “Please get Doctor Grayson, the President is very sick.”\n\nWhile still on the phone, Edith heard a noise from the president’s apartment. Rushing back, she found her husband lying on the bathroom floor, unconscious.\n\nFelled by a stroke, Wilson had to rely on his supporters to get the treaty passed; but in March 1920, it met its death on the Senate floor. The Wilsons left the White House one year later but remained in Washington, where he died on February 3, 1924."
