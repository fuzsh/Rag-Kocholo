        "text": "Reviews of the Day: 1924–25\n\nInsights from “Woodrow Wilson” by William Allen White\n\nThis Author’s Thoughts and Perceptions​\n\nReviews of the Day: 1924–25\n\n“There will undoubtedly be a wide variety of opinion as to the essential biographical merits of William Allen White’s new book. … The quality of absolutely impartial detachment is hardly to be expected as yet in the summation of a career so recently brought to a close [Woodrow Wilson had died just six months earlier]. Or of a character and his manifestations in purpose and deed that have not yet emerged into the clear white lights of true historical perspective.\n\n​\"The literary artistry of the thesis of the author has been worked out—the fascination of style, fancy and glowing expression; the play of humor, satire, and western breeziness of opinion.\n\n“Lovers of good literature will … find ample room for concord [agreement or harmony] of appreciation.”\n\nThe Wichita Falls Record News, November 26, 1924, p. 4\n\nInsights from “Woodrow Wilson” by William Allen White\n\n- The Psychological Analysis of Woodrow Wilson and His Supporters and Enemies​\n\n“His partisans have idealized his virtues and so have sought to create a superman—some sort of Heaven-sent Messiah to redeem a wicked world from its iniquity. His enemies—alas they have seen his weakness through the green and red glasses of envy and hate, and a fine old striped devil they have made of him.\n\n​\n\n“He was neither God nor fiend, but in his political career rather a shy, middle-aged gentleman with the hoar frost of the cloister upon his public manner, with an academic respect for facts, and with a Calvinistic addiction for digesting the facts into his own God-given truth.\n\n​\n\n“On the surface he was half or two-thirds Irish, and so turned to his friends a gay and lovely face. But the dour Scot, big and dominant inside him, turned to his adversaries a cold and implacable heart that transformed even the most amiable of his opponents into ardent foes with a lust for torture.”\n\n- The Mind Was Right but Political Instincts Were Needed\n\n“That first-class mind, in which he had so much vain pride, had a sorry time in those days of his first administration as he made mistakes and rectified them. He changed always from the worse to the better. … It was lack of experience, chiefly, that hampered him.\n\n​\"Experience was forever teaching him new things, rather obvious things, which many politicians old in the game knew by instinct.”\n\n- Woodrow Wilson Fought World War I in the “Upper Zone”\n\n​​“If the material world has added new terrors to burn and break and crush the human body, the same world has shown us a new engine of conquest: the words of a righteous man spoken in the passion of a great exhortation.”\n\n- Woodrow Wilson’s Place in History: The League of Nations\n\n“Woodrow Wilson’s place in the history of the world will not be determined by his character. … The relation between character and fame is not of first importance. … Alas, for predictions which are fathered by our desires and mothered by our hopes, fame does not come when a man’s fellow citizens summon it to him. Whether or not Wilson will live as a world figure depends, not so much upon what work he has done as upon what the chance of time and circumstance will do with his work [The League of Nations]. …\n\n​\n\n“He must live or die in world fame bound up in the League of Nations. If that stands, he may tower beside it as the Washington of a World Federation. If the League of Nations crumbles … then Wilson will become one of the host of good men who spent their zeal striving for futile things.”\n\nIn 1925, one reviewer commented that “It will take someone who was much more intimately associated with Wilson to lift the veil of obscurity that has forever hidden the real man.” For William Allen White, the person who lifted his veil of obscurity was Ray Stannard Baker—in 1931, seven years later.\n\n​\n\nThus my thoughts.\n\nThis Author’s Thoughts and Perceptions\n\n​Ray Stannard Baker had complete, unhindered, and open access to all of Woodrow Wilson’s letters and memoranda for his work. Mr. Baker also had a long relationship with the former president including serving as his press secretary in Europe at Versailles.\n\nHere is what William Allen White wrote after reading Stannard Baker’s Woodrow Wilson: Life and Letters Volume IV and V. Which one more time, for emphasis stake, was written seven years after the publication of this book.\n\n“He has written … what all the world should read—especially by skeptics such as I was before reading these two volumes.”\n\n​William A. White, The Pittsburgh Press, December 20, 1931\n\nI don’t think that one biographer could pay another biographer a stronger compliment than to write that the work of a peer has: “Changed my view.” It is also a testimony to the character of William Allen White that he put this in writing in the general press. My estimate of Mr. White’s character was already high after reading some of his other works, but it went up another notch after reading his 1931 revelation.\n\nMr. White’s book is a recommended read, but after reading the statement above, I think he would say, “You should read Ray Stannard Baker’s masterpiece first: Woodrow Wilson: Life and Letters—and this author would concur. I have learned from the interaction of these two very reputable authors and the works they produced, that access to the personal letters and files when writing a biography is truly important.\n\nI wish I had such access to Thomas J. Watson Sr.’s letters during his lifetime such as Ray Stannard Baker had to Woodrow Wilson’s. Maybe then I could produce a few volumes of work that would have a similar effect on other researchers and historians as Ray Stannard Baker’s work had on William Allen White—at least those individuals of character and integrity.\n\nIt is amazing that I was challenged more by Mr. White’s observations written seven years after this work, than the work itself. Such is the divergent, ever-fruitful path of studying history—for truths rather than just facts. Here is how William Allen White was viewed by his peers in journalism, and what he said at the time when he was drafting this biography.\n\n​“William Allen White is in ability too big a man to be intensely partisan. There have been numerous occasions in the past eight or ten years when Mr. White has found it difficult—in the extreme, to maintain his partisan equilibrium. In fact, there have been times when his sympathies were so strongly for measures opposed by his own party that they were noticeable to the public and he was practically aligned against the Republican Party [Republican Party of the 1910s and 20s] in everything except on election day, when he deposited his ballot.\n\n“William Allen White said the following about his upcoming biography on Woodrow Wilson:\n\n“ ’I’m trying to write a kindly and sympathetic biography of Woodrow Wilson, whose aims I have always believed in, though I sometimes despised his methods. I would make the world’s worst President, and I may make the world’s worst biographer, but that will be a calamity suffered only by my readers.’ ”\n\nThe Cass County Democrat, March 27, 1924, p. 10​"
