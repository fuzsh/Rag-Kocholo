        "text": "ISBN: 9780743298094\n\nNew York, NY: Simon & Schuster, 2018. First Edition. Hardcover. Signed by Patricia O'Toole. \"President from 1913 to 1921, (Woodrow) Wilson set a high bar for himself and the country. No president believed more fervently in the primacy of morality in politics or the \"moral force\" of ideas. The Moralist measures Wilson by his own standards while recounting his unprecedented success as an economic reformer, his grand vision for a peaceful world order, his moral blind spots (on race, women's suffrage, and free speech in wartime), and a final defeat that was largely self-inflicted. The Moralist is a cautionary tale about moral vanity and the limitations of leadership that strays too far from political realities. But it is also a tale of the enduring power of high ideals.\" (from front flap) The acclaimed biography of Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), the 28th President of the United States during a crucial period in American & world history that encompassed the First World War, which Wilson steered the USA into entering in order to famously \"make the world safe for democracy.\" The author, Patricia O'Toole, is a popular American historian & academician who has also written well-regarded works on Wilson's predecessor Theodore Roosevelt & other subjects. With a section of captioned historical photographs & more throughout, extensive notes & bibliography. Among the laudatory quotes by distinguished American biographers on dust jacket back cover is this by Douglas Brinkley: \"The Moralist is a brilliant and vital biography of Woodrow Wilson. With surgical precision (O'Toole) analyzes Wilson's intellectual greatness, military cunning, and evangelical fervor aimed at promoting global democracy after World War I. Every chapter crackles with first-rate scholarship.\" Hardcover in unclipped dust jacket, \"First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition April 2018\" as stated on copyright page, first printing as indicated by number sequence thereon. On the title page, below printed title, O'Toole has hand-written her signature in bold black ink. From the collection of George V. Buehler (1933-2020), who was a prominent real estate developer & collector in Massachusetts & Arizona. We found & have retained, between blank rear endpaper & paste-down, two printed-out documents relating to Buehler's purchase of this volume during May-June 2018, both folded once horizontally & in very fine condition with only a few tiny bumps, creases at edges & corners. A highly important & rewarding collectible of American Presidential biography, in its rarest original form with very scarce author's signature & distinguished provenance. Book in very fine condition with only a bit of wear & some small, light smudges to esp. front, back covers & spine (with gilt lettering, graphics on spine completely bright & intact); a few tiny bumps, creases at edges & corners of same. Interior very fine with only tiny bumps & very short, faint creases at esp. lower corners of some page leaves. Dust jacket very fine with only some tiny bumps, creases at edges & corners of front, back covers, spine & flaps. An extra handling fee will be added for shipping due to the weight of this item. Very Fine / Very Fine. [Item #4968]"
