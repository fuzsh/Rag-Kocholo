He particularly enjoys hiking, cycling, adventure travel, playing his banjo and guitar, singing with friends, writing, and working with spreadsheets. His favorite color is blue, like the sky and the ocean.\n\n“Retirement is that incredible time of life, a new stage of life, where you can pursue the things that give you the greatest meaning, you can do those things you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t, and where you can repair or let go of those things that are undone. The good news is this is your time to do what you want, and the bad news is that time is not on your side. If not now when? If not you, who? This is the time to create the life you’ve always wanted.”\n\n- Tom Wilson"
