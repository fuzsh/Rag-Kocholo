        "text": "\"Curtis is easy to work with, professional with fair pricing. Him and his team are extremely efficient and cleaned up nicely after doing our roof. The roof came out beautifully and he color matched to our newer roof over our garage perfectly! Would recommend for sure.\"\n\n- Sarah Francisco | August 15 at 10:53 AM\n\n\"Curtis and his team just completed a new floor in my kitchen and dining area, and took a wall down between the two areas. It is very apparent Curtis takes great pride in his work. They did a phenomenal job. We are very happy with the final results. They were prompt, meticulous, and cleaned up after themselves. I will definitely use Curtis and his team for future jobs. We were highly impressed snd would recommend them to anyone!\"\n\n- Lori McCallum Hardiman | May 1\n\n\"Curtis and team are very talented and super professional! I had my roof shingles replaced and the original clapboard/cedar shake siding removed and vinyl siding installed. They were very fast and the job came out amazing! Curtis was always a phone call/text away if I had questions during the process. I would highly recommend Cycle Carpentry for any of your home improvement needs!\"\n\n- Nathanel Dubois | May 21\n\n\"I can’t say enough great things about this company! We were on a really tight timeline leading up to our open house and a friend recommended Cycle Carpentry. After explaining the situation Curtis went above and beyond to help us out. Professional, great communication, beautiful work, fair & transparent pricing, and the guys were friendly & sweet to my kids. All around great experience. THANK you!\"\n\n- Cait Lieneck | March 17\n\n\"I had my roof done and Curtis was very professional and knowledgeable during the whole process. He was always there when he said he would be. The guys worked very hard and did an awesome job. They did the roof in one day and worked from the time they got there at 7am until the roof was finished at about 5 pm. They cleaned up prior to leaving and picked up all nails from the yard. The price was great and I was very pleased when it was completed. Thank you Curtis and crew!! Looks great!!\"\n\n- Jean Barron Delisle | March 1\n\n\"Curtis and his team are awesome! The re - roofed our house last Wednesday. Very professional, friendly and fast. Cleaned up amazing after they were done. He even came back the next day and cleaned up the drive way after they picked up the dumpster!!\"\n\n- Katharina Wood | October 13\n\n\"This was the best experience I’ve ever had with a contractor...Cycle Carpentry will give you a great price, quality work and talented employees. My roof looks beautiful and I look forward to getting some other projects done now that I have a company I can trust.\"\n\n- Richard D. Ryan | September 18, 2020\n\n\"Curtis Perry and his crew from cycle carpentry resided my entire beach home in Humarock. They matched the shed and installed a cape cod shower.In addition they installed a new roof with ice and water shield. Work was impeccable crew was professional and timely. After completion I secured a contract to reside home in Stoneham Ma. install 2 windows and redo entire deck to make maintenance free. I highly recommend Curtis as he listens carefully develops a plan and does the job as he states in the contract. Honesty and superior craftsmanship are hard to find but I was completely satisfied with his work. If you want a great job done at a fair price call Curtis at Cycle Carpentry.\"\n\n- Bill McCabe from Stoneham, MA | June 25, 2019\n\n\"Needed a new roof and got 4 estimates. Curtis was by far the best contractor that we met. No pressure, able to explain the process and his attention to detail amazing. His crew was great. Any future projects at my home will be completed by Cycle Carpentry.\"\n\n- Tina Marie | March 10, 2019\n\n\"Fast and professional services. I had a roof put on, no hassles. The quote was spot on and affordable. It's been a couple of years since the service and we are dry and safe. Not one nail found in my gardens. Thank you!\"\n\n- Eddy Murray | March 12, 2019\n\n\"Absolute class act. curtis and his whole crew did an amazing job on our vinyl siding project at our house. very honest and their work is just incredible. i would definitely recommend these guys to anyone. will definitely hire cycle carpentry again for any further projects at my house.\"\n\n- Manuel Arruda Parece IV | March 10, 2019\n\n\"We got our kitchen done in 7 days we are very happy with our final result... Curtis was always very clear on what was going on and super on time with everything... I will highly recommend Cycle Roofing and Carpentry, they have a very professional and honest team.\"\n\n- Adriana West | February 14, 2019\n\n\"I had already planned to have my house done over with siding,new windows and a deck....kept getting excuses from the person who was to do it....after waiting forever,I called Curtis and he came down gave an estimate and I was sold on him to see me thru this project. I believe he and his crew started like a week or so after talking to him! I can't tell you how pleased I was with him AND his great crew! They cleaned up every day! When talking about the deck I wanted,he suggested that I just might want to consider a roof over it. So...He had me sold on it and it came out great!! I had to understand that he can envision the outcome so I let him do it...best decision,ever...! His crew was hard working and can't say enough about them,too! As well as being professional,he is also a great guy! Thanks Curtis\"\n\n- Judy Curreri | March 10, 2019\n\n\"Curtis and his crew at Cycle Roofing & Carpentry did a great job replacing our roof recently. Even though the job ended up being more work than they had anticipated (lots of unseen mold, incorrect vents, etc), the team still finished the job in 1 day. Curtis was always helpful with keeping us updated and we are very pleased with our new roof.\"\n\n- Tammy Saylor | July 15, 2018\n\n\"Curtis and his crew at Cycle Roofing & Carpentry did an outstanding job replacing our roof. They were very professional and efficient in their duties. They showed great pride in their work and the quality of the job shows. Curtis was quick and very knowledgeable about the products they install . I am very pleased with the final results of my roof.\n\nCraig & Kristine\"\n\n- Craig Nightingale | May 23, 2018\n\n\"Called Curtis Perry to look at our ridge vent today. He came and told us exactly what was needed to be done. He was worried about the heavy rain predicted for tomorrow. He came back and fixed the problem SAME DAY!! When does that happen ever? He was 100% professional, knowledgable with good prices. We would highly recommend him and his company for any projects. Thank you Curtis.\"\n\n- Ellen Bessette O'Brien | September 17, 2018\n\n\"We are very impressed with the excellent job Cycle Roofing provided on our new roof. We own half a duplex and they were able to do our half only and it looks amazing. It was a two day job. The attention to detail was awesome, not only did they do an amazing job on the house roof, they also did the roof on our shed so now everything matches. The crew left the area clean and neat. I highly recommend this company.\"\n\n- Candy O'Loughlin | August 1, 2017"
