        "meta_description": "Sure by Ash &amp; Eric, released 06 May 2022\n\n1. Until My Heart Grows Quiet\n2. Do Something\n3. In My Head\n4. Church of the Concrete Wave\n5. Simon, Taylor, Denver, Cash\n6. Autumn Hymn\n7. Sure\n8. Never Walking Out\n9. The Dogwood &amp; I\n10. Simon, Taylor, Denver, Cash (2020 Single)\n11. Until My Heart Grows Quiet (2020 Single)\n\nAsh &amp; Eric weren’t so “Sure” in 2020. As the year battered down and destroyed most of what they held dear, the married couple hung tightly to their last tattered thread. Until, finally, they just let go. Disillusioned by religion, their own relationships and even their career, they walked away from everything that hadn’t been working for so long and they started telling the truth. \r\n\r\nAfter spending most of their lives searching for meaning &amp; fulfillment in external places – work, success – having it all taken away meant they had to finally ask themselves, “What or who is going to save me?” \r\n\r\n“Sure” is an album for leaving, losing and everything you find when you do. If Ash &amp; Eric’s final record released under their previous moniker The Promise is Hope, “Every Seed Must Die” (2018) was about dusting themselves off after tragedy, “Sure” sees Ash &amp; Eric walking away from the wreckage. \r\n\r\nAs COVID dragged on and continued stripping Ash &amp; Eric of their relationships and work, the couple started to get more “Sure” of a few things: their love for each other, their desire to make great music &amp; their own ability to heal and find hope. This album is a return home – to nature, to truth and to themselves. \r\n\r\nIn the pure assuredness of their own abilities &amp; strength, Ash &amp; Eric set out to make this record entirely themselves. They first attempted to record it in their tiny apartment in Worcester, MA, battling the constant sound of sirens outside and vacuuming neighbors overhead. In the summer of 2021, a friend offered them her music classroom at a boarding school in Western Massachusetts. The record was recorded in one month and was arranged, produced &amp; recorded entirely by Eric himself.",

        "text": "1.\n\nThere’s a river that runs from the border of Canada Down the east of Vermont, the west of New Hampshire Right through the center of a state that gave me a home And that river, it runs through the city of Hartford And if you followed it south, you’d find the place I was born Right at its mouth, where it rips into the Sound And I’ve followed that river every mile From the north as a woman, the south as a child It taught me to carve my path through the wild And with it, I’ll run - run - run Until my heart grows quiet There’s a highway that runs from New York to Boston And, in a week, this old car has driven it twice Through sun, sleet and ice, I’ve been on it all my life And I’ve followed that highway every mile Counting the exits since I was a child It taught me to carve my path through the wild And with it, I’ll run - run - run Until my heart grows quiet… (Will it ever grow quiet?) Oh, I’ve followed that river every mile Been running from something since I was a child But it brought me to you, so I’ll stay here a while And with you I’ll run - run - run With you, I’ll run - run - run With you, I will run - run - run Until my heart grows quiet\n\n2.\n\nDo Something 05:41\n\nSuspended, above me unreachable light I’ve kicked and clawed like a junkyard dog But I’m the loser in this fight Below me, the door to the endless night A blackness seen in a cold sweat dream But there’s no waking from this fright I have given it all I got Holding tight to my last thread If you don’t do something now This’ll be the end I had dreamed of so much more Seen it flash before my eyes If you don’t do something now This’ll be goodbye Did you hear me? I’m screaming in my head I’ve maybe moments left And I’m going down I said, did you hear me? My heart is ripping through my chest This can’t be my last breath Oh am I going down? I have given it all I got Losing grip on my last thread If you don’t do something now This’ll be the end I had dreamed of so much more Seen it flash before my eyes If you don’t do something now This’ll be goodbye Is this goodbye? Is this goodbye? Oh my god Oh my god I’m hanging on by a thread And I’m broken from trying to bend I see how this one will end As all your defenses crumble again I didn’t wanna walk away But you’d rather fight than face up to the pain I’ll no longer carry the weight I see through the lie that I was to blame And you never hear me And I ain’t got nothing left I’ve given you my last breath So if you want to go down Well, I’m not going down\n\n3.\n\nIn My Head 03:59\n\nI think that you think I forgot about you Forgot about all of the years that I knew you But every time I step up to the line Where the ocean meets the land I remember all you showed me, All you taught me and all that you owe me I remember wearing white & holding your hand I think that you think I don’t think about you That I never wonder what you have been up to But every time that I hear a man lie about The size of the fish that he caught I remember and I feel an ache in my heart I don’t know how to tell you We always left it unsaid Oh, I love you I just love you in my head I know that you think I don’t care about you Truth is, I never came back to see you ‘Cuz every time I cross that county line I’m afraid of what you won’t say And I remember how that silence drove me away I don’t know how to tell you We always left it unsaid Oh, I love you I just love you in my head And I don’t know if I will ever go Back to our home, back to the loneliest Place I have ever known I don’t know if I’m ready, don’t know If I’m steady enough To drive down that road But I’ll carry the memory with me Wherever I go I don’t know how to tell you We always left it unsaid I don’t know how to tell you Maybe it’s better unsaid Oh, I love you I just love you in my head\n\n4.\n\nIn the center of town stood a beacon of light A church with a steeple all painted in white But for a handful of outcasts, the true sacred space Was the wall on the sidewalk with the smooth granite face In the afterschool hours, we’d mount for a ride It was wood, wheels, and thunder, there was nowhere to hide As our feet pound the pavement to answer the call To barrel our boards across that old granite wall With no chapel and no ordained leader No choir or sacred song meter Just a sect of lost souls seeking to be saved Found peace in the church of the concrete wave Jojo, his father couldn’t put down the bottle So he moved like an engine stuck in full throttle And I can see now he just wanted to fly The adrenaline hit was just his way to get high Justin, he lived with his sister and mother None of us seemed to know what had become of his father With red Gatorade and a bag full of weed He said his board and a good beat were all that he’d need There was Benjamin, he lived in a park full of trailers Out on the back side of town, they hid society’s failures He used words unexpected on a body so small And his tricks, they were perfected on that old granite wall With no chapel and no ordained leader No choir or sacred song meter Just a sect of lost souls seeking to be saved Found peace in the church of the concrete wave ‘Cause in small towns like ours You have saints and you have sinners And children are born to both the losers and the winners And pain gets passed down From the old to the young Like a package too heavy For any to carry My father and I drifted apart We became strangers in a house plagued by anger So I rode to that sidewalk and prayed to belong Those boys & their skateboards, and that old granite wall With no chapel, no ordained leader No choir or sacred song meters, no Just a sect of lost souls seeking to be saved Found peace in the church of the concrete wave The church of the concrete wave\n\n5.\n\nSimon, Taylor, Denver, Cash 05:06\n\nThe first time I heard “Graceland”, my heart fell on the floor It stole my breath and shook me to the core Now every Friday night I play it in another crowded bar ‘Cause I think we all need grace no matter how drunk we are Simon, Taylor, Denver, Cash - these songs can make me cry But no one's really listening in a dive at ten at night But it pays okay and it’s hard to say “no” to a little dough Still, I’m driving home and I never felt so low Some nights you sing for no one in the corner of a bar Some nights you sing for hundreds who all know who you are It can be hollow as a raindrop, it can thunder, it can fill And applause can even pay a couple bills The first time that they cheered for me my heart went to the sky I never knew there was a drug that could get me this high So I’ve been working hard for hits of it since I was thirteen But no one ever taught me how to wean Tonight we played in Boston in this legendary place There’s a picture of Joni Mitchell from the 70’s backstage We sold out every seat in there, and we played a perfect show Still, I’m driving home and I never felt so low Some nights you sing for no one in the corner of a bar Some nights you sing for hundreds who all know who you are Man, it can heat you up like whiskey and go straight to your head But applause, it cannot warm your bed Ooooooh Maybe one day, thousands will know all of my songs And we’ll come back to Boston and they will all sing along Or maybe I’ll have children and I’ll write them lullabies Either way, I’ll do this ‘til I die Maine to Carolina through sunny fields and snow Driving back on Christmas Eve all the way from Buffalo Now, if you ask me if I would, I think that I’d do it all the same ‘Cause if you don’t know how to give, well then you don’t know how to gain Some nights you sing for no one in the corner of a bar Some nights you sing for hundreds who all know who you are And I just drove a million miles and I wanna go home ‘Cause applause cannot save my soul This applause, it cannot save my soul Oooooh\n\n6.\n\nAutumn Hymn 04:44\n\nIn the cool of the Autumn sun I turn to the howling wind And ask her of her mournful song Where does her pain begin? She does not pause to answer me With words I can record But with a melancholy movement She cuts me to my core As her lonesome lilting lifts Her voice grows clear and crisp Rousing the tops of the towering pines Entranced by her influence They sway in perfect unison In empathetic time I lay amongst their sturdy legs As tears fill up my eyes I remember a simpler time Though distant in my mind A world laid out in black and white With neatly painted lines Where stories tell how the good ones win A just and righteous war But like a soldier sobered by the fight I can’t believe them anymore I’ve felt a darkness so complete Shake the ground beneath my feet And tear into the things I love Like a wolf with gnashing teeth The sorrow burns within in my soul Like a bush set all ablaze Is there nothing I can stand upon That will not fall away? Then a voice from above The haunting hymn of a dove Calling out o’er the whipping wind “Breathe in deep, and listen in.” She sings a song for every sadness A song for every pain A song for every brokenness That cannot be explained I’ll gather them inside my heart Like seeds carefully sown They will grow into a tower of light A shelter from the storm They will grow into a tower of light A shelter from the storm\n\n7.\n\nSure 03:32\n\nOur love is the blanket on top of the sheet That gets kicked around all night at our feet With our pushing & pulling, our giving & taking A comforter heavy with down Some nights, it’s the pillows that cradle our heads But end up crushed between the wall & the bed But we wake with the light and we straighten the blankets And fluff out the pillows again Darling, I’m sure as the morning Sure as the kettle that sings out its warning I’m sure as an addiction to caffeine You know I’m sure As sure as I’ll ever be Our love is a theory tested and tried The scientists all said the numbers weren’t right And we all believed them, the church even paid them To tell us the earth wasn’t round But darling, I’m sure as the seed That grew in the apple that fell from the tree Yes, I’m sure, as sure as gravity You know I’m sure As sure as I’ll ever be Our love is the anchor I often ignore Taking for granted our home by the shore But you never lift it, so we never drift Into the heart of the storm Darling, I’m sure as the moon Waxing and waning from July to June Yes, I’m sure as the tides of the sea You know I’m sure As sure as I’ll ever be\n\n8.\n\nNever Walking Out 04:13\n\nShe gave us six months when she claimed our young love was doomed But she didn’t give a smile when we married in her living room I was only 16, pregnant with our first of three Well now, six decades later, you’re still waking up here next to me I was dogged as a dandelion, tell you what, it’s in my roots When they say it can’t be done, sure as hell, that’s what you’re gonna do You were sweet as honey, and handsome as you were cool Just like a bear to the honey, babe, well I couldn’t keep my paws off of you If love is a chain, ours is made of iron Passed through the flame, hardened in the fire I made you a promise, and that’s just what I’ll do My word is good I’m never walking out on you It ain’t always been easy, it ain’t always been a dream come true I almost drove right off a ledge just to keep me from murdering you I’m glad you turned that car around, and you cried out to the Lord above He gave me a shot of strength, and a heavy dose of stubborn love If love is a chain, ours is made of iron Passed through the flame, hardened in the fire I made you a promise, and that’s just what I’ll do My word is good I’m never walking out on you Looking back on our winding path With its twists and turns, its peaks and valleys Step by step we have made it through Cause you chose me, and I chose you And I still do A day is bound to come when one of us will fall asleep But don’t waste your time thinking I made a promise that I couldn’t keep This bond is eternal, it reaches past the gates of time I’ll be waiting with a smile when you wake beyond that great divide If love is a chain, ours is made of iron Passed through the flame, hardened in the fire And I made you a promise, and that’s just what I’ll do I’m a woman of my word, and I’m gonna follow through I’m a man standing on his word, Lord, and you know I spoke true My word is good I’m never walking out on you I’m never ever ever ever ever walking out on you\n\n9.\n\nThe Dogwood & I 04:16\n\nWon’t you bury me ‘neath the dogwood tree Pointed east toward the rising sun Take comfort, dear Let it bring you cheer The dogwood & I will be one Each and every spring Birds will come to sing Alighting on my branches What is truly me Will never cease to be My form will be all that changes As the spring gives way To the summer haze I’ll watch flowering fields grow tall And life's brevity On display for me As they’re cut short in the fall When at autumn’s end As my leaves descend I’ll surrender each one, knowing That my naked limbs Will bare buds again As the birds resume their thronging So when you’ve buried me ‘Neath the dogwood tree Pointed east toward the rising sun Take comfort, dear Let it bring you cheer The dogwood & I Are now one\n\n10.\n\nThe first time I heard Graceland, my heart fell on the floor It stole my breath & shook me to the core So every Friday night I play it in another crowded bar ‘Cause I think we all need grace no matter how drunk we are Simon, Taylor, Denver, Cash - these songs can make me cry But no one’s really listening in a dive at 10 at night It pays ok and it’s hard to say no to a little dough But I’m driving home and I’ve never felt so low Some nights, you sing for no one in the corner of a bar Some nights, you sing for hundreds who all know who you are It can be hollow as a raindrop, it can thunder, it can fill And applause cah even pay a couple bills The first time that they cheered for me, my heart went to the sky I didn’t know there was a drug that could get me this high I’ve been working hard for hits of it since I was 13 But no one ever taught me how to wean Tonight we played in Boston in this legendary place There’s a picture of Joni Mitchell from the '70s backstage We sold out every seat in there and played a perfect show Still I’m driving home and I’ve never felt so low Some nights, you sing for no one in the corner of a bar Some nights, you sing for hundreds who all know who you are It can heat you up like whiskey that goes straight to your head But applause, it cannot warm your bed Maybe one day thousands will know all of my songs And we’ll come back to Boston and they’ll all sing along Or maybe I’ll have children and I’ll write them lullabies Either way I’ll do this ‘til I die Maine to Carolina, through sunny fields & snow Driving home on Christmas Eve all the way from Buffalo If you asked me if I would I think that I’d do it all the same 'Cause if you don’t know how to give, then you don’t know how to gain Some nights you sing for no one in the corner of a bar Some nights you sing for hundreds who all know who you are I drove a million miles and I wanna come back home ‘Cause applause it cannot save my soul Applause it cannot save my soul\n\n11."
