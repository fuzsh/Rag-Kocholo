        "text": "Published Research\n\nA review of published studies in the area of client outcomes and organizational variables will be presented next. Only research published in the last 10 years was examined. Earlier research tended to examine, primarily, the effect of new nursing care delivery models such as primary vs. team care. In the majority of these studies staff outcomes, including the process of care, were considered to be of primary significance and client outcomes were seldom addressed. More recent studies, like those at the invitational conference, were conducted due to the nursing shortage and attempted to increase retention of nurses. Relatively few national studies with large samples have been reported.\n\nAs with treatment effectiveness research, there exists a body of literature related to specific nursing interventions and the effect of these interventions on individual client outcomes. Most of these studies are directed at patients with specific diagnoses and will not be reviewed in this paper. However, five meta-analyses of many of these studies have been conducted and may be of interest (Mumford et al., 1982; Devine and Cook, 1983; Smith and Naftel, 1984; Hathaway, 1986; Heater et al., 1988).\n\nThe following sections report on the results of published research that is related to more generalized client outcomes. The primary outcomes that have been examined in the literature are mortality, nosocomial complications, adverse incidents, service utilization, and patient satisfaction. Although there is a beginning attempt to examine health status on discharge and postdischarge, this research is not summarized in this paper for several reasons. First, there are few studies that include nursing variables as predictors to changes in health status. Second, health status is conceptualized in a variety of different ways, from the very abstract to very specific measures related to specific diagnoses. Third, even when the same variable is conceptualized (e.g., functional status) it is measured in such a variety of ways that comparisons are difficult.\n\nMortality\n\nThe literature on the variables influencing severity-adjusted mortality rates is extensive. When considering qualities of nursing services that influence this variable, two areas are pertinent. Studies have consistently found that the proportion of RNs on the nursing staff or the total number of RNs will have a positive influence on mortality rates. Prescott (1993) has done a complete review of this research base and it will not be detailed further.\n\nMore pertinent to the research reported at the invitational conference is the second aspect of nursing that has been shown to have some effect on mortality. These studies have taken place in the critical care setting and indicate that the level of interdisciplinary collaboration has a positive influence on mortality. This finding was originally reported by Knaus and colleagues (1986) and was supported by the original Critical Care Nurses Association Demonstration Project (Mitchell et al., 1989). More recent findings by the same team as the original research (Zimmerman et al., 1993, 1994) failed to support the original result. The Seattle critical care study described at the invitational conference also failed to find a relationship between units that were closer to the ideal level of practice and adjusted mortality rates.\n\nIn an extensive investigation, Aiken and colleagues (1994) reported a strong relationship between the nursing organization found in magnet hospitals and lower adjusted Medicare mortality rates. The hypothesis was also tested that decreased mortality rates were a result of staffing mix, which is traditionally richer in magnet hospitals. No evidence was found to support the contention that skill mix or the proportion of RNs was the key variable in affecting mortality. Instead the authors conclude that the mortality decrease (5 deaths per 1,000 Medicare discharges) stems from ''… the greater status, autonomy and control afforded nurses in the magnet hospitals, and their resulting impact on nurses' behaviors on behalf of patients.—i.e., this is not simply an issue of the number of nurses, or their mix of credentials.\" (Aiken et al., 1994, p. 783). This finding was not supported in the studies that examined mortality and were reported at the invitational conference. In these cases, there were no difference in mortality rates on the high professional practice units and nonprofessional practice units.\n\nComplications\n\nFlood and Diers (1988) examined two general medical units with differing staffing levels to determine the effect of staffing on patient complications. The most frequently occurring complications were infections, heart conditions, and gastrointestinal disorders. They found that the mean number of complications per patient was higher on the \"short-staffed\" unit than on the unit with adequate staffing. Both generalized infections and urinary tract infections evidenced the greatest difference between units, with rates being almost double those of other complications. For this research, staffing was determined by an index of required staff hours (based on patient acuity) to actual staff hours. Data confirmed that one unit in the study was consistently below the staffing level required while the other was at or above that level. No data were found that indicated that patients were different in terms of age, gender, and diagnosis-related group (DRG) between the two units, although some evidence was found that acuity on the short-staffed unit was slightly higher. This higher rate could have been due to either the increased level of complications or simply the type of patient.\n\nMore recently, Taunton and colleagues (1994) reported on research that examined the effect of three organizational variables (absenteeism, unit separation, and work load) on nosocomial infections. This study took place in 4 large Midwestern acute care urban hospitals for a total of 65 patient care units in the sample. Specific units within the sample included 15 critical care units, 5 telemetry units, 22 medical-surgical units, 6 pediatric units, 6 obstetric-gynecological units, 4 long-term care/rehabilitation units, and 7 other (type not specified) units. Findings supported a relationship between patient infections and staff RN absenteeism. No other organizational variable evidenced a significant relationship with the outcome variable.\n\nBoth of these studies indicate that nurse staffing has some effect on the incidence of nosocomial infection rates. These increased rates were also associated with increased length of hospital stay in the Flood and Diers (1988) research. Disruption in the continuity of care due to absences and inadequate staffing were cited as reasons for the increased incidents of infections.\n\nOther research has examined the effect of practice models on complications. Mitchell and colleagues (1989) found that complications related to infections, immobility, and fluid balance represented nonresolution of problems on admission to the intensive care unit rather than new problems. Brett and Tonges (1990) in a one-unit pilot evaluation of the ProACTTM Model at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital found no increase in nosocomial infections despite the planned decrease in the number of RNs.\n\nTwo of the intervention studies reported at the invitational conference also included nosocomial infections as part of their research. Neither study found a significant relationship between infection rates and any other included study variable.\n\nAdverse Incidents\n\nAdverse incidents that occur during hospitalization include errors in medication delivery (wrong patient, wrong drug, wrong dose, wrong route, wrong time), patient falls, treatment errors, and skin injury or breakdown. Again, two of the demonstration projects included these items in their research model with no significant findings. The study by Taunton and colleagues (1994) cited earlier also examined the effect of organizational variables on patient falls and medication errors. No significant associations were discovered.\n\nA comprehensive investigation by Wan and Shukla (1987) examined the relationship of contextual and organizational variables with the quality of nursing care. Contextual variables were considered to be attributes of the hospital and region that are beyond control of the hospital. Organizational variables include structural and design variables. Only the design variables are amenable to change. These variables include the nursing care delivery model, staff skill mix, and staffing levels. The patient incidents included in the study were rates of medication errors, patient falls, patient injuries, and testing or treatment errors. Forty-five community acute care hospitals were included in the study. Results indicate that the independent variables did not account for a large portion of the variation in incident rates. Nursing skill mix, nursing model, and nursing resource consumption were not significantly related to any of the dependent variables. The authors suggest these findings support an earlier study that found that the most significant nursing variable affecting the quality of nursing care was nursing competence. This research1 was unavailable for review. A further explanation may involve the interrelatedness of patient factors, hospital support systems, and nursing variables. Even though a support system index was included in this research, the interaction effect with nursing variables was not examined. Of significance, however, is the fact that patient age had the greatest impact on falls and that age, along with acuity, were the two significant variables in the regression of patient injury on contextual and organizational variables. This suggests that patient characteristics are the most influencing factor for the occurrence of adverse incidents and any research examining these factors should control for the risk of injury.\n\nCurrently, there is no evidence to support the belief that nursing variables are directly associated with adverse hospital incidents. There is some suggestion that nursing competence has an effect on quality.\n\nService Utilization\n\nPrimarily, the research on the relationship of nursing to service utilization has concentrated on types of care delivery systems rather than staffing variables. An exception to this is the article by Flood and Diers (1988) that found that although total length of stay adjusted by DRG was similar between the two study units, two specific DRGs showed differences in length of stay. Patients within these DRGs (GI hemorrhage [174] and CVA [14]) had longer length of stays on the short-staffed unit and, in addition, developed more complications during their hospital stay.\n\nBrooten and colleagues (1986) designed a clinical trial to examine the effect of nurse specialist care on early discharge of low-birthweight infants on selected patient outcomes. The experimental intervention included early discharge of low-birthweight infants meeting specific criteria, to be followed by master's prepared nurse specialists for 18 months after hospitalization. Random assignment resulted in 39 infants in the experimental group and 40 infants in the control group. Groups were equivalent on a number of demographic family variables and infant treatment variables. Findings showed that the experimental group was discharged a mean of 11.2 days earlier that the controls and that there were no differences in rehospitalizations, acute-care visits, failure to thrive, child abuse, foster placement, or developmental quotient of infants. There were also no differences in outcomes for the mothers.\n\nResearch on the case management system at Carondolet St. Mary's Medical Center also has found that the content of nursing care has an impact on length of stay. The nursing delivery system at this facility involves a network of home care, hospice, community wellness centers, and hospital nursing with a nurse case manager bridging community and in-hospital care. Case managers, prepared at least at the bachelor's level, are the hub of the health care delivery system. Ethridge and Lamb (1989) report on the effects of the nursing case management intervention with patients who received total hip replacements and those with respiratory disease. For the first group, length of stay was reduced by 2.1 days while it was reduced by 3.5 days for the second group. The authors hypothesize that the reduction for acute illness (hip replacement) occurs at the end of hospitalization and that case management allowed earlier discharge of these patients. For the chronically ill (respiratory disease), length of stay appeared to be reduced at the beginning of the hospitalization. Those patients who were case-managed prior to hospitalization entered the hospital at lower acuity levels and shortened their length of stay by seeking care before illness severity reached a level that would require longer hospitalization.\n\nA further report by Ethridge (1991) examines more than 700 case-managed patients enrolled in a health maintenance organization's senior plan. The data for the case managed clients were compared with national and state statistics for Medicare patients and health maintenance organization service use statistics. Results indicate that the case-managed patients had 53 fewer annualized hospital admissions, 895 fewer bed-days, and an average length of stay 1.73 days lower than other Medicare patients in the state.\n\nTwo reports by Naylor and colleagues (Naylor, 1990; Naylor et al., 1994) examine the effects of gerontological nurse specialist care. This care primarily involved a discharge planning protocol for hospitalized elders that was implemented by clinical nurse specialists while the client was hospitalized and 2 weeks after discharge. The earlier manuscript reports on the pilot study for the full project and included 40 hospitalized patients, age 70 and older, who were randomly assigned to the discharge planning or control group. No statistical differences were found in initial hospital length of stay or posthospital infection rate. However, there were significant differences in the number of rehospitalizations during the 12 weeks after discharge. In the larger, second study, 276 patients were included. Findings indicated that patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions and fewer total days rehospitalized than the control group. No differences were found between the surgical intervention group and the control. Again, there were no differences in initial hospital length of stay.\n\nStudies such as those described above indicate that nursing care does have an impact on the utilization variables of length of hospital stay and readmission rates. However, the research has more to do with the practice pattern of nurses than with the mix of staff or staffing ratios. These studies also indicate the advantages of nurses in specialized advanced practice. Unfortunately, no research has been reported that describes such practice patterns with less well educated staff to determine whether results would be similar.\n\nMethodological Note\n\nResearch on the utilization of health care services has included primarily the variables of readmission and length of hospital stay. Continued use of these variables, particularly hospital length of stay, is problematic due to increased implementation of critical paths and prospective payment that essentially predetermines length of hospitalization. What appears to be of greater significance in the future is a measure of episode of illness that would include both length of stay and readmission.\n\nPatient Satisfaction\n\nMany studies that examine models of nursing practice also investigate the effect of these models on patient and family satisfaction. Both Burnes-Bolton and colleagues (1990) and Brett and Tonges (1990) report the results from one nursing unit. The first report notes increases in satisfaction, while the second indicates that two measures of satisfaction remained stable. This latter finding has some significance since the practice model implemented included a decrease in the number of RNs and an increase in unlicensed personnel. However, the data presented from both studies are considered pilot work from only one involved nursing unit.\n\nLamb and Huggins (1990) in another report of the Carondolet nurse case management system also reported increase in patient satisfaction over time. The study by Mitchell and colleagues (1989) previously mentioned under the heading of \"Mortality\" also noted higher levels of patient satisfaction in the ideal critical care environment.\n\nIn a 1985 publication, Koerner and colleagues (1985) report the results of the implementation of a system of professional nursing practice through collaboration with physicians. The system contained the five interrelated parts as specified by the National Joint Practice Commission in 1977: a joint practice committee of physicians and nurses; primary nursing; nursing clinical decision making within the scope of nursing practice as defined by the joint practice committee; integrated patient records; and joint practice review. Again this study contained only one demonstration unit and one control unit. The sample included 280 patients (100 from the control unit and 180 from the demonstration unit). The researchers evaluated patient satisfaction with a self-developed instrument designed to measure patient-provider interaction, quality of care, health education, knowledge of practitioners, and environment of the unit. Patients from the collaborative practice unit reported significantly greater patient-provider interaction, provider knowledge, health education, and respectful treatment. No differences were noted in patient satisfaction with the physical environment or expectations of care. The authors note a limitation to the study in that the satisfaction instrument was designed with an emphasis on items pertinent to a collaborative practice environment and results may be biased toward the positive evaluation of the experimental treatment.\n\nThese research studies tend to indicate an increase in patient satisfaction with the implementation of a more professional model of practice, which is consistent with that previously described as part of the magnet hospital studies. However, there is also some indication that satisfaction remains stable even when the mix of nursing staff is altered to fewer professional nurses and more unlicensed personnel.\n\nMethodological Note\n\nThe popularity of patient satisfaction as an outcome measure is reflected in the number of instruments that have been developed for evaluation and research purposes (McDaniel and Nash, 1990). While there are many ways to measure patient satisfaction, not all are accurate or reliable. Specifically, the construct validity of many instruments designed for individual studies is questionable. Often, it appears that patients are being asked to evaluate quality of care rather than their satisfaction with that care. A further limitation of patient satisfaction with nursing care as an outcome measure is that patients traditionally report high levels of satisfaction, thus decreasing the variability of responses that are needed for analysis (LaMonica et al., 1986). Measures of satisfaction that are clinically feasible for use because of their parsimony often lack the sensitivity required to tap fine differences in patient perception.\n\nRelationship of Staff Satisfaction to Client Outcomes\n\nMuch of the research investigating factors to increase staff nurse satisfaction makes the assumption that increased levels of satisfied staff will directly lead to increased quality of care. Two projects have examined this relationship as their primary hypothesis and will be described here, even though one of the studies occurred prior to the 1985 review date.\n\nHolland and associates (1981) examined resident mental health patients and staff from 22 units in 3 psychiatric hospitals. Of the eligible staff, 98 percent (N = 297) were included in the analysis. However, exact titles and preparation were not delineated in the report. Sixty-eight percent (N = 249) of the total patients were selected with stratified random sampling to be included in the study. The focal unit for this research was the nursing unit and when individual data were aggregated to that level an analysis sample of 22 resulted. The outcome examined was potential posthospital adjustment as measured at discharge by a standardized scale. Improvement in resident functioning was moderately associated with staff satisfaction. Greater staff participation in resident treatment affected the outcome only indirectly through staff satisfaction. The total effect of staff satisfaction, using path analysis, was .55 (.38 direct and .17 indirect).\n\nA 1985 publication by Weisman and Nathanson (1985) reported on a study of teenage clients who attended 1 of 77 family planning clinics. Although this research does not involve the acute care setting, findings may still be pertinent. The 77 clinics involved in the research represented data from 344 nurses and 2,900 clients. Outcomes investigated were client satisfaction and rate of compliance with contraceptive prescriptions. Using path analysis, a significant direct effect (.32) of job satisfaction on client satisfaction was discovered. There was no direct effect of this variable on compliance rates. However, there was a significant indirect effect (.08) of job satisfaction on compliance through client satisfaction. Hays and White (1987) reanalyzed the Weisman and Nathanson (1985) data using structural equation modeling with LISREL. They supported the model proposed in the original study and proposed an alternative model that also fits the data. Both models supported the significant relationship between job satisfaction and client outcomes.\n\nOf the four studies at the invitational conference that were also looking at the relationship between staff satisfaction and outcomes, none reported significant direct or indirect relationships. However, final data analyses were not completed for all of the studies.\n\nA Brief History Of Nursing Education\n\nTo understand the present, one must always have some sense of the past. The first \"modern\" school of nursing was founded in 1860 by Florence Nightingale at St. Thomas Hospital in London. A little more than a decade later, the first schools in the United States to build on her curriculum and philosophy (i.e., put patients in the best situation for nature to heal) came into existence; they were associated with Bellevue Hospital in New York City, New England Hospital for Women and Children (which became Massachusetts General), and New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. Hospital diploma schools were a boon to their institutions, since student nurses provided most of needed patient care as inexpensive apprentices. By 1900, an infrastructure for nursing education was taking shape; the American Society of Superintendents of Training Schools (which became the National League for Nursing), the Nurses Associated Alumnae of United States and Canada (which became the American Nurses Association), and the American Journal of Nursing had all been founded.\n\nThe demanding working conditions soon contributed to a shortage of student applicants. In an attempt to de-emphasize apprenticeship training, nursing schools began to be affiliated with academic institutions. The earliest university-based nursing education took place at Howard University, Teachers College of Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, what is now known as the University of Texas at Galveston, Rush Medical College in Chicago, and the University of Minnesota, which in 1909 became the first university to have an official school of nursing. By 1920, 180 nursing schools reported having college affiliations (Goodnow, 1937).\n\nIn 1922, Sigma Theta Tau, nursing's honor society, was founded at Indiana University with the expectation that the baccalaureate degree was to be required for entry into professional practice; this has yet, however, to become the agreed-upon norm for the field. The 1920s saw the formation of two committees—the Committee on the Study of Nursing Education (1923) and the Committee on the Grading of Nursing Schools (1928)—that issued reports on themes that would concern nursing for the remainder of the twentieth century: the standardization of nursing education, restriction of the supply to ensure adequately paid work, and distribution and specialization of the aggregate work force. The 1930s were a period when hospitals expanded and private duty nursing declined, as the sick were unable to pay for home care because of the economic depression.\n\nTwo reports in the 1940s were to sound once again the theme of the need for standardized nursing education. The Brown Report (1948), considered to be \"the nursing equivalent of the 1910 Flexner Report in medicine\" (Friss, 1994, p. 604), urged that only college graduates be regarded as truly professional. That same year, the Committee on the Function of Nursing (1948) recommended upgrading standards for both the licensed practical nurse (LPN) and the registered nurse (RN), the former with an associate degree and the latter with a bachelor's of science in nursing (BSN) degree. In 1951, Montag elaborated on the growing distinction between technical training, which was to be established under the ægis of the community college, and professional education, which belonged at the bachelor's level (Montag, 1951). The first associate degree in nursing (ADN) program was started in 1952 at Fairleigh Dickinson University.\n\nPrograms offering ADNs have largely replaced diploma programs in the last four decades (see ), but they became another means of acquiring the RN rather than the LPN (Deloughery, 1977; Murphy, 1979; Fondiller, 1983). Entry into professional nursing practice has been further complicated by the development of generic master's and doctoral programs on the grounds that undergraduate education is foundational to truly professional practice, just as it is for dentistry, law, and medicine (Dolan et al., 1983). For example, the first generic nursing doctorate (ND) was started at Case Western Reserve University in 1979, and there are now three such programs (Watson and Phillips, 1992).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nEntry Into Practice: Nursing Programs, 1950–1990.\n\nGraduate education for nurses, however, first took the form of additional preparation in the functional areas of education and administration as nurse leaders prepared for academic or supervisory roles. The first master's degree was awarded by Teachers College of Columbia University in the 1920s, and that institution also took the lead in doctoral education a decade later. The establishment of programs to develop advanced clinical skills occurred later. By 1949, Yale University Graduate School offered a master's of science in mental health (this program moved to the School of Nursing in 1958). In 1954, Hildegard Peplau founded at Rutgers one of the first master's programs to prepare clinical nurse specialists. The first nurse practitioner program was started a decade later by Loretta Ford at the University of Colorado.\n\nThree phases of doctoral education have been distinguished (Grace, 1978; Murphy, 1985; Hart, 1989). Before 1960, the emphasis was on functional role preparation, because nurses largely needed the EdD degree to develop the baccalaureate and higher education programs that began to be established during those years. In the 1960s, the importance of the PhD for research training gained favor as nurses sought degrees in other disciplines so as to apply that learning in developing the scientific base of their profession. Since the 1970s, the emphasis has largely been on research training within nursing. The clinical research orientation that began to take hold in the 1960s (Wald and Leonard, 1964) reached fruition in 1986 with the establishment of the National Center for Nursing Research, now the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), within the National Institutes of Health (McBride, 1987). That agency is organized to promote study of three general areas: (1) fostering health and preventing disease, (2) facilitating care of persons who are acutely or chronically ill, and (3) improving the delivery of nursing services (Merritt, 1986).\n\nProgram Definitions For Figure 1\n\nLicensed practical nurse (LPN) to associate degree nurse (ADN); LPN to baccalaureate in nursing (BSN); LPN to master's of science in nursing (MSN)—Programs that admit licensed practical nurses and award an associate, baccalaureate, or master's degree in nursing.\n\nGeneric baccalaureate (BSN)—A program of instruction that admits students with no previous nursing education and requires at least four but not more than five academic years of full-time-equivalent college academic work, the completion of which results in a bachelor of science in nursing.\n\nRegistered nurse (RN) to BSN—A program that admits registered nurses with associate degrees or diplomas in nursing and awards a baccalaureate degree in nursing.\n\n\"Accelerated\" option or pathway—Programs that accomplish the programmatic objectives in a shorter time frame than the traditional program, usually through a combination of \"bridge\" or transition courses and core courses.\n\nBSN for nonnursing college graduates—A program that admits students with baccalaureate degrees and with no previous nursing education and, at completion, awards a baccalaureate degree in nursing.\n\nRN to BSN (external degree baccalaureate)—A degree awarded by transcript evaluation, academically acceptable cognitive and performance examinations, or both, without residency and classroom attendance requirements.\n\nMaster of Science in Nursing (MSN)—A program of instruction that admits students with baccalaureate degrees in nursing and, at completion, awards a master of science in nursing.\n\nRN to MSN—A program that admits registered nurses without a baccalaureate degree in nursing and awards a master's degree in nursing.\n\nMSN for nonnursing college graduates—A program that admits students with baccalaureate degrees and with no previous nursing education and, at completion, awards a master's degree in nursing.\n\nMSN for nurses with nonnursing college degrees—A program that admits registered nurses with nonnursing baccalaureate degrees and, at completion, awards a master's degree in nursing.\n\nMSN/master's in business administration; MSN/master's of public health; MSN/master's of hospital administration; MSN/master's of public administration— Dual degree programs that admit registered nurses with a baccalaureate degree in nursing and award a master's degree in nursing in combination with a master's degree in business administration, public health, hospital administration, or public administration.\n\nGeneric Nursing Doctorate (ND)—A generic doctoral program with a clinical focus primarily designed for baccalaureate-prepared college graduates with no nursing experience.\n\nDoctorate—A program of instruction requiring at least three academic years of full-time-equivalent academic work beyond the baccalaureate in nursing, the completion of which results in a doctoral degree that is either a doctorate of nursing science (DNS, DNSc, or DSN) or the doctor of philosophy degree (PhD).\n\nPostdoctorate—A program environment for multidisciplinary research training involving more than one unit of a university and a recruitment plan that will attract the most highly qualified candidates (individuals must have received a doctoral degree) from throughout the nation. In such a program environment the nursing unit has the ability to demonstrate that graduates of the program remain active in research.\n\nNOTE: These program definitions are based on the typology used by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in their annual institutional data survey. regarding the competencies to be developed (Conway, 1983). Graduates of ADN programs, who are on average more mature and experienced at graduation (the mean age was 35.7 years in 1992), have resisted the notion that they were less professional than their younger BSN colleagues (29.2 years old on average). This tension between undergraduate programs is further exacerbated by all of the tensions between community colleges and universities. To the extent that different kinds of RNs are educated in different educational systems, there is little opportunity for learning how to work together.\n\nMatters have been further complicated by the fact that ADN graduates are regarded by the public at large, and especially by many a state legislature, as the success story of community colleges because of their speedy access to a relatively well-paid field. Graduates of BSN programs, in contrast, are regarded as requiring an expensive undergraduate education by universities, which tend to equate professional education with graduate education. Legislators would resist efforts to limit the production of ADN graduates, while some universities may countenance the elimination of BSN programs (as has happened, for example, in the University of California system). The more that RN production is relegated to ADN programs, the more nursing is seen solely in vocational terms by the public, including career counselors, rather than as a career choice for the best and brightest. Nursing is so equated in the public mind with doing procedures and giving medications that nurses who manage complex systems and conduct research are viewed by many as not being ''real\" nurses.\n\nWhat has frequently been confused in ADN versus BSN discussions is the question of whether one is working at the bottom or the top of one's scope of practice. While the ADN and the BSN recipient may look relatively comparable technically and interpersonally at graduation, their progress from novice to competent practitioner, and on to expert, will not be comparable (Conway, 1983). The liberal education that is considered foundational to the development of critical thinking, decision making, and independent judgment in the BSN graduate is likely to facilitate the acquisition of the imaginal and systems skills required of advanced practice (Koerner, 1993). Considerable efforts are under way to articulate a model for differentiated nursing practice; provides a schematic synthesis of current thinking based on the recent AACN-AONE Task Force on Differentiated Nursing Practice (1995) and the work of Davis and Burnard (1992) as well as that of Koerner (1992). It should be noted that a characteristic of recent consensus development in this area has been giving up the technical versus professional distinctions of previous ADN-BSN debates, because of the pejorative implications in characterizing ADN graduates as not professional, in favor of distinguishing between practice in structured and unstructured environments.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nToward Differentiated Practice.\n\nCelebrating 40 years of ADN education, Simmons (1993) noted that that degree is no longer considered to be \"terminal\" in nature, but a pathway for career and educational mobility. Nursing education must move to an interconnected system of distinct educational levels with differentiated outcomes (Fagin and Lynaugh, 1992; Hanner et al., 1993), but do so with pride in the articulations across pathways that are already in place and that build on experience and demonstrated competence (Shalala, 1992). The need to address these issues is crucial, because too many ADN graduates and too few BSN and higher degree nurses are being produced relative to future needs (Aiken and Salmon, 1994). As health care delivery systems become increasingly primary care oriented and boundary spanning, the roles in which nurses will be needed will require more professional judgment and clinical autonomy (Clifford, 1990).\n\nExpectations regarding educational level and competencies for advanced practice nursing roles are also in need of some clarification. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (1994) has taken the position that all advanced practice nurses (APN) should hold a graduate degree in nursing and be certified, and that the American Board of Nursing Specialties should serve as the umbrella board to assist member-certifying bodies adopt professional and educational standards for the evaluation and certification of APNs. The effectiveness of this level of nurse has been documented (Office of Technology Assessment, 1986; Safriet, 1992); APNs provide needed services with consumer satisfaction, demonstrable effectiveness, and significant cost savings (Brooten et al., 1986; Pew Health Professions Commission, 1994a,b). The term APN is used, however, to refer to a number of roles—clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and nurse anesthetists. Nurse practitioners have a history of providing primary health care services, while clinical nurse specialists have traditionally worked with less educated nurses to solve complex care problems, although psychiatric clinical nurse specialists and those majoring in community health or gerontology have also provided considerable first contact care. There is substantial debate as to whether the clinical nurse specialist role, with its systems orientation, should merge with the nurse practitioner role, with its emphasis on delivering primary care, so that the public will be less confused by different titles (Fenton and Brykczynski, 1993; Page and Arena, 1994).\n\nAt the doctoral level, the debate centers on whether the research focus of PhD programs should supplant the clinical focus of professional-degree programs (e.g., a doctorate of nursing science (DNS) program) (Flaherty, 1989; Martin, 1989). Most of the original DNS programs were as research minded as any PhD program; the decision to establish a DNS program rather than a PhD program was often a political decision rather than an academic decision (Downs, 1989). Professional-degree programs were more numerous when graduate schools were not very welcoming and took the attitude that a doctorally prepared nurse was an oxymoron. As the quality of nursing research became established, so, too, did PhD programs in nursing. There is, however, some renewed interest in professional-degree programs as a means of preparing clinical leaders capable of the evaluation research that is needed for a quickly changing health care delivery system (Starck et al., 1993).\n\nAll of the emphasis within nursing education on the spectrum of academic degrees has had the unintended consequence that continuing education (CE) has received comparatively short shrift. Many states do not have mandatory CE requirements for maintaining RN licensure. This state of affairs is particularly problematic because of the knowledge explosion and the many forces dramatically reshaping health care delivery. As with other professions, learning in nursing must be a lifelong enterprise that cannot stop with the awarding of a degree (IOM, 1995).\n\nHealth Care And Academia: Nursing's Advantages And Disadvantages\n\nWith the two social institutions of health care delivery and higher education undergoing such fundamental change, nursing will have distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the reconfigured health care delivery system, nursing has much to offer: a comfortableness about operating within systems; conceptual models capable of analyzing the person-environment fit; a family-centered care focus; a history of interdisciplinary collaboration; community assessment skills; experience with health promotion and consumer education; the ability to span boundaries; a nonreductionist philosophy of care; relationship-centered care (Tresolini and the Pew-Fetzer Task Force, 1994); established links with community agencies and long-term care facilities; long-standing encouragement of functional ability and quality of life; expertise in behavioral outcomes research; and several hundred community-based nursing centers attached to schools of nursing. In a reconfigured health care delivery system, a major advantage is that the cost of educating an APN may be as little as one-third of the cost of physician training, and that nurse practitioner can provide about 80 percent of primary care services at an equivalent level of positive outcomes and patient satisfaction (Pew Health Professions Commission, 1994a,b).\n\nNursing also is disadvantaged in the reconfigured health care delivery system. The downsizing of hospitals is displacing RNs more than any other worker, and those in place may be more prone to burnout because of increased workload (McClure, 1991; Gordon, 1995). Many of the changes that are taking place are not based on tried-and-true principles, but on a frustration with current realities. The downsizing of nursing within hospitals is also taking place at the same time that nurses are being expected to supervise the work of more unlicensed assistive personnel, which is itself a time-consuming task (ANA, 1992). Joel (1994) has noted that coordination of care is further complicated when these assistive personnel are assigned directly to patients as if they operated on their own authority, rather than being assigned to nurses for delegation purposes.\n\nHigh-level strategic planning for fundamental institutional change frequently does not include RNs, yet they are regularly expected to work out the operational details of restructuring, mergers, and consolidations. There is a move in many hospitals to incorporate nursing with other patient care services under a single vice president for patient care services. This has diminished the importance of the nursing director in the senior hierarchy, who was previously comparable to the medical director. Although nurses are best suited to take these new positions, the emphasis has shifted in many institutions away from the patient-care focus of nursing to \"patient-focused care\" which is sometimes used as a rallying cry for providing services at the lowest cost. These trends are disturbing because lower mortality has been associated with a higher ratio of RNs to patients (Hartz et al., 1989; Prescott, 1993) and with nurses having control over their practice (Aiken et al., 1994).\n\nAdvanced practice nurses are typically hired by physicians or administrators to staff a particular service and have no formal ties to nursing service delivery in other parts of the institution, so their connection to their profession can easily weaken over time, particularly if they are utilized only as physician substitutes rather than for their nursing expertise. The danger is that the growing use of APNs may replicate what happened to psychiatric clinical nurse specialists in the 1960s with the development of community mental health centers, when they were used as interchangeable members of the mental health team and consequently forsook nursing's traditional focus on maximizing functional ability in favor of \"doing therapy\" in 50-minute hours. As managed care systems grow in size across state boundaries, they have begun to push for institutional licensure to promote uniform practice, but such a move could further remove individuals from control over their profession's practice. Considerable legal and institutional barriers do exist to prevent reimbursement for nurse-provided primary care, for example, Medicare policies (Inglis and Kjervik, 1993).\n\nNursing may be in a more advantageous position in the universities of tomorrow for a number of reasons. The emphasis on service learning has made the activities of nursing students and faculty much more valued, particularly in those instances in which course requirements or contracted faculty time have benefited participating clinical or community agencies. The areas of scholarship that are being regarded with renewed appreciation—the scholarship of integration, utilization, and teaching—have been areas where nursing faculty have traditionally excelled. Nursing's accrediting body, the National League for Nursing, shifted to an outcomes orientation well ahead of other professional associations.\n\nNursing has a long history of being interdisciplinary; for example, the doctoral preparation of nurses has actively made use of the models of various disciplines such as ethics, education, anthropology, psychology, sociology, public health, and physiology. Nursing has never emphasized just regurgitating facts, but weaving those facts into clinical decision making (Tanner, 1987, 1993). Nontraditional educational methods are not new to nursing (Lenburg, 1986). Distance learning has become a staple in many nursing schools with outreach commitments (Billings et al., 1994). The problem-solving orientation, consensus-building techniques, and interpersonal skills of nurses enable them to demonstrate competencies in great demand across settings.\n\nOn the other hand, nursing is likely to be disadvantaged in the universities of tomorrow. Because it is a field that has come later to research (i.e., the scholarship of discovery), an infrastructure to support that mission within schools of nursing is not fully in place. The current devaluation of research in support of teaching is likely to have more negative consequences for a field that has long valued teaching but only recently made research a priority, for it will be more difficult to get the resources for research in a climate less supportive of that activity.\n\nClinical teaching is labor intensive, particularly when students are spread throughout the community rather than concentrated in a single hospital (Rothert et al., 1994), so universities will be increasingly critical of such costs, particularly in the face of dropping enrollments occasioned by a tight job market. This problem is also likely to be an issue in the merger or consolidation of university hospitals with other kinds of hospitals that are less inclined to believe they should subsidize clinical teaching even indirectly. The demand for master's and doctorally prepared faculty is outstripping supply (Mullinix, 1990; Rosenfeld, 1992); indeed, today's \"nursing shortage\" is at those levels of preparation. What is more, the nature of practice is changing faster than the curriculum of most schools of nursing and the knowledge base of existing nursing faculty (VanOrt et al., 1989; Oermann, 1994a).\n\nCurrent Status Of Institutional Long-Term Care\n\nInstitutional long-term care can be viewed from several vantage points. This section presents data on the number and types of facilities and on the mix of residents cared for in those facilities. Federal and state regulations affecting long-term care and how those regulations affect reimbursement for care are discussed. Finally, staffing issues, including staffing requirements, staff mix and qualifications, the nature of nursing home work, and staff salaries, are described.\n\nNumbers and Types of Homes\n\nLong-term institutional care of elderly residents falls into two major categories: (1) traditional nursing homes, which primarily are facilities that provide either intermediate-level nursing care or skilled nursing care, but might also include \"board-and-care\" residential homes, and (2) recent alternatives to the traditional nursing homes, such as foster care homes, family homes, or assisted-living homes. Numbers of homes are presented to illustrate trends in the availability of institutional long-term-care options.\n\nTraditional Nursing Homes\n\nToday, the primary providers of institution-based care for dependent elders are the more than 20,000 intermediate and skilled nursing homes. Although the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87) eliminated the distinction between skilled and intermediate nursing homes, Title XIX continues to distinguish the two types for reimbursement. According to the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey (NCHS, 1987), 75 percent of nursing homes were proprietary, 20 percent voluntary nonprofit, and 5 percent government operated. Forty-one percent were operated by nursing home chains and about 50 percent were independently operated. Proprietary homes provided 69 percent of the nursing home beds, voluntary nonprofit homes provided 23 percent of the beds, and public homes 8 percent. Eighteen percent of the available beds were skilled nursing, 30 percent were skilled nursing and intermediate level, 28 percent were intermediate level only, and 25 percent were not certified. One-third of the nursing homes had fewer than 50 beds, about another third had between 50 and 99 beds, 28 percent had 100 to 199 beds, and only slightly more than 6 percent had 200 or more beds.\n\nAnother type of traditional nursing home is the board and care home. A board and care home differs from intermediate- or skilled-level nursing homes in that continuous care provided by licensed nurses is not required. Board and care homes outnumber skilled and intermediate nursing homes by more than 2 to 1 in the United States and have an average size of 15 beds (Brown University Long-Term Care Quality Letter, 1994).\n\nBoth nursing homes and board and care homes have high occupancy rates, 91.5 percent and 85.6 percent respectively. However, the 1991 National Health Provider Inventory, mailed to providers and analyzed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), found wide geographic variations in the prevalence of nursing homes versus board and care homes or home care (Brown University Long-Term Care Quality Letter , 1994). The Midwest relied heavily on regular nursing homes, little on board and care, and moderately on home care. The Northeast relied heavily on all three, with much more home health care use than in the other regions. The South showed moderate usage of all three types of care, and the West relied on board and care more than any other region. Nationwide, the study counted 15,511 nursing homes, with 1.6 million beds and 1.5 million residents. While the number of free-standing nursing homes has dropped by 1,644 since 1986, the number of nursing home beds has increased by 60,000—meaning that existing nursing homes are becoming larger.\n\nRecent Alternative Long-Term-Care Models\n\nA number of residential care models have recently arisen in response to the need to develop alternatives to the medical model emphasis in most traditional long-term-care facilities. These alternatives include a range of state-licensed residential living environments such as foster care, family homes, residential care facilities, and assisted-living arrangements (Wilson, 1994).\n\nThese variations in facilities are possible because there are no federal guidelines standardizing long-term residential care, and state regulations vary widely regarding environmental, programming, and nursing care standards, with minimum staffing ratios ordinarily set quite low. Although residential care settings vary in size (ranging from small private homes accommodating up to 4 residents, to large congregate care facilities that may care for more than 100 residents), all offer assistance or care and share with the residents the responsibilities for activities of daily living. Ideally, the care provided is flexible, resident and family oriented, and intended to optimize individual dignity, functioning, health, and well-being. Because these alternative facilities also provide care for demented residents, the physical environment and design features of the facility should support the functioning of the impaired older adult and accommodate difficult behaviors and diminished abilities (Alzheimer's Association, 1994).\n\nAssisted living, for example, is a model of supportive housing that is growing rapidly because of consumer preferences and lower costs than those associated with traditional models of long-term care (Wilson, 1994). The state of Oregon has been a leader in developing standards of assisted-living care for the purposes of licensure and evaluating resident outcomes. Residents are entitled to a private apartment (shared only by choice) that includes a kitchen, a bath with roll-in shower, locking doors, and temperature control capability. Routine nursing services and case management for ancillary services are provided. Data show that residents in these Oregon assisted-living facilities have a remarkably high level of disability: 84 percent have some mobility impairment, 75 percent require assistance with medications, and 63 percent require assistance with bathing. Most importantly, the orientation of staff toward the residents is to empower them by sharing responsibilities, enhancing choices, and managing risks (Wilson, 1994). Because of the lack of regulations and standards, consumers need to question providers about all aspects of services, including the philosophy of care, number and type of staff, staff training, staff supervision, and costs, to determine if resident and family needs will be met.\n\nThe sub-acute unit is another alternative long-term-care model. With the advent of the Medicare prospective payment system and use of diagnosis-related groups (DRG) as the basis for payment in hospitals, older adults began to be discharged \"quicker and sicker\" to nursing homes. In the United States, this early discharge of older adults from hospitals has led to a movement to create sub-acute care units in nursing homes, discussed more fully below in \"Future Demand for Institutional Long-term Care.\" These units do not necessarily focus on frail older adults in the latter stages of life, but are in response to the economic changes affecting hospitals and tend to reinforce a medical model of care (Lyles, 1986; Ganroth, 1988; Swan et al., 1990).\n\nCase-Mix Data\n\nAccording to Fries (1994), case-mix refers to distinctions of residents related to resource use where resource use is primarily defined as a ratio of nursing time to costs. Nursing home residents are a heterogeneous mix of vulnerable adults whose ages may span more than 50 years. Residents are also getting older; those over the age of 85 years constitute about 42 percent of nursing home residents, up from 34 percent in 1980. Despite the dramatic increase in the number of nursing home residents who are age 85 or older, there are more than 181,000 (12 percent) residents under the age of 65 in nursing homes (McKnight's Long-term Care News, 1993). As noted earlier, a high percentage (around 75 percent) of persons who reside in nursing homes are reported to suffer from a chronic dementing process or some form of mental health or behavioral alteration. Most of these residents also have medical and personal care needs that require ongoing staff intervention and support. For example, about half (51 percent) of residents are incontinent of urine. Physical care issues, low staff ratios, regulatory issues, and inadequate staff preparation and training often mean that residents with behavioral impairment are still poorly understood and tolerated in the long-term-care environment (Hall, 1995).\n\nRegulations and Reimbursement\n\nOver the past few years, a paradigm shift has occurred in long-term care—from a biomedical treatment orientation and custodial care approach to a more social-behavioral model of care with a rehabilitative focus (Burgio and Scilley, 1994). However, implementation of a social-behavioral model of care has been constrained by regulations and reimbursement that are still guided by a medical model and by tensions between federal and state jurisdictions for regulating and reimbursing nursing homes.\n\nIssues of staffing and care policies in traditional long-term-care facilities are influenced by a combination of federal and state regulations. Because the federal government is the only payer for Medicare and shares the rapidly increasing payment with states for Medicaid, and because consumer concerns intensified, federal interest in regulation increased and resulted in the passage of OBRA 87. Yet state regulatory groups did not control the development of OBRA regulations and do not have the option to not implement them. The OBRA 87 regulations mandated higher standards for quality care, but federal and individual state reimbursement formulas have not necessarily changed to enable nursing homes to better meet the higher standards.\n\nEnactment of OBRA 87 resulted in regulations that required nursing homes to adopt a more active social-behavioral treatment model for residents. In contrast to an earlier emphasis on facility cleanliness and the physical plant, the new regulations are more resident focused, emphasizing systematic assessment and individual plans of care that foster the highest achievable level of resident well-being. In addition to restricting the use of antipsychotic medications for the treatment of behavioral problems, OBRA also mandated more training for each nurse's aide (a minimum of 75 hours of initial training that addresses psychosocial as well and physical health care, and 12 hours of in-service education annually), as well as assurance of skill competency (Burgio and Scilley, 1994).\n\nThus, with OBRA 87 setting the standard for quality of care in long-term-care facilities, the nursing home industry today is among the most highly regulated businesses in America. Beset with regulations developed in response to perceived abuses and poor quality care, licensed nursing homes are charged with providing care that meets the vast needs of diverse residents, yet often they must try to meet that charge with only minimum reimbursement and inadequate staffing (Hall, 1995). Success or failure to meet the government mandates is evaluated by the facility's own quality assurance programs, as well as surveys conducted by multiple agencies, care review boards, and state ombudspersons who investigate complaints (Hall, 1995). A report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspection General indicates that most states are doing an adequate job of carrying out their survey responsibilities as outlined under OBRA 87. However, survey staff issues, enforcement, and inspections remain problematic, and there is need for improved training of state surveyors and better communication between state and federal surveyors in terms of consistent application of guidelines for quality of care (McKnight's Long-term Care News, 1993). In addition to the surveying difficulties, the lack of attention to how reimbursement affects the ability of homes to meet quality standards is a serious concern.\n\nNationally, there is some movement toward case-mix reimbursement for nursing home care, although most states continue currently to reimburse by capitated cost-based systems—systems that are limited by a cap regardless of the cost to provide the care. Use of this system tends to encourage nursing homes to preferentially accept private pay and minimal care persons, rather than persons whose care is reimbursed by Medicaid.\n\nThe lack of federal regulation coupled with wide variation in state regulations also affects alternative forms of long-term-care facilities and the level of reimbursement available to those facilities. Currently there are few regulations for assisted-living facilities, and reimbursement under Title XIX for assisted living is limited to a few states. Public expenditures for community-based services are relatively small compared to those for nursing home care (O'Shaunessy and Price, 1987). Medicaid, which is the principal source of funding of health care services for low income persons, finances mostly nursing home care and was not designed to support a full array of social and other long-term-care community-based services. A few states provide some reimbursement, but because of a lack of Medicaid reimbursement most deny persons who cannot privately pay for this option. Some, but not all, long-term-care insurance policies cover assisted living and other arrangements alternative to nursing home care. There also is some controversy surrounding reimbursement rates for special care units, because of a lack of data to support whether or not a higher cost of care is justified on these units.\n\nStaffing, Staff-Mix, and Qualifications\n\nOver 1.5 million residents are cared for in nursing homes by 1,200,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees each day, of whom 700,000 FTEs provide some form of nursing or personal care. Nursing aides (designated by the acronym NAs and also referred to in this paper as nurse aides, nurse assistants, and nursing assistants) and orderlies account for over 40 percent of a home's total FTEs. Registered nurses (RNs), on the other hand, make up less than 7 percent of a nursing home's total FTEs and less than 20 percent of a facility's total nursing staff. Of the estimated 1.5 million employed RNs in the United States, fewer than 100,000 are employed in nursing homes (NCHS, 1988). And yet nothing is more important than the characteristics of the nursing staff in terms of determining the residents' quality of life. Staff interaction with residents and the nature of the relationship that develops between them is what matters most to residents, far more than the administrative philosophy or decor of the facility (Kayser-Jones, 1989).\n\nData from the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey (NCHS, 1988) indicated that nursing homes had an average of 71.4 FTE staff per 100 beds, with an average of 5.2 RN FTEs, 7.4 LPN FTEs, and 30.8 NA FTEs per 100 beds. Proprietary homes averaged 4.3 RN FTEs per 100 beds, while voluntary nonprofit homes averaged 6.7 RN FTE per 100 beds and government-operated homes 7.4 RN FTEs per 100 beds.\n\nRegulations are such that very few nursing homes (5.6 percent) have an RN on duty 24 hours a day (Jones et al., 1987). Because available staff are distributed over a 24-hour period, for every 100 beds the average staffing is 1 RN, who is most likely to be the director of nursing, 1.5 LPNs, and 6.5 nurse aides, as compared to a ratio of 1 RN for every 4 patients in a hospital (Mezey, 1992). The median amount of RN time per resident, per day, across all nursing homes in 1985 was 12 minutes or less, and nearly 40 percent of nursing homes reported 6 minutes or less of RN time per resident per day (Jones et al., 1987).\n\nSimilarly, the American Nurses Association (ANA) found staffing ratios of nursing assistants to patients in intermediate-level care facilities to be 1:11, whereas the ratio for licensed nurses was 1:100 (ANA, 1991). Nursing assistants are the primary care givers in long-term care. Consequently, the care that they provide is an important determinant of the quality of life and quality of care for nursing home residents. The typical NA is a 20- to 40-year-old female; about half are members of a minority group, with low socioeconomic status and a high school education or less. Typically, they are paid little more than the minimum wage.\n\nNurse vacancy rates are higher in nursing homes than in other practice settings. Despite recent improvements (in 1993, 70 percent of state nursing home association executives indicated that vacancy rates in their states had dropped to 10 percent or less) (McKnight's Long-term Care News, 1993), nurses still find hospitals a more attractive setting in which to work. RN salaries in nursing homes are about 15 percent lower than salaries for hospital RNs (Maraldo, 1991). While this situation may have changed somewhat, due to greater concerns about hospital costs in recent years, nursing homes continue to compete poorly for RNs because of wages and working conditions. Unfortunately, caring for the elderly is still not considered prestigious or financially rewarding when compared to other areas of nursing practice.\n\nThe OBRA 87 regulations contain no staffing standards except that an RN is to be on duty for 8 of the 24 hours each day. Some homes have obtained waivers that permit them to substitute LPNs. Thus, staffing requirements for nursing homes vary from state to state. In Iowa, for example, two hours of nursing care hours per patient day are required for certified Medicaid residents. This breaks down to only about five minutes per hour, even though the average resident who is unable to feed him- or herself requires about one hour of assistance for each meal provided. If these Medicaid residents who are dependent on receiving help to eat should lose weight continuously over a period of several months, the facility may receive a citation for poor quality care—a real \"Catch 22.\" Some long-term-care providers have successfully sued to become eligible for staffing levels greater than those reimbursed by the Medicaid statute, as was the case with an Atlantic City, New Jersey, nursing home, which argued that the unusual configuration of the facility (three buildings connected by ramps and walkways) required additional Medicaid funds so it could provide adequate staff (McKnight's Long-term Care News, 1993).\n\nAccording to the Select Committee on Aging (1992) in the U.S. House of Representatives, without changes in staffing regulations, the needs of the elderly will remain largely unmet through the year 2020. In their report to the chairman, the committee listed several reasons for a lack of health care personnel trained in geriatrics and gerontology: difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel for direct care in nursing homes, poorly trained workers, little training of family and friend care givers, vague job descriptions, shortages of qualified faculty to teach the needed knowledge and skills to physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, and the lack of appropriate training sites. Clearly, low salaries for nursing home personnel contribute to recruitment and retention problems and low reimbursement rates affect nursing home providers' interest in paying higher salaries.\n\nNature of the Work in Nursing Homes\n\nNursing home work is often difficult, stressful, frustrating, and labor intensive, especially for NAs, who have the most direct contact with residents. Nursing home staff have to confront aging, disability, and dying. Much of the care of the elderly is not pleasant, such as caring for urinary and bowel incontinence or dealing with a cognitively impaired elder who is agitated and combative. Combined with low wages, minimal benefits, hard physical work, and the often progressively deteriorating abilities of the residents, the nature of the work for nursing staff is often characterized as tedious, unpleasant, and unrewarding. Furthermore, because concern for costs is likely to continue while resident acuity increases, the workload of NAs and nurses in nursing homes may very well get heavier.\n\nResearch related to the actual nature of the work role of NAs documents that the complexity level of most tasks is low (suggesting a routinized approach), and that even when NAs carry out direct care tasks, their attention is not always directed toward residents. The highest level of psychosocial quality interaction was found to occur in the process of socializing, an informal component of care, suggesting the need for alternative task structuring and more resident-centered models of care (Brannon et al., 1992). Other studies support the notion that staff-to-staff interactions are much more frequent than staff-to-resident interactions (Burgio et al., 1990).\n\nIn general, RNs in nursing homes suffer from a lack of prestige within the total health care delivery system. They are not only victims of financial disparity, but they are also subjected to humiliation and professional degradation, and their work role is often tied up exclusively with administrative functions. While the reasons are many, the lack of respect for nurses who choose to care for the elderly in nursing homes is at least in part because nurses and other health professionals often share the negative attitudes of society toward the elderly (Harrington, 1984).\n\nThe work of nursing home personnel is not without rewards, however. These rewards are largely intrinsic and evolve from the relationships formed with the elderly residents and the satisfaction gained from feeling that one has contributed to the quality of their lives, if only in a small way. For some, there are also the rewards of personal development that come from learning about aging and the opportunity to gain clinical skills. Nonetheless, extrinsic rewards for nursing staff remain problematic and this is largely responsible for the frequent turnover of staff and inability to recruit and retain qualified staff.\n\nStaff Salaries and Incentives\n\nAs already mentioned, salaries and other incentives are problematic for all nursing staff in long-term care. One of the major reasons for the dearth of RNs in nursing homes is economic, and retention rates among long-term-care staff have been shown to increase concurrently with increases in average weekly salary. In 1988 they received 88 percent of the typical acute care wage, and by 1990 the percentage had dropped to 86 percent. For RNs, the highest hourly rate was $18.91 in hospitals, followed by $16.82 for home care, and $15.26 for nursing home RNs (Hospital and Healthcare Compensation Service, 1994). Since 1990, there is some evidence that salaries for some staff in nursing homes may be increasing, although they continue to lag behind salaries in hospitals. Annual salaries for Directors of Nursing (DON) were recently reported to have increased by 6 percent to $41,200 (McKnight's Long-term Care News, 1995). The salaries and benefits of nursing assistants, however, provide little incentive and lag behind those for hospital aides and home care aides. The median hourly wage reported by hospital aides was $7.12 between 1987 and 1989, compared to $5.29 for nursing home aides and $4.22 for home care aides.\n\nNoting that RNs are a critical component of the rural health care delivery system and in some areas the sole providers of care, the Select Committee on Aging (1992) reported a shortage of 45,382 FTE RNs in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States. The $3,000 discrepancy in annual salary between nurses employed in small hospitals and those employed in large hospitals probably played a role in the shortage (Movassaghi et al., 1992). According to Kayser-Jones (1981b), often the only nurses willing to work for the low wages offered are those who cannot get employment in other types of health settings because of poor qualifications.\n\nReview of Research Relevant to Linkage of Staffing and Quality of Care\n\nThis section undertakes a review of the literature that investigates the quality of care provided in long-term-care facilities and examines linkages between quality of care and various aspects of nurse staffing. Following an initial discussion of definitions of quality and how it is measured, we discuss the relationship between cost and quality of care. Studies are then presented that focus on aspects of staffing (staff attitudes, level of training, level of stress and turnover rates, number of staff and staff mix) and that consider the effect of the variables on quality of care. Finally, we review research that examines the relationship between quality of care and environmental factors such as reimbursement policies, type of facilities, and management systems or organizational climate.\n\nDefinitions and Measurement of Quality\n\nFew concepts have been more elusive, controversial, or politically volatile than nursing home quality of care. Perhaps this is because as individuals we all fear functional impairment, loss of independence, and impoverishment, but as citizens we do not have the will to provide the financing for quality of care in nursing homes. Quality of care in nursing homes is a complex concept confounded by regulations and debates about what should be measured to assess quality, case-mix, facility characteristics, and methods of measurement (Mezey, 1989; Mezey and Lynaugh, 1989). Moreover, quality of care has been defined both as an input measure and as an outcome (Kruzich et al., 1992). But perhaps most confounding has been the continued reliance upon a medical model in defining standards of care and reimbursement formulas. Quality in long-term care requires different strategies than in acute care. In long-term care the focus is on replacing the patient role with a self-care role, emphasizing the individual's abilities to function with remaining abilities despite chronic disease, impairment, or both. Nursing homes are \"nursing\" homes so, clearly, quality of care is dependent upon the quality of nursing. Yet professional RNs are so scant in nursing homes as to be almost a novelty (Maraldo, 1991).\n\nPrior to OBRA 87, quality of care in nursing homes was largely evaluated and regulated according to structure and process standards rather than the achievement of patient outcomes. Traditional reliance on structural measures failed to capture the essence of nursing home quality (Braun, 1991), although Stein and colleagues (1986) found that resident perceptions of quality and level of satisfaction were strongly related to objective surveyor ratings of nursing home quality. In Kurowski and Shaughnessey's (1985) review of studies comparing quality of homes with regulator surveys, many aspects of quality were not sensitive to the surveys and adding observation to surveys did not adequately measure quality (Fackelmann, 1986). Davis (1991) reviewed a number of studies that have examined macro-organizational and structural variables and quality and noted the paucity of empirical evidence to support these linkages. Thus, research findings in general have shed little light on the characteristics of nursing homes (such as size, ægis, age, and rural or urban location) that inform our understanding of what factors contribute to quality care.\n\nThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 provided a starting point for a new definition of quality in long-term care and focused measurement of quality on patient outcomes (Wilging, 1992). According to OBRA, a nursing home's purpose is to \"bring each resident to the highest practicable level of mental, physical, and psychosocial well-being, and to do so in an environment that emphasizes resident's rights\" (Wilging, 1992, p. 22). Quality care begins with a standardized, comprehensive patient assessment coordinated by an RN, which requires that specific attention be given to activities of daily living, vision and hearing, pressure sores, urinary incontinence, range of motion, psychosocial functioning, use of nasogastric tubes, accidents, nutrition, hydration, antipsychotic and other drug use, and special services such as respiratory therapy. (Bowel elimination was ignored as an outcome to be monitored, but has been added in version 2.0 of the minimum data set.) The OBRA legislation proved to be the impetus for improving the quality of care in nursing homes. The requirement that specific fields be included in a minimum data set (MDS) on all residents in nursing homes provides a valuable source of data for evaluating quality on the basis of resident outcomes (Zimmerman, 1991). From the data on resident outcomes included in the MDS, quality indicators have been proposed and are being tested for how well they measure quality for aggregates of residents in nursing homes (Rantz and Miller, 1994).\n\nThe \"highest practicable level of functioning,\" however, is in reality defined by what is fiscally appropriate within each facility. Whether or not adequate resources are available to provide quality care is still an issue, and many would agree that resources are often not adequate. For example, the study conducted by the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Nursing Home Regulation supported higher nursing staff standards as a major means for assuring quality of care in nursing homes, along with new staffing, training, and registry requirements for nursing staff (IOM, 1986). Unfortunately, the goal of requiring 24-hour RN coverage in nursing homes was not achieved in OBRA because of political pressures touting a nursing shortage and higher costs. Although OBRA increased staffing requirements, the facts are that nursing assistants make up 85 percent of nursing staff in nursing homes and provide the majority of direct care to residents, with residents receiving on average only 12 minutes per day of care from RNs (Maraldo, 1991). As noted earlier, the issue of staff-to-resident ratios is also of concern. In acute care, there are an estimated 98 RNs for every 100 patients, while in nursing homes there are 5.2 RNs for every 100 residents (Wilging, 1992). This marked discrepancy is not likely due to a true corresponding difference in the needs of patients for nursing care in the two settings, but is rather due to how \"highest practicable\" is being defined by economic and political realities.\n\nThe concept of quality in the practice setting has, to date, included only limited attention to outcome assessments and public input (DHHS, 1993). Traditional paradigms of quality thus need redefinition to assure an excellence in health care that is responsive to the changing needs of the public. The movement to continuous quality improvement (CQI) is seen as one way of focusing on processes and systems, rather than individual efforts, in quality management applications (DHHS, 1993). When residents are asked what constitutes quality of care and what factors are most important in creating a good environment, they emphasize kindness, consideration, friendliness, and empathetic listening on the part of staff, suggesting that staff attitudes have a major impact on resident quality of life (Goodwin and Trocchio, 1987).\n\nAlthough families continue to be involved in care following placement of their loved one in a nursing facility, relatively little is known about the relationships among families and nursing home staff, especially from the perspective of family members (Duncan and Morgan, 1994). What research has been conducted in this area indicates that families equate good quality nursing home care with care that is affectively appropriate, emotionally sensitive, respectful, and professional, and that emphasizes a personal relationship with the resident. Families tend to base their evaluations of care as much on social and emotional factors as they do technical competence in performing care tasks (Bowers, 1988; Duncan and Morgan, 1994), whereas staff often give priority to the smooth functioning of the organization. What this means is that nurse aides, in particular, often get caught between the desires of the organization and those of family members (Duncan and Morgan, 1994). To address these differences, Bowers (1988) proposed a collaborative approach to care that would encourage families to become more involved in technical aspects of care while facilitating staff's emotional involvement with residents. Interestingly, in those facilities where families found little respect for the work of the nonprofessional staff, they also enjoyed little support for their goal of having their loved one treated in a personal manner by the staff. As noted in a study using focus groups and interviews with families of patients with dementia, families concluded that \"the demands and rewards of the nursing home as a system were often detrimental to quality care\" (Duncan and Morgan, 1994, p. 241). In another study, which examined the use of nasogastric feeding tubes in nursing homes, two themes of interest emerged in the family interviews. First, there was little or no communication among health care providers, patients, and their families regarding the use of nasogastric tubes. Second, some families perceived that the tubes were used for the convenience of the staff who did not want to take the time, or did not have the patience, to feed residents (Kayser-Jones, 1990).\n\nCost of Quality\n\nThe cost and financing of institutional long-term care to achieve the highest practicable functioning and well-being of patients is one of the biggest issues facing the assurance of quality care in nursing homes. Since OBRA, the average increase in reimbursement rate reported across the country has been about $1.50 per resident (Wilging, 1992). Few would argue that this is adequate to implement all that OBRA requires for assuring quality of care for nursing home residents, let alone to move beyond minimum standards. Without increased reimbursement, the nursing home industry will likely continue to seek ways to compromise OBRA standards, especially regarding RN staffing. \"We get what we pay for\" remains a truism that is no less applicable to nursing home quality of care than it is elsewhere.\n\nAs noted earlier, nursing homes are the major cost center for long-term care, with expenditures of more than $70 billion dollars in 1993 (DHHS, 1993). Data from the 1987 Medicare and Medicaid Automated Certification Survey (covering 14,000 nursing homes in 525 counties and 46 states) suggest that cost-saving decisions that lead to substituting less expensive staff and using more laborsaving techniques may lead to bad patient outcomes. That is, cost minimization may be achieved, but quality of care suffers. Where RN wages are high, nursing homes tend to use larger numbers of less expensive staff, whereas when LPN wages are higher, nursing homes use more RNs and NAs (Zinn, 1993). In addition, when the market price for nursing services is high, nursing homes use more laborsaving techniques such as catheterization, restraints, tube feedings, and nontoileting of residents, which may not necessarily represent good care strategies. However, where Medicaid per diem reimbursement rates are higher, and where there is more competition among facilities for patients, nursing homes use more licensed (RN and LPN) staff and have lower rates of catheterizations and nontoileting of residents. Spector and Takada (1991) also found that more RNs were employed when per capital income was higher, while more LPNs were used with higher Medicaid levels and in urban areas. When there was cost-based reimbursement, more RNs and LPNs were employed. These data suggest that nursing homes have not yet found consistent and effective ways to save money without sacrificing professional leadership and quality (Zinn, 1993).\n\nSome have argued that families are a neglected resource for the delivery of care in nursing homes. In a study to evaluate the effects of a special care unit for residents with Alzheimer's disease on resident, staff, and family member outcomes, Maas and colleagues (1991) found that family members were dissatisfied with their lack of involvement in the care of their relatives, with the activities provided for the residents, and with the amount of resources devoted to the provision of care. Based on these troubling results, Maas and colleagues (1994) are currently conducting a study funded by NINR. The study will test the effects on family and staff satisfaction and stress, as well as on resident outcomes, of an intervention designed to create a family-staff partnership for the care of institutionalized persons with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFactors that Influence Staff Performance\n\nJob Satisfaction and Turnover\n\nStaffing problems are expected to continue at least through the end of this century (Caudill and Patrick, 1991). In light of the growing demand for qualified personnel in long-term-care facilities and concern over the nursing shortage, however, surprisingly little research (aside from state and national surveys) has been conducted in the area of staff turnover, and the important other side of the coin, staff retention (Robertson et al., 1994).\n\nTurnover in nursing staff is generally affected by a variety of factors leading to low job satisfaction, including low compensation and benefits, poor working conditions and quality of the nursing home, few opportunities for advancement, and problems with staff relationships (Birkenstock, 1991). Studies specifically focusing on NAs in long-term-care settings have cited numerous individual characteristics (e.g., age, education, background) as well as management factors (e.g., inadequate in-service education, supervision and orientation; few opportunities for advancement, performance appraisal, and compensation) as contributing to the high rate of turnover and dissatisfaction (Reagan, 1986; Wagnild and Manning, 1986). A study by Wagnild identified a \"cycle of turnover\" and found that NA turnover can be reduced by careful analysis of management practices, starting with the recruitment and selection of applicants and extending through orientation, staff development, supervisory skills, employee compensation, and involvement of aides in management decisions (Wagnild, 1988, p. 22).\n\nComparing levels of job satisfaction in social care homes, Willcocks and colleagues (1987) found the lowest levels in homes where the ratio of staff hours to residents was below the average. Low levels of staff satisfaction were particularly prevalent where staff had less autonomy and time constraints allowed only the essentials of care to be carried out. Although staff tended to rate their overall job satisfaction highly, negative elements noted were in regard to working conditions, staff shortages perceived to result in poor care, inadequate involvement in decisions, and inadequacies of training and consultation.\n\nA recent study by Robertson and colleagues (1994) identified factors that affected RN retention in long-term care, focusing on what nurses reported as enhancing their job satisfaction and commitment to this area of practice. Briefly, the three highest rated factors related to satisfaction were recognition from patients, challenge of the work, and the authority to exercise judgment for patient care. The most important factors seen as contributing to retention were relationships with colleagues, available support staff, authority to exercise judgment in patient care, challenge of the work, adequate nurse-to-resident ratio, support from administration, and adequate supplies and equipment. The investigators also calculated mean difference scores for all items, indicating that importance was greater than satisfaction in these areas for the nurse respondents. The largest mean differences found were in the areas of paperwork, salary and benefits, and staffing. Further analysis and synthesis of the data revealed, consistent with previous findings in the literature, five main areas in which issues associated with retention of nurses in long-term care arise: (1) relationships, (2) patient care factors, (3) money and benefits, (4) levels of staffing and supplies, and (5) amount of paperwork. Difficulties in these areas represent serious problems in long-term care that threaten the quality of care provided in these settings (Robertson et al., 1994). Thus, to promote staff retention in long-term care and to make nursing homes a more attractive and satisfying practice setting, administrators must recognize both the importance to nurses of patient care factors and the authority to manage patient care issues and make clinical decisions, and the need to provide RNs with attractive compensation and benefits, recognition, training, and participation in decision making about their work.\n\nStress and Burnout\n\nNurses who work with the elderly confront many complex and potentially stressful care situations. Nowhere is this more true than for nursing home staff who work in highly demanding, labor- and client-intensive jobs. High stress at work can create morale problems that ultimately detract from the staff member's job performance (Sheridan et al., 1990). The causal model depicted below (see Figure 1), derived from research on work stress and morale among nursing home employees, highlights both antecedents and outcomes of work-related stress (Weiler et al., 1990, p. 321).\n\nThe antecedent conditions include objective organizational characteristics such as: (1) the variety of tasks in nursing positions, (2) the degree to which supervisory authority is delegated, (3) the closeness of supervision, (4) the degree of specialization, (5) the skill level of the work, (6) the quantity of the work, and (7) the pace of the work. Subjective organizational characteristics include: (1) task routinization, (2) communication, and (3) distributive justice. Social support includes perceived support from supervisors, coworkers, spouse, friends, and relatives. Personal characteristics refer to variables such as age, sex, educational attainment, length of nursing service, occupational position or title, work status (e.g., full- or part-time), marital status, and number of relatives living nearby. Ethical dilemmas are situations in which no choice is clearly correct and the alternatives are equally unsatisfactory, while a philosophy of care incorporates ANA standards of care and the nurses' personal beliefs regarding the residents' right of autonomy, their role in the decision making process, and their right to respectful treatment (Weiler et al., 1990).\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nCausal model of work stress.\n\nA large body of literature has examined the outcomes of work-related stress, revealing a strong link between stress and adverse physical and psychological consequences (LaRocco et al., 1980). There is equally compelling evidence, however, that social support serves to mitigate against these adverse effects and reduces burnout among nurses (Constable and Russell, 1986). Burnout, a phenomenon characterized by loss of concern for residents, and physical, emotional and spiritual exhaustion, may lead to indifference or negative feelings toward elderly residents, overuse of chemical or physical restraints, and heightened potential for abuse (Heine, 1986). Burnout has also been shown to result in administrative difficulties such as high rates of tardiness, absenteeism, and attrition (Goldin, 1985).\n\nThe outcomes of work-related stress, according to the above model, include: (1) burnout, defined as a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and lack of personal accomplishment; (2) depression, which is the degree of negative affect experienced by nursing personnel; (3) job satisfaction, which is the affective orientation of nursing personnel toward the work situation; and (4) work involvement, defined as the degree to which nursing personnel identify with the job (Weiler et al., 1990).\n\nIt has been suggested that nursing personnel who work with patients with Alzheimer's disease are especially vulnerable to the effects of stress and burnout. Alzheimer's disease patients present many difficult care and management problems because of their progressive cognitive, functional, and psychosocial deterioration, which can result in bizarre and combative behaviors, emotional outbursts, and wandering. Moreover, nursing home staff are often poorly trained to cope with the disruptive behaviors of residents, and they are therefore repeatedly frustrated by their inability to manage recurrent problems (Stolley et al., 1991). Many nursing homes are also not equipped with environmental structures or the support and service systems required to care appropriately for the person with Alzheimer's disease (Peppard, 1984). A recent study, using a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures, examined whether staff who cared for Alzheimer's disease patients on a special care unit were less stressed and less burned out than staff who cared for such patients on traditional (integrated) units. Findings revealed that the principal area of stress reduction for nursing personnel working on the SCU occurred with respect to staff knowledge, abilities, and resources. Subscale analysis indicated significantly less stress for staff who worked in the SCU with respect to residents' verbal and physical behavior. The SCU was designed specifically to provide the special environmental structures and support and service systems for the care of Alzheimer's disease patients that would enhance functioning and decrease associated behavioral problems. These may be important factors in reducing stress and burnout for staff caring for residents with Alzheimer's disease (Mobily et al., 1992). The investigators also recommended that whenever possible, staff who work with residents who have Alzheimer's should be carefully screened and selected for their ability to be sensitive to the needs of these residents, their flexibility, and their imagination, as well as ability to respond to persons with impaired communication and ever-changing moods (Coons, 1991). Specialized training in the care of residents with Alzheimer's disease is also a critical factor (see next section, \"Education and Training\").\n\nIn an effort to manage stress among nursing personnel in long-term-care facilities, it seems logical to examine those antecedent conditions in the model depicted above that are amenable to change. Research by Hare and Pratt (1988) has shown that higher levels of nursing burnout in both acute and long-term-care settings may be related to the nature of the physically and emotionally strenuous work tasks, low status in comparison to other positions in the health care system, limited training, low wages and benefits and, of interest to this report, poor staffing-to-patient ratios. Further, problems with support in the work environment, especially from peers and supervisors, have repeatedly been shown to be a primary source of stress among nurses (Cronin-Stubbs and Rooks, 1985). It has also been suggested that nursing personnel who elect to work with clients who have a poor chance of survival (as opposed to nursing personnel who do not work with these patients by choice) have reduced vulnerability to burnout because their work provides them with a sense of meaning (Hare and Pratt, 1988). The interventions summarized below have been set forth to address organizational sources of stress in the long-term-care setting (Weiler et al., 1990, pp. 333–334):\n\nImproved in-service training, especially in multidimensional problems of the elderly, that emphasizes psychosocial and behavioral problems common in this population.\n\nIncreased variety in job tasks.\n\nImproved supervision.\n\nImplementation of a management style that allows for feedback, flexibility, and sensitivity.\n\nClear and realistic objectives for resident care.\n\nHigher wages and better benefits for staff.\n\nAdequate staffing levels.\n\nAlthough the latter two recommendations may be considered nonnegotiable by some administrators because of the cost implications associated with their implementation, it should be noted that the costs related to staff burnout, absenteeism, and turnover can far outweigh the costs associated with adequate staffing and compensation (Weiler et al., 1990).\n\nAnother source of work-related stress that may be amenable to change has to do with the effect of the physical environment and structural factors. Although very little research has been done in this area, work by Lyman (1987) suggests that physical and architectural features, such as adequate space, separate activity rooms, staff offices and toilet facilities, resident care facilities, barrier-free hallways, visible exits with amenities such as wide entry doors and ramps, and emergency exits, may decrease caregiver burden and stress. Enhancing social support networks is another important strategy that can serve as a buffer against the stresses inherent in working with the elderly. Interventions designed to strengthen supportive relationships among staff, staff training related to stress management, and work-related counseling and support groups have all been shown to reduce vulnerability to burnout, depression, and job dissatisfaction (Weiler et al., 1990).\n\nEducation and Training\n\nAlthough previous research has provided inconclusive evidence of a strong relationship between the care provider's attitudes toward the elderly and the quality of resident care (Wright, 1988), Storlie (1982) argued that dedicated and compassionate nursing staff are essential for maintaining high quality care on a day-to-day basis. Further, few would disagree that nurse aides need to be skilled in providing care, given that they make up about 85 percent of nursing home personnel and provide the majority of direct care. Yet many nurse aides are functionally illiterate, untrained, and inadequate to the tasks at hand (Maraldo, 1991). With the number of cognitively impaired and functionally dependent residents in nursing homes, sophisticated approaches for care are required that are beyond the knowledge and skill of persons with one year or less of training. The need for competent professionals who are caring, qualified, and compassionate caregivers has been documented by research on residents in long-term-care settings (NCCNHR, 1985). However, the reality is that the majority (96 percent) of directors of nursing in long-term-care facilities are not academically prepared for their positions (Bahr, 1991), having little or no specific education about the aging process, gerontological nursing principles, or managerial skills. The lack of educationally prepared RNs who understand the unique health and social needs of older adults and who are effective managers of assisting nursing staff is a critical problem. Combined with the small number of RNs employed in nursing homes and the reported vacancy rate of about 10 percent for RNs, the problem takes on gargantuan proportions (Bahr, 1991).\n\nMuch of the published literature on education in long-term care discusses the need for more training and adequate supervision of staff, especially for NAs. Methods most commonly used in staff training are didactic, using both verbal and written instruction, but there has been relatively little effort to study systematically the success of these methods with long-term-care staff, or to evaluate their ability to maintain therapeutic staff behaviors over time (Burgio and Burgio, 1990). In a review of the literature on this topic, Burgio and Burgio (1990, p. 289) urge the development of efficient training procedures \"to teach nursing assistants basic therapeutic principles and skills,\" and argue that \"management systems must be designed and implemented to assure that these skills will be performed appropriately and consistently in the natural environment.\" They also outline a number of strategies to overcome organizational resistance to staff-management interventions.\n\nBurgio and Burgio (1990) suggest that an important step in motivating staff to perform patient-related tasks is effective in-service training, which should include: (1) didactic instruction presented both in verbal and written formats, (2) modeling of the procedure by a trainer, and (3) role playing by the trainees coupled with immediate trainer feedback regarding their performance. The attitudes of staff affect not only their own expectations about their working lives, but also the way in which they approach residents. Thus an important aspect of in-service training is to correct the tendencies to view residents as childlike, unreliable, and manipulative, and to reduce depersonalization of physical care and the neglect of psychosocial needs.\n\nAssessment of training outcomes includes more than simple paper and pencil tests to determine knowledge of the procedure; rather, assessment should also include a checklist assessment of skill performance in a situation that permits immediate corrective feedback and praise, followed by assessment of the trainee's skill performance on the nursing unit. Burgio and Burgio (1990) argue that these assessments should take place immediately following the in-service training, as well as at regular intervals thereafter, with remedial training sessions required in the event of poor performance.\n\nConsultation\n\nAs noted earlier in the section on staffing qualifications and preparation, most RNs employed by long-term-care facilities have associate degrees, that is, two years of training that include"
