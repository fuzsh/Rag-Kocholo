        "text": "Ronald Arsenault, a 49-year-old Canadian with a friendly smile and a penchant for plaid shirts, had just dropped his wife off at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater Airport so she could check their bags for the flight home.\n\nHe planned to turn in their rental car and ride a shuttle back to join her, a trip that should have taken 10 minutes.\n\nNinety minutes later, Jeanette Arsenault was still waiting for her husband. She didn't know he was dead, the victim of a drunken driver.\n\nThat was nine months ago. On Tuesday Mrs. Arsenault was back in Florida, sitting in a courtroom about a mile from where her husband died, to see what punishment his killer would get.\n\nShe was not alone. The room was packed. Most of the people present were friends or family members of the defendant, Robert Clay Duncan, 28, of St. Petersburg. Before his arrest Duncan _ once a standout student at Brandon High School _ had been a well-liked pharmacist at Walgreen's drug store. He was engaged and was buying a house.\n\nAfter he was released from jail, Duncan was hospitalized for suicidal depression. He lost his license to dispense drugs and declared personal bankruptcy. He has spent the past eight months undergoing therapy at a residential care facility in Tampa and doing volunteer work for the Tampa AIDS Network.\n\n\"I never wanted to hurt anybody,\" Duncan said. He said he contemplated suicide because \"I felt I should be the one to die.\"\n\nCircuit Judge Joseph Donahey spent three hours Tuesday hearing from both sides, trying to craft a sentence that would satisfy the law's requirement for punishment, give the victims' family a sense of closure and yet recognize the defendant's efforts to make amends.\n\n\"I've never known how to deal with cases like this,\" acknowledged Donahey, who lost his own father to a drunken driver.\n\nIn the end Donahey sentenced Duncan to prison for four years, to be followed by 11 years of probation. While on probation, Duncan must perform 500 hours of community service a year by speaking to students and church groups. The judge also ordered him to join Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and took away his driver's license for life.\n\nDuring the hearing, Duncan's family and friends spoke of how intelligent and sensitive he is.\n\nBut Assistant State Attorney Weston Smith pointed out that this was not Duncan's first brush with the law. Five years ago, after another crash, he was convicted of DUI and ordered to undergo counseling.\n\nYet on the night he killed Arsenault, Duncan's blood-alcohol level was more than 0.22, nearly three times the level at which Florida law presumes a driver to be impaired.\n\nThe crash occurred about 7:30 p.m. on July 15. Arsenault, trying to return a Chevrolet Geo, had apparently missed the turn for the Alamo lot. He made a U-turn on Roosevelt Boulevard and was headed back toward his destination.\n\nDuncan's Ford Probe came flying up behind him at 80 mph and clipped his bumper. The Geo went into a ditch and flipped three times. Duncan was not injured.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing Duncan apologized to Mrs. Arsenault and her three children, all of whom flew down for the hearing to tell the judge about their loss. One daughter, Lisa Hill, got married a month after the crash. She said she still has a hard time looking at her wedding pictures because her father's absence is evident in every frame.\n\nAnd Mrs. Arsenault told the judge, \"Many times I've wondered why I was not in the car with my husband. It would be easier than what I am going through now.\"\n\nAfter the hearing, Duncan took off his tie and belt and pulled a pen from his pocket. He handed all three to his fiance, Wendy Smith, who was dabbing at her eyes with a tissue. As bailiffs fingerprinted him, she walked over to kiss him goodbye.\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenault's family stood in a tight little knot outside the courtroom talking about the sentence. Mrs. Arsenault said grimly: \"It's not enough for what he's done.\""
