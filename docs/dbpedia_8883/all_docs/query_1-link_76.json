        "text": "When Roger Lavallee was a young boy, he would feed himself a steady diet of Yes and Rush albums. With his headphones on, he discovered a world of sound that hypnotized him.\n\n“I wanted to be a studio engineer after listening to (that),” Lavallee said recently. “Cool things were happening. I love that sound, things being in stereo, swirling around in my head.”\n\nLavallee followed his muse, becoming the most sought after studio guy for the Worcester music scene and beyond. But his story really began with a batch of songs.\n\nWhen Lavallee was in his mid-teens, he had begun to put his recording bug into practice.\n\n“I recorded a bunch of songs at home,” he recalled. “I didn’t even have a four track then, just a Walkman and a tape deck. I needed to put a band together to play the songs live.”\n\nThus began the career of his original band, Curtain Society.\n\n“The band started when I was 18,” said Lavallee.\n\nAt 19, he started his professional career in earnest, at Mendon Roads Recording studio in Uxbridge.\n\nWorking in an actual studio was a smooth transition for the gifted Lavallee. He allowed his instincts to pull him through those first years.\n\n“Maybe I didn’t know what I was doing, but I did know what I was doing,” he quipped. “Ya know, you want it to sound like the record, like the final product. There’s a sort of, that’s the goal. If it doesn’t, then you have to figure it out.”\n\nIt was that kind of sense of perfection that fueled his rapid growth. After a couple of years at Mendon Roads, Lavallee was referred to a new studio opening up in West Boylston. Built by local musician Charles Blaum, it was dubbed Sound of Glass, and Lavallee quickly became the backbone of the studio.\n\nFor the next four or five years, Lavallee settled in, honing his craft as he went along. Blaum closed the studio down in the late ’90s, after which Lavallee worked out of various studios in the Boston area for a time. Through that more advanced scene, he soon understood state-of-the-art gear wasn’t everything.\n\n“I realized I didn’t really necessarily need all of the expensive gear,” he said.\n\nAfter a few years, Blaum gave him a call back.\n\n“Charlie called me one day, and said, ‘Yeah, I went on a binge and bought some new gear. I want to open up a studio.’”\n\nThe concept of the new studio, dubbed Tremolo Lounge, was to keep it a private enterprise – in other words, not advertise it to the world.\n\nBetween the two of them, they were able to lure plenty of projects, and it was the people that they wanted to work with.\n\nFull disclosure: I was one of those people. My first solo CD, plus the first record with my band Hothouse, were in Lavallee’s capable hands.\n\nDuring this fruitful run, Lavallee produced projects by guitarist Mark Copley, blues master James Montgomery, local bands Thinner and Puddle, singer/songwriter Denis Coughlin and countless others. The music was varied and Lavallee adapted to whatever came through the door.\n\nAround 1999, Tremolo Lounge converted to digital recording, via ProTools, and the power of the studio took off exponentially. But Lavallee understood the danger of relying on technology to be a fix-it kit.\n\n“The fact remains that if you get the right sound at the source, you don’t really need to do a lot of editing, something that is lost nowadays,” he said. “I like to try and keep the mindset of economy, and get the right sounds, and have less tracks and better sounds.”\n\nTremolo Lounge thrived from 1997 until 2012. According to Blaum, the studio’s success pretty much rested on Lavallee’s shoulders.\n\n“Tremolo Lounge was really Roger,” Blaum said. “His engineering skills, his musicianship, and his creative input were the biggest reasons artists came to the studio (and left happy).”\n\n“It was quite a run,” Lavallee said. “That place was magic. I still miss it to this day. There’s something about the actual aura that was just made to make music.”\n\nLavallee is now working out of Wachusett Recording, a fresh, relatively young studio out of Princeton. He is presently working on a project with Neil Lucie, whose band, Thinner, has worked with Lavallee before.\n\nAlthough recording other bands is his forte, Lavallee still loves to play music himself. An accomplished guitarist, he is currently in two bands: Flock of Assholes and Heavy Horses. Anyone who has had the pleasure of working with him has nothing but good things to say. Duncan Arsenault, drummer with The Curtis Mayflower, and longtime Curtain Society drummer, said Lavallee is the kind of musician “you always hope to play with.”\n\n“Roger listens to music and grasps its nuance in a way that still inspires me,” Arsenault said. “He’s an incredible songwriter, with a keen sense of what a song can become, right at its inception. Roger lives and breathes music and I’m honored to share that atmosphere with him.”\n\nLavallee, a gentle soul with fire in his veins, has made a difference in the lives of many people in the local music scene. And he is just getting started."
