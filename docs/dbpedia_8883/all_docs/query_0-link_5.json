        "text": "City in New Hampshire, United States\n\nKeene is a city in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States.[3] The population was 23,047 at the 2020 census,[4] down from 23,409 at the 2010 census.[5] It is the county seat and the only city in the county.\n\nKeene is home to Keene State College and Antioch University New England. It hosted the state's annual pumpkin festival from 1991 to 2014, several times setting a world record for most jack-o'-lanterns on display.\n\nThe grocery wholesaler C&S Wholesale Grocers is based in Keene.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1735, colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher granted lots in the township of \"Upper Ashuelot\" to 63 settlers who paid £5 each (equivalent to US$1,358.9 in 2023).[6]: 21–22 It was settled after 1736 on Equivalent Lands.[7]\n\nIn 1747, during King George's War, the village was attacked and burned by Natives.[6]: 79 Colonists fled to safety, but would return to rebuild in 1749.[6]: 96 It was regranted to its inhabitants in 1753 by Governor Benning Wentworth, who renamed it \"Keene\" after Sir Benjamin Keene, a principal of the South Sea Trading company whose primary business was slave trading.[8]\n\nIn 2011, Massachusetts man Thomas Ball immolated himself on the steps of a courthouse in Keene to protest what he considered the court system's abuse of divorced fathers' rights.[9]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nKeene is located at (42.9339, −72.2784).[10]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 37.3 square miles (96.7 km2), of which 37.1 square miles (96.1 km2) are land and 0.3 square miles (0.7 km2) are water, the latter comprising 0.69% of the town.[11] Keene is drained by the Ashuelot River. The highest point in Keene is the summit of Grays Hill in the city's northwestern corner, at 1,388 feet (423 m) above sea level. Keene is entirely within the Connecticut River watershed, with all of the city except for the northwestern corner draining to the Connecticut via the Ashuelot.[12]\n\nState highways converge on Keene from nine directions. New Hampshire Route 9 leads northeast to Concord, the state capital, and west to Brattleboro, Vermont. Route 10 leads north to Newport and southwest to Northfield, Massachusetts. Route 12 leads northwest to Walpole and Charlestown and southeast to Winchendon, Massachusetts. Route 101 leads east to Peterborough and Manchester, Route 32 leads south to Swanzey, then to Athol, Massachusetts, and Route 12A leads north to Surry and Alstead. A limited-access bypass used variously by Routes 9, 10, 12, and 101 passes around the north, west, and south sides of downtown.\n\nKeene is served by Dillant–Hopkins Airport, located just south of the city in Swanzey.[13]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nKeene is located in a humid continental climate zone.[14] It experiences all four seasons quite distinctly. The average high temperature in July is 82 °F (28 °C), and the record high for Keene is 102 °F (39 °C). As with other cities in the eastern U.S., periods of high humidity can raise heat indices to near 110 °F (43 °C). During the summer, Keene can get hit by thunderstorms from the west, but the Green Mountains to the west often break up some of the storms, so that Keene doesn't usually experience a thunderstorm at full strength. The last time a tornado hit Cheshire County was in 1997.\n\nThe winters in Keene can be very harsh. The most recent such winter was 2002–2003, when Keene received 112.5 inches (2,860 mm) of snow. The majority of the snowfall in Keene comes from nor'easters, areas of low pressure that move up the Atlantic coast and strengthen. Many times these storms can produce blizzard conditions across southern New England. Recent examples are the blizzard of 2005 and the blizzard of 2006. Keene is situated in an area where cold air meets the moisture from the south, so often Keene gets the jackpot with winter storms. Aside from snow, winters can be very cold. Even in the warmest of winters, Keene will typically experience at least one night below 0 °F (−18 °C). During January 2004, Keene saw highs below freezing 25 of the days, including five days in the single digits and one day with a high of zero. Overnight lows dropped below zero 12 times, including 7 nights below −10 °F (−23 °C). The record low in Keene is −31 °F (−35 °C). In addition to the cold temperatures, Keene can receive biting winds that drive the wind chill down below −30 °F (−34 °C).\n\nSnow can occur through the end of April, but on the other end of the spectrum, 80 °F (27 °C) days can begin in late March. Autumn weather is similar. Keene's first snowfall usually occurs in early November, though the city can also see 60 °F (16 °C) days into mid-November. Significant rain events can occur in the spring and fall. For example, record rainfall and flooding with the axis of heaviest rain (around 12 inches (300 mm)) near Keene occurred in October 2005. Another significant flood event occurred in May of the following year.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 17901,314—18001,64525.2%18101,6460.1%18201,89515.1%18302,37425.3%18402,6109.9%18503,39230.0%18604,32027.4%18705,97138.2%18806,78413.6%18907,4469.8%19009,16523.1%191010,0689.9%192011,21011.3%193013,79423.1%194013,8320.3%195015,63813.1%196017,56212.3%197020,46716.5%198021,4494.8%199022,4304.6%200022,9552.3%201023,4092.0%202023,047−1.5%\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 23,409 people, 9,052 households, and 4,843 families residing in the city.

On the New Hampshire Executive Council, Keene is in the 2nd District and is represented by Democrat Cinde Warmington. In the United States House of Representatives, Keene is a part of New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District and is currently represented by Democrat Ann McLane Kuster.\n\nKeene is a strongly Democratic-leaning city at the presidential level, as no Republican presidential nominee has carried the city in over two decades.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral media sources are located in Keene. These include:\n\nThe Keene Sentinel\n\nThe Monadnock Shopper News\n\nThe Equinox, student newspaper of Keene State College\n\nParent Express\n\nFPP News\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has several radio stations licensed by the FCC to Keene. The stations are:\n\nAM\n\nWZBK 1220 (Sports)\n\nWKBK 1290 (News/Talk), formerly WKNE. Simulcast on W281AU, 104.1 FM.[22]\n\nFM\n\nWEVN 90.7, operated by New Hampshire Public Radio[23]\n\nWKNH 91.3, operated by Keene State College[24]\n\nWSNI 97.7 (Adult Contemporary, Sunny 97).

Local stations offered on Time Warner include most major Boston-area and New Hampshire stations (including WEKW), as well as WVTA, the Vermont PBS outlet in Windsor, Vermont.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nKeene is often considered a minor college town, as it is the site of Keene State College, whose students make up a substantial portion of the city's population, and Antioch University New England.\n\nAt the secondary level, Keene serves as the educational nexus of the area, due in large part to its status as the largest community of Cheshire County. Keene High School is the largest regional High School in Cheshire County, serving about 1,850 students.\n\nKeene has one middle school, Keene Middle School, and four elementary schools, as of 2014: Fuller Elementary School, Franklin Elementary School, Symonds Elementary School, Wheelock Elementary School. Jonathan Daniels was downsized to only pre-school and administration offices.\n\nKeene is part of New Hampshire's School Administrative Unit 29, or SAU 29.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nKeene has more than 20 churches, mostly Protestant, and one synagogue, Congregation Ahavas Achim. A significant landmark in downtown Keene is the United Church of Christ at Central Square, colloquially known in town as the \"White Church\" or the \"Church at the Head of the Square\". A second church on the square was Grace United Methodist Church, also known as the \"Brick Church\", but it is now privately owned and operated for secular purposes. The Grace United Methodist congregation moved to another site.\n\nKeene is the seat of the Roman Catholic Parish of the Holy Spirit, whose pastor is the Dean of the Monadnock Deanery, a division under the see of the Diocese of Manchester. The parish has two churches in the City of Keene, Saint Bernard and Saint Margaret Mary. Keene has one Episcopal church, Saint James, which is within the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. Keene also has one Greek Orthodox church, Saint George, which is under the see of the Metropolis of Boston.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints building is home to the Keene Ward and is part of the Nashua, New Hampshire Stake.\n\nFestivals\n\n[edit]\n\nPumpkin\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: New Hampshire Pumpkin Festival\n\nEvery October from 1991 to 2014, Keene hosted an annual pumpkin festival called the Keene Pumpkin Festival, locally known as Pumpkin Fest. The event set world records several times for the largest simultaneous number of jack-o'-lanterns on display. The first time was in 1993, when Keene set the record with nearly 5,000 carved and lit pumpkins.[32] The tally from the 2003 festival stood as the record until Boston took the lead in 2006, but Keene reclaimed the world record in 2013, with a total of 30,581 pumpkins, according to Guinness World Records.[33] Besides the pumpkins stacked on massive towers set in the streets, thousands of additional pumpkins were installed along the streets of the city. Face painting, fireworks, music, and other entertainments were also provided.\n\nAfter riots from college students (the majority of which were not associated with Keene State and were in attendance due to the publicity of the 2013 festival) nearby to the 2014 event location, the Keene Pumpkin Festival[34] was moved to Laconia the following year and renamed the New Hampshire Pumpkin Festival.[35] From 2017 onward (except for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Hampshire), the organizers of the 2011 through 2014 Keene Pumpkin Festivals, along with the 2015 New Hampshire Pumpkin Festival in Laconia, have run a new smaller, child-focused Keene Pumpkin Festival with a number of restrictions in place, promoting it as the \"official\" continuation of the Keene Pumpkin Festival.[36][37]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late August or early September the city hosts the Keene Music Festival. Several stages are located throughout the downtown area during the day's events, which are free to the public and sponsored by locally owned businesses. Visitors, mostly from the local community, roam the city's sidewalks listening to the dozens of bands.\n\nPride\n\n[edit]\n\nKeene Pride Week and festival takes place during the second week of September every year.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1949 movie Lost Boundaries, starring Mel Ferrer, tells the true story of a black Keene physician who passed as white for many years. The film won the 1949 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay.\n\nMuch of the 1995 movie Jumanji, starring Robin Williams, was filmed in Keene in November 1994, as the movie's fictional town of Brantford. Frank's Barber Shop is a featured setting as well as the Parrish Shoe sign, which was painted for the film. The sign served as a focal point for a temporary Robin Williams memorial in the days following the actor's death on August 11, 2014.\n\nMusic and theatre\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1979, First Lady Rosalynn Carter dedicated the bandstand in Central Square as the E. E. Bagley Bandstand, after the noted composer of the National Emblem March, who made Keene his home until his death in 1922.[38]\n\nMany community groups perform on a regular basis, including the Keene Chamber Orchestra, the Keene Chamber Singers, the Keene Chorale, the Greater Keene Pops Choir, and the Keene Jazz Orchestra.\n\nThe Cheshiremen Chorus, a local chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society, meet every Tuesday at 6:30 pm at the Hannah Grimes Center at 25 Roxbury Street.\n\nThe Monadnock Pathway Singers are an all-volunteer hospice group based in Keene whose members come from many different towns within Cheshire County. They sing in nursing homes, hospitals, assisted-living centers and in private homes throughout Cheshire County.\n\nEvery year, the Keene branch of the Lions Clubs International performs a Broadway musical at the Colonial Theatre (a restored theatre dating back to 1924), to raise money for the community. Other theatres and auditoriums include the new Keene High School Auditorium and the county's largest auditorium, the Larracey Auditorium at Keene Middle School, and The Putnam Arts Lecture Hall on the campus of Keene State. Keene Cinemas is the local movie theater located off of Key Road.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nKeene is home to the Keene Swamp Bats baseball team of the New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL). The Swamp Bats play at Alumni Field in Keene during June and July of each summer. The Swamp Bats are five-time league champions (2000, 2003, 2011, 2013, and 2019). They are consistently at the top of the NECBL in attendance, having led the league in 2002, 2004, and 2005.\n\nThe Elm City Derby Damez roller derby league, members of USA Roller Sports (USARS), call Keene home while playing their officially sanctioned bouts in nearby Brattleboro, Vermont. They compete against many other women's flat track leagues around the northeastern United States.\n\nThe Monadnock Wolfpack Rugby Football Club now calls Keene its home. They play in NERFU (New England Rugby Football Union) division IV at Carpenter Field, on Carpenter Street. They will defend their undefeated championship 2018 season in the Fall of 2019.\n\nImages\n\n[edit]\n\nStone Arch Bridge c. 1906\n\nGriffin Estate c. 1908\n\nCentral Square in 1907\n\nWest Street in 1910\n\nCentral Square looking south down Main Street towards Swanzey, NH\n\nFree Keene activism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has become home to an active voluntaryist protest group known as Free Keene, which is associated with the Free State Project.[39][40] Some Free Keene activists have been arrested for video recording in courtrooms as an act of civil disobedience, in violation of the state's wiretapping law. In 2009, Keene's Central Square Park had become the center of daily 4:20 pm smoke-ins which advocated the legalization of marijuana.[41][42][43]\n\nFree Keene has encountered opposition from other Keene residents.[39][44] While some of the activists' techniques can be relatively confrontational, and the WMUR report mentioned a tongue-in-cheek drinking party at a government building to protest open-container laws, others are significantly less so. For example, a common act by some Free Keene activists involves paying money into expired parking meters to help other citizens avoid parking tickets, which has created conflict between the meter pluggers and the parking enforcement officers. The close encounters with the \"Robin Hooders\" resulted in one PEO resigning his position and a lawsuit filed by the City of Keene citing harassment of their employees.[45] In December 2013, the judge overseeing the case dismissed the city's arguments against the \"Robin Hooders\" on first amendment grounds, citing the public sidewalks' role as a traditional public forum.[46]\n\nInternational outreach\n\n[edit]\n\nEinbeck, in Germany, is a partner city.[47]\n\nSites of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nDillant–Hopkins Airport\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places:\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Hampshire portal"
