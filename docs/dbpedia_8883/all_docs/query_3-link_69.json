        "text": "Anne Hagar Eustis\n\nclassnews1949@colby.edu\n\nAs I write this, it is Christmas week and our first measurable snow fell two days ago! Here’s to a white Christmas!✹ Haroldene Whitcomb Wolf reports that she and her family were able to resume their annual gathering (since 1968) in New Hampshire last summer, though the camps on Squam Lake were operating at 50-percent capacity for lack of foreign-student employees. She enjoys life at her CCRC in Florida playing lots of croquet, bocce, and ping pong. Sounds like Deanie! Her grandson is a junior at Lehigh, and her granddaughter a senior in high school.✹ A long letter came from Robert Sage reminiscing over his years as a student, chairman of the Alumni Council, 19 years as a member of the Colby Board of Trustees, and as “chairman of the committee in solicitation of donations, gifts, and funds for Colby over these years.” He and his wife, Phyllis, just celebrated their 72nd year of marriage. They “have been blessed with three children, seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.” Bob and Phyllis had a summer home on Cape Cod in Mashpee. “We visited a gift store and saw a display of pillows with inscriptions of quotations from various colleges. We spotted one with the following of Colby: ‘It’s hard to be humble when you’re from Colby.’” Needless to say, they bought it, and it now sits in a place of honor on top of one of their sofas. “It’s emblematic of our strong feeling for Colby, then and now!”✹ Cynthia Crook Lieck writes that she’s still in Venice, Fla., happily near her daughters. “This past Thanksgiving was reunion-like at one daughter and son-in-law’s, 10 children (greats) from early high school down to three 2-year-olds, four of the 10 mine.” Cynthia closes with a wish for us all for a healthy 2022.✹ I had a telephone call from Joan Smith Rogers, who lives in Bar Harbor at Birch Bay Retirement Community. She reports that Birch Bay is a good facility and that she’s well taken care of. She wishes us all to “have a good rest of your life!”✹ And now for the part of this job I like the least. Stephen Parker notified me that his mother, Alice Rogers Parker, passed away Oct. 20, 2021. Late last year, I tried to call Nellie MacDougall Parks, only to discover she passed away Sept. 16, 2021. Nellie and I go back to our freshman year at Colby when we both lived in “good old Hedman” on the old campus, the first year it had become a girls’ dorm. We have been good friends ever since and have kept in touch through the years. Do you remember her classic Maine accent? I can still hear her “ayuh.” Lon and I came to Maine every summer, and we always would get together with Nellie and Warren and with Jean Pelletier Sutphin and her husband. Oh, what fond and great memories! She will be missed by all who knew her. The obituaries for both these wonderful classmates will be found further along in this issue of the magazine.✹ And so I come to the end of another column for the ’49ers. Please remember to send me news at any time for my ’49 file. And here’s to a more normal 2022 with Covid-19 more or less behind us.\n\nArt White\n\nclassnews1952@colby.edu\n\nIt pleases me that Bob Kline stops at 788 High Street to visit with Mary and me. Bob plays racquetball and pickleball at the Bath YMCA on Thursdays and often stops for a chat before traveling home. Bob continues to be very active. He works to preserve and promote the lighthouse in his town, and he has for some time donated time to a boat-building activity. Bob spends winter months in Florida and travels to California on occasion. He misses the friends he was close to at Colby, but he pleases Mary and me with his visits.✹ After living in Maine for 30 years, and loving it, Joan and Dave Morse have moved to Massachusetts to be closer to family. They both continue to enjoy good health and frequent visits from children and grandchildren. Dave and Joan walk a lot, and they also enjoy long rides through the countryside. Maine’s loss is a gain for Massachusetts, which I’m sure has welcomed a wonderful couple.✹ Betsy Fisher Caldwell writes that after 65 years she has moved from Birmingham to Nashville, Tenn., and is very happy with the move. Betsy has seven great-grandchildren. That is seven more than yours truly. I’ll have to tell my grandchildren to get busy! I’m certain Betsy keeps busy with family matters.✹ Mary and I planned once again to forego a trip south for the winter and happily stayed in Maine. Mary is 92 and I’m 94, so long trips that were okay a few years ago seem a lot longer now. Also, we enjoy going to the Colby basketball and hockey games. I encourage classmates out there who have not responded to our request for news to do so. It’s painless, and people do like to hear how their classmates are doing. Send me an email anytime.\n\nBarbara Easterbrooks Mailey\n\nclassnews1953@colby.edu\n\nGoing through the notes I received, I see that almost everyone said something about the pandemic, but all are in good health.✹ Priscilla Eaton Billington attended a family wedding in Charlottesville. The bride: Katy Billington ’11, her granddaughter. There were too many Colby friends in attendance to name here.✹ Barbara Studley Barnette wrote about her big Fourth of July celebration in Orleans. It was a barbecue for 120 family and friends, ending with a flag lowering and a loud cannon blast.✹ Alan Whittaker sent some “catch-up” news of years since graduation; 1953 was supposed to be that year, but the Korean War interrupted his plans. He returned four years later, a married man. Going on, he earned his M.B.A. then became a hospital administrator in both New York City and Englewood, N.J. He’s now retired from the Fairfax VA Hospital after 15 years.✹ Rick Tyler is “still hanging in there” as he and his wife play golf, tennis, and take long walks with Winston, their Havanese dog. They still spend summers by the ocean in Maine and hoped to spend Christmas in Victor, Idaho, with their son, grandkids, and great-grandkids. He sends his best to all.✹ Loretta “Tommi” Thompson Staples would like to hear from more classmates about surviving the pandemic, as did she. She said she learned to enjoy her own company. Knitting, no travel, and using technology to keep in touch with Carolyn English Caci and with her sister Susan Thompson Bragg ’69, living in Bangor.✹ John Lee, always in touch, says the year was not good for him, having lost his wife, Cheryl Reed ’67, in 2020 and getting over a number of falls, full of cuts and bruises. His daughter and son-in-law help him, especially financially. Art Eddy ’54 does take him to dinner when in town. He still hopes to attend our 70th reunion.✹ Electra Paskalides Coumou sent a long note about getting through the pandemic; she and her husband gradually attempted to get back to normal. Their main activity has been playing bridge, first online and then in person with only vaccinated couples. In September they took a cruise on the St. Lawrence River from Kingston, Ont., to Québec City, taking careful Covid precautions for peace of mind. In November she and Karl traveled to a family wedding in Arizona. While out West, they visited Palm Springs and Joshua Tree National Park, then went from quiet 29 Palms to the bright lights of Las Vegas. Back home, they enjoy life in a condo community without the worries of snow shoveling or gardening, near two daughters and the grandchildren. Electra noted that she’ll be 90 this year and made it known to family that she expected a big birthday party. She spent February in warm Florida.✹ Back in March 2021, Joyce Maguire Demers sent me photos of her two great-great-grandchildren. She has 17 “greats”: her oldest is 26 and her youngest is almost 2. By comparison, her oldest grandchild is 46 and her youngest son is 57. In October she went to Maine’s Cumberland Fair, where she was surprised to see the Colby woodsmen’s team, giving demonstrations of old logging skills such as chopping, sawing, ax throwing, pole climbing, and many more. The demos drew huge crowds. Coach David Smith gave a little history of the team, saying that it has been going on since the ’50s, but Joyce doesn’t remember it when we were students. Do you?✹ A few days after Christmas, I had a phone call from the son of Diane Chamberlin Starcher ’54. I was saddened to hear that Diane had just passed away after being hospitalized a few days. Diane and I had been together at Sebago Lake for two summers, having lunch on the lake’s edge and taking afternoon walks near her son’s vacation home. It seemed like we had just connected since college; now just a fond memory.\n\nVic Scalise\n\nclassnews1954@colby.edu\n\nJoan Somerville Walsh moved from her old farmhouse in Mars Hill, Maine, after 67 years to the big city of Presque Isle, Maine. While in Mars Hill, she raised potatoes, chickens, and two wonderful sons, David and Greg. Joan does miss her piano. She played at the Methodist church since she was a teenager.✹ David and Carole Bullock Adams left their home of 29 years for a life care center to assist David. Carole has been writing about their Bolivian missionary days and the adoption of a Bolivian boy. Carole enjoys her family, who continue to be deeply involved in the Methodist church.✹ Jim Rapaport is also a Floridian. He and his wife, Dr. Wendy Satin, send greeting to the class.✹ John Krusell retains his good sense of humor in the face of the challenges of living alone. As John says, “I’m responsible for everything.”✹ Tony and Marlene Hurd Jabar have moved from their Florida home back to Waterville and are in an assisted living facility.✹ Sue Johnson and Freeman Sleeper were married for 30 years. In the evening of life, Sue continues to enjoy the company of their four children—Paul, Mark, Deborah, and Jonathan—six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.✹ Bob Anderson was recently hospitalized and now has transitioned to a memory care center. His wife, Sally, faithfully visits with him daily.✹ Mary Mastin Campbell and her husband, Bill, a 2015 Nobel Prize recipient in medicine, have lived for the past 12 years in the Edgewood retirement community in North Andover, Mass. You can read more about their life together and Bill’s groundbreaking work in eradicating river blindness in his biographical memoir, Catching the Worm. It’s available through Amazon.✹ Chris Henderson Harper remains in touch with Diane Chamberlain Starcher (who sadly passed after Chris reported in). They both worked together in their youth at a restaurant in Ocean Park, Maine. Chris is well but was getting cold with a bit of snow. She keeps warm with a constant flow of books from Amazon.✹ Helen Cross Stabler shared a Colby moment. It was between semesters in January and bitterly cold outside. Bored by hours of bridge, she and some fellow co-eds ventured to walk to town for coffee and an English muffin. Time and again they were beaten back by the strong winds and the cold and returned to their dorm. “That was winter at Colby.”✹ Peter Fishbin enjoys keeping in touch with sporting events. His last time on campus was for the opening of the new art museum wing. He expressed amazement at the expanded Colby campus.✹ Tom Hunt expressed gratitude for his “very reasonably good health.” Further, he was grateful to be able to see, hear, walk, think, taste, and smell; to have abundant food, warm clothes, warm bed, and home; and to have a loving family who offer constant support. “How I use these treasures of my life is my challenge. It is to live life the best I’m able with constant thanks to the Holy Spirit of Jesus.”✹ Don Grout has been living in his new home in Lake Placid for more than a year. He enjoys the beautiful community and continues to farm the land. Don turned 90 in December.✹ Robert “Whitey” Thurston related, “I keep physically active by playing shuffleboard and ping pong, shooting pool, riding a tricycle with my dog in the rear basket, walking, and strength training on Zoom. To keep mentally active, I read books, am addicted to my iPad and smartphone, play cribbage, and write occasional memoirs for family consumption.”✹ Art Eddy: thank you for 17 years of inordinate service as our class correspondent.✹ Dick Leerburger shared this wonderful memory: “Many years ago, I was science editor for LOOK magazine and was invited by the National Science Foundation to travel to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, to report on science work at the various U.S. bases there. I was fortunate to reach the South Pole some 850 miles south of McMurdo to report on the station’s scientific work housed beneath the ice cap. While talking to several ‘residents,’ I encountered a young seaman, whose job was to handle all communications. I introduced myself, and he replied: ‘I’m Seaman Charlie Koons.’ I replied, ‘My college geology professor was also named Koons, Donaldson Koons.’ Charlie replied: ‘Oh, you went to Colby? That’s my dad.’” Just proves Colby has a very long reach.\n\nCharlene Roberts Riordan\n\nclassnews1956@colby.edu\n\nKathy McConaughy Zambello is well but stays close to home. This spring she’s planning a trip to Vero Beach to see Chris Layer Larson. It all depends on the traveling situation.✹ Barbara “BJ” Davis Howard likes following the lives of eight grandchildren. She celebrated two weddings, one in Baltimore, the other in Philadelphia. Of the two grand-twins who grew up in her home, one is an attorney in Los Angeles, the other is a physician there. She enjoys church and its programs and an art group with friends. She also spends time with a sister, who lives nearby.✹ Robert Weiss is part of a multi-generation Colby family: his father, Class of 1924; a sister, Barbara Weiss Alpert ’53; his brother-in-law, Hershel Alpert ’53, and a grand-niece now attending Colby.✹ Janet Nordgren Meryweather, a snowbird since 1986, arrived in Florida after Thanksgiving and feels that the milder climate has extended her life, now revolving around an expanding family. When she married Steen, she took on his children as well. They called the family the “Brady Bunch of Bar Harbor.” She now has 10 grands, with two more to come in March and June. After surgery for left broken ankle bones and recovery time, she could tend her gardens, even though her beautiful peonies had passed. Her attitude, adapted from Clint Eastwood’s motto, is: “I will not let the old lady in.”✹ Franklin Huntress says that the past two years have taken their toll in separation and necrology lists. He found hope and happiness when he visited Mayflower Hill with a family whose son loves the College and its life: “educational buildings for all manner of learning to flourish, not only on campus but also in downtown Waterville, and an athletic facility second to none. Thanks to Paula and Peter Lunder, the Alfond Foundation, and numerous donors, art and music are alive and well.” He hopes that our class will be able to get together in June for old times and to see how Colby has entered into the new age.✹ Pam Honsberger writes of Karl Honsberger’s passing July 13, 2021, from Parkinson’s and other maladies.\n\nDon Tracy\n\nclassnews1957@colby.edu\n\nI (Don Tracy) truly enjoy being correspondent because I get to read what’s happening in our classmates’ lives, respond to their news, and trade a few pictures.✹ Cedric Harring (cfh81@me.com) says hello from the dry West. “Arlette and I moved to Midway, Utah, a year ago and love the high and currently too-dry climate. Sunshine is all but nonstop. We’re about 45 miles from Salt Lake City. I gave up skiing last year because I couldn’t handle the steep terrain and didn’t wish to simply putter about on the beginner slopes.” They hoped to fly to Boston for Christmas to visit family and then return to Tucson, where they winter in a 39-foot motorhome and e-bike on 130-plus miles of paved bike and hiking trails. “Other places we’ve visited are Palm Springs and Ely, Nev., where I spent a couple of hours driving a steam locomotive on the northern Nevada Railroad. Next year, I’ll try driving a diesel electric. Some of us oldies never grow up.”✹ Dick and Marilyn “Perk” Perkins Canton (perk607@aol.com) are still in good shape. “We’re happily in Naples, Fla., then always off to Maine in mid-July, hopefully for this year, too. Life has been good for us. As mentioned, we’re active (some days ‘yes,’ some ‘not so much’) playing golf, walking beaches, visiting good friends, and communicating with our families. I loved my Colby years with so many good friends, Chi O, and lots of activities. Judy Prophett Timken and I still keep in touch after being roomies for four years.✹ John Conkling (neac@metrocast.net) remains busy. “I hope to be skiing in January. My dear wife, Nancy, is in bad shape and will have an operation in February on her spine that should get her back into good health. We still want to get back to Colby next spring to observe what’s going on downtown and on campus. It’s amazing how Colby has grown.”✹ Ronald Rasmussen (raz2005@msn.com) has help around his home since he’s paralyzed. “My son, along with his wife and 6-year-old daughter, all live with me. They’re a blessing, and I thank God for them and my other children and grandchildren. I remain grateful for my excellent health and for living in a free country.”✹ Judy Prophett Timken (jptimken@gmail.com) remains active. “A year ago, Bill and I moved from our home of 47 years in Lafayette, Calif., to a smaller home in Walnut Creek closer to our older children. Bill’s health had been deteriorating for five years and it was time to downsize. On Sept. 27, 2021, Bill passed away with all of us by his side. His memorial was held Oct. 31, where 300 masked and vaccinated friends and family celebrated his life. He touched many lives in positive ways. We haven’t been close to the College in some years, but it’s where Bill and I met. Our journey together lasted 64 wonderful years. One of Bill’s colleagues always urged him to attend the ‘big game’ (Cal vs. Stanford football). Bill always said ‘no’ and finally told him, ‘The big game for me is Colby vs. Bowdoin.’ Yes, Bill’s sense of humor never waned, and his mind remained sharp to the end.”✹ The latest adventure for Michaline “Mikki” Mano (michalinemanno@gmail.com) was an unexpected move to Wilmington, N.C., to be near her daughter. “The original plan was to spend the fall and winter months there and the other months at my seaside home in New Jersey. However, last August I put the Ocean Grove, N.J., property up for sale to test the market. To my amazement, it sold instantly. I’m beginning a new chapter in my golden years but still thanking God for so many blessings and wonderful experiences.”✹ That brings the news to a close. Linda and I still have six children, four of them and families living nearby in Maine. As I was composing this, our conure parrot perched nearby, but only for a while. He became bored because my attention was on sharing your news and not his tweets, which repeatedly exclaimed, “pretty bird.” Okay, Kiwi, I told the entire class your news, too!\n\nMary Ellen Chase Bridge\n\nclassnews1958@colby.edu\n\nDoug Hatfield has fully retired from almost 60 years of practicing law in Hillsboro, N.H. He and his wife, Judy (Ingram ’60), have moved to a retirement community in Concord, and Doug is happy to have much more time to read and celebrate the fact that Colby is flourishing.✹ Larry LaPointe is retired after 57 years of teaching, the last 30 at the University of Maine, Augusta, where he worked with veterans, helping them adjust to a new life and improve their writing skills. He’s busy with family, especially spending time with his eight grandchildren, who keep him young by inviting him to dance recitals, gymnastic meets, soccer and basketball games, and concerts like the Jersey Boys and Pentatonix. He reciprocates by taking them to shows at the Brunswick Music Theater. Larry has fond memories of our time at the College and felt especially sad to note the passing of his fraternity brother Ernie Gauer.✹ Jane Gibbons has been splitting her time between Southern California and Sweden, Maine, and decided to make the Maine farmhouse her permanent residence. Housemates include her daughter, son-in-law Greg, and 15-year-old granddaughter, who joined her when Fryeburg Academy, Greg’s employer, could no longer supply housing for a family of three. Jane’s life is now a bit more lively and challenging: having three housemates, struggling to heat the 1828 dwelling, and managing transportation for four varied schedules. “Having two electric cars helps.”✹ John and Marian Woodsome Ludwig were in Germany for five weeks during the winter holidays, traveling with a wheelchair and walker for Marian and instant testing and masks for everyone. They have many family members abroad, including a new great-grandchild for a total of five in Germany and one in the States. Both of the Ludwigs are “hanging in … with the world … the pandemic … our health.” (Congratulations!)✹ In September my college roommate Susan Sherman White and I spent a few days in a second-floor apartment on Beacon Hill, charming and comfortable, including a rooftop garden, but no elevator. We had been warned there were 50 stairs to climb and pretended to be in training during the summer. With seven round trips, we climbed or descended a total of 700 steps at the apartment alone, not counting our tour of Fenway Park, visit to the Museum of Modern Art, tours of historic buildings, trips on the subway, and up and down the hill. Not bad for a couple of 85-year-olds. You can bet we congratulated ourselves!✹ Isn’t it hard to believe, as I write at holiday time, that we’re headed into our third winter trying to escape the virus? My hope is that you are all well and safe and that I will hear from more of you the next time! Like Marian and John, “Keep hanging in!”\n\nJoanne K. Woods\n\nclassnews1959@colby.edu\n\nBill and Edo Foresman Donaldson moved from Florida to southwest Virginia in May to be near their daughter. Edo writes that there are advantages to having family around, though she misses the warm weather. It’s a rural area by Smith Mountain Lake, created in 1966 by damming the Roanoke and Blackwater rivers. They’re an hour from the Blue Ridge Parkway and love to see the mountains in the background. And they’re on a golf course, which makes Bill happy. Edo is back to water aerobics, but at an indoor pool. They’re both blessed with good health. Edo is in touch with June Landry Wiechmann and Kathy Kies Madden.✹ John and Denny Kellner Palmer moved into their new condo Dec. 10, 2020. They should have made the big move sooner. They’re on the same street as their old 1790s house. At the moment, health issues are at bay and manageable. Fingers crossed! Denny talked with Nancy Little Ready in Ohio, who sounded wonderful and, even though out of touch with Colby, was glad to hear from Denny. Denny caught her up on happenings in Waterville and the campus and hopes to see her this summer when she visits her sister in Maine.✹ Ed Goldberg still lives in Bozeman, Mont. Aside from being involved with a number of nonprofits and being an owner of the last cowboy saloon in the valley, he travels to Vietnam frequently. He’s made many friends there over the years and is struck by their strong sense of friendship, family, and loyalty. Ed says that they’ve forgiven us for invading their country and view us as a balance to an ambitious China.✹ Jack and Pat Richmond Pallotta are able to maintain their snowbird lifestyle of being in the sunny clime of the Fort Myers area in the cold months and hitting the beaches of Avalon, N.J., in the summer. They continue their daily routine of walking, and Jack plays golf three times a week. Add in the comfortable environment of their club, Fiddlesticks, and it’s like being back at the YMCA camp, at least as Jack remembers it.✹ Corinne “Tink” Batchelder Weeks is discovering the marvels of modern science and medicine. She had a recent valve replacement, a TAVR, and was happily recovering, thankful to celebrate the holidays.✹ Bill Chapin and Bonnie Brown Potter ’63 have been special friends for almost 10 years. They’ve traveled to Colorado, Illinois, New Hampshire, Maine, and Cocoa Beach recently. They’ve seen Ned Platner ’63 and Jonathan Knowles ’60, heard recently from Buddy Bates ’57, and hoped to see Bill Slade ’57. They also saw Bill Orne ’58 before he died.✹ As I write this, the Covid-19 pandemic is getting worse again with the Omicron variant. I thought we would be getting back to normal by now. Keep well, everyone.\n\nJane Holden Huerta\n\nclassnews1960@colby.edu\n\nArt ’59 and Louise Robb Goldschmidt continue to live happily at Foxdale Village, a Quaker-run retirement community. Louise is on three committees: the Program Committee, which brings speakers and musical groups; the Film Committee, which brings oldies but goodies; and the Trip Committee, which organizes day trips. During the past two years, she’s researched and given two illustrated slide lectures—a new venture for her.✹ Kay and Ralph Nelson flew to Washington State in June for their youngest grandson’s high school graduation and his Eagle Scout ceremony. Ralph suffered heat exhaustion on a hot day’s hike there but was saved by his companions. Life at Ralph’s CCRC has recovered from having food delivered to resident rooms to eating and socializing at “the long table.” They still wear masks in the hallways and at meetings and performances. Ralph and Kay enjoyed Thanksgiving week mask-less with their daughter at a mountain cabin near Asheville. N.C. He thanks Colby’s Outing Club for building his appreciation of the outdoors.✹ Chester Lewis and his wife have mostly stayed at home in East Lansing, doing what they can to avoid Covid. They’re completely vaccinated and boosted. Their longest trip was to visit Chester’s brother-in-law and his family at his vacation home on St. Martin’s Point on the northern shore of Lake Huron, 45 minutes east of St. Ignace in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and five hours from East Lansing. As soon as they heard about Colby’s reunion, they made refundable reservations at a Waterville hotel.✹ Ken Nigro still reads three newspapers a day and goes to Tai Chi three times a week. So glad he grew up when he did and doesn’t want to come back as anyone else.✹ Peter Henderson and his family spent a lot of time at nearby Lake Martin last summer—boating, swimming, and hiking. His lake house is the only place with enough beds for everyone and friends. They had both Thanksgiving and Christmas there. The family is growing: one grandson held his wedding last summer in the middle of a field in Tennessee’s backcountry 40 miles from the nearest town. Think of all the things that could go wrong in that scenario and you’ll have a good idea of what it was like. The ceremony was completed, and no one had a heart attack. The other grandson and his girlfriend are still thinking. The granddaughters so far have other things to do.✹ In the past, Judy Allen Ferretti has traveled with Road Scholar, but because of the pandemic, she’s turned to their virtual programs. She’s taken courses about Yellowstone National Park, Back to Broadway—about theater, and Antarctica. All have been terrific. Judy continues to serve on several nonprofit boards, meeting mostly on Zoom.✹ Juan and I (Jane Holden Huerta) were basically in hibernation until the vaccines came along, but we continue to be cautious and wear masks. Fortunately, just about everyone in our subdivision is vaccinated and boosted. Each time a new variant pops up, we’ve canceled trips to visit our granddaughters. Weekly Zoom, Facetime, and Caribu sessions keep us in contact with sisters Victoria and Alexandra and cousin Juliet. I continue working as a customer service rep for a small software company whose products support duplicate bridge. And I still direct bridge games online. I hope to see everyone in June at Colby!\n\nDiane Scrafton Cohen Ferreira\n\nclassnews1961@colby.edu\n\nAloha! Class President Bob Burke messaged: Donna and I missed seeing you all last year, but the good news is … it’s finally that time again for the great Class of ’61 to begin planning for our 60th reunion! Our reunion will be June 2-5, 2022, and held jointly with the Classes of 1960 and 1962. You’ll receive a save-the-date email followed by a more detailed letter with a fundraising request. It’s been a difficult two years for all of us, and it feels good to be planning this future event!✹ It’s especially wonderful when we hear from classmates we haven’t heard from in a while: Carol Trigg Friedley sends news: “I accomplished a major event last year. I’ve needed knee replacement for decades but chose to be as active as I could with my family. Downhill skiing and swimming are activities we enjoy at our vacation home in Sunriver with our family of 25, which is growing fast. At age 81, I had both knees replaced within nine months of each other. Dave and I have undertaken our dream trip, cruising around the world and celebrating our 60th anniversary.

Over Halloween, I safely flew HNL to JFK on Hawaiian Air to be with my Brooklyn family and see son Bill for the first time in three years. Those highlights and three other interests keep me smiling: Pilates, yoga, and almost daily walks or hikes.✹ Finally, Judy Hoffman Hakola shockingly reported that last year’s 60th virtual reunion on Zoom was attended by Marilyn Blom Evans, George Nix , and herself.

She and a dozen friends rolled over a planned Mongolia trip to 2023, the second postponement on this one. They also postponed a visit to Churchill, Manitoba, to photograph polar bears.

He enjoys volunteering, coaching mock trials, and family life, recently expanded by grandson Douglas, whose family lives nearby. ✹ Jann Semonian Czarnetzski has had a topsy turvy year.

Chris went parasailing with their grandchildren—all three of them at once—300 feet in the air. He says St. Thomas is the same flight time from Boston as South Florida, but much more laid back. They planned to go again in January 2022 and wonder if there are other St. Thomas fans out there. They still hold elected positions in New Hampshire so can’t be true snowbirds yet.✹ Lynne Hudson Treat has been a registered nurse for 35 years and is now retired. She currently volunteers for AARP Washington State’s Fraud Fighters Association, following through on fraud occurring with residents.

One of their more notable clients last year was Cleveland Mayor-elect Justin Bibb. Bill lives on Lake Erie in Euclid, where the city is completing a lakefront restoration/recreation project that borders his street and where he can walk down 40 steps to be in what he says is like a national park. It could be “a model for the whole Great Lakes region.”✹ Earlier this year, Peter Shearston “fired” himself and joined the ranks of the unemployed, entering retirement with mixed feelings. He feels blessed to have worked so long and enjoyed what he did. He’ll miss some of that fulfillment, but he’s eager to start a new adventure: find ways to give back and travel. Peter and Patti attended their son’s wedding in February, and in October spent two and a half weeks exploring the four major Hawaiian islands. At the top of his retirement work list is the development and organization of our Colby 50th reunion photos.✹ Judy and Gary Austin spent several weeks in Maine last summer. Pam and I enjoyed having lunch with them, and I played a round of golf with Gary as well. They returned just before Christmas from a trip to the Galapagos Islands. They stayed on a small, new expedition ship and tendered to shore at least twice a day with local naturalists. They snorkeled with sea lions, marine iguanas, penguins, and giant sea turtles, and they hiked among land iguanas, giant tortoises, albatrosses, and lots of boobies. “Absolutely fascinating, and a great way to wrap up a year of limited travel.”✹ Pam and I had the good fortune of having Dennie and Sandy Hoe, whom also went to the Galapagos last fall, as house guests, after which they moved on to a family reunion in Bar Harbor.

She’ll also learn the ropes of sporting clays competition with her husband.✹ As for many, Christine Celata could only see her grandchildren on Zoom.

The bright spot in 2021 was discovering Zoom Dungeons and Dragons with her daughter as gamemaster.✹ Debbie Anderson and Mike McPhail became grandparents last year! Their first grandchild, Jamie Buncle, was born March 21 to their youngest daughter, Kim, and husband Ian. Their second grandson, Owen Staiger, was born Oct. 17 to their older daughter Holly and husband Marc. They’re thrilled to have the addition of the little rug rats to their family. For now, both daughters live in Seattle, so the new world of grandparenting will certainly be rewarding.✹ Mike Self and son David started a side business selling firewood. At the ripe old age of 76, Mike is out splitting and stacking firewood. He still keeps an eye on Colby hockey and sees they have a new arena with his name on a banner hanging in the rafters.✹ Most trips in 2020 for Mary Langevin Hepler and husband Fred Gallasch were canceled as a result of the coronavirus. They were, however, able to go fly-fishing in Montana on the Madison River in 2020 and 2021, and their 2020 train trip to national parks was rescheduled and happened in June 2021. Mary also enjoyed the ability to spend time riding her horse and with close friends at the Hunt Club.✹ Tom Whidden is still working, but also doing a lot of enjoyable and competitive sailing around the world on a 100-foot sloop named Magic Carpet. This past year they won their two most important regattas: the Maxi World Championships in Porto Cervo, Sardinia, and the Voiles de St Tropez in France. Tom was awarded the prestigious America and Sea Award by Mystic Seaport. But more exciting for Tom and wife Betsy was watching their oldest grandson, Thomas, 15, with his skipper, Freddie Parkins, win the International 420 World Championships in San Remo, Italy, last July. They then came home and won the 420 North Americans in Rochester, N.Y. Finally, a good Whidden sailor!✹ Joani Katz, Debbie Hawks Kelley, and Mark Zaccaria have been working on final preparations for our much belated 50th Reunion to be held this June on Mayflower Hill. See you there!\n\nAnn E. Miller\n\nclassnews1971@colby.edu\n\nGreetings from California, where I’m singing and concertizing with a chorus from Palo Alto! Yes, I’ve been singing with them for over a year—by Zoom. It’s been an amazing musical experience for me, and I’m honored that they’ve let me do this.✹ After working and raising her children for decades, Mary Heffernon thought it was time to offer us an update. She lived in Connecticut for 50 years before selling her house and moving to Mt. Desert Island, Maine. She loves being near family and having Acadia National Park nearby as her retirement playground. (I’m jealous!)✹ Nick Nash feels that all technology hates him; his first email to me was blank. Hahaha. Generally, he says life is really good.✹ Staying healthy and Covid-free have been top priorities for Martha Smith Mickles and her spouse, Calien Lewis. They made a road trip to D.C., Greensboro, and Charlotte for a wedding last fall. They were so excited to travel again that they’ve made plans to visit Iceland in 2022. Martha has a busy July coming up as the company photographer with Opera Maine; afterward, they’ll retreat to her family home on Little Diamond Island for August. She wants Bob Britton, J. Field Reichardt, Duncan Hewitt, Debbie Messer Zlatin, Ernie Simpson, and Brenda Daigle Baker to come to reunion.✹ Joe Greenman writes that a lot has been going on, even during the pandemic. He sold their house and downsized to a condo; it took five months for the renovation to be completed. His daughter recently got engaged, which is great news, but her wedding is too close to our reunion dates. Sadly, he won’t be able to attend. (Can’t she change her date?)✹ Still hiking, skiing, and sailing a Tartan 27 built in 1971, Hal Walker replaced the 50-year old gas engine in 2021. They hope to sail from southern Rhode Island to Canada, possibly on a three-month tour. WOW! Hal, who has a Ph.D. in oceanography, retired last year after a 35-year research career, much of which involved climate change research with the U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development. He has three children.✹ Mike Smith attended the Colby versus “that school in Brunswick” football game with Jim Faulkner, Dennis Cameron, Ron Lupton, and Paul Edmonds. They tailgated with fellow Colby friends Ed Woodin ’69, Dave Lane ’73, Alex Wilson ’73, John Krasnavage ’73, and John Faulkner ’74.✹ Recently elected treasurer of Temple Beth Israel in Waltham, Mass., Alan Levine seems pleased with that result.✹ Katie and Larie Trippet don’t let any dust settle on them. They’re enjoying retirement with nine grandchildren and three great-grandsons … and travel (motorcycle, RV, and cruises). Upcoming is a motorcycle tour in Portugal, a Rhine River cruise, and another trip to Houston for a Rotary convention.✹ Totally enamored with her grandson, Val Thibeau Yates lives happily in Virginia Beach, close to said grandson. They all spent a wonderful Thanksgiving in Raleigh, N.C., with her older son.✹ Bill Simons, who I’ve known since our first day of kindergarten in 1954, won a national award from the American Jewish Press Association: the 40th Annual Simon Rockower Award for Excellence in Writing About Sports for his article “Ballfield or Synagogue: Hank Greenberg’s High Holiday Dilemma.” He and I continue to root for the Red Sox!✹ Feeling brave, finally, Leslie Anderson and her husband moved back to Portland, Maine, after hiding out at their farm in Sedgwick. This was just in time to have her second knee replacement, the recovery from which is coming along. While in Sedgwick, in addition to being productive in her studio, Leslie and Dan loved watching 200 eider ducks frolicking in the tides.✹ Finally, Linda Wallace and husband George got to travel again—to Massachusetts and to Key West for some Jimmy Buffet “Margaritaville” enjoyment.✹ Our reunion committee is busy making plans for June 2022—please come!\n\nNancy Round Haley\n\nclassnews1972@colby.edu\n\nCathie Joslyn is busy working on art for our 50th Reunion in June and says she hopes to see many classmates there.✹ April Nelson McKay wishes everyone good health and happier days in 2022. Last summer she met seven Colby classmates in Maine. Chris and Deb Trescott Pinkham motored their boat to Sebasco, where they met April, Jamie Aronow and Doug O’Heir, Judith Berringer Vanzon, and Sarah Lucy. They had five days of perfect weather, and a wonderful time was had by all. Fifty-plus years after meeting at Colby, their friendships have endured. April believes that’s what makes Colby so special. The group plans to meet again this summer!✹ Kevin ’71 and Pam Fallon Jagla spent the first months of the pandemic at their beachfront home in Jacó, Costa Rica, where the town was empty and beautiful with most of the tourists gone. In July they attended their son’s wedding in Portland, Ore., where there were riots. (They were tempted to march, like the “good old days.”) They report that they’re doing okay, but they miss traveling. They invite anyone traveling in Costa Rica to visit and share their beach house.✹ Dee Fitz-Gerald Sockbeson visited grandkids and wildlife refuges in Jacksonville, Fla., last year. She especially liked Merritt Island, where one can observe Space-X launches. She and husband Henry ’73 enjoy sailing in Mystic, Conn. Recently, Dee discovered stamp collecting and now buys and sells stamps at auctions online. She’d love to hear from other stamp collectors in the class.✹ Sally Chester Williford retired from the bench in Baltimore in October 2021, and more than 300 members of the legal community gathered to celebrate. She started her career as one of a few female criminal defense lawyers in 1979 and ended it as a trial judge for 16 years. She and husband Nick have been married 42 years. They’re seniorizing their family home and enjoying time with their rescues, Buttercup and Beau. Their son lives close by, and they have many good friends. She wishes everyone a healthy 2022.✹ Marilyn McDougal Meyerhans sent a note from Fairfield, Maine, where she and her husband, Steven, are still farming. They’ve grown apples and vegetables for 48 years. This isn’t an easy occupation. Even though Covid restricted travel, they did get to Bozeman, Mont., to visit their daughter’s family, and their kids and grandkids visited them in Maine a good part of last summer. Marilyn and Steven are healthy and strong, but they really can’t believe our 50th is this summer.✹ So, Colby Class of 1972, mark your calendars for the first week in June to return to Mayflower Hill for our 50th Reunion! I sincerely look forward to seeing many of you then. With my best wishes for good health in 2022.\n\nCarol Chalker\n\nclassnews1973@colby.edu\n\nThank you to all who contributed news; I enjoyed hearing from each of you. The recurrent theme is how we’re emerging from the pandemic and how we celebrated turning 70.✹ Anne Huff Jordan writes about the joy in seeing her daughter and family (including two grandkids), who live in Utah. They were finally able to come back East for Christmas. She celebrated her 70th birthday with her son and his wife (who live closer), her daughter (who flew from Utah as a surprise), and extended family; it was a long, special celebration. Anne and her husband are spending more time at their second home in Maine, and they’re grateful for all they have.✹ Cheryl (Booker ’74) and Doug Gorman, daughter Katie ’12, son Bobby ’08, and daughter-in-law Jenn Reilly ’08 are all New Hampshire residents. Doug was able to snag the New Hampshire license plate “Colby-5” to replace “Colby-4” and include Jenn. Doug and Cheryl enjoyed time on Cape Cod during the warm weather, but unfortunately, they’re both dealing with long-term health issues.✹ Bruce Cummings’s “failed retirement” evolved into a new role as a consultant/advisor to healthcare systems, which has been very meaningful. He retired in 2017 from a 40-year career in healthcare that culminated with 27 years as a hospital CEO. A few years later, he was drawn to the epidemic of physician burnout, resulting in his current position. Although this work is meaningful, it’s “not quite as rewarding as being a grandparent to three kids, ages 5, 7, and 7.”✹ Lloyd Benson and wife Pam hosted a 70th birthday party in July. Here’s a brief (redacted) synopsis of the event, narrated by Lloyd. “For the Class of 1973, 2021 was a significant landmark in which many of us turned 70. As a harbinger of better times ahead, the Covid vaccines began to be distributed in early 2021, and the odd variants of Covid had yet to appear. So, the word went forth: we’re having a birthday party! Pam and I agreed to host it at our place on Collins Cove in historic Salem, Mass., and invites zoomed electronically across the country. It took no time at all for responses to flow in. The list of attendees is long, and for space purposes only, spouses and significant others are omitted. The food and liquid libations were both plentiful and fabulous, but hardly met the joy of being together again, fully vaxxed, comfortable, and in the presence of lifelong friends. Sharing in our great day were Joe Mattos, Patty (Kelly ’75) and Bob Landsvik, Alex Wilson, Speedy Lawson (honorary ’73), Ron ’71 and Linda Howard Lupton ’72, John Krasnavage, Dave Lane, Duncan Leith, Phil Ricci, Amy (Brewer ’71) and Gary Fitts, Mike “Spike” LaPenna ’74, Jimmy “Bonzo” Brennan ’74, Kenny “Biggy” Bigelow ’71, Carol Chalker, Jackie Nienaber Appledorn, Margie Berman, Jim ’72 and Lisa Kehler Bubar, Debbie Mael Mandino, Jeff Lentz ’75, Jean Straehl Moss, and Luke Kimball’s widow, Linda. Many kudos to Jim Bubar for making a spectacular birthday cake, for Patty Landsvik’s clam chowder, and, of course, for Speedy Lawson’s unforgettable Stoli Dolis.”✹ Bob Diamond says he continues “to enjoy and treasure my time on the Board of Trustees. The momentum of this leadership team is astounding and a marvel to watch. I was able to get to the campus in October, and the new facilities, in particular the new athletics and recreation center, will blow everyone away. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the 50th. Let’s make it a special time!”✹ Our class is indeed looking forward to our big reunion June 2023. Rick Zaccaro says he hopes to attend. The Reunion Committee has been working hard planning for this significant event where we proudly parade in our 50th Reunion straw hats and present Colby with our reunion donation. If you have not been contacted and want to help in any way, please let me know as we would love to see unanimous involvement. Be well, everyone.\n\nDennis Delehanty\n\nRichard Vann\n\nclassnews1974@colby.edu\n\nAs we write these lines, we’re crossing the threshold leading into our third pandemic year. This month’s villain is omicron, a name we hope you will have forgotten by the time you read these notes. We harbor hope that life will return to normal (or a “new normal”) in 2022.✹ In the meantime, we still have Zoom. Last October several classmates met for a happy hour Zoom call, which was a resounding success, a highlight of the fall social season. (Really!) During our call, our conversation turned to music concerts in the early 1970s both on campus and in Bangor, which led Jane Dutton to suggest the ingenious idea of drawing up a playlist, a sort of class soundtrack, for our 50th Reunion. Jim Heald and your correspondents have volunteered to begin work soon on creating this playlist, and we’re grateful to classmates who have already suggested tunes for this project.✹ News continues to filter in via email. Our bionic classmate, Mark Curtis, has recovered from a left hip replacement to match his right hip replaced earlier. So, it’s back to golf and pickleball for Mark, who stays in close touch with golf partners Art Bell and Remi Browne as well as Rocky Goodhope. Mark recently attended a Colby-Bowdoin hockey game at the new Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center and marveled at the beauty of the place. Mark can’t believe that his granddaughter (!) is a freshman at the University of New England in Biddeford.✹ Shelley Bieringer Rau writes from Turner, Maine, that she is singing again—vaxxed, masked, and spaced—with choral groups in Lewiston and Portland. She was looking forward to performing in December for the first time in two years.✹ Highlights of 2021 for Jan Hampshire Cummins: more outdoor time with friends and family (hiking vs. eating and imbibing!), a wonderful trip to Hawaii in between pandemic spikes, and an eighth grandchild on the way.✹ In early December Judy Sidell Westerlund wrote us a fascinating email filled with news from her home in Sweden. Some excerpts: “It’s dark here in Sweden by 3:30 p.m., but everyone has their little Advent lights on doors, hedges, balconies, so there is a magical atmosphere of light, reflected in the snow. Christmas is almost upon us. Thanks to my daughter-in-law, who believes in celebrating American traditions, we had turkey on Thanksgiving. I made the stuffing, creamed onions, and pumpkin pie. The grandchildren find it amazing that the pumpkin from Halloween can be turned into a pie. … Halloween has arrived in Sweden in full force. After all, the idea of costumes and free candy speaks to any culture. However, there are few who answer the doorbell in full witch attire. These days, approaching 70, my face is becoming scrawnier and more witch-like, so dressing up for Halloween à la USA is perfect. Yeah, wrinkles!”✹ Preparations for our 50th Reunion, led by Deb Wathen Finn and Libby Corydon Apicella, are proceeding swimmingly. The reunion committee has met several times already on Zoom. Though the committee has robust participation, new volunteers are always welcome. What could bring more fun and enjoyment than reconnecting with lost friends, or making new friends, and sharing biographies with your peers? Not to mention contributing to the cause of securing the finest possible education for the generations following in our footsteps? As a first step, please join us on our next Zoom happy hour!\n\nSusie Gearhart Wuest\n\nclassnews1975@colby.edu\n\nThanks to a reminder from his friend Harry Friedman to send news, Tom Huebner did just that. Tom retired in 2018 as president of the Rutland Regional Medical Center in Vermont after serving as CEO for 21 of his 28 years with the hospital. He’s still active in healthcare and serves on several Vermont healthcare boards. For fun he enjoys sailing on Lake Champlain and skiing. Last June Tom and his wife, Tricia, took a beautiful, eight-day raft trip through the Grand Canyon. They have six grandchildren, but trying to see them through Covid has been a challenge as they live in Virginia and Minnesota. Tom has also stayed in touch with his Colby roommate Ed Decker, who recently retired with his wife, Linda, to Porto, Portugal.✹ As of December 31, after 41 years in the field of mental health in various roles, Camilla Moore Doctor decided that it was time to retire from federal service. For the past 31 years, she worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Prior to that, she worked for the Department of Defense. Camilla stated that it’s been her honor to serve our country’s active-duty service members, veterans, and their family members during her career. Future plans include helping her sister care for their 96-year-old mother, enjoying her three grandchildren, ranging from 8 months to 19 years, and spending time with her husband, David, who decided to retire again. His first retirement was from the Army, his second from working as an Army contractor. Celebrating their 42nd wedding anniversary in December, they now look forward to the next chapter in their lives.✹ With Covid restricting his usual travel, Ed Walczak opted to take “staycations” where he lives in Manhattan, visiting more museums and attending more plays and concerts in the city. However, after receiving his second shot, he managed a ski trip to Alta, Utah, in late March 2021. Ed still plays a fair amount of singles tennis, but he’s not sure how many more years he’ll be able to vigorously run around the court chasing down balls from 30- and 40-year-olds!✹ Carol Majdalany Williams has two granddaughters to celebrate, born within three months of each other. Living in New Hampshire makes it hard to get to Virginia, where they both live. At least Skype and Zoom make things somewhat easier. Carol looks forward to our upcoming reunion in June.✹ Gene DeLorenzo and his family live with 50 animals on an impromptu farm in Cornwall, Vt. Sheep, goats, and chickens galore! Son Perry graduated from Middlebury College, and son Douglas from Castleton University. Daughter Katharine’s Middlebury field hockey team won its fourth consecutive (fifth in six years) NCAA Division III national championship in December by defeating Johns Hopkins. The pandemic cost the school a full year of athletic competition, but many seniors returned for a year of completion and it paid off well. Gene feels that there are still exemplary young people in our midst, despite all the challenges of the very tough past decade. He remains in touch with Bill Walthall and has occasional get-togethers with Colby friends from (goodness!) almost 50 years ago.\n\nRobert Weinstein\n\nclassnews1976@colby.edu\n\nGreetings, ’76ers! What a year … again! Hoping many of you will visit Waterville this June for reunion. Meanwhile, here’s some class news.✹ Florida-based Tony Shupin attended an October KDR reunion in Georgia. He saw several ’76ers, including “his roommate Bob Cooper, the inimitable Mark Janos, the highly refined Jay Sarson, his Florida-based brother Brian Kiely, and the ‘tres incroyable’ Monsieur Paul Philbin. A great time was had by all.”✹ David Systrom remains a pulmonary and critical care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Sadly, he notes, Covid has been good for business. David conducts exercise-related research, including on the Covid long-hauler with interesting results he hopes will lead to treatment. His daughter, Hannah, is completing her medical residency at Boston’s BI-Deaconess Medical Center and was accepted for a GI fellowship at Dartmouth. (It turns out Hannah will be working with my nephew, who’s on the Dartmouth faculty!) Hannah’s twin, Conor, works in the music business in Vancouver, B.C. Both will be married next summer, and guess who’s footing the bill? David saw his old TDP roommate Jack McKeon at a wedding last summer; apparently, his handicap is substantially better than David’s.✹ Barry Rabin writes that despite the pandemic, the past year was kind to his immediate family. He reduced his ophthalmology office hours to two days a week; semi-retirement has worked out nicely (less stress while still taking care of his patients). Barry and his wife, Susan, enjoy having their daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter, 3 1/2, living across the street. Meanwhile, their Richmond-based son and daughter-in-law visited over Thanksgiving. Barry and Susan hope to see everyone at reunion. Barry keeps in touch with Peter Leschner, Gil Becker, and Martin Hubbe.✹ Mitch Brown is grateful his two daughters, who’ve been working on the pandemic frontlines, have stayed well. The last of Mitch’s four daughters graduates high school this May; he and his wife look forward to some time for themselves. Mitch owns and runs an international tutoring business (International Education Services) specializing in English, ESL, and history, including AP levels. He has domestic and international students from fourth grade through college. He also manages the family property-management business and plays soccer for a high-level team that has been to the Nationals for four of the past seven years. He summarizes: There’s so much to learn, so many students to help, so many things to discover!✹ Jed Snyder has entered the ranks of the “semi-retired,” which he notes is admittedly just a euphemism for an employed senior citizen. After 40+ years in the national security/foreign policy community—including service in the USG, the policy research community, and academia—Jed decided to look for his next opportunity, though he’s not sure where that might emerge. He remains engaged with longtime professional associations like the Council on Foreign Relations and may still produce another book.✹ After 37 years with their school, Stillwater Montessori, Joe ’75 and Joanne Defilipp Alex retired in June 2019. Joanne continues to teach at College of the Atlantic. She walks every day and was close to her goal of 365 consecutive days of more than 10,000 steps. Joanne’s developing her skills as a nature photographer; one highlight was capturing two barred owls “talking” with each other. Joanne recently led a science lab for a University of Maine class (her former environmental club) and was able to reconnect with many former students. Joe and Joanne look forward to our upcoming reunion—which closes this column with a reminder that our reunion is June 3-5; we’ll share it with the Classes of 1975 and 1977. Remember to donate to the Colby Fund. I’m serious about reaching out to an old classmate who’s been on your mind. Be well and stay safe!\n\nRuss Lowe\n\nclassnews1977@colby.edu\n\nStill based in New Delhi, Qaiser Kahn has continued working with the World Bank leading their social protection work on India. The last two years have been spent working on how to support the hundreds of millions who are affected by the Covid lockdown in India. Knowing he has helped the 800 million people made vulnerable by the lockdown is a great way to finish 33 years at the World Bank. Congratulations! Qaiser plans to retire to northern Virginia in May, but there may be some follow-up work left to finish in India, which is why he hasn’t yet committed to joining our reunion June 3-5.✹ Susan Inches was headed back to Colby to teach Advocating for the Environment during Jan Plan. It’s her fourth year doing this! She says the students are bright, engaged, and fun to work with. During the Covid lockdown, she published a book, Advocating for the Environment, How to Gather Your Power and Take Action, based on her Jan Plan course. It’s a citizen’s guide to environmental action—a book we really need right now. Even though Susan transferred to College of the Atlantic after sophomore year, Colby continues to play an important role in her life.✹ Peter Cohn has many activities to keep him busy during retirement. He’s teaching science via an agency for homebound students. Currently, he’s teaching one student one day a week for two hours. He and his wife plant an organic “grow-to-give” garden, he volunteers weekly at a food bank, and he attends an in-person discussion group weekly to air opinions on politics, climate change, education, race, sex, and other “hot button” issues. When the weather cooperates, he does winter canoeing on freshwater lakes on the Carmans River, LI. Peter’s son worked from home last winter as he did last year, and that meant more skiing in the Northeast and out West. He also loves long walks with his daughter’s rescue beagle when she comes to visit from Brooklyn.✹ Kevin Farnham is semi-retired, working on his second novel, titled Twelve Sonnets. He writes under the pen name “Coemgen” (an early-Irish spelling of “Kevin,” Saint Coemgen, Abbot of Glendalough, Ireland). His first novel, I Face My Love, written just before his heart attack, is available in print form everywhere.✹ Brett Thacher has lived in Canton, N.Y., for 20 years, where his wife, Pamela, is a professor at St. Lawrence University. Their two youngest boys are both freshmen, Charles at Skidmore and Samuel at Stony Brook. Their oldest is finding his way as the pandemic disrupted his plans. Brett continues to manage some rental properties they own in Canton village. Most importantly, he still cuts several cords of wood entirely by hand annually as befits a former Colby woodsman.✹ Ray and Kim Ayer McVeigh had dinner with Larry and Lauren Spiegel Goldman at the Clam Shack, in Salem, Mass. What a great way to spend an evening enjoying views of the Atlantic Ocean and a spectacular sunset.✹ And finally, Mark Richardson encourages everyone to get back to Colby for our Reunion Weekend the first weekend in June. Should be a great time to talk/laugh/reconnect and see all that has changed on campus and in Waterville. If anyone has suggestions or ideas for the weekend, please let him know.\n\nLisa Mathey Landry\n\nclassnews1978@colby.edu\n\nGreetings, and thank you for the abundance of news!✹ Clarke Moody retired in 2020. He and his wife, Betsy, divide their time between Florida and Rhode Island and enjoyed a month on their boat cruising the Intracoastal Waterway. He’s chair of a craft-liquor distillery in New Jersey called Sourland Spirits. Grandchild number two is on the way! He’s in touch with Russ Lodi and Liz Gruber.✹ Nick Levintow remains busy working for the United Nations and the U.S. Agency for International Development, seeking effective ways to allot U.S. foreign aid. He plans to leave Washington and return to Maine or North Carolina.✹ After 36 years, Henry Sigourney has retired from software development and lives in Vermont, where he enjoys “deeper terrain” skiing. He sees Don Lavoie ’79 and Steve Martin ’80 regularly.✹ Steve and Dian Weisman Miller retired to The Villages, Fla. They hoped to resume cruising this winter.✹ Still running the Moody Group, his financial services firm, John Breedlove has five grandchildren—two in college and one just starting—and a couple of high schoolers. He sends good wishes!✹ Tom Gilligan enjoys a retirement full of golf, photography, art, Colby friends, and his four grandchildren.✹ Writing songs, which can be easily streamed, Phil Redo lives in Brunswick and plans to visit Colby to see the new buildings.✹ Betsy William Stivers works in professional and financial regulation for the Maine attorney general. She and husband John ’81 have two grown children, and they’re all thriving.✹ A professor at North Carolina State University since 1987, Paul Fackler plans to retire in June, move back to Maine, and continue work in natural resources.✹ Jeff Wheeler’s daughter is getting married in August! He recently had a “mean salmon dinner” with Peter Schmidt-Fellner.✹ Maureen Johnston retired from IT management for the University of New Hampshire. She’s been busy downsizing and visiting with Nancy Thomson Hansen and Linda Donnell Lauritano. She’s also visited Swan’s and Monhegan islands to view her husband’s lighthouse restoration work.✹ Married for 39 years to Tari, David Van Winkle is a physics professor at Florida State University. They have three children and are proud grandparents of their first grandchild!✹ Laurie Phillips McCracken has lived on Boston’s North Shore for 40 years and sees Colby alumni regularly. She balances retirement and starting a small sales and marketing business. “Hello” to Foss Hall friends Kim Marsh Valentine, Sarah Bryan Severance, Portia Frazee Graham, and Sandy Hall Lake.✹ In July Charlie Hurd went “old-man hiking/backpacking” with Paul Wolf, spending one week in the Cloud Peak Wilderness and another in the Tetons. They had lots of fun.✹ Ben Thorndike recently visited Waterville and Colby. He raved about the partnership between the two entities as well as the new Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center. As class president, he’s responsible for orchestrating a spectacular 45th reunion in 2023 and hopes all will attend. Working remotely in Chatham during the pandemic, he’s had good times with his children and dogs and counts himself fortunate for his Colby friendships.✹ In August Ethel Bowden retired from Central Maine Community College and was nominated for faculty emeritus. She enjoys life in MidCoast Maine, especially on the water with other kayakers.✹ Larry Hill works in business development for a boutique consulting firm and develops software for salesforce.com. Over Christmas, he drove from Denver to San Diego with his son, and he planned to visit Betsy Judd Butler on the way. He’s played golf with Doug Giron and Chip Child and has seen John Geismar and Bob Bower ’80 as well as the alumni whose news follows.✹ John Devine recently saw Ed Smith and Laura Hyer. In December John attended the Colby-Bowdoin hockey game at Colby’s Harold Alfond Center, a game we won 3-1! Sandy Buck was also there. Other fans included Sue (Conant ’75) and Jim Cook, who relocated to Portland after they retired, Jim from the Skowhegan school system, where he was a K-6 specialist, and Sue from Colby. Brian and Michele Fortier Cullen were also there to cheer on the Mules, as were Kelley (Keefe ’80) and Mike Slavin. Earlier in the day, Mike was in goal for the Alumni Hockey Game. Other skaters included Dean Morrissey ’79 and Dale “Whitey” Hewitt ’80. Mike and Kelley expected their first grandchild in January.\n\nCheri Bailey Powers\n\nclassnews1979@colby.edu\n\nHappy New Year 2022! Betsy Bucklin Reddy spent much of 2021 traveling to see family and friends in eight different states. She visited Phil and Emily Grout Sprague at their new home in Sylvia Lake, N.H. Her best news is that she’ll join the Grandparents’ Club in March when daughter Emily and son-in-law Adam add to their family. Living in Vermont, Betsy can visit often and see daughter Maggie, who moved there in 2019. Betsy plans to retire in May from real estate.✹ Laurie Borden is a palliative/hospice educator, as a certified thanatologist and end-of-life doula. Her key passion is grief companioning. In 2021 she underwent a massive move to Montana and hoped to find a part-time position once she and her 96-year-old mother were settled. Laurie hopes to hear from classmates in Montana for contacts.✹ David Ashcroft started a new phase in life with the new year: retirement after a 42-plus year career in risk management and insurance. All children are out on their own, so plans are to travel in 2022 and volunteer with youth mentoring.✹ Colby’s alumnae basketball event in November brought “the Legends” to the new athletic facility: Jan Barker, Patty Valavanis Smith ’80, Amy Davidoff, and Sarah Russell MacColl. Sarah won the alumnae free-throw contest with an astonishing 2-for-10. “Not much jump left in my shoes for this Medicare-enrolled athlete,” Sarah writes. She’s back into full swing teaching essentrics at Fort Williams, with the view of the lighthouse and breezes during the summer and her small, relatively safe studio the rest of the year.✹ One of the community theater groups that Meg Matheson is involved with figured out how to bring live theater back by offering outdoor performances. The play was written years ago riffing on old-timey radio shows: comedy, soap opera, mystery, songs, and ad jingles. Everything from rehearsals to performances was held outdoors. Best of all, since it was on a radio soundstage, scripts were in hand! Not having to learn lines was a plus (getting trickier to learn lines as the years go by…).✹ A career change for Bob Kinney last year. After 13-plus years with the NJ Attorney General’s Office practicing environmental law, Bob retired from state service and joined a small general practice firm in NJ. He said it’s been interesting and very different from his prior life in public service. He hopes to continue to be a problem-solver for his new clients.✹ I finally heard from Janet Bruen Deering after all her travels. She and Phil ’77 visited their granddaughter, Zaya (like papaya), who is 17 months old and climbing like a vine! They’re gearing up for two daughters getting married in July and September. Phil has “mostly” retired after 44 years in insurance, so they celebrated with a three-year trip hiking Italy’s Amalfi Coast. Over the summer Janet saw Libby Maynard Gordon, Weld Butler ’80, and Kim Rossi Nichols, enjoying Colby connections. Janet is proud to be part of the strong Colby Mule pack and the strides that Colby has made in the community.✹ I enjoyed a quick trip to Glenwood Springs in November to meet up with Keenan and Kathy Bleakney Pawley. They were traveling around Utah visiting various national parks and state parks. We spent the night at the Glenwood Springs Lodge and enjoyed the hot springs immensely! The weather was perfect and the hot springs restorative, so much so that my massage therapist did a Swedish massage for the first time (not the usual deep tissue). I hope that 2022 is better than the last two years have been and that we can all get together—hot springs, barbecues, and reunions.\n\nKevin Fahey\n\nclassnews1980@colby.edu\n\nAlso living in the relatively balmy Washington, D.C., area, I have to agree with Mimi Brodsky Kress that it’s now so much harder to take cold weather than when we were at Colby and younger. Mimi reports that life in the world of custom-home building has been very busy over the past year, but also the most difficult to navigate since she started in the business almost 40 years ago. Lack of building lots, increased demand for new homes, supply chain issues, and off-the-charts price increases have made it a lot less fun, but she’s thankful to be busy. She’s very proud that her company, Sandy Spring Builders, was chosen as one of 16 “Top Places to Work” in the area and once again was voted “Best Custom Builder” by the readers of Bethesda Magazine, as they have been every year since the awards began. On the personal side, Mimi is still very active and sits on several nonprofit boards, mostly dealing with mental health and domestic violence issues. She and her husband enjoy time on their 30-foot Catalina sailboat, Stella Blue (her Deadhead Colby friends will appreciate that). Their son, Max, who has faced mental health challenges most of his life, is learning to write blogs. Their daughter, Jenna, has her M.S.W., lives in San Jose, and works for a nonprofit training other organizations, schools, and government agencies on restorative justice practices in order to divert youth out of the juvenile detention system. Mimi keeps in touch with Gretchen Huebsch Daly and Debbie Pugh Kelton. She attended a Colby couple wedding in September in Oregon: Carly Rushford ’13 and Chris Eden ’14.✹ Rebecca Brunner-Peters reports that 2020-21 was a very difficult time for her, health-wise. While playing a club championship tennis match, she suffered a brain aneurysm and had to spend the next six months in rehab. Although her left side was initially paralyzed, she’s thankfully now more or less doing okay. She’s looking forward to her upcoming retirement, which is mandatory for women at 65 in Switzerland, whe"
