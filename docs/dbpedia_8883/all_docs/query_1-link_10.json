        "text": "As music scenes go, Worcester is kind of interesting. Not as big as, say, Boston, but big enough that there’s a diversity of artists, in any number of genres. The scene has produced several generations now of exceptionally talented musicians, but as nothing happens in a vacuum, we asked a wide range of local artists about which local musicians influenced them, and how. The result was a love-filled tour of the history of local music, and an illustration of how small shows, and especially small acts of kindness, can reverberate far and long across a music scene. Here's what they said:\n\nNiki Luparelli: All of these things happened back a million years ago when Worcester was still in black and white. Mr. Giangregorio at middle school told my grandparents that I really had something and they should send me to voice lessons to develop it so for awhile I studied with Jerry Newby when I was a teenager and he started me on the right track and taught me about stage performing. After college where I got a music degree but was only doing standup comedy and the Steamy Bohemians, then Jerkus Circus, I was bartending at Vincent’s on Sunday afternoons and Jon Short would play. He was so kind when I told him I sang and would let me sing a few songs with him. I realized I really wanted to be singing behind the mic instead of slinging behind the bar. Andy Cummings is another old friend and probably the first person I ever sang with that wasn’t a choir instructor. He was one of the best guitarists I had ever heard (and still is) and he used to let me sing “bell bottom blues” with him at the Java Hut. For stage presence and overall vibe, Lucky Parker made such an impression on me. Everything about him and his shows was so good looking, slick and thought out. The look, the mic, the marketing materials, and when he had me come sing some duets with him at Ralph’s, it really lit a fire for me.\n\nMilo from Eye Witness: the only person that comes to my mind is Roger Lavallee of The Curtain Society. I love the city of Worcester, but honestly never felt any real connection to most of the music coming out of the city. Most of the music I heard when I first started going to shows in clubs and bars was way too aggressive and heavy or white guys singing the blues and neither really resonated with me. But when I first heard the Curtain Society, it surprised me they were a Worcester band. They weren't anything I was used to in the area. Roger's lyrics and songwriting always really impressed me and loved his guitar playing. They will always have a special place in my heart and wish they played out more. Plus he is just a sweetheart of a man and been so helpful with recording projects and helping with musical gear questions.\n\nMolly-Jane Gain: Secret Sage. Met these guys at the Lucky Dog back in 2012 and we have been great friends ever since. It was a dream of mine to play alongside them and now I get to. Their unique style and energy on stage was always something I admired.\n\nJafet Muzic: I've always indulged in music from different places when it comes to my influences stylistically, but the influence I gained from local artists is really more from the aspect of the independent grind. Growing up seeing artists like Alex Fatt (WARecords) thrive, he would always show love to our projects (Great Brook Valley). It really gave us something to look up to as kids, knowing he pushed his own independent music label while gaining traction on a global level always made an impression on me culturally. Also seeing all of the hard work from artists like Joyner Lucas, Elijah Divine, Big O, Big Nate just to name a few. I really just respect the overall efforts and constant push these artists have made throughout the years. It truly inspires me to keep pushing and represent the city as well.\n\nKeri Anderson: There are so many Worcester musicians that have inspired me to be able to keep writing, making music and performing, even when club owners and business has been forever changing. As you may know, being a female vocalist and looking for that killer lineup of musicians who are as versatile as me is hard to find. Craig Rawding, another versatile soulful singer that had influenced me and one that I had collaborated in songwriting and putting bands together for years, is one. Duncan Arsenault is also another versatile drummer/collaborator; Mike Lynch, electric soul and blues guitar; Clay Brown, electric guitar blues; Brian Rost, bass, and Jeff Burch, bass. Niki Luparelli is so great about reinventing herself time and time again and handles her own business with the help of local and nonlocal Worcester musicians; Dan Burke, I have to credit his versatility for playing solo or with a band. His voice and his piano playing lends itself to the highest standards. There are so many! Jon Bonner amazing voice and finger picker, knows countless songs and plays each one with such ease. Sarah French is an amazing folk singer/writer who now wants to make music her career because of all the great influencing musicians in Worcester.\n\nDavid Jahn: Muffy and the Patriots. My introduction to Wormtown. Let me hang out at rehearsals and snuck me in underage whenever they could. Some of my very first gigs were opening for them &mldr; Oct. 29, 1983, I faked my way into Xit and saw Muffy open for Holy Cow and the Calves. I was gob smacked they would talk to me like I belonged.\n\nKevin Kvein of Bobbing for Apples: I don't know if there is one artist but there is a memory of an event changed everything for me. I went to an open mic at The Raven in Worcester when I was between 18-20 years old. I remember walking into the dark room, vinyl on the walls, people I didn't know at the bar and that night (if I remember correctly) there was the ethereal voice of Molly-Jane Gain, the guitar virtuoso Michael Andreoli, the cool idgaf attitude of Nana Midori, the charismatic Eric Troy, and Eric Fournier who commanded the stage. As I was walking out I remember hearing the conviction and power behind a rapper's voice, which I later realized as Leon Legacy. This was the night that broke my ego. Who the hell was I? This moment inspired me to sing and perform with passion, work hard to become a better musician, improve my interaction with the crowd and those strangers on stage became my heroes I strived to become.\n\nLovina: I know it sounds like a cop-out but I would have to say my Dad, Roy Guimond. He used to be \"the piano man\" at places like the El Morocco and Other Place Pub many years ago. I recall him coming home from a gig with a hundred dollar bill (in the '80s when I was a little kid) and it seemed like a million dollars to me. He even had his own business cards printed up in gold lettering on glossy black cards. I guess I thought he was famous! I have a distinct memory of my Dad jamming with other musicians around a campfire to The Beatles' \"Rocky Raccoon\" at a summer party as a child. My Dad can play any instrument he picks up and is 100% self-taught and can't read a note of music; he plays by ear, as do I. I'm also a multi-instrumentalist which I definitely think I get from my Dad. As an adult, we played a couple shows together at Nick's and Vincent's, playing covers from The Beatles to Roy Orbison — the artists I grew up listening to my Dad sing and play on the piano in our living room. I heard my Dad's versions of The Beatles songs before I ever heard the originals. How could he not have influenced me musically?\n\nSean Ryder: That's easy. James Keyes. This man writes amazing songs with soulful lyrics that I can really sink my teeth into. He gets a great sound with his archtop and resonator guitars, foot-stomping device, and harmonica. He keeps it real on stage, playing the songs I need to hear, not necessarily what I think I want to hear. Beyond that, his Bloody Roots festival may have been my first exposure as a fan to the local music scene. I would be remiss if I didn't mention my man Rich Leufstedt aka Amazing Dick. Another killer songwriter, Rich has a humble approach that makes music fun for the whole community. I might never have played again if it wasn't for Rich's Thursday night ukulele open mics at the old Beatnik's. They were SO MUCH FUN. Not to mention his ukulele specialty shows, Gabba Gabba Uke being my favorite.\n\nRaff TheRuler: Etan Draw, formerly known as Dred, influenced me. I grew up watching him make beats and perform locally. Etan Draw then took me on tour with Afroman and Nappy Roots, gave me a chance to perform my music in different states, which made me fall in love with the life I'm living currently making music and traveling, meeting celebrities. He absolutely 100% influenced me and I'm thankful for every minute of it and definitely won't forget it!\n\nMatt Robert: Well, having spent my whole life here, and having been into music from infancy, there have been many, but I’ll name two. Duke Levine: I had heard about this phenom for a long time, before I heard him, even though I first saw him when he was about 17 (and I about 10). He was playing with Crockett at Newton Square and there must have been 2,000 fans. Once I was of age, I started seeing him whenever I could in Worcester and Boston. He is such a good guy and a quiet monster on the guitar. Utterly professional and always fully prepared. The second is Gary Backstrom and Jiggle the Handle. Though neither he nor they are from Worcester, the band really grew out of Clark. I first saw them on a spring day in ‘89 or ‘90 when a friend that attended Clark brought me to a party they played behind Annie’s Clark Brunch. They blew me away and I became a major acolyte from then on, seeing them whenever I could, sharing some bills with them, and introducing anyone I could to them.\n\nDaniel Gay: JJ Rassler. He played in The Odds in Worcester before I knew anything about it, though he’s a Boston guy. DMZ, The Queers, all heroes of mine as a Vermont kid who listened to punk/garage rock. He became a friend when we worked together, and even taught him a piano lesson once or twice. His guitar playing influenced me, but more than that he embodied rock music and that life more than anyone I’ve ever met. And he’s one of the kindest people I’ve met. He sang Worcester’s praises a lot! Also, Bob Jordan &mldr; an unbelievable folk singer. An influence just by being around him. Sharing the stage was/is an honor &mldr; an incredible storyteller.\n\nRoger Lavallee: A huge lightbulb went off for me with a hometown guitar player that my sister was friends with. James Verna was not only an incredible guitar player by any measure, he really inspired me to think outside of the box and helped steer me way far away from the traditional blues-based rock guitar heroes that everyone else seemed to follow. I started walking in new directions and rarely looked back. He would go on to be in several amazing Boston bands including Killjoy and Transmission. I can't overstate the impact that Scott Ricciuti had on me, first with his band Childhood that I would hear on Bay State Rock back when I was in high school and later when working with him and his many projects; Huck, Pony For My Birthday, Pistol Whipped, Preacher Roe, many ads for Adam Cab &mldr; He turned me on to so much cool music and wrote some of my favorite songs ever. Childhood's guitar player, Greg Passler, was my hero from the first moment I saw him at PT Beanie's Music Box on Main Street in early 1993. Another very interesting guitar player who could play literally anything but always found new and unique ways to add texture to a song without ever being cliché.\n\nPamela “Sheena” Tiger: Steve Blake helped and encouraged me to get back into music when I wasn't sure I wanted to. The encouragement has meant more than I can say. I used to play drums in punk bands in the Syracuse scene way back when, and also on the Outer Banks of NC, but didn't play for a very long time after that. The Syracuse scene had a reunion of all the original bands there, from way back, in which my first band (Distortion) participated. That was 2014. I got an electronic kit from Union Music, so I could play in my apartment, and then I met Amber Tortorelli at Savers, we got talking, and she hooked me into something very cool, and then between her and Steve, I started playing (and recording!) again.\n\nGiuliano D'Orazio: Would have to say Cliff Goodwin is one of my top influences as far as Worcester musicians, for several reasons. His playing, of course, is so tasteful and rooted deeply in the rock 'n' roll tradition. The way he commands the tone of his instrument is masterful, and he sounds great in a small club or on a big stage. He’s multifaceted and knows a lot about every aspect of the business, from performing, songwriting, entertaining, production, and management. I continue to aspire to be that well-rounded. He’s got great stories from his days touring with Joe Cocker and others. On top of it all, he’s a great guy, and despite an illustrious career rubbing elbows with legends, he remains humble and funny, and respects his Worcester roots. I learned a lot from him, alongside his bandmates Deric Dyer and Mitch Chakour, when, a few years back, they gave me multiple opening spots for their Joe Cocker tribute shows.\n\nMike Marz of the Deadites: The Curtain Society &mldr; HUCK &mldr; Not only were they world-class songwriters and performers, Roger Lavallee, Ron Mominee, Scott Ricciuti and Paul Dagnello were also “ locker room leaders” who were generous with their time and energy. If I can be a quarter of the influence they were on me to anyone else I’ll have succeeded in my artistic endeavors.\n\nJohanna Hampton-Dance aka Ladii Girl: If I had to choose Worcester artists that have influenced me, I would have to give it to 3 artists in particular. I would start with Abbie Cotto. His music is heartfelt and full of passion. He and I got into the business professionally on the same day and same venue and have watched each other evolve over the years. Jordan Richarsdon is a master writer with a full on vocal range, including runs that would stand up against any industry artist past or present. Last but not least I have to say Elion Virtuoso, just like Jordan he is a musical master mind, while composing lyrical content is also able to produce beats, and live instrumentation, highlighting the true capacity of his talents. Although they are all younger than myself, I admire the work, talent, and dedication they all put forth and believe it or not, they keep me in the loop of what the current sounds are, due to my music being a bit more mature and my demographic being that crowd, I look to them to help my sound transcend across age barriers.\n\nMike Gianfriddo: Doug Hartwell took me under his wing when I was 13 years old. He taught me bar chords and some scales and got me playing the stuff I wanted to play! He would let me play his brand new black Stratocaster and also had our very inexperienced band play some shows with his band. Then Joe D'Angelo when I was late teens. Love both of these guys! I literally would not be doing what I am today or any of my past years if it wasn’t for them. Two great players and two great guys! I’m very blessed to be put on the path I was put on. If it wasn’t for Doug and Joe teaching me and also learning patience from them is probably the reason I got to tour our beautiful world and play for our troops! I hope they both realize the impact they had and still have on me and my playing.\n\nJames Keyes: Chris Cah! Chris was putting together shows and helping get the Wormtown Wednesdays going way back in 2001ish. He was the guy who introduced to me to Alex and Lysie from The Numbskulls. All of them taught me about the DIY punk rock community work ethic. It’s only a scene if everyone is participating and man, Wormtown was thrumming with energy in a large part due to Chris’ efforts and selflessness.\n\nSteve Blake: Bret Harold Hart and Pete Zolli taught me songwriting, stage craft and to be fearless. Bob Jordan taught me to always trust your internal creative compass and ignore conventional thought.\n\nCheryle Crane: Cathy Cah, hands down, for all the obvious reasons. Blue Moon Band, Creatures of Habit, Musclecah ... The incredible skill & talent on the bass, her powerful vocals, her songwriting, her overall image ... I admired her hugely (& still do). I did my best attempt to copy/model myself after her but never came close. I ultimately found my own style within myself. She was the catalyst that ignited the fire within me. She remains a part of Wormtown Royalty. She's the queen of the bass!\n\nLance Muhammad: That's an easy one for me. I would say the Worcester musician who has influenced me the most is Bret Talbert. I think that I've learned from him that you can really improve with songwriting. I've worked with him since the '90s and have learned a lot about songwriting, playing live, etc. For me he is one of the best songwriters in the Worcester area.\n\nBob Moon: Brett Brumby. I met him about 12 years ago when he was hosting the open mic at Route 56 Bar & Grill. I was basically a lead guitar player who also sang and played acoustic, but I had never really done that professionally as a solo act. He gave me a feature at the open mic. His professionalism, his kindness, and his talent have been a great influence for me over the years. If there is a template for being a professional musician in the Worcester area there is none better than Brett Brumby.\n\nBob Jordan: Peter Abbott for showing me where the stage was and how to behave on it; I never took a guitar lesson but teenage me watching teenage Joe D'Angelo play guitar pretty much sealed the deal for me.\n\nMarty Luttrell: The J. Geils Band, while technically not a Worcester band, the members except Peter Wolf started playing at WPI. When I was a 19-year-old becoming proficient on the harmonica, the band (and other Chicago blues artists) got me into playing that style of blues harp.\n\nPaul J. Vigeant Jr.: The Curtain Society played my first club show (Stereolab) and I have been a fan ever since. Through TCS, I discovered bands like Puddle, Black Rose Garden, and An April March.\n\nJohn Gryffon: Bill MacMillan's band Biohazard (not the NYHC band which came later) which used to do a wicked version of Naked Raygun's Managua back at the QVCC circa 1988. He would be jumping around, gave himself a bloody nose one time. Stole a few tricks from him when I became a vocalist\n\nJon Bonner: Fernando Perez totally changed the way I played guitar and sang. He had a very rhythmic influence on me. Peter Zarkadas and Sarah Levecque used to blow me away back in the day (and they still do). Veterans like Duncan Arsenault, James Keyes and Keri Anderson (and all the great musicians they've played with) have inspired and continue to inspire me. Worcester's musical community overall is as lively and inspiring as ever, and I'm proud to be a part of it.\n\nDanny Fantom: Epiñero aka Egbert Piñero, he used to run the studio down at the Worcester Youth Center and gave myself and my group The Grand Arkanum (Eric Gomez, Andre Gomez and Sean Brooks aka Leon Legacy) a bunch of recording tips and help over the years. He even helped write songs for us and invited us to his house to work on music and make beats for us. He always pursued a positive message and showed us nothing but love over the years. I recorded the entirety of my second solo album at his house as well. A real stand-up guy and amazing artist.\n\nDoug Geer: Bob Peters and Cathy Cah from the Blue Moon Band welcomed a generation of teenage upstart punk bands on the Wormtown scene and treated us as equals. They were beyond pros onstage and off. Bob is, to this day, one of the most original guitarists I’ve ever heard. And Cathy is simply a mother-effing rock star. Also have to mention the importance of WCUW DJ’s including Wormtown Minister of Culture himself Mr. Brian Goslow for the airplay, the inspiration and organization of the scene. You can’t have an article about Worcester’s music scene without a nod to Brian’s influence.\n\nBret Talbert: The first club band I was in, Public Works, was getting influenced by early Dave Bellenoit/Rob Ledoux bands like The Kids & Hip Civilians! Even before them a band called Three Believers really helped and inspired us — guitarist Paul Ferrin especially! Childhood & Pale Nephews inspired us too. I’m not great with all the names but Scott Ricciuti, all the guitars in Childhood — Greg Passler! & the Lyman brothers: great guitar & frontman singing/showmanship!\n\nRich Lorion of the Pathetics: I have to add Dave Kowalcyzk to this list, one the first Worcester gig the Pathetics ever played was a Halloween party in the basement of Dave's marina with the Free Radicals. He wasn't an artist per se, but a huge influence in the local music scene for me was John O'Neill, there were so many Tuesday nights spent drinking and talking music at Dinny's with Bob Peters, Scott Ricciuti, Steve Aquino and so many others and he always put us on the bills we had no business being on. Really miss that guy.\n\nCara Brindisi: Every woman from the Women of Worcester days have inspired me in the past and continue to inspire me. Those few years had a great influence on me and taught me so much about the power of our voices coming together.\n\nJoe Montville: Four Year Strong and Jafet Muzic. Four Year Strong taught me how to have a good time at a local show and Jafet's lyrics and talent inspire me to keep pushing and trying to work on myself and my artistry.\n\nP.E. James: Both Mac Cole (late host of the Folk 'n A group) and Dana Lewis were huge influences on me — not as much musically, but in their attitudes toward music and making others happy with the gift I was given. Mentors and menches both. Geez, and Chuck Demers and Mud, who dragged me onto a stage before they knew who I was, and just as important, before I knew who they were!\n\nRich \"Amazing Dick\" Leufstedt: Bob Jordan was influential through his fearlessness to play any song in any style on any instrument and make it his own. And boy could he write a great song. Another was the founder of the Folk ’n A, Mike Duffy. Mike was very accepting to me as a new performer and allowed me to cover his songs.\n\nStan Matthews: The musical talent in the Worcester is vast encompassing all styles. But I would have to say that a major influence for me is Ric Porter. I first saw him in Preston Porter at WPI back in the early '80s. Many years later, much to my surprise, he showed up to hear me at Beatnik's. With guitar in hand, he sat in with me all night. We played his songs, my songs and some old country standards. After the gig, a patron asked how long had we been playing together and how tight we sounded. I told the man that I had just met him 3 hours ago. And such is the magic of Ric Porter, that he can elevate you and your music to heights not dreamed of.\n\nStephen Bourassa: When Susan and I moved to Worcester a bunch of years ago, I was taken aback at the support of and by the music community &mldr; of the many musicians, it’s as much about the people that they are as it is about their musicianship&mldr; I got to know a few fantastic people by starting the Worcester Jazz Festival, namely Dale Lepage (who would be a huge reason why we moved out here and started it after having him perform at our Newton festival.). I would call him “Mr. Community” as he’s busted his butt and made himself available for so many different causes and programs benefiting the City of Woo; started a Songwriters Night at Franks and got to know Donald Prange and Rich Leufstedt, to me those two are a pair. When the smoke clears they are two of the most genuine people, with Don having a true folkies soul and Rich being someone that just goes for it, no matter. Sean Ryder, an extremely intelligent self-tortured soul who is ready and willing while juggling three different lives at one time and a great songwriter, to boot."
