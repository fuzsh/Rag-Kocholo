        "text": "The Value of Educational Travel\n\nWe travel to wake up. Life is swift and hazy. We are habitual creatures, following mildly comfortable ruts. As Miguel de Unamuno said, “To fall into a habit is to cease to be.” The great religions (not by mere word-flinging is Buddha called The Awakened One), the poets, the philosophers, the guy at the corner store (if he stops to think of about it), tell us that we live most of our lives in a mist. Travel, like the best friend you’ll ever have, gives you a little slap, Wake up! Wake up! Be!\n\nWe travel because it’s the highest form of re-creation. That’s a quote from our pal Seamus O’Banion. Whaton earth did you mean by that, Seamus? I meant that every time we step out of our life’s routine we have the chance to recreate ourselves anew. To decide whowe are, what we like, what we can’t stand, what we crave, what brings us joy, what repels and attracts us. We always have this fundamental chance, but we don’t usually grasp it. The good traveler, as opposed to the traveler who’s just getting carted around, learns that this old personality is marvelously flexible, fantastically adaptable, and far more capacious than he or she ever thought. That we always have the power to choose who we are, to re-create ourselves as we see fit.\n\nWe travel because we’re natural-born sensualists. Sure, we’re smack dab in a miraculously rich sensory environment without even leaving home. The local franchise coffee dispensary, if we stop fidgeting long enough to let it flow in, is a teeming universe of sense\n\ndelights. Problem is, we don’t usually notice through the habit-mist. But we do notice this incredible, unceasing sense-flood when we travel. Sights, sounds, and probably the least honored (because it’s so seemingly vestigial), smell. Sunrise in the Himalaya. The souks of Istanbul. The sound of wild horses galloping across the plains of Patagonia. Dinner in Tuscany. There is no end to it.\n\nWe travel, as Chesterton said, not to set foot on foreign land. [But to] set foot on one’s own country as foreign land. That is, we travel to understand our normal life and land better. To appreciate them more, to mine them for their joy and, yes, their unending exoticism. To look beyond what someone recently called the narcissism of the unspoiled place, which contains within it the dull, life-shunning notion that the very place we live is spoiled somehow. Proust said it, too: “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new landscapes, but in having new eyes.” Travel gives us new eyes. It makes the same old brand new.\n\nWe travel because we’re human. One main factor in the upward trend of animal life, Alfred North Whitehead wrote, has been the power of wandering. Most of us, whether we know it or not, whether we do it or not, want to find out what’s behind that homey hill. As Theo Cruz once said, “If humans weren’t travelers, the Olduvai Gorge would be pretty crowded these days.”\n\nWe travel because it’s an act of good citizenship, local and global. You know, as a traveler, that when you read a news report about a place you’ve been, that it comes alive in an important way. Your letters to the editor have weight, your opinions are more grounded. Your concerns are more tangible. The life of the sweet little boy who grabbed your index finger and led you around Angkor is no longer an abstraction. And you’re no longer an abstraction to him, or to the wealth of people you meet and dally and bargain and share train compartments and jeeps and scenery and meals and pictures of your and their kids with. You don’t have horns and a forked tail. They aren’t necessarily mad at you just because you have a blue passport. Travel fosters understanding, and we need understanding now… more than ever.\n\nWe travel because people everywhere are wonderful. Always? Of course not. God knows we know that. But ask the alert traveler, and she will tell you: as a species, humans are worth the effort of getting to know. We send out trip questionnaires to all our clients, and our experience is this: they rave about the scenery and the food and the accommodations (usually) but they have a special place in their hearts for the people. The cab driver in Cairo who grandly, quietly refused payment. That student in Kashgar who took you home to meet the folks. The old fellow you played chess with in Tehran. The ladies in a Yemeni mountain village who fed you dates and gossiped about men and painted your feet in the local style. The rough truck driver who cradled you like a baby when you had food poisoning in Shigatse. The forbidding-looking Pathan man in Peshawar (yes, Peshawar) who suddenly smiled and said, “Welcome to my country, dear sir.” Again and again, it’s the human encounters we remember, that are balm to our souls. If travel teaches us nothing else, it teaches us that humans are lovely creatures.\n\nAnd we travel because, as an old zen koan has it, the whole world is medicine. Medicine freely offered, medicine we need and have a right to. Medicine that cures us of alienation and the bondage of self-obsession. Medicine that helps us become whole and vibrant, and allows us to see the whole and vibrant world.\n\nETC 2011 Emeritus Council\n\nKaren Anthony\n\nRetired Director of Alumni Travel\n\nUNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME ALUMNI ASSOC.\n\nMargaret Carnright\n\nAssistant Director for Education\n\nASSOCIATION OF YALE ALUMNI\n\nMichael Chang\n\nInstructor\n\nNEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCMP\n\nDiana Lee Crew\n\nFounder and Consultant\n\nREAL WORLD CONNECTIONS\n\nRobert Fure\n\nDirector of Special Programs\n\nWASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY\n\nMaria Gross\n\nConsultant – Travel Sales and Marketing\n\nAmy Kotkin\n\nDirector\n\nSMITHSONIAN JOURNEYS\n\nFrank LaFleche\n\nMarket Development – Canada\n\nJORDAN TOURISM BOARD\n\nSusan Lethbridge\n\nDirector, Business Development\n\nVOYAGES TO ANTIQUITY\n\nJames Moses\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nROAD SCHOLAR\n\nTodd Nielsen\n\nTravel Director\n\nARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA TOURS – EOS\n\nKerstin Nordin\n\nMarketing North America\n\nICELAND TRAVEL\n\nDennis Pinto\n\nManaging Director\n\nMICATO SAFARIS\n\nJames Sano\n\nPresident\n\nGEOGRAPHIC EXPEDITIONS\n\nCarolyn Sheaff\n\nRetired Director of the BEAR TREKS Travel Program\n\nCalifornia Alumni Association\n\nJoseph Small\n\nPresident\n\nAHI TRAVEL\n\nAlicia Stevens\n\nDirector of Global Programs\n\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL OF THE ARTS\n\nPeter Voll\n\nOwner\n\nPETER VOLL ASSOCIATES (PVA)\n\nScott Williams\n\nSenior Director, Alumni Travel Program\n\nUniversity of Illinois Alumni As\n\nA Look Back at ETC’s Conference Themes\n\n1987-1991 • NonProfits in Travel: Issues, Concerns and Opportunities in Alumni and Museum Study Travel\n\n1992 • NonProfits in Travel: Issues, Concerns and Opportunities in Alumni, Museum, Continuing Education, and Other NonProfit Special Interest and Educational Travel\n\n1993 • Operating NonProfit Travel Programs as a Successful Business: Not-for-profit travel doesn’t mean no bottom line!\n\n1995 • Competing in a Maturing Marketplace: Extinction or Distinction in Nonprofit Travel\n\n1996 • Pricing and Marketability of Nonprofit Travel: Aligning Your Programs to a Changing Marketplace\n\n1997 • Breaking the Ice – Moving Beyond Current Marketing & Programming Plateaus in Nonprofit Travel\n\n1998 • Shaping Your Travel Program’s Future: Targeting Tomorrow’s Travelers Today\n\n1999 • What Do Your Travelers Really Value?\n\n2000 • Educational Travel – Keeping It New!\n\n2001 • Building Global Partnerships: Strengthening Relationships, Advancing Programs\n\n2002 • The Learning Traveler: Exploring, Engaging, Evolving\n\n2003 • Travel On Purpose: New Motives, Missions, Markets\n\n2004 • Success in Tough Times: Marketing Through Adversity\n\n2005 • Getting Your Message Out: Powerful Marketing, Purposeful Programs\n\n2006 • 20th Anniversary: Inspirational Performances\n\n2007 • Bridging for the Future: New & Creative Strategies\n\n2008 • Facilitating Transformational Journeys: New Perspectives\n\n2009 • Engaging Travelers in Challenging Times: Proactive Strategies in a Downturn Economy\n\n2010 • Consider the Possibilities: Charting a New Course for Affinity and Nonprofit Travel\n\nETC’s 25-Year Evolution\n\n1986 (December)\n\nMara DelliPriscoli incorporates Travel Leisure Consultants (TLC), in Washington, D.C.\n\n1987\n\nFirst Nonprofits in Travel Conference (NPTC) convenes in March at the Wyndham Bristol Hotel, Washington, D.C.\n\n1.5-day conference with optional pre-conference half day “how to’s” workshop and one track of plenary sessions focusing on Insurance, Legal, Postal, Promotion, Best Program Models, Domestic Travel sessions\n\nThe Advisory Committee is formed with 10 professionals\n\n1988\n\nConference grows to 2 days and offers affinity breakout sessions, as well as a post-conference half-day optional tour to the Smithsonian\n\nThe opening plenary is titled “Travel in Turbulent Times”\n\n1989\n\nConference holds its first official embassy-sponsored venues at the Indonesian Embassy (hosted by NATRABU and Garuda Airlines)\n\nThe first destination briefing is held on the Netherlands (hosted by Netherlands Board of Tourism and KLM Airlines)\n\nTour Operators/Vendors are excluded from conference sessions but are invited to a small networking party\n\nThe precursor to the official Jumpstart Seminar is launched as a full day pre-conference program focusing on the nuts and bolts of nonprofit travel\n\nFirst Travel Supplier Resource Directory is published\n\nThe Conference receives institutional endorsements over the course of eight years to help it get established.

Mara DelliPriscoli by Sherry Schwarz\n\nLike any intrepid explorer, Mara DelliPriscoli has gone the distance to learn the contours of uncharted territory. From a year abroad traversing the ruins of Ancient Greece to a three-year hiatus blue-water sailing from the Caribbean to South America to finding a home on the range in western Montana—to visiting some 50-plus countries in between—she has traveled a long and winding path filled with adventure, risk, adversity, and reward to bring to life and evolve the Educational Travel Conference and mark its place on the modern map.\n\nWhen asked what spurred her interest in educational travel, she reflects: “It was my freshman study abroad year ….and the experiential focus on learning….arriving at Delphi for the first time at dawn….. reading Herodotus sitting in the Acropolis …and being ‘transported’ into the living context of the past.”\n\nHaving worked in almost every sector of the travel industry, Mara’s advocacy for lifelong learning fortunately directed her to lay the foundation of the Educational Travel Conference. As she authored in a 2007 Transitions Abroad article: “My treks to Delphi have remained a compass point for many subsequent solo expeditions, as well as for professional planning of learning travel programs worldwide. Throughout the years I have seen the design of educational tours continue to evolve as travelers seek more authentic and transformative programs that offer both collaborative educational exchange and the freedom to pursue those spontaneous moments of solo discovery, which uniquely personalize travel. As we move toward new paradigms of what defines the educational travel experience from education that engages the mind to learning connections that engage the soul—facilitated lifelong learning through travel will eclipse the traditional model of managed group travel.”\n\nThat adventurous and spirited passion for travel has never left Mara and characterizes her today, as she admits to being the “eternal rolling stone.” She’ll hop on a plane, train, or horse anywhere, having traveled in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Azerbaijan, China, Outer Mongolia, northern India, Dubai, and Mexico in only the span of the last 15 months largely for business and forging ETC connections. Fittingly, it was island hopping in the British Virgin Islands when Mara made the commitment to launch TLC into reality—at that time called Travel Learning Consulting.\n\nHer vision of orchestrating a professional development venue for nonprofit travel planners to network, collaborate, and share best practices had long been percolating in her mind. “Having worked too many a trade show from the supplier side, far removed from the educational content of the meeting, I recognized the lack of professional development and training workshops for all involved with nonprofit travel, particularly the travel planners,” says Mara.\n\nShe was convinced that “there had to be a better way” to support the growth and diversity of nonprofit travel as well as promote “sustainable” nonprofit and forprofit partnerships.\n\nHaving bounced around the concept of Nonprofits in Travel for many a year with colleagues Diana Lee Crew (then directing the Denver Museum of Natural History’s travel program) and Bryan DeLeo (then directing the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s travel program), Mara took the plunge in 1987 and launched—with a six-week lead time only—the first Nonprofits in Travel Conference (NPTC) with a brochure and program in tandem with Diana Lee Crew. Mara remembers the decisions and trade-offs requisite to this bold move noting, “I just knew without hesitation that NPTC was an idea whose time had come. So I ignored every marketing principle about measured lead time in promotions, invested all my limited resources and just went for it!”\n\nAt that point in time the Conference was a “test” run—without a long-term business plan running on sheer determination and passion for a vision unfolding. In 1987, after the first NPTC conference, Mara set sail for the Caribbean— and what she thought would be a temporary hop from Bermuda to the British Virgin Islands. Her “hop” lasted three years. Between thousands of miles sailing and diving, brushes with Venezuelan pirates and uprisings, she focused on enhancing and expanding the Nonprofits in Travel Conference from the s/v Mandorla.\n\nIn the first eight years, Mara convened the first Advisory Council of which Diana Lee Crew was a founding council member, and received endorsements from leading nonprofit institutions: the Denver Museum of Natural History, California Alumni Association, Witte Museum, the Alumni Association of the University of Michigan Alumni, and the Sierra Club. Since these early days, the ETC has evolved to a six-person core team with more than 20 on-site Conference staff, from a 35-person meeting to an international Conference with an audience of 450-plus attendees from over 40 countries, and an ever-growing member constituency in the online community.\n\n“ETC is an extraordinary professional development network,” says Diana Lee Crew. “The fact that the group was founded over 25 years ago and has grown from a simple networking and sharing conference for some 30 nonprofit travel programs to the huge network it is today is an accomplishment worth noting.”\n\nWhereas the constituency focus in the first years of the Conference was exclusively on museums, Mara’s vision was to cultivate the cross-fertilization of ideas across all nonprofit sectors diversifying the attendee base to include alumni associations, continuing education programs, conservation groups, and environmental organizations. With a strategic focus on building a strong and viable nonprofit constituency in the first three years, Mara moved forward to include the other half of the nonprofit travel partnership: tour operators, and then expanding to destinations and travel suppliers in the early ’90s. This strategy included expanding a then one-track travel-planner-only educational conference to a vertically rich and multi-layered offering of concurrent conference sessions to\n\nappeal to all individuals within the educational travel market, including the for-profit constituency. Sponsoring partners contributed greatly to an economically viable expansion of educational programming, social venues, and Conference-related online services.\n\nAs the Conference continued to grow in size and scope, the Executive Advisory Council expanded to reflect the growing diversity in Conference attendees. Council members were selected on the basis of their expertise in the field of educational and special-interest affinity and alumni/member travel, as well as the industry sector they represent: travel planner, tour operator, tour supplier, destination. An Emeritus Advisory Council was founded in 2004 by former Advisory Council members wishing to remain active and engaged in the ongoing activities of the ETC.\n\nPushing the technology curve, Mara launched the first online registration for the ETC in 1999, and placed on the agenda, as early as 1995, strong online marketing courses and the first all-day Technology Forum, which was “cutting edge but sparsely attended,” adds Mara with a laugh.\n\nAlmost from the outset, Mara envisioned the ETC’s activities beyond an annual Conference as a year-round resource and networking forum. As early as 1992, she laid plans for “The Nonprofits in Travel Coalition Resource Room,” which was the precursor for her desire to evolve an online ETC community. The first Networking Database was launched in the late ’90’s and, now, many versions later, it serves as the basis for today’s ETC member website’s search capabilities, which include Organizational Searches, Member Searches, and Destination Reports. It was due to the direct and sustained support of the website’s sponsoring partners that three phases of the current ETC website were able to launch successfully over the past five years. Today the ETC website includes not only its robust search capabilities, but also many tools and resources that Mara has innovated from the personalized “task manager” providing each member with customized reminders and timely information to the recently launched Member Profiles, which are designed to facilitate community-building and networking.\n\nETC’s website is also an extension of the annual Conference, insofar as it enables members to now listen to digital recordings of the majority of Conference sessions and to access speaker handouts year-round. This evolution has been particularly gratifying for Mara, who, from the outset, aimed to supply Conference content and collateral that could be accessed 24/7 by virtual members.\n\nEvery year since its inception, the Conference has focused not only on the issues, concerns and opportunities in nonprofit travel but also on the broader trends and strategic issues of the travel industry, recruiting top marketing and trends speakers, as well as educational travel industry leaders from within the community and candid discourses with industry partners.\n\n“The Conference has never been cookie cutter,” says Mara. “Each year the ETC delivers on the basic how to’s but also brings to the forefront the ever-evolving challenges of staying relevant and creating program distinctions in affinity and alumni travel. Re-thinking travel programs for a rapidly evolving traveler, moving into the digital age of marketing and social networking, strengthening partner relationships are all critical to the growth, leadership, and evolution of nonprofit travel programs.”\n\nIn addition to advancing education and professional development, the ETC has also prided itself on its outreach and advocacy over the years. Mara cites the launch of the ETC “Educationals,” in 1990, as a program of which she is particularly proud. The “Educationals” enable experienced travel planners to share their programming expertise with countries furthering the development of educational travel.\n\nThe ETC has also made important strides through presentations on tourism as a passport to peace and with the formation, in 1991, of the Nonprofit UBIT tax coalition. Included in its many “firsts,” the ETC hosted the first Voluntourism Forums and served as the first platform for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to launch co-promotional activities in the U.S. travel industry.\n\nIf materializing a vision teaches us anything, humility is among the first of lessons—and it’s one Mara knows well. Even as the founder and president of the ETC, she is the first to tell you her part of the ETC story is but only one small piece. “It is witnessing a community evolving and the commitment of colleagues to raise the bar of professionalism in their industry that inspires and renews my commitment to ETC annually,” says Mara.\n\nShe adds: “It is the countless core of volunteer colleagues— participants in the Regional Roundtables…colleagues ‘giving back’ by teaching Jumpstart for the past 22 years…veteran ETC members leading the Executive Forum… delegates developing and leading sessions annually at the ETC… valued sponsors helping to deliver a quality educational platform, fun networking venues, and a growing online communications platform… the strategic counseling of the Executive Advisory and Emeritus Council members, and so many others—who have all tirelessly and heartfully contributed to the face of ETC today.” These are the leaders who Mara believes will set the pace for the next 25 years.\n\nAs Mara closes her reflection on the eve of the 25th Anniversary Conference, she is already looking toward the horizon for the next need to be served, the next challenge. When asked what’s ahead on the ETC agenda, Mara doesn’t hesitate: “aggregating industry statistics on the affinity and alumni travel market,” she says passionately. “The growth and development of a community with a leading industry voice is critical,” she says. “I expect that the resulting aggregated data will become an essential resource for researching, benchmarking, and advocacy in years to come.”\n\nHats Off to ETC for 25 Years of Building the Conference and the Community\n\nCongratulations on the 25th anniversary of the Educational Travel Conference! The Tucson Museum of Art derived many benefits from its ETC membership and association with other nonprofit organizations. Exchanging ideas has been one of the motivating reasons to return to the conference year after year. Mara’s inspiration in developing Travel Learning Connections has been an incalculable benefit to all of the members of the Educational Travel Community.\n\nJoyce Barkley\n\nRetired Travel Planner, Tucson Museum of Art\n\nThe Educational Travel Community is an extraordinary professional development network. The fact that the ETC was founded over 25 years ago and has grown from a simple networking and sharing conference for some 30 nonprofit travel programs to the huge network it is today is an accomplishment worth noting. Today our world includes all aspects of travel from suppliers to ministry of tourism departments to risk managers to inbound operators and, of course, the nonprofit travel programs themselves. Each year, this conference provides basic information for newcomers, while challenging and encouraging other programs to look at new directions and to craft innovative educational experiences we might never have imagined before. We are not merely visiting countries, but we are helping to define unique worlds. The learning that occurs here also spills over into many other avenues of our personal lives and enriches us all.\n\nDiana Lee Crew\n\nFounder & Consultant, Real World Connections\n\nHaving attended the Educational Travel Conference for most of my 17 years as a travel planner, I can honestly say that the Philadelphia Zoo’s travel program has grown and continues to function because of the knowledge I’ve gained through the outstanding program the ETC offers each year. It is a wonderful way for me to network with fellow Natural History Museum, Aquarium, Conservation Organization, and Zoo (NACZ) planners, as we all share and learn from each other and become friends at the same time. The ETC is the only professional development conference where I can find everything I need in one place. I discover what destinations are “hot” and “what’s not.” I am able to discuss legal issues and risk management situations, find capable tour operators, and learn how to better market my products. My attendance at the ETC has been critical to the success of the Philadelphia Zoo’s travel program and also for AZAD’s (Association of Zoo and Aquarium Docents) for whom I plan several trips a year. I am credited with initiating the Zoo’s travel partnership program with other institutions, many of whom I have met at ETC, and for starting AZAD’s travel program. I couldn’t have accomplished any of this without attending the ETC. Thank you ETC for all that you have done, not only for me, but also for all the other like-minded colleagues in the world.\n\nRoberta “Bert” DeVries\n\nPhiladelphia Zoo Travel Planner/Trips and\n\nProgram Manager and AZAD Travel Planner\n\nI’ve been very privileged to have been associated with the Educational Travel Conference almost from the very beginning, as one of the first foreign tour operators to attend the Conference along with just a handful of others who ventured in the early days to the DoubleTree Hotel.\n\nAfter attending this Conference for the first time I began to share Mara’s vision of a global community of people who are passionate about promoting affinity and nonprofit educational travel. I have had the opportunity to see it grow and develop into what it is today—a large community spanning the globe of people working for something they passionately believe in.\n\nThe yearly journey to the Conference has always been a place to hear inspirational and informative speakers and to share ideas with like-minded (for the most part) colleagues. I can only hope that the Conference continues to grow and develop in the future as it has in the past.\n\nGood work and congratulations on your first 25 years!\n\nNick Fritz\n\nManaging Director, Protours, The Netherlands\n\nMy position allows me to attend only one conference a year, and I find that the Educational Travel Conference is the most productive way for me to spend my conference time and dollars.\n\nThe ETC gives me the best mix of interacting with colleagues holding positions similar to mine in colleges and universities throughout the country, as well as an excellent opportunity to build relationships with tour operators, both from the United States and the destination countries of our tours. Not only do I learn better ways of doing my job, but I also am never starting from scratch when trying to find the right tour operator for one of my alumni adventures. I enjoy meeting with representatives from various countries to garner ideas of how my trips can be improved and learning about new services available to our travelers.\n\nETC is the only conference that I have ever attended where I am asked for months ahead of time by friends and contacts in the educational travel industry whether or not I am attending the conference. Each year I look forward to seeing my ETC friends again.\n\nAmy Goerwitz\n\nAssoc. Director of Alumni Relations, Carleton College\n\nCongratulations on the Educational Travel Conference’s\n\n25th year!\n\nI feel that the ETC is the only conference in the world for colleagues to share the cutting edge of educational travel in a friendly and collegial atmosphere. Those of us who have been attending for years look forward eagerly to learning about the issues concerning educational travel and about what everyone else is doing. There could not be a better forum to learn and to share innovative ideas about best practices and achieving best results in the field of educational travel. The ETC definitely is one of the most enriching professional development experiences I have had in the travel industry.\n\nMaria M. Gross\n\nConsultant – Travel Sales and Marketing\n\nPromPeru has been privileged to participate in the Educational Travel Conference and to assemble with the top influential travel leaders in North America. Through this opportunity, our country has succeeded in hosting several participants for familiarization trips to view the exotic, experiential, and cultural tourism experiences that continue to provide enlightening growth-occasions for visitors.\n\nWe look forward to the continued growth of the ETC and the expansion of attendees. We are eager to continue our relationship with the ETC and deepen our connection with the educational travel market by “Opening Doors to Open Minds.”\n\nThe ETC is one of our most important events, not only to showcase our product but also to increase our knowledge and enrich ourselves.\n\nElisabeth Hakim\n\nUK & North American Markets Coordinator, PromPeru\n\nI cherish my many years at the Conference (1986-2007). The Educational Travel Conference was crucial to my work in alumni education. It gave me the chance to know virtually everyone in the field and to develop critical relationships with the finest tour operators. I learned so much and it was so much fun. An entire industry owes a tremendous portion of its success over the past 25 years to the Conference in general and, even more, to our beloved Mara, who made it all happen. Kudos to you all and best wishes for the next 25 years!\n\nRalph Janis\n\nDirector Emeritus, Cornell’s Adult University\n\nETC bonds planners, tour operators, suppliers, and destinations into a common pursuit of excellence in educational travel. Over many years, the conference has given all of us both a platform for expressing our various points of view and a venue for discussion. It has been extremely valuable to me personally and for my organization to be part of such an informative, thoughtprovoking, and lively annual gathering.\n\nAmy Kotkin\n\nDirector, Smithsonian Journeys\n\nThe Educational Travel Conference has been truly the “Super Bowl conference” of our industry. This annual affinity event has single handedly marked a time to regroup and reconnect with our colleagues and partners to brainstorm and strategize new marketing and programming ideas.\n\nIt also has been a remarkable place to reinvigorate our passion and commitment to educational travel.\n\nWe all come away from the ETC with a renewed sense of purpose, an extraordinary feat for any one conference!\n\nKaren Kuttner-Capato\n\nVice President of Affinity & Charter Sales, Lindblad Expeditions\n\nAs goes the real estate mantra “location, location, location,” to me the Educational Travel Conference has been and remains “community, community, community.” A community of kindred minds, where we gather to share common ideas, address common challenges, and set common goals for success for all parties, enjoying the journey together on a win-win stage! Thanks to Mara for her vision and leadership!\n\nPhilip Mathews\n\nSenior Associate, MIR Corporation\n\nOn the 25th anniversary, I am honored to have been part of the Educational Travel Conference and Group Travel Community since 1995. My 15-year journey with the Educational Travel Community has been rewarding and provided me with invaluable educational, business, and networking opportunities: first, during my time with the Finnish Tourist Board, and then with my own company dealing with travel to Scandinavian countries.\n\nMara, ETC’s group leader during this journey, has always provided inspiration, encouragement, and new sources of learning experiences. I see the ETC moving along into the future, always strong and staying abreast of new developments.\n\nKerstin E. Nordin\n\nMarketing North America, Iceland Travel\n\nTravel, especially the kind of mindful travel done by nonprofits, is all about people. For a quarter century now, the Educational Travel Conference has been at the forefront of the thoughtful business of educational travel.\n\n[Mara has never been one] to forget the unique importance of [her] calling—to seek out ways to make travel a means to inform, educate, and enlighten both the traveler and the peoples visited. [Ever since] she visited East Africa, Mara has sponsored three siblings through our AmericaShare School Sponsorship program. There is no question that she has saved lives by her dedication and continuing sponsorship. She has literally put the “education” in educational travel by providing schooling for these fortunate Kenyans, and in so doing has embodied the very mission of her own organization.\n\nDennis Pinto\n\nManaging Director, Micato Safaris\n\n“The professional benefits I’ve received from this Conference have been extremely rewarding to my institution, travel program, and me with each friendship to be treasured always.” (Written March 30, 1989.) Going forward, may this remain true!\n\nCarolyn Sheaff\n\nRetired Director, Cal Alumni Association\n\nMy first memories of the Educational Travel Conference are of people. Each year, old friends and new are highlights. Next is educational content, especially some of the really great and inspirational talks. Third is industry accomplishments—the most notable to me being the real partnerships that have evolved among the various segments of the educational travel pipeline thanks to the Conference.\n\nAll in all, my life has been positively impacted both professionally and personally because of the ETC. For this I thank Mara for her vision and conviction, the many hundreds of volunteers who make the Conference so Mara DelliPriscoli and Ray Knapp in Kenya visiting a local community project. great, the sponsors who make the Conference possible, and, most of all, the attendees, without whom there would be no Conference.\n\nAs we move forward through the next 25 years, if we continue to connect people, provide meaningful educational experiences, and stand ready to advocate on behalf of the industry, we will all be able to grab our canes and celebrate the 50th Anniversary.\n\nJoe Small\n\nPresident, AHI TRAVEL\n\nAfter a career working with the National Park Service, I decided to venture into another phase of my life. My close friend, Susan Delgado, who was the Expedition Manager for National Wildlife Federation, suggested I look into attending the Educational Travel Conference. My first attendance was in Washington, D.C., which helped me solidify my decision of developing an environmental education travel company—Environmental Adventure Company. A complete newbie, my eyes and mind were opened to the sheer volume of information available to a novice of education travel. I have no doubt my conference attendance and willingness to ask questions and listen did more for me than stacks of books written on the subject. That was many years, and many conferences, ago. Personally, the value of attending the ETC is beyond measure. I look forward to many more years of interaction with the ETC family.\n\nMichael Sanders\n\nPresident/Founder, Environmental Adventure Company\n\nThe Educational Travel Community is a great organization that spans multiple borders: international, professional, and academic. It has brought me a wealth of information networks, and a sense of belonging to a much larger community. Ten years after being introduced to the ETC, and in a completely new phase of my career, I still find myself leaning on the networks and knowledge delivered over the years. The contacts have been invaluable to me and became building blocks to my present position. Through the ETC I have introduced a personal hero of mine to the Conference (Wade Davis), met some giants of the tourism world, and had conversations with some of the brightest and best our industry has to offer.\n\nThanks ETC for 25 years of hard work, professionalism, and leadership!\n\nPeter Swain, MSC\n\nDistrict Manager, Cypress Hills District, Government of Alberta, Tourism Parks and Recreation\n\nIt is very exciting to be part of the 25th Educational Travel Conference. For two decades, I have had the pleasure of watching this conference grow from a small, planners-only Nonprofits in Travel meeting to what is now an Educational Travel Conference attracting organizations from all corners of the world.\n\nThis Conference provides a neutral meeting ground for all members of the educational travel community whether they are planners, destinations, operators or suppliers. The opportunity is there to expand your client base as well as your knowledge, and there is no better assembly of like-minded individuals and organizations to be found.\n\nThe Conference has been and continues to be the one place where we see an entire group of old friends and meet new ones. We credit it with contributing greatly to our growth and success in our niche travel market.\n\nAttendees always leave with inspiration and an abundance of knowledge gained from speakers as well as their colleagues. The most valuable asset, in my opinion, is the sharing and mentoring that transpires during the sessions. There’s notably far more camaraderie than competition present.\n\nThe Conference helps expand our awareness of responsible tourism and of how we can be an asset to our environment as educated travelers rather than continuing its destruction.\n\nI see the conference as a valuable tool that I hope can continue and grow over the next 25 years.\n\nLinda Witt\n\nDirector, Sales and Client Relations/Educational Travel, USI Travel Insurance Services\n\nThe Vision That Propelled the Educational Travel Community\n\n2011 Interview with J. Mara DelliPriscoli by Sherry Schwarz\n\nLike any intrepid explorer, Mara DelliPriscoli has gone the distance to learn the contours of uncharted territory. From a year abroad traversing the ruins of Ancient Greece to a three-year hiatus blue-water sailing from the Caribbean to South America to finding a home on the range in western Montana—to visiting some 50-plus countries in between—she has traveled a long and winding path filled with adventure, risk, adversity, and reward to bring to life and evolve the Educational Travel Conference and mark its place on the modern map.\n\nWhen asked what spurred her interest in educational travel, she reflects: “It was my freshman study abroad year …and the experiential focus on learning …arriving at Delphi for the first time at dawn …reading Herodotus sitting in the Acropolis …and being ‘transported’ into the living context of the past.”\n\nHaving worked in almost every sector of the travel industry, Mara’s advocacy for lifelong learning fortunately directed her to lay the foundation of the Educational Travel Conference. As she authored in a 2007 Transitions Abroad article: “My treks to Delphi have remained a compass point for many subsequent solo expeditions, as well as for professional planning of learning travel programs worldwide. Throughout the years I have seen the design of educational tours continue to evolve as travelers seek more authentic and transformative programs that offer both collaborative educational exchange and the freedom to pursue those spontaneous moments of solo discovery, which uniquely personalize travel. As we move toward new paradigms of what defines the educational travel experience from education that engages the mind to learning connections that engage the soul—facilitated lifelong learning through travel will eclipse the traditional model of managed group travel.”\n\nThat adventurous and spirited passion for travel has never left Mara and characterizes her today, as she admits to being the “eternal rolling stone.” She’ll hop on a plane, train, or horse anywhere, having traveled in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Azerbaijan, China, Outer Mongolia, northern India, Dubai, and Mexico in only the span of the last 15 months largely for business and forging ETC connections. Fittingly, it was island hopping in the British Virgin Islands when Mara made the commitment to launch TLC into reality—at that time called Travel Learning Consulting.\n\nHer vision of orchestrating a professional development venue for nonprofit travel planners to network, collaborate, and share best practices had long been percolating in her mind. “Having worked too many a trade show from the supplier side, far removed from the educational content of the meeting, I recognized the lack of professional development and training workshops for all involved with nonprofit travel, particularly the travel planners,” says Mara.She was convinced that “there had to be a better way” to support the growth and diversity of nonprofit travel as well as promote “sustainable” nonprofit and for-profit partnerships. Having bounced around the concept of Nonprofits in Travel for many a year with colleagues Diana Lee Crew (then directing the Denver Museum of Natural History’s travel program) and Bryan DeLeo (then directing the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s travel program), Mara took the plunge in 1987 and launched—with a six-week lead time only—the first Nonprofits in Travel Conference (NPTC) with a brochure and program in tandem with Diana Lee Crew. Mara remembers the decisions and trade-offs requisite to this bold move noting, “I just knew without hesitation that NPTC was an idea whose time had come. So I ignored every marketing principle about measured lead time in promotions, invested all my limited resources and just went for it!”\n\nAt that point in time the Conference was a “test” run—without a long-term business plan running on sheer determination and passion for a vision unfolding. In 1987, after the first NPTC conference, Mara set sail for the Caribbean—and what she thought would be a temporary hop from Bermuda to the British Virgin Islands. Her “hop” lasted three years. Between thousands of miles sailing and diving, brushes with Venezuelan pirates and uprisings, she focused on enhancing and expanding the Nonprofits in Travel Conference from the s/v Mandorla.\n\nIn the first eight years, Mara convened the first Advisory Council of which Diana Lee Crew was a founding council member, and received endorsements from leading nonprofit institutions: the Denver Museum of Natural History, California Alumni Association, Witte Museum, the Alumni Association of the University of Michigan Alumni, and the Sierra Club. Since these early days, the ETC has evolved to a six-person core team with more than 20 on-site Conference staff, from a 35-person meeting to an international Conference with an audience of 450-plus attendees from over 40 countries, and an ever-growing member constituency in the online community.\n\n“ETC is an extraordinary professional development network,” says Diana Lee Crew. “The fact that the group was founded over 25 years ago and has grown from a simple networking and sharing conference for some 30 nonprofit travel programs to the huge network it is today is an accomplishment worth noting.”\n\nWhereas the constituency focus in the first years of the Conference was exclusively on museums, Mara’s vision was to cultivate the cross-fertilization of ideas across all nonprofit sectors diversifying the attendee base to include alumni associations, continuing education programs, conservation groups, and environmental organizations. With a strategic focus on building a strong and viable nonprofit constituency in the first three years, Mara moved forward to include the other half of the nonprofit travel partnership: tour operators, and then expanding to destinations and travel suppliers in the early ’90s. This strategy included expanding a then one-track travel-planner-only educational conference to a vertically rich and multi-layered offering of concurrent conference sessions to appeal to all individuals within the educational travel market, including the for-profit constituency. Sponsoring partners contributed greatly to an economically viable expansion of educational programming, social venues, and Conference-related online services.\n\nAs the Conference continued to grow in size and scope, the Executive Advisory Council expanded to reflect the growing diversity in Conference attendees. Council members were selected on the basis of their expertise in the field of educational and special-interest affinity and alumni/member travel, as well as the industry sector they represent: travel planner, tour operator, tour supplier, destination. An Emeritus Advisory Council was founded in 2004 by former Advisory Council members wishing to remain active and engaged in the ongoing activities of the ETC.\n\nPushing the technology curve, Mara launched the first online registration for the ETC in 1999, and placed on the agenda, as early as 1995, strong online marketing courses and the first all-day Technology Forum, which was “cutting edge but sparsely attended,” adds Mara with a laugh.\n\nThe 1998 ETC Executive Advisory Council meeting held at the Riverview B&B, West Dennis, MA. Pictured from left: Jim Moses, President and CEO, Road Scholar, Amy Kotkin, former Director, Smithsonian Journeys (retired), J. Mara DelliPriscoli, Ralph Janis, former Director, Cornell’s Adult University, Joyce Barkley (retired), former Co-Director of Travel, Tucson Art Museum (retired),Jeanne Cobb, former Director of Travel, Ohio State University Alumni Association (deceased), and Carolyn Sheaff, former Director, BEAR TREKS Travel Program, Cal Berkeley Alumni Association (retired).\n\nAlmost from the outset, Mara envisioned the ETC’s activities beyond an annual Conference as a year-round resource and networking forum. As early as 1992, she laid plans for “The Nonprofits in Travel Coalition Resource Room,” which was the precursor for her desire to evolve an online ETC community. The first Networking Database was launched in the late ’90’s and, now, many versions later, it serves as the basis for today’s ETC member website’s search capabilities, which include Organizational Searches, Member Searches, and Destination Reports. It was due to the direct and sustained support of the website’s sponsoring partners that three phases of the current ETC website were able to launch successfully over the past five years. Today the ETC website includes not only its robust search capabilities, but also many tools and resources that Mara has innovated from the personalized “task manager” providing each member with customized reminders and timely information to the recently launched Member Profiles, which are designed to facilitate community-building and networking.\n\nETC’s website is also an extension of the annual Conference, insofar as it enables members to now listen to digital recordings of the majority of Conference sessions and to access speaker handouts year-round. This evolution has been particularly gratifying for Mara, who, from the outset, aimed to supply Conference content and collateral that could be accessed 24/7 by virtual members.\n\nEvery year since its inception, the Conference has focused not only on the issues, concerns and opportunities in nonprofit travel but also on the broader trends and strategic issues of the travel industry, recruiting top marketing and trends speakers, as well as educational travel industry leaders from within the community and candid discourses with industry partners.\n\n“The Conference has never been cookie cutter,” says Mara. “Each year the ETC delivers on the basic how to’s but also brings to the forefront the ever-evolving challenges of staying relevant and creating program distinctions in affinity and alumni travel. Re-thinking travel programs for a rapidly evolving traveler, moving into the digital age of marketing and social networking, strengthening partner relationships are all critical to the growth, leadership, and evolution of nonprofit travel programs.”\n\nIn addition to advancing education and professional development, the ETC has also prided itself on its outreach and advocacy over the years. Mara cites the launch of the ETC “Educationals,” in 1990, as a program of which she is particularly proud. The “Educationals” enable experienced travel planners to share their programming expertise with countries furthering the development of educational travel.\n\nThe ETC has also made important strides through presentations on tourism as a passport to peace and with the formation, in 1991, of the Nonprofit UBIT tax coalition. Included in its many “firsts,” the ETC hosted the first Voluntourism Forums and served as the first platform for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to launch co-promotional activities in the U.S. travel industry.\n\nIf materializing a vision teaches us anything, humility is among the first of lessons—and it’s one Mara knows well. Even as the founder and president of the ETC, she is the first to tell you her part of the ETC story is but only one small piece. “It is witnessing a community evolving and the commitment of colleagues to raise the bar of professionalism in their industry that inspires and renews my commitment to ETC annually,” says Mara.\n\nShe adds: “It is the countless core of volunteer colleagues—participants in the Regional Roundtables…colleagues ‘giving back’ by teaching Jumpstart for the past 22 years…veteran ETC members leading the Executive Forum…delegates developing and leading sessions annually at the ETC…valued sponsors helping to deliver a quality educational platform, fun networking venues, and a growing online communications platform…the strategic counseling of the Executive Advisory and Emeritus Council members, and so many others—who have all tirelessly and heartfully contributed to the face of ETC today.” These are the leaders who Mara believes will set the pace for the next 25 years.\n\nAs Mara closes her reflection on the eve of the 25th Anniversary Conference, she is already looking toward the horizon for the next need to be served, the next challenge. When asked what’s ahead on the ETC agenda, Mara doesn’t hesitate: “aggregating industry statistics on the affinity and alumni travel market,” she says passionately. “The growth and development of a community with a leading industry voice is critical,” she says. “I expect that the resulting aggregated data will become an essential resource for researching, benchmarking, and advocacy in years to come.”"
