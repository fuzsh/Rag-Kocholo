The surname Arsenault was first found in Normandy (French: Normandie), the former Duchy of Normandy, where this ancient family has held a family seat since very early times.

The first record of the name was in 1257 and 1264, and has a connection with the noble name of Von-Locarno. The period of the time when the family name was Arcenium was perhaps the most rewarding period in that during this time and up to July 1657 this family branch was elected to be the Barons Arcenale de Langon of Orleans and Poitou, but this branch became detached from the main stem of the name of Arsenault.

The branch which spelt its name Arzegnio ultimately became Counts, but their history has disappeared into the mists of time. When the family arrived in North America it is thought to have first settled in the Canadian Maritimes in the late 1600's and the name became spelt with the traditional "lt" ending. The name flourished more during this period and until the 20th century, although the name is rarely found in the official records of the early French settlers. However, the name is still found in its original form of Arcegno (pronounced Arsenault) in Switzerland where many noble branches of the family exist.
