        "text": "I never heard about that either. I somehow don't belive it's true.\n\nJust like norwegianne said; I heard that the couple tried to seperate a few times, but always got together again.\n\nI am so sorry I cannot come up with the exact publications I read about it. It was more than once that I read it. Can any one else help me out? It is something I could not forget since it showed her desperation about the situation and her chagrin over the long fight she had to put up until she was accepted.\n\nI have tried to google and see if I can buy a book about her life but I cannot find anything for sale.\n\nI hope someone can come up with the information.\n\nDefinitely. I certainly hope it's just something the press made up at some point because that's really sad if it's true. Do you remember what year it was or how close she came to death?\n\nIt had to be late 1967 or early 1968. She was supposedly visiting friends in France where she went to get away.\n\nMind you at the time of their romance there were always headlines about Harald and Princesses Sofia and Irene.......Wishful thinking on K O and Q F parts since all three had other ideas.........still it must have been hurtful since he always had to accompany someone at official functions while she was in the shadows.\n\nPerhaps something may have been repeated at the time of MM's engagement to compare the roads both of them travelled and why Q S was so much more accepting of MM that the court was of her. Somewhere along the line one of KH sisters wrote a book that was not at all flattering towards KS...........Oh how I hate senior moments....a few years ago I would know exactly where to look for information.......\n\nIn one of the other threads in this forum, Larzen wrote:\n\n\"The King and Queen has admitted they have had their ups and downs in the marriage like most couple but that they work trough it, in the 80/90s they were not living in different parts of the palace as they were living at Skaugum . Se og Hør today in VG retracts the statement that it was Crown Prince Harald who sent his Head Aide de campe to the president of Stortinget to hear about a divorce. Friends of Harald and Sonja says to VG today that divorce never was an issue, but that the public lifestyle put strains on their marriage. There are noithing written about anyone else involved, just the public preassure on them and how they did their work and the rather old fashioned way the Crown Prince was raised. Sonja once said something like he discussed it with himself and then it woul be that way, and that it took some getting used to.\"\n\n\"Per Egil Hegge who is very credible and is writing the auhtorised book on the King which will come out in two weeks or so, to mark his 70th birthday has no comment, the president of Stortinget back then Jo Benkow has no comment, The then Prime Minister Kåre Willoch says he has never heared about any divorce rumours, and the palace spokesperson says the King and Queen does not know if someone talked to the President of Stortinget about a divorce. Accoding to VG the King and Queen was more than suprised when they saw the cover of Se og Hør yesterday.\"\n\nI've never believed the divorce rumors myself, but I think it's easy to imagine Harald and Sonja having problems at certain points given their history and the public life they have to lead. It's easy enough for that sort of information to get out, and I can see false rumors of divorce starting from there. They're obviously really committed to each other--that's why they lasted for nine years before marriage, and that's why divorce would never have been an issue in spite of any problems they might have had.\n\nYou know, I've always been interested in the Norwegian Royals and especially Queen Sonja. I've been reading many stories about them and I never heard about that suicide-rumors. If there were a grain of truth in that would have read about that in any of the many articles. Honestly.\n\nFurtermore I really don't think that goes well with the Queen's personality. Just look at her at engagement videos from that time. To me she looks like quite a tough and strong Lady. Happy, and not like a woman who just tried to commit suicide.\n\nI suppose the engagement has been a done deal already around early 1968. So.. extremely unlikely.\n\nTo me this sounds like a fantastic gossip story written by \"reliable\" sources like Bild or S&H. It's like the story (published by a German gossip mag once) that Sonja wanted to divorce after she had lost her first child. The yellow press just needs such stories from time to time. Just crap.\n\nWell, honestly. I read many stories about them, but I don't belive in this at all.\n\nThe divorcing rumors came up in the early 90s.\n\nAccording to some source (I have no idea who it was... I think this guy who wrote the Harald biography) the Crown Prince asked the Parliament what would happen if his parents divorced. Well, according to this guy the couple went to a marriage-therapie or something and now they are happier then ever... blabla.\n\nLike Larzen I don't know if I should belive that. ... however, I don't really care as they are still married nowadays.\n\nI am so sorry I cannot come up with the exact publications I read about it. It was more than once that I read it. Can any one else help me out? It is something I could not forget since it showed her desperation about the situation and her chagrin over the long fight she had to put up until she was accepted.\n\nI have tried to google and see if I can buy a book about her life but I cannot find anything for sale.\n\nI hope someone can come up with the information.\n\nI've read it too in the French magazine \"Point de vue\" a few years ago . I don't know if it's true but I still have this article .\n\nit is sad for me that princess irene of greece has missed this oportunity to become queen of norway even though she was 100% royal to a woman who has 'nt has a drop of royal blood in her in my view i think harald hould apologise to irene of greece because he was suppose to marry her instead of sonja now he and sonja are hamily marry and irene living by herself with her sister her majesty the queen of spain\n\nNow come on.. Irene didn't miss the opurtunity to get Queen of Norway, because Harald never had the intention to marry her.\n\nKing Olav wanted his son to marry Irene of Greece, but Harald didn't.. as he was in a relationship with Sonja already.\n\nSo why should he have married a (how you call it) 100% Royal woman if he didn't love her?\n\nComplete nonsense.\n\nNow come on.. Irene didn't miss the opurtunity to get Queen of Norway, because Harald never had the intention to marry her.\n\nKing Olav wanted his son to marry Irene of Greece, but Harald didn't.. as he was in a relationship with Sonja already.\n\nSo why should he have married a (how you call it) 100% Royal woman if he didn't love her?\n\nComplete nonsense.\n\nNot only his father wanted the marriage so did queen frederica and and mostly european royalty expected harald to choose a princess and irene was the best candidate since benedikte had went on marrying a german prince.i believe if irene were to marry harald he would have been popular as much as he father was and the house of norway would have been a good model family to the norwegianne people. In my view she is the rightfull queen consort of norway\n\nNot only his father wanted the marriage so did queen frederica and and mostly european royalty expected harald to choose a princess and irene was the best candidate since benedikte had went on marrying a german prince.i believe if irene were to marry harald he would have been popular as much as he father was and the house of norway would have been a good model family to the norwegianne people. In my view she is the rightfull queen consort of norway\n\nWell, Sonja is now the Queen of Norway, liked by the Norwegian people and that all that matters . One will never know if Irene would have been a so much \"better\" queen than Sonja . And, yes, I'm happy for Harald being married with the woman he loves . What would have been that, Harald and Irene ?????? (Nothing against Irene though .)\n\nQueen sonja and King Harald , had to wait such a long time to get married ,\n\nafter so many years not being able to marry , how where they able to change the mind of the King ???? and why was he so against it in the first places??\n\nSheer determination is all that I can say. Besides, I personally believe that Queen Sonja is a shining example of a true royal consort. She has (as far as I know) played this royal with unequal grace and dignity and I admire her for that. Crown Princess Mette-Marit has a helluva example in her mother-in-law and in order for her to contiune to restore class and dignity to the shaky Norwegian monarchy, she'd better take note!!"
