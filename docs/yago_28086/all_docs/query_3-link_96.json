        "text": "You probably know a lot about the British royal family, and you might have even heard about Sweden's sexy monarchs, but how much do you know about the Norwegian royal family? Well, listen up, because they're awesome.\n\n1) When King Harald risked it all for romance.\n\nThe head of the Norwegian royal family is King Harald V, 80, who ascended the throne in 1991, and his wife, Queen Sonja, 79. Their marriage in 1968 caused controversy because Sonja, the daughter of a clothing merchant, was a commoner. According to the official House of Norway website, Sonja had a degree in dressmaking and tailoring and dated Harald in secret for nine years before they were given permission to marry. Apparently, Harald told his father, King Olav V, that if he couldn't marry Sonja he would never marry at all, leaving their line without an heir.\n\nQueen Sonja and King Harald V in 2016\n\nThe then-engaged couple in 1968\n\n2) When the Crown Prince followed in his father's footsteps.\n\nKing Harald's only son and heir to the throne is Prince Haakon, 43. He's also a looker, but sadly, he's taken. Just like his father, Haakon married a commoner, Mette-Marit Tjessem HÃ¸iby, in 2001. Many believed Mette-Marit was unsuitable for the throne because she was a single mother and college dropout, and the father of her son, Marius Borg HÃ¸iby, had been convicted for drug possession. But, just like his father, Haakon loved her and married her anyway. Did I mention that he met her in 1996 at the largest rock festival in Norway?\n\nPrince Haakon and Mette-Marit Tjessem HÃ¸iby on their wedding day: August 25, 2001\n\n3) When King Harald delivered this slow burn.\n\nYou can tell these two are still totally in love as they affectionately tease each other after almost fifty years of marriage. This moment they shared on TV is particularly good (watch it here).\n\n4) When Prince Haakon shaved his beard halfway through his parents' 80th birthday gala as a joke.\n\nThe lavish, two-day celebration for the King and Queen's 80th birthdays kicked off on May 9, 2017, with royals from all over the world flocking to the palace for a glittering, tiara-filled banquet. Halfway through the glamorous event, Haakon shaved his beard \"as part of the entertainment during the gala dinner.â\n\n5) When Prince Sverre showed just how bored he is by royal protocol.\n\nIn addition to officially adopting Marius, Haakon had two biological children with Mette-Marit: Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 13, and Prince Sverre Magnus, 11. Ingrid is the heir to the throne, but Sverre is a total badass. Look at this kid. He just DGAF:\n\nHere he is flashing a wide yawn during a traditional morning children's parade last year:\n\n6) When Prince Sverre did a bit of dabbing.\n\nSverre achieved viral stardom last week by dabbing, making funny faces, flashing the peace sign, and even picking his nose during a royal ceremony. What a hero.\n\nWe can't wait to see what our new favorite royals will do next."
