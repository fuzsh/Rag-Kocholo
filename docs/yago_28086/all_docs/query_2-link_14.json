        "text": "How much do you know about Norway’s Queen Sonja? From her love of hiking to her interest in art, find out more about the wife of King Harald and the mother of Norway’s next King.\n\nSince the late 1950s, she has been in the orbit of the man who would later become king of Norway. Sonja Haraldsen would end up marrying the love of her life in 1968, after a tumultuous courtship of nine years.\n\nFrom then on, she would be known as Crown Princess Sonja, and then later on as Queen Sonja.\n\nHer dedication to her royal duties, her support for music and the arts and her fundraising efforts for various charitable causes have made her a well-loved figure.\n\nLearn more about Queen Sonja of Norway by checking out our list of five lesser-known facts about her.\n\nQueen Sonja has a passion for art\n\nQueen Sonja has always had a passion for art, particularly the visual arts. In 2017, on the day of her 80th birthday, she opened the Queen Sonja Art Stable, located in the former Royal Stables.\n\nThese buildings, which had previously been inaccessible to the public, now host changing exhibitions which can be seen for a ticket price of 125 NOK. The Stables are located at the western end of the palace grounds, with the entrance on Parkveien.\n\nThe Queen also created the Queen Sonja Print Award, which is presented every other year with an aim to generate interest in and promote the development of graphic art. What started as a Nordic art award, accessible only to artists emanating from the five Nordic countries, evolved into an international one.\n\nRead more: An Introduction to Norwegian Art\n\nThe award consists of a cash prize of 400 000 NOK and a one-week educational stay at the art studio Atelje Larsen in Helsingborg, Sweden.\n\nOver the years, the Queen assembled an extensive private art collection, some of which has been on public display before. The collection features works by such artists as Jakob Weidemann, Kjell Nupen, Anna-Eva Bergman, Anne Katrine Dolven, Kjell Torriset and Andy Warhol.\n\nThe Queen also produces art of her own, She started creating her own prints in the 2000s, when she was in her late sixties, and has since then exhibited her works on multiple occasions.\n\nHer art has been described by some critics as that of a “skilled amateur”.\n\nHer relationship with the king was controversial at first\n\nWhen the courtship between Sonja Haraldsen and the man who would become the king started getting serious, the relationship raised many eyebrows.\n\nThe reason for the controversy was the fact that Sonja was a commoner. For King Olav, the then Crown Prince’s father, this meant she was off-bounds.\n\nRoyals are (or were at the time) expected to marry other royals, or at the very least someone from the nobility. But Harald was in love, and reputedly told his father that if he was not allowed to marry Sonja, he would never marry at all.\n\nThis of course would have meant the end of the royal line, since Harald was the sole heir to the throne (succession rules at the time meant his sisters were not eligible). Luckily for the couple, Olav relented and they were allowed to marry.\n\nSeeing how the pair stuck together over the decades and clearly still care very much about each other to this day, it’s difficult to imagine the story having taken any other turn.\n\nSonja is the Queen of the outdoors\n\nQueen Sonja has been seen many times donning hiking gear and exploring one of the country’s many trails.\n\nIn fact, a large number of trails and landmarks are named after her – one of the most notorious being HM Queen Sonja’s Panoramic Hiking Trail, in the Hardanger area.\n\nCrown Prince Haakon has been reported as saying that on many occasions, he went on a hike and entered a DNT (Norwegian Trekking Association) cabin only to be told by the people working there that “your mother was here last month”.\n\nThe Queen being seen in her hiking gear doing an activity that is such an important part of the country’s ethos goes a long way in making her appear as a grounded, down to earth figure despite her royal status.\n\nIn 2017, on the occasion of her 80th birthday, the Trekking Association gifted her a statue of herself which can now be seen in the Palace grounds. The bronze case by Kirsten Kokkin depicts Queen Sonja in her hiking clothes, taking a break with her rucksack by her side.\n\nThe statue rests on a piece of granite from Hedalen in the Valdres region. It is likely to cement her image as friluftlivets dronning, the Queen of the Outdoors.\n\nThe King and Queen have a playful relationship\n\nKing Harald is known for his dry sense of humour, and he has been known to target his wife with playful jibes. This happened on Norwegian TV a few years back, when the pair gave an interview.\n\nThe meme-transcription of the exchange first appeared in English on image-sharing website Imgur, before becoming viral on Reddit.\n\nSonja has a tiara with connections to Napoleon and Brazil\n\nOne of Queen Sonja’s tiaras, part of a set called the “Norwegian Emerald Parure”, has connections to both Napoleon and Brazil. The parure (a French word that means “adornment”) consists of a tiara, a necklace, earrings, and a brooch.\n\nBy some accounts, its first owner was Empress Josephine, the first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte. When Josephine died, she willed the parure to her son by a previous marriage, Eugene de Beauharnais.\n\nDe Beauharnais gave it to his wife, Princess Augusta Amelia of Bavaria. She in turn gave it to her daughter Amelia of Leuchenternberg who married Emperor Pedro I of Brazil.\n\nAmelia of Leuchenternberg bequeathed all her jewellery to her sister Josephine, the Queen of Norway and Sweden. The parure has remained in the Norwegian royal family ever since."
