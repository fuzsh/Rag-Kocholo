        "text": "My question: How long did the Norwegian prince and his mother stay at the White House? I've found online sources that detail he spent the war in Washington DC, but no dates for staying at the White House. The White House residential quarters aren't that large, were they really there for the entire war?\n\nIn April 1940 the Norwegian royal family was forced to flee Oslo when the Germans invaded.\n\nThe Doris Kearns Goodwin book No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the Home Front in World War II; contains this picture of the current King (then Prince) Harald V. playing with Franklin Delano Roosevelt's(FDR's) dog, Fala, on the North Lawn of the White House in 1944.\n\nIn the book it says that the young(second grader) and his mother lived at the White House with Eleanor and FDR throughout the war. They originally went to Sweden but even though she was a Swedish Princess they were denied a VISA and left for fear of being sent back to occupied Norway. The young Prince Harald V - 7 years old in the picture- and mother then went to Finland and eventually came to the United States. The crowned prince and father stayed in London with the government in exile. The book goes so far to say FDR arranged for the King of Norway to fly across the Atlantic on Christmas to celebrate with his wife and son on several occasions.\n\nPrincess Märtha following an invitation by President Roosevelt, she went to the United States on United States Army transport American Legion, via the then Finnish port city of Petsamo. In the U.S., she and her children initially stayed in the White House. Crown Prince Olav, however, had gone with his father to the United Kingdom, where he worked with the Norwegian government-in-exile. Thus, the crown couple, as were many couples during the time, were separated for much of the war.\n\nVital mission to Petsamo\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt directed that American Legion leave New York immediately and proceed to Petsamo in northern Finland. There, she was to embark the Crown Princess Märtha of Norway and her party and bring them to the United States, their homeland having fallen to the Germans the previous spring. Further, as Acting Secretary of State Sumner Welles reported to the United States Minister in Sweden, the President also desired that Mrs. J. Borden Harriman, the former American Minister to Norway, return in the same vessel. The transport would \"likewise bring back to this country such Americans in Scandinavian countries as can be accommodated and as may not be able to return safely in any other way.\"\n\nAmerican Legion — her neutrality shown clearly by the U.S. flags painted prominently on her sides — sailed for Finland on 25 July, and reached Petsamo on 6 August, as scheduled. On the 15th, she embarked Crown Princess Märtha, and her three children, the Princesses Ragnhild and Astrid, and Crown Prince Harald. The Army troopship also embarked a host of American nationals and refugees from a variety of countries: Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands, the total number of people being 897.\n\nIn August 1941, Crown Princess Märtha traveled with President Roosevelt aboard the presidential yacht, USS Potomac, and sailed to Newfoundland and Atlantic Charter with Winston Churchill.\n\nCrown Princess Martha of Norway with her three children reportedly arriving in New York City in 1940.\n\nEven though she was a former Swedish princess, some in Sweden believed her and her children compromised the country’s neutrality by being in Sweden. The four royals and three staff members then traveled to Finland.\n\nAt some point President Roosevelt invited Martha and her children to stay at the White House. The United States was also neutral at the time.\n\nCrown Princess Märtha with her husband, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas J. Watson and Princess Juliana of the Netherlands in 1944\n\nCurrent Picture.\n\nIt seems that Crown Princess Märtha and her three children, including prince Harald, didn't stay at the White House for very long. Several sources comment that they initially stayed at Roosevelt's Hyde Park estate, then (briefly) at the White House, before moving to Bethesda. For example, an article in the Washington Post observes:\n\nThey stayed briefly at [Roosevelt's] Hyde Park estate and then at the White House, before they settled into a Tudor-style mansion north of Bethesda, off a small road called the Rockville Pike.\n\nIt seems that while they were living at Bethesda, Harald attended the Whitehall School.\n\nThey arrived in New York aboard the American Legion on 28 August.\n\nFrom late 1940 until 1945 the family lived in a house on a 105-acre estate named \"Pook's Hill,\" in Bethesda. Several sites state that they lived there from October 1940, but do not quote sources. They were certainly living there by 12 November 1940, when the Pittston Gazette, and other newspapers, reported that President Roosevelt had visited for tea after laying the cornerstone of a new naval medical building at Bethesda.\n\n(That property had been purchased by the Norwegian government and would be sold in 1946.)\n\nSo, they could not have lived at the White House for more than 2 months (late August to late October). It was probably rather less.\n\nThe Norwegian Royal family had been invited to the US by President Roosevelt. As such they would have been considered to be his guests. They would probably have been invited to the White House fairly often. He certainly seems to have visited them fairly often.\n\nWe have photographic evidence that Harald met, and played with, FDR's dog Fala on at least one occasion. Probably more often in fact. However, as to how well he knew the dog, I'm not sure that was ever recorded by history.\n\nanswered Jan 10, 2018 at 1:02\n\nsempaiscubasempaiscuba\n\n77.1k1515 gold badges307307 silver badges358358 bronze badges"
