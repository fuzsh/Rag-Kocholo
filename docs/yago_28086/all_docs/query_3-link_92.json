        "text": "The Oslo team—a highly attractive group consisting of the Royal Norwegian Palace press secretary; the king’s personal secretary; a Norwegian police officer; two people from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Oslo; three representatives from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C.; and the Consulate General San Francisco, all escorted by PLU’s Nesselquist—arrives a little after 10 a.m. and is supremely professional and friendly. After warm introductions, everyone walks the proposed path the king will take on his quick tour of campus.\n\nOn the sidewalk between Mortvedt Library and Harstad Hall, where the king will arrive, we learn the following:\n\nall members of the media must be accredited by the embassy;\n\nno one may walk backward in front of the king to photograph him; and\n\nphotographers must be prepositioned and stand still.\n\nIn the Scandinavian Cultural Center, where the king will meet PLU students in a private reception, Consul Nesselquist explains our vision—and the Oslo team fires back questions and directions. This, obviously, is not their first royal rodeo:\n\n“His Majesty gets to interact with the students.”\n\n“Are they just standing? Once you sit down, time goes by in a different way.”\n\n“Prepare them to be proactive and start conversations.”\n\n“Cellphones will be down, or else I’m going to be in a lot of those photos, putting them down.”\n\n“The main thing is the conversation, not a photo. The king is not a politician who does photo ops.”\n\nThe Oslo group speaks Norwegian quite often. Those of us who do not smile and nod a lot.\n\nThe Norwegians request a “holding room” for the king so he can rest and relax briefly between the reception and the luncheon. His needs are more modest than you might expect: hot towels and mineral water.\n\nOutside, where the palace press secretary declares we will host the only press conference of the king’s Washington visit, we notice a pin on the Norwegian policeman. It looks like an X, but he explains it’s the symbol for cross-country skiing: Two skiers saved the king of Norway’s son in the mountains in the year 1206, he tells us.\n\nAfter a lovely lunch together, everyone tours the Tacoma Dome. We pace out the walk to the king’s “green room,” where he’ll change into his academic regalia for Commencement. We request a large press platform—more than a dozen members of the Norwegian press will follow the king on May 23, and already five or six local organizations have applied for credentials.\n\nSven Gjeruldsen, the palace press secretary, asks us to move the press platform so photographers will have a better view of the king at the podium. It is done.\n\nGjeruldsen, who really knows what he’s doing and might be a little magical, asks often, very sweetly: “Are you satisfied?”\n\nWhat a refreshing question. Our PLU plans are approved with very few changes. We all are satisfied. And relieved.\n\nConsul Nesselquist is in almost constant contact with the palace. Today palace staffers have requested brief biographies and photos of everyone the king will meet.\n\nWe also learn the Secret Service is coming to PLU on May 12 and realize, once again, everything could change in an instant.\n\nDr. Elisabeth Ward, director of the Scandinavian Cultural Center, presents the lineup for the public welcoming festivities in Centennial Plaza. It’s truly a community event, and it could not be more festive.\n\nToday a subset of the committee walks the king’s campus route again, this time trying to gauge how the media will hustle from one designated press area to the next, through crowd-control ropes (and crowds), before the king arrives at each official photo opportunity. Two people walk at what we suspect is a regal pace, while I impersonate the press and literally jog from point A to point B to point C. It is doable, thank goodness. (We learn on May 23, however, that we greatly underestimated the king’s cadence—he is very spry.)"
