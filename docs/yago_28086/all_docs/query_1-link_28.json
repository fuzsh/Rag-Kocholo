        "text": "King Harald's early life\n\nKing Harald was born on 21 February 1937 at the royal estate of Skaugum outside Oslo. He was six years old when Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1943.\n\nFleeing just hours before the arrival of the occupation forces, Harald, his mother and two elder sisters, Ragnhild and Astrid, escaped to Sweden and from there travelled to the United States where they spent the duration of the war. Harald's grandfather, King Haakon, and the government held out until June before they too left, setting up a government-in-exile in London.\n\nAfter Norway was liberated in 1945, the royal family returned home.\n\nKing Harald's education\n\nHarald attended a state primary school with only the presence of a police guard in the corridor distinguishing him from his schoolmates. He graduated from secondary school in 1955 and enrolled at Norway's military academy.\n\nHe then studied political science, history and economics at Balliol College, Oxford, as his father had before him. Thirty years later, on 17 January 1991, he was sworn in as King Harald V, upon the death of his father King Olav V.\n\nLOOK: The European royals' lavish summer residences will take your breath away\n\nKing Harald's marriage\n\nBefore departing for England, Harald had already met his future wife Sonja Haraldsen, an Oslo University graduate. An heir to the throne marrying a non-royal was unprecedented, but the couple's engagement was announced in March 1968 following consultations between King Olav and the government.\n\nKing Harald and Queen Sonja got married in August 1968 at Oslo Cathedral.\n\nKing Harald's children\n\nThey are parents to two children: Princess Märtha Louise, who was born in 1971, and Crown Prince Haakon Magnus, born two years later.\n\nThe latter has served as regent on several occasions amid the King's ill health, which has included urinary bladder cancer in 2005 and cardiac surgery in 2020.\n\nDISCOVER: 5 shocking royal kidnap and assassination attempts over the years: From Princess Anne to King Charles\n\nMore Profiles\n\nSee more\n\nMichael Kors - Biography\n\nAll you need to know about the incredible fashion designer\n\nKourtney Kardashian - Biography\n\nKourtney Kardashian is a mom of four and business owner\n\nScott Disick - Biography\n\nScott Disick is best known as Kourtney Kardashian's ex-partner\n\nColin Firth - Biography\n\nColin Firth is an Oscar-winning actor who has revived again and again the role of Mr Darcy\n\nSamuel L.
