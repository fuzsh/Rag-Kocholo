        "text": "King Harald, second cousin to the late Queen Elizabeth, is the current crown of Norway. At 86, Harald is the oldest ruling monarch in Europe. With the former Queen Margrethe of Denmark abdicating as Queen last week, and passing the throne to her son Frederik and his wife Mary, eyes are on Harald to see if he will follow suit. But it seems that his daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Mette-Marit has health issues, which may be delaying his passing of the sovereign baton.\n\nDiscussion moved to the potential passing of the crown in Norway during this week’s Hello! Magazine’s ‘Right Royal’ podcast, with Joe Little from ITV News commenting that whilst King Harald is ‘not in the best of health’, abdicating is a ‘very fine balancing test to have.’\n\nRead More\n\nTasmanian Queen of Danish hearts! Is Queen Mary more popular than King Frederik?\n\nThe newly crowned King Frederik and Queen Mary were met by adoring crowds on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace as they were proclaimed on Sunday – but is one more popular than the other…?\n\nIf the passing of the throne is a delicate dance, then it seems that Denmark is waltzing ahead. Queen Margrethe was a popular and flamboyant leader, known for outrageous outfits and a strong, assertive tone during public addresses. Her son and daughter-in-law, however, have seemingly already flourished into their roles as the Danish leaders, with Queen Mary proving immensely popular in polls. Despite being Tasmanian by birth, the Danes appear fond of their new ruler, whose quietly luxurious style and glossy brown locks have been compared to Princess Kate.\n\nSo, why is the path of succession more stormy across the North Sea in Norway? Largely, the press are assuming that it’s due to Crown Princess Mette-Marit experiencing several health issues in recent years. Her health obstacles have led to the Crown Princess canceling some public appearances, including the Christmas celebration that was held at the Palace Chapel at the Royal Palace in Oslo. The Crown Princess’s illness also meant she was omitted from the traditional Norwegian Christmas portrait. The Christmas image did, however, feature her husband, Crown Prince Haakon and their two younger children, Princess Ingrid and Prince Sverre, whilst her elder son – a child from a previous relationship before Prince Haakon – wasn’t featured.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time that the Princess was unfortunately MIA, having taken two weeks of ‘sick leave’ in September of 2023, as well as being forced to cancel engagements since March 2018 due to ill health and an operation. She was officially and publicly diagnosed with chronic pulmonary fibrosis – a severe condition involving scarring on the lungs – in 2018, though it is unclear if her ongoing leave is related. Princess Mette-Marit, who is now 50, has also suffered with vertigo historically, which could be contributing to her incapacitation.\n\nThe Princess of Wales will no doubt identify with her royal comrade, currently having to take step back from all royal duties in order to carry out and recover from scheduled abdominal surgery. Reportedly Kate will not be returning to official engagements before the Easter period of this year. Kate and Crown Princess Mette-Marit were reunited, along with the princes, in March 2023 during the Norwegian royals' visit to the UK, which was rescheduled during the pandemic period."
