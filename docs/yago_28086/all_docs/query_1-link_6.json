        "text": "King Harald V of Norway turns 87 today. The Norwegian king recently expressed his commitment to reigning for the entirety of his lifetime, in spite of the example set by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark by her recent abdication. Harald nevertheless seems to be good shape as he enters his 88th year. Tatler decided it was an apt moment to glance back at his fascinating life – which includes numerous ties to Britain.\n\nHarald was born in 1937, the third child and only son of King Olav V and Princess Märtha of Sweden; making him second in line of succession behind his father. Among his maternal relations were King George VI and Queen Mary, who were named as godparents upon the birth of the young prince.\n\nIn 1940, the entire Norwegian royal family fled Oslo as a result of the German invasion of Norway. It was deemed safer for the royal family to separate, so King Haakon (Harald’s grandfather) along with Crown Prince Olav (Harald's father) remained in Oslo; meanwhike, the Crown Princess made her way to Sweden with the three children. En route, they encountered problems at the border station, in spite of the fact that Princess Märtha was Swedish born. In any case, before long it was decided that Sweden was not the safest place for the family.\n\nOn 17 August, the Crown Princess and the children set sail for the US aboard the US army ship, American Legion. Living in the US as a young boy, Prince Harald is said to have enjoyed life alongside his siblings Princess Ragnhild and Princess Astrid. They stayed for a time at the home of Frederic Shaefer, a wealthy Pittsburgh socialite and enjoyed the beaches of Cape Cod during the summer. One memorable moment Harald has recalled is standing on the portico of the White House in 1945 as Franklin D. Roosevelt was sworn in President. The Norwegian royals also known spent time at Laura Delano’s house in Rhinebeck, New York. The faint American accent Harald still has when speaking English is a trace of this American childhood.\n\nAfter the liberation of Norway, Harald and his family returned home: his father and grandfather from exile in London, and his mother and siblings together with Harald from America. As Harald returned to schooling in Norway, other highlights included a trip to the UK for the 1948 Olympics.\n\nIn 1954, when Harald was just 17, his mother, Crown Princess Martha died of cancer – in a terrible blow to the young prince and to the people of Norway. Harald would later name his own daughter Martha to honour his mother’s memory. After graduating from high school, Harald studied for a time at the University of Oslo and then the Norwegian Military academy.\n\nIn 1957, upon the death of his grandfather Haakon VII, Harald’s father, Olav V became King and Harald Crown Prince. In 1958 he also served as a regent for a period during the King’s absence. In 1960, another of Harald’s important ties to the UK was established as he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford, Harald studied history, economics and politics and became an avid rower. Harald excelled as a sportsman from a young age and proved this on the international stage when he represented Norway in sailing at the olympics in Tokyo (1964) Mexico City (1968) and Munich (1972).\n\nIn spite of opposition from his father – who objected to the Prince marrying a commoner – Harald married Sonja Haraldsen in 1968. It is said that the Prince told his father he would rather never marry than marry a woman other than Sonja. This would have brought an end to the family’s dynasty, and so the King eventually relented. It is believed that the couple first met at a dinner party held by Harald’s friend Johan Stenerse in 1959; they then dated on and off for nine years before marrying. The couple went on to have two children, Princess Martha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon, who is the heir apparent to the Norwegian throne.\n\nHarald became King upon the death of his father in January 1991. Because of the political vicissitudes of the Norwegian state, Harald became the first Norwegian born monarch since Olav IV, who died in 1387. Harald’s reign has been marked by general modernisation of the Norwegian royal house, an endeavour in which he has collaborated with Queen Sonja and the Crown Prince. The house has generally become more open to the public and media, while two more commoners have been accepted into the family, Ari Behn and Crown Princeess Mette-Marit.\n\nThe monarchy remains broadly very popular in Norway – a 2022 survey saw 78% of Norwegians express their support. This enduring popularity has no doubt been helped by King Harald’s much acclaimed leadership during recent national crises, such as the New Year’s Day Storm, the July 2011 massacre and the Covid pandemic. The King will be hoping for a peaceful time as he sets about his 88th year."
