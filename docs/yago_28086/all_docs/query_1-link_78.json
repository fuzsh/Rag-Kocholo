        "text": "King Harald V has been hospitalized in Malaysia for an infection, the Norwegian Royal House said in a statement. He has been hospitalized at the Sultanah Maliha Hospital, where he is receiving treatment from \"both Malaysian and Norwegian medical personnel,\" the royal household said.\n\nDuring his private trip, it was always planned that his son, Crown Prince Haakon, would serve as regent. \"We spoke to my mother and father this morning,\" Haakon told reporters today. \"It seems that his health was a little better.\" The Crown Prince added, \"What he needs now is to be in the hospital for a few more days and to get some rest.\"\n\nKing Harald, who turned 87 last week, is Europe's oldest monarch, and has been beset by numerous health issues in recent years. In January, he was on sick leave for a respiratory infection. This past fall, he had COVID for the second time, and in May 2023, he was also hospitalized with an infection. Recently, following Queen Margrethe's abdication, Harald was asked if he would ever abdicate. \"I stick by what I've always said, that I swore an oath to the Storting [parliament] and it is for life,\" the King said.\n\nHe ascended to the throne in 1991, upon the death of his father, King Olav. Harald is married to Queen Sonja, and they have two children: Princess Märtha Louise and Prince Haakon. Though Märtha is older than her brother, the Norwegian constitution held until 1990 that only male heirs could inherit. That has since changed, so Prince Haakon and Princess Mette-Marit's eldest daughter, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, is currently second in line for the Norwegian throne."
