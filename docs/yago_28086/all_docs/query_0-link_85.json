        "text": "King Harald's daughter said the new cipher honors \"our past life together in Egypt\"\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise of Norway revealed a romantic new monogram with Shaman Durek Verrett ahead of their summer wedding.\n\nOn July 1, Princess Märtha Louise unveiled a new cipher interlocking the initials of her and her fiancé's first names with hieroglyphics and Egyptian symbols, explaining its meaning.\n\nMärtha Louise, 52, clarified that the design was \"not an official monogram, as I no longer represent the royal family at official functions.\" The only daughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja renounced royal responsibilities in 2022 and doesn't use her princess title despite retaining it.\n\n\"This monogram is merely a wonderful emblem embedded with important symbolism for both @shamandurek and myself embracing our love,\" she wrote on Instagram, revealing the emblem on a pink background followed by a labeled identification.\n\nShe thanked ANTI Hamar, the team behind the design, for capturing the essence she and Durek share as a couple and said that the monogram honors \"our past life together in Egypt.\"\n\nRelated: Princess Märtha Louise of Norway Slams 'Lies' in Norwegian Press Ahead of Her Wedding to Shaman Durek\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise broke down the hieroglyphic meanings of the letters M and D, as well as the significance of the Eye of Horus (\"a symbol of protection from evil\"), horses (\"a central animal through both our lives\"), a heart (love) and an owl (wisdom). She said the infinity symbol symbolizes their \"eternal bond,\" while the diamond stands for \"the portal between the physical and the metaphysical realms.\"\n\n\"This monogram truly speaks to our cores, representing us and our love, and we are truly grateful and honored that it signifies our unity to the world,\" Märtha Louise concluded with a heart.\n\nIt's custom for royal houses to unveil joint monograms after couples tie the knot, as modern couples Prince William and Kate Middleton, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank all have.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise and Durek have been together for five years. The royal revealed her relationship with the Los Angeles-based spiritual guide in a doting Instagram post describing Durek as her \"twin flame\" in May 2019, and the couple announced their engagement in June 2022.\n\nIn September 2023, Märtha Louise announced that they planned to get married in August 2024 at the historic Hotell Union in Geiranger, Norway.\n\nThe Royal House of Norway shared well-wishes on behalf of the King and Queen as well as Märtha Louise's brother, Crown Prince Haakon and his wife, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, following the announcement of the wedding date.\n\n“The Queen and I are delighted that Princess Märtha Louise and Durek Verrett have announced their wedding plans today. We are happy to include Durek Verret in our family and look forward to celebrating the big day with them. We wish Märtha and Durek all the best,” King Harald, 87, and Queen Sonja, 86, said in a statement.\n\n\"We congratulate Princess Märtha and Durek Verrett on their wedding in August next year. We are happy for them and look forward to celebrating with them in Geiranger. We wish Märtha, Durek and the girls all the best for the future,\" echoed Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.\n\nRelated: Meet Norway's Royal Family: All About the 1,000-Year-Old Monarchy\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise is mom to daughters Maud Angelica, 21, Leah Isadora, 19, and Emma Tallulah, 15, whom she shares with her ex-husband, Ari Behn. The couple split in 2016 after 14 years of marriage, with a divorce finalized the following year.\n\nBehn died by suicide at age 47 in 2019, and Märtha Louise was open about dealing with depression following her ex-husband's death.\n\nShe found love again a few years later when she and Durek met, and the shaman to the stars told PEOPLE that he included tributes to her loved ones in her engagement ring. The sparkler's center gem is an emerald, a favorite stone of Queen Sonja, and the three diamonds on each side represent her daughters Maud, Leah and Emma.\n\n\"I made sure her daughters were included in it, as well as Queen Sonja, to celebrate my love for her and to honor bringing this beautiful woman into my life. It was important to me to keep the heritage tradition strong,\" Durek previously told PEOPLE, adding that his \"dear friend Gwyneth Paltrow\" was the first to see it — and approved.\n\nWhile speaking to PEOPLE in June 2022, Princess Märtha Louise said that she and Durek planned to split their time between California and Norway. That November, the Royal House of Norway announced that Märtha Louise was officially stepping away from her royal role.\n\nThe palace said the decision was made so Princess Märtha Louise could more freely pursue other interests without the restrictions of being affiliated with the crown. She retains her princess title and remains welcome at family events, the statement said.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise confirmed the news in an Instagram video and said the transition process had been smooth, \"where we have all embraced each other's views in a loving and respectful way.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

I see alternative medicine as an important supplement to school medicine.\"\n\n\"Hope this brings greater peace both for the Royal House in their important work and for my fiancee, Durek Verrett and me,\" she wrote in close.\n\nHer royal exit did not affect the Norwegian line of succession. Though Princess Märtha Louise is two years older than her brother Crown Prince Haakon, he was always destined to inherit the throne. Absolute primogeniture — the right to rule regardless of gender — was not constitutionally adopted in Norway until 1990. Crown Prince Haakon is followed in the line of succession by his first child and only daughter, 20-year-old Princess Ingrid Alexandra.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
