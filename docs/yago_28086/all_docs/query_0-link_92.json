        "text": "Who is the present monarch of Norway?\n\nKing Harald V is the present monarch. He succeeded to the throne on January 17, 1991, upon the death of his father King Olav V.\n\nWhat is King Harald’s address?\n\nThe Private Secretary to HM The King\n\nThe Royal Palace\n\nDrammensveien 1\n\nN-0010 Oslo, Norway\n\nWhat are the current laws of succession?\n\nIn 1990, the succession law was changed to allow cognatic succession in which succession passes to the eldest child of the monarch regardless of gender. An exception was made for Princess Märtha Louise so she would not displace her younger brother, Crown Prince Haakon. Before 1990, the Salic Law, which prohibits female succession, was in effect. The monarch must belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church and marriages must be with the consent of the monarch. For more information see, ICL – Norway – Constitution\n\nWhat is the Norwegian Royal Family’s last name?\n\nThe Norwegian Royal Family’s last name is Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg married Princess Luise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel, a granddaughter of King Frederik V of Denmark, in 1810. Christian, their fourth son, was chosen by the childless King Frederik VII of Denmark to be his heir. Christian acceded to the Danish throne as King Christian IX in 1863. Christian IX’s grandson Prince Carl, son of King Frederik VIII of Denmark, was elected to the Norwegian throne in 1905 when the union of Sweden and Norway was dissolved. He ruled as King Haakon VII until 1957. The royal families of Denmark and Greece also belong to the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.\n\nHow does one address the Royal Family?\n\nKing Harald II is addressed as His Majesty The King and his wife, Queen Sonja, is addressed as Her Majesty The Queen. Only children of the monarch, children of the heir to the throne and their wives are addressed as His/Her Royal Highness. All other princes and princesses are addressed as His/Her Highness. King Harald V’s daughter and his surviving elder sister married a commoner (as did his deceased elder sister Princess Ragnhild), lost their Highness titles and are known as Princess Märtha Louise and Princess Astrid, Mrs. Ferner.\n\nCan a member of the Norwegian Royal Family marry whoever s/he chooses?\n\nMembers of the Royal Family must have the consent of the monarch to marry.\n\nHow long has there been a monarchy in Norway?\n\nNorway has been ruled by a monarch since 872, however, Norway has an interesting history in that it has been united with other countries for most of its existence and therefore has been ruled by monarchs of other countries. Only from 872-1262 and from 1905 to the present has there been an actual Kingdom of Norway. Olav IV Haakonsson, born in 1370, was the last Norwegian king to be born in Norway until the birth of the present king, Harald V in 1937.\n\nWhat does the Norwegian flag mean?\n\nNorway’s flag is red and white with an off-center blue Scandinavian cross. It depicts the Danish flag with a cross added. Norway’s flag was adopted in 1821 when Norway was united with Sweden. The colors were chosen from the French flag as a symbol of liberty and revolution.\n\nWhat is the Royal Family’s coat of arms?\n\nThe Royal Coat of Arms depicts a golden lion holding a silver axe on a red background. See Norway Coat of Arms\n\nWhere do the Norwegian royals stand in the line of succession to the British throne?\n\nThe Norwegian and British royal families are both descended from King Edward VII (1841-1910), son of Queen Victoria. The British royal family is descended from Edward VII’s son, George V and the Norwegian royal family is descended from Edward VII’s daughter Maud who married King Haakon VII. Thus King Harald V and Queen Elizabeth II are second cousins. King Harald is the foreign royal most closely related to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nHow is King Harald related to other current European monarchs?\n\nBelgium: King Philippe and King Harald are first cousins once removed. Philippe’s grandmother and Harald’s mother were both daughters of Prince Carl of Sweden.\n\nDenmark: Queen Margrethe II and King Harald are second cousins twice. They are both great-grandchildren of King Frederik VIII of Denmark from two lines.\n\nLiechtenstein: Prince Hans-Adam II and King Harald are both descendants of King Maximilian I Josef of Bavaria. Hans-Adam is his great-great-great-grandson and Harald is his great great great great grandson.\n\nLuxembourg: Grand Duke Henri and King Harald are both descendants of Prince Carl of Sweden. Henri is his great-grandson and Harald is his grandson.\n\nMonaco: Prince Albert II and King Harald are both descendants of Landgrave Ludwig IX of Hesse-Darmstadt. Albert is his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson and Harald is his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson.\n\nNetherlands: King Willem-Alexander and King Harald are both descendants of Prince Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg. Willem-Alexander is his great-great-great-great-grandson and Harald is his great-great-great-grandson.\n\nSpain: King Felipe VI and King Harald are both descendants of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Felipe is her great-great-great-grandson and Harald is her great-great-grandson.\n\nSweden: King Carl XVI Gustaf and King Harald are both descendants of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway. Carl Gustaf is his great-great-grandson and Harald is his great-grandson.\n\nUnited Kingdom: Queen Elizabeth II and King Harald are both great-grandchildren of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom."
