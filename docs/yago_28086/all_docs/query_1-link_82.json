The king and his wife, Queen Sonja, visited Augsburg in 2011. This recognition—originally scheduled for 2020 but delayed by the pandemic—was part of Augsburg’s sesquicentennial anniversary celebration.\n\nTop image: An Augsburg student participating in the Norway Hub wears a Norwegian flag while walking through campus.
