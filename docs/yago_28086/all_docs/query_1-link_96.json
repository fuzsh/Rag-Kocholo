It's the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary.\"\n\nIt's their first wedding anniversary since succeeding to their new roles of King and Queen in January.\n\nDanish tradition dictates that the first official overseas roya l tour of a reigning monarch and his spouse is done to their neighbouring countries, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe couple met with Swedish royals, King Carl Gustaf, Queen Silvia , Crown Princess Victoria, Prince Carl Philip and his wife, Princess Sofia last week.\n\nOn their arrival in Oslo, Queen Mary and King Frederik mingled with the huge crowds waving Danish flags who had gathered to get a glimpse of them.\n\nThey then headed to an official reception and posed for photos, sharing a behind-the-scenes clip to social media.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nRelive the moment an Aussie girl became royalty 20 years ago\n\n\"Thank you for the nice welcome, Norway,\" they said.\n\n\"Their Majesties the King and Queen earlier began the state visit to Norway at the Honnøbryggen in Oslo.\n\n\"The Norwegian Royal Family and a lot of citizens from both Norway and Denmark attended the reception.\"\n\nIn the clip, King Harald, 87, can be seen using crutches to walk after having just returned to official duties last month after having a pacemaker fitted amid ongoing health issues.\n\nKing Frederik, 55, succeeded to the throne in January after his mother, Queen Margrethe, 84, abdicated after a 52-year reign due to health issues.\n\nKing Harald V of Norway, at 87, is Europe's oldest reigning monarch.\n\nBut in light of Margrethe's abdication, he announced he has no plans to step down.\n\nHowever, the monarch has scaled back his official activities with Crown Prince Haakon stepping in more for his father."
