        "text": "King Harald V of Norway\n\nAmong the Norwegians, King Harald is widely known for his great ability to show empathy and compassion – and not to forget: his dry wit. He is a man that makes his people laugh.\n\nHis father, King Olav V, was known as the people’s king – folkekongen – but King Harald could well be known as Harald the Wise – Harald Den Vise. Every woman and man in need of support can be sure to have him watch their back.\n\nHarald is a man so down to earth, so loyal to his family and his people, that if a Norwegian were to stumble upon him in the street, her first thought would probably be to give him a hug.\n\nKing Harald is a world-class sailor and a gold medallist, both in European and World championships.\n\nSince Harald’s accession to the throne in 1991, he and Sonja, as a strong unit, have lifted the Norwegian monarchy into the realm of the new millennium.\n\nKing Harald V is the son of King Olav V and Crown Princess Märtha, and grandson of King Haakon VII and Queen Consort Maud of Norway.\n\nQueen Sonja of Norway\n\nQueen Sonja had a tough start to her royal life, fighting the then misogyny of the Norwegian court. Being a commoner did not exactly help.\n\nAs the country’s new crown princess in 1968, it took her a long time just to get her own office.\n\nThrough her interest in art, she has contributed significantly to the preservation of royal buildings and royal collections.\n\nQueen Sonja is an avid outdoors person, and has visited most sections of the majestic Norwegian landscape.\n\nShe is also an artist in her own right – and in recent years, she has had several exhibitions, presenting her art.\n\nIn 2017, in connection with Queen Sonja’s 80th birthday, the royal palace in Oslo opened Queen Maud’s old stables as an exhibition area. The next time that you find yourself in the Norwegian capital, we strongly recommend that you visit The Queen Sonja Art Stable.\n\nThe royal children\n\nOne can argue that by taking a closer look at someone’s children, you will also be able to say something about their parents.\n\nThe King and Queen’s two children – Princess Märtha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon Magnus – are compassionate, passionate, and grounded individuals – and a big credit to their father and mother.\n\nEGP.00017"
