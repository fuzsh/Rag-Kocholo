On 29th August 1968, then Crown Prince Harald of Norway married Sonja Haraldsen at Oslo Domkirke in Norway's capital city. Their romance is the stuff of fairytales. Sonja and Harald dated for nine years before tying the knot. Harald had been forbidden from marrying Sonja as she was a commoner. The enamoured future King made it clear that if he couldn't marry Sonja he would never marry, putting the succession at risk. Faced with the prospect of the monarchy ending, Harald's father King Olav relented and let the lovebirds marry. The rest, as they say, is history!

The future Queen of Norway wore a design by Norwegian brand Molstad. The simple, elegant gown was made of silk. The wonderful Order of Splendor describes it as having "a high round neck, a bell shaped skirt and three-quarter length bell sleeves to match." The dress also featured delicate pearls around the cuff and neck.

The wedding ceremony itself went without a hitch. Despite waiting so long to marry, Sonja's commoner status had now become a badge of honour and the Bishop of Oslo remarked in his sermon that "a new and very strong link has been created between the royal family and the Norwegian people" through the marriage of a future King and a private citizen. After driving through the streets the newlyweds returned to Oslo Royal Palace for the reception and appeared on the balcony to wave to their people.
