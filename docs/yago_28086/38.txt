Queen Sonja, born Sonja Haraldson, is married to King Harald V of Norway. When Harald was still crown prince, the couple kept their relationship a secret due to Sonja's status as a commoner. The pair wed in August 1968 after Harald told his father King Olav V he would remain unmarried unless he could marry Sonja. Upon their marriage, Sonja became Crown Princess, and on Harald's accession became Queen. The couple have two children Princess Martha Louise and heir apparent Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway.
