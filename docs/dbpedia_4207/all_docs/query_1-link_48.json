        "text": "January\n\n1 January 1888\n\nThis is my first attempt at keeping a diary, I wonder how long it will last, Jess & I have started together We are waiting to see the New Year in & wondering what it will bring for us. Tom Stafford & Mr Hunt are also waiting for the New Year Georgie Bruce Mary Stafford Grandfather & Uncle Kenny are in bed I wonder where we will, all be this night next year I also wonder if we will be all spared to each other. We have had many blessings through the past year only one has gone from us to a better country (dear little Teecie) many might have been taken. Will Jessie & I be in the same place (sitting in our bedroom) one thing if we are absent from each other in the flesh (if spared) we are together in Spirit & the one Father will be with us & I trust will. all our loved ones. My thoughts are with all our dear ones in Melbourne & those in Nowra & wish them all much happiness in the coming year. Will dearest Jessie be spared to us.\n\nSunday\n\nThe New Year is just in & I wish everybody good things. Late getting up this morning, not feeling well, spent a busy Sunday, Mr Sullivan was with us for dinner Enjoyed the Sunday School lessons very much, but had the feeling that I did not say as much to the children as I should have done. I must put things more plainly before them how much I feel my own weakness & long to lean upon God. Mr Jones preached a very good & profitable sermon. Ma McGregor Pa & family had tea with us Mr Hunt Tom S & Mary S. went home to Nowra, Georgie & Bruce with Ma. Jess & I read a while then retired about eight oclock.\n\nMonday 2\n\nLovely morning, Jess got up first, While at breakfast Dubbs came & said Jess could go to B Creek with us, we hurried round & got our work done & Jess went to the Office where Uncle & I picked her up at 10 oclock, had a most pleasant drive to B Creek & was very pleased when we got there to find all the Dymock family there, all looking well & very glad to see us Mr D was just as kind & nice as ever & promised to come & see us soon, we spent a pleasant day with them wandering allover the place, Mama included. What true hearted friends the Dymocks are I cannot say how large a place they have in my heart We left B Creek for home about 5 oclock. I was much disappointed at not getting to see dear little Teecie's & dear Mags grave I was afraid to ask Uncle to go, it was not easy to pass without going. Roads wet & muddy coming home arrived safely & not sorry to be home. Aleck came just as we were going to bed, had his tea & talked a little to us. Bed is the best place (for me whatever).\n\nTuesday 3\n\nJess up first & got me a warm bath, got up & got breakfast felt so unwell after that I had to lie for a bit, very hot day, did not exert myself in the least. As soon as dinner was over Uncle & I drove down to Nowra went to the prayer meeting in the Wesleyan Church Mr Best gave the address & it was very refreshing. After we came out Tom Stafford & all the others wanted me to stay & go to Yalwal so Tom asked Uncle he was a bit vexed at first but very kindly let me stay. Went off to bed & prepared for an early rise.\n\nWednesday 4\n\nGot up at 5, all but Mary S. she was not well enough. Bob Tom S Mr Hunt Georgie & I had breakfast & started off to Bobs shop to catch the coach all managed to pack in & started off very jolly had a most lovely day but rather a rough drive. The men had to walk a lot Was surprised to see Yalwal was such a pretty place, we went up the shaft where no woman had ever been before, it was grand. The walk to the Homeward Bound was rather steep & long saw the crushing machine at work Had dinner together, given peach pie very enticing? Had a little chat sitting in the shade I could not help thinking of dear Jess when I was at McPhersons, thinking of what she told me of them. All felt hungry so Tom S & Mr H started to look for a shop but failed to get anything eatable. Started for home about 4 o’c wanting something to eat enjoyed the drive home very well just a wee bit cold did not get home until after 8 oclock too late for Church was disappointed Had a good tea nice beef steak. Tom S prepared for leaving next morning (by Mainderry) by cleaning his boots all went off to bed believing that it was the best place for us.\n\nThursday 5\n\nHad to get up in good time to see Tom Bruce & Mary S off by Coomenderry for Sydney felt very sorry to part with them, I wish good byes did not come so often But they show us plainly that this is not our abiding place Tom T & Mr Hunt went to the steamer with them & saw them off we watched for them off the balcony but missed the steamer much to our disgust. Uncle brought Grandfather down & UK [Uncle Kenneth] & Kate went down to the point with Frasers & Matthews fishing, had a lovely day but only brought one fish home. Geo did some washing & sewing & I made an apron for her. Mother busy (as usual) preparing for her trip to Sydney. After dinner Tom & Mr Hunt went to Cambe. Mr H went to say goodbye to Jess came back at 6 oclock had tea & worship enjoyed Toms prayer very much indeed & wish I was as earnest as he. Mother Grandfather Mr H Tom & I went to church in the Church of England, place full, Mr Dobbie addressed the meeting was very earnest & very nice Mr Best called on Tom to pray as usual his prayer was very earnest. All came home together & prepared for bed at once as Geo & Mr H to go by coach in the morning did not want them to go, Geo especially I often wonder why we cannot all live together, but it must be best as it is.\n\nFriday 6\n\nMr Hunt Geo Mother Kate & I got up at 2 oclock, Tom a little later had a little breakfast with Geo & Mr H. Tom & I went to the coach with them, just in time to catch the coach which was nearly full. Saw them off safely & came home & went to bed & had a good sleep. Got up again at 7, lovely morning. They will have a lovely day for travelling. Set to work cleaned up after breakfast. I swept upstairs & Kate dusted, Mother scrubbed the hall & dining room would not let we do it she is preparing for her trip tomorrow, doing as much as possible for Kate. Mother is a most unselfish woman & there are few as good as she what a lot we owe to having such a good mother. Tom is preparing the sermon for Sunday in Dr Grants church. Grandfather has done his best at the pump & is having a quiet nap now. Mother Kate & Auntie M. went out visiting Auntie going to stay until Monday. Tom did some gardening & I some sewing got tea ready & then had a little read (Frances R Havergal) Went to prayer meeting & enjoyed it very well\n\nSaturday 7\n\nMother left house a little past 8 for the point Grandfather went with her to steamer did not leave until 1 oclock Auntie Sam went out visiting. Kate & I had a wee sleep & in the afternoon Uncle K came & brought some nice peaches, great treat Tom & Uncle went to the McArthurs to tea. Kate & I had tea alone on the little round table & hoped no one would come to help us (selfish) Went for a walk after tea & called at Hewletts & then went to prayer meeting Mr Best sang [UNCLEAR] the whole meeting was nice. Came home & found the place very tidy after being away so long\n\nSunday 8\n\nDid not get up until 8 oclock as there was no church had a nice time for reading & preparing for S School, enjoyed the morning very much Went to school trying to speak plainly to my children, tried with Gods help to make them see what a cheerful thing religion is. Mary Matthews came home with me & Uncle & I went back with her to tea. Went to Nowra. Tom preached the service to me was beautiful, long time since I enjoyed a service so much Tom was very earnest & did very well his text was in Rev. 21 \"There shall be no night there\" felt quite satisfied. When church was over longed to tell him how I at least enjoyed the service, got home safely & went straight to my room.\n\nMonday 9\n\nThe sun soon made me aware that it was time to get up. How I enjoyed walking & feeling that I had had a good nights rest & that God had watched over me & spared me to see another day. I am always thankful to Tom for telling me never to neglect reading a short portion night & morning. I never remember neglecting to do so, it is to me a great means of peace & a great priviledge . I want to love to read the Bible more & more Had a busy day did a good lot of cooking & tidied up a bit. After tea went to the store & Jess was ready to come home with me, Uncle was at the Office so we all went up to Aunties for a cold lemon drink it was lovely. After we came home Aleck came & brought news that dear Jess had had a relapse & was in a critical but not hopeless state, sad sad news making us very anxious All is in Gods hands & He will do what is best for us. Poor Bob left this morning for Melbourne\n\nTuesday 10\n\nNo more news of dear Jess, how I hope Bob will get there in time for we have little hope of her, how hard it would be if she was called home & Bob not there, but God is good. Poor Ma Billis & all what an anxious time for them wish I could help them. It will be very hard if we had to part with dear Jessie Poor Bob. I do feel for him. They have been in my thoughts continually today. Oh the comfort of knowing that all is in Gods hands & that dear Jess is one of His Jewels. How good our Father is & yet how weak our love for Him is but the time will soon come when we shall be with Him & love Him as we ought. Katie & Becky McPaul got the Bible society card this evening I must pray earnestly for them that they may really love to read their Bibles & belong to Christ. Aleck came up after Office hours no more news of dear Jessie. Jessie & Uncle went to Nowra. Its time to prepare for bed Good night everybody\n\nWednesday 11\n\nNo more news of dear Jessie Have not got my diary yet & am tired of waiting for it therefore will not write much until I do get it.\n\nThursday 12\n\nDont remember what I did today, still no news of Jessie Good sign we hope Took Mrs Binks down to Dr King went up to Meroogal Mr Thompson & the children were, there. We had a cup of tea & stayed for an hour or so & Tom & Kate came came up home & had tea with us, & enjoyed a ramble round the garden & enjoyed peaches too, I went for a wee drive with them\n\nFriday 13\n\nWent to Uncle Matthews for tea as it was Marys birthday on Saturday but held it on Friday instead had a good game of croquet, a very nice tea, but rather a quiet evening, did not come home until after twelve wished Mary a very happy birthday & many of them little thinking what was going to happen on her birthday\n\nSaturday 14\n\nTrotted round a bit but did not bother myself much worked to keep myself from being over anxious about dear Jessie Uncle Matthews & Mary came up to tea, quite an event for Uncle, he went round the garden & ate nearly all the good fruit then went to practise. Dearest Jess died today but we did not know it\n\nSunday 15\n\nMr Dobbie preached in the morning & I played the organ, & was not a bit nervous, went to Frasers for dinner Mr Dobbie addressed the Sunday School, had a new scholar in my class. Went to Uncle M & Jessie came home with me. Went to hear Mr Par at night & enjoyed the service dear little Teecie was often in my mind the text reminding me \"A little child shall lead them\" How I long to see the dear little man\n\nMonday 16\n\nDid a great clearing up, scalded cockroaches, very tired when Uncle came & told me the sad sad news that dearest Jessie passed away on Saturday night, what were my feelings, dear dear Jess what will we do without her, poor poor Bob, & all her family, it is for her Ma & Bob I feel most, our loss is small compared with theirs & yet ours seems enough to bear. Better for dear Jessie altho we feel it so hard to part with her, she is with Jesus now.\n\nTuesday 17\n\nAuntie M & I went to Nowra to see if there was any news of dear Jessie but there was no more, I did feel it hard to meet Kate & Tom & be able to control myself poor Jessie what a vacant place she has left, how many hearts are aching for her, but she will never have any more heartaches & no more pain, I fancy I see them all together dear Mag & Teecie, dear Winnie & John & dear Jessie, & all those of us who have gone before, what a happy meeting for them, I cannot help longing to be with them. Came home & had tea at Aunties & Mary & I went to the store to see about a dress for me, Mary McGregor came up to Uncle Matthews looking so well, Mary Matthews came home with me & we talked until very late. Mary is very sensible & has deeper thought than I expected. Jim Dick left Sydney today for Scotland poor fellow.\n\nWednesday 18\n\nJessie is so good to get up in the morning making me quite lazy. Mary trotted round & helped me a lot. Dearest Jessie is never out of my mind, & I am anxious about Bob & Ma. & all, I never remember realising with so much comfort that \"Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth\" I feel that He has chastened us in love, oh that we all had that humble submissiveness to His will. Went to Aunties & watched Mary packing for her return to school, then went to the store & did my shopping Kate Fraser came up & had tea with us Went to Binks & they expressed their sympathy deeply grieved for our loss. Sympathy is sweet to the wounded heart\n\nThursday 19\n\nIntended going to Nowra but Grandfather was sick so I stayed at home with Him. Auntie came up after dinner & I made her stay to tea. I feel so lonely & was very glad to have her. After she left I went to Binks & got the paper with the announcement of dear Jessie's death. What a sympathetic woman Mrs Binks is, it is very easy to see who is her master Got a short note from Belle, telling us a little about dear Jessie\n\nFriday 20\n\nCleared up as usual and prepared for Saturday work\n\nSaturday 21\n\nUncle went to the post & bought tomatoes & rhubarb after dinner he went for Tom & Kate how glad I was to have them We had a very nice tea together & after tea Jessie & I went to the Farm & Kate stayed with us, I was very sorry to leave Kate but had to go to Practise When I came home found she was sleeping in the chair We talked very much of dear Jessie Bob & all poor Kate it is hard for her She feels very much for Bob poor fellow it makes my heart sore to think of him\n\nSunday 22\n\nMr Par the new minister for B Creek preached Kate F played the organ, enjoyed the service very much a profatable sermon, all seemed pleased with him.

Had a kind letter from Bessie Matthews I miss dear Jess here & feel her loss very much more than I can tell, there seems such a blank what must it be for Bob when I have felt it hard to live through\n\n[No entries for 29 - 31 January]\n\nFebruary\n\nWednesday Feb 1st\n\nGrandfather went out as I went down to Cambe to do some shopping met Kate Fraser & she made me go home with her to see Lill & Lucy Hodgkinson. I found them the same as usual, had a long chat of old & new times. What pleasure Lil & Lucy seem to go in for, will they ever turn their affections to better things. Had dinner with them & after went over & did my shopping, came back & Kate Fraser & I over to Browns & spent a pleasant little time, Jess came there & had tea there. I had to come home & get tea for Grandfather, & then went to meet Jess. Not sorry that the day was so nearly ended\n\nThursday 2\n\nGrandfather & I went down to Nowra after dinner & met Auntie & Bob. Auntie of course going to Meroogal, poor Bob looks so old & troubled his loss is telling deeply on him, how God must love him, when He has afflicted him so. Yes God does love him, more that dear Jess ever could & He will bind up his wounds & soothe his sorrows & give him strength for every need. Kate made us stay all night & Jess was to go home with Auntie Kate & I went out for a drive, & brought some of dear Jessie things home in the buggy & brought Bob home from the shop. I would like to let him see how deeply I feel for him, & how keenly I too feel Jessies death\n\nFriday 3\n\nKate & I hurried up with our work & brought Grandfather nearly home & then went to see Mrs W Miller found her very glad to see us & very kind, had along starve for dinner after which we started for the orchard & saw a little snake, Kate & I watched it while Mrs Miller got hot & poured it on the horrid thing & scalded it grandly. We talked a great deal of Jessie. We Got some lovely apples & brought some home What comfort Minnie Miller has, I wonder does she know that there is a better home which will always last does she think of it I wonder, I believe she does sometimes. I got home after six & worked till bed time\n\nSaturday 4\n\nUncle Kenny came home from Sydney this morning, a very hot day indeed, had a letter from Geo. Cleaned up the house nicely & in the afternoon did some sewing, after that went to Binks & left the S.School Union cards for Rachel & Martha. I wonder how I will keep up their interest in reading them. No practise tonight, too warm, Jess came home with me.\n\nSunday 5\n\nI went & cooked the dinner for Auntie & let her out to church & I thoroughly enjoyed the morning, reading & looking over the S School lessons & singing hymns. It rained after S School so we could not get down to Nowra to church was very sorry, but God orders all things for us therefore it must be best. Went to bed early & had a good sleep\n\nMonday 6\n\nI entered two cakes for B Creek show. I wonder if I will get a prize Uncle Grandpa & I went to Nowra this morning Kate had an awful lot for dinner. Bell was home from Melb. looking so thin & worn we stayed until evening & Dr Grant came & we had a happy time with him. Grandpa & I came in time to take Jess home. Jess & I unburdened our minds to each other both been misjudged by Uncle Kenny, it has made us more determined to do what we think is right & to be careful of our behaviour in gentlemans company. I am sure we want less than ever to think of them. There is not anything in this world living for but the one thing is to be entirely for Jesus & prepare for the next live where there will not be anything to pain & grieve us. Oh if people only knew how pleasant it is to live for Him. Many more would do so.\n\nTuesday 7\n\nLittle bit lazy this morning have not been well all day tidied up as usual & set to sewing finished my dress and made two aprons. Grandfather made up his mind to start for Pyree. I have not felt this day long it has been a pleasant day to me How I wish I could always have my mind occupied with better things I long to be better & to live entirely for Jesus. I feel that I am progressing slowly but surely I hope. Grandpa Jess & I went to Nowra Uncle & Jess went to Church & Mr Hewlet came up for a walk & took me down to meet them. Jess was sick coming home in the buggy\n\nWednesday 8\n\nIndisposed again this morning & have been all day, Jess good creature that she is got up & lit the fire. I set to work to make my morning wrapper & have succeeded very well so far. Uncle very quiet & a bit done up, had a very silent tea, did my best to get a squeak out of him but he was speechless poor fellow Went to see Auntie after tea found her quite happy over her. work & Uncle as happy as a little king actually trying to sing. Jess bought two melons & we carried one home & oh did'nt we like it & Joe Nugent sent us lollies & figs they were delicious we went to bed after that.\n\nThursday 9\n\nActually got up a little after six & set to work at once & got nearly all my work done before breakfast, did Jessie hair for her felt very sorry that she had to go to the office. Made a seed cake for Auntie after dinner set to work at my gown & nearly finished it, it looks very spry. Its just awful Jess did not come home, & I wanted her badly, guess she wants me too, Its raining nearly cats & dogs, lovely weather for the grass. I wonder how poor Bob is, I sometimes cannot think that dear Jessie has gone from us never to return. Oh what a meeting is before us, when we all cross the river God is good to give us such hope for the future & also the comfort of knowing that our loved ones are asleep in Jesus.\n\nFriday 10\n\nGot on well with my work today & got my wrapper finished & it looks very nice. Went down town & ran into Kate Fraser, met Mrs Binks when coming home going to see a poor woman who is ill & off course Mrs B had her basket full, & she asked me if I would help poor Mrs Walters until she would be able to be about & work, I am glad that she asked me, & felt so ashamed & sorry that I did not enquire about her before & help her oh how humbled I feel when I think of all the good things I have & that poor creature in want oh how unspeakably good God is to me & how little I give Him in return & how little I help others, how I long to live only & always for Jesus, I feel that I must be entirely consecrated to Him. I do want to live entirely for Him.\n\nSaturday 11\n\nRaining all day I am afraid we will have a wet Sunday. Oh how I long to be consecrated entirely to God to give up my will at all times for His will, never to murmur & to be living nearer & nearer to Jesus, I feel that I cannot be satisfied until it is \"all for Jesus\". how good God is to give me such a longing after Him\n\nSunday 12\n\nGot up at 6 oclock so as to have plenty time for reading & prayer. I find it much better not to hurried [sic] I should always try to make more & more time for devotion. Dr Grant preached a very dry sermon Very few out I enjoyed the S School lesson how careless the children often are, as tho they often never heard a word perhaps just when you are most earnest God knows how I do want them to learn about Him & love Him. Went over to Marys after S School enjoyed the quiet & lovely scenery. It makes one think how great our Creator is.\n\nMonday 13\n\nGot up & went over to Aunties in the wet to get butter to make cakes for the show which turned out very well. Poor Jess very bad with Neuralgia, wish I could cure her, Grandfather very merry to day. I enjoyed reading Memorial of F.R. Havergal very, very much while watching the cakes oh to be as earnest as she was such a bright Christian she was the dead yet speaketh. I feel that I must be a real Christian not half & half, I want to be closer to Jesus & more like Him, how I am a very poor Christian doing so very little for Jesus, I want to be All for Jesus, it often comforts me when I think that it is God that gives us these desires, & He never gives a desire without meaning to satisfy it Jess came home early, I got a nice tea ready for her & we had nice melon & Uncle is such good humour I fed that Jess & I are being drawn nearer & nearer to each other\n\nShrove Tuesday 14\n\nUp early as it was washing day Mrs McPaul came early & got to work in good time. I put all the white clothes through 4 or 5 waters & they came out somewhat different to the usual. Got Mrs McPaul to scrub & clean up a bit, Minnie came to stay all night. Had a letter from Tom Stafford Mary ill again, poor thing, Also a very very nice letter from Jim McKenzie really did me good he is I believe a true cousin & friend. Uncle & Jess off to choral practise as usual & poor Jess still bad with Neuralgia. Jess had a letter from Lizzie Kellet & Tory Noakes I went down to Binks, fancy cakes look very nice I am anxious to get the prize want the money to pay my debts. Good night.\n\nAsh Wednesday 15\n\nTired out this evening after a big ironing. Poor Min got her eye hurt down at Noakes (by a dog) she fainted giving us a little turn, but she managed to walk home I was not at all well & nearly managed a faint, thankful I did not though. Took my cakes down to Binks after night. Uncle had a ramble round the Mts getting walking sticks rather done up after it. Had a good sleep. Took powders to cure myself Jess read as Uncle was in his room. How very thankful I feel to God for His great goodness. He is a present help in trouble.\n\nThursday 16\n\nHurried up with the work & took Grandfather to see Mrs Gibson & went on to Nowra myself very hot. Found Kate & Belle at home Kate looking quite tired out poor thing. Belle & I took my dress to the Dressmaker. Came home at about 5 oclock picked Mrs Binks up at Browns. Jess came home but no word of my cakes. Uncle told me about Annie & he & gave me the letter to read in which she confessed she did not care for him, very sorry for Uncle yet I know it is best, Rachel & Martha Binks came up to tell me that I had got first prize for seed cake. Thankful.\n\nFriday 17\n\nUncle & Jess went to the show & Grandfather to the farm & I prepared dinner for Kate & Bell Mr Hollis & Tom. They all managed to come & Nellie too, we spent a pleasant day, Mr Hollis & Tom pelting each other with grapes, & at last we all followed their bad example & did the same. Mr Hollis helped to gather up, & dried the dishes for me. All like him I went home to Nowra with them (Tom walked), we did a little singing in the buggy. Found Uncle & Jess & Bob & Mrs Shepherd at tea. Uncle & Jess went to choral & Kate Mr Hollis & Bob & I went after in the buggy, hardly any there so had only a little practise. Stayed at Nowra all night.\n\nSaturday 18\n\nJess Uncle & I came home from Nowra this morning. I started bravely to work at once & got the place in good order & went to Binks & brought my cakes home,Jess tired & could not walk up here for dinner & me sleepy about 12 when we went to bed last night. Mr Hollis & Tom came up with Auntie & stayed here all night.\n\nSunday 19\n\nWent to hear Mr Par in the morning Text Nahum 3 Verse 1 Chap. Mr Hollis Uncle Jess & I went to Uncle Sams for dinner. Tom came to Sunday School & took a class Oh did'nt I enjoy the lessons today, what a priviledge to be allowed to teach & I so ignorant myself. Mr Dow preached Text 1 Psalm very good & enjoyable. Stayed all night with us. Bob Tom Mr Hollis Mary & Rosy had tea with us\n\nMonday 20\n\nGot up in decent time had an early breakfast Mr Dow went away with Jessie I roasted a fowl & made 4 big cakes for the show busy all day, Uncle ordered the Lords Prayer. Uncle thinks Mr Dow is not a real Christian so I think Uncle & Jess & I went to Nowra & found them all out so we locked up the place & Mr Hollis got in the dining room window, we spent a pleasant evening singing & playing.

I feel very down hearted this evening. I feel that nothing can satisfy me but the one thing needful, I long for more & more love, I long to realise how much God does love me, & want to love Him more & more, how thankful I am that He does not love me for my own sake (but for Jesus sake) because there is not anything in me to love not anything attractive, not anything that would make people love me, oh to be more conformed to His image\n\nThursday 23\n\nMy heart is heavy & humbled as I see how much God has done & is still doing for me, real distress has taken me.

I did not let Belle read Toms letter, she seemed hurt & oh how it pained me, & I did wish so much that I had given it to her, it might have done her good.

I am thankful I did not feel proud but then I cannot take the credit to myself. I cannot keep myself humble, strength must come from the Giver of all good things, I in myself am very weak & helpless & oh so sinful. Went to Ma's & tried to persuade her to go down to Nowra soon. Took a look at Auntie & then came home\n\nWednesday 16\n\nUp early as Auntie Matthews & all of us were going to B Creek.

Oh that we may all be as well prepared as they were. Went to the church, very few there only 6 women Mr English Mr McLay Uncle Kenny & Robert Sheperd were elected as elders what a solemn time it must be for them as they take new responsibilities upon themselves. We got home safely & better for the outing\n\nThursday 17\n\nThis morning Uncle Grandfather & I went to church to Nowra Mr Jackson preached Sunday is the sacrement it makes me feel very serious, Lord Jesus prepare me to sit at Thy table I long for Sunday to come I long for the priviledge of once more communicating & bringing to mind what Jesus has done for us & how He commanded us to Do this in rememberance of Him Lord help me to examine myself I cannot do it myself Mr Jackson implored us to think & ask ourselves if our profession was real if so to hold to it, how earnest & faithfully he preached today, it has been a day of great blessing, a sacred time\n\nFriday 18\n\nJessie did not come home last night Did most of my Saturday work as tomorrow DV we go to church.

I feel that Jesus has prepared me to sit at His table, oh how good He is to me, a poor helpless sinner with no good thing of my own. Mr Osborne text was Peters fall (the three books) the whole service was so helpful & I feel strengthened more for the battle of life, I cannot express the joy of the whole service. Lord prepare me for what thou-art preparing for me. Mr Osborne sermon was so good & refreshing tonight \"choose ye whom ye will serve how faithfully he pleaded to those who had not been with us at the Lords table I felt deeply touched when in his prayer he said Lord answer all our prayers it seemed to help me when I felt so weak\n\nWhit Monday 21\n\nMr Osborne preached the thanksgiving service this morning he has been faithful here, in warning & encouraging. Text \"This is the work of God that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent\" (Faith) what instruction he gave, I can say truly that it has been good to be in the House of God such a sacred sweet season of Communion it has been, never so precious to me. Oh how much we need Jesus to watch over us to strengthen & keep us from evil Lord help me to live entirely for thee & bring all our loved ones to serve thee too. We cannot be too close to Jesus or keep our lamps too brightly burning. I fear mine is a feeble & flickering light. Jesus knows all, He want me & that is surely enough. I could not help thinking & wondering if we would ever see & know Mr Osborne again & then came the thought we will meet him in Heaven, I would like to have told him how much I enjoyed his services, he went away by afternoon coach I went to Ma\n\nWhit Tuesday 22\n\nMa & Pa went to Nowra to day. I wonder how long Ma will stay & what will come of this visit. I have been busy today cooking & so forth, such a white frost this morning.
