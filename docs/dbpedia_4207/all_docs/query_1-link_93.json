Where no certain evidence of a person's birth year has yet been identified, the assumption is that we do not and cannot yet know with sufficient certainty to propose one. Years of birth or death, and sometimes also names and spellings of names, thus sourced and presented here, will often differ more or less substantially from those given (but often merely hazarded) in standard Australian and international bibliographic and biographical records.\n\nThe texts given in gold aim for the most part to be diplomatic transcriptions, wherever practical retaining unaltered the original orthography, and spellings and mis-spellings, of the printed or manuscript sources. Occasionally, however, some spellings are silently corrected (for instance, of unusual music titles and composers, to assist identification), and some orthography, punctuation and paragraphing, and very occasionally also syntax, editorially altered or standardised in the interests of consistency, clarity, and readability.\n\nVAILET, Mons.

In order to show their effect, many of the exhibitors have sent articles of furniture made from these woods to the Exhibition . . . Dr. Valentine, of Campbell Town, exhibits some organ pipes of Huon pine, bored in the solid, with stops, which, having a soft and spongy grain, it is stated are found to yield a softer and more mellow tone than those made of wood. One of the pipes has a stopper, which, upon being removed, the octave above is produced. This Dr. Valentine considers a great novelty, and says relative to it, \"It gives a very soft note, well adapted for the treble half of the stop diapason of a chamber organ\" . . .

The Ven. Archdeacon Davis said that the organ pipes at St. David's had been found faulty from expansion and contraction, according to the hygrometric conditon of the atmosphere, and wished to know what colonial wood would be most suitable for replacing them. Dr. Bedford reminded the meeting that Huon pine organ pipes sent to the London Exhibition of 1851 by Dr. Vallentine, of Campbell Town, had been spoken of in the highest terms.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: James Vautin (member); William Shield (violin maker); William Bedford (member, clergyman); Robert Rowland Davies (member, clergyman)\n\n\"CAMPBELL TOWN\", The Cornwall Chronicle (9 December 1865), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72360433\n\nIt is with deep regret I have to record the destruction of Dr. Valentine's beautiful house by fire last evening. The alarm was given about six o'clock, just as the community were preparing for an Amateur Concert that was to take place in the Grammar School . . . Amongst the effects of Dr. Valentine that was destroyed was a most beautiful organ he has been engaged building in his spare hours for the last eighteen years, and he told the writer this morning, that one half hour would have completed it; in fact it was to have been tuned to-day. It is not quite certain at present how the fire originated. I believe the doctor is to some extent insured.\n\n\"CONCERT AT CAMPBELL TOWN\", The Cornwall Chronicle (14 October 1870), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article67113502\n\nOn Wednesday evening a concert was given in the Campbell Town Grammar School, for the benefit of the Campbell Town Institute. Mr. J. H. Melvyn, assisted by local talent, supplied the entertainment, which was every excellent one as for as it was permitted to proceed. Owing, however, to the conduct of the chairman, Dr. Valentine, the concert was brought to a somewhat abrupt conclusion. The introduction of chairman at concerts is an innovation happily confined to a few country districts of Tasmania, and the sooner it is abandoned the better. When an audience is supplied with programmes an entertainment of the kind can pass off very pleasantly without any interference; the performers and the audience generally managing their own business best. On the present occasion the room was crowded by a very fashionable and numerous. Mr. Melvyn sang \"The Queen's Letter,\" and was loudly encored. The chairman insisted that he could not allow encores; the audience were determined to hear Mr. Melvyn again, and demonstrated their intention in a vociferous manner which prevented any one else from gaining a hearing. Several gentlemen urged the chairman to yield, and at length peace was restored by Mr. Melvyn volunteering to sing, and giving \"My Pretty Jane.\" Afterwards he sung \"Rock me to Sleep Mother,\" and the same uproar for an encore ensued, the audience on this occasion yielding to the chairman's crotchet. In the second part Mr. Melvyn sung \"Happy be thy Dreams;\" again an encore was demanded, but this time Dr. Valentine was very determined. A great uproar ensued; gentlemen from the audience remonstrating with the chairman but in vain. Ultimately the excitement became so great that the ladies grew alarmed and began to retire, and soon the valiant Doctor was left in possession of the field, the concert having broken up. It is no doubt a proper rule in small districts not to allow encores where amateurs only are engaged, as it frequently leads to jealousy, and the breaking up of amateur companies. Where professionals take part, however, the rule may be relaxed with propriety, in deference to the wishes of the audience, and it is to be regretted the chairman did not sec the matter in this light. - Communicated.\n\n\"CAMPBELL TOWN CONCERT.

Your correspondent states, that \"Mr. J. F. Melvyn [sic], assisted by local talent, supplied the entertainment.\" This is simply putting the cart before the horse.

The organ committee consisted of Rev. W. Law, Messrs. A. J. Parker, (Treasurer), S. Joscelyne, A. Birchall, and C. K. Button (Secretary). The plan of the organ was submitted to Rev. W. A. Brooke, Dr. Valentine and Mr. F. A. Packer, who made suggestions thereon. Mr. Joscelyne being an amateur organ builder, and Mr. C. S. Button having a good theoretic knowledge of organs, they were both able to render valuable assistance in preparing plans for Messrs. Bevington and Sons. The organ was tuned by Mr J. D. Redfearn. Captain Barwood was in London when the organ was shipped on board the Philippine, and saw to the cases being placed in a good dry place. The organ was erected by the Messrs. Joscelyne assisted by Mr. C. S. Button, and it has given general satisfaction to all who have heard it. The cost of the instrument has been about £500, and of this sum a portion is yet to be raised, but should the collections to be made on Sunday next prove successful, it is likely the committee will soon have a most satisfactory report to submit to the congregation.\n\nThe proceedings on Tuesday evening were opened by the Rev. Mr. Law, who expressed the hope that after all their endeavors the congregation would be pleased with the new instrument . . . They intended to use the organ as an aid to Divine worship, and not, for their own pleasure; and he thought it would be appropriate for them to open the proceedings by singing a hymn of praise. The hundredth psalm was then given out, and sung to the tune of the \"Old Hundred,\" Mr. T. Sharp accompanying. The following programme was then gone through - Organ solo (improvised), Mr. Sharp; \"Woe unto them\" (Elijah), Miss Sherwin, accompanied by Miss Mason . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Samuel and Walter Joscelyne (organ builders); Frederick Augustus Packer (organist); Thomas Sharp (organist); Amy Sherwin (vocalist)\n\n\"DEATHS\", The Mercury (4 December 1876), 1\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8949614\n\nVALENTINE. - On the 2nd December, at his residence, Campbell Town, William Valentine, Surgeon, aged sixty-eight.

Mr. William Valentine was an Englishman by birth, and became a L.S.A., London, in 1829. Subsequently he held the position of surgeon of the Nottingham Infirmary, where he improved on, and was the first Englishman to successfully apply the French invention for crushing stone in the bladder. At that time, had he removed to London and practised his profession, he might have made a fortune; but unfortunately for his future prospects, he turned his attention to botany, which he studied very zealously, partly because he was fond of the pursuit, and partly because he hoped to obtain the secretaryship of the Linnaean Society. It was not a profitable occupation; however, and in 1839 he was induced by Captain Langdon, who was a very great friend of his in England, to go to Tasmania, and he came out with his family in the Derwent, commanded by Captain Riddell. After living a few months in New Town, he removed to Campbell Town, where he has resided ever since, practising the medical profession. Had he followed that profession with the zeal which he brought to bear in other matters, he might have done well; but he was a man somewhat diversified in his pursuits. Possessing excellent mechanical talents, he spent much time and money in making two organs. The first he did not like; and it was accordingly put on one side; and though more successful with the second, on the very day that he had finished it, it was lost in the fire that destroyed his house in 1864. . . . As one of the most zealous advocates for the discontinuance of transportation, Dr. Valentine's name will long be remembered; while his strong opposition to ritualism and his epistolary warfare with the present Bishop, are fresh in the memory of our readers . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: \"the present bishop\", Charles Bromby\n\n\"THE ORGAN IN THE TOWN HALL,\", Launceston Examiner (21 March 1878), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47784347\n\nThe Messrs. Pollard have removed the organ formerly the property of the late Dr. Valentine, safely from Campbell Town to the Town Hall, not a single mishap having occurred. They are now erecting it on the platform at the northern end of the room, under the conditions entered into with Miss Mason and the Municipal Council. They expect to have it ready for use within a week and the first of the organ recitals will be given shortly afterwards under the conductorship of Herr Carl Schmitt. The instrumont is a fine-toned chamber organ, and was built to the order of the late Dr. Valentine, in 1867, by Mr. J. W. Walker, of London, and is wonderfully compact and comprehensive instrument. It contains two complete manuals, with a compass of fifty-six notes, CC. to G. and an independent pedal organ of 30 notes, CCC. to F. Its range and power may be judged from the following lists -\n\nGreat organ (compass CC. to G. in alto) open diapason, clarabella, keraulophon (tenor C. continued by stopped diapason), principal, stopped flute, twelfth, and fifteenth.\n\nSwell organ (same compass) open diapason (tenor C.) stopped diapason, dulciana (tenor C. continued by stopped diapason), principal, snabe flute, oboe. Pedal organ - Bourbon.\n\nThere are also the following couplers - Swell to great, swell to pedals, great to pedals, and three composition pedals to the great organ, and two to the swell organ.

The arrangements were under the management of a committee of gentlemen with Mr. Sloper, a talented amateur musician, at their head, and several professional and amateur musicians gave their gratuitous services in aid of the desirable object for which the concert was organized, an also a lady who lately arrived in Australia, Signora Valera - who possesses a well cultivated voice - and the announcement of whose debut in Sydney no doubt added to the attractions of the programme . . . Between the first and second parts Signora Valera sung the \"Tacea la notte,\" and the allegro \"Di tale amor,\" from Trovatore, in which she displayed considerable facility of execution. This lady's voice inclines to mezzo-soprano of average range, and it has evidently been cultivated for the florid Italian style. As an encores she gave \"Robert toi que j'aime,\" which further confirmed us that the French or German school is not her forte. In the second part Signora Valera sang \"Una Voce,\" from Il Barbiere, - previously set down in the programme for Mrs. Cordner; this was also very creditably rendered, and on being encored she sang a Spanish cabaletta with characteristic effect, - which amused the audience, as they frequently went off in an eclat di rire. For some reason not satisfactorily explained Signor Cutolo, who had hitherto taken no part in the concert, was requested to accompany Signora Valera, although competent accompanyists - who had been very active in the preliminary arrangements and in the reheareals - were present. The object for which this concert was given precludes extended comment on a proceeding which must have been the cause of annoyance to those gentlemen, as on former occasions they have performed accompaniments to the first artists who have visited Australia.

This lady emerged from the privacy of her domestic relations for the purpose of gratuitously assisting in a charitable object. Entirely unknown here, her appearance resulted in one of the most extraordinary and enthusiastic successes ever known. The audience seemed entranced. Instead of one piece, she sang four. But La Senora di Valero must not be supposed to be a mere amateur, however talented. Connected with a high and noble and, at the same, very musical family of old Spain, she received a musical education from the first masters, in order, as in the case of Piccolomini, to humour her desire for adopting the career of an artist. Subsequent to the tuition in her native land, she received, in Paris, instruction from Duprez, and, in London, from Arditi. Enjoying the friendship of a lady high at the Court of Spain and connected with the Imperial family of France, she was introduced to the notice of the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Eugenie, and had the honour of singing before them at St. Cloud. Engagements having been offered her for her Majesty's Theatre and other opera houses, she would undoubtedly have appeared, but that domestic arrangements prevented her adoption of the stage professionally. Senora di Valero is merely passing through Sydney, having made the transpacific voyage in company with her husband, a gentleman of high standing in one of the learned professions; and the good fortune is thus accorded to a Sydney public to hear this artiste before her return to Europe.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Gilbert Duprez (singing master, Paris); Luigi Arditti (singing master, London)\n\n[Advertisement], The Sydney Morning Herald (17 December 1864), 8\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13102431\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY CONCERT TO SIGNOR CUTOLO . . . at the MASONIC HALL, on MONDAY, December 19th . . .\n\nThe committee have been fortunately enabled to secure the valuable assistance of the following ladies and gentlemen: -\n\nLA SENORA DI VALERA;\n\nLady amateur, pupil of Madame E.

A concert in aid of the funds to procure prizes for the children attending the State school at the Tea Garden Creek took place at Kettle's well-known hostelry, Milawa, on Tuesday, the 14th instant, and its pecuniary aspects were affected thereby. The concert was opened by Herr Schluter playing a fantasia on the pianoforte . . . Mr. J. R. Crone, who came up expressly from Melbourne to give his valuable assistance, was suffering from a severe cold, and was hoarse, but his rendering of \"The Gallants of Englnnd\" was worth a long ride to hear. He was accompanied by Miss Van Den Berg, whose spirited accompaniment was well played . . . Miss Van Den Berg, of Beechworth, sang \" Madoline\"; the words are pretty, and the music by Nelson sympathises with the theme, and the rendering of words and music by the lady were simply charming. The swwet, flexible, young voice, a mezzo-soprano of great beauty enabled the singer to do full justice to the writer and composer . . . Then came, in my opinion, the gem of the evening's entertainment. Miss Vandenberg gave the evergreen and everloved \"Last Rose of Summer.\" The artistic execution merited high commendation, and received it; but the sympathetic and intelligent rendering of the feeling of the words, and their musical expression, called to mind days long passed away, when Anna Reviere, better known as Madame Bishop, delighted her hearers in London drawing-rooms and concerts. Should Miss Vandenburg makes music her profession, I am certain that a bright career would await her. Her well-known desire to aid by her talents in all benevolent objects has endeared her already to many friends; and when her vocal and instrumental gifts are still further improved by time and culture, she will win, I am sure, not only golden opinions, but also the loss transitory possession of golden harvests. That she may reap them often and plenteously is, I know, the desire of many who had the pleasure of hearing her for the first time on Tuesday last. All the bouquets in the room were thrown on the stage in recognition of the approbation of her singing, but an encore was not insisted upon, as the audience [5] were aware that they would again have the pleasure of hearing her during the evening . . .\n\n\"MARRIAGE\", Ovens and Murray Advertiser (3 August 1878), 4\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article199694047\n\nTURNER - VANDENBERG - On the 1st instant, at the residence of the bride's mother, Beechworth, by the Rev.

Varley is really clever, and itmust have been most disheartening to him to go through his most exquisite drolleries to empty benches. We are not aware whether Mr. Varley will again test the taste and the pocket of Goelongites by repeating his entertainment; if he do not, then the public have lost a treat. Varley's personation of the \"Veway Wefined young gentleman in winglets\" was exquisite; the French Shoeblack is a character never to be forgotten, and the simpering Miss Aribella Brown with her \"well, I don't mind telling YOU you know,\" irresistibly ludicrous. Varley is the best Ventriloquest that has ever visited Geelong; and we can only account for the poor attendance by supposing that his merits were not known.

The gorgeous power and luscious richness of sweet voices now resound through out this spacious edifice. The artistes on their appearance were warmly welcomed, and, encouraged by the plaudits of a house crowded to excess, the performance became a brilliant triumph. The powerful music of Verdi is difficult of comprehension to English voices; but, nevertheless, so popular has the melodious Trovatore proved, that Mr. Charles Poole could not resist the temptation of bringing it out on his opening night. The band, led on by Lavenu, was excellent, the choruses good, and not distinguished by that loud shouting which many of our choruses are, the leading vocalists winning fresh laurels in their respective roles . . .

A year later, November 1850, Varley was manager for the famous Distin family concert troupe, and in February the following year he married Louisa Distin, daughter of John Distin (1794-1863). Louisa was also a cousin of Charlotte Loder, wife and widow of Alfred Loder (died Prahran, VIC, February 1853), and sister-in-law of George Loder.\n\nThe Varleys probably first arrived in Melbourne, around the same time as John and Marua Winterbottom, who landed from the Moselle in December 1852. Louisa duly arrived in Sydney with the Wintebottoms on the steamer Shamrock from Melbourne on 4 April 1853. Nugent having perahps sailed separately, on 6 April he advertised for local Sydney musicians to join Wintbottom's band.\n\nOn 9 April he advertised for \"two carpenters, to erect a large orchestra\". These same fittings were put up for sale in June, and by August Varley, Winterbotttom, and at least some of his Sydney band had arrived in Melbourne.\n\nAfter August 1853, there is no further documented reference to Varley as Winterbottom's manager, and by 1856, and perhaps much earlier, the Varleys had settled in the central Victorian goldfields, where for the next 20 years they were general storekeepers.\n\nTheir daughter was the operetta vocalist Violet Varley (Mrs. Joseph Tapley). Violet was touring in juvenile roles as early as 1883, and was later a pupil of Lucy Chambers.\n\nShe died in 1895, barely in her mid 20. The Melbourne musician Walter J. Turner composed a song The passing show in Violet's memory (published by W. H. Glen, NO COPY IDENTIFIED).\n\nDocumentation:\n\nBaptisms solemnized in the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, in the month of January & February 1832; register 1816-33, folio 533; London Metropolitan Archives\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com.au/imageviewer/collections/61866/images/61865_314054001181_17924-00542 (PAYWALL)\n\nJanuary 14 / Louisa Rose / [daughter of] John & Matilda / Distin / Gillingham Street / [born] 12 Dec. 1831 / Professor of Music . . .\n\n[Notice], The London gazette (16 November 1849), 3457\n\nhttps://books.google.com.au/books?id=sxhKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA3457 (DIGITISED)\n\nNotice is hereby given, that the Partnership, if any such existed or can be considered to have existed between us the undersigned, John Taylor and Nugent Varley, in the business of Musicsellers, carried on at No. 10, Opera-arcade, Pall Mall, in the county of Middlesex, was dissolved by mutual consent on the 23rd day of September last. - As witness our hands this 9th day of November 1849.\n\nNugent Varley.
