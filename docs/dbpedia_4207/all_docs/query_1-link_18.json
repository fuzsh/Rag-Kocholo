        "text": "Elton John (born March 25, 1947) is an English vocalist, pianist, songwriter, and philanthropist with a career stretching back to the mid-1960s. He achieved global stardom with his self-titled second album in 1970. Since that time, he has recorded more than 30 albums and scored numerous hits that have gained evergreen status around the world.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJohn was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on March 25, 1947, in Pinner, Middlesex, England. His father, a Royal Air Force flight lieutenant, was a trumpeter in the Bob Millar Band, which played military dances. The Dwight’s were avid record buyers, raising Reginald on the popular music of the day. He knew he wanted to be a musician after hearing the early rock n’ roll hits of Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nDwight took up piano as a small child, leaning to play pieces like Waldteufel’s “The Skater’s Waltz” by ear. He started taking formal piano lessons at age seven. By age 11, he won a junior scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. According to one professor, Dwight recited the entirety of a lengthy Handel piece after hearing it once.[1] He attended the academy for five years, singing in the Saturday choir and mastering the works of Frédéric Chopin and Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nThe Dwight’s divorced when Reginald was 14. He moved with his mother and her new husband into a flat on Frome Court, where he remained until he hit paydirt in the states. Around this time, he got a four-nights-weekly pianist residency at the Northwood Hills Hotel. Though normal-sighted, he started wearing horn-rimmed glasses in emulation of Buddy Holly.\n\nBluesology\n\nIn 1962, Dwight formed Bluesology with his neighbor, guitarist Stewart “Stu” Brown. After some months on the local pub circuit, they scored a weekly residency at London’s Establishment Club with a setlist comprised of blues standards by Muddy Waters, Jimmy Witherspoon, and Memphis Slim.\n\nIn 1965, Bluesology signed with an agency that sent them on tour as the UK backing band for visiting American acts, including The Isley Brothers, Doris Troy, Billy Stewart, and Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles. In July, Bluesology debuted with the Dwight original “Come Back, Baby” (b/w the Witherspoon cover “Times Getting Tougher Than Tough”), followed in November with the Dwight original “Mr. Frantic” (b/w the Slim cover “Everyday (I Have the Blues)”). Both singles appeared on Fontana; the second features an uncredited early appearance by guitarist Bernie Holland, who later surfaced in Jody Grind, Stealers Wheel, and Hummingbird.\n\nBluesology expanded to a brass-integrated sextet for a German tour behind American soulster Major Lance. In late 1966, they linked with English blues singer Long John Baldry. Dwight and Brown were the only original members in a lineup that now included (future Soft Machine) saxophonist Elton Dean and (future Juicy Lucy) guitarist Neil Hubbard.\n\nIn May 1967, Dwight deputized Simon Dupree & the Big Sound keyboardist Eric Hine on two dates in Scotland. In October, Bluesology signed to Polydor (as Stu Brown & Bluesology) for their third single: “Since I Found You Baby,” a brassy mid-tempo soul-pop number by veteran English entertainer Kenny Lynch, who co-wrote the b-side (“Just a Little Bit”) with American songwriter Mort Shuman.\n\nIn late 1967, Dwight left Bluesology and pursued a songwriting career. He answered an ad in the New Musical Express placed by Liberty records A&R Ray Williams, who introduced Dwight to another respondent, lyricist Bernie Taupin. Dwight and Taupin began a songwriting partnership that would span more than fifty years. Their first completed song was the September 1967 demo “Scarecrow.” Later that year, Dwight adopted the professional name Elton John, derived from his ex-bandmates Elton Dean and Long John Baldry.\n\n1968\n\nIn 1968, Elton John and Bernie Taupin became staff writers for Dick James Music (DJM), a publishing company established by English music mogul Dick James (1920–1986). At DJM, John–Taupin wrote songs for assorted pop performers, including Scottish singer Lulu, who recorded their composition “I Can’t Go On (Living Without You),” the sixth runner-up to the UK entry in the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAs a sessionist, John plays piano on “An Olympic Record,” a 1968 Columbia a-side by pop parodists The Barron Knights. He sings backing vocals on one side (“Lily the Pink”) by Scaffold, a folk-comedy trio with Mike McGear (aka Peter McCartney, the younger brother of Paul McCartney). Elton plays and sings backup on “Delilah,” a 1968 global chart-topper by Tom Jones.\n\nRegimental Sgt Zippo\n\nBetween November 1967 and May 1968, John recorded his first round of Taupin co-writes at Dick James Studios in London. The intended album — shelved in favor of his proper debut Empty Sky — appeared fifty-three years after its completion as Regimental Sgt Zippo. It contains twelve psych-tinged originals: ten John–Taupin numbers and two (“Sitting Doing Nothing,” “You’ll Be Sorry to See Me Go”) co-written by DJM session guitarist Caleb Quaye, a late-period Bluesology member who recently cut the Philips psych single “Baby Your Phrasing Is Bad” (b/w “A Woman of Distinction”).\n\n“When I Was Tealby Abbey” (2:35)\n\n“And the Clock Goes Round” (3:06)\n\n“Sitting Doing Nothing” (2:30)\n\n“Turn to Me” (3:16)\n\n“Angel Tree” (2:04)\n\n“Regimental Sgt. Zippo” (4:44)\n\n“A Dandelion Dies in the Wind” (3:14)\n\n“You’ll Be Sorry to See Me Go” (2:34)\n\n“Nina” (3:50)\n\n“Tartan Coloured Lady” (4:09)\n\n“Hourglass” (2:44)\n\n“Watching the Planes Go By” (4:07)\n\nElton plays organ and piano (grand and electric), plus harpsichord on Regimental Sgt Zippo, which features Quaye on acoustic and electric guitars, flute, percussion, and backing vocals. Two recent members of psychsters The Mirage — bassist Dee Murray (a brief Spencer Davis Group player) and drummer Dave Hynes — round out Elton’s studio band.\n\nQuaye produced the songs, which feature select backing by the Paul Fenoulhet Orchestra, conducted by Fenoulhet (1906–1979) of the WWII-era Skyrockets Dance Orchestra. The engineer, Frank Owen, worked beforehand with the Isle of Wight Cherokees, a precursor to Aubrey Small. Zack Laurence, a veteran Parlophone jazz-pop composer, handles orchestral arrangements.\n\nRegimental Sgt Zippo appeared in 2021 in a vintage psychedelic sleeve that depicts young Elton from multiple angles, engulfed in swirls and enhanced with three colors: mustard, magenta, and turquoise.\n\n“I’ve Been Loving You”\n\nIn March 1968, John released his debut solo single, “I’ve Been Loving You,” a Taupin co-credited number backed with the Elton lone-write “Here’s to the Next Time.” Quaye produced the single, which appeared in limited quantity on Philips (UK only). Despite the label info, Elton lone-wrote “I’ve Been Loving You.” All subsequent originals (through 1976) are genuine John–Taupin compositions.\n\nIn Portugal, Philips issued “I’ve Been Loving You” as a maxi-single with one track from the Sgt Zippo sessions (“Angel Tree”) and the 1968 Dick James demo “Thank You For All Your Loving.”\n\n1969\n\nIn February 1969, Decca Records issued a single by the Bead and Beer Band titled “Dick Barton Theme (The Devil’s Gallop),” a cover of the 1946 theme by British composer Charles Williams to the BBC Light Programme serial Dick Barton – Special Agent. The Bread and Beer Band was a studio project by Elton, Caleb Quaye, and Hollies bassist Bernie Calvert. They wrote the b-side, “Breakdown Blues,” with one Lennox Jackson.\n\nJohn continued as a sessionist with piano credits on 1969 singles by Scaffold (“Gin Gan Goolie”) and Family Dogg (“A Way of Life”). He sings backing vocals on both sides of the November CBS release “Good To Be Alive” (“Same Old Story”), the third single by fifteen-year-old singer Tina Charles, a future UK disco-pop star.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon Dupree & the Big Sound covered the John–Taupin number “I’m Going Home.” John plays piano on “Give It All Back,” the b-side of the November 1969 Parlophone single “The Eagle Flies Tonight,” the final Big Sound release. Upon their breakup, Big Sound leaders the Shulman brothers considered John as a possible keyboardist–singer for their new band, Gentle Giant, but they revoked the invitation after they heard his debut album.\n\nElton made his second appearance on a global hit with “He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother,” the September 1969 standalone single by The Hollies. He sings and plays piano on the gospel-tinged ballad, which reached No. 3 in the UK and Irish singles charts and No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100. John also plays on the September 1969 DJM single “Mr. Boyd” (b/w “Imagine”) by Argosy, the starting vehicle of musician–singer Roger Hodgson, the soon-to-be co-frontman of Supertramp.\n\n“Lady Samantha”\n\nIn January 1969, John issued his second Philips single, “Lady Samantha” (b/w “All Across the Havens”). Both sides were recorded the prior month at DJM Studios and produced by Steve Brown. The songs were performed during Elton’s first BBC Radio broadcast (10/28/68) but soon dropped from his setlist.\n\nElton is backed on “Lady Samantha” by Quaye, bassist Tony Murray, and drummer Roger Pope. Murray played concurrently in Plastic Penny, a pop-psych band that made two 1968–69 albums on Page One. Their second (Currency) contains a cover of the unheard Sgt Zippo number “Turn to Me.”\n\n“It’s Me That You Need”\n\nOn May 16, 1969, Elton released his third single, “It’s Me That You Need,” a swelling John–Taupin ballad backed with the mid-tempo rustic rocker “Just Like Strange Rain.”\n\nJohn recorded both sides with Brown in April at Olympic Studios. He’s backed on the single by Quaye, Pope, and DJM studio engineer Clive Franks, who plays bass on “It’s Me That You Need,” which features strings conducted by Cy Payne, an arranger on recent recordings by The Idle Race, Kate, The Barrier, and select North American acts (Harper and Rowe, The Guess Who).\n\nThis was the fifth release on DJM Records (DJS 205), which issued the single in the UK and Italy. Elsewhere, “It’s Me That You Need” appeared on Fontana (France) and Philips (Singapoe).\n\nIn 1971, DJM issued “It’s Me That You Need” in Japan, where it reached No. 2 on the Oricon International Singles Chart.\n\nEmpty Sky\n\nElton John released his debut album, Empty Sky, on June 6, 1969, on DJM. It features nine John–Taupin originals, including “Hymn 2000,” “Western Ford Gateway,” “Skyline Pigeon,” and “Val-Hala.” The album opens with the titular “Empty Sky,” his second-longest studio original. Empty Sky closes with the lengthy three-part medley “Gulliver – Hay Chewed – Reprise.”\n\n1. “Empty Sky” (8:29)\n\n2. “Val-Hala” (4:11)\n\n3. “Western Ford Gateway” (3:15)\n\n4. “Hymn 2000” (4:29)\n\n1. “Lady What’s Tomorrow” (3:09)\n\n2. “Sails” (3:45)\n\n3. “The Scaffold” (3:18)\n\n4. “Skyline Pigeon” (3:37)\n\n5. “Gulliver – Hay Chewed – Reprise” (6:58)\n\nSessions took place between November 1968 and April 1969 at Dick James Studios. Elton plays Hohner Pianet and harpsichord in addition to piano and organ on Empty Sky, which features Quaye, Pope, and Murray. Quaye and Pope recently formed the band Hookfoot with fellow DJM sessionists but their first-recorded album (A Piece of Pye) wound up shelved for four decades.\n\nOne track (“Lady What’s Tomorrow”) features Murray’s Plastic Penny bandmate, drummer Nigel Olsson. Select passages feature saxophonist Don Fay, a recent backer of bluesman Errol Dixon. Harpist Graham Vickery of Pye blues-rockers Shakey Vick also appears on the album.\n\nDJM music coordinator Steve Brown produced Empty Sky, which Frank Owen engineered in sequence with As I Am, the singular solo album by Troggs guitarist Chris Britton. Clive Franks, the tape operator on Empty Sky, is credited with “whistling.”\n\nEmpty Sky is housed in a gatefold designed by Dave Larkham. The front depicts a line-enhanced blue-scale Elton against a cloudy backdrop. The inner-gates have light blue-scale images of him and Bernie behind a wall of lyrics. The back has white text on purple with credits and liner notes by Tony Brandon and David Symonds (both pictured). Symonds writes that Elton “does not confine himself to the brighter side of life. The runcible has since changed to the smouldering crucible of a million injustices.” (Runcible is a nonsense word invented by English Victorian author Edward Lear as a whimsical adjective for objects.)\n\nEmpty Sky first appeared in the UK and South Africa. DJM later issued the album in Japan (1970), Oceania and Italy (1972), and Germany and Mexico (1975). In the US, Empty Sky remained unavailable until January 1975 when MCA released to capitalize on Elton’s transatlantic stardom.\n\n1970\n\nElton John formed his first backing band with Olsson and Dee Murray. He performed his first show as Elton John on March 25, 1970, at the Revolution Club, a rock hotspot in Bruton Place, Mayfair, in central London. On April 7, he played the Roundhouse, a converted railway shed in Chalk Farm that ushered London’s psychedelic boom.\n\nAs a sessionist, Elton backed Tom Jones on the singer’s 1970 cover of “I Who Have Nothing,” a 1963 Leiber–Stoller song first recorded by Ben E. King. He also plays on the 1970 DJM single “Have You Seen Your Savior” (b/w “White Line Road”) by Scottish posters My Dear Watson. He appears on one track (“Just a Day”) on the 1970 Vertigo release From Home to Home by Fairfield Parlour, a folk-psyh mutation of Kaleidoscope. Elton also earned two 1970 credits behind The Hollies: their March 1970 a-side “I Can’t Tell the Bottom From the Top” and one track (“Perfect Lady Housewife”) on their November Parlophone release Confessions of the Mind (issued stateside as Moving Finger).\n\nElton sings “From Denver to L.A,” a co-write between Hal Shaper and French film composer Francis Lai for the 1970 British sports drama The Games starring Michael Crawford and Ryan O’Neal. American small-press Viking issued the song as a mono / stereo promo single with the singer credited as ‘Elton Johns.’\n\nIsland Records initially booked Elton as a vocalist on the winter–spring 1970 sessions for In the Wake of Poseidon, the second album by King Crimson. However, KC bandleader Robert Fripp nixed the proposal.\n\nElton John\n\nElton John released his self-titled second album on April 10, 1970, on DJM (UK) and Uni (US). It features ten John–Taupin originals, including “The King Must Die,” “The Greatest Discovery,” “First Episode at Hienton,” “Take Me to the Pilot,” the much-covered “Border Song” and the singer’s international breakthrough hit “Your Song.”\n\n1. “Your Song” (4:04)\n\n2. “I Need You to Turn To” (2:32)\n\n3. “Take Me to the Pilot” (3:46)\n\n4. “No Shoe Strings on Louise” (3:31)\n\n5. “First Episode at Hienton” (4:48)\n\n6. “Sixty Years On” (4:35)\n\n7. “Border Song” (3:22)\n\n8. “The Greatest Discovery” (4:12)\n\n9. “The Cage” (3:28)\n\n10. “The King Must Die” (5:21)\n\nElton John is the singer’s first of fourteen albums produced by Gus Dudgeon. Trident staffer Robin Geoffrey Cable engineered this and Elton’s subsequent three albums. This also marks Elton’s first of nine pairings with string conductor Paul Buckmaster, who recently arranged singles by Locomotive and David Bowie (“Space Oddity”). Buckmaster himself performs the cello solo on “The Greatest Discovery.” Steve Brown reappears as ‘production coordinator.’\n\nElton plays harpsichord on “I Need You to Turn To” and piano throughout the album, which also features organist Brian Dee (“Sixty Years On,” “Border Song”) and Moog synthesizer by Buckmaster’s wife Diana Lewis (“First Episode at Hienton,” “The Cage”).\n\nFour songs (“Take Me to the Pilot,” “No Shoe Strings on Louise,” “Border Song,” “The Cage”) feature a six-piece studio choir with members of Blue Mink (Madeline Bell, Roger Cook), Edison Lighthouse (Tony Burrows), The Ladybirds (Kay Garner), and singer–songwriters Lesley Duncan and Tony Hazzard.\n\nElton John features five guitarists: mainly Clive Hicks (six tracks) and Quaye (four), plus Colin Green (Spanish guitar on “Sixty Years On”), Roland Harker (“I Need You to Turn To”), and Rumplestiltskin member Alan Parker (“Take Me to the Pilot”). Clark, Green, and Hicks all play on “You’re Song.” Colin, Kay, and Belle would all partake in the 1972 Rediffusion project The Seven Ages of Man.\n\nThe album has three bassists: Dave Richmond (“You’re Song,” “Border Song,” “The Greatest Discovery”), Alan Weighall (“Take Me to the Pilot,” “No Shoe Strings on Louise,” “The Cage”), and Les Hurdle (“The King Must Die”). Richmond, a founding member of Manfred Mann, also plays on 1969–70 albums by Scott Walker and Bread Love and Dreams (Strange Tale of Captain Shannon and the Hunchback from Gigha).\n\nBlue Mink’s Barry Morgan drums on five tracks; Pentangle‘s Terry Cox drums on “The Greatest Discovery” and “The King Must Die.” Harpist Skaila Kanga, a sessionist on James Taylor’s first album, plays on “I Need You to Turn To” and “The Greatest Discovery.”\n\nOriginal UK copies of Elton John are housed in a matte, textured gatefold sleeve designed by Larkham with photography by Stowell Stanford. It shows Elton’s shaded, half-visible profile (front), a lyric spread with titles in pink Blackletter font (inner-gates), and a side-to-side photo of the core creative team (Lewis, Buckmaster, John, Taupin, Dudgeon, Quaye, Brown).\n\nDJM lifted “Border Song” as an advance single on March 20, 1970, backed with the non-album “Bad Side of the Moon.” Elton mimed “Border Song” on the April 2 broadcast of the BBC music program Top of the Pops, which aired it amid current hits by Juicy Lucy (“Who Do You Love?”), Slade (“Shape of Things”), Tom & Dusty Springfield (“Morning Please Don’t Come”), and Rufus Thomas (“Do the Funky Chicken”).\n\n“Border Song” first appeared in the US on the Congress label and reappeared in July on Uni. It cracked the Billboard Hot 100 at 92. In Canada, the song reached No. 35. Aretha Franklin covered the song as an October 1970 Atlantic a-side (parenthetically subtitled “Holy Moses”). Her version reached No. 23 on the Cashbox Top 100 and reappeared on her 1972 album Young, Gifted and Black. The 5th Dimension cover “Border Song” on their 1972 album Individually & Collectively. Solomon Burke combines “Your Song,” “Border Song,” and “Take Me to the Pilot” in a short medley (3:17) titled “Three Psalms of Elton” on his 1971 MGM release Electronic Magnetism.\n\nToe Fat cover “Bad Side of the Moon” on their 1970 second album Toe Fat Two. Canadian rockers April Wine cover the song on their 1972 second album On Record.\n\nElton promoted the album with an April 21 appearance at Pop Proms 1970, a week-long concert series hosted by Radio One DJ John Peel with sets by Bronco, Fleetwood Mac, Fotheringay, Ginger Baker’s Air Force, If, Jody Grind, Mighty Baby, Mott the Hoople, Quintessence, and Traffic. John played on Day 2 (Tuesday) along with T. Rex and The Pretty Things. He played four documented May UK shows and had the June 5 headline slot at London’s Marquee Club.\n\nElton John peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart. It also reached No. 4 in Canada and No. 2 in Australia and Denmark.\n\n“Rock and Roll Madonna”\n\nOn June 19, Elton John released the non-album single “Rock and Roll Madonna,” a 12-bar guitar–piano boogie. Quaye, Pope, and Hookfoot bassist Dave Glover play on the track. The b-side, “Grey Seal,” is a mid-tempo ballad with sparse piano–vocal verses and a swelling, orchestrated chorus.\n\n“Rock and Roll Madonna” remained a non-album track outside of Germany, where Hansa placed it as the opening track on Elton John in lieu of “I Need You to Turn To.”\n\nIn 1973, Elton rerecorded “Grey Seal” for his seventh album. This version appears on his 1974 UK rarities comp Lady Samantha.\n\nOn June 19, 1970, Elton played his first show abroad at Mantorp’s Racing Circuit in Östergötland, Sweden. On Sunday the 21st, he held his second Roundhouse engagement, followed by a June 26 show at St. Mary’s College in Twickenham. On July 11, he played Knokke Casino in Knokke, Belgium.\n\nOn August 14, Elton played an extended set at the Yorkshire Folk Blues and Jazz Festival, a shambolic three-day hillside event in Krumlin, Barkisland, with sets by Fairport Convention, Groundhogs, Ralph McTell, and Fotheringay. Elton played Day 1 (Friday), which also featured Amazing Blondel, Atomic Rooster, The Humblebums, Manfred Mann Chapter Three, and headliners The Pretty Things. (The intended Saturday headliner, Pink Floyd, didn’t appear due to bad weather, which forced the festival’s organizers to cancel Sunday’s shows.)\n\nFirst US Show\n\nOn August 25, 1970, Elton John made his US debut at the Troubadour on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, where he held a six-night engagement, supported by singer–songwriter David Ackles.\n\nOn the first night, Elton floored the audience with an energized set that included numbers from his self-titled album and a cover of the Rolling Stones recent rocker “Honky Tonk Women.” He performed in a piano power-trio setting with the Olsson–Murray rhythm section; no guitarist. They ended the set with a twenty-minute version of the yet-unreleased John–Taupin original “Burn Down the Mission.”\n\nRock photojournalist Ed Caraeff — who caught the famed guitar-burning image of Jimi Hendrix at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival — captured Elton’s flying stage routine. Between shows, Elton visited the Disneyland Resort in nearby Anaheim and returned with Mickey Mouse ears that he wore on stage at subsequent shows. His newfound flamboyance stunned Olsson and Murray, who knew Elton as the subdued singer–songwriter at Dick James Studios. Audiences, likewise, were shocked by the raw energy of his performances and the contrast between his stripped live arrangements and orchestrated studio recordings.\n\nAfter the Aug. 25–30 LA engagement, Elton played six straight nights (Sept. 1–6) at the Troubadour North in San Francisco. On September 10, he made his first appearance in New York City at the Playboy Club. On Sept. 11–12, he played the Electric Factory in Philadelphia.\n\nElton, now the conquering hero, played an October 2 homecoming show at London’s Royal Albert Hall, supported by Sandy Denny and her band Fotheringay.\n\n“Your Song”\n\nOn October 26, 1970, Uni Records issued “Take Me to the Pilot” as Elton John’s third proper US single. However, DJs favored the b-side, “Your Song,” which caught on with listeners and prompted Uni to flip sides. With its earnest delivery, universal message, gripping bridge (“I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind, that I put down in words”), and heartfelt refrain (“how wonderful life is when you’re in the world”), “Your Song” became his stateside breakthrough hit. It reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox Top 100 and No. 9 on the US Adult Contemporary chart. The song’s success lifted its seven-month-old parent album, Elton John, to No. 4 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn Canada, “Your Song” reached No. 3 on the RPM Top Singles chart and No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nTumbleweed Connection\n\nElton John released his third album, Tumbleweed Connection, on October 30, 1970, on DJM and Uni. It contains nine John–Taupin originals and “Love Song,” which Elton co-wrote with Lesley Duncan. Each side closes with a lengthy epic number: “My Father’s Gun” and “Burn Down the Mission.” Musically and lyrically, the songs invoke Old West themes.\n\n1. “Ballad of a Well-Known Gun” (4:59)\n\n2. “Come Down in Time” (3:25)\n\n3. “Country Comfort” (5:06) Rod Stewart covers this song on his June 1970 second album Gasoline Alley, released four months ahead of Tumbleweed.\n\n4. “Son of Your Father” (3:48) Spooky Tooth cover this song on their July 1970 fourth album The Last Puff, released three months before Tumbleweed.\n\n5. “My Father’s Gun” (6:20)\n\n6. “Where to Now St. Peter?” (4:11)\n\n7. “Love Song” (3:41)\n\n8. “Amoreena” (5:00)\n\n9. “Talking Old Soldiers” (4:06)\n\n10. “Burn Down the Mission” (6:21)\n\nbonus 11. “Into the Old Man’s Shoes”\n\nSessions took place in March 1970 at Trident, where Dudgeon produced the album in sequence with titles by Magna Carta and Michael Chapman. This is Elton’s second album engineered by Geoffrey Cable, who worked on concurrent titles by Affinity (self-titled), Andwella, Genesis (Trespass), Harvey Andrews, Jade, and Van der Graaf Generator (The Least We Can Do, H to He).\n\n“Country Comfort” features steel guitarist Gordon Huntley (Forest, Gospel Oak), violinist Johnny Van Derek, and Blue Mink drummer Barry Morgan, who also plays on “Come Down In Time” alongside reedist Karl Jenkins (Soft Machine). Leslie Duncan and Blue Mink singer Madeline Bell sing backing vocals on “Son of Your Father,” “Ballad of a Well Known Gun,” and “My Father’s Gun.” The latter two also feature Tony Hazzard and Dusty Springfield on backing vocals.\n\nTumbleweed Connection is housed in a gatefold sleeve with photography by Ian Digby-Ovens and Barrie Wentzell. It presents Elton and Bernie in sepia-tinged Old West settings on the outer-gates (outside a saloon) and inner-gates (inside a steam train). The location used for the period imagery is Sheffield Park, a railway station in Fletching, East Sussex, built in 1882.\n\nThe Tumbleweed inner-gate contains a twelve-page booklet with lyrics, credits, and photos of the album’s players: Olsson, Murray, and Hookfoot (Quaye, Glover, Pope, and harpist Ian Duck), plus Buckmaster, Dudgeon, Geoffrey Cable, and Leslie Duncan. Wentzell’s photography also appears on 1970 album covers for Forever More, Jody Grind (Far Canal), Tin Tin (self-titled), Trapeze, and Yes (Time and a Word).\n\nElton released no singles from Tumbleweed Connection in the Northern Hemisphere because he wanted the songs to be heard in the album’s context. However, DJM lifted “Country Comfort” as a single in Oceania (b/w “Love Song”).\n\nTumbleweed Connection reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 5 on the Billboard 200. It peaked at No. 4 in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands. In 1995, Mercury reissued the album with two bonus tracks: “Into the Old Man’s Shoes” and an early version of “Madman Across the Water,” recorded with guitarist Mick Ronson, a member of Bowie’s backing band Hype, which morphed into the Spiders from Mars.\n\nElton flew back to the states for a sixteen-city tour, starting with an Oct. 29–31 engagement at the Boston Tea Party with brass-rockers Dreams (with drummer Billy Cobham and the Brecker Brothers). In San Francisco, he opened for The Kinks on a three-night stand (Nov. 12–14) at the Fillmore Auditorium. On November 17, he played a set at Manhattan’s A&R Recording Studios for a live radio broadcast on WABC-FM. On Nov. 27–28, he headlined a multi-act bill with Catfish and Uriah Heep at Detroit’s Eastown Theatre.\n\nElton John rounded out 1970 with a Dec. 20 show at London’s Roundhouse. He found a manager in 21-year-old EMI promoter John Reid, who met Elton at a Christmas Motown party.\n\nSister duo Birds of a Feather (aka the Chanter Sisters) cover “Country Comforts” on thir 1970 self-titled album, which also contains covers of “Border Song,” “Take Me to the Pilot,” and an Elton-backed version of “Bad Side of the Moon.”\n\n1971\n\nIn January 1971, DJM issued “Your Song” in the UK in Europe. It reached No. 4 in the Netherlands, and went Top 10 in Ireland (No. 10) and Belgium (No. 16). In Oceania, “Your Song” reached No. 11 in Australia and No. 18 in New Zealand. In the UK, it reached No. 7 and rocketed him to superstar status.\n\nTotP aired “Your Song” on its New Year’s Eve 1970 broadcast along with a new song, “Can I Put You On,” from an upcoming soundtrack. They reaired it on Jan. 14 and Feb. 4 amid current hits by Ashton Gardner & Dyke (“Resurrection Shuffle”), Badfinger (“No Matter What”), Cat Stevens (“Moonshadow”), Labi Siffre (“Make My Day”), The Supremes (“Stoned Love”), and The Who (“I Don’t Even Know Myself”).\n\nElton John played twenty-two UK shows between Jan. 2 and March 3, 1971, including a set at the Lanchester Arts Festival, a Feb. 5 event at Lanchester Polytechnic with sets by Caravan, Climax Blues Band, Curved Air, Indian Summer, Mr. Fox, Osibisa, and Strawbs.\n\nAt IBC Studios, John produced Side Two of It Ain’t Easy, the first of two albums on Warner Bros. by ex-Bluesology singer Long John Baldry. Side One was produced by Rod Stewart, Baldry’s co-singer in the earlier combos Steampacket and the Hoochie Coochie Men. The album contains covers of the Faces (“Flying”), Lesley Duncan (“Mr. Rubin”), Randy Newman (“Let’s Burn Down The Cornfield”), and an early cover of “It Ain’t Easy,” a 1970 song by American singer–songwriter Ron Davies (popularized by David Bowie on his 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars). Warner lifted Baldry’s recording of the otherwise unissued John–Taupin song “Rock Me When He’s Gone” as the album’s single.\n\nElton also plays piano on two cuts (“Help Me Jesus,” “Mr. Rubin”) on the 1971 CBS release Sing Children Sing, the debut album by Lesley Duncan. It contains her version of their co-write “Love Song.” John also plays on a 1971 version of “Skyline Pigeon” by Australian singer and former Seekers frontwoman Judith Durham, who covers the song on her 1971 A&M release Climb Ev’ry Mountain.\n\nFriends\n\nOn March 5, 1971, Paramount Records issued Friends, Elton John’s soundtrack to the namesake British-French teen-romance film by director Lewis Gilbert (Alfie, The Spy Who Loved Me, Educating Rita). It features five John–Taupin numbers (“Friends,” “Honey Roll,” “Seasons,” “Can I Put You On,” “Michelle’s Song”) and three short John–Buckmaster pieces: “Variations on Friends Theme (The First Kiss),” “Variation on Michelle’s Song (A Day in the Country),” and “I Meant to Do My Work Today (A Day in the Country),” the last set to a poem by English Romantic author Richard Le Gallienne. Side Two contains “Four Moods,” a lengthy Buckmaster instrumental.\n\n1. “Friends” (2:20)\n\n2. “Honey Roll” (3:00)\n\n3. “Variations on Friends Theme (The First Kiss)” (1:45)\n\n4. “Seasons” (3:52)\n\n5. “Variation on Michelle’s Song (A Day in the Country)” (2:44)\n\n6. “Can I Put You On” (5:52)\n\n1. “Michelle’s Song” (4:16)\n\n2. “I Meant to Do My Work Today (A Day in the Country)” (1:33)\n\n3. “Four Moods” (10:56)\n\n4. “Seasons Reprise” (1:33)\n\nQuaye, Olsson, and Murray play on “Can I Put You On” and “Honey Roll.” The latter also features Sam Apple Pie saxophonist Rex Morris. Morgan drums on “Friends” and “Michelle’s Song.” Madeline Bell and Lesley Duncan appear as backing singers along with Liza Strike, a vocalist on It Ain’t Easy and 1971 albums by Mick Softley, Michael Chapman, Mike Heron, Peter Bardens, Rosetta Hightower, Stray, and Whistler.\n\nBuckmaster did the orchestral arrangements on Friends, which Dudgeon produced and Geoffrey Cable engineered for Paramount Records.\n\nDJM and Uni issued “Friends” as a single (b/w “Honey Roll”). The song reached No. 5 in Italy and went Top 20 in France (No. 12), Canada (No. 13), and the US (No. 17 Cashbox).\n\nElton John played five UK cities between March 6 and 28, hitting Leicester, Kingston, Bristol, London, and Croydon, where he played Fairfield Halls, the site of 1970–71 live recordings by Eric Clapton and The Nice.\n\n17-11-70\n\nOn April 1, 1971, DJM and Uni issued 17-11-70, a document of Elton John’s performance at New York’s A&R Recording Studios for the live WABC-FM broadcast. Of the thirteen songs that John, Olsson, and Murray performed on November 17, 1970, the album contains six: two from Elton John (“Take Me to the Pilot,” “Sixty Years On”), one from Friends (“Can I Put You On”), one non-album b-side (“Bad Side of the Moon”), the Stones cover (“Honky Tonk Women”), and the elongated version of the Tumbleweed number “Burn Down the Mission,” which interpolates parts of The Beatles’ “Get Back” and the 1950 R&B chestnut “My Baby Left Me,” written and first recorded by Delta bluesman Arthur Crudup.\n\n1. “Take Me to the Pilot” (6:43)\n\n2. “Honky Tonk Women” (4:09)\n\n3. “Sixty Years On” (8:05)\n\n4. “Can I Put You On” (6:38)\n\n1. “Bad Side of the Moon” (4:30)\n\n2. “Burn Down the Mission” (incl. “My Baby Left Me” and “Get Back”) (18:20)\n\nDudgeon produced 17-11-70, which Manhattan soundman Phil Ramone engineered amid projects with Burt Bacharach, Lazarus, and Paul Winter’s Consort. 17-11-70 reached No. 20 on the UK Albums Chart, No. 10 on the Canadian RPM, and No. 11 on the US Billboard 200.\n\nThe full A&R Studios set includes three additional songs apiece from Elton John (“Your Song,” “Border Song,” “I Need You to Turn To”) and Tumbleweed (“Amoreena,” “Country Comfort,” “My Father’s Gun”), plus the then-unreleased “Indian Sunset” from his upcoming fourth studio album.\n\nOf the seven missing songs performed on November 17, “Amoreena” appears on the 1996 17-11-70 reissue on Rocket Records. The entire thirteen-song set remained unavailable until the 2017 two-LP reissue on the label branch of Record Store Day, a biannual vinyl celebration.\n\nElton embarked on a forty-four date US spring tour, which started in Providence on April 2, 1971, at Loew’s State Theatre and wrapped in Harrisburg, Penn, on June 18 at the Farm Show Arena. The tour included swings through Texas, the Great Plains, the Northwest, and Hawaii, plus two stops in New York, including a June 10–11 engagement at Carnegie Hall.\n\nElton, in his first Rolling Stone cover feature, appears on the magazine’s June 10, 1971, issue (No. 84). Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz took the grayscale photo of the singer, caputured floor-seated and hand-crossed, clad in star boots and a 3/4 t-shirt that reads “BERNIE TAUPIN FUNKY MONKEY” with an (obscured) cross-fingered image of the lyricist. In the four-page article, John tells journalist David Felton that “I vowed when I started on the road… if I’m gonna be an entertainer (which I didn’t want to be, I really didn’t want to go on the road as Elton John, but I had to because the records didn’t sell), I vowed I was really gonna try and give it everything I got.”\n\nTaupin\n\nIn June 1971, Bernie Taupin released the spoken-word album Taupin on DJM (UK) and Elektra (US). It contains poetry set to music by Quaye and Scottish guitarist Davey Johnstone, who plays acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, sitar, and lute on the album. Side One consists of “Child,” a poem divided into nine subtitles, including lyrics from the Elton John track “The Greatest Discovery.”\n\nSide Two contains six musical poems, including the three-part “Verses After Dark,” co-written by American singer–songwriter Shawn Phillips, who plays sitar, electric guitar, 6- and 12-string acoustic guitars, koto, and does additional spoken word on Taupin, which also features Strawbs double-bassist Ron Chesterman, Third Ear Band violinist Richard Coff, Chitinous Ensemble player Diana Lewis, and Australian jazz drummer Chris Karan, once of the Dudley Moore Trio.\n\nJohnstone joined folksters Magna Carta for the 1970–71 Vertigo albums Seasons and Songs From Wasties Orchard. His work on Taupin impressed Elton John, who hired Davey as his live guitarist and musical director. This marked the start of Johnstone’s fifty-year tenure in the Elton John Band.\n\nOn July 13, the Elton John Band played Garden Party II, an event at London’s Crystal Palace Bowl with sets by Fairport, Rory Gallagher, and Yes. On August 8, they played the Vilar dos Mouros Festival, an event in the Viana do Castelo district of northwest Portugal with sets by Manfred Mann’s Earth Band and local psychsters Quarteto 1111.\n\nOn August 27, Elton took his band on a US tour with back-to-back shows in New Jersey, followed by shows in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and three dates in upstate New York. After a round of southwest shows, they did their six-date, four-city tour of Japan (Oct. 5–11) and their first tour of Oceania, which covered four cities in Australia and an October 29 show at Western Springs Stadium in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nMadman Across the Water\n\nElton John released his fourth proper studio album, Madman Across the Water, on November 5, 1971, on DJM and Uni. It contains nine John–Taupin originals, including the pre-existing concert staple “Indian Summer” and the re-recorded title track (first cut during the Tumbleweed sessions). The first two songs, “Tiny Dancer” and “Levon,” later achieved radio evergreen status.\n\n1. “Tiny Dancer” (6:17)\n\n2. “Levon” (5:22)\n\n3. “Razor Face” (4:42)\n\n4. “Madman Across the Water” (5:57)\n\n1. “Indian Sunset” (6:47)\n\n2. “Holiday Inn” (4:17)\n\n3. “Rotten Peaches” (4:58)\n\n4. “All the Nasties” (5:09)\n\n5. “Goodbye” (1:49)\n\nMadman sessions first occurred on February 27 (“Levon”) at Trident Studios, followed by six months with sessions on August 9 (“Tiny Dancer”), 11, and 14. The album features Olsson and Murray on four songs: “All the Nasties,” “Holiday Inn,” “Tiny Dancer,” and “Rotten Peaches.” Johnstone plays acoustic guitar on the final two, plus the title track. He plays mandolin and sitar on “Holiday Inn,” which features electric guitar by Quaye, who appears with Hookfoot colleagues Pope and Glover on “Tiny Dancer” and “Razor Face.”\n\nMadman features twelve additional session musicians and eight backing vocalists. “Levon” features Quaye with Barry Morgan, bassist Brian Odgers, and library keyboardist Brian Dee (on harmonium). Accordion player Jack Emblow plays on “Razor Face” with organist Rick Wakeman, who plays on “Rotten Peaches” with guitarist Chris Spedding (slide), bassist Herbie Flowers, and drummer Terry Cox. The last two also play on “Indian Sunset” and (with Spedding) “Madman Across the Water,” which also features percussionist Ray Cooper, an eventual mainstay of Elton’s band who plays tambourine on “Rotten Peaches” and “All the Nasties.”\n\nOf the sessionists, Flowers partook in Blue Mink, Rumplestiltskin, and the latter’s instrumental variants Hungry Wolf and Ugly Custard. Wakeman — a recent sessionist for Cat Stevens (“Morning Has Broken”), T. Rex (“Get It On”), and Bowie (“Changes”) — was between a three-album gig in Strawbs and his star-making run in Yes. Spedding (ex-Battered Ornaments) plays on Lesley Duncan’s debut and 1970–71 albums by Bob Downes, Julie Driscoll, Linda Lewis, Michael Gibbs, Mike D’Abo, Neil Ardley, Ian Carr’s Nucleus, and Paul Korda.\n\nCochise steel guitarist B. J. Cole, responsible for the slide licks on “Tiny Dancer,” appears on concurrent album by Humble Pie, Nazareth, Peter Sarstedt, Phillip Goodhand-Tait, and Ray Fenwick. Olsson employs him on the 1971 DJM release Nigel Olsson’s Drum Orchestra and Chorus.\n\n“Tiny Dancer,” “Holiday Inn,” and “Rotten Peaches” feature backing vocals by returning singers Lesley Duncan, Liza Strike, Roger Cook, and Tony Burrows, plus Barry St. John (of Les Humphries Singers), Terry Steele (later Hiroshima), and the duo of Sue (Glover) & Sunny (Leslie). “Indian Sunset” and “All the Nasties” feature the Cantores em Ecclesia Choir directed by Robert Kirby, an arranger for Audience, Gillian McPherson, John Kongos, Nick Drake, Shelagh McDonald, and Spirogyra.\n\nDudgeon produced Madman Across the Water in succession with 1971 albums by Audience (The House On the Hill), Marsha Hunt, and the self-titled RCA–Neon release by Spring. Buckmaster conducted orchestral arrangements on seven songs (everything except “Razor Face” and “Rotten Peaches”). His wife, Diana Lewis, plays ARP synthesizer on “Rotten Peaches” and the title track. Geoffrey Cable engineered Madman and Spring amid projects with Colin Scot, Harry Nilsson, Peter Hammill (Fool’s Mate), and VDGG (Pawn Hearts).\n\nThis would be Elton’s last album for four years with backing by members of Hookfoot, who released their first of three albums in 1971 on DJM.\n\nLarkham designed the album’s matte, textured, denim-themed gatefold. It shows the title in gradient blue (front) and the song titles embroidered next to a denim seam (back). The inner-gates picture Elton in a grayscale short-haired medium-shot (left) and a bluescale long-haired profile (right). Original copies have a twelve-page inner booklet with lyrics and pics of John and Tauplin by photojournalist Bob Gruen, plus Victorian-era photos of subjects who represent the album’s musical and production team. Taupin dedicates “Tiny Dancer” to his new wife, Maxine (pictured on Page Three). Gruen also has visual credits on 1971 albums by Labelle, Larry Coryell, and Lotti Golden.\n\nElton and his band plugged Madman with six late November shows (21–28) in Coventry, Manchester, Leicester, Bournemouth, Plymouth, and Bristol.\n\nOn November 29, 1971, Uni lifted “Levon” (b/w “Goodbye”) as Elton’s fifth proper US single. It reached No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 6 in Canada.\n\nIn December, Elton player seven documented UK shows, including a 12/10 date at Newcastle’s City Hall with the Texan folk-pop duo England Dan & John Ford Coley.\n\nMadman Across the Water reached No. 8 in Australia and No. 9 in Canada. It went Top 20 in Italy (No. 14), Spain (No. 11), and Japan (No. 13). In the US, the album reached No. 8 on the Billboard 200. It was later certified double-Platinum (2 million sales) by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nElton accompanied his friend Marc Bolan of T. Rex for their December 27 TotP mime of “Get It On,” a UK summer No. 1 that TotP aired as part of a holiday roundup of the year’s biggest hits, including 1971 chart-toppers by the Rolling Stones (“Brown Sugar”), Rod Stewart (“Maggie May”), and Slade (“Coz I Luv You”).\n\n1972\n\nOn February 5, the Elton John Band played their first concert of 1972 at London’s Royal Festival Hall.\n\nUni lifted “Tiny Dancer” as Elton John’s sixth US single on Feb. 7 (b/w “Razor Face”). Due to its unedited full-album length (6:12), many AM stations refused to playlist the song. Consequently, “Tiny Dancer” peaked at No. 29 on the Cashbox Top 100 and No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. It did, however, reach the Top 20 in Australia (No. 13) and Canada (No. 19). Despite its modest peaks, “Tiny Dancer” later achieved FM evergreen status.\n\nIn late February, Elton played five concerts in England, including two national youth benefits at London’s Shaw Theatre. Elton opened March with a four-city Scottish tour, followed by two appearances at Jahrhunderhalle in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nBetween his own live and studio work, John produced Side One of the April 1972 Warner release Everything Stops for Tea by Long John Baldry. Olsson and Johnstone play on the five Elton–produced numbers; Johnstone co-wrote “Wild Mountain Thyme” with Baldry, who also covers songs by John Kongos (“Jubilee Cloud”) and the Australian band Daddy Cool (“Come Back Again”). Rod Stewart produced Side Two and plays banjo on the trad number “Mother Ain’t Dead.”\n\nOn April 26, Elton launched an eleven-date US tour with three shows in Texas, followed by a Midwest swing that included three Ohio dates and a May 13 show at the Field House in DeKalb, Illinois.\n\nHonky Château\n\nElton John released his fifth studio album, Honky Château, on May 19, 1972, on DJM and Uni. This is his first album with backing on all tracks by his live band: Olsson, Murray, and Johnstone. The album spawned two Billboard Top 10 hits and became his first of seven US No. 1 albums. The title combines part of the first track (“Honky Cat”) with the name of the French château where sessions took place.\n\nHonky Château features ten John–Taupin originals.\n\n1. “Honky Cat” (5:12)\n\n2. “Mellow” (5:33)\n\n3. “I Think I’m Going to Kill Myself” (3:35)\n\n4. “Susie (Dramas)” (3:25)\n\n5. “Rocket Man (I Think It’s Going To Be a Long, Long Time)” (4:40)\n\n1. “Salvation” (3:59)\n\n2. “Slave” (4:22)\n\n3. “Amy” (4:03)\n\n4. “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters” (5:01)\n\n5. “Hercules” (5:21)\n\nSessions occurred in January 1972 in Hérouville, France, at the Château d’Hérouville: a castle facility also used for 1972 recordings by Alice, Joan Armatrading, Pink Floyd, T. Rex, Zoo, and most infamously by Jethro Tull, who abandonded their intended followup to Thick As a Brick due to conditions at the château (the recordings later appeared as The Chateau d’Isaster Tapes).\n\nGus Dudgeon produced Honky Château amid work on Grave New World by Strawbs and Armatrading’s debut. This is the first of Elton’s two albums with engineer Ken Scott, a late-period Beatles soundman who produced Bowie’s 1971–73 output.\n\nHonky Château features Elton on Hammond organ (“Mellow,” “Susie”), harmonium (“Salvation”), and the Fender Rhodes electric piano (“Honky Cat”) in addition to grand piano (everything but “Slave”).\n\nOlsson plays on everything except the percussion-free “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters,” which features Johnstone on mandolin. Davey plays banjo on “Honky Cat” (the only guitar-free track) and “Slave,” which also features his slide work.\n\nFrench jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty plays electric violin on “Mellow” and “Amy,” which also features percussionist Ray Cooper, who played his first live shows with John in early 1972. “Legs” Larry Smith (ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band) does the tap dance on “I Think I’m Going to Kill Myself.” Dudgeon plays the whistle on “Hercules.”\n\n“Honky Cat” features a four-piece French brass section: trombonist Jacques Bolognesi and saxophonists Alain Hatot and Jean-Louis Chautemps (all recently of Janko Nilovic’s Giant) and trumpeter Ivan Jullien. “Salvation” features backing vocals by Bell, Hazzard, Strike, and Larry Steel, a recent auxiliary for Jonathan Kelly, Masters Apprentices, and Tír na nÓg.\n\nHonky Château is housed in a sepia gatefold with photography by Ed Caraeff. It shows a bearded close-up of Elton (front); headshots of John, Olsson, Murray, and Johnstone (back); and a lyrics spread with a distant field shot of Taupin (inner-gates).\n\nOn April 7, 1972, DJM lifted “Rocket Man” as an advance single, backed with the Madman tracks “Holiday Inn” and “Goodbye.” In the US, “Rocket Man” appeared on April 17 (b/w “Susie (Dramas)”). “Rocket Man” reached No. 2 in the UK, No. 6 in Ireland, and No. 8 in Canada. In the US, “Rocket Man” reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 11 on the Cashbox Top 100.\n\nElton and his band mimed “Rocket Man” on the April 27 broadcast of TotP, which twice re-aired it amid spring hits by Chickory Tip (“What’s Your Name”), Lindisfarne (“Lady Eleanor”), Long John Baldry (“Iko Iko”), The Moody Blues (“Isn’t Life Strange?”), The Move (“California Man”), Ringo Starr (“Back Off Boogaloo”), The Rolling Stones (“Tumbling Dice”), Sly & the Family Stone (“Runnin’ Away”), T. Rex (“Metal Guru”), and Greek singer Vicki Leandros (“Come What May”).\n\nOn June 2, Elton played London’s Crystal Palace Bowl as part of a Beach Boys-headed multi-bill with sets by Joe Cocker, Melanie, Richie Havens, and Sha Na Na. That month, Elton and his band returned to Château d’Hérouville to record their next album.\n\nOn July 31, Uni issued “Honky Cat” as Elton’s eighth US single (b/w “Slave”). In the UK, DJM lifted “Honky Cat” on August 25 as the album’s second single, backed with the 1969 rarities “Lady Samantha” and “It’s Me That You Need.” Elton plugged its UK release with an eight-date tour (Aug. 26–Sept. 17) supported by Linda Lewis.\n\n“Honky Cat” reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 10 in Canada. In New Zealand, it reached No. 4 on the Listener chart. In early live performances, Elton donned a cat costume for “Honky Cat,” which TotP aired on its August 31 broadcast amid hits by Blackfoot Sue (“Standing In the Road”), Roxy Music (“Virginia Plain”), Rod Stewart (“You Wear It Well”), and Slade (“Mama Weer All Crazee Now”).\n\nHonky Château reached No. 1 in Spain and No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. The album also went Top 10 in Canada (No. 3), Australia (No. 4), Italy (No. 5), Norway (No. 8), and the Netherlands (No. 9). In the US, Honky Château reached No. 1 and later achieved Platinum certification by the RIAA.\n\nThe planned third single, “Hercules,” never materialized but its intended b-side, an uptempo alternate version of “Slave,” appears as a bonus track on the 1996 Rocket reissue of Honky Château.\n\nElton consolidated the album’s stateside success with the Legs Larry Tour: a 23-date North American swing (Sept. 26–Oct. 27) that hit the Northeast, Midwest, Canada, Hawaii, and the West Coast, including two shows at the Berkeley Community Theatre supported by Family. During his Oct. 22–24 stop in the LA–Anaheim area, he visited the Rancho Mirage property of comedic legend Groucho Marx, who made a hand-gun gesture and referred to the singer as ‘John Elton,’ to which the singer raised his hands and said “don’t shoot me, I’m only the piano player.”\n\n“Crocodile Rock”\n\nOn October 27, 1972, DJM issued “Crocodile Rock,” an uptempo fifties nostalgia spoof backed with “Elderberry Wine” — both tasters from the album completed four months earlier at Château d’Hérouville.\n\nElton and his band flew home from the Legs Larry Tour for an October 30 command performance for the queen at the London Palladium. Two days later, they appeared in Stillwater, Oklahoma, for a 21-date (Nov. 1–26) jaunt that covered the Deep South and East Coast. On November 20, “Crocodile Rock” became Elton’s first release on MCA, which retired its Uni division.\n\n“Crocodile Rock” reached No. 5 in the UK and No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Cashbox Top 100. It also reached No. 1 in Canada, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. The song went Top 3 in Australia, Belgium, Germany, and Norway.\n\nElton and his band mimed “Crocodile Rock” on the November 8 broadcast of TotP, which reaired the song across three fortnights amid autumn–winter hits by David Bowie (“The Jean Genie”), Family (“Burlesque”), Gilbert O’Sullivan (“Claire”), Gladys Knight & the Pips (“Help Me Make It Through the Night”), Jeff Beck (“Hi-Ho Silver Lining”), Lynsey De Paul (“Getting a Drag”), Michael Jackson (“Ben”), The Stylistics (“I’m Stone In Love With You”), and Wizzard (“Ball Park Incident”).\n\n1973\n\n“Crocodile Rock” entered the Billboard Top 10 on the week of January 13, 1973. Three weeks later, it overtook “Superstition” by Stevie Wonder as the No. 1 song in the US. It held the top spot for three weeks, then bowed down for “Killing Me Softly” by Roberta Flack.\n\nCashbox ranked “Crocodile Rock” No. 4 on its 1973 year-end chart, just ahead of songs by Diana Ross (“Touch Me in the Morning”), Paul McCartney & Wings (“My Love”), Carly Simon (“You’re So Vain”), and Billy Paul (“Me and Mrs. Jones”). Paul’s hit comes from his 1972 Philadelphia International Records release 360 Degrees of Billy Paul, which contains a cover of “Your Song.”\n\nDon’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player\n\nElton John released his sixth album, Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player, on January 22, 1973, on DJM and MCA. It contains both sides of his preceding single (“Crocodile Rock,” “Elderberry Wine”) and eight new John–Taupin originals, including two brassy, uptempo numbers (“Elderberry Wine,” “Midnight Creeper”), two lavish ballads (“Blues for Baby and Me,” “High Flying Bird”), an R&B romp (“I’m Going to Be a Teenage Idol”), a rustic redneck spoof (“Texan Love Song”), and the orchestral epic “Have Mercy on the Criminal.” The album’s humble opener, “Daniel,” is one of his most recognized ballads.\n\n1. “Daniel” (3:55)\n\n2. “Teacher I Need You” (4:10)\n\n3. “Elderberry Wine” (3:34)\n\n4. “Blues for Baby and Me” (5:39)\n\n5. “Midnight Creeper” (3:52)\n\n6. “Have Mercy on the Criminal” (5:58)\n\n7. “I’m Going to Be a Teenage Idol” (3:56)\n\n8. “Texan Love Song” (3:33)\n\n9. “Crocodile Rock” (3:55)\n\n10. “High Flying Bird” (4:12)\n\nSessions took place with Gus Dudgeon in June 1972 at the Château d’Hérouville; nicknamed ‘Strawberry Studios’ in the credits (not to be confused with the Stockport, England, facility run by 10cc). Ken Scott, who plays ARP synthesizer on “Daniel,” engineered Don’t Shoot Me ahead of Aladdin Sane, the April 1973 RCA release by David Bowie. Buckmaster does the orchestral arrangements on “Blues for Baby and Me” and “Have Mercy on the Criminal.”\n\nJohn plays grand piano on everything apart from “Texan Love Song” (harmonium), “Midnight Creeper” and “Daniel,” which feature the Fender Rhodes electric piano. He also plays Mellotron (“Daiel,” “Teacher I Need You”) and Farfisa organ (“Crocodile Rock”). “I’m Going to Be a Teenage Idol” features ‘Leslie piano’ (a grand piano filtered through a Leslie effects processor).\n\nDavey Johnstone plays acoustic and Leslied electric guitar on all tracks, plus banjo (“Daniel”), sitar (“Blues for Baby and Me”), and mandolin (“Texan Love Song”). Don’t Shoot Me is Elton’s first album with rock backing confined to Johnstone, Murray, and Olsson. They sing backing vocals on “Teacher I Need You,” “I’m Going to Be a Teenage Idol,” and “High Flying Bird.”\n\nDudgeon summons the “Honky Cat” horn section (Bolognesi, Chautemps, Hatot, Jullien) on three tracks: “Elderberry Wine,” “Midnight Creeper,” and “I’m Going to Be a Teenage Idol.”\n\nLarkham designed the album cover with DJM art director Michael Ross, also credited with visuals on 1972–73 titles by Hookfoot, Goodhand-Tait, Sam Apple Pie, and the 1972 Uni release Queues by Vigrass & Osborne, the duo of singer Paul Vigrass and singer–lyricist Gary Osborne. Don’t Shoot Me is housed in a gatefold that shows the title on the billboard of a fifties movie theatre (front) and a similar image as a photo within a photo (back). As a tribute to the title source, a poster to the 1940 Marx Brothers film Go West appears on the far right. The left inner-gate shows the album’s credits in the style of a vintage film poster, complete with deco font and a childhood pic of Reginald at his piano. Original copies have a twelve-page booklet with lyrics and Caraeff color pics of Elton, Bernie, and the band.\n\nDJM lifted “Daniel” ten days ahead of the album on January 12, 1973; backed with a remake of the Empty Sky track “Skyline Pigeon.” It reached No. 4 in the UK and Ireland and went Top 10 in New Zealand (No. 2), Norway (No. 8), South Africa (No. 7), and Switzerland (No. 5). In March, MCA issued “Daniel” in North America, where it reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 on Billboard and Cashbox.\n\nElton and his band mimed “Daniel” on the January 11 broadcast of TotP, which twice aired it amid winter 1973 hits by Chairmen of the Board (“I’m On My Way to a Better Place”), Colin Blunstone (“How Could We Dare to Be Wrong”), Electric Light Orchestra (“Roll Over Beethoven”), Elvis Presley (“Always On My Mind”), Free (“Wishing Well”), Sweet (“Blockbuster”), and The Temptations (“Papa Was a Rolling Stone”).\n\nDon’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player reached No. 1 in the UK, Australia, Canada, Italy, and Norway. It peaked at No. 2 in Finland and the Netherlands and No. 4 in Denmark and Japan. In the US, the album became his second consecutive No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and later certified triple-Platinum (3,000,000 sold). The 1996 Rocket reissue contains four additional tracks: the remade “Skyline Pigeon” and the late-1973 b-sides “Screw You (Young Man’s Blues),” “Jack Rabbit,” and “Whenever You’re Ready (We’ll Go Steady Again).”\n\nElton and his band played their first 1973 show on February 24 at the Starlight Room in Boston, England. After eighteen UK dates (through March 27 at Manchester’s Hard Rock), they did a four-city tour of Italy (April 11–17). In May, they recorded twenty-two songs at Château d’Hérouville.\n\n“Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting”\n\nOn June 29, 1973, Elton John released “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting,” an energized riff-rocker backed with “Whenever You’re Ready (We’ll Go Steady Again)” and “Jack Rabbit” — all tasters from the May château sessions.\n\n“Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting” reached No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. Elton and his band mined the song on the June 29 broadcast of TotP, which twice aired it amid hits by Clifford T. Ward (“Gaye”), David Bowie (“Life On Mars”), Jackson 5 (“Hallelujah Day”), Joe Simon (“Step By Step”), Mott the Hoopler (“Honaloochie Boogie”), Slade (“Sqweeze Me Pleeze Me”), and Sylvia (“Pillow Talk”).\n\nOn August 14, they launched a 34-date US tour at the Municipal Auditorium in Mobile, Alabama, supported by the Sutherland Brothers & Quiver. Stevie Wonder joined them onstage during their September 25 show at Boston Garden. The tour ran through October as the new album dropped.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\n\nElton John released his seventh album, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, on October 5, 1973, on DJM and MCA. This is his first studio double-album with the summer hit “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting” and sixteen new John–Taupin originals.\n\nSide One contains the two-part epic “Funeral for a Friend–Love Lies Bleeding,” his longest song at more than eleven minutes. Side Two contains a re-recorded version of the 1970 b-side “Grey Seal.”\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road became his third consecutive US chart-topper and spawned three further chart singles: “Bennie and the Jets,” “Candle in the Wind,” and the title track.\n\n1. “Funeral for a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding” (11:09)\n\n2. “Candle in the Wind” (3:50)\n\n3. “Bennie and the Jets” (5:23)\n\n1. “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” (3:13)\n\n2. “This Song Has No Title” (2:23)\n\n3. “Grey Seal” (4:00)\n\n4. “Jamaica Jerk-Off” (3:39) inspired by John and Taupin’s January stay in the country, where Bernie wrote the album’s lyrics.\n\n5. “I’ve Seen That Movie Too” (5:59)\n\n1. “Sweet Painted Lady” (3:54)\n\n2. “The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909–34)” (4:23)\n\n3. “Dirty Little Girl” (5:00)\n\n4. “All the Girls Love Alice” (5:09)\n\n1. “Your Sister Can’t Twist (But She Can Rock ‘n Roll)” (2:42)\n\n2. “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting” (4:57)\n\n3. “Roy Rogers” (4:07)\n\n4. “Social Disease” (3:42)\n\n5. “Harmony” (2:46)\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road is Elton’s third consecutive album recorded at Château d’Hérouville in France, where sessions took place with Dudgeon in May 1973, four months after their aborted attempt to record in Jamaica, which intrigued Elton due to the Rolling Stones’ recent use of Kingston’s Dynamic Sounds Studio for their August 1973 release Goats Head Soup.\n\nElton plays grand piano on all but two songs: “Jamaica Jerk-Off” and “Dirty Little Girl.” On the former, he plays Farfisa organ (also heard on “Bennie and the Jets,” “This Song Has No Title,” and “Your Sister Can’t Twist”). On the latter, he plays Mellotron (also heard — along with Fender Rhodes electric piano — on “No Title” and “Grey Seal”).\n\nJohnstone regular guitar (electric and acoustic) throughout the album, as well as banjo, slide, and steel on select tracks. He, Murray, and Olsson sing backing vocals on six tracks, including “Funeral for a Friend,” “The Ballad of Danny Bailey,” and “Harmony.”\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road is the first of three consecutive Elton albums engineered by David Hentschel, a soundman on recent albums by Al Stewart (Orange), Atomic Rooster, Genesis (Nursery Cryme), Home, Jackson Heights, Mott the Hoople, and the 1973 self-titled debut by Queen. He plays ARP synthesizer on “Funeral for a Friend” and “All the Girls Love Alice,” which features car effects Olsson and backing vocals by English pop singer Kiki Dee, a recent Motown Rare Earth signee with a backlog of sixites singles (and a 1968 album) on Fontana.\n\n“Alice” also features tambourine by Elton’s live auxiliary player Ray Cooper, who possibly plays the uncredited vibraphone on “Sweet Painted Lady.” (He later plays the instrument on Elton’s twelfth studio album.) Olsson, who plays congas and tambourine on assorted tracks, is possibly responsible for the uncredited percussive sundries (maracas, timbales, claves) heard on “Jamaica Jerk-Off,” which features vocal trade-offs by ‘Reggae Dwight’ (Elton), and ‘Toots Taupin’ (Bernie) and a mystery figure dubbed ‘Prince Rhino.’ American Latin jazz-funk saxophonist Leroy Gómez solos on “Social Disease.”\n\nSix tracks — “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” “I’ve Seen That Movie Too,” “Sweet Painted Lady,” “The Ballad of Danny Bailey,” “Roy Rogers” and “Harmony” — feature orchestral arrangements by Del Newman, a string conductor on 1972–73 albums by Armatrading, Family (Bandstand), Nilsson (Son of Schmilsson), Peter Frampton, and Rick Springfield.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road names two assistant engineers: Château soundman Andy Scott and Trident mixer Peter Kelsey. Scott also worked on 1973 titles by the French bands Ange and Zao (Z=7L) and the 1974 Kedzie Records release Each Man Makes His Destiny by Paris-based American funksters Ice, an alternate name of the Lafayette Afro Rock Band.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road is housed in a six-panel trifold cover designed by Larkham and Ross with artwork by Ian Beck. The cover depicts a platform-booted Elton, who walks into a poster of a yellow brick road; plastered on a brick wall along a sidewalk with a mini lavender piano. The back cover illustrates a poster with titles and credits; tacked to a wall above a teddy bear. The third panel has park photos of Elton, Bernie, and the band; tacked to the same wall.\n\nThe inner-trifold has lyrics in assorted colors with variable title fonts and accompanying illustrations, including sketches of Marilyn (“Candle In the Wind”), Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh (“I’ve Seen That Movie Too”), and Bette Davis (“You’re Sister Can’t Twist”). A photo of Taupin and his then wife, Maxine, accompanies “The Ballad of Danny Bailey.”\n\nOn September 7, DJM lifted “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” as the second advance UK single, backed with the non-album “Screw You (Young Man’s Blues).”\n\nThe single reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 4 in Ireland and Australia. It also went Top 10 in New Zealand (No. 2), South Africa (No. 7), and Norway (No. 9).\n\nOn October 15, MCA lifted “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” in North America, where it reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. on the Cashbox Top 100 and the Canadian RPM.\n\nElton and his band mimed “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” on the October 11 broadcast of TotP, which aired it across two fortnights amid hits by Bryan Ferry (“A Hard Rain’s Gonna Fall”), The Carpenters (“Top of the World”), ELO (“Showdown”), Ike & Tina Turner (“Nutbush City Limits”), The Isley Brothers (“That Lady”), Nazareth (“This Flight Tonight”), The Spinners (“Ghetto Child”), and Status Quo (“Caroline”).\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road reached No. 1 in the UK, Australia, US, and Canada. It went Top 10 in Denmark (No. 4), Italy (No. 5), Norway (No. 5), Sweden (No. 7), Spain (No. 8), and New Zealand (No. 9). The album later certified Platinum in the UK (300,000), double-Platinum in Canada (200,000), ten-times Platinum in Australia (500,000), and octuple-Platinum in the US (8,000,000).\n\nElton and his band greeted the album’s release with the final ten dates (Oct. 5–21) of their US tour with Sutherland Brothers & Quiver.\n\n“Step into Christmas”\n\nOn November 23, 1973, Elton John released “Step into Christmas,” a jolly Yuletide anthem backed with “Ho, Ho, Ho (Who’d Be a Turkey at Christmas).”\n\nElton and his band mimed “Step into Christmas” on the December 12 broadcast of TotP, which aired it amid hits by Cozy Powell (“Dance With the Devil”), Faces (“Pool Hall Richard”), Leo Sayer (“The Show Must Go On”), and Steeleye Span (“Gaudete”). Elton performed it on the December 22 broadcast of The Gilbert O’Sullivan Show., where Bernie deputized Ray Cooper on percussion.\n\nIn late November, Elton commenced a nine-stop UK tour comprised of thirteen shows, including two-nighters in Glasgow (Dec. 10–11, Apollo) and Birmingham (Dec. 16–17, Town Hall), the latter with Kiki Dee. Elton wrapped the tour with a Dec. 21–23 holiday engagement at the Hammersmith Odeon.\n\nThe Rocket Record Company\n\nIn 1973, Elton John founded the Rocket Record Company in partnership with Bernie Taupin, Gus Dudgeon, and Steve Brown. Elton talks about the venture in the August 16 issue of Rolling Stone (No. 141), which depicts the singer in a cartoon cover illustration by Kim Whitesides. In the six-page feature by writer and radio presenter Paul Gambaccini, Elton insists that he co-founded the label to nurture up-and-coming talent; not to promote his own releases (he points to the Moody Blues and their Threshold label as an example of a small roster drowned by its star act).\n\nRocket’s debut release (PIGL 1) was If It Was So Simple, the first of two albums by Longdancer, a folk-rock band with guitarist Kai Olsson (Nigel’s brother) and guitarist–singer Dave A. Stewart (later of The Tourists and Eurythmics).\n\nDavey Johnstone released his singular solo album, Smiling Face, in late 1973 as the second Rocket release (PIGL 2). It contains ten originals, including three co-writes with his wife Di, plus a cover of the Bert Jansch–John Renbourn composition “After the Dance” and the trad standard “A Lark In the Morning With Mrs. McCleod.” Smiling Face features backing by Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray with select appearances by Joan Armatrading, BJ Cole, and Elton himself (harmonica on “Keep Right On”). Hentschel, who plays ARP on “Janine,” co-engineered the Dudgeon-produced album with Ken Scott.\n\nElton and Nova Sound Studios engineer Clive Franks co-produced Loving and Free, the December 1973 Rocket release (PIGL 5) by Kiki Dee. It features two otherwise unrecorded John–Taupin numbers (“Supercool,” “Lonnie and Josie”) and covers of songs by Free (“Travellin In Style”) and Stealers Wheel (“You Put Something Better Inside Me”), plus four Kiki originals, including the closing ballad “Sugar On the Floor.” Loving and Free spawned a UK and Australian Top 20 hit with “Amoureuse,” a 1972 song by French singer Véronique Sanson, who co-wrote it with Gary Osborne.\n\n1974\n\nIn January 1974, Elton John recorded new music at the recently opened Caribou Ranch, a converted barn facility in the Rocky Mountains near Nederland, Colorado. Music mogul James William Guercio built the studio on earnings from his main client, brass-rockers Chicago, who recorded their 1973–77 output (albums VI through XI) at the ranch, the site of their July 1973 ABC broadcast .\n\nElton and his band launched their second Japanese tour with a February 1–2, 1974, engagement at Tokyo’s Nippon Budokan. The ten-show tour hit Osaka, Fukuoka, Kyoto, and Nagoya, then returned Tokyo for a Feb. 13 show at Shinjuku Kohsei Nenkin Hall. Ray Cooper joined as a full-time member of Elton’s band.\n\nOn February 4, 1974, MCA lifted “Bennie and the Jets” as the third North American Yellow Brick single, backed with the popular deep-cut “Harmony.” It reached No. 1 on the Canadian RPM and the US Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox Top 100. “Bennie” also reached No. 15 on Billboard‘s Hot Soul Singles chart.\n\nInsiders tapped “Harmony” as a possible a-side; a notion mooted by its use as a b-side and the upcoming release of John’s next album. In Boston, “Harmony” reached No. 1 on WBZ-FM’s listener-voted chart.\n\nOn February 22, DJM lifted “Candle in the Wind” (b/w “Bennie and the Jets”) as the third Yellow Brick single in the UK, Europe, and Oceania. It reached No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart. Both songs charted as a double a-side in Australia (No. 5), Ireland (No. 18), and New Zealand (No. 13).\n\nTotP aired “Candle in the Wind” on its March 21 broadcast along with hits by Diana Ross & Marvin Gaye (“You Are Everything”), ELO (“Ma-Ma-Ma Belle”), The Hollies (“The Air That I Breathe”), and Mott the Hoople (“The Golden Age of Rock ‘n’ Roll”).\n\nElton and his band traveled Down Under for a six-show tour (Feb. 21–March 18) that covered five cities in Australia (Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Randwick, Perth) plus Auckland, New Zealand, where they performed to 49,000 fans at Western Springs Stadium (2/28).\n\nIn May, Elton and his band performed two UK benefit shows: one for the Invalid Children’s Aid Association (5/18: Royal Festival Hall) and with guests Rod Stewart and Nazareth at Vicarage Road, Watford (5/5). Elton appears on Stewart’s 1974 album Smiler, which contains a cover of the unreleased John–Tauper composition “Let Me Be Your Car” with John on piano and backing vocals.\n\nOn May 27, Elton and his band played to 12,500 London fans at Wembley’s Empire Pool Arena. John appeared stateside at a June 14 Beach Boys concert at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, NY, where he joined the band onstage for encores of “Barbara Ann” and “Surfin’ USA.”\n\nCaribou\n\nElton John released his eighth album, Caribou, on June 24, 1974, on DJM and MCA. It has ten John–Taupin originals that range from uptempo riff-rockers (“The Bitch Is Back,” “Grimsby”) to harmonized ballads (“I’ve Seen the Saucers,” “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me”) and brassy R&B (“You’re So Static,” “Stinker”) with forays into country (“Pinky,” “Dixie Lily”) and music hall (“Solar Prestige a Gammon”). The album closes with “Ticking,” a lengthy piano-laden narrative about a young man pushed over the edge.\n\n1. “The Bitch Is Back” (3:44)\n\n2. “Pinky” (3:54)\n\n3. “Grimsby” (3:46)\n\n4. “Dixie Lily” (2:55)\n\n5. “Solar Prestige a Gammon” (2:52)\n\n6. “You’re So Static” (4:53)\n\n7. “I’ve Seen the Saucers” (4:48)\n\n8. “Stinker” (5:20)\n\n9. “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” (5:36)\n\n10. “Ticking” (7:34)\n\n12. “Sick City” 5:23\n\n13. “Cold Highway” 3:25\n\nElton named the album after Caribou Ranch, where he laid the tracks with Dudgeon in January after sessions wrapped on Chicago IV. Additional sessions took place in London (Trident) and Santa Monica at Brother Studios, a newly opened facility owned by the Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson. This is Elton’s first album since 17-11-70 with involvement by Clive Franks, who engineered Caribou in sequence with the 1974 Rocket release Totally Out of Control by the Hudson Brothers. Dave Hentschel mixed Caribou at Trident Studios.\n\nElton plays grand piano thoughout Caribou and Hammond organ on “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me.” Hentschel plays ARP synthesizer on three tracks (“Pinky,” “Solar Prestige a Gammon,” “Ticking”) and Mellotron on DLtSGDoM. Cooper plays assorted hand and pitch percussion, including vibraphone, castanets, and tubular bells.\n\nFour tracks (“The Bitch Is Back,” “You’re So Static,” “Stinker,” “Don’t Let the Sun”) feature the Tower of Power horn section: trumpeter Greg Adams, trombonist Mic Gillette, and saxophonists Steve Kupka (baritone), Lenny Pickett and Emilio Castillo (both tenor). Pickett also plays clarinet on “Solar Prestige” and soprano sax on that and “Dixie Lily.” ToP organist Chester D. Thompson plays on “Stinker.”\n\n“The Bitch Is Back” features backing vocals by Clydie King, Sherlie Matthews, Jessie Mae Smith, and Dusty Springfield. “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” features backing vocals by Captain & Tennille and Caryl Wilson along with fellow Beach Boys Bruce Johnston and Billy Hinsche.\n\nCaribou is housed in a single sleeve designed by Larkham and Ross with Caraeff photography. It shows Elton posed before an imitation lakeside backdrop in a tiger top and loon pants. The back covers shows him (blue leisure suit) and Bernie (leath suit) seated on stools against a background film projection. Elton’s face appears in rose-colored frames on the otherwise monochrome inner-sleeve photo.\n\nOn May 24, DJM lifted “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” as an advance single, backed with the non-album “Sick City.” It went Top 20 in the UK Ireland, and Australia but faired better in North America, where MCA issued the single on June 10. “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nTotP aired “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” on its June 13 broadcast amid hits by Alan Price (“Jarrow Song”), Arrows (“A Touch Too Much”), Cozy Powell (“The Man In Black”), First Class (“Beach Baby”), Leo Sayer (“One Man Band”), and Ray Stevens (“The Streak”).\n\nOn August 30, DJM and MCA lifted “The Bitch Is Back” as the second Caribour single, backed with the non-album “Cold Highway.” It peaked at No. 15 in the UK but reached No 1 in Canada. In the US, “The Bitch Is Back” reached No. 5 on the Cashbox Top 100 and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nElton and his band mimed “The Bitch Is Back” on the September 5 broadcast of TotP, which twice aired the song amid hits by 10cc (“Silly Love”), Andy-Fairweather Low (“Reggae Tune”), Brian Protheroe (“Pinball”), Carl Douglas (“Kung Fu Fighting”), Cat Stevens (“Another Saturday Night”), The Commadores (“Machine Gun”), Don Covay (“It’s Better To Have”), and Robert Wyatt (“I’m a Believer”).\n\nCaribou reached No. 1 in the UK, Australia, Canada, Denmark, and the US. It peaked at No. 2 in Japan and went Top 10 in Italy (No. 8), Norway (No. 6), Spain (No. 4), Sweden (No. 3), and Yugoslavia (No. 5). The album later certified double-Platinum in Australia (100,000) and the US (2,000,000).\n\nElton and his band plugged Caribou with a 24-date autumn US tour that included multiple dates with the Kiki Dee Band, then promoting their 1974 Rocket release I’ve Got the Music in Me and it’s title hit (written by ontime Trees bassist Bias Boshell and covered in 1975 by Thelma Houston with Pressure Cooker). The tour launched on September 25 at the Dallas Convention Center and wrapped on November 15 at Detroit’s Olympia Stadium.\n\n“Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds”\n\nOn November 15, 1974, Elton released the Beatles cover “Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds,” recorded at Caribou with guitar and backing vocals by John Lennon, who performs under the pseudonym Dr. Winston O’Boogie (Winston was Lennon’s middle name). The b-side, “One Day (At a Time),” is a cover of Lennon’s recent deep cut from his 1973 album Mind Games.\n\nElton, in turn, plays piano on “Whatever Gets You thru the Night,” the lead-off single on Lennon’s 1974 release Walls and Bridges, recorded in the summer of 1974. After Lennon’s single reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, he appeared (as promised) at Elton’s November 24 show at Madison Square Garden, where the two performed both a-sides and “I Saw Her Standing There.”\n\nOn December 2–3, Elton and his band played the Philadelphia Spectrum, then headed home for a 12/12 appearance on TotP, where they mimed “Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds” amid autumn hits by Barry White (“You’re The First, The Last, My Everything”), Bachman-Turner Overdrive (“You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet”), Disco Tex & the Sex-O-Lettes (“Get Dancing”), Status Quo (“Down Down”), Rod Stewart (“You Can Make Me Dance, Sing Or Anything”), and Wizzard (“Are You Ready to Rock”).\n\nFor the 1974 Christmas holiday, Elton and his band played five straight nights (Dec. 20–24) at the Hammersmith Odeon. “Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds” reached No. 10 in the UK and No. 3 in Australia. In January 1975, it reached No. 1 in Canada and the US. Elton’s “Lucy” cover is the second of two non-Beatles versions of a Lennon–McCartney song (after the 1964 Peter & Gordan hit “A World Without Love”) to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nLady Samantha\n\nIn 1974, DJM issued Lady Samantha, a UK-only rarities compilation on cassette and 8-track. It contains fourteen songs, including the recent b-sides “Skyline Pigeon” (remake), “Jack Rabbit,” “Screw You (aka Young Man’s Blues),” “Whenever You’re Ready (We’ll Go Steady Again),” and “Ho! Ho! Ho! (Who’d Be a Turkey at Christmas).”\n\nLady Samantha also collects John’s early non-albums tracks, including the title-sake song (his first a-side) and both sides of the 1969–70 singles “Rock and Roll Madonna” (b/w the original “Grey Seal”) and “It’s Me That You Need” (b/w “Just Like Strange Rain”), plus the long-elusive b-sides “Bad Side of the Moon” and “Into the Old Man’s Shoes.” Two songs from the Friends soundtrack (“Friends” and “Honey Roll”) round out the set.\n\nDJM later reissued Lady Samantha on vinyl (1980) and CD (1988). All fourteen songs appear on John’s 1992 compilation Rare Masters, a double-CD with twenty-four additional tracks.\n\nGreatest Hits\n\nIn November 1974, Elton’s first Greatest Hits collection appeared on DJM, MCA, and Polydor. It rounds up ten of his then-most familiar songs among US and UK audiences.\n\nThe US tracklist features two songs from his self-titled second album (“Your Song,” “Border Song”) and eight 1972–74 numbers: two each from Honky Château (“Honky Cat,” “Rocket Man”) and Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (“Daniel,” “Crocodile Rock”), plus three from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (title track, “Bennie and the Jets,” “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting”) and one from Caribou (“Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me”).\n\nUK copies replace “Bennie and the Jets” with “Candle in the Wind.” Greatest Hits contains nothing from Empty Sky (still unissued in the US) and Tumbleweed Connection (which had no singles). Madman Across the Water is also unrepresented, possibly because “Tiny Dancer” and “Levon” had yet to achieve evergreen status.\n\nPhotographer Terry O’Neill took the compilation’s front- and back-cover photos, which show the bespectacled singer at his piano in a white hat, suit, and bow tie.\n\nGreatest Hits reached No. 1 in the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. It peaked at No. 2 in New Zealand and No. 3 in Norway. The compilation has since certified Diamond in Canada (1,000,000), quintuple Platinum in Australia (250,000), and seventeen-times Platinum in the US (17,000,000).\n\n1975\n\nIn January 1975, MCA issued Empty Sky for the first time in North America. This version is housed in a blue gatefold with a sphinx-like caricature illustration by Belgian artist Jean Michel Folon, who also did cover art for The Great Lost Kinks Album and 1974 releases by James Vincent (Culmination) and Nelson Angelo. Six years after its UK DJM release, Empty Sky reached No. 30 in Canada and No. 6 on the Billboard 200.\n\nOn February 12, Elton John appeared on the pilot episode of Cher, a CBS variety show hosted by singer–entertainer Cher. They perform a duet rendition of “Bennie and the Jets” and act in a skit with comedian Flip Wilson where they imagine themselves in a retirement home in the year 2025 (fifty years in the future). Elton also plays piano on a medley of “Mockingbird,” “Proud Mary,” “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” and “Never Can Say Goodbye” — a duet between Cher and Bette Midler.\n\nElton appears in filmmaker Ken Russell’s 1975 musical Tommy, an adaptation of the 1969 rock opera by The Who. John plays the Pinball Wizard, who sings the namesake song as the film’s titular character (played by Who frontman Roger Daltrey) excels at pinball despite his limitations (“That deaf, dumb, and blind kid.. sure plays a mean pinball!”). The Elton John Band’s version of “Pinball Wizard” appears on the Tommy soundtrack, released in March 1975 on Polydor.\n\nElton also plays piano on three cuts (“Guru Banana,” “Circular Letter,” “Toujours La Voyage”) on Sweet Deciever, the March 1975 Island Records release by Soft Machine co-founder Kevin Ayers, who recently signed onto Reid’s management.\n\n“Philadelphia Freedom”\n\nOn February 24, 1975, Elton John released the standalone single “Philadelphia Freedom,” inspired by four-time US Open champ Billie Jean King. The b-side is the Beatles cover “I Saw Her Standing There,” recorded live with John Lennon at Madison Square Garden on November 28, 1974.\n\nJohn asked Taupin to write a song in honor of Jean King and her team, the Philadelphia Freedoms, a charter franchise of World Team Tennis. King — best known for her 1973 “Battle of the Sexes” victory over 1946–47 World No. 1 professional champ Bobby Riggs — recently founded the Women’s Tennis Association and the Women’s Sports Foundation.\n\nElton and his band recorded “Philadelphia Freedom” in August 1974 at Hollywood’s Sound Factory with Dudgeon and orchestrator Gene Page, who also arranged one track (“Something Lacking In Me”) on Olsson’s 1975 selft-titled second album (Rocket #PIG-2158). They held the session during a break from work on Elton’s ninth album at the Caribou Ranch.\n\n“Philadelphia Freedom” reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 2 in New Zealand, No. 4 in Australia, and No. 12 in the UK. In the US, the song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 32 on the publication’s R&B chart. TotP aired the song to a dance by Pan’s People on its March 13 and 27 broadcasts amid hits by 10cc (“Life Is a Minestrone”), Fox (“Only You Can”), Gloria Gaynor (“Reach Out, I’ll Be There”), the Kiki Dee Band (“(You Don’t Know) How Glad I Am”), and Sweet (“Fox On the Run”).\n\nOn May 17, 1975, Elton John became the first white performer to appear on the syndicated US R&M music variety program Soul Train, where he mimed “Philadelphia Freedom” and “Bennie and the Jets.”\n\n“Philadelphia Freedom” ranks No. 3 on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1975, behind hits by Captain & Tennille (“Love Will Keep Us Together”) and Glen Campbell (“Rhinestone Cowboy”) and just ahead of David Bowie (“Fame”), Earth, Wind & Fire (“Shining Star”), and two pre-Beatles singers in the midst of comebacks: Neil Sedaka (“Laughter In the Rain”) and Four Seasons frontman Frankie Valli (“My Eyes Adored You”).\n\nSedaka’s hit appeared stateside on the 1974 Rocket release Sedaka’s Back, a compilation of three UK longplayers, including the 10cc-backed 1972–73 albums Solitaire and The Tra-La Days Are Over. Like Elton, Sedaka was a pianist, composer, and singer who collaborated with lyricists. John sings uncredited backing vocals on “Bad Blood,” a Billboard and Cashbox No. 1 from Sedaka’s 1975 Rocket release Overnight Success, which also contains a Top 10 lounge remake of Neil’s 1962 No. 1 “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do.”\n\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\n\nElton John released his ninth album, Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, on May 19, 1975, on DJM and Uni. It’s a concept album with ten originals that chronicle the plight of Captain Fantastic (John) and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (Taupin) in the early years of their songwriting partnership. Taupin wrote the lyrics chronologically while John composed the music on a cross-sea voyage from London to New York.\n\nMusically, the album balances country (title track), cabaret (“Better Off Dead”), and ballads (“We All Fall in Love Sometimes”) with rock raunch (“(Gotta Get a) Meal Ticket”) and bouyant ivory-laden numbers (“Bitter Fingers”). Each side closes with a slow harmonized epic that unfolds to a grand climax.\n\n1. “Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy” (5:46)\n\n2. “Tower of Babel” (4:28)\n\n3. “Bitter Fingers” (4:35)\n\n4. “Tell Me When the Whistle Blows” (4:20)\n\n5. “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” (6:45)\n\n6. “(Gotta Get a) Meal Ticket” (4:01)\n\n7. “Better Off Dead” (2:37)\n\n8. “Writing” (3:40)\n\n9. “We All Fall in Love Sometimes” (4:15)\n\n10. “Curtains” (6:15)\n\nSessions occurred with Dudgeon in August 1974 at the Caribou Ranch, also used for Chicago VIII and concurrent albums by Joe Walsh, Chicago keyboardist Robert Lamm (Skinny Boy), and the collaborative disc by Mahavishnu Orchestra alumni Jerry Goodman and Jan Hammer (Like Children). Jeff Guercio (James William’s brother) engineered Captain Fantastic with assistance by third brother Mark Guercio. “Tell Me When the Whistle Blows” features orchestration by Gene Page.\n\nElton John plays grand piano on everything except “Whistle Blows” and “Writing,” which feature the Fender Rhodes electric piano, also heard on “Someone Saved My Life Tonight,” which also features John on the ARP String Ensemble. He plays clavinet on two tracks (“Whistle Blows,” “Meal Ticket”) and both harpsichord and Mellotron on the closing pair “We All Fall in Love Sometimes” and “Curtains,” which both feature Hentschel on ARP synthesizer.\n\nDavey Johnstone plays guitar throughout with select instances of mandolin (title track) and piano (“Writing”). Captain Fantastic is Elton’s last album for eight years with Murray and Olsson, who round out the rhythm section with Cooper, who plays assorted percussion, including gong and jawbone on the title track.\n\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is housed in an elaborate gatefold by illustrators Alan Aldridge and Harry Willock. The front shows Captain Fantastic — swarmed by birds, fish, amphibeans, and gargoyle-like critters — atop his piano, which tilts above a cottage in a soup bowl. The back shows the Brown Dirt Cowboy inside a crystal ball with “cute” animals (Maxine’s head appears on a bird’s body) and members of Elton’s band in smaller crystals amid the critters, who possibly represent unsavory industry characters that John and Taupin encountered in their career. The inner-gates contain blue-framed photos of the two and Elton’s five-piece band.\n\nOriginal copies include a poster-size version of the album art; a sixteen-page booklet of lyrics and pics; and a sixteen-page scrapbook of pics, press clippings, and a comic (four pages) titled The Life & Loves of Elton John.\n\nIn late June, DJM and MCA lifted “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” as the only Captain Fantastic single, backed with the non-album “House of Cards.” It reached No. 2 in Canada, No. 1 on the Cashbox Top 100 and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 1 in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. It also went Top 10 in Austria (No. 7), Finland (No. 10), Norway (No. 2), and Spain (No. 3). In the US, Captain Fantastic shipped Gold and became the first album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. It sold 1.4 million in its first four days (one year before the RIAA introduced Platinum certification) and held the No. 1 spot for seven weeks.\n\nCaptain Fantastic later certified Platinum in Canada (100,000), double-Platinum in Australia (100,000), and triple-Platinum in the US (3,000,000).\n\nJust prior to the June–July sessions for his next album, Elton replaced Murray and Olsson with American bassist Kenny Passarelli (of Joe Walsh’s Barnstorm) and returning drummer Roger Pope (of the now-defunct Hookfoot). He also hired American James Newton Howard (ex-Mama Lion) as his keyboardist and orchestral conductor. Pope’s colleague Caleb Quaye joined as rhythm guitarist.\n\nElton and the band played a June 21 show at Wembley Stadium, supported by the Beach Boys, Eagles, Joe Walsh, Rufus, and Stackridge, a Kinks-like vaudevillian pop band that signed to Rocket for their 1975 fourth album Extravaganza.\n\nElton played select summer dates, including a June 29 show at Oakland Coliseum with the Doobie Brothers. On July 19, Elton joined the Rolling Stones onstage at Hughes Stadium in Fort Collins, Colorado. He initially joined them to play on “Honky Tonk Women” but remained onstage throughout the show.\n\nOn July 24, Elton and his band played the 2nd Festival Van De Gouden Leeuw, a two-day event in Blankenberge, Belgium, with sets by Kiki Dee, Leo Sayer, Maggie Bell, Rory Gallagher, and assorted French and Belgian acts, including Joe Dassin and Koen De Bruyne.\n\nIn August, Elton marked the fifth anniversary of his US Troubador debut with a three-night engagement at the Hollywood venue (25–27), supported by Kiki Dee.\n\nRock of the Westies\n\nElton John released his tenth album, Rock of the Westies, on October 4, 1975, on DJM and Uni. It contains six songs credited to John–Taupin and a seventh (“Hard Luck Story”) credited to ‘Ann Orson’ and ‘Carte Blanche’ (female pseudonyms for the pair). Johnstone helped them write two songs: the three-part medley “Yell Help” and the uptempo rocker “Grow Some Funk of Your Own.”\n\n1. “Medley: Yell Help / Wednesday Night / Ugly” (John, Davey Johnstone, Taupin) (6:15)\n\n2. “Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)” (3:29)\n\n3. “Island Girl” (3:42)\n\n4. “Grow Some Funk of Your Own” (4:47)\n\n5. “I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford)” (5:27)\n\n1. “Street Kids” (6:25)\n\n2. “Hard Luck Story” (5:16)\n\n3. “Feed Me” (4:00)\n\n4. “Billy Bones and the White Bird” (4:25)\n\nRock of the Westies is Elton’s third consecutive album recorded at the Caribou Ranch, used concurrently by Earth Wind & Fire (That’s the Way of the World) and Frank Zappa. Sessions occurred in June–July 1975 with Jeff and Mark Guercio. Gus Dudgeon produced Westies in succession with 1975 albums by Howard Werth & The Moonbeams and Solution, a Dutch jazz-rock band that signed to Rocket for their third album, Cordon Bleu.\n\nJohn restricts himself on Westies to vocals and piano, which he plays on every track except “Feed Me.” Newton Howard plays electric piano on five tracks; synthesizers on three (“Grow Some Funk,” “Robert Ford,” “Billy Bones”); Hohner clavinet on the first two songs and Mellotron on “Island Girl.” On the medley, he also plays harpsichord, ARP synthesizer, and Elka Rhapsody string synthesizer.\n\nJohnstone and Quaye double on acoustic guitar on two tracks (“Grow Some Funk,” “Robert Ford”) and double on electric on six. One exception is “Street Kids,” while Johnstone plays slide while Quaye plays electric rhythm and lead. Cooper’s arsenal includes marimba (“Island Girl”), tympani (“Billy Bones”), and vibraphone (“Grow Some Funk,” “Robert Ford,” “Feed Me”).\n\nLabelle guest as backing vocalists on the medley. Clive Franks does likewise on “Feed Me.” Kiki Dee sings backup on seven tracks while Elton (under his Ann Orson alter ego) overdubs himself on six.\n\nRock of the Westies is housed in a Larkham-designed single sleeve with ranch-bound photographs by Terry O’Neill that show Elton close-up (front), Bernie and the band (back), and individual pics of John, Taupin, and the six musicians (inner sleeve). Original copies contain a two-fold lyrical insert. DJM copies replicate the headshots on the LP labels.\n\nIn late September, DJM lifted “Island Girl” as a single, backed with the non-album Kiki Dee cover “Sugar on the Floor,” the closing track on Loving and Free. It went Top 20 in the UK and Australia and reached No. 4 in Canada and New Zealand.\n\nIn the US, “Island Girl” reached No. 1 on the Cashbox Top 100 and (for three weeks) the Billboard Hot 100, where it unseated Sedaka’s “Bad Blood.” It debuted on Billboard after a one-week break in Elton’s 25-month streak on the Hot 100 (a record topped only by Pat Boone).\n\nTotP aired “Island Girl” to a dance segment by Pan’s People on its October 16 broadcast, which also featured hits by ABBA (“S.O.S.”), The Chi-lites (“It’s Time for Love”), David Essex (“Hold Me Close”), Esther Phillips (“What a Difference a Day Made”), Justin Hayward & John Lodge (“Blue Guitar”), and The Trammps (“Hold Back the Night”).\n\nRock of the Westies reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 5 in the UK, and No. 4 in Australia and New Zealand. It went Top 10 in Denmark (No. 3), Norway (No. 6), Spain (No. 8), and Sweden (No. 6). In the US, Westies became his seventh and final No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. It later certified Platinum in the US, Canada, and Australia.\n\nElton and his new band (Johnstone, Quaye, Passarelli, Pope, Cooper, Newton Howard) embarked on a sixteen-date, eleven-city US tour with backing vocalists Cindy Bullens, Jon Joyce, and Ken Gold. The tour commenced on September 29 at the San Diego Sports Arena and wrapped two nights (October 25–26) at LA’s Dodger Stadium, where they were joined onstage by Billie Jean King and the James Cleveland Choir.\n\n1976\n\nIn January 1976, “Grow Some Funk of Your Own” reappeared as the second Rock of the Westies single, backed with “I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford).” It reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn March, Polydor lifted “Pinball Wizard” from the Tommy soundtrack as a single, backed with the Yellow Brick Road track “Harmony.” Elton’s cover of The Who classic reached No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThat spring, John Reid played Elton three songs from a just-recorded album by an EMI artist with no American label. One of the songs, “Devil Woman,” was written by ex-Twilights guitarist Terry Britten and ex-Family Dogg singer Christine Holmes, who first recorded it under her solo stagename Kristine Sparkle. Elton agreed to sign the mystery artist to Rocket for the US market. To his surprise, he discovered the singer was Cliff Richard, one of Elton’s boyhood idols. Cliff’s debut Rocket release, I’m Nearly Famous, appeared in May 1976 and signaled the singer’s career renaissance. “Devil Woman” became the former British teen idol’s first ever American Top 10 hit.\n\nMeanwhile, Elton became club chairman of Watford F.C., a then-Fourth Division football club from Watford, Hetfordshire, that John (a lifelong fan) intended to lift to First Division (a goal achieved in the 1981–82 season).\n\nHere and There\n\nOn April 30, 1976, DJM and MCA released Here and There, Elton’s second live album, sourced from two 1974 shows: the 5/18/74 children’s benefit at Royal Festival Hall and the 11/24/74 show (with guest John Lennon) at Madison Square Garden. The title refers to the transatlantic cities: Here (London, Side One) and There (New York, Side Two).\n\nHere contains renditions of one song each from Empty Sky (“Skyline Pigeon”), Elton John (“Border Song”), Tumbleweed (“Love Song”), Honky Château (“Honky Cat”), and Don’t Shoot Me (“Crocodile Rock”). There contains one songs from Honky (“Rocket Man”), two from Yellow Brick Road (“Bennie and the Jets,” “Funeral for a Friend”), and the early staple “Take Me to the Pilot.”\n\n1. “Skyline Pigeon” (4:34)\n\n2. “Border Song” (3:18)\n\n3. “Honky Cat” (7:15)\n\n4. “Love Song” (5:25)\n\n5. “Crocodile Rock” (4:15)\n\n1. “Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding” (11:11)\n\n2. “Rocket Man (I Think It’s Going to Be a Long, Long Time)” (5:12)\n\n3. “Bennie and the Jets” (6:09)\n\n4. “Take Me to the Pilot” (5:48)\n\nBoth sides feature the Elton Band’s 1974 lineup: Davey Johnstone, Dee Murray, Nigel Olsson, and Ray Cooper. “Love Song” features a guest appearance by its co-writer, Lesley Duncan. Dudgeon produced and engineered Here and There with concert soundman Phil Dunne.\n\nPhotographer David Nutter took the album’s cover images, which show Elton’s black grand piano (front) and Elton himself in a mink scarf and trench coat perched atop the piano (back). The inner-sleeve contains of photo of his band’s equipment with Olsson’s customized kick-drum (DRUMORK) and liner notes by Paul Gambaccini.\n\nHere and There reached No. 6 in the UK, No. 3 in New Zealand, and No. 4 on the Billboard 200.\n\nElton and his Westies backing band (Johnstone, Quaye, Passarelli, Pope, Cooper, Newton Howard) and live vocal trio (Bullens, Gold, Joyce) embarked on the Lounder Than Concorde Tour, and five-week, 21-city UK jaunt that started with an April 29–30 engagement at the Grand Theatre in Leeds and wrapped with a June 3–4 showcase at the Capitol Theatre in Cardiff, Wales.\n\n“Don’t Go Breaking My Heart”\n\nOn June 21, 1976, Elton John released “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” a duet with Kiki Dee, backed with “Snow Queen.”\n\nJohn and Taupin co-wrote “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” under their pseudonyms Ann Orson and Carte Blanche (also used on “Hard Luck Story”). They selected Dee after their first choice, Dusty Springfield, proved too ill to duet with John. “Snow Queen” is joint-credited to John, Taupin, Dee, Johnstone, and photographer David Nutter.\n\nJohn plays electric piano on “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” which features five-sixths of his Westies backing band (Quaye, Passarelli, Pope, Cooper, Newton Howard) with uncredited backing vocals by Bullens, Gold, and Joyce. Dudgeon and crew produced the song on March 27 during a break between sessions for Elton’s next album.\n\nIn the video, Elton (plaid leisure suit) leads Kiki (peach overalls) into a soft-lit studio where the two trade-off at the mic.\n\n“Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” reached No. 1 on the UK Singles chart and held that spot for six weeks in the summer of 1976. It also reached No. 1 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia, Ireland, and France. “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” made the Top 3 in Belgium, Sweden, and the Netherlands. In Switzerland and Germany, the song peaked at No. 4 and 5, respectively.\n\nTop of the Pops first aired the video on the program’s July 8 broadcast and reaired it a fortnight later amid hits by 5000 Volts (“Dr. Kiss Kiss”), Billy Ocean (“L.O.D. (Love on Delivery)”), Candi Staton (“Young Hearts Run Free”), Dorothy Moore (“Misty Blue”), Isley Brothers (“Harvest for the World”), The Real Thing (“You to Me Are Everything”), Steve Harley (“Here Comes the Sun”), and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band (“The Boston Tea Party”).\n\nTotP then reaired it weekly from July 29 and August 26 amid summer hits by ABBA (“Dancing Queen”), Bryan Ferry (“The Price of Love”), Cliff Richard (“I Can’t Ask for Anything More Than You”), David Dundas (“Jeans On”), The Equals (“Funky Like a Train”), Hot Chocolate (“Heaven Is on the Back Seat of My Cadillac”), Lou Rawls (“You’ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine”), Manfred Mann’s Earth Band (“Blinded By the Light”), Slik (“The Kid’s a Punk”), Tavares (“Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel”), Thin Lizzy (“Jailbreak”), and Wings (“Let ‘Em In”).\n\nSelect airings set “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” to a skit by the TotP in-house dance troupe Ruby Flipper.\n\n“Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 66 on the week of July 4, 1976, the US Bicentennial. On the week of August 7, it overtook “Kiss and Say Goodbye” by The Manhattans as the No. 1 song in the US. It held that spot for four weeks, then bowed down for “You Should Be Dancing” by the Bee Gees. The song also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\n“Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” ranks No. 2 on the 1976 Year-End Singles charts in the UK (behind “Save Your Kisses for Me” by the Brotherhood of Man), New Zealand (behind “Fernando” by ABBA), and the US (behind “Silly Love Songs” by Paul McCartney & Wings). This marked Elton’s second consecutive Top 3 Billboard Year-End placement. “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” was Elton’s sixth and final Billboard No. 1 (barring his involvement in Dionne & Friends).\n\nThe song’s success elevated Dee’s profile after the non-release of Cage the Songbird, her intended 1976 album that got shelved after the chart-stall of its late-1975 advance single “Once a Fool”.\n\nLouder Than Concorde Tour (US)\n\nOn June 29, 1976, as “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” began its chart runs worldwide, Elton and his band launched a sixteen-city US tour dubbed ‘Louder Than Concorde (But Not Quite as Pretty).’ It commenced with a two-nighter at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, and wrapped in mid-August in New York City, where he played seven nights (Aug. 10–13 and 15–17) at Madison Square Garden, followed by the Aug. 18 multi-bill (with Bonnie Riatt and Muddy Waters) of the summer-long Schaefer Music Festival at Wollman Rink in Central Park. These would be his last US shows for three years.\n\nAfter the 8/17 Madison Square Garden show, Elton told Rolling Stone reporter Cliff Jahr “My life in the last six years has been a Disney film and now I have to have a person in my life.” Jahr offered to pause the tape but John declined, then added “I’ve never talked about this before… I haven’t met anybody that I would like to settle down with — of either sex.” The three-page interview appears in the October 7, 1976, issue of Rolling Stone (No. 223), which features John on the cover, reclined in a Watford F.C. sweater beside the headline “Elton’s Frank Talk: The Lonely Love Life of a Superstar.”\n\nOn September 17, Elton played an eighteen-song set at the Edinburgh Playhouse. He started the show with four numbers from his self-titled second album (“I Need You to Turn To,” “Sixty Years On,” “Border Song,” “The Greatest Discovery”) and included a mid-set sequence of recent ballads: “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” “Someone Saved My Life Tonight,” and a new number, “Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word.”\n\nBlue Moves\n\nElton John released his eleventh album, Blue Moves, on October 22, 1976, on MCA and Rocket. It’s his second studio double-album (after Goodbye Yellow Brick Road) with twelve John–Taupin numbers and five tracks with additional input from Johnstone (“Cage the Songbird,” “If There’s a God in Heaven (What’s He Waiting For?)”), Quaye (“Boogie Pilgrim”), Howard (“One Horse Town”), and all three (“The Wide Eyed and Laughing”).\n\nBlue Moves contains two instrumental interludes: “Your Starter For…” (by Quaye) and “Theme From a Non-Existent TV Series,” plus the orchestral epic “Out of the Blue” (wordless but co-credited to Taupin). This is the second of two albums with the six-piece Elton John Band lineup of Westies and the Louder Than Concorde tours (Johnstone, Quaye, Passarelli, Pope, Cooper, Newton Howard).\n\nBlue Moves was Elton’s last album with producer Gus Dudgeon barring their mid-eighties reunion. This is the first of his albums on Rocket Record, t"
