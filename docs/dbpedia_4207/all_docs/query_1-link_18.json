        "text": "Elton John (born March 25, 1947) is an English vocalist, pianist, songwriter, and philanthropist with a career stretching back to the mid-1960s. He achieved global stardom with his self-titled second album in 1970. Since that time, he has recorded more than 30 albums and scored numerous hits that have gained evergreen status around the world.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJohn was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on March 25, 1947, in Pinner, Middlesex, England. His father, a Royal Air Force flight lieutenant, was a trumpeter in the Bob Millar Band, which played military dances. The Dwight‚Äôs were avid record buyers, raising Reginald on the popular music of the day. He knew he wanted to be a musician after hearing the early rock n‚Äô roll hits of Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nDwight took up piano as a small child, leaning to play pieces like Waldteufel‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Skater‚Äôs Waltz‚Äù by ear. He started taking formal piano lessons at age seven. By age 11, he won a junior scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. According to one professor, Dwight recited the entirety of a lengthy Handel piece after hearing it once.[1] He attended the academy for five years, singing in the Saturday choir and mastering the works of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nThe Dwight‚Äôs divorced when Reginald was 14. He moved with his mother and her new husband into a flat on Frome Court, where he remained until he hit paydirt in the states. Around this time, he got a four-nights-weekly pianist residency at the Northwood Hills Hotel. Though normal-sighted, he started wearing horn-rimmed glasses in emulation of Buddy Holly.\n\nBluesology\n\nIn 1962, Dwight formed Bluesology with his neighbor, guitarist Stewart ‚ÄúStu‚Äù Brown. After some months on the local pub circuit, they scored a weekly residency at London‚Äôs Establishment Club with a setlist comprised of blues standards by Muddy Waters, Jimmy Witherspoon, and Memphis Slim.\n\nIn 1965, Bluesology signed with an agency that sent them on tour as the UK backing band for visiting American acts, including The Isley Brothers, Doris Troy, Billy Stewart, and Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles. In July, Bluesology debuted with the Dwight original ‚ÄúCome Back, Baby‚Äù (b/w the Witherspoon cover ‚ÄúTimes Getting Tougher Than Tough‚Äù), followed in November with the Dwight original ‚ÄúMr. Frantic‚Äù (b/w the Slim cover ‚ÄúEveryday (I Have the Blues)‚Äù). Both singles appeared on Fontana; the second features an uncredited early appearance by guitarist Bernie Holland, who later surfaced in Jody Grind, Stealers Wheel, and Hummingbird.\n\nBluesology expanded to a brass-integrated sextet for a German tour behind American soulster Major Lance. In late 1966, they linked with English blues singer Long John Baldry. Dwight and Brown were the only original members in a lineup that now included (future Soft Machine) saxophonist Elton Dean and (future Juicy Lucy) guitarist Neil Hubbard.\n\nIn May 1967, Dwight deputized Simon Dupree & the Big Sound keyboardist Eric Hine on two dates in Scotland. In October, Bluesology signed to Polydor (as Stu Brown & Bluesology) for their third single: ‚ÄúSince I Found You Baby,‚Äù a brassy mid-tempo soul-pop number by veteran English entertainer Kenny Lynch, who co-wrote the b-side (‚ÄúJust a Little Bit‚Äù) with American songwriter Mort Shuman.\n\nIn late 1967, Dwight left Bluesology and pursued a songwriting career. He answered an ad in the New Musical Express placed by Liberty records A&R Ray Williams, who introduced Dwight to another respondent, lyricist Bernie Taupin. Dwight and Taupin began a songwriting partnership that would span more than fifty years. Their first completed song was the September 1967 demo ‚ÄúScarecrow.‚Äù Later that year, Dwight adopted the professional name Elton John, derived from his ex-bandmates Elton Dean and Long John Baldry.\n\n1968\n\nIn 1968, Elton John and Bernie Taupin became staff writers for Dick James Music (DJM), a publishing company established by English music mogul Dick James (1920‚Äì1986). At DJM, John‚ÄìTaupin wrote songs for assorted pop performers, including Scottish singer Lulu, who recorded their composition ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Go On (Living Without You),‚Äù the sixth runner-up to the UK entry in the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAs a sessionist, John plays piano on ‚ÄúAn Olympic Record,‚Äù a 1968 Columbia a-side by pop parodists The Barron Knights. He sings backing vocals on one side (‚ÄúLily the Pink‚Äù) by Scaffold, a folk-comedy trio with Mike McGear (aka Peter McCartney, the younger brother of Paul McCartney). Elton plays and sings backup on ‚ÄúDelilah,‚Äù a 1968 global chart-topper by Tom Jones.\n\nRegimental Sgt Zippo\n\nBetween November 1967 and May 1968, John recorded his first round of Taupin co-writes at Dick James Studios in London. The intended album ‚Äî shelved in favor of his proper debut Empty Sky ‚Äî appeared fifty-three years after its completion as Regimental Sgt Zippo. It contains twelve psych-tinged originals: ten John‚ÄìTaupin numbers and two (‚ÄúSitting Doing Nothing,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Be Sorry to See Me Go‚Äù) co-written by DJM session guitarist Caleb Quaye, a late-period Bluesology member who recently cut the Philips psych single ‚ÄúBaby Your Phrasing Is Bad‚Äù (b/w ‚ÄúA Woman of Distinction‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúWhen I Was Tealby Abbey‚Äù (2:35)\n\n‚ÄúAnd the Clock Goes Round‚Äù (3:06)\n\n‚ÄúSitting Doing Nothing‚Äù (2:30)\n\n‚ÄúTurn to Me‚Äù (3:16)\n\n‚ÄúAngel Tree‚Äù (2:04)\n\n‚ÄúRegimental Sgt. Zippo‚Äù (4:44)\n\n‚ÄúA Dandelion Dies in the Wind‚Äù (3:14)\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Be Sorry to See Me Go‚Äù (2:34)\n\n‚ÄúNina‚Äù (3:50)\n\n‚ÄúTartan Coloured Lady‚Äù (4:09)\n\n‚ÄúHourglass‚Äù (2:44)\n\n‚ÄúWatching the Planes Go By‚Äù (4:07)\n\nElton plays organ and piano (grand and electric), plus harpsichord on Regimental Sgt Zippo, which features Quaye on acoustic and electric guitars, flute, percussion, and backing vocals. Two recent members of psychsters The Mirage ‚Äî bassist Dee Murray (a brief Spencer Davis Group player) and drummer Dave Hynes ‚Äî round out Elton‚Äôs studio band.\n\nQuaye produced the songs, which feature select backing by the Paul Fenoulhet Orchestra, conducted by Fenoulhet (1906‚Äì1979) of the WWII-era Skyrockets Dance Orchestra. The engineer, Frank Owen, worked beforehand with the Isle of Wight Cherokees, a precursor to Aubrey Small. Zack Laurence, a veteran Parlophone jazz-pop composer, handles orchestral arrangements.\n\nRegimental Sgt Zippo appeared in 2021 in a vintage psychedelic sleeve that depicts young Elton from multiple angles, engulfed in swirls and enhanced with three colors: mustard, magenta, and turquoise.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Loving You‚Äù\n\nIn March 1968, John released his debut solo single, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Loving You,‚Äù a Taupin co-credited number backed with the Elton lone-write ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to the Next Time.‚Äù Quaye produced the single, which appeared in limited quantity on Philips (UK only). Despite the label info, Elton lone-wrote ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Loving You.‚Äù All subsequent originals (through 1976) are genuine John‚ÄìTaupin compositions.\n\nIn Portugal, Philips issued ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Loving You‚Äù as a maxi-single with one track from the Sgt Zippo sessions (‚ÄúAngel Tree‚Äù) and the 1968 Dick James demo ‚ÄúThank You For All Your Loving.‚Äù\n\n1969\n\nIn February 1969, Decca Records issued a single by the Bead and Beer Band titled ‚ÄúDick Barton Theme (The Devil‚Äôs Gallop),‚Äù a cover of the 1946 theme by British composer Charles Williams to the BBC Light Programme serial Dick Barton ‚Äì Special Agent. The Bread and Beer Band was a studio project by Elton, Caleb Quaye, and Hollies bassist Bernie Calvert. They wrote the b-side, ‚ÄúBreakdown Blues,‚Äù with one Lennox Jackson.\n\nJohn continued as a sessionist with piano credits on 1969 singles by Scaffold (‚ÄúGin Gan Goolie‚Äù) and Family Dogg (‚ÄúA Way of Life‚Äù). He sings backing vocals on both sides of the November CBS release ‚ÄúGood To Be Alive‚Äù (‚ÄúSame Old Story‚Äù), the third single by fifteen-year-old singer Tina Charles, a future UK disco-pop star.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon Dupree & the Big Sound covered the John‚ÄìTaupin number ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going Home.‚Äù John plays piano on ‚ÄúGive It All Back,‚Äù the b-side of the November 1969 Parlophone single ‚ÄúThe Eagle Flies Tonight,‚Äù the final Big Sound release. Upon their breakup, Big Sound leaders the Shulman brothers considered John as a possible keyboardist‚Äìsinger for their new band, Gentle Giant, but they revoked the invitation after they heard his debut album.\n\nElton made his second appearance on a global hit with ‚ÄúHe Ain‚Äôt Heavy, He‚Äôs My Brother,‚Äù the September 1969 standalone single by The Hollies. He sings and plays piano on the gospel-tinged ballad, which reached No. 3 in the UK and Irish singles charts and No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100. John also plays on the September 1969 DJM single ‚ÄúMr. Boyd‚Äù (b/w ‚ÄúImagine‚Äù) by Argosy, the starting vehicle of musician‚Äìsinger Roger Hodgson, the soon-to-be co-frontman of Supertramp.\n\n‚ÄúLady Samantha‚Äù\n\nIn January 1969, John issued his second Philips single, ‚ÄúLady Samantha‚Äù (b/w ‚ÄúAll Across the Havens‚Äù). Both sides were recorded the prior month at DJM Studios and produced by Steve Brown. The songs were performed during Elton‚Äôs first BBC Radio broadcast (10/28/68) but soon dropped from his setlist.\n\nElton is backed on ‚ÄúLady Samantha‚Äù by Quaye, bassist Tony Murray, and drummer Roger Pope. Murray played concurrently in Plastic Penny, a pop-psych band that made two 1968‚Äì69 albums on Page One. Their second (Currency) contains a cover of the unheard Sgt Zippo number ‚ÄúTurn to Me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Me That You Need‚Äù\n\nOn May 16, 1969, Elton released his third single, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Me That You Need,‚Äù a swelling John‚ÄìTaupin ballad backed with the mid-tempo rustic rocker ‚ÄúJust Like Strange Rain.‚Äù\n\nJohn recorded both sides with Brown in April at Olympic Studios. He‚Äôs backed on the single by Quaye, Pope, and DJM studio engineer Clive Franks, who plays bass on ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Me That You Need,‚Äù which features strings conducted by Cy Payne, an arranger on recent recordings by The Idle Race, Kate, The Barrier, and select North American acts (Harper and Rowe, The Guess Who).\n\nThis was the fifth release on DJM Records (DJS 205), which issued the single in the UK and Italy. Elsewhere, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Me That You Need‚Äù appeared on Fontana (France) and Philips (Singapoe).\n\nIn 1971, DJM issued ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Me That You Need‚Äù in Japan, where it reached No. 2 on the Oricon International Singles Chart.\n\nEmpty Sky\n\nElton John released his debut album, Empty Sky, on June 6, 1969, on DJM. It features nine John‚ÄìTaupin originals, including ‚ÄúHymn 2000,‚Äù ‚ÄúWestern Ford Gateway,‚Äù ‚ÄúSkyline Pigeon,‚Äù and ‚ÄúVal-Hala.‚Äù The album opens with the titular ‚ÄúEmpty Sky,‚Äù his second-longest studio original. Empty Sky closes with the lengthy three-part medley ‚ÄúGulliver ‚Äì Hay Chewed ‚Äì Reprise.‚Äù\n\n1. ‚ÄúEmpty Sky‚Äù (8:29)\n\n2. ‚ÄúVal-Hala‚Äù (4:11)\n\n3. ‚ÄúWestern Ford Gateway‚Äù (3:15)\n\n4. ‚ÄúHymn 2000‚Äù (4:29)\n\n1. ‚ÄúLady What‚Äôs Tomorrow‚Äù (3:09)\n\n2. ‚ÄúSails‚Äù (3:45)\n\n3. ‚ÄúThe Scaffold‚Äù (3:18)\n\n4. ‚ÄúSkyline Pigeon‚Äù (3:37)\n\n5. ‚ÄúGulliver ‚Äì Hay Chewed ‚Äì Reprise‚Äù (6:58)\n\nSessions took place between November 1968 and April 1969 at Dick James Studios. Elton plays Hohner Pianet and harpsichord in addition to piano and organ on Empty Sky, which features Quaye, Pope, and Murray. Quaye and Pope recently formed the band Hookfoot with fellow DJM sessionists but their first-recorded album (A Piece of Pye) wound up shelved for four decades.\n\nOne track (‚ÄúLady What‚Äôs Tomorrow‚Äù) features Murray‚Äôs Plastic Penny bandmate, drummer Nigel Olsson. Select passages feature saxophonist Don Fay, a recent backer of bluesman Errol Dixon. Harpist Graham Vickery of Pye blues-rockers Shakey Vick also appears on the album.\n\nDJM music coordinator Steve Brown produced Empty Sky, which Frank Owen engineered in sequence with As I Am, the singular solo album by Troggs guitarist Chris Britton. Clive Franks, the tape operator on Empty Sky, is credited with ‚Äúwhistling.‚Äù\n\nEmpty Sky is housed in a gatefold designed by Dave Larkham. The front depicts a line-enhanced blue-scale Elton against a cloudy backdrop. The inner-gates have light blue-scale images of him and Bernie behind a wall of lyrics. The back has white text on purple with credits and liner notes by Tony Brandon and David Symonds (both pictured). Symonds writes that Elton ‚Äúdoes not confine himself to the brighter side of life. The runcible has since changed to the smouldering crucible of a million injustices.‚Äù (Runcible is a nonsense word invented by English Victorian author Edward Lear as a whimsical adjective for objects.)\n\nEmpty Sky first appeared in the UK and South Africa. DJM later issued the album in Japan (1970), Oceania and Italy (1972), and Germany and Mexico (1975). In the US, Empty Sky remained unavailable until January 1975 when MCA released to capitalize on Elton‚Äôs transatlantic stardom.\n\n1970\n\nElton John formed his first backing band with Olsson and Dee Murray. He performed his first show as Elton John on March 25, 1970, at the Revolution Club, a rock hotspot in Bruton Place, Mayfair, in central London. On April 7, he played the Roundhouse, a converted railway shed in Chalk Farm that ushered London‚Äôs psychedelic boom.\n\nAs a sessionist, Elton backed Tom Jones on the singer‚Äôs 1970 cover of ‚ÄúI Who Have Nothing,‚Äù a 1963 Leiber‚ÄìStoller song first recorded by Ben E. King. He also plays on the 1970 DJM single ‚ÄúHave You Seen Your Savior‚Äù (b/w ‚ÄúWhite Line Road‚Äù) by Scottish posters My Dear Watson. He appears on one track (‚ÄúJust a Day‚Äù) on the 1970 Vertigo release From Home to Home by Fairfield Parlour, a folk-psyh mutation of Kaleidoscope. Elton also earned two 1970 credits behind The Hollies: their March 1970 a-side ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Tell the Bottom From the Top‚Äù and one track (‚ÄúPerfect Lady Housewife‚Äù) on their November Parlophone release Confessions of the Mind (issued stateside as Moving Finger).\n\nElton sings ‚ÄúFrom Denver to L.A,‚Äù a co-write between Hal Shaper and French film composer Francis Lai for the 1970 British sports drama The Games starring Michael Crawford and Ryan O‚ÄôNeal. American small-press Viking issued the song as a mono / stereo promo single with the singer credited as ‚ÄòElton Johns.‚Äô\n\nIsland Records initially booked Elton as a vocalist on the winter‚Äìspring 1970 sessions for In the Wake of Poseidon, the second album by King Crimson. However, KC bandleader Robert Fripp nixed the proposal.\n\nElton John\n\nElton John released his self-titled second album on April 10, 1970, on DJM (UK) and Uni (US). It features ten John‚ÄìTaupin originals, including ‚ÄúThe King Must Die,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Greatest Discovery,‚Äù ‚ÄúFirst Episode at Hienton,‚Äù ‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot,‚Äù the much-covered ‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù and the singer‚Äôs international breakthrough hit ‚ÄúYour Song.‚Äù\n\n1. ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù (4:04)\n\n2. ‚ÄúI Need You to Turn To‚Äù (2:32)\n\n3. ‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot‚Äù (3:46)\n\n4. ‚ÄúNo Shoe Strings on Louise‚Äù (3:31)\n\n5. ‚ÄúFirst Episode at Hienton‚Äù (4:48)\n\n6. ‚ÄúSixty Years On‚Äù (4:35)\n\n7. ‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù (3:22)\n\n8. ‚ÄúThe Greatest Discovery‚Äù (4:12)\n\n9. ‚ÄúThe Cage‚Äù (3:28)\n\n10. ‚ÄúThe King Must Die‚Äù (5:21)\n\nElton John is the singer‚Äôs first of fourteen albums produced by Gus Dudgeon. Trident staffer Robin Geoffrey Cable engineered this and Elton‚Äôs subsequent three albums. This also marks Elton‚Äôs first of nine pairings with string conductor Paul Buckmaster, who recently arranged singles by Locomotive and David Bowie (‚ÄúSpace Oddity‚Äù). Buckmaster himself performs the cello solo on ‚ÄúThe Greatest Discovery.‚Äù Steve Brown reappears as ‚Äòproduction coordinator.‚Äô\n\nElton plays harpsichord on ‚ÄúI Need You to Turn To‚Äù and piano throughout the album, which also features organist Brian Dee (‚ÄúSixty Years On,‚Äù ‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù) and Moog synthesizer by Buckmaster‚Äôs wife Diana Lewis (‚ÄúFirst Episode at Hienton,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Cage‚Äù).\n\nFour songs (‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Shoe Strings on Louise,‚Äù ‚ÄúBorder Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Cage‚Äù) feature a six-piece studio choir with members of Blue Mink (Madeline Bell, Roger Cook), Edison Lighthouse (Tony Burrows), The Ladybirds (Kay Garner), and singer‚Äìsongwriters Lesley Duncan and Tony Hazzard.\n\nElton John features five guitarists: mainly Clive Hicks (six tracks) and Quaye (four), plus Colin Green (Spanish guitar on ‚ÄúSixty Years On‚Äù), Roland Harker (‚ÄúI Need You to Turn To‚Äù), and Rumplestiltskin member Alan Parker (‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot‚Äù). Clark, Green, and Hicks all play on ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Song.‚Äù Colin, Kay, and Belle would all partake in the 1972 Rediffusion project The Seven Ages of Man.\n\nThe album has three bassists: Dave Richmond (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúBorder Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Greatest Discovery‚Äù), Alan Weighall (‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Shoe Strings on Louise,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Cage‚Äù), and Les Hurdle (‚ÄúThe King Must Die‚Äù). Richmond, a founding member of Manfred Mann, also plays on 1969‚Äì70 albums by Scott Walker and Bread Love and Dreams (Strange Tale of Captain Shannon and the Hunchback from Gigha).\n\nBlue Mink‚Äôs Barry Morgan drums on five tracks; Pentangle‚Äòs Terry Cox drums on ‚ÄúThe Greatest Discovery‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe King Must Die.‚Äù Harpist Skaila Kanga, a sessionist on James Taylor‚Äôs first album, plays on ‚ÄúI Need You to Turn To‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Greatest Discovery.‚Äù\n\nOriginal UK copies of Elton John are housed in a matte, textured gatefold sleeve designed by Larkham with photography by Stowell Stanford. It shows Elton‚Äôs shaded, half-visible profile (front), a lyric spread with titles in pink Blackletter font (inner-gates), and a side-to-side photo of the core creative team (Lewis, Buckmaster, John, Taupin, Dudgeon, Quaye, Brown).\n\nDJM lifted ‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù as an advance single on March 20, 1970, backed with the non-album ‚ÄúBad Side of the Moon.‚Äù Elton mimed ‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù on the April 2 broadcast of the BBC music program Top of the Pops, which aired it amid current hits by Juicy Lucy (‚ÄúWho Do You Love?‚Äù), Slade (‚ÄúShape of Things‚Äù), Tom & Dusty Springfield (‚ÄúMorning Please Don‚Äôt Come‚Äù), and Rufus Thomas (‚ÄúDo the Funky Chicken‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù first appeared in the US on the Congress label and reappeared in July on Uni. It cracked the Billboard Hot 100 at 92. In Canada, the song reached No. 35. Aretha Franklin covered the song as an October 1970 Atlantic a-side (parenthetically subtitled ‚ÄúHoly Moses‚Äù). Her version reached No. 23 on the Cashbox Top 100 and reappeared on her 1972 album Young, Gifted and Black. The 5th Dimension cover ‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù on their 1972 album Individually & Collectively. Solomon Burke combines ‚ÄúYour Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúBorder Song,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot‚Äù in a short medley (3:17) titled ‚ÄúThree Psalms of Elton‚Äù on his 1971 MGM release Electronic Magnetism.\n\nToe Fat cover ‚ÄúBad Side of the Moon‚Äù on their 1970 second album Toe Fat Two. Canadian rockers April Wine cover the song on their 1972 second album On Record.\n\nElton promoted the album with an April 21 appearance at Pop Proms 1970, a week-long concert series hosted by Radio One DJ John Peel with sets by Bronco, Fleetwood Mac, Fotheringay, Ginger Baker‚Äôs Air Force, If, Jody Grind, Mighty Baby, Mott the Hoople, Quintessence, and Traffic. John played on Day 2 (Tuesday) along with T. Rex and The Pretty Things. He played four documented May UK shows and had the June 5 headline slot at London‚Äôs Marquee Club.\n\nElton John peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart. It also reached No. 4 in Canada and No. 2 in Australia and Denmark.\n\n‚ÄúRock and Roll Madonna‚Äù\n\nOn June 19, Elton John released the non-album single ‚ÄúRock and Roll Madonna,‚Äù a 12-bar guitar‚Äìpiano boogie. Quaye, Pope, and Hookfoot bassist Dave Glover play on the track. The b-side, ‚ÄúGrey Seal,‚Äù is a mid-tempo ballad with sparse piano‚Äìvocal verses and a swelling, orchestrated chorus.\n\n‚ÄúRock and Roll Madonna‚Äù remained a non-album track outside of Germany, where Hansa placed it as the opening track on Elton John in lieu of ‚ÄúI Need You to Turn To.‚Äù\n\nIn 1973, Elton rerecorded ‚ÄúGrey Seal‚Äù for his seventh album. This version appears on his 1974 UK rarities comp Lady Samantha.\n\nOn June 19, 1970, Elton played his first show abroad at Mantorp‚Äôs Racing Circuit in √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden. On Sunday the 21st, he held his second Roundhouse engagement, followed by a June 26 show at St. Mary‚Äôs College in Twickenham. On July 11, he played Knokke Casino in Knokke, Belgium.\n\nOn August 14, Elton played an extended set at the Yorkshire Folk Blues and Jazz Festival, a shambolic three-day hillside event in Krumlin, Barkisland, with sets by Fairport Convention, Groundhogs, Ralph McTell, and Fotheringay. Elton played Day 1 (Friday), which also featured Amazing Blondel, Atomic Rooster, The Humblebums, Manfred Mann Chapter Three, and headliners The Pretty Things. (The intended Saturday headliner, Pink Floyd, didn‚Äôt appear due to bad weather, which forced the festival‚Äôs organizers to cancel Sunday‚Äôs shows.)\n\nFirst US Show\n\nOn August 25, 1970, Elton John made his US debut at the Troubadour on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, where he held a six-night engagement, supported by singer‚Äìsongwriter David Ackles.\n\nOn the first night, Elton floored the audience with an energized set that included numbers from his self-titled album and a cover of the Rolling Stones recent rocker ‚ÄúHonky Tonk Women.‚Äù He performed in a piano power-trio setting with the Olsson‚ÄìMurray rhythm section; no guitarist. They ended the set with a twenty-minute version of the yet-unreleased John‚ÄìTaupin original ‚ÄúBurn Down the Mission.‚Äù\n\nRock photojournalist Ed Caraeff ‚Äî who caught the famed guitar-burning image of Jimi Hendrix at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival ‚Äî captured Elton‚Äôs flying stage routine. Between shows, Elton visited the Disneyland Resort in nearby Anaheim and returned with Mickey Mouse ears that he wore on stage at subsequent shows. His newfound flamboyance stunned Olsson and Murray, who knew Elton as the subdued singer‚Äìsongwriter at Dick James Studios. Audiences, likewise, were shocked by the raw energy of his performances and the contrast between his stripped live arrangements and orchestrated studio recordings.\n\nAfter the Aug. 25‚Äì30 LA engagement, Elton played six straight nights (Sept. 1‚Äì6) at the Troubadour North in San Francisco. On September 10, he made his first appearance in New York City at the Playboy Club. On Sept. 11‚Äì12, he played the Electric Factory in Philadelphia.\n\nElton, now the conquering hero, played an October 2 homecoming show at London‚Äôs Royal Albert Hall, supported by Sandy Denny and her band Fotheringay.\n\n‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù\n\nOn October 26, 1970, Uni Records issued ‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot‚Äù as Elton John‚Äôs third proper US single. However, DJs favored the b-side, ‚ÄúYour Song,‚Äù which caught on with listeners and prompted Uni to flip sides. With its earnest delivery, universal message, gripping bridge (‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt mind, I hope you don‚Äôt mind, that I put down in words‚Äù), and heartfelt refrain (‚Äúhow wonderful life is when you‚Äôre in the world‚Äù), ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù became his stateside breakthrough hit. It reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox Top 100 and No. 9 on the US Adult Contemporary chart. The song‚Äôs success lifted its seven-month-old parent album, Elton John, to No. 4 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn Canada, ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù reached No. 3 on the RPM Top Singles chart and No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nTumbleweed Connection\n\nElton John released his third album, Tumbleweed Connection, on October 30, 1970, on DJM and Uni. It contains nine John‚ÄìTaupin originals and ‚ÄúLove Song,‚Äù which Elton co-wrote with Lesley Duncan. Each side closes with a lengthy epic number: ‚ÄúMy Father‚Äôs Gun‚Äù and ‚ÄúBurn Down the Mission.‚Äù Musically and lyrically, the songs invoke Old West themes.\n\n1. ‚ÄúBallad of a Well-Known Gun‚Äù (4:59)\n\n2. ‚ÄúCome Down in Time‚Äù (3:25)\n\n3. ‚ÄúCountry Comfort‚Äù (5:06) Rod Stewart covers this song on his June 1970 second album Gasoline Alley, released four months ahead of Tumbleweed.\n\n4. ‚ÄúSon of Your Father‚Äù (3:48) Spooky Tooth cover this song on their July 1970 fourth album The Last Puff, released three months before Tumbleweed.\n\n5. ‚ÄúMy Father‚Äôs Gun‚Äù (6:20)\n\n6. ‚ÄúWhere to Now St. Peter?‚Äù (4:11)\n\n7. ‚ÄúLove Song‚Äù (3:41)\n\n8. ‚ÄúAmoreena‚Äù (5:00)\n\n9. ‚ÄúTalking Old Soldiers‚Äù (4:06)\n\n10. ‚ÄúBurn Down the Mission‚Äù (6:21)\n\nbonus 11. ‚ÄúInto the Old Man‚Äôs Shoes‚Äù\n\nSessions took place in March 1970 at Trident, where Dudgeon produced the album in sequence with titles by Magna Carta and Michael Chapman. This is Elton‚Äôs second album engineered by Geoffrey Cable, who worked on concurrent titles by Affinity (self-titled), Andwella, Genesis (Trespass), Harvey Andrews, Jade, and Van der Graaf Generator (The Least We Can Do, H to He).\n\n‚ÄúCountry Comfort‚Äù features steel guitarist Gordon Huntley (Forest, Gospel Oak), violinist Johnny Van Derek, and Blue Mink drummer Barry Morgan, who also plays on ‚ÄúCome Down In Time‚Äù alongside reedist Karl Jenkins (Soft Machine). Leslie Duncan and Blue Mink singer Madeline Bell sing backing vocals on ‚ÄúSon of Your Father,‚Äù ‚ÄúBallad of a Well Known Gun,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Father‚Äôs Gun.‚Äù The latter two also feature Tony Hazzard and Dusty Springfield on backing vocals.\n\nTumbleweed Connection is housed in a gatefold sleeve with photography by Ian Digby-Ovens and Barrie Wentzell. It presents Elton and Bernie in sepia-tinged Old West settings on the outer-gates (outside a saloon) and inner-gates (inside a steam train). The location used for the period imagery is Sheffield Park, a railway station in Fletching, East Sussex, built in 1882.\n\nThe Tumbleweed inner-gate contains a twelve-page booklet with lyrics, credits, and photos of the album‚Äôs players: Olsson, Murray, and Hookfoot (Quaye, Glover, Pope, and harpist Ian Duck), plus Buckmaster, Dudgeon, Geoffrey Cable, and Leslie Duncan. Wentzell‚Äôs photography also appears on 1970 album covers for Forever More, Jody Grind (Far Canal), Tin Tin (self-titled), Trapeze, and Yes (Time and a Word).\n\nElton released no singles from Tumbleweed Connection in the Northern Hemisphere because he wanted the songs to be heard in the album‚Äôs context. However, DJM lifted ‚ÄúCountry Comfort‚Äù as a single in Oceania (b/w ‚ÄúLove Song‚Äù).\n\nTumbleweed Connection reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 5 on the Billboard 200. It peaked at No. 4 in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands. In 1995, Mercury reissued the album with two bonus tracks: ‚ÄúInto the Old Man‚Äôs Shoes‚Äù and an early version of ‚ÄúMadman Across the Water,‚Äù recorded with guitarist Mick Ronson, a member of Bowie‚Äôs backing band Hype, which morphed into the Spiders from Mars.\n\nElton flew back to the states for a sixteen-city tour, starting with an Oct. 29‚Äì31 engagement at the Boston Tea Party with brass-rockers Dreams (with drummer Billy Cobham and the Brecker Brothers). In San Francisco, he opened for The Kinks on a three-night stand (Nov. 12‚Äì14) at the Fillmore Auditorium. On November 17, he played a set at Manhattan‚Äôs A&R Recording Studios for a live radio broadcast on WABC-FM. On Nov. 27‚Äì28, he headlined a multi-act bill with Catfish and Uriah Heep at Detroit‚Äôs Eastown Theatre.\n\nElton John rounded out 1970 with a Dec. 20 show at London‚Äôs Roundhouse. He found a manager in 21-year-old EMI promoter John Reid, who met Elton at a Christmas Motown party.\n\nSister duo Birds of a Feather (aka the Chanter Sisters) cover ‚ÄúCountry Comforts‚Äù on thir 1970 self-titled album, which also contains covers of ‚ÄúBorder Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot,‚Äù and an Elton-backed version of ‚ÄúBad Side of the Moon.‚Äù\n\n1971\n\nIn January 1971, DJM issued ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù in the UK in Europe. It reached No. 4 in the Netherlands, and went Top 10 in Ireland (No. 10) and Belgium (No. 16). In Oceania, ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù reached No. 11 in Australia and No. 18 in New Zealand. In the UK, it reached No. 7 and rocketed him to superstar status.\n\nTotP aired ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù on its New Year‚Äôs Eve 1970 broadcast along with a new song, ‚ÄúCan I Put You On,‚Äù from an upcoming soundtrack. They reaired it on Jan. 14 and Feb. 4 amid current hits by Ashton Gardner & Dyke (‚ÄúResurrection Shuffle‚Äù), Badfinger (‚ÄúNo Matter What‚Äù), Cat Stevens (‚ÄúMoonshadow‚Äù), Labi Siffre (‚ÄúMake My Day‚Äù), The Supremes (‚ÄúStoned Love‚Äù), and The Who (‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Even Know Myself‚Äù).\n\nElton John played twenty-two UK shows between Jan. 2 and March 3, 1971, including a set at the Lanchester Arts Festival, a Feb. 5 event at Lanchester Polytechnic with sets by Caravan, Climax Blues Band, Curved Air, Indian Summer, Mr. Fox, Osibisa, and Strawbs.\n\nAt IBC Studios, John produced Side Two of It Ain‚Äôt Easy, the first of two albums on Warner Bros. by ex-Bluesology singer Long John Baldry. Side One was produced by Rod Stewart, Baldry‚Äôs co-singer in the earlier combos Steampacket and the Hoochie Coochie Men. The album contains covers of the Faces (‚ÄúFlying‚Äù), Lesley Duncan (‚ÄúMr. Rubin‚Äù), Randy Newman (‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Burn Down The Cornfield‚Äù), and an early cover of ‚ÄúIt Ain‚Äôt Easy,‚Äù a 1970 song by American singer‚Äìsongwriter Ron Davies (popularized by David Bowie on his 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars). Warner lifted Baldry‚Äôs recording of the otherwise unissued John‚ÄìTaupin song ‚ÄúRock Me When He‚Äôs Gone‚Äù as the album‚Äôs single.\n\nElton also plays piano on two cuts (‚ÄúHelp Me Jesus,‚Äù ‚ÄúMr. Rubin‚Äù) on the 1971 CBS release Sing Children Sing, the debut album by Lesley Duncan. It contains her version of their co-write ‚ÄúLove Song.‚Äù John also plays on a 1971 version of ‚ÄúSkyline Pigeon‚Äù by Australian singer and former Seekers frontwoman Judith Durham, who covers the song on her 1971 A&M release Climb Ev‚Äôry Mountain.\n\nFriends\n\nOn March 5, 1971, Paramount Records issued Friends, Elton John‚Äôs soundtrack to the namesake British-French teen-romance film by director Lewis Gilbert (Alfie, The Spy Who Loved Me, Educating Rita).

The song reached No. 5 in Italy and went Top 20 in France (No. 12), Canada (No. 13), and the US (No. 17 Cashbox).\n\nElton John played five UK cities between March 6 and 28, hitting Leicester, Kingston, Bristol, London, and Croydon, where he played Fairfield Halls, the site of 1970‚Äì71 live recordings by Eric Clapton and The Nice.\n\n17-11-70\n\nOn April 1, 1971, DJM and Uni issued 17-11-70, a document of Elton John‚Äôs performance at New York‚Äôs A&R Recording Studios for the live WABC-FM broadcast. Of the thirteen songs that John, Olsson, and Murray performed on November 17, 1970, the album contains six: two from Elton John (‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot,‚Äù ‚ÄúSixty Years On‚Äù), one from Friends (‚ÄúCan I Put You On‚Äù), one non-album b-side (‚ÄúBad Side of the Moon‚Äù), the Stones cover (‚ÄúHonky Tonk Women‚Äù), and the elongated version of the Tumbleweed number ‚ÄúBurn Down the Mission,‚Äù which interpolates parts of The Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúGet Back‚Äù and the 1950 R&B chestnut ‚ÄúMy Baby Left Me,‚Äù written and first recorded by Delta bluesman Arthur Crudup.\n\n1. ‚ÄúTake Me to the Pilot‚Äù (6:43)\n\n2. ‚ÄúHonky Tonk Women‚Äù (4:09)\n\n3. ‚ÄúSixty Years On‚Äù (8:05)\n\n4. ‚ÄúCan I Put You On‚Äù (6:38)\n\n1. ‚ÄúBad Side of the Moon‚Äù (4:30)\n\n2. ‚ÄúBurn Down the Mission‚Äù (incl. ‚ÄúMy Baby Left Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet Back‚Äù) (18:20)\n\nDudgeon produced 17-11-70, which Manhattan soundman Phil Ramone engineered amid projects with Burt Bacharach, Lazarus, and Paul Winter‚Äôs Consort. 17-11-70 reached No. 20 on the UK Albums Chart, No. 10 on the Canadian RPM, and No. 11 on the US Billboard 200.\n\nThe full A&R Studios set includes three additional songs apiece from Elton John (‚ÄúYour Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúBorder Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Need You to Turn To‚Äù) and Tumbleweed (‚ÄúAmoreena,‚Äù ‚ÄúCountry Comfort,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy Father‚Äôs Gun‚Äù), plus the then-unreleased ‚ÄúIndian Sunset‚Äù from his upcoming fourth studio album.\n\nOf the seven missing songs performed on November 17, ‚ÄúAmoreena‚Äù appears on the 1996 17-11-70 reissue on Rocket Records. The entire thirteen-song set remained unavailable until the 2017 two-LP reissue on the label branch of Record Store Day, a biannual vinyl celebration.\n\nElton embarked on a forty-four date US spring tour, which started in Providence on April 2, 1971, at Loew‚Äôs State Theatre and wrapped in Harrisburg, Penn, on June 18 at the Farm Show Arena. The tour included swings through Texas, the Great Plains, the Northwest, and Hawaii, plus two stops in New York, including a June 10‚Äì11 engagement at Carnegie Hall.\n\nElton, in his first Rolling Stone cover feature, appears on the magazine‚Äôs June 10, 1971, issue (No. 84). Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz took the grayscale photo of the singer, caputured floor-seated and hand-crossed, clad in star boots and a 3/4 t-shirt that reads ‚ÄúBERNIE TAUPIN FUNKY MONKEY‚Äù with an (obscured) cross-fingered image of the lyricist. In the four-page article, John tells journalist David Felton that ‚ÄúI vowed when I started on the road‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm gonna be an entertainer (which I didn‚Äôt want to be, I really didn‚Äôt want to go on the road as Elton John, but I had to because the records didn‚Äôt sell), I vowed I was really gonna try and give it everything I got.‚Äù\n\nTaupin\n\nIn June 1971, Bernie Taupin released the spoken-word album Taupin on DJM (UK) and Elektra (US). It contains poetry set to music by Quaye and Scottish guitarist Davey Johnstone, who plays acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, sitar, and lute on the album. Side One consists of ‚ÄúChild,‚Äù a poem divided into nine subtitles, including lyrics from the Elton John track ‚ÄúThe Greatest Discovery.‚Äù\n\nSide Two contains six musical poems, including the three-part ‚ÄúVerses After Dark,‚Äù co-written by American singer‚Äìsongwriter Shawn Phillips, who plays sitar, electric guitar, 6- and 12-string acoustic guitars, koto, and does additional spoken word on Taupin, which also features Strawbs double-bassist Ron Chesterman, Third Ear Band violinist Richard Coff, Chitinous Ensemble player Diana Lewis, and Australian jazz drummer Chris Karan, once of the Dudley Moore Trio.\n\nJohnstone joined folksters Magna Carta for the 1970‚Äì71 Vertigo albums Seasons and Songs From Wasties Orchard. His work on Taupin impressed Elton John, who hired Davey as his live guitarist and musical director. This marked the start of Johnstone‚Äôs fifty-year tenure in the Elton John Band.\n\nOn July 13, the Elton John Band played Garden Party II, an event at London‚Äôs Crystal Palace Bowl with sets by Fairport, Rory Gallagher, and Yes. On August 8, they played the Vilar dos Mouros Festival, an event in the Viana do Castelo district of northwest Portugal with sets by Manfred Mann‚Äôs Earth Band and local psychsters Quarteto 1111.\n\nOn August 27, Elton took his band on a US tour with back-to-back shows in New Jersey, followed by shows in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and three dates in upstate New York. After a round of southwest shows, they did their six-date, four-city tour of Japan (Oct. 5‚Äì11) and their first tour of Oceania, which covered four cities in Australia and an October 29 show at Western Springs Stadium in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nMadman Across the Water\n\nElton John released his fourth proper studio album, Madman Across the Water, on November 5, 1971, on DJM and Uni. It contains nine John‚ÄìTaupin originals, including the pre-existing concert staple ‚ÄúIndian Summer‚Äù and the re-recorded title track (first cut during the Tumbleweed sessions). The first two songs, ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù and ‚ÄúLevon,‚Äù later achieved radio evergreen status.\n\n1. ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù (6:17)\n\n2. ‚ÄúLevon‚Äù (5:22)\n\n3. ‚ÄúRazor Face‚Äù (4:42)\n\n4. ‚ÄúMadman Across the Water‚Äù (5:57)\n\n1. ‚ÄúIndian Sunset‚Äù (6:47)\n\n2. ‚ÄúHoliday Inn‚Äù (4:17)\n\n3. ‚ÄúRotten Peaches‚Äù (4:58)\n\n4. ‚ÄúAll the Nasties‚Äù (5:09)\n\n5. ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù (1:49)\n\nMadman sessions first occurred on February 27 (‚ÄúLevon‚Äù) at Trident Studios, followed by six months with sessions on August 9 (‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù), 11, and 14. The album features Olsson and Murray on four songs: ‚ÄúAll the Nasties,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoliday Inn,‚Äù ‚ÄúTiny Dancer,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRotten Peaches.‚Äù Johnstone plays acoustic guitar on the final two, plus the title track. He plays mandolin and sitar on ‚ÄúHoliday Inn,‚Äù which features electric guitar by Quaye, who appears with Hookfoot colleagues Pope and Glover on ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù and ‚ÄúRazor Face.‚Äù\n\nMadman features twelve additional session musicians and eight backing vocalists. ‚ÄúLevon‚Äù features Quaye with Barry Morgan, bassist Brian Odgers, and library keyboardist Brian Dee (on harmonium). Accordion player Jack Emblow plays on ‚ÄúRazor Face‚Äù with organist Rick Wakeman, who plays on ‚ÄúRotten Peaches‚Äù with guitarist Chris Spedding (slide), bassist Herbie Flowers, and drummer Terry Cox. The last two also play on ‚ÄúIndian Sunset‚Äù and (with Spedding) ‚ÄúMadman Across the Water,‚Äù which also features percussionist Ray Cooper, an eventual mainstay of Elton‚Äôs band who plays tambourine on ‚ÄúRotten Peaches‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll the Nasties.‚Äù\n\nOf the sessionists, Flowers partook in Blue Mink, Rumplestiltskin, and the latter‚Äôs instrumental variants Hungry Wolf and Ugly Custard. Wakeman ‚Äî a recent sessionist for Cat Stevens (‚ÄúMorning Has Broken‚Äù), T. Rex (‚ÄúGet It On‚Äù), and Bowie (‚ÄúChanges‚Äù) ‚Äî was between a three-album gig in Strawbs and his star-making run in Yes. Spedding (ex-Battered Ornaments) plays on Lesley Duncan‚Äôs debut and 1970‚Äì71 albums by Bob Downes, Julie Driscoll, Linda Lewis, Michael Gibbs, Mike D‚ÄôAbo, Neil Ardley, Ian Carr‚Äôs Nucleus, and Paul Korda.\n\nCochise steel guitarist B. J. Cole, responsible for the slide licks on ‚ÄúTiny Dancer,‚Äù appears on concurrent album by Humble Pie, Nazareth, Peter Sarstedt, Phillip Goodhand-Tait, and Ray Fenwick. Olsson employs him on the 1971 DJM release Nigel Olsson‚Äôs Drum Orchestra and Chorus.\n\n‚ÄúTiny Dancer,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoliday Inn,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRotten Peaches‚Äù feature backing vocals by returning singers Lesley Duncan, Liza Strike, Roger Cook, and Tony Burrows, plus Barry St. John (of Les Humphries Singers), Terry Steele (later Hiroshima), and the duo of Sue (Glover) & Sunny (Leslie). ‚ÄúIndian Sunset‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll the Nasties‚Äù feature the Cantores em Ecclesia Choir directed by Robert Kirby, an arranger for Audience, Gillian McPherson, John Kongos, Nick Drake, Shelagh McDonald, and Spirogyra.\n\nDudgeon produced Madman Across the Water in succession with 1971 albums by Audience (The House On the Hill), Marsha Hunt, and the self-titled RCA‚ÄìNeon release by Spring. Buckmaster conducted orchestral arrangements on seven songs (everything except ‚ÄúRazor Face‚Äù and ‚ÄúRotten Peaches‚Äù). His wife, Diana Lewis, plays ARP synthesizer on ‚ÄúRotten Peaches‚Äù and the title track. Geoffrey Cable engineered Madman and Spring amid projects with Colin Scot, Harry Nilsson, Peter Hammill (Fool‚Äôs Mate), and VDGG (Pawn Hearts).\n\nThis would be Elton‚Äôs last album for four years with backing by members of Hookfoot, who released their first of three albums in 1971 on DJM.\n\nLarkham designed the album‚Äôs matte, textured, denim-themed gatefold. It shows the title in gradient blue (front) and the song titles embroidered next to a denim seam (back). The inner-gates picture Elton in a grayscale short-haired medium-shot (left) and a bluescale long-haired profile (right). Original copies have a twelve-page inner booklet with lyrics and pics of John and Tauplin by photojournalist Bob Gruen, plus Victorian-era photos of subjects who represent the album‚Äôs musical and production team. Taupin dedicates ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù to his new wife, Maxine (pictured on Page Three). Gruen also has visual credits on 1971 albums by Labelle, Larry Coryell, and Lotti Golden.\n\nElton and his band plugged Madman with six late November shows (21‚Äì28) in Coventry, Manchester, Leicester, Bournemouth, Plymouth, and Bristol.\n\nOn November 29, 1971, Uni lifted ‚ÄúLevon‚Äù (b/w ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù) as Elton‚Äôs fifth proper US single. It reached No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 6 in Canada.\n\nIn December, Elton player seven documented UK shows, including a 12/10 date at Newcastle‚Äôs City Hall with the Texan folk-pop duo England Dan & John Ford Coley.\n\nMadman Across the Water reached No. 8 in Australia and No. 9 in Canada. It went Top 20 in Italy (No. 14), Spain (No. 11), and Japan (No. 13). In the US, the album reached No. 8 on the Billboard 200. It was later certified double-Platinum (2 million sales) by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nElton accompanied his friend Marc Bolan of T. Rex for their December 27 TotP mime of ‚ÄúGet It On,‚Äù a UK summer No. 1 that TotP aired as part of a holiday roundup of the year‚Äôs biggest hits, including 1971 chart-toppers by the Rolling Stones (‚ÄúBrown Sugar‚Äù), Rod Stewart (‚ÄúMaggie May‚Äù), and Slade (‚ÄúCoz I Luv You‚Äù).\n\n1972\n\nOn February 5, the Elton John Band played their first concert of 1972 at London‚Äôs Royal Festival Hall.\n\nUni lifted ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù as Elton John‚Äôs sixth US single on Feb. 7 (b/w ‚ÄúRazor Face‚Äù). Due to its unedited full-album length (6:12), many AM stations refused to playlist the song. Consequently, ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù peaked at No. 29 on the Cashbox Top 100 and No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. It did, however, reach the Top 20 in Australia (No. 13) and Canada (No. 19). Despite its modest peaks, ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù later achieved FM evergreen status.\n\nIn late February, Elton played five concerts in England, including two national youth benefits at London‚Äôs Shaw Theatre. Elton opened March with a four-city Scottish tour, followed by two appearances at Jahrhunderhalle in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nBetween his own live and studio work, John produced Side One of the April 1972 Warner release Everything Stops for Tea by Long John Baldry. Olsson and Johnstone play on the five Elton‚Äìproduced numbers; Johnstone co-wrote ‚ÄúWild Mountain Thyme‚Äù with Baldry, who also covers songs by John Kongos (‚ÄúJubilee Cloud‚Äù) and the Australian band Daddy Cool (‚ÄúCome Back Again‚Äù). Rod Stewart produced Side Two and plays banjo on the trad number ‚ÄúMother Ain‚Äôt Dead.‚Äù\n\nOn April 26, Elton launched an eleven-date US tour with three shows in Texas, followed by a Midwest swing that included three Ohio dates and a May 13 show at the Field House in DeKalb, Illinois.\n\nHonky Ch√¢teau\n\nElton John released his fifth studio album, Honky Ch√¢teau, on May 19, 1972, on DJM and Uni. This is his first album with backing on all tracks by his live band: Olsson, Murray, and Johnstone. The album spawned two Billboard Top 10 hits and became his first of seven US No. 1 albums. The title combines part of the first track (‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù) with the name of the French ch√¢teau where sessions took place.\n\nHonky Ch√¢teau features ten John‚ÄìTaupin originals.\n\n1. ‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù (5:12)\n\n2. ‚ÄúMellow‚Äù (5:33)\n\n3. ‚ÄúI Think I‚Äôm Going to Kill Myself‚Äù (3:35)\n\n4. ‚ÄúSusie (Dramas)‚Äù (3:25)\n\n5. ‚ÄúRocket Man (I Think It‚Äôs Going To Be a Long, Long Time)‚Äù (4:40)\n\n1. ‚ÄúSalvation‚Äù (3:59)\n\n2. ‚ÄúSlave‚Äù (4:22)\n\n3. ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù (4:03)\n\n4. ‚ÄúMona Lisas and Mad Hatters‚Äù (5:01)\n\n5. ‚ÄúHercules‚Äù (5:21)\n\nSessions occurred in January 1972 in H√©rouville, France, at the Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôH√©rouville: a castle facility also used for 1972 recordings by Alice, Joan Armatrading, Pink Floyd, T. Rex, Zoo, and most infamously by Jethro Tull, who abandonded their intended followup to Thick As a Brick due to conditions at the ch√¢teau (the recordings later appeared as The Chateau d‚ÄôIsaster Tapes).\n\nGus Dudgeon produced Honky Ch√¢teau amid work on Grave New World by Strawbs and Armatrading‚Äôs debut. This is the first of Elton‚Äôs two albums with engineer Ken Scott, a late-period Beatles soundman who produced Bowie‚Äôs 1971‚Äì73 output.\n\nHonky Ch√¢teau features Elton on Hammond organ (‚ÄúMellow,‚Äù ‚ÄúSusie‚Äù), harmonium (‚ÄúSalvation‚Äù), and the Fender Rhodes electric piano (‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù) in addition to grand piano (everything but ‚ÄúSlave‚Äù).\n\nOlsson plays on everything except the percussion-free ‚ÄúMona Lisas and Mad Hatters,‚Äù which features Johnstone on mandolin. Davey plays banjo on ‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù (the only guitar-free track) and ‚ÄúSlave,‚Äù which also features his slide work.\n\nFrench jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty plays electric violin on ‚ÄúMellow‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmy,‚Äù which also features percussionist Ray Cooper, who played his first live shows with John in early 1972. ‚ÄúLegs‚Äù Larry Smith (ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band) does the tap dance on ‚ÄúI Think I‚Äôm Going to Kill Myself.‚Äù Dudgeon plays the whistle on ‚ÄúHercules.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù features a four-piece French brass section: trombonist Jacques Bolognesi and saxophonists Alain Hatot and Jean-Louis Chautemps (all recently of Janko Nilovic‚Äôs Giant) and trumpeter Ivan Jullien. ‚ÄúSalvation‚Äù features backing vocals by Bell, Hazzard, Strike, and Larry Steel, a recent auxiliary for Jonathan Kelly, Masters Apprentices, and T√≠r na n√ìg.\n\nHonky Ch√¢teau is housed in a sepia gatefold with photography by Ed Caraeff. It shows a bearded close-up of Elton (front); headshots of John, Olsson, Murray, and Johnstone (back); and a lyrics spread with a distant field shot of Taupin (inner-gates).\n\nOn April 7, 1972, DJM lifted ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù as an advance single, backed with the Madman tracks ‚ÄúHoliday Inn‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoodbye.‚Äù In the US, ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù appeared on April 17 (b/w ‚ÄúSusie (Dramas)‚Äù). ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù reached No. 2 in the UK, No. 6 in Ireland, and No. 8 in Canada. In the US, ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 11 on the Cashbox Top 100.\n\nElton and his band mimed ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù on the April 27 broadcast of TotP, which twice re-aired it amid spring hits by Chickory Tip (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Your Name‚Äù), Lindisfarne (‚ÄúLady Eleanor‚Äù), Long John Baldry (‚ÄúIko Iko‚Äù), The Moody Blues (‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt Life Strange?‚Äù), The Move (‚ÄúCalifornia Man‚Äù), Ringo Starr (‚ÄúBack Off Boogaloo‚Äù), The Rolling Stones (‚ÄúTumbling Dice‚Äù), Sly & the Family Stone (‚ÄúRunnin‚Äô Away‚Äù), T. Rex (‚ÄúMetal Guru‚Äù), and Greek singer Vicki Leandros (‚ÄúCome What May‚Äù).\n\nOn June 2, Elton played London‚Äôs Crystal Palace Bowl as part of a Beach Boys-headed multi-bill with sets by Joe Cocker, Melanie, Richie Havens, and Sha Na Na. That month, Elton and his band returned to Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôH√©rouville to record their next album.\n\nOn July 31, Uni issued ‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù as Elton‚Äôs eighth US single (b/w ‚ÄúSlave‚Äù). In the UK, DJM lifted ‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù on August 25 as the album‚Äôs second single, backed with the 1969 rarities ‚ÄúLady Samantha‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Me That You Need.‚Äù Elton plugged its UK release with an eight-date tour (Aug. 26‚ÄìSept. 17) supported by Linda Lewis.\n\n‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 10 in Canada. In New Zealand, it reached No. 4 on the Listener chart. In early live performances, Elton donned a cat costume for ‚ÄúHonky Cat,‚Äù which TotP aired on its August 31 broadcast amid hits by Blackfoot Sue (‚ÄúStanding In the Road‚Äù), Roxy Music (‚ÄúVirginia Plain‚Äù), Rod Stewart (‚ÄúYou Wear It Well‚Äù), and Slade (‚ÄúMama Weer All Crazee Now‚Äù).\n\nHonky Ch√¢teau reached No. 1 in Spain and No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. The album also went Top 10 in Canada (No. 3), Australia (No. 4), Italy (No. 5), Norway (No. 8), and the Netherlands (No. 9). In the US, Honky Ch√¢teau reached No. 1 and later achieved Platinum certification by the RIAA.\n\nThe planned third single, ‚ÄúHercules,‚Äù never materialized but its intended b-side, an uptempo alternate version of ‚ÄúSlave,‚Äù appears as a bonus track on the 1996 Rocket reissue of Honky Ch√¢teau.\n\nElton consolidated the album‚Äôs stateside success with the Legs Larry Tour: a 23-date North American swing (Sept. 26‚ÄìOct. 27) that hit the Northeast, Midwest, Canada, Hawaii, and the West Coast, including two shows at the Berkeley Community Theatre supported by Family. During his Oct. 22‚Äì24 stop in the LA‚ÄìAnaheim area, he visited the Rancho Mirage property of comedic legend Groucho Marx, who made a hand-gun gesture and referred to the singer as ‚ÄòJohn Elton,‚Äô to which the singer raised his hands and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt shoot me, I‚Äôm only the piano player.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù\n\nOn October 27, 1972, DJM issued ‚ÄúCrocodile Rock,‚Äù an uptempo fifties nostalgia spoof backed with ‚ÄúElderberry Wine‚Äù ‚Äî both tasters from the album completed four months earlier at Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôH√©rouville.\n\nElton and his band flew home from the Legs Larry Tour for an October 30 command performance for the queen at the London Palladium. Two days later, they appeared in Stillwater, Oklahoma, for a 21-date (Nov. 1‚Äì26) jaunt that covered the Deep South and East Coast. On November 20, ‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù became Elton‚Äôs first release on MCA, which retired its Uni division.\n\n‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù reached No. 5 in the UK and No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Cashbox Top 100. It also reached No. 1 in Canada, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. The song went Top 3 in Australia, Belgium, Germany, and Norway.\n\nElton and his band mimed ‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù on the November 8 broadcast of TotP, which reaired the song across three fortnights amid autumn‚Äìwinter hits by David Bowie (‚ÄúThe Jean Genie‚Äù), Family (‚ÄúBurlesque‚Äù), Gilbert O‚ÄôSullivan (‚ÄúClaire‚Äù), Gladys Knight & the Pips (‚ÄúHelp Me Make It Through the Night‚Äù), Jeff Beck (‚ÄúHi-Ho Silver Lining‚Äù), Lynsey De Paul (‚ÄúGetting a Drag‚Äù), Michael Jackson (‚ÄúBen‚Äù), The Stylistics (‚ÄúI‚Äôm Stone In Love With You‚Äù), and Wizzard (‚ÄúBall Park Incident‚Äù).\n\n1973\n\n‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù entered the Billboard Top 10 on the week of January 13, 1973. Three weeks later, it overtook ‚ÄúSuperstition‚Äù by Stevie Wonder as the No. 1 song in the US. It held the top spot for three weeks, then bowed down for ‚ÄúKilling Me Softly‚Äù by Roberta Flack.\n\nCashbox ranked ‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù No. 4 on its 1973 year-end chart, just ahead of songs by Diana Ross (‚ÄúTouch Me in the Morning‚Äù), Paul McCartney & Wings (‚ÄúMy Love‚Äù), Carly Simon (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre So Vain‚Äù), and Billy Paul (‚ÄúMe and Mrs. Jones‚Äù). Paul‚Äôs hit comes from his 1972 Philadelphia International Records release 360 Degrees of Billy Paul, which contains a cover of ‚ÄúYour Song.‚Äù\n\nDon‚Äôt Shoot Me I‚Äôm Only the Piano Player\n\nElton John released his sixth album, Don‚Äôt Shoot Me I‚Äôm Only the Piano Player, on January 22, 1973, on DJM and MCA. It contains both sides of his preceding single (‚ÄúCrocodile Rock,‚Äù ‚ÄúElderberry Wine‚Äù) and eight new John‚ÄìTaupin originals, including two brassy, uptempo numbers (‚ÄúElderberry Wine,‚Äù ‚ÄúMidnight Creeper‚Äù), two lavish ballads (‚ÄúBlues for Baby and Me,‚Äù ‚ÄúHigh Flying Bird‚Äù), an R&B romp (‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going to Be a Teenage Idol‚Äù), a rustic redneck spoof (‚ÄúTexan Love Song‚Äù), and the orchestral epic ‚ÄúHave Mercy on the Criminal.‚Äù The album‚Äôs humble opener, ‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù is one of his most recognized ballads.\n\n1. ‚ÄúDaniel‚Äù (3:55)\n\n2. ‚ÄúTeacher I Need You‚Äù (4:10)\n\n3. ‚ÄúElderberry Wine‚Äù (3:34)\n\n4. ‚ÄúBlues for Baby and Me‚Äù (5:39)\n\n5. ‚ÄúMidnight Creeper‚Äù (3:52)\n\n6. ‚ÄúHave Mercy on the Criminal‚Äù (5:58)\n\n7. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going to Be a Teenage Idol‚Äù (3:56)\n\n8. ‚ÄúTexan Love Song‚Äù (3:33)\n\n9. ‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù (3:55)\n\n10. ‚ÄúHigh Flying Bird‚Äù (4:12)\n\nSessions took place with Gus Dudgeon in June 1972 at the Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôH√©rouville; nicknamed ‚ÄòStrawberry Studios‚Äô in the credits (not to be confused with the Stockport, England, facility run by 10cc). Ken Scott, who plays ARP synthesizer on ‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù engineered Don‚Äôt Shoot Me ahead of Aladdin Sane, the April 1973 RCA release by David Bowie. Buckmaster does the orchestral arrangements on ‚ÄúBlues for Baby and Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúHave Mercy on the Criminal.‚Äù\n\nJohn plays grand piano on everything apart from ‚ÄúTexan Love Song‚Äù (harmonium), ‚ÄúMidnight Creeper‚Äù and ‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù which feature the Fender Rhodes electric piano. He also plays Mellotron (‚ÄúDaiel,‚Äù ‚ÄúTeacher I Need You‚Äù) and Farfisa organ (‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù). ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going to Be a Teenage Idol‚Äù features ‚ÄòLeslie piano‚Äô (a grand piano filtered through a Leslie effects processor).\n\nDavey Johnstone plays acoustic and Leslied electric guitar on all tracks, plus banjo (‚ÄúDaniel‚Äù), sitar (‚ÄúBlues for Baby and Me‚Äù), and mandolin (‚ÄúTexan Love Song‚Äù). Don‚Äôt Shoot Me is Elton‚Äôs first album with rock backing confined to Johnstone, Murray, and Olsson. They sing backing vocals on ‚ÄúTeacher I Need You,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going to Be a Teenage Idol,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHigh Flying Bird.‚Äù\n\nDudgeon summons the ‚ÄúHonky Cat‚Äù horn section (Bolognesi, Chautemps, Hatot, Jullien) on three tracks: ‚ÄúElderberry Wine,‚Äù ‚ÄúMidnight Creeper,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going to Be a Teenage Idol.‚Äù\n\nLarkham designed the album cover with DJM art director Michael Ross, also credited with visuals on 1972‚Äì73 titles by Hookfoot, Goodhand-Tait, Sam Apple Pie, and the 1972 Uni release Queues by Vigrass & Osborne, the duo of singer Paul Vigrass and singer‚Äìlyricist Gary Osborne. Don‚Äôt Shoot Me is housed in a gatefold that shows the title on the billboard of a fifties movie theatre (front) and a similar image as a photo within a photo (back). As a tribute to the title source, a poster to the 1940 Marx Brothers film Go West appears on the far right. The left inner-gate shows the album‚Äôs credits in the style of a vintage film poster, complete with deco font and a childhood pic of Reginald at his piano. Original copies have a twelve-page booklet with lyrics and Caraeff color pics of Elton, Bernie, and the band.\n\nDJM lifted ‚ÄúDaniel‚Äù ten days ahead of the album on January 12, 1973; backed with a remake of the Empty Sky track ‚ÄúSkyline Pigeon.‚Äù It reached No. 4 in the UK and Ireland and went Top 10 in New Zealand (No. 2), Norway (No. 8), South Africa (No. 7), and Switzerland (No. 5). In March, MCA issued ‚ÄúDaniel‚Äù in North America, where it reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 on Billboard and Cashbox.\n\nElton and his band mimed ‚ÄúDaniel‚Äù on the January 11 broadcast of TotP, which twice aired it amid winter 1973 hits by Chairmen of the Board (‚ÄúI‚Äôm On My Way to a Better Place‚Äù), Colin Blunstone (‚ÄúHow Could We Dare to Be Wrong‚Äù), Electric Light Orchestra (‚ÄúRoll Over Beethoven‚Äù), Elvis Presley (‚ÄúAlways On My Mind‚Äù), Free (‚ÄúWishing Well‚Äù), Sweet (‚ÄúBlockbuster‚Äù), and The Temptations (‚ÄúPapa Was a Rolling Stone‚Äù).\n\nDon‚Äôt Shoot Me I‚Äôm Only the Piano Player reached No. 1 in the UK, Australia, Canada, Italy, and Norway. It peaked at No. 2 in Finland and the Netherlands and No. 4 in Denmark and Japan. In the US, the album became his second consecutive No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and later certified triple-Platinum (3,000,000 sold). The 1996 Rocket reissue contains four additional tracks: the remade ‚ÄúSkyline Pigeon‚Äù and the late-1973 b-sides ‚ÄúScrew You (Young Man‚Äôs Blues),‚Äù ‚ÄúJack Rabbit,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhenever You‚Äôre Ready (We‚Äôll Go Steady Again).‚Äù\n\nElton and his band played their first 1973 show on February 24 at the Starlight Room in Boston, England. After eighteen UK dates (through March 27 at Manchester‚Äôs Hard Rock), they did a four-city tour of Italy (April 11‚Äì17). In May, they recorded twenty-two songs at Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôH√©rouville.\n\n‚ÄúSaturday Night‚Äôs Alright for Fighting‚Äù\n\nOn June 29, 1973, Elton John released ‚ÄúSaturday Night‚Äôs Alright for Fighting,‚Äù an energized riff-rocker backed with ‚ÄúWhenever You‚Äôre Ready (We‚Äôll Go Steady Again)‚Äù and ‚ÄúJack Rabbit‚Äù ‚Äî all tasters from the May ch√¢teau sessions.\n\n‚ÄúSaturday Night‚Äôs Alright for Fighting‚Äù reached No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. Elton and his band mined the song on the June 29 broadcast of TotP, which twice aired it amid hits by Clifford T. Ward (‚ÄúGaye‚Äù), David Bowie (‚ÄúLife On Mars‚Äù), Jackson 5 (‚ÄúHallelujah Day‚Äù), Joe Simon (‚ÄúStep By Step‚Äù), Mott the Hoopler (‚ÄúHonaloochie Boogie‚Äù), Slade (‚ÄúSqweeze Me Pleeze Me‚Äù), and Sylvia (‚ÄúPillow Talk‚Äù).\n\nOn August 14, they launched a 34-date US tour at the Municipal Auditorium in Mobile, Alabama, supported by the Sutherland Brothers & Quiver. Stevie Wonder joined them onstage during their September 25 show at Boston Garden. The tour ran through October as the new album dropped.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\n\nElton John released his seventh album, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, on October 5, 1973, on DJM and MCA. This is his first studio double-album with the summer hit ‚ÄúSaturday Night‚Äôs Alright for Fighting‚Äù and sixteen new John‚ÄìTaupin originals.\n\nSide One contains the two-part epic ‚ÄúFuneral for a Friend‚ÄìLove Lies Bleeding,‚Äù his longest song at more than eleven minutes. Side Two contains a re-recorded version of the 1970 b-side ‚ÄúGrey Seal.‚Äù\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road became his third consecutive US chart-topper and spawned three further chart singles: ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets,‚Äù ‚ÄúCandle in the Wind,‚Äù and the title track.\n\n1. ‚ÄúFuneral for a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding‚Äù (11:09)\n\n2. ‚ÄúCandle in the Wind‚Äù (3:50)\n\n3. ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets‚Äù (5:23)\n\n1. ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road‚Äù (3:13)\n\n2. ‚ÄúThis Song Has No Title‚Äù (2:23)\n\n3. ‚ÄúGrey Seal‚Äù (4:00)\n\n4. ‚ÄúJamaica Jerk-Off‚Äù (3:39) inspired by John and Taupin‚Äôs January stay in the country, where Bernie wrote the album‚Äôs lyrics.\n\n5. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Seen That Movie Too‚Äù (5:59)\n\n1. ‚ÄúSweet Painted Lady‚Äù (3:54)\n\n2. ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909‚Äì34)‚Äù (4:23)\n\n3. ‚ÄúDirty Little Girl‚Äù (5:00)\n\n4. ‚ÄúAll the Girls Love Alice‚Äù (5:09)\n\n1. ‚ÄúYour Sister Can‚Äôt Twist (But She Can Rock ‚Äòn Roll)‚Äù (2:42)\n\n2. ‚ÄúSaturday Night‚Äôs Alright for Fighting‚Äù (4:57)\n\n3. ‚ÄúRoy Rogers‚Äù (4:07)\n\n4. ‚ÄúSocial Disease‚Äù (3:42)\n\n5. ‚ÄúHarmony‚Äù (2:46)\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road is Elton‚Äôs third consecutive album recorded at Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôH√©rouville in France, where sessions took place with Dudgeon in May 1973, four months after their aborted attempt to record in Jamaica, which intrigued Elton due to the Rolling Stones‚Äô recent use of Kingston‚Äôs Dynamic Sounds Studio for their August 1973 release Goats Head Soup.\n\nElton plays grand piano on all but two songs: ‚ÄúJamaica Jerk-Off‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirty Little Girl.‚Äù On the former, he plays Farfisa organ (also heard on ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets,‚Äù ‚ÄúThis Song Has No Title,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour Sister Can‚Äôt Twist‚Äù). On the latter, he plays Mellotron (also heard ‚Äî along with Fender Rhodes electric piano ‚Äî on ‚ÄúNo Title‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrey Seal‚Äù).\n\nJohnstone regular guitar (electric and acoustic) throughout the album, as well as banjo, slide, and steel on select tracks. He, Murray, and Olsson sing backing vocals on six tracks, including ‚ÄúFuneral for a Friend,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Danny Bailey,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHarmony.‚Äù\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road is the first of three consecutive Elton albums engineered by David Hentschel, a soundman on recent albums by Al Stewart (Orange), Atomic Rooster, Genesis (Nursery Cryme), Home, Jackson Heights, Mott the Hoople, and the 1973 self-titled debut by Queen. He plays ARP synthesizer on ‚ÄúFuneral for a Friend‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll the Girls Love Alice,‚Äù which features car effects Olsson and backing vocals by English pop singer Kiki Dee, a recent Motown Rare Earth signee with a backlog of sixites singles (and a 1968 album) on Fontana.\n\n‚ÄúAlice‚Äù also features tambourine by Elton‚Äôs live auxiliary player Ray Cooper, who possibly plays the uncredited vibraphone on ‚ÄúSweet Painted Lady.‚Äù (He later plays the instrument on Elton‚Äôs twelfth studio album.) Olsson, who plays congas and tambourine on assorted tracks, is possibly responsible for the uncredited percussive sundries (maracas, timbales, claves) heard on ‚ÄúJamaica Jerk-Off,‚Äù which features vocal trade-offs by ‚ÄòReggae Dwight‚Äô (Elton), and ‚ÄòToots Taupin‚Äô (Bernie) and a mystery figure dubbed ‚ÄòPrince Rhino.‚Äô American Latin jazz-funk saxophonist Leroy G√≥mez solos on ‚ÄúSocial Disease.‚Äù\n\nSix tracks ‚Äî ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Seen That Movie Too,‚Äù ‚ÄúSweet Painted Lady,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Danny Bailey,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoy Rogers‚Äù and ‚ÄúHarmony‚Äù ‚Äî feature orchestral arrangements by Del Newman, a string conductor on 1972‚Äì73 albums by Armatrading, Family (Bandstand), Nilsson (Son of Schmilsson), Peter Frampton, and Rick Springfield.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road names two assistant engineers: Ch√¢teau soundman Andy Scott and Trident mixer Peter Kelsey. Scott also worked on 1973 titles by the French bands Ange and Zao (Z=7L) and the 1974 Kedzie Records release Each Man Makes His Destiny by Paris-based American funksters Ice, an alternate name of the Lafayette Afro Rock Band.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road is housed in a six-panel trifold cover designed by Larkham and Ross with artwork by Ian Beck. The cover depicts a platform-booted Elton, who walks into a poster of a yellow brick road; plastered on a brick wall along a sidewalk with a mini lavender piano. The back cover illustrates a poster with titles and credits; tacked to a wall above a teddy bear. The third panel has park photos of Elton, Bernie, and the band; tacked to the same wall.\n\nThe inner-trifold has lyrics in assorted colors with variable title fonts and accompanying illustrations, including sketches of Marilyn (‚ÄúCandle In the Wind‚Äù), Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh (‚ÄúI‚Äôve Seen That Movie Too‚Äù), and Bette Davis (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Sister Can‚Äôt Twist‚Äù). A photo of Taupin and his then wife, Maxine, accompanies ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Danny Bailey.‚Äù\n\nOn September 7, DJM lifted ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road‚Äù as the second advance UK single, backed with the non-album ‚ÄúScrew You (Young Man‚Äôs Blues).‚Äù\n\nThe single reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 4 in Ireland and Australia. It also went Top 10 in New Zealand (No. 2), South Africa (No. 7), and Norway (No. 9).\n\nOn October 15, MCA lifted ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road‚Äù in North America, where it reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. on the Cashbox Top 100 and the Canadian RPM.\n\nElton and his band mimed ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road‚Äù on the October 11 broadcast of TotP, which aired it across two fortnights amid hits by Bryan Ferry (‚ÄúA Hard Rain‚Äôs Gonna Fall‚Äù), The Carpenters (‚ÄúTop of the World‚Äù), ELO (‚ÄúShowdown‚Äù), Ike & Tina Turner (‚ÄúNutbush City Limits‚Äù), The Isley Brothers (‚ÄúThat Lady‚Äù), Nazareth (‚ÄúThis Flight Tonight‚Äù), The Spinners (‚ÄúGhetto Child‚Äù), and Status Quo (‚ÄúCaroline‚Äù).\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road reached No. 1 in the UK, Australia, US, and Canada. It went Top 10 in Denmark (No. 4), Italy (No. 5), Norway (No. 5), Sweden (No. 7), Spain (No. 8), and New Zealand (No. 9). The album later certified Platinum in the UK (300,000), double-Platinum in Canada (200,000), ten-times Platinum in Australia (500,000), and octuple-Platinum in the US (8,000,000).\n\nElton and his band greeted the album‚Äôs release with the final ten dates (Oct. 5‚Äì21) of their US tour with Sutherland Brothers & Quiver.\n\n‚ÄúStep into Christmas‚Äù\n\nOn November 23, 1973, Elton John released ‚ÄúStep into Christmas,‚Äù a jolly Yuletide anthem backed with ‚ÄúHo, Ho, Ho (Who‚Äôd Be a Turkey at Christmas).‚Äù\n\nElton and his band mimed ‚ÄúStep into Christmas‚Äù on the December 12 broadcast of TotP, which aired it amid hits by Cozy Powell (‚ÄúDance With the Devil‚Äù), Faces (‚ÄúPool Hall Richard‚Äù), Leo Sayer (‚ÄúThe Show Must Go On‚Äù), and Steeleye Span (‚ÄúGaudete‚Äù). Elton performed it on the December 22 broadcast of The Gilbert O‚ÄôSullivan Show., where Bernie deputized Ray Cooper on percussion.\n\nIn late November, Elton commenced a nine-stop UK tour comprised of thirteen shows, including two-nighters in Glasgow (Dec. 10‚Äì11, Apollo) and Birmingham (Dec. 16‚Äì17, Town Hall), the latter with Kiki Dee. Elton wrapped the tour with a Dec. 21‚Äì23 holiday engagement at the Hammersmith Odeon.\n\nThe Rocket Record Company\n\nIn 1973, Elton John founded the Rocket Record Company in partnership with Bernie Taupin, Gus Dudgeon, and Steve Brown. Elton talks about the venture in the August 16 issue of Rolling Stone (No. 141), which depicts the singer in a cartoon cover illustration by Kim Whitesides. In the six-page feature by writer and radio presenter Paul Gambaccini, Elton insists that he co-founded the label to nurture up-and-coming talent; not to promote his own releases (he points to the Moody Blues and their Threshold label as an example of a small roster drowned by its star act).\n\nRocket‚Äôs debut release (PIGL 1) was If It Was So Simple, the first of two albums by Longdancer, a folk-rock band with guitarist Kai Olsson (Nigel‚Äôs brother) and guitarist‚Äìsinger Dave A. Stewart (later of The Tourists and Eurythmics).\n\nDavey Johnstone released his singular solo album, Smiling Face, in late 1973 as the second Rocket release (PIGL 2). It contains ten originals, including three co-writes with his wife Di, plus a cover of the Bert Jansch‚ÄìJohn Renbourn composition ‚ÄúAfter the Dance‚Äù and the trad standard ‚ÄúA Lark In the Morning With Mrs. McCleod.‚Äù Smiling Face features backing by Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray with select appearances by Joan Armatrading, BJ Cole, and Elton himself (harmonica on ‚ÄúKeep Right On‚Äù). Hentschel, who plays ARP on ‚ÄúJanine,‚Äù co-engineered the Dudgeon-produced album with Ken Scott.\n\nElton and Nova Sound Studios engineer Clive Franks co-produced Loving and Free, the December 1973 Rocket release (PIGL 5) by Kiki Dee. It features two otherwise unrecorded John‚ÄìTaupin numbers (‚ÄúSupercool,‚Äù ‚ÄúLonnie and Josie‚Äù) and covers of songs by Free (‚ÄúTravellin In Style‚Äù) and Stealers Wheel (‚ÄúYou Put Something Better Inside Me‚Äù), plus four Kiki originals, including the closing ballad ‚ÄúSugar On the Floor.‚Äù Loving and Free spawned a UK and Australian Top 20 hit with ‚ÄúAmoureuse,‚Äù a 1972 song by French singer V√©ronique Sanson, who co-wrote it with Gary Osborne.\n\n1974\n\nIn January 1974, Elton John recorded new music at the recently opened Caribou Ranch, a converted barn facility in the Rocky Mountains near Nederland, Colorado. Music mogul James William Guercio built the studio on earnings from his main client, brass-rockers Chicago, who recorded their 1973‚Äì77 output (albums VI through XI) at the ranch, the site of their July 1973 ABC broadcast .\n\nElton and his band launched their second Japanese tour with a February 1‚Äì2, 1974, engagement at Tokyo‚Äôs Nippon Budokan. The ten-show tour hit Osaka, Fukuoka, Kyoto, and Nagoya, then returned Tokyo for a Feb. 13 show at Shinjuku Kohsei Nenkin Hall. Ray Cooper joined as a full-time member of Elton‚Äôs band.\n\nOn February 4, 1974, MCA lifted ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets‚Äù as the third North American Yellow Brick single, backed with the popular deep-cut ‚ÄúHarmony.‚Äù It reached No. 1 on the Canadian RPM and the US Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox Top 100. ‚ÄúBennie‚Äù also reached No. 15 on Billboard‚Äòs Hot Soul Singles chart.\n\nInsiders tapped ‚ÄúHarmony‚Äù as a possible a-side; a notion mooted by its use as a b-side and the upcoming release of John‚Äôs next album. In Boston, ‚ÄúHarmony‚Äù reached No. 1 on WBZ-FM‚Äôs listener-voted chart.\n\nOn February 22, DJM lifted ‚ÄúCandle in the Wind‚Äù (b/w ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets‚Äù) as the third Yellow Brick single in the UK, Europe, and Oceania. It reached No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart. Both songs charted as a double a-side in Australia (No. 5), Ireland (No. 18), and New Zealand (No. 13).\n\nTotP aired ‚ÄúCandle in the Wind‚Äù on its March 21 broadcast along with hits by Diana Ross & Marvin Gaye (‚ÄúYou Are Everything‚Äù), ELO (‚ÄúMa-Ma-Ma Belle‚Äù), The Hollies (‚ÄúThe Air That I Breathe‚Äù), and Mott the Hoople (‚ÄúThe Golden Age of Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll‚Äù).\n\nElton and his band traveled Down Under for a six-show tour (Feb. 21‚ÄìMarch 18) that covered five cities in Australia (Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Randwick, Perth) plus Auckland, New Zealand, where they performed to 49,000 fans at Western Springs Stadium (2/28).\n\nIn May, Elton and his band performed two UK benefit shows: one for the Invalid Children‚Äôs Aid Association (5/18: Royal Festival Hall) and with guests Rod Stewart and Nazareth at Vicarage Road, Watford (5/5). Elton appears on Stewart‚Äôs 1974 album Smiler, which contains a cover of the unreleased John‚ÄìTauper composition ‚ÄúLet Me Be Your Car‚Äù with John on piano and backing vocals.\n\nOn May 27, Elton and his band played to 12,500 London fans at Wembley‚Äôs Empire Pool Arena. John appeared stateside at a June 14 Beach Boys concert at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, NY, where he joined the band onstage for encores of ‚ÄúBarbara Ann‚Äù and ‚ÄúSurfin‚Äô USA.‚Äù\n\nCaribou\n\nElton John released his eighth album, Caribou, on June 24, 1974, on DJM and MCA. It has ten John‚ÄìTaupin originals that range from uptempo riff-rockers (‚ÄúThe Bitch Is Back,‚Äù ‚ÄúGrimsby‚Äù) to harmonized ballads (‚ÄúI‚Äôve Seen the Saucers,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me‚Äù) and brassy R&B (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre So Static,‚Äù ‚ÄúStinker‚Äù) with forays into country (‚ÄúPinky,‚Äù ‚ÄúDixie Lily‚Äù) and music hall (‚ÄúSolar Prestige a Gammon‚Äù). The album closes with ‚ÄúTicking,‚Äù a lengthy piano-laden narrative about a young man pushed over the edge.\n\n1. ‚ÄúThe Bitch Is Back‚Äù (3:44)\n\n2. ‚ÄúPinky‚Äù (3:54)\n\n3. ‚ÄúGrimsby‚Äù (3:46)\n\n4. ‚ÄúDixie Lily‚Äù (2:55)\n\n5. ‚ÄúSolar Prestige a Gammon‚Äù (2:52)\n\n6. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre So Static‚Äù (4:53)\n\n7. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Seen the Saucers‚Äù (4:48)\n\n8. ‚ÄúStinker‚Äù (5:20)\n\n9. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me‚Äù (5:36)\n\n10. ‚ÄúTicking‚Äù (7:34)\n\n12. ‚ÄúSick City‚Äù 5:23\n\n13. ‚ÄúCold Highway‚Äù 3:25\n\nElton named the album after Caribou Ranch, where he laid the tracks with Dudgeon in January after sessions wrapped on Chicago IV. Additional sessions took place in London (Trident) and Santa Monica at Brother Studios, a newly opened facility owned by the Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson. This is Elton‚Äôs first album since 17-11-70 with involvement by Clive Franks, who engineered Caribou in sequence with the 1974 Rocket release Totally Out of Control by the Hudson Brothers. Dave Hentschel mixed Caribou at Trident Studios.\n\nElton plays grand piano thoughout Caribou and Hammond organ on ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me.‚Äù Hentschel plays ARP synthesizer on three tracks (‚ÄúPinky,‚Äù ‚ÄúSolar Prestige a Gammon,‚Äù ‚ÄúTicking‚Äù) and Mellotron on DLtSGDoM. Cooper plays assorted hand and pitch percussion, including vibraphone, castanets, and tubular bells.\n\nFour tracks (‚ÄúThe Bitch Is Back,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre So Static,‚Äù ‚ÄúStinker,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun‚Äù) feature the Tower of Power horn section: trumpeter Greg Adams, trombonist Mic Gillette, and saxophonists Steve Kupka (baritone), Lenny Pickett and Emilio Castillo (both tenor). Pickett also plays clarinet on ‚ÄúSolar Prestige‚Äù and soprano sax on that and ‚ÄúDixie Lily.‚Äù ToP organist Chester D. Thompson plays on ‚ÄúStinker.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe Bitch Is Back‚Äù features backing vocals by Clydie King, Sherlie Matthews, Jessie Mae Smith, and Dusty Springfield. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me‚Äù features backing vocals by Captain & Tennille and Caryl Wilson along with fellow Beach Boys Bruce Johnston and Billy Hinsche.\n\nCaribou is housed in a single sleeve designed by Larkham and Ross with Caraeff photography. It shows Elton posed before an imitation lakeside backdrop in a tiger top and loon pants. The back covers shows him (blue leisure suit) and Bernie (leath suit) seated on stools against a background film projection. Elton‚Äôs face appears in rose-colored frames on the otherwise monochrome inner-sleeve photo.\n\nOn May 24, DJM lifted ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me‚Äù as an advance single, backed with the non-album ‚ÄúSick City.‚Äù It went Top 20 in the UK Ireland, and Australia but faired better in North America, where MCA issued the single on June 10. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me‚Äù reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nTotP aired ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me‚Äù on its June 13 broadcast amid hits by Alan Price (‚ÄúJarrow Song‚Äù), Arrows (‚ÄúA Touch Too Much‚Äù), Cozy Powell (‚ÄúThe Man In Black‚Äù), First Class (‚ÄúBeach Baby‚Äù), Leo Sayer (‚ÄúOne Man Band‚Äù), and Ray Stevens (‚ÄúThe Streak‚Äù).\n\nOn August 30, DJM and MCA lifted ‚ÄúThe Bitch Is Back‚Äù as the second Caribour single, backed with the non-album ‚ÄúCold Highway.‚Äù It peaked at No. 15 in the UK but reached No 1 in Canada. In the US, ‚ÄúThe Bitch Is Back‚Äù reached No. 5 on the Cashbox Top 100 and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nElton and his band mimed ‚ÄúThe Bitch Is Back‚Äù on the September 5 broadcast of TotP, which twice aired the song amid hits by 10cc (‚ÄúSilly Love‚Äù), Andy-Fairweather Low (‚ÄúReggae Tune‚Äù), Brian Protheroe (‚ÄúPinball‚Äù), Carl Douglas (‚ÄúKung Fu Fighting‚Äù), Cat Stevens (‚ÄúAnother Saturday Night‚Äù), The Commadores (‚ÄúMachine Gun‚Äù), Don Covay (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Better To Have‚Äù), and Robert Wyatt (‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Believer‚Äù).\n\nCaribou reached No. 1 in the UK, Australia, Canada, Denmark, and the US. It peaked at No. 2 in Japan and went Top 10 in Italy (No. 8), Norway (No. 6), Spain (No. 4), Sweden (No. 3), and Yugoslavia (No. 5). The album later certified double-Platinum in Australia (100,000) and the US (2,000,000).\n\nElton and his band plugged Caribou with a 24-date autumn US tour that included multiple dates with the Kiki Dee Band, then promoting their 1974 Rocket release I‚Äôve Got the Music in Me and it‚Äôs title hit (written by ontime Trees bassist Bias Boshell and covered in 1975 by Thelma Houston with Pressure Cooker). The tour launched on September 25 at the Dallas Convention Center and wrapped on November 15 at Detroit‚Äôs Olympia Stadium.\n\n‚ÄúLucy In The Sky With Diamonds‚Äù\n\nOn November 15, 1974, Elton released the Beatles cover ‚ÄúLucy In the Sky With Diamonds,‚Äù recorded at Caribou with guitar and backing vocals by John Lennon, who performs under the pseudonym Dr. Winston O‚ÄôBoogie (Winston was Lennon‚Äôs middle name). The b-side, ‚ÄúOne Day (At a Time),‚Äù is a cover of Lennon‚Äôs recent deep cut from his 1973 album Mind Games.\n\nElton, in turn, plays piano on ‚ÄúWhatever Gets You thru the Night,‚Äù the lead-off single on Lennon‚Äôs 1974 release Walls and Bridges, recorded in the summer of 1974. After Lennon‚Äôs single reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, he appeared (as promised) at Elton‚Äôs November 24 show at Madison Square Garden, where the two performed both a-sides and ‚ÄúI Saw Her Standing There.‚Äù\n\nOn December 2‚Äì3, Elton and his band played the Philadelphia Spectrum, then headed home for a 12/12 appearance on TotP, where they mimed ‚ÄúLucy In the Sky With Diamonds‚Äù amid autumn hits by Barry White (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre The First, The Last, My Everything‚Äù), Bachman-Turner Overdrive (‚ÄúYou Ain‚Äôt Seen Nothing Yet‚Äù), Disco Tex & the Sex-O-Lettes (‚ÄúGet Dancing‚Äù), Status Quo (‚ÄúDown Down‚Äù), Rod Stewart (‚ÄúYou Can Make Me Dance, Sing Or Anything‚Äù), and Wizzard (‚ÄúAre You Ready to Rock‚Äù).\n\nFor the 1974 Christmas holiday, Elton and his band played five straight nights (Dec. 20‚Äì24) at the Hammersmith Odeon. ‚ÄúLucy In the Sky With Diamonds‚Äù reached No. 10 in the UK and No. 3 in Australia. In January 1975, it reached No. 1 in Canada and the US. Elton‚Äôs ‚ÄúLucy‚Äù cover is the second of two non-Beatles versions of a Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney song (after the 1964 Peter & Gordan hit ‚ÄúA World Without Love‚Äù) to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nLady Samantha\n\nIn 1974, DJM issued Lady Samantha, a UK-only rarities compilation on cassette and 8-track. It contains fourteen songs, including the recent b-sides ‚ÄúSkyline Pigeon‚Äù (remake), ‚ÄúJack Rabbit,‚Äù ‚ÄúScrew You (aka Young Man‚Äôs Blues),‚Äù ‚ÄúWhenever You‚Äôre Ready (We‚Äôll Go Steady Again),‚Äù and ‚ÄúHo! Ho! Ho! (Who‚Äôd Be a Turkey at Christmas).‚Äù\n\nLady Samantha also collects John‚Äôs early non-albums tracks, including the title-sake song (his first a-side) and both sides of the 1969‚Äì70 singles ‚ÄúRock and Roll Madonna‚Äù (b/w the original ‚ÄúGrey Seal‚Äù) and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Me That You Need‚Äù (b/w ‚ÄúJust Like Strange Rain‚Äù), plus the long-elusive b-sides ‚ÄúBad Side of the Moon‚Äù and ‚ÄúInto the Old Man‚Äôs Shoes.‚Äù Two songs from the Friends soundtrack (‚ÄúFriends‚Äù and ‚ÄúHoney Roll‚Äù) round out the set.\n\nDJM later reissued Lady Samantha on vinyl (1980) and CD (1988). All fourteen songs appear on John‚Äôs 1992 compilation Rare Masters, a double-CD with twenty-four additional tracks.\n\nGreatest Hits\n\nIn November 1974, Elton‚Äôs first Greatest Hits collection appeared on DJM, MCA, and Polydor. It rounds up ten of his then-most familiar songs among US and UK audiences.\n\nThe US tracklist features two songs from his self-titled second album (‚ÄúYour Song,‚Äù ‚ÄúBorder Song‚Äù) and eight 1972‚Äì74 numbers: two each from Honky Ch√¢teau (‚ÄúHonky Cat,‚Äù ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù) and Don‚Äôt Shoot Me I‚Äôm Only the Piano Player (‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrocodile Rock‚Äù), plus three from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (title track, ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaturday Night‚Äôs Alright for Fighting‚Äù) and one from Caribou (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Go Down on Me‚Äù).\n\nUK copies replace ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets‚Äù with ‚ÄúCandle in the Wind.‚Äù Greatest Hits contains nothing from Empty Sky (still unissued in the US) and Tumbleweed Connection (which had no singles). Madman Across the Water is also unrepresented, possibly because ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù and ‚ÄúLevon‚Äù had yet to achieve evergreen status.\n\nPhotographer Terry O‚ÄôNeill took the compilation‚Äôs front- and back-cover photos, which show the bespectacled singer at his piano in a white hat, suit, and bow tie.\n\nGreatest Hits reached No. 1 in the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. It peaked at No. 2 in New Zealand and No. 3 in Norway. The compilation has since certified Diamond in Canada (1,000,000), quintuple Platinum in Australia (250,000), and seventeen-times Platinum in the US (17,000,000).\n\n1975\n\nIn January 1975, MCA issued Empty Sky for the first time in North America. This version is housed in a blue gatefold with a sphinx-like caricature illustration by Belgian artist Jean Michel Folon, who also did cover art for The Great Lost Kinks Album and 1974 releases by James Vincent (Culmination) and Nelson Angelo. Six years after its UK DJM release, Empty Sky reached No. 30 in Canada and No. 6 on the Billboard 200.\n\nOn February 12, Elton John appeared on the pilot episode of Cher, a CBS variety show hosted by singer‚Äìentertainer Cher. They perform a duet rendition of ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets‚Äù and act in a skit with comedian Flip Wilson where they imagine themselves in a retirement home in the year 2025 (fifty years in the future). Elton also plays piano on a medley of ‚ÄúMockingbird,‚Äù ‚ÄúProud Mary,‚Äù ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Mountain High Enough,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNever Can Say Goodbye‚Äù ‚Äî a duet between Cher and Bette Midler.\n\nElton appears in filmmaker Ken Russell‚Äôs 1975 musical Tommy, an adaptation of the 1969 rock opera by The Who. John plays the Pinball Wizard, who sings the namesake song as the film‚Äôs titular character (played by Who frontman Roger Daltrey) excels at pinball despite his limitations (‚ÄúThat deaf, dumb, and blind kid.. sure plays a mean pinball!‚Äù). The Elton John Band‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúPinball Wizard‚Äù appears on the Tommy soundtrack, released in March 1975 on Polydor.\n\nElton also plays piano on three cuts (‚ÄúGuru Banana,‚Äù ‚ÄúCircular Letter,‚Äù ‚ÄúToujours La Voyage‚Äù) on Sweet Deciever, the March 1975 Island Records release by Soft Machine co-founder Kevin Ayers, who recently signed onto Reid‚Äôs management.\n\n‚ÄúPhiladelphia Freedom‚Äù\n\nOn February 24, 1975, Elton John released the standalone single ‚ÄúPhiladelphia Freedom,‚Äù inspired by four-time US Open champ Billie Jean King. The b-side is the Beatles cover ‚ÄúI Saw Her Standing There,‚Äù recorded live with John Lennon at Madison Square Garden on November 28, 1974.\n\nJohn asked Taupin to write a song in honor of Jean King and her team, the Philadelphia Freedoms, a charter franchise of World Team Tennis. King ‚Äî best known for her 1973 ‚ÄúBattle of the Sexes‚Äù victory over 1946‚Äì47 World No. 1 professional champ Bobby Riggs ‚Äî recently founded the Women‚Äôs Tennis Association and the Women‚Äôs Sports Foundation.\n\nElton and his band recorded ‚ÄúPhiladelphia Freedom‚Äù in August 1974 at Hollywood‚Äôs Sound Factory with Dudgeon and orchestrator Gene Page, who also arranged one track (‚ÄúSomething Lacking In Me‚Äù) on Olsson‚Äôs 1975 selft-titled second album (Rocket #PIG-2158). They held the session during a break from work on Elton‚Äôs ninth album at the Caribou Ranch.\n\n‚ÄúPhiladelphia Freedom‚Äù reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 2 in New Zealand, No. 4 in Australia, and No. 12 in the UK. In the US, the song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 32 on the publication‚Äôs R&B chart. TotP aired the song to a dance by Pan‚Äôs People on its March 13 and 27 broadcasts amid hits by 10cc (‚ÄúLife Is a Minestrone‚Äù), Fox (‚ÄúOnly You Can‚Äù), Gloria Gaynor (‚ÄúReach Out, I‚Äôll Be There‚Äù), the Kiki Dee Band (‚Äú(You Don‚Äôt Know) How Glad I Am‚Äù), and Sweet (‚ÄúFox On the Run‚Äù).\n\nOn May 17, 1975, Elton John became the first white performer to appear on the syndicated US R&M music variety program Soul Train, where he mimed ‚ÄúPhiladelphia Freedom‚Äù and ‚ÄúBennie and the Jets.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPhiladelphia Freedom‚Äù ranks No. 3 on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1975, behind hits by Captain & Tennille (‚ÄúLove Will Keep Us Together‚Äù) and Glen Campbell (‚ÄúRhinestone Cowboy‚Äù) and just ahead of David Bowie (‚ÄúFame‚Äù), Earth, Wind & Fire (‚ÄúShining Star‚Äù), and two pre-Beatles singers in the midst of comebacks: Neil Sedaka (‚ÄúLaughter In the Rain‚Äù) and Four Seasons frontman Frankie Valli (‚ÄúMy Eyes Adored You‚Äù).\n\nSedaka‚Äôs hit appeared stateside on the 1974 Rocket release Sedaka‚Äôs Back, a compilation of three UK longplayers, including the 10cc-backed 1972‚Äì73 albums Solitaire and The Tra-La Days Are Over. Like Elton, Sedaka was a pianist, composer, and singer who collaborated with lyricists. John sings uncredited backing vocals on ‚ÄúBad Blood,‚Äù a Billboard and Cashbox No. 1 from Sedaka‚Äôs 1975 Rocket release Overnight Success, which also contains a Top 10 lounge remake of Neil‚Äôs 1962 No. 1 ‚ÄúBreaking Up Is Hard to Do.‚Äù\n\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\n\nElton John released his ninth album, Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, on May 19, 1975, on DJM and Uni. It‚Äôs a concept album with ten originals that chronicle the plight of Captain Fantastic (John) and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (Taupin) in the early years of their songwriting partnership. Taupin wrote the lyrics chronologically while John composed the music on a cross-sea voyage from London to New York.\n\nMusically, the album balances country (title track), cabaret (‚ÄúBetter Off Dead‚Äù), and ballads (‚ÄúWe All Fall in Love Sometimes‚Äù) with rock raunch (‚Äú(Gotta Get a) Meal Ticket‚Äù) and bouyant ivory-laden numbers (‚ÄúBitter Fingers‚Äù). Each side closes with a slow harmonized epic that unfolds to a grand climax.\n\n1. ‚ÄúCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy‚Äù (5:46)\n\n2. ‚ÄúTower of Babel‚Äù (4:28)\n\n3. ‚ÄúBitter Fingers‚Äù (4:35)\n\n4. ‚ÄúTell Me When the Whistle Blows‚Äù (4:20)\n\n5. ‚ÄúSomeone Saved My Life Tonight‚Äù (6:45)\n\n6. ‚Äú(Gotta Get a) Meal Ticket‚Äù (4:01)\n\n7. ‚ÄúBetter Off Dead‚Äù (2:37)\n\n8. ‚ÄúWriting‚Äù (3:40)\n\n9. ‚ÄúWe All Fall in Love Sometimes‚Äù (4:15)\n\n10. ‚ÄúCurtains‚Äù (6:15)\n\nSessions occurred with Dudgeon in August 1974 at the Caribou Ranch, also used for Chicago VIII and concurrent albums by Joe Walsh, Chicago keyboardist Robert Lamm (Skinny Boy), and the collaborative disc by Mahavishnu Orchestra alumni Jerry Goodman and Jan Hammer (Like Children). Jeff Guercio (James William‚Äôs brother) engineered Captain Fantastic with assistance by third brother Mark Guercio. ‚ÄúTell Me When the Whistle Blows‚Äù features orchestration by Gene Page.\n\nElton John plays grand piano on everything except ‚ÄúWhistle Blows‚Äù and ‚ÄúWriting,‚Äù which feature the Fender Rhodes electric piano, also heard on ‚ÄúSomeone Saved My Life Tonight,‚Äù which also features John on the ARP String Ensemble. He plays clavinet on two tracks (‚ÄúWhistle Blows,‚Äù ‚ÄúMeal Ticket‚Äù) and both harpsichord and Mellotron on the closing pair ‚ÄúWe All Fall in Love Sometimes‚Äù and ‚ÄúCurtains,‚Äù which both feature Hentschel on ARP synthesizer.\n\nDavey Johnstone plays guitar throughout with select instances of mandolin (title track) and piano (‚ÄúWriting‚Äù). Captain Fantastic is Elton‚Äôs last album for eight years with Murray and Olsson, who round out the rhythm section with Cooper, who plays assorted percussion, including gong and jawbone on the title track.\n\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is housed in an elaborate gatefold by illustrators Alan Aldridge and Harry Willock. The front shows Captain Fantastic ‚Äî swarmed by birds, fish, amphibeans, and gargoyle-like critters ‚Äî atop his piano, which tilts above a cottage in a soup bowl. The back shows the Brown Dirt Cowboy inside a crystal ball with ‚Äúcute‚Äù animals (Maxine‚Äôs head appears on a bird‚Äôs body) and members of Elton‚Äôs band in smaller crystals amid the critters, who possibly represent unsavory industry characters that John and Taupin encountered in their career. The inner-gates contain blue-framed photos of the two and Elton‚Äôs five-piece band.\n\nOriginal copies include a poster-size version of the album art; a sixteen-page booklet of lyrics and pics; and a sixteen-page scrapbook of pics, press clippings, and a comic (four pages) titled The Life & Loves of Elton John.\n\nIn late June, DJM and MCA lifted ‚ÄúSomeone Saved My Life Tonight‚Äù as the only Captain Fantastic single, backed with the non-album ‚ÄúHouse of Cards.‚Äù It reached No. 2 in Canada, No. 1 on the Cashbox Top 100 and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 1 in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. It also went Top 10 in Austria (No. 7), Finland (No. 10), Norway (No. 2), and Spain (No. 3). In the US, Captain Fantastic shipped Gold and became the first album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. It sold 1.4 million in its first four days (one year before the RIAA introduced Platinum certification) and held the No. 1 spot for seven weeks.\n\nCaptain Fantastic later certified Platinum in Canada (100,000), double-Platinum in Australia (100,000), and triple-Platinum in the US (3,000,000).\n\nJust prior to the June‚ÄìJuly sessions for his next album, Elton replaced Murray and Olsson with American bassist Kenny Passarelli (of Joe Walsh‚Äôs Barnstorm) and returning drummer Roger Pope (of the now-defunct Hookfoot). He also hired American James Newton Howard (ex-Mama Lion) as his keyboardist and orchestral conductor. Pope‚Äôs colleague Caleb Quaye joined as rhythm guitarist.\n\nElton and the band played a June 21 show at Wembley Stadium, supported by the Beach Boys, Eagles, Joe Walsh, Rufus, and Stackridge, a Kinks-like vaudevillian pop band that signed to Rocket for their 1975 fourth album Extravaganza.\n\nElton played select summer dates, including a June 29 show at Oakland Coliseum with the Doobie Brothers. On July 19, Elton joined the Rolling Stones onstage at Hughes Stadium in Fort Collins, Colorado. He initially joined them to play on ‚ÄúHonky Tonk Women‚Äù but remained onstage throughout the show.\n\nOn July 24, Elton and his band played the 2nd Festival Van De Gouden Leeuw, a two-day event in Blankenberge, Belgium, with sets by Kiki Dee, Leo Sayer, Maggie Bell, Rory Gallagher, and assorted French and Belgian acts, including Joe Dassin and Koen De Bruyne.\n\nIn August, Elton marked the fifth anniversary of his US Troubador debut with a three-night engagement at the Hollywood venue (25‚Äì27), supported by Kiki Dee.\n\nRock of the Westies\n\nElton John released his tenth album, Rock of the Westies, on October 4, 1975, on DJM and Uni. It contains six songs credited to John‚ÄìTaupin and a seventh (‚ÄúHard Luck Story‚Äù) credited to ‚ÄòAnn Orson‚Äô and ‚ÄòCarte Blanche‚Äô (female pseudonyms for the pair). Johnstone helped them write two songs: the three-part medley ‚ÄúYell Help‚Äù and the uptempo rocker ‚ÄúGrow Some Funk of Your Own.‚Äù\n\n1. ‚ÄúMedley: Yell Help / Wednesday Night / Ugly‚Äù (John, Davey Johnstone, Taupin) (6:15)\n\n2. ‚ÄúDan Dare (Pilot of the Future)‚Äù (3:29)\n\n3. ‚ÄúIsland Girl‚Äù (3:42)\n\n4. ‚ÄúGrow Some Funk of Your Own‚Äù (4:47)\n\n5. ‚ÄúI Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford)‚Äù (5:27)\n\n1. ‚ÄúStreet Kids‚Äù (6:25)\n\n2. ‚ÄúHard Luck Story‚Äù (5:16)\n\n3. ‚ÄúFeed Me‚Äù (4:00)\n\n4. ‚ÄúBilly Bones and the White Bird‚Äù (4:25)\n\nRock of the Westies is Elton‚Äôs third consecutive album recorded at the Caribou Ranch, used concurrently by Earth Wind & Fire (That‚Äôs the Way of the World) and Frank Zappa. Sessions occurred in June‚ÄìJuly 1975 with Jeff and Mark Guercio. Gus Dudgeon produced Westies in succession with 1975 albums by Howard Werth & The Moonbeams and Solution, a Dutch jazz-rock band that signed to Rocket for their third album, Cordon Bleu.\n\nJohn restricts himself on Westies to vocals and piano, which he plays on every track except ‚ÄúFeed Me.‚Äù Newton Howard plays electric piano on five tracks; synthesizers on three (‚ÄúGrow Some Funk,‚Äù ‚ÄúRobert Ford,‚Äù ‚ÄúBilly Bones‚Äù); Hohner clavinet on the first two songs and Mellotron on ‚ÄúIsland Girl.‚Äù On the medley, he also plays harpsichord, ARP synthesizer, and Elka Rhapsody string synthesizer.\n\nJohnstone and Quaye double on acoustic guitar on two tracks (‚ÄúGrow Some Funk,‚Äù ‚ÄúRobert Ford‚Äù) and double on electric on six. One exception is ‚ÄúStreet Kids,‚Äù while Johnstone plays slide while Quaye plays electric rhythm and lead. Cooper‚Äôs arsenal includes marimba (‚ÄúIsland Girl‚Äù), tympani (‚ÄúBilly Bones‚Äù), and vibraphone (‚ÄúGrow Some Funk,‚Äù ‚ÄúRobert Ford,‚Äù ‚ÄúFeed Me‚Äù).\n\nLabelle guest as backing vocalists on the medley. Clive Franks does likewise on ‚ÄúFeed Me.‚Äù Kiki Dee sings backup on seven tracks while Elton (under his Ann Orson alter ego) overdubs himself on six.\n\nRock of the Westies is housed in a Larkham-designed single sleeve with ranch-bound photographs by Terry O‚ÄôNeill that show Elton close-up (front), Bernie and the band (back), and individual pics of John, Taupin, and the six musicians (inner sleeve). Original copies contain a two-fold lyrical insert. DJM copies replicate the headshots on the LP labels.\n\nIn late September, DJM lifted ‚ÄúIsland Girl‚Äù as a single, backed with the non-album Kiki Dee cover ‚ÄúSugar on the Floor,‚Äù the closing track on Loving and Free. It went Top 20 in the UK and Australia and reached No. 4 in Canada and New Zealand.\n\nIn the US, ‚ÄúIsland Girl‚Äù reached No. 1 on the Cashbox Top 100 and (for three weeks) the Billboard Hot 100, where it unseated Sedaka‚Äôs ‚ÄúBad Blood.‚Äù It debuted on Billboard after a one-week break in Elton‚Äôs 25-month streak on the Hot 100 (a record topped only by Pat Boone).\n\nTotP aired ‚ÄúIsland Girl‚Äù to a dance segment by Pan‚Äôs People on its October 16 broadcast, which also featured hits by ABBA (‚ÄúS.O.S.‚Äù), The Chi-lites (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Time for Love‚Äù), David Essex (‚ÄúHold Me Close‚Äù), Esther Phillips (‚ÄúWhat a Difference a Day Made‚Äù), Justin Hayward & John Lodge (‚ÄúBlue Guitar‚Äù), and The Trammps (‚ÄúHold Back the Night‚Äù).\n\nRock of the Westies reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 5 in the UK, and No. 4 in Australia and New Zealand. It went Top 10 in Denmark (No. 3), Norway (No. 6), Spain (No. 8), and Sweden (No. 6). In the US, Westies became his seventh and final No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. It later certified Platinum in the US, Canada, and Australia.\n\nElton and his new band (Johnstone, Quaye, Passarelli, Pope, Cooper, Newton Howard) embarked on a sixteen-date, eleven-city US tour with backing vocalists Cindy Bullens, Jon Joyce, and Ken Gold. The tour commenced on September 29 at the San Diego Sports Arena and wrapped two nights (October 25‚Äì26) at LA‚Äôs Dodger Stadium, where they were joined onstage by Billie Jean King and the James Cleveland Choir.\n\n1976\n\nIn January 1976, ‚ÄúGrow Some Funk of Your Own‚Äù reappeared as the second Rock of the Westies single, backed with ‚ÄúI Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford).‚Äù It reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn March, Polydor lifted ‚ÄúPinball Wizard‚Äù from the Tommy soundtrack as a single, backed with the Yellow Brick Road track ‚ÄúHarmony.‚Äù Elton‚Äôs cover of The Who classic reached No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThat spring, John Reid played Elton three songs from a just-recorded album by an EMI artist with no American label. One of the songs, ‚ÄúDevil Woman,‚Äù was written by ex-Twilights guitarist Terry Britten and ex-Family Dogg singer Christine Holmes, who first recorded it under her solo stagename Kristine Sparkle. Elton agreed to sign the mystery artist to Rocket for the US market. To his surprise, he discovered the singer was Cliff Richard, one of Elton‚Äôs boyhood idols. Cliff‚Äôs debut Rocket release, I‚Äôm Nearly Famous, appeared in May 1976 and signaled the singer‚Äôs career renaissance. ‚ÄúDevil Woman‚Äù became the former British teen idol‚Äôs first ever American Top 10 hit.\n\nMeanwhile, Elton became club chairman of Watford F.C., a then-Fourth Division football club from Watford, Hetfordshire, that John (a lifelong fan) intended to lift to First Division (a goal achieved in the 1981‚Äì82 season).\n\nHere and There\n\nOn April 30, 1976, DJM and MCA released Here and There, Elton‚Äôs second live album, sourced from two 1974 shows: the 5/18/74 children‚Äôs benefit at Royal Festival Hall and the 11/24/74 show (with guest John Lennon) at Madison Square Garden.

Dudgeon produced and engineered Here and There with concert soundman Phil Dunne.\n\nPhotographer David Nutter took the album‚Äôs cover images, which show Elton‚Äôs black grand piano (front) and Elton himself in a mink scarf and trench coat perched atop the piano (back). The inner-sleeve contains of photo of his band‚Äôs equipment with Olsson‚Äôs customized kick-drum (DRUMORK) and liner notes by Paul Gambaccini.\n\nHere and There reached No. 6 in the UK, No. 3 in New Zealand, and No. 4 on the Billboard 200.\n\nElton and his Westies backing band (Johnstone, Quaye, Passarelli, Pope, Cooper, Newton Howard) and live vocal trio (Bullens, Gold, Joyce) embarked on the Lounder Than Concorde Tour, and five-week, 21-city UK jaunt that started with an April 29‚Äì30 engagement at the Grand Theatre in Leeds and wrapped with a June 3‚Äì4 showcase at the Capitol Theatre in Cardiff, Wales.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart‚Äù\n\nOn June 21, 1976, Elton John released ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart,‚Äù a duet with Kiki Dee, backed with ‚ÄúSnow Queen.‚Äù\n\nJohn and Taupin co-wrote ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart‚Äù under their pseudonyms Ann Orson and Carte Blanche (also used on ‚ÄúHard Luck Story‚Äù). They selected Dee after their first choice, Dusty Springfield, proved too ill to duet with John. ‚ÄúSnow Queen‚Äù is joint-credited to John, Taupin, Dee, Johnstone, and photographer David Nutter.\n\nJohn plays electric piano on ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart,‚Äù which features five-sixths of his Westies backing band (Quaye, Passarelli, Pope, Cooper, Newton Howard) with uncredited backing vocals by Bullens, Gold, and Joyce. Dudgeon and crew produced the song on March 27 during a break between sessions for Elton‚Äôs next album.\n\nIn the video, Elton (plaid leisure suit) leads Kiki (peach overalls) into a soft-lit studio where the two trade-off at the mic.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart‚Äù reached No. 1 on the UK Singles chart and held that spot for six weeks in the summer of 1976. It also reached No. 1 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia, Ireland, and France. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart‚Äù made the Top 3 in Belgium, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

This marked Elton‚Äôs second consecutive Top 3 Billboard Year-End placement. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart‚Äù was Elton‚Äôs sixth and final Billboard No. 1 (barring his involvement in Dionne & Friends).\n\nThe song‚Äôs success elevated Dee‚Äôs profile after the non-release of Cage the Songbird, her intended 1976 album that got shelved after the chart-stall of its late-1975 advance single ‚ÄúOnce a Fool‚Äù.\n\nLouder Than Concorde Tour (US)\n\nOn June 29, 1976, as ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go Breaking My Heart‚Äù began its chart runs worldwide, Elton and his band launched a sixteen-city US tour dubbed ‚ÄòLouder Than Concorde (But Not Quite as Pretty).‚Äô It commenced with a two-nighter at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, and wrapped in mid-August in New York City, where he played seven nights (Aug. 10‚Äì13 and 15‚Äì17) at Madison Square Garden, followed by the Aug. 18 multi-bill (with Bonnie Riatt and Muddy Waters) of the summer-long Schaefer Music Festival at Wollman Rink in Central Park.
