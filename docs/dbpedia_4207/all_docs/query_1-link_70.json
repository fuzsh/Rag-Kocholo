After a few years, Michael created his own cover band, a funky hard rock group named \"Curious George\". [Thompson, John J. Raised by Wolves: the History of Christian Rock and Roll. ECW P, 2000. 198.] He toured with Chapin and had a few concerts, performing music from Pearl Jam to King's X and The 77's. [cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:anfoxqwkldhe~T1|title=AllMusic Tait Biography|author=Kittle, Ashleigh] [cite web|url=http://www.baylor.edu/Lariat/news.php?action=story&story=12372|title=The Lariat Online- Baylor University|author=Jones, Chris P.|date=Sept. 16, 1998] Afterward was when Tait and Chapin decided that they would eventually get a more permanent music group of their own together and tour the world. [cite web|url=http://lyrics.crossmap.com/artist/tait.htm|title=Tait Biography - Crossmap Lyrics]\n\nMichael and Tait member Pete Stewart also had a friendship before the band's inception. After Stewart had assisted dc Talk by playing guitar on their album Supernatural, Tait and Stewart co-wrote the song \"Uphill Battle\" which was featured on ForeFront records' \"Ten: The Birthday Album\". When Stewart's alternative metal group Grammatrain disbanded in 1998, he went on to co-produce his own solo album with the help of Tait. [cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/artists/petestewart.html|title=Pete Stewart Biography from ForeFront Records via Christianity Today]\n\nEmpty (2000-2002)\n\nWhen dc Talk went on hiatus around 1999, Michael started working unofficially with his own music. As his solo project slowly began to come together, Michael quickly thought of the friendships that within the past few years had become a fundamental part of his career. Pete Stewart came to join Michael, along with the Chapin brothers, Chad and Lonnie who in 1996 had moved to Nashville, Tennessee to see where they could get in the music business. The band officially formed in 2000 and was named Tait after Michael’s father, Rev. Nathel Tait.\n\nAfter about a year in the studio, the band released their first album entitled \"Empty\". It was generally well received, and the album even broke onto the Top Contemporary Christian charts. The album featured songs that handled subjects like skepticism of others (“Spy”), racism (“American Tragedy”) (This album was controversial though, with the use of a racial slur in the middle of this song) and Michael’s outpouring of grief of losing his father, sister and brother all in the same year (“Unglued”). [cite web|url= http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/reviews/2001/empty.html|title= Empty – Review from Christian Music Today|author=Breimeier, Russ]\n\nLose This Life (2003-Present)\n\nAfter the release of the first album, Pete Stewart took his leave from the group. He was replaced by nineteen year-old guitarist Justin York. Once again the band went into the recording studio in 2002 and worked through 2003 to release a new album. The group was successful, and in November they released Dove Award-winning \"Lose This Life\". [cite web|url= http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2004|title= GMA Dove Awards 2004 – Winners]\n\nThe album proved that the group had matured into a much more aggressive hard rock sound compared to \"Empty\"’s more relaxed easy-listening music. [cite web|url= http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/reviews/2003/losethislife.html|title= Lose This Life – Review from Christian Music Today|author=Argyrakis, Andy] Around the time the album was released, band members also participated in the production of !Hero, a rock opera which modernized the life and times of Jesus Christ.\n\nWithin the past few years the band has toured on and off, many times with other CCM artists. When asked about the set-backs of recent band member changes, Tait has stated that “I think [with him] spearheading [the band] — if [he takes] off, then the band does change. If a member changes here and there, it does not affect [the band] a bit…. it does not change a bit of [his] vision for this band.” [cite web|url= http://www.cmusicweb.com/features/dctalksoloupdate/tait.shtml|title= A dc Talk Solo Update: Michael Tait|author=Flanders, Kim|month=October | year=2004] The band does plan to release a third album, \"Loveology \", sometime this fall. Producer and co-writer Ben Moody (best known from Evanescense) has joined the group to help them through the transition. The group will have gone through a major transformation, leaving behind rock and moving into a unique sound Michael himself describes as being “Stevie Wonder meets Maroon 5 meets Lenny Kravitz. . . sort of a groovy pop sound.” [cite web|url= http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/Loveology/27427/p1/|title= Michael Tait dumps rock, embraces R&B-tinged pop]\n\nMembers\n\nCurrent members\n\n*Michael Tait &ndash; vocals, piano\n\n*Evan Weatherford &ndash; guitar\n\n*Jordan Hester &ndash; bass\n\n*Chad Chapin &ndash; drums, percussion\n\nFormer Members\n\n*Pete Stewart &ndash; guitar, synthesizer\n\n*Justin York &ndash; guitar\n\n*Brian Nutter &ndash; guitar\n\n*Lonnie Chapin &ndash; bass\n\n*Dave Clo &ndash; guitar\n\nDiscography\n\n* \"Empty\", ForeFront Records July 3, 2001\n\n* \"Lose This Life\", ForeFront Records November 4, 2003, GMA Dove Award, Rock Album of the Year (2004)\n\nChart History\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links"
