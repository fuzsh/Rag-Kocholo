He first attracted attention as composer for The Love Affair for whom his credits included \"Gone Are The Songs Of Yesterday\" (the flip to their No.1, \"Everlasting Love\") and \"A Day Without Love\". Earlier in 1966, he'd recorded three 45s for Parlophone with The Stormville Shakers which hadn't sold at all well, prior to the band renaming themselves Circus and recording an eponymous album for Transatlantic.\n\nIn the seventies, he was heavily promoted as a piano-playing singer/songwriter, but he failed to achieve anything like the success of Elton John. Some of his compositions were later recorded by Roger Daltrey.\n\nPhilip Goodhand-Tait and The Stormville Shakers also backed Larry Williams and Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson on a UK tour and an album, \"The Larry Williams Show\" (Decca), recorded prior to Larry's return to the USA.\n\nCompilation appearances include: \"I'm Gonna Put Some Hurt On You\" on \"Go... With An All Star\" (LP).\n\nTaken from The Tapestry of Delights - The Comprehensive Guide to British Music of the Beat, R&B, Psychedelic and Progressive Eras 1963-1976, Vernon Joynson ISBN 1 899855 04 1"
