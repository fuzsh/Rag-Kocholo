        "text": "Camel fans have had the hump for years,\n\nsince their heroes have gone into semiretirement\n\nand spent three decades\n\nunder the rock radar. While the likes of\n\nKing Crimson, Yes, Pink Floyd and Genesis have\n\nbeen given their dues, Camel remained in the\n\nshadows. Yet the band produced some of the finest\n\nalbums in prog and went on to influence neo-proggers\n\nsuch as Galahad and Pendragon, and\n\nlatter-day acts like The Flower Kings and Opeth.\n\nThis year, six of their albums have been given the\n\nexpanded, deluxe treatment, to remind us of what a\n\ngreat band they really were.\n\nCamel evolved from a beat outfit formed in\n\nGuildford in 1964 by the Latimer brothers, Ian\n\n(bass) and Andrew (guitar/vocals). Along with\n\nchums Alan Butcher (drums) and Richard Over\n\n(guitar) they operated as The Phantom Four and,\n\nwhen Over left and was replaced by Graham\n\nCooper, they became Strange Brew (after The\n\nCream’s song). In summer 1968, Latimer and\n\nCooper departed for family life, and an ad in The\n\nSurrey Advertiser led them to bassist Doug Ferguson.\n\nFerguson introduced his colleagues to a 14-year old\n\ndrummer, Andy Ward, and impressed by his chops,\n\nhe was recruited in January 1969.\n\nThe Brew, as they became, recorded a demo of\n\nThe Cream’s Crossroads for DJM, who urged them\n\nto take a gig backing keyboardist/singer Philip\n\nGoodhand-Tait. In 1971, they played on his I Think\n\nI’ll Write A Song, but it failed to take off and the trio\n\nwere dropped by the label. However, an ad in The\n\nMelody Maker that September led them to recruit a\n\nkeyboardist of their own, Peter Bardens. He’d played with Shotgun Express, Van Morrison’s Them and\n\nPeter B’s Looners, and cut two Transatlantic solo\n\nalbums (The Answer, and an eponymous effort, both\n\nRRPG-rated at £30). In October, the four played as\n\nPeter Bardens’ On, before changing their name to\n\nCamel. Their first show under that banner was in\n\nDecember, supporting Wishbone Ash.\n\nTouring through 1972 and winning over a\n\ngrowing student following, that August they were\n\npicked up by MCA. Despite auditioning 30 singers,\n\nthey pressed on without a frontman. They swiftly\n\nrecorded a single, Never Let Go, issued that\n\nNovember, and an impressive eponymous debut set\n\nwas cut in 12 days, which Latimer subsequently\n\nrecalled was “a bloody nightmare”! It featured rock\n\nsongs such as Mystic Queen and instrumental jams\n\nwith shifting time-signatures, notably in 6/8, such as\n\nArubaluba and, er, Six Ate. However, when Camel’s\n\ndebut was issued in time for Christmas 1973, it\n\nfailed to set the world alight. At the start of 1974,\n\nthey were dropped by MCA and signed with the\n\nmore prog-friendly Decca.\n\nAfter nine months on the road, Camel retired to\n\nthe studio to cut Mirage, in March 1974. Its sleeve\n\nfeatured a version of the US Camel cigarette brand’s\n\npackaging, but the company threatened to sue, so it\n\nwas dropped in that territory, while a European\n\nmarketing deal cut by the band’s management\n\nwithout their knowledge saw free cigarettes given\n\naway with the album, prompting Bardens to suggest\n\nrenaming one song Twenty Sticks Of Cancer.\n\nDespite the rancour that this caused, the set\n\nconsolidated their prog credentials, mixing short\n\nenergetic numbers such as Freefall with flowing\n\nextended pieces, including the gentle Lady Fantasy\n\nand Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider,\n\nwhich was inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord Of\n\nThe Rings. Sounds noted, “you don’t listen to a band\n\nlike Camel for quick thrills. You really have to hear\n\nthem a few times before the music begins to register.\n\nAll those long and delicately arranged instrumental\n\npassages burn slow, but once the melodies are in\n\nyour head, they don’t rub out easily”.\n\nFerguson suggested that their third outing should\n\nbe a concept album based on another book, and\n\nBardens nominated Herman Hesse’s Siddhartha.\n\nDemos were cut in June 1974, but the concept was\n\nabandoned as unworkable. Hence, Ferguson\n\nproposed Paul Gallico’s The Snow Goose novella and,\n\nafter a seven-week US tour with Wishbone Ash,\n\nLatimer and Bardens set to work on it. In the\n\ninterim, they gained street cred by playing the\n\nGreasy Truckers’ Party at London’s Camden\n\nDingwalls club that October, alongside the likes of\n\nspace-rockers Gong and Henry Cow.\n\nCamel debuted their Music Inspired By The Snow\n\nGoose in September 1974 and the resultant\n\ninstrumental opus, realised in 16 orchestral\n\nmovements, saw them make No. 22 in spring 1975.\n\nContaining shimmering, flute-led passages like the\n\ntitle, it won them Melody Maker’s Brightest Hope\n\nOf 1975 accolade. That October, it was rendered\n\nwith the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal\n\nAlbert Hall. (It was issued in April 1978 as the 2-LP\n\nA Live Record).\n\n1976’s Moonmadness features songs inspired by\n\nthe band members’ personalities, notably Chord\n\nChange (Bardens), Another Night (Ferguson), Air\n\nBorn (Latimer) and Lunar Sea (Ward). The overall\n\nfeel was less flighty and more akin to the heavier\n\npomp efforts of Pink Floyd, as demonstrated on\n\nSong Within A Song. The set won over US critics\n\nand bettered its predecessor in the UK charts,\n\nnotching up a No. 15 placing.\n\nThat September’s Rain Dances saw Latimer,\n\nBardens, Ward and Sinclair (on lead vocals) assisted\n\nby numerous guests and made No. 20. Producer\n\nRhett Davis brought in recent collaborator, ex-Roxy\n\nMusic’s Brian Eno, who supplied electronic sound\n\neffects to supplement the band’s jazzy orchestral\n\narrangements. Fans and critics alike praised the likes\n\nof the prog Unevensong, Skylines and the title track,\n\nwhile punchier elements included Metrognome.\n\nBreathless appeared within a year of its\n\npredecessor, combining soft-rockers such as Echoes\n\nwith Canterbury whimsy, such as Sinclair’s belchladen\n\nDown On The Farm. However, in July, just\n\nprior to another tour, Bardens walked out, going on\n\nto play with Van Morrison on Wavelength, as well as\n\nhis solo Heart To Heart. Following a three-month\n\ntour, Breathless hit No. 26 and Dave Sinclair left,\n\nRichard accompanying him. Thus, Happy The\n\nMan’s Kit Watkins took over on keyboards, while\n\nthe ironically-named Colin Bass wielded the bass\n\nguitar.\n\nIn between heavy touring, the more accessible,\n\nRupert Hine-produced I Can See Your House From\n\nHere was cut. It featured proggier moments such as\n\nIce, but also more pop-rock, as well as three Colins:\n\nBass, Mel and Genesis’ Phil (on percussion). It\n\npeaked at No. 45.\n\nWatkins departed just before the band entered the\n\nstudio to record their next concept piece, Nude, and\n\nCockney Rebel’s Duncan Mackay filled in. Issued in\n\nJanuary 1981, the new opus focused on the true\n\nstory of a Japanese soldier left on an island after\n\nWorld War 2. It made No. 34.\n\nWatkins returned for a world tour and promptly\n\nleft after its conclusion, Ward’s alcohol and drug\n\nmisuse having led to a suicide attempt, followed by a\n\nsabbatical. Bass followed suit and, under pressure\n\nfrom the label for a radio-friendly single, Latimer\n\ncalled The Alan Parsons Project’s singer Chris\n\nRainbow to help out with The Single Factor.\n\nEmerging in April 1982, the platter made No. 57,\n\nand both Bass and Ward returned to the fold for\n\nanother world tour. However, citing his distaste for\n\nthe heavy workload and the music industry in general,\n\nWard stood down in January 1983 (though fans were\n\ntold that he’d injured his hand – he eventually took\n\nup market gardening in Suffolk), and he was replaced\n\nby Jethro Tull’s Paul Burgess, while Kayak’s Ton\n\nScherpenzeel took over on keyboards.\n\nTheir collective APP-sounding effort, March\n\n1984’s Stationary Traveller, was inspired by the\n\ndivided city of Berlin and reached No. 57. A May\n\nshow at London’s Hammersmith Odeon recorded by\n\nPMV (featuring Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno\n\nTonioli), became the 1985 Pressure Points album and\n\nvideo, featuring Bardens, Collins and keyboardist\n\nRichie Close, who died a few months after from\n\nLegionnaire’s Disease.\n\nAt that point, Camel were hit by a law-suit brought\n\nby their ex-manager, Geoff Jukes. Latimer, Bardens,\n\nWard and Ferguson then filed their own action\n\nagainst Gama (Decca Europe) for unpaid royalties, a\n\ndispute that was resolved in their favour in March\n\n1985, freeing them from their Decca contract. The\n\nCollection and A Compact Compilation followed later\n\nthat year, but it was not until 1988 that the Jukes case\n\nwas resolved to Latimer’s satisfaction, and the long\n\nstruggle took its toll. Ward also ‘officially’ left the\n\nband, never to play with them again.\n\nAfter futile attempts to gain a UK record deal, a\n\ndisillusioned Latimer decided to move to the US. He\n\nset up Camel Productions, hoping to issue the longgestating\n\nDust And Dreams, which was inspired by\n\nJohn Steinbeck’s The Grapes Of Wrath. It was partly\n\nre-recorded in 1990 and was eventually self-released in\n\nSeptember 1992, following the Landscapes 2-CD\n\ncollection of 1991. The new studio set comprised\n\nsuperlative atmospheric, mainly instrumental\n\nnumbers. Soon afterwards, reissues of the some of the\n\nband’s catalogue and an Official Bootleg series of\n\nrecordings appeared.\n\nWarning: Camel On The Road 1972 kicked things\n\noff and, by August 1992, that’s where the band were\n\nonce more. Burgess, Bass and Fish keyboardist Mickey\n\nSimmonds were roped in by Latimer, and a show at\n\nEnschede, The Netherlands, was captured as the Never\n\nLet Go (Live 92) 2-CD and unveiled in November\n\n1993 (complementing the Echoes 2-CD anthology).\n\nHowever, in March 1993, Latimer’s father died,\n\nand Andy spent much of 1994 researching his\n\ngenealogy for the personal Harbour Of Tears concept\n\nalbum about the Irish emigrations of the 19th century\n\nvia Cobh Harbour to the USA. In March 1995,\n\nLatimer returned to the studio with Bass, Simmonds,\n\nPaton, McKenna and San Francisco drum instructor\n\nJohn Xepoleas. The Celtic-toned set, issued in January\n\n1996, included The Hour Candle (A Song For My\n\nFather).\n\nFollowing 1997’s vintage On The Road 1981,\n\nLatimer issued 1998’s Coming Of Age – Live, recorded\n\nthe previous March in Hollywood, with Bardens\n\nwatching in the wings.\n\nSoon afterwards, Bass gave Latimer a copy of the\n\nWorld Music – A Rough Guide book and he took\n\ninspiration from its entry about Arab musical poetry,\n\nrajaz, which was spontaneously sung to the rhythm\n\nof camel footsteps. Scherpenzeel contributed via\n\nemail some mesmeric key patterns that\n\nsupplemented the guitar soundscapes of Latimer,\n\nBass and Stewart and, by October 1999, Rajaz was\n\nready. Another tour was planned, but just before it\n\nkicked off in spring 2000, Stewart dropped out to\n\nrun a drum shop in Edinburgh. Clive Bunker (ex-\n\nJethro Tull) was approached to join Camel, but\n\nrehearsals didn’t work out, so LeBlanc’s compatriot,\n\nDenis Clement, stepped in. They hit the road in\n\nAugust 2000 and, in March 2001, Camel at last\n\nreceived some of the recognition that they deserved,\n\nfeaturing as they did in Channel 4 TV’s Top 10 Of\n\nProg Rock.\n\nWithin a year, Peter Bardens died of cancer in Los\n\nAngeles in January 2002, and The Paris Collection\n\nlive album, recorded at the Bataclan in September\n\n2000, appeared, along with Lunar Sea: An Anthology\n\n1973-85. In August 2002, the band’s A Nod And A\n\nWink, based on the events of 9/11, saw Latimer,\n\nBass, LeBlanc and Clement joined by drummer\n\nTerry Carleton. A Farewell Tour in 2003 brought\n\nScherpenzeel back to the fold in Europe, and the\n\nband headlined NEARFest, with Tom Brislin from\n\nSpiraling on keys. However, after toying with the\n\nidea of recording an acoustic set, Latimer, suffering\n\nfrom the rare, chronically fatiguing blood disorder,\n\nmyelofibrosis, took time out, before issuing the\n\nFootage I and II DVDs in October 2005, and\n\nrelocating to the UK a year later. Latimer’s illness was\n\nrevealed via the band’s website in May 2007, as well\n\nas his intention to produce another Camel album.\n\nAfter stem cell replacement at the end of the year, he\n\nwas recovering and planning for the future, while\n\nEclectic issued 2-CD deluxe editions through 2009."
