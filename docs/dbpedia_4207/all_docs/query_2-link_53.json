It is a blue-eyed soul-floor filler, where Fay Hallam’s keyboards soften the rhythmic section while Luca Re’s voice makes the piece, if possible, even more striking.\n\nThe B-side is written by Peter Twyman and Andy Lewis and translated into Italian by Luca Re for the occasion. The song is interpreted by the beautiful voice of Fay Hallam and we experience again an irresistible soul groove.\n\nIt is a limited edition of just 300 copies: hurry up to get yours!"
