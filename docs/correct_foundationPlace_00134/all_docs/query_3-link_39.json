        "text": "Marta Antonelli has been exploring how to accelerate the transition towards sustainable food systems as business advisor, researcher, and lecturer over the past 12 years. Her expertise lies in food, water and agricultural policy; sustainable and healthy diets; urban food systems; food waste; climate change; the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAs Food Systems Project Lead at Global Footprint Network, she contributes to research on the Ecological Footprint of food and the Food4Future project.\n\nShe earned a Ph.D. in Environment, Politics and Development (King’s College London), with a thesis on food and water security in the Middle East and North African region. She received a MSc in International Economics (La Sapienza University of Rome) and a MSc in Development Studies (School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London).\n\nShe has authored 50+ publications in scientific journals, reports, books, as well as articles on media outlets. She co-edited the book Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals through Sustainable Food Systems (Springer, 2019).\n\nShe is one of the 45 members of the expert group of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre that will help develop the legislative framework of the Farm to Fork Strategy.\n\nMarta lives in Zurich. She enjoys working in multidisciplinary teams, the great outdoors, and good music.\n\nAs Chief Science Officer at Global Footprint Network, David Lin oversees the science related to Ecological Footprint and biocapacity accounting. He brings scientific rigor, technical expertise, and creativity to the research, data products, tools, and applications we provide at Global Footprint Network. Drawing on his experience leading the production and improvement of the National Footprint and Biocapacity accounts (NFBA), he now serves as member of the NFBA Science Advisory Committee. He previously led the cities and local government program and continues to bring a strong passion to working with various stakeholders to envision and achieve a sustainable future.\n\nPrior to joining Global Footprint Network, David earned his Ph.D. and worked as a post-doctoral researcher in the Systems Ecology Laboratory at the University of Texas at El Paso. His research brought him to Arctic regions of Russia and Alaska, and he developed and deployed rapid assessment sensor systems, and applied geospatial tools and statistical models to understand the effect of land cover change on ecosystem function in Arctic tundra ecosystems and predict the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas dynamics. David is a native of California and holds a BS in Biology with specialization in Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution from the University of California, Los Angeles. On most weekends you can find him enjoying nature, hiking and rock climbing in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nDebora manages projects, coordinates the board and Global Footprint Network operations, and also is engaging in project development. She loves developing strategy, mounting participatory projects, and finding ways to grow motivation for the needed sustainability transition.\n\nDebora wrote her master dissertation on “Tourism and Sustainable Development: toward a Tourism Net Impact Index” in synergy with Global Footprint Network, IUCN, WWF-Med and CAST Rimini. The research consisted of a review assessment on social, economic and environmental indicators (Footprint included) aiming to work as a baseline to develop an integrated tool assessing tourism’s impact. Debora holds an international master degree in Tourism Economics and Management. She has former working experience in tourism: as a trainee for the European Institute of Cultural Routes (Erasmus +) and the Italian Institute of Culture in Shanghai (MAECI-MIUR-CRUI scholarship), as selling and reservation manager for a local travel agency promoting local tourism in Maldives. Having always been passionate about sustainability, she initially joined Global Footprint Network to support the research team in the implementation of tourism-related projects and other projects in the Mediterranean region.\n\nSandra Browne is serving as interim CFO and currently is the Chief Operating Officer of Industrial Logic, Inc. She also was Global Footprint Network’s COO from 2011 to 2018, where she created HR processes for recruiting and performance management, aided the creation of a revised strategic plan, and implemented systems for tracking operations and finance analytics to enable timely, data-driven decisions.\n\nSandra has 20 years of experience as a business operations executive for technical and scientific organizations. She earned her MBA from UC Berkeley with an emphasis in organizational behavior and strategy. Throughout her career Sandra has focused on creating high-performance cultures that are financially stable and data-driven.\n\nPrior to working at Footprint Network, Sandra managed company-wide operations for several consulting companies, including a multi-office transportation engineering firm and a global agile software development company. She was also the VP of Engineering for a software consulting firm, where she managed custom software development projects for enterprise clients.\n\nSandra’s interests include global travel and volleyball. She lives in California with her husband and two children.\n\nFlorence is a multifaceted activist, focusing on population issues, girls’ rights, and environmental protection. Her involvement with Global Footprint Network began in 2021 as a consultant when she created the “What About Population?” video. This video guides users of our Ecological Footprint Calculator, who are curious about the population dimension. Previously in 2020, she contributed a piece on the significance of population, as part of the Power of Possibility solutions. Currently, she supports us with email engagement and social media.\n\nFlorence also works with Population Matters, a UK-based charity advocating internationally for a sustainable human population. This organization promotes ethical, choice-based methods to achieve this goal, ultimately protecting the environment and improving lives. An award-winning journalist, Florence’s career began in 2010 with media outlets in Kenya and Uganda. Since then, she has consistently campaigned and communicated about the interconnectedness of population, health, and the environment. Florence holds a Master of Science in Population and Development from the London School of Economics and Political Science, LSE.\n\nIn her free time, Florence pursues a well-rounded life. She balances attending Samba and yoga classes with spending quality time with her family and enjoys socializing with friends. Additionally, she’s passionately building a project called FlowReady, a menstruation awareness campaign that aims to prepare girls in rural communities for their menstrual cycles.\n\nAlessandro is a macro-ecologist and sustainability scientist with a passion for anthropology and human behavior. His research focuses on the overall human metabolism (e.g., land-use, agriculture, fisheries, energy and climate change) and how it squares with the planet’s limits, especially in key societal sectors such as food, tourism and education.
