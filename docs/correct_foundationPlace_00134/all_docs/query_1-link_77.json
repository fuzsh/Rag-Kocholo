        "text": "The United States Extremely Large Telescope Program (US-ELTP) today announced it has received $15.3 million from the National Science Foundation to support further design and development of advanced optical technologies and user services. The funding consists of one-year awards of $2.3 million to NSF’s NOIRLab managed by AURA, and $6.5 million each to the organizations building the Giant Magellan Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope.\n\nThe NSF awards come after the US-ELTP was ranked as the highest ground-based priority in the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020, published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The survey emphasized that the US-ELTP “capabilities can be brought to bear on nearly all of the important science questions laid out by this decadal survey, across all three of our key science themes.”\n\nThe US-ELTP would enable unmatched observations from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths with up to 200 times the sensitivity of today’s largest telescopes. The advanced capabilities would help answer some of the most pressing science questions by searching for signs of life on exoplanets, unraveling the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy, and untangling the interconnected evolution of galaxies, black holes, and their environments.\n\nThe awards help the US-ELTP prepare for the next steps in NSF’s process to determine if it will ultimately fund construction of the telescopes. If constructed, the Thirty Meter Telescope in the Northern Hemisphere and the Giant Magellan Telescope in the Southern Hemisphere in Chile would provide astronomers in the US with nationally-funded open access to observing time on both instruments. US astronomers would have a modern suite of NOIRLab-software and user and data services designed to make maximum use of this all-sky capability through the lifecycle of scientific inquiry.\n\nThe overlapping observing coverage of the US-ELTP provides US astronomers with unfettered all-sky access from the Giant Magellan Telescope in the Southern Hemisphere and the Thirty Meter Telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. The timezone separation between the sites would increase the system’s capabilities for time-domain astrophysics. Credit: US-ELTP (TIO/NOIRLab/GMTO)\n\nAbout the US Extremely Large Telescope Program"
