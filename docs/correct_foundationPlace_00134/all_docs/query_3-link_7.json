        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., Aug. 5, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Agile2013 -- Tasktop Technologies (www.tasktop.com), the industry leader for ALM integration, and Serena Software, the leader in Orchestrated Application Development & Release Management, today announced the formation of a strategic partnership. As part of this agreement, Tasktop will develop, and Serena will offer, OEM versions of Tasktop Dev and Tasktop Sync for Serena Business Manager (SBM), which acts as the process foundation underpinning Serena's orchestrated ALM solutions. The combined solutions will extend Serena's business process automation capabilities by integrating SBM with other leading third-party ALM systems, providing process orchestration across a wide variety of products from disparate vendors. The results are improved collaboration among diverse teams and disciplines, and complete visibility, traceability and reporting across a broad range of ALM systems.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130315/LA78208LOGO)\n\n\"SBM enables IT organizations to cost-effectively streamline and automate processes across application and product development, IT Operations and business service management. The partnership with Tasktop helps us realize our vision of Orchestrated ALM,\" said Carl Landers, VP Marketing for Serena Software. \"By coupling SBM's ability to orchestrate application development and operations processes, with Tasktop's leading integration technology, we're able to satisfy our customers' needs of automating those processes across a wide variety of systems.\"\n\nAs part of this partnership, Tasktop is building Tasktop Dev and Tasktop Sync connectors for Serena SBM. Tasktop Dev provides Serena users the ability to access and manage SBM directly from within the Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio IDEs. The task-focused interface experience for Eclipse further streamlines development and team communication by automatically focusing the developer on the artifacts that are relevant for a given task. Tasktop Sync provides server-side integration between Serena Business Manager and other leading ALM products, providing SBM users the ability to orchestrate processes across numerous third-party ALM systems such as HP ALM, HP Quality Center, IBM Rational Team Concert, Atlassian JIRA, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, Bugzilla, CA Clarity Agile, and many more.\n\n\"While individual stakeholders will continue to insist on their system of choice, to realize the benefits of DevOps the modern IT organization needs a unified layer of orchestration,\" said Mik Kersten, co-founder and CEO for Tasktop. \"This joint solution will combine Tasktop's integration infrastructure and tools with Serena's SBM solution to provide the benefits of Orchestrated IT in heterogeneous and developer-centric environments.\"\n\nGeneral availability for both the Tasktop Dev and Tasktop Sync connectors is expected in Q4 2013 and will be demonstrated at Serena xChange in September.\n\nTweet this: #Tasktop and #Serena announce partnership: Tasktop #Dev and #Sync for Serena Business Manager #SBM\n\nAbout Serena Software\n\nSerena Software provides Application Development & Release Management solutions to the Global 2000.
