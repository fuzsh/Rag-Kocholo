American teenager Coco Gauff would make her Top 10 debut after reaching the Roland Garros final, as the youngest to grace the Top 10 in nearly 16 years. Later in the year, in September, legend Serena Williams announced her retirement after an illustrious career that was highlighted by winning 73 singles titles, including 23 Grand Slams, while spending 319 weeks as WTA World No.1 along with a lengthy list of accolades. The 2022 season concluded with the WTA Finals staged in Fort Worth, Texas, with Caroline Garcia capturing the Billie Jean King Trophy. In March the WTA announced the largest global sponsorship in WTA history with a multi-year alliance with a medical technology leader, becoming the Hologic WTA Tour. With a shared vision of greater wellness and equality for women, the partnership expanded health resources for WTA athletes and elevated fundraising for the WTA Foundation’s Acing Cancer program.

While paying homage to its founding members and influential milestones, the year also saw emerging talents and intense rivalries. Iga Swiatek's six-title performance, Elina Svitolina's comeback, and Coco Gauff's rise were standout moments of the season, drawing a year-end record global audience of over 1 billion. Beyond on-court action, the WTA solidified its dominance in women's sports with double-digit revenue growth and investments from CVC Capital Partners and Morgan Stanley. Core innovations included the launch of WTA Ventures, a groundbreaking commercial arm of the WTA, a $400M roadmap targeting equal pay by 2033, and innovative event formats aimed at enhancing media exposure and fan engagement. Other notable programs included the debut of Netflix’s docuseries, BreakPoint, a newly established Hologic WTA Women’s Health Taskforce, and new online abuse protection services for players."
