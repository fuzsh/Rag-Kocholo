For instance, a headline like “Annual Fundraiser Raises Over $50,000 for Children’s Hospital” immediately indicates the achievement and the cause of the organization.\n\nDevelop a Strong Lead Sentence: The opening sentence should grab attention and be concise, building upon the headline and expanding on the key points of your story.\n\nInclude a Dateline: This might seem minor, but it’s important to include a clear and accurate dateline, featuring the city, state, and date, in a consistent format.\n\nIntegrate Quotes in the Body: The body of the press release should communicate your organization’s goals and explain why the story is newsworthy, focusing on relevant information and important details. Use direct quotes from experts to give readers an insight into the scale of your work.\n\nAdd Visuals and Assets: Including your organization’s logo and media contact information is crucial. Embedding social media posts directly into your press release can make it stand out.\n\nProvide Contact and Boilerplate Information: The last paragraph should include organizational information, like an “About Us” section, and media contact details. Include names, email addresses, phone numbers, website URLs, and social media handles.\n\nStructure Your Press Release Well: Use the inverted pyramid style, with the most newsworthy information first, followed by important details, and then general information and background.\n\nMake Your Press Release Social and Shareable: Include photos or videos, social media handles, and ensure mobile compatibility. Focus on distribution by reaching out to specific journalists and amplifying your coverage on social media and your website.\n\nAdd Extra Elements to Your Story: Include powerful quotes, case studies, testimonials, and hard numbers to support your announcement. Photos and videos are a bonus.\n\nBuild Relationships with Journalists: Customize your pitches, ensure your copy is error-free, and be mindful of journalists’ schedules and preferences.\n\nDistribute your Press Release to Targeted Journalists: We recommend using a press release distribution service to expand your press release distribution to highly targeted members of the media, influencers, and bloggers to increase your impact.\n\nRemember, a good nonprofit press release tells a story that resonates with your audience and provides them with necessary context and compelling reasons to care about your cause.\n\n8 Nonprofit Press Release Templates\n\nWe know that it’s always easier to write a press release when you can plug your information into a template. So, here are eight press release templates for different scenarios for a nonprofit organization:\n\n1: Template for Celebrating a Nonprofit Anniversary:\n\n2. Template for Announcing a New Community Program:\n\n3. Template for Reporting a Successful Fundraising Event:\n\n4. Template for Announcing a Strategic Partnership:\n\n5. Template for Highlighting Volunteer Efforts/Community Service:\n\n6. Template for Reporting a Major Donation or Grant:\n\n7. Template for Announcing a New Executive Appointment:\n\n8. Template for Launching a New Research or Advocacy Campaign:\n\nWe hope you find these templates valuable. Of course, each template needs to be customized with specific details about the nonprofit organization, its mission, achievements, and upcoming plans, to effectively communicate with the media and public.\n\n50 Reasons for a Nonprofit to Create a Press Release\n\nIf you’re a nonprofit who’s sold on the concept of using the power of press releases to build your impact, get more donors, get more
