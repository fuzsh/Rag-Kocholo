        "text": "Diversity is a hot topic in the tech industry — and because it’s discussed frequently, it might be easy to feel like things have already changed. But according to data from a survey from Women Tech Network, women earn around $15,000 less per year than their male counterparts, with an average annual salary of $60,828 for women compared to $85,000 for men. The numbers are worse for Black and Latina women who earn even less with an average salary of $52,000 per year.\n\nMoreover, lack of representation of women at senior levels in IT is notable, with women facing more barriers when climbing the leadership ladder. For every 100 men promoted to managerial positions in tech, only 87 women and 82 women of color earned the same promotion, the Women Tech Network survey found.\n\nWhether you already have a strong network of women colleagues in your industry or if you’re looking to expand your community, there are several conferences designed for women in IT. And most aren’t just for women — they’re open to allies and anyone who supports diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\nWomen in Cybersecurity\n\nThe Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) conference was established in 2012 by Dr. Ambareen Siraj of Tennessee Tech University through a National Science Foundation grant.

The conference takes place over two days and gives WiCyS members and nonmembers a chance to network with other women in the industry and get updates on the latest cybersecurity trends.\n\nDate: April 11-13, 2024\n\nLocation: Nashville, Tenn.\n\nTicket price: $600 for members of WiCyS, $850 for nonmembers; discounts for students, faculty, government workers, and nonprofit employees\n\nWomen in Tech Festival\n\nThe Women in Tech Festival is an event to celebrate women in STEM, business and leadership positions, and anyone who supports the advancement of women and diversity. It’s a two-day event with speakers, startup pitches, group discussions, educational workshops, and career mentorship sessions. This year’s event is taking place in London, with the promise to bring together “women across the IT channel” who want to connect, empower, and cultivate women leaders.\n\nDate: November 5, 2024\n\nLocation: London\n\nTicket price: $377\n\nWomen in Tech Global Conference 2024\n\nThe Women in Tech Global Conference 2024 Is an event for software engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists, and business managers in the tech industry to come together to connect, collaborate, and grow.

The event includes speakers, career advice, workshops for professional development, networking opportunities, and a focus on improving DEI in the industry.\n\nDate: May 2-3, 2024\n\nLocation: Philadelphia and virtual\n\nTicket price: $70-$350\n\nWomen of Silicon Valley\n\nThe Women of Silicon Valley conference is a two-day event that brings together more than 2,700 tech industry professionals from major corporations and startups across the country.
