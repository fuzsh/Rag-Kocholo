Notwithstanding the forgoing, if the Board of Directors of the Corporation elects to seek and obtains an exemption for the Corporation from federal taxation pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \"IRC\"), and until such time, if ever, that such exemption is denied or lost, the Corporation shall not be empowered to engage directly or indirectly in any activity which the Corporation believes would be likely to invalidate its status as an organization exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(a) of the IRC as an organization described in Section 501(c) of the IRC.\n\nNo part of the net earnings of the Corporation shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, the Corporation's members, directors or officers, or any other private person, except that the Corporation shall be authorized and empowered to pay reasonable compensation for services rendered and to make payments and distributions in furtherance of the purposes herein set forth.\n\nThe Corporation shall be a membership corporation and shall not have the authority to issue capital stock.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to Section 501(a) of the IRC at the time of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, then the Board of Directors shall make such distribution(s) in such manner as the Board of Directors may determine to the best suited to the accomplishment of the purposes of the Corporation as set forth in Article 3 above and within the intent of Section 501(c) of the IRC.\n\nAfter the original or other Bylaws of the Corporation have been adopted, amended or repealed, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of Section 109 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation may be exercised by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation.\n\nElections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its members for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.\n\nFrom time to time any of the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the members of the Corporation by this Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article 11.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned incorporator has hereunto set his hand, declaring and certifying under penalties of perjury that the foregoing instrument is his act and deed and that the facts stated herein are true, this 25th day of March, 1999."
