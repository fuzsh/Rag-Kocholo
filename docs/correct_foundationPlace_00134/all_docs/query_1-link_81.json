        "text": "The Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation was created in 1955 by Charles Glass Greenshields, Q.C., a distinguished Montreal lawyer and amateur artist, in memory of his mother, Elizabeth.\n\nMr. Greenshields firmly believed that discipline, hard work and serious training in the traditional means of artistic expression were fundamental to the growth and development of the artist. His determination to help dedicated young artists and students pursue the mastery of the traditional techniques and workmanship in painting and sculpture prompted him to establish and endow a foundation for this purpose.\n\nTo date, the Foundation has provided financial assistance to more than 2000 students and artists from 80 countries.\n\nMr. Greenshields personally directed the Foundation that he created for the first 13 years of its existence and remained active in its organization until his death, in 1974. His vision and his mission live on through the foundation that he so generously endowed.\n\nIn recognition of its unwavering commitment to supporting students and emerging artists in representational art since 1955, the Foundation was awarded the Excellence in Fine Art Education Award from the Portrait Society of America in 2016 and the Gari Melchers Memorial Medal from the Artists' Fellowship in 2021.\n\nMr. Greenshields directed that the funds of the Foundation be used to help young artists acquire the necessary training, skills and competence in the traditional artistic methods, specifically excluding all grants to those “who show clearly a disposition to use the purely abstract or non-objective method in their work.”\n\nThe philosophy outlined by Mr. Greenshields in his endowment has informed the mission of the Foundation over the previous 68 years and it continues to do so to this day.\n\nThe Foundation provides financial assistance, by way of grants, to young artists who are pursuing their studies or are in the early stage of their career, are working in a representational style of painting, drawing, sculpture or printmaking, and demonstrate the determination and talent to pursue a lifetime career in their art practice.The Foundation does not provide funding for the pursuit of abstract or non-objective art.\n\nThe Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation grant is one of the most prestigious grants available to emerging representational artists, as well as one of the most substantial. It is one of the longest standing, with an illustrious history of recipients spanning more than half a century. It is also unique in its scope, in that it is available to students and artists around the world.\n\nThe Foundation's grantees are renowned artists, both nationally and internationally, as well as highly respected art professors, teachers and mentors. The Foundation is extremely proud of its grantees and of their accomplishments. A selection of the works of some of the Foundation’s previous grantees can be found in the Gallery.\n\nFirst grants are in the amount of CAD $17,000 each. Subsequent grants are in the amount of CAD $20,000 each. Grants are made directly to the beneficiaries, not to or through other organizations.\n\nGrantees may not receive more than three grants in their lifetime.\n\nGrants are awarded based solely on the information contained in the Application Form and the supporting documentation and material submitted with it. The Foundation does not conduct personal interviews. The decision of the Foundation is final and is not subject to review or appeal.\n\nELIGIBILITY Open all\n\n+\n\nI am not sure if I am eligible to apply. How can I find out?\n\nThe Foundation will only fund young artists who are pursuing their studies or in the early stage of their career and studying/working in painting, sculpture, printmaking, or drawing in the figurative/representational tradition. No other disciplines or activities are funded.\n\nPlease carefully review the “Eligibility” section of our website and the FAQs below to determine whether you are eligible..\n\n+\n\nHow can I know if my work is within the mandate of the Foundation?\n\nThe Foundation is only permitted to fund painting, sculpture, printmaking or drawing in the figurative/representational tradition. Abstract or non-objective art is not within the Foundation’s mandate.\n\nTo determine whether your work is eligible, we suggest that you view the works of our grantees found in the “Gallery” section as well as those of recent grantees on our Instagram, and carefully review the “Eligibility” section of our website.\n\nThe following are not eligible for a grant: installation art; public art; murals; textile art; illustration; graphic design; photography; animation; video art; film; digital art; crafts; decorative arts; any work that uses a photograph or digital image as the principal medium or that is produced using computer software or graphics; and any work or activity or that falls primarily into any of the foregoing categories.\n\n+\n\nIs there an age limit for applicants? I’m not sure if I am considered to be in the early stage of my career.\n\nApplicants must be at least 18 years of age to be eligible to apply and they may not be older than 41 years of age at the time of submitting their application for a first grant. Candidates who have previously received a grant may apply for a further grant after the age of 41, provided that they continue to meet all other eligibility requirements, particularly as regards the mandate of the Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation’s grants are primarily intended as training and development grants for students who are pursuing their art training or education and emerging young professional artists who are in the process of launching their career. Grants are not intended as work or project grants for more experienced or mature artists.\n\n+\n\nDoes the Foundation give grants to students and artists outside of Canada?\n\nYes, grants are available to students and artists around the world. The Foundation has no geographic, citizenship or residency restrictions.\n\nAMOUNT OF THE GRANT AND USE OF FUNDS Open all\n\n+\n\nHow much is the grant?\n\nThe amount of the grant is a fixed amount; it is not dependent on needs or means. A first grant is $17,000 Canadian dollars, and second and third grants are $20,000 Canadian dollars. When preparing your budget for your application, you must explain how you would use the full amount of the grant. The Foundation reserves the right to award grants in lesser amounts and to disburse funds in whole or in part, as it deems advisable. Payment of the grant is made in Canadian dollars to recipients in Canada. Recipients outside of Canada receive the US dollar equivalent of the amount of the grant.\n\n+\n\nWhat can I use the funds for?\n\nGrants are intended to assist eligible applicants in the study or practice of their art and the payment of associated costs, such as tuition, studio rental, model wages, art supplies, travel and living expenses.\n\nGrants are not intended for any of the following purposes or pursuits, and proposals based on any of these will result in the automatic rejection of the application:\n\nthe purchase, construction or improvement of any land or building;\n\nthe purchase of materials or equipment of a permanent nature or that have a life beyond the project described in the Artistic Proposal (other than paints, brushes and similar working tools and accessories required in connection with the specific project undertaken);\n\nstudies or training in architecture, design, art education, art therapy, museology, and art restoration or conservation;\n\nstudies or training in any of the artistic pursuits not otherwise funded by the Foundation;\n\nthe payment of fees to third parties for the promotion, marketing or sale of artworks;\n\nworks created or carried out by a group or collective;\n\nthe creation, production or installation of work that is commissioned or ordered by others; and\n\nthe payment or reimbursement of expenses that have already been incurred, loans or other debts.\n\n+\n\nCan I use the grant to pursue my studies?\n\nYes, however not all types of studies are covered. Eligible courses of study or training include undergraduate, graduate or post-graduate studies and diploma programs in fine arts or studio arts from accredited institutions, recognized residencies, apprenticeships/internships and studio training. The Foundation does not fund studies or training in architecture, design, art education, art therapy, museology, art restoration or conservation, nor in any of the artistic pursuits not otherwise funded by the Foundation.\n\n+\n\nCan the grant be used to study abroad?\n\nYes, provided the proposed course of study is otherwise eligible (see previous question).\n\n+\n\nCan I use the funds to buy materials and equipment that I need for my studio or work?\n\nPaints, brushes and similar working tools and accessories required in connection with the specific project described in the Artistic Proposal included in the application are eligible. However, grants are not to be used for the purchase of any materials or equipment of a permanent nature or that have a life beyond the project described in the Artistic Proposal, such as computers, cameras, tools, machinery, etc.\n\n+\n\nCan I use the grant to establish myself in a studio?\n\nThe grant can be used to pay studio rent, but not to buy, build or improve a studio.\n\n+\n\nI need funds to prepare for an exhibition. Is this something that you fund?\n\nThe grant can be used to support you while you are working to prepare for an exhibition, but not to pay fees to third parties for the promotion, marketing or sale of artworks.\n\n+\n\nI have been commissioned to produce a work, but I need funding to support myself while I am working on this project. Can you help?\n\nNo. The creation, production or installation of work that is commissioned or ordered by others is not funded.\n\nAPPLYING FOR A GRANT Open all\n\n+\n\nHow do I apply for the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation grant?\n\nYou must complete the online application form and upload all the required materials and documentation. Please carefully review the “How to Apply” section of the website, as well as the instructions provided within the application site.\n\n+\n\nHow many grants does the Foundation give each year?\n\nThe Foundation does not give a set number of grants per year; it will give grants for as many worthy applications as it receives, within its financial capacity.\n\n+\n\nIs there a deadline for applying?\n\nYes, there are four deadlines per year. Applicants must apply in advance of the start date of their project. See “When should I apply” below for more information and the Apply section of the website for the deadlines for each application cycle.\n\n+\n\nWhen should I apply?\n\nPlease refer to the table in the Apply section for the open and close dates for each application cycle. We have specified the earliest date on which your grant period/project can start for each cycle; your grant period/project cannot start more than five months after this date (or, 10.5 months from the application cycle open date). Grant periods may not exceed two years. Only expenses incurred during the grant period are eligible for funding.\n\nIf you are applying to fund your education, please see the table in the Apply section for term-specific deadlines.\n\n+\n\nWhen will I receive a response on my application?\n\nYou will receive a response on your application before the date specified as the earliest grant period start date for the cycle in which you have applied.\n\n+\n\nHow will I be notified of the Foundation’s decision?\n\nYou will be notified or our decision by email. Applicants are required to keep their email address up to date to remain eligible and have their application considered.\n\n+\n\nWill you reject my application if it is not properly completed?\n\nThe Foundation reserves the right to reject applications that do not comply with the Application Task instructions.\n\nREJECTED APPLICATIONS AND RE-APPLYING FOR A GRANT Open all\n\n+\n\nI don’t understand why my application was rejected and would like to do better next time. Can you explain the reasons to me so that I can improve?\n\nThe Foundation does not provide advice or explanations to applicants, and its does not disclose information regarding the decision made by it with respect to a candidate’s application.\n\n+\n\nI would like you to reconsider my application in light of certain circumstances.\n\nWe do not reconsider applications. The decisions of the Foundation are final and are not subject to review or appeal.\n\n+\n\nWhen can I reapply?\n\nThis depends on whether or not you have been awarded a grant in the past.\n\nIf you have previously applied for but never received a grant from the Foundation and continue to meet the eligibility requirements, you are eligible to reapply within the same cycle two years later.\n\nIf you have previously received a grant from the Foundation, have complied with the terms and conditions of your grant(s), and continue to meet the eligibility requirements, you are eligible to reapply within the same cycle one year later, whether or not your most recent application was successful.\n\nIf you applied prior to the implementation of application cycles and the date on which you are eligible to reapply falls within an application cycle, you will be eligible to reapply as of the open date of that cycle.\n\nPlease contact the Foundation if you are unsure about the date on which you are eligible to reapply.\n\n+\n\nCan I reapply as many times as I want?\n\nThere is no formal prohibition in this regard. However, as a practical matter, if you have not been successful after several applications, it is very unlikely that you will be in the future. Moreover, with time, you will most likely cease to meet our eligibility requirements.\n\nGRANTEES Open all\n\n+\n\nI have been awarded a grant. What’s next?\n\nIf your application is successful, you will need to return to our online application site to accept the grant, and its terms and conditions. You will also be asked to provide the necessary banking and personal information to allow for payment. Payment of the grant is done by wire transfer.\n\n+\n\nWhat are the terms and conditions for accepting a grant?\n\nIf you accept the grant, you will be required to comply with the following terms and conditions:\n\nTo acknowledge the support of The Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation in your CV and biography, and in any promotional material relating to the work that you may produce during the period covered by the grant awarded to you, in the manner specified by the Foundation;\n\nTo use the grant in the manner and for the purpose described in the Artistic Proposal and Budget included with your application;\n\nTo provide a detailed report on your artistic activity and development forthwith upon completion of the proposed work, project or course of study or training described in your Artistic Proposal. Failure to do so automatically disqualifies you from applying for a further grant in the future;\n\nTo allow the Foundation to include your name and certain information on you in its communications and promotional materials.\n\n+\n\nWhen do I need to submit my report to the Foundation and what should it include?\n\nYour activity report must be submitted forthwith upon completion of the proposed activity/undertaking described in the Artistic Proposal that forms part of your application. The failure to provide the required report automatically disqualifies you from applying for a further grant at a future date.\n\nYour report should, in particular, describe the activity undertaken and discuss its impact on your artistic development and your future. It should also include a portfolio of the works created during the project. Reports can vary in length, from one page to several, depending on the magnitude of the project. The report must be submitted in PDF format.\n\n+\n\nHow likely is it that I will receive a second or third grant if I reapply?\n\nEach application for a grant is judged on its own merits. Receiving a grant does not ensure that an application for a second or third grant will be successful. In fact, only a limited number of grantees receive further grants, as the bar is set very high for second and third grant applications. The applicant must demonstrate significant development/progression in his or her work. Although it is possible to apply for another grant as early as one year following the previous grant, we recommend that applicants wait at least two years or more before applying for a second or third grant. Applicants must continue to meet the eligibility criteria, particularly regarding the Foundation's mandate.\n\n+\n\nHow many grants can an artist receive from the Foundation?\n\nNo more than three grants may be awarded to a candidate in his or her lifetime."
