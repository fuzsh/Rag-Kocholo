        "text": "Every 18.6 years, our Moon reaches the extremes of its orbit around the Earth. We observe this as the Moon rises and sets at its most northerly and southerly positions on the horizon.\n\nAnyone can be an observer, and we are here to help. You may look through our free public telescopes or use our astronomical information to observe from your own backyard. Check out the weekly Sky Report to see what you can observe in Los Angeles.\n\nLocated on the south slope of Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park, the Observatory is literally in the center of metropolitan Los Angeles. While public transportation is the easiest way to visit, you may also walk, bike, drive, or take a shared-ride service up to the Observatory. There’s paid parking near the Observatory and free parking downhill. Be sure to plan your visit in advance, because roads and parking get busy."
