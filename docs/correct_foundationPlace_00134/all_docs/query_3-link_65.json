You'll redo the spatial join with a search radius so it includes points that are not only touching, but also nearby.\n\nBefore, you joined all fields from the Populated Places layer. However, this layer has many fields, and the only one you need to include in the join is name. You'll use the Field Map to determine which fields come from the Populated Places layer and remove all but the name field.\n\nUnder Source, the Urban Areas field is listed as the source of the Shape_Area field.\n\nAll of the fields above Shape_Area also come from the Urban Areas layer. You'll keep all of these fields.\n\nUnder Source, the Populated Places layer is listed as this field's source. All of the fields below it also come from the Populated Places layer.\n\nYou'll remove all of them except for name."
