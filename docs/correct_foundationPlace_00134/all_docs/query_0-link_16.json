But , there , The silver answer rang, — \"Not Death, but Love.\" Elizabeth Barrett Browning THE BEGINNING I have chosen to introduce this book by relating several ex- periences that have touched my life and reflect an appreciation of the essential messages you will read about in Wishes Fulfilled. These meaningful life events occurred during the creation of this book, and contain elements of synergy and synchronicity that I find very exciting and promising. I'm offering what I consider to be a program that guarantees you the ability to manifest into your life all that you desire, as long as what you desire remains aligned with your Source of being. In my everyday life, while I was writing the manuscript for this book, I was blessed to experience firsthand how this process works. I've chosen to share these miraculous oc- currences in a very personal way. As I begin my eighth decade here on planet Earth, I find myself looking back at the more notable influences in my life that seemed to just show up. From this distance, I can see the impact they had in reversing the ego-dominated direction my life was taking at those earlier times. When these exceptional signal events or peo- ple materialized in my past, I was unable, as most of us are unable at the time, to access the larger perspective of what was happen- ing. Now, from this perspective of looking back and writing about how to live a wishes fulfilled life from a spiritual vantage point, I see those events as the pieces of a puzzle in a grand tapestry that is awe inspiring and very meaningful to me today. 1 WISHES FULFILLED Saint Francis One person who showed up in my life was a man who lived back in the 13th century and is now known as Saint Francis of Assisi. I wasn't raised in any particular religious faith, probably be- cause of being moved around to different foster homes during my childhood. I had no knowledge of Catholicism and was never ex- posed to any of the saints or their teachings. But for some mysteri- ous (but much less mysterious today) reason, this monk who lived such an inspiring, Christ-conscious life was to be one of the truly most portentous and impactful beings to ever cross my life path. Saint Francis's influence first appeared in my life in a large, beautifully framed print of the entire \"Prayer of Saint Francis,\" which was given to me by someone at a lecture more than 25 years ago. The messages of the prayer resonated with me profoundly and I loved how it appeared, so I hung it in a hallway that led to my children's bedrooms. I must have walked by that prayer at least 10,000 times in the decade that it hung there. Often I'd pause, read a few lines, and contemplate the magic in the words: Where there is hatred, let me sow love and, Where there is darkness, let me bring light. These words seemed more like a technology than a prayer. I loved thinking that hatred could grow into love, and darkness could be illuminated — not by asking God to do it, but by being love and light. It seemed to promise that we humans had the ability to literally change suffering and pain by transforming ourselves, and I enjoyed contemplating that achievement. But, from this vantage point, I can see that I wasn't yet ready to live Saint Francis's mes- sage, or even write it in the way that I've succeeded with this book. Nevertheless, Francesco di Pietro di Bernardone (1181-1226) had come into my life, and his influence slowly began to engulf me as the years passed. I was persuaded to go to Assisi in the 1990s, and while there I felt in some unexplainable way I was home. I walked in the fields where Francesco walked; I meditated in the same little chapel where he prayed. I stood at his tomb 2 The Beginning mesmerized by the overwhelming feeling in my body that I was one with this man who had lived 800-plus years before my own birth. I began to read about Francesco and was extremely moved by his burning desire to fulfill his own dharma alongside his determi- nation not to let anything impede his dream. I too have felt that inner call to do the work I've done all these years. I too have had periods of being off the path, and always that inner voice bringing me back to writing and living each day — to my Divine mission. About a decade ago I knew I was going to write a book titled There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem, but I was unclear about how to organize this undertaking. In a deep meditation I heard a strong voice say, Base it on the \"Prayer of Saint Francis\" that hangs on the wall in your home. It was a moment of such clarity and pure vision that I felt as if the book was already written. All I had to do was let myself “be an instrument of thy peace.\" I returned again to Assisi and had another miraculous experi- ence. I experienced a healing in my body that to this day remains a mystery to me and my medical doctor friends as well. (I related the story of this healing and my vision of Saint Francis in my movie, The Shift.) Once again this 13th-century monk had trans- formed my life by appearing to me and showing me that there are no limits to what can take place when one is living from a God- realized perspective. I went on to write the book effortlessly, after taking copious notes on my second visit to Assisi. Furthermore, the subject matter of There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem became a public tele- vision special, and millions of people had the teachings of Saint Francis brought into their homes because of my calling to write about these profoundly life-transforming truths. Years ago I found myself drawn to the fictional re-creation of the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, written by one of the greatest writers of our time, Nikos Kazantzakis. And to this day I still read from this amazing novel ( Saint Francis) regularly and always find myself moved to tears and higher consciousness by its contents. 3 WISHES FULFILLED About a year ago I had another strong calling during a deep meditation to take a group of people to three spiritual cities in Europe: Lourdes in France; Medjugorje in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and, of course, Assisi in Italy. We called this journey \"Experiencing the Miraculous,\" and 162 people from all over the globe signed on to visit these holy places where genuine miracles have taken place in the 13th, 19th, and 20th centuries. I offered a two-hour lec- ture in each of these remarkable places, and in our opening night gathering in Assisi, I told everyone that we were truly fulfilling the vision of Saint Francis. His objective was to bring Christ-conscious awareness to the entire world, one parish, one city, one country at a time. On this trip we had people from every continent, repre- senting all age-groups from teenagers to octogenarians. All profes- sions, all religious persuasions, all with the same ideas — to assist our world in being one that is populated by people who desire to \"make me an instrument of thy peace,\" and thus create such a world from our deepest wishes desiring to be fulfilled. On our second day in Assisi, on my third visit to this Divine city, all 162 people gathered in an ancient church built hundreds of years ago when Francesco lived there and began the Franciscan order. As my two-hour talk was winding down in this holy build- ing, something happened to me that I have never experienced in almost four decades of public lectures. I felt something take over my body, and I was rendered speechless. I was doing a reading from Kazantzakis's Saint Francis, and at the end I simply froze. My body wouldn't move. I broke into almost furious sobbing, and the entire audience stood up and stretched out their hands to me in silence. Everyone knew that a truly metaphysical happening was transpiring. (The entire trip was filmed, including this and two other lectures. You can see it all for yourself if you so desire by viewing the Experiencing the Miraculous 4-DVD set that is produced by Hay House.) Many photographs were taken of me speaking beneath a por- trait of Jesus Christ in the church, and I have included one in the photo insert so that you might view the very large orb that made 4 The Beginning its appearance at that transfixing lecture in the holy church in Assisi. You will learn more about these orbs later in this book. What I can say with certainty is that I once again felt in my body the power of Saint Francis. I experienced him, not only by his words and not only around me, but in me — as me — while speaking to those 162 people whom I feel were a catalytic group gathered for the purpose of fulfilling a collective dharma, origi- nating in a thought in my imagination and now an active force for good in our world. Looking back at my life, at the events that brought Saint Francis into my life, it seems clear that I didn't rec- ognize the significance of them at the time. I simply did what I felt called to do. And I must say that Francesco didn't just come into my life with an occasional message to prompt my own spiritual awakening, he actually took it over and changed the course that my life was taking at the time — he lived in me most of the time. I am going to leave Saint Francis for a moment and relate the presence of another luminous being who arrived in my life about six years ago. Lao-tzu Back in 2005 I became reacquainted with the ancient spiritual text the Tao Te Ching, narrated some 2,500 years ago by the an- cient Chinese master Lao-tzu. Some have called this small book containing 81 short verses the wisest book ever written. While I had a cursory awareness of the Tao, it was by no means a signifi- cant teaching in my life. Yet I noticed that at the age of 65 I kept reading and receiving messages from the Tao Te Ching, which translates loosely to the book of living the virtue of the great way. I was familiar with some of the most quoted passages from the text and had even used them in my previously published books, but now in 2005 for some reason I seemed to be bombarded by them almost on a daily basis. In a restaurant several lines from the Tao appeared on the menu; I heard more quotations on a couple of TV shows; in a bookstore a translation was misplaced on a shelf 5 WISHES FULFILLED right next to one of my books; a close friend told me a story of how he claimed to be a Taoist and the peace that it brought him; and someone I didn't know sent me a card deck containing each of the 81 brief verses, along with a drawing of Lao-tzu sitting on an ox, and the likeness seemed to speak to me like no drawing had before. Then one morning in my meditation I felt a strong inner call- ing to read the entire Tao Te Ching, and I did so that very day. That evening I called my publisher and said I'd like to write a brief essay on each of the 81 verses on how to apply the ancient wisdom of Lao-tzu to today's modern world, and publish it as one volume titled Change Your Thoughts — Change Your Life. From that moment on, I began to feel the same relationship with Lao-tzu as I had been having with Saint Francis for the previous decade or so. I began to hear this man speaking to me in my early-morning meditations. I mentioned this on my weekly radio show on HayHouse Radio.com, and an artist named Magali told me on the air that she'd channeled a likeness of Lao-tzu that she'd produced in a frenzy of automatic painting, and was sending to me. The paint- ing arrived via overnight delivery, and I literally talked to this likeness for the entire year of 2006. Each week I spent four and a half days studying, meditating, intellectualizing, and analyzing a verse of the Tao Te Ching. On the half day, after meditating with the painting of Lao-tzu, I sim- ply let the words flow onto the page. I spent the entire year of 2006 communing with Lao-tzu, gazing at his portrait and watch- ing how his eyes seemed to follow me as I moved about my writing space, and most significantly, listening and letting the words flow through my heart and onto the page. My year of being steeped in the Tao Te Ching was truly life al- tering. I learned and practiced the essential messages of humility, living the mystery, contentment, simplicity, serenity, and finding God in nature rather than in an orthodoxy. Lao-tzu became my constant companion, and the Tao Te Ching not only guided me to a more enlightened way of life, it did so for millions of others as 6 The Beginning well. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) allowed me to present the essence of Lao-tzu's ancient messages on a pledge show that aired thousands of times, often in prime time, in every major mar- ket in the United States and Canada. Somehow in some mysteri- ous way known only by the invisible Tao or the one Divine mind, I became an instrument for getting these powerful messages out to large numbers of people, 25 centuries after the passing of Lao-tzu. Saint Francis and Lao-tzu and their teachings are still hugely consequential in my life every day. But more than being these momentous spiritual teachers, their appearances in my life have impacted countless others, including you as you embark on the reading of this book. Brenda's Letter I am now going to share a remarkable letter that I received a few days ago as I was preparing to write the opening pages of Wishes Fulfilled. Please read it with an open mind, and then allow me to explain the relevance it has for you as you begin reading this book. Dear Dr. Wayne, Miracles happen. I feel compelled to share with you an experience I had very recently, because you were a part of the miracle that I experienced. Several months ago I heard about your \"Experiencing the Miraculous\" tour, and I knew that I had to be a part of it. Life for me is complicated right now as I go through a great big shift, so for me to work out the logistics of going on the European tour was likely to take a miracle, but I was open to anything. I stated my intention out loud. I said, \"I intend to experience the miraculous with Dr. Wayne,\" and then I left it to God to come up with the hows. A few months passed and my situation was slow to change, so my trip was not booked. I continued to have faith and to know that I would experience the miraculous with you even if 7 WISHES FULFILLED reality kept saying \"not likely.\" In the beginning of April my busy schedule had me traveling with my 14-year-old daughter, Emily, to Kelowna, B.C., for her singing festival. It is an eight- hour drive from where I live, but she is very passionate about opera, so giving her the opportunity to go to Kelowna to work with some experts was certainly my pleasure. My parents hap- pen to live there, too, so I called them to say we were coming. I talked to Mom for a few minutes, told her when we would be arriving, and chatted about this and that when I heard Dad mumbling something in the background. Mom interpreted for me: \"Your Dad says Dr. Wayne Dyer will be in Vernon Tuesday night if you want to go see him.\" Well, after I picked the phone (and myself) off of the floor, I asked Dad if he would be my date, and I went online and bought tickets. Needless to say, I was thrilled that God would be so kind as to bring you to me instead of getting me to Europe. The night of your lecture came, and I eagerly sat in the 14th row. When you walked onstage and started to talk, something weird happened. It had happened once before when I saw a young boy sing \"Ave Maria, \" and a huge halo of light appeared around him. At first I had thought I was getting a migraine, but the light was only around the young boy. That same light was surrounding you. No matter where you moved on the stage, the light followed you, and only you. I thought it might be the stage lights or the ambient atmosphere in the arena, but there was no halo around the lady who introduced you. Then something even stranger happened. Dr. Wayne, you were talking about Saint Francis and before my very eyes, you transformed. Your body was clad in a long robe and your fea- tures transformed so that you were Saint Francis of Assisi. It lasted for only a moment, but it was powerful, emotional, and very, very real. But then something even stranger happened. You began to talk about Lao-tzu, and you transformed into him! A long braid tailed down your back, and I could see your face completely 8 The Beginning transform into Lao-tzu. Again, it only lasted for a moment, but the experience will last with me forever. At intermission, Dad went to the restroom and I stood up to stretch my legs (and dry my eyes). I felt a warm hand fill mine and I looked down to see a little lady, very old and with a wonderful smile, and she was urging me to sit beside her. I sat, and she stared straight into my eyes. She told me that she kept staring at me because I was glowing with light and she felt like she was watching an angel. I was transfixed by her eyes, think- ing that I knew her somehow because I recognized her twinkly green eyes. She and I talked, at times saying the same thing at the same time. Things like “We are all the same\" and \"There is only love\" and other deeply spiritual things. It felt like a dream, and before we knew it you were onstage again, creating your magic. I decided I needed to perpetuate contact with her and would get her name and number after the show. Despite my good intentions, when the show ended and we got up to leave, she had disappeared. This surprised me because she had been sitting two seats away from me and I never saw her leave. Dad and I left, and as I was backing the car up in the park- ing lot I caught sight of my own eyes in the rearview mirror. And that's when I realized where I had seen those twinkly green eyes before. Impossible? Maybe . . . not. I have no explanation for any of the things I experienced that night, but every day I give thanks that I was able to \"experience the miraculous\" with Dr. Wayne in such a unique and lovely way. Namaste, Brenda Babinski If you are wondering about her “twinkly green eyes\" reference, it makes perfect sense to me because I readily recall Marcelene, the mother of seven of my children, telling me of her experience giving birth to her firstborn son, Shane. In the hospital she was struggling in labor and didn't wish to use anesthesia. A nurse with distinct red hair came to her side, wiped her brow, spoke 9 WISHES FULFILLED soothingly and lovingly to her of how to breathe, and stayed with her throughout the entire birth process. When she inquired the next day about this wonderfully helpful nurse and how she could properly thank her, she was told that no one of that description had ever worked in that hospital. Angelic guidance — perhaps. And Brenda's encounter with her very old little lady may also have been an encounter with her highest self (see Chapter Three). I include Brenda's letter here in the beginning to give you a sense of what is possible when you begin to assume the feeling of a wish fulfilled, as I detail in Chapter Six. My first thought upon reading Brenda's words came directly from my ego, which declared, You were probably Lao-tzu and then Saint Francis in two of your previous lives, and why not. Look how important you are and all that you are doing to make this a more spiritually awakened place. Then I talked by telephone with author Anita Moorjani in Hong Kong and read her the letter, and she quickly put my ego-driven thoughts to rest. She said that her experience of being on the “other side\" was perfectly clear on one thing: Everything is hap- pening at once. There is no past or future, only one and only now. And that the closest she could come to this idea was that these are all parallel lives. Now I know how perplexing it is to contemplate this idea of no past, no future, and no linear consciousness, especially since the brain (which is the only thing we have to do this contemplating with) is in a body that is linear and did have a beginning and will have an end. It is simply one of the great mysteries, this idea of ev- erything happening at once, yet in my dream state and occasion- ally in deep meditation I have had a glimpse of this nonlinearity. I urge you to read Anita's book, Dying to Be Me, to gain perhaps a bit more understanding of how the now/oneness appeared to her as she embarked upon her healing journey away from a certain death prognosis. 10 The Beginning As you read Wishes Fulfilled I encourage you to take notice of the importance of being able to feel in your body what you desire to manifest. Pay particular attention to what it means to know within that you are truly a Divine being here in the material world of ours on Earth. I repeatedly emphasize, in the pages that follow, the importance of your imagination in creating a wishes fulfilled life. But your imagination is strictly a domain that's controlled by your thinking processes. Once you place a thought into your imagination about who you want to become, I encourage you to live from that end, as if it had already materialized into the physical realm. And this is precisely what I have been doing with the teach- ings of both Saint Francis and Lao-tzu for many years: living their messages intellectually; writing about them, lecturing on them, analyzing them, interpreting them — all in my imagination. But now at this time in my life, I have gone beyond my intellect when it comes to the teachings of these Divine masters. When I ap- peared onstage that evening in Vernon, B.C., and when I spoke to that audience in Assisi and felt myself overwhelmed by the pres- ence of Saint Francis, I was feeling them in my body, living their messages as if they were me — or, in other words, assuming the feel- ing of the wish to know their truths as already fulfilled. And when you are able to passionately feel whatever it is that you wish to have or become, as long as it is aligned with your highest self — that is, God — you become it and it becomes you. When I teach these profound messages, they are way beyond an intellectual exercise. I feel them, and this is what Brenda Babinski observed in those fleeting moments while I was onstage. Imagine it; live as if it were your reality; allow no detractors; but, most important, assume the feeling of it, and you will merge with it and it will merge with you so that it is no longer a duality — it is you becoming one with what you desire. That same evening Brenda came to see me, as I sat onstage and signed books, the entire hockey arena was filled with orbs as if to confirm the convergence of the truths of both Saint Francis and Lao-tzu as I assumed the feeling of these spiritual truths in 11 WISHES FULFILLED the core of my being. (See photo insert.) Those orbs also appeared in photographs at the church in Assisi where I felt in my body the presence of Saint Francis as I stood and spoke where he had lived and spoken. (Again, see photo insert.) I do not believe that my being seen by an audience member as actually transforming into these great teachers is an indication that I might have lived as them many centuries ago. I know that when you begin to go beyond the intellect and feel the presence of what you most desire as an already present fact, and live from it with unabated passion, you merge into it, and come to know the truth that the laws of the material world do not apply in the presence of the God-realized. Nicollette I have chosen to relate one additional story here in the begin- ning of Wishes Fulfilled that brings home the most salient feature of this book. That is, that there exists within all of us a Divine spark, called the I am that I am, and when it is kindled and nour- ished, it is capable of miracle-making at an astonishing level. In May of 2011 I met a group of women, including a mother and her 20-year-old daughter, while on a walk along the ocean- front on Maui. Linda, the mom, recognized me, and we began a brief conversation. As I looked at her daughter, Nicollette, it was obvious that she was suffering from some kind of facial paralysis that had distorted her features — the muscle activity in the entire left side of her face appeared to be frozen. Something motivated me to reach out and touch her face and ask her what was happen- ing. And then began a saga that I have chosen, with permission from both of them, to relate here in this book to give you a sam- pling of what is possible when we use the inherent power that is a part of our very essence — called the I am presence — for the fulfill- ment of our Divinely aligned wishes. I felt called to invite the entire group of women into my home and to talk to Nicollette about the wishes fulfilled teachings that I was channeling and writing about each and every day, and had 12 The Beginning been for several months. I spent an hour or so with Nicollette while her mother, grandmother, and two of Linda's friends stayed in the background. During this time I felt in my body that some- thing stupefying and mystical was energizing not only me but the entire room. At the end of our time together, I insisted that Nicollette spend an hour with my friend Kate MacKinnon, a craniosacral therapist who was visiting and offering me CST treatments. I had set up an appointment for myself with Kate for the following day. I gave my appointment to Nicollette, and what follows are two descriptions of the event that transpired. The first is Linda's letter to Kate about her understanding of the entire experience. Hi Kate, I wanted to tell yon that before Hawaii, Nicoilette did not know of Wayne Dyer at all. She is a university student consumed with classes, assignments, work, and parties and has never been to his lectures or read his books. She still knows very little of him other than she is now reading The Power of Intention . On Saturday I arrived in Hawaii with my husband, Gord, and son, Jason. Nicollette called me from Victoria, B.C., the next day. She said she had experienced a weird headache the night before, and now her face was going numb on the left side. She was having difficulty smiling on one side and was worried. She sent a picture of herself from her phone and we told her to go to the emergency room now and get it looked at, for it may be a stroke or something! Nicollette didn't want to go because she said she had too much schoolwork to do, had final exams to study for, and didn't feel well enough to go. I insisted we needed a professional assessment. She went and was triaged immedi- ately through and given a battery of tests. She called me about an hour later and said she was diag- nosed with a very severe case of Bell's palsy — cause unknown. They had theories of causes, but didn't see the other physical effects of these causes and so the doctors were stumped by her condition. She was given prophylactic antiviral medication and 13 WISHES FULFILLED high doses of prednisone. It not being a life-threatening condi- tion, they said, \"Sorry, this is all we can do — time will tell,\" and she was sent home. Nicollette was beside herself with grief. She called us and was so-o-o upset. We suggested that if the doctors said it was okay, then she would come to Hawaii or I'd fly home to be with her. She spent the next two days seeing different physicians making sure she could travel. She arrived in Hawaii on Tuesday. We coidd see that her paralysis was worse when she arrived — it was definitely progressing. It worsened for several days thereafter. I was in contact with our doctor at home and sent him another picture of Nicollette in full paralysis. He told me that based on what he saw in the photo, it was a severe case. He told us to be prepared that there's a strong possibility that she may only partially recover from this or .. . perhaps not at all! Furthennore, this type of palsy (Ramsay Hunt) can be qidte painful and may have nasty side effects from the nerve damage that has been done. At the doctor's request, we went to the local drugstore and purchased full-coverage eye patches and eye lubrications so her left eye would not ulcerate, as it was no longer closing. A week or so passed, paralysis continued, no movement, nor any taste sensation on her left side of her tongue. Her left eyebrow nerves were blown out, eye couldn't close, nostril and mouth affected as well. She was having diffcidty chewing. Nicollette was in a state of stress, distress, and shooting pain. The universe intervenes — we meet Dr. Wayne Dyer on the promenade. We spent about an hour with Wayne in his condo. Wayne was totally focused on Nicollette's state of mind and on heal- ing. She was wanting to heal right now, being told she has the power to heal, but didn't know how to get to the place to tap into that healing. Wayne put his hands on her face and spoke to her over and over again, the same words until she got it — I am paralysis-free! My girlfriends in the background were crying, my mother awestruck . . . as we were leaving his condo, Wayne 14 The Beginning insisted that Nicollette must, simply must, have a session with his CST therapist the next day. Since time was an issue, he gave his appointment to Nicollette. He made the arrangements. Nicollette came into the therapy session with much grati- tude and the new thinking that she will be healed. But she said that one of her barriers to healing was that she couldn't get to a place of completely \" letting go and letting God\" because she was in fight-or-flight mode. \"How can I get to a state of physi- cal relaxation and heal when I don't know how to relax my body?\" I recall she expressed these concerns to you and you un- derstood what she was saying. You asked her (as Wayne had asked her, too) what was going on in her life before this had happened. She said, \"Nothing. Everything's fine. I was studying for my final exams in economics and computer science, and at the same time I needed to create a painting for my art class and write an essay on it. My roommate is moving out and also I'm anxiously waiting to find out if I'm going to be accepted to McGill University in Montreal. Lots on my plate, but I am handling it.\" You said to her, \"Nicollette, that isn't nothing. That is a lot of something. We see here how the mind and mind-filled stress can affect the body. This is the mind/body connection, or rather disconnection.\" Once we got back to Vancouver, Nicollette and I met with our family doctor. He told my daughter that this was indeed a \"very moderate\" case. To translate, by his expression and from what he had told me over the phone in Hawaii, it was actually severe. Nicollette knew what he meant. She knew it was severe, but it didn't bother her because as far as she was concerned, she was healing. Our family doctor then went on to provide statistics of different levels of recovery and to pre- pare us that this type of paralysis can take two years or more to come back from, if you do come back. We were to schedule another appointment in four weeks where Nicollette would be referred to a neurologist. 15 WISHES FULFILLED I can't say for sure when she actually had visible improve- ment, for she went back almost immediately to the University of Victoria to make up all the work that she had missed while in Hawaii. She went back with the confidence of simply moving forward. I was surprised that she was leaving us and getting right back into her university life after what our family doctor had said, and given that she was still paralyzed. No matter what I thought or what I said, in true Nicollette conviction, she continued to tell me, \"Mom, you don’t get it! Didn't you hear what Wayne said? I am healed and paralysis- free. Didn't you hear me say that, too? What part of that don't you understand? I am healed — it's just that you and everybody else in this world can't see it yet!\" Four weeks later she is paralysis- free. Namaste, Linda The words I am healed and I am paralysis-free that Nicollette spoke, even though the physical evidence strongly indicated oth- erwise, may sound strange or even absurd to you as you read this. But I assure you they will make sense as you read Wishes Fulfilled. The second description is Nicollette's recollection in a letter to the craniosacral therapist, Kate MacKinnon. Hi Kate, Thank you so much for letting my mom know about Dr. Dyer's radio show today. My family and I listened to it this eve- ning, and I am so grateful that you made it possible for all of us to hear those wonderful things. This is truly, and has been, an amazing experience. I can't thank you enough for all that you have done. Initially, at the time of my diagnosis with Bell's palsy on the first day of spring, I just could not move the left side of my bottom lip as much as I could the right side. Four days later I couldn't move the entire left side of my face at all; I coiddn't even close my left eye and had to tape it shut every night. I coidd see my paralysis getting worse every day no matter how 16 The Beginning much I thought it would get better. I came to the conclusion that I had no control over the left side of my face. I was told that I might not ever recover from this, and if I do it could take years. I became miserable. I felt broken. I was suffering. I met Dr. Dyer the day before I was leaving Maid. I didn't know who he was, or what he is about. After Dr. Dyer learned of my condition, he put his hand over my face and introduced the idea that I have the power to heal myself. All I have to do is think about how I feel when I am paralysis- free. I thought about a friend taking a picture of me a year ago and me hav- ing no paralysis — I was smiling. It was then explained that the physical is a representation of what starts out in the mind, in my imagination, of what I want to be physically. Manifestation and healing begin here. I began to think that if I changed my thought process and thought only of connecting myself with the knowing that I am paralysis-free, eventually, the physical will reflect my new mind-set. Dr. Dyer then said that he highly recommended I have a session with you, and he gave me your number. I called you, and with the generosity and kindness of Dr. Dyer, I had a session with you the next day. Right after meeting Dr. Dyer, I had difficulty’ trying to con- nect to the thought of being paralysis-free because it was so prominent to me in everything I did. I coiddn't chew properly, taste very well, or pronounce some words without feeling un- comfortable. My eye was always dry during the day, and at night I had to tape it shut after putting this lube in it. I also had so much on my mind. I had two finals in one week's time worth more than 60 percent of my grade, and I had to maintain a certain GPA to stay in my program at the University of Victoria and to still have a good chance of getting into McGill University. In addition, I had to figure out living accommodations in three weeks. I had so much to think about, and I felt so uncomfortable in everything I did because of my paralysis. I was holding on to the stress of it all, still focusing on the Bell's palsy. I didn't want it to have a negative impact on my life — but it was. The next day I had a session with you. 17 WISHES FULFILLED You asked what was going on in my life before this hap- pened. I said, \"Nothing. Everything was fine.\" I felt I was doing well on my time management with my studies, keeping up with my assignments in economics, computer science, and art class. My roommate was moving out, and I was also. I was anxiously waiting to find out if I was going to be accepted to McGill Uni- versity. I knew it seemed like a lot, but I didn't feel the stress of it. I even remember thinking that I shoidd feel more stressed out than I did. You said to me, \"Nicollette, that isn't nothing. That is a lot of something. We see here how stress hurts the body. This is the mind/body connection or more like disconnection. \" I lay down and the healing began. You started by putting your hands on my ankles. You were asking my mom some ques- tions about where we are from, etc. It made me feel more com- fortable, as this was something I had never heard of or even imagined I would be doing. I didn't know how to think of the situation. So I started thinking about how I could make this session as beneficial as possible. I thought about what Dr. Dyer had said to me the day before and what I had read in Anita Moorjani's near-death-experience article. I constantly told my- self, \"I am paralysis-free,\" and thought about the picture of me a year ago, smiling. You asked me if I like the ocean, and I replied, \"Yes.\" You told me to listen to the sound of the waves crashing against the sand on the shore. I remember hearing the calming sound of the waves and looking up at the white ceiling. Looking at the ceiling, it was almost as if my body was now numb and I could no longer feel your hands, which were now touching my legs. When you got to my rib cage on my left side, you asked me if I had stomach pains. I explained that I have had extreme pain in the stomach region after every time I ate something, but I thought it was caused by the medication I had to take for my Bell's palsy. However, I finished my medication a week ago, and I am still having pain there. You focused around my stomach and rib cage. I was looking up at the ceiling. I began to 18 The Beginning feel pressure right underneath my rib cage, but was unsure if I should say something. Then you said, \"If you feel any pressure anywhere, let me know . \" Immediately I felt more pressure in that spot, so I said so. I was staring at the ceiling and it began to change colors. You asked me if the pain was a shape what shape would it be, and what color. I said it would be an oval and yellow. You asked if this oval had a name. Nothing came to me. Therefore, you said we can call it yellow oval, and asked me if this oval is working with me. I felt like it was working against me and said that. You said, \"That's no good.\" And I remember agreeing in my thoughts. You told me to talk to this yellow oval and ask if we can work together. So I did just that. Then, seconds later, I felt it gone. Almost as if the oval had burst into a million pieces float- ing all over my body and I became one with it. I felt a state of complete relaxation. After that experience I would say that you helped me realize this control I have over my body. You helped me jump-start the communication between my mind and my body. I was introduced to the notion of how my mind and my body are one. I remember hearing the waves and repeatedly telling my- self, \"I am paralysis-free. \" You got to my head. I felt your fin- gers right at the top of my spine, at the top of my neck. You kept your hands there for a while it seemed. Then, I felt my lower back touch the surface of what I was lying on. I felt as if what was making me feel so uncomfortable all this time had left my body. I took a deep breath, and I vividly remember the air going in so easily. I felt connected to my body as I could feel the air going in and out so freely. You then focused on the leftside of my mouth and kept your fingers on the bottom of my upper left molars for a few minutes. Then you touched the left side of my face. I felt relaxed, and I had the picture of me smiling in my mind. I opened myself up to the notion that you are going to be the catalyst in my heal- ing process. You asked me for a word that will help me heal, 19 WISHES FULFILLED and what color it woidd need. I got the word \"feel\" and the color of light bine and I repeated them to yon. Yon asked me to feel yonr hand on my face, and imagine my face as a sponge absorbing yonr energy. I pictured this light bine sponge contracting. I did feel yonr hand on my face. I saw the sponge in my mind, and I told myself that \"I am paralysis-free.\" I was in a state of complete relaxation picturing this sponge as I felt yonr hand, and heard the waves of the ocean. I felt one with my body, that I had control of my body, and that I was smiling paralysis-free. Yon had yonr hand on my face for what seemed to be about five minutes. However, my concept of time during that session coidd be incorrect. Then yon lifted yonr hand off my face and I opened my eyes. Yon were looking down at me and asked me how I felt. I can't remember my response, although I felt re- laxed, and aware of what was going on in and around my body. I remember yon telling me that I grind my teeth on my left side of my month, and asked me if something happened to my forehead (which I banged on the roof of my car the day before coming to Hawaii, as I told yon later). I remember you telling me that whatever it is I would normally do to relax I need to do more of because that is when the healing takes place. The session overall is a blur other than those feelings I described above. At the end, I almost expected to be able to physically smile paralysis-free, but when I couldn't, I was a little disappointed. Then within a matter of minutes after that thought of disappointment had entered my mind, other thoughts poured in — healing thoughts. After putting on the shoes I took off before the session, I noticed a weird feeling in my body — a physical feeling — something had definitely changed. I felt a sense of peace. I knew my suffering was over. I physically was no longer uncomfortable. I felt excited and filled with energy. I knew I was healing — I knew it. Over the next few weeks, I continued to think about what you had said about how the healing takes place in relaxation. So, whenever I felt my senses speaking to me, convincing me 20 The Beginning that I still have a severe case of facial paralysis (like for ex- ample when I couldn't pronounce some words properly when speaking to my mom right after the session), I thought of the light blue sponge, and the feeling of your hand on my face. Every time I think of that sponge I am brought back to that place of total relaxation, with the suffering and uncomfortable feelings suddenly lifted from my body. I hear the sound of the waves overpower what my senses tell me, and all that is left in my mind is that picture of me smiling. When I left Maid I had an overwhelming feeling and image of healing. I am paralvsis- free. I am paralysis- free, I am paralysis-free! Nicollette I was scheduled to give an evening lecture in Canada at the Jubilee Auditorium in Calgary, Alberta, some ten weeks after my first and only encounter with Nicollette. Linda had called me to re- port that her daughter was completely paralysis-free, and that this experience had completely turned her entire life mission around. I called Nicollette, and she excitedly told me how great she felt to have learned at the age of 20 that she had this amazing I am presence within her and that she wanted to tell everyone she encountered about this profound discovery. I invited her and her mom to come to Calgary and share her experience with the sev- eral thousand people I would be speaking to. And indeed she did. In only a few moments Nicollette transfixed the audience, giv- ing real-world, 3-D evidence of all that I was lecturing about that evening. As she left the stage to a standing ovation, she handed me a card with two photos imprinted on it. (See photo insert.) In the photo of the three of us in Hawaii (Nicollette, Linda, and me), the left side of her face is paralyzed. In the other photo, Nicollette is smiling in a beautiful dress, paralysis-free — with a distinct orb at her left shoulder! The caption on the card says: A Wish Fulfilled, Love, Nicollette and Linda. As you continue reading this book, which has been such a miraculous journey for me, know that I take no credit for any of it. I'm reminded of the 1977 film Oh, God! with George Burns as 21 WISHES FULFILLED God saying something to the effect that if you want a miracle, you should try to make a fish from scratch. Only the I am presence is so equipped. I give full credit to that presence and urge you to know that it is yours to access as well. Do it — from scratch! Sending love, Wayne Dyer 22 PART I 5^3 The Higher Aspects of Yourself \" Part of me suspects I'm a loser, and part of me thinks I'm God Almighty.\" John Lennon Changing Your Concept of Yourself \" Health , wealth, beauty, and genius are not created; they are only manifested by the arrangement of your mind — that is, by your concept of yourself, and your concept of yourself is all that you accept and consent to as true .\" 1 — Neville There's a level of awareness available to you that you are prob- ably unfamiliar with. It extends upward and transcends the ordi- nary level of consciousness that you're most accustomed to. At this higher plane of existence, which you and every human being who has ever lived can access at will, the fulfillment of wishes is not only probable — it is guaranteed. This chapter is simply a prepara- tion for entering into that realm wherein you have much more say over what comes into your life than you might have envisioned. After 18 months in relative seclusion, studying, meditating, and literally experiencing what it's like to live in this miracu- lous plane of existence beyond anything that might be labeled 25 WISHES FULFILLED “ordinary\" or \"normal,\" I've undertaken this joyous task of writ- ing about having wishes fulfilled. I've seen firsthand how virtually every wish or desire I've placed my attention on has transformed from a mental thought into an objective fact. However, I'm not proposing memorizing an esoteric formula leading to a theoretical nirvana. My emphasis throughout this book is that manifestation is real and that it occurs when you make a specific decision to change your mind about who you are and what is possible for you to achieve within these parentheses in eternity called your life. I'm inviting you to be receptive to a radical new idea about yourself. It's radical because ever since you left your mother's womb, you've been subjected to cultural conditioning designed to help you be content with living a \"normal life\" at the level of or- dinary consciousness, which generally means accepting whatever life hands you. In many ways you've been programmed to believe that you do not possess the wisdom or ability to manifest the ful- fillment of your wishes and desires. I am saying as clearly as I know how to say it in these opening pages: There's a plane of awareness that you can opt to live at, wherein you can, if you are willing to change your concept of yourself as an or- dinary being, find yourself fidfilling any and all wishes that you have for yourself. Throughout this book I'll explore with you what I've studied, learned, internalized, practiced, and, yes, lived regarding the powers of manifestation. It begins with changing your con- cept of yourself. I would like to offer a few words on these two concepts of or- dinary and extraordinary. Ordinary is, well, so ordinary. It means that you do all of the things that your culture and your family have programmed you to do. It implies that you fit in, study hard, follow the rules, take care of your obligations, fill out the forms, pay your taxes, get a job, and do what every law-abiding citizen does; and then you retire, play with your grandchildren, and ultimately die. I want to emphasize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this 26 Changing Your Concept of Yourself scenario — it is perfectly fine — but if it were completely acceptable for you, you wouldn't be reading this book. Extraordinary encompasses most of ordinary, since we all live in the same physical world. There will be forms to fill out, rules that demand our obedience, bills to pay, and family obligations to attend to. But extraordinary consciousness is associated with your soul, that invisible, boundaryless energy that looks out from behind your eyeballs and has very different interests than your ordinary self does. The ideal of your soul, the thing that it yearns for, is not more knowledge. It is not interested in comparison, nor winning, nor light, nor ownership, nor even happiness. The ideal of your soul is space, expansion, and immensity, and the one thing it needs more than anything else is to be free to expand, to reach out and to embrace the infinite. Why? Because your soul is infinity itself. It has no restrictions or limitations — it resists being fenced in — and when you attempt to contain it with rules and obligations, it is miserable. Your invisible self is extraordinary because it is a fragment of the universal soul, which is infinite. The part of you that knows you have greatness, and is stirred by the idea of you expanding and removing any and all limitations, is what I am addressing here in Wishes Ful- filled. This is your new self-concept, one that is inspired by your soul. So let's take a look at this idea and then examine what you need to do in order to make your self-concept congruent with how you want to live your life, and the powerful role you can begin to assume as a co-fulfiller of all of your rational/sensible wishes and desires. What Is Your Self-Concept? Simply put, your concept of yourself is everything that you be- lieve to be true. And everything that you believe to be true about yourself has landed you precisely where you live and breathe every 27 WISHES FULFILLED day of your life. Your beliefs about yourself are like the ingredi- ents in a recipe that you use to create your self-concept. Those ingredients or beliefs fall into two specific categories: your outer self-concept and your inner self-concept. Your Outer Self-Concept These ingredients include everything you accept as truth con- cerning what the physical you is capable of. There's probably a cer- tain amount of intellectual acumen that you agree is necessary to your outer self-concept. Smart, perhaps, but not really a genius — more capable in some areas than others, such as technological knowledge. Maybe you add a measure of writing ability, but detect more fluency with numbers and mathematical problem solving than your ability to write prose. Your beliefs about your outer self may be well seasoned and strong in some areas and almost hope- lessly incapacitated or weak in others. You very likely have a con- ceptual framework of just how smart you are and have carried that belief with you since you were a youngster in elementary school. Your outer concept of yourself includes everything you believe about your innate and learned talents and abilities. Your beliefs about your clumsiness, coordination, athleticism, and musical and artistic talents are a partial list of the ingredients that com- prise the recipe of you. These descriptors also apply to everything else about your outer self. Your outer self-concept includes how you view yourself in relationship to health: your immunity to, or inclination toward, illnesses of all descriptions. You know if you are prone to being overweight or addicted to various substances such as sugar, caffeine, fat, meat, dairy, and the like. You define yourself as prone to catching colds or immune to such things, likely to gain weight, inclined toward skin rashes, or predisposed to low energy or high sleep requirements. The point is that your outer self-concept comprises essential- ly everything that you believe your body is capable or incapable of. Given a true/false test on yourself, you'd be able to say with 28 Changing Your Concept of Yourself certainty, Yes , these things are true about me. They are the beliefs — the ingredients — that you use to create you. In addition to your intellect, talents, and physical body traits, you spice up your outer self-conception with your personality traits. You know if you're assertive or shy, loud or quiet, pushy or obsequious, fearful or courageous, daring or frightened — and this is only a partial list of personality descriptors or spices. These in- dividual qualities are interpreted as truisms defining yourself and how you function socially. I could continue detailing all of the other ingredients that go into making your outer self-concept, but I've chosen to keep this book short, succinct, and to the point. At this point I'm simply encouraging you to recognize that your self-concept contains a myriad of self-descriptors regarding this thing that you call your physical body, and that you probably regard them as absolute truth. Your Inner Self-Concept This category can be pretty difficult to achieve in optimal pro- portions in our culture. Your inner self-concept involves your be- liefs about the invisible energy and intelligence that is the most significant portion of your being. I've often referred to your inner world as \"the ghost in the machine.\" The machine in my concep- tualization is your body and its five senses, as well as all of the physical components that make up your body. The tissue, bones, rivers of fluids, organs, teeth, brain, and everything else are all the machine. And within this machine is an invisible I that you call mind or spirit comprised of thoughts that direct the machine. I once had a conversation with a neurosurgeon who was dis- puting the presence of this invisible world by saying that he'd cut into thousands of bodies and had never seen a soul. I remember his awkward look when I asked him if he'd ever seen a thought while he was poking around inside a brain. Obviously there's an invisible inner as well as an outer part of your being. You have a conceptualization of yourself that involves 29 WISHES FULFILLED this formless invisible portion of your being, and you have a pretty specific idea about just how far this inner portion of yourself can take you. You may believe that your thinking apparatus is pretty phenomenal, though not understanding exactly what it is — inside or surrounding you — that allows you to scratch your forehead, or pick up a pencil, or move your feet on a dance floor, or any of the infinite commands that your mind is capable of directing all day, every day, and for as long as you are alive. You also have a self-concept about what your inner energetic ghost cannot do. Is it capable of thinking itself out of a serious dis- ease, or is that just a lot of nonsense? Can your invisible intel- ligence, your imagination, perform feats of alchemy? Does your self-concept contain the power to perform great — or even magical — acts of transformation? Your self-concept is a blend of your beliefs regarding your connection to a higher power. You believe something about the existence or nonexistence of God. You have various points of view about how far faith can carry you. Whether or not there is anything within you that you can or cannot rely on to per- form mystical or miraculous things is seasoned by your beliefs. You have acquired specific beliefs concerning the power of your mind. You're generally confident that you can rely on your in- visibleness to do the ordinary things in life such as remember an unseen list of items stored somewhere in your memory, and run errands on your way home from work. But what do your beliefs cook up about your ability to create miracles? Is healing your body, or manifesting a long-desired soul mate, an ingredient in your self-concept? Take a moment to examine that unseen list stored away in your mind. Ask yourself, Where is it? How did I pat it there? Where is the place I'm calling \"there\"? What powers am I using to recall it? Where do these powers come from? This is the list of ingredients that you use to create your inner self-concept. You might then want to open up to there being other beliefs or ingredients that you want to include, and contemplate other ways to season your life. 30 Changing Your Concept of Yourself The fact is that an invisible list involves a catalog of inexpli- cable miracles that you take for granted every day. Your inner self- concept tells you what you believe your mind is capable of, and what it's incapable of as well. You know your mind, that invisible ghost in the machine, is unfathomable. But you also know that there are certain limits to what it can do. Have you ever considered how you are creating your life with this inner self-concept's list of ingredients? If it seems interesting to consider some changes, read on. Changing Your Concept of Yourself If you would like to become a person who has the capacity to have all of your wishes fulfilled, it will be necessary for you to move to that higher plane of existence where you are a co- creator of your life. This means that you'll need to undertake what is often presumed to be the difficult task of changing your concept of yourself. Recall that your concept of yourself is everything that you be- lieve to be true about your inner and outer self. Those beliefs have created the life you're now living — at what I call an ordinary level of awareness. To move into the extraordinary space that I'm writ- ing about in this book requires you to change what you believe is true. This can be a laborious project and an undertaking that, in my experience, few people are eager or willing to take on. I am writing this book to give you some very specific guidance and help in doing just that. I'll be quoting a man by the name of Neville Goddard, who wrote and spoke to large audiences in America under the solitary name of Neville. A popular speaker on metaphysical themes from the late '30s until his death in 1972, Neville authored ten books in which he captured the sheer logic of creative mind principles. His work has impacted me in a very profound way; in fact, he's been a great mentor to me in the past few years. 31 WISHES FULFILLED Neville writes in a style that many might find strenuous to in- terpret, yet I find his teaching congruent with much of my earlier writing on manifestation and co-creation. That being said, Nev- ille's teachings add a dimension that I hadn't really contemplated in depth until now. While studying his book The Power of Aware- ness, I began blending many of Neville's teachings with other great thinkers' ideas, revising and refining his unique personal theology into a practice that feels to me is meant for the world we inhabit today. After giving each of my eight children a copy of The Power of Awareness, they individually expressed a variation of this: \"I love his ideas, Dad, but I have to read each paragraph over and over and stop to think about what he's saying. I know he's right and it makes perfect sense, but I need it explained more — in words that I can understand and apply.\" Their comments fueled my desire to share many of Neville's ideas, most of which are compatible with my own, and create a synthesis addressing the power you have to fulfill your 21st-century wishes. I want to share with you my sense of what this great teach- er's ideas can do for you, as they have done for me. I know that Neville wouldn't mind because he freely allowed students and au- dience members to tape his talks without charge. His tapes con- tinue to informally spread his message today, and I've listened to them while preparing to write this book. I feel as a kindred spirit to Neville, since I too have had the same policy during my en- tire speaking career, and have been immersed in the same kinds of spiritual inquiry as this great teacher who preceded me by a single generation. Here is what Neville had to say regarding changing your self- concept in order to elevate your life: \"If you refuse to assume the responsibility of the incarnation of a new and higher concept of yourself, then you reject the means, the only means, whereby your redemption — that is, the attainment of your ideal — can be effected.\" 2 Get this clearly in your head in this first chapter: A higher con- cept of yourself involves taking on new truths and shedding your old views of what you can achieve. This is the only way you can achieve 32 Changing Your Concept of Yourself your desires. That is the reason I'm stressing this early in this book. You must begin by replacing your old set of truths with a belief in the existence of a higher self within you. This is something that you may not have contemplated at an earlier time in your life. Your concept of yourself that includes any limitations can be revised by you, and only by you. Nothing I say or write will do that for you. I have done it for myself and can assist you along this path, but it is your decision to change that creates the possibility of change within you. A new and higher concept of yourself may be shocking and perhaps even be rejected by you, depending on the amount of conditioning you have absorbed throughout your life. That is for you to ponder and contemplate in the next two chapters. At this point, simply allow yourself to imagine that you can create a new and higher concept of yourself. Resistance is what will almost immediately appear for most people, and I encourage you to recognize the resistance within yourself. Overcoming Resistance Making the transition from the level of ordinary conscious- ness to the level of superconsciousness involves a fundamental renewal — a dramatic change of personality. Very few are prepared to commit to this fulfillment of their Divine purpose. What I'm inviting you to do, if you wish to be truly fulfilled, is to overcome your resistance to including all that you are in your earthly life. You have the ability to enter higher regions so as to consciously fulfill your highest desires here, now, for the greater benefit of all. This is akin to doing a somersault and landing in a new reality — a reality in which all things are possible, a reality where you no longer identify yourself with all of those cultural memes and mind viruses that were programmed into you as a young person, preparing you for an ordinary life. You begin this exciting adventure of changing your concept of yourself by being willing to die to your present self. That's right, by relinquishing your personal history as the arbiter of your life, 33 WISHES FULFILLED you cease to resist your fuller potential. You simply no longer choose to form your identity on the basis of what you've been taught. Remind yourself that everything you've believed to be true has brought you to this point where you want to explore rather than resist your higher powers. Years ago while reading Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, I recall him saying that there's one distinguishing characteristic of those who live life at a higher level with a richness that's not just about monetary gain. It is that these unique and rare individuals have a burning desire to succeed. Now, a burning desire is much dif- ferent from a regular wish or desire because it burns inside — once ignited, it never goes out, regardless of what transpires. This is a quality that I know well. Often it feels like an obsession . . . and I have been labeled obsessive many times in my lifetime. Yet it hasn't been a curse, because it has always served me in the fulfill- ment of whatever yearning I felt inside of me. I often think of it as an inner candle flame that never even flickers, though the worst goes before me. All transformation begins with an intense burn- ing desire to be transformed. An inner knowing, along with a burning desire, is the pre- requisite for becoming a person capable of manifesting his or her heart's desires. In The Power of Awareness, Neville emphatically ex- plains that \"To be transformed, the whole basis of your thoughts must change. But your thoughts cannot change unless you have new ideas, for you think from your ideas .\" 3 How do you find the way to ideas that will help you change your thoughts? Start by saying and writing an affirmation that appeals to you. Create your unique heartfelt affirmation, such as: I have a burning desire — an inner flame that will not be extinguished by outer forces — to know and live from higher regions, to be transformed so that my new concept of myself will no longer include any limitations. I am willing to chal- lenge and change any thoughts that impede my having a higher vision of myself. Before closing this introductory chapter, it will be helpful to explore your beliefs about the nature of those things we call thoughts, and how to change them. 34 Changing Your Concept of Yourself Do You Really Think? No one has ever been able to say from whence a thought comes, or what that thought is made up of. It's generally accepted that we think up things and we make up all of our own thoughts. To be perfectly honest, for a large portion of my life, I held these same views on thoughts originating with each individual. But at this juncture I tend to see the entire process as more of an act of observation, contemplation, and choice. I enjoy noticing that I have a continuous stream of thoughts that come from . . . who knows where? They have no boundaries or forms to examine, and apparently are unlimited in number and permutation! I think of the stock market ticker that runs along the bottom of a screen, with each stock price representing a simple thought. You are capable of thinking many opposing thoughts in just a few moments, jumping helter-skelter from one idea to another — exhilaration, frustration, fear, ecstasy, worry, and so forth. Un- guided and unguarded, you serve up an endless array of thoughts continuously from waking to falling asleep. Even while sound asleep, your mind continues observing, grabbing, and contemplat- ing these omnipresent thoughts. There's very little respite from this mental thought-producing process throughout your entire lifetime. If you really believe that you are the creator of all of your thoughts and control the entire process, then simply stop. That's right, just try to stop thinking. You may be able to slow the stream of thoughts down considerably, but to simply stop thinking all day and stay in a thoughtless state is quite impossible. I'm suggesting you open your thought processes to a new idea that will help you as you begin changing your concept of yourself. You can think of yourself as a Divine limitless being rather than a person who doesn't have choice when it comes to your thoughts. Think of yourself as an observer, contemplating and select- ing thoughts that you choose from that never-ending stream of thoughts on your inner screen, 24/7/365. Watch thoughts stream by from wherever they originate, and observe them rapidly transi- tioning and combining and appearing and disappearing. Snatch a 35 WISHES FULFILLED thought from the running ribbon of thoughts and contemplate it. As you toss it around, notice how you feel — sad, depressed, happy, frightened, and so on. Every thought going by has an imprint on your concept of yourself. First be the observer, and then the con- templator. Now become the choice maker who can consciously decide to put that thought back into the running stream and pick a different one, a thought that perhaps allows you to feel better. I am okay, I look fine, I will lose a few pounds, I am loved, I am Divine . . . these and millions more like them are thoughts that you can opt for rather than the ones you've become accustomed to choosing in the past. This is how you begin a new process to change your concept of yourself. You accept as irrevocable that it is not you setting the stream of thoughts into motion, and that stopping thinking isn't possible at this stage of your evolution. At this stage the essence of your being is to observe, contemplate, and then choose. This can all be done in a fraction of a nanosecond. The thoughts will keep appearing on your mental TV screen just like the stock quotations. But you'll now be choosing the ones you want to focus on, gather, retain, or let go. I'm encouraging you to initiate a habit of choosing thoughts and ideas that support feeling good and powerful, and that elevate you to a higher level of consciousness where your self-concept wel- comes your higher self. I love Uell S. Andersen's description of this process in his book Three Magic Words. I leave you to contemplate it as you prepare to befriend that indwelling self that is desperately wishing to be ful- filled at the extraordinary level, rather than at the ordinary where you have lived for far too long: We have assured the indwelling Self that it can be anything it accepts and has faith in, and we are now about to develop in it the habit of choosing only those thoughts and ideas that will constructively add good unto it. We are teaching ourselves to accept only good. . . . We are deliberately compelling ourselves to accept all love, all kindness, all hope, all joy, all expansion, all abundance, all health, all vigor. We are deliberately compel- ling ourselves to reject all suffering, all sorrow, all depression, 36 Changing Your Concept of Yourself all morbidness, all inferiority, all aches and pains. We are saying nothing is true but the great and the good and the beautiful, only these will we add unto ourselves. This is your new way of choosing thoughts that will introduce you to what I am calling your highest self — keeping uppermost in mind that if you want to accomplish something (anything), you must first expect it of yourself. Three Suggestions — Redefine your self-concept by challenging everything that you've held to be true about yourself up until now. Be open to ex- amining everything you've previously thought limited you in any way. Affirm: I place no limits and no restrictions on all that I intend to accomplish and become from here on in. — Allow yourself to become aware of the nonphysical reality that you are a part of. Reach out to the angels or occupants of this higher invisible plane. Know that you can access guidance from those who've lived here before. Spend time in meditation access- ing the feelings of a plane of higher consciousness. — Whenever you're experiencing discomfort or sadness, rather than trying to change the thought behind your emotion- al state, instead just put it back onto the never-ending conveyor belt of thoughts, and then select a different thought. Keep doing this until you've selected a thought that allows you to feel good, and you're no longer condemning yourself for creating unhappy thoughts. 37 Your Higher Self \"From the beginning I had a sense of destiny, as though my life was assigned to me by fate and had to be fidfilled. This gave me an inner security, and, though I could never prove it to myself, it proved itself to me. I did not have the certainty, it had me.\" — Carl Jung For the past 18 months or so I've been deeply involved in the study of what is known as initiatic science, the principal goal of which is to help the initiate/student (meaning you and me) know and trust in the higher self. These ancient teachings repeatedly explain that emphasizing only the needs of our physical self, and ignoring the needs of the higher self, results in the soul and spirit suffocating and dying of hunger and thirst. The initiates of old insisted on the importance of the knowledge of the higher self be- cause this awareness opens up tremendous possibilities for growth, progress, and, yes — the ability to have one's wishes fulfilled. Perhaps it is difficult to imagine yourself so divided as to pro- duce both a higher and a lower self. Very likely this idea of a self within yourself, which is higher than what you think of as your real self, is foreign to your way of thinking. I have long referred to this lower self or false self as the ego — a part of you that believes 39 WISHES FULFILLED you're defined by what you achieve, own, or win. It's a belief that whatever status you've accumulated is proof that you're a separate being possessing particular strengths or limitations. It probably isn't a surprise that I suggest there are different beliefs that can and will put you on the path of happiness, success, and health that you desire. This idea of having a higher self that transcends the seif de- scriptor derived from almost universal identification with the ego may be difficult to internalize. If you've read the first chapter of this book, then you know that it's necessary that you make the choice to change what you believe is true. Remind yourself that your current concept of who you are has landed you right here, reading a book on how to become a more powerful person. Are you willing to internalize radical new ideas that require a shift in your concept of yourself? Are you receptive to the idea of having a higher self that isn't defined by ego concerns? Are you able to entertain the idea of an unlimited higher self that is within you? Can you imagine that you can eschew ego's limiting demands that are keeping you stuck at an ordinary level of con- sciousness? In other words, can you approach the question of Who am I? with complete unknowing? Conceiving the idea of a higher self begins with this personal inner query. So let's first examine this question of who you are. Who Am I? Consider how many bodies you've occupied since birth. Who is the I that continues to leave one body behind and then enter another? You know for certain that you — the person that you call I, the one attempting to figure out who you are — started out in a little baby body weighing somewhere between five and ten pounds. The I that is you fully entered and occupied that little baby body. Gradually you began to discard that baby body and move into a small toddler body that crawled, then walked, then ran, and took on an entirely new appearance. Your two-year-old 40 Your Higher Self self would find it difficult to recognize the baby body that you'd now completely abandoned. You lived in this toddler body for a while and then discarded it, too, including every cell that was in your body at birth. The subsequent body you entered was a pre- pubescent body that bore a similarity to your toddler body but was completely different. The I in the question still hasn't been discovered, but it's be- come absolutely clear that you are obviously not your body. Why? Because the I has remained, though it continuously sheds the body that it occupies. This strange phenomenon of you being an I that continuously enters, discards, and reenters a new body has proceeded right up until this very moment. I am currently in a 70-year-old body that's nothing like the body I occupied 50 years ago. I remember well what that 20-year- old body I occupied looked like, what it could do, and what it knew and didn't know, but I can't find it anywhere — it's simply an illusion. It is gone from this physical world, as is every body that both you and I have occupied in our lifetime. The I that I use to describe myself is not so obsessed that he insists upon staying only in one body. In fact, that I that is me finally recognizes the ancient spiritual truth spoken by Divine masters since antiquity: None of us are really doing anything, rather we (our bodies) are merely being done. What is your body being done by? An invisible organizing in- telligence that takes the cells of your body, changes them into new cells, and discards the old cells. The I that you think you are observes the entire process — for the most part, helplessly. The physical body that you think of as you is rearranged in a pattern designed by a formless intelligence independent of your opinions. This I that you use to describe yourself isn't the physical form that you occupy and take with you everywhere. Quantum physics states that the body you're occupying, which is reading this para- graph right now, is completely different from the body you were in when you read the previous paragraph. Such is the nature of the physical world in which we all live. 41 WISHES FULFILLED The ancient philosopher Heraclitus put it this way several thousand years ago, and it is true today: \"All things are in motion and nothing is at rest. . . . You cannot go into the same [river] twice.\" A river is a constantly changing phenomenon, as is a tree, a mountain, a goat, a human, and the physical universe including Earth. That which defines a thing, therefore, is not physical in nature; it is metaphysical. When asked \"What is real?\" an ancient spiritual avatar responded without hesitation, \"That is real which never changes.\" And since your body is in a continuous state of change, it is not real. If you try to find that toddler body you once occupied, you realize that it is not real, since it no longer exists. Even while you were in it years ago, you couldn't call it real, because the moment you pinpointed and defined it as real, it would be something else, something new. What you're calling real would already have dis- appeared. Still, you know with all of this change taking place that there is a changeless component to who you are. The I in that tod- dler body hasn't changed, it is in the body that you currently oc- cupy. The I is your higher self, changeless and real. This higher self is who you are. When you make this discovery and consciously befriend the I you are, nothing is impossible. In Chapter One I explained the necessity of creating a new concept of yourself: as an infinite spiritual being having a tem- porary, human experience. As you read on, keep in mind that if it is changing, it is not real. The I in the question Who am I? isn't anything that involves the physical you, since that continuously changes and disappears. Therefore, to answer the question Who am I ? with any reference to your body and its various talents, ac- complishments, accumulations, or physical prowess is to define yourself as unreal. Who you are, then, must be changeless, and therefore birthless as well as deathless. Who you are is a formless energy — a spirit, if you will — with the capacity to be unchanged, and at the same time occupy an infinity of bodies. Think about this — it is truly a bewildering phenomenon. You are changeless and therefore real. What you've believed were facts explaining who you are, are simply illusions — or what 42 Your Higher Self metaphysicians call unreal. You were convinced by some well- intentioned relatives, teachers, and cultural influences that you were really this ego of yours, when in fact everything that the ego uses to define you is disappearing as fast as you can assess it. Your possessions, achievements, reputations, trophies, bank ac- counts — even your family members, including your children — are all aspects of a world that is changing, dissolving to nothingness ... all unreal. Here is how a brilliant scribe described this phenomenon poetically: This quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies And Lads and Girls; Was laughter and ability and sighing, And frocks and carls. This passive place a summer's nimble mansion, Where Bloom and Bees Fulfilled their Oriental Circuit, Then ceased like these. In this poem, Emily Dickinson reminds you with her dazzling honesty that all ceases and turns to dust — everything you may have believed was the real you, including the body and all of its accomplishments, and even its laughing and sighing. But the real I that is you can smile at all of those lower-self, ego-identified pro- ceedings. Your higher self exists beyond that lower, false self. It is in fact higher than all of your earthbound identities. You have a self that can look down from a more exalted posi- tion upon that lower, ego-dominated self. So begin to know your- self as something far greater than the ever- changing, ever-dying aspects that have dominated your picture of who you are. Who am I? is then answered with, I am an infinite being who originated not from my parents, but from a Source that is itself birthless, deathless, and changeless. 43 WISHES FULFILLED Your Connection to Source We have all been created from the same Source, and it is my conclusion that we must be like what we came from. It matters not what we call this Source. The Tao that can be named, is not the eternal Tao is the message in the opening lines of the Tao Te Ching. Call it Tao, call it God, call it Jehovah, call it Divine mind — it matters not. You are merely interested in recognizing that you originated from the Source of all life in a form you know as your constantly changing physical body, which obviously contains the creative energy that you came from. Read these words, recorded during a 1967 lecture given by an initiatic science master, Omraam Mikhael A'fvanhov: The creator has planted within every creature a fragment of himself, a spark, a spirit of the same nature as himself and, thanks to this spirit, every creature can become a creator. And this means that, instead of always waiting for their needs to be satisfied by some external source, human beings can work in- wardly by means of their thought, their will, and their spirit to obtain the nourishing healing elements they need. This is why the teaching I bring you is of the spirit, of the creator and not of matter . . . I love this quote because it speaks to a part of you that has been largely ignored throughout all of your educational pursuits and accomplishments. The key words here are \"a fragment of him- self, a spark\" that lies within you, but has largely been left un- examined. This is a great image for you to begin to understand the greatness of your higher self. There is a spark of God within you that is the invisibleness I've been alluding to. It is that which you cannot grasp with the senses — it beats your heart, grows your hair, and keeps your lungs breathing in and breathing out. You've be- come accustomed to taking it for granted while putting the major focus of your life on the physical (unreal) you. My objective in this chapter and the next is to inspire you to recognize that a spark — a tiny fragment of the creative source of the universe — is located within you, and to help you increase 44 Your Higher Self the power of that spark so it becomes the primary force in your everyday life. Review the first chapter and affirm your willingness to change your concept of yourself to help you recognize and in- crease that spark. Then dedicate yourself to exploring this higher self I'm writing about. Your higher self is that spark, but a spark is an infinitesimal portion of your physical being. If you weigh 150 pounds, that spark weighs maybe l/100th of an ounce. This is only a symbolic image (because the \"spark\" is unchanging), but I'm encouraging you to conceptualize that spark of God inside of you. Imagine it growing to double its size, then a tenfold spark, then maybe a shred, then a segment, then a chunk, then a lump, then a piece or a section . . . and just perceive that spark of God as the real you becoming visible through your loving and inviting attentiveness, until you feel the sacred presence of your higher self as the guid- ing light of your life. Ultimately, as I'll discuss later, it will overtake the you that's been dominated by ego and your sensory apparatus. That former speck of a spark will be the foundation of your life. You might conceptualize this former spark as a sacred light inside of your head that is the same size as your brain. Now you have a big piece of God to assist you in attaining a status wherein the fulfillment of your wishes becomes a no-brainer, or perhaps you'd call it a new-brainer. This new brain is comprised exclusively of infinite God energy. Your Higher Self at Work Every Day I want you to seriously contemplate another observation made by the initiatic spiritual master Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov, in a lecture given in January 1971: \"Our higher self is perfect, omni- scient and almighty, a fragment of God Himself, a pure, transpar- ent, luminous quintessence.\" This will very likely be a challenge for you as you consider a new concept of yourself by accepting some truths that you have 45 WISHES FULFILLED been raised to believe are falsehoods. Yet I ask you to study this ancient spiritual teaching, which is designed to familiarize you with a radical idea about the powers you possess just by the fact that you are a living, breathing human being. If you are com- mitted to accessing your higher consciousness, then you must be willing to do what is required in order to integrate what this great initiatic teacher is offering. In order to accomplish becoming an almighty being, your higher self (God) must be enlarged from a spark to a more mean- ingful portion of your essence. Since you are a piece of God and therefore have that within you, you needn't doubt your own di- vinity. As Jesus reminds you, \"Is it not written in your law, 'I said, \"You are gods'\"?\" (John 10:34). As a growing spark of God, you must be willing to say, \"That portion of myself that has not edged God out (ego) must be perfect; it is all-knowing and it is almighty. There is nothing that this higher self that I am cannot accomplish.\" Once again, let's look at something Jesus told us: \"With God all things are possible\" (Matthew 19:26). All things are possible leaves nothing out. As my teachers in the initiatic sciences frequently reminded me, this higher self — that portion of God that is us — only begins to notice us and give us the attention we crave when we enlarge it from a tiny spark and invite the energy into our life. Your awareness that God isn't something external to you but rather a portion of yourself is truly a giant step in your spiritual evolution. You can tell yourself with genuine knowing, I am per- fect. (All forms of I am have tremendous significance, as you will learn when you delve into the next chapter on your highest self.) In this chapter you are discovering your higher self. God no longer re- sides outside of you, and no longer plays favorites. In short, you've revised humankind's image of a god created in its own egoistic idea of itself. A god who knows how to heal yet withholds healing from some and offers it to others who are presumed to have paid some kind of dues? A god who is angry? A god who gives humans the pleasure of sexuality but promises to burn in hell those who don't 46 Your Higher Self follow rules devised by other humans? A god who gives us eyes and remains invisible, but threatens damnation for those who don't believe in him? A god who demands to be paid for services, with fancy temples and gold-lined costumes for his highest repre- sentatives? This is a god of the ego. Your higher self is a piece of an all-loving, all-embracing cre- ative Source. All you need do is accept that this is not something external to yourself. It resides within you (the kingdom of heav- en is within) — in fact, it is you — and all you need do is begin to align yourself with this Divine essence, begin to act like it acts and think like it thinks, and you will begin the process of manifest- ing just as it does. This is the true essence of living a life in which your wishes are fulfilled. Give your Divine nature a chance. (The second part of this book provides a step-by-step plan for allowing your higher self to take over the process of fulfilling your desires.) In these opening chapters, I hope to jar you into an awareness of how powerful a being you really are when you get past so much of the nonsensical conditioning that has dominated your encul- turation. Toss out any self-limiting ideas about your Divine nature and what it is capable of achieving. Befriend that spark, consult it frequently, nurture it, pay close attention to it, believe in it, and practice describing yourself first as a spiritual being — one who lives as frequently as possible from this all-loving, all-giving, all- joyful place called your higher self. Your higher self is just what it says: higher than your false self, higher than your material physi- cal self. It is the part of you that is aligned with your very Source of being. In the next chapter, you have the opportunity to consider an even more unlikely assertion in light of all that you've been ex- posed to since childhood. Not only do you have a lower ego-based false self, as well as a spiritually based higher self that is a piece of God, but you have a highest self. A self that you have been trained to believe is not something that you should ever claim. Your high- est self awaits you in Chapter Three. 47 WISHES FULFILLED Three Suggestions — Set aside multiple times during your day to stop and ask yourself this key question: Right now in what I am about to say or do, do my desires stem from my lower or my higher self? The ego is all about self-serving, ownership, winning, judging, and so on. The higher self is about serving, loving, and being in a nonjudgmental state of peace. Ask yourself this question, and create the opportu- nity to align yourself more fully with God. You then have access to the same powers of manifestation as your Source of being. This question, when honestly explored, helps you align with the power to fulfill your wishes and desires. You don't need to abolish your ego animal nature. You do need to keep it tamed so it isn't allowed to overshadow or destroy your spirit. Give your Divine nature a chance by asking yourself this question. — Spend some of your quiet meditation time visualizing a tiny spark of awareness glowing within your being. Practice seeing this God-portion of yourself expanding its glow within your mind. See it growing into a personally satisfying size. Continue this expan- sion exercise sensing the spark/glow as your God essence. You will begin acting from this inner God-realized image. — Use these affirmations frequently: I am all-knowing, I am all- powerful, I am unlimited. This helps you banish doubt and refer to this portion of yourself that lives in a spiritual world of no restric- tions. Simply affirm to yourself without explaining to others or demonstrating pride in what you're doing. You are ridding your- self of ego-dominated mental messages that continue to want to convince you that you are primarily your body and its five senses. 48 CHAPTER THREE Your Highest Self \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus , who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God.\" — Philippians 2 : 5~6 In the previous chapter you explored the idea that there's a spark of God within you, which you can choose to expand into a consciously larger component of your daily life. This spark is your spiritual essence — your higher self. As your awareness increases that you are a God-realized being, you will welcome it as the cen- tral focus of your life. The concept of your higher self will gradually evolve into your highest self, which is truly omniscient, almighty, and capable of producing miracles. Here you will see a new reality — a majestic idea of yourself that previously seemed inconceivable. Your high- est self is described in the pronouncement in the display quote at the beginning of this chapter, written by Saint Paul in his letters to the Philippians in the New Testament. You move from being a spark or a fragment of God to being able to assert that I am God and not feel as if you're committing blasphemy or a cardinal sin by such a declaration. Here, the idea that you are equal with God 49 WISHES FULFILLED was promoted by Christ Jesus, and you are encouraged by him to “Let this mind be in you . . .\" This isn't the God created by humans — the ego-driven deity who plays favorites, requires ostentatious places of worship, has temper tantrums, demands reparations, and is filled with rage, punishing those who do not do his bidding. Not even close! I am speaking here of the creative Source of all being, a God Who is responsible for creating the miraculous movement from nonbeing to being, a God Who is formless — Who does nothing yet leaves nothing undone — a God Who is everywhere. This is a Divine in- visible presence that's within you. This idea is at the basis of all great spiritual teaching throughout all time. Much of organized religious teaching proclaims that God is an ail-powerful being outside of you. That idea has been thrown at you since you were old enough to process this absurd notion. God, you were told, watches you and punishes you if you misbehave, but listens to your prayers and helps you resolve your conflicts if you do the right thing and please Him. Perhaps it is a radical idea for you to declare, “I am God\" and “God is love,\" or believe that “He who abides in love abides in God, and God in him\" (1 John 4:16) is who you are. When you are this God, this essence of pure love, it is all you have to give away, and when you realign yourself in this vein (once again quoting Jesus the Christ), “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\" Now, all things are possible leaves out nothing, including your ability to fulfill any and all wishes that are aligned with God. You may find it difficult at first to be able to assert to yourself that I am God. But when you put it into the context of God as love (and pure love allows you to be almighty, all-knowing, and God- realized), you will, I assure you, begin to regain the omnipotence that is your essence from the moment of your transition from nonbeing (spirit) to being (human). I emphasize these teachings of Jesus to show that the declaration of I am God is not only not in opposition to the teachings of Christianity or other spiritual prac- tices, but is fully aligned with these earlier teachings. The reason 50 Your Highest Self it may seem blasphemous to say that I am God is because we've adopted the God of the ego, created by humans from ego-based ideas of a God that imitates our most unholy human attributes. I've been studying two great spiritual teachers in depth for several years as I've prepared to write this book. One of them is Uell S. Andersen, and the book of his that I read, studied, medi- tated upon, and am now living and teaching is titled Three Magic Words. The book is 323 pages long, and it was not u"
