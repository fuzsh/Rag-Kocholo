        "text": "We are student-centric. We provide students with research opportunities and internships, which allow them to work on topics that combine business and government policy. Select students will attend the Annual Robson Conference; many will attend lectures by the Robson Distinguished Lecturers.\n\nWe are community-oriented. We bring together leaders in the fields of business, public policy, and government with faculty and students. This multi-disciplinary program will link Emory University with institutions in the greater community.\n\nWe are nonpartisan. We present diverse views and encourage dialogue between leaders of diverse backgrounds and policy beliefs.\n\nWe address critical topics bridging business and policy. We consider a wide range of contemporary issues in, for example, healthcare, public health, financial regulation, economic mobility and inequality, sustainability, and the future of jobs in the age of automation.\n\nWe address issues of all political, governmental, and geographic scales. We focus on a variety of problems of different magnitude, e.g. ranging from local and state workforce development to national budgetary and tax policies, rising populism and the future of Free Trade Areas to global business and cybersecurity threats.\n\nJohn E.

Bush administration’s trade and foreign policy.\n\n“John Robson had a passion for linking business and public policy in positive ways,” Associate Professor and Program Director Jeff Rosensweig said. “John personified the rare leader who succeeds in business, government, and civic service and academia. We will ensure students interact with exemplary leaders from all these spheres.”\n\nThe Robson family remains connected to the school, in part, by supporting an MBA scholarship.\n\n“My father’s years at Emory were some of the most rewarding of his career,” Robson's son, Douglas, said. “Both my parents would be proud and excited to know the groundwork he laid is being carried forward with this new initiative.”\n\nPrevious Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University\n\nFormer Supreme Allied Commander of NATO\n\nAdmiral James Stavridis was the 12th Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University since its founding in 1933.
