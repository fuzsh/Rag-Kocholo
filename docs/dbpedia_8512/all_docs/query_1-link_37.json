        "text": "Well I don't want to derail the thread but whether you want to admit it or not usually life is easier for good looking people than it is for those not so good looking. If you have seen any dvds of GG Allin, he shows some very self destructing tendencies, the kind that someone with no redeeming qualities including looks would do to get attention. What I'm trying to say is, people who look good usually get what they want without knocking their own teeth out to stand out in a crowd. I was very surprised to see how he looked before he became the person we see in the end of his career. He looks like he's in his 20's in that photo, what made him all of a sudden just destroy himself?\n\nI don't think that's necessarily true at all. I DO think that many people unfortunately believe that, though.\n\nAgain, I have to disagree with your perception here. Elvis was considered a good-looking fellow, and he became quite self-destructive. Kurt Cobain, to many, was considered handsome.\n\nPhysical attractiveness is subjective, anyway. And I've met countless people that I would consider to be good-looking, that don't consider themselves as such. And I've known a person that, when they \"became\" good-looking (that is, recognized as being such) only THEN developed (or at least, began to exhibit) self-destructive qualities.\n\nHe obviously needed to do what he did to get what he wanted. But different people have different personal \"demons\" (for lack of a better term). They can be unrelated to how YOU perceive their supposed attractiveness, or they can be BECAUSE of their perceived attractiveness. One can never be sure.\n\nI don't know that it was \"all of a sudden\". His self-destructive behavior seems to have been life-long. It's possible that he was \"destroying\" himself, or being \"destroyed\", in different ways, and/or ways that were just not obvious until later.\n\nOK\n\nthe music might be punk, but they way he acted isn't... I hate it when people define punk as this type of lifestyle... Real punk is actualy the opposite of this."
