        "text": "American punk rock band\n\nThe Jabbers are an American punk rock band. Perhaps best known for having GG Allin as the frontman at the beginning of his career in the late 1970s to early 1980s, many of his most well-known songs were recorded with the band, such as \"Don't Talk to Me\" and \"Bored to Death\".\n\nOne review of the only Jabbers album with Allin, Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be, states: \"Amazingly enough, the violent hatred, sexual and psychological degradation, and staggering stupidity only hint at the heights (or depths) Allin would reach later.\"[1]\n\nEmbryonic versions of the band appeared as early as 1977, focused around Allin (singing and occasionally playing drums), his brother Merle Allin on bass, and various local guitarists. By 1979, the live group featured bassist Alan Chapple and guitarist Rob Basso; guitarist Chris Lamy joined in 1980, and Michael O'Donnell became the group's drummer in 1983.[2] The group disbanded in May 1984, and Allin next led The Scumfucs. Their complete recordings with Allin are on the Banned in Boston compilation.\n\nIn 2003, Chapple, Lamy, and O'Donnell reformed the band with new singer Wimpy Rutherford and lead guitarist Harlan Miller (both ex-members of the pop punk group The Queers). They released an album entitled American Standard in 2005 on Steel Cage Records.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nas GG Allin\n\nYear Album Label Format 1980 Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be Orange Records LP\n\nas The Jabbers\n\nYear Album Label Format 2005 American Standard Steel Cage Records CD\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nas GG Allin & The Jabbers\n\nYear Album Label Format 1981 Band in Boston No Label Cassette 1982 Tasteless Animal Noise No Label Cassette 1982 Bored Again No Label Cassette 1983 Live at the A7 Club No Label Cassette\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nas GG Allin & The Jabbers\n\nYear Album Label Format 1990 Banned in Boston Black & Blue Records CD\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nas GG Allin\n\nYear Album Label Format 1982 You Hate Me & I Hate You Orange Records CD 1982 No Rules Orange Records 7\"\n\nas GG Allin & The Jabbers\n\nYear Album Label Format 1979 Bored to Death Blood Records CD\n\nas The Jabbers\n\nYear Album Label Format 2005 Badass Blood Records CD\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nas GG Allin & The Jabbers\n\nYear Single Label Format 1980 \"Cheri Love Affair\" Destiny Records 7\"\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
