I Live To Be Hated\n6. Kiss Me In The Gutter\n7. Stick A Cross etc.\n8. Lilliana Phone\n9. Cornhole Lust\n10. Isolation\n11. Fury And Fire\n\nWARNING/ GUARANTEE: THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST OFFENSIVE GG ALLIN RECORD EVER MADE. It was meant to offend everybody. It will offend YOU. Purchase or listen at your own risk. \r\n\r\nThese are the original recordings for &quot;The Suicide Sessions&quot; album, which were only released for a brief time in 1989. And then, only on cassette. Most of the songs on &quot;The Suicide Rehearsals&quot; are different versions from what came out on &quot;The Suicide Sessions&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The Suicide Rehearsals&quot; cd is mastered directly from the original production tape, so it&#39;s going to sound as good as it probably ever will sound. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that it was recorded to be deliberately lo fi and raw. \r\n\r\nCD and cassette contain liner notes relating to the story of how the album was made.\r\n\r\nPOLITICALLY INCORRECT IN EVERY REGARD. PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION.",
