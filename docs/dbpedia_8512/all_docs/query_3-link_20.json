        "text": "Jabber was a competitor robot that fought exclusively in Series 7 of Robot Wars. In its only appearance, it lost in the first round on a judges' decision, after spending the majority of the battle being carried around the arena by Mantis.\n\nDesign[]\n\nJabber was an invertible, triangular-shaped robot with a low profile and armed with a spinning bar blade as its main weapon. The blade weighed 4.5kg and spun up to 1500rpm, while the robot also featured a pair of rear spikes as a secondary weapon. Jabber was heavily armoured and very quick according to the team, but had a 10cm ground clearance which was easily exploited during its only appearance.\n\nRobot History[]\n\nSeries 7[]\n\nJabber participated in Heat K, and was drawn against fellow newcomer Mantis, veteran Infernal Contraption and the twelfth seed and Tag Team Terror champion Bulldog Breed in the first round.\n\nIt was slow to get away in the opening seconds, being launched into the air by Infernal Contraption's drum before slamming head-on into the latter. Jabber was then grabbed and lifted by Mantis, which drove towards the arena wall and attempted to dump Jabber over it, before gripping its wheel, carrying it to Refbot and parading it across the arena. Bulldog Breed came in to try and flip both Mantis and Jabber, but got wedged under Mantis' weapon, and Mantis finally dropped Jabber after driving it into Sgt. Bash's CPZ. Jabber was cornered by Sgt. Bash and Mr. Psycho, and played very little part in the remainder of the fight until it was flipped by Bulldog Breed, who revealed to have mesh falling out from its flipper, just before 'cease' was called.\n\nJabber survived to a Judges' decision, but the decision went against it and Infernal Contraption, eliminating both robots from the Seventh Wars.\n\nResults[]\n\nJABBER - RESULTS Series 7 The Seventh Wars - UK Championship\n\nHeat, Round 1 Heat K, Round 1 vs. Bulldog Breed (12), Infernal Contraption, Mantis Eliminated\n\nWins/Losses[]\n\nWins: 0\n\nLosses: 1\n\nSeries Record[]\n\nSeries Jabber Series Record The First Wars Did not enter The Second Wars Did not enter The Third Wars Did not enter The Fourth Wars Did not enter The Fifth Wars Did not enter The Sixth Wars Did not enter The Seventh Wars Heat, Round 1 Series 8 Did not enter Series 9 Did not enter Series 10 Did not enter\n\nGallery[]"
