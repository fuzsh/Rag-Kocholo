        "text": "Titled GG Allin: Live. Fast. Die., a biopic centered on controversial punk rocker GG Allin is on the way from director Jonas Åkerlund (Lords of Chaos), THR reports this afternoon.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter notes in their announcement, “The producers have acquired Allin’s life and music rights, and have a script written by Richard Schenkman (Mischief Night).\n\nGG Allin: Live. Fast. Die. is said to explore “what happens to a borderline personality when the reach for fame exceeds the limits of talent… when substance abuse goes unchecked and mental illness undiagnosed and untreated… and when a fictional character takes over a real person’s life, driving GG beyond limits anyone could possibly endure.”\n\n“Allin was a cult and fringe figure in the 1980s punk scene that became notorious for his outrageous acts on stage, notably defecating on stage and sometimes hurling it at his audience,” THR reminds. “His shows frequently ended in chaos and violence and he found himself frequently arrested and imprisoned. Allin fell headlong into booze and drugs while putting out albums — punk, spoken word, and country — mostly on cassette in the 80s.”\n\n“This is exactly the type of real and raw story I am looking for and this film explores the ugly belly of the beast and how Kevin Allin came to be GG,” said Åkerlund in a statement. “Punk was already a genre about pushing limits, expanding on musical genres and the definition of artistic expression. At a time when punk was thought to be dead, sold out or too raw to survive, GG came into the scene bleeding, pissing, and sinking like no punk before. Live. Fast. Die. is about a sick person who should have asked for help. GG’s strong persona was a gia, but this borderline personality disorder was not treated, and killed him.”\n\nProducers are Don Murphy and Susan Monford of Angry Films and MVD Entertainment Group.\n\nMortal Kombat will have some company in the film adaptation arena. Sega’s 1993 Sega Genesis brawler Eternal Champions has been picked up for an adaptation, courtesy of Skydance and Jurassic World and Kong: Skull Island writer Derek Connolly.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, the Eternal Champions project will have Ellison, alongside Dana Goldberg and Don Granger producing for Skydance. Meanwhile, Toru Nakahara, who has been head of the adaptation of Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, will produce on behalf of Sega. Rob Ree, who was able to bring Skydance and Sega together for the project, will server as executive producer, while Aimee Rivera will oversee the project for Skydance.\n\nThe Eternal Champions adaptation isn’t the only videogame-to-film project Connolly will be working on, as he’s also involved with Sony and Nintendo’s adaptation of The Legend of Zelda.\n\nReleased in 1993 as part of the fighting game craze, Sega’s Eternal Champions followed an omniscient being known as the Eternal Champion, who foresees that mankind will soon fade from existence due to the untimely deaths of key people throughout history. Seeking to restore balance to the world, the Eternal Champion gathers these nine individuals from across time just before their deaths, holding a fighting tournament between them. The victor of the tournament will regain their life, as well as changing their fate while bringing balance to the universe.\n\nAs was the case in the wake of Mortal Kombat, Eternal Champions featured bloody over-the-top finishing moves specific to each stage, known as “Overkills“. The game was followed up by an update in 1995 for the Sega CD called Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side, which boasted additional characters, more Overkills, and other finishing moves."
