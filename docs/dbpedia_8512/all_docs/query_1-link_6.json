        "text": "GG, being the way he was, would probably have loved it knowing you disliked his vocals!\n\nI'm working on a few more punk rockers, but I'm having difficulty. I started on Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan of the New York Dolls (the prototypical punk band) and the Heartbreakers, but I'm having trouble. Johnny's ancestry is mostly Italian, not an area I'm experienced with, and Jerry's biological father is unknown, leaving only his mother's side available to research.\n\nJohnny and Joey Ramone of The Ramones also have barebones profiles. They were all born after the 1940 census and it seems their families kept a low profile, therefore it's hard to identify their parents from the meager sources we have available."
