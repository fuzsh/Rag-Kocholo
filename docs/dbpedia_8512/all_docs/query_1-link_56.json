That’s what we did all the time.”\n\nDuring the interview, Merle also discussed his brother’s downward spiral at the end of his life, and how “pushing the envelope” eventually led GG to more violent, controversial stage performances, before he passed away in 1993 from a heroin overdose.\n\n“I feel that my poor brother got trapped in his own… insanity maybe? Because he always seemed to have to push the envelope a little more,” Merle said. “Once you have that kind of persona, people expect things of you, [and then] you have to take it to another level.”\n\n“As he got a little older, alcohol consumption didn’t help matters at all. And the drug thing; my brother was not a junkie by any means – he didn’t really do heroin hardly at all.”\n\n“He’d do whatever you gave him – if you gave him drugs he’d take them [and] he wouldn’t even ask you what they were. But he wasn’t a junkie: drugs were not his problem. Alcohol was.”\n\nWatch the full interview below:"
