(The shortening of his name to \"GG\" was born out of his brother Merle's mispronunciations.) His name was changed to Kevin Michael Allin by his mother, who left the marriage and took GG and Merle with her, to avoid him being bullied in school. Inspired by rock & roll at an early age, GG began playing drums for local bands, which eventually resulted in him fronting The Jabbers and their releasing of Always Was, Is, And Always Shall Be in 1980 (possibly his least controversial album).\n\nAllin's increasing mental instability and drug abuse eventually resulted in him splitting from the Jabbers. GG went on to front several underground punk bands, such as the Scumfucs and the Cedar Street Sluts, and recorded numerous albums that are now out of print. As the 1980s progressed, his live shows became more extreme in nature thanks to GG's desire to shock and provoke, culminating in his infamous coprophagia. His philosophy had become extremely individualist and anarchist, once calling himself the 'last true rock & roller.'\n\nOne of his most infamous claims was that, on Halloween in 1989, he would commit suicide on stage, in order to make a statement about choosing your own fate and ending when one is at one's peak. He was in prison when the day arrived, and in fact, a similar situation would repeat for a few years afterward, and when asked why he didn't follow up on the threat, he responded with the quote at the top of the page. Due to his antisocial behavior on stage and off, he wound up serving several jail sentences, one of which was for the alleged assault of a fan. GG never did wind up making his grand exit: on the morning of June 28, 1993, GG was found dead of an overdose. He was 36.\n\nGG Allin, alongside one of his most famous backing bands, the Murder Junkies, were the subject of the documentary Hated.\n\nGG Allin provided examples of:[]"
