        "text": "Hi JAMFNation!\n\nI have spent the better part of the past hour wracking my brain trying to figure out a way to automate setting up supported users with an internal jabber server.\n\nI know that if i do a user level configuration profile that it will auto populate $USERNAME with the login user value but the issue i have is that the chat server username is USER@chatserver.uncc.edu... And so for my attempts to use $USERNAME along with the server portion have resulted in it just using $username@chatserver.uncc.edu\n\nIs there a means with which i can use the JSS value identifier and append the chat server section or should i start looking into other methods of automating this out?\n\n- I am @exno or @exnozero on almost everything that exists."
