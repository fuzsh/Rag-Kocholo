        "text": "Has rock music ever produced a more troubled frontman than GG Allin?\n\nThe reason I ask is because while moving house this week I found an unwatched copy of Hated, the biopic of the notoriously scatological punk singer, which someone sent me and which I finally felt compelled to view. It is also approaching 15 years since Allin died aged 36 and this film reminds why he - rightly - remains music's most transgressive and vilified frontman.\n\nHated makes for a grim portrait of a man damaged on many levels, whose one \"asset\" was his kamikaze approach to life, art and morality. For Allin, rock 'n' roll translated as \"no rules\", a place where nihilism reigned supreme and nothing was taboo.\n\nMore famous for his live shows than his records (released with a variety of bands including the Scumfucs, the Disappointments, the Murder Junkies - you get the picture), an Allin gig was a spectacle, a let-down and - quite often - a crime scene.\n\nHis performances involved getting naked before physically or sexually assaulting audience members. He would often guzzle laxatives, excrete on stage, then smear himself in his own mess. Most shows ended prematurely, sometimes in arrest. Tour itineraries were often binned as GG was carted off to the penitentiary.\n\nIn life, as in music, Allin traded on a reputation of fear, intimidation and destruction, which in turn lead to him gaining a small but dedicated following of die-hards in the hardcore punk underground - fans comparable to those lost souls who blindly followed Charles Manson down a path of empty rhetoric-driven destruction two decades earlier.\n\nAllin is only really worthy of note in music because he made all other frontmen seem tame by comparison - but not in a good way. He took his influences - Iggy Pop, Hank Williams, Stiv Bators, New York Dolls - to new extremes, crossing the boundary from edgy punk frontman to criminal. He was never cool either. He wasn't an art school kid making a situationist statement, he was a troubled junkie. He didn't get busted for pot (man) - he was jailed for cowardly crimes, like assaulting and abusing women. Ultimately, his outlaw status had little to do with him playing in a band.\n\nBeing born Jesus Christ Allin - as his father insisted he should be named - possibly didn't get him off to the best of starts, but Allin made no excuses. He simply existed to be hated, yet save for some widely-watched talk show appearances, the irony is he was largely ignored.\n\nOnly in death did GG Allin achieve some sort of recognition as a footnote in rock's books of apocryphal. His grizzly myth was accidentally sealed on June 28 1993 when he fled a New York show and took to the streets naked, covered in faeces and in search of heroin. He then went to an apartment and fatally overdosed. Some fans in attendance had their pictures taken with him without realising he was already dead; they couldn't tell the difference. He died as he lived - rather pathetically."
