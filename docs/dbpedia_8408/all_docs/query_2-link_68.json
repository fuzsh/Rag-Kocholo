In particular, in the private sector, both businesses and households already have lower levels of debt than before the pandemic and much lower than they had during the financial crisis of 2008. All this, together with the greater weight of fixed-rate debt, puts them in a less vulnerable position to cope with the rise in interest rates.",

        "text": "The total debt of the Spanish economy increased by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter (21.5 billion euros) in Q1 2023 to 3.71 billion, although relative to GDP it fell by 5.3 points to 272.8%, the lowest ratio since Q1 2009, due to the significant increase in nominal GDP. This decrease in overall levels of debt has been driven exclusively by the non-financial private sector (households and businesses), since general government debt rose slightly to 131.9% of GDP, although it is still close to its lowest levels since 2013.\n\nIn the case of households and businesses, their debt fell by 28.4 billion euros to a total of 1.92 billion, equivalent to 140.9% of GDP (146.6% at the close of 2022); in consolidated terms (excluding debt between companies, since in many cases this corresponds to holdings between parent and subsidiary companies), private debt stood at 121.1% (125.4% previously), so it remains below the threshold set by the European Commission in the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). Indeed, we have to go back almost 20 years (to Q2 2003) to find a lower ratio.\n\nNext, we will analyse the financial flows and balances of households and businesses in more detail.\n\nHouseholds are allocating their higher savings to paying off debt\n\nHouseholds continued to deleverage in Q1 2023, reducing their debt by 7,866 million euros (–1.1%), placing it at 694,938 million. This amount represents 51.1% of GDP, 2 points less than in the previous quarter and the best figure since 2002. Due to the rise in interest rates, households continued the trend initiated in the second half of 2022 and used their pent-up savings to make net payments on their bank loans of 7,268 million euros: this is the most negative flow in Q1 since 2014, which contrasts with the net increase in lending in Q1 2022 (443 million) and exceeds the average for the same period in 2014-2019 (–4,956 million).\n\nAs for the households’ net acquisition of financial assets, in Q1 2023 it was negative (–5,468 million euros), something not seen in a first quarter since 2017. Essentially, households reduced their cash holdings (–1,442 million euros vs. –2,719 million on average in 2014-2019) and, above all, their bank deposits (–20,776 million vs. –941 million); on the other hand, they invested 9,534 million euros in debt securities and 9,518 million in equities and investment funds.\n\nThe negative acquisition of assets was largely offset by their strong appreciation (34,897 million euros), mainly due to improvements in the valuations of equities and investment fund holdings. Thus, the stock of households’ gross financial assets grew by 29,357 million euros to a total of 2.75 billion.\n\nWith regard to the composition of household financial wealth, we are witnessing a restructuring, as the relative weight of cash and deposits is reduced and instruments with a higher expected return, such as Treasury bills and investment funds, gain prominence. Thus, equities and investment funds accounted for 45.4% of households’ total financial assets, the highest percentage since 2017 (43.0% in 2014-2019), while the role of cash fell to an all-time low (2.0% vs. 3.1% before the pandemic). Insurance policies and pension funds, meanwhile, are making a timid recovery after a long decline, although they remain close to their lowest levels since 1999 (12.5%).\n\nAs a result of the increase in financial assets discussed above, together with the fall in total liabilities (–11,380 million euros), the net financial wealth of households has increased by over 40,736 million compared to the previous quarter, bringing the overall figure to just over\n\n2 trillion euros, a new all-time high.\n\nThe fact that, at the aggregate level, households are improving their equity position is not incompatible with the difficulties that some segments are experiencing, such as households with variable-interest-rate debts\n\nor those with lower incomes.\n\nCorporate debt, at a 20-year low\n\nThe net debt contracted by non-financial corporations (in consolidated terms) fell in the first three months of the year by 9,468 million euros, marking the biggest repayment in a first quarter since 2014 (–603 million in Q1 2022 and +2,121 million on average in 2014-2019). If we deduct a slight increase in the prices of fixed-income securities, along with other changes in volume, then the balance of consolidated corporate debt contracted by 8,116 million euros (–0.8%) to a total of 952,696 million;\n\nin terms of GDP, this is equivalent to 70%, the lowest ratio since Q3 2003.\n\nAs for corporations’ financial assets, they increased slightly in Q1, by just 7,181 million euros (up to 3.03 billion). This marks an improvement on the figure of a year earlier (–76,766 million), but it is well below the\n\n2014-2019 average (51,565 million). This increase in the asset balance is explained entirely by the significant appreciation in their value (37,600 million), especially in the case of equities and investment funds, since the net acquisition of assets was negative (–30,724 million), as has been frequently the case in the first quarter of recent years: firms reduced their assets held in the form of trade receivables, loans and, above all, cash and deposits."
