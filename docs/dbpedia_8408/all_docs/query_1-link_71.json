In 1952 the NBS was established. In 1956 NBS adopted the Material Product System (MPS) that was devised and used by the Soviet Union. Between 1985 and 1992, through a series of steps and arrangements, China transitioned from MPS to GDP, as the State Council of China (SCC) approved the establishment of a SNA (System of National Accounting using GDP to measure the national economy.\n\nGDP and spending - Gross domestic product (GDP) - OECD Data\n\nWorld Economic Outlook (April 2023) - IMF -International Monetary Fund\n\nGDP Methodology\n\nCurrency and magnitude\n\nAll GDP figures are expressed in US Dollar (US $, USD) and in single dollar units ($1=$1), not in thousands, millions, or billions.\n\nGlobal GDP\n\nWorld GDP (or \"Global GDP\" or \"GWP, Gross World Product\") is the combined GDP of all countries in the world. Global GDP is equivalent to Global GNI, or Global GNP, since all of these will provide the same result when combining all production worldwide.\n\nReal Global GDP\n\nThe chart for Global GDP vs. World Population uses Real GDP figures.\n\nGlobal GDP Growth\n\nAs with each individual country's GDP Growth Rate figures, it is calculated using inflation adjusted GDP (\"Real GDP\" or \"Constant Price GDP\") at 2015 prices.\n\nGDP Year\n\nGDP figures (nominal, real, growth rates) are based on the latest data released.\n\nPopulation Data\n\nThe United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs every two years calculates, updates, and publishes estimates of total population in its World Population Prospects series. These population estimates and projections provide the standard and consistent set of population figures that are used throughout the United Nations system.\n\nThe World Population Prospect: the 2022 Revision provides the most recent data available. Estimates and projected world population and country specific populations are given from 1950 through 2100 and are released every two years.\n\nData underlying the population estimates are national and sub national census data and data on births, deaths, and migrants available from national sources and publications, as well as from questionnaires. For all countries, census and registration data are evaluated and, if necessary, adjusted for incompleteness by the Population Division as part of its preparations of the official United Nations population estimates and projections."
