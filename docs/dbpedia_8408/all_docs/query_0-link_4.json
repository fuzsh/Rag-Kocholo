        "text": "GDP growth remains upbeat in Q1\n\nGDP growth surprised markets on the upside, expanding 0.7% on a seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter basis in Q1 2024 and following an upwardly revised 0.7% increase in the last quarter of 2023. On a seasonally adjusted year-on-year basis, economic growth dropped to 1.3% in Q1 from the previous period's 2.3% increase.\n\nOn the external front, exports of goods and services increased 2.4% on a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis in the first quarter, which followed Q4’s 2.8% expansion. Meanwhile, growth of imports of goods and services also cooled, coming in at 1.1% in Q1 (Q4: +2.4% s.a. qoq), increasing the positive impact of net trade. Domestically, household spending growth was stable at Q4’s 0.3% in Q1, marking the joint-weakest expansion since Q4 2022. Meanwhile, government consumption shrank 1.0% in Q1, swinging from Q4’s 1.0% rise. Lastly, fixed investment expanded 2.6% in Q1 (Q4: -1.6% s.a. qoq); investment in machinery and equipment and in real estate rebounded.\n\nThe pace of economic expansion will decelerate in 2024 from 2023 as domestic demand is constrained by the lagged effects of monetary tightening, waning savings and a less expansionary fiscal stance. That said, it will remain above the Eurozone average, supported by the disbursement of EU funds and stronger external demand. Higher-than-expected debt-servicing costs are a downside risk, while heightened political uncertainty is a factor to watch.\n\nCommenting on the outlook, EIU analysts stated: “Economic activity in Spain is set to slow but remain above the euro zone average in 2024, supported by declining inflationary pressures and strong wage growth on the back of a tight labour market. Economic growth will be held back by still-high interest rates and a subdued external environment, with US and global growth slowing considerably.”\n\nConsensus Forecasts and Projections for the next ten years\n\nHow should you choose a forecaster if some are too optimistic while others are too pessimistic? FocusEconomics collects Spanish GDP projections for the next ten years from a panel of 49 analysts at the leading national, regional and global forecast institutions. These projections are then validated by our in-house team of economists and data analysts and averaged to provide one Consensus Forecast you can rely on for each indicator. By averaging all forecasts, upside and downside forecasting errors tend to cancel each other out, leading to the most reliable GDP forecast available for Spanish GDP.\n\nDownload one of our sample reports to visualize what a Consensus Forecast is and see our Spanish GDP projections.\n\nWant to get access to the full dataset of Spanish GDP forecasts?
