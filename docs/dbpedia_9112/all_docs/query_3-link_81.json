        "text": "What makes a coin beautiful to you? I am pretty confident to say that most of us will answer, \"design\", among other factors. And that is a fact, the iconography of a coin plays a major role in its attractiveness when it comes to western coins. We will enjoy a coin for its original design or its refined and particularly detailed engraving. When confronted to chinese coins, we are often disoriented by what we think to be a total lack of design and originality. Indeed, our conception of numismatic art is almost exclusively based on the iconography (from the latin iconographia, ~\"drawing art\", coming itself from the greek Εἰϰονογραφία). Ancient coins might be seen as little pieces of ancient art, and some if not a large part of engravers were definitely trying to reach something more than just a formal design with their work. But I'm preaching to the choir here. On the other hand, calligraphy is not really the strong point of western coinage, inscriptions having a purely functional role.\n\nOne of the main features of ancient chinese coins is the absence of iconography. Since the birth of chinese coinage to the early 20th century only, chinese coins only had characters for themselves. Does that mean that people in China weren't seeking art in their coin production or that they couldn't come with anything artistic? I will not dwell on the particularity of the production (i.e. by casting coins in mass) that without a doubt contributed to the this absence of designs, but chinese coins are definitely more than just characters. There has been numismatists in China for a long time, and their interests were very different from the western collectors. This post will focus on the beautiful writing (literally) : calligraphy. I will speak about the main and more noticeable calligraphy styles used on coins.\n\nAlthough the interest in calligraphy in China traces back to the early antiquity, its importance on coinage really gained momentum during the reign of (the usurper) Wang Mang (9 - 23 AD). Before that, little to no attention was given to the calligraphy of spades and knives (most of them). On the same page, the calligraphy on Wu Zhu and Ban Liang was standardised the result of a simplification of the traditional seal script (small seal script).\n\nWang Mang, in his first monetary reforms, kept using the small seal script in use on the during the Han Dynasty, although the care brought to it was definitely more noticeable. However the former Han official was a nostalgic for the golden confucean era and quickly created a complex monetary system, reintroducing spades, knives and other fancy coin shapes that were discontinued for centuries. With this new coinage, he also gave the Great Seal script (大篆, Dàzhuàn) an elegant and refined revival, sometimes called \"suspended needles seal script\". This name is pretty self speaking (see fig. 2 below). However, Wang Mang reign was short-lived and his reform of coinage was quickly abandoned.\n\n1. Xin dynasty, Wang Mang (9-23 AD), 大泉五十 / Da Quan Wu Shi (27mm, 4.30g), large coin worth 50, small seal script.\n\n2. Xin dynasty, Wang Mang (9-23 AD), Huo Bu, spade of 25 (57x22mm, 17.20g), great seal script.\n\nThe centuries following Wang Mang's death saw a lot of political changes and marked an era of division and chaos for chinese coinage. Coinage was overall very poor in terms of workmanship and diversity. Most of the coins in circulation at a given moment were Wu Zhu : old coins, chiselled ones, private cast, reduced coins... Some kingdoms and dynasties tried to reintroduce the great seal script alongside coins of higher quality, but this was eventually a roller-coaster and all these initiatives didn't last long. The poor Wu Zhu were always coming back. I will share one of the finest uses of the great seal scripts of this period, for the sake of it, but it's not from my collection (unfortunately).\n\n3. Northern Zhou, anonymous (557-581 AD), Yong Tong Wan Guo / 永通萬國 (580-581 AD), \"jade sticks\" seal script. Picture : SARC.\n\nWith the durable unification of China under the rule of the Tang dynasty, from the 7th century to the 10th century, the Lishu script became the new dominant script on coins. This was originally the one used by merchants and civil servants on a daily basis. This is a more angular script, easier to write, with regular and almost straight strokes. This straightforward and clear script was perfect for one of the most important and durable reforms of coinage China had ever seen : the introduction of a new coin, the Kai Yuan Tong Bao (but I won't discuss the Tang coinage here in detail).\n\n4. Tang dynasty, Su Zong (756-762 AD), 乾元重寶 /Qian Yuan zhong bao, 10 wen (30mm ; 7.25g)\n\nHowever, the turning point of calligraphy on chinese coins really was the Northern Song dynasty (960 - 1127 AD). You have to see this period as the equivalent to the european Renaissance. Culture was florishing, the interest in art and history was growing, and calligraphy was one of the more popular arts alongside poetry and painting. Being a talented calligrapher could get you as much recognition a great sculptor could have in ancient Greece. The first important calligraphy style used was the kaishu, or regular script. Albeit similar to the lishu, from which he was inspired, the regular script is based on what a painting brush would create : it's less angular, and a single stroke should not be even in terms of thickness (fig. 5).\n\nBut the Song wouldn't stop there. One style wasn't enough. They soon introduced a great variety of calligraphy style in their coins, often issuing a single type in two or three different styles, declining the era names in various aesthetics. The running script was born during the Han dynasty but was only used on coins during the Song (fig. 6). It is a more natural, quick way of writing characters following the kaishu script, reducing the straight lines and allowing different strokes to merge. Another style in use, and this is probably my favourite, was the grass style. It was also a centuries-old style mastered by the Song. It goes one step further than the running script : straight lines are almost non-existent, components of the characters are ommitted, reducing the character to a fluid movement, in an almost abstract way (fig. 7). Notice how each character change from one style to another.\n\n5. Northern Song, Tai Zong (976-997), 至道元寶 / Zhi Dao yuan bao (995-997), 1 wen, regular script.\n\n6. Northern Song, Tai Zong (976-997), 至道元寶 / Zhi Dao yuan bao (995-997), 1 wen, running script.\n\n7. Northern Song, Tai Zong (976-997), 至道元寶 / Zhi Dao yuan bao (995-997), 1 wen, grass script.\n\nThe Song also did not fail to use the classic seal script (fig. 8.) on a fair amount of types. The very special nine fold seal script was also used on some coins of Ren Zong (fig. 9). This script was the one actually used on official seals and for daoist fulu talisman. The nine fold is a very intricate, ornate and complicated version of the traditional seal script. You can see how every character has multiple folds and layers, compared to the usual seal script. There is only one type of coin with this script, only known to a handful of examples, and it was probably not meant for circulation.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle of calligraphic artistry was probably reached during the reign of Hui Zong (1101-1125). Hui Zong himself was a famous painter, poet and calligrapher. The large coins bearing the era names Chong Ning exist in a peculiar script called slender gold script (fig. 10). This script, whose base is the kaishu script, is said to be from the hand of the emperor Hui Zong himself. The fact that these coins initially valued at 10 cash are large (~34mm) allow a great display of this particularly fine and elegant calligraphy style. I won't share my own specimen here because it's in particularly bad shape and I've yet to upgrade it, but these coins are hopefully very common and affordable. This was not the first time an emperor was involved in the calligraphy process of a coin type, and history records attribute a few other coin types to the hand of a given emperor.\n\n8. Northern Song, Ren Zong (1022-1063), Ming Dao yuan bao / 明道元寶 (1032-1033), seal script.\n\n9. Northern Song, Ren Zong (1022-1063), Huang Song tong bao / 皇宋通寶 (1039-1054), nine folded seal script, later cast charm (weight: 7 grams).\n\n10. Northern Song, Hui Zong (1101-1125), Chong Ning tong bao (1102-1106), 10 wen, slender gold script. Picture : Ira and Larry Goldberg."
