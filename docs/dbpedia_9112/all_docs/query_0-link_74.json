        "text": "Before the Tuoba chieftains established themselves as rulers in a Chinese-style administration system, the politics of permanent warfare against the northern non-Chinese states of Xia, Beiyan and Beiliang made it necessary to rob and plunder objects the nomad aristocracy needed. This robbing campains for a long time was the base of Northern Wei economy, supplying the ruling class with grain and food, cattle and horses, gold and money, but also with workforce like peasants, craftsmen, officials. Often, peasant households consituted presents and rewards of the political and military rulers for the chieftains (youzhang é é·; babu dafu å «é¨å¤§å¤«) of their tribal alliances. The Tuoba rulers installed special officials (dianshi å ¸å¸«) to control the conquered farms.\n\nAfter occupying a considerable part of northern China, the alliance of nomad tribes (buluo é¨è½) was dissolved and the former warrior aristocracy was encouraged to settle down and to engage in agricultural acitivites. The main reason for this new civil politics were the fact that after more than 200 years of war, the economy of northern China totally languished. Landless people wandered around in the search for food and new employment after escaping war, famine, natural desasters, heavy tax burdens or cruel landowners. The former nomads now settling down and gradually becoming Chinese now needed a supply for their administration, the state urgently looked for higher tax revenues. As a first measure of a new administration system, members of the Tuoba and Non-Tuoba (Wuhuan çä¸¸) aristocracy were installed as governors (zongdang å®é»¨) over local territory. After Emperor Tuoba Gui æè·çª (Emperor Daowudi éæ­¦å¸) had shifted the capital to Pingcheng å¹³å (modern Taiyuan/Shanxi) in 398 and started to make use of the traditional Chinese adminstration rules and customs (like official system, administration structure, state rites, standardizing measures and weights, introducing a state calendar, founding a state academy with Confucian education, forcing the Tuoba people to \"knot their hair and wear Chinese hats\" shufa jiamao æé«®å å¸½), first measures were undertaken to set up household registers (huji æ¶ç±) and to allot parts of land to private peasants in the area around the capital (jingji äº¬ç¿). But the most part of agriculturable land in north China was cultivated in the form of state-operated military agro-colonies (tuntian å±¯ç°) or not tilled at all and instead used as pasture land (muchang ç§å ´). For the next seven decades, the economic system of Northern Wei was a combination of robbing, agrarian colonies, pasturing and normal field cultivation. The aristocracy and large landowners (zongzhu å®ä¸») were installed as overseers (duhu ç£è­·) and patrons of the peasantry. To escape corvÃ©e labour and tax paying, too many peasants sought be employed by the gentry. The number of state-owned private peasant households (bianhu ç·¨æ¶) was far outweighted by the number of households secretly belonging (thus called yinhu é±æ¶) as clients to the household of magnates. Not enough free peasants meant also a low grain production and few regular tax payers. Furthermore, the officialdom of the early Northern Wei period was not educated enough to run an effective government, and too many separate \"kingdoms\" of large estate owners existed that were quasi independent from the central government.\n\nUnder the reign of Xiaowendi å­æå¸ who moved the capital to Luoyang, two officials named Li Anshi æå®ä¸ and Li Chong æè¡ proposed the introduction of the equal-field system (juntianfa åç°æ³ or juntianzhi åç°å¶). Every person, even slaves, were granted a fixed size of land that they had to cultivate lifelong. A certain part was destinated as field for grain (lutian é²ç°), the rest (sangtian æ¡ç°) for the cultivation of mulberry trees or hemp. Officials were likewise given a certain amount of land that was bound to the office, not to the person. Selling the land was prohibited. It was therefore necessary to set up accurate household and land registers. Except tax in grain, the peasants had to deliver tax in kind (silk, materials) according to their age and gender, and in corvÃ©e labour; this tax system was called zudiaofa ç§èª¿æ³. The magnates as administratorial overseers of the population were replaced with officials in three categories (sanzhangzhi ä¸é·å¶), five families constituting a neighbourhood (lin é°), five neighbourhoods a hamlet (li é), and five hamlets a commune (dang é»¨). The direct positive result of these measures were a larger tax and tribute revenue for the state, a tighter control of the peasant households, a consolidation of the central state power and of the social structures in vertical and horizontal direction, the integration of Tuoba and other Non-Chinese into the Chinese majority, a recovery of the whole economy after centuries of warfare and calamities, and finally an institutional base for the economic system of the Sui and Tang Dynasties.\n\nBesides agriculture, great measures were undertaken to recover old canals and dykes, to revitalize trade and commerce, the production of state-monopoly goods like iron, salt and silk. The capital Luoyang was supplied by three large markets. While silk (juanbo çµ¹å¸) was still a common currency, the three-pence coin (sanzhuqian ä¸éé¢) was introduced in 495. There was an intensive trade between north and south China, and with the western territories.\n\nBut like in earlier and later centuries too, the general tendency of peasants to engage as tenant farmers to escape tax and corvÃ©e also prevailed during the later part of the Northern Wei Dynasty. The vicious circle of the heavy tax burden of the free peasants should never be defeatable: free peasants left or sold their soil and became tenant farmers, the rest of the free peasants therefore had to pay even higher taxes, and again people sold their land to magnates. With the rise of Buddhism as state religion, monasteries played an important role as employers of tenant farmers on the large lands that believers had granted the monastery. From 574 on, several state campaigns against Buddhist monasteries occurred - not because of religious motives, but to gain back official land and taxable peasants.\n\nSource:\n\nOctober 30, 2011 © Ulrich Theobald · Mail"
