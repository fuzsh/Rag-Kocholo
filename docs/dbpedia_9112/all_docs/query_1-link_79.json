        "text": "Travel The Silk Road With Actual Coins That Circulated Along The Historic Ancient Highway\n\nWhen one thinks of the famous Silk Road, exciting scenes of merchant caravans lurching across barren roads and treacherous mountain trails instantly come to mind. While those images are indeed based on fact, the Silk Road wasn’t just one long winding path; it was actually a series of routes connecting China and the Far East to the Middle East and Europe. In fact, one might even say the Silk Road was the ancient world’s version of the internet serving as a way of exchanging not just commerce, but culture, religion, and customs between unique civilizations.\n\nMost historians agree the Silk Road was first “open for business” between China and the west several centuries before Jesus Christ walked the earth and was named for the fabulous silks China was exporting to new trading partners in the West. The routes would remain in use for hundreds of years until the Ottoman Empire decided to boycott China in 1453 and closed the routes. Its fame has endured thanks to the tales told by Italian merchant and adventurer Marco Polo.\n\nThe Most Important Chapters Of The Silk Road\n\nThis eclectic eight-piece set features coins that were struck between around 400 BC to AD 1300. This period of time covers the most important chapters of the Silk Road which saw trade goods like silk, spices, wool, and porcelain traveling back and forth across international routes. The designs feature various imagery from all across continental Eurasia. Chinese, Indian, and Middle Eastern themes are distinctly present on each coin. Chinese coins have the iconic square-shaped void that makes them uniquely identifiable. Indian coins have a flavor of their own and feature the standing king. Finally, the Muslim coins from the Middle East typically employ stylized Arabic characters since Islam forbade the representation of humans or animals on sacred art. The coins include:\n\nChina Cash Coin of the Qin/Western Dynasty 4th–2nd Centuries BC.\n\nChina Cash Coin of the Xin Dynasty, Wang Mang AD 7–23\n\nNarwar, kakini fraction, Nagas of Narwar AD 3rd–4th Centuries\n\nBactria, jital, Hindu Shahi AD 9th–11th Centuries\n\nIndia, massa, Chola Dynasty AD 10th–11th Centuries\n\nKashmir, stater, Ancient India, AD 10th–12th Centuries\n\nSri Lanka, massa, Kandy Kings, AD 11th–13th Centuries\n\nMamluk Dynasty, fals, “Slave Kings” AD 13th Centuries\n\nEach coin will come in a protective acrylic holder and the entire set will come housed in a custom presentation case and accompanied by an informative storycard and a Certificate of Authenticity for the American Numismatic Association (ANA).\n\nRemnants Of A Long-Gone Era\n\nCoins drove the economy, and a standardization of world coins helped to facilitate trade across the supercontinent of Eurasia. Although these coins vary in design and origin, they are shockingly similar. These coins may be a remnant of a long-gone era, but history repeats itself. Just as we saw Emperor Wu recognize the potential and develop the Silk Road over 2000 years ago, so too we are seeing China’s Xi Jinping expand the once-bustling networks that connected China to the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Don’t get left on the side of the road, add this historic 400 BC–AD 1300 Coins of the Silk Road Eight-Piece Set to your collection today!"
