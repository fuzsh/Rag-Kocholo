        "text": "Wang Mang (46 BC — 23AD), courtesy name Jujun, was one of the most controversial emperors in Chinese history.\n\n​\n\nThrough his talent and a decent reputation, and with support from a large number of nobles, officials, and civilians, Wang Mang obtained power as a regent and then ended the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC — 9 AD) and established a new empire, the Xin Dynasty (9 AD — 23 AD).\n\n​\n\nWithin 15 years of his reign, however, he displeased the ruling class and civilians because of his radical reforms that jeopardized their interests.\n\n​\n\nAs an emperor who valued the lives of his sons and slaves equally and showed no interest in luxury lifestyle or money, Wang Mang's obtaining the throne was more for his idealistic and political ambitions.\n\n​\n\nAfter several attempts, Emperor Wang Mang failed, caused nationwide rebellions, and was assassinated tragically. Royals collected his skull for the next two centuries until it was burnt out in an accident.\n\nA Frugal Noble with a Reputation for Benevolence\n\n​\n\nWang Mang was a cousin of Emperor Liu Ao, which meant that he came from the most potent clan at that time, the house of the current empress dowager.\n\n​\n\nWang Mang’s father and big brother passed away when he was little, so he was raised by his influential uncles.\n\n​\n\nAs a talented young man from the strongest clan, Wang Mang was brilliant, modest, kind, and frugal; meanwhile, he spent most of his money helping people in poverty.\n\nGradually, his gracious reputation and talent earned him the support of many officials and the respect of civilians.\n\nIn addition to the noble title that his father left him, Wang Mang became more and more influential in politics.\n\n​\n\nAfter Emperor Liu Ao departed without a son, his nephew inherited the throne and passed away seven years later.\n\n​\n\nSince then, Wang Mang and his clan became even more powerful and supported two kid emperors in a row.\n\nThe Reputable Regent Wang Mang\n\n​\n\nDuring that period, Wang Mang was quite a great regent that gained almost everyone’s respect.\n\n​\n\nHe suggested that the empress dowager command all the aristocrats to live a frugal life.\n\nHe collected a great deal of money to give to people suffering from natural disasters or poverty.\n\n​\n\nBesides, he led many aristocrats to donate lands and built tens of thousands of free houses for civilians who lost their homes in natural disasters.\n\n​\n\nHe also highly respected intellectuals and had never connived crimes of his clan.\n\nWhen the emperor rewarded Wang Mang, he only accepted titles but refused all the land and money.\n\n​\n\nLater, many scholars and scientists were summoned to the capital city to teach and disseminate their knowledge, and each was rewarded with a fine, free house.\n\n​\n\nThose caring and kind policies that Regent Wang Mang had implemented brought him increased support and respect dramatically from both the ruling class and the civilians.\n\nUsurping the Throne and Establishing A New Dynasty\n\n​\n\nSoon, the first emperor that Wang Mang supported passed away, and then Wang Mang enthroned a 2-year-old child as the crown prince while he became the regent emperor.\n\n​\n\nThis made the royal Liu clan quite furious, and they started to fight.\n\n​\n\nWang Mang defeated all the forces of the House of Liu that had fought against him.\n\nThen, he announced himself as emperor and established a new Dynasty named Xin, with support from many officials and civilians.\n\nThen Emperor Wang Mang implemented a series of reform policies, frequently considered radical in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nHe was sometimes considered a time traveler because many of his policies resembled those utilized in recent decades in China.\n\n​\n\nIt felt like a Chinese born in the 1980s and then traveled to the Han Dynasty and applied all the policies from the era in which he lived.\n\n​\n\nBesides, he loved scientific experiments and inventions. Wang Mang even performed a post-mortem examination to persuade people to stop believing in superstitions.\n\nAn Impartial Judicial Executor Who Executed His Sons\n\n​\n\nWang Mang believed that human lives were equally honorable and important.\n\n​\n\nThis was not just a slogan used to impress people or show justice but a principle he implemented.\n\n​\n\nHis second son killed a slave purchased long ago, so Wang Mang forced him to commit suicide for this crime after it was found out.\n\nTwo of his other sons were also forced to death after they sinned.\n\nThe Failure of Emperor Wang Mang and His Cruel Demise\n\n​\n\nAfter all of his followers were sacrificed in battles, Wang Mang was assassinated in chaotic fights.\n\nHis body was cut into several pieces after his death, and his skull was preserved in the royal for the next 200 years.\n\n​\n\nSoon, Liu Xiu, an intelligent and brave person from the former royal Liu Clan, re-established the Han Dynasty.\n\n​\n\nEmperor Wang Mang had long been criticized and despised in the history of China for his radical reforms and the way he got the throne.\n\n​\n\nHe was pretty intelligent and frugal throughout his life; as a noble-born from a powerful and wealthy clan, he had rarely lived like a rich person.\n\n​\n\nAlso, he was an outstanding politician and a sly opportunist obsessed with power.\n\nAfter Wang Mang obtained the throne and achieved centralized power, he kept working diligently and barely enjoyed life.\n\nAll he had done were try to make a change, take care of the disadvantaged groups, and decrease the gap between the rich and poor.\n\n​\n\nObjectively speaking, his reform policies were not based on reality, especially while so many changes were squeezed into such a limited period; also, he scarcely used the right people to help him realize his political ambition.\n\n​\n\nBesides, the constant natural disasters, civilians’ miserable living standards, and rebellions from the former royal clan Liu and other forces made his failure not entirely surprising.\n\n​\n\nHowever, Emperor Wang Mang was still an aspiring, brave, controversial reformist in the history of China, though he failed, and an ambitious idealist with a big dream."
