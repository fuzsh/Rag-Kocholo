        "text": "capital of the Republic of Cyprus and Nicosia District, and also capital of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Lefkosa District. Greeks call the city Levkosía, and Turks call it Lefkosa. The city lies in the north-central part of Cyprus on the Pedieos River. It is the chief trading center for the surrounding agriculturally rich region.\n\nThe 16th-century Venetian Walls encircle the old section of the city. Despite the fortifications, the city was invaded by the Genoese in 1372, the Mamelukes in 1426, and the Turks in 1570. Eleftheria Square occupies the center of the city. The most famous among the city’s landmark buildings is the Cathedral of St. Sophia. Construction of the cathedral started in 1209. It was finished in 1325, only to be pillaged repeatedly by invaders. Turks converted the cathedral into the chief mosque of Cyprus in 1571. In 1954 it became known as the Selimiye Mosque. The Cyprus Museum houses many archaeological treasures, some dating from about 5800 bc, in the Neolithic period. The Folk Art Museum has displays of embroidery, clothing, handcrafted furniture, and farm tools. Other points of interest include the Makarios Center, the Nicosia Municipal Theater, the Cathedral of St. John, and the Presidential Palace. The annual Nicosia Art Festival is sponsored by the government and is held in the summer.\n\nGood roads connect Nicosia with cities throughout the country. An international airport is located 21 miles (34 kilometers) away, near the city of Larnaca. Educational institutions include the ISS International School (1987), The English Grammar School, the American International School, and several institutions for technical and vocational training. The University of Nicosia opened in 1992 in the Greek Cypriot area. Nicosia is also the archiepiscopal seat of the Autonomous Church of Cyprus. The Autonomous Church of Cyprus has the right to elect its own archbishops and bishops.\n\nNicosia’s economy is based on agriculture, small-scale industries, and tourism. The chief agricultural products are olives, fruits, vegetables, almonds, wheat, and barley. The manufacturing sector serves mainly the local market and includes machine tools, footwear, plastic and food products, soft drinks, cigarettes, ceramics, leather goods, bricks, confectionery, and textiles. Because Cyprus offers attractive tax incentives, several multinational and foreign companies have located their headquarters in Nicosia.\n\nKnown as Ledra in ancient times, Nicosia has a history that blends Eastern and Western influences. It first became the capital of Cyprus in 1192 during the Third Crusade when the French Crusader Guy of Lusigna was awarded the island of Cyprus. It has been a bishopric since the 4th century. Nicosia was successively ruled by the Byzantines (330–1191), the Lusignan kings (1192–1489), the Venetians (1489–1571), and the Turks (1571–1878). The British took over in 1878 at the end of the Russo-Turkish War. When in 1925 Cyprus became a British crown colony, Nicosia once again became the official capital, and continued to be as such at the time of independence of Cyprus in 1960. The city has been severely damaged by earthquakes several times. A serious outbreak of cholera in 1835 greatly reduced its population; the city also withstood a fire in 1857.\n\nThe Turkish invasion of 1974 left part of the city under the United Nations Forces in Cyprus operational boundary. This buffer zone (a so-called UN Green Line), which was established in 1974 to keep peace, divides Nicosia into the Greek Cypriot area in the south and the Turkish Cypriot area in the north. Tourists can travel between these two sectors with relative ease as long as they follow certain protocols. During the Turkish invasion, Nicosia’s population swelled as an estimated 35,000 Greek Cypriot refugees fled from the Turkish dominated northern part of Cyprus.\n\nIn 1995 Nicosia’s name was officially changed to Lefkosia in the Greek-dominated Republic of Cyprus as the new name sounds much closer to its Greek pronunciation."
