        "text": "World Facts Index\n\nA former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish-held area declared itself the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (TRNC), but it is recognized only by Turkey. The latest two-year round of UN-brokered talks - between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reach an agreement to reunite the divided island - ended when the Greek Cypriots rejected the UN settlement plan in an April 2004 referendum. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under direct government control, and is suspended in the areas administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states. The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both the Turkish and Cypriot Governments to reopen unification negotiations.\n\nGeography of Cyprus\n\nLocation:\n\nMiddle East, island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey\n\nCoordinates:\n\n35 00 N, 33 00 E\n\nMap references:\n\nMiddle East\n\nArea:\n\ntotal: 9,250 sq km (of which 3,355 sq km are in the Turkish Cypriot area)\n\nwater: 10 sq km\n\nland: 9,240 sq km\n\nArea comparative:\n\nabout 0.6 times the size of Connecticut\n\nLand boundaries:\n\n0 km\n\nCoastline:\n\n648 km\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nterritorial sea: 12 NM\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate:\n\ntemperate;

on 15 November 1983 Turkish Cypriot \"President\" Rauf DENKTASH declared independence and the formation of a \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (TRNC), recognized only by Turkey; both sides publicly support a settlement based on a federation (Greek Cypriot position) or confederation (Turkish Cypriot position)\n\nCapital:\n\nNicosia\n\nAdministrative divisions:\n\n6 districts;

Tourism, financial services, and real estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, which often fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area under government control grew by an average of 3.6% per year during the period of 2000-06, well above the EU average. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the preceeding years, aimed at paving the way for the euro, helped turn a soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.5% in 2007. As in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots, water shortages are a perennial problem; a few desalination plants are now on line. After 10 years of drought, the country received substantial rainfall from 2001-04 alleviating immediate concerns. Rainfall in 2005 and 2006, however, was well below average, making water rationing a necessity in 2007.\n\nGDP:\n\n$21.4 billion (2007 est.)\n\nGDP growth rate:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: 3.8%; north Cyprus: 10.6%\n\nGDP per capita:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: $21,500; north Cyprus: $7,135\n\nGDP composition by sector:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: agriculture 3.7%; industry 19.8%; services 76.5%\n\nnorth Cyprus: agriculture 10.6%; industry 20.5%; services 68.9%\n\nInflation rate:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: 2.6%; north Cyprus: 9.1%\n\nLabor force:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: 370,000, north Cyprus: 95,025\n\nLabor force - by occupation:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: agriculture 7.4%, industry 38.2%, services 54.4%; north Cyprus: agriculture 14.5%, industry 29%, services 56.5%\n\nUnemployment:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: 4%; north Cyprus: 5.6%\n\nBudget:\n\nrevenues: Republic of Cyprus - $6.698 billion\n\nexpenditures: Republic of Cyprus - $7.122 billion\n\nrevenues: north Cyprus - $231.3 million\n\nexpenditures: north Cyprus - $432.8 million\n\nElectricity production by source:\n\nfossil fuel: 100%\n\nother: 0%\n\nhydro: 0%\n\nIndustries:\n\ntourism, food and beverage processing, cement and gypsum production, ship repair and refurbishment, textiles, light chemicals, metal products, wood, paper, stone, and clay products\n\nAgriculture:\n\npotatoes, citrus, vegetables, barley, grapes, olives, vegetables, poultry, pork, lamb, kids, dairy\n\nExports:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: citrus, potatoes, pharmaceuticals, cement, clothing and cigarettes; north Cyprus: citrus, potatoes, textiles\n\nImports:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: consumer goods, petroleum and lubricants, intermediate goods, machinery, transport equipment; north Cyprus: vehicles, fuel, cigarettes, food, minerals, chemicals, machinery\n\nCurrency:\n\nRepublic of Cyprus: Cypriot pound (CYP); Turkish Cypriot area: Turkish New lira (YTL)\n\nSOURCES: The CIA World Factbook, U.S. Department of State, Area Handbook of the US Library of Congress"
