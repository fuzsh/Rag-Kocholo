        "text": "JOIN US IN AN INTERVIEW WITH GALATIA SAVVA FROM NICOSIA, CYPRUS!\n\nTia is a Greek Cypriot travel blogger as well as a dancer/choreographer. Her biggest passion is traveling far and wide to exotic destinations. She is always on the lookout for affordable luxury and places to spoil yourself without breaking the bank. Tia has danced in the pouring rain in China, chased sharks in Belize, got lost in NYC, climbed mountains in Costa Rica, and bathed elephants in Thailand. She has eaten her way through Italy and Dubai, found Nemo in Egypt, beach hopped the Greek Islands and stood in awe at the waterfalls in Bali. She believes that life is way too short to only learn one culture, food or language and her ultimate goal is to see as much of the world as she possibly can for as long as her legs can carry her! Her website inspires wanderlust and provides detailed ultimate guides to various Destinations.\n\nNICOSIA\n\nNicosia, or Lefkosia is the largest city and the capital of Cyprus which as of 2004 is a member of the European Union. It is also the only city on the island that is not surrounded by sea. An established international business centre and the financial capital, it is the 32nd richest city in the world in relative purchasing power. What is lacking in seaside beauty it’s making up for with rich diverse culture, beautiful architecture and of course the unique fact that it is the last remaining divided capital city on earth.\n\nWhich is the best time to visit Nicosia?\n\nNicosia and Cyprus in general are great to visit anytime of the year due to our long, hot summers and mild short winters. We only get about a month of spring before it turns to full on sunshine! With Nicosia being the capital of Cyprus and the only city not surrounded by sea, it can get extremely hot, which is why visitors tend to prefer traveling to Nicosia in the months of October- December and March-April-May. Those months are still warm but not boiling hot and one can still enjoy walking around for hours without being too uncomfortable.\n\nSummer: Temperatures in the summer (starting from April and lasting through to October) vary from 25-45 Celsius during the day and warm and humid evenings that never go below 25 degrees. Rainfall is rare during these months.\n\nWinter: (November to February) vary from 11-16 Celsius with the nights being cold and crisp and going as low as 6 degrees Celsius. Rainfall – 3-11 days of the month.\n\nSpring: March is our official spring month, with slightly crisp but sunny days. Temperatures range from 16-19 and rainfall occurs for approximately 7-10 days of the month.\n\nWhich is the most convenient and favoured transport of Nicosia?\n\nThere is no Metro either over ground or underground in Cyprus.

The carnivals capital is without a doubt the neighboring city of Limassol but Nicosia also hosts its own Carnival event – The Aglantzia Carnival and the Limassol Carnival.\n\nWhat is the most loved local food, savory and sweet of Nicosia?\n\nGreek and Cypriot food is one of the most celebrated and loved cuisines in the world! There is so much to be enjoyed from home style dishes like mousaka and koupepia (vine leaves stuffed with mince meat, rice and herbs) to Greek Salads, Souvla (chicken,pork or lamb large meat pieces cooked in skewers on coals) kleftiko (an old traditional dish or pork and potatoes wrapped in foil and cooked in an old style clay oven for a minimum of 6 hours) pourgouri (bulgar wheat cooked with onions and tomatoes), fried eggs and zuccini, sheftalies (spiced mince meat wrapped in Panna and cooked on hot coals) Cyprus kebab and dozens more!\n\nTraditional desserts are also plentiful and share similarities with Eastern European Countries such as baklava, Pourekia, Machallepi and many more. In fact there is so much to try it can get quite overwhelming.\n\nThat’s why the most local loved food and my personal favorite is the almighty ‘’Mezedes’’.\n\nMezedes in Cyprus is an experience not to be missed. 40+ ‘’small’’ and mouthwatering dishes of all the plates I have mentioned above and then some. Doesn’t get much better than that! Over half of those dishes are involving meat. Vegetarians can opt for ‘’Fish Meze’’ – which involves only fish and no meat. Fish meze can be found in different taverns – If a menu offers both fish and meat meze it is not usually any good and certainly not authentic.\n\nTip: Due to the huge amounts of food, Mezedes is best enjoyed at a slow pace. Allow a minimum of 2 hours for dinner and arrive hungry as a bear! Prices are Aproximately 20-25 euros per person and you do not even need to order- just say the magic word ‘’mezedes’’ and watch them go to work!\n\nMeat Meze Restaurant Recommendation: Zanettos Traditional Tavern\n\nFish Meze Recommendations : Paragadi Fish Restaurant\n\nIs Nicosia a vegetarian friendly city?\n\nCyprus is a meat loving country.
