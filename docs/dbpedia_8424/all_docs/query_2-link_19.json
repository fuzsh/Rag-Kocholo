        "text": "“Nicosia is the centrally located capital of Cyprus and the largest in population city of the island. The city now sprawls for several kilometers and has engulfed surrounding villages and settlements. Its population hovers around 250,000 (a third of the total population of Cyprus) but the city has a feel of one much larger. It is the administrative and financial hub of the island as well as home to several universities, colleges and other educational establishments. It also hosts most foreign embassies and offshore companies (a big industry in Cyprus nowadays). Along with its international students and foreign workers it has developed a truly cosmopolitan feel.\n\n“Nicosia [(Greek), Lefkosa (Turkish)] is the world’s last divided capital. The barbed wire and guard towers of the Green Line cuts the city in two, with the northern side being the capital of Northern Cyprus [formally named “The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” and internationally recognized by only one country – Turkey] and the southern half being the capital of the Republic of Cyprus. [See our upcoming blog post, “The ‘Green Line’ in Divided Nicosia, Cyprus” describing our visit to the Ledra Street Crossing Point (checkpoint),]\n\n“Politics aside, Nicosia is a little short on both the archaeological treasure troves and beaches with pulsating nightlife that bring most visitors to Cyprus. But the Old City with its museums and churches is pleasant enough, and precisely due to the comparative lack of tourists, the city retains more of an authentically Cypriot air than the resorts of the southern coast. Fantastic little cafes invite you in for a Cypriot coffee, so just walk around and see the many woodworking shops that are deep within the City, and take a walk down to the Green Line, the boundary that now divides North from South. Being the financial and administrative centre of the island, it is one of the best places for shopaholics.” — https://wikitravel.org/en/Nicosia\n\n“Archbishop’s Palace is the official residence and office of the archbishop of Cyprus located in Nicosia. The palace was built next to the “Old Archbishop’s Palace”, between 1956 and 1960; in neo-Byzantine architectural style. Its general plans were designed by George Nomikos in Athens, while Nicholas S. Roussos and John Pericleous from Limassol were responsible for all other architectural work. The bronze sculpture of Makarios III, the first president of Cyprus, was on its grounds but has now been moved the monastery of Kykkos. It was sculpted by Nikolas Kotziamannis, weighs around 13 tons and is approximately 30 feet tall. Although the Archbishop’s Palace is not open to the public; the Byzantine Museum, Library of the Archbishopric, Folk Art Museum and the National Struggle Museum located on its grounds are open to the public.” — https://travel.sygic.com"
