        "text": "Nicosia, also known as Lefkosia, is a wondrous world of vibrant culture, perfectly located in the heart of The Island of Cyprus. The capital and largest city of Cyprus has so much to offer to visitors from all over the globe.\n\nThe city has a vast history dating back to the bronze age, with evidence of settlements on the city walls dating back to 2000 BC. Throughout its many centuries of existence, Nicosia has been occupied and ruled by a number of different empires, including the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire. This rich history has left Nicosia with a wealth of cultural heritage, making it one of the most unique cities in the world.\n\nNicosia is a bustling city with something for everyone. The old town is full of cobblestone streets, authentic restaurants, and bustling markets that come alive with the sound of music in the evening. Visitors can explore a variety of historical sites, such as the Venetian Walls and Laiki Yitonia – an old neighborhood that still retains its traditional Cypriot architecture.\n\nThe city also offers a number of cultural activities and events, from theater performances to art galleries. Nicosia is home to the Cyprus Theatre Organisation and the Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre, which both host a variety of performances throughout the year. There is also an abundance of excellent restaurants, cafes, and bars that serve up a range of international cuisines.\n\nThe city’s location is perfect for day trips to other parts of the island, such as Troodos Mountains or the beaches in Ayia Napa. Nicosia is also well connected with the other major cities in Cyprus, making it a great base for exploring the whole island.\n\nOverall, Nicosia is a vibrant and unique city with a wealth of culture and history, making it the perfect destination for anyone looking to explore the Island of Cyprus.\n\nNicosia has been occupied by many groups throughout the years and it is still considered as The Island of Cyprus’s most ethnically diverse city.\n\nNicosia was settled in around 1500 BC by Myceneans, Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans. Nicosia became a part of the Roman Empire in 58BC when Cyprus was annexed to Rome. Nicosia served as an important cultural center during its 2000 year history which includes the Byzantine period (330-1190AD); Venetian rule 1190-1571AD); Ottoman Period (1571 ad–1878ad) and the British rule (1878 – 1960). The city has been ruined by conquest, fires, and earthquakes over its history.\n\nNicosia became the capital of Cyprus during the Byzantine Empire because of its location. Being away from the coast which was often raided, Nicosia’s location offered physical protection. It remained so until today.\n\nAs a result of the many conquerors who have passed through, the city of Nicosia and the surrounding area has an amazing diversity of historical monuments.\n\nThe city is now home to the Presidents of The Republic of Cyprus and The Greek Cypriot Administration. During the Turkish invasion in 1974, part of the city was captured by the Turkish troops, and the city was split into two parts, as a result of the war. Nicosia is now the last divided capital in Europe.\n\nNicosia is the only divided capital city in the world. The UN Buffer Zone splits Nicosia into two halves. A no-man’s land divides Nicosia from North to South. In 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus which led to an occupation of the northern part of the island of Cyprus. As a result, buffer zones have been created between each side which is used to enforce peace agreements, with soldiers patrolling them day and night. Nicosians have grown accustomed to this new lifestyle where they can see their neighbors living on the other side through bulletproof glass or at a distance.\n\nit wasn’t until recently that the barricades opened to allow people to cross to the other side. The ceasefire has been in place for almost 40 years, but The Cyprus Problem is still not resolved. Nevertheless, the Nicosian people are very resilient and are always open to meeting someone from the other side for coffee or lunch!"
