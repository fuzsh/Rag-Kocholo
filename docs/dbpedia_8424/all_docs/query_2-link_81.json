        "text": "Relocating to Nicosia\n\nAbout the City\n\nNicosia is the capital and largest city in Cyprus. Located on the banks of the Pedieos River and the border between Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus, the city has been divided into two parts since 1963, each a part of one country. However, since 2008 some of the roads connecting the two sections of the city have been reopened, in order to establish a dialogue between the two states.\n\nThe overall population of Nicosia is nearly 300,000 people (as of 2015), but this is split between the southern and northern sections of the city, with the southern section far more populous than the north. Although the main languages spoken are Greek, in a Cypriot dialect, or Turkish, depending on which section of the city you are in, it is estimated that around 90% of the population speak some English, and fluency is common amongst the younger generations.\n\nThe Climate in Nicosia\n\nExpatriates moving to Nicosia from colder countries may take some time to adjust to the climate. Due to its extreme southern location in Europe, Nicosia has a sub-tropical and hot semi-arid climate, and temperatures have been known to reach up to 36.9Â°C. The summer, which runs from May to September, experiences the hottest weather, with temperatures between 33.9Â°C and 36.7Â°C on average. Whilst considerably milder than the summer, the winter is still far warmer than many other countries in Europe, with temperatures between 15.5Â°C and 21.8Â°C on average; January is usually the coldest month of the year. Nicosia experiences very little precipitation, but what rain does fall comes mainly in December.\n\nVisas for Cyprus\n\nAlthough Cyprus is a member of the European Union, both EU and non-EU citizens must apply for a residency permit if they are to move to Nicosia for more than 90 days. These temporary residency permits, or TREs, can be applied for in Nicosia at an Immigration Office, or through your embassy or consulate before moving to Nicosia. For non-EU citizens, it is advised that they apply for their TRE before moving to Nicosia.\n\nYou will be required to submit a number of completed documents, and, depending on your financial status, you may also be required to provide evidence that you have already secured work and a work permit in Nicosia. However, in many cases your prospective employer will be able to submit your TRE application for you, but check with them first. Once you have lived in Nicosia for five years on TREs, you can apply for permanent residency.\n\nFor more detailed information on visas and permits for Cyprus, you can also take a look at our article on Moving to Cyprus."
