        "text": "Nicosia (also known as Lefkosia) Cyprus is a unique city that offers many authentic and cultural things to do. The city is one of the last divided capitals in Europe which is split into two sides North and South. Controlled by two different governments Greek Cypriot and Turkish. What makes Nicosia more fascinating is a Venetian wall that surrounds the old town in the shape of a star on both sides.\n\nIn South Nicosia (the Greek side), you can visit things like the Cyprus Museum, Famagusta Gate, and Shacolas Tower. In North Nicosia (Turkish side) you can see Selimiye Mosque and Buyuk Han. If you want to experience something different, then you can walk parts of the Green Line that borders both sides of the city. A great way to understand the fascinating history and culture of this divided country.\n\nI had been wanting to head to Cyprus for a few years, so when I booked a trip to Paphos and Larnaca, we took the opportunity to add on a couple of days to visit Nicosia. I’m so glad we did as it is such an interesting city, our only regret is not having enough days. We would have loved to have taken to take a trip to picturesque Kyrenia harbor or even go up to the Machairas Monastery.\n\n⇒ Do you require a visa or need a covid test before going to Cyprus? You can check hassle-free and apply at ivisa\n\nThings To Do in Nicosia\n\nNicosia’s interesting history and cultural wealth mean there are plenty of authentic things to do. You can walk along the green line that divides the country in two; visit the multiple free museums on offer. If you are spending longer than a day, then you can take an exciting day trip to places like Larnaca or the mountains in the west.\n\nThere is no shortage of café’s, restaurants and bars too. To help you plan your trip to Nicosia, I’ve put together a list of interesting things to do.\n\nLooking to discover other parts of Cyprus, please feel free to head to my Cyprus page\n\n1. Have a traditional Cypriot Coffee\n\nWhat better way to start your day exploring than with a Cypriot coffee and cake. Cyprus Café culture is an essential part of daily life. There is an abundance of café’s located all over Nicosia. I suggest Red Orange Kiosk & Espresso Coffee Bar, a family run business with good coffee and tea.\n\nThere are four ways of having your coffee in Cyprus: traditional coffee without sugar (sekto), and coffee with one teaspoon of sugar (metrio). As well as very sweet coffee (glico) or a cold instant coffee with ice and whipped milk cream.\n\nMake sure to order a traditional Cypriot coffee with a delicious pastry or cake on the side.\n\n2. Cyprus Museum\n\nCyprus Museum should be at the top of your list of things to do in Nicosia. Located just up the road from Paphos Gate just passed the Performing Arts Theatre. Considered to be one of the best museums in Cyprus and the oldest and largest archaeological museum in the country.\n\nIt is a great introduction to Cyprus with the artifacts dating from the Neolithic period right up to the Byzantine era. Its rich collection also demonstrates the turbulent history of what this tiny country has been through.\n\nAddress; Mouseiou 1, Nicosia, Cyprus\n\nAdditional Information for Cyprus museum\n\nEntry fee – €4.50 per person\n\nLocated – on Museum street\n\nOpening Hours – Tue-Fri: 8.00-18:00 Sat: 9.00-17.00 Sun: 10.00-13.00\n\nClosed – Mondays\n\n3. The Centre of Visual Arts and Research (CVAR)\n\nIf you like art and history then add Centre of Visual Arts and Research (CVAR) of things to do. It houses a unique collection of paintings and artifacts that highlight the island’s multicultural past through the centuries.\n\nEven if you don’t go inside the Centre of Visual Arts and Research, it is worth taking a walk around the area. As there are many up comping artist shops, cafes, and restaurants in the area. We took a break in one of the cafes here which was part of the Centre of Visual Arts and Research.\n\nAddress; Ermou 285, Nicosia, Cyprus\n\n4. Archbishop’s Palace\n\nTake a look at the Archbishop’s Palace, the official residence and office of the archbishop of Cyprus. Even though you will not be able to go into the palace, you can visit the other buildings located within the grounds.\n\nThey are the Cyprus Folk Art Museum, Byzantine Museum, and National Struggle Museum. As well as St John’s Cathedral which I hear is nice inside. All are popular museums to visit while in Nicosia.\n\n5. Shacolas Tower (Ledra Observatory)\n\nHead up the Shacolas Tower Museum and Observatory, also known as Ledra Observatory. Here you can take in amazing panoramic views of both the north and south side of Nicosia. This is the best spot to get pictures of the Selimiye Mosque and the Turkish flag across the border. I use Sony mirrorless from their collection to capture the views.\n\nThere is a lift that will take you to the 11th floor of the Sharcolas Tower located just off the famous Ledras St. There are interactive maps to identify areas and buildings, a short video/pictures about the history, and a mini souvenir shop. It is only a small fee to go up but it is worth it.\n\nAddress; Ledra Street 11th Floor of the Debenhams Building\n\nAdditional Information for Shacolas Tower\n\nEntry Fee – €2.50 per person\n\nLocated – Right off Lidras Street\n\nOpening Hours – Everyday 10:00-17:00\n\n6. The Liberty Monument (Memorial Park)\n\nTake a look at The Liberty Monument located near the Venetian walls 100 meters walk towards Nicosia old aqueduct. It is a really interesting monument to see and worth a visit. The Liberty Monument symbolises the successful Cypriot struggle for independence from Britain from 1955-1959.\n\nThe large monument contains several statues representing various things. There is one atop of the structure, watching over another two statues who are pulling chains to open a prison gate, allowing prisoners to escape British rule.\n\n7. Nicosia Old Aqueduct\n\nOnly 50-100 meters walk away from The Liberty Monument and on your way to Famagusta Gate in Nicosia’s old aqueduct. Built in the 18th century, the ancient Aqueduct is part of the old water supply system of Nicosia and is considered to be the oldest aqueduct in Cyprus.\n\nLike Famagusta Gate, you don’t need very long here just enough time to take a few pictures.\n\n8. Famagusta Gate\n\nTake a walk up to the famous Famagusta Gate just up from Nicosia’s old aqueduct. It is the most splendid out of the 3 gates along the Venetian walls of Nicosia. Constructed under Ottoman rule Famagusta Gate was originally a gate in the Nicosia walls. Now it has been restored and houses the city’s Municipal cultural centre and exhibitions.\n\nFamagusta Gate is the most impressive fragment of these old defences and is decorated with numerous coats of arms. Unless you are attending an exhibition inside, you are only really 10-15minutes here to take your photos.\n\nRight next to the Famagusta Gate is an information point. Great spot if you want to find exactly where you are along the wall.\n\n9. Paphos Gate\n\nAnother interesting unique thing to do is walk over to Paphos Gate and the Holy Cross Catholic Church. The gate is only 10m(30ft) from the Turkish Zone. You can also see the old UN building and get right up close to the Turkish side.\n\nSuggested Reading The Cyprus Emergency; – The Divided Island or The End of Empire: Cyprus: A Soldier’s Story\n\n10. Holy Cross Catholic Church\n\nWhat makes The Holy Cross Catholic Church special is its position on the dividing line of the north /south of Cyprus. The entrance is opened on the south side but the rear door on the north side is sealed.\n\n11. Walk along the Green Line\n\nIf you want to do something different that you most likely won’t do in any other country, walk part of the Green Line that cuts right through the centre of old town Nicosia.\n\nThe Green Line, also known as the United Nations Buffer Zone divides northern and southern Cyprus. It extends approximately 180 km across the island with various checkpoints along the way.\n\nWhere to see the Green Line walk\n\nStart at the Paphos Gate and either head towards Ledra Street or go the other way towards Toufexis Park. If you are planning on visiting Selimiye mosque then you will need to go to Ledra Street. This is where the main entry point is located for crossing over to the North side of Nicosia.\n\nWe felt safe walking along the Greenline, even in the parts that looked a bit dingy.\n\nIf you want to learn more about this interesting divided capital then think about a private tour created personally for you.\n\n12. Things to do in North Nicosia\n\nThe majority of things to do in Nicosia takes place in the southern part of the city. Cross over the border to the northern part of the Cypriot capital to see what it is like. The Nicosia border crossing is incredibly straightforward and only takes a few minutes.\n\nNorthern Nicosia is as safe as the southern side and many tourists cross the Green Line to visit Selimiye Mosque and Buyuk Han.\n\nCross the border at Ledra Street\n\nThe best place to cross the board is at Ledra Street Crossing, which is the most commonly used by tourists. It is also the closest to the main Selimiye Mosque. Make sure to bring along your passport as you will not be permitted to enter the northern part of Nicosia without it.\n\n13. Selimiye Mosque\n\nOne of the most recognisable landmarks in Nicosia and one of the top things to do is visit Selimiye Mosque. It is located only five minute walk from the green line crossing at Ledra Street. And it is a good starting point for exploring the North side of Nicosia.\n\nIt was originally known as the Cathedral of Agia Sofia before later being converted into a mosque. If you like to go inside Selimiye Mosque, you will need to take your shoes off before entering. Females will be required to wear a headscarf, if you are not carrying one they are provided for free.\n\n14. Büyük Han\n\nAfter stopping at Selimiye Mosque head to Buyuk Han and wander around the market. Here you take in the smells of the spices and can pick up some yummy sweets. Büyük Han is a type of inn known as a caravanserai and is the largest in Cyprus.\n\nIt is where merchants and other travellers would stay and use it as storage while passing through. Büyük Han is two storeys and built around a central courtyard in the middle of which is a masjid, or small mosque.\n\nThe Büyük Han has been beautifully restored to its former glory and is considered to be one of the finest buildings in Cyprus. Today it is home to a variety of shops, cafés and is a centre for the arts, with galleries, studios, and workshops.\n\n15. Laiki Getoria Pedestrian area\n\nHead to the Laiki Getoria pedestrian area to fully immerse yourself in the culture and take in the atmosphere. You can enjoy an abundance of shops cafes and restaurants located within the streets. The pedestrian streets look colorful with their giant sails above them. They not only look pretty but are a great photo opportunity.\n\nThis is a good spot if you are looking for things to do at night in Nicosia.\n\nPurchase Souvenirs\n\nWhile there are a lot of chain shops in the area there are a lot of local ones too where you can purchase souvenirs. Just off Onasagorou Street, you’ll find a dozen little shops selling everything from olive oil to souvenirs. You can even get paintings and sculptures all made by locals in Cyprus.\n\nHave a drink along Ledra Street\n\nA great way to finish your day exploring is to head to Ledra Street for something to eat or to enjoy a drink. It is not only popular with tourists but with the locals too, especially in the evening. We stopped off at Kafeneo Arsinois just off Ledra Street and even though it was not a bar, they served good cheap local drinks.\n\nLedra Street is the main pedestrian street in the Laiki Getoria area and is super easy to find. There are numerous cafes, restaurants, and bars scattered along the street inviting you in. Zivania is a traditional alcoholic local drink if you are looking to try something local.\n\nExperience an authentic Cypriot dinner\n\nIf you want a more authentic experience then I suggest heading to a mayiria.,old town eateries that serve traditional meals that they would have at home. You can find them located just off Ledras Street in the Laiki Geitonia area. The best bit is that they are reasonably priced.\n\nTwo of my favourite Cypriot foods to try are souvlaki (grilled meat kebabs) and fried halloumi cheese. Personally, I can never have enough of either. I recommend a lovely place called Xefoto, the food was good and reasonably priced. Vegetarian options were available there too.\n\n16. Accommodation in Nicosia\n\nThere is accommodation available in the new part of Nicosia and in the old part of the walled city. Most of the top sites to see in Nicosia though are based in the old part of the walled city. Meaning this area is a great base if you staying in Nicosia\n\nWe stayed at Hostel Xanthis for two nights before moving on to Paphos. While we don’t usually stay in hostels when we travel this one had everything we needed. We couldn’t argue with the price or the position of the hostel either. Located within the walled city and within walking distance to the sites in Nicosia’s old town.\n\nCheck availability for places to stay in Nicosia\n\n17. Getting to Nicosia from the resorts\n\nCatching the Bus to Nicosia\n\nCatching the bus to Nicosia from one of the beach resorts, like Larnaca, Limassol, or Ayia Napa is easy. There are several buses every day with some more frequent than others. The bus line routes are serviced by a company called Intercity Buses\n\nThe central bus station is only 500 meters from the start of my free self-guided walking tour starting point D’Avilla Bastion.\n\nDriving to Nicosia\n\nAlternatively, if you have hired a car to get around Cyprus there is a car park near the walled city. It is located at the Tripoli Bastion, which is near the Paphos Gate. Travel Supermarket has a free and easy fast comparison on car hire, which you can pick up at any Cyprus airport. Just like in Hammamet and Tabarka Tunisia, it is easier to get around by car than by public transport.\n\n18. Extra things to do in Nicosia\n\nOCHI Farmers Market\n\nIn Nicosia on either a Wednesday or Saturday then take a visit to the OCHI farmers market, open from 6 am to 4 pm. Located on 11 bastions of the Venetian walls of Lefkosia (Nicosia) in the area of Bayraktar Mosque.\n\nIt’s a great cultural experience watching the locals interact and one to add to your things. Here, you’ll find all kinds of fresh products from fruit and vegetables to eggs and nuts produced by locals.\n\nDo a cultural food tour of Nicosia\n\nI am a big fan of doing food tours in various countries, as not only do you get to try new foods, you learn something and they are a great cultural experience. You can try things like shaftalia (grilled sausage), fried halloumi cheese, and souvlaki (grilled meat kebabs). This would be a great option as an addition if you are visiting the farmer’s market.\n\nI recommend this Traditional Food Tour within Wall City, where you will try traditional Cuisine & Cultural Flavours.\n\nMachairas Monastery\n\nIf you have the time, head up to Machairas Monastery, located in an idyllic location in the Cypriot hills. The authentic and historically beautiful Machairas Monastery is considered one of the most important religious sites in Cyprus.\n\nThe Machairas monastery is dedicated to the Virgin Mary icon believed to be painted by Luke the Apostle. They say it was smuggled by a hermit secretly from Asia Minor to Cyprus.
