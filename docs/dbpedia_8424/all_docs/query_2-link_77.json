Your needs’ average costs, excluding rent, such as entertainment, food, and utilities, are around per month.\n\nLife as a Student in Nicosia, Cyprus\n\nNicosia is known as the Walled City, but the medieval Venetian fortifications are not the only walls within. Makeshift fences and stacked barrels go right through the city's center and form the borderline between Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This border has stood for five decades and classifies Nicosia as the last divided capital in the world.\n\nAfter Cyprus' division, the Turkish and Greek populations of the city had to relocate to their respective parts of the city. The goal was to end ethnic frictions and create lasting peace on the island.\n\nWhile 40 years ago, the division was a serious business with a heavy emotional toll on all parties involved, it’s mostly a formality nowadays. EU citizens can cross the border with a quick ID check, and all other nationals can use their passports instead.\n\nStudents often cross into Northern Nicosia to experience a strangely familiar yet different side of the city. Many describe it as a “touristy” version of the town with enchanting Turkish markets and lots of bargaining over purchases. It certainly lacks Starbucks and McDonald’s.\n\nWhile Nicosia is a divided city with a guarded border, it is safe. The border and the extra security make Nicosia a low-crime location. Thus, international students enjoy peace of mind within the city.\n\nThe fall semester starts at the end of September and lasts until the beginning of January.\n\nExaminations are between the 11th and 26th of January."
