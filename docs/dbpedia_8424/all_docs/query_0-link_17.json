        "text": "Known locally as the 'Green Line', the Buffer Zone within Nicosia's medieval city walls traces the path of Ermou Street (seen here running left to right). This was formerly the main shopping street of Nicosia. Today it is abandoned and derelict.\n\nFar from being a 'dead zone' (as it is often described by journalists), the Green Line has become a haven for flora and fauna.\n\nIn the distance the Selimiye Mosque (formerly the Cathedral of St Sophia) is a physical reminder of Cyprus's history of occupation by the Franks (1192-1489), the Ottomans (1571-1871) and, latterly, the British (1878-1960).\n\nThe Buffer Zone is not one uniform entity: it has different textures and fabrics.\n\nOutside Nicosia there are villages entirely inside the Buffer Zone that continue to be inhabited. Here in Nicosia the Green Line is an almost total exclusion zone and is contained behind high walls, metal gates, barbed wire and concrete-filled oil drums.\n\nThere are now multiple generations of Cypriots who have grown up with, and grown accustomed to, the divide in the heart of their capital city.\n\nBut, as the UN seek to withdraw from Cyprus, and as the buildings themselves become ever-more dangerous, there is a question Ito be answered: what will be the future of Cyprus's no-man's land?\n\nWill it be reoccupied by its former inhabitants? Will it become a heritage space? Or perhaps it will become an urban park and fulfil the promise of being a \"Green Line\" through the heart of the city."
