Nicosia is the last divided capital in the world, with a United Nations buffer zone separating the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot parts of the city. The city’s historic center features medieval walls and landmarks such as the Cyprus Museum, showcasing the island’s rich cultural heritage. Nicosia’s Ledra Street is a bustling hub of shops, cafes, and cultural events, representing the city’s vibrant atmosphere."
