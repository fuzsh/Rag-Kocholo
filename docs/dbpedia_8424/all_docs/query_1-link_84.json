        "text": "I\n\nI\n\nhave always found Nicosia, with its boisterous cafés and\n\nlively squares, to have the most eventful mornings in all of\n\nCyprus. In gardens across the ancient walled city, mandarin trees\n\nheave under the warm, sharp light of the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nShopkeepers throw open their doors to the steady hum of locals as\n\nchurch bells toll the time for breakfast. In the northern distance,\n\nthe minarets of mosques peek over military barricades and\n\ncheckpoints, over the infamous Green Line that now defines the\n\nworld’s last divided capital.\n\nThe island of Cyprus has reluctantly held this distinction for\n\nover 45 years. The southeasternmost member of the European Union,\n\nCyprus and its capital have been partitioned since 1974, when a\n\nTurkish invasion split the island and separated its two ethnic\n\nmajorities. Greek-Cypriots have since been allotted the south of\n\nthe island while Turkish-Cypriots remain in the Turkish Republic of\n\nNorthern Cyprus, recognised as an independent state by\n\nTurkey alone. The two communities are divided by a UN-patrolled\n\nbuffer zone that spans the country lengthwise from east to west,\n\nsevering miles of sun-bleached hills (and the occasional hamlet)\n\nthat would otherwise stretch uninterrupted to the sea.\n\nToday, Nicosia remains a patchwork town, a rare cultural\n\nexperiment on an island accustomed to slow living. Yet it is often\n\noverlooked by tourists who favour the island’s less complicated,\n\nmore scenic offerings: the bay of Kyrenia and the Blue Lagoon; the\n\nseaside promenades and turquoise harbours of Limassol and Protaras;\n\nGreco-Roman ruins in fig and olive groves; stone-walled villages on\n\nlush mountaintops. As a native to the port town of Larnaca on the\n\nsouthern coast, I understand the irresistible, often romantic tug\n\nof the sea (Aphrodite herself was born off the rocky coast of\n\nPaphos, as the legend goes). But farther from the beach, the life\n\nforce of the country pulses inland towards the capital. It is the\n\nheart of a modernising nation that no longer lingers on the lure of\n\nits antiquity, and is far more than just the casualty of an ongoing\n\nconflict.\n\nSouth of the Green Line, Greek-Cypriots are often found among\n\nthe bustle of Nicosia’s Old Town. The tangle of historic buildings,\n\nweather-beaten to a pale yellow by centuries of scorching sun, now\n\nhouses some of the country’s most accomplished restaurants. Outdoor\n\ncafés and wine bars (stocked with bottles sourced from the vines of\n\nOmodos, Arsos, Inia) are scattered among contemporary art galleries\n\nand fashion megachains; a reminder of our proximity to continental\n\nEurope. Here, days begin and end in the taverna. At local\n\nfavourites such as Piatsa Gourounaki (Piazza of the\n\nLittle Pig), tables are piled high with seared halloumi and\n\nherb-stuffed meats while grill-smoke gathers under the palms. Just\n\nsteps away, at Mousiko Kafenio (Musical Café), friends meet to\n\ndribble water in their ouzos, downing one after the other to the\n\nsound of the mandolin. When the last of the tzatziki is devoured,\n\nwell-heeled crowds amble towards newly restored Eleftheria\n\n(Liberty) Square, the last work of architect Zaha Hadid.\n\nOne day, I meet my Aunt Anna for coffee in the Old Town on Ledra\n\nStreet, the area’s busiest pedestrian walkway. Ledra Street winds\n\nthrough the two halves of the city and is home to one of several\n\ncheckpoints that allow access to North Nicosia. We meet at Giagia\n\nVictoria, a café with the homely charm of my grandmother’s kitchen\n\nbut whose eastern courtyard is comprised of the barrels and barbed\n\nwire fence of the border – a fitting illustration of how Cypriots\n\nmake the most with what’s at hand. Around the corner, the\n\ncheckpoint protrudes ahead of us like a thorn, absurd and\n\nblistering among the brunching families and flower-rimmed balconies\n\nof Ledras. Astoundingly, the border was impenetrable to Cypriots\n\nuntil it was partially opened in 2004, after years of bitter\n\ndispute. Now, my aunt and I sit and watch locals cross on foot with\n\npassports at the ready.\n\n“For Cypriots, crossing the border is now taken as a matter of\n\ncourse,” says Anna who, like the rest of my father’s side of the\n\nfamily, lost her home during the war and now lives in Larnaca. She\n\nis part of an estimated 250,000 refugees who were displaced during\n\nthe invasion. “There was a strong reluctance to cross at first\n\nbecause seeing the homes and villages we lost was too devastating.\n\nBut we are getting used to it now, and we go to the other side and\n\nwe speak to each other.” Anna sometimes browses the northern\n\nmarkets for textiles and has made friends with shopkeepers, many of\n\nwhom speak a bit of\n\nGreek and always look happy to see her. “Now being able to\n\nspend time on the other side has eased the fear of what lies beyond\n\nthe divide, and Nicosia is the more cheerful for it,” she adds.\n\nToday, locals are crossing to see more than what was left behind\n\nyears ago. Monastic grandmothers go north to light candles in the\n\nApostolos Andreas Monastery, one\n\nof the North’s few remaining Greek Orthodox churches, with handbags\n\nfull of cheese and olive pies for the journey. Turkish-Cypriots\n\nmake the pilgrimage south to the mosques of Hala Sultan Tekke, the third\n\nmost important holy site in Islam, after Mecca in Saudi Arabia and\n\nAl-Aqsa in Jerusalem.\n\nAs my aunt and I cross to the Turkish-Cypriot side, the wide\n\nroad narrows towards covered bazaars and beautifully aged\n\nbuildings, seemingly untouched since they were first built by\n\nempires past – the British and the Ottomans before them, all the\n\nway back to the Venetians and French Lusignans. An air of decay\n\nhovers over rundown grocery stores and uneven pavements. Past a few\n\ncafés where sun-drunk cats hunt for shade, markets unfold in a haze\n\nof dust and colours, cluttered and inviting, like the inside of a\n\ntrunk of toys. As we walk, the road narrows further as labyrinths\n\nof thinner alleyways splinter from its core – a world apart from\n\nthe sprawling commercial centres and high rises of the south.\n\nThe cobbles eventually pass the markets of Büyük Han (Great\n\nInn), where local artisans greet shoppers with handcrafted goods\n\nand rosewater pastries. The Han is still one of the main\n\nestablishments where Greek and Turkish-Cypriots rub shoulders\n\nregularly, shouting over each other like large families over a\n\nroast dinner. In the distance, the call to prayer sounds from the\n\nSelimiye Mosque, formerly the Cathedral of Saint Sophia. Beyond its\n\ngates, shoppers idle towards food markets to scoop up cumin,\n\ncinnamon and mint that will later become piping hot plates of köfte\n\nor moussaka.\n\nThe Han began life in 1572 as a lodging for traders and\n\nmerchants, and today it houses boutiques, restaurants, cafés and a\n\nbookshop. The two-storied fortress is imposing yet warm, with\n\nhoney-coloured walls of layered stone portioned into 68 rooms, each\n\nadorned with low-arched porticos framed in crimson bougainvillea.\n\nOnce the Inn’s bedrooms, the renovated shops look onto a courtyard\n\nwhere an Islamic prayer room stands on six marbled pillars with an\n\nablutions fountain at its centre. Overhead, enormous white sails\n\nare draped from buttresses for shade, glimmering golden-orange in\n\nthe afternoon sun.\n\nOutside of the bookshop, we meet Erkan, a Turkish-Cypriot\n\nteacher who lives near the Han and pops in for a coffee and a chat\n\non weekends. “The opening of the border has made the city better,”\n\nhe tells me as we discuss our governments’ ongoing efforts to find\n\na permanent solution to the border situation. Some citizens are\n\neven calling for the reunification of the island. “We are the two\n\nsides of the same coin. Peace talks stop and start, but the\n\nresidents of Nicosia want the same thing: to live peacefully and\n\nenjoy our island. We don’t want to go back to closed borders.”\n\nAs night falls, we head back through the checkpoint to a cosy\n\ntaverna on the\n\nGreek side of Ledras for more wine and grilled octopus. It is\n\nin such places that evenings always feel the warmest in Cyprus,\n\nplaces where generations of a family gather for hours over an\n\nenormous meal. On the radio, old folk songs praise the hidden\n\nfootpaths and moonlit bays of home. We think of what Erkan said and\n\ndecide we very much agree. The way forward for Nicosia, and for\n\nCyprus as a whole, will be paved by its inhabitants, both of Greek\n\nand Turkish descent.\n\nFar from a towering border wall, what divides Nicosia now is\n\nnothing more than a crumbling fence of barbed wire. On both sides\n\nof the Green Line, unhurried mornings unfold much the same: capped\n\nold men sit for the first coffee of the day, unfurling their\n\nnewspapers and grimacing. Children kick their footballs back and\n\nforth under the same vast, cloudless sky. The city may take its\n\ninfluence from different mainlands, but it doesn’t quite mirror\n\neither – not quite European, not quite Middle Eastern, but instead\n\na shared place between."
