Nicosia is the capital city of Cyprus. It is the last divided capital in the world, separated into the Northern and Southern parts by a buffer zone controlled by the United Nations.

Nicosia’s rich history spanning multiple centuries and cultures symbolizes Cyprus’s past struggles and hopes for reunification and peace.

Where is Nicosia?

Nicosia is located in the center of the island of Cyprus. It sits roughly in the middle of the island, serving as Cyprus’s administrative and political hub. Globally, Nicosia Nicosia is situated in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea.

Nicosia is situated at roughly 35 degrees north latitude, which places it in the northern hemisphere. It also lies between 33 and 34 degrees east longitude.

The city is approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of the southern coast of Turkey and around 400 miles (644 kilometers) east of mainland Greece. Its centralized location in the Mediterranean has historically made it a focal point.

History of Nicosia

Nicosia has a long and complex history that reflects the island’s strategic importance. Although Nicosia wasn’t a significant city-state during ancient times, it was part of the Mediterranean’s broader cultural and trade networks.

While larger centers like Paphos and Salamis dominated the landscape, Nicosia had its localized significance. The city was considered a settlement influenced by Greek and Phoenician civilizations, serving as a minor trade and agricultural hub.

Nicosia gained strategic importance during the Byzantine Era, partly because of its central location on the island. The Byzantines fortified the city as a bulwark against potential invasions, mainly from Arab forces.

Churches were built, and the city became a Christian learning and theology center. The island’s administration was increasingly centralized in Nicosia, further enhancing its importance within the Byzantine realm.

When the Lusignan dynasty took over, Nicosia became the seat of the Kingdom of Cyprus. It flourished culturally and economically by constructing palaces, churches, and fortifications.

Subsequently, the Venetians took control and invested heavily in military architecture to defend against the Ottomans. Massive walls were built around Nicosia, featuring eleven bastions and three gates. The Venetian Walls still exist today and are one of the city’s landmarks.

The Ottomans captured Nicosia in 1571 following a lengthy siege that ultimately led to the city’s surrender. During Ottoman rule, the city underwent major social and architectural changes.

Many Christian churches were converted into mosques, and Ottoman-style buildings were constructed. The population diversified with the settlement of Turks, and the administrative structures were altered to fit the Ottoman millet system, which organized communities based on religion.

When Cyprus became a British colony, Nicosia was modernized in various ways. The British introduced new administrative and legal systems.

Infrastructure like roads, schools, and hospitals were developed, and the city grew in size and complexity. Nicosia served as the epicenter of the anti-colonial movement, which sought Cypriot self-determination and, ultimately, independence.

After gaining independence in 1960, Cyprus was gripped by ethnic tensions between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Nicosia became a focal point of these tensions, exacerbated by disputes over governance and territory.

The Turkish invasion of 1974 resulted in the division of Nicosia along the Green Line, a partition still in place today. The Republic of Cyprus controls the southern part, while the northern area is under the administration of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey. Efforts for reunification have been ongoing, but a final settlement has remained elusive.
