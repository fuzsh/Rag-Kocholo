Nicosia, city and capital of the Republic of Cyprus. It lies along the Pedieos River, in the centre of the Mesaoria Plain between the Kyrenia Mountains (north) and the Troodos range (south). The city is also the archiepiscopal seat of the autocephalous (having the right to elect its own archbishop and bishops) Church of Cyprus.

Nicosia came successively under the control of the Byzantines (330–1191), the Lusignan kings (1192–1489), the Venetians (1489–1571), the Turks (1571–1878), and the British (1878–1960), and thus reflects the vicissitudes of Cypriot history and both Eastern and Western influences. Nicosia, known in antiquity as Ledra, is a medieval corruption of the Byzantine name Lefkosia. The city was a kingdom in the 7th century bce and has been a bishopric from the 4th century ce. It has been the seat of government of Cyprus since the 10th century. The city’s walled fortifications, originally erected by the Lusignan kings and later rebuilt by the Venetians to encompass a smaller area (3 miles [5 km] round), did not prevent invasions by the Genoese in 1373, the Mamlūks in 1426, and the Turks in 1570. Standing in mute testimony to the religious and political changes of the city is the Cathedral of St. Sophia. Begun in 1209, completed in 1325, and pillaged by invaders, it was converted into the chief mosque of Cyprus in 1571. In 1954 its name was changed to the Selimiye Mosque in honour of the Ottoman sultan Selim II, under whose reign Cyprus was conquered.

During the 20th century the city boundaries were extended beyond the existing circular Venetian walls, and the old town within them was rebuilt. As a result of the Turkish intervention in 1974, part of the northern section of Nicosia, including the former international airport, has remained within the United Nations Forces in Cyprus operational boundary separating the Republic of Cyprus (south) from the Turkish Cypriot-administered areas (north). The city experienced an influx of an estimated 35,000 Greek Cypriot refugees from the north in the mid-1970s.
