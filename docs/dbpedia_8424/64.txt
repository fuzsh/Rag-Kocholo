Nicosia is the capital and the largest city of Cyprus – located approximately at the geographic centre of the island. Since 1974, Nicosia remains the last divided capital city in Europe and a ‘Buffer Zone ‘lies between the Southern and Northern part. Nonetheless, the Municipality of Nicosia has always been convinced that it is essential to maintain the conditions for dealing with the divided Area as one entity. As the seat of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, Nicosia hosts in its area all major institutions of the Republic and a wide range of central and district wide administrative functions and institutions with which it cooperates on a regular basis. The city is expected to increase considerably up to 2025.

The historic old city [walled city] has important opportunities and is considered one of the most vibrant locations of Nicosia, nevertheless it faces a lot of challenges. Due to the surrounded fortifications [walls], the old city cannot expand in terms of land area. The fact that the historic city is divided can limit the actions taken and the diffusion of results. Moreover, the old city phases insufficient public transportation systems and obsolete infrastructures, and therefore, excessive use of cars, even in the narrow streets of the historical centre, downgrading the quality of life of the residents and the visitors.

Nicosia Municipality is committed to regenerating both the entrepreneurial culture and the built environment of the city, and especially its historic centre. For this reason, the Municipality has in place various plans as follows: Strategy for Integrated Sustainable Urban Development, Central Nicosia Area Plan, Sustainable Energy Action Plan, Integrated Mobility Plan, Masterplan [Bicommunal] and Smart City Plan. The Sustainable Historic Districts Project aims to build on those and to develop the community engagement in all actions taken.
