        "text": "Recently, I developed an itch for shooting film again. I haven’t used 35mm film in about 10 years.\n\nIt’s been a long time away. In fact, I sold my long-stashed-away Pentax MZ-7 and zoom lens in 2009 for about $50. I’m kicking myself for that now.\n\nI’d figured a digital camera was the only thing in my future, and I’d never use 35mm film camera again so, clean it out of the closet. Should have known.\n\nBut not having that camera anymore gave me a chance to go back even farther in time as I searched through eBay listings for film cameras that would fill this creative void in my photography practice.\n\nI’m now using a Pentax K1000 and a 50mm f/2 lens for the purely nostalgic reason that this is the very first camera and lens combo I ever used when I got serious about photography. It just feels good in my hands – the weight, the construction, the irresistible feel of the shutter button and the satisfying sound of the curtains sliding open and closed. It’s a great camera. And it was only $100, which in the world of expensive photography equipment feels like pocket change. Score!\n\nThe only other gear I’m using is a tripod and a cable release. No piles of filters or various lens options. Just me, a camera and a pocket-full of rolls of 35mm color film.\n\nIt’s a really fun (though expensive and humbling) side hobby to my focus in wildlife and conservation photography. And the first thing I needed to do in this little venture was discover which type of 35mm film I like best.\n\nSo I bought five different types recommended to me by various sources and started shooting.\n\nAll of the following is based on my experience of shooting 12 rolls of 35mm color film, trying to figure out what I like most, specifically the best film for landscape photography, but also what works for general outdoor photography.\n\nEvery image shown below is how I got it back from the lab – except the Provia, for which I deepened the blacks in Lightroom and also show some side-by-side color corrections.\n\nThis is all in the spirit of fun and experimentation, and, of course is entirely subjective. So, take it all with a grain of silver halide.\n\nHere are a couple examples of the film’s blue color cast.\n\nThe original scan is on the left, and the image color-corrected to be more accurate to the scene is on the right.\n\nIn the first example, I took a few frames of the ocean because I loved the pink light that was happening on the water at sunrise. But the film basically thumbed its nose at the pinks.\n\nAnd in the second example, the lichen I photographed is a very pale white-green color.\n\nThe film picked it up with far more blue-green than it really has. A warming filter would probably have fixed this in camera. But I’m filter-free.\n\nI will probably come back to Provia in the future when I have more experience and can do what the film wants, rather than tangling in an (expensive) fight with it.\n\nOk, so the way I feel about Ektar 100 for landscapes is the way I feel about Kodak Portra 800 for walk-around general use film.\n\nI LOVE this film.\n\nIt is so warm, so rich. The grain can admittedly be a little much sometimes, but that can be a plus in some ways. Having a lot of grain reminds me of the process of creating a photograph and feeling the overall mood and concept of an image, rather than analyzing the details for perfect sharpness and clarity. There’s no pixel-peeping in film!\n\nSo a lot of grain is fine with me when it creates images visually interesting for not only their content but also their texture.\n\nThough it’s a high-speed film and you can use it in low light, I found it shines in bright light too. I’m a sucker for backlight in my photos, and this film comes through, able to produce vivid colors and just the right amount of contrast even with a bright sun.\n\nThough I am getting back into film for landscapes, I found myself mainly photographing my dog with Portra 800. He’s always with me for these morning hikes, and I just leaned toward photographing him instead of the scene.\n\nI can’t put my finger on why, but this film seems to make a lot more sense with a specific subject within a landscape, rather than as a landscape film. Maybe it’s the grain after all — it just works with a live subject better than a landscape scene.\n\nMaybe it’s the fact that at ISO 800 it’s fast enough that I can actually hand-hold my camera at sunrise and sunset and so can more easily capture my dog in scenes.\n\nMaybe it’s that I’m a wildlife photographer and not a landscape photographer so a frame doesn’t feel quite complete to me unless there’s an animal in it.\n\nI don’t know.\n\nBut I do know that for me, this is a must-have film for general use. Completely in love with it.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned so far is that equally as important as film choice and exposure settings is great communication with your lab.\n\nThe technicians doing the processing and scanning the negative films are making specific choices that affect the outcome of your image.\n\nIf you let them know what you shot and what you’re hoping to get from your images, you’ll have a much more satisfying experience.\n\nFor example, I tried overexposing a couple frames of Portra 800 to see how well it can handle keeping highlights.\n\nI knew I was overexposing by a lot, so when I got Scan 1 back from the lab and saw the blown out highlights, I figured I just went beyond the abilities of the film.\n\nHowever, I liked the image enough that I wanted a larger scan file, so I took the negative back to the lab.\n\nEither another technician handled the scans or the first technician made a new choice about the brightness, because check out all the detail that was actually still on the negative that now shows up in Scan 2.\n\nThis is a great example of why learning how to communicate with a lab and getting on the same wavelength is such an important part of film photography.\n\nYou work together to get the best image.\n\n(Unless of course you have your own film scanner. I tried that, and totally would rather have a lab do it for me!)\n\nLuckily, adjustments can be made at the lab or at home, so there is still quite a bit of flexibility for the final results.\n\nIf you want an analysis of film choices for landscapes from a pro who specializes in photographing landscapes with film, I’ve found this article by the exceptionally talented Alex Burke to be really helpful.\n\nNow that we’ve covered my reviews, let’s talk about the factors you’ll want to take into consideration if you’re game to grab a roll of film and go outside to play.\n\nSelecting the right 35mm color film for landscape photography is a crucial step to capture breathtaking shots.\n\nThere are several factors to consider in your selection process, and understanding these can help enhance your photographic outcomes.\n\n1. Film Speed (ISO)\n\nThis represents the film’s sensitivity to light.\n\nLower ISO films (e.g., ISO 50 or 100) are less sensitive to light and result in finer grain, which can be ideal for capturing detailed landscapes with high resolution.\n\nHigher ISO films (e.g., ISO 400 or 800) are more light-sensitive, enabling photography in lower light but leading to more graininess, which might not be suitable for all landscapes.\n\nPop up to the examples again to see the difference between Portra 160 and Portra 800, and you’ll get a feel for how speed impacts the look of a final image.\n\n2. Color Reproduction\n\nDifferent films reproduce colors in varying ways, so which film you choose depends a bit on your photography style and preference on colors in your landscapes.\n\nSome films, like Kodak Ektar 100, offer vibrant, saturated colors, making them perfect for capturing rich landscapes.\n\nOthers, like Fujifilm Pro 400H, provide soft, cool colors, which can be suitable for more subdued or ethereal landscapes.\n\nTake this into account as you experiment.\n\n3. Dynamic Range\n\nThe film’s dynamic range refers to its ability to record details in the shadows and highlights of a scene.\n\nA film with a wide dynamic range, such as Kodak Portra, can capture a broader range of tones.\n\nThat’s a pretty big plus when photographing landscapes with high contrast levels.\n\nSo, depending on the landscape you’re photographing and the lighting, this will affect the choice of what film you pop into your camera.\n\n4. Grain Structure\n\nAs we’ve seen, the appearance of grain varies among films.\n\nSome photographers prefer a fine grain for a smoother, more detailed image (that’s me, mostly), while others might prefer a more prominent grain for its aesthetic quality and texture.\n\nExperiment with different speeds in the lighting conditions you most love to photograph in, and then decide on your preference.\n\n5. Price\n\nFinally, let’s talk about the elephant in the room – price. Just like anything else, you get what you pay for.\n\nIf you’re clicking away frequently, cost-effective films like Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400 or Kodak Gold 200 can be your best friends.\n\nBut if you’re after exceptional color reproduction and fine grain, high-end films like Kodak Ektar 100 or Kodak Portra might be worth that extra penny.\n\n❂\n\nThe art of film photography is not just about the click of a shutter (though, that sound is SO satisfying!!).\n\nIt’s about understanding your medium, knowing how to work with your lab, and making informed choices about your film.\n\nIt’s also about trial and error, testing different films to find what aligns best with your artistic vision.\n\nIn otherwords: creative play.\n\nEvery shot you take is an opportunity to learn and grow as a film photographer.\n\nSo, don’t be afraid to experiment, ask questions, and get to know your local lab technicians. They’ll be more than happy to dive into the details with you.\n\nI hope you have fun choosing your first roll of film to explore. Have fun out there!"
