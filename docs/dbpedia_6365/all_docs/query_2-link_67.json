        "text": "\"He really wanted different tones and textures and themes.\" Paramount has unveiled an 8-minute behind-the-scenes featurette for the sci-fi prequel A Quiet Place: Day One, which is now available on digital to watch at home (and on VOD soon). If you haven't caught up with it yet, this movie is one of the best summer blockbusters of 2024 and I highly recommend it. This behind-the-scenes promo video spends time exploring the making of the movie from all angles - story, cinematography, apocalyptic setting, etc. It's a nice look at what went into creating this sci-fi prequel. Lupita Nyong'o stars as a woman named Sam who gets caught up in the apocalyptic New York City mayhem when the alien creatures arrive and attack. As every street goes quiet, she is thrown together with a man named Eric. With some reluctance, the pair agree to navigate and survive the city together. The cast also includes Joseph Quinn, Djimon Hounsou, and Alex Wolff. It's directed by filmmaker Michael Sarnoski, with cinematography by Pat Scola, both of whom are included in this featurette. Clearly most of this was shot on sound stages using blue screen to control the background.\n\nWatch the \"Creating an Empty NYC\" featurette for Sarnoski's A Quiet Place: Day One, from YouTube:\n\nYou can rewatch the first trailer for Sarnoski's A Quiet Place: Day One right here, or the second trailer here."
