        "text": "The standalone Black Widow movie is edging closer, and now star Florence Pugh has spoken about what a special project it was for her.\n\nPugh plays Yelena Belova in the movie, the second 'Black Widow', and a 'sister figure' to Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff.\n\nRead more: Brie Larson on the ‘all-female’ Marvel movie\n\nSpeaking to Booksmart star Beanie Feldstein for Variety's Actors on Actors series of interviews, she said: “It was one of the most bizarre, nuts, extravaganza experiences…I think we’ve made something very raw and very painful and very beautiful and I think people are going to be really surprised by the outcome of a big action film having that much heart.\n\n“And I know lots of people will be emotional about [Scarlett Johansson] because her character had such a hard ending [in Avengers: Endgame], but it was special learning from her, and she’s been doing this for like 10 years in those films. For this to be her film was special.\n\nRead more: Marvel’s ‘Infinity Saga’ features alternate movie endings\n\n“And I got to be there and see how she does stunts and lives it, and it’s so her.”\n\nAs we all know, Johansson's Romanoff sacrificed herself – the only other Avenger not to make it through Endgame – while retreiving the Soul Stone from the planet Vormir.\n\nThe Black Widow movie finds itself set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, in which Romanoff 'finds herself alone and forced to confront her past'.\n\nAs well as Midsommar star Pugh, it also features Stranger Things actor David Harbour as Red Guardian, alongside O.T. Fagbenle, Rachel Weisz and Ray Winstone.\n\nIt's due for release in May, 2020.\n\nPugh is next up in Greta Gerwig’s new take on the classic novel Little Women, out in the UK on Boxing Day.
