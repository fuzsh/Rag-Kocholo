        "text": "Beth de Araújo certainly got people talking with her debut feature Soft & Quiet back in 2022, a brazen bit of social commentary that our own Paul Le described as a “shocking white-power nightmare” in his 4-star review for Bloody Disgusting. What’s next from Beth de Araújo?\n\nIndiewire reports this afternoon that the filmmaker has recently been filming her second movie Josephine, which will feature a cast led by Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan.\n\nThe website previews, “For her next film, de Araújo is again mining her own life and the world around her to tell what we expect to be another chilling tale.”\n\nProducer David Caplan teases that the upcoming movie is “a story of a family dealing with a personal trauma after seeing something unexpected and horrifying in Golden Gate Park.”\n\nThe project’s IMDb page further previews, “After witnessing a brutal attack in Golden Gate Park, eight-year-old Josephine is plunged into a maelstrom of fear and paranoia. She acts out with increasing violence looking for any way to regain control of her own safety.”\n\nBeth de Araújo described the script for Josephine, which is based on a real-life childhood experience, as “Taxi Driver meets The Kid with a Bike.” Stay tuned for more as we learn it.\n\nTim Burton’s Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is likely to strike box office gold when it releases in theaters on September 6, and we’ve rounded up a batch of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice images to help you get ready for another round with the Ghost with the Most.\n\nMichael Keaton stars alongside Winona Ryder in this year’s sequel, and the cast also includes Jenna Ortega, Catherine O’Hara, Willem Dafoe, and Monica Bellucci.\n\nHere’s the official plot synopsis: “After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River. Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia’s life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic, and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened. With trouble brewing in both realms, it’s only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice’s name three times, and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.”\n\nCheck out the unearthed images below, giving a closer look at the characters– Lydia Deetz appears to be the host of a ghostly talk show, for example.\n\nTim Burton directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.\n\nThe original classic was directed by Tim Burton in 1988 and has become a cult favorite. It starred Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as ghosts who haunt their old home. When a little girl (Winona Ryder) accidentally unleashes a mischievous ghost (Michael Keaton), the ghosts try to drive the homeowners (Catherine O’Hara and Jeffrey Jones) out of the house.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice is officially rated “PG-13” for “Violent content, macabre and bloody images, strong language, some suggestive material, and brief drug use.”\n\nTickets are on sale now."
