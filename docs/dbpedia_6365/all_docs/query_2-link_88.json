        "text": "In this short film, Kieślowski asks the questions \"In which year were you born?\" \"Who are you?\" and \"What do you most wish for?\" to forty different people, ranging from a baby to a one-hundred-year-old woman.\n\nA young man in his twenties leaves prison having served three years for a crime he didn’t commit. He wants to start over in a new place and dreams of a job, a wife and a family. He gets part way to making this dream reality, when while working a labouring job he winds up in a fateful conflict between the corrupt boss and colleagues who are secretly planning a strike. He ends up being a pawn for one side, while trying to stick to his ideals with the other.\n\nFor a long time, Polish censors tried to prohibit screenings of this TV film, probably because of the grim portrait it paints of a society that only brings happiness to the happy few."
