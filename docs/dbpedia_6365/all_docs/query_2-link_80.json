        "text": "Barry Keoghan's brutal thriller Calm With Horses, Greta Gerwig's version of Little Women and the sequel to A Quiet Place are among the best movies to watch on TV this weekend.\n\nIf you need a break from the stressful and sometimes endless process of choosing movies, then Digital Spy's Watch This franchise is here to help.\n\nRather than endlessly scroll on streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ and Apple TV+, just go back to the basics – every weekend, must-see movies are airing on the telly, and we can tell you the best ones.\n\nGet your popcorn and drinks ready.\n\nBest movies on TV (June 28-30)\n\nHere are our picks for the best movies on TV this weekend (June 28-30, 2024). All of them will air on Freeview channels like BBC, ITV, Film4 and Channel 4.\n\nA Quiet Place: Part II\n\nWith the prequel A Quiet Place: Day One now in cinemas, it's a great moment to freshen your mind and check what happened in A Quiet Place: Part II — both movies share an important connection!\n\nThis sequel to A Quiet Place picks up from where the story finished in the first movie, following the Abbott family (led by Emily Blunt's Evelyn) as they fight for survival in an alien-infested world with the help of old family friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy).\n\nA Quiet Place: Part II is airing on Film4 at 9pm on Friday (June 28)\n\nSpencer\n\nKristen Stewart was nominated for an Oscar for her terrific performance in Spencer, a very unique portrayal of Princess Diana. Don't expect a straightforward biopic (Netflix's The Crown would work better for that), as this is more of a psychological nightmare.\n\nDirected by Pablo Larraín, the movie takes place over four days around Christmas, during which Diana is navigating her life on the Sandringham estate.\n\nSpencer is airing on Channel 4 at 9pm on Saturday (June 29)\n\nLittle Women\n\nGreta Gerwig ruled the world with Barbie last year, but one of her best movies is still Little Women, a beautiful adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's beloved novel. The book has been adapted many times before, and still Gerwig managed to turn it into something unique and exciting.\n\nWith an all-star cast (Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Timotheé Chalamet, Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep, Bob Odenkirk, James Norton), the movie follows the lives of the March sisters as they march into womanhood in the midst of a war-torn country.\n\nLittle Women is airing on Channel 4 at 3.20pm on Sunday (June 30)\n\nCyrano\n\nPeter Dinklage is phenomenal in this new adaptation of the classic Cyrano de Bergerac. Joe Wright, known for romantic masterpieces like Atonement and Pride and Prejudice, re-imagined this tale through music and a modern-day freshness.\n\nYou know the story — it follows the bright poet Cyrano de Bergerac as he helps a clueless man to capture the affections of Roxanne, who Cyrano is secretly in love with.\n\nCyrano is airing on BBC One at 10.40pm on Sunday (June 30)\n\nCalm With Horses\n\nBarry Keoghan and Shogun star Cosmo Jarvis star in the brutal crime thriller Calm With Horses, which is airing on TV this weekend.\n\nSet in rural Ireland, the story follows ex-boxer Douglas 'Arm' Armstrong as he becomes the feared enforcer for the drug-dealing Devers family. He is also trying to be a good father to his autistic five-year-old son, but soon things get more dangerous than he anticipated.\n\nCalm With Horses is airing on Film4 at 11.35pm on Sunday (June 30)\n\nBest movies on TV on Friday (June 28)\n\nOctopussy (8pm, ITV4)\n\nA Quiet Place: Part II (9pm, Film4)\n\nMission: Impossible 2 (9pm, E4)\n\nBridget Jones's Baby (9pm, 5STAR)\n\nLet Him Go (10.50pm, Film4)\n\nMeet the Fockers (11.05pm, Channel 4)\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery (11.30pm. 5STAR)\n\nRocky III (11.40pm, ITV1)\n\nSpike Island (12.15am, BBC One)\n\nMisery (1.05am, Film4)\n\nChopper (1.15am, Channel 4)\n\nBest movies on TV on Saturday (June 29)\n\nThe Golden Voyage of Sinbad (11am, Film4)\n\nThink Like a Dog (11.35am, Channel 4)\n\nA Cinderella Story (11.55am, 5STAR)\n\nThe Battle of the River Plate (11.40am, BBC Two)\n\nThe Mask of Zorro (1.10pm, Film4)\n\nMirror Mirror (1.50pm, 5STAR)\n\nHotel Transylvania 2 (2.25pm, E4)\n\nYou’ve Got Mail (3.15pm, Channel 5)\n\nA Hard Day’s Night (3.35pm, BBC Two)\n\nSteel Magnolias (3.50pm, Film4)\n\nStar Trek III: The Search for Spock (4.25pm, 5Action)\n\nIce Age: Continental Drift (5pm, ITV2)\n\nClear and Present Danger (6.15pm, Film4)\n\nWhat Women Want (6.30pm, 5STAR)\n\nStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home (6.35pm, 5Action)\n\nMrs. Doubtfire (6.40pm, E4)\n\nNight at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian (6.50pm, ITV2)\n\nNever Been Kissed (6.55pm, ITVBe)\n\nSpencer (9pm, Channel 4)\n\nJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (9pm, Film4)\n\nFifty Shades of Grey (9pm, 5STAR)\n\nTrue Grit (9pm, 5Action)\n\nPlatoon (10.10pm, ITV4)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Salazar’s Revenge (10.30pm, BBC One)\n\nHereditary (11.10pm, Film4)\n\nBasic Instinct (11.25pm, 5STAR)\n\nThe Bone Collector (11.20pm, Channel 4)\n\nAlien: Covenant (1.30am, Channel 4)\n\nAmerican Psycho (1.45am, Film4)\n\nBest movies on TV on Sunday (June 30)\n\nBefore We Go (11am, Film4)\n\nCharlotte’s Web (12.50pm, Film4)\n\nOn the Waterfront (1.15pm, BBC Two)\n\nRio 2 (1.35pm, ITV1)\n\nStar Trek V: The Final Frontier (2.35pm, 5Action)\n\nTrolls World Tour (2.40pm, BBC One)\n\nA Dog’s Purpose (2.40pm Film4)\n\nNorth by Northwest (3pm, BBC Two)\n\nLittle Women (2019) (3.20pm, Channel 4)\n\nLegally Blonde (4.30pm, ITV2)\n\nMy Best Friend’s Wedding (4.40pm, Film4)\n\nStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (4.45pm, 5Action)\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness (6.20pm, ITV2)\n\nDeep Impact (6.40pm, E4)\n\nThe Greatest Showman (6.45pm, Film4)\n\nGrease (6.45pm, ITVBe)\n\nThe Maze Runner (8pm, BBC Three)\n\nRocky (8pm, ITV4)\n\nFifty Shades Darker (9pm, 5STAR)\n\nPaul (9pm, E4)\n\n12 Strong (9pm, Film4)\n\nLicorice Pizza (9.45pm, BBC Three)\n\nThe Expendables 2 (10.25pm, ITV4)\n\nCyrano (10.40pm, BBC One)\n\nFinal Destination (11.15pm, 5STAR)\n\nCalm With Horses (11.35pm, Film4)\n\nMonsoon (12.30am, BBC Two)\n\nCorpus Christi (1.35am, Channel 4)\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer (1.40am, Film4)"
