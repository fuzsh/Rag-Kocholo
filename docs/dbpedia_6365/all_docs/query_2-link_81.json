        "text": "Saban Films has picked up North American rights to Calm With Horses, executive produced by Michael Fassbender.\n\nNick Rowland’s feature directorial debut is a thriller about an ex-boxer and the feared enforcer for a drug-dealing Irish family. The pic bowed at the Toronto International Film Festival and stars Cosmo Jarvis, Barry Keoghan, Niamh Algar and Ned Dennehy.\n\n“Nick Rowland’s debut shines through its cast of rising stars. Each actor connects deeply with their roles as Nick’s direction pulls audiences into the West Ireland drug scene,” Saban Films’ Bill Bromiley said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nWritten by Joe Murtagh, the crime drama hails from DMC Film and Element Pictures. Daniel Emmerson produced Calm With Horses, with Fassbender, Conor McCaughan, Ed Guiney, Andrew Lowe and Sam Lavender among the executive producers.\n\nJonathan Saba negotiated the deal for Saban Films along with Altitude Film Sales and CAA Media Finance on behalf of the filmmakers."
