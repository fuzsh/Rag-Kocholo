        "text": "Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1 went bust at the weekend box office while Inside Out 2 beat A Quiet Place: Day One to stay at No. 1.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Horizon—which Kevin Costner directs and stars in—finished in a distant third place at the domestic box office with estimated take of $11 million at 3,334 theaters. While the film is being distributed by Warner Bros., the studio has no big stake in the Western epic.\n\nInstead, it’s Costner, who spent $38 million of his own money on Horizon while two unknown investors footed the rest of the $100 million production budget. In addition, Costner and his investors also funded the $30 million prints and advertising budget, Variety reported.\n\nForbesWhen Is 'Horizon: An American Saga' Coming To Streaming?\n\nHorizon’s dismal opening performance marks a painful start for Costner’s ambitious Western saga, which he wants to tell over four films. The actor-filmmaker will at least get to release Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 2, which is due for an August 16 release.\n\nDisney-Pixar’s Inside Out 2 took top spot for the third consecutive weekend at the domestic box office with an estimated take of $57.4 million at 4,400 theaters, according to THR. Inside Out 2’s domestic tally through Sunday is $469.3 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount Pictures’ A Quiet Place: Day One proved to be a worthy challenger by pulling in an estimated $53 million in North American ticket sales at 3,707 theaters, THR reported.\n\nForbesDoes 'A Quiet Place: Day One' Have An End Credits Scene?\n\nThe Quiet Place prequel—which stars Lupita Nyong’o, Joseph Quinn and a pair of tuxedo cats that play “Frodo” in the movie—once again chronicles the alien invasion from the first two Quiet Place films.\n\nThis time, however, the action is moved from the first two films’ rural settings to the buzzing metropolis of New York City on the first day of the alien attack.\n\nCritics reacted favorably to A Quiet Place: Day One, as Rotten Tomatoes reviewers gave the horror thriller a combined 84% “fresh” rating based on 164 reviews. RT users, meanwhile, gave the film a 73% “fresh” Audience Score based on 1,000-plus reviews.\n\nForbes'A Quiet Place: Day One' Director On Why Cat 'Frodo' Was Key To Movie\n\nHorizon is a Civil War-era tale that details the expansion of the American West and is told from the point of view from several different characters. Costner stars in the film’s large ensemble cast alongside the likes of Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Michael Rooker, Jena Malone and Danny Huston.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics are being harsh in their collective judgment of the first chapter of Horizon, giving the film a 40% “rotten” rating based on 83 reviews to date. Viewers are being a bit kinder to the Costner’s passion project, giving it a 70% “fresh” Audience Score based on 500-plus verified user ratings so far.\n\n‘Bad Boys 4’ Still Riding High\n\nSony reports that the Will Smith and Martin Lawrence Bad Boys sequel Bad Boys: Ride or Die will make an estimated $10.3 million in 3,312 North American theaters this weekend, bringing its domestic tally to $165.2 million through Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, Deadline reports that Kalki 2898 AD will take the No. 5 spot at the domestic box office with an estimated $5.4 million in domestic ticket sales from Friday to Sunday.\n\nForbes'Horizon: An American Saga' Critics Crush Kevin Costner's Western Epic\n\nAdding in the $5.5 million the Bollywood feature took in at Thursday previews, the film’s North American take stands at $10.9 million. The film is being distributed domestically by Prathyangira Cinemas.\n\nNote: This article will be updated with international box office numbers on Sunday afternoon. The final numbers for the weekend box office will be released Monday."
