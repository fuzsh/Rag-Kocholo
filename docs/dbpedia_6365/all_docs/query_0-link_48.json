        "text": "Back and forth we go, through time, in Celine Song’s début film, “Past Lives,” and there’s not a DeLorean in sight. After a brief opening scene, in a New York bar, the words “24 years earlier” appear onscreen. For a second, I misread “years” as “hours”—a more manageable flashback—but no, Song really is grabbing us by the hand and asking us to leap before we look.\n\nThe first leap takes us to Seoul, where Na Young (Seung-ah Moon), aged twelve, lives with her parents and her sister. She walks home from school with a boy, Hae Sung (Seung-min Yim), who, for once, has got better grades than she has. She could not be more annoyed. He calls her a psycho, as if that were a quality to be admired. The two of them go on a playdate, climbing on chunky sculptures in a park, their faces vanishing and coming back into view—a hint of the transience that will lend the film an air of cheerfully worried fragility.\n\nThe exciting news for Na Young is that she and her family are relocating, to Canada. As if that were not transformative enough, she acquires an English name, Nora Moon, which sounds like the heroine of a fairy tale. Hae Sung is upset by her departure, but, hey, he’s a kid; he’ll get over it. He does not. (The whole movie is alive to the idea of our not getting over things. Think of it as a welcome rebuke to our nagging demands for closure.) Twelve years later, as an adult (Teo Yoo), Hae Sung reaches out to Nora (Greta Lee), now an aspiring playwright in New York. True to the mechanisms of modern love, they connect on Facebook. In lieu of billets-doux sealed with wax, we get buffering, frozen laptop screens, and texts that arrive at three o’clock in the morning.\n\nSome things, though, never go out of style. Notice Nora’s response to making contact with her old pal: filmed on the street, from overhead, she walks along with a spring—or a springtime—in her step, as if barely able to stop herself from breaking into a dance. It’s a lovely old-school touch, all the more unexpected because the grownup Nora is the most composed of souls. Hae Sung recalls that, as a child, she used to weep a lot. “You can’t cry in New York City?” he asks. “When I first immigrated, I used to cry a lot,” Nora replies, “but then I realized that nobody cared.” You sense a sharp turn in Lee’s performance: she is seldom less than charming, but there are increasing flickers of severity, too—the implication being that charm alone will not fuel you for city life. You have to be hard. Hence the abruptness with which Nora, in a video call, tells Hae Sung, “I want us to stop talking for a while.”\n\nAnother dozen years flit by. Nora, living in the East Village, is married to Arthur (John Magaro), a writer whom she met at a creative retreat in Montauk. The existence of Hae Sung, on the other hand, has stalled. Now an engineer, he still goes out drinking in Seoul with his buddies, and he’s meant to be getting married, but, as he says, “I’m too ordinary.” The one extraordinary thing about him is the strength of his feelings for Nora, which refuse to subside. He flies to New York, checks into a hotel room (a Whistlerian study in blue-gray), and then stands in a park, awaiting Nora, nervously smoothing his hair and his clothes, as if he were twelve years old again and preparing to receive a prize. When Nora calls his name, the camera stays on him, gauging the swell of emotion on his face—a kind of grateful astonishment, tranquil with ecstasy.\n\nHere, at last, you get swept up in the action. If such moments are rare, the rarity is not exactly a fault. Suffice to say that Song’s film is a romance—perhaps the romance—of the now. Compared with Max Ophüls’s “Letter from an Unknown Woman” (1948), which is no less reliant on chronological hops, and which slays me with every viewing, “Past Lives” is strikingly cautious, calm, and superfine. A cynic might even suggest that, like its title, it flirts with the timid, fighting shy of excess in its characters as in its compositions. (Try counting all the shots with mirrors and windows. In every respect, Song is inviting reflection.) The only scenes that ring false, tellingly, are the male boozing bouts in Seoul. Vulgarity is not on the menu. If there is comedy here, it’s light and consciously awkward; villainy is unimaginable; sex is scarcely mentioned, let alone performed. When Nora and Arthur wake up in bed, she admits that her strongest desire is for chicken wings.\n\nYet the film hits home. In part, that is a tribute to its melancholy. Unlike the nocturnal strollers in Woody Allen’s “Manhattan” (1979), who leaned into love while seated on a bench, beside a gorgeously envisioned Fifty-ninth Street Bridge, Hae Sung and Nora stand stiffly in front of the Brooklyn Bridge, in daylight, while another couple, behind them, are enfolded in a kiss. In short, Song’s film may not be a love story at all. I suspect that its real theme is transplantation, of which love is both a casualty and a blessing. Look at Arthur, sweetly attempting to learn Korean, and fretting because Nora, when she dreams, speaks Korean in her sleep. Listen to her, meanwhile, on the subject of Hae Sung: “He’s so Korean. I feel so not Korean when I’m with him.” Rich in settling and unsettling, “Past Lives,” for all its coolness, provokes us with difficult questions. When a person is described as Korean American—or French Moroccan, or whatever—what depths of experience are embodied in that juxtaposition? Is it surprising that Greco-Roman wrestlers tie themselves in knots? Is Hae Sung being cruel, or honest, when he refers to Nora as “someone who leaves”? No wonder the whole thing ends in tears.\n\nIf you happened to be driving down the Sunset Strip in 1970, you might have seen a cow. Not a live cow, or portions of a dead one on a barbecue, but a billboard that featured a placid beast, in a green field, turning to face the camera. The image was there to advertise a new Pink Floyd album, “Atom Heart Mother,” whose cover bore no mention of the band. No words at all, in fact. Nothing but the cow—who is not to be confused, obviously, with the cow who appeared on a Pink Floyd bootleg in the nineteen-eighties titled “Dark Side of the Moo.”\n\nThe cover of “Atom Heart Mother” was dreamed up by Hipgnosis, the design company that you instinctively sought out, from the late sixties to the late seventies, if you were a big and smelly cheese in the world of British rock. The saga of the business, which was formed and defined by two men, Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey (Po) Powell, is told in a new documentary, “Squaring the Circle (The Story of Hipgnosis).” This is your chance to learn about the naked blond children clambering over rocks on the front of Led Zeppelin’s “Houses of the Holy”; the delicate drawing of filmmaker paraphernalia on 10cc’s “The Original Soundtrack”; and, for Peter Gabriel’s first solo album, the droplets of rain on the hood of a car, each of which was minutely scratched on the print to intensify its gleam. Oddly, Gabriel’s shiny alien stare on the inner sleeve was not a graphic effect; he wore silver contact lenses. Of course he did.\n\nWhy do such arcana matter, and how come “Squaring the Circle” is so bracing to behold? It’s directed by Anton Corbijn, whose film “Control” (2007)—a dramatized account of the life of Ian Curtis, the lead singer of Joy Division—is the least fanciful and the most grimly vehement of musical bio-pics. Corbijn has an obsessive eye, and it suits the detail-crazy methods of Powell and Thorgerson. (The latter was famously cussed; according to Nick Mason, Pink Floyd’s drummer, he “wouldn’t take yes for an answer.”) To meet the demands of Paul McCartney, for example, Hipgnosis thought nothing of ferrying a statue to the snowy peak of a mountain, by helicopter, for the cover of “Wings Greatest.” And if you were one of the spaced-out fans who spent hours puzzling over the front of Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here,” trying to work out whether the guy on fire, in a suit, was truly on fire, the new movie, far from pouring cold water on rock mythology, is here to fan the flames.\n\n“Squaring the Circle” is thus a double elegy. On the A-side, it conjures up a lost world of noisome glamour, in which visitors to the toilet-less headquarters of Hipgnosis, in London’s Soho, were forced to pee in the sink. (This could explain why the company was never commissioned by, say, Diana Ross & the Supremes.) On the B-side lies a more specific loss. The album cover was a minor but deliriously popular art form that was limited not just by shape—a neat fit, incidentally, for the square format favored by many modish photographers of the sixties—but also by the prospect of its own inevitable death. Technology gave, and technology hath taken away. Dismal though it was to see the cover of Genesis’s “The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,” into which Hipgnosis had packed an entire narrative, shrunk to a flimsy insert inside the case of a compact disk, how much sadder it is to summon the LP on Spotify these days and to find your iPhone displaying something smaller than a graham cracker. Vinyl has made a comeback, of sorts, but who still wants to be Hipgnotized? ♦"
