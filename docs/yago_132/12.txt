Her iconic style and mannerisms have been studied and imitated by actors and actresses since her death in 1962.

Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller

Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller first met in 1951, when Arthur visited Hollywood with his wife Mary Slattery. At the time, Marilyn was between her first and second marriages, with James Dougherty, who she was with from 1942 to 1946, and Joe DiMaggio who she married in 1954 and divorced in 1955.

Arthur was a successful writer, who had written “Death of a Salesman,” which Marilyn greatly admired. They became friends and Marilyn soon started consulting Arthur on her career. Their friendship blossomed over the years, and it wasn’t long before they started seeing each other romantically.

Marilyn and Arthur had a deep respect and admiration for each other’s talents. For Marilyn, Arthur was someone she could talk to about her hopes and dreams, and get advice from. For Arthur, he saw Marilyn as an opportunity to help her realize her dreams and make them a reality. She also provided him with a new lease of life, after years of writing and struggling to get his work recognized.

In addition to this, they were both intelligent, creative, and sensitive individuals, and it is thought that these shared traits helped draw them together.

In June 1956, the two were married, despite the age difference between them (she was 28, and he was 41). They enjoyed a passionate marriage, going on holidays together, attending award ceremonies and events, and generally just enjoying each other’s company.

Divorce

However, their marriage was not without its challenges. One such instance occurred when the actress discovered a list of reasons, written by her husband, that explained why it might be not be a smart decision to marry to her. Marilyn also found out about many of Miller’s affairs, including with Inge Morath, a woman he met while on the set of The Misfists. This betrayal was even more powerful given that the film was specifically written so that Marilyn could enjoy a more serious acting role.

In 1961, despite reports that the couple was trying to reconcile their differences, they filed for divorce.

Marilyn and Arthur’s marriage ultimately ended due to disagreements over their careers and different expectations of each other. As Marilyn’s fame increased so too did the demands on her time, leading to arguments between them over her commitments to her career.

As well as this, Arthur had hoped that their marriage would lead to him being accepted into high society, something which Marilyn was unwilling to do. This led to further arguments and, eventually their divorce in 1961.

Arthur Miler and Inge Morath

Arthur Miller’s third marriage was to Inge Morath, a German-Austrian photographer. The two met in 1957 when Miller was in Europe for the filming of The Misfits, in which Marilyn Monroe starred. After his divorce from Marilyn, he and Inge married in 1962. Throughout their marriage, they had two children together and they remained together until his death in 2005.

Inge had a successful career as a photographer, and Arthur was very supportive of her work. They both traveled extensively and documented their experiences in photography and literature. Inge was with Arthur throughout his battle with lung cancer and also cared for him during his final days. This loving relationship stands out as one of Arthur’s longest and happiest, lasting forty-three years until his death in 2002.
