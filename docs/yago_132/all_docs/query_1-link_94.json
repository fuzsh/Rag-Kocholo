        "text": "Arthur Miller: biography\n\nOn 17 October 1915, Arthur Miller was born in Harlem, New York City. He was of Jewish and Polish descent. His father, Isidore Miller, owned a clothing manufacturing business which he lost because of the Wall Street stock-market crash of 1929. Subsequently, the family moved to Brooklyn.\n\nMiller delivered bread to make ends meet and worked other odd jobs to save up money for his college tuition fees. Miller described growing up during the Great Depression in a memoir piece called A Boy Grew in Brooklyn (1955).\n\nMiller started writing when he began his studies at the University of Michigan. In 1936, Miller wrote his first play, No Villain, which went on to receive the Avery Hopwood Award. This recognition gave young Miller the idea that he could have a career as a playwright. In 1938, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in English. Because of an injury, he didn't have to serve in the army during World War II. In 1940, Miller married Mary Slattery, and they had two children.\n\nHe started writing All My Sons in 1941. His first Broadway production, The Man Who Had All the Luck, premiered in 1944. However, the play wasn't received well, and it closed after only four performances. In 1947, Miller produced All My Sons as a second attempt to succeed on Broadway. If the play failed, this might have been his last attempt.\n\nLuckily, All My Sons turned out to be a huge success, and Miller won the Tony Award. From that point onwards, success followed. Death of a Salesman premiered in 1949, winning several awards. It was directed by Elia Kazan, who became a good friend and creative partner to Miller. In 1951, Miller met Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe, and they had an affair.\n\nIn 1952, Elia Kazan and Arthur Miller had a falling out. In American history, the period from the late 1940s to the 1950s is known for 'McCarthyism', referring to the policies introduced by Senator Joseph McCarthy (1908-1957) against people who were suspected of communist activities. Kazan was called before the HUAC investigation committee (the House of Un-American Activities Committee), where he gave the names of people in the New York City theatre community who were involved in communism.\n\nAs a response to Kazan's betrayal, Miller wrote The Crucible, which premiered in 1953. The dramatist based the play on the Salem witch trials of 1692-93 in Massachusetts, in which people were prosecuted and executed for alleged witchcraft, but it was also an allegory for McCarthyism.\n\nIn 1956, Miller divorced Mary Slattery and married Marilyn Monroe. The same year, he appeared before HUAC and refused to save himself from scandal by giving the names of other people involved in supposed communist activities. Miller was convicted for contempt, and he lost some of his privileges, including his US passport. Two years later, in 1958, the case was overruled.\n\nIn 1960, Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay for The Misfits, a film directed by John Huston and starring Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable. At this point, Miller's marriage was falling apart. The following year, Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe had a divorce.\n\nIn 1962, Miller married Austrian photographer Inge Morath, and the couple had two children. Their son, Daniel, had Down syndrome. Miller sent him to institutions, and he wasn't keen on visiting him. In 1964, two of Miller's most well-known plays, After the Fall and Incident at Vichy, were produced. After the Fall was based on the playwright's marriage to Marilyn Monroe, and the play reunited him with Elia Kazan.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Miller's works were banned in the Soviet Union because he spoke out for the freedom of dissident writers (writers who openly disagreed with the Soviet ideology). For the rest of his career, Miller kept writing plays, screenplays, and essays while continuing to explore and experiment with theatre.\n\nIn 1987, he published his autobiography, Timebends. Miller received several awards for his achievements, including the National Medal of Arts (1993), the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award (1998), and the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (1999), among others.\n\nInge Morath died in 2002. In 2004, Miller announced that he was in a relationship with a much younger woman, the minimalist painter Agnes Barley. He intended to marry her, but he died on 10 February 2005 at the age of 89 in his home in Roxbury, Connecticut. The cause of death was congestive heart failure.\n\nArthur Miller had a writing career that spanned over half a century. His legacy includes 25 plays, numerous screenplays, essays, novels, and short stories."
