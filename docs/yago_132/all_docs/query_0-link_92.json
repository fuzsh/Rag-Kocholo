        "text": "BOMBSHELL Marilyn Monroe was an actress and model who rose to fame in Hollywood during the 1950s.\n\nThe starlet was married three times during her lifetime to the men below.\n\nJames Dougherty\n\nMarilyn Monroe and James Dougherty were married from 1942 to 1946.\n\nAt the time of their nuptials, Monroe was 16 years old while her first husband was 21 years old.\n\nDougherty was an American police officer and the first trainer of the Special Weapons and Tactics.\n\nHe was born in 1921 in the state of Texas and died on August 15, 2005, at age 84.\n\nJoe DiMaggio\n\nAfter Monroe's brief marriage to Dougherty, she was single for nearly 10 years until she met Joe DiMaggio.\n\nJoe DiMaggio and Monroe had a two-year romance until they got married in 1954.\n\nMarilyn was 28 years old when she married her baseball player husband.\n\nDiMaggio was 40 years old at the time of their marriage.\n\nHe was a Major League Baseball star for the New York Yankees until 1951.\n\nMarilyn and Joe divorced just after one year of marriage in 1955.\n\nHe died on March 8, 1999, in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nArthur Miller\n\nMonroe married her last husband Arthur Miller in 1956.\n\nThe actress was Miller's second wife after his marriage to Mary Grace Slattery.\n\nMiller was a playwright famous for writing shows such as The Crucible, Death of a Salesman, Broken Glass, and more.\n\nMiller and Monroe divorced after five years of marriage in 1961.\n\nMonroe died on August 4, 1962, at the age of 36 while Miller died at the age of 89 in 2005.\n\nMiller wrote the screenplay for The Misfits, a film in which Monroe played the main character.\n\nIn the screenplay a young woman falls in love with a much older man, this was her last film before Monroe's death.\n\nThe outlet also reported that during their marriage Monroe had several miscarriages and was battling depression.\n\n\"I guess to be frank about it, I was taking care of her. I was trying to keep her afloat,\" Miller told Mike Wallace during a 60 Minutes interview in 1987, according to CBS News.\n\n\"She was a super-sensitive instrument, and that's exciting to be around until it starts to self-destruct.\""
