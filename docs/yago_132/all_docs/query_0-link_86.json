        "text": "\"Because he was an ass married to an addict. He hated her because she was more talented than he was.\"\n\nWhat utter bullshit. She was NOT \"more talented than he was.\" What a stupid statement.\n\nAs for their union...well, it's not that hard to understand. She liked older men, father-figure types; he was serious and intelligent and admired for his brilliance as a playwright. She thought being married to such a man would show people that she was more than a dumb blonde sexpot, that she had depth and substance. She thought he would take care of her. He was certainly attracted by her beauty; what man wouldn't be? And he was touched by her sensitivity and sadness. They fell into what they both thought was love. But Marilyn must have had her doubts because before their wedding she got cold feet and thought about not going through with it, but didn't want to \"disappoint\" the people who'd shown up for their wedding so she married him. Supposedly she did the same thing with Joe DiMaggio, that is, have serious doubts right before the wedding. Anyway, they married and it was a disaster. Not only was Marilyn a drug addict she was mentally ill and expected Miller to be her savior. During his marriage to her he barely wrote anything, because taking care of her was pretty much a full time job. He hung in there longer than any other man she'd been with (five years) but divorced her in order to save himself. They were two people who never should have gotten married. But I guess it was one of those things that can happen between two famous people: they become enamored of each other and it later becomes clear that the relationship was a big, big mistake.\n\nshe wasnt an alcoholic and she wasnt a drug addict except she was addicted to sleeping pills due to an especially dreadful problem with insomnia. Imagine you are the biggest star in the world mostly due to your looks. You cant sleep at night and you look like shit in the morning and you have to get up at 5 30 AM to face the cameras. If you cant perform and look beautiful..... after one or two box office flops, you are done....that is the stress of MM at the end of her life. Like many people she believed prescriptions to be the miracle cure and she had too much faith in her last psychiatrist which proved to be her undoing., llterally . Yes she slept with Milton greene early in their association, Amy Greene knew it as hated Monroe for it which shows thru to an extent in her interviews now. Milton Greene was also bisexual. No she didnt ever have an affair with Robert Kennedy and yes she had a one night stand with JFK and became obsessed with him only because he was the one man she couldnt really snag for more than a one night, and it bugged the shit out of her.. She had serious mental health issues that lithium treated somewhat successfully and those mental issues were inherited from her mother. Yes Monroe was brillant, extremely talented, and probably the most beautiful woman of her era. No she didnt commit suicide and no she wasnt murdered. And yes she met her father towards the end of her life.\n\nR 85 Thank you.\n\nI saw what I saw. She was alone talking to me. Huge backyard, she sitting under a big tree, script in her lap, We talked for somewhere around 30 minutes.\n\nI did not know who Arthur Miller was.\n\nBut - he approached where we were, in a angry gait - she saw him approaching. It was as if she shrank. As he came upon us, he glared at me - a kid. Then yelled something nasty at her. She shrank even more. I remember putting my hands on her arm as she started to get up. She told me it would be okay. He snapped his fingers at her like she was a dog and pointed to her trailer. Glaring at me once again. As she walked towards her trailer, her shoulders slumped, her head down. I hated him. Whoever he was I hated him. And she was diminished, maybe even afraid of him.\n\nLater that day, Marilyn showed up to film, he was with her. (And yes she said hello to me by name in front of everyone.) I asked my Mom who that man was - she answered Arthur Miller, her husband. It made me sick inside.\n\nI did not see him with her again. But I did see that moment in time. I think I saw the real Arthur Miller.\n\n\"One of her publicists ,Michael Selden, has confirmed the JFK/BOBBY affairs, and that he and Pat Newcomb and others on her team worked relentlessly to keep the public from finding out, though it was common knowledge in Hollywood. He said they had a symbiotic relationship with the press (i.e., they provided juicy info about other actors/clients in exchange for their silence) to prevent anything from leaking.\"\n\nFrom a biography of Monroe ere is all that is known with \"absolute certainty\" about Marilyn Monroe's relationship with the Kennedys. Her association with them lasted a mere six months:\n\nMarilyn met JFK at a dinner party in the 1950s. She met him again at the National Democratic Convention in July of 1960. Those meetings were passing and perfunctory.\n\nA year and a half went by.\n\nThen the six month time clock began.\n\nMarilyn met Bobby Kennedy on February 2, 1062, at Pat and Peter Lawford's home.\n\nShe saw JFK in March 1962 at a dinner party in New York.\n\nShe slept with JFK on March 24 and possibly March 25, at Bing Crosby's home.\n\nShe performed at JFK's birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in May 1962.\n\nShe saw Bobby at another dinner party at Pat and Peter Lawford's in June 1962.\n\nOther than telephone calls she placed to JFK, which he apparently did not take, and to Bobby, which he and his secretary apparently did take,that's it. Anything else just cannot be proven. Of course that doesn't mean it didn't happen. JFK and Bobby could also have been secretly living in her guesthouse, too, and that can't be proven or dis-proven either.\n\nArthur Miller was, understandably, bowled over by Marilyn Monroe. She was the ultimate trophy wife; no doubt he had the delusion that life with her would be magical. But the reality of her was something else entirely. She supposedly found something he'd written about her; he thought she was \"some kind of angel\" but he guessed he was wrong. Boy, he WAS wrong. The sweet angel he thought he'd married was a mentally ill woman with a substance abuse problem; demanding, needy, insecure, constantly in need of reassurance. The five years he was with her he barely wrote at all, because taking care of her was a full time job. It wore him out and he finally gave up. But he hung in there longer than any other man.\n\nLaurence Olivier had a similar delusion about Marilyn Monroe. He had the idea that he would fall immediately in love with her (they were to do a movie together; it was an odd pairing) and he they would have a passionate, unforgettable affair. But once they started working together he ended up hating her guts. There was no affair; she was driving him crazy by never showing up on time and not remembering her lines. What Marilyn Monroe seemed to be on the surface, this irresistible sexual obliging creature, was NOT what she really was. Men who knew her found that out eventually, which is why she never had a relationship with a man that lasted in her life.\n\nsource for Marilyn met her father towards the end of her life for reply 78........ It was a book written by her sister entitled my sister marilyn by her half sister, berneice miracle. see pages 176 and 177. Marilyn told berniece her father came to visit marilyn in the hospital (towards the end of her life). They talked a long time and it was pleasant but he wasnt all that warm and it didnt satisfy her fantasies. In the telling Marilyn didnt say how the visit came about or too many details and Berniece knew enuf not to press too much for any addl info as the subject was so painful for Marilyn. Berneice knows who the biological father was but does not specifically name him in the book. The only hint is Marilyn was sure the man at the hospital was her father due to facial features and unusual feature of his ears that Marilyn had as well. Ive seen pictures of Edward Mortensen ,one of Glady s husbands, and I think his face looks like Marilyns, but stanley gifford s photos show the probable ear similiarity so I cant really figure it out. Berneice would not name the father in the book as she promised Marilyn never to reveal it.............My guess is its one or the other. At one point Marilyn said he was prominent in the film community and that would be Gifford as Mortensen was a mail carrier..... In another book Gifford s kids from another marriage flatly deny Marilyn was GIffords daughter. . Mortensen had a photo of marilyn in his billfold when he had a heart attack while driving in his car and died. Tnat was 25 years after she died, so he obviously believed he was the father.\n\nFor all of you Arthur Miller lovers...did you know Miller had not one, but 2 kids after Marilyn s death with his last wife? The second kid is a son and he was autistic. They stuck him in a mental hospital and Miller had nothing to do with the kid basically the rest of his life. In interviews after Marilyn s death it was pretty apparent he had a lot of pent up hostility and anger towards his late ex wife. I think what grated on him the most was he had finally met his match in Marilyn Monroe and she was actually smarter. more successful , and the breadwinner in the relationship, and she threw that into his face at every opportunity, and after her death it was payback time. He was an utter ass in real life.\n\nYes Marilyn was reckless with prescrip drugs, but you have to remember in 1962 pills were considered miracle cures and there wasnt a betty ford clinic then or anything much known about addiction and it was a different era.\n\nFinally as to the Bobby kennedy crap. Truman Capote once said he saw Bobby Kennedy nude in a locker room and judging by the size of his ............, he was shocked Kennedy could have even fathered kids.............if you get my drift..........................with Marilyn s history of SInatra and Dimaggio in the bedroom I GUARANTEE you she would not have been interested in Bobby. She told her close confident Ralph Roberts that Bobby was too puny when Roberts brought up the Bobby affair rumors to her in 1962. so you decide..... Jack K was a one night stand and because he wasnt coming back for seconds her ego went into overrdrive and she became obsessed, this did NOT happen to Marilyn Monroe...but it was his unavailablity that was the motivator not some grand long passionate thing............yes she was obssesed and it factored into her depression her last summer. She believed she was on the slide from her peak at 36 and her looks were starting to fade and her hold on the world would soon end...Kennedy s rejection fed into that.\n\nFinally nobody murdered her, she didnt commit suicide. It was an accidental overdose administered by the loser Eunice Murray her housekeeper..at the direction of quack Dr Greenson. It was a chloral hydrate enema administered by Eunice. Either Eunice messed up on the doseage or it was the interraction of the drug in the enema with the steady intake that day of nembutal that Marilyn was taking that she didnt mention to Greenson. The 2 drugs do not mix and actually the combination in too high amounts are fatal. The drug was administered by enema as Greenson did NOT give the drugs directly, injections etc. That was up to her internist who was unavailable that weekend as he was separating from his wife. So Greenson chose enema for the drug administration and he wouldnt have done that personally...he allowed an untrained unstable housekeeper to do the deed. The reason that saturday was an emotionally wrenching one for Marilyn and she was so on edge is because she was letting Eunice. her housekeeper, go. and saturday was her last day. She was also terminating dr greenson and she had told him at that time. So nerves were on edge and she was trying to numb herself during the day. It was an accidental fatal error in judgement by Greenson with Marilyn partly at fault by over using the nembutal. All of the far out theories of her death and people just immediately count out the 2 people that were key in her life, and with her off and on the entire day?? Mystifies me how people look for phantom killers??? It was a terrible accident. Greenson should have lost his medical license but he was able to keep the circumstance under wraps...he eventually stopped seeing patients, suffered from heart problems, and looked haunted in his later years in photos.\n\nI never bought the \"killer enema\" theory that Donald Spoto put forth in his skewed biography of Marilyn. Spoto is so besotted by Marilyn that his version of events isn't exactly the most credible. Despite all the evidence to the contrary he insists that Marilyn was NOT a drug addict, NOT promiscuous, NOT unprofessional and NOT mentally ill. His Marilyn is simply a sensitive artist who had a lot of bad luck and poor treatment from a lot of mean people who wanted to use her. And he praises to the skies her aborted performance in \"Something's Got To Give\", although outtakes from the movie show her as unfocused and \"acting underwater\", as someone said.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Marilyn would have allowed Eunice Murray, a weird woman Marilyn had no liking for, to \"administer\" an enema to her. Marilyn was no stranger to enemas; she used them throughout her life as a weight loss device, so why the hell would she need an old woman to give her an enema? Anyway, it's Spoto's idea that the possessive, unethical psychiatrist Greenson ordered a chloral hydrate enema that either killed her outright or in combination with other drugs she took caused her to overdose. Actually, I think might be she may simply took many pills and died. She'd overdosed several times before; it could easily happened again and this time there was no one to save her, no husband or lover for friend.\n\nAs for Greenson, he really was a dick. Rather than trying to make Marilyn stronger and more self-reliant, he encouraged her dependence on him and did outrageous thinks like having her take her sessions with him in his home and then having dinner with him and his family. Completely unethical behavior that he tried to justify by saying all he was trying to do was alleviate her 'terrible loneliness\" by making it seem like she had a family: his.\n\nAs for all the Kennedy nonsense....well, that's what it is, nonsense. She had a one night stand, maybe two, with JFK. And there is no real evidence at all to suggest she had a hot and heavy affair with Bobby Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy may have liked to dip his wick in some barrel other than Ethel's sometimes, but he sure as hell wasn't dumb enough to have a \"serious\" affair\" with someone as wacko as Marilyn. Monroe. I don't think he fucked her at all. I think he would have been afraid to.\n\nI didnt say he saw all the kennedy men naked, I said either he or somebody he knew directly saw Bobby Kennedy in a locker room naked. Truman Capote isnt all that reliable, but Im not sure why he would lie about a subject like that? He wasnt commenting about the observation of Bobby in conjunction with Marilyn................I just am putting what I know about MM relationship history with men and what Capote mentioned unrelated as a probable scenerio. Truman Capote was a first class gossiper but a great deal of it probably had some basis in fact. On the commentor that MM probably just overdosed on pills. There was no evidence of that in the autopsy. There was no pill residue found in the autopsy. There was a discoloration of her colon that the pathologist had never seen before in an overdose situation. That could have been caused by the drug enema hypotheses. I know a drug enema sounds like an extremely bizarre far fetched way to go. This did come from Spoto s book. He did have a favorable opinion of Monroe but he didnt sensationalize the events in her life. Everybody want s some fantastic explanation of MM death. Her life and death were fantastic enuf without any extra sensationalism needed. I am fascinated by Monroe and always have been/ I have read about just everything ever written about MM. Based on everything Ive ever read I think Spoto s book is the most accurate and he finally figured out the mystery of her death. My opinion. Everybody is welcome to their own."
