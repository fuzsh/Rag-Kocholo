        "text": "Marilyn Monroe is an American pop icon who still has a hold on us. The new Netflix movie, Blonde — based on — is a gothic retelling of her legend, one befitting the post #MeToo moment. Neither Oates's novel, nor the movie, purports to be a true biography. If the nuance and complexity of Monroe’s real life is lost in the mix, so be it. Regardless, there was more to Monroe than her myth, as we learn in this intimate remembrance from Isadore Miller, the father of Monroe’s second husband, Arthur Miller. Featured in the January 1963 issue of Good Housekeeping, we discover a restless Monroe, but one who is also affectionate, thoughtful and doting. It’s a side of her we rarely hear about and it humanizes her beyond legend. —Alex Belth, Hearst archivist\n\nIn the arena of motion pictures, where women compete so fiercely for some of life's gaudiest rewards, Marilyn Monroe won all the laurels. Then, on August 5, 1962, headlines stunned the world: “Marilyn Monroe, 36, dies of sleeping-pill overdose.”\n\nNone mourned more than Isadore Miller, a tall, distinguished-looking man of 77, who learned the news that Sunday morning while he was shaving. Mr. Miller is the father of the playwright Arthur Miller, who was once married to Marilyn.\n\n“Gramp, Marilyn is dead,” Eric, his 10-year-old grandson, blurted.\n\nThe child's father added quickly: “Eric is imagining things. You know how he likes to make up stories.”\n\n“I chose to believe Marilyn was alive,” Isadore Miller told me recently, “because I wanted so desperately to believe it.”\n\nLater, when his daughter Joan broke the news more sympathetically, he was confined that Marilyn's death was an accident. “She wanted help and nobody was near her,” he told me. \"I had spoken to her only 10 days before. She sounded happy. I remarked, ‘Your voice is very clear and I know you feel well.’\"\n\nMarilyn Monroe with playwright Arthur Miller and his parents Mr. and Mrs. Isadore Miller in 1956.\n\n\"Dad, I feel fine,\" she answered.\n\n“There was no desperation in that voice,” he assured me, “and I never thought of Marilyn as a tragic figure. At least, if she was, she concealed it from me.”\n\nHowever, Saturday, August 4, 1962, puzzled Mr. Miller. When he called Marilyn at noon, New York time (9 a.m. Los Angeles time), the housekeeper said that Marilyn was dressing and would call him back.\n\n“She never got that message,” he told me. “If she had, she would have talked to me. She always interrupted even a business conference to talk to me. So I waited. But Marilyn did not call.”\n\nNow that she will never call, he remembers affectionately the Marilyn he knew. With strangers she was essentially retiring, but to him she was tender, outgoing and unfailingly understanding.\n\n“She helped a great many people,” he said proudly, “and their names will never be known. She was charitable because there was charity in her heart, not because she wanted thanks.”\n\nHe remembered, too, the restless Marilyn: “She would always be jumping up to fix the curtains; she concentrated on little things. She didn't sit still long enough to give herself a chance to think.”\n\nThen there was the mercurial Marilyn, who seemed to be two personalities rather than one. “For want of a better description,” he said, “I called the one the Irish Marilyn and the other the American Marilyn.” While the Irish Marilyn was dreamy and poetic, he saw the American Marilyn as efficient and self-reliant.\n\nHe remembers Marilyn as he first saw her. It was at the opening of A View from the Bridge, a play written by Arthur Miller, his son. Then Marilyn was just another movie star to him. He stood at a distance while his wife, Gussie (Augusta), went right up to Miss Monroe and introduced herself as “Arthur Miller's mother.”\n\nMrs. Miller reported that a restrained Marilyn had said only, “I admire Mr. Miller's plays. I'm a first-nighter at all of them.” But Marilyn knew then what the Millers did not know yet— that she was going to marry their son.\n\nSix months later, the movie star sat in the kitchen of the Millers’ house on East Third Street, near Avenue M, in Brooklyn, N.Y. She wore no makeup. An unpretentious gray skirt, a high-collared black blouse and a scarf covering her hair added to her casual manner.\n\n“This is the girl I'm going to marry,” Arthur Miller told his parents.\n\n“‘Have they weighed this step carefully?’ was our only thought,” Mr. Miller told me. He added wistfully, “We thought it would be for a lifetime, not just for a few years.”\n\nThough Marilyn was part-Irish, part-Scottish, part-Norwegian and a Protestant, she persuaded Dr. Robert Goldberg, a leading New England reformed rabbi, to tutor her in the Jewish religion and customs because Arthur Miller is Jewish. “Do you mind if we marry in the Jewish faith?” she asked his parents.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller in 1956.\n\nAt the wedding Rabbi Goldbert asked, “Marilyn, if you have a sister, introduce me to her.” “But,” Isadore Miller recalls, “there was nobody from her side there.”\n\n“My wife,” says Mr. Miller, “cooked wonderful dinners and Marilyn learned from her to make Jewish delicacies like gefilte fish, knoedel and borscht. Marilyn would never return from a trip without a gift for us.” Then he showed me an umbrella she had brought him from London.\n\nWhen the senior Millers visited Marilyn and Arthur in their East 57th Street apartment they often met people like actor Montgomery Clift and actress Maureen Stapleton. “There was good talk there,” Mr. Miller reminisces, “about books and plays. Everybody sat on the floor. Marilyn often talked of the late Marie Dressler, whom she remembered from her youth, and whom she admired more than any other actress.”\n\nMarilyn, in turn, visited her father- and mother-in-law. One day a crowd followed her car clear to the end of their block. “It was a very hot day,” Mr. Miller recalls, “and the Good Humor man sold out all of his ice cream.”\n\nAt a family gathering at sister-in-law Joan’s apartment, Marilyn sang \"Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend.\" As Mr. Miller put it, “The room was full of people. But Marilyn turned only to me, asking ‘How did you like it, Dad?’”\n\nShe also began reading her poetry to him. “The poetry was only fair,” he says, “but when she asked, ‘How do you like it, Dad?’ I read the signs of her growing concern for my opinion.\"\n\nMarilyn Monroe leans over the balcony of New York City’s Ambassador Hotel in 1955.\n\nThis closeness became more apparent one night when the senior Millers were visiting at the East 57th Street apartment. They were relaxing after dinner. “Marilyn,” says Mr. Miller, “jumped up and placed a footstool under my feet. I dozed. When I woke up, she was untying my shoelaces and was about to take my shoes off.”\n\n“‘I am not an old man,’ I joked. ‘Nor an invalid. Don’t do it again.’”\n\n“‘Nothing is too good for you, Dad,’ she replied.”\n\nHe knew that before she achieved fame, her life had often been hard and unhappy. He hoped that now that they were becoming closer she would talk to him of her past. “But,” he says, “she clung to the present. Of her earlier life, I only knew what I could read.”\n\nHe sensed that her childhood had been a lonely odyssey to find a father. She sought, but never found, the father she had never known. She hoped that one of her long succession of foster fathers would give her the security of adoption, but none ever did.\n\nFinding a father at least by marrying into the Miller family in 1956, she was in danger of losing him four-and-a-half years later, when a divorce decree, obtained in Juarez, Mexico, made her the ex-Mrs. Arthur Miller. But she took the initiative in making Isadore Miller closer to her than ever.\n\nWhen, for instance, she heard of her ex-mother-in-law’s sudden death, Marilyn came to the funeral, sat with the mourners and all through the service held and patted the hand of her beloved “Dad.”\n\n“She had just been discharged from a hospital herself,” he told me, “but she asked ‘Dad, shall I come to the cemetery?’ In all my grief, I replied, ‘Marilyn, you’ve been sick, don’t come.”\n\nMr. Miller, himself under heavy sedation, had gone to the funeral from a hospital where he was a pre-operative patient. After the service, he returned for his operation. “While I was in the hospital,” he told me, “Marilyn called me every day from Hollywood. She kept wiring flowers and phoning my doctor, ‘Do everything to save him,’ she said. ‘He’s such a wonderful person.’”\n\nWhen Mr. Miller got well, Marilyn and he were united in mutual loneliness. She would call him at his daughter Joan’s apartment, where he was then living.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and her then husband, Arthur Miller, leave Doctors Hospital in August 1957. Marilyn was reported exhausted after losing her child, which had been expected in March.\n\n“Dad, what are you doing tonight?” Marilyn would ask.\n\n“What I did last night,” was his way of saying, “I’m doing nothing.”\n\nThat would be her cue to ask him to dinner in the East 47th Street apartment, which she still maintained.\n\nIn the apartment, she would ask, “Dad, how are you feeling?”\n\n“I feel fine,” he would reply.\n\n“Lonesome at times?” she would ask.\n\n“Lonesome all the time,” he would answer.\n\nDuring these quiet evenings with Marilyn, he found her a person who took life seriously. She shared with him a love of children, a love that was the more poignant because she could have no children of her own. She enjoyed his stories of how the children on his street had dubbed him “Mayor of the Block” because he gave them lollipops, as well as a doghouse. He also paid them a penny for every ant they picked up in his garden. She had a warm relationship with the children from Arthur Miller’s first marriage — Janie, now 17, and Bob, 15. Her correspondence with them continued even after the divorce.\n\nAbove all, she was happy with “Dad” because he thought of her not simply as a star or a beautiful woman, but as a wonderful human being. She began turning to him for advice. He was glad that she did because he was worried about how she would handle her business affairs now that she was a single woman again. “Marilyn,” he told her, “try to save your money. We’re not young all the time.”\n\n“Dad, don’t worry about me,” she said, “I know how to take care of things. I have to know.”\n\nHe was relieved that she felt that way, and happy she was confident that her agents and managers were doing the best for her.\n\nShe consulted “Dad” about her plans before forming them. When, for instance, she thought of buying a house, she talked it over with him first. Then, when she bought it, she told him, “I purposely bought a house with a guest room so that you can come out and stay as long as you like. I know you’ll love it.”\n\nMarilyn Monroe at home in Los Angeles in 1956.\n\nDespite her repeated urgings, however, “Dad” would put off going. He told her that she would be working and he would be in the way. She talked of Saturdays and Sundays when they could be together and even suggested that he could watch when she was at work.\n\n“I dare you to come,” she said on one occasion, as her plane was about to take off.\n\n“I have no clothes with me,” he protested.\n\n“For money you can get honey,” she replied promptly.\n\nWhen he was vacationing in Florida in February, 1962, she surprised him with a telegram, saying:\n\n“ARRIVING EASTERN AIRLINES FLIGHT 505 AT 9:05 TONIGHT. HAVE RESERVATIONS AT FONTAINEBLEAU. LOVE YOU. MARILYN.”\n\nAs he waited at the airport for her plane, a man asked him whom he was expecting. “Marilyn Monroe,” he replied.\n\n“I could see,” he reminisces, “that the man was aghast that such an old man was waiting for Marilyn Monroe.”\n\nWhen the plane arrived, the stranger, who had gone up to meet his wife, saw Marilyn standing amid five pieces of luggage.\n\n“There’s a tall, elderly man looking for you,” he told her.\n\n“That’s Mr. Miller,” Marilyn replied, “I came to Florida to see him.”\n\nThe crowded hours that followed found the world’s most famous girl and her “Dad” having dinner at the Hotel Fountainebleau’s Club Gigi and watching the show in the Cabaret Minaret at the Sea Isle, where he was staying.\n\n“The show wasn’t so good that night,” he told me, “but when I suggested that we leave, Marilyn protested vehemently, ‘We can’t do that. It’d hurt the performers’ feelings.’”\n\nThen they walked along Collins Avenue, talking all the while. Many people recognized Marilyn even without her makeup and pushed for her autograph.\n\n“Why do you let yourself be put upon that way?” Dad asked her.\n\n“When they stop doing that,” she replied, “I’m finished.”\n\nThey were in her $125-a-day suite at the Fountainebleau when the hotel manager telephoned to say that “there are some blue bloods downstairs who would love to meet you— and Mr. Miller.” Marilyn looked at “Dad” questioningly before replying.\n\n“Marilyn,” he told her, “you look tired. Why don’t you rest up?”\n\nShe took his advice because she had a child’s deep need for it. Telling the manager that they would not be down, the star did as “Dad” directed.\n\nWhen Mr. Miller brought some people to the Fountainebleau to meet Marilyn, she served drinks and snacks. As the dinner hour approached, she took “Dad” aside and said, “I’m going to ask them to dinner.”\n\n“You don’t have to do that,” Mr. Miller told her.\n\n“They’re with you,” she said.\n\n“They’re only casual friends,” he reminded her.\n\nBut Marilyn insisted and took them all to dinner.\n\nWhen the company left they sat quietly for a time in Marilyn’s suite. “Dad,” she said finally, “can you take a shock?”\n\n“It’s not the first shock I’ve taken,” he told her.\n\n“You know,” she said, “Arthur’s getting married tonight.”\n\nArthur Miller married photographer Inge Morath in 1962.\n\nSeeing that “Dad was upset, she added quickly: “I’m sure a letter must be on its way.”\n\n“You see,” Mr. Miller told me, “Marilyn wanted to make me feel right. She wanted to me to protect her, but she also protected me.”\n\nWhen he had left her room, he could $200 in the pocket of the coat he had hung in her closet. “When I got back to the Sea Isle,” he said, “I called her because I wanted to return the money.”\n\n“I know. You spent more than that on me,” she protested. “Do me a favor and take it. I won’t feel right if you don’t.”\n\nThe memory of the gay Marilyn of the Florida interlude was dimmed for “Dad” in May when he read a newspaper headline that stated she was not well.\n\nThen he was shocked when he heard how she had held up production of a movie at Twentieth Century-Fox.\n\nRepeatedly, he had urged her to take a long rest “because you look and feel better when you’re not working.” But now he telephoned her to offer comfort.\n\n“Please don’t worry about me, Dad,” she told him. “It’s all for the best. I’m feeling great.”\n\nLater that month she asked him to be her date at President Kennedy’s birthday celebration at New York’s Madison Square Garden, where she was scheduled to sing “Happy Birthday, Mr. President.”\n\nMarilyn Monroe sings \"Happy Birthday\" to President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in 1962.\n\nBefore going to the Garden, she insisted up on rehearsing the song for “Dad.”\n\nWhen he told her “it wounds too low,” she tried again. Only when he was satisfied with her rendition did they leave for a reception at the Four Seasons restaurant. She told him to come backstage at the Garden after her song.\n\nWhen she saw him, she immediately introduced him to the President as “my former father-in-law.” Then, realizing that she had made a faux pas, she apologized. “I should have said, ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President,’ but I was so excited about Dad that I introduced him first.”\n\nLater that evening at a private party for leaders in government and the theater, where everyone was standing, Marilyn managed to get Dad a chair.\n\n“Sit down, Dad,” she said.\n\n“I can’t sit when everybody else is standing,” he protested.\n\n“Sit,” she said, “I want you to.”\n\nWhen “Dad” complied, Marilyn kneeled beside him.\n\n“She was very beautiful,” he recalls.\n\nShe also insisted upon taking him home. At his elevator they kissed goodby. But, as she was stepping out of the front door, she turned and came back.\n\n“Dad,” she urged, “come back to the Coast with me tomorrow.”\n\n“Later Marilyn,” he promised. “Maybe in November.”\n\nThough they talked again many times, this was the last time they saw each other.\n\nNow that she is gone he still remembers her warmth, incandescence and vitality. Together they dwelt in many mansions of the spirit."
