        "text": "There’s always plenty happening in the world of real estate, from exciting listings formerly owned by stars like Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller, to new luxury developments unveiling in New York and Miami.\n\nIn this roundup, AD PRO has everything you need to know.\n\nOn the Market\n\nJoe Cocker’s Colorado ranch goes on sale for $18 million\n\nJoe Cocker may have died in 2014, but you can connect with a piece of the British rocker’s spirit: His 316-acre estate in western Colorado is on the market for $18 million.\n\nThe “You Are So Beautiful” singer styled Mad Dog Ranch after the Tudor estates of his native England. It was built for him and his wife, Pam Baker, in 1994 by award-winning architect John D. Kelley.\n\nLiv Sotheby’s International Realty’s Dan Dockray, who has the listing, called its attention to detail “uncompromising.” “The home is luxurious beyond expectations and yet still feels comfortable and unpretentious, an outstanding combination of vision executed in a dramatic setting,” Dockray told Forbes.\n\nThe 15,873-square-foot main home and guesthouse include an astonishing 15 bedrooms and an equal number of baths, plus Cocker’s extensive art and book collections, his piano and gold record, and an antique snooker table that once belonged to King Edward VII.\n\nMad Dog Ranch is located in Crawford, Colorado, in the West Elk Mountains, about 100 miles from both Aspen and Telluride. In addition to the main buildings, the property is home to verdant gardens, twin water slides that feed into a huge swimming pool, horse stables, 60 acres of pastures, and miles of hiking and riding trails.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller’s New York love nest for sale\n\nA classic seven on the Upper East Side where playwright Arthur Miller and his movie icon bride, Marilyn Monroe, once lived is on the market. Originally offered for $3.75 million back in May, the three-bedroom condo at 444 E 57th Street near Sutton Place has been relisted for $3.05 million with realtor Harriet Maisel of Brown Harris Stevens.\n\nAt nearly 2,200 square feet, the spacious 13th-floor unit comes with two wood-burning fireplaces, a formal dining room that seats 10, and a primary bedroom with views of the East River.\n\nThe building, designed by renowned New York architect Lafayette Goldstone, dates to 1927.\n\nThe Hollywood couple lived there in the late 1950s (it’s where Miller wrote The Misfits), but they aren’t the building’s only celebrity alumni: Singer Bobby Short and Sweden’s Princess Madeleine both had apartments there, and fashion designer Bill Blass once lived in a penthouse.\n\nUnder Armour honcho Kevin Plank selling rustic Utah getaway for $21.5M\n\nUnder Armour founder Kevin Plank is letting go of his Park City, Utah, ski chalet for a whopping $21.5 million.\n\nThe five-bedroom, seven-bath penthouse, part of the Montage Deer Valley development near the Wasatch Mountains, offers nearly 6,900 square feet of living space.\n\nInside, a private elevator leads to a massive great room that can accommodate a dozen friends après-ski. Designed by Patrick Sutton, a designer from Plank’s native Baltimore, the “Silver Mine” is festooned in rough-hewn timbers, shimmering onyx, and custom leather fabrics.\n\nJoin Now\n\nBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month.\n\nArrow\n\nIt’s Old West “mixed with a touch of Bond villain lair,” as the listing describes.\n\nOther highlights of Penthouse 1182 include a primary bedroom with a fireplace and platform tub, a game room with wet bar and pool table, and an open floor plan offering breathtaking views of the Daly Chutes at Deer Valley.\n\nThe aerie’s most unique element, though, is its “bunk room,” modeled after a luxury railcar. It sleeps up to eight, with each bunk named after a notorious outlaw and outfitted with its own entertainment system.\n\nResidents get access to room service, valet parking, ski lockers, indoor and outdoor pools, and other first-class Montage Deer Valley amenities.\n\nFirst Look\n\nODA Interiors designs 2200 Brickell\n\nNew York–based ODA has unveiled interior renderings for 2200 Brickell, a five-story Miami condo from Aria Development and Revuelta Architecture International, which also designed the Aston Martin Residences along Biscayne Bay.\n\nPlaster and concrete backgrounds contrast warm oak paneling throughout the 136,000-square-foot building, with shared spaces furnished with eclectic pieces that would befit a modern private home.\n\nIn the residences themselves, bedrooms and living areas are linked by private outdoor spaces and take full advantage of ample natural light. A mixture of geometric and organic shapes “gives residents a sense of balance and calm,” according to a release.\n\nWhen completed in late 2025, 2200 Brickell will have 105 residences ranging from one-bedroom units to four-bedroom garden villas, with pricing starting at $1 million.\n\nThomas Juul-Hansen’s model units unveiled at One11 Residences\n\nGFI Development is presenting four model residences by Danish architect Thomas Juul-Hansen for One11 Residences, the condo property encompassing the top nine floors of the Thompson Central Park hotel.\n\nThe turnkey packages offer a choice between a light color scheme or a darker palette, both showcasing the property’s elevated interiors and breathtaking views of Billionaires Row and Central Park.\n\n“We focused on contemporary lines and rich materiality to reflect the iconic midtown Manhattan surroundings,” Juul-Hansen tells AD PRO. “The result evokes the classic glamour of New York while also creating a modern and comfortable home for future residents.”\n\nKnown for his work on the Beekman Residences and Sutton Tower, Juul-Hansen outfitted the apartments with his first residential furniture and lighting collection—allowing him, he said, “to create a sophisticated atmosphere that is still warm and inviting.”\n\nFurnishings include Scandinavian-style pieces upholstered with English wool and Foglizzo Italian leather, as well as Loloey rugs, Phillip Jeffries wallpaper, and homewares from Duxiana, Mette Ditmer, and Fable.\n\nLocated at 111 West 56th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, One11 Residences offers 99 one- and two-bedroom condos and 2 four-bedroom penthouses. Prices start at $1.325 million.\n\nSales Launch\n\nThe Chatsworth is reborn in the Upper West Side\n\nDouglas Elliman has commenced sales of a select number of prewar cooperative conversions at The Chatsworth, a 12-story building located at West 72nd Street and Riverside Drive in New York City.\n\nThe first phase includes 10 units with architectural design and interiors by Pembroke & Ives.\n\nBuilt in 1904 by architect John E. Scharsmith, the Chatsworth is a National Historic Landmark and, per Douglas Elliman’s Kathy Murray, is “the epitome of Beaux Arts design”—though its 50 residences have been given new life with remodeled interiors.\n\nAvailable residences comprise one- to five-bedroom units spanning approximately 1,042 to 4,038 square feet. Pricing for phase one ranges from $1,850,000 to $8,350,000, with penthouse and townhome sales being launched in a second phase.\n\nMilestones\n\nNew tower approved for the Upper East Side\n\nThe Torkian Group has received approval for a $145 million construction loan to continue development of 250 East 83rd Street, a 370-foot mixed-use property designed by SLCE Architects with interiors by Lemay+Escobar.\n\nThe funding comes from Valley National Bank, according to real estate data firm PincusCo, following an earlier $15.7 million loan for the project from Signature Bank.\n\nTorkian initially submitted plans for the 31-story mixed-use property last year. It’s now slated to include 6,500 square feet of commercial space and 128 residential units, the Real Deal reported.\n\nPreviously, the site was home to a five-story walk-up from 1910. Excavation began in May at the southwest corner of 83rd Street and Second Avenue in Yorkville.\n\nIn filings, Torkian indicated it expects the building to be completed in May 2025."
