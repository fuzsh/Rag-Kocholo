        "text": "From LLNYC: While this charming home in Westchester, New York comes with a strong celebrity pedigree, it’s not exactly an auspicious one. It once served as the site where none other than Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller married in 1956. Their marriage didn’t end so well, but hey, the house is still really nice!\n\nIt was in fact the home of Miller’s agent, Kay Brown; Monroe and Miller had already married in a civil ceremony in White Plains, New York, and they hosted a small, traditional Jewish wedding two days later in the house. Soon after their wedding, Monroe discovered that Miller had written in his journal that he regretted marrying her, which (obviously) put some strain on their marriage. Monroe suffered from miscarriages and later drug use during their time together, and couple divorced five year later.\n\nLocated in Waccabuc, New York, the home is on the market with Susan Stillman of Houlihan Lawrence and is asking $1.675 million. It has four bedrooms, five full bathrooms, parquet floors, French doors, fireplaces, a pool and a pool house."
