        "text": "Description\n\nOne-of-a-kind dual-signed 1957 photo of honeymooners Monroe and Miller\n\nVintage matte-finish 8 x 10 first-generation candid photo of the newly wed Monroe and Miller during their Jamaican honeymoon in 1957, signed in black ink, “Warmest Regards, Marilyn Monroe Miller” and “Arthur Miller.” Permanently affixed to a same sized scrapbook page. With some minor creasing and silvering confined to edges and corners, not affecting the overall image and bold signatures, otherwise in fine condition.\n\nSix months after marrying at the Westchester County Court House in White Plains, New York, Monroe and Miller celebrated their honeymoon by flying to the Caribbean on January 3, 1957. Before returning to the states two weeks later, the couple spent several days at Moon Point, Jamaica, living it up at the luxurious villa of English aristocrat Lady Pamela Bird. This dual-signed photo serves as a rare passing glimpse of the couple at their most ebullient, and a bittersweet departure from a relationship that would grow increasingly tumultuous, culminating with Monroe’s final completed film—the Miller-penned Misfits. Pre-certified PSA/DNA.\n\nAuction Info\n\nAuction Title: Remarkable Rarities Auction\n\nDates: #461 - Ended September 27, 2015\n\nThis item is Pre-Certified by PSA/DNA\n\nBuy a third-party letter of authenticity for $150.00\n\n*This item has been pre-certified by a trusted third-party authentication service, and by placing a bid on this item, you agree to accept the opinion of this authentication service.
