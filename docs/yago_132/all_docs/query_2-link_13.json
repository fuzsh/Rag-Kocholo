        "text": "Arthur Miller, the renowned playwright, and Marilyn Monroe, the glamorous actress, met in 1951 and quickly became inseparable. Despite coming from very different backgrounds, they were both driven by a shared ambition and passion for their craft. As their relationship progressed, they got married in 1956, making headlines across the world.\n\nWho was Marilyn Monroe?\n\nMarilyn Monroe, born Norma Jeane Mortenson, was an American actress, singer, model, and cultural icon. She rose to fame in the 1950s, becoming one of the world‚Äôs most popular sex symbols. During her lifetime, Monroe was acclaimed for her comedic timing, performances, and beauty. Her films such as ‚ÄòGentlemen Prefer Blondes‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Seven Year Itch‚Äô and ‚ÄòSome Like It Hot‚Äô have been inducted into the National Film Registry.\n\nShe is also remembered for her celebrated marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. Today, she continues to be a powerful symbol of Hollywood glamour, captivating people across the globe with her radiant personality and captivating beauty. Her iconic style and mannerisms have been studied and imitated by actors and actresses since her death in 1962.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller first met in 1951, when Arthur visited Hollywood with his wife Mary Slattery. At the time, Marilyn was between her first and second marriages, with James Dougherty, who she was with from 1942 to 1946, and Joe DiMaggio who she married in 1954 and divorced in 1955.\n\nArthur was a successful writer, who had written ‚ÄúDeath of a Salesman,‚Äù which Marilyn greatly admired. They became friends and Marilyn soon started consulting Arthur on her career. Their friendship blossomed over the years, and it wasn‚Äôt long before they started seeing each other romantically.\n\nMarilyn and Arthur had a deep respect and admiration for each other‚Äôs talents. For Marilyn, Arthur was someone she could talk to about her hopes and dreams, and get advice from. For Arthur, he saw Marilyn as an opportunity to help her realize her dreams and make them a reality. She also provided him with a new lease of life, after years of writing and struggling to get his work recognized.\n\nIn addition to this, they were both intelligent, creative, and sensitive individuals, and it is thought that these shared traits helped draw them together.\n\nIn June 1956, the two were married, despite the age difference between them (she was 28, and he was 41). They enjoyed a passionate marriage, going on holidays together, attending award ceremonies and events, and generally just enjoying each other‚Äôs company.\n\nDivorce\n\nHowever, their marriage was not without its challenges. One such instance occurred when the actress discovered a list of reasons, written by her husband, that explained why it might be not be a smart decision to marry to her. Marilyn also found out about many of Miller‚Äôs affairs, including with Inge Morath, a woman he met while on the set of The Misfists. This betrayal was even more powerful given that the film was specifically written so that Marilyn could enjoy a more serious acting role.\n\nIn 1961, despite reports that the couple was trying to reconcile their differences, they filed for divorce.\n\nMarilyn and Arthur‚Äôs marriage ultimately ended due to disagreements over their careers and different expectations of each other. As Marilyn‚Äôs fame increased so too did the demands on her time, leading to arguments between them over her commitments to her career.\n\nAs well as this, Arthur had hoped that their marriage would lead to him being accepted into high society, something which Marilyn was unwilling to do. This led to further arguments and, eventually their divorce in 1961.\n\nArthur Miler and Inge Morath\n\nArthur Miller‚Äôs third marriage was to Inge Morath, a German-Austrian photographer. The two met in 1957 when Miller was in Europe for the filming of The Misfits, in which Marilyn Monroe starred. After his divorce from Marilyn, he and Inge married in 1962. Throughout their marriage, they had two children together and they remained together until his death in 2005.\n\nInge had a successful career as a photographer, and Arthur was very supportive of her work. They both traveled extensively and documented their experiences in photography and literature. Inge was with Arthur throughout his battle with lung cancer and also cared for him during his final days. This loving relationship stands out as one of Arthur‚Äôs longest and happiest, lasting forty-three years until his death in 2002.\n\nFAQs"
