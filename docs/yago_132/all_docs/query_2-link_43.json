        "text": "The only thing the movie-going public likes more than an onscreen drama is a real one. The ‘Hollywood romance’ is about as intoxicating an idea as there is - sexy, glamorous, on an epic scale and with an epic love story behind it. And no one did it with as much style as the Old Hollywood starlets, in an era of studio-decided romances, of huge individual fame before the crowded stage of modern celebrity and influencers competing for the limelight. These couples would unite on – and off – screen to show everyone else how it was done; or stars would marry literary royalty, political royalty and actual royalty, and reach dizzying heights of importance.\n\nNetflix’s new film Blonde portrays Marilyn Monroe in two different it-couples, first with baseball star Joe DiMaggio, with whom she embodied young All-American ease before they split over her seductive publicity stunts, and then, unexpectedly, with enigmatic playwright Arthur Miller. Below, Tatler profiles Monroe and Miller, and six other couples who captured the public imagination in the 1950s and 1960s - and who continue to do so today."
