        "text": "On this day in 1947 American playwright and Pulitzer Prize winner Arthur Miller won a Tony award for his play “All My Sons”.\n\nMiller was married four times including to film idol Marilyn Monroe. His life was also defined by his battle with the communist-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee. He steadfastly refused to give any names of people suspected of communist sympathies and was convicted of contempt of Congress (this was later quashed). He afterwards wrote ‘The Crucible’ about the Salem witch hunts, as a parody of the persecution that he had undergone.\n\nHere are some lines from Sophocles play about Antigone, daughter of Oedipus, who bravely died for her principles:\n\nKING CREON. Didst thou, then, dare to disobey these laws?\n\nANTIGONE. Yes, for it was not Zeus who gave them forth,\n\nNor Justice, dwelling with the Gods below,\n\nWho traced these laws for all the sons of men;\n\nNor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,\n\nComing from mortal man, to set at naught\n\nThe unwritten laws of God that know not change.\n\nThey are not of to-day nor yesterday,\n\nBut live for ever, nor can man assign\n\nWhen first they sprang to being. Not through fear\n\nOf any man’s resolve was I prepared\n\nBefore the Gods to bear the penalty\n\nOf sinning against these. That I should die\n\nI knew (how should I not?), though thy decree\n\nHad never spoken. And, before my time\n\nIf I should die, I reckon this a gain;\n\nFor whoso lives, as I, in many woes,\n\nHow can it be but death shall bring him gain?\n\nAnd so for me to bear this doom of thine has nothing painful."
