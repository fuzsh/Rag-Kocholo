        "text": "As the throng of reporters gathered in anticipation, a striking woman in a buttoned-down blouse calmly pattered her styled blonde curls and walked towards the microphones.\n\nIt was June 29, 1956, and early spring when Hollywood darling Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller, her fiancé and famed American playwright, fronted members of the press on Miller’s rural farm in Roxbury, Connecticut, in upstate New York.\n\nJust hours after the crowds scattered, the unlikely couple sneaked away from public view and quietly wed. This month marks 66 years since that day.\n\nMonroe and Miller had a few chance meetings before their wedding day. They met in 1950 on the set of the then 24-year-old Californian actress's film As Young As You Feel.\n\nREAD MORE: Campaigner Deborah James dies from bowel cancer aged 40\n\nMiller, then 35, first encountered Monroe in tears, distraught over the death of Johnny Hyde, her agent and keen admirer. Hyde died of a heart attack at just 55.\n\nDespite the moments of sorrow, the pair left quite the impression on each other.\n\n\"Met a man tonight … It was, bam! It was like running into a tree,\" she wrote in her diary.\n\n\"You know, like a cool drink when you've had a fever.\"\n\nMiller recalled their first meeting in his autobiography, Timebends.\n\n\"When we shook hands,\" he wrote, \"the shock of her body's motion sped through me.\"\n\nThe pair would meet again a few days later at a party.\n\nThey talked for hours, Miller taking on board Monroe's desire to be a serious actress. He told her she could take on Broadway and suggested she take acting classes.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tipped for second bombshell interview\n\nYet, with the pair married to other people, the timing of a union wasn't meant to be.\n\nMiller was married to his high school sweetheart Mary Slattery and Monroe was weathering a difficult relationship to second husband and baseball legend Joe DiMaggio.\n\nMonroe and DiMaggio divorced in 1954 after just months of marriage.\n\nMonroe and Miller kept in contact through letters and phone calls. They wouldn't see each other again for four years.\n\nMiller was intensely romantic, borderline achingly melancholic, with his words to her.\n\n“I think I shall be less furiously jealous when we have made a life together. It is just that I believe that I should really die if I ever lost you,\" one of his letters read.\n\n\"It is as though we were born the same morning, when no other life existed on this earth. Love, Art.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Start this savings plan today to save $1,780 by Christmas\n\nBy 1955, the pair had began secretly dating after Miller learned Monroe had moved to his home town of New York City for work. To the outside world, they were just friends.\n\nIn February 1956, the actress officially changed her name from Norma Jeane Mortenson to Marilyn Monroe. Monroe wished her married name to be Monroe-Miller.\n\nNot long after, Miller, who was similarly as famous as Monroe for his Pulitzer Prize-winning play Death of a Salesman, would finalise his divorce from his first wife.\n\nThe public would not be made aware of their pending union until June, when Miller surprisingly announced to the House Un-American Activities Committee he and the Some Like It Hot star would soon wed.\n\nThe playwright was facing the committee over questions on his political leanings. Many believed his acclaimed 1953 play The Crucible and its Salem witch trials drew parallels with the communist witch-hunts of the 1950s.\n\nIn the media, the couple were affectionately known as the Hourglass and the Egghead, with the nickname use somewhat intensifying as their wedding day neared.\n\nOn June 28, 1956, Miller's local newspaper, the Roxbury Connecticut, ran a story on the pending nuptials with the unsentimental headline 'Local Resident Will Marry Miss Monroe of Hollywood'.\n\nDespite the lack of creativity or feeling, the story caused chaos for the couple, and cost the life of Mara Scherbatoff, the New York bureau chief for Paris-Match.\n\nScherbatoff was killed after the car she was travelling in crashed into a tree while chasing the car Miller and Monroe were riding.\n\nThe tragedy was what prompted the celebrity couple to hold a press conference on Miller's rural farm.\n\nAs Miller, then 40, addressed the media, the actress, then 30, stood by his side. The couple held hands throughout.\n\nHours later, the New York Times ran the breaking news that \"Marilyn Monroe, Arthur Miller Married in White Plains Court\".\n\nThe couple wed in the Westchester County Courthouse by a city judge.\n\n\"Miss Monroe wore a sweater and a skirt and no hat. Mr Miller wore a blue suit and a white shirt but no tie,\" the report said.\n\nMonroe was given away by her acting teacher Lee Strasberg. The couple's wedding rings were inscribed 'Now is forever'.\n\nThe newlyweds would leave the courthouse in a sports car and escape to London a few weeks later, where Monroe would film The Prince and the Showgirl.\n\nSadly, the marriage would not last. Their relationship soured after Monroe reportedly discovered in Miller's notebook that he had misgivings about her celebrity, which, he felt, had the potential to threaten his creativity.\n\nA series of miscarriages, three in a number of years, is also said to have contributed to the unhappy state the couple morphed into.\n\nMonroe also reportedly told friends Miller also wrote: \"The only one I will ever love is my daughter\".\n\nOn November 12, 1960 the Times ran with the news the couple had separated and planned to divorce after four years of marriage.\n\nThey had just completed the film The Misfits together, Monroe starring in the screenplay Miller had written.\n\nIn August 1962, almost two years after her and Miller's separation and divorce, Monroe was found dead in Brentwood home in California. She was 36.\n\nThe playwright remarried in February 1962 to Austrian photographer, Inge Morath. He died of congestive heart failure in 2005. He was 89.\n\nIn a documentary on the late playwright, released in 2021, Miller spoke about his love for Monroe and her fragility.\n\n\"This appearance of being absolutely free was simply a disguise. She was, in a way, the most repressed person imaginable,\" he says.\n\n\"She had been kicked around as a child, she’d been abused as a child. She had been deserted, abandoned. She was a very courageous human being.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
