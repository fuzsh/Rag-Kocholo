        "text": "Miller confided in her that he was deeply unhappy in his marriage, and told her to expect his return.\n\nIt would take four years before the pair would be reunited when Monroe moved to New York City to study.\n\nBetween their meetings, Monroe had gotten married and divorced from her second husband Joe DiMaggio, but Miller was still married.\n\nThis did not stop the duo from embarking on an affair although they did attempt secrecy in the beginning before Monroe’s career skyrocketed which saw the press paying closer attention to her.\n\nIn 1956, the reluctant Miller embarked on the process of getting a divorce and submitted a passport application so that he could join Monroe who was due to film in England.\n\nInstead of receiving a passport, Miller was brought to the House of Un-American Activities Committee to testify about his ties to communism.\n\nHowever, this euphoria would not last for the starlet as she found notes Miller had written concerning her and their marriage, explaining his disappointment and second-guessing.\n\nThis proved not enough to devastate her love, however, and Monroe tried to assume a housewife role upon returning home.\n\nDuring their marriage Monroe suffered multiple miscarriages, blaming herself and her addictions for them.\n\nMiller’s patience for the young starlet was also growing thin, as he found it increasingly difficult to get the peace and quiet he needed to write."
