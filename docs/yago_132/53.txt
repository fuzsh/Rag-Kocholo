On June 29th 1956 Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller held a press conference at Miller’s house in Roxbury, Connecticut, to announce their marriage.

The couple married at the Westchester County Court House in nearby White Plains with no press or others present. A traditional Jewish rite later went ahead on July 1st at the home of Miller’s agent, Kay Brown, near Katonah.

Marilyn was given away by her acting teacher Lee Strasberg. There were twenty-five guests, and the ceremony was performed by Rabbi Robert Goldberg.

The writer George Axelrod made a witty speech congratulating the happy couple and adapting George Bernard Shaw to wish that their children would have Arthur’s looks and Marilyn’s brains.

The newlyweds soon went off to London for the filming of The Prince and the Showgirl.

The couple was married from 29 June 1956 - 20 January 1961 - just give years.

Around 18-months after their divorce Marilyn was dead.
