On 30 December 1890 at White Clay Creek, SD, while executing an order to withdraw, seeing that a continuance of the movement would expose another troop of his regiment to being cut off and surrounded, he disregarded orders to retire, placed himself in front of his men, led a charge on the advancmg Native Americans, regained a commanding position that had just been vacated, and thus insured a safe withdrawal of both detachments without further loss. His Medal of Honor was issued on 22 September 1897.
