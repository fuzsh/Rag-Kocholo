The Medal of Honor was instituted on December 21, 1861, to recognise gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life and above and beyond the call of duty. It started its history as a Naval award, and was initially restricted to enlisted personnel in the United States Navy and Marines. An Army Medal of Honor followed on July 12, 1862, and was likewise restricted to enlisted personnel. The latter award was expanded to include army officers on March 3, 1863, although naval officers would remain ineligible until 1915. (1)

The first physical medals were issued to six survivors of ‘Andrew’s Raid’, an all volunteer mission which was targeted at disrupting rail communications in Confederate held Georgia. These were presented in Washington on March 25, 1863, with the first naval presentations taking place a few days later on April 3, 1863. A total number of 1,200 medals were awarded to army personnel for actions in the American Civil War, with a further 327 going to the navy and marines.(2) Many recipients did not receive recognition until decades after the conclusion of the conflict; the final recipients were two members of the 47th Ohio Infantry who received their awards in 1917.(3)

At least 146 Irish-born men received the Medal of Honor for services during the American Civil War, almost ten percent of the total number awarded. Of these, a number have only recently come to light as Irish-born, having initially been erroneously categorised as of unknown or American nativity. It is probable that this figure will increase as further research is conducted into the backgrounds of Medal of Honor recipients. Of the Irish awards, no fewer than fifty were awarded to Irishmen in the naval and marine service, just over fifteen percent of the total number for that category.

Studies of Irish participation in the American Civil War often focus on well-known ‘green flag’ units such as the Irish Brigade and Corcoran’s Irish Legion. However, the vast majority of Irish-born men served in non-Irish regiments or in the naval arm of the service. Perhaps understandably, their stories are often much harder to discover and explore. Analysis of the Irish-born Medal of Honor recipients brings some of these men to the fore. Indeed of the total number, fewer than twenty were members of ethnic Irish regiments.

Three of the Irishmen would eventually receive the award twice; Coxswain John Cooper of the U.S.S. Brooklyn for two separate actions in Mobile Bay, Alabama; Boatswain’s Mate Patrick Mullen for gallantry in action and lifesaving, both in 1865; Fireman John Laverty (Lafferty) for actions on the Roanoke River during the war with the second for bravery in peacetime, aboard the U.S.S. Alaska in 1881. Although instituted during the American Civil War, the earliest chronological award was to Irishman Assistant Surgeon Bernard J.D. Irwin for service at Apache Pass, Arizona in February 1861.(4) The chronologically earliest Irish award of the conflict was to Corporal Owen McGough for actions at the First Battle of Bull Run. The first Irish-born men to physically receive the Medal of Honor were all sailors, who were presented with the award on 3 April 1863.

A list of these 146 Irishmen appears below, together with their unit and the engagement at which they performed their act of heroism. This listing forms part of the Irish-born Medal of Honor Project.
