The National Endowment for the Humanities kindly sponsored this five-week event, which involved the participation of fifteen professors at differing stages of their careers. At the Clark Library, the library staff members were characteristically welcoming and supportive. Our thanks must go in particular to Bruce Whiteman, Carol Sommer, and Scott Jacobs for their assistance in making the materials in the library’s extensive Wilde collection available to the participants. Patrick Keilty, our library assistant, was unfailing in the efficiency with which he located and delivered items we requested. Our two research assistants, Noah Comet and Adam Seth Lowenstein, undertook many helpful tasks, including ferrying books from the main campus libraries to the Clark. The Center for Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Studies, which oversees all of the scholarly activities at the Clark Library, provided invaluable support in ensuring that the “The Wilde Archive” seminar was a success. I wish to express my appreciation to former director of the Center, Peter Reill, as well as past and present members of the Center’s staff – Elizabeth Landaw, Mark Pokorski, and Candis Snoddy – for their unfailing assistance. The Center administered all of the arrangements for the conference, “The Wilde Archive,” which arose from research projects that the seminar participants developed during the seminar. The proceedings of the conference, which took place on 29–30 May 2009, form the basis of the chapters that appear in the present volume. At the National Endowment for the Humanities, my program officer, Barbara Ashbrook, offered much helpful advice on the shape and\n\nxii\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nstructure of the seminar program. At UCLA, Ronjaunee Chatterjee and Justine Pizzo offered helpful research assistance. Several colleagues at the Clark Library provided assistance in preparing many of the images included in this volume. I am especially grateful to Jenny Bastian, Scott Jacobs, Derek Christian Quezada, Carol Sommer, and Suzanne Tatian for their attention to my various requests. Figures 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 11.1, 11.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 are from the archives of the Clark Library. Marie-Anne Verougstraete provided much-appreciated technical assistance with processing Figures 11.1 and 11.2. Figure 9.1 is reproduced with permission from the Punch Cartoon Library. Figures 10.4 and 10.5 are reproduced courtesy of ArtResource. Figures 10.1, 10.2, and 10.6 came from materials out of copyright that were either held at or ordered through the UCLA library system. My thanks go to Lois Cucullu, Reed Hutchinson, and Justine Pizzo for their assistance in identifying and reproducing several of the figures. I have benefited from tutoring in Ancient Greek by Cameron Fitzsimmons. I also want to thank Laurel Brake for accompanying me to Adam Spreadbury-Maher and Marc Urquhart’s brave production of Constance – a play based on a scenario Wilde sold to actress Cora Brown-Potter – at the King’s Head Theatre, London, in September 2011. This experience prompted many thoughts about the kinds of drama that Wilde might have written had he survived the nineteenth century. University of Michigan Press kindly granted permission to reprint portions of chapter 2, which appeared in an earlier version in Elizabeth Carolyn Miller, Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siècle (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2008), 182–222. A different version of chapter 6 appeared in Rachel Ablow, ed., The Feeling of Reading: Affective Experience and Victorian Literature (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2010). We are grateful to University of Michigan Press for permission to reprint a later draft of this chapter here. Sections of chapter 10 appeared in “Sleep Deprived and Ultra Modern: How Novels Turned Dream Girls into Insomniacs,” Novel: A Forum on Fiction 42.2 (2009): 138–44. Duke University Press has granted us permission to reprint materials that have appeared in Novel. Laura Sampson at Curtis Brown, London, offered helpful advice about the copyright on the works of A.J.A. Symons. We are especially grateful to Merlin Holland for generously granting permission for the reproduction of materials by Oscar Wilde that remain in copyright. At University of Toronto Press, Richard Ratzlaff offered thoughtful editorial advice. We remain grateful\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\nto the supportive observations that the three external readers made on the volume as a whole. For the purpose of economizing on the amount of documentation in the endnotes, the contributors to the present volume refer, wherever possible, in the main text to the Collected Works of Oscar Wilde, ed. Robert Ross, 14 vols. (London: Methuen, 1908), which remains the standard edition to this day. Where better modern editions of individual works exist, such as the New Mermaids editions of the Society comedies and the Oxford English Texts editions of the poetry, essays, and The Picture of Dorian Gray, the contributors make reference to them in the notes. Dates have been given for the earliest publication of Wilde’s writings, except in the case of his dramas, where the dates refer to the earliest production. All of the contributors to Wilde Discoveries: Traditions, Histories, Archives worked very closely with me on many different aspects of their chapters. I wish to acknowledge the extraordinary team spirit in which each and every one of us has collaborated to produce a collection that is very much the result of lively intellectual exchange about Oscar Wilde, his life, and his writing.

The purpose of the present volume is to reveal how our knowledge of this fascinating figure continues to expand in ways that scholars might not have predicted even a generation ago. The archive titled “Oscar Wilde and His Circle,” which is housed at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, remains the most significant resource for any researcher wishing to understand the finer details of Wilde’s eventful career. Originally assembled by a wealthy private collector from 1916 onward, the initial 8,000 volumes of the library, along with the specially designed building completed a decade later, came into the hands of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), when the owner died in 1934. This was, by any account, a remarkable treasure to deed to a public institution of higher learning still in its infancy, one that had acquired its current status only in 1929. It followed the substantial sums that William Andrews Clark Jr, one of the city’s major philanthropists, had donated to establish the Los Angeles Philharmonic.1 Ever since UCLA took responsibility for it, the library – whose major collections range across seventeenth- and eighteenth-century writing, fine printing, and early California history – has steadily added to the large quantity of letters, manuscripts, typescripts, presentation copies, first editions, and other precious documents that Clark purchased from agents who attended major sales of Wilde’s works in the 1920s. This unparalleled archive enables us to gain insights into such matters as Wilde’s sedulous methods of composition, his revealing\n\n4\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\ncorrections to proof copies, and his various lives as a fashionable celebrity, public lecturer, and prolific journalist, as well as one of the most fêted dramatists and storytellers of his time. Very little about Wilde’s personal and professional activities seems to be untouched by the hundreds of items, including playbills, caricatures, photographs, theatre receipts, and numerous other pieces of presumed ephemera, which occupy many square feet of library shelving. The Clark Library collection is more substantial than the secondlargest archive of this kind, which Douglas Hyde and Mary Hyde (later Viscountess Eccles) gathered from the early 1950s onward. In 1962, the Hydes acquired an extensive collection of Wilde material from H. Montgomery Hyde (no relation), whose many books on the Irish writer include the widely circulated Trials of Oscar Wilde (1948, revised 1962).2 The collection grew from there. Since 2003, the Eccles Bequest, which comprises more than 1,500 items, has been housed in the British Library, and since 2007 – when the cataloguing of this important collection was completed – scholars have enjoyed ready access to materials that throw further light on Wilde’s family, education, and contacts. As Nikolai Endres points out, some of the Eccles Bequest’s most intriguing documents beautifully integrate Wilde’s lavish wit and characteristic extravagance: “An 1891 menu from the Marguery restaurant shows his penchant for oysters, quail, ragout of roasted game, and beef sautéed with truffles; on the reverse he wrote his most (in)famous quip: ‘The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.’”3 Equally interesting items can be found at the J. Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City. In 2008, for example, the Morgan Library acquired a manuscript of Wilde’s short story, “The Selfish Giant” (1888), which is unexpectedly in his spouse’s handwriting. This document has raised speculation about the role that Constance Wilde, herself a talented adapter of children’s tales, might have played in the composition of a cherished fairy story traditionally attributed to her husband.4 Even though the Clark Library’s, British Library’s, and Morgan Library’s sizeable collections have much to disclose about even the minutest aspects of Wilde’s everyday existence, it is nevertheless true that the sheer quantity of documentation serves as a reminder of how much more about him there remains to be unearthed, as well as understood with greater accuracy. This point becomes evident when we turn to a standard work of reference in the field. Critics have for more than twenty-five years consulted Richard Ellmann’s finely written biography, Oscar Wilde (1987), to gain the most comprehensive understanding of the writer’s\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nhectic life. Yet this volume has always presented difficulties to specialists in the field. No sooner had Ellmann – whom Gore Vidal called “our time’s best academic biographer” – published this imposing work than scholars realized that it contained not only noticeable misquotations but also numerous errors of fact.5 In his review, Frank Kermode was quick to spot some of the more noticeable mistakes.6 To be sure, Ellmann completed his work on this major study while battling a fatal illness; it appears that it was not possible for him to check some of his sources before copyediting began. In any case, despite its hundreds of flaws, no subsequent biography has been able to match Oscar Wilde for the wealth of information it supplies. More to the point, it proves hard to overestimate the extraordinary contribution that Ellmann’s research quickly made to the unapologetic clarification of those aspects of Wilde’s career – especially the homosexual scandal that resulted in a brutal two-year sentence in solitary confinement with hard labour – that previous commentators had at times found embarrassing to discuss.7 Eager to stress Wilde’s relevance to our post-Victorian modernity, Ellmann refreshingly concludes his biography of a man who died before his time on an affirmative note: “Now, beyond the reach of scandal, his best writings validated by time, he comes before us still, a towering figure, laughing and weeping, with parables and paradoxes, so generous, so amusing, and so right.”8 Yet no matter how much one might applaud Ellmann’s praise for Wilde’s luminous irreverence, it remains impossible for any dedicated student of Wilde’s writings to depend on Oscar Wilde without consulting the exhaustive list of revisions and corrections that Horst Schroeder has compiled.9 (And, even then, some of Schroeder’s sedulous emendations to Ellmann’s scholarship have been subject to further rectification.10) Unquestionably, the time has come for a more thorough account of Wilde’s life, not least because the subsequent mass of research that Ellmann inspired has enabled us to comprehend more fully such matters as Wilde’s busy undergraduate career at Oxford, his year-long lecture tour of North America, his productive life as a journalist, and his sometimes tense negotiations with editors and publishers. The fact that since 2000 Oxford University Press has issued seven volumes in its variorum edition of Wilde’s collected works is a sure sign of how much concerted scholarly attention continues to be devoted to a writer whose critical value Ellmann’s research helped to increase. In school and college classrooms, too, several of Wilde’s works have become a staple part of the curriculum. The prominence of such writings as The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890, revised 1891) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) on\n\n6\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nsyllabi is betokened by the Modern Language Association’s publication of a timely volume, Approaches to Teaching the Works of Oscar Wilde (2008), which embraces his whole canon – from his effusive poetry of the 1870s to his best-selling protest against capital punishment, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898). That widely circulated literary magazines such as the New York Review of Books (NYRB) and The New Yorker have lately featured articles on not only his little-known published works but also his manuscripts suggests a broadening interest in some of the less familiar, though scarcely insignificant, aspects of Wilde’s professional endeavours.11 Wilde’s captivating life story, together with the increased critical value placed on his work, cannot keep him out of the public eye. It is perhaps no coincidence that on those recent occasions when previously unidentified documents by Wilde have come up for auction, prices have often exceeded well beyond their reserve. Yet whenever records of this kind come to public attention, the press still finds it hard not to indulge in unwarranted speculation about those aspects of Wilde’s private life that supposedly give the best account of his character. In 2010, for example, the sale of several letters from Wilde to Alsager Vian – the young editor of the fashionable Court and Society Review, where the author published a dozen or so pieces – encouraged the conservative British tabloid, the Daily Mail, to announce that this rather brief correspondence, which includes a polite invitation to Vian to join him for dinner as well as afternoon tea at home, “appear[s] to show the homosexual feelings of the great poet at a time when it was punishable by prison.”12 In all probability, these hardly flirtatious letters suggest that Wilde appreciates that Vian does not count among “the slave driving editors” who constantly made demands on him.13 Such phrasing intimates that a little hospitality on Wilde’s part might provide him with a reliable outlet for the reviews, stories, and poetry he needed to place in order to cope with growing household expenses. (Wilde’s correspondence with Vian cannot be compared with the unguarded letter that he sent as an “affectionate friend” to Cambridge undergraduate Henry Marillier, whom he had met through his friend Frank Miles six years before. Wilde confided to Marillier his interest in “the love of things impossible – ἔρώς τõν ἀδύνατον – l’amour impossible.”14 The euphemism, which Wilde drew from the work of homophile writer and Classicist John Addington Symonds, stresses the tabooed same-sex attraction that Wilde mistakenly assumed Marillier must share.15) Meanwhile, in the set of online responses attached to the Mail ’s distorted caption about Wilde’s “lovelorn letters to young magazine editor asking him to dinner,” “Peter” from Macclesfield, Cheshire, saw fit to pronounce: “Oscar Wilde was responsible for turning the love that dare not\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nspeak its name into the love that cannot shut up.”16 As this unpleasant wisecrack confirms, a strong part of Wilde’s popular legacy – at least within mass culture – is the memorable phrase he quoted from his lover Alfred Douglas’s poem, “Two Loves” (“the Love that dare not speak its name”), in his famous courtroom defence of men’s desire for other men.17 “Peter” is no doubt recalling Wilde’s eloquent statement, made in May 1895, that such unspeakable love is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare ... It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an elder and a younger man, when the elder man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks it and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.18\n\nWilde uttered these bold words, which allude to the disciplined intimacy between the ἐραστής (older lover) and the ἐρώμενος (younger beloved) in Plato’s dialogues, almost seventy years before sexual relations between men were partly decriminalized in England and Wales under the Sexual Offences Act (1967). As anyone (like “Peter”) who has heard of Wilde most probably knows, his passionate defence of “Greek love” was lost on a court that witnessed a parade of young men giving evidence that confirmed that Wilde was indeed a sodomite whose crimes meant he should be sent to jail for two years in solitary confinement. In many ways, it makes perfect sense to locate Wilde’s defence of l’amour de l’impossible (in the more accurate French rendition) at the start of the arduous political struggle to emancipate male homosexuality in Britain. This is arguably the most common perception of Wilde’s major legacy to modern culture, and it is one that Ellmann endorses when he confidently states that “[h]omosexuality ... was the major stage in [Wilde’s] discovery of himself.”19 Yet, as I point out in this Introduction, only recently have scholars been able to grasp more fully that Wilde’s courageous apology for men’s desire for intimacy with other men stemmed from an erudite intellect that might, had he wished, have thrived in the university world that still placed such a high premium on Classical learning. This is just one aspect of our deepening knowledge of a writer whose life could have readily taken many turns from the various paths he eventually followed. Certainly, during his twenties Wilde informed one of his closest peers at university: “I won’t be a dried-up Oxford don ... I’ll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist. Somehow or other, I’ll be famous,\n\n8\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nand if not famous, I’ll be notorious.”20 As this statement implies, even if he had decided against a scholarly life, the prospect of tutoring undergraduates, as well as undertaking advanced research on Ancient Greece, was well within his reach. His rare Double First in literæ humaniores (also known as “Greats”) eminently qualified him for such responsibilities. Subsequently, he sought employment as an educator, researcher, and translator. In 1879 he applied to Oxford don A.H. Sayce for a fellowship in archaeology at Athens, and he approached publisher George Macmillan to work on translations of Euripides and Herodotus. Both of these contacts were founders of the Hellenic Society, which had been established that year to promote the study of Ancient Greek culture as well as to create links with the Archaeological Society of Athens.21 Moreover, in the following decade Wilde’s mounting financial problems encouraged him to consider becoming an inspector of schools.22 In what follows, I begin by looking at several salient areas where critics have recently addressed fresh sources that help transform our established knowledge of Wilde’s academic training and its enduring legacy in his large and varied oeuvre. Wilde, after all, was a great writer whose earliest published works include a fine translation of a section from Classical comic playwright Aristophanes’s Clouds – one that the exacting A.E. Housman, who was saddened by Wilde’s imprisonment, found impressive.23 I proceed to consider some further recent discoveries that throw light on the innovative ways in which Wilde balanced his knowledge of “Greek love” against the constraints and opportunities of modern marriage, especially in a drama that he was planning before the trials disrupted his career. As he recalls in De Profundis, the autobiographical document he completed towards the close of his solitary confinement in jail, he held no illusions about his immense literary talent: “drama, novel, poem in rhyme, poem in prose, subtle or fantastic dialogue, whatever I touched I made beautiful in a new mode of beauty”; “I had genius,” he asserts defiantly.24 The debates raised in the present volume certainly endorse this forthright, though truthful, claim. Taken together, the thirteen chapters that follow participate in our developing understanding of the literary traditions, cultural histories, and archival resources that illuminate what Wilde knew, in the face of the severe punishment he endured for his sexual activities, were his prodigious achievements. Archival Discoveries In recent years, critics have been intrigued to learn more about Wilde’s education as a Classicist at Oxford, since much of his intensive study\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nof ancient languages and cultures, together with inquiries into modern philosophical traditions, exerts lasting influence on aspects of his later works. Daniel Mendelsohn, a regular contributor to the New York Review of Books, devoted considerable space in November 2010 to a limited edition of a noteworthy essay that Wilde had been developing on the women characters in Homer’s epics. The fine edition in question collates the drafts of an uncompleted 8,500-word critical discussion, which Wilde was composing during the summer vacation of 1876, when he spent time with artist Frank Miles at the family’s fishing lodge in Connemara, Ireland. That such a well-known magazine at the NYRB should feature an informed commentary on a document that had languished for years in the Morgan Library says much about the ways in which modern critics have sharpened their perceptions of Wilde’s intellectual gifts. In his manuscript, Wilde embarks on a thoughtful response to John Addington Symonds’s two series of Studies of the Greek Poets (1873, 1876): an audacious work that generated controversy because it made no apology for the Ancient Greeks’ celebration of “Phallic ecstasy.”25 Symonds’s repeated appeal to this striking phrase, which shows how Christian “theories of celibacy and asceticism” would have been “wholly alien to Greek moral and religious notions,” roused the indignation of R. St John Tyrwhitt in the Contemporary Review.26 Tyrwhitt, the Oxford-trained author of Christian Art and Symbolism (1872), declares that “it is well known that Greek love of nature and beauty went against nature,” and he takes exception to the Oxford-educated Symonds’s pagan assertions that “the frank sensuality of Priapus” is “a right object of [ancient] sculpture.”27 In the meantime, the Saturday Review, which went to some lengths objecting to Symonds’s observation about the “seriousness of this passion among the Greeks,” drew the following blunt conclusion: “the ‘devoted friendship’ ” (as Symonds styled it) “of the Greek man for the Greek youth was something [that] revolts our moral sense.”28 In no respect could this reviewer countenance Symonds’s bold assertion that “military friendship among the Greeks played for Hellenic civilisation a part not wholly dissimilar to that of chivalrous love among the nations of mediæval Europe.”29 Such “Greek chivalry,” Symonds proceeds to add, “was specially Dorian” – an observation that makes one think carefully about the first name that Wilde gave to the protagonist of his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, which Wilde’s adversaries in court sought to expose as “sodomitical.”30 As several critics have pointed out, Wilde’s focused interest in Symonds’s Studies emerged at a time when Classical scholarship was becoming more open about those aspects of Greek homosexuality that had\n\n10\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nproved hard to address directly in the past. Wilde’s tutor at Trinity College Dublin, J.P. Mahaffy, caused a stir when he commented unashamedly, in the first edition of Social Life in Greece from Homer to Menander (1874), on “the peculiar delight and excitement felt by the Greeks in the society of handsome youths.”31 “There is no field of enquiry,” Mahaffy remarked, “where we are so dogmatic in our social prejudices, and so determined by the special circumstances of our age and country.”32 At the same time, a handful of closely connected developments in the teaching of Classics were taking place at Oxford. The first is the liberalisation of the Classics syllabus, a movement that Benjamin Jowett spearheaded in 1853, which enabled students to read Plato’s Republic alongside Aristotle’s Ethics. By the time Wilde went up to Oxford, Jowett had been lecturing on Plato’s dialogues, including the controversial Symposium, for many years. In 1875, Jowett published his five-volume English translation of Plato’s works, which opens with the Charmides, the dialogue that concentrates attention on Socrates’s wish to discipline his desire for the eponymous beautiful young man. Jowett sought, in Linda Dowling’s words, to offer Plato to a fresh generation of men as a “surrogate to the Christianity that could be neither defended on the old dogmatic basis nor yet safely questioned in the light of modern thought” (especially Idealist thinking imported from Germany).33 These events occurred when at least one homosexual scandal had unsettled the university. Particularly sensitive to Jowett was the reputation of Classics don Walter Pater, whose “Conclusion” to his Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873) had convinced some readers that the author was irresponsibly advocating not only the seemingly immoral doctrine of art for art’s sake but also – to repeat the word that Symonds used – unbridled “ecstasy.”34 Pater, like Symonds, belonged to the same group of homosexually inclined Oxford men who found support for their desires in part through Jowett’s reformation of the Classics syllabus. The year after Pater’s polemical “Conclusion” appeared, the university put him under scrutiny for his supposed erotic involvement with an undergraduate, William Money Hardinge. Richard Dellamora has revealed that Tyrwhitt’s hostility to these manifestations of “Greek love” obliged both Pater and Symonds to withdraw their candidacy from the Chair in Poetry at Oxford.35 “The knowledge of this context,” Stefano Evangelista writes, “certainly coloured [Wilde’s] reading of Symonds and Pater, drawing him to aestheticism as an exhilarating discourse of artistic innovation and intellectual and sexual freedom, but also alerting him to the very concrete danger to which it exposed individuals both within the university and nationally.”36 Donald\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nMead and Thomas Wright, the editors of Wilde’s essay draft on “The Women of Homer,” concur. They mention that in his copies of Studies of the Greek Poets – both of which are also held at the Morgan Library – the twenty-one-year-old Wilde inserted the word “good” against Symonds’s audacious claim that “fraternity in arms played for the Greek race the same part as the idealization of women for the knighthood of feudal Europe.”37 This is one of many such annotations that affirm Symonds’s uninhibited treatment of the stigmatized “Greek love” Tyrwhitt abhorred. Yet, as Wright and Mead suggest, the larger purpose of “The Women of Homer” was to take Symonds to task for failing to understand what Wilde, in a critical annotation to the Studies, called the epic poet’s “good psychological analysis” of female characters such as Penelope.38 Even more frustrating to Wilde was Symonds’s insistence that “in Athens, the real centre of Hellenic life, women occupied a distinctly inferior rank.”39 To rebut such comments, Wilde noted that “the Greeks attributed to Hesiod a panegyric on women.”40 Mendelsohn captures Wilde’s sense of Symonds’s shortcomings well. He says that Wilde’s essay “stand[s] in refreshing contrast to the platitudinous moonings of Symonds himself, who is unable to see the preeminent female characters in Homer – Helen, Penelope, and the maiden Nausicaa – as anything but cartoon figures representing conventional types of femininity.”41 It is certainly the case that Wilde’s manuscript contains “psychological insight that would be remarkable in someone much older and more experienced than an undergraduate in his early twenties.”42 Already, during his career at Oxford, Wilde had developed a critical dialogue that sought to make what we might see as feminist advances on the work of one of the most outspoken apologists for male homoeroticism. This is obviously a very different perspective on the Wilde who became notorious for having supposedly declared, in a memorable flourish of frivolity, that he could not “live up” to the fashionable “blue china” that adorned his rooms at Magdalen College.43 As an undergraduate, Wilde’s mind was assuredly fixed as much on scholarly matters as it was focused – as Ellmann rightly puts it – on “poking fun at his own excess.”44 To Wilde, Symonds’s inability to appreciate Homer’s women is most evident when the Studies turns to Penelope, who waits twenty years for her spouse’s reappearance at Ithaca. Symonds takes a belittling view of Penelope’s response to the “uproarious suitors camped in her son’s halls.”45 In the Odyssey, Penelope informs this rowdy horde that she will take one of them as her spouse once she has finished weaving a windingsheet for her father-in-law, Laertes. But for three years she delays her\n\n12\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nchoice by undoing by lamplight the work she has completed during the day. Symonds states that this behaviour evinces Penelope’s “trifling and procrastinating with tyrannous passions” that defenseless women of this type remain “unable to expel from the palace of their souls.”46 Wilde responds by pointing to a respectful interpretation of Penelope’s predicament. Even though Odysseus’s homecoming “was the consummation” of Penelope’s existence, “it was in some way the breaking up of her life; for her occupation was gone.”47 On this basis, Homer presents not a petty-minded woman burning with inexpressible desires but a complex character who embodies an “extremely subtle psychological point.”48 As Mendelsohn remarks, even at this early stage of Wilde’s development we glimpse his “ability to discern, beneath the attitudes imposed on women by society, the sharp and surprising contours of unexpected emotions.”49 “The Women of Homer” certainly reveals that from the outset Wilde possessed developed skills in reading against the grain those writers who influenced him most greatly. In the end, Wilde relegated Symonds’s subsequent writings to useful sources of reference rather than ideas. This is particularly noticeable in one of the later chapters of The Picture of Dorian Gray. In his only novel, Wilde lists the names of Italian tyrants, most of which come from Symonds’s six-volume Renaissance of Italy (1875–86). By the time his mature essays appeared in the late 1880s, the Victorian thinkers who arguably engaged Wilde’s mind more than any others were Matthew Arnold and Walter Pater. His highly allusive writings such as “The Critic as Artist” (1890, revised 1891), which do little to hide their erudition, define their claims about modern criticism against Arnold’s famous 1864 essay on “The Function of Criticism at the Present Time” and Pater’s Renaissance. Further archival research on Wilde’s early years has also helped us comprehend more fully his transition from immensely gifted Oxford scholar to self-appointed “Professor of Aesthetics” who gained instant notoriety in London’s trendiest circles. Late 1878 and early 1879 marked a crucial turning point for Wilde. By the time he sat his final examination in June 1878, he had won Oxford’s coveted Newdigate Prize for Poetry. Five months later, once he took the Divinity examinations that permitted him to receive his outstanding bachelor’s degree, he applied for, though failed to secure, a fellowship in Classics at Trinity College. Both developments suggest he still had strong commitment to a university career. Yet the period that follows remains one of the most opaque in Wilde’s life. By the time he moved to London in February 1879 he had presumably been working on the manuscript of a long essay prepared\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nfor the Chancellor’s English Essay Prize at Oxford; the essay topic, “Historical Criticism among the Ancients,” had been announced the previous summer. That Wilde submitted a polished version of the document titled “Historical Criticism” seems unlikely. As Schroeder states, there is no record of Wilde’s candidacy for the prize “in the University archives, in Wilde’s letters, and in the memoirs of fellow students.”50 In any case, the judges decided not to award it. Whether Wilde had at this time failed to secure a fellowship at his college, Magdalen, also remains an open question. By September 1879, however, Wilde showed interest in making his mark as an authority on Classical culture. He published in the respected Athenæum a plainspoken review of R.C. Jebb’s articles on ancient history and literature in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Wilde takes the Glasgow professor to task for producing a “slight and sketchy” account of Ancient Greek literature.51 To emphasize his point, Wilde lauds Theocritus’s second idyll, also known as the Pharmakeutriai (The Sorceresses), which expresses “fiery colour and splendid concentration of passion.”52 This idyll evokes the pagan femme fatales that had since the 1860s preoccupied the art and poetry of those Pre-Raphaelites such as the classically trained Swinburne, whose influence is palpable in Wilde’s early verses.53 Yet, even if he started using the Reading Room of the British Museum soon after making the move to London, Wilde’s life in the metropolis brought about changes that drew him farther away from the scholarly researches in which he had excelled.54 The main draw to London was artist Frank Miles, whom Molly Whittington-Egan reveals to have been one of Wilde’s initial contacts at Oxford. In all probability, the two men met soon after Wilde, who received the highest marks in the entrance examination, matriculated at Magdalen College on 17 October 1874. The wealthy Miles, who remained Wilde’s closest male companion (and possibly lover) until 1881, was not an Oxford man, though he presumably had many acquaintances at the university. He was a fairly successful Society painter who exhibited his charming portraits of young women, including celebrities such as actress Lillie Langtry, on a regular basis at the Royal Academy until 1887. Langtry, who infamously became the Prince of Wales’s mistress in 1877, was one of the stylish connections that Wilde made through Miles. (Adoringly, Wilde penned a gushing hundred-line poem, “The New Helen,” which climaxes by honouring the “white glory” of Langtry’s “loveliness.”55) Ronald Sutherland-Gower, an affluent aristocrat and sculptor who befriended Wilde in June 1876, was another.56 Gower recalled that he believed that Miles “with his pencil, and his friend Oscar Wilde with his pen” were to make Langtry into the “Jaconde and\n\n14\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nLaura of this century.”57 Yet Gower, who abandoned his career as a politician in 1874, did not only possess the artistic associates that broadened Wilde’s milieu; his hardly restrained homosexuality also had far-reaching effects on Wilde’s understanding of how “Greek love” might find palpable expression in modern society. Even though it proves difficult to guess the frequency with which Wilde enjoyed this aristocrat’s hospitality, we know that Wilde spoke at the unveiling of Gower’s statue of Shakespeare in the gardens of the Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in October 1888. They were, it seems, in touch for at least twelve years. Critics generally accept that Wilde modelled aspects of Lord Henry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray on the somewhat dilettantish Gower. Together, Gower and Miles went some way towards enabling Wilde’s self-realisation as an outlandish aesthete, whom the press readily caricatured, as well as the kind of man who had a much more open awareness of the possibility of sexual expression than that of his most liberated contemporaries. Whittington-Egan’s instructive research on Miles’s life, particularly the events that forced his separation from Wilde, has gone a long way to bring a clear perspective on the period when the two men shared accommodation in London between early 1879 and late 1881. In many ways, her inquiry into this talented artist’s career, in which he not only became estranged from Wilde but also gradually succumbed to tertiary syphilis, does much to correct misapprehensions that appear in Ellmann’s Oscar Wilde. To begin with, Whittington-Egan points out that Miles and Wilde did not move together into the rooms where the painter kept a studio on Salisbury Street, off The Strand, as Ellmann suggests. Miles was first resident there sometime between 1875 and 1877. More important, however, is Ellmann’s mistaken interpretation – one derived from unreliable sources such as Robert Harborough Sherard’s The Real Oscar Wilde (1915) – of an anonymous report about an episode that occurred soon after the two men settled into the purpose-built home and studio, Keats House, which E.W. Godwin designed for Miles on Tite Street, Chelsea. (This was the developing artists’ colony where Wilde resided after his marriage in 1884. Godwin, too, was Wilde’s decorator.) Ellmann, who builds on information that Sherard supplied, believes that the police officers that started hammering at the door of Keats House in pursuit of Miles were seeking a suspect who they thought had snatched his favourite model, the working-class Sally Higgs, as a child.58 Supposedly, Wilde tried to block the policemen’s entry so that Miles had time to escape onto the rooftops. Even if this tale looks somewhat apocryphal, its significance lies in the surprising manner in which Ellmann chooses\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nto interpret it. He assumes that although Miles maintained a “puzzling intimacy with Gower,” the major problem that the artist faced was his “intimacy with young girls.”59 Ellmann is hardly alone in misconstruing this event. Crime fiction writer Thomas Toughill has claimed, as Sherard and Ellmann might lead us to believe, that Miles “was particularly fond of exposing himself to young girls.”60 Given his ever-worsening syphilis, which committed Miles to a mental asylum in 1887, it follows for Toughill that Miles turned into nothing less than the deranged Jack the Ripper. To support this far-fetched idea, Toughill engages in unfathomable speculations. He wonders, for example, whether the Ripper’s final victim, Mary Kelly, was one of Miles’s models.61 Whittington-Egan’s guiding point, to the contrary, is that Miles managed to hide his homosexual “adventures from his family while ostentatiously producing portraits of beautiful young women – a brilliant concealing device.”62 Her study deserves to be better known since Ellmann’s slanted reading of Miles’s sexuality, which contributed to a bizarre theory of murderous intent, has subsequently been repeated in an otherwise well-researched feature in The New Yorker.63 As correspondence held at the Clark reveals, even if we believe the tale about Wilde’s efforts to stave off the police at Keats House, in the end Miles realized that he needed to be protected from Wilde, whose profile as an audacious young poet with too much enthusiasm for Classical “ecstasy” had become a liability. The painter’s father, Canon Robert Miles, rector of Bingham, Nottingham, felt obliged to deter Wilde from remaining in his beloved son’s company. It was not that this troubled clergyman found anything untoward in the personal behaviour of the young Irishman to whom he had offered hospitality. Nor was Wilde suspected of preying sexually on the rector’s son. Instead, it was the publication of Wilde’s Poems in the summer of 1881 that affronted him. In particular, Miles’s father objected severely to passages in a poem that were so offensive that his wife “immediately cut it out” from the book.64 Ellmann is probably right to assume that the disputed work is the long poem “Charmides,” whose very title evoked for some classically educated Victorians the worst face of Socrates’s teachings about homosexual desire. Yet it seems probable that it was not so much the Platonic reference as the graphic depiction of the curly-haired “Grecian lad” making love to a statue of Athena that prompted Miles’s parents to recoil in horror: “his lips in hungering delight / Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck, / He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion’s will to check.”65 Back in 1866, reviewers’ adverse reactions to such sensual effusions ensured\n\n16\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nthat the respectable publisher of Swinburne’s first collection, Poems and Ballads, withdrew it from sale. (It was left to a company that traded in pornography to reissue Swinburne’s volume, whose influence can be felt throughout Wilde’s lines.) Sternly, Canon Miles made his position clear: “our first thought must be of [Frank] and his good name and his profession.”66 Wilde evidently did not have the social standing to survive this attack. Perhaps the sexual disgrace of Wilde’s father in a widely publicized libel trial in 1864 added to the Miles family’s sense that the young Irishman came from disreputable stock.67 It is hard to tell. What remains for sure is that the fallout between Miles and Wilde stemmed from the canon’s staunch disapproval. Neil McKenna, who has no doubts about Wilde’s sexual intimacy with Miles, views their friendship as one among several homosexual affairs that Wilde probably savoured in 1879 and 1880. He speculates that during this period Wilde “made overtures” to actor Norman Forbes-Robertson, with whom he went to Folkestone to greet French tragedienne Sarah Bernhardt’s boat.68 (Bernhardt had travelled across the Channel to perform in Racine’s Phèdre at the Gaiety Theatre, London. Wilde, who placed a bouquet of lilies at her feet, wrote a poem in her honour.) McKenna also believes that Wilde may have enjoyed intimacy with another “extremely handsome” young man, Oxford-educated poet Rennell Rodd, with whom he spent two summer vacations on the Continent.69 As Gower recalls, Wilde introduced Rodd – “a young Oxford friend” – to him in December 1879; Rodd, Gower wrote in his journal, was “full of artistic desires, which, however, he ha[d] not had an opportunity to develop under the cold shade of Jowett.”70 McKenna, who seldom shies away from speculation, suggests that the affair between Wilde and Rodd, if it occurred at all, “probably consisted of little more than fervid handholding, snatched kisses and bed-sharing in French lodgings with some attendant, fumbling mutual masturbation.”71 Yet, besides the fact that Wilde furnished a long introductory essay advocating aestheticism for Rose Leaf and Apple Leaf (1882), the precious title of the American edition of Rodd’s first book of poetry, it is the case that we still do not have any evidence to substantiate the idea that Wilde’s homosexual life was as rampant as McKenna would like us to believe. To be sure, Rodd had indulged Wilde by dedicating his volume of poetry “To Oscar Wilde – ‘Heart’s Brother’ – These Few Songs and Many Songs to Come.”72 But he soon thought it “too effusive,” and so he asked the publisher, J. M. Stoddart, to remove it from remaining copies.73 Both Wilde and Rodd were freemasons, and thus the dedication to his “Heart’s Brother” might\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\npoint to another kind of cherished bond. At any rate, in 1883 Rodd and Wilde quarrelled, for reasons that remain unclear. Wilde, who still recognized Rodd as the “true poet,” denounced him as the “false friend.”74 Perhaps, in the end, Rodd realized that readers such as Swinburne were shocked to see that the dedication made the author of Rose Leaf and Apple Leaf resemble the young Hephaestion in the thrall of his male lover, the “all-conquering Alexander.”75 What is certain is that Wilde’s Poems, as well the dedication in Rodd’s volume, implied the kind of sexual excess that even Swinburne, who knew what it meant to experience a backlash in the press, was surprised to see in print. Yet, as McKenna admits, there were “two sides” to Wilde’s “erotic moon,” and our increasing knowledge of Wilde’s fascination with young women complicates our picture of him as a precocious – or even exclusive – advocate of “the Love that dare not speak its name.”76 Not long after Wilde had befriended Gower and taken Miles to the two family homes in the West of Ireland, he also encountered the first woman he wished to marry. By late 1876, Wilde was besotted with Florence Balcombe, whom he met in August that year at her family home at Clontarf, north of Dublin. Their relationship, too, has been prone to some distortion. Ellmann suggests that it was at Christmas 1875 that Wilde presented to her a small gold cross with an inscription that united their names. The truth is that it was the following Christmas that Wilde presented a cross to her with his name only on it. The following month he kindly sent her a watercolour he had painted from Moytura House, where his family members enjoyed the summer. Not much else is known about their intimacy. In September 1878, after Balcombe accepted novelist Bram Stoker’s proposal of marriage, Wilde wrote to say that he would like her to return the “little gold cross”: “it serves as a memory of two sweet years – the sweetest of all the years of my youth.”77 Ellmann insists that “[b]ecause it bore his name conjoined with hers, she could never wear it.”78 Yet he finds other reasons that made Wilde psychologically averse to marrying. The most plausible is Wilde’s lack of funds. Ellmann, however, tests credibility when he asserts that Wilde proved reluctant to marry Balcombe because the “obligatory two years’ wait after syphilis had been diagnosed was not over.”79 Even though Ellmann recognizes that the belief Wilde contracted syphilis from a prostitute at Oxford is “not decisive,” since it comes from highly contested sources, he remains convinced that Wilde died from the disease. “[T]his conviction,” Ellmann asserts, “is central to my conception of Wilde’s character and my interpretation of many things in [Wilde’s] later life.”80 (A medical reappraisal\n\n18\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nof Wilde’s demise, published in 2000, concludes that he expired from meningoencephalitis.81) What is surely more important is that by the time Wilde was enjoying Miles’s company, along with that of Rennell Rodd, he was pursuing heterosexual affairs. He may well have proposed to Charlotte Montefiore. Later known as Lady McIver, she reportedly said that after she declined Wilde’s offer, he responded with the following quip: “With your money and my brain we could have gone so far.”82 (Such phrasing, it must be said, sounds far too glib to be attributed to Wilde.) All that can be asserted for sure is that the single letter that exists between Wilde and Montefiore reveals that he expressed warm affection for her. Soon afterward, Wilde showed considerable interest in “the sweetest violet in England”: a remark he confided to the mother of the young Violet Hunt, whose family knew Miles.83 In her memoirs, Hunt, who became a prolific novelist and leading suffragist, recalls that she “as nearly as possible escaped the honour of being Mrs. Oscar Wilde.”84 Very probably, Wilde proposed to Hunt before he departed for America in late 1881. Even if he did not make a proposal, it is clear that he wished to share his more political poems with her, especially works such as the anti-imperialist “Ave Imperatrix,” which he hoped would appeal to her father’s “wonderful radicalism.”85 Yet earlier that year, in the months leading to the breakup with Miles, Wilde was at the same time pursuing Constance Lloyd, whom he married in 1884. His interest in this talented woman began when they met at a tea party that her Irish grandmother arranged at Devonshire Terrace, London, in the late spring of 1881, just before his conflict with Miles’s parents arose. The social link here was Wilde’s mother, Jane Francesca Wilde, who had moved from Dublin to London after it became hard for her to maintain the family property in Ireland. At the time, Lloyd was a twenty-three-year-old who had developed an informed passion for the arts; she spent time at London’s temple to aestheticism, the Grosvenor Gallery, whose opening Wilde discussed in the Dublin University Magazine in July 1877. By 7 June 1881, Wilde met Lloyd again at another of her family “at-homes.” By this time, as Franny Moyle points out in her illuminating biography, the young woman, “suddenly all too aware of the celebrity attached to her new beau, found herself ‘shaking with fright.’”86 By drawing on unpublished correspondence held by Merlin Holland and by the University of Southampton, Moyle paints such a richly textured picture of Wilde’s spouse that it is impossible to resist the argument that from the outset the “attraction to Oscar in these early days reveals an aspect of their relationship that would remain fundamental\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nto their marriage.” “With Oscar,” Moyle continues, “Oscar dropped his public mask.”87 In other words, this unquestionably beautiful and intelligent woman had privileged access to a man who was by turn fêted and derided in the press for his flamboyant pronouncements on l’art pour l’art. They began to date, with Wilde escorting Lloyd to a performance of Othello at the Lyceum starring Edwin Booth, Henry Irving, and Ellen Terry. Moyle reveals how busily Wilde attended to Lloyd in June that summer. By Christmas Eve 1881, when he stepped aboard the SS Arizona to sail to New York City, where he would begin his year-long lecture tour of North America, it was clear to his family and her family that Wilde and Lloyd held a special place in each other’s affections. Even though we have no evidence that the lovers corresponded during his long absence abroad, it is clear that once they met again in May 1883 they resumed their relationship. On 26 November 1883, Lloyd announced from Dublin, where she had been listening to Wilde delivering a lecture, that she was engaged: “I am,” she told her brother, “perfectly and insanely happy.”88 Moyle reveals that although Otho Lloyd held some objections to what he saw as his sister’s infatuation, her family ensured that she had the resources to marry. In the previously unpublished letters that Moyle quotes, Constance Lloyd emerges as a young woman very much in love. Likewise, the gifts that Wilde bestowed upon his fiancée reveal that he held generous affections for her. Yet, as Moyle also points out, their affair led to an unusual union. Wilde ambitiously sought to establish what ultimately proved to be an unworkable model of modern marriage. Fascinatingly, Adrian Hope, one of Lloyd’s distant relatives through marriage, recorded that at a dinner party in April 1885 Lloyd ventured that in wedlock “it should be free to either party to go off at the expiration of the first year.”89 Wilde, according to Hope, contributed to the discussion by showing “distinct leanings to a system of Contract for 7 years only, to be renewed or not as either party saw fit.”90 Such adaptableness in some respects anticipated calls for “free union” among the 1880s radicals linked with the Fellowship of the New Life and, in the following decade, “New Women.” As it turned out, Wilde uttered these remarks when his sexual attentions were shifting out of the family home, as we can see in the indiscreet letter he wrote to Marillier. Although Wilde made it increasingly clear to his wife that he needed to spend time away from Tite Street, she remained unswervingly loyal to him in what remained, by any account, a marriage open to personal change and development. Like her spouse, Constance Wilde was an editor; she had responsibility for the\n\n20\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nforward-thinking Rational Dress Gazette. Independently of her husband, in late 1888 she joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (one of several fin-de-siècle secret societies that explored the occult), which acquainted her with Hebrew, Kabbalah, alchemy, and mysticism. And, perhaps with less innocence than it might at first appear, she encouraged Wilde’s friendships with young men, including not only Marillier but also a seventeen-year-old who became a paying guest in the summer of 1887. The young man’s name was Robert Baldwin Ross, whom scholars assume became Wilde’s lover around this time, if not earlier. (Frank Harris went so far as to suggest the two men first met in a public lavatory.91) Ross was from an early age sexually active with other men, and, as Franny Moyle puts it, he “proved a revelation to Oscar.”92 Yet what seems most important about Ross’s presence in the home where the Wildes developed their exceptional marriage is that he developed close bonds with both husband and wife. Ross, who eventually took responsibility as Wilde’s literary executor, remained one of Constance’s closest confidantes when her marriage was later under severe strain. The point that matters is that in 1887 Ross lodged in what was a somewhat bohemian, progressively oriented, and rather unconventional household, where both partners treated him with affection. Constance Wilde’s devotion to her husband lasted until a satirical novel called The Green Carnation (1894) and a provocative cartoon in Punch alerted her to the increasingly visible fact that her husband was intimately involved with Douglas, whom he had met at Oxford in 1892, and whose father, the Marquess of Queensberry, became increasingly belligerent towards Wilde’s not always discreet intimacy with the beautiful blond-haired son who went by the nickname “Bosie.” Punch, finding much amusement in The Green Carnation, joked that the Irish writer and his young aristocratic boyfriend were yearning for their “deliciously innocent and enthusiastic ... youthful disciples,” who seemed primed to emulate “our lovely limpness.”93 By late 1894, Wilde’s apparently effeminate homosexuality was an open secret. “I am very distraught and worried,” Constance Wilde confided to her close friend and mentor, Georgina Mount-Temple, “and no one can help me.”94 Just over six months later, as anyone who has heard of Wilde probably knows, Wilde was sent down with a supposed brothel keeper for committing acts of “gross indecency.” Wilde’s remarkable marriage, which may well have endured had he not embarked on a perilous libel suit against the Queensberry’s offensive charge that he was a “sodomite,” provides the backdrop to many aspects of The Picture of Dorian Gray, a novel whose homoerotic overtones caused\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\na stir in the London press. “[T]he one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties,” quips the droll Lord Henry in Wilde’s novel.95 Such cynicism has its roots in Wilde’s wry review of the Rev. E.J. Hardy’s anonymously published, and immensely popular, How to Be Happy though Married (1885) in the Pall Mall Gazette: “marriage is the subject on which all women agree and all men disagree.”96 The same mockery of the institution recurs throughout the Society comedies that made Wilde a rich man in the early 1890s. Much has been written on the ways in which these dramatic works, which enjoyed great success on the London stage, attempt to rethink the possibilities of modern marriage. An Ideal Husband (1895), which was still running when the court cross-examined Wilde about the “sodomitical” nature of Dorian Gray, is filled with witty putdowns about such matters as the failure of upper-crust men and women to understand each other in marriage. “Our husbands never appreciate anything in us,” Mrs. Marchmont states in passing. “We have to go to others for that!”97 Conversely, Lord Goring, a dandyish man who is under pressure to marry, drolly observes: “It is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution.”98 The sexes, it seems, are drifting apart more than ever before, and marriage – unless its partners reimagine it completely – is not likely to bring them together. Recently, it has been possible to glimpse on stage the ways in which Wilde was grappling with the marriage problem through an adaptation of a scenario for a four-act play that he sketched out in August 1894. George Alexander, who launched Wilde’s career as an acclaimed dramatist, received a letter in which the playwright outlined the plot of a new work that recast the manner in which Society comedy might end happily. In this sketch, the action centres on a sexually restless husband who has grown bored with his “simple sweet country girl” of a wife.99 He informs her that when the fashionable guests he has invited enter their country home she must not object to men flirting with her, especially a young man named Gerald. In this appalling situation, the sophisticated visitors spurn the company of the seemingly innocent young wife. The exception is Gerald, whom she finds charming. Exhausted after her visitors have retired, she falls asleep on a sofa in darkened drawing room. As she slumbers, her husband, not knowing of her presence, waits for the wife of one his guests to enter. Once she arrives, he locks the door, and they begin to make love. The husband of the woman soon starts banging on the door, and, awakened by the noise, the “country girl” immediately recognizes her husband’s sexual betrayal. To save everyone embarrassment,\n\n22\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nhowever, she unlocks the door, and makes an apology to the hotheaded husband for keeping his wife up so late. No sooner is she left alone with her own spouse than she tells him: “Don’t touch me.”100 Immediately, once the husband has made an indignant exit, Gerald enters, and the young wife divulges everything to him. Soon after, the wife refuses Gerald’s petition that she return to her spouse, which leads to her brisk elopement with this attractive young man. In the end, her maddened spouse threatens Gerald to a duel. The young wife makes it clear why she wants her husband to die: “Because the father of the child must live.”101 The husband exits and shoots himself. Gerald then enters, embraces his pregnant lover, and they conclude the drama in a clinging embrace. “I want the sheer passion of love to dominate everything,” Wilde informed Alexander. “I see great things in it.”102 From what we can tell, Wilde at some point decided to call this play Constance, after his wife, who died from botched spinal surgery in April 1898. In September 2011, Adam Spreadbury-Maher’s production of Constance – one of two fully-fledged adaptations of the scenario Wilde discussed with Alexander – for the first time brought to theatrical life a script that only came to notice in a French translation more than fifty years after Wilde’s death. Even if the evidence surrounding the composition of Constance remains somewhat scant, the result provides an intriguing indication of how Wilde sought to make further advances in transforming Society drama by making bolder moves in his exploration of marital discord. During his two and a half years of exile in France and Italy, Wilde was so hard pressed for cash that he unscrupulously sold the scenario for this remarkable play on modern marriage to four or five individuals, including American actress Cora Brown-Potter, with whom he began negotiations not long after he left jail until early 1900, and Frank Harris, who served as Wilde’s editor on the Fortnightly Review and Saturday Review and went on to publish his unreliable biography of the author in 1916.103 Harris, who saw a commercial opportunity in developing Wilde’s scenario, was startled to hear Wilde admit that he had sold the outline several times over. Purportedly, Harris bought up the rights from everyone who had paid for the scenario. On 25 October 1900, not long before Wilde passed away, Harris’s version, Mr. and Mrs. Daventry, opened at the Royalty, London, enjoying mixed reviews and a fairly successful run of 121 performances, with the illustrious Stella Campbell in the lead. One commentator, who had probably heard the rumour that the play originated with Wilde, went so far as to declare that the play’s celebration of the abused wife’s infidelity should have been called The Adulterers,\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nwhile, in stark contrast, another applauded it as “the most daring and naturalistic production of the modern English stage.”104 Certainly, the spectacle of the ethically upstanding, noticeably pregnant, and obviously adulterous young wife presented a moral quandary to the turn-of-thecentury audience. Seldom had justifiable infidelity been presented so defiantly on the London stage, and it probably had an impact on one of the most talented dramatists of the next generation. As Laurel Brake has suggested, W. Somerset Maugham, who maintained a strong interest in Wilde’s legacy, may well have adapted aspects of what he knew from Harris about Mr. and Mrs. Daventry in two plays, Penelope (1909) and The Constant Wife (1926), both of which involve adultery plots.105 Cora BrownPotter’s version of Constance engages with Wilde’s scenario in a somewhat different manner from Harris’s play, though it importantly maintains the focus on the unapologetic adulterous relationship between the “sweet country girl” and the young man whose child she is bearing. Spreadbury-Maher’s production of Constance – even if its publicity misguidedly implied that Wilde had authored the script – brought to a modern audience’s attention several things that the frequently hostile reviews tended to overlook when it opened. Irritated by the suggestion that Constance came from Wilde’s pen, critics focused much energy on how this intensely melodramatic drama contained so many poorly judged lines that it would be ludicrous to imagine that the playwright had any hand in it. Even though Wilde’s surviving son, Vyvyan Holland, in 1954 declared of Constance that “une grande part du dialogue a l’authentique marque du Wilde” (a large proportion of the dialogue bears the authentic mark of Wilde), his grandson, Merlin Holland – who is also the current executor of Wilde’s estate – stressed that Wilde “never wrote a word of the play ... It is dishonest to foist this on the public.”106 From what we can tell, Brown-Potter, perhaps with Bellew’s assistance, completed the play. After her death, the manuscript came into the hands of theatre collector Guillot de Saix, who translated it (with perhaps some elaborations) into French. During World War Two, Brown-Potter’s manuscript went missing. Together with Henri de Briel, de Saix presented his reconstructed manuscript to the public in 1954. Spreadbury-Maher’s production was based on Charles Osborne’s translation of the French text. While the rather murky origins of Brown-Potter’s Constance indicate that Wilde had little to do with her script, it remains the case that the September 2011 production gave some indication about the audacious directions that his drama, had he survived the nineteenth century, would have taken in the modern age. Seen knitting baby clothes in the final act, the pregnant\n\n24\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nprotagonist of Constance expresses no shame in having deserted her treacherous husband for a younger man whom she passionately desires. For all its shortcomings, Constance hints that in his mid forties Wilde’s Society drama was moving in strikingly radical directions. These recent discussions of Wilde’s Classical background, his friendship with Frank Miles, his marriage to Constance Lloyd, and his unfinished drama, Constance, present a much more intricate picture than we have previously understood of a man whose personal and professional explorations of intimacy were unquestionably in advance of their time. They also show that his explorations of sexuality were always broad, open-minded, and flexible. In other words, new sources disclose that Wilde, to use one of his famous phrases, was a far more “complex multiform creature” – one with “myriad lives and myriad sensations” – than scholars often imagine him to have been.107 Wilde Discoveries The present volume falls into five parts that trace specific developments in our understanding of Wilde’s career from the time when he composed his extravagant poetry at Oxford to the 1930s, when a gifted biographer, A.J.A. Symons, did his utmost to develop an accurate biographical study of the author’s controversial life, only to encounter the many obstacles – especially from individuals who demanded discretion in light of the scandal still attached to Wilde’s name – that were involved in completing such a necessary project. The opening chapters cluster around the Romanic sources that inspire much of Wilde’s poetry from his undergraduate days, the charged political context of his early play, Vera; or, The Nihilists, and his informative lectures on art and decoration that he delivered in North America. In chapter 1, Chris Foss questions earlier accounts of Wilde’s prominent interest in the leading male Romantics – especially John Keats, whose tomb the author addressed, in both an article and a sonnet, in the Irish Monthly in 1877. Foss’s point is that Wilde was not, as previous scholars have suggested, attracted by the egotism and idealism of figures such as Wordsworth and Shelley. Instead, Wilde’s apprehension of the Romantics was strongly mediated through the essays of Walter Pater, whose thinking brought to the fore those elements of irony, scepticism, and impressionism that ensure that the artwork remains in a dynamic state of becoming rather than being. In Foss’s persuasive view, Wilde was a latter-day Romantic ironist, one\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nwho deeply appreciated Keats’s thoughtful reflections on the virtues of poetic insincerity. By comparison, in chapter 2 Elizabeth Carolyn Miller examines the radicalism of Vera, a politically explosive drama about Russian nihilism that was originally scheduled for performance at the Adelphi Theatre, London, in December 1881. It remains unclear whether the assassination of Czar Alexander II by Russian nihilists earlier that year prompted the theatre to abort the production. What is certain is that the play, which eventually ran for a week at the Union Square Theatre, New York, in August 1883, addressed a distinctly modern desire for political change that, in a less explicit manner, informs Wilde’s popular Society comedies of the 1890s. As Miller shows, even if the ostensible subject of Vera is the nihilist attacks on the Russian monarchy, its politics implicitly engage with Irish nationalist insurgency. Fenian activist Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa’s dynamite campaigns, which began in January 1881, produced shock waves of terror that lasted until his own assassination in the summer of 1885. As Wilde’s career during the 1880s reveals, Home Rule in Ireland was never very far from his mind. He closely followed, for example, the Parnell Commission of 1888–9, which cleared the name of the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, Charles Stewart Parnell, after the London Times accused him – on the basis of forged documents – that he supported the murder of both the Chief Secretary for Ireland and his Permanent Undersecretary at Phoenix Park, Dublin, in 1882.108 In chapter 3, Gregory Castle alerts us to a different side of Wilde’s distinctly Irish identity, one that Castle links to the context of the Irish Revival, a movement that scholars have seldom, if ever, associated with the unquestionably nationalist Wilde’s name. The Revival, as students of W.B. Yeats and J.M. Synge know well, is usually associated with these writers’ desire to unearth authentic cultural roots and traditions that reach back to precolonial times, in the name of realising a postcolonial nation. Yet, as Castle points out, the tendency to see Wilde as the aesthete who engaged critically with Pater as entirely separable from the Revival is misleading. To be sure, even if his father was a respected collector of Irish folklore, Wilde never evinced the same explicit interest in Irish myth that Yeats cultivated, although it is possible to see the ways in which some of his fairy tales draw on elements of traditional national legends.109 Nor did he share Synge’s fascination with the Aran Islands, where the imperilled Irish language – as Wilde’s father knew from his ethnographic visit there in 1857 – had long been preserved. But, in Castle’s view, these\n\n26\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nclear distinctions miss the fact that one of the most significant aspects of Revivalism was not so much its desire to resuscitate the cultural past as its urgent address to a future – one in which the hoped-for identity of the nation was always in the making. Castle shows that during Wilde’s year-long tour of North America the twenty-six-year-old Irish writer had a distinctly Revivalist sense of what it meant to be an eccentric aesthete who embodied characteristics that his audience could not entirely anticipate, comprehend, or contain. Moreover, Wilde’s lectures on topics such as “The English Renaissance of Art” elaborated artistic preferences and tastes that were, as we can see from the baffled questions interviewers asked him during the tour, clearly ahead of their time. Part II features two chapters that look at differing aspects of The Woman’s World, the periodical aimed at well-educated women readers that Wilde edited, with great aplomb, between 1887 and 1889. While it is a commonplace to assume that Wilde’s commitment to l’art pour l’art put him at odds with the realism (especially naturalism) that enjoyed such prominence in fiction of the 1880s and 1890s, it is actually the case, as Molly Youngkin shows in chapter 4, that his critical notices in The Woman’s World reveal that he discovered the best kinds of “right realism” in the works of his contemporaries, especially women writers such as Margaret L. Woods. Certainly, Wilde had little time for what he saw as the sordid vulgarity of Emile Zola’s novels, just as he could not bear the moralising that afflicted many fictions in the realist mode. Yet he singled out for praise the power of attentive realistic observation in works such as The Romance of a Shop (1888) by Amy Levy – one of the many gifted women authors of the 1880s whose innovations Wilde did not hesitate to laud. Chapter 5, by Loretta Clayton, reveals that Wilde’s commitment to developments in women’s culture extended particularly to fashion. Like his spouse, Wilde wrote powerfully on dress reform, and he made The Woman’s World into a venue for influential discussions of liberating transformations in women’s clothing. Clayton’s analysis focuses on the reasons why an engraving of John Singer Sargent’s highly publicized portrait of Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth features, without any further comment, at the front of the July 1889 issue of the journal. Sargent’s portrait, as Clayton explains, features the extraordinary gown that Alice Comyns Carr designed for the singularly unconventional Terry. This radiant picture, which was first exhibited at the avant-garde New Gallery, stands at the centre of a decisive shift that was taking place in the fashioning of the female body among actresses, artists, costumers, designers, and writers in the late 1880s.\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\nIn Part III, the chapters move to the next decisive moment in Wilde’s career: his period as a writer of intriguing fictions. In chapter 6, James Campbell turns to Wilde’s novella, “The Portrait of Mr. W.H.,” which first appeared in Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine in 1889; the expanded version, which was ready for publication but did not go to press by the time of the trials, eventually came into print in 1921. Campbell addresses the complicated manner in which Wilde’s narrator gives shape to homoerotic desire in relation to the critical discussion that had long surrounded the mysterious identity of Shakespeare’s presumed love-object, known only by his initials, “W.H.” in the dedication to the Sonnets. As Campbell reveals, this ingeniously plotted, clearly homoerotic novella both absorbs and ironizes metaphors of heterosexual procreation to explain the manner in which the male characters in the story transmit to one another their belief in Shakespeare’s passion for the young man they come to believe, without any empirical proof, must be “Willie Hughes.” Rachel Ablow, in chapter 7, maintains the focus on “Mr. W.H.” by considering the ways in which John Henry Newman’s Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent (1870) is relevant to Wilde’s aesthetics not so much because of what it might teach us about Wilde’s long-standing interest in Roman Catholicism as its thoughtful theory of the “illative sense,” which informs the feeling of certitude that remains central to Newman’s model of religious faith. Newman’s thinking provides vital clues, Ablow argues, to the playful but also disturbing manner in which we see debates about feeling and faith unfold in “Mr. W.H.” If “Mr. W.H.” sets out to reveal that belief is assuredly more a matter of feeling than fact, then The Picture of Dorian Gray – as Neil Hultgren discloses in chapter 8 – is a work that seeks to uphold the idea that the best life is one dedicated to contemplation, not action. Yet, as Hultgren explains, this project – which to some degree depends on Pater’s Appreciations (1889) – is faced with many ethical difficulties. The melodramatic figure of James Vane, which Wilde added to the revised 1891 version of his novel, shows how strongly Wilde sought to expose the limitations of the kind of character whose very being depends on protecting family ties by taking the most violent forms of external action. James Vane blames his sister’s suicide on Dorian Gray, whom he is determined to kill. That Wilde’s novel does not permit James Vane, who is accidentally shot at a hunting party, to wreak vengeance on the protagonist raises important questions about the overarching point the narrative wishes to make about an alluringly beautiful, pleasure-seeking character who brings ruin to almost each and every individual he\n\n28\n\nJoseph Bristow\n\nencounters. Can no one act against Dorian Gray? Why must he remain inviolate from any external action? Part IV shifts to the next major phase in Wilde’s career: his triumphant Society comedies that ruled the West End stage from 1892 to 1895, together with his biblical tragedy, Salomé, to which the Lord Chamberlain’s office – in an act that roused Wilde’s indignation – refused to grant a licence. In chapter 9, William A. Cohen provides the most exacting discussion to date of Wilde’s competence and interest in the French language, especially in relation to Salomé. Originally written in French, this highly stylized one-act Symbolist drama throws light on many aspects of Wilde’s uneven proficiency in speaking and writing a language that for him enshrined the highest artistic ideals. Cohen’s leading point is that Wilde’s aspiration to succeed as a writer in French articulated a larger desire to transcend national boundaries – especially the morally narrow ones he associated with Great Britain – and become a decidedly cosmopolitan, if not world, author. In many ways, Wilde’s ambitions for his Frenchlanguage tragedy were not misplaced, since, even if it was banned from public performance in Britain until 1931, Richard Strauss’s experimental, if not often cacophonous, operatic adaptation of it in 1905 “hit the German cultural scenes,” as Petra Dierkes-Thrun observes, “like a bombshell.”110 Strauss’s magnificent modernist opera helped ensure that Wilde’s daring play gained world renown. In chapter 10, Lois Cucullu sustains our attention on Salomé, though on this occasion her analysis concentrates on the highly representative position that Wilde’s innovative drama holds among a set of fictional narratives and fashion features about the emergence of the modern sexual woman: a figure whose erotic restlessness forms part of what Cucullu calls her protracted adolescence. Cucullu sees this eminently recognizable sexual type evident in works as diverse as George Du Maurier’s Trilby (1894), Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897), and the work of couturier Lucile (Lady Duff Gordon). John Paul Riquelme, in chapter 11, concentrates on what might at first appear to be a hardly noteworthy element in Wilde’s painstaking composition of An Ideal Husband, whose emergence from notebook to manuscript through typewritten copies can be traced in great detail at the Clark Library. Riquelme, who has considerable experience in analysing James Joyce’s sportive wordplay, takes a sharp eye to what he inventively labels Wilde’s “anadoodlegram” that appears in the notebook where Wilde began to sketch out his ideas for this powerful drama. By looking closely at an otherwise cryptic doodle, Riquelme opens our eyes to the magnificent ways in which Wilde opened\n\nIntroduction\n\n29\n\nup different possible pathways of meaning for the tightly woven plot of this acclaimed Society comedy. Felicia J. Ruff takes a rather different approach to the semiotics of the stage by considering not so much Wilde’s wordplay as his “thing-play” in chapter 12. Ruff turns to The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) to draw into sharp perspective Wilde’s shrewd deployment of props, which makes high comedy of a sensational array of such seemingly innocent items as cucumber sandwiches, an inscribed cigarette case, and a somewhat careworn handbag. As Ruff points out, these props varied in the meanings they might communicate to a general audience, on the one hand, and members of Wilde’s homosexual coterie, on the other hand. This is particularly true of the cigarette case, which to most theatregoers contained an inscription that nicely dramatized the play’s light satire on normative family relations; at the same time, the cigarette case, to those in the know, was the kind of gift that Wilde made to young men whom he sexually favoured.111 In Part V, Ellen Crowell, who has conducted extensive research on Wilde’s posthumous reputation in the twentieth century, explores the reasons why A.J.A. Symons – arguably the most experimental and gifted literary biographer of his time – found it impossible to make headway with an experimentally structured account of Wilde’s life in the 1930s. At the time of his early death in 1941, Symons had amassed a large archive of materials for an ambitious biography – one that sought to dramatize the main characters in Wilde’s career – that would have done much to correct the distortions and biases that afflicted not only Frank Harris’s unreliable 1916 volumes but also the various slanted versions that Robert Harborough Sherard had concocted through the 1930s. Symons, who learned much from Wilde’s greatest bibliographer, Christopher Sclater Millard, enjoyed contact with one of Wilde’s most loyal surviving friends, Reginald Turner, and maintained a substantial correspondence with Alfred Douglas, still had to contend with the scandal that surrounded his subject’s reputation in the years leading up to World War Two. It would be left to Hesketh Pearson, in his constructive and favourable Life of Oscar Wilde (1946), to start guiding our knowledge of this great writer towards the transformative directions that modern scholarship, as we can see from Wilde Discoveries: Traditions, Histories, Archives, continues to take.\n\n30\n\nJoseph Bristow NOTES\n\n1 Clark was one of the most prominent early-twentieth-century philanthropists in Los Angeles.

Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis (London: Fourth Estate, 2000), 272. Jonathan Fryer records that Harry Marillier (1865–1951) was a fourteenyear-old pupil at Christ Church Hospital when he met Wilde at 13 Salisbury Street, where Wilde and Miles shared rooms between the spring of 1879 and the late spring of 1880. Wilde gave Marillier tutorials in Greek, and within a few years the teenager won a Classical Scholarship at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1885, Marillier invited Wilde and his wife, Constance, to attend a production of Aeschylus’s Eumenides, which he had put on with some fellow students. Fryer observes that this encounter with Marillier, five years after they had last met, had a powerful effect on Wilde: “It seems clear to me that Oscar was falling in love.” Their last encounter took place, it seems, at Wilde’s home in early 1886. Fryer remarks: “Partly this was because Harry heard increasingly bad stories about Oscar and felt that the writer was going to seed.” Marillier married in 1893, and he resided at Kelmscott House, Hammersmith, after William Morris’s death in 1896; he later took over Morris’s business. Marillier’s later achievements include an illustrated memoir of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (London: Bell, 1906).

George Curzon,” 20 July 1885, and 23 October 1885, and Wilde, “To J. P. Mahaffy,” [Late February 1886], in Complete Letters, 264, 266, and 279-80. 23 A.E. Housman comments that Wilde’s translation of two songs from Aristophanes’s Clouds, which first appeared in Dublin University Magazine 86 (1875): 622, was “not at all bad”: “To A. W. Pollard,” 25 October 1890, in The Letters of A. E. Housman, ed. Archie Burnett, 2 vols (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2007), 1: 67. Wilde’s translation is reprinted in Pollard, ed., Odes from the Greek Dramatists (London: David Stott, 1890), 149–51. Housman was characteristically hard to satisfy on matters of scholarly detail. On Housman’s sadness at Wilde’s imprisonment, see the posthumously published lyric, “Oh who is that young sinner,” in The Poems, ed. Archie Burnett (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997), 157–8. Wilde’s considerable learning as a Classicist, together with its impact on his later works, is explored in Iain Ross, Oscar Wilde and Ancient Greece (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012). 24 Wilde, “To Lord Alfred Douglas” [January–March 1897], in Complete Letters, 729. Wilde’s literary executor, Robert Ross, titled this letter De Profundis when he published a section of it in 1905. 25 John Addington Symonds, Studies of the Greek Poets (London: Smith, Elder, 1873), 240. 26 Symonds, Studies of the Greek Poets, 241. 27 R.
