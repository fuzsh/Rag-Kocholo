As a soldier I know what the Medal means. As a Senator I learned what the intent of the Congress was in providing for this recognition of valor. But as President I realize that little or nothing is generally known of the history of this great decoration, or of the men who, during the last 172 years, have displayed the highest type of heroism in helping to build this Land of Liberty and bring our nation to its present status of world leadership. For this reason I expressed my wish to have this history pre- pared. It is designed to perpetuate in memory the deeds of courage and selflessness for which the Medal has been awarded and to give the American people a fuller understanding of the zdeal for which the Medal of Honor stands in the history of our Army and of our country. It 1s to the men—liwing and dead—who have won this high honor during the history of our nation that this book is dedicated. May the courage and heroism of which thts Medal is a symbol always remind us of our debit to these men, and clearly point to the personal responsibility which every American has today to share in the work of helping to build a healthy and peaceful world. f THE WHITE HOUSE July 10 1948 Google Original from UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA Digitized by Google 9/b006-pd#asn ssad0e/buo' snu TyeU'MMM//:d114u / paZTLTbTp-3)6005 ‘utTewog 2T1qGNd OCESTLSTOOTSETE UWN//Z70Z/JoeuU* a pueYy\"{pYy//:sdiiyY / IWD OV:8T VO-ZO-TZOZ UO STNOT \"35 UT AjTS4aATUN UO HUTYSeM Je pazesauay PREFACE This study of the legislative and historical aspects of the Army Medal of Honor was undertaken by the Public Information Division of the De- partment of the Army upon the direction of the President of the United States.

HE WHO POSSESSES THE MEDAL OF HONOR is the holder of the highest military award for bravery that can be given to any individual in the United States of America. This symbol of bronze, wreathed in green enamel and held by a white-starred ribbon of blue silk, bestows upon the man who has won it a great privilege—that of shar- ing in the company of the few heroes who have been honored by the award of the same Medal he wears. It is to define and illuminate the place in history which belongs only to winners of the Medal of Honor that this book is written. The Medal of Honor was won in only one way during World Wars I and II. That was by a deed of personal bravery or self-sacrifice, above and beyond the call of duty, while a member of the American armed forces, in actual combat with an enemy of the Nation. In their provisions for judging whether a man is en- titled to the Medal, Army Regulations permit of no margin of doubt or error. The deed of the winner must be proved by incontestable evidence of at least two eye- witnesses; it must be so outstanding that it clearly dis- tinguishes his gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms of bravery; it must involve the risk of his life; and it must be the type of deed which, if he had not Google done it, would not subject him to any justified criticism. A recommendation for the Medal must be made with- in 2 years from the date of the deed upon which it de- pends. Award of the Medal must be made within 3 years after the date of the deed. Apart from the great honor which it conveys, there are certain small privileges which accompany the Medal of Honor. Its winners can, under certain conditions, ob- tain free Army plane transportation. Their military pay, if they are enlisted men, is increased by $2 per month. And former soldiers who have won the Medal are eli- gible, upon reaching the age of 65, for a special pension of $120 per year. The Medal of Honor is presented to its winners by a high official “in the name of the Congress of the United States.” For this reason it is sometimes called ““The Con- gressional Medal of Honor.” It should be noted that on a few, rare occasions, the Congress of the United States has awarded special medals of honor for individual exploits taking place in peace- time. However, in peace or war, this Medal is the highest decoration which can be given in any of the armed services—Army, Navy, or Air Force. This publication contains a list of all those who, during the existence of our country, have won the Army Medal of Honor. It is to these men that this book is dedicated. CHAPTER TWO How the Medal Came Into Being THE MEDAL OF HONOR was not the idea of any one American. Like most of the ideas which have flowered into institutions and practices in our nation, it was the result of group thought and action. While several earn- est and energetic men had more to do with executing the idea than others, the fact remains that the original concept of the Medal was part and parcel of the times which produced it. It was an answer to an historical need, and it sprang forth when that need arose. By examining the period of history in which it was created, the clues will be found which, when analyzed, will tell why it was created inthattime .. . Washington, in the winter of 1861-62, was a city almost literally floating upon mud, a be-spattered na- tional capital with duckboard sidewalks, and carriage- churned streets—overcrowded, underhoused, throbbing with the tensions of war. Out of the mud reared the unfinished national buildings—the Capitol still lacking its dome—the White House without its full complement of wings—the Washington Monument, less than half completed, looking much as if it had been finished and then struck by a bomb which tore away the top two- thirds of the pillar. In many ways it resembled the Washington of 1942-45, especially in its hurry and crowds and tension and confusion, real or apparent. In others, it was clearly the capital of its own times, representing the extent to which our nation had been built by 1861. It was incom- plete, still raw in spots, still struggling internally to bring order into the welter of ideas which had been the source of American democracy. The Civil War had been in progress since the spring of 1861, and now, in the winter that followed, there was running into Washington a thin stream of thought con- cerned with the necessity for recognizing the deeds of American soldiers who had distinguished themselves in the fighting. This current of thought was a demonstra- tion of the renewed energy of action and ideas which 4 Google the demands of a huge and critically important struggle seem to bring about in any civilization. The American Nation, which had given little thought to its Army in time of peace, now found it to be the focal point of attention. The soldier, unpublicized and isolated during the preceding years, many of which he spent guarding the national frontiers against Indian raids, now became a great, looming figure in the fight to preserve the Union. Overnight, he ceased to be a man plying some remote and mysterious trade out on the plains of Kansas or North Dakota and became the boy next door, or, indeed, the son of the household, dressed in a jaunty blue uniform and sent out to fight for a cause that, in a very real sense, lay close to home. And he not only fought. He fought gallantly, some- times displaying a sheer heroism which, when looked upon by the nation in whose name it was called forth, a nation which was extremely conscious of its importance, quite naturally caused that nation to seek some means of rewarding him. But the thought did not stop there. For the first time in many years—since the Revolution itself, perhaps— Americans realized not only what an important citizen its soldier was, but how important he had always been. They realized that the far-off lonely trooper, walking his post on the frontier during the years of “peace”, during the times when the Army was smaller and less publicized than it was in 1861, had been doing the same essential work as that of the soldier of the Civil War—protecting the nation. And they realized that in doing this work he had very often displayed a little-known and unrecognized heroism which, by its nature, rendered him capable of being killed in action on the plains, just as he could have been at Fort Donelson or Manassas. If they looked back to see what honor had been given to soldiers who, during our history, had done more than their duty, these people of 1861 would have had to gaze far beyond the incidents of the Indian frontiers; beyond a HOW THE MEDAL CAME INTO BEING 5 the beach at Vera Cruz and the heights of Mexico City in the Mexican War; beyond the cotton-bale breastworks at New Orleans, from which Jackson’s fire cut down the British in 1815; beyond all these things and back to the Revolution—back to 1782, where, symbolically, George Washington stood alone: the first and last American during all that time who had recognized the need for honoring all brave soldiers with decorations and who had provided for it by originating the Purple Heart .. . It is true that there had been a “Certificate of Merit” authorized in 1847, when the demands of the Mexican War had brought the soldier to public attention for a brief moment. But even this Certificate proves the thesis that the public view of the soldier had changed. It did not provide for a medal, in the first place. It was really a certificate—a document. Congress later provided that holders of the Certificate who were still in service should have extra pay of $2 per month. Now, one would have to search high and low through- out history—today included—to find a soldier who holds anything against the idea of an extra $2 per month. But that zn ztself, felt the thoughtful people of 1861, in no way compensated the soldier for a deed in which he risked life and limb in a truly outstanding surge of hero- ism. Something more was needed, they felt, than the mere expedient of “payment for services rendered”. And there had also been a method of honoring soldiers by means of the “brevet” system of promotion, whereby a soldier mentioned for gallantry in dispatches could be granted a “brevet rank” higher than that of his actual rank, and be entitled to wear the insignia which went with the brevet. But this system had fallen victim to a series of political abuses, and by 1861 much of its honor had grown meaningless. Also, its use, like that of the Certifi- cate of Merit, did not involve the award of a medal. It was George Washington alone, as we have said, who could provide the people of 1861 with their real cue for the action they had in mind. And this was that while soldiers could always use extra money, money alone can- not give honor; and since his honor is something which no real soldier likes to talk about, those who want to honor him should supply him with a token of that honor which he can wear without words. Knowing these things, Washington had created the Purple Heart at Newburgh, N. Y., on August 7, 1782, as a decoration for “singularly meritorious action.” Three men had been awarded it in 1783. The records show no others. Under these circumstances, in that winter of 1861, if the people who thought of honoring their soldiers had searched American history for a true precedent, they Google would have found it only in the Revolutionary War. That they were thinking about it in the first place and that their thinking took the specific form it did were re- sults of their realization that when all other defenses of a government fail—its survival depends upon the lengths of personal bravery to which men in uniform are willing to go to save it from destruction. It remained for their thought to be confirmed by action. — Senator James W. Grimes, of Iowa, took the lead, as chairman of the Senate Naval Committee. He intro- duced a bill into Congress to create a Navy Medal. It was passed by both Houses and approved by President Abraham Lincoln on December 21, 1861. It estab- lished a Medal of Honor for enlisted men of the Navy— the first decoration formally authorized by the Amer- ican Government to be worn as a badge of honor. Action on the Army Medal was started 2 months later, when, on February 17, 1862, Senator Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts, introduced a Senate resolution providing for presentation of “medals of honor” to enlisted men of the Army and Voluntary Forces who “shall most dis- tinguish themselves by their gallantry in action, and other soldier-like qualities.” Lincoln’s approval made the resolution law on July 12,1862. It was amended by an act approved on March 3, 1863, which extended its provisions to include officers as well as enlisted men, and made the provisions retro- active to the beginning of the Civil War. This legislation was to stand as the basis upon which the Army Medal of Honor could be awarded until July 9, 1918, when it was superseded by a completely revised statute. As soon as the Navy Medal of Honor had been author- ized, Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy in Lincoln’s Cabinet, had written to James Pollock, Director of the U.S. Mint at Philadelphia, asking for his assistance in obtaining a design for the Medal. Pollock had submitted five designs to the Navy by the time the Army bill had been introduced in the Senate. When he heard that a similar medal was being considered for the Army, Pollock wrote to Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War, enclos- ing one of the designs prepared for the Navy, and point- ing out that it would be appropriate for use by the Army as well. T'wo more designs were submitted to the Navy on May 6, 1862, and on May 9 the Navy approved one of them. In bas-relief, on the star, the Union held a shield in her right hand against an attacker, who crouched to the left, holding forked-tongued serpents which struck at the shield. In the left hand of the Union was held the fasces, the ancient Roman symbol of unified authority, an axe bound in staves of wood—still a common symbol on 6 THE MEDAL OF HONOR many of our ten-cent pieces. The thirty-four stars which encircle these figures represent the number of States at the time the Medal was designed. ‘The reverse of the Medal bore a blank for the name of the winner and the date and place of his deed. On November 17 of that year, the War Department contracted with the firm of William Wilson & Son, Phila- delphia, where the Navy Medals were being made, for 2,000 of the same type of medals for the Army. The only difference between the Army Medal and that of the Navy was that the Army Medal, instead of being attached to its ribbon by an anchor, was attached by means of the American Eagle symbol, standing on crossed cannon and cannon balls. The ribbon which held this original Army Medal of Honor was of 13 vertical stripes of alternating red and white, with a solid blue strip on top. The pin to which this was attached was decorated with a small United States shield. The Medal was designed by Christian Schussel, who was born in Alsace, France, and emigrated to Philadelphia, later becoming a professor of painting and drawing at the Pennsylvania Academy. The engraving of the dies was done by Anthony C. Paquet, who was born in Hamburg, Germany, and emigrated to America, later becoming a skilled employee at the Philadelphia Mint. Both of these men had left their native countries in 1848—the year in which democratic uprisings against tyranny had swept over all Continental Europe, only to be eventually beaten down. It is significant to think about them for a moment in connection with the Medal. Neither of them were “native-born, hundred percent Americans.” Both of them had been forced out of their homelands in a year in which it became dangerous to believe in democracy. ‘They knew nothing about each other before they reached America. But both of them knew, by harsh experience, how important the American Idea was, and between them they produced the Medal which expressed its importance. Like the men of the foreign-born regiments who fought so gallantly for their adopted country during the Civil War, contributing their military experience to the cause of the Union, these two artists made the kind of con- tribution they could best make—the gift of their artistic training and skill—in producing a Medal for a nation which had no precedent to guide it. Schussel, the Frenchman, had a Germanic name. Pa- quet, the German, had a name with a French sound. Even in this, as in the other circumstances surrounding their contribution, they seem to point almost symbolically to one of the great strengths of America—that of being able to use the talents of all other nations, all during her Google history, caring nothing about the names or antecedents of those who possessed that talent and who gave it freely to the Nation. And what of the man who was the first to perform a deed which later won an Army Medal of Honor? He was Col. Bernard J. D. Irwin, born in Ireland on June 24, 1830, graduated from New York Medical Col- lege in 1852, and who entered the Army as a first lieu- tenant, assistant surgeon, in 1856. The deed which won him the Medal took place before the Medal had been created. It happened on February 14, 1861, before the outbreak of the Civil War, in the region which is now the State of Arizona. The Chiricahua, one of the Apache Indian bands, had carried off a boy, the son of one of the few frontier families to gain a foothold in the region, during one of their cattle raids. Sixty men of the Seventh Infantry Regiment were ordered to rescue the boy and the cattle. This detail, under the command of Lt. George N. Bas- com, made its way into the mountains and found Cochise, chief of the Chiricahua. Lieutenant Bascom demanded that the boy be turned over to him, and was refused. Bascom determined to hold Cochise and others as hostages, but Cochise made a bold dash and escaped. Several of Bascom’s men were wounded and in a short time his command was sur- rounded by the Chiricahua. Cut off from Fort Breckenridge, Bascom waited until night before sending a messenger to make his way through the Indian-held ground and report the situation to the Fort. His messenger passed through the Indians, climbed a steep mountain out of the plain in which Bas- com was besieged, and carried the news to Fort Brecken- ridge. At Breckenridge, it was decided to send a relieving party of 14 picked infantrymen to Bascom’s aid. Irwin, assistant surgeon at the Fort, knowing that some of Bascom’s men were wounded, volunteered to lead the party. Mounted on mules, the party tof in a heavy snow storm on February 13, 1861, and on the night of the 14th they reached the long, winding canyon leading to the plain on which Bascom’s command was sur- rounded, and relieved the party. After the wounded were attended, the village of Cochise was found and destroyed. It was not until January 21, 1894, that Colonel Irwin was awarded the Medal for this deed. ‘The citation given Irwin stated that he “voluntarily took command of troops and attacked and defeated the hostile Indians he met on the way” in his mission to rescue Bascom’s command. HOW THE MEDAL CAME INTO BEING 7 Irwin was chief medical officer, United States Military Academy 1873-78, and medical director in various De- partments of the Army between 1882-94. He retired on June 28, 1894 and was advanced to rank of brigadier general, retired, by act of April 23, 1904. He died in Chicago on December 15, 1917. The first Army Medals to be awarded were given to six soldiers in a joint ceremony on March 25, 1863. These six were the only ones out of an original band of 20 volunteers to escape from behind the Southern lines after carrying out a real “cloak-and-dagger” mission, de- signed to cut the entire State of Tennessee off from the Confederacy by sabotaging a railroad, the Western and Atlantic, which ran between Marietta, Ga., and Chatta- nooga, Tenn., constituting a vital supply line for the Confederate forces in Tennessee. If it could be torn apart to any effective degree, Tennessee could be isolated from its Southern supply base long enough to allow Gen- eral Mitchell, commanding a division of the Army of the Cumberland, to attack and take Chattanooga. A civilian, a secret agent named James J. Andrews, planned for 4 months, designing a raid upon the rail- road. Basically, his scheme was to get a band of men aboard one of the trains out of Georgia headed for Chat- tanooga, capture the train, leave the other passengers behind, steam up North with frequent pauses to cut tele- graph wires, burn bridges, and tear up rails behind them, do as much damage as possible, and then abandon the train and try to escape if capture threatened. ‘Twenty-one men volunteered for the mission, without being told all of its details and knowing only that it was extremely dangerous. After receiving preliminary in- structions from Andrews, they left camp near Shelbyville, Tenn., on the night of April 7, 1862, disguised as civilians, and drifted singly into Chattanooga. There they boarded a passenger train for Marietta, Ga., where they arrived on April 11. The next day they went back to the sta- tion and bought tickets for a northbound train to the town of Big Shanty (now called Kenesaw) 8 miles to the north of Marietta. Andrews had picked Big Shanty as the best point at which to seize the train because of its lack of telegraph connections with the outside world. The train bearing them stopped at Big Shanty, and the conductor called, “twenty minutes for breakfast!” Passengers and trainmen got off on the right-hand side of the train. Andrews, followed by his volunteers, got off on the left-hand side, walked quickly to the head of the train and ran ahead of the engine to make sure a switch wasopen. One of his men jumped into the engine and eased open the throttle. Another cut the bell rope. Google Another acted as brakeman. The rest of them piled aboard. Andrews, his inspection of the switch finished, came running back and swung into the engine. “All right,” he called softly, “Let ’er go!” The big wheels revolved, caught hold, and the raid was underway. They chugged forward for several miles, then stopped and tore down telegraph wires and piled cross-ties on the rails. Andrews gave the volunteers a final briefing, and they continued the sabotaging journey. They reached and passed the town of Calhoon with a clear track ahead to Chattanooga. But shortly after, the Confederates started to pursue them in another train, and the pursuit gained on them rapidly. Andrews had probably counted on this. He cut loose the end cars of the train, one by one. But the Confeder- ate engineer would slow down as he approached them, drive into them, and push them on ahead. Finally An- drews had only one boxcar left to hold his men. They broke the end out of it and commenced to drop cross- ties on the track, but this had the effect of checking the Confederate pursuit only slightly. Finally, with their cross-ties all gone, Andrews and his men got into the engine, set fire to the last boxcar, and uncoupled it as they crossed a long bridge at Oostenaula, leaving it burn- ing in the center of the bridge. But the pursuing engine pushed on through the smoke, slowed up enough to nudge into the burning boxcar, and rolled it on ahead, getting rid of it at the next siding. Then, near Graysville, after 90 miles of flight, Andrews’ locomotive ran out of fuel, gasped and gave up the ghost. As it slowed down for its final stop, Andrews and his men jumped off and scattered into the woods. Within a few days all of them had been captured by mounted Confederates who were sent in pursuit. They were taken to Atlanta, where Andrews and seven of his men were tried by court martial, condemned, and exe- cuted. ‘The remaining 14 were kept in prison until the following October, when eight of them, making a coordi- nated attack on their guards, escaped. This left six prisoners with the Confederates. ‘They were finally paroled at City Point, Va., on March 17, 1863, almost a year after their exploit, and it was to these six men that the first Medals of Honor were given. They arrived in Washington on March 25, with orders to report to the Judge Advocate General so that they could revise and qualify evidence concerning the raid. When Secretary of War Stanton heard that they were in the Capital, he sent word that he wanted to see them. As soon as their evidence had been given before the Judge Advocate, Maj. Gen. Ethan Allen Hitchcock and James C. Whetmore, State agent for Ohio took them to the War Department Building. 8 THE MEDAL OF HONOR They swept through the waiting rooms, leaving behind them, according to newspaper accounts of the day, “num- bers of military and civil dignitaries” who “were anxiously awaiting outside to see Mr. Stanton, but who were re- quired to wait until . . . these . . . soldiers had been commended.” Stanton shook hands with each of them as they en- tered his office, and introduced them to Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, and Andrew Johnson, of Ten- nessee, the Vice President, who were in the room. Then Stanton turned to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who had been beaten during his captivity, and spoke quietly about his appreciation of Parrott’s devotion. Opening a morocco case, he explained the Congressional authorization for awards of medals for bravery. “None of these medals,”’ he said to Parrott, “have yet been awarded to any soldiers, and I now present you with the first one that has been issued by the authority of the late act.” Stanton then presented a Medal to each of the re- maining five men. (SO gle He awarded them a hundred dollars apiece; asked Whetmore to request the Governor of Ohio to appoint each of the six to first lieutenancies in Ohio regiments, © and added that if there were no vacancies in these regi- ments at the moment he would himself brevet them as first lieutenants in the Regular Army. After Stanton, Johnson, and Chase had questioned the Medal winners about their observations of the Confed- eracy, they went to the White House, where Lincoln had requested that they be sent after leaving the War Depart- ment. Lincoln, says the Washington Chronicle for the following day, received them with great “warmth of feeling . . . manifested utmost sympathy for their suf- ferings, and commended them for th ee courage with which they had submitt ou to them,” they departed after “‘a very interesting interview of se an hour’s duration.” And now the Army had a Medal of Honor. Heroic deeds had entitled their authors to the decoration, and the first of the Medals themselves had been awarded, “‘in the name of the Congress of the United States.” ' f l 3, ' I 4 HF ry ; nl 1 | ~ i 4 ) ; I re : ) 1 | I ' ! mal ' ry ™ q | 5 —| fy) a a 7 ™ | “4 . rm i j 4+— - —_— q Li ; ' ’ , 1 a Oe gL oe es TON Aya a rn aa ui 4 i mg dy Lf EOF. 1 ) I = | — | a ry , _ : ) - : ; () ' 1 ! 8) ) ' Cc) = | ° = ‘ — t ra | f) ii . oan ye | 4d - 1's J ' t . i 1 jn — te i be hy — j cy Bi, 7 = ay i Il 5 ' ~ r\"| = 1 . 5 r k - > , Bi . — | —_ = 7 1 4 ) | q ' “h | j Z = —— _— 7 j oe i ; 1 j | — 1) : | j i J aj + — = ~, —, i —_ a | . ae ty, aye ge ie he ‘i A gstalsish } i ' fl 3 3 i re. » _ by te - i I j 1) aol re _ fs — L ne oe 1 ek mE ; x Hat yy i e. —— * - “tL : — on | # a. 4 s : ; r cy ' sete a _ ; = j } J k \" 3 7 * i : i ( 4 fy yh ‘ . - * bs ; - ~eitios j é \\ * . . = —— . = = a s : r : —_ i , = ed et = - 5 —— f \\ 5 - . \" ' fT ( Pi * iL > = us 1 e . ry so + = E a ® dh my TT we * — | ‘ / “ 1 i 1 3 1 Y 1 « . . 2 “td oh, et , a - 4) ee : # F < = & = > fl () hs en. > ® . = a : ; a ret > — er o> 7 4 I - ‘ 2 ry ee a I J : ae 78 = ai a. a f - *.

American history before 1861 shows the Purple Heart as America’s only true precedent. This chapter will look back past American history, into the histories of other nations, to see what developments there had been elsewhere in the idea of medals, and what effect, if any, these develop- ments had upon the history of the American Medal of Honor. It is known that in the period 1861-62 there were several European influences connected with the Medal of Honor. One, of course, was the physical design of the Medal itself, which had come from the hands of men born in Europe, who imparted to their task artistic skills which had first been acquired in Europe. Lt. Col. Ed- ward D. Townsend, The Adjutant General of the Army in 1861, has described the effects of another European influence upon the Medal in his memoirs. This was the arrival in this country of officers who had been trained in foreign armies and who offered their services to the Amer- ican Government. As these soldiers usually displayed medals or orders on their uniforms, “‘it is no wonder,” wrote Townsend, that “they were objects of envy to many of our young aspirants for military glory.” Townsend had been one of the first to argue for the creation of an American Medal of Honor, using this and other arguments in its favor. But it was significant of the trend of thought which had survived since the Revolution, that there were many people who, far from agreeing that our soldiers should have medals because European sol- diers had them, took just the opposite view and said, in effect, “If European soldiers wear medals, that’s just another reason why Americans should not.” After all, these people argued—and they argued with complete sincerity—the ideal for which we had fought in the Revolution was that of a complete break with Europe and all its works in the form of titles, trappings, and the pomp and circumstance of the monarchies. Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, General in Chief of the Army in 1861, Google joined with several members of the Senate Military Com- mittee, in having misgivings about the popularity of any move to give a medal to American soldiers. Townsend, and other supporters of the idea of a medal, could well have argued that we never did break with all European ideas or institutions, and that if monarchies had developed medals which helped them to continue as mon- archies, we should be quick to imitate their methods and develop a medal which would help us continue to be a democracy. But whether they used this argument or not, the fact is that they did get their way. A Medal of Honor was created and European influences were immediately involved in its creation. It stood, in 1862, at the end of a long line of symbols which people have used since the beginning of time to honor those who perform some _ outstanding achievement. One of the first—and longest-lasting—forms of award for a deed of distinction was the laurel wreath, with which the Greeks crowned citizens who were outstand- ing not only in war, but also in athletics, literature and oratory. Rulers in the late Roman era took the laurel wreath unto themselves, and when their profiles appeared on coins of the time, it was with the wreath upon their heads. Medals developed as more or less special kinds of coins, and it is not startling that the laurel wreath is part of the Medal of Honor today. When the Roman Empire fell apart and feudalism rose to replace it, the feudal system was accompanied by a growth of “rewards” in the form of titles and pre- rogatives. Feudalism involved the pledging of loyalty by groups of retainers to “strong men” in their neigh- borhoods. The “strong men”, or barons, would honor the “knights” who performed valiant feats of arms not only by giving them increased titles, lands, pensions, but encouraging them in the growing habit of decorat- ing their shields and other armor with insignia which 9 10 THE MEDAL OF HONOR were, in effect, a pictorial history of their deeds. As the deeds increased in number, so did the numbers and complexity of the insignia, giving root to the entire com- plicated field of heraldry and heraldic art, and the pro- duction of “coats-of-arms” for the families which had evolved them. But this type of “decoration” was for the few. ‘The warriors of feudalism were in sharp distinction to the peasants who fed them and who won no heraldic devices. Even when the knights found that their splendid armored cavalry was of little value unless accompanied by men-at- arms “drafted” from the peasantry—light infantry, in effect, comprised of pikemen and swordsmen and archers such as the “yeomen” of England—even then, the re- wards given the peasant elements of their armies were few and far between. Feudalism died a natural death and its heavy cavalry fell under the arrows of the English archers at Crécy and Agincourt. Government by kings and “sovereign states” replaced the first, and national armies, drawn from every sector of life, replaced the second. But the ancient system of “decorations for the aristocracy only” con- tinued. Among them were the “orders” of semireligious bodies, such as the Knights Templar, which came into being in the Crusades—the titles of a hierarchy of royalty—the heraldic devices above noted—and even, with the French Revolution, a revival of the laurel wreath itself, during a time when it was fashionable to hark back to the Greek “republic” for clothing, hair styles, and ideas. Napoleon Bonaparte put himself at the head of an even larger grouping of states than had been usual up to then, giving himself the title of Emperor. But he was careful not to repeat one of the errors of the original barons, kings, and emperors—he originated a decora- tion that could be won by anyone, regardless of rank or social background. This was the decoration of the Légion D’Honneur, and Bonaparte used it skillfully, as one of the most im- portant of a series of awards he designed to bolster up his empire. He had devised “eagles” for his regiments, copied from the old Roman standards carried by the legions. He gave his artillery (he was himself an artil- leryman) a catchword of loyalty when he said, “I give no eagles to my batteries to defend. ‘They have their guns.” He used a broad system of promotion and pre- rogative in order to reward his generals and political ap- pointees. But, as has been said, the Légion D’Honneur was the spearhead of the system he so shrewdly utilized to instill loyalty in the nation he led—because anybody could win it. He knew that once the people failed to stand by him he was finished. Google And they stood by him for a long time. Graybearded grenadiers followed him for years, from Egypt through Prussia to Moscow, embracing him when he escaped his first prison—worshipping not only him, but his recogni- tion of them, embodied in the decoration they wore. Pale adolescents cheered him before they charged to death at Waterloo or died in the Russian snow for his fantastic ambition, their hearts set upon becoming mem- bers of the Légion D’Honneur. Before Napoleon died he had almost all of the Chris- tian world united in competition against him. And the other states of Europe were forced to the realization that in order to fight him—or a revival of his ideas after his death—they would have to be as ee as he was in everything. They adopted his principle of national armies; they drilled their armies in his efficient manner; they studied his tactics and strategy. And they adopted systems of using medals for bravery which could be won by anyone worthy of them. Thus there arose the Russian Cross of St. George, the Iron Cross of Germany, and the English decoration of the Victoria Cross. ‘They were products of the epoch of nationalism, created to reward the citizen for his loyalty to his state. It should be noted in this chapter that before the es- tablishment of the Purple Heart the American Govern- ment had given six medals to individuals—struck upon special occasions, and not part of any organized, system- atic plan of awards. These medals, both in their design and method of award, as well as in the circumstances which caused them to be awarded, were more a part of the tradition of the past than of that which was to develop in America in the future. The first was given to Washington, by a resolution passed by the Continental Congress and approved on March 25, 1776. The second was voted by Congress on November 25, 1777, to be given to General Horatio Gates for the defeat of the British under Gen. John Bur- goyne at Saratoga. This was a large bane weighing more than 4 ounces, far too heavy to be worn as a decora- tion. The third was voted to Henry Lee—nicknamed “Light Horse Harry”—the father of Robert E. Lee, on September 24, 1779, in recognition of his attack upon the British at Paulus Hook, N. J., in July of that year, during which he captured 160 of the enemy without sustaining any loss to his own forces. The next three awarded were unique, in that they went to enlisted men rather than officers, and that they were created by Congress with the specific understand- ing that they were to be worn as decorations by the re- cipients. These were the so-called “André” medals, A BACKWARD GLANCE 11 given to the three American militiamen who captured the British intelligence major, John André, while he was enroute to New York from West Point, wearing civilian clothes, after having plotted with Benedict Arnold for the betrayal of the American cause. They were awarded in 1780 to John Paulding, Isaac Van Wart, and David Williams. ‘Two of them are now in the possession of the New York Historical Society. In concluding this brief account of how the Medal of Honor had links with the past in the form of other medals, awarded in this and other countries, it should be noted that the American Medal, called into existence long after the United States was born, and long after other nations had begun the custom of their award, was unique in an- other special way. It has been seen how medals in other lands were evolving to meet the needs of nationalism, and being used to reward those citizens who served the king— the ruler—the head of a state. America had little sympathy for this type of state—she had revolted suc- cessfully against one of them, and that one not the most Google despotic of them all. It is no wonder that in 1861 there were men who doubted that a medal could become popu- lar in this country. But this was not the whole story. By 1861 a crisis had made many Americans realize the importance of the idea that lay behind their country—and how important it was to defend that idea. It was natural that, when these Americans reached for a design for a medal to re- ward those who fought heroically for that idea, they should touch the tradition of the past. Between the Medal they created and the medals which had preceded it there was not much difference in design, and there were similarities in such facts as that the American decora- tion, like many another, was made of metal and bore a motto. But the great difference between the American Medal and all the others which had ever been created was in the philosophy which lay behind it—the American philosophy of freedom for the individual, versus the Old World with its emphasis upon the state and its ruler; the great Am- erican experiment of democracy for everybody, versus the philosophy of the governments in which “classes” of citi- zens were ruled by the “divine right” of kings. CHAPTER FOUR Protecting the Medal IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER it has been shown that there were sincere men who believed that the idea of a Medal of Honor would not prove popular with Americans. By the end of the Civil War, and in suc- ceeding years, this view was definitely proved to be in- correct. The Medal was, if anything, too popular, and the glory which it conferred upon its winners had the effect of inspiring the human emotion of envy in many breasts. This was at least partly the cause for imitations of the Medal, sometimes expressed by societies which used badges which were practically exact duplicates of the Medal to denote membership in their associations. A flood of such imitations sprang up following the Civil War, and had the effect of causing Congress, eventu- ally, to take steps to protect the dignity of the original Medal. Legislation was built up to clarify the meaning of the award, and, in the case of the Army, the design was changed. This change was accompanied by action which did away with the imitative designs which had sprung up before 1904. All this, however, occurred after the Civil War, and the legislative protection which was created to deal with it will be examined in the chrono- logical story. It is important to note, however, before beginning this chronological account, that the trend towards other dec- orations, expressed itself very definitely during the Civil War. This trend involved predecessors of the Medal, in the form of medals being created by soldiers themselves, as well as in the form of at least one similar movement launched by a civilian group. As early as June 6, 1861, the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York had adopted a resolution ordering, “the execution of a series of medals of a proper character” to be presented to those who defended Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens in the ‘preceding month. During the war, the first step taken by soldiers them- selves to create a medal occurred when Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny, the beloved commander of the Third Division of the Army of the Potomac, was killed in action. Officers 12 Google _ of each of the regiments which had seryed under Kearny adopted a resolution to procure “a medal in his honor’, for distribution to officers and enlisted men. Further action of this nature came on March 13, 1863, when Brig. Gen. Daniel Birney, Kearny’s successor in command of the Third Division, announced that he was obtaining another medal, a “cross of valor’, to be known as the “Kearny Cross”, which would be bestowed upon such noncommissioned officers and privates as had most dis- tinguished themselves in battle. There was a good reason for this type of decora- tion being connected with the name of Philip Kearny— a reason which illustrates still further the thesis that good soldiers have always known the power of decorations. Kearny was commander of a division which included many foreign-born soldiers. He was born in New York—an Irish-American with a romantic flair who was already something of a legend at the time the Civil War began. He had fought in the Mexican War with dis- tinction, losing an arm at the Battle of Cherubusco. Both before and after that he had fought under the French flag—the first time in Algiers, leading some of the world’s best cavalry, the Chasseurs d’ Afrique—and, later on, at Solferino, in the Italo-French War. He had been the first American to win the Légion d’Honneur decoration for military service. Because of the arm he had lost in| Mexico, he had great difficulty getting himself scptd for service in the Union Army. Eventually he was accepted and rose rapidly to the rank of divisional commander after Bull Run and the Peninsular campaign. His tiny figure be- came a familiar sight in the front lines. He believed in reassuring his men during emergencies by his personal appearance, and would gallop in front of his lines, hold- ing the reins of his horse in his teeth, his one arm waving wildly, his képi set at a jaunty angle, and his beard floating in the wind. It was while he was exposing himself in this manner that he was killed just after the Second Battle of PROTECTING THE MEDAL 13 Bull Run, at Chantilly, Va., on September 1, 1862. But before he died he had done something for the morale of his troops which proved that he had thoroughly learned the lesson which Napoleon gave the French when he created the Légion d’Honneur. Kearny had issued a red, diamond-shaped patch to every man in his com- mand, to be worn on their caps. It was his own idea, done by his own order, and it set his men apart from all the others, distinguishing them as “Kearny’s men”, both to the rest of the Union Army—and to the Con- federates, who had a healthy respect for their ability. His red diamond patch (one similar to it can be seen today on the shoulders of men of the Fifth Infantry Divi- sion) materially assisted in establishing ésprit de corps— the “pride in outfit” which is now recognized as a “must” in military training. Kearny—like Washington, who had created the Purple Heart—had worked out his own method of giving his soldiers something to symbolize their teamwork. It was not unnatural, therefore, that it would be the memory of this General Kearny which inspired the men he had led to “order” a medal bearing his name. The fashion spread. Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks, commanding the Department of the Gulf, announced in June of 1863 that volunteers should receive “a medal fit to commemorate the first grand success of the cam- paign of 1863 for the freedom of the Mississippi.” In the same month, Stanton signed an order authorizing a medal for those troops who reenlisted at the expiration of their terms of service. Major Generals James B. McPherson and Quincy A. Gillmore authorized “medals of honor” in October of the same year. In April 1864, Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside announced that “those who desired could also wear a medal of the same design made of gold or gilt.” In October of that year, Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, in his address to the soldiers of the Army of the James, announced that a “special medal would be struck in honor of certain colored soldiers of his command for gallantry in action.” A halt was called to this process in January 1865. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard announced “awards of medals of honor to certain enlisted men”—and a few days later the order was suspended. Without arguing whether this tendency toward un- official award of medals, on the part of soldiers, was beneficial or not, it can be said that the practice cer- tainly underlined the fact that medals were just as pop- ular in America as anywhere else. All of these soldier- inspired “awards”, moreover, were based upon a good assumption—that the soldier should be rewarded for his various types of gallantry. But there were to be abuses of the Medal of Honor. Google One of these was stated as early as 1869, when M. H. Beaumont, publisher of a magazine named “The Soldier’s Friend”, wrote from New York to the War Department, indicating that he had been repeatedly requested to publish the names of all Medal of Honor winners. “There are some who are using medals for the pur- pose of soliciting charity’’, he wrote, “who obtained them surreptitiously.” Adjutant General Townsend agreed that the publica- tion of a list would be a good idea. He pointed out that some of the winners had never applied for their medals, and that publication might help lead to their delivery. A list was sent to Beaumont on September 29, 1869, and published in “The Soldier’s Friend” shortly afterward. Thus, one abuse was recognized very shortly after the Medal had been authorized. Another was springing up, although it was not defined until much later. This was the practice of imitating the Medal and ribbon, adopted by several semimilitary organizations—imita- tions which were so good that, according to The Ad- jutant General in 1896, it was “almost impossible to discern their slight difference from the Medal of Honor and its ribbon.” These abuses were specific and irritating, but there was an abuse growing up which was to prove far more em- barrassing than either of these. This was the abuse in- herent in the applications of a growing number of ex- soldiers, who, following the Civil War, began to present claims for the Medal of Honor without any sound docu- mentation, and after the passage of an inordinate amount of time from the dates upon which they were alleged to have been won. To the ranks of these late claimants must be added those overzealous officers who, upon the slightest provocation, would recommend large numbers of the men under their command as being fit recipients of the Medal. This practice received its first setback in the year 1876, when, following Custer’s “last stand” and the massacre of his troops at Little Big Horn, the company commanders of the troops who had attempted his relief had recom- mended large numbers of their men for the Medal. These recommendations were submitted to Brig. Gen. Alfred A. Terry, commanding in that Department, who promptly disapproved them and returned them for revision. It appeared to him, he wrote, “from the great number of decorations . . . that company commanders have recommended every man in their respective companies that behaved ordinarily well during the action of 25th June, 1876.” “Medals of Honor”, he continued, “fare not intended for ordinarily good conduct, but for conspicuous acts of | 14 THE MEDAL OF HONOR gallantry.”” He directed that the lists submitted be re- vised to include, “the names only of men who distinguished themselves in marked manner by conspicuous acts of gal- lantry in action . . .” with, “the particular act . . . set forth at length opposite the name of the soldier recom- mended... .” It is possible that when General Terry wrote these words he did not know that he was making the first official formulation of policy governing the award. That is ex- actly what his order constituted, however. It was the first step in constructing the body of regulations and legis- lation which has grown around the Medal since then and which has had only one objective—the protection of the Medal from abuses which would destroy its dignity and the original intent of its award. General Terry’s action had an immediate result. ‘The regimental commander of the Seventh Cavalry, Col. S. D. Sturgis, appointed a board of officers to review the list of recommendations. The work of this Board is historically important, first, because it set a precedent for future awards following review by similar boards; second, because it laid down two principles which have since become indispensable in governing award of the Medal. The Board was “of the opinion that only such persons should be recommended for Medals of Honor as displayed in the discharge of duty a zeal, energy, and personal daring which far ex- ceeded any just demand of duty.” The Board also stressed the consideration that, “the conduct which de- serves such recognition should not be the simple discharge of duty, but such acts beyond this that, if omitted or refused to be done, should not justly subject the person to censure as for shortcoming or failure.” These recommendations of the Board were approved by Colonel Sturgis, General Terry, and Lt. Gen. Philip Sheridan. On August 29, 1878, Medals of Honor were awarded to the 22 men of the Little Big Horn relief forces who were recommended for Medals of Honor on the basis of having successfully passed the foregoing tests. The first important construction of the law and estab- lishment of precedent concerning award of the Medal had, by this action, been written into Army records. A sword in itself may be an attractive object; it is only when its possessor has learned how to use it that it be- comes the real weapon which it was intended to be. A book on a shelf may look impressive, but unless someone reads it, it is not fulfilling its function. And so with the Medal of Honor . . . if it had not been guarded by reg- ulation and legislation throughout its history, it would have long since lost all of its meaning. Before it could fulfill its real mission in the life of our nation, that nation Google had to learn what it meant, protect it against imitation, dignify it by awarding it only to those who could be proved worthy of it. This is why the recommendations of the Board ap- pointed by Colonel Sturgis were important, and why all the legislation on the Medal which was yet to come is important. The Medal had been in existence for only 16 years before this Board met to frame its recommenda- tions. During these 16 years, everyone concerned with the administration of awards of the Medal was under- taking a responsibility in which experience was almost wholly lacking. The Army, by 1861, was experienced in many things. Among them were such administrative matters as recog- nizing precedents and procedures to be followed for cen- sure, or punishment of shortcomings and disobedience. But procedures for the recognition and reward of acts beyond the just demands of orders or duty had not been developed as a major phase of military administration, simply because, prior to 1861, there was no such thing as a decoration in use in the Army. Important as they were to be, the formulations of General Terry and his board applied only to a particular situation in a particular place. They were not army- wide. Since the time of General Terry’s action and the recommendations of the board which was set up as a result, many steps have been taken to protect the Medal through regulations and legislation. In 1884, a circular was published by The Adjutant General which laid down the provision that “the only decorations allowed to be worn on occasions of ceremony are the ‘army corps badge’ . . . the ‘medal of honor’ and the several distinctive marks given for excellence in rifle practice .. .” In 1886 the War Department printed an official list of winners in a pamphlet entitled “Medals of Honor Awarded for Distinguished Service During the War of the Rebellion.””’ On December 10, 1888, a general order directed all Army personnel to report!the facts of any deed or service which might merit reward, inasmuch as the War Department contemplated publishing, at the end of each year, “an order making mention of gallant or specially meritorious conduct in service... (and) . . the names of those who have received medals of honor and certificates of merit.” In 1889, the Army Regulations published the follow- ing: “Medals of Honor will be awarded by the President to officers or enlisted men who have distinguished them- selves in action.” ‘This was the first time that the “Regu- lations” made mention of the Medal. Up to that date PROTECTING THE MEDAL 15 the regulations had mentioned only the Certificate of Merit. Public interest in the history of the Medal was quicken- ing. Four editions of a book edited by Brig. Gen. The- ophilus F. Rodenbaugh, himself a Medal winner, were published in rapid succession. These were titled, “Uncle Sam’s Medal of Honor Men” (1886); “The Bravest Five Hundred of °61” (1891); “Fighting for Honor” (1893); and “‘Sabre and Bayonet” (1897). Interest in perpetuating the ideals of the Medal was mounting on the part of Medal winners themselves. On April 23, 1890, the Medal of Honor Legion was organized at Washington, as a local society. It was made a national organization during the Grand Encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic in Boston, on August 14, 1890. One of the principal objectives of the organization was, according to F. S. Frisbie, its historian, the “endeavor to obtain such legislation from Congress as will tend to give the Medal of Honor the same position among the military orders of the world which similar medals occupy.” On February 11, 1892, The Adjutant General’s Office defined the distinction between the Medal of Honor and the Certificate of Merit pointing out that award of the Medal depended upon an act of heroism and award of a Certificate of Merit upon a deed which benefited the United States. In 1890 there were 33 Medals awarded. In 1891 there were 67 awarded. Confronted with this hundred percent increase in a single year, the War Department, noting that many of the applications for Medals were from ex-soldiers who made no attempt to explain why they had delayed many years in making the applications, sought an opinion on the awards from the Attorney General. A claim based upon a 28-year-old deed was used as a test case, and on July 11, 1892, the Attorney General, William Henry H. Miller, issued an opinion which, after quoting the act of 1863, said that it was reasonable to suppose that “Congress, in enacting this provision, pro- ceeded upon the idea that the evidence which would chiefly, if not exclusively, guide the judgment of the President in awarding ‘medals of honor’ would be official reports of battles made to the War Department.” He pointed out that in these reports “it was reasonable to ex- pect that the names would be found of all who specially distinguished themselves in the battles and encounters of the late war.” Because of the 28-year delay in presenting the claim of the test case, he stated, the award should not be granted. On January 10, 1894, Secretary of War Joseph B. Doe stated that “Medals of Honor were intended by Google Congress for officers or men who have done something more than what is expected of every faithful soldier, and the mere fact that this expectation has some- times failed and that all soldiers are not equally faithful, brave and gallant does not entitle an officer or man who simply did his whole duty to an honor of this description.” And finally, on June 26, 1897, the Secretary of War, R. A. Alger, announced that paragraph 177 of the Army Regulations was revised, at the direction of President William McKinley and that new regulations would hence- forth define the award of the Medal of Honor. The resulting regulations gave the War Department an authoritative and comprehensive system for dealing with award of the Medal. They laid down the necessity for “incontestable evidence” of the deed, and the require- ment that every such deed must be one clearly dis- tinguishing the individual for intrepidity, judged by a standard of “extraordinary merit.” It was provided that all Medal of Honor applications thenceforth were to be considered as belonging to one of three categories: (1) for services rendered from the outbreak of the Civil War to December 31, 1889; (2) for services during the period between January 1, 1890, and June 26, 1897; and (3) for “cases that may arise for service performed hereafter.” All three classes of claimants were required to submit either official records of the War Department or the testimony of one or more eye-witnesses who, “under oath”, would, “describe specifically the act or acts they saw wherein the person recommended or applying clearly distinguished himself above his fellows for most dis- tinguished gallantry in action.” Claims for Medals in reward for an action which took place after January 1, 1890—in other words, category (2) above—could not be made by the proposed recipi- ent, but “by the commanding officer or soldier having personal cognizance of the act for which . . . the honor is claimed.” Details were demanded, and also, where feasible, certificates or affidavits of eye-witnesses. As for the third category—awards which might be made following June 26, 1897—the regulation specified that recommendations would have to be forwarded through channels “within one year after the performance of the act for which the award is claimed.” Command- ing officers were to make full investigations of all rec- ommendations in their commands, give their opinions on the cases by indorsement, and forward them to The Adjutant General. It will be noted that this regulation laid down basic procedures affecting the award of the Medal which are still part of today’s regulations—namely, a time limit 16 THE MEDAL OF HONOR upon the filing of recommendations and a stipulation demanding eye-witness proof. A year before these regulations were drawn up, Con- gress authorized the Secretary of War to issue rosettes, or knots, to be worn in lieu of the Medal, as well as to purchase new ribbons for issue to Medal winners whose old ones had worn out. The new ribbon, announced on July 7, 1897, had a white stripe in the center, two wider stripes of blue on each side of the white, and two even wider stripes of red on each side of the blue. The Adjutant General, Brig. Gen. George D. Ruggles, had advised the Secretary of War to consider revising the design of the original ribbon, with its 13 stripes of red and white, topped by a blue bar, because it had been imitated to such an extent by semimilitary organizations. On August 1, 1899, Elihu Root was appointed Sec- retary of War. He proved to be one of the most efficient and painstaking army administrators in history. Early in 1901 he described the weaknesses of the exist- ing laws concerning the Medal of Honor in a letter to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. “Under existing law’’, he wrote, “there is no limit to the time within which applications for the award of Medals of Honor may be filed and considered. Indeed, applica- tions have been filed in recent years for the award of the Medals for acts of gallantry alleged to have been per- formed more than 40 years ago . . . It is needless to say that it is impossible at this late date to determine the facts in such cases with any degree of accuracy.” He stressed the importance of deciding all Medal of Honor cases while the facts were still fresh in the minds of witnesses, “and while it is possible for the Department to do exact justice to all concerned.” He concluded with a recommendation that a limit of 3 years should be fixed as the time within which a claim for the Medal might be made. This, he said, “would give abundant time for the consideration of any meritorious case that may arise . . . hereafter. It is believed that such a limit should be established by law.” Root had a mind which was trained in law, orderly and logical. He saw the necessity for clarification of the ex- isting regulations, which, when they were applied to all the Medals of Honor issued after the Civil War, illustrated many ambiguities. Medals of Honor had been issued after 1862 for “‘soldierlike qualities”, for example, which the 1897 regulations would not accept as the basis of awards fromthenon. Moreover, he found that too much time was being spent by the War Department in inves- Google tigating applications based upon service in the Civil War. Root had the advice, during this period, of Capt. (later Brig. Gen.) Frederick Grayton Ainsworth, who had been in charge of the Record and Pension Office of the War Department since 1886. Captain Ainsworth wrote a 10-page history on the topic of early awards of the Medal and incorporated it in his annual report for the fiscal year 1900-01. It was a comprehensive history of the administration of Medal of Honor awards up to that time, official and authentic, and it gave the Secretary of War firm ground upon which to stand in making his reforms. Congressional action based upon Root’s recommenda- tions was not immediately fectheceiag so Root took the steps toward reform of Medal of Honor awards which he could take through War Department action. On Sep- tember 21, 1901, he appointed Maj. Gen. Arthur Mac- Arthur, himself a Medal of Honor winner, who had just returned from his post as Military Governor of the Philip- pines, as chairman of a board of officers created for the purpose of examining and acting upon recommendations for the Medal of Honor growing out of the War with Spain and the Philippine Insurrection. The board was in session only 9 weeks, screening rec- ommendations, but the methods which it developed during that period were rated highly by the War De- partment. The task of the board was the appraisal and reward of bygone acts, and the directive which instituted the board gave no authority to continue the work into the future. But when its assignment was finished, it was evident that this type of work should be made permanent. Assistant Secretary of War William Sanger on February 24, 1902, recommended to Secretary Root that the pro- cedure should be a continuing process. Root took quick action upon the suggestion. By Spe- cial Order No. 95, dated April 19, 1902, another board of officers was appointed for the purpose of, ‘“‘examining such applications and recommendations as may be re- ferred to it.” This board had its first meeting on May 5, 1902. Up to this time, any individual who thought that he had qualified during the period from 1861 up to January 1, 1890, could file an application with the War Department for the Medal of Honor. The date of the action involved or the date of his separation from the Army were not used as factors in judging his case. On February 6, 1903, the Attorney General gave the War Department an opinion on this practice to the effect that “A Medal of Honor cannot be awarded when the application or recommendation therefor is made after the ... [claimant] . . . has been discharged from the military service.” This view was concurred in by the Secretary of War, by direction of the President, and pub- PROTECTING THE MEDAL 17 lished in the War Department Circular dated March 16, 1903. Elihu Root resigned as Secretary of War on February 1, 1904, but legislation which he had recommended con- cerning the Medal had already been introduced in Con- gress. By the act approved on April 23, 1904, two basic achievements were accomplished. This act made it man- datory that all claims for the Medal should be accom- panied by official documents describing the deed in- volved. The act also changed the design of the Medal. Mr. Root, while traveling in Europe in 1902, had dis- cussed the Medal of Honor design with our ambassador to France, Brig. Gen. Horace Porter—who, as a captain, had won the Medal at Chickamauga in 1863. General Porter was in favor of redesigning the Medal. Corre- spondence of the period shows that this view was also DESIGN No. 37,236. PATENTED NOV. 22, 1904. G. L. GILLESPIE. BADGE.

Gillespie, the Chief of Engineers—also a Medal winner. The Army War College Board had the ques- tion referred to it, and after making its recommendations suggested that they be forwarded to General Porter for additional comment. Late in 1903, General Porter had several designs pre- pared by Messers. Arthur, Bertrand, and Berenger, of Paris, showed them to Root—who was again in Europe— and sent them to The Adjutant General, recommending that one of them should be approved by the Legion of the Medal of Honor, which, at that time, was headed by Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles. Following the approval of this organization, the Secretary of War approved the new design and a rosette, fixing his signature to the plan on January 28, 1904, 4 days before he resigned. Just 2 weeks earlier Representative Cordell Hull, of Tennessee, had introduced the act of 1904, providing for the two changes noted above, into Congress. As stated, it was approved on April 23, 1904, and it authorized “three thousand medals of honor prepared . . . upon a new design.” It remained only to protect the new design from abuse. Early in 1904, Ambassador Porter had written to Gen- No. 37,236, eral Gillespie praising the General’s idea for taking out a patent or copyright on the new design of the medal. General Gillespie was granted Patent Serial No. 197, 369, covering the new Medal of Honor, specified as United States Patent Office Design No. 37,236. The final step for protection of the new design was taken on December 19, 1904, when General Gillespie trans- ferred the Medal of Honor Patent “to W. H. Taft and his successor or successors as Secretary of War of the United States of America.” Thus control of the design of the Medal was put into the hands of the Secretary of War, and uncontrolled imitations of the Medal were halted. In addition to the developments which this chapter has listed, there were two actions of Congress concern- ing the Medal which should be noted. On April 15, 1904, an act was approved which authorized the issue of duplicate medals in cases in which the originals had been lost or destroyed. Almost 3 years later, on February 27, 1907, by a joint resolution, Congress released Medal holders from the obligation to surrender old Medals when they were replaced by Medals of the new design.

Witnesses: Specifications of the Gillespie patent Google CHAPTER FIVE “The Pyramid of Honor’’ THE MEDAL OF HONOR, which had begun as an idea in the minds of a few people back in 1861, had become a reality occupying the attention and energies of many Americans by 1904. This chapter will describe how the citizens who worked for protection of the Medal of Honor were eventually confronted by the fact that there are “degrees” of courage and service to the Nation, over and above the service normally given by any good soldier. Not all of the extraordinary examples of courage or of service were of the type which would deserve the Medal of Honor. At the same time, all of them deserved recognition, and each degree of valor or service could be looked upon as a step in the direction of that extraordinary service of heroism above and beyond the call of duty which is rewarded, once it has been proved, by the award of the Medal of Honor. And this chapter will describe how the problem of recognition of these lesser deeds was solved by the creation of a system of decorations arranged in an ascending order, with the lowest awards being the most widely distrib- uted—and the Medal of Honor as the final, supreme award, its distribution limited strictly to the handful of those meeting the most severe tests of heroism. Thus, between the medals most widely distributed—and the Medal of Honor, held by only a few, there came all the other awards of Americans in uniform—the Distin- guished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, and all the rest, each one denoting successively higher grades of service or valor—in short, arranged as a “pyramid of honor”, with the Medal of Honor being the highest point, at the very top. The legislation of 1904, described in the last chapter, gave the Medal the maximum protection it had yet achieved. Now thought began to turn to the matter of presentation of the Medal as a means through which it could be further dignified. Google There had been a few scattered instances in which the Medal was presented by the President or another high official The survivors of the Mitchell Raid through Georgia were given their Medals by Secretary of War Stanton, as noted in Chapter Two. When Ulysses S. Grant became president, he presented the Medal in the White House on two separate occasions. While sol- diers of the Civil War had, in some cases, been given their Medals at troop formations and mentioned in the orders of the day, there is only one occasion recorded in which this custom was continued after the Civil War. This took place when a sergeant, William B. Lewis, was honored at Fort Laramie, Wyo., on April 17, 1886. In some cases, the Medals had been sent to winners by registered mail. And, unfortunately, in some cases these Medals had been returned to the War Department because the soldiers who had won them had been dis- charged and their whereabouts were unknown. On December 9, 1904, Maj. William E. Birkhimer— who had been a brigadier general of Volunteers during the Spanish-American War and who was himself a Medal winner—suggested to the Military Secretary in Wash- ington that “every possible attention should be paid to formality and solemnity of circumstance” whenever the Medal was given to its winners. His suggestion was passed up through channels to the Chief of Staff, and after extensive exchanges of correspondence, President Theodore Roosevelt, on September 20, 1905, signed an Executive order directing that awards to those in the service “will always be made with formal and impressive ceremonial”, and that the recipient, “will, when practi- cable, be ordered to Washington, D. C., and the presen- tation will be made by the President, as Commander in Chief, or by such representative as the President may designate.” If it should be impracticable for the winner to come to Washington, the order provided, the Chief of Staff would prescribe the time and place of the ceremony in each case. Asst. Surg. James R. Church, of the Ist U. S. Volun- 19 20 THE MEDAL OF HONOR teers, was the first to receive the Medal in the White House under the terms of this order. ‘The presentation was made by President Roosevelt on January 10, 1906. On April 27, 1916, Congress approved an act which provided for the creation of a “Medal of Honor Roll”, upon which honorably discharged Medal winners who had attained the age of 65 years were to be recorded, with each enrolled person to receive a special pension of $10 per month for life. The primary purpose of this act was to give Medal winners the same special rec- ognition shown to winners of similar British and French decorations for valor. Limiting the award to the nomi- nal sum of ten dollars monthly emphasized that it was not given as a pension, but to provide a small amount for personal comforts in the advanced years of life, at a time when needs are generally not very acute, especially in cases in which the veteran is in receipt of pension bene- fits. The amount was not made larger both because it was contrary to the policy of Congress to recognize dis- tinguished service by pensions, and because to combine an award for conspicuous gallantry with a pension would diminish the honor attached to the award of the medal. The passage of this act marked the successful culmina- tion of a 26-year effort by the Legion of the Medal of Honor—the organization of Medal winners which was formed back in 1890—to obtain, in the words of one of its first documents, “such legislation from Congress as will tend to give the Medal of Honor the same posi- tion among the military orders of the world which simi- lar medals occupy.” Bills aimed at this type of legis- lation had been introduced into Congress recurrently following the organization of the Legion of the Medal of Honor—none of them meeting with success. The successful bill was introduced by Representative Isaac R. Sherwood, of New York, who was a Civil War veteran, breveted Brigadier General by Lincoln. He had fought in 43 battles, being under fire 123 days, and had been complimented in special orders for gallantry in action six times. He had led a full-dress Congressional discussion of the Medal of Honor question on the floor of the House on July 6, 1914. The act of April 27, 1916 provided for enrollment “upon written application being made to the Secretary of the proper department”—War or Navy—‘and sub- ject to the conditions and requirements hereinafter con- tained”’, of “the name of each surviving person who has served in the military or naval service of the United States in any war, who has attained or shall attain the age of sixty-five years . . .” It then laid down the condition that the applicant’s Medal of Honor should Google have been won by action involving actual conflict with an enemy, distinguished by conspicuous gallantry or intrepidity, at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty. Then the act specified that the Secretary of War. or of the Navy would be responsible to decide whether each applicant would be entitled to the benefits of the act. If the official award as originally made appeared to the War Department to conform to the criteria established by the statute, this automatically entitled the applicant to the pension without further investigation. If, on the other hand, a doubt arose as to whether or not the appli- cant was entitled to entry on the roll, Te to quote the act further, “all official correspondence, orders, reports, recommendations, requests and other evidence now on file in any public office or department shall be considered.” What was to be done if, after the consideration of these documents, the War Department felt that the applicant was ineligible, was defined on June 3, 1916, in section 122 of the Army reorganization bill. This act provided for appointment by the Secretary of War of a board of five retired general officers for the purpose of “investi- gating and reporting upon past awards or issue of the so- called congressional medal of honor by or through the War Department; this with a view to ascertain what medals of honor, if any, have been awarded or issued for any cause other than distinguished conduct .. . in- volving actual conflict with an enemy .. .” *‘And in any case’’, this act continued, “in which said board shall find and report that said medal was issued for any cause other than that hereinbefore specified, the name of the recipient of the medal so issued shall be stricken permanently from the official Medal of Honor list. It shall be a misdemeanor for him to wear or publicly dis- play such Medal, and, if he shall still be in the Army, he shall be required to return said Medal to the War Depart- ment for cancellation.” By October 16, 1916, the board created by this act had met, gathered all Medal of Honor records, prepared sta- tistics, classified cases and organized evidence which might be needed in its deliberations. Between October 16, 1916, and January 17, 1917, all of the 2,625 Medals of Honor which had been awarded up to that time were con- sidered by the board, and on February 15, 1917, 911 names were stricken from the list. Of these 911 names, 864 were involved in one group— a case in which the Medal had been given to members of asingle regiment. In this group case as well as in the remaining 47 scattered cases, the board felt that the Medal had not been properly awarded for distinguished serv- ices, by the definition of the act of June 3, 1916. “THE PYRAMID OF HONOR” 21 In its final report, the board indicated that in the large majority of cases “the medals have been awarded for distinguished conduct in action, measuring that term by the highest standard, and there can be no question as to the propriety of the award.” In somé cases, the board reported, the rewards the men received were “greater than would now be given for the same acts”, but in the absence of evidence to the contrary, “‘and because there has been no high judicial interpreta- tion of the Medal of Honor laws” the board found that there were “‘but few instances where the Medal has not been awarded for distinguished services.” The 911 cases which did not pass the board’s investiga- tion were turned over to the War Department, and against each of the names involved was stamped the inscription, “Stricken from the list February 15, 1917, Adverse Action Medal of Honor Board—A. G. 2411162.” This board had few legal definitions to guide it in its work. It had to work with a quantity of regulations and precedents in making its decisions, and this mass of in- formation was uncoordinated and even, in some cases, conflicting. For example, the act of April 27, 1916, pro- vided for a ‘““Medal of Honor Roll” for those who met the definition of valor above and beyond the call of duty; whereas the original act creating the Medal on July 12, 1862, specified only gallantry in action and “other soldier- like qualities” as the basis for award. In 1918, Congress decided to clear away any incon- sistencies of the legislation which had grown around the Medal and make aset of perfectly clear rules for its award. On July 9, 1918, an act was approved which stated as follows: “, . . the provisions of existing law relating to the award of Medals of Honor are, amended so that the President is authorized to present, in the name of the Congress, a Medal of Honor only to each person who, while an officer or enlisted man of the Army, shall hereafter, in action involving actual conflict with an enemy, distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.” At one stroke, by use of the word “hereafter”, this legislation wiped out of existence the War Department’s problem of acting on numerous ancient and complicated claims for Medals originating as far back as the Civil War. Atthesame time, it clearly defined the type of deed which could win a Medal. But these were not the only provisions of this 1918 Act. It directed that enlisted men who were Medal win- ners should receive $2 extra in their military pay. This Google matter of an extra $2 per month, as we have noted in Chapter 2, was intertwined with the Certificate of Merit. The 1918 legislation abolished the Certificate of Merit and replaced it by a new medal—the Distinguished Serv- ice Medal—still retaining the extra pay feature. The Distinguished Service Cross was brought into existence so that the Medal of Honor would be more pro- tected. The Committee on Military Affairs, which had prepared the bill, stated that, “It is believed that if a secondary medal had been authorized in the past, the award of the Medal of Honor would have been much more jealously guarded than it was for many years. And it is certain that the establishment of such a secondary medal now will go far toward remov- ing the temptation to laxity with regard to future awards of the greater medal.” However, it would have been illogical to have a “sec- ondary” medal which carried the old Certificate of Merit provision for $2 extra pay per month, while the “greater medal”—the Medal of Honor—had no such provision attached to it. ‘Therefore, the extra pay feature was added to the award of the Medal of Honor. But possibly the most important and far-reaching effect of this 1918 legislation was the fact that for the first time in American history it was established by law that there were degrees of service to the country, each worthy of recognition, but only one of which could be accorded supreme recognition. In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross, the 1918 act also created the Distinguished Service Medal and the Silver Star, each of them lower in precedence. The building of the “Pyramid of Honor” had begun. At the topmost point of this pyramid, the Nation had placed the Medal of Honor, restricting its award only to the handful who could qualify by the most rigid defini- tion of courage. Underneath it had been placed the Distinguished Service Cross, with its restrictions less rigid, allowing more people to qualify for its award. Once this precedent had been set, the way was made clear for all the other decorations which have since been cre- ated, to meet specific needs, during our military history. Beneath the Distinguished Service Cross came the Dis- tinguished Service Medal, which can be awarded for exceptionally meritorious service other than in combat against an armed enemy, then the Silver Star; later, the Legion of Merit; the Soldier’s Medal; the Purple Heart (revived on February 22, 1932); and the others—each in its order of “rank”, or importance. The order of im- portance of these medals is described in full in the Appen- dix, with accompanying chart. This legislation also made it clear that recommenda- tions for such awards had to be made within 2 years 22 THE MEDAL OF HONOR after the act involved, and laid down the time limit of 3 years as that in which the medals involved could be issued, following the date of the act meriting their award. It provided that not more than one medal should be issued to any one person, but that for each succeeding act justifying the award a suitable bar or other device could be awarded by the President. The President was authorized to delegate award of all four medals with which this 1918 act was concerned—the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Serv- ice Medal and Silver Star—to commanding generals of armies or higher units in the field. Inasmuch as the legislation defining all these points was not passed until close to the end of World War I, only four Medals of Honor were approved before the Armis- tice. The Medal winners in these cases were Capt. George C. McMurtry, Private Thomas C. Neibaur, Maj. Charles W. Whittlesey, and 1st Lt. Samuel Woodifill. In order to insure fairness to all, Gen. John J. Pershing issued instructions to various commanding officers of the American Expeditionary Forces to submit recommenda- tions for award of the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, and Distinguished Service Medal. Rec- ommendations were to come from regimental command- ers, or, in the cases of men not in regiments, from the commanders corresponding as nearly as possible to the grade of regimental commander. General Pershing also appointed a board of officers at his headquarters to con- sider recommendations for the decorations. The recom- mendations so screened were then passed on to the Com- mander in Chief. From these procedures there evolved the methods of examining possible awards which were used throughout World War II. Among the major requirements estab- lished at Headquarters, AEF, was one which specified that each recommendation for a Medal of Honor must cite a specific action on a particular day or in a particu- lar engagement, giving the place and details of the action and the numbers of troops involved. It was also speci- fied that each recommendation must be accompanied by sworn statements of two or more persons who were eye- witnesses of the action for which the Medal was recom- mended. Five days after the Armistice, General Pershing not only directed that a careful review be made of each case which had been submitted for award of the Distinguished Service Cross, but he also sent to headquarters of each division an officer thoroughly familiar with the forms necessary to substantiate awards of the Medal of Honor. He ordered that these officers were to be given every pos- sible assistance in obtaining necessary evidence for Medal of Honor award in these cases, so that the Distinguished Google Service Cross would not be given when a case merited the Medal of Honor. Up to November 23, 1918, 24 Medal of Honor recom- mendations had been received in the Personnel Bureau, AEF, and 4 approved, as mentioned above. As of that date, the Personnel Bureau became the Personnel Divi- sion of The Adjutant General’s Office, and Lt. Col. J. A. Ulhio continued as chief of the Decorations Section within this new division. Medal of Honor recommendations and those pertain- ing to other decorations were handled at General Per- shing’s Headquarters at Chaumont, France, between November 1918 and July 1919. They were submitted to the War Department, and during this|period 78 Medal of Honor awards were made. General Pershing personally reviewed each recom- mendation and the supporting documents. Following World War I, Army Regulations were changed so that not more than one Medal could be issued to one person, as directed by the 1918 legislation. Up to that time five men had been awarded two Medals of Honor. They were— Frank D. Baldwin, Captain, Company D, 19th Michigan Infantry. Thomas Custer, Second Lieutenant, Company B, 6th Michigan Cavalry. Henry Hogan, First Sergeant, Company G, 5th U.S. Infantry. Patrick Leonard, Sergeant, Company C, 2d U. S. Cavalry (1870), and Corporal, Company A, 23d U. S. Infantry (1876). William Wilson, Sergeant, Company I, 4th U. S. Cavalry. Until June 30, 1921, the Badge and Medal Section in The Adjutant General’s Office functioned within very limited areas of administration. On that date, the Sec- retary of War directed The Adjutant leaps to take over all operating functions connected with the award of medals and decorations. : The patent which had been taken out for protection of the design of the Medal expired on November 21, 1918. When this situation was referred to The Judge Advocate General of the Army for an opinion, he stated that this method of protecting the design should be re- placed by legislative action forbidding imitations on the part of Congress. A bill for this purpose was recom- mended by the War Department, passed Congress, and was approved by the President on February 24, 1923. Imitation of the design of the Medal was now forbidden by law. ' “THE PYRAMID OF HONOR” 23 The last Medal of Honor which could be awarded under the legislation of 1918—which specified that the award could be made not more than 3 years from the date of the act which won it—was presented to the Am- erican Unknown Soldier on Armistice Day of 1921. The bill which allowed it to be awarded to an unidentified soldier was signed by the President on August 24, 1921. The Medal was pinned on the flag draping the coffin of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery by President Warren G. Harding, at services in the Amphi- theater of the Cemetery. At the same time, the President pinned to the flag high awards of Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. All of these nations had authorized award of their highest decorations to the American Unknown Soldier, and the ceremony was attended by dignitaries of each of these countries. During the post-World War I period, special Congres- sional action and Executive orders allowed the award of the Medal of Honor to Unknown Soldiers of nations which had been our allies in the conflict. On March 4, 1921, an act was approved awarding the Medal to the Unknown British and French Soldiers, and on October 12, 1921, a similar act awarded it to the Italian Un- known Soldier. Authorization to award the Medal to the Belgian Un- | known Soldier was given by Executive order of the Presi- dent on December 1, 1922, and a similar authorization was given in the case of the Unknown Rumanian Soldier on June 6, 1923. In the winter of 1919-20, there was some discussion of changing the design of the Medal once again, in order to beautify it, but the prevailing opinion was in favor of leaving it unchanged, and the design remained the same as it 1s today. During the period of 1927-30, the Army War College, which has the mission of training selected officers for duty with the General Staff of the War Department and for high command, made studies of the principles and technical aspects of administration of Medal of Honor awards. ‘Ten student officers had been assigned to make a study of the system of rewards in the Army as early as 1924. Three years later, in 1927, using the earlier study as a guide and source of material, a study of greater scope was finished at the War College. It embraced a full analysis of existing systems of rewards and commenda- tions, and proposed revisions of them to “make available Google to more men and organizations the award of decorations and commendations in one form or another.” This recommendation was based upon the belief of the student officers that ‘“‘in our army, we, up to the pres- ent time, have not fully taken advantage of this means of improvi"
