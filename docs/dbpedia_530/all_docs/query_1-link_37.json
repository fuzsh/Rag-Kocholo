        "text": "I don’t know about you, but some of our senators are eagerly awaiting the results of who won this years coveted Mangum Medal. Let’s take some time to learn about the medal and look over a list of all past recipients to pass the time before the 2013 award winner is announced.\n\nThis oldest student award was established in 1877 in memory of Willie Person Mangum, Class of 1815, who had a distinguished career in politics, including three terms in the U.S. Senate and a leading role in the Whig Party. It is continued by the family of Mangum Turner, Class of 1900. A gold medal is awarded to the member of the senior class who, in the opinion of a group of judges, gives the best oration at an annual contest. The award is administered still today by the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, and the Societies’ Historian generally finds a group of Professors to act as judges. Below is a list of every recipient since 1879:"
