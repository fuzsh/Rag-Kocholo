The site features a game in which users evaluate relative probabilities of interesting events. The concept is then applied to workplace safety, with additional links to work-safety sources.\n\nThe goal of the contest was to encourage entities to build tools to educate the public about safety in the workplace.\n\nFor more information about the contest, visit the Department of Labor’s website.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWilliam “Bill” Neilson, J. Fred Holly Chair of Excellence, became head of the Department of Economics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, College of Business Administration on January 1. He succeeded Robert Bohm, who retired December 2012 after being department head for 10 years.\n\n“As we celebrate the college’s 100th birthday, it is an exciting time to become head of the department,” Neilson said. “Bob left the department in wonderful shape, and I am looking forward to joining the leadership team of the College of Business Administration.”\n\nJan R. Williams, dean of UT’s College of Business Administration and Stokely Foundation Leadership Chair, said that the college is fortunate to have a faculty member with Neilson’s background and talent to assume the department’s head position.\n\n“Bill follows Bob Bohm’s successful time as department head and has two former department heads, Matt Murray and Bill Fox, to advise and support him,” said Williams. “I have coordinated this appointment with incoming dean, Steve Mangum, and we are both looking forward to working with Bill as he assumes this important position.”\n\nNeilson joined the UT economics faculty in 2006 after teaching at Texas A&M University for 18 years. He earned his doctorate in economics from the University of California, San Diego, and his bachelor’s degree in both mathematics and economics from Rice University.\n\nNeilson is an economic theorist; he uses mathematical tools to answer questions relevant to economics. His primary research areas include game theory (the study of interactions among small numbers of individuals or firms), behavior toward risk, and the now-popular field of behavioral economics. He also is interested in issues related to pricing, collusion, social networks, education and law.\n\nNeilson has published more than 40 papers in academic journals. He has also published two textbooks, including the recent Personnel Economics, which discusses how compensation structures can be used to motivate workers, maximize profit, and attract the right applicant pool. He currently serves as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, which handles more than 700 academic papers each year.\n\nAt UT, Neilson teaches macroeconomics, international economics and the economics of strategy in the Executive MBA for Strategic Leadership program. He also teaches game theory and mathematical economics in the economics doctoral program.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nKnoxville—Two student-owned ventures split $20K in seed funding grants from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Boyd Venture Fund. Since the fund’s inception in 2011, eight student-owned companies have been awarded a total of $62.5K in seed capital to achieve milestones that advanced their businesses.\n\nThe Fall 2012 winners were:\n\nInHouse GFX: a company focused on three service areas; screen printing, graphic/print design, and web development\n\nAdams Innovations LLC: a designer, importer and distributor of leisure hammocks with a unique suspension system that eliminates the needs to readjust and reposition the suspension ropes\n\nThe Boyd Venture Fund is administered through the Anderson Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation in UT’s College of Business Administration.\n\nInHouse GFX, founded by Anthony Smith (public relations ’13) and Justin Ruffin (communications ’14), offers custom screen printing, graphic /print design and web development to its target market of sororities, fraternities and campus organizations. InHouse has worked with various UT campus organizations, including the Student Government Association, Team Vols, Me4UT, Alpha Kappa Psi, IFC, NPHC, Black Issue Conference, and numerous Greek organizations. “Our vision is to be on numerous college campuses where we will employ students,” explains Smith. “Our company will provide these students with the opportunity to gain valuable experience in fields such as advertising, sales, marketing, production, management, and customer service.” Ruffin adds: “The Boyd Venture Fund grant will allow us to upgrade our computers and software and hire a much needed part-time production manager.” InHouse GFX can be contacted at: general@inhousegfx.com.\n\nAdams Innovation LLC, founded by Alex Adams (mechanical engineering ’14), designs, imports, and distributes leisure hammocks that are affordable, all-inclusive (hammock and rope suspension system are sold as one unit), and offer a unique suspension system. “I am committed to bringing quality hammocks to a growing market,” says Adams. Adams’s interest in hammocks started during his freshman year at UT. “Hammocks are a great way to relax, but when I had to constantly reposition the ropes to keep the hammock at the height I wanted, I thought that there must be a better way,” he says. His research into ropes and the logging market, which he used to create his unique hammock suspension system, ultimately led to a suspension system that does not require readjustment. He intends to sell his product online and through major outdoor retailers. His Boyd Venture Fund award will allow him to order his initial inventory and be prepared to sell in the Spring. The hammocks are marketed under the trade name Xada. Adams can be contacted at: aadams@xadagear.com.\n\n“Creating new local businesses is the cornerstone to a community’s success,” said fund benefactor Randy Boyd, president and CEO of Radio Systems Corp. “These businesses create jobs, pay taxes that fu nd other investments such as education and support the local community with philanthropy. I cannot imagine a better return on investment than supporting future generations of entrepreneurs.”\n\nBoyd Venture Fund grants are available to any UT Knoxville student-owned business and are awarded each Spring and Fall.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nKNOXVILLE—The College of Business Administration at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, celebrated the accomplishments and service of three alumni and one corporation during its fourth annual Alumni Awards Gala recently.\n\nMore than 250 alumni, faculty, staff and friends of the college attended the event, which included a reception, silent auction, dinner and an awards presentation.

Through skills he learned at UT, he’s poised to do just that. Jay graduated in December from UT’s Executive MBA for Strategic Leadership program.\n\nSoon, the Knoxville-based charity will expand to one other city—Nashville, Indianapolis, or Tampa—with plans to spread to 20 target cities around the country in coming years, and eventually to expand internationally.\n\nJay has received requests from across the country and from people in Australia and England who are interested in his work.\n\n“The goals are simple: Do another one and prove it can be successful again,” said Jay, a former television and film producer.\n\nSince its inception in 2008, Random Acts of Flowers has delivered flowers to almost 20,000 people. The 100 percent recycling green charity receives donated used flowers from weddings, special events, churches, funeral homes, and retailers. The flowers are pulled apart and rebuilt into professional-looking arrangements.\n\n“We’re trying to make one person’s day better with somebody else’s garbage,” Jay said. “We’re helping create an industry that’s a receptacle for the second-hand flower market. There really isn’t an industry that deals with what to do with used flowers. But it’s often the number one question brides and funeral homes have.”\n\nThrough UT’s intensive year-long executive MBA program, Jay gained “the ability to think on a much bigger level and an enormous toolbox of practical knowledge that’s going to help build this into a national charity,” he said. “I learned skills and made connections I didn’t have before.”\n\nThe organization’s business model, he said, is simple—an endless supply of free flowers, countless numbers of people who could use a smile, and a large team of volunteers.\n\n“We fit into one little sliver of the market that no one else touches,” Jay said.\n\nThe idea for the charity was born out of one of the darkest periods of Jay’s life. In summer 2007, a ladder collapsed from underneath him while he was fixing the roof of his workshop in North Knoxville. He landed face down on the concrete, breaking his left arm, left and right wrists, right elbow, right femur, nose, and 10 facial bones.\n\nDuring his time in the intensive care unit, the trauma unit, and then a rehabilitation center, he received multiple deliveries of flowers every day from friends and family around the country. When he was able to leave his room via wheelchair, he noticed many of the patients on his hospital floor had “no flowers, no plants, no visitors, and no life” in their rooms, he said.\n\nSo he and family members loaded up his wheelchair with his excess flowers and delivered them room by room.\n\n“The reactions from the people in the rooms were unbelievable,” Jay said.\n\nA year later, he established Random Acts of Flowers. The organization has about 300 volunteers and a number of partner hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices. The liaisons there identify people who haven’t had visitors or who are having a rough time. Deliveries are made several times every week.\n\nThe organization is supported through financial donations, fundraising events, and grants from corporations and foundations. It delivers 600 to 800 bouquets a month.\n\n“I know virtually nothing about flowers. I’m a TV and film producer,” Jay said. “But I know about happiness and the impact a moment of kindness and compassion can have on a person.”\n\nTo learn more about Random Acts of Flowers, visit www.randomactsofflowers.org.\n\nTo learn about UT’s Executive MBA for Strategic Leadership program, visit the program’s website.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAs a youngster, soon-to-be MBA grad Andrew Haag was severely injured in a horrific car crash that killed his father and one of his brothers.\n\nAs the years passed, he realized the experience made him want to go into hospital administration—because he knows that’s a career where he can have a positive impact.\n\nToday, Haag takes a major step toward that goal when he receives his MBA from UT.\n\n“I know a little about hospitals,” said Haag, of Hendersonville, Tennessee. “I was at Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital for three months. I see hospitals as a place of healing.”\n\nHaag’s tragedy occurred one Christmas Eve; he was eight years old and riding in the car with his father and two brothers. The crash killed his father and middle brother and severely injured Andrew and his oldest brother. Andrew suffered a broken lower back and major abdominal injuries, leaving him unable to walk without forearm crutches and leg braces.\n\nAlready big fans of University of Tennessee football, Haag and his brother, Eric, received phone calls after the accident from then-UT Head Football Coach Phillip Fulmer and quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\n“I remember looking across the hall and seeing my brother’s excitement while talking on the phone,” remembers Haag. “Then my phone rang. It was Coach Fulmer and Peyton Manning. They were in Florida for the Citrus Bowl, and they called us! There are no words to describe what that means to a child at a time like that.”\n\nOver the years, Fulmer remained in contact with the family, bringing both Haag and his brother under his wing as student equipment managers in the Vols football program. With the obvious tie to sports, Haag originally thought his path would be sports management or marketing.\n\n“In my senior year as a marketing major, I decided that sports wasn’t the path I wanted to travel,” Haag said. “I kept thinking about my childhood experiences and realized that the hospital setting was where I could have the most impact. I wasn’t interested in the clinical side —I wanted administration—so I knew I needed to get my MBA.”\n\nWhile earning his MBA, Haag has worked as a graduate assistant in the Center for Executive Education and as an administrative intern at UT Medical Center.\n\n“Being in the hospital strengthened my commitment to the path I am on,” he says. “Whether wearing a white coat in the patient’s room or a business suit in the accounting office, caring for patients is the first priority.”\n\n—\n\nC O N T A C T :\n\nAmy Blakely (865-974-5034, ablakely@utk.edu)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAfter twenty-five years of military service—including multiple tours of duty to Afghanistan and Iraq, playing a role in the Jessica Lynch rescue, and receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism—Troy Boonstra is ready to mark another milestone: his MBA.\n\nBoonstra graduates from UT’s Aerospace and Defense MBA program today.\n\nBoonstra had earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. He joined the military while in college.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, he was based in Kentucky as U.S. Army helicopter pilot with the prestigious 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment Airborne, also known as the Night Stalkers.\n\nHe was at home when the first plane commandeered by a terrorist hit the World Trade Center.\n\n“I told my wife, ‘This is no accident,’ and I headed out the door for the base. I knew something very foreboding was happening.”\n\nBoonstra was walking in the door at his office when the second plane hit the Twin Towers. The elite military team around him stood silent and focused.\n\n“We all just looked at each other and silently started preparing–boxes being packed, gear put in order,” Boonstra said. “We knew. Even in the midst of the tragedy, I felt such pride that we were ready. We didn’t know how, why, or what, but we were ready.”\n\nThe unit was deployed almost immediately. “The 160th was smaller then,” Boonstra said. “It is the only unit I know of that has been constantly deployed since 9/11.”\n\nBoonstra’s deployments included two tours of duty in Afghanistan and thirteen tours of duty in Iraq. He was part of the Jessica Lynch rescue, providing aviation support for the ground forces that went in to get her.\n\nThere were other rescue missions for Boonstra, but the details aren’t things he can talk about.\n\n“Rescue operations always touch something in a soldier. Being able to bring someone home to enjoy the freedoms we are fighting for is a great honor,” he said.\n\nBoonstra retired in 2009 and now lives Tucson, Arizona He is a program manager in advanced missile systems for the Raytheon Company, which specializes in defense, homeland security, and other government markets.\n\n“As I get increasing levels of leadership, I thought it was important to understand the business side of my industry,” he said, explaining why he opted for UT’s ADMBA program.\n\nBoonstra said the lessons he learned in his almost twenty-five years of military service have helped him in the business world and in the classroom.\n\n“What makes a successful business is very much like what makes a good special ops unit,” he said. “You need a high-reliability organization with processes and procedures for getting things done. But you also need leaders who can make decisions based on gut and intuition.\n\n“In business and in the military, that intuition is based on your experiences, years of learning, pattern recognition, and the ability to think on your feet. These traits are prominent in many of my classmates. The ADMBA faculty and class of 2012 are another exceptional team of which I am proud to be a part.”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
