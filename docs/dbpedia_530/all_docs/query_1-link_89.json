        "text": "Doug Burt\n\nFootball 7/13/2023 3:11:00 PM\n\nNCCU QB Richard Receives Scholar-Athlete Award from NFF Dooley Chapter\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. – The National Football Foundation's Bill Dooley Chapter announced North Carolina Central University quarterback Davius Richard as a recipient of the 2023 University Scholar-Athlete Award on Thursday.\n\nRichard (Belle Glade, Fla.) led the NCCU Eagles to a MEAC title and an HBCU national championship in 2022, capping the historic season with an MVP performance during the Cricket Celebration Bowl victory. The MEAC Offensive Player of the Year topped the conference in passing yards (2,661), passing TDs (25), and rushing TDs (15), while breaking NCCU single-season records for pass completions (199), pass completion percentage (64.0%), and total offense (3,449). After three seasons (2019, 2021-22), Richard ranks second on NCCU's all-time career passing list with 6,814 passing yards and 52 passing touchdowns and is second in career total offense with 8,210 total yards. He graduated magna cum laude as a business administration major in December 2022, and is pursuing his MBA while completing his final season of athletic eligibility.\n\nJoining Richard in earning the distinction this year are Myles Berry (East Carolina), Darius Joiner (Duke), Asim Richards (North Carolina), and Payton Wilson (N.C. State).\n\nBerry, a linebacker from Greensboro, N.C., booked 148 tackles, 8.0 tackles for loss, and four sacks in 58 career games while making 22 combined starts during his Pirates tenure. The 2022 team co-captain and two-time AAC All-Academic Team selection graduated from East Carolina with a degree in industrial distribution and logistics in December 2021, before receiving a master's degree from the university in technology management in May 2023.\n\nJoiner, a safety from Roanoke, Ala., wrapped up his college career having compiled 320 tackles, 19.0 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks, four interceptions, 14 pass breakups, three caused fumbles, one fumble recovery and five quarterback pressures in 53 career games (28 starts) at Duke, Western Illinois, and Jacksonville State. A 2022 third team All-ACC honoree and College Sports Communicators Academic All-America® Second Team pick, he graduated in May 2023, after receiving a master's degree in management studies from Duke's Fuqua School of Business.\n\nRichards, an offensive lineman from Philadelphia, Pa., played in 48 games, making 38 starts, during his career. He logged over 2,500 snaps before being drafted in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. Richards earned third-team All-ACC honors as a senior and was a stalwart along the offensive line for one of the nation's most explosive offenses over the last four years. He was an All-ACC Academic honoree and an ACC Honor Roll member, while earning his degree in exercise and sport science.\n\nWilson, a hard-hitting linebacker from Hillsborough, N.C., was one of the ACC leaders in tackles in 2022 and was a semifinalist for the National Comeback Player of the Year Award, after he returned to the starting lineup following multiple surgeries. He earned his undergraduate degree in education and is enrolled in postgraduate courses.\n\nNFF Dooley Chapter – University Scholar-Athlete Award recipients\n\n2023: Myles Berry, East Carolina University; Darius Joiner, Duke University; Davius Richard, North Carolina Central University; Asim Richards, University of North Carolina; Payton Wilson, N.C.

Central University and North Carolina State University to join him and N.C. Governor Jim Hunt at the State Capitol Old Senate Chambers. It was at that meeting that the universities pledged their\n\nsupport to the newly formed NFFCHOF Chapter and its mission. In 2012, East Carolina University joined the Chapter and, in 2014, the NFFCHOF Board of Directors unanimously voted to name the chapter after its founder.\n\nFor more information on NCCU Athletics, visit NCCUEaglePride.com or download the NCCU Eagles Athletics app.\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
