CHARLIE ROSE of north carolina in the house of representatives Wednesday, October 5, 1994 Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, I am pleased to be able to bring to my colleagues attention that the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service within the Library of Congress is the 1994 recipient of the American Bar Association's Hodson Award. This prestigious award, presented last month by the Government and Public Sector Lawyers Division of ABA, is ``in recognition of sustained extraordinary service and achievement in the field of public law.'' The American Law Division provides objective, nonpartisan, and confidential research, analysis, and information services to a clientele of 535 House and Senate offices, over 250 committees and subcommittees, and congressional support offices. Over the last 10 years, the American Law Division, with a staff of 65 attorneys, paralegals, and library and support staff, has processed more than 147,000 legal inquiries, produced more than 3,200 reports and confidential opinions and analyses. As chairman of the Committee on House Administration, I have come to rely on the expertise of the Division frequently for legal advice and information. Most recently, Vince Treacy, Jay Shampansky, and Charles Dale assisted in the markup of legislation that would apply various laws to the Congress and briefed Members on the potential implications of the proposed legislation. Their expertise was invaluable to the legislative consideration of this complex piece of legislation. The Hodson Award recognized the outstanding public service provided by the American Law Division. Since the entire division--attorneys, paralegals, library and production staff--shares in the award and should be proud of this recognition, I think it appropriate to list them by name: David Ackerman, Pamela Baldwin, Anita Basilio, Elizabeth Bazan, Frances Bufalo, Fay Butler, Robert Burdette, Thomas P. Carr, Jean Clark, Henry Cohen, John Contrubis, George Costello, Charles Dale, Charles Doyle, Diane Duffy, Thomas M. Durbin, Richard C. Ehlke, Larry Eig, Dana L. Ely, Ida Eustis, Harry Gourevitch, Kevin B. Greely. Jeanne J. Grimmett, Mark Gurevitz, Robin Jeweler, Nancy L. Jones, Johnny Killian, Robin Lancaster-Campbell, Ellen Lazarus, Margaret M. Lee, Karen J. Lewis, John R. Luckey, Crystal Maiden-Thomas, George Mangan, Lavonne M. Mangan, Jack H. Maskell, Michael Materon, Robert Meltz, Paul L. Morgan, Marie B. Morris, M. Maureen Murphy, Ingrid Nelson, Thomas Nicola, Maria Pembrook. Vastine Platte, Robert D. Poling, Mabel Reyes, Thomas B. Ripy, Kent M. Ronhovde, Morton Rosenberg, Janice E. Rubin, Michael Seitzinger, Jay R. Shampansky, Gina M. Stevens, Gloria P. Sugars, Kathleen S. Swendiman, Ken Thomas, Joyce Thorpe, Brenda Todd, Vincent E. Treacy, Mildred Washington, Douglas R. Weimer, L. Paige Whitaker, Carolyn Wilson, Mary Ann Wolfe, James A. Ziegler. In congratulating the American Law Division, Librarian of Congress, Dr James Billington acknowledged that the staff of the Division ``brings a unique honor to the Library'' and that ``their skill, diligence, and hard work have benefited not only Members and their staffs but have contributed greatly to the mission of the entire Library.'' Daniel Mulhollan, Director of CRS, echoed these sentiments in noting that the ``American Law Division's tradition of service, and the skill by which it is delivered, is a priceless asset that has earned the Division well deserved respect, not only from our congressional clients but also from your colleagues in CRS and the Library.'' It is with sincere gratitude for the extraordinary work in support of the legislative, oversight, and representative functions of the Members of Congress that, on behalf of the U.S. Congress, I commend and congratulate the American Law Division. ____________________"
