A micronation, sometimes referred to as a model coun-\n\n1.1.1 Etymology\n\nThe term 'micronation' literally means “small nation”. It is a neologism originating in the mid-1970s to describe the many thousands of small unrecognised state-like entities that have mostly arisen since that time. It is generally accepted that the term was invented by Robert Ben Madison. The term has since also come to be used retrospectively to refer to earlier unrecognised entities, some of which date to as far back as the 19th century. Supporters of micronations (“micronationalists”) use the term “macronation” for any UN-recognized sovereign nation-state.\n\nThe Principality of Sealand, a micronation.\n\nNot all micronations are small; some can be rather large, like the Dominion of British West Florida or those with try or new country project, is an entity that claims to claims on Antarctica or other planets. be an independent nation or state but is not oﬃcially recognized by world governments or major international organizations. 1.1.2 Deﬁnition Micronations are distinguished from imaginary countries and from other kinds of social groups (such as ecovillages, campuses, tribes, clans, sects, and residential community associations) by expressing a formal and persistent, even if unrecognized, claim of sovereignty over some physical territory.\n\nMicronations generally have a number of common features, although these may vary widely. They may have a structure similar to established sovereign states, including territorial claims, government institutions, oﬃcial symbols and citizens, albeit on a much smaller scale. Micronations are often quite small, in both their claimed territory and claimed populations — although there are some exceptions to this rule, with diﬀerent micronations having diﬀerent methods of citizenship. Micronations may also issue formal instruments such as postage stamps, coins, banknotes and passports, and bestow honours and titles of nobility.\n\nSeveral micronations have issued coins, ﬂags, postage stamps, passports, medals, and other items, which are rarely accepted outside of their own community. The earliest known micronations date from the beginning of the 19th century. The advent of the Internet provided the means for people to create many new micronations, whose members are scattered all over the world and interact mostly by electronic means, often calling their nations Nomadic Countries. The diﬀerences between such Internet micronations, other kinds of social networking groups, and role playing games are often diﬃcult to deﬁne.[1]\n\nThe Montevideo Convention was one attempt to create a legal deﬁnition distinguishing between states and nonstates. Some micronations meet this deﬁnition, while some do not, and others reject the Convention altogether. The academic study of micronations, and microstates is 1\n\n2\n\nCHAPTER 1. AN INTRODUCTION\n\nknown as micropatrology, and the hobby of establishing and operating micronations is known as micronationalism.\n\n1.1.3\n\nCategories\n\nIn the present day, nine main types of micronations are prevalent: 1. Social, economic, or political simulations. 2. Exercises in personal entertainment or selfaggrandisement. 3. Exercises in fantasy or creative ﬁction. 4. Vehicles for the promotion of an agenda. 5. Entities created for fraudulent purposes. 6. Historical anomalies and aspirant states. 7. New-country projects. 8. Exercises in historical revisionism. 9. Alternative governments. Social, economic, or political simulations These micronations tend to have a reasonably serious intent, and often involve signiﬁcant numbers of people interested in recreating the past or simulating political or social processes. Examples include:\n\n• Republic of Jamtland, a self-proclaimed republic in the county of Jämtland, Sweden. It was founded in 1963 due to Sweden’s social welfare politics, which wanted Jämtland to merge with the county of Västernorrland and wanted more people to move away from the countryside of northern Sweden and into the big cities of southern Sweden. This started protests in Jämtland and later that year they declared themselves a free republic within the Kingdom of Sweden. The Republic of Jämtland has a population of 130,573 inhabitants and has an area of 19,090.4 square miles. Jämtland also has embassies and consulates in 17 diﬀerent countries, such as China, Germany, the USA, England, Norway and Russia. In 1967, Yngve Gamlin, the president of the republic at that time, went to see the Swedish prime minister Tage Erlander about merging with Västernorrland county. Yngve was greeted at Harpsund estate by Tage as a chief of state on a state visit to Sweden. This gave Jamtland some recognition from Sweden as a free republic. This event has, however, been debated whether it should be seen as formal recognition or not. • Holy Empire of Reunion, a Brazilian micronation founded in 1997 as an online constitutional monarchy simulation. It claims several dozen members around the world. It has minted coins and produced ﬂags, banknotes and passports for its citizens. According to a report by BBC, Réunion has contacts with 175 micronations all over the world.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]\n\nExercises in personal entertainment or self• Freetown Christiania, a semi-legal district in aggrandisement Copenhagen, Denmark • Kingdom of Elleore, micronation founded 1944 on With literally thousands in existence, micronations of the the small island of Elleore in the Roskilde Fjord, second type are by far the most common.

Examples real-life Roman-themed re-enactments. include: • Grand Duchy of Flandrensis: a Belgian micronation with claims over some territories of Antarctica. The micronation is also a political simulation and cultural organization.

At one point, Atlantis sent a delegation to the legitimate state of Palau to oﬀer a low interest loan of $100 million.[29][30][31]\n\nA number of micronations have been established for Historical anomalies, legal anomalies and aspirant fraudulent purposes, by seeking to link questionable or states illegal ﬁnancial actions with seemingly legitimate nations. • The Territory of Poyais was invented by Scottish adventurer and South American independence hero Gregor MacGregor in the early 19th century. On the basis of a land grant made to him by the Anglophile native King of the Mosquito people in what is present-day Honduras, MacGregor wove one of history’s most elaborate hoaxes, managing to charm the highest levels of London's political and ﬁnancial establishment with tales of the bucolic, resourcerich country he claimed to rule as a benevolent sovereign prince, or “Cazique”, when he arrived in the UK in 1822.

Hill claims that the dowry was never paid and therefore it is not part of UK and should be a crown dependency like the Isle of Man. Hill has also encouraged the rest of Shetland to declare independence.[33] • The Free Republic of Liberland is a small, unclaimed parcel of land between Croatia and Serbia, sharing a land border with Croatia and having its eastern border on the Danube river. It was proclaimed by Vít Jedlička on April 13, 2015. The unclaimed land was created because of the CroatiaSerbia border dispute, which made lots of parcels of land claimed by both countries and parcels that were claimed by neither. It has not been oﬃcially recognised by any country in the United Nations as of May 6, 2015. New-country projects New-country projects are attempts to found completely new nation-states. They typically involve plans to construct artiﬁcial islands (few of which are ever realised), and a large percentage have embraced or purported to embrace libertarian or democratic principles. Examples include:\n\n5 2001. If the Awdal Road Company was able to build a road, then the Sultan of Awdal will give land to allow them ARC to create an economic free zone, and some of that territory will then be handed over to the Principality of Freedonia. After the men from Awdal Roads Company were deported following false allegations about the lease, resulting public dissatisfaction led to rioting, and the reported death of a Somali. • Republic of Rose Island, an artiﬁcial island constructed in 1968 by Italian architect Giorgio Rosa in the Adriatic Sea. The structure was originally built as a tourist attraction, but soon after it was ﬁnished, Rosa declared sovereignty. • Oceania (also known as “The Atlantis Project”, but unrelated to the 1970s project listed above), another libertarian artiﬁcial island project that raised US$400,000 before going bankrupt in 1994.[34] • Seasteading, a project aimed at building competitive governments at sea. • Global Country of World Peace, “a country without borders for peace-loving people everywhere”, was declared by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 2000. It made several attempts to buy or lease land for a sovereign territory.[35] It is currently governed by Maharaja Tony Nader.[36] Its currency is the RAAM and its capitals include Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa and MERU, Holland.\n\n• Operation Atlantis, an early 1970s New York–based Exercises in historical revisionism libertarian group, built a concrete-hulled ship called • In Germany, numerous individuals and groups— Freedom, which they sailed to the Caribbean, incollectively labeled Kommissarische Reichsregieruntending to permanently anchor it as their “territory”. gen (KRR)—assert that the German Empire continThe ship sank in a hurricane and the project colues to exist in its pre-World War II borders and that lapsed with it. they are its government, or government-in-exile.[37]\n\nLanding on Minerva\n\n• The Imperial Throne formerly the Russian Empire, is a micronation created in 2011 by Russian businessman and politician Anton Bakov, chairman of the Monarchist Party of the Russian Federation. In 2014, the Imperial Throne proclaimed that Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen, one of several claimants to the royal Romanov line, was now Nicholas III, Emperor of All Russia. The Imperial Throne claims to be in contact with the governments of Macedonia and Montenegro about a grant of territory and state recognition.\n\n• Republic of Minerva, another libertarian project that succeeded in building a small man-made island on the Minerva Reefs south of Fiji in 1972 before being invaded by troops from Tonga, who formally 1.1.4 History annexed it before destroying the island. Early history and evolution • Principality of Freedonia, a libertarian project that supported the Awdal Road Company’s attempts to The oldest extant micronation to arise in modern times lease land from the Sultan of Awdal in Somaliland in is the Kingdom of Redonda, founded in 1865 in the\n\n6 Caribbean. It failed to establish itself as a real country, but has nonetheless managed to survive into the present day as a unique foundation with its own king and aristocracy—although it is not without its controversies: there are presently at least four competing claimants to the Redondan throne. Martin Coles Harman, owner of the British island of Lundy in the early decades of the 20th century, declared himself King and issued private coinage and postage stamps for local use. Although the island was ruled as a virtual ﬁefdom, its owner never claimed to be independent of the United Kingdom, so Lundy can at best be described as a precursor to later territorial micronations. Another example is the Principality of Outer Baldonia, a 16-acre (65,000 m2 ) rocky island oﬀ the coast of Nova Scotia, founded by Russell Arundel, chairman of the Pepsi Cola Company (later: PepsiCo), in 1945 and comprising a population of 69 ﬁshermen.\n\nCHAPTER 1. AN INTRODUCTION coast of Jamaica. This territory, consisting of an 8-foot (2.4 m) by 30-foot (9.1 m) barge, he called “New Atlantis”. Hemingway was an honorary citizen and President; however, the structure was damaged by storms and ﬁnally pillaged by Mexican ﬁshermen. In 1973, Hemingway was reported to have moved on from New Atlantis to promoting a 1,000 sq yd (840 m2 ) platform near the Bahamas. The new country was called “Tierra del Mar” (Land of the Sea). (Ernest Hemingway’s adopted hometown of Key West was later itself part of another micronation; see Conch Republic.) The Republic of Minerva was set up in 1972 as a libertarian new-country project by Nevada businessman Michael Oliver. Oliver’s group conducted dredging operations at the Minerva Reefs, a shoal located in the Paciﬁc Ocean south of Fiji. They succeeded in creating a small artiﬁcial island, but their eﬀorts at securing international recognition met with little success, and near-neighbour Tonga sent a military force to the area and annexed it. On April 1, 1977, bibliophile Richard Booth declared the Welsh town of Hay-on-Wye an independent kingdom with himself as its monarch. The town subsequently developed a healthy tourism industry based on literary interests, and “King Richard” (whose sceptre is a recycled toilet plunger) continues to award Hay-on-Wye peerages and honours to anyone prepared to pay for them.[38] Japanese micronations in the 1980s\n\nThe 550 m2 (5,900 sq ft) Principality of Sealand\n\nHistory during 1960 to 1980 The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the foundation of a number of territorial micronations. The ﬁrst of these, Sealand, was established in 1967 on an abandoned World War II gun platform in the North Sea just oﬀ the East Anglian coast of England, and has survived into the present day. Others were founded on libertarian principles and involved schemes to construct artiﬁcial islands, but only three are known to have had even limited success in realizing that goal.\n\nIn 1981, drawing on a news report about Leicester Hemingway’s “New Atlantis”, novelist Hisashi Inoue wrote a 700-page work of magic realism, Kirikirijin, about a village that secedes from Japan and proclaims its bumpkinish, marginalized dialect its national language, and its subsequent war of independence. This single-handedly inspired a large number of Japanese villages, mostly in the northern regions, to “declare independence”, generally as a move to raise awareness of their unique culture and crafts for urban Japanese who saw village life as backwards and uncultured. These micronations even held “international summits” from 1983 to 1985, and some of them formed confederations. Throughout the 1980s there was a “micronation boom” in Japan that brought many urban tourists to these wayward villages. But the harsh economic impact of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991 ended the boom. Many of the villages were forced to merge with larger cities, and the micronations and confederations were generally dissolved.[39]\n\nThe Republic of Rose Island was a 400 m2 (4,300 sq ft) platform built in 1968 in Italian national waters in the Adriatic Sea, 7 miles (11 km) oﬀ the Italian town of Rimini. It is known to have issued stamps, and to have Australian and New Zealand developments declared Esperanto to be its oﬃcial language.

An early example is the Kingdom of Talossa, a micronation created in 1979 by then 14-yearold Robert Ben Madison, which went online in November 1995, and was reported in the New York Times and other print media in 2000.[40] As a result, the number of exclusively online, fantasy or simulation-based micronations expanded dramatically. The activities of these types of micronations are almost exclusively limited to simulations of diplomatic activity (including the signing of “treaties” and participation in “supra-micronational” forums such as the League of Micronations) and contribution to wikis. With the introduction of the Internet, many articles on how to create micronations were made available on such wikis, which serve as a hub of online activity for micronations. A number of traditional territorial micronations, including the Hutt River Province, Seborga, and Sealand, maintain websites that serve largely to promote their claims and sell merchandise.\n\nIV. Territorial integrity of States The participating States will respect the territorial integrity of each of the participating States. Accordingly, they will refrain from any action inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations against the territorial integrity, political independence or the unity of any participating State, and in particular from any such action constituting a threat or use of force. The participating States will likewise refrain from making each other’s territory the object of military occupation or other direct or indirect measures of force in contravention of international law, or the object of acquisition by means of such measures or the threat of them. No such occupation or acquisition will be recognized as legal. In eﬀect, this states that other states (i.e., third parties), may not encourage secession in a state. This does not make any statement as regards persons within a state electing to secede of their own accord.\n\n8\n\n1.1.6\n\nCHAPTER 1.

For other uses, see Sovereign (disambiguation). Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity.[1] It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation. Derived from Latin through French souveraineté, its attainment and retention, in both Chinese and Western[2] culture, has traditionally been associated with certain moral imperatives upon any claimant.\n\n1.2. SOVEREIGNTY\n\n11 Often, these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the case – they are not aﬀected by one another, and there are historical examples of states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being sovereign in another of these aspects.[6] According to Immanuel Wallerstein, another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that it is a claim that must be recognised by others if it is to have any meaning: “Sovereignty is more than anything else a matter of legitimacy [...that] requires reciprocal recognition. Sovereignty is a hypothetical trade, in which two potentially conﬂicting sides, respecting de facto realities of power, exchange such recognitions as their least costly strategy.”[7]\n\n1.2.2 History Classical The Roman jurist Ulpian observed that:[8] • The imperium of the people is transferred to the Emperor. • The Emperor is not bound by the law. • The Emperor’s word is law. Emperor is the law making and abiding force. The frontispiece of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, depicting the Sovereign as a massive body wielding a sword and crozier and composed of many individual people.\n\nUlpian was expressing the idea that the Emperor exercised a rather absolute form of sovereignty, although he did not use the term expressly.\n\n1.2.1\n\nMedieval\n\nDiﬀerent approaches\n\nThe concept of sovereignty has been discussed throughout history, from the time before recorded history through to the present day.[3][4] It has changed in its definition, concept, and application throughout, especially during the Age of Enlightenment. The current notion of state sovereignty contains four aspects consisting of territory, population, authority and recognition.[5] According to Stephen D. Krasner, the term could also be understood in four diﬀerent ways:\n\nClassical Ulpian’s statements were known in medieval Europe, but sovereignty was an important concept in medieval times.[1] Medieval monarchs were not sovereign, at least not strongly so, because they were constrained by, and shared power with, their feudal aristocracy.[1] Furthermore, both were strongly constrained by custom.[1] Sovereignty existed during the Medieval Period as the de jure rights of nobility and royalty, and in the de facto capability of individuals to make their own choices in life.\n\n• domestic sovereignty – actual control over a state ex- Around c. 1380–1400, the issue of feminine sovereignty ercised by an authority organized within this state,[6] was addressed in Geoﬀrey Chaucer’s Middle English collection of Canterbury Tales, speciﬁcally in The Wife of • interdependence sovereignty – actual control of Bath’s Tale.[9] movement across state’s borders, assuming the bor- A later English Arthurian romance, The Wedding of Sir ders exist,[6] Gawain and Dame Ragnell (c. 1450),[10] uses much of • international legal sovereignty – formal recognition the same elements of the Wife of Bath’s tale, yet changes the setting to the court of King Arthur and the Knights of by other sovereign states,[6] the Round Table.

AN INTRODUCTION From men both lund and poor, To have sovereignty without lies. For where we have sovereignty, all is ours, Though a knight be ever so ﬁerce, And ever win mastery. It is our desire to have master Over such a sir.\n\nDespite his commitment to absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a senate from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, and to use the Estates as a means of communicating with the people.\n\nSuch is our purpose. — The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell (c. 1450), [10]\n\nWith his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred by divine law, Bodin predeﬁned the scope of the divine right of kings.\n\nReformation Sovereignty reemerged as a concept in the late 16th century, a time when civil wars had created a craving for stronger central authority, when monarchs had begun to gather power onto their own hands at the expense of the nobility, and the modern nation state was emerging. Jean Bodin, partly in reaction to the chaos of the French wars of religion, presented theories of sovereignty calling for strong central authority in the form of absolute monarchy. In his 1576 treatise Les Six Livres de la République (“Six Books of the Republic”) Bodin argued that it is inherent in the nature of the state that sovereignty must be:[1] • Absolute: On this point he said that the sovereign must be hedged in with obligations and conditions, must be able to legislate without his (or its) subjects’ consent, must not be bound by the laws of his predecessors, and could not, because it is illogical, be bound by his own laws. • Perpetual: Not temporarily delegated as to a strong leader in an emergency or to a state employee such as a magistrate. He held that sovereignty must be perpetual because anyone with the power to enforce a time limit on the governing power must be above the governing power, which would be impossible if the governing power is absolute. Bodin rejected the notion of transference of sovereignty from people to the ruler (also known as the sovereign); natural law and divine law confer upon the sovereign the right to rule. And the sovereign is not above divine law or natural law. He is above (ie. not bound by) only positive law, that is, laws made by humans. The fact that the sovereign must obey divine and natural law imposes ethical constraints on him. Bodin also held that the lois royales, the fundamental laws of the French monarchy which regulated matters such as succession, are natural laws and are binding on the French sovereign. How divine and natural law could in practice be enforced on the sovereign is a problematic feature of Bodin’s philosophy: any person capable of enforcing them on him would be above him.\n\nAge of Enlightenment During the Age of Enlightenment, the idea of sovereignty gained both legal and moral force as the main Western description of the meaning and power of a State. In particular, the “Social Contract” as a mechanism for establishing sovereignty was suggested and, by 1800, widely accepted, especially in the new United States and France, though also in Great Britain to a lesser extent. Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan (1651) borrowed Bodin’s deﬁnition of sovereignty, which had just achieved legal status in the \"Peace of Westphalia\", and explained its origin. He created the ﬁrst modern version of the social contract (or contractarian) theory, arguing that to overcome the “nasty, brutish and short” quality of life without the cooperation of other human beings, people must join in a “commonwealth” and submit to a “Soveraigne [sic] Power” that is able to compel them to act in the common good. This expediency argument attracted many of the early proponents of sovereignty. Hobbes strengthened the deﬁnition of sovereignty beyond either Westphalian or Bodin’s, by saying that it must be: • Absolute: because conditions could only be imposed on a sovereign if there were some outside arbitrator to determine when he had violated them, in which case the sovereign would not be the ﬁnal authority. • Indivisible: The sovereign is the only ﬁnal authority in his territory; he does not share ﬁnal authority with any other entity. Hobbes held this to be true because otherwise there would be no way of resolving a disagreement between the multiple authorities. Hobbes’ hypothesis—that the ruler’s sovereignty is contracted to him by the people in return for his maintaining their physical safety—led him to conclude that if and when the ruler fails, the people recover their ability to protect themselves by forming a new contract. Hobbes’s theories decisively shape the concept of sovereignty through the medium of social contract theories. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's (1712–1778) deﬁnition of popular sovereignty (with early antecedents in Francisco Suárez's theory of the origin of power), provides that the\n\n1.2. SOVEREIGNTY people are the legitimate sovereign. Rousseau considered sovereignty to be inalienable; he condemned the distinction between the origin and the exercise of sovereignty, a distinction upon which constitutional monarchy or representative democracy is founded. John Locke, and Montesquieu are also key ﬁgures in the unfolding of the concept of sovereignty; their views diﬀer with Rousseau and with Hobbes on this issue of alienability. The second book of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Du Contrat Social, ou Principes du droit politique (1762) deals with sovereignty and its rights. Sovereignty, or the general will, is inalienable, for the will cannot be transmitted; it is indivisible, since it is essentially general; it is infallible and always right, determined and limited in its power by the common interest; it acts through laws. Law is the decision of the general will in regard to some object of common interest, but though the general will is always right and desires only good, its judgment is not always enlightened, and consequently does not always see wherein the common good lies; hence the necessity of the legislator. But the legislator has, of himself, no authority; he is only a guide who drafts and proposes laws, but the people alone (that is, the sovereign or general will) has authority to make and impose them. Rousseau, in his 1763 treatise Of the Social Contract [11] argued, “the growth of the State giving the trustees of public authority more and means to abuse their power, the more the Government has to have force to contain the people, the more force the Sovereign should have in turn in order to contain the Government,” with the understanding that the Sovereign is “a collective being of wonder” (Book II, Chapter I) resulting from “the general will” of the people, and that “what any man, whoever he may be, orders on his own, is not a law” (Book II, Chapter VI) – and furthermore predicated on the assumption that the people have an unbiased means by which to ascertain the general will. Thus the legal maxim, “there is no law without a sovereign.”[12]\n\n13 by the laws of its predecessors, or by custom, and no areas of law or policy are reserved as being outside its control. International law; policies and actions of neighboring states; cooperation and respect of the populace; means of enforcement; and resources to enact policy are factors that might limit sovereignty. For example, parents are not guaranteed the right to decide some matters in the upbringing of their children independent of societal regulation, and municipalities do not have unlimited jurisdiction in local matters, thus neither parents nor municipalities have absolute sovereignty. Theorists have diverged over the desirability of increased absoluteness. Exclusivity A key element of sovereignty in a legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction. Speciﬁcally, the degree to which decisions made by a sovereign entity might be contradicted by another authority. Along these lines, the German sociologist Max Weber proposed that sovereignty is a community’s monopoly on the legitimate use of force; and thus any group claiming the same right must either be brought under the yoke of the sovereign, proven illegitimate, or otherwise contested and defeated for sovereignty to be genuine.[14] International law, competing branches of government, and authorities reserved for subordinate entities (such as federated states or republics) represent legal infringements on exclusivity. Social institutions such as religious bodies, corporations, and competing political parties might represent de facto infringements on exclusivity. De jure and de facto\n\nDe jure, or legal, sovereignty concerns the expressed and institutionally recognised right to exercise control over a territory. De facto, or actual, sovereignty is concerned with whether control in fact exists. Cooperation and respect of the populace; control of resources in, or moved 1.2.3 Deﬁnition and types into, an area; means of enforcement and security; and ability to carry out various functions of state all repreThere exists perhaps no conception the meaning of which sent measures of de facto sovereignty. When control is is more controversial than that of sovereignty. It is an practiced predominately by military or police force it is indisputable fact that this conception, from the moment considered coercive sovereignty. when it was introduced into political science until the present day, has never had a meaning which was univerSovereignty and independence State sovereignty is sally agreed upon. sometimes viewed synonymously with independence, Lassa Oppenheim (30-03-1858 – 07-10-1919), an however, sovereignty can be transferred as a legal right [13] authority on international law whereas independence cannot.[15] A state can achieve de facto independence long after acquiring sovereignty, such as in the case of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.[15] Additionally, independence can also be suspended when an Absoluteness entire region becomes subject to an occupation such as An important factor of sovereignty is its degree when Iraq had been overrun by the forces to take part of absoluteness.[3][4] A sovereign power has absolute in the Iraq War of 2003, Iraq had not been annexed by sovereignty when it is not restricted by a constitution, any country, so its sovereignty during this period was\n\n14 not contested by any state including those present on the territory. Alternatively, independence can be lost completely when sovereignty itself becomes the subject of dispute. The pre-World War II administrations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia maintained an exile existence (and considerable international recognition) whilst the entities were annexed by the Soviet Union and governed locally by their pro-Soviet functionaries. When in 1991 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia re-enacted independence, it was done so on the basis of continuity directly from the preSoviet republics.[15][16] Another complicated sovereignty scenario can arise when regime itself is the subject of dispute. In the case of Poland, the People’s Republic of Poland which governed Poland from 1945 to 1989 is now seen to have been an illegal entity by the modern Polish administration. The post-1989 Polish state claims direct continuity from the Second Polish Republic which ended in 1939. For other reasons however, Poland maintains its communist-era outline as opposed to its preWorld War II shape which included areas now in Belarus, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia and Ukraine but did not include some of its western regions that were then in Germany. At the opposite end of the scale, there is no dispute regarding the independence of Republic of Abkhazia, Republic of South Ossetia or the Republic of Kosovo (see List of states with limited recognition) since the factually governing bodies are neither part of a bigger state, nor are they subjected to supervision. The sovereignty (i.e. legal right to govern) however, is disputed in all three cases as the ﬁrst two entities are claimed by Georgia and the third by Serbia. Internal\n\nCHAPTER 1. AN INTRODUCTION cause war in one of two ways: ﬁrst, undermining the value of agreement by allowing costly violations; and second, requiring such large subsidies for implementation that they render war cheaper than peace.[19] Leadership needs to be able to promise members, especially those like armies, police forces, or paramilitaries will abide by agreements. The presence of strong internal sovereignty allows a state to deter opposition groups in exchange for bargaining. It has been said that a more decentralized authority would be more eﬃcient in keeping peace because the deal must please not only the leadership but also the opposition group. While the operations and aﬀairs within a state are relative to the level of sovereignty within that state, there is still an argument between who should hold the authority in a sovereign state. This argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty. This discussion is between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty. An internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, ﬁnal and independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens, groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believe sovereignty should be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch. They believed the overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single voice that could claim ﬁnal authority. An example of an internal sovereign or monarch is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century; Louis XIV claimed that he was the state. Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchical rule in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public sovereignty. Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will. This means that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a central goal of the good of the people in mind. The idea of public sovereignty has often been the basis for modern democratic theory.[20]\n\nInternal sovereignty is the relationship between a sovereign power and its own subjects. A central concern is legitimacy: by what right does a government exercise authority? Claims of legitimacy might refer to the divine right of kings or to a social contract (i.e. popular sovereignty). Modern internal sovereignty Within the modern govWith Sovereignty meaning holding supreme, indepen- ernmental system, internal sovereignty is usually found dent authority over a region or state, Internal Sovereignty in states that have public sovereignty and rarely found refers to the internal aﬀairs of the state and the location within a state controlled by an internal sovereign.
