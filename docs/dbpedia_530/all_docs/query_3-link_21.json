Postage PAIDWest, TX76691Permit No. 39VOLUME 57 NUMBER 2 Website: http://www.1cda.orgMARCH/APRIL, 2008The President’s CornerWilliam (Bill) J. Richardson, Jr.The <strong>Association</strong> Board of Governors, Trustees of the Foundationand the Museum Foundation all met at Fort Hood on February23, 2008. I am happy to report that the <strong>Association</strong> is healthy inall respects. During the Board of Governors meeting the current<strong>Division</strong> Commander, BG Vincent Brooks, presented an in depthbriefing of the division’s mission and activities while in Iraq. Heexplained the problems the division encountered and actions theytook to overcome them. He was very candid about the problemsthat remain to be overcome. CSM Philip Johndrow addressed the state of theTroopers. Every time I have had the opportunity to hear the Sergeant Major speakhe reinforces the deep respect I have for him. He spoke of the great comradeshipand high morale that is found in all of the division troopers. Their desire to successfullycomplete their mission. The great heroics and total disregard for theirown lives when it came to protecting or saving their fellow troopers. He describedin detail two troopers who gave their lives to save the lives of other troopers.Anyone of us who has seen the elephant up close and personal cannot help havinga deep feeling of pride in our returning troopers. The division will rededicatethe <strong>Division</strong> Memorial on 16 May for the 469 Troopers that died during the latestdeployment for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The names are now being placed on thememorial panels. The force structure in the army is changing so rapidly that it ishard keep up with the changes. Changes in the division units are too numerous tocover here. I recommend you go to our website and look at the link .Randy George, an association member now working with NASA, presented a1st CAV patch that was carried on a shuttle flight to BG Brooks.We need a few good men to serve on the Board of Governors or one of ourFoundations. Please give this some serious thought, then communicate with meor the Executive Director, Dennis Webster.A big thanks to Tom Hartin who has served the <strong>Association</strong> and Foundation for25 years and is stepping down after the reunion meeting of the Foundation. Duringour meeting he announced that he and his wife are donating $25,000.00 to theFoundation of the 1st <strong>Cavalry</strong> <strong>Division</strong> <strong>Association</strong>.During our stay, we were in the new Shilo Hotel it will be our main hotel forthe 2009 Reunion. I guarantee that you will like it. It is right next to the ConventionCenter very similar to Riverside, California. Claire and I were fortunate tosee recently returned 1st CAV groups on Friday night in 5 or 6 of the hotel partyrooms. I never had the experience of coming back home from combat with myunit therefore I envied them as I watched their genuine comradeship and happinessto be together with their friends and loved ones. Every one of them that I had theopportunity to speak with was very proud of the part they played in accomplishingtheir mission in Iraq. It was a great feeling watching them.We spent time at the stables talking to members of the Horse <strong>Cavalry</strong> Detachment.Once again their pride in the division is unmistakable. They are in constant motiontaking care of 36 horses, 6 mules and one dog. It was very interesting to hear andsee how they operate. A great deal of training and hard work goes in to makingthe detachment one of the Army’s great showpieces. One of the troopers we spoketo was SGT Kurt Bailey who sat with Claire and I at the banquet in Riverside. Anoutstanding young NCO who I am sad to hear is going to be medically dischargedor retired. We all wish him the best in his civilian endeavors.Congratulations to COL Larry Phelps on his assignment as commander of the15th Sustainment Brigade. COL Phelps did a superb job as the Rear DetachmentCommander and this is a well-deserved assignment. Unfortunately the 15th SustainmentBrigade is no longer a part of our great division.Once again I want to express how great it is to have our young troopers backhome.It’s a great team! It’s our team! It’s the FIRST TEAM!William J.

After months of patience and dozens of WelcomeHome ceremonies, here at Fort Hood, the men and women of the Horse <strong>Cavalry</strong>Detachment began doing road trips again during the last two months. We werevery proud to faithfully execute our Welcome Home mission, but there are somethings you can only experience through a road trip. Being out on the highwaywith the horses, for example!It seems everywhere we go the public is curious about us and our mission. Iguess it’s not everyday that you meet Active Duty Soldiers wearing blue jeans.Even a simple fuel stop in Fort Stockton, Texas, gives us a great opportunity totalk to people about our unit and its mission. Boy did we ever get plenty of thosechances on the trip to Fort Bliss, Texas last week. But it wasn’t just a publicrelations event. The trip was an opportunity to observe the <strong>First</strong> Team’s finest inaction. I witnessed a cooperative spirit during the trip that is familiar to me fromother <strong>First</strong> Team assignments. I witnessed a positive mental attitude which allowedour troopers to deploy, execute and redeploy in a very short timeline. Andthe best part was that no problem big or small could subdue our efforts. We justassessed, adjusted and moved out. Really I can’t say enough about how tenaciousthe HCD’s troopers can be when they are given a mission.The most amazing thing of all, however, is the businesslike manner of theHCD’s troopers. In fact, they are so astonishingly humble that sometimes it’shard to recount the awesome number of successful missions they conduct in a veryshort period of time. For example, in my 14 months (to the day) in command,the troopers of the HCD have conducted exactly 230 missions. These missionsrange from the Fort Bliss and Buckhannon, West Virginia overnighters to shortventures into Killeen or Lampasas for parades. They encompass (among otherthings) 87 Welcome Home ceremonies, 52 Yesterday & Today presentations, 14mounted cavalry demonstrations, 14 civic parades and 9 cavalry charges. In myshort tour at the barn I have seen these troopers in action all over the country – butespecially in Texas – and no matter where we are, they always conduct themselvesin a Soldierly manner.You should take the opportunity now to see what I mean – if you haven’t already.Please visit to read a scheduleof our upcoming events.
