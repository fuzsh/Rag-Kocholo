        "text": "The Sally Award\n\nThe Paul J. Sally, Jr. Distinguished Alumnus prize is awarded annually to a graduating senior (or seniors) who has shown true, academic distinction in a demanding program in Mathematics.\n\nThe award is endowed by Professor Sally himself, who graduated from Boston College in 1954, and received his Masters' degree from Boston College in 1956. After a short teaching career in area high schools and at Boston College, Professor Sally completed his Ph.D. at Brandeis in 1965 and joined the faculty in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Chicago and continued there until his death in 2013.\n\nProfessor Sally's research was in the areas of harmonic analysis and representation theory, which concern the understanding of complicated mathematical problems whose behaviors exhibit natural symmetries. They are central areas of modern mathematics.\n\nProfessor Sally served on the Board of Trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and participated in the Association of Members of the Institute for Advanced Study. He served on and/or chaired a number of committees for the National Science Foundation and the American Mathematical Society.\n\nThe Bennett Award\n\nThe Department annually presents the Albert A. Bennett award to a graduating mathematics major who has demonstrated a high level of achievement in mathematics and who aspires to teach mathematics.\n\nThis award was initiated by former Department Chair, Father Stanley J. Bezuszka, S.J. in honor of his colleague and mentor, Albert A. Bennett, who earned undergraduate and graduate degrees at Brown University and a Ph.D in Mathematics at Princeton University. He enjoyed a lengthy distinguished career teaching mathematics at Brown University. After his retirement from Brown he taught at several institutions including Boston College, where for nine years he was engaged in teaching in a masters in mathematics program for secondary teachers.\n\nDr. Bennett published many texts and articles in algebra and logic, his fields of specialization. He also had a keen interest in applied mathematics and, during World Wars I and II, he served in the Army as a ballistics expert. It was his dedication to helping teachers deepen their mathematics content knowledge at Boston College that inspired the award that bears his name."
