        "text": "English annual theatre awards\n\nOlivier AwardsCurrent: 2024 Laurence Olivier AwardsAwarded forBest in London theatreCountryUnited KingdomPresented bySociety of London TheatreFirst awarded1976; 48 years ago ( )WebsiteOfficial website\n\nThe Laurence Olivier Awards, or simply The Olivier Awards, are presented annually by the Society of London Theatre to recognise excellence in professional theatre in London. The awards were originally known as the Society of West End Theatre Awards, but they were renamed in honour of the British actor of the same name in 1984.\n\nThe awards are given annually to individuals involved in West End productions and other leading non-commercial theatres based in London across a range of categories covering plays, musicals, dance, opera and affiliate theatre. A discretionary non-competitive Special Olivier Award is also given each year. The Olivier Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British theatre, equivalent to the BAFTA Awards for film and television, and the BRIT Awards for music. The Olivier Awards are considered equivalent to Broadway's Tony Awards and France's Molière Award.\n\nSince inception, the awards have been held at various venues and theatres across London, from 2012 to 2016 at the Royal Opera House, before moving to the Royal Albert Hall in 2017. Television coverage is broadcast in prime time on ITV1, who acquired the rights from 2013 onwards, with radio coverage by Magic Radio.\n\nMost recent Olivier Award winners\n\n← 2023 2024 Laurence Olivier Awards 2025 →\n\nAward Best Actor Best Actress Winner Mark Gatiss\n\n(The Motive and the Cue) Sarah Snook\n\n(The Picture of Dorian Gray) Award Best Actor in a Musical Best Actress in the Musical Winner Tom Francis\n\n(Sunset Boulevard) Nicole Scherzinger\n\n(Sunset Boulevard) Award Best Director Winner Jamie Lloyd\n\n(Sunset Boulevard)\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe awards were established in 1976 by the Society of London Theatre as the Society of West End Theatre Awards and were designed by artist Tom Merrifield. The first ceremony was in December 1976 at the Café Royal. In 1984, British actor Laurence Olivier gave his consent for the awards to be renamed in his honour and they became known as the Laurence Olivier Awards.[1]\n\nJudging\n\n[edit]\n\nEvery year, judging panels for theatre, opera, dance and affiliate shows are put together by the Society of London Theatre.[2]\n\nFor opera, dance and affiliates, each panel is made up of a mix of professional panellists (journalists, casting directors, arts administrators, publishers and other industry professionals chosen for their knowledge in the field) and members of the public who are passionate about London theatre. The panels first select the shows they consider most worthy of an Olivier Award nomination, then vote on a winner at the end of the judging period.[2]\n\nFor the theatre awards, a longlist is compiled by a panel made up of members of the public, and submitted to SOLT members to vote on. Members may still vote outside of the list at this stage, except for in the four Supporting Actor/Actress categories (as these each contain thousands of eligible performers). The members’ votes are collated with those of the panellists to create the list of nominees. The nominees list is then voted on by both members and panellists to produce the winners.[2]\n\nCeremony\n\n[edit]\n\nHosts\n\n[edit]\n\nPast hosts of the Olivier Awards ceremony include Michael Ball, Imelda Staunton, Clive Anderson, Gemma Arterton, Stephen Mangan, Hugh Bonneville, Sheridan Smith, Lenny Henry, Catherine Tate, Jason Manford and Hannah Waddingham.\n\nVenues\n\n[edit]\n\nThe venue most associated with the Awards is Grosvenor House Hotel, which has housed the after-show reception nine times and hosted the whole event on four further occasions. As well as at the Grosvenor, the presentations have been held at the Albery Theatre (now Noël Coward), Café Royal, Dominion Theatre, London Palladium, Lyceum Theatre, Park Lane Hilton, Piccadilly Theatre, Royal National Theatre Olivier, Royalty Theatre (now Peacock), Shaftesbury Theatre, Theatre Royal Drury Lane and Victoria Palace Theatre.[3]\n\nThe awards ceremony was held at the Royal Opera House from 2012 to 2016, moving to the Royal Albert Hall in 2017.[4][5]\n\nBroadcast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Laurence Olivier Awards to be broadcast on television was the 1981 ceremony, which was broadcast on BBC1. This continued until 1992, before a switch to BBC2 until 2003.[6] The awards ceremony was then only broadcast on radio until 2011, when the BBC broadcast live interactive red-button coverage of the event,[7] while Paul Gambaccini presented a programme on BBC Radio 2 with live coverage and interviews.[3] The same coverage followed in 2012 before ITV secured the broadcast rights, which saw the return of the Olivier Awards to mainstream television in 2013.[8] This has continued in recent years, and the ceremony has also been broadcast on Magic Radio.\n\nAward categories\n\n[edit]\n\nAward milestones\n\n[edit]\n\nSome notable records and facts about the Laurence Olivier Awards include the following:[9]\n\nProductions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most Olivier Awards ever received in the history of the ceremony were given to the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in 2017, when it won nine awards including Best New Play.\n\nThe record for the most Olivier Awards ever received by a musical is tied between Sunset Boulevard (2024), Cabaret (2022), Hamilton (2018) and Matilda (2012) each of which received seven awards including Best Musical (for Matilda and Hamilton) or Best Musical Revival (for Cabaret and Sunset Boulevard)\n\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (2013) received seven Olivier Awards.
