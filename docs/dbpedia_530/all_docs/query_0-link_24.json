        "text": "MACE, JAMES E.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to James E. Mace (0-98342), Captain (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 2d Battalion (Airmobile), 5th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division. Captain Mace distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions from 2 to 4 December 1968 while commanding his company on a search and clear mission near Dong Xoai. When his point element came under heavy fire, Captain Mace moved forward and directed his men in a flanking movement which forced the enemy to retreat from their bunkers. He then led his unit through the hostile emplacements to link with a sister company in a night defensive position. Braving intense enemy fire, he organized a rescue party and led it from the night location to rescue the crew of an ammunition re-supply helicopter shot down by the communists. On the next day, he led his unit in an attack against another bunker complex. After exposing himself to the vicious enemy fire to carry a wounded man to safety, Captain Mace stood up to spot the enemy gunners, personally killing two and wounding three of them. Finding that the foe was attempting to encircle his company, he ordered a withdrawal and remained behind to direct rocket artillery to within one hundred meters of his position. While returning to the same site from another direction the following day, the unit was hit by command detonated mines and heavy machine gun fire which caused several casualties. Captain Mace led his men on an assault of the enemy fortifications, killing one communist and rescuing two wounded comrades from under the hostile fusillade. As a result of this action, a major enemy supply complex was destroyed. Captain Mace's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 838 (March 9, 1969)\n\n*MADDOX, JULIUS\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Julius Maddox (54968086), Private First Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division. Private First Class Maddox distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 6 February 1968 as medical aidman of an infantry company on a search and destroy operation near Hoi An. While crossing an open, dry rice paddy, his unit was hit by devastating fire from enemy soldiers entrenched in camouflaged positions within two meters of the friendly forces. The ravaging small arms and machine gun barrage killed or wounded many of the men in his platoon during the initial moments of the ambush, and the remainder of the friendly force withdrew to the concealment offered by a nearby cane field. With complete disregard for his welfare, Private Maddox sprinted across the bare terrain under a hail of fire to reach a wounded comrade and carry him to safety. Seeing a fellow medic hit, he returned through withering enemy machine gun fire to move the man to a helicopter evacuation landing zone. When the rescue ships arrived, he placed his patients aboard, secured a litter from one of the crews, and returned to aid soldiers still trapped in the deadly killing zone. He was shot in both legs by North Vietnamese fire, but ignored his wounds to carry another casualty to the waiting aircraft. He was urged to board the helicopter for evacuation, but he refused any aid for himself and returned to rescue more wounded. Only when he was certain that all his injured comrades were safe did he allow treatment and evacuation for himself. His courageous and selfless actions in the heat of battle were directly responsible for saving the lives of several fellow soldiers. Private First Class Maddox's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 2555 (May 29, 1968)\n\nHome Town: Detroit, Michigan\n\nMAGOUYRK, JAMES R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to James R. Magouyrk, First Lieutenant (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 3d Battalion, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile). First Lieutenant Magouyrk distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 12 February 1969 while serving as a rifle platoon leader during operations near Phan Thiet in Binh Thuan Province. When combined elements of the South Vietnamese Army and Regional/Popular Forces encountered heavy enemy contact during the defense of the city, Lieutenant Magouyrk and his unit were flown in to reinforce the allied elements. As the helicopters touched down, enemy B-40 rocket and small arms fire burst from bunkers surrounding the landing zone. Immediately Lieutenant Magouyrk disembarked and set up defensive positions. He continually exposed himself to the fusillade to pull casualties to a safe area for medical evacuation and to redistribute ammunition among his men. Observing an enemy in a nearby bunker preparing to launch a rocket, he charged the fortification, destroying it with hand grenades and capturing the rocket launcher. While supervising a sweep of an area vacated by the enemy, he was wounded by hostile fire. Not until he had organized his men into a defensive night position did he allow himself to be evacuated for medical treatment. First Lieutenant Magouryk's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 3079 (August 12, 1969)\n\nMALACHI, RONALD E.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Ronald E. Malachi (US56694642), Staff Sergeant, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 2d Battalion, 1st Infantry, 196th Infantry Brigade (Light), Americal Division. Staff Sergeant Malachi distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 5 and 6 January 1968 as squad leader of an infantry company on a search and destroy operation. His unit was ambushed on the morning of 5 January by a Viet Cong force firing machine guns and automatic weapons from well-fortified positions, and he joined a fire team which advanced toward one of the hostile bunkers. As his platoon leader, a member of the team, began to charge the bunker alone, Sergeant Malachi stood up to draw a hail of enemy fire away from the officer and toward himself. Braving the devastating fusillade, he joined the assault on the position and destroyed it, forcing the remaining insurgents to flee. Later in the day, his company was again attacked. Sergeant Malachi quickly deployed his men in a tight defensive perimeter and then moved through intense enemy fire to search for casualties and dispersed elements of the company. With the unit consolidated, he repeatedly exposed himself to the hostile weapons and moved along his lines to repel probes by the determined attackers. He detected a particularly effective North Vietnamese mortar position supported by two machine guns and, disregarding his personal safety, he furiously assaulted them until his ammunition was expended. Heedless of bullets striking all around him, he returned to his perimeter, secured a machine gun and continued his attack on the hostile weapons. Standing erect, he delivered deadly fire on the enemy positions at close range and destroyed all three emplacements. Early in the morning of 6 January, the insurgents directed a fierce rocket and mortar attack on the company command group. Sergeant Malachi immediately organized a security force to cover the command group's withdrawal. He then took up an exposed position and repulsed strong enemy probes until reinforcements arrived. Staff Sergeant Malachi's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 1854 (April 22, 1968)\n\n*MALAVE-RIOS, ABELARDO\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Abelardo Malave-Rios (RA50101308), First Sergeant, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 3d Battalion, 12th Infantry, 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. First Sergeant Malave-Rios distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 27 February 1968 while defending against a massive attack on his unit's perimeter by a North Vietnamese Army force. His unit was guarding the battalion fire base when it was subjected to a savage ground attack. Exposing himself to the deadly automatic weapons fire, Sergeant Malave-Rios moved along the defensive perimeter shouting commands, pointing out targets and giving words of encouragement to his men. When an exploding grenade wounded a machine gunner, he immediately moved to the weapon and poured a concentrated volume of fire into the charging enemy troops. Several well-aimed bursts of fire killed five North Vietnamese as they assaulted his position. When this enemy foray had been repelled, he moved to aid several soldiers who had been wounded. Despite constant enemy fire, he treated their wounds and made several trips to a nearby bunker, carrying a wounded man to safety each time. He continued to expose himself to the fusillade until all the wounded had been taken to the landing zone for medical evacuation. Sergeant Malave-Rios then assumed the responsibility of guiding the arriving helicopters and prepared to load the wounded. As the first helicopter landed, the landing zone came under intense enemy fire, mortally wounding Sergeant Malave-Rios as he selflessly placed the welfare of his men above his own safety. First Sergeant Malave-Rios' extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 2886 (June 17, 1968)\n\nHome Town: New York, New York\n\nMALONEY, GEORGE A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to George A. Maloney, Major (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action. Major George A. Maloney, Infantry, distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving an opposing armed force in the Republic of Vietnam, from 26 April to 30 April 1964. With full knowledge that a helicopter evacuation was not possible for at least three days, Colonel Maloney unhesitatingly joined a Vietnamese Strike Force Patrol that had been harassed by the Viet Cong for over two weeks as it penetrated deep into insurgent controlled territory. While the discouraged, sick, and wounded defenders were anticipating the aerial evacuation, Colonel Maloney encouraged them to continue to defend themselves. He reorganized the patrol and, while exposed to sporadic gun fire, led the troops into positions to construct a landing zone and establish a perimeter of defense for the arriving aircraft. As the first helicopter landed, it became the target of heavy gun fire from multiple automatic weapons and was badly damaged. Although the armed helicopters repeatedly suppressed the gun fires on known enemy positions and the evacuation operation was resumed several times, the perimeter of defense became smaller and smaller throughout the air lifts. Despite the decrease in the defense patrol and the increase in the intensity of enemy gun fire at closer range, Colonel Maloney demonstrated complete disregard for his own safety and directed return fire into enemy positions. With fortitude, determination, and indomitable courage, he continued to expose himself to the heavy enemy gun fire to cover the loading zone until the last evacuation helicopter had landed. Colonel Maloney's extraordinary heroic actions and conspicuous gallantry are in the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the military service.\n\nDepartment of the Army, General Orders No. 19 (May 28, 1965)\n\nMALONEY, ROBERT W.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Robert W. Maloney (US50203024), Specialist Fourth Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 2d Battalion, 3d Infantry, 199th Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Light). Specialist Four Maloney distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous action on 16 May 1968 as a ninety millimeter recoilless rifle gunner during operations southwest of Saigon. As his platoon moved to the aid of a company which was heavily engaged with a large enemy force, it was hit on three sides by intense hostile force coming from well fortified enemy positions in the tree lines. Advancing with his unit through knee-deep mud to within fifty meters of the attacker's emplacements, Specialist Maloney saw two comrades who had been overcome by heat exhaustion. He unhesitatingly crossed open marsh to rescue the two men and carried them one at a time two hundred and fifty meters through hostile fire to safety. Returning to his weapon he continued to engage the enemy and destroyed a key bunker. One squad of his platoon then came under a barrage of enemy mortars and automatic weapons fire from three separate positions. Moving forward seventy-five meters, Specialist Maloney took the emplacements under fire and destroyed all three with devastating accuracy. He next went to aid a squad member who lay injured within twenty-five meters of the enemy fortifications. While bringing the man back to friendly lines he was seriously wounded by an exploding hostile grenade. Specialist Four Maloney's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 4521 (September 28, 1968)\n\n*MANGAN, MICHAEL ROBERT\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Michael Robert Mangan (US56703895), Specialist Fourth Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 1st Battalion (Mechanized), 5th Infantry, 2d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division. Specialist Four Mangan distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 21 August 1968 while serving with a mechanized infantry company combating a large enemy force in the Ben Cui rubber plantation. The communists began a human wave assault. Specialist Mangan maneuvered his armored personnel carrier into a position from which it could deliver the most effective firepower and began firing his light anti-tank weapon into the charging enemy. Constantly exposed to the intense hostile fusillade, he continued firing until ordered to withdraw. As he maneuvered his assault vehicle into a defensive position, it was struck by an enemy rocket which caused it to burst into flames. Specialist Mangan again exposed himself to the communist's barrage to extinguish the fire and was wounded in the arm. The vehicle was then struck by a mortar round. Finding the carrier inoperative, he ran to another assault vehicle to assist its machinegunner in delivering suppressive fire on the enemy. When the gunner had expended his ammunition, Specialist Mangan ran through a hail of bullets to obtain a resupply from his demobilized track. As he climbed into the vehicle it was struck by a rocket, knocking him to the ground. Struggling to his feet, he picked up the vital ammunition and returned it to the machine gunner's position. While handing the resupply to his comrade, he was mortally wounded. Specialist Four Mangan's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty, at the cost of his life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 5006 (October 29, 1968)\n\nHome Town: Costa Mesa, California\n\nMANGLONA, MARTIN A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Martin A. Manglona (RA50010158), Staff Sergeant, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Staff Sergeant Manglona distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions in the early hours of 23 February 1969 as a platoon sergeant during a reconnaissance-in-force mission in Tinh Bien Province. Staff Sergeant Manglona's company's night defensive position was attacked by a North Vietnamese Army company using mortars, rockets and hand grenades and, in the first minutes of the fighting, Sergeant Manglona, his platoon leader and the radio operator were wounded by an incoming mortar. Despite his painful injury, he evacuated his stricken comrades and quickly deployed his men to effectively engage the enemy. Braving the hostile fusillade, he resupplied his troops with ammunition, directed their fire, hurled grenades and helped evacuate other casualties. While helping to defend the most vulnerable section of the perimeter, he was blinded by fragments from an enemy rocket. Sergeant Manglona ordered his men to place him so that his weapon was aimed at the communists, and refused to be evacuated until the attack was repelled. Staff Sergeant Manglona's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 1730 (May 14, 1969)\n\nMANLEY, GLEN R.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Glen R. Manley (RA18662198), Specialist Fourth Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 2d Battalion, 18th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division. Specialist Four Manley distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 1 November 1955 while serving as team leader within his platoon during a search and destroy mission near Di An. Moving ahead of his unit, Specialist Manley discovered a booby trap and disarmed it before his mean reached that position. During a subsequent search, a grenade was thrown among the men. Specialist Manley shouted a warning, picked up the grenade, and hurled it back towards the Viet Cong. In the following outburst of fire from the insurgents, he noticed that the most effective fire was coming from a group of bunkers and crawled on his stomach to within five meters of one of them. Again a grenade fell near him. Undaunted, he threw that grenade back into the bunker and two of his own after it. The insurgents retreated. Noticing the friendly unit removing its casualties from the field, the Viet Cong attacked again. Specialist Manley, however, had entered their bunker and prevented them from effectively striking his comrades. While his unit moved from its dangerous position to a helicopter landing zone, it received sniper fire. Fearlessly, Specialist Manley raced towards the sniper and silenced him. At the landing zone, snipers continued to harass the platoon. Completely disregarding his own safety, Specialist Manley single-handedly maintained a guard post at the tree line, protecting his unit until all of the casualties had been evacuated. Specialist Four Manley's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 2378 (May 25, 1967)\n\nMANSFIELD, GORDON H.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Gordon H. Mansfield (0-5325599), Captain (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 1st Battalion (Airborne) 501st Infantry, 2d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. Captain Mansfield distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 4 February 1968 as commanding officer of an airborne infantry company on a search and clear operation near Hai Lang. When his company came under devastating enemy fire, he immediately maneuvered his elements into positions for an attack. Receiving word that one platoon had been pinned down by enemy automatic weapons fire, he led a second platoon into position for a frontal assault upon the enemy. When the attack stalled in the face of ravaging fire, he led five men to the enemy's flank. With complete disregard for his personal safety, he led a savage charge upon the enemy position that completely destroyed it. Captain Mansfield repeatedly exposed himself to enemy weapons fire to evacuate his wounded men. While moving the casualties to safety, he was seriously wounded. Refusing aid, he continued to direct the evacuation of the wounded and coordinated with an adjoining company for aid. Only when he was certain that his men were safe did he agree to his own evacuation. Captain Mansfield's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 2945 (June 20, 1968)\n\nMARI, LOUIS A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Louis A. Mari (0-98818), First Lieutenant (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces. First Lieutenant Mari distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions during the period 9 - 12 March 1966 while serving as Executive Officer, Officer at Camp A Shau, Republic of Vietnam. On 9 March 1966, the camp was attacked by a large Viet Cong force. Without regard for his own personal safety, Lieutenant Mari braved the insurgent fire ran 200 Meters to his position where he helped to organize the confused and stunned defenders and hold off the insurgent attack. Later in the day he was to accompany a detail to secure and cover an airstrip for the landing of two aircraft to evacuate a seriously wounded American. Upon returning to the camp, he was faced with the insurgent main attack upon the camp. Lieutenant Mari immediately formed a perimeter and held his position until the insurgents broke into the camp from the rear, forcing Lieutenant Mari and his comrades to take a different position in the camp. Observing a large insurgent horde massing for an attack on the communications bunker, he and another American boldly fought off the attack until the weapon was destroyed and the American was killed. He then led a small force in counterattack which halted the Viet Cong assault and drove them back with heavy casualties. Repeated attacks from the large Viet Cong forces brought about the order for the friendly defenders to withdraw from the camp, at which time Lieutenant Mari destroyed the radios and classified documents and prepared the wounded men for evacuation. He then led his troops through 500 meters of intense fire and fought a delaying action until all the defenders had cleared the camp. Lieutenant Mari continued to evade the Viet Cong and direct evacuation of his men for several days until he was rescued by a helicopter. Lieutenant Mari's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Pacific, General Orders No. 204 (August 26, 1966)\n\nHome Town: Stone Mountain, Georgia\n\nMARINACCI, JACK L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Jack L. Marinacci (US56588320), Private First Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Battery B, 6th Battalion, 29th Artillery, 4th Infantry Division Artillery, 4th Infantry Division. Private First Class Marinacci distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 14 August 1968 while serving with an artillery forward observer team accompanying a two-platoon reconnaissance patrol in the Central Highlands northwest of Dak To. While preparing a night location, the unit came under heavy enemy recoilless rifle, mortar and small arms fire. Realizing that immediate artillery support was required, Private Marinacci ran through the murderous fusillade to the forward observation post to assist in calling in artillery fire. Racing toward the post he was wounded, however he continued to the position where he found the company commander and the forward observer had been killed in action and the radios damaged. Ignoring his wounds, he fearlessly exposed himself to the aggressor's fire until he located a working radio. Private Marinacci then assumed command of the surviving elements and made contact with the battalion commander. After leading his comrades out of the killing zone, he returned to the exposed hill top with a small group to evacuate the wounded. He left the area only after he conducted a complete check to insure that all wounded personnel had been evacuated. Private Marinacci then led the group to another night location where he established a tight defensive perimeter and adjusted artillery fire to provide security during the night. At daybreak he supervised the extraction of the unit by helicopter. Private First Class Marinacci's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 5679 (December 10, 1968)\n\nMARINOVICH, BRANKO B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Branko B. Marinovich (0-2319333), First Lieutenant (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company B, 3d Battalion, 8th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Marinovich distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 26 May 1967 while serving as Commanding Officer of an infantry company on a search and destroy mission forty miles from Pleiku. When another company of his battalion was attacked and surrounded by a North Vietnamese force, Lieutenant Marinovich immediately rushed his company to assist in repelling the attack. En route to the battle area, his unit was stopped by heavy automatic weapons fire, but they fought their way through the enemy positions to the friendly company. Finding the commanding officer of the company mortally wounded, Lieutenant Marinovich took command and organized both units into a defensive perimeter. Ignoring his personal safety, he exposed himself to hostile fire to direct air and artillery attacks on enemy positions. He was painfully wounded in the latter stages of battle but refused medical aid until the enemy was defeated. Still under sporadic fire, he directed the evacuation of friendly casualties and was wounded once more before being evacuated himself.

Mark (W-3154644), Warrant Officer (W-1), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with 176th Aviation Company, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. Warrant Officer Mark distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 3 October 1967 as pilot of a utility helicopter supporting ground operations near Chu Lai. An airborne infantry company conducting search and clear operations was heavily engaged by a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force firing automatic weapons from well-concealed and fortified positions. The friendly force expended much of its ammunition and requested immediate re-supply. Aware that intense enemy antiaircraft fire had destroyed five helicopters and prevented gunship support, Warrant Officer Mark volunteered to attempt the mission. Devastating machine gun and automatic weapons fire raked his ship as he reached the area, but he refused to terminate his flight. As he flew low over the friendly force, the enemy launched a withering mortar barrage to prevent his landing. Disregarding his personal safety, he hovered ten feet above the ground while his crew pushed the vital ammunition out to the waiting ground forces. Machine gun fire shattered both of his legs and forced him to crash land. Despite his severe wounds, he skillfully controlled the crippled ship and brought it to the ground. With bullets striking all around him, he shut down all electrical systems to prevent an explosion and then moved to safety. His fearless actions in the heat of battle prevented his fellow soldiers from being overrun and annihilated by the determined enemy.

Marshall, Captain (Armor), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam. Captain Marshall distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism on 20 January 1970, while serving as an aircraft commander with Air Cavalry Troop, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, in the Republic of Vietnam. On this date, while flying a reconnaissance mission near the village of Bu Dop, a light observation helicopter received intense enemy ground fire, causing the aircraft to crash and burn in an open field, killing the co-pilot. The pilot made his way to a nearby bomb crater amidst a hail of fire from an estimated battalion of North Vietnamese Army Regulars, who were entrenched in bunkers surrounding the clearing. Captain Marshall, who was in command of a squad of gunships, circled the area in an attempt to locate any survivors. Once he identified the downed pilot, he notified his commander of his intention to accomplish a rescue. Cautiously lowering the craft near the crater, Captain Marshall was savagely attacked by a barrage of small arms and automatic weapons fire from the insurgents' position. Hovering his helicopter at the proposed site of recovery, he rotated his gunship, firing his minigun into the wood line, attempting to suppress the concentrated enemy attack. As Captain Marshall brought the craft to rest near the bomb crater and enemy mortar rounds began exploding in close proximity, the gunner opened the canopy and aided the wounded pilot aboard. With his helicopter grossly overloaded, Captain Marshall skillfully circled the open area to gain sufficient speed to clear the tree tops. After transferring the injured pilot to another helicopter at Bu Dop, Captain Marshall eagerly refueled, rearmed and returned to the contact area. Captain Marshall's profound courage, conspicuous flying ability, concern for his fellow human being, and unwavering devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nDepartment of the Army, General Orders No. 5 (February 25, 1971)\n\n*MARTIN, DONNIE JOE\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Donnie Joe Martin (US55948425), Specialist Fourth Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 3d Battalion, 1st Infantry, Americal Division. Specialist Four Martin distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 15 March 1969 during a combat sweep operation near the village of Bich Chieu, in Quang Ngai Province. As his company was struggling through thick underbrush, hedgerows and bamboo, it suddenly came under heavy fire from a well-concealed bunker. Specialist Martin spotted the stronghold and led two comrades on an assault, killing four North Vietnamese soldiers in the position and capturing their weapons. His company continued its advance and made contact with another concealed enemy force. Seeing that one of his men had been seriously wounded and lay trapped under the hostile fusillade, Specialist Martin rushed into the bullet-swept area and carried the man to safety. A short time later, while his unit was again moving through open terrain, the communists sprang an ambush, firing automatic weapons and throwing grenades from three sides. After locating the enemy bunker which was the greatest threat to his element, Specialist Martin jumped a hedgerow and single-handedly assaulted it. During an intense exchange of fire between him and the North Vietnamese soldiers in the fortification, he was mortally wounded.

Sergeant Martin distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 11 November 1967 while serving as squad leader of an airborne infantry company during the battle at Dak To. His squad was serving as point element for the company as it attempted to join a battalion. As Sergeant Martin quickly led his squad to join the beleaguered company, withering machine gun fire wounded two of his men. He dashed to aid the injured troops and was hit himself, but he ignored his wound and carried one man to the relative safety of the defensive perimeter. After integrating his troops with the main force, he fought furiously to repel repeated fierce assaults by the North Vietnamese soldiers. He was wounded a second time by a mortar air burst, but he continued to refuse aid and moved among the bullet-swept positions to direct the fires of his men. When the order to counterattack came, he led his squad in an assault up the enemy-controlled hill. He was again wounded by an exploding enemy rocket, but he fearlessly continued his advance on a hostile machine gun position. In the face of ravaging enemy hand grenades and machine gun fire, he unhesitantly assaulted the gun emplacement and suppressed its fire while one of his men destroyed the position with a grenade. He was mortally wounded while gallantly leading his men in the heat of battle. His fearless and courageous actions inspired his men to defeat the North Vietnamese forces and reach their objective.

Sergeant First Class Martin distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 22 March 1968 as team leader of a small Special Forces long range reconnaissance team operating in enemy-controlled territory. On 21 March his patrol discovered a freshly-dug enemy bunker and tunnel complex. Sergeant Martin thoroughly reconnoitered the area and then moved his men to a night defensive perimeter. During the night, an unknown size Viet Cong force closed on three sides of the friendly position and, at daybreak, raked the team with heavy automatic weapons fire. Braving the withering fusillade, Sergeant Martin fearlessly led his troops through the enemy's flank without a casualty and quickly established a hasty defensive perimeter on a ridgeline to await helicopter extraction. The Viet Cong pursued the team, completely surrounded it and unleashed a savage attack, determined to annihilate the trapped soldiers. Directing his men to hold their positions, Sergeant Martin gallantly charged down the ridge and sprayed the advancing insurgent ranks with fierce rifle fire, killing many of the Viet Cong. Before his team members could come to his aid, Sergeant Martin was overpowered by the enemy force and mortally wounded. His dauntless and courageous efforts enabled the rest of the patrol to hold off the enemy until helicopters arrived and extracted them to safety.

Captain Martin was serving as Commanding Officer of Company B, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 8th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). On 21 May 1966, his unit was assigned the task of routing an unknown Viet Cong force out of a nearby valley. While moving up, Captain Martin's unit came under intense automatic weapons and sniper fire from a well-dug-in reinforced Viet Cong battalion. As a counter movement, the friendly defenders launched a frontal assault but were beaten back by the insurgents. Realizing the necessity of a break in contact with the hostile forces prior to darkness, Captain Martin withdrew his troops and called for aerial rocket artillery, mortar, and artillery fire support. He then took his headquarters element and the second platoon and moved to within 30 meters of the Viet Cong's line of defense. A machine gun opened fire on the advancing platoon and Captain Martin, with complete disregard for his own personal safety, exposed himself to the intense fire, shot the gunner, and threw a grenade into the emplacement killing the three remaining Viet Cong. Continuing another 25 meters, Captain Martin eliminated two more bunkers which allowed his unit to advance. Still moving up, he exposed himself three more times to kill snipers.

Captain Matz distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 1 February 1968 as the commander of an infantry company conducting an operation in the city of My Tho. Captain Matz's unit was on a follow-and-support mission to three other companies. The company on the right met strong resistance as it moved through a complex of buildings near the My Tho reservoir. Its left flank platoon soon became heavily engaged with a large hostile force entrenched in a cemetery. Its other two platoons were unable to advance due to the intense enemy fire. Captain Matz's company received orders to assist the beleaguered unit and assume its mission. As the company began to maneuver, it came under intense hostile fire from well-fortified enemy positions in the surrounding buildings. While directing his company in the attack, Captain Matz discovered four casualties pinned down by the withering fusillade. He immediately ran to the aid of one of the men, and was wounded in the arm as he dragged him to a safe position. Ignoring his painful injury, he made three more trips through heavy hostile fire to rescue the remaining men. After the casualties had been evacuated, he returned to the front of his unit with anti-tank weapons and directed their fire against the insurgents.

Mayer (0-506344), First Lieutenant (Artillery), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam while serving as Pilot with the 114th Assault Helicopter Company, 12th Aviation Group, 1st Aviation Brigade. First Lieutenant Mayer distinguished himself on 10 April 1966, while serving as a member of an armed helicopter platoon in support of a beleaguered Special Forces outpost near Moc Hoa. After obtaining vital ammunition and communications equipment, First Lieutenant Mayer entered the operational area while exposed to intense hostile fire. Although all communications within the outpost were severed and the insurgents were known to have breached part of the outpost defenses, First Lieutenant Mayer, despite receiving several hits to his aircraft, successfully landed in the compound with the vitally needed supplies. When a call for the immediate evacuation of casualties was requested, again braving intense Viet Cong ground fire, First Lieutenant Mayer effected the extraction of the wounded. After delivering his patients to a hospital, he returned to the battle area and, with his platoon, began searching for the now retreating Viet Cong. Shortly after dawn, he received word that an American officer had stepped on a land mine and was critically injured. Immediately, First Lieutenant Mayer flew his aircraft to the location and, with complete disregard for his safety, slowly landed the aircraft in the mine field and extracted the injured officer. Later, while searching the area, First Lieutenant Mayer and his fire team located the main body of the retreating Viet Cong concealed in tall grass. For the next four hours, he and his platoon repeatedly took the insurgents under attack. When one of the armed helicopters was shot down near the hostile lines, wounding the aircraft commander, First Lieutenant Mayer immediately began to render suppressive fire on the Viet Cong as they attempted to close in on the downed crew. This effective fire also enabled a rescue aircraft to land and extract the downed crew. Through his courageous efforts, First Lieutenant Mayer contributed immeasurably to the success of the operation. His extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 6055 (October 18, 1966)\n\n*MAYNARD, THOMAS HARRY\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Thomas Harry Maynard (RA19286737), Private First Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 2d Battalion, 8th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division. Private First Class Maynard distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 6 November 1965 while serving as an ammunition bearer during a search and destroy operation in the vicinity of Plei Me, Republic of Vietnam. At approximately 1330 hours, Private Maynard's unit came under intense small arms and automatic weapons fire from well camouflaged Viet Cong positions. The insurgents had excellent observation and fields of fire which made it difficult to advance and halted the friendly assault. During the course of action, ammunition was called for by the forward elements of the platoon. With complete disregard for his personal safety while exposed to the intense hostile fire, Private Maynard and another soldier advanced to approximately twenty meters toward the lead elements of the platoon, with the critically needed ammunition and both were immediately wounded. While attempting to locate the Viet Cong positions, a grenade had landed between Private Maynard and the other soldier. Private Maynard, although wounded himself and with complete disregard for his personal safety, pushed his comrade aside and threw himself upon the grenade, smothering the blast with his body. His intentional and selfless act undoubtedly saved the life of his fellow soldier and served as an inspiration to the other members of his unit.

Captain Mayor distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions during the period from 19 October through 25 October 1968 while leading a reconnaissance-in-force operation in the enemy-infiltrated mountains near DaNang. Late in the afternoon of 19 October, Captain Mayor detected movement on a nearby ridge and quickly positioned his company in an ambush formation. When the North Vietnamese force entered the killing zone, he imitated an attack with Claymore mines and grenades. After the successful skirmish, the unit continued to seek out the enemy. During the early morning hours of 25 October, the company's night position was hit by a hostile force that penetrated the defensive line and swarmed toward the command post. Captain Mayor immediately ordered his men to fire into the center of the camp, even though the members of the command post had only scant protection. After the perimeter troops had unleashed a barrage on the invaders, the command group engaged the fleeing enemy soldiers at close range. Captain Mayor shot one hostile soldier and used his empty rifle to bludgeon another to death. The remnant North Vietnamese force fled into the jungle. Later in the day as communist mortar rounds began to pound the hill, Captain Mayor decided to break camp and capture a nearby hill held by a well-entranced enemy force. He located the site of the hostile mortar emplacement and called in artillery strikes on the North Vietnamese entrenchments. When the enemy soldiers were forced out of their bunkers by the devastating barrage, he led an assault up the hill-side. Suddenly his men were pinned down by strafing machine gun fire. Running and crawling forward through the fusillade, Captain Mayor neared the machine gun emplacement which he destroyed with a well-thrown grenade. Shortly afterward, his men successfully routed the enemy force and secured the hill.

Specialist Four McAfee distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 28 and 29 February 1968 as an armored vehicle driver during a reconnaissance-in-force mission at a village near Bien Hoa. On 28 February, a Vietnamese battalion was taken under intense automatic weapons and rocket fire by a Viet Cong force, and two platoons of Specialist McAfee's troop were dispatched to reinforce it. During their assault on the insurgent positions, Specialist McAfee's vehicle was struck by an enemy rocket, throwing two crew members from the track and seriously wounding a third. He drove his flaming vehicle through the enemy-held area and stopped at a stream where he removed his wounded comrade and concealed him in the underbrush. He then returned to the burning track to recover weapons and radio his position to his platoon leader. Unable to make contact, he went back to his injured comrade and remained with him throughout the night. On the morning of 29 February, Specialist McAfee carried the man to friendly lines. He next voluntarily led a dismounted patrol into the enemy-held village. Under his guidance, the patrol recovered a casualty from the previous day's battle and captured a North Vietnamese soldier.

Sergeant First Class McBee distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 11 February 1969 as a platoon leader on a search and clear mission in the vicinity of Chu Pa Mountain. His company was suddenly engaged by a well-entrenched, numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force equipped with small arms, automatic weapons, rockets and mortars. Although he received shrapnel wounds in the leg and shoulder during the initial volley, Sergeant McBee refused treatment and maneuvered through the enemy fire to position his men. Seeing a wounded comrade who lay exposed to the hostile barrage, he advanced twenty-five meters to reach the casualty, administered first aid, and was about to carry him to safety when he saw three North Vietnamese approaching his location. Sergeant McBee waited until all three had come within twenty meters and eliminated them with two well-placed hand grenades. After carrying the wounded man from under the enemy fire, he helped bring seven other casualties to an evacuation point and redistributed their ammunition along his unit's perimeter. Still disregarding his wounds, he moved forward to an exposed site and adjusted artillery fire until dark.

As an Advisor to a Company in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, Captain McBride demonstrated fortitude, professional skill, and determination by rendering invaluable assistance to Vietnamese elements when they were suddenly subjected to heavy machine gun fire and mortars by hostile forces. When the initial attack wounded the company commander and several other soldiers, Captain McBride displayed complete disregard for his own personal safety and bravely exposed himself to the intense gun fire while rallying the members of two platoons which had become widely dispersed during the onslaught. Upon assuming command of the leaderless company, and while still under flanking fire, he moved among the members of the company giving them assistance, directions, and encouragement. Then, with sound judgment, professional competence, and steadfast courage, he directed the company's withdrawal through successive positions, remained with the covering force that was the last to withdraw, and continued his dauntless efforts until he was mortally wounded as he stopped to assist the wounded Vietnamese commander. His intrepid conduct, unselfish actions, and devotion to duty inspired his Vietnamese comrades to pursue their efforts in the defense to their homeland and curtailed the activities of the hostile forces.

At 1620 hours, the lead element encountered an entrenched North Vietnamese Army battalion and was quickly pinned down by intense hostile fire from two sides. As the insurgents attempted to encircle the beleaguered company, Sergeant McCarthy moved through the devastating fire to encourage his demoralized men to assault the hostile positions. Noting that the enemy was starting to escape, he dauntlessly charged the emplacements alone. Unmindful of the dangers, Sergeant McCarthy ran across thirty meters of bullet-swept terrain, killed both gun crews and forced another group of insurgents to scatter.

Captain McCarthy distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 18 January 1967 while serving as company commander during a search and destroy mission in the Don Dien Filhol Plantation. Captain McCarthy led his unit into an area heavily defended by fortifications, trenches, and mine fields. The infantry was following in the tracks of tanks when two lead tanks tripped large mines and were disabled. As the men dove for cover, several were wounded by booby traps and explosions of numerous command detonated mines. When the insurgents commenced rifle fire from a bunker 15 meters to the front, Captain McCarthy realized that his exposed men were in critical danger from this point. Heedless of his own safety, he charged the hostile emplacement with mines exploding all around him. He was blown to the ground by one blast, which wounded one of his radio operators and killed the other. Captain McCarthy leaped up and dauntlessly resumed his assault, but was knocked down by another explosion. Ignoring his wounds, he again sprang to his feet, sprayed the Viet Cong bunker with rifle fire as he ran towards it, and blew it apart with hand grenades. Having destroyed the source of fire and command detonated mines, he ran back through the booby trapped field, called for medical aid men, and began to treat the casualties himself.

As Senior Advisor to a Vietnamese Airborne Battalion, Captain McCarthy demonstrated decisive leadership and fortitude during a mission into an assault zone in support of military operations conducted by the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam in defense of their homeland. While the airborne troops were moving across open territory at daybreak toward their second objective, they were suddenly attacked by hostile forces from three directions and subjected to a barrage of concentrated fire from small arms, automatic weapons, mortars, and recoilless rifles. As the casualties mounted rapidly and the friendly troops were thrown into confusion, Captain McCarthy displayed complete disregard for his own personal safety and unhesitatingly moved into the inferno of hostile gun fire to organize the troops and establish an effective base of operations. He then joined his counterpart with the lead element and continued his brave efforts to rally and encourage the troops until he was mortally wounded. Through his courageous conduct, unselfish actions, and dedicated devotion to duty, his Vietnamese comrades were inspired to pursue their defense efforts and successfully accomplished their objective. Captain McCarthy's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty, at the cost of his life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nDepartment of the Army, General Orders No. 18 (May 29, 1964)\n\nBorn: April 30, 1933 at Philippine Islands Home Town: Chevy Chase, Maryland\n\nMcCLEAN, MICHAEL A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Michael A. McClean, Specialist Fourth Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry, 9th Infantry Division. Specialist Four McClean distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 6 February 1969 while serving as a member of an ambush patrol operating in Long An Province. While established in a night defensive position, his platoon came under an intense Viet Cong attack. When rocket-propelled grenade landed in the command post killing the radio-telephone operator and seriously wounding both the platoon leader and platoon sergeant, Specialist McClean immediately rushed forward to lay suppressive fire on the enemy and direct his comrades into effective firing positions. When the squads were in place, he began maneuvering from position to position assisting the wounded. He then moved to the damaged command post and assumed command of the platoon from the wounded leaders. As the battle progressed, he became aware that one hostile emplacement seemed immune to the machine gun fire being placed on it. Obtaining an M-72 light anti-tank weapon, Specialist McClean advanced through the hail of bullets well ahead of his squad's position and eliminated the hostile fortification. Returning to the command post, he found a radio and began to call in gunships, artillery, and medical evacuation helicopters. After adjusting supporting fire on the enemy positions, he began to supervise the extraction of casualties. Learning of another communist machine gun emplacement that escaped the deadly gunship barrage, Specialist McClean again used a light antitank weapon to silence the bunker. He then continued to move among his men directing retaliatory fire until the enemy force was routed. Specialist Four McClean's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 3312 (August 29, 1969)\n\n*McCOIG, DONALD B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Donald B.

Warrant Officer McCoig distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 29 March 1968 as aircraft commander of an assault helicopter on a combat mission near Hue. After air strikes had pounded an enemy stronghold, he volunteered to fly Vietnamese ground forces into the area to conduct bomb assessment and search and destroy operations. During the second airlift into the landing zone, his ship received intense enemy automatic weapons fire which heavily damaged the craft and wounded the co-pilot and gunner. Displaying outstanding courage and airmanship, Mister McCoig continued into the battle area under heavy fire and landed his helicopter. He then led his men to cover and returned through the fusillade to recover the aircraft's weapons and equipment. Remaining calm, he skillfully treated the wounded until an evacuation ship arrived and carried them all to safety. Three more aircraft were shot down in the ensuing action, and Mister McCoig volunteered to return to the raging firefight to extract their crews. With complete disregard for his safety, he again flew into the area and landed amid a curtain of fire. Bullets tore into his craft, but he refused to take off until the members of one stranded crew had climbed aboard. As he became airborne, the enemy forces concentrated their full firepower on his ship, and he was killed by a hail of rounds tearing into the cockpit.

McCollum, First Lieutenant (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company D, 1st Battalion, 502d Infantry, 101st Airborne Division. First Lieutenant McCollum distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 31 March 1969 while leading his platoon in the hills south of the A Shau Valley. His company was engaged in a fierce firefight with a North Vietnamese force holding ridge from well-fortified positions. A ravine separating the two opposing forces obviated a direct assault on the enemy's positions. Undertaking an intricate flanking maneuver, Lieutenant McCollum infiltrated his men across the open ravine under heavy crossfire and ascended the heights behind the enemy as the company's main force continued firing on the hostile element's front. After overtly signaling friendly fire away from his position, he initiated a systematic sweep down through the enemy's hillside emplacements. He attacked an enemy bunker and overcame its unsuspecting occupant. An alerted North Vietnamese then turned and fired from his spider hole, seriously wounding an American. Realizing that the wounded man's recovery hinged on immediate evacuation, Lieutenant McCollum enlisted another soldier's aid and together they carried the casualty down the ridge through enemy positions. Their descent was obstructed by harassing fire from a nearby bunker. Lieutenant McCollum destroyed the fortification with grenades. When the wounded soldier had been delivered to safety, he made his way back to his men by the same treacherous route under a storm of machine gun and rocket-propelled grenade fire.

First Lieutenant McCrary distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 16 February 1967 while serving as a platoon leader with elements of the 7th Cavalry engaged with a well entrenched enemy force. When the two lead platoons came under intense insurgent fire, Lieutenant McCrary quickly directed a twelve man security team forward to outflank the hostile positions. However, as the team approached the objective, it was suddenly pinned down by devastating fire from concealed enemy bunkers. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Lieutenant McCrary started maneuvering the rest of the platoon toward the besieged force. After advancing to a position near the team, he called for his men to provide suppressive fire as he fearlessly crawled across the bullet-swept field alone. Upon reaching the stranded element, Lieutenant McCrary began to move among the endangered men, treating the wounded and shouting encouragement. Seeing one stricken man lying exposed across a dike, he tossed a smoke grenade to provide cover and then charged forward through a hail of insurgent bullets. But as he started to pull the man to safety, the smoke dissipated and Lieutenant McCrary was mortally wounded. His boundless courage and selfless sacrifice in trying to save a fellow soldier will serve as a source of lasting inspiration to all those who knew him.

Sergeant First Class McDermott distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 11 November 1967 while serving with his unit during the conduct of a mission in Kontum Province. He was driving the lead vehicle of a convoy on its way to repair a bridge which had been partially destroyed by enemy activity, when a company- size Viet Cong force unleashed a brutal ambush. A recoilless rifle round exploded against Sergeant McDermott's truck, but he managed to control the badly damaged vehicle and steered it off the road to allow the rest of the convoy to pass. Heedless of intense small arms and automatic weapons fire, he ran toward the rear of the truck to organize his men and move them out of the killing zone. As he came around the side of the truck, three enemy soldiers armed with automatic weapons were preparing to fire on the battalion chaplain. Firing from his hip, Sergeant McDermott killed the three insurgents. Disregarding his own safety, he continued moving through the ambush site to rally his troops. As he did so, two more Viet Cong leaped upon him and knocked him to the ground. He struggled free, wounding both of them, and then braved a savage fusillade to drive several of the convoy vehicles out of the ambush site. Gallantly leading his platoon in a fierce counterattack, he personally destroyed an enemy machine gun position. Sergeant McDermott continued to move forward under intense fire and exploding grenades, inspiring and directing his men until the Viet Cong were defeated. His unhesitating and courageous actions in close combat with a numerically superior hostile force were responsible for saving the lives of many fellow soldiers.

First Lieutenant McDermott distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 11 November 1967 while leading two rifle squads on a search and destroy operation near Chu Lai. The two squads were separated by two hundred meters when the point man in Lieutenant McDermott's squad surprised approximately fifteen North Vietnamese Army soldiers and opened fire on them. Lieutenant McDermott, realizing they had gained the initiative, immediately ran to the front of the squad and, disregarding the enemy fire, led his men as they chased the communists, personally killing two. Penetrating a North Vietnamese company command post, Lieutenant McDermott's aggressive action completely disrupted and disorganized the enemy troops, causing them to flee, leaving behind many of their weapons and equipment. Knowing that the approximately seventy North Vietnamese in the area would try to retake the position, he quickly called for his other squad to join him and organized a perimeter within the captured post. The enemy launched a fierce counterattack and Lieutenant McDermott was wounded by a hostile grenade, but refused medical treatment until after the aggressors had been repelled and a relief force arrived. Although painfully wounded, he left the medical holding area three times to direct his men in repelling enemy assaults. His fearless leadership, despite being vastly outnumbered, resulted in the complete rout of the communists.

Captain McDermott distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions while serving as Senior Advisor to the 5th Airborne Battalion, Airborne Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam, during the period 16 April 1972 to 20 May 1972 in the besieged provincial capital of An Loc. During this period, the 5th Airborne Battalion received daily attacks by numerically superior enemy forces during which Captain McDermott continuously exposed himself to the enemy fire and directed devastating airstrikes to turn back their assaults. When the embattled 5th Airborne Battalion was ordered to disengage from the enemy, he remained with rear elements of the unit and protected the movement to a more advantageous position by again directing numerous airstrikes. The enemy then launched a massive mortar and ground assault supported by tanks. During this attack, Captain McDermott disregarded his personal safety by moving from one position to another under a fusillade of enemy fire and adjusted airstrikes to eventually ward off the assault after eight hours of continuous fighting. His determination and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds served as inspiration to the weary paratroopers and rallied them to hold their positions.

Staff Sergeant McDonald distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 19 February 1967 while serving as Assistant Battalion Advisor to a Vietnamese airborne battalion during an attack by an overwhelmingly larger Viet Cong force. Sergeant McDonald was thrown to the ground by the initial mortar explosions that hit his camp. He rushed to the perimeter, through darkness that was filling with the light of hostile tracer rounds, and saw waves of Viet Cong assaulting to within close range. Engaging the insurgents at the point of heaviest fire, he succeeded in closing a gap in his unit's perimeter and killed four of the enemy. Although he was wounded in a subsequent mortar attack, Sergeant McDonald refused to be evacuated and resolutely remained at his post for eight and one-half hours. To prevent the Viet Cong from massing for an effective attack, he periodically saturated his perimeters with air and artillery strikes to within 30 meters of his own position. During the pauses, he led his men in fierce counterattacks on the insurgents. At one point, a Vietnamese soldier ran out to capture an enemy weapon and was cut down by hostile machine gun fire. Sergeant McDonald took two grenades with him, crawled under friendly machine gun covering fire, and threw the grenades into the hostile emplacements, and dragged the soldier to safety. Sergeant McDonald's indomitable fighting, and that of the Vietnamese, inspired by his bravery, accounted for more than 100 Viet Cong killed in action.

Specialist Four McDonald distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 10 April 1971. On that date Specialist McDonald was serving as a medical aidman for a six man reconnaissance team on an offensive mission in Phu My District, when the team was taken under fire by an estimated platoon-sized enemy force. The enemy-initiated contact included rockets, machinegun and automatic small arms fire. In the initial hail of fire, the team leader was severely wounded, and the remainder of the team was halted a short distance away, leaving him in an open, vulnerable position. Specialist McDonald, although wounded himself during the initial contact, realized the extreme danger his team leader was in and, with total disregard for his personal safety, exposed himself to the intense enemy fire and ran to the aid of his fallen team leader. He then placed himself between the team leader and the enemy and began returning fire. An incoming rocket landed nearby, wounding him for the second time as the force of the explosion knocked him to the ground. He immediately recovered and rolled over on his team leader to protect him from the enemy fire. Realizing that further movement was impossible, Specialist McDonald stood up between the enemy and the severely wounded man and began placing accurate semi-automatic fire upon the enemy positions, until he was mortally wounded by an enemy rocket.

Sergeant First Class McDougald distinguished himself while serving as Senior American Advisor to a company of Vietnamese soldiers during an assault of Nui Khet Mountain. Although a previous allied attack on the enemy emplacements had been repulsed, Sergeant McDougald led his men through the intense enemy fire up the steep incline of the mountain. As the enemy fire intensified, the sergeant crawled to a forward observation point where he directed allied artillery on enemy positions less than thirty meters away. Continuing the assault, he exposed himself to a hail of enemy bullets as he moved from man to another encouraging each to sustain the attack. Suddenly, Sergeant McDougald's company came under an intense grenade attack from an enemy bunker complex. Without hesitation, he moved to a large rock formation and tossed numerous grenades into the nearby enemy bunkers thereby destroying them. As a result of this action, the remaining friendly forces soon overran the enemy soldiers and secured the mountaintop for the allies.

Lieutenant Colonel McEnery distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 20 March 1969 as commanding officer during an assault on an enemy base camp. After having organized a combined armor and infantry task force to reinforce a platoon engaged with an enemy unit, he flew to the location of the firefight to assess the progress of his troops. Despite the heavy antiaircraft barrage directed at his helicopter, he continued flying at a low altitude to direct the movement of the ground elements. When communication with his ground commanders was disrupted, he had his aircraft land in the combat area in order to maintain control of the attack on the hostile positions. After organizing his elements into an assault formation, he climbed into the deck of a tank and led the assault into the hostile base camp. Although he was wounded by grenade fragmentation, he persisted in directing the operation until the enemy had been eliminated. Only after he was assured that all of the casualties were receiving medical assistance and that a defensive position had been established for the night did he consent to his own evacuation.
