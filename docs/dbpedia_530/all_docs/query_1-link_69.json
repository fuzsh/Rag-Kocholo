She then attended Suffolk University, before graduating from The Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts. Stephanie started working at The Log Cabin/Delaney House in High School and continues to work managing The Log Cabin/Delaney House locations at The Big E each September. Stephanie has been working for the MA Department of Revenue since 2007.\n\nStephanie is the sister of 2002 Grand Colleen, Katie Joyce who resides in Natick with her husband, Marty Walsh and the proud aunt to their children Grace, Gabrielle and Rowan Walsh. Her family looks forward to marching with Stephanie in the 2024 Parade!"
