        "text": "Ken Burns' Prohibition a rollicking/sobering look at America's nearly 14-year drinking game\n\nCoppers gang up on booze, ultimately to no avail. PBS photos\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nThe bar has been raised pretty high for Ken Burns. And that goes double for Prohibition, which after all is about drinking, the drive to end it and the abject failure to do so.\n\nHis vast portfolio of acclaimed documentary films for PBS dates to 1981's Brooklyn Bridge. The format remains the same: a blend of expert commentaries, celebrity voiceovers of historical figures, archival footage and stills, and mood music from three main sources -- pianos, horns, violins. This time keyboards have an upper hand.\n\nThe disparate topics are their own distinctive driving forces, though, with Burns and his longtime collaborator, Lynn Novick, sifting, winnowing and finally settling on what they hope will be just the right mix of audio and visual. Their new film is a masterpiece in that regard. It runs for five-and-a-half hours from Sunday, Oct. 2nd through Tuesday, Oct. 4th (7 p.m. central each night).\n\nProhibition of course is sobering at times. But it also can be almost riotously amusing in its depictions of what Prohibition wrought. Gangland violence wasn't exactly a blast. But speakeasies, flappers, the Charleston and a party girl columnist for The New Yorker -- whose pen name was \"Lipstick\" -- put a lot of bounce in this long look at the 18th amendment to the Constitution and its eventual repeal via the 21st. It's all perfectly narrated by Peter Coyote, who sets the table by observing that Prohibition \"was meant to eradicate an evil. Instead it would turn millions of Americans into law breakers.\"\n\nSunday's opening chapter builds to the climactic Jan. 17, 1920 enactment of Prohibition after a series of false starts and scare tactics. Its early advocates aren't entirely dismissed as close-minded, wrong-headed buzz killers. Alcohol consumption, mostly on the part of men, amounted to an epidemic way of life that led to early deaths and oft-brutish treatment of women who feared the arrival home of their drunken husbands.\n\n\"Americans routinely drank at every meal, including breakfast,\" Coyote says.\n\nActivists such as Eliza Jane Thompson and Frances Willard led marches and prayer vigils against demon rum and other forms of alcohol. They were taunted and in some cases stoned by saloon patrons. It was an early, primitive form of women's liberation, marked by considerable bravery on the part of those who dared to make their voices heard after years of staying at home, minding the children and wondering how they'd make ends meet after their husbands drank away the family income.\n\nCarrie Nation, best known among the early protestors, literally took matters into her own hands by entering what were supposed to be illegal saloons in Kansas and smashing away at them with a hammer and other implements. Bar owners took to putting up signs reading, \"All Nations Welcome Except Carrie.\"\n\nNone of this really worked. But then came the establishment of the federal income tax. From thereafter, \"the government would no longer have to rely on alcohol (taxes) to fund its operations,\" Coyote says.\n\nThe film also notes that many advocates saw Prohibition as a way to keep alcohol away from immigrant Americans and blacks, who were seen as inferior classes with little class when it came to the bottle. Veteran New York journalist Pete Hamill, never one to mince words, says that strict Prohibition constructionists would have imprisoned Jesus for turning water into wine. That kind of distills it.\n\nKeeping alcohol from the public never worked from the start. What America couldn't have was what America desperately wanted. And no amount of raids or other law enforcement tactics could quash the booming business in speakeasies or showy gangsters such as Chicago's Al Capone.\n\nBurns uses former Dallas Morning News sports writer Jonathan Eig as his Capone expert. Eig's growing number of non-fiction books includes Get Capone. He says that the notoriously popular bootlegger \"was the first media hound, the first publicity addict among the great gangsters.\" He held press conferences and bought off cops, politicians and reporters, reasoning that favorable copy about him would dupe the public because \"most people are stupid enough to believe what they read in the newspapers.\" Capone also made the cover of Time.\n\nOther colorful characters abound, including 1928 Democratic presidential candidate Al Smith, who flamboyantly campaigned for repeal of Prohibition with the zeal of this year's crop of Republican candidates pledging to overturn \"Obama care.\" But Herbert Hoover won election in a landslide after his allies branded Smith a dirty, drunken Catholic who would make illegal aliens of Protestant children and planned to build an underwater tunnel to the Vatican. Or at the very least allow the Pope to live in the White House.\n\nThat sounds pretty hilarious on paper, but some people bought it. Which meant that Prohibition endured through the Great Depression, which occurred on Hoover's watch and turned legions of his supporters against him. In the end, repeal of Prohibition essentially was viewed as a desperately needed jobs bill, with thousands of destitute Americans legally allowed to find employment in the beer and hard liquor industry. It all officially ended on Dec. 5, 1933 under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of Prohibition, which vividly and entertainingly recaptures an almost impossibly absurd era. In the end, it may be the most fun you'll ever have with a Ken Burns film. It probably will make you thirsty as well.\n\nGRADE: A\n\nDexter keeps up the carnage, spices it with spirituality\n\nIn the name of the father and the son and . . . Showtime photo\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nShowtime's latest publicity artwork for Dexter bills him as an \"Avenging Angel\" while picturing him in both a crucifixion pose and with bloody wings.\n\nSo there's an overriding religious motif at work as Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) again cuts to the chase while also eluding capture in Season 6 of the pay cable network's longest-running and most successful drama series.\n\nWhat's the meaning of his life? Will Dexter ever bow to a higher power, other than his still materializing deceased father? Can he get his two-year-old son, Harrison, into the very exclusive Our Lady of the Gulf pre-school after telling its Catholic head nun he's a non-believer?\n\nThere also are two religious zealots at large, and they do really awful things to their victims in the name of some very twisted form of holy retribution. Add a supposedly reformed ex-convict named Brother Sam, whose blessed-is-the-Lord body shop gives fellow felons second chances. But is he for real? And if so, can Dexter learn something from Brother Sam's latter day relationship with God?\n\nIn this context, it's perhaps hard to believe that Sunday's season opener (8 p.m central preceding the new and very much recommended Homeland) comes off as a little sitcom-y at times before later hitting its stride. Episode 2 is the strongest of the three sent for review, mainly because it introduces the complex Brother Sam. He's played with striking effectiveness by Mos, who used to be Mos Def and was born Dante Terrell Smith.\n\nHe'll have a season-long arc, as will Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks (rebooting from Fox's made-in-Dallas The Good Guys). They're respectively cast as creepy Prof. James Gellar and his pliant disciple, Travis Marshall. What they do to a fruit stand vendor -- all of it off-camera -- makes Dexter's methods of execution seem like time off for good behavior. The remains are left for Miami homicide to pore over.\n\nThe sitcom-y reference is to Dexter's 20-year high school reunion, which he attends in hopes of obtaining evidence on a self-absorbed jock whom he suspects of murdering the classmate he married. Largely dismissed as a nebbish during his teen years, Dexter's \"prestigious\" job as a blood spatter analyst -- plus the grisly loss of his own wife at the end of Season 4 -- combine to make him both a sympathetic figure and latter day hunk to many of his former female classmates.\n\nThat's a pretty big stretch. And the episode spends too much time in this rather carnival-like setting before involving the athletically inept Dexter in a comedy-laced flag football game in which he's participating only to obtain a blood sample.\n\nDexter eventually gets back to basics, but can't resist another dose of religious symbolism. The killer classmate, who has a big Jesus tattoo on his chest, pleads for mercy by falling back on his \"faith.\" That's not going to go very far with an atheist.\n\nEpisode 2 is appreciably better and the third hour includes a sterling guest shot by the redoubtable Ronny Cox, who plays an embittered retirement home coot with a sordid past and a dead-end future.\n\nDexter otherwise takes comfort in a nightly bedtime ritual with his son. First a little bubble bath, followed by some play activities and, initially, little Harrison's favorite \"monster\" story.\n\nAll of the cop shop principals, including Jennifer Carpenter as the title character's sister, Debra, are re-assembled and given new obstacles to overcome. There's no lack of one-on-one scenes with Dexter and Debra, even though in real-life Hall and Carpenter filed for divorce late last year after meeting on the set of the show and marrying in 2008. Their on-screen chemistry seems to still be in good working order.\n\nDexter likewise remains in solid shape, with new characters generating some additional heat while its namesake keeps plying his trade. It's always been a series unlike any other. And for those who swear by it, Dexter is still ably postponing its inevitable end-game with story lines that just won't let it quit.\n\nGRADE: A-minus\n\nNew fall season: Showtime's Homeland stands as the first great freshman drama -- and it's not even close\n\nClaire Danes and Damian Lewis propel Homeland. Showtime photos\n\nPremiering: Sunday, Oct. 2nd at 9 p.m. (central) on Showtime\n\nStarring: Claire Danes, Damian Lewis, Mandy Patinkin, Morena Baccarin, David Harewood, Diego Klattenhoff, Morgan Saylor, Jackson Pace\n\nProduced by: Howard Gordon, Alex Gansa, Gideon Raff, Michael Cuesta, Avi Nir, Ran Telem\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nNo new fall drama series on the broadcast networks comes anywhere near Showtime's Homeland. And that's being charitable to the broadcast networks, who have served up retro Playboy bunnies, wistful Pan Am fantasies, curvy crimefighters and nothing at all exceptional.\n\nHomeland, adapted from the Israeli series Prisoners of War, soars above this ho-hum field on the strength of its acting, storytelling and overall import in times when terrorist guessing games are still very much with us. It also gives Showtime television's best one-two dramatic punch, with the Season 6 premiere of Dexter returning Sunday as Homeland's lead-in.\n\nClaire Danes, an Emmy winner for her exceptional work in the HBO movie Temple Grandin, stars as impassioned but unstable CIA agent Carrie Mathison. Her ongoing \"mood disorder,\" controlled by clandestine doses of heavy medication, stems from lingering guilt that she \"missed something\" that might have averted the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks. She's now exceedingly vigilant, perhaps to the point of obsession.\n\n\"I'm just making sure we don't get hit again,\" she tells mentor/boss Saul Berenson during Sunday's opening episode.\n\nMathison is first seen in Baghdad, scurrying to get last second information from a condemned, imprisoned Iraqi source who now feels betrayed. But his last words to her, whispered through cell bars, begin to loudly resonate 10 months later. Marine Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), presumed dead since he went missing in 2003, has been rescued after years of torture and confinement. And he's coming home an American hero. It's more than enough to put Mathison on Code Red alert. Because the source's last words to her were, \"An American prisoner of war has been turned.\"\n\nHomeland is a contemporary descendant of The Manchurian Candidate with elements of the landmark PBS reality series An American Family also in play.\n\nThat's because Mathison and a bugger for hire have rigged the Brody home with surveillance cameras just before he returns in the company of his wife, Jessica (former V villainess Morena Baccarin), and their children, Dana and Chris (Morgan Saylor, Jackson Pace). She had been sleeping with one of her husband's Marine buddies, Capt. Mike Faber (Diego Klattenhoff). Now there's little recourse, save to welcome him back and pretend that nothing happened in his long absence.\n\nWatching this tableau from afar, Mathison at time feels like a voyeur, particularly when the Brodys are struggling to be intimate again. She frets in Episode 3 about whether the surveillance cameras will uncover anything of value or whether this all amounts to a non-stop \"reality show\" with a devoted audience of one.\n\nCo-executive producer Howard Gordon, the principal force behind Fox's 24, told TV critics this summer that Homeland's 13-episode first season will satisfactorily answer the question of whether the freed Brody in fact has been turned. So we're going to hold him to that while also being transfixed by the myriad possibilities in play during the first three episodes sent for review. The second hour was in production when Osama bin Laden's death was announced. Ergo, Episode 2 has a reference to his demise after earlier creating its own fictional terrorist threat, Abu Nazir.\n\nThe performances in Homeland are uniformly first-rate. Lewis has been in uniform before, as Major Richard Winters in the acclaimed HBO World War II miniseries, Band of Brothers. He in effect plays three Brodys -- the bloodied captive in prison flashback scenes, the clean-shaven \"hero\" presented for public inspection and the tormented returnee who recites Muslim prayers in a closed-door garage away from the cameras' prying eyes.\n\nDanes plays Mathison as a bundle of raw nerve endings, certain she's onto something but wracked with insecurities. Episode 1 has a terrific sequence in which she believes that all is lost after mentor Saul excoriates her for betraying him. A lone discordant jazz horn accompanies her agonies.\n\nOne of Homeland's reverberating lines comes in Episode 2, when Brody's behavior seems to be at odds with the conventional wisdom of how a double agent would proceed.\n\n\"No one said that becoming a terrorist was easy, Saul,\" Mathison blurts.\n\nHomeland expertly threads its needles, keeping viewers guessing without becoming obtuse. It's compelling, enthralling and steeped in current realities. While the broadcast networks flail about with their new, mostly disposable dramas, Showtime threatens to overtake HBO as the premier locale for series that really count.\n\nGRADE: A\n\nNew fall season: CBS' How to Be a Gentleman aims at male delivery\n\nGuess who the \"gentleman\" is. Give up? CBS photo\n\nPremiering: Thursday, Sept. 29th at 7:30 p.m. (central) on CBS\n\nStarring: David Hornsby, Kevin Dillon, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Dave Foley, Rhys Darby, Nancy Lenehan\n\nProduced by: David Hornsby, Adam Chase, Ted Schachter\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nSeveral previously anointed \"It Girls\" populate the new fall season. In the interests of at least a semblance of equal time, there's an \"It Guy,\" too.\n\nHe's Houston native David Hornsby (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), who not only stars in but produces and writes the CBS sitcom How to Be a Gentleman.\n\nUnself-consciously prissy, Hornsby's character, Andrew Carlson, sounds like The Church Lady and worships at the altar of refinement. But there's very little future in that because we live in times when boorish and/or infantile behavior are bull market commodities.\n\nCarlson, who writes a buttoned-down column for Marquis magazine, learns at the outset that his magazine is going in a new direction by \"targeting people who don't read.\" This news is broken by his editor, Jerry (the invariably entertaining Dave Foley), who's 50, wants to keep his job and therefore will go along with the program.\n\nA guffawing laugh track notwithstanding, there's obviously some serious and sobering truth to this. It's later further underscored when Jerry dyes his hair almost jet black in an effort to remain relevant. Also speaking volumes is his matter-of-fact notation that the magazine is going after \"that demographic Holy Grail -- men in their mid-to-late 30s who act like they're 15.\"\n\n\"It goes against my principles. I've got to put my foot down,\" Andrew tells Jerry when told that his column will have to assume the position and target that crowd.\n\n\"Then I'll have to fire you.\"\n\n\"What time is it due?\"\n\nAgain, though, this is a comedy. And true to the premise, it's broadly drawn in hopes of reaching some of those hard-to-get younger males. Another magnet is Kevin Dillon, who recently stopped playing braying Johnny Drama on HBO's Entourage. He's now in very similar form as gym owner Bert Lansing, a shoulder-punching \"man's man\" who used to regularly beat up Andrew when they were high school classmates.\n\nBert thinks it's funny to joke about his dad dying of \"cancer of the penis.\" Nah, he really didn't. But his sense of humor is the polar opposite of rarefied. And the low-brow but likable big lug is determined to mold Andrew into an aggressor male willing to shed his $500 blazer in favor of a tank top.\n\nThis dynamic works surprisingly well for a show that unapologetically \"is what it is.\" It made me laugh in fits and spurts, which CBS' more-praised 2 Broke Girls definitely didn't.\n\nThe cast also has a third familiar face in Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe from 24), who plays Andrew's tart sister, Janet. She's married to a compliant Britisher named Mike (Rhys Darby), who pretty much lets her walk all over him. But that's Janet's SOP.\n\n\"Oh, is this my birthday present from you?\" Andrew asks after absorbing a volley of her insults at a family dinner. \" 'Cause you gave me a hugh basket of bitchiness last year, too.\"\n\nMike and Janet's gift actually is an introductory session at Bert's Body Shop. So that's how they meet before forming an odd couple alliance in the interests of firming up Andrew's pecs and personality.\n\n\"When I look at you, I get sad,\" Bert tells him at a strip club. That's because Andrew knows \"everything about bein' a gentleman but nothin' about bein' a man.\"\n\nPaired with CBS' hit The Big Bang Theory on Thursdays, How to Be a Gentleman is alternately muscle-headed and muscular. Hornsby's writing isn't always razor sharp, but it pretty much gets the job done in an opening episode that both rings of truth and loudly rings the bell.\n\nThere's probably no danger of anyone laughing 'til they cry. But this is a comedy with a solid core group of characters and a chance to go the distance. Which in these times would be all the way to a second season. On opening night, viewers might find that Bert, Andrew and How to Be a Gentleman go pretty well with a well-mannered slice of brie -- and a bargain bottle of brewski.\n\nGRADE: B-minus\n\nRooney leaving 60 Minutes after Sunday's farewell commentary\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nDidja ever think you'd see the day when Andy Rooney would step down from 60 Minutes?\n\nWell, it's come.\n\nCBS announced Tuesday that the Sunday, Oct. 2nd edition of the program will mark the 92-year-old icon's last regular appearance as the closing commentator. Rooney himself will say as much on the air, the network said. He has been on 60 Minutes since 1978, and this will be his 1,097th essay.\n\nHis sign-off from weekly duties will be preceded by Rooney looking back on his career in an interview with 60 Minutes colleague Morley Safer.\n\nRooney was not quoted in the CBS announcement. But CBS News chairman and 60 Minutes executive producer Jeff Fager praised his \"immeasurable\" contributions to the program. \"It's harder for him to do it every week, but he will always have the ability to speak his mind on 60 Minutes when the urge hits him.\"\n\nRealistically, Rooney is very unlikely to return after Sunday's telecast. Whether he was pushed or is leaving entirely of his own accord, it's time for him to go. No one is entitled to these positions until death intercedes -- not even Rooney. Oft-parodied, sometimes controversial and suspended for three months in 1990 for his controversial off-camera comments about blacks and gays, Rooney arguably is irreplaceable but not immovable.\n\nHis first commentary for 60 Minutes, in July 1978, was about automobile fatalities on Independence Day, according to the CBS publicity release.\n\n\"There's nobody like Andy and there never will be,\" Fager said. \"He'll hate hearing this, but he's an American original.\"\n\nRooney also has written a string of bestselling books and is a World II veteran who was drafted into the Army in 1941. In the many years since, he certainly has had his say. And become a household name while doing so.\n\nNew fall season: ABC's teenage wasteland is otherwise called Suburgatory\n\nA dad and his unhappy daughter are front and center in Suburgatory. ABC photo\n\nPremiering: Wednesday, Sept. 28th at 7:30 p.m. (central) on ABC\n\nStarring: Jeremy Sisto, Jane Levy, Cheryl Hines, Carly Chaikin, Allie Grant, Alan Tudyk\n\nProduced by: Emily Kapnek, Michael Fresco\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nOh those kids.\n\nThey drive their parents crazy on The Middle and sorely vex them on Modern Family. Now ABC is copping more teen 'tudes with Suburgatory, which will be bridging its two established Wednesday night comedies.\n\nManhattan also is getting a full-blown workout in this new fall season. Innumerable characters are either living there or leaving against their will. Sixteen-year-old Tessa Altman (Jane Levy) is of the latter species. Single dad George (Jeremy Sisto) first finds an unopened box of condoms in her bedroom. Then he prematurely evacuates -- at least as far as she's concerned.\n\nSafe, sound, sunlit surburbia is their destination. And the sitcom embellishments include an abundance of pink, ultra-immaculate lawns, boob jobs for all the moms, sugar-free Red Bulls for their kids and George as an incoming object of desire.\n\n\"Pretty ironic that a boxful of rubbers landed me in a town full of plastic,\" Tessa bitingly narrates. There's a lot of that going around, too, with voice-overs setting the table -- and re-setting it -- on a bunch of freshman comedies and dramas. It's easier than staging scenes and also saves on the time and money it takes to film them.\n\nSuburgatory, which like its Wednesday night running mates is without a laugh track, has some nice touches in its passably amusing opening episode. It also joins the likes of 2 Broke Girls, Whitney and Free Agents in its zeal to be sexplicit.\n\nA scene at a shopping mall includes a rather jarring exchange among Tessa, incumbent surburban mom Dallas Royce (Cheryl Hines) and her spoiled teen daughter, Dalia (Carly Chaikin).\n\nMom first marvels at a pair of skimpy \"boyfriend shorts\" before Dalia says they'll \"show off my belly ring.\"\n\n\"You know what else that will show off,\" Tessa fires back. \"Your vagina.\"\n\nMeanwhile, this is the first comedy series for Sisto, who previously has played Jesus in a CBS miniseries and an oft-creepy schizophrenic on HBO's Six Feet Under. He gets through the opening episode in pretty good shape, walking a tightrope between being Tessa's punching bag and a would-be bedmate for Dallas and other married or single lonely hearts. Architect George apparently hasn't had much action since \"my mom ducked out shortly after they cut the umbilical cord,\" as Tessa puts it in one of her narratives.\n\nDad and daughter almost succumb to a full-out shouting match after she keeps calling him \"George\" while insolently sipping a can of Red Bull at the dinner table instead of eating the meal he's prepared. She storms out and he's left agreeing that he's ruined his only kid's life. The next morning at the breakfast table, she's reading \"How to Become An Emancipated Minor\" while he opts for \"Is Adoption for You?\"\n\nBut Tessa of course thaws a bit before the closing credits roll. Maybe suburbia and its over-the-top moms aren't so bad after all. Maybe dad deserves the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I'm amazed that an olive branch comes in the form of a gaudy pink bra bought for Tessa by Dallas, a woman \"who knows a thing or two about bras.\"\n\nLet's see how it all develops. For now, Levy is an OK mix of insolence and vulnerability, Hines is her usual hoot and Sisto shows signs of being nimble on his feet in an arena where he's still learning the ropes.\n\nGRADE: B-minus\n\nNew fall season: CW's Hart of Dixie goes south without too many hick-ups\n\nHart of Dixie is headed by Rachel Bilson (center). CW photo\n\nPremiering: Monday, Sept. 26th at 8 p.m. (central) on The CW\n\nStarring: Rachel Bilson, Scott Porter, Jaime King, Wilson Bethel, Cress Williams\n\nProduced by: Leila Gerstein, Josh Schwartz, Stephanie Savage, Len Goldstein, Jason Ensler\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nNicely spiced by broad but interesting characters, Hart of Dixie easily is the most grounded of The CW's three new fish-out-of-water serial dramas. Even if the network's latest transplanted young woman immediately throws her fried fish-out-of-water into the trash basket rather than eat it for lunch.\n\nThis one is set in fictional Bluebell, Alabammy, where nose-in-the-air Dr. Zoey Hart (Rachel Bilson from The O.C.) finds herself after failing to get a cardio-thoracic surgeon fellowship while interning in New York City.\n\nBasically, her beside manners have never been operative. And when advised to go into general practice for a year, she scrunches up and says, \"First of all, diarrhea and diaper rash -- ewww.\"\n\nBut Zoe ends up reluctantly responding to a series of postcards sent by a mysterious elderly gent who attended her college graduation four years earlier. He had kept inviting her to work at his small general practice in Bluebell, which is so remote that the bus taking her there doesn't get any closer than three miles away. Left to walk the rest of the distance on a country road, Zoe luckily encounters a handsome, refined attorney named George Tucker (Friday Night Lights alum Scott Porter). He's of course driving a pickup truck, because that appears to be the area's only mode of transportation. But he's nice 'n' friendly and loyal to his hometown after his own brief stay in Manhattan proved to be less than satisfactory.\n\n\"You can call it what you want,\" George says of Bluebell. \"But I call it home.\"\n\nZoe gets her shots in early, initially dismissing Bluebell as a backwards hillbilly haven. The sight of southern belles dancing in Civil War dresses puts her off her feed more than the slathered fried catfish does.\n\n\"OK, someone needs to tell the people in this town that it's 2011,\" she says before dressing down a blonde throwback named Lemon Breeland (Jaime King) as \"some southern xenophobe dressed up like a stick of butter.\"\n\nBut it gets better. Bilson's Zoe is appealing in her own stuck-up way, and her encounters with various townies are surprisingly well-played. One of them unfortunately won't be around much longer. Nancy Travis, cast as a down-home doctor's assistant named Emeline Hattenbarger, will be co-starring as Tim Allen's wife in ABC's upcoming Last Man Standing sitcom. So she'll have time for just one more episode of Hart before moving on.\n\nBurt Reynolds, the name given to a roaming town alligator, also is being written out because he just didn't take direction very well, producers of the show told TV writers at the recent Television Critics Association \"press tour.\" And Tim Matheson's flinty Dr. Brick Breeland -- \"Believe you me, Zoe Hart, we are going to chase you away from our waters\" -- will be at best a recurring character, although he'll appear in eight of the first 13 scheduled episodes.\n\nThere are still enough weekly regular characters under contract, though. Cress Williams (also from Friday Night Lights) is instantly likable as mayor Lavon Hayes. He's a self-assured former NFL star who refers to himself in the third person and got elected because of his longstanding football fame. Also residing in Bluebell is ladies man and would-be country rocker Wade Kinsella (Wilson Bethel), who tells Zoe she's \"drunk as a boiled owl\" before she impulsively makes out with him in his -- but of course -- pickup truck.\n\nHart of Dixie also afflicts Zoe with a domineering mom who blows into Bluebell to rescue her daughter from this living hell before a fairly surprising twist leaves her fresh out of ammo. By this time, Zoe has already come to the aid of a portly country girl with a belittling mother and a baby on the way.\n\nThe series overdoes it a bit with the banjo music and has a little too much narrative from Zoe. Still, it's an inviting first hour, with plenty of room to grow via a cast of solidly drawn central characters and whatever patients of the week pop into Zoe's new practice. There's nothing here to suggest that Hart of Dixie will cure cancer or garner any Emmy nominations. But it goes down pretty easy if you'd like to set down for a spell with a disarmingly pleasant little down-home melodrama.\n\nGRADE: B-minus\n\nNew fall season: Fox'sTerra Nova goes picturesquely prehistoric but with a prototypical script\n\nStanding tall in prehistoric Terra Nova. Fox photo\n\nPremiering: Monday, Sept. 26th at 7 p.m. (central) on Fox\n\nStarring: Jason O'Mara, Shelley Conn, Stephen Lang, Landon Liboiron, Naomi Scott, Slana Mansour, Christine Adams, Allison Miller\n\nProduced by: Steven Spielberg, Peter Chernin, Rene Echevarria, Brannon Braga\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nEven with the cast's inflated salaries, at least 10 Jersey Shores could be made for the price of one Terra Nova. And that also includes the liquor bill.\n\nSo Fox should be credited for putting some real money on the screen and striving to add an \"event\" to the broadcast TV landscape. Absent miniseries and all but shorn of made-for-TV movies, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox have long been nickel-and-diming it on the luster front. Terra Nova is a profligate spender, with its futuristic and prehistoric worlds of desolation and dinosaurs.\n\nNot that Monday's delayed two-hour premiere isn't also laden with predictability, pat situations and a script that too often thuds instead of clicks. Originally scheduled to air after May's final performance edition of American Idol, its production problems apparently had everything to do with the special effects and little to do with punching up the storyline.\n\nHead producer Steven Spielberg supposedly is very \"hands-on\" with this project, which unfortunately doesn't result in much overall originality.\n\nThere of course must be a slightly fractured family with a resentful teen and a wide-eyed little kid in the mix. His name is Josh. Her name is Zoe.\n\nLater on, a pack of willful coming-of-agers, including Josh, is packed into an armored vehicle which is then assaulted by a \"slasher\" monster with a lethal tail while adults ride to the rescue. It's an an overlong sequence without any real bite or jeopardy.\n\nHeavy-handed pronouncements also are front and center, with tough but compassionate Col. Nathaniel Taylor (Stephen Lang of Avatar in full verbal battle dress. Referring to the renegade \"Sixers\" striving to topple him, Taylor sets his jaw and says, \"I'll tell you this. I'm not gonna let them. I'm not gonna let anybody stand in the way of what we are building here. Terra Nova will succeed.\" Gotcha. Now have a milk shake.\n\nThis grand stage is first set with a big-print preamble: \"At the dawn of the 22nd century, the world is on the verge of environmental collapse. Mankind's only hope for survival lies 85 million years in the past.\"\n\nIn other words, ignorance of climate change rather than a complete economic meltdown proved to be the ultimate lethal weapon in what publicity materials for Terra Nova say is the year 2149. (That's not quite the \"dawn\" of the 22nd century, but let's move on.)\n\nThe central family is the Shannons, who have secretly defied a law against having more than two children. But authorities move in and arrest former Chicago cop Jim Shannon (Jason O'Mara) after he punches an onerous \"Population Control\" officer. His doctor wife, Elisabeth (Shelley Conn), looks on in horror, as do kids Josh (Landon Liboiron), Maddy (Naomi Scott) and illegal Zoe (Alana Mansour).\n\nJim gets a stiff sentence in unforgiving Golad Prison. And two years later, his wife and the two oldest kids are selected to travel through a portal to prehistoric Terra Nova. Through unconvincing means, Elisabeth slips Jim a key to his freedom while Zoe is smuggled in a backpack. They all make it in rather preposterous fashion to Terra Nova, where Josh suddenly cops a 'tude and says it's dad's \"own damn fault\" for being locked up and \"you can't just come back after all this time and start telling me what to do.\"\n\nFunny, but up until that time Josh didn't want to go to Terra Nova without his pop alongside them. During the series' various re-boots, did they simply veer implausibly into a new direction in order to input more conflict?\n\nDad decrees that \"we're starting over -- as a family,\" before being assigned to pick giant weeds. But he quickly alters that career course by making a heroic effort that causes Col. Taylor to re-evaluate him. Taylor shows some signs of being enigmatic and driven by a secret agenda. But he mostly makes pronouncements for now.\n\nThere's a cute scene involving little Zoe feeding a long-necked gentle giant of a dinosaur. And the first major action sequence is pretty pulsating, with a Carnotaurus chasing a team of Sixers and the two leading men while they all race back to the protected settlement in low-riding armored vehicles. The climactic scene is poorly edited, though. Watch for it when Taylor lures a Carno with his gun blazing before Jim rides rather miraculously to his rescue.\n\nTerra Nova also strongly hints at deeper secrets and entanglements, with a cryptic reference by Sixer leader Mira (Christine Adams) to the \"real reason for Terra Nova's existence.\" Namely, \"Control the past, control the future.\"\n\nIt's then time for the reunited Shannon family to gather in unison for a closing shot framed by a very full moon.\n\nUnder present plans, Fox says it can only air 13 episodes of Terra Nova per season. And that would include a Season 2 if it happens. For one, the series is expensive. It also takes longer for each episode to emerge with its special effects fully intact.\n\nWill the network get enough bang for its bucks? Or will its biggest hit of the new season so far -- the comedy series New Girl -- end up being 10 or 20 times more cost-effective?\n\nTerra Nova certainly doesn't lack ambition and scope, which is a plus. But its first two hours fall short in the storytelling department. There's still time to make this a series about more than dino-mite. At present, its creatures only have to roar in prototypically primal fashion. The humans get stuck with the scripts, which so far puts them in double jeopardy.\n\nGoing directly against a Dallas Cowboys game in Week 1 won't help matters either. Endangered quarterbacks provide a lot more real-life suspense than anything Terra Nova can dream up.\n\nGRADE: C+\n\nNew fall season: ABC's Pan Am looks good, but has the dramatic heft of a plywood plane\n\nAll aboard for a little Pan Am glam. ABC photo\n\nPremiering: Sunday, Sept. 25th at 9 p.m. (central) on ABC\n\nStarring: Christina Ricci, Margot Robbie, Kelli Garner, Karine Vanasse, Jonah Lotan, Michael Mosley\n\nProduced by: Tommy Schlamme, Jack Orman, Nancy Hult Ganis\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nMad Men has style and substance in abundance. ABC's new Pan Am, also set in the early 1960s, merits some style points but is a mere carry-on bag in the other department.\n\nLife and air travel were different back in 1963. And in the early seconds of Pan Am, a mockup of a Life magazine cover has beauteous new stew Laura (Margot Robbie) under a \"Welcome to the Jet Age\" headline. Imagine leg room. Those were the days.\n\nBeyond selling the glamour of it all, Pan Am may be very hard-pressed to come up with weekly storylines that impel viewers to climb aboard. The Love Boat had a spacious vessel, numerous compartments and Isaac the fun-loving bartender. Fantasy Island offered scenic beauty and the odd couple duo of Mr. Roarke and Tattoo. Both welcomed assembly lines of celebrity guests, ranging all the way from Andy Warhol to Ruth Buzzi. You could eat an entire box of Whitman's Sampler chocolates while watching these things.\n\nPan Am's opening episode centers on a six-and-a-half-hour flight from New York to London, aided and abetted by numerous flashbacks to fill out the hour. You want jeopardy or hijinks? Well, one of the stewardesses, named Kate (Kelli Garner), is an apprentice in-flight secret agent of sorts. In the interests of Cold War intrigue, she's assigned to smuggle something into an officious passenger's briefcase. Can you feel the excitement? Nor could I.\n\nThe aforementioned Laura is a runaway bride who raced away with Kate (her sister) in a red convertible while mama had a fit. Both Laura and \"rebellious bohemian\" Maggie (the accomplished Christina Ricci wasting her time) yearn to spread their wings and see the world. But an officious middle-aged stewardess matron, with her hair in a tourniquet-like bun, makes sure that all of her charges are first dutifully wearing their girdles. If you want a 1960s reference, she looks like Lotta Lenya's villainous henchwoman, Rosa Klebb, in From Russia with Love.\n\nThe other featured stew is French Colette (Karine Vanasse), who -- ooh la la -- had an affair with a guy who turned out to be married. She learns this when the cad boards the New York to London flight with both his wife and their wide-eyed son in tow. A-w-w-w-w-wkward.\n\nThere are a couple of pilots, too, both of whom barely look old enough to navigate the planes at Disneyland. Weren't flyboys of that era at least George Clooney's age?\n\nWhatever the case, Dean (Jonah Lotan) is a dashing twentysomething navigator who intends to marry stunning stewardess Bridget. But she instead pulls a disappearing act. Co-pilot Ted (Michael Mosley) considers himself a real cocksman out of the cockpit. \"Yeah, who's filling in the rest of her?\" he cracks when when told that Maggie is a last-minute fill-in for Bridget.\n\nThe planes are nice looking, though. And those pale blue Pan Am stewardess uniforms look great when all four principals are marching in lockstep toward a waiting plane while a little girl looks on in awe and dreams of someday being one of them. The period music's suitably retro-cool, too, with Mack the Knife in full swing down the homestretch.\n\nBut where do we go from here? Pan Am strives to sell the notion that \"adventure calls,\" as Maggie tells Laura. But how so? Crashing into a body of water during a ratings \"sweeps\" period might be a one-time possibility. But in Sunday's opener there's really nothing more calamitous than a \"patch of rough air.\"\n\nCo-executive producer Tommy Schlamme previously helped to helm The West Wing, so maybe he can find a way to somehow sustain this thing. That seems doubtful, though. Even a sidetrip flashback to a Bay of Pigs rescue operation lays flat in the premiere episode. And as for the instantly unlikeable co-pilot Ted, there should be a law against him even once getting lucky.\n\nGRADE: C\n\nNew fall season: CBS' A Gifted Man gives the network a ghost of a chance to at last make a medical drama stick\n\nShe's a ghost, he's her ex-husband on A Gifted Man. CBS photo\n\nPremiering: Friday, Sept. 23rd at 7 p.m. (central) on CBS\n\nStarring: Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Ehle, Margo Martindale, Pablo Schreiber\n\nProduced by: Susannah Grant, Neal Baer, Carl Beverly, Sarah Timberman\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nCBS hasn't had a hit medical drama in ages.\n\nIt's done OK in recent years with the supernatural, though. Ghost Whisperer ran for five seasons on Friday nights and then Medium hung in for a year-and-a-half after CBS rescued it from NBC's cancellation.\n\nSo what to do next? Pair a hard-charging, career-obsessed doctor with an ex-wife who's returned from the dead. And lead off Friday nights with them in hopes that CBS viewers will have missed seeing ghosts on this night and at this hour.\n\nA Gifted Man, the only one of five new CBS series to be \"updated\" with a revised inaugural episode, is still falling short of making a dynamite first impression. Still, it's a fairly affecting opener in which someone dies but at least isn't murdered. On crime-choked CBS, that qualifies as a stroll through the park on a beautiful day -- with benefits.\n\nPatrick Wilson stars as Manhattan-based Dr. Michael Holt. He's first seen brow-beating co-workers in the operating room, making him initially seem like Dr. Gregory House or, for TV viewers with long institutional memories, Ben Casey.\n\nBut what if either of those guys were to be revisited by a beaming, sweet-tempered ex-wife who looks like a younger Meryl Streep? And what if they got along great despite their breakup in Alaska? And then what if Michael learned that Anna Paul (Jennifer Ehle) in fact had died two weeks earlier on the eve of taking a director's job at the Clinica Sanando in a poor NYC neighborhood?\n\nWell, Michael at first is more than a little spooked. But Anna's soothing and recurring visits start to take the edge off his brusque behavior. He even starts behaving humanely, bringing a poor Hispanic mom and her sick kids to his high-toned hospital for some on-the-house health care.\n\nFirst do no harm -- as they say in the medical profession. A Gifted Man won't kill any brain cells if you want to give it a try. But it's not all there yet with an unwieldy mix that also includes two life-threatening cases, a few scenes with Michael's frazzled sister, Christina (Julie Benz) and her problematic teen son and an attempted exorcism of sorts by a mystic named Anton (Pablo Schreiber). Publicity materials say he'll be a series regular, as will Michael's sharp-tongued aide, Rita Perkins-Hall (Margo Martindale fresh off her best supporting actress Emmy win for Justified).\n\nThere's also this central question: why did Michael and Anna break up in the first place? Yeah, he was starting to put his career first and she obviously was more of an idealist. But this is the sweetest woman on the face of the earth -- or so we have every reason to believe. And she's gorgeous, too.\n\nIn death, she's also life-affirming.\n\n\"I have all these things to finish. All these doors I left open,\" Anna tells Michael. Won't he help her close them? By the way, she asks him very, very nicely.\n\n\"You don't fit into who I am,\" he replies. \"I can't be delusional.\"\n\n\"Why can't I be the one thing in life you don't understand?\" she counters.\n\nBut he says that's always been the case.\n\nDon't worry, though. She's not going anywhere, because CBS may well need a friendly ghost to make one of its medical dramas finally click.\n\nYour Friday night alternatives at this hour on the other four major broadcast networks are ABC's transplanted Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, NBC's on-its-last-legs Chuck, Fox's hell-raising Kitchen Nightmares and The CW's ass-kicking Nikita.\n\nIn that realm, CBS' spirit is willing and a viewer's flesh is weaker if you're lucky enough to have reached the end of another long work week. Soothing the soul with an otherworldly massage may not be such a bad idea under the circumstances.\n\nGRADE: C+\n\nNew fall season: Winging it without a flight plan in ABC's new Charlie's Angels\n\nBosley's pretty, too, in yet another new Charlie's Angels. ABC photo\n\nPremiering: Thursday, Sept. 22nd at 7 p.m. (central) on ABC\n\nStarring: Minka Kelly, Annie Ilonzeh, Rachael Taylor, Ramon Rodriguez\n\nProduced by: Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Drew Barrymore, Leonard Goldbert, Nancy Juvonen\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nNothing against eye candy, \"jiggle\" or memories of Farrah Fawcett making outstanding contributions in both.\n\nBut Charlie's Angels surely is a worn-out franchise after the campy, iconic original, two feature films and a pair of failed efforts -- Angels '88 and Angels '89 -- that both fell short of full series status despite the presence of Tea Leoni.\n\nBy now you know, though. ABC is rebooting anew with a Charlie's Angels in which they're all former criminals given second chances by condescending old Charlie Townsend. It leads off the network's Thursday prime-time schedule, with the action originating in Miami and the scripts apparently bought from Godawful, Inc.\n\nHere's the lineup, introduced by Charlie himself (Robert Wagner backed out and Victor Garber reportedly will voice the new Charlie, although ABC still won't officially confirm anything.):\n\nAbby Sampson (Rachael Sampson) used to be a \"Park Avenue princess turned thief.\"\n\nGloria Morales (Nadine Velazquez) was \"court-martialed for a deadly mistake.\"\n\nKate Prince (Annie Ilonzeh) is a former \"dedicated police detective turned dirty cop.\"\n\nExcept that one of them is going to be blown to bits early in Thursday's premiere episode. That leaves an opening for former Friday Night Lights co-star Minka Kelly as Eve French. She's fresh from four years in the slammer after pleading no contest to grand theft auto and manslaughter.\n\nJohn Bosley is the only same-named character from the original series. But he's no longer a pudgy court jester. This Boz is a hunk played by Ramon Rodriguez. And in a sting operation set at a \"Heaven and Hell\" costumed soiree, he even gets to seduce an evil Russian Natasha whose name is actually Nadia.\n\nMissing amid the action scenes is any real sense of fun. Instead the script groans with lines such as \"You know, I never thought my heart could hurt this much.\" Or this from Charlie, for whom a gag order should be issued: \"Just remember, you're Angels of justice, not Angels of vengeance.\"\n\nMinka's newbie Angel also gets to be rather gruesomely tortured by Carlos Bernard of 24 fame, who plays a thoroughly nasty child trafficker named Pajaro. He might as well be twirling a handlebar mustache while he punches and electro-shocks poor Eve.\n\nThe acting pretty much dips to the level of the opening night script, which may well be what a reviewer or two said of the 1976 premiere episode of the original Charlie's Angels. But that series had a wink-and-a-nod sensibility in addition to its scenic beauties. Thirty-five TV seasons later, the new Angels strives to take itself seriously, even when Abby spouts lines such as, \"We're Angels. Not Saints.\" And by the way, they \"don't exactly play by the rules either.\" Guh-roan.\n\nEve plays a bit hard to get before of course joining the crew. Just what does Charlie expect of an Angel, she wonders. And will there at least be a gift basket (she doesn't wonder).\n\n\"He keeps his criteria close to his vest,\" Bosley replies in one of the clunkier lines ever written for anybody.\n\nThe theme song at least hasn't been changed. It remains oddly listenable in a Montovani sort of way. Who the hell's Montovani? Case closed, before my head explodes.\n\nGRADE: D\n\nNew fall season: NBC's Prime Suspect is an applause-worthy encore\n\nHats off to Maria Bello in the new Prime Suspect. NBC photos\n\nPremiering: Thursday, Sept. 22nd at 9 p.m. (central) on NBC\n\nStarring: Maria Bello, Aidan Quinn, Brian F. O'Byrne, Tim Griffin, Kirk Acevedo, Damon Gupton, Peter Gerety\n\nProduced by: Peter Berg, Alexandra Gillespie, Sarah Aubrey, Julie Meldal-Johnson, Paul Buccieri, Lynda LaPlante, John McNamara, Kenny Johnson\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nHow dare they try to do a new Prime Suspect series without Helen Mirren as put-upon, hard-boiled London detective Jane Tennison.\n\nWell, NBC has taken that dare and done a very decent job of it in a Manhattan-based version starring Pennsylvanian Maria Bello as tough-minded detective Jane Timoney.\n\nRenaming her a bit doesn't seem all that necessary. Not that it's of any capital concern once Bello gets rolling. She's convincingly ambitious and resilient from the start, when her biggest adversary is the cigarette-smoking she's just given up.\n\nWe first see her jogging, coughing, spitting and chewing nicotine gum before having a set-to with a recalcitrant cab driver. Then it's on to the featured crime scene, which is thoroughly and graphically blood-soaked.\n\nAnd of course the victim is a woman because research tells the networks that viewers will be more \"invested\" in catching the perpetrator if his prey is considered more vulnerable or sympathetic. Unfortunately, the number of women murdered in the name of various crime shows -- added to the number of little girls kidnapped -- has long ago over-stepped the boundaries of exploitation. Whatever the overall quality of Prime Suspect, it's same old/same old in that respect. The depictions of the corpses, as well as the descriptions of what's been done to them, should also be cause for concern. Unfortunately, though, there's no statute of limitations on this.\n\nBack at the Prime Suspect cop shop, the resident boys club still considers Timoney the enemy. Rumors that she slept her way into a transfer have prompted some of the animosity. It still seems at least a little over-played, though, even if Timoney has an ally in Lt. Kevin Sweeney (solid work by Aidan Quinn). He's the department boss, trying to exercise a firm hand while also allowing his personal office to be an ad hoc bar where the men drink jumbo shots of straight liquor from cartoon-emblazoned jelly jars.\n\nTimoney finds herself running in place until one of these guys drops dead from a heart attack. She brazenly lobbies for his cases and pisses Sweeney off before he gives them to her.\n\nThe opening episode has been re-worked to all but eliminate a side case involving a woman thrown from the top of a 152-story building. Timoney instead turns her energies toward solving the serial rapist case. She sometimes wears a smallish fedora while on the street in her police uniform. From this perspective it's an odd distraction. But Kojak had his lollipops and Columbo his rumpled raincoat. So we'll see.\n\nTimoney also lives with a guy named Matt (Kenny Johnson) and has time to visit her supportive pop, Desmond (Peter Gerety). The denouement in Thursday's opening episode leaves her strikingly bloodied for a woman detective. Her first question of a fellow cop: \"Do you have a cigarette?\"\n\nCo-executive producer Peter Berg brought Friday Night Lights to the small-screen, so he's not afraid of TV adaptations. His drama series invariably look \"authentic.\" And Prime Suspect is studiously gritty.\n\nBello's performance is the prime reason to watch, though. She's got the chops to succeed Mirren, even if she never surpasses her. The best new crime drama of the fall season doesn't necessarily have to be an original idea. It just has to have the right people in place.\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nNew fall season: CBS' Person of Interest had this person pretty interested\n\nJim Caviezel & Michael Emerson star in Person of Interest. CBS photo\n\nPremiering: Thursday, Sept. 22nd at 8 p.m. (central) on CBS\n\nStarring: Jim Caviezel, Michael Emerson, Taraji P. Henson, Kevin Chapman\n\nProduced by: J.J. Abrams, Bryan Burk, Jonathan Nolan, David Semel, Greg Plageman\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nMen o' action used to be plentiful in prime-time. Handy with their fists and at ease with weaponry, they'd slug and shoot their way through whatever crooks were available.\n\nNow they're a dying breed. Women call the shots in most of this fall's new dramas, with just one of them dependent on a hard-charging leading man. Old school CBS is the carrier and Person of Interest is the show. Buckle up.\n\nJim Cavaziel, beaten to death in The Passion of the Christ, gets a chance to mete out punishment as a presumed dead former government operative who feels betrayed and looks like hell until Michael Emerson from Lost finds him.\n\nThe Lost link extends to co-executive producer J.J. Abrams, who initially masterminded that series before pretty much leaving it to others. He's now behind Person of Interest, a vigilante-style numbers game in which Emerson's \"Mr. Finch\" has an incredible array of data but otherwise needs some muscle to keep bad things from happening. That's where Cavaziel's Reese comes in, with neither principal character getting a full name so far.\n\nIn what amounts to the obligatory flashback scene, Reese is first seen in the sack with the love of his life, Jessica. The date turns out to be Sept. 11, 2001. And from that day on, Reese apparently had some very bad things happen to him, including Jessica's demise. It's led him to the point of being a very disheveled looking suicidal drunk who's slouched in a Manhattan subway car when accosted by a group of young punks.\n\nThey shouldn't have done that. Because Reese easily bloodies, bruises and subdues all four of them before being taken to the cop shop for questioning. His interrogator, a homicide detective named Carter (series regular Taraji P. Henson), tries to feel his inner pain. But her mystery man is soon bailed out and taken off to meet Mr. Finch. \"You need a purpose,\" Reese is told. \"More specifically, you need a job.\"\n\nSo Finch riddles him this. He has a post 9/11 wealth of social security numbers at his disposal, and a woman prosecutor currently is at the top of his list. This means that in the very near future, she's either in jeopardy or plans to jeopardize others. Reese's mission, should he accept it, is to avert whatever's about to happen. He's at first reluctant, of course, but gets quickly into the swing of things.\n\nReese's specialty in Thursday night's opener is shooting adversaries in their thighs. This serves to disable them without deep-sixing them. \"I don't particularly like killing people,\" he says. \"But I'm very good at it.\"\n\nReese also is well-practiced in the arts of breaking and entering, and cell phone tapping. It greatly aids him in keeping tabs on the mark of the week. Meanwhile, Finch limps along at his side -- literally -- while otherwise exhorting him from afar to act quickly or all is lost. It's somewhat akin to The Equalizer, the 1980s CBS action series in which a disillusioned former government secret agent came to the aid of innocents while also occasionally consulting with his former Agency boss.\n\nPerson of Interest cuts deeper than that, with viewers also getting a little treatise on why Finch is so good with numbers. Ya see, the federal government built this incredible array of all-seeing devices and machines after 9/11. And Finch designed and built the principal hardware before becoming haunted by the idea that only major life-and-death situations were of interest to the feds. Garden variety murders, at the rate of one every 18 hours in Manhattan -- were not on the government's radar for some reason. Finch felt bad about that, even though he expects to be murdered himself some day for his rogue efforts.\n\nEmerson is well-suited to this stuff after six years as the manipulative Benjamin Linus on Lost. Cavaziel plays his role straight up and a little creepily at times. His sense of humor occasionally kicks in. But even Chuck Norris on Walker, Texas Ranger had an overall more jovial temperament.\n\nPerson of Interest, which has a dank but filmic look to it, will also be unraveling layers of both men's traumatic back stories. Because that's the way Abrams rolls. Pretty much everything is a conspiracy.\n\n\"Let's just say you're not the only one that's lost something,\" Emerson's Finch tells Reese later in the premiere episode, emphasizing the word \"lost\" in case you somehow couldn't place him.\n\nTogether they'll be the brains and brawn of this operation in times when the broadcast networks aren't particularly interested in take-charge men with acquired tastes for pounding the hell out of bad guys -- or shooting them in their thighs. Thanks. We maybe needed that.\n\nGRADE: B\n\nNew fall season: NBC's Whitney gets off to a smart 'n' snappy start\n\nWhitney Cummings is in front of cameras for her 2nd fall show. Photo: Ed Bark\n\nPremiering: Thursday, Sept. 22nd at 8:30 p.m. (central) on NBC\n\nStarring: Whitney Cummings, Chris D'Elia, Rhea Seehorn, Zoe Lister-Jones, Maulik Pancholy, Dan O'Brien\n\nProduced by: Whitney Cummings, Scott Stuber, Quan Phung, Betsy Thomas, Barry Katz, Andy Ackerman\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nNBC has branded Whitney Cummings this fall's \"It\" girl. It doesn't necessarily mean she's the best thing about the new sitcom Whitney, although she's still quite a bit better than good.\n\nThe revelation here is Chris D'Elia, who plays Whitney's live-in boyfriend, Alex. He's the low-key, but quick-with-a-quip anchor of a series in which the title character and her two likewise high-strung girlfriends are far less likely to tone it down.\n\nD'Elia, who like Cummings comes from the standup comedy world, is a solid delivery man when it comes to making the most of his somewhat secondary role. At a wedding reception, for instance, Whitney is caught in the act of prematurely glomming onto the cupcakes after earlier being talked out of wearing white.\n\n\"Wow, you're on fire tonight,\" D'Elia's Alex notes. \"What are you closing with -- blackface?\"\n\nThe two of them have been together for three years, with no inclination to become Mr. and Mrs. Her parents have both been divorced three times, so it's Whitney's opinion that \"getting married is so dumb.\" Alex is more than OK with that, although their lax sex life could use a little boost. Or at least Whitney feels that way, prompting her to wear a naughty nurse's outfit to surprise Alex when he returns home. First, though, he'll have to fill out the patient forms. It's a funny bit, and you're probably assuming it doesn't end well. It doesn't.\n\nCummings, whose career began catching fire on the E! network's Chelsea Lately, is very busy this fall. She's also the co-creator and executive producer of CBS' 2 Broke Girls, which rocked the ratings with a Monday premiere that capitalized on the coattails of the preceding debut of Ashton Kutcher as Charlie Sheen's replacement on Two and a Half Men.\n\nWhitney, the only NBC comedy with a studio audience and attendant laugh track, is slotted after The Office on Thursday nights. So it's also following a show in transition, with James Spader stepping in to fill the void left by Steve Carell.\n\nCummings has nowhere near the acting experience of any of the aforementioned stars. But she acquits herself well in Whitney's opener, with D'Elia landing some welcome softer punchlines. How nice it is to have a guy who's neither a shouter nor a whiner.\n\nSitcoms also can rise and fall on the strength of their supporting players. Whitney's so far/so good gal pals include a sardonic divorcee named Roxie (Rhea Seehorn) and the much sunnier Lily (Zoe Lister-Jones), who's proud of her frequent sex with boyfriend Neal (Maulik Pancholy). A rather tiresome would-be playuh named Mark (Dan O'Brien) rounds out the ensemble. He's also a cop.\n\nThe premiere episode for the most part is snappily written and bracingly vibrant. And D'Elia can be relied on to take it down a notch when needed. It all makes for a promising start on a network whose best comedies invariably wind up on Thursday nights. Whitney is already there, and looks as though it just might belong.\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nNew fall season: ABC's Revenge seems fated to plot 'n' plod along\n\nSee that steely look? This girl wants plenty o' Revenge. ABC photo\n\nPremiering: Wednesday, Sept. 21st at 9 p.m. (central) on ABC\n\nStarring: Emily VanCamp, Madeleine Stowe, Gabriel Mann, Henry Czerny, Josh Bowman, Nick Wechsler, Christa B. Allen, Ashley Madekwe, Connor Paolo\n\nProduced by: Mike Kelley, Marty Bowen, Wyck Godfrey\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nConfucius doesn't get referenced much on network TV these days. After all, the very ancient Chinese philosopher skews way past the desired 18-to-49-year-old network demographic. Even most college kids likely are more familiar with the musings of a Kardashian.\n\nBut there he is, setting the table for ABC's new Revenge serial drama with a little printed advice right up top. \"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves,\" he supposedly advised long before even Larry King could book him as a guest.\n\nThen comes the rather lengthy narrative of the very wronged Emily Thorne (Emily Van Camp), a coming-of-age masquerader with an unbending agenda to thoroughly eviscerate a filthy rich Hamptons family .\n\n\"For the truly wronged,\" she says in part, \"real satisfaction can be found in only one of two places -- absolute forgiveness or mortal vindication. This is not a story about forgiveness.\"\n\nOK, OK, got it. But Revenge keeps redundantly driving this point home throughout Wednesday's frequently heavy-handed premiere. It also often looks and sounds like a CW series, with a willowy young blonde beauty at its center and irksome pop music vocals never far away.\n\nABC has strong-willed women at the throttles of all four of its new fall season dramas while men are on doofus patrol in the new sitcoms Last Man Standing and Man Up. In Revenge, the plots are driven by both avenging Emily and haughty \"Queen Victoria\" Grayson (Madeleine Stowe), who specializes in sense-of-entitlement charity functions when she's not screwing underlings into submission.\n\nThe new season is heavy on flashbacks, and Revenge certainly has its share. There's an apparent murder in the opening minutes, with Emily seemingly the orchestrator while also attending a lavish nighttime engagement party at which she's the fiancee.\n\nThen it's back to three months earlier, with Emily moving into a sprawling beach house located next door to the Graysons' high-priced spread. By the way, Emily's not her real name. And she's come to avenge the framing of her beloved, recently deceased father, with whom she's seen as a very happy little girl via those aforementioned looks at her past.\n\nThe Grayson home, not an altogether happy one, is also populated by unfaithful hubby Conrad (Henry Czerny), vacuous teen daughter Charlotte (Christa B. Allen) and her reasonably serious-minded older brother, Daniel (Josh Bowman), who's just returned home for the summer after another semester at an expensive college.\n\nThere's also indulgent Nolan Ross (Gabriel Mann), who wears twitty pants and knows of Emily's past. Add well-ground, boat-owning young Jack Porter (Nick Wechsler), who also has a past association with Emily but doesn't yet know it.\n\nThe story gets fairly intriguing after awhile, with the ring-wise Stowe crafting a formidable villainess. But Van Camp's Emily tends to be too much a purveyor of intense stares and redundant vows to cross everyone off her list. And she keeps this up right until the end.\n\n\"They say vengeance is a dish best served cold,\" Emily says with a solemnity that by now has gotten rather laughable. \"But sometimes it's as warm as a bowl of soup.\" In other words, she's just doctored a sap's bisque in the interests of making him pay.\n\nI'm not sure this is sustainable, particularly in a time slot opposite two long-running close-ended dramas. NBC is still in there punching with Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and CBS has transfered CSI: Crime Scene Investigation to Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (central), where it very well could be rejuvenated with redoubtable Ted Danson in the cast.\n\nRevenge, on the other hand, is a dish that might leave you kind of cold. Sometimes you just want a single serving, with the table cleared by episode's end. This one keeps passing its spinning plates while re-stating the obvious.\n\n\"Like I said,\" Emily concludes. This is not a story about forgiveness.\"\n\nThen please stop saying it.\n\nGRADE: C+\n\nTwo and a Half Men welcomes Kutcher, leaves Sheen decidedly dead\n\nAshton Kutcher symbolically emerges from a cloud of Charlie Sheen's ashes on the season premiere of CBS' Two and a Half Men. Photos: Ed Bark\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nDust to dust to Dustbuster.\n\nFew if any TV characters have been dumped more unceremoniously than Charlie Sheen's womanizing Charlie Harper. Two and a Half Men and its creator, Chuck Lorre, saw to that Monday on the hit sitcom's ninth season premiere. At the same time Sheen himself was being roasted on Comedy Central by a who's who of who are theys and what have they done lately. What a night.\n\nTwo and a Half Men began with a closed casket funeral service for Charlie Harper, with his trademark shirt and shorts as a backdrop and brother Alan (Jon Cryer) trying to get through a eulogy while various attendees ripped on his late brother.\n\n\"Gave me herpes,\" said one of Charlie's conquests.\n\n\"Chlamydia,\" said another.\n\nAnd let 's hear it for \"vaginal warts.\"\n\nCharlie's stalker neighbor, Rose (Melanie Lynskey), then described how he died after one of his many ex-girlfriends, played by Jenny McCarthy, carped, \"I didn't come all this way to spit on a closed coffin.\"\n\nBut alas, Charlie supposedly slipped on a metro platform and fell in front of a speeding train while he and Rose were in Paris and planning to be married. But he \"didn't suffer,\" she added. \"His body just exploded like a balloon full of meat.\"\n\nSo much for sentiment -- and for the funeral service.\n\nBack home at Charlie's Malibu pad, brother Alan fretted about having to sell the place. A few guest stars popped in to look the place over -- Jon Stamos plus Jenna Elfman and Thomas Gibson still in character from Dharma & Greg. Then an urn of Charlie's ashes arrived.\n\nAlan prepared to sprinkle them on the beach before a figure appeared at the sliding glass door. A startled Alan flung Charlie's ashes into the air. And as the cloud settled, viewers got their first glimpse of Ashton Kutcher as a broken-hearted internet billionaire named Walden Schmidt. The studio audience reception was tumultuous. And Alan later got around to vacuuming up Charlie's remains with a Dustbuster.\n\nSheen lately is apologizing to all concerned in hopes of getting a network to pick up his planned new comedy based on the movie Anger Management. But it's hard to fault Lorre for sticking it to him while also making Sheen's character symbolically disappear from the show before the air cleared and his replacement stood front and center.\n\nWhatever his state of mind, Sheen viciously tore Lorre apart during his only recently ceased \"bitchin' rock star from Mars\" daze. Now Lorre is having his say, writing Charlie Harper off in no uncertain terms before having Kutcher's new character tell his brother, \"I'm sorry I made you spill him.\"\n\nWhether this new dynamic will work is still an open question. Kutcher's character was fresh from trying to drown himself after his wife, Bridget, dumped him. But the ocean water proved to be too cold, leading him to the Harper pad.\n\nKutcher initially played Walden as a teetotaling manchild with lots of money. But Alan took him out to a bar and got him loaded on appletinis before they returned with two women in hand. Both ended up sleeping with Walden, who was pretty proud of himself the next morning while walking naked around the house. He's \"hung like an elephant,\" Alan noticed. And by the way, Walden also will be buying Charlie's Malibu digs, setting up a new Two and a Half Men with the same old premise. An on-the-rebound Walden gets the girls, and no doubt will enjoy this new lifestyle. Alan again is left at the altar.\n\nKutcher's performance was OK for starters. He took the edge off by redeploying elements of his old doofus Michael Kelso character from That '70s Show. So he likely won't be as cynical as Sheen's Charlie. And off-camera, Kutcher also likely will show up for work in reasonable working order.\n\nIt's hoped that Sheen's latest rehab effort will be long-term. He seemingly hasn't killed his career just yet. But in case there were any lingering doubts, his time on Two and a Half Men is emphatically over. Lorre literally exploded Charlie Harper, ridiculed him at his funeral and then left his ashes fit for a Dustbuster.\n\nIt doesn't get much more final than that.\n\nNew fall season: Unforgettable gives CBS another sturdy crime hour with a gimmick and two tested stars\n\nPoppy Montgomery stands out in another new crime drama. CBS photo\n\nPremiering: Tuesday, Sept. 20th at 9 p.m. (central) on CBS\n\nStarring: Poppy Montgomery, Dylan Walsh, Daya Vaidya, Michael Gaston, Kevin Rankin\n\nProduced by: Sarah Timberman, Carl Beverly, Ed Redlich, John Bellucci\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nConventional crime-solving doesn't really cut it anymore, particularly on a network with so many \"procedurals\" already on the books.\n\nIt's better to have a gimmick in the same way that long-running \"reality-competition\" series now need a \"twist\" to keep viewers coming back for new editions. On CBS' Unforgettable, a former detective with hyperthermesia is able but not always willing to acutely remember every day of her life. Marilu Henner says that she has this very rare condition. And she's now a consultant on Unforgettable, which also falls back on an old TV standby.\n\nThat would be established star power. And the two principals in this new whodunit, Poppy Montgomery and Dylan Walsh, respectively had long runs on CBS' Without A Trace and FX's Nip/Tuck.\n\nThe Popster, never afraid to showcase a still laudable bod, has her hair dyed red for the role of New Yorker Carrie Wells. She used to be a Syracuse cop, as was Walsh's Al Burns. They also shared some sack time before a breakup that she took very personally. But as luck would have it, Carrie just happens to live in a Queens apartment building where a stabbing murder occurs. And Al is on the case before he learns of her new whereabouts.\n\nUneasily together again, they reconstruct the crime through Carrie's immense attention to detail. In her recollections, she is both out-of-body Carrie and on-the-scene Carrie. That in Itself is another pretty good gambit on a series that looks as though it can step right in and be the latest hit CBS crime hour. It's not a great series, but it looks to be a solidly commercial one. And Tuesday's opener does a workmanlike job of unraveling the ID of the killer in understandable fashion while also poking at the Carrie-Al backstory.\n\nPoppy's figure also figures in. She twice shows about as much skin as an advertiser-supported broadcast network can withstand. Viewers also can catch her in a skin tight supah-slinky dress during a night of blackjack card-counting that briefly puts Carrie in jeopardy with the dese/dem/dose muscle guys.\n\nMeanwhile softer Carrie volunteers at a nursing home, in large part because one of the ailing denizens is quite close to her. There's also the matter of the unsolved murder of her older sister, Rachel, which happened when Carrie was just a kid. Haunting visions of that snowy, horrible day still plague her, and for the first time in a long time she's again starting to put together how it might have happened and who did it. But remains a cold case for now.\n\nUnforgettable has an effective heart-to-heart talk between Carrie and Al as they begin to repair their relationship. Another scene -- in a diner -- doesn't work as well. Al sweet-talks her -- \"You look good, Carrie\" -- and then tempts her sweet tooth with an offer to split a piece of pecan pie. While he goes to get it, she recalls the two of them in bed together. How sweet it was. Then it's back to the crime at hand.\n\nABC will go directly against Unforgettable with another red-headed wrong-righter -- Dana Delany in the returning Body of Proof. Which might well mean that NBC's competing Parenthood will take a further ratings hit from which it can't recover.\n\nThe first episode of Unforgettable also works in a little off-hand plug for CBS' longest-running \"procedural,\" which will be moving to Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (central) this season while Ted Danson joins the cast in place of Laurence Fishburne.\n\n\"Gotta love CSI,\" Walsh's Al says during a first encounter with his latest crime scene. \"Everybody's an expert now.\"\n\nGiven all the on-screen clutter these days, it wouldn't be all that surprising to see a simultaneous pop-up ad for CSI: Crime Scene Investigation touting its new night, time and star.\n\nOld-school, straight-ahead crime-solving dramas need all the help they can get these days.\n\nGRADE: B-minus\n\nNew fall season: The star of Fox's New Girl isn't conventionally foxy (but that's the point)\n\nZooey Deschanel stands out in New Girl's male threesome. Fox photo\n\nPremiering: Tuesday, Sept. 20th at 8 p.m. (central) on Fox\n\nStarring: Zooey Deschanel, Max Greenfield, Jake Johnson, Lamorne Morris, Hannah Simone\n\nProduced by: Liz Meriwether, Jake Kasdan, Peter Chernin, Katherine Pope, Dave Finkel, Brett Baer\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nShe's lately being dubbed \"adorkable,\" which pretty much fits. Even at age 31.\n\nZooey Deschanel, still on the cusp of being quite famous after her role in Cameron Crowe's 2000 Almost Famous, is far and away the principal selling point of Fox's New Girl.\n\nWhether bawling her eyes out during another viewing of Dirty Dancing or singing little ditties whenever the mood strikes, Deschanel has the same instant appeal America Ferrera had in ABC's Ugly Betty. She's disarming, oddly charming and equipped to say \"Pink wine makes me slutty\" in a way that makes her endearing instead of \"Real Housewife\" material.\n\nIn New Girl, nicely paired with the returning Raising Hope on Tuesday nights, Deschanel plays the freshly jilted\n\nJess Day. She tried to spice it up with her boyfriend by making a surprise return to their apartment in nothing but a trenchcoat. But her would-be stripper fantasy turned into a well-worn sitcom setup. He was in bed with another woman and she suddenly needed a new place and a fresh start.\n\nNew Girl cuts quickly to this chase, with Jess auditioning to be the incoming roommate of three not entirely bright but pretty functional guys.\n\nSchmidt (Max Greenfield) is the resident horn dog whose inappropriate blurts find him constantly sticking dollar bills into the \"Douche Bag Jar.\" He also enjoys taking his shirt off to reveal a pale, hairless torso with budding muscular development. His trainer/roommate, called \"Coach,\" is played by Damon Wayans, Jr. in the first episode.\n\nWayans apparently wasn't super-confident that his previous comedy series, Happy Endings, would be picked up by ABC. But it made the fall schedule (on Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. central), requiring him to honor his contract and return.\n\nA new character, named Winston (Lamorne Morris), will move in next week. Premise: he returns from playing basketball in Latvia and takes back the bedroom he had sub-letted to Coach. The usual tack would have been to re-shoot portions of the pilot with the new actor as Coach. But a penny saved is a penny earned, particularly in these tough economic times. And the Douche Bag Jar just hasn't taken in enough money yet.\n\nBartender Nick (Jake Johnson) is the third man about the house. He's still recovering from his girlfriend dumping him six months ago. And he can get a little weepy about it. Jess also has a best friend model named Cece (Hannah Simone), who immediately has the boys prototypically drooling.\n\nAll three male actors have their moments in Tuesday's opener. with Greenfield's Schmidt so far the most amusing. But this series basically belongs to Zooey, whose big sister Emily Deschanel already has made her bones as the co-star of Fox's long-running Bones. Her little mannerisms and misadventures are sometimes indescribably delicious, whether she's striving to pull off a \"hot farmer's daughter\" look for an ill-fated blind date or trying to perfect a flirtatious smile. Although the above Fox artwork doesn't show it, she regularly wears dark-rimmed specs.\n\nSome of this can be just a bit much, with Jess's impromptu theme song for herself not exactly a laugh riot in either the opening credits or in a subsequent little scene. Fox seems to be on the right track, though, with a lead character who has ample potential to gawkily bloom and grow.\n\nThe fall season is dominated by new comedies and dramas that will sink or swim on the strength of their featured female characters. New Girl will be asking a lot of Zooey Deschanel, and so far she seems primed and ready to make her mark.\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nFootball night in America: Friday Night Lights scores its first major Emmys on a winning night for broadcast over cable networks\n\nKyle Chandler exults at end of acceptance speech. Photos: Ed Bark\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nReversing their fortunes from recent years, free over-the-air broadcast television networks won almost twice as many Emmys as their pay cable counterparts in Sunday night's 63rd annual ceremony on Fox.\n\nPaced by ABC's Modern Family and PBS' Downtown Abbey, the final score of 16-9 was a mirror opposite of last year's results, when cable programs took home 17 of the 26 statues. (Miniseries and made-for-TV movies were combined in the same category for the first time, resulting in one less award.)\n\nNBC's Friday Night Lights, nominated for the first time as best drama series in its fifth and final season, couldn't quite win the big one. AMC's Mad Men triumphed in that category for the fourth straight year, tying three former NBC stalwarts -- Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, The West Wing -- for the most wins ever in this competition.\n\nBut the made-in-Austin drama, set in fictional Dillon, Texas, won its first two major Emmys, with Kyle Chandler honored as the best lead actor in a drama series while Jason Katims won for writing.\n\nChandler, who played tough but tender high school football coach Eric Taylor for FNL's five seasons, began his speech with a \"Wow\" before adding that he'd written nothing in preparation because \"I knew for a fact that I would not be standing here.\"\n\nHe later thanked \"the people of Austin, Texas, who welcomed us into their home and filled those stadiums and brought the show to life while we were there.\"\n\nKatims ended his speech with FNL's signature exhortation on game nights: \"Clear eyes. Full hearts. Can't lose.\"\n\nThe series, which struggled in the Nielsen ratings throughout its run, survived to win Emmy gold because DirecTV stepped in to help NBC finance it for the last three seasons. Under the arrangement, DirecTV showed the episodes first before NBC repeated them.\n\nFNL had won only one previous Emmy, in the \"Creative Arts\" category for best casting of a drama series.\n\nModern Family had the most Emmy wins Sunday night, climactically repeating as prime-time's best comedy series in the closing minutes of the three-hour telecast while also winning four other statues. The best supporting actor and actress Emmys in the comedy category went to first-time recipients Ty Burrell and Julie Bowen, both of Modern Family.\n\nPBS' Downtown Abbey ran right behind Modern Family with four Emmys, including a triumph in the best movie or miniseries division. That category long has been ruled by HBO, whose Temple Grandin was a dominant force last year. But HBO won just four major Emmys this time out, including a lead actress prize for Kate Winslet and a best supporting actor nod for Guy Pearce in the miniseries remake of Mildred Pierce.\n\nThere were a slew of first-time winners but repeaters also flexed. Besides Mad Men, Comedy Central's The Daily Show won for the ninth straight year in the Variety, Music or Comedy Series competition while CBS' The Amazing Race prevailed for the eighth time in nine tries as television's best \"Reality-Competition\" series. Its only loss was last year to Bravo's Top Chef.\n\nThat again left prime-time's most popular series, American Idol, winless in this still relatively new category. Host Ryan Seacrest and judge Randy Jackson did not seem amused during a fleeting reaction shot after Amazing Race again was announced as the winner. Host network Fox ended up with no Emmy victories at all on Sunday night, although its cable cousin, FX, got some stage time with Justified, whose Margo Martindale won for best supporting actress in a drama series.\n\nThe Daily Show's win was preceded by presenter Scott Caan's prediction of the inevitable. \"Let's see who's gonna lose to The Daily Show this year,\" the Hawaii Five-O co-star and recurring Entourage cast member deadpanned before ticking off the other nominees.\n\nHost Jon Stewart resisted any retaliatory one-liners, praising the competition and adding, \"We're acutely aware of how fortunate we are.\"\n\nEmmy host Jane Lynch was an exuberant dazzler Sunday night.\n\nJane Lynch very capably rose to the task of Emmy host, fronting an opening song and dance film that marked the only time she briefly wore her trademark track suit as Glee's acidic Sue Sylvester.\n\nLynch otherwise opted for a series of shimmering low-cut gowns throughout the night. After losing the best supporting actress in a comedy statue to Bowen, she cracked that were she not hosting, \"I'd be home by now eating a tub of turkey meatballs.\"\n\nModern Family won the night's first four Emmys, prompting Lynch to tell the audience after a commercial break, \"Welcome back to the Modern Family awards.\"\n\nThe openly gay Lynch, who won an acting Emmy last year, made a couple of references to her sexuality. But not for long. \"You know, a lot of people are very curious why I'm a lesbian,\" she said late in the telecast. Lynch then immediately introduced the cast of Entourage, which presented some movie/miniseries awards.\n\nA lately chastened and remorseful Charlie Sheen, in the midst of a mea culpa tour that took him to NBC's Tonight and Today shows late last week, showed up to present the lead actor in a comedy series Emmy to repeat winner Jim Parsons of CBS' The Big Bang Theory.\n\nSheen's former Two and a Half Men co-star, Jon Cryer (whom he had called a \"troll\"), was shown applauding the fired \"Rock Star from Mars\" from the audience before he said of Two and a Half Men, \"From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season.\"\n\nSheen's replacement, Ashton Kutcher, later joined Cryer onstage as a presenter. \"And John, I want to tell you something,\" he said. \"I do not think that you're a troll.\" Cryer then mock-wept in his arms.\n\nIn one of the night's nicer touches, the six nominees for best lead actress in a comedy series all gathered one-by-one onstage as their names were announced. The surprised winner, Melissa McCarthy of CBS' Mike & Molly, then received a crown and roses before she made her acceptance speech. \"Holy smokes,\" McCarthy said twice.\n\nNominee Steve Carell of The Office also was in attendance, but again left empty-handed. It was his ninth Emmy nomination without a win, with six of them for his signature role of Michael Scott in NBC's acclaimed version of the British original. Mad Men leading man Jon Hamm also lost anew, and is now 0 for 6.\n\nCarell has left The Office while Hamm currently is in production on the fifth season of Mad Men. Are both fated to join other prominent TV stars who have never won an Emmy? It's already too late for the late Jackie Gleason; the list of snubs also includes Andy Griffith, Jason Alexander, Angela Lansbury, Larry Hagman and Desi Arnaz.\n\nHere is a complete list of Sunday night's winners:\n\nDrama series -- Mad Men\n\nComedy series -- Modern Family\n\nMovie or Miniseries -- Downton Abbey\n\nReality-competition series -- The Amazing Race\n\nVariety, Music or Comedy series -- The Daily Show\n\nLead actress, drama series -- Julianna Marguilies, The Good Wife\n\nLead actor, drama series -- Kyle Chandler, Friday Night Lights\n\nSupporting actor, drama series -- Peter Dinklage, Game of Thrones\n\nSupporting actress, drama series -- Margo Mardindale, Justified\n\nLead actor, comedy series -- Jim Parsons, The Big Bang Theory\n\nLead actress, comedy series -- Melissa McCarthy, Mike & Molly\n\nSupporting actress, comedy series -- Julie Bowen, Modern Family\n\nSupporting actor, comedy series -- Ty Burrell, Modern Family\n\nLead actress, movie or miniseries -- Kate Winslet, Mildred Pierce\n\nLead actor, movie or miniseries -- Barry Pepper, The Kennedys\n\nSupporting actress, movie or miniseries -- Maggie Smith, Downton Abbey\n\nSupporting actor, movie or miniseries -- Guy Pearce, Mildred Pierce\n\nWriting, drama series -- Jason Katims, Friday Night Lights\n\nDirecting, drama series -- Martin Scorsese, Boardwalk Empire\n\nWriting, comedy series -- Steven Levitan, Jeffrey Richman, Modern Family\n\nDirecting, comedy series -- Michael Spiller, Modern Family\n\nWriting, movie or miniseries -- Julian Fellowes, Downton Abbey\n\nDirecting, movie or miniseries -- Brian Percival, Downton Abbey\n\nWriting, variety, music or comedy series -- dozens for The Daily Show\n\nDirecting, variety, music or comedy series -- Don Roy King, Saturday Night Live\n\nPrimetime Emmys again will get tackled by Sunday Night Football, but here are my picks anyway\n\nJane Lynch of Glee is the latest Emmy host. Fox photo\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nThe 63rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards are coming, and it's a pretty safe bet that no one has an office pool going or a big dress-up party planned.\n\nThese aren't the Oscars, after all. They're just the Emmys, which will be soundly whipped opposite NBC's Sunday Night Football game in which Philadelphia Eagles QB Michael Vick returns to Atlanta to play his former team.\n\nBut for the record, Sunday's scheduled three-hour ceremony (7 to 10 p.m. central on Fox) will be hosted by Glee's Jane Lynch and produced by Mark (Survivor) Burnett. Here are the nominees in major categories, and my picks of who should win.\n\nCOMEDY SERIES\n\nThe Big Bang Theory (CBS)\n\nGlee (Fox)\n\nModern Family (ABC)\n\nThe Office (NBC)\n\nParks and Recreation (NBC)\n\n30 Rock (NBC)\n\nModern Family merits a second straight trip to the winner's circle.\n\nDRAMA SERIES\n\nFriday Night Lights (NBC)\n\nBoardwalk Empire (HBO)\n\nGame of Thrones (HBO)\n\nDexter (Showtime)\n\nThe Good Wife (CBS)\n\nMad Men (AMC\n\nGotta root for the home state team in what will be FNL's first and last chance to win an Emmy. Realistically, though, I think Boardwalk Empire has the inside track, although The Good Wife could surprise and Mad Men hasn't lost yet in its first three seasons of eligibility.\n\nMINISERIES OR MOVIE\n\nMildred Pierce (HBO)\n\nCinema Verite (HBO)\n\nDownton Abbey (PBS)\n\nThe Kennedys (ReelzChannel)\n\nToo Big to Fail (HBO)\n\nThe Pillars of the Earth (Starz)\n\nI'm picking Downton Abbey in an upset, although I'd rather see Mildred Pierce win.\n\nVARIETY, MUSIC OR COMEDY SERIES\n\nThe Colbert Report (Comedy Central)\n\nThe Daily Show (Comedy Central)\n\nReal Time with Bill Maher (HBO)\n\nLate Night with Jimmy Fallon (NBC)\n\nSaturday Night Live (NBC)\n\nConan (TBS)\n\nFallon is very well-liked in the industry and really makes an effort to involve his guests in creative skits. So this would be another upset, but I kind of think his time has come. Notice that neither David Letterman or Jay Leno is nominated. And it's about time they weren't.\n\nREALITY-COMPETITION PROGRAM\n\nThe Amazing Race (CBS)\n\nAmerican Idol (Fox)\n\nDancing with the Stars (ABC)\n\nProject Runway (Lifetime)\n\nSo You Think You Can Dance (Fox)\n\nTop Chef (Bravo)\n\nAmazing Race had never been beaten in this category until last year, when Top Chef won. That leaves Idol still Emmy-less. So I'm going to go with the highest-rated series in all of television, if only to see the look on Simon Cowell's face if the show wins in its first season without him.\n\nLEAD ACTOR, DRAMA SERIES\n\nSteve Buscemi, Boardwalk Empire\n\nMichael C.

NBC photo\n\nPremiering: Monday, Sept. 19th at 9 p.m. (central) on NBC\n\nStarring: Eddie Cibrian, Amber Heard, Laura Benanti, Jenna Dewan Tatum, David Krumholz, Naturi Naughton, Leah Renee, Jenifer Lewis, Wes Ramsey\n\nProduced by: Brian Grazer, Chad Hodge, Francie Calfo, Jason Burns, Dick Rosenzweig, Ian Biederman\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nThanks for getting this far. If you're seeing these words, you've at least briefly taken your eyes off the above Playboy bunnies and are now reading this for the article. And that's still why everyone pages through Playboy. Right? Even if the magazine's subscription base has taken a deep dive over the years.\n\nIn that respect, NBC's The Playboy Club potentially could breathe some life into a dying empire. Set in the early 1960s, it harkens to times when . . . well, let the series' mock Hugh Hefner explain it in his opening narrative while a bunny vocalist coos \"Chicago.\"\n\n\"The scheming, corrupt, crime-filled Windy City may have been all those things,\" an unseen Hef impressionist tells viewers. \"But I built a place in the toddlin' town where everything was perfect. Where life was magic. Where the rules were broken and fantasies became realities for everyone who walked through the doors. It wasn't the '50s anymore. Yes, it was a place where anything could happen to anybody. Or, any bunny.\"\n\nThe series itself is as hackneyed as Hef's come-on. But no one was expecting Masterpiece Theatre or even Nash Bridges. So perhaps the Peacock's easy-on-the-eyes ode to America's first full-figured bunny hatch will draw enough oglers to somehow survive a tough 9 p.m. (central) slot opposite ABC's Castle, CBS' Hawaii Five-O and ESPN's Monday Night Football.\n\nJust in case, though, NBC has dumped a big vat of gangland intrigue onto these proceedings. New bunny Maureen (Amber Heard), fresh from Fort Wayne, quickly ends up on the receiving end of a drooling mobster's advances while she goes backstage at the club to replenish her cigarette case.\n\nIn the initial pilot, he was a \"key player\" who ended up dead with Maureen's stiletto heel in his ear. The revised version has a much more prolonged struggle, with both Maureen and suave playboy attorney Nick Dalton (Eddie Cibrian) trying to fight off the creep. She ends up kicking him in the neck and hitting him square in the jugular with the business end of a bunny shoe. And this time he's not just a key player. He's crime family head Bruno Bianchi. Uh-oh.\n\nIn either case, Maureen didn't mean to kill him. And Bruno ends up deposited in the Chicago River while Maureen and Nick try to engineer a cover-up. His previous mob ties complicate matters. As do his ambitions to run for state attorney, which he can't consummate without more than a little help from his unsavory friends.\n\nMaybe NBC would have been better off just showing the bunnies off. Which it does to good effect in a scene where a mock Tina Turner encourages everyone to \"shake a tail feather.\" Which they do. Woo-hoo.\n\nBut no. Playboy Club is pockmarked with dialogue that gives cliches a bad name. Such as Nick telling Maureen, \"You have no idea what these people are capable of.\" And Maureen shooting back, \"I've been on my own since the day I was born. And I've worked too hard to get here. And I'm not gonna let anyone stop me.\"\n\nThis particular discourse occurs in Nick's swank, two-story, impeccably furnished penthouse, where he's spent many a night with a veteran bunny and girlfriend named Carol-Lynne (Laura Benanti). She of course pops in unexpectedly while Maureen hides in the closet but leaves her discarded bunny outfit in plain sight.\n\n\"This isn't what you think,\" Nick protests.\n\n\"You don't know what I'm thinking,\" retorts Carol-Lynne, who later informs Nick that she's a \"one-strike girl, baby. And I'm walkin' away.\"\n\nGroan. Why couldn't the script have been deep-sixed along with big Bruno?\n\nOK, let's meet the rest of the bunnies, who are given their daily marching orders by club manager Billy Rosen (a mis-cast David Krumholtz from Numb3rs).\n\nBunny Janie (Jenna Dewan Tatum) has been known to have sex with the bartender on company time. She also enjoys those delicious blueberry crepes with vanilla sauce after a long, long night of partying at Hef's nearby Mansion, where the bunnies all hole up. If she eats too many, Janie just sticks her finger down her throat and vomits as part of \"this new diet I heard about.\"\n\nThe newly installed \"bunny mother\" -- that would be Carol-Lynne -- has nothing against crepes but quickly establishes some new rules that otherwise cramp Janie's style. No more sex with club employees or customers, she commands. And furthermore, \"your tails are poofier and your corsets tighter.\"\n\nBunny Brenda (Naturi Naughton) is the self-described \"chocolate\" member of the crew. She aspires to be the first centerfold of color because \"you can't discriminate against these babies.\" (Scroll to the above picture for proof, but then ya'll come back again, ya hear?)\n\nBunny Alice is \"married,\" but shares a big secret with her \"husband.\"\n\nAdd saucy Pearl (Jenifer Lewis) as the club seamstress and garnish with Hef, who will only be heard and occasionally seen from the back, according to the producers.\n\nAt an earlier interview session during the Television Critics Association \"press tour,\" all concerned swore that Playboy Club is primarily a case study in the \"empowerment\" of young women who had few chances to better themselves in those times. Mock Hef sells this laughable notion near the end of Monday's premiere, saying of his bunnies: \"Nobody ever knew their last names. It was the early '60s, and the bunnies were some of the only women in the world who could be anyone they wanted to be.\"\n\n\"So, c'mon in,\" he beckons. \"You can be anyone you want to be. But like it says on the door, if you don't swing, don't bring.\"\n\nThat said, it's tempting to grade on the curves when it comes to The Playboy Club. Subtract its clunky dialogue, ludicrous plot devices and empowerment nonsense, and you're left with its heightened sense of pulchritude. Which may be more than enough of a drawing card. Because when she's in costume, \"you can bounce a dime off her ass,\" club manager Billy says approvingly of Maureen.\n\nA penny for your thoughts.\n\nGRADE (on a curve): C\n\nNew fall season: CBS' greasy spooned 2 Broke Girls has a potential breakout star but a lousy joke menu\n\nBeth Behrs, Kat Dennings of CBS' 2 Broke Girls. Photo: Ed Bark\n\nPremiering: Monday, Sept. 19th at 8:30 p.m. (central) on CBS\n\nStarring: Kat Dennings, Beth Behrs, Matthew Moy, Garrett Morris, Jonathan Kite\n\nProduced by: Michael Patrick King, Whitney Cummings\n\nBy ED BARK\n\nThe newly refurbished Two and a Half Men plus the brand new 2 Broke Girls equals two broad and sex-plicit comedies set to run back-to-back on CBS' Monday night schedule.\n\nThe network has declined to make Ashton Kutcher's Two and a Half Men debut available for review. That leaves critics with the \"retro-hip\" Williamsburg diner to chew on. It's the base of operations for a prototypically saucy waitress named Max (Kat Dennings), whose work and home lives are shaken up by the arrival of destitute Manhattan socialite Caroline (Beth Behrs). She's homeless and penniless after her family's fortune is left for dead by dad's Ponzi scheme and his subsequent arrest.\n\nMax's lippy, back-of-the-hand treatment of customers is immediately established with boob and vagina one-liners in the opening scene. The humor is not exactly rarefied, but Dennings knows how to sling the hash. She's already in full command of this sitcom by the time Behrs' Caroline pops in to replace a fired Russian waitress who left behind a stained and smelly uniform after being caught having loud sex with a cook.\n\n\"I hope that's clam chowder,\" Caroline says in one of the ickier sitcom lines of recent times. She soon learns it's not.\n\nThe waitress uniforms are mustard and ketchup colored while every line is delivered with relish. That includes a truly tasteless crack by the restaurant's geriatric cashier, Earl (played by former Saturday Night Live charter cast member Garrett Morris).\n\n\"That girl is workin' harder than Stephen Hawking trying to put on a pair of cufflinks,\" he crows. As previously posted, co-executive producer Michael Patrick King (Sex and the City) has no intention of cutting it because, well, you know, it's \"edgy.\" Wonder how the openly gay King would feel about a similarly sub-moronic \"fairy\" joke at his expense.\n\n2 Broke Girls also includes the diner's new Asian owner, Han Lee (Matthew Moy), who speaks broken English and hopes to Americanize himself by changing his name to Bryce Lee. And although she's portrayed as thoroughly street smart, Max nonetheless has fallen for a muscle-headed, live-in boyfriend named Robbie (Noah Mills), who specializes in flaunting both his abs and his butt crack before being further exposed by Caroline.\n\nMeanwhile, Max somehow finds time to bake and sell luscious cupcakes on the side, and has a second job as nanny to a dim bulb diva whose babies are named Brad and Angelina. In the end, Caroline persuades her new friend to dream big and start raising the $250,000 they'll need to open their own bakery. Judging from a printed kicker at the end, their sum total toward that goal will be updated each week.\n\nI liked this first episode better the first time around. Upon further review, its excesses and kitchen sink humor aren't wearing as well. Dennings may well be a TV star in the making, though. And 2 Broke Girls stands a good chance of surviving in a comfy slot between Two and a Half Men and Hawaii Five-O.\n\nReally, though, improve the joke menu. At least just a little.\n\nGRADE: C\n\nNew fall season: Witches brew hoo hooey in CW's The Secret Circle\n\nBritt Robertson doesn't know which way is witch.
