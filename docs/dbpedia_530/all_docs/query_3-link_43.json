Some say we're a little on the wild side but no one can dispute our CHARGER SPIRIT!! As we take ou seperate journeys we will always remember the good times, th bad times, the fun times, the out of control times, and the special times. Each of us have been blessed with the classmate we see each morning and say \\\"see ya\\\" to each afternoon. In te1 years when we meet again, we will learn what became of each other. From now until then, let's do whatever makes us happy let's fulfill whatever dreams we have and let's promise never !1 forget OUR Heritage Hall Class of Nineteen Hundred and Ninety-Four!

Heritage Hall Juniors are cho en to become the STAR Peer Leaders. Such wa thecae for thi chool year. Eighteen outstanding student from the Class of 1994 were picked from all the applicants. Their duties as Peer Leader are numerou . They must lead an assigned group of incoming freshman, participate in a leadership course, and set the example for other Heritage Hall stu- dents. The most memorable adventure of the Peer Leaders is the Outward Bound Course. This is a high-adventure trek which consists of 8 days of hiking and living in the mountains of Colorado. The course's goals are to promote teamwork, self-confidence, and cooperation. \\\"It was hell while we were there, but thinking back, I loved it!\\\" commented Peer Leader Jenny Townley. All the lessons and skills that the Peer Leaders learn and devlope at Outward Bound are nece sary tool to being a ucce ful Star Peer Leader. Rob Neville fIll) 94\n\nP:99\n\nCommunity Servers Although it is required to complete a minimum of 32 hours of community service for each chool year , Heritage Hall students are eager to volunteer their services to help other . Charger tudents participate in many local events pon ered by non-profit organizations. For example, HH students have worked for the Habitat for Humanity orginization by making brick that are needed to build houses. The Chargers al o participated in the Harvest II Food Drive and held their annual Christmas party for the pre- chool students of Eugene Field again this year. Besides working in large group activi- tie for their service hours, many of the tu- dent of Heritage Hall also volunteer individu- ally at places uch as retirement homes, home- less helter , churches, and hospitals . The time spent volunteering by the high school students of Heritage Hall ets a good example for younger Charger . This allows them to appreci- ate what they have, and gives them a good feeling that they have helped people in need without asking for anything in return. Rob eville Lee Welker make bricks for Habitat for Humanity.

With thi respect and their goals set high, the Chargers Chandler 25-7 planned on a great football eason, and a great football ea on it was. One of the most Casady 38-21 explosive offen es in Heritage Hall history is what the 1993 Chargers had. With a tough Fairview 17-13 offense to stop and a dominating defense, which posted two shut-outs, the Chargers Deer Creek 35-0 were a tough team to beat. With a regular sea on record of eight wins and three losses Piedmont 31-0 and a playoff record of one win and one los , the Chargers were pretty pleased. Coach Chisolm 3-35 Allen thought the '93 Chargers developed into a great team, composed of talent and Watonga 14-22 great atritudes.
