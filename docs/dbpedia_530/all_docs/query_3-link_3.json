        "text": "I was recently contacted by historian Ed O’Riordan, who a number of years ago saved a remarkable series of letters sent home to Tipperary by an Irish emigrant in America, William Hickey. The letters chart the story of a young man who experienced the loneliness and uncertainty of life in a new country and his search for a place to settle down. That journey seemed fulfilled eight-years after his arrival, when William arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana. It would ultimately draw to a close near a small Tennessee Church, at a place called Shiloh.\n\nIn 1853 sixteen-year-old William Hickey left his home in Lisfuncheon, Clogheen, Co. Tipperary for the last time. Travelling first to Liverpool, he boarded a vessel (most probably the Vanguara) which brought him to New York that September. It was at Yarmouth Port in Massachusetts that he wrote his first letter home, on 3rd October:\n\nDear Father and Mother,\n\nI take the opportunity in writing to you these few lines, hoping to find ye all in good health as this leaves me at present thanks be to God for it. Dear Mother I landed in New York on the 19 September, and since the day I left Liverpool I did not get one hours sickness…Dear brother keep your hilt [health] but I am not sorry for coming and I will have better news to send you in my next letter. (1)\n\nHowever, despite William’s optimism it seems he struggled in his early days in the United States. He wrote home again from Boston in January of 1854, in a letter which suggests he was having trouble getting work and wanted to return home to Ireland. It also highlights how important it was for emigrants from a particular locality in Ireland to maintain contact in the United States after they arrived:\n\nDear Father and Mother,\n\nI have to inform you that I received your kind note on the 20th which gave me the greatest pleasure in reading it. and also grieved me very much in your disappointment to me and if you had to send that money in your last letter I would be ready to sail on the 25[th] of this month to old Ireland once more. I have lost in some measure my time and credit, thereby yet my future diligence, I hope to recover both and to convince you that I will pay a strict regard to all your commands which I am bound to do. Dear Father and Mother I submit and give in that I was wrong in my down [doing] so to put you to that trouble but I hope it’s all for the better…This is the only season of the year to go home to Ireland. I can get a passage here in Boston for 12 dollars, when you can’t get in Liverpool for 20 dollars, and as quick as I receive your next letter I will write home the day before sailing, and when I get to Liverpool I will write likewise to you…Dear Father I am in Boston since September, boarding with Michael Keating with the exception of a few weeks. I met with [a] little accidence [accident]. I was to work on board the ship and got my two toes jammed and one almost cut off, but thanks be to god it’s all well now. You must excuse Michael Keating for not sending home some relief to his mother at present, in regard of the summer being bad and winter being likewise, and everything so dear, and he could not afford to send her some relief at present, but still he is not forgetting her, and he is still in the idea of sending for Wm. Keating his brother, and he was much pleased in hearing from all the family. Mick did not hear from Thos. for the last six months, in good health. (2)\n\nDespite this correspondence, William did not return to Lisfuncheon. Instead over the next few months he decided that his future lay out west, in California. In his next letter of June 1854 he related his desire to move on, and also told of the successful arrival of more familiar Tipperary locals in Boston. He also revealed a heart-breaking story of one Irish family’s loss on their passage to America:\n\nMy dear Father,\n\nI have to inform you that I am in perfect good health as I hope this will find you and my ever dear Mother, brother Thomas, James and my sister Bridget also. My dear father I am not being possess[ed] of as much as take me to go to California which place I am inclined to go with many others which are determined for the same Country where there is the greatest encouragement for young men if I had as much money as would pay my expenses. Dear Father it would take 8 weeks to take me there which would cost me 20 pounds which would take a long time to earn it here, everything is so dear and all commodities high through means of the Eastern War [Crimean War]. My dear Father and Mother I am much inclined for it. If you would take me into your kind consideration and remit as much money as would take me there. Therefore I will say no more on the subject but leave all to yourselves. So if you comply with my request I will kindly receive it with many thanks, Etc.\n\nMy dear Father and Mother I met with Wm. Starkey & family on board the Ship, Meridian at their arrival in Boston immediately at the dock in good health, after a voyage of 29 days without an hours sickness during the voyage. [62 year-old William Starkey had arrived on May 31st 1854 from Liverpool together with Alice (43) and children Richard (11), Peter (7) and Alice (9)]. At same time they have delivered the parcel you sent by them to me. You would not believe how well Wm. Starkey looks after his travels which I am happy to have to inform of. The same evening he arrived he was not two hours here when a Captain of another ship came into John Kelly’s where he stopped ordered on board for Chatham [Chatham, Massachusetts], at which time he and family started without taking the least nourishment but some gin and wine we took with Sister Norry, who kindly treated us. He then went on board and was driven back into Boston on the next morning…\n\n…Dear Father we had Tom Russell with Wm. Starkey on board the same ship in good health. Not a single person died on board but one woman who was wife to John Bourke from Tubrid who went to bed with her husband the first night we went on board in Liverpool and was corpse the next morning at 4 o’clock, and left two young children to deplore her loss. He got only two hours to get her away on his back and have her interred. We lost no other person during the whole voyage. [William is here most likely referring to 30-year-old Michael Bourke, who sailed on the Meridian with Mary (9) and Oliver (1)]. We lost no other person during the whole voyage. Wm. Starkey had the title of being Mayor of the ship. My dear Father and Mother I have spent 6 months at the boot and shoe-making, which business is now rather dull here. I have brought Wm. Starkey to Aunt Norry, and Mickey Keatings and received him most kindly.\n\nDear Father, California is the West Country. Wm. Starkey says that I am much taller and stouter than my brother Thos. he joined me in love to you all, my mother, Thos., James and sister Bridget, and other inquiring friends, with many ardent wishes of your future prosperity. From your affection son etc.,\n\nWm. Hickey. (3)\n\nWilliam was clearly not sure what he really wanted to do. He had initially expressed a desire to return to Ireland, then changed his mind and set his sights on California. In the end he did neither. His next letter was dated 8th October 1854 when he was working at ‘Sheepscut Bridge’, most likely Sheepscot Bridge in Maine. Clearly lonely and missing Irish company, his attention was turning to a new potential destination- St. Louis, Missouri:\n\nDear Father and Mother, Brothers and Sister,\n\nI take the opportunity in writing these few lines to you hoping to find you all in good health, as this leaves me, thanks be to God for it. Dear Mother and Father I have to inform you that I am here in this wilde country alone 200 miles from all friends in America. I was sure that any part I go to, but I would meet Irish, but here where I am now, there is none, but I could do no better and I should come here. I am in the wilde woods of America away from priests and chapel, and if I had as much money as would fetch me to St. Louis, I should have gone there before now, for I am sure it was there that the Ryans would get me a trade. I beg and request of you dear father and mother to send me the sum of six pounds, to as much as that would fetch me to St. Louis, and that’s all that ever I will ask of you, ’till I return you three times the compliment. I never had that cause to make money in this country, only as much as would keep me in clothing. I shed three tears from my eyes in this letter for you, thinking of you and being so lonesome here that I have no one that I would spare a word to but savage Yankees; some of them who [would] sooner see the divel than a Irishman. Michael Keating and his wife is in good health, and Aunt Norry and family likewise…\n\n…Please go to Michael Ryan and he will leave you have the directions of his brother in St. Louis, and send it to me in your next letter. If I get a letter from you I will be in St. Louis before Christmas day, and I will have as much thin [then] as will buy me some clothes, and I can go there respectable. I am here working like a horse from four in the morning till ten at night before I can go to bed, and if I don’t get some supply from you dear Father and Mother, I will be perished going in the woods in the winter time cutting down wood, where there would be six foot of snow; in places fourteen foot of snow. (4)\n\nWilliam presumably received the money he requested from his father and moved to Missouri. However it seems he may have long harboured a desire to return to Ireland. His aunt Ellen Tobin indicated this in a letter to her brother and William’s uncle in Lisfuncheon, Father James Hickey, as late as 1859. Writing from Ware in Massachusetts she asks ‘if William Hickey went home yet.’ William did move on from Missouri but it was not to return home. A letter from March 1861 finds him in New Orleans, Louisiana:\n\nEver honoured Father and mother, brother and sister. I prefer addressing you these few lines not only to let you know that I am in health, but to present my humble duties and good wishes towards you. Ever wishing you an abundance of felicity and health, wealth and many prosperous days with the like duty and respect and the same good wishes to those that are near and dear to you. Inform you that I am employed in a very respectable Establishment. It is a new shoe factory. I get two dollars per day and very easy clean work. I enjoy the best of health and hope you do the same. You may rest assured that you are all fresh in my memory although not writing to you this many a day, for which I hope you will excuse me. I am sorry to hear of the death of my Venerable Uncle. I was told he died by a young girl of the O’Briens from Shandrahan. May God have mercy on his soul, amen.\n\nPlease write at the receipt of this, and let me know how is every member of the family, and all enquiring friends. Direct your letter to William Hickey, New Orleans, Louisiana. (6)\n\nBy the time William had written his letter Louisiana had already seceded from the Union. With the firing on Fort Sumter on 12th April 1861 and the outbreak of war, the Tipperary man decided to enlist. On 15th April the then 24-year-old joined up, mustering in to Company G of the 1st Louisiana Infantry Regiment (Strawbridge’s) on the 30th April. He clearly had leadership qualities, as he quickly became a Sergeant. William originally signed up to serve for one year. The beginning of 1862 found him and his regiment serving at Pensacola, Florida. It was here that William agreed to extend his time in the army to two years, making him eligible for a bounty of $50 that was to be paid on 15th April 1862. The early months of 1862 saw a major buildup of Union and Confederate forces in and around Tennessee, and the 1st Louisiana soon found themselves on the move to link up with the main army in the Western Theater. On 6th April 1862 the young man from Lisfuncheon and the Confederate Army of Mississippi advanced to the attack near Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. The carnage that ensued across the 6th and 7th April was on a scale never before seen in American history. It became known as the Battle of Shiloh. (7)\n\nThe 1st Louisiana and the Confederate army had started their advance early on the morning of the 6th April. William and his comrades struggled forward through difficult wooded terrain and across a stream before they could move up a slight slope towards the first enemy line. They encountered their first taste of major battle at 8.30am, near the Union camps of General Prentiss. As they advanced to within 200 yards of the enemy the Louisianans took heavy fire from the Yankee line, which was supported by artillery and sharpshooters firing from the trees. As the engagement intensified the Rebel brigade commander, Brigadier-General Adley Gladden, was mortally wounded when a cannonball mangled his left arm and shoulder. With the men wavering, Colonel Daniel Adams of the 1st Louisiana (now acting as brigade commander) grasped the flag of his regiment and called on the men to follow him. They did. William and his fellow Rebels charged forward, driving the Union line back through their camp. The Lisfuncheon man had made it through the first encounter of the day. (8)\n\nDespite their early success, there was a long day ahead for the 1st Louisiana Infantry. They eventually reformed on the other side of the captured Union camp, and had to endure artillery fire from nearby guns which were eventually silenced by Confederate fire. Eventually they were ordered forward once more, with the brigade soon losing another commander- Colonel Adams was wounded in the head by a bullet at around 2.30pm. As they drove forward to attack the next organised group of Federals, sometime around 4pm, Sergeant William Hickey was struck in the head and killed. He was one of 232 casualties sustained by the 1st Louisiana over the two days fighting at Shiloh. The young man’s fate was outlined in an 1866 letter written by David Ryan of St. Louis (the same Ryan cousins William had sought out in 1854) to his cousin and William’s uncle, Father James Hickey:\n\nYour nephew William Hickey was a brave-hearted young man, well liked by everyone in St. Louis, and at the breaking out of the war he went to New Orleans where he joined the Confederate Army and was killed at the Battle of Shiloh holding the rank of Lieutenant [it is possible William was acting as a Lieutenant at the time of his death] and was acknowledged to be a brave intrepid commander. (9)\n\nThe man who had left home at the age of sixteen to travel to the United States had come to grief on a Tennessee battlefield at the age of only 25. His letters chart the story of a young boy in search of a better life- a boy who clearly had itchy feet, always looking towards the next place to live, the next opportunity. His journeying around America eventually took him to New Orleans, and ultimately the Confederate army. One can imagine the impact news of his death had at home in Lisfuncheon when it came. The Battle of Shiloh, and the American Civil War as a whole, cast a dark shadow that was often felt half a world away.\n\n* I am greatly indebted to Ed O’Riordan who located these letters, which offer a remarkable insight into emigrant life. He also provided me with the transcripts of the letters for use in this post, for which I am most grateful. Thanks are also due to the Hickey family of Lisfuncheon, Clogheen for permission to tell William’s story.\n\n(1) New York Passenger Lists, William Hickey to Parents October 3rd 1853; (2) William Hickey to Parents January 22nd 1854 (erroneously dated 1853); (3) William Hickey to Parents June 1st 1854, Boston Passenger and Crew Lists; (4) William Hickey to Parents October 8th 1854; (5) Ellen Tobin to Father James Hickey February 27th 1859; (6) William Hickey to Family March 4th 1861; (7) William Hickey Confederate Service Record; (8) OR: 536-537, Daniels 1997: 154; (9) OR: 536-537, OR: 538, Daniels 1997: 313, David Ryan to Father James Hickey July 10th 1866;\n\nReferences & Further Reading\n\nWilliam Hickey Letters.\n\nBoston Passenger and Crew Lists, 1820-1943.

Filled with fascinating social information, they often also contain primary sources from 1861-1865- such as wartime letters- that have lain unread for over a century. Many thousands of these files relate to Irish people, and contain important details about life in Ireland and among Irish emigrants in the middle of the 19th century. The importance of these files as a historic resource remains unrecognised in Ireland, which is unfortunate given that many Irish records from this period were destroyed during the Irish Civil War. The letters below relate to one such remarkable pension record. Contained within Navy Dependent File 2867 are three poignant letters from Second Class Fireman Patrick Finan of Sligo town, written to his father from the decks of USS Wabash. Transcribed here for the first time, they have much to teach us about emigration, community, life on the Union blockade, loss and loneliness. They are well worth taking the time to read.\n\nPatrick Finan first enlisted in the Union Navy in New York on 29th April 1861, signing on as a Coal Heaver. His place of birth was incorrectly inputted as Brooklyn. He was 23-years-old and was recorded as having no profession. Patrick was 5 feet 6 1/2 inches tall with blue eyes, light hair and a light complexion. This is his physical description- to gain an insight into his character and emotions, read on. (1)\n\nHilton Head, Port Royal S.C.\n\nOctober the 23th [sic.], 1862\n\nDear Father,\n\nI take the liberty of writing these few lines to you hoping to find you brother and sister in good health as this leaves me in at present thanks be to God for it.\n\nDear Father you must excuse me for not answering your letter sooner than this but I was waiting for the ship to go to New York until I would send you all particulars, but when the time came to go home I was disappointed, for in place of going to New York we were sent to Philadelphia and we received one weeks liberty on shore. I was thinking of going to New York from there but I changed my mind for I thought I might as well spend my time there as in New York. So you may think what a week I spent after being fifteen months at sea but I got sick of it at the latter end and I was glad to get on board the ship again, but we only remained fifteen days in Philadelphia until we left for Port Royal on the first of August again and to make my liberty better I got sick on the passage out and I had to go into hospital on board the ship for two months before I got better, but I am quite well again and at my duty. Dear Father we expect to make an attack on Charleston very soon for we are to have a fleet of iron clad vessels as soon as our Admiral comes back, for they would sink all the wooden vessels that ever was built but our ship is too large to get in close on the Bar but I hope it is all for the better, for I don’t want to be under the fire of them guns that is on them Forts but our iron clad vessels can stand anything so I think our vessel will have to remain outside the Bar and look on at the sport and I hope we will come out victorious.\n\nDear Father I have not heard one word from Patt Keen since he came out here or from Bartly Burns or the wife, but I expected Patt Keen would write and let me know how he was getting on but out of sight out of mind with them all, for they knew very well where to write to me, but I hope I will live to return them the compliment they have shown me since I left New York, but a stranger will think more of you here than your one friend. Well Dear Father I received a letter from one of Mrs. Short’s sons that lived in Manchester and he is in the Navy about the same time as myself, his mother and brothers and sisters is living in Fall River where James Tindell was living, and he told me that Michael Flanigan [en]listed in the Irish Brigade under General Francis Magher, eight thousand strong, and he went into the battle that was at Richmond about a month ago and all the men he brought out alive was five hundred, so I suppose Michael Flanigan was killed in that battle.*\n\nDear Father you must excuse me for not having something to send to you in this letter but you may expect it in the next, I will send to you in January next so try and do the best you can until then, for there is no money to be got in this ship at the present time. Dear Father you will make it your business to see Mr. Coggans and ask him if he has heard anything from his son Michael, for I was told by a prisoner we got on board our ship that come from Charleston and he told me he knew Michael Coggans, and that he got married and shortly after he [en]listed in Charleston and is now stationed in James Island the very place we are going to make an attack on, and give my respects to him and his daughter Margaret.** Dear Father if I remain twelve months more in the navy you may expect me home for a few months as soon as I get paid off, for I never can let home out of my mind I am always thinking of home, I don’t know the reason of it for when I was in England I never used to think half so much of home as I do now, but I am not the same since my Mother died. I feel very lonely and down hearted.\n\nDear Father you will be kind enough to tell John Gannon not to be uneasy a [small portion of letter missing] Michael has the [small portion of letter missing] present time for they are pressing men to [en]list all over the States but as soon as Rebellion is over we will have a good country here again and I expect this winter will finish it all. Give my love to my brother Michael and wife and child, and my sister Mary Ann, and to Martin Conlin wife and family, and tell little Patt Conlon I will bring him home a suit of Man O’ War clothes and make a regular Jack Tar of him. Give my love to Johnney Mulrouney wife and family and to my [sic.] daughter Anney and Patt Kerins and children and John Mulrouney wife and family, Dan Riley and family and to Mrs Rees? and to Thomas Mulrouney and James Hennesy, and give my love to the two Miss Mullins, father and mother and to all loving friends and neighbours and to my aunt Peggy, and [I] was very near forgetting her. So I bid you all goodbye for the present but I remain your truly son Patrick Finan, until death.\n\nWhen you receive this letter write by the return of post and let me know how you are getting on and how Michael is doing.*** (2)\n\nHilton Head\n\nPort Royal S.C.\n\nJanuary the 25th 1863\n\nDear Father,\n\nI take the liberty of addressing these few lines to you to inform you that I received your kind and welcome letter on the 20th, and I am happy to hear that you are all in good health as this leaves me in at present thanks be to God for it. Dear Father I am sorry to inform you that it is impossible for me to send you the money home or I should feel very happy in doing so, for the money we get here that it is no use out of the country, for every pound in gold I would get here to send you I would have to pay two dollars discount on it so you see now how much it would take to send as much as would bring you all out here. Dear Father I am willing to pay your three passages in [to] New York, yours Mary Ann and Johnsey Mullrooney if you are willing for me to do so, for I don’t know any other way in bringing you out here at the present time. I have the money on hand these three months and could not get no way of sending it to you. Dear Father when you receive this letter write as much as possible and let me know what you intend to do and tell Johnney Mullroony that if he is willing to come out here I will pay his passage along with yours, that is if his wife is willing to let him come here, but on no other condition. I would like to bring him out here.\n\nFather it grieves me to say that it was the first? in the January? to make a settlement on it, and when you and Mary Ann leaves we will be well divided, and if Michael had taken my advice when I was leaving Liverpool I would have him out here long ago but he has taken his own or else yours and let him abide by it, for I am sure he was time enough to get married these five years to come. Let me know how you stand, that is to say if you have got as much money as will bring you as far as Liverpool, and if not let me know in your letter and the sum you think will do you, and I will send it to you, I don’t care how much I have to pay for sending it for I don’t want you to be in debt to any man leaving Sligo, and for my part I am willing to do all that ever a son can do for you and more perhaps than them you thought more of. But at the same time it is no more than anybody to a Father and all I am waiting for now is the answer of this letter and if you are willing to come that way let me know and I will pay yours, Mary Ann and Johnney Mullrooneys passage as quick as possible. Dear Father I intended to go to Sligo when I got paid off but all my hopes is blasted for the future of ever seeing Sligo again? [portion of letter blotted out] When you come out and I hope your uncle Daniel? [portion of letter blotted out] will be along with you and Mrs. Keen and children [portion of letter blotted out] is one that lies cold in the clay that I would give all the world she was alive to be with you until I would see her face again but alas that day will never come in this world, and may the Lord have mercy on her soul, Amen. [It seems likely that Patrick is here referring to his mother].\n\nDear Father I have not received a letter from Brooklyn this twelve months, and I can’t say how Bartly Burns and the family is getting along for like all the rest of them that is here he soon forgot me. But I hope I will live to return to New York to pay them back with the same coin, and I was greatly surprised when I herd Thomas Mullroony was married, but I suppose he took a foolish notion like all the rest of the Sligo boys. Let me know what young woman he got married to, Sligo can’t be so bad when the young boys can support wives, and as for this country the widows and girls are going mad for men and can’t get them, for the war has all the young men in the country away and any young man that comes home safe out of the war the young girls will be giving any amount of money to get a man, and plenty of money they have got. [It] is now is the time for the young men of Sligo to come to this country, any of them that is able, for this will be a fine country when this war is over and as it is I hear they can’t get men enough to do the work for them in New York. There is very few men in the citys at all but what is a way in the army and navy. Dear Father there is nothing thought of a man here if he is not either in the army and navy fighting for his country. I have received a few letters from Patt Short since I come in the navy he is living in Fall River and his mother and brother and sisters sends their love to you and they wish to see you out here. Tell Johnney Michael Flanigan is still a prisoner in Richmond.\n\nDear Father I intend to be in a hot battle very soon, I expected it sooner than this but the weather kept the vessels from coming down here but the most of them arrived here this week, and we expect the rest of them here soon, all iron clads vessels and we expect to make and attack on Charleston, [in] the next month and I hope that will be our last. Dear Father give my love to my sister and brother, [his] wife and child and to my aunt Mary and family and Thomas Mullroony and wife, John Mulrooney and family, Patrick Kearns and family, Patrick Flynn and family, Patt Hughes and family and my Godfather Johnney Mulrooney and family, Michael O’Hara and family, Patrick Feenney and family, Dan Riley and family, Mrs Phur? and children and my aunt Peggy and give my compliments to John Muligan and wife, give my love to James and Patt Kerns and to John and Edward, wife and sister, and all my old comrade boys of Sligo and not forgetting the young girls [portion illegible] and [portion illegible]…Captain Steward and [portion illegible]… old sailors of the Shamrock**** and give my love to Francis? Duffy and Edward Moran, and all inquiring friend and neighbours home at present, but I remain yours truly Patrick Finan and I bid you all goodbye and old Sligo for now and ever more,\n\nYours Respectfully, Patrick Finan\n\nSend your letter for Patrick Finan U.S. Navy Ship Wabash Port Royal S.C. New York America and send me Mary Ann’s age.*****(3)\n\nPort Royal S.C.\n\nJune the 24th 1863\n\nFather I take the liberty of writing these few lines to you hoping to find you in good health as this leaves me in at present thanks be to God for it.\n\nDear Father I received your kind and welcome letter on the 20th and I am very happy to hear that you are enjoying good health and I am also very sorry to hear that Johnney Mulrooney is lying very bad, but I hope he will soon recover his health again and be able to come to see me in the land of liberty. Dear Father I am surprised at you for to sell all your things in such a hurry before you received your passage ticket, for I am sure you would have time enough to sell them after you received the order, and on the other hand you wanted me to pay your passage on a steamer but the passage is too high, it is 32 dollars in gold and 48 dollars in the U.S. currency, so you must know how much it would be to bring you out on a steamer and to send you money home also, for I know you can’t come out without sending you some money home and I think it would be very good on my part to be able to bring you out on a sailing ship, the same way as I come myself, not that I would think it too much to bring you out on a steamer, but for the way times is here at present that if a man wants a dollar in gold he has to pay one dollar and a half before he can get it, and that is what is keeping you in Sligo so long, for I think it very hard to lose so much money for nothing for it is my intention to save all the money I can while I am in the service, that I can be able to start you in business as soon as you come here. Dear Father it would take very near forty pounds to bring you and Mary Ann out at the present time so with the blessing of God remain where you are until the times takes a turn here for the better, and I hope that won’t be long and I think you can’t starve in Sligo as bad as you say it is.\n\nDear Father I wonder how the young men of Sligo that is coming out here will like to be drafted as soon as they land for they have passed a law here to draft all the young and married men from 25 to 45 years of age after they are thirty days in this country, or else they will have to leave the country again and I am very glad of it for there is a lot of young fellows around New York that won’t fight for their country and they ought to be made fight or else clear out. But I wish to God it was for the freedom of Ireland I was fighting for in the place of what we are fighting for. Dear Father I wrote to Patt Short in Fall River to let me know of the first chance he can see that I can send for you, and I am very much surprised at you for not sending some account of John Gannon in your letter to his brother Michael for he was waiting to hear from him in your letter and he was greatly disappointed when he heard his name was not mentioned, and I felt ashamed myself when you did not send some news about him for I am sure you had plenty of place [space] in your letter. Dear Father I have ten months more to serve before my time is up but that won’t be long passing, we are expecting our ships to go home very soon we are waiting for a ship to relive us and as soon as she comes we start for home. Dear Father you have liberty to do as you wish with the pictures when you get them but be sure and give Mrs. Flynn her pictures and tell her to receive them as a favour from me for her kindness to my mother, but you could not expect to receive them as quick as the letter for there will be a delay on them before you receive them. Dear Father tell Mary Finan I received her brothers likeness last week in a letter and I [am] going to send him my likeness this week. I receive a letter from him every week and he is getting along very well.\n\nDear Father we are making up a great deal of money in this country for the Poor of Ireland and on board our ships we made up near twelve hundred dollars on board this ship, you can see it in the last two papers I sent you [for more on these fund raising efforts in 1863 see a previous post by clicking here]. And I had to laugh the other day when I read in the papers about Patrick Davey getting eleven sheep killed on him with some of your mad dogs and about Patrick Kearns in Pound Street turning bankrupt, there is not a thing done in Sligo but I hear of it in one of your Irish papers. Dear Father cheer up and make out the best way you can until such times as I can bring you out, I am sure you would not know me if you seen me for my hair is getting grey. I am greatly changed since you last seen me, this is the country to take the blush off your cheeks. Dear Father when you write again you need not put yourself to the expense of paying the postage for I can pay for it here better than you can, let me know in your next letter if you received the pictures all right for I feel uneasy until they go to hand, be sure and let me know how Johnny Mulroony is getting along for I feel uneasy for fear anything would happen to him.\n\nDear Father give my respects to Patrick Flannery wife and family and tell him I feel very thankful to him for his kindness towards you, give my compliments to Patt Flynn wife and family and to Patt Feeney wife and family and give my love to my sister and brother, [his] wife and child, give my love to my uncle Johnney wife and family and to my aunt Mary and Martin Conlon and family and my aunt Peggey give my respects to John Mulrooney wife and family, Patrick Kearns and family, Dan Riley wife and family and to Mrs Keen and tell her I never heard one word from Patt since he landed, give my love to James Hennesy and James Mulroony and to Bridget Mulroony. Give my respects to Michael O’Hara wife and family and to Patt his wife and family and to my good Father.\n\nNo more at present but I remain your most respectfully Patrick Finan. Good Bye.\n\nDirect your letter as before: Mr. Patrick Finan U.S. Flag Ship Wabash Port Royal S.C. America (4)\n\nJust a few months after this letter was written Patrick Finan was dead. On the 21st March 1864 the 27-year-old Sligo man, who was serving as a Second Class Fireman, was examining water-cocks beneath the boilers of the USS Wabash which was still stationed off Port Royal, South Carolina. An accidental discharge of hot water from the boilers caught Patrick and severely scalded him on the body and limbs. During the first days after his horrific injury it seemed like he might pull through, but on the night of 5th April an effusion of the brain occurred, and he died on the night of 6th April. It is because of Patrick’s death that his remarkable letters survive. Years later his now incapacitated father John, who had never made it to a new life in the United States, sought a pension in Sligo based on his son’s service. He had to prove that his son had helped to support him when he was alive, so he included these three letters of Patrick’s as they refer to his son helping him financially. 65-year-old John prepared an affidavit to accompany his claim on 12th May 1880, giving his post office address as West Garden Lane, Sligo, Ireland and outlining his sad circumstances:\n\nI John Finan say I am a working butcher by trade but am now prevented by infirmity and ill health from earning my support by labouring at my trade. I was married in the month of July 1835 to Bridget Mulrooney but the Roman Catholic Register of the Parish of Sligo has been mislaid and I am unable to produce the certificate of my marriage. I say I had 7 children, but all are dead save two, one daughter living in the United States, of whom I have not heard for 5 years last past and one son in Australia, of whom I have not heard for the last 10 years- my son Patrick Finan was my eldest child and he left Ireland about the year 1859, and after residing some years in United States enlisted in the Navy of the United States and died on board the United States ship the Wabash until the year 1864 having been scalded to death by an accidental escape of steam- my said son Patrick Finan previous to his enlisting in said navy constantly remitted to me sums of money for my support, and I received from him in the year previous to his enlisting ten pounds sterling for my support, but in consequence of his being out at sea whilst on board the Wabash he was unable to remit money at regular or fixed times. I refer to his letter marked A dated 23d January 1863 and the letter marked B dated 24th June 1863, stating he had money for me, but was unable to remit same. My said son Patk. Finan whilst he lived afforded me my only means of support and was the only person on whom I could rely for support. From his death to the present time I have had no other means of support, than the sum of £90 the arrears of his pay and a subscription raised for me, which fund is now exhausted and which was remitted to me. I say I am incapacitated from work and am now trusting to the charity of my friends and neighbours for my support. I say my wife Bridget Mulrooney died 21 years ago and I remained since her death unmarried- I say my said son Patrick Finan never married. (5)\n\nJohn Finan received a pension for the service of his son. The former butcher passed away in West Garden Lane on 20th December 1890- he had married again, as his widow Sarah was recorded as being present at his death. Despite his age being given as 65 in 1880, it was recorded as only 66 in 1890, a differential that is not unusual when dealing with 19th century records. (6)\n\nThese letters are extremely revealing regarding emigration and community in 19th century Ireland. It is also of interest to note just how many of the people in Sligo town had family who emigrated; included amongst Patrick’s circle were at least two others who fought in the Civil War, one in the Irish Brigade and one for the Confederacy- the latter of whom, Michael Coggins, seems to have literally been facing his former friend in the battle for Charleston (see notes below). Letters such as these open up a window on the strong ties between Ireland and the United States in the 1860s and the impact of the American Civil War on Irish people. Sources such as these, and the experiences of men such as Patrick Finan, are worthy of considerably more attention and study here in Ireland than they currently receive.\n\nNotes\n\n*A Michael Flannigan aged 27 years enlisted in the 88th New York Infantry on 3rd March 1862 and was assigned to Company F. He was captured in action at Chancellorsville on 3rd May 1863 and paroled, and transferred to Company A on 12th June 1863. Transferred to the 114th Company of the 1st Battalion, VRC, he was re-transferred to Company A of the 88th New York on 19th February 1864. He re-enlisted as a veteran volunteer on 22nd March 1864 but deserted on 30th May 1864 on the expiration of his veteran furlough. (7)\n\n**Patrick’s information here may be surprisingly accurate. A Michael Coggins served as a Private in Company D of the 3rd Palmetto Battalion, South Carolina Light Artillery. He enlisted aged 23 in Charleston on 14th November 1861. He was sentenced to forfeit two weeks pay by order of court-martial in June 1862 and in July of the same year was listed as absent without leave, sick in the city (Charleston). On 4th October 1862 he was transferred to the Naval service. An ‘M. Coggins’ is recorded as an Ordinary Seaman on the crew of the C.S.S. Chicora for late 1863 and early 1864, and this may be the same man. Chicora was an ironclad ram built in Charleston in 1862- it was volunteers from her crew that became the first to serve on the submarine Hunley.(8)\n\n*** Patrick’s mother was a Mulrooney so it is likely that all those of that name referred to in the letters are family relations.\n\n****It is unclear what vessel the Shamrock was, and if Patrick had served on it in Ireland (it is clear he also spent time in England before his emigration). There were a number of ships of that name operating in 19th century Ireland, more work is required to ascertain if none had particular connections to Sligo.\n\n*****The USS Wabash on which Patrick served for most of the war and on which he died was a steam-screw frigate. She spent most of the Civil War on blockading duty as part of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Members of her crew participated in actions against positions such as Fort Pulaski, Georgia and while in Port Royal a detachment of her crew were captured by a Confederate steamer. She took a number of prizes, including the Wonder on 13th May 1863.\n\nNote re Letter Transcription: Patrick Finan’s letters have been transcribed here to make them as readable as possible. The originals contain extremely varied spelling and no paragraph formatting or punctuation (e.g. ‘the’ is frequently used for ‘they’). As an example here is the passage relating to the draft as it appears in Patrick’s hand:\n\n‘…Dear Father I wonder how the young men of Sligo that is coming out hear will like to bee drafted as soone as the land for the have past a law hear to draft all the young and married men from 25 to 45 years of age after the are thurty days in this country or els the will have to lave the country a gine and I am verrey glad of it for thear is a lot of young fellows a round New York that wont fight for thear country and the ought to Bee made fight or els clear out but I wish to God it was for the freedom of Ireland I was fighting for in the place of what we are fighting for…’\n\nThe original transcriptions do give more of an impression of Patrick’s Irish accent, with many words spelt phonetically.

Antrim. The family would later move to nearby Larne when Malcolm established a nursery there, and it was here that James grew up. In 1857 the young man decided to leave Antrim to try his luck in North America. Arriving first in Canada, he eventually made his home in New York. James would go on to serve as an infantry and cavalry officer in the American Civil War- a conflict which ultimately cost him his life. I was recently contacted by one of his descendants, Louise Brown, who has painstakingly transcribed a series of 18 letters written by and regarding James. They offer a remarkable insight into James’s experiences both before and during the war. With Louise’s permission, over the course of the coming a weeks these letters will be shared with you in their entirety.\n\nWith the coming of the American Civil War in 1861 26-year-old James Fleming was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the 9th New York Volunteers- Hawkins’ Zouaves. After his two-year term of service expired he was mustered out in May 1863, but he did not spend long out of uniform. On 27th July 1863 James became a First Lieutenant and Quartermaster in the 16th New York Cavalry, subsequently being promoted Captain of Company M. He was killed in action at Fairfax Station, Virginia on 8th August 1864, during an engagement with Mosby’s Rangers. (1)\n\nJames Fleming’s demise did not go unnoticed on either side of the Atlantic. New York newspapers, including the New York Irish-American, carried word of his death, as did the Belfast Newsletter. Neither did his family forget him. The family headstone at the now unused Unitarian Meeting House in Antrim Town bears the following inscription:\n\nErected by Malcolm Fleming of Larne\n\nFor Sara Jane who died in America 1835 aged 33 years.\n\nAlso his son James Captain in 16th New York Cavalry who was\n\nKilled at Fairfax by a gang of guerillas 8th Aug 1863\n\nAlso Malcolm Fleming 13th Feb 1869 aged 86 years\n\nAlso wife Ann Jane died 26th Nov 1869 aged 82 years (2)\n\nLater posts will explore James’s war service through the letters he wrote in 1861, 1862 and 1863. This post contains the first letter in the series, written shortly after James arrived in North America. Dated 29th September 1857, he is writing to let his parents know how his voyage went, what life is like in Canada, and to inquire how everyone is at home:\n\nPost Office\n\nToronto September 29th/57\n\nDear Mother\n\nI received your long welcome letter on Saturday last it gives me great pleasure to hear of your all being well as this leaves me quite well at present. You say I gave you no news in my last so I must give you them all this time. When I left Belfast Lough on my outward voyage I felt rather lonely but in a few days I became to like it much better. I assisted the Dr in feeling the old womens pulses and cheering the young ones. My possessions lasted for about 5 weeks there was an old man & his son were in the same place with myself & the young chap cooked for me. I gave away a great deal of my bread to them that I thought required it but Lucky Jim never went hungry to bed for that as I got plenty. The long voyage I need scarce tell you any news concerning it as I could fill a newspaper of my adventures on the voyage but I never had one hours sickness & so I looked after them that was sick. When I got into Quebec I sold Bed & bedding for 6/-. I kept my old Rag a trusty friend I think there were about 6 or 7 nights that it was my Bed & Blanket but that was my own fault. I was counting from Quebec to Toronto – up the canal is most beautiful but indeed I was in no way to enjoy it. I had a very good bed and was very comfortable all the voyage. Sometimes I would have got a tumble out of my birth [sic.] but I had not far to fall as I slept on the bottom birth [sic.]. I am thinking long for such another sail I liked it so well. If I sucede [sic.] here I intend paying Mary Ann a visit in the spring & then my next tour will be to Ould Ireland again the spring following as I am determined on this you will have the satisfaction of seeing me in Larne again. I got a situation in a shop a few days after I arrived but did not get much salary it payed my washing and got me a pair of boots – but I have got a better one in the pantichnetcha [?] same as John Smyth [?]. I have £60 & board but expects to get more after a short time its a sorry place this for young men much worse than Belfast. Canada has not been so dull since it quit sucking or the Christening (I am not sure which) plenty going about doing nothing nor cannot get anything to do of any sort but thank goodness I have had my fill of work since I came here. I am in this place a month its a very comfortable place breakfast at ½ past 7 shop at 8 o’clock get tea fresh meat or eggs, dinner at 1 o’clock tea at 7 shop closes. The grub first rate always 3 or 4 dishes at dinner quite different from home always pies or pudding of some sort or other after dinner. I have a very comfortable bed turns in at 10 o’clock out at 7 aint that good hours never had my health as good. I suppose Alex is quit courting in the Evgs or has he fetched Nancy to the Point yet as Henry says he aught give a chap an invitation if not to the wedding he might to the party in the Evg. If I was there I would give him a hand to beat by Dan yet. I had a paper from Mary Ann that is all as yet she must not have got my letter that I wrote or I would have surely got an answer before this. I am very glad to hear of Thos Luceys as to the increase in his family also his crops doing so well & hopes that Nancy is quite well again. Dear mother you must take better care of yourself for you know that you are not so able to stand the fatigue now as what you were a few years ago. I am glad that my father stands it so well as I suppose he will have the nursery a beautiful place when I come over to see it. You tell me you had a great deal of lightening this summer its myself that sees the lightening one incessant flash for hours its awful in a dark night but we have not much thunder but where it does come it shakes the earth. Fires are very plenty here stunners will burn a whole street before they get it stopped we had a first rate one the other night I had a view of it out of my bedroom window in 3 hours burnt down a whole square of houses. You want to know what sort of churches we have the same as home all sorts there are 2 Unitarians in the city I stroll into some of them sometimes. I am very sorry to hear about Jas Cummings but hopes he will get better. I have not no one that I know from the old Country yet I have not went to see Mr Magee as yet but I heard about him he lives some distance out of the city. I called upon Mrs Renford [?] I dined there a few times she tried to get me into a situation but one must try for themselves when they come to this country. I think I have nothing particular to say we have fine weather at present something like our March weather dry & cold rather warm during midday but cold in the mornings & Evgs, we will have such weather as this to December then frost & snow very severe I believe.\n\nDear mother I hope you will make Henry take care of himself during this winter if he catches a severe cold it will not be well for him but I hope Andy will look to that as he does in times and not let it settle upon him as it done before. I have had a paper from Malcolm I wrote him but hav not got the answer as yet but hopes to get it soon. Dear mother you can give my kind regards to all inquiring friends as if separately mentioned particularly Mrs Rodgers & Mrs Rankin & sister if you see any one ——– long to hear from tell them I will write them in a few days as yours is the first & then comes the rest as I have time. I must finish my bedfellow is just rolled into bed I am writing this in my bedroom after 10 o’clock. I have nothing now particular to say. Kind love to my father & yourself & hopes you will take care & not slave yourself so much. Kind love to Dunady folks tell Sally if you see her she might write me a few lines as I have nothing particular or I would write her. I will be writing Andy in a few days I got his & Henry’s letter at the same time as yours & Alex few lines tell Alex to write me a long letter when he gets his harvest saved and let me have all the news. Farewell for the present from your\n\naffectionate Son\n\nJames.

Note that some punctuation has been added to the letter above for ease of reading. Sincere thanks are due to Louise Brown for sharing these letters with readers of Irish in the American Civil War.\n\n(1) New York Adjutant General; (2) Louise Brown Transcription; (3) Louise Brown Transcription;\n\nReferences\n\nNew York State Adjutant General. Rosters of the 9th New York Infantry and 16th New York Cavalry.\n\nFiled under: Antrim, New York Tagged: 16th New York Cavalry, 9th New York Infantry, Antrim Civil War, Irish American Civil War, Irish Diaspora, Irish emigration, Mosby Rangers, Ulster Scots Civil War\n\nThis is the first in a new series of posts on the site which seeks to tie surviving American Civil War objects to the stories of those people associated with them. Surviving objects from the Civil War era are tangible links to the past- they served as ‘witnesses to history.’ I have long been fascinated by the ability that objects have to guide our hand in uncovering the stories of past peoples, while simultaneously increasing our affinity and sense of connection with those who came into contact with them. Now, thanks to my good friend and Civil War expert Joe Maghe, we have an opportunity to explore some of the remarkable objects from Joe’s collection on the site. This first instalment examines a document which lists a small group of men in Corcoran’s Irish Legion, providing a snaphshot of the 170th New York Infantry in October 1862 and allowing us to ask, what was their fate?\n\nThe document in Joe’s collection is relatively plain- a short list of men across two pages. It is dated October 27th 1862 and relates to men of Company F of the 170th New York. Addressed ‘Camp Seward Virginia’ it introduces itself as follows:\n\nThe following named men being enlisted in Company “F” 170th Regiment N.Y.V. (2nd Corcoran Irish Legion) between the 8th & 18th of September 1862 are entitled to the National War Committee Bounty…\n\nThere follows a simple list of 27 names with the dates of their enlistment. This document is fascinating, as it captures a single moment in time, a single event in these men’s lives. When it was written, in October 1862, the Legion had yet to see major action- all these men were still alive, still new to soldiering. Indeed it seems probable that for at least some of them this bounty and the steady wage the army offered was a major reason for the decision they had taken only a little over a month before. For others on these pages, ideological reasons may have played a part in them donning Union blue. Whatever their original motivations, by October all were now ‘in it together.’\n\nA document such as this offers us the opportunity to examine what became of each of these men- who survived, who deserted, who was maimed or killed in the years to come? Using a combination of the rosters of the 170th New York, the Civil War Veterans Pension Index Cards, a selection of Widow’s Pension Files and Joe’s previous work on the document, I have sought to flesh out some details of their lives in the army, and for a small number of them reveal something of they and their family’s pre and post-war experiences. Each man is listed below in the same order in which they appear on the original document.\n\nDaniel Ahern\n\nThe 42-year-old enlisted on 11th September 1862, mustering in as a Private in Company F. He was captured at the North Anna on 24th May 1864, dying of diarrhoea on 31st July 1864 at Andersonville, Georgia. Daniel’s widow received a pension for his service from 23rd June 1865.\n\nJames Amble (also borne as Ambler)\n\nThe 29-year-old enlisted on 8th September 1862 and became a Private in Company F. He was wounded in action at the Landron House on 18th May 1864 an engagement in which he lost his arm. He was still absent wounded in Central Park Hospital, New York when the regiment mustered out in 1865.\n\nArchie Birdsall (also borne as Archie L. Birdsall)\n\nThe 18-year-old enlisted on 18th September 1862, becoming a Private in Company F. He deserted on 1 November 1862 at Camp Seward, Arlington Flats, Virginia.\n\nJohn Burnett\n\nThe 43-year-old enlisted on 18th September 1862 and became a Private in Company F. When he was mustered out on 17th July 1865 he was in hospital in Alexandria, Virginia. John received an invalid pension based on his service from 22nd May 1876 and following his death a pension for a minor child was also claimed.\n\nThomas Dean Challen\n\nThe 23-year-old enlisted on 15th September 1862. Initially a Private in Company F, he was promoted to hospital steward on 24th April 1864, and mustered out with the regiment near Munson’s Hill, Virginia on 15th July 1865.\n\nJohn Crain (also borne as Crane, Croin and Crean)\n\nThe 19-year-old enlisted on 16th September 1862. A Private in Company F, he was wounded on 24th October 1864, but recovered to be mustered out with his company near Washington D.C. on 15th July 1865.\n\nEdward Craely (also born as Crealey, Crawlet, Creally and Crawley)\n\nThe 42-year-old enlisted on 13th August 1862. He served as a Private in Company F. When he mustered out on 27th July 1865 he was in Armory Square Hospital, Washington D.C. He sought an invalid pension based on his service on 4th March 1871 but this appears to have been rejected.\n\nDenis Horrigan (also borne as Horigan)\n\nThe 28-year-old enlisted on 18th September 1862, serving as a Private in Company F. He was mustered out with his company on 15th July 1865 near Washington D.C. He received an invalid pension from 22nd November 1890.\n\nJohn Holmes (also borne as Holms)\n\nThe 40-year-old enlisted on 13th September 1862, and became a Private in Company F. He was listed as a deserter following the expiration of a furlough on 24th March 1864 at Devereaux Station, Virginia.\n\nMichael Harrington\n\nThe 36-year-old enlisted on 9th September 1862 and became a Private in Company F. He was killed in action at the North Anna on 24th May 1864. Michael’s widow Mary (née Mahon) received a pension from 2nd September 1865. She lived at 57 Baxter Street in New York and listed her age as 50 when she first applied for the pension in 1864. The couple had been married in St. Peter’s Catholic Church, New York on 7th January 1856 by the Reverend Mr. Quinn. When Michael died he left one child, Catherine, who had been born in the late 1850s.\n\nAnthony Holshue (also borne as Holschzhuh)\n\nThe 40-year-old enlisted on 12th September 1862 and served as a Private in Company F. He died of paralysis at Suffolk, Virginia on 12th February 1863. He was said to have contracted the paralysis while on picket duty that January, a result of severe hardship and fatigue. Anthony’s widow Sophia (née Bertsch) received a pension dated from 23rd July 1863. Anthony (the correct spelling of his name was Anton Holzschuh) was originally from Niederhofen in Württemberg, while Sophia was from Eberstadt, also in Württemberg. His death left the family ‘helpless’, leaving only his ‘old uniform cloths’ and a likeness of his young son behind. The couple had been married on 23rd April 1855 at the German Universial Christian Church in New York; Sophia had travelled from her home in West-Hoboken for the ceremony to marry Anton, who was a widower. It seems likely Anton had lied about his age to enlist in 1862; his marriage record of 1855 records his age as 43, suggesting he was more likely 50-years-old upon enlistment. Sophia was living in Hudson City, New Jersey when she applied for the pension in 1863, at the age of 32. The couple had two surviving children in 1863- Sophia (aged seven and born 31st December 1855 in Hoboken) and John (aged five). John did not long outlive his father, dying in New York on 5th February 1866 at the family home of 261 Avenue A in New York.\n\nMichael Kelly\n\nThe 21-year-old enlisted on 18th September 1862, becoming a Private in Company F. He was wounded in action at Petersburg on 22nd June 1864 and never returned to his company. He was absent sick when it mustered out in 1865.\n\nJohn Lynch\n\nThe 37-year-old enlisted on 15th September 1862 and initially served as a Private in Company F. He was promoted to First Sergeant on 7th October 1862, Second Lieutenant on 1st February 1863 and First Lieutenant on 10th April 1863. John was discharged from service on 5th October 1863.\n\nJeremiah Mahoney (also borne as Mohoney)\n\nThe 18-year-old enlisted on 16th September 1862, becoming a Private in Company F. He was wounded in action at Petersburg on 16th June 1864, never returning to his company. He was absent in hospital when they mustered out in 1865. He filed for a disability pension resulting from his service on 12th February 1866 which was granted.\n\nPatrick McGuin (also borne as McGinn, McGraw)\n\nThe 43-year-old enlisted on 18th September 1862 and became a Private in Company F. He was reported missing in action at the Battle of Ream’s Station on 25th August 1864, returned from hospital and was transferred to the 129th Company, 2nd Battalion of the Veteran Reserve Corp on 1st January 1865. He was discharged for disability at Finley Hospital, Washington D.C. on 3rd March 1865. Patrick died on 14th October 1875 and his widow claimed a pension based on his service from 21st July 1890.\n\nJohn McManus\n\nThe 45-year-old enlisted on 16th September 1862 and became a Private in Company F. He was recorded as deserted on 24th March 1864 at Union Mills, Virginia, having never returned at the expiration of a furlough.\n\nOwen McNamara\n\nThe 43-year-old enlisted on 10th September 1862 and became a Private in Company I. He deserted on 9th October 1862 at Camp Scott, Staten Island, New York Harbor.\n\nOwen McLoughlin (also borne as McLaughlin and McGlaughlin)\n\nThe 31-year-old enlisted on 18th September 1862, becoming a Private in Company F. He was wounded at the Battle of the North Anna on 24th May 1864 and again at the Battle of Ream’s Station on 25th August 1864. He never returned to his Company, and was recorded as absent wounded in hospital at muster out in 1865. However, it appears he had in fact died of his wounds; a widow’s pension was filed but rejected on 14th December 1864 but a subsequent minor child’s application was granted.\n\nPatrick O’Flaherty (also borne as Flaherty)\n\nThe 42-year-old enlisted on 9th September 1862. He initially became a Private in Company F but was transferred to Company D of the 14th Veteran Reserve Corps on 7th September 1863. He mustered out with them at Washington D.C. on 20th July 1865\n\nTerrence O’Reilly (also borne as O’Rielly, Reilly)\n\nThe 38-year-old enlisted on 15th September 1862, becoming a Private in Company F. He died of cholera on 19th September 1863 at Centreville, Virginia, having first taken sick while on picket duty. His 41-year-old widow Mary (née Cooney) successfully applied for a pension on 19th December 1864 from her home at No. 385, Second Avenue in New York. The couple had been married by the Reverend Matthew McQuade at Kill, Co. Cavan on 17th February 1846. They emigrated soon afterwards, as their daughter Catharine had been born in New York on 10th April 1847, and baptised in the Church of the Nativity on Second Avenue. A second daughter, Mary-Ann, was born around 1852 but did not survive to adulthood. Mary was described as a ‘poor woman with a sick child’ in 1866.\n\nAugustin O. Plunkett (also borne as Austin O. (Oliver) Plunkett)\n\nThe 21-year-old enlisted on 10th September 1862, initially becoming a Private in Company F. He was promoted Sergeant to date from 10th September 1862 and Sergeant-Major on 10th June 1864. Augustin actually assisted as a Sergeant in recruiting a number of other men on the list in September 1862, including Terrence O’Reilly. Augustin was wounded at the Battle of Ream’s Station on 25th August 1864, and was retransferred to become a Private on 20th November 1864.

The child -Mary- had been dealt a tough start to life. Her mother was a pauper, and Mary had entered the world in Richmond County Poor House. Mary’s brother and sister were also paupers, and her mother was described as ‘intemperate’- there were no details regarding her father. Circumstances allowed Mary to be discharged from the Poor House on 12th May 1868, but by 3rd November 1871 she was back in her birthplace. At least she was being given some education, as by 1875 she was able to read. Poor House staff noted that ‘she will soon have to go to service’ and remarked that ‘this child bids fair to be a good servant she is being taught all the requirements of the institution.’\n\nThis vignette of Mary Brown’s life is drawn from the records of residents in New York Poor Houses and Alms Houses. From 1875 State law required that institutions record details of individuals in their care on a standardised form to be sent to the State Board of Charities. The form recorded a number of details about the individual, their parents, their origins and also of the cause of their dependence. It also offered an opinion on the prospect of them escaping dependence in the future. A number of the 1875 records deal with individuals first admitted in earlier decades- making it possible to explore some from the 1860s. The fifty people I decided to look at were all born in Ireland, and all had been admitted to New York Poor Houses and Alms Houses between 1861 and 1865. In selecting them, I chose those whose place of origin had been determined to at least county level.\n\nWhat is immediately apparent among the group is the dominance of older people. There were often catastrophic consequences for individuals who in later life found they could no longer make a living. The concept of ‘old’ is very different to ours- two of those in this sample who were admitted partially as a result of ‘old age’ were only in their 40s. Also notable is how social status did not necessarily protect you from the Poor House if you found yourself alone- for example Bridget Rowley’s father had been a minister, Rose McHegan’s father a distiller and Esther Turner’s father a gentleman (and Esther herself a teacher), yet all ended up in institutions. Similarly it is interesting how a number of those supposedly at the lowest strata of society, such as laborers, had managed to educate themselves and become literate. Aside from old age, a number of illnesses recur among the sample. Chief among them are blindness and rheumatism, which put an end to the working capacity of a number of the group. Other common causes which led to admission were things such ‘insanity’, paralysis and alcohol dependence.\n\nThe records show just how precarious life could be for immigrants in 19th century New York. There are a number of cases where both a husband and wife were in the Poor House; perhaps most poignant are the references to people who had siblings or children who were alive and remained self-supporting, but who clearly could not offer charity to their own family members. This is something I have come across repeatedly in dependent parent pension files- children who had married and started families of their own were simply unable to spare money to assist their parents, so precarious was their own financial position.\n\nIn the stories below are some especially heartrending examples of hardship. We meet people like Mary Hill, another woman who on the face of it should not have found herself in a Poor House- her father had been a physician. Yet we learn from her record that her father had placed her in the Poor House soon after they arrived in the United States from Co. Meath. Ann Bean from Cork had been just a girl when she went into the Poor House, also shortly after her arrival from Ireland. A single woman who appears to have spent much of her life in institutions, she was recorded in 1863 as suffering from ‘puerperal insanity’ which can develop after childbirth. You will find brief descriptions of the circumstances of each of the 50 people I looked at below, based on their Poor House records. Each individual is listed chronologically according to the date of their original admission. If you are interested in learning more about Poor Houses and Alms Houses in the United States and their history you can read an essay by Dr. David Wagner on the topic here.

Admitted to Albany City Alms House, 7th June 1861.\n\nJames was recorded as a 40 year-old widower when he was admitted. He had spent his working life as a tailor, and in 1861 had one surviving child. His father in Limerick had been a farmer; James had received some education as he was able to read and write. The cause of his dependence was recorded as insanity, from which it was felt he would not recover. Despite this it was still felt that he may be able to do some farm work in the future. It was said that his ‘insanity is supposed to have been cause in this case by excessive drinking. Is very violent at times exacting much of the attendants time to keep him quiet. Is not unclean in person or habits. It cannot be learned that any other member of the family were insane.’\n\nEllen Griffin, Co. Waterford. Admitted to Kings County Alms House, June 1861.\n\nEllen was recorded as a 60-year-old widow. Her father and mother, both from Waterford, had been a farmer and housekeeper respectively. Ellen also listed her profession as housekeeper, and she had two living children. Her cause of dependence was rheumatism and destitution. Unable to perform any laborer, her entry records that she would later spend four months in Kings County Hospital. It was felt at the time that she would probably always remain dependent.\n\nJane Redding, Cork city, Co. Cork. Admitted to New York City Alms House, 27th September 1861.\n\nJane was a 30-year-old single woman when admitted. Her father had been a steward.

Despite this, she was still able to carry out house work, but was nonetheless categorised as permanently dependent.\n\nElizabeth White, Dublin city, Co. Dublin. Admitted to New York City Alms House, 8th January 1862.\n\nElizabeth was a 50-year-old widow. Her father had been a merchant, a fact which undoubtedly helped her to gain an education, as Elizabeth could both read and write. Elizabeth worked as a domestic, but like Jane Redding was now afflicted with rheumatism. The main labor she could now pursue was sewing. Elizabeth was classed as being permanently dependent.\n\nBridget Rowley, Roscommon town, Co. Roscommon. Admitted to Columbia County Poor House, 4th February 1862.\n\nBridget was a 52-year-old married woman when admitted. Her father had been a minister, suggesting the family had some means. Her education was described as ‘common.’ Bridget was a housewife who in 1862 had one surviving child.

Admitted to Kings County Alms House, 1st May 1862.\n\nMary was a 14-year-old girl when admitted. She had no education; her parents who were also both from Sligo worked as a farmer and housekeeper. By 1862 she was sick and destitute, but remained able to perform housework. It was felt she had a very good chance of recovering from dependence. It seems she was not with her parents at this time, as it was noted that ‘This womans relatives are all in Ireland. She is entirely without education, but can now perform any kind of domestic work.’\n\nAnn Sullivan, Longford town, Co. Longford. Admitted to New York city Alms House, 27th August 1862.\n\nAnn was a 49-year-old single woman. Her father had been a laborer in Ireland, and she worked as a domestic.

His father had been a farmer. The reason for his admittance was old age and destitution- it was reported that he had been an inmate of Poor Houses for a total of eight years. In the remarks it was noted that ‘C. McCarthy is husband of No. 26 [his wife]- both drunkards‘.\n\nJohn Haley, Co. Galway. Admitted to New York City Alms House, 3rd October 1862.\n\nJohn was a 54-year-old married man when he was admitted. In Ireland his father had worked as a farmer.

Admitted to Sullivan County Poor House, 1862.\n\nMargaret was a single-woman of unknown age when she was admitted. Her father had been a farmer and Margaret could read but was unable to write- she had engaged in housework as her livelihood. Her age appears not to have been recorded because Margaret was unable to tell them it. Her dependency was apparently a result of insanity, and it was recorded that she would always remain dependent. It was remarked that ‘This woman has been in the Poor House the greater part of her life time, and has to be kept confined as she is very violent.’\n\nBridget Nolan, Co. Westmeath. Admitted to Kings County Alms House, 1862.\n\nBridget was a 5o-year-old widow when she was admitted. Her father had been a farmhand, and Bridget was a housekeeper. She was illiterate.

She was said to have no prospect of recovery from her cause of dependence. It was noted that she first entered the Poor House system shortly after her arrival in the United States, and that she suffered from ‘Puerperal Insanity’- a mental illness that follows childbirth.
