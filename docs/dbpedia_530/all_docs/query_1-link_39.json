Cech\n\nRECESSIONAL\n\nThe names published in this Commencement program include candidates for graduation in summer semester 2024 or fall semester 2024. Participation in Commencement and inclusion in the Commencement program does not guarantee the official granting of a degree. The Registrar’s Office verifies completion of all coursework before a degree is conferred. The official document verifying degree completion is the official Carroll College transcript.\n\nThe Academic Procession\n\nThe academic dress worn by scholars in the Commencement procession originated in the Middle Ages. When European universities began to take form in the 12th and 13th centuries, the scholars often served as clerics as well, and they adopted garb similar to that of their monastic orders. Buildings were cold and drafty, so caps and warm, floor length capes with hoods were necessities. As the control of education passed from the churches, the garb was modified in various ways, and there sprang a great diversity of color and style with the cap, gown and hood worn at different institutions. The custom of wearing academic dress was brought to America in Colonial times, but it was not until 1895 that a standardized code of academic dress was established and followed by most colleges and universities across the United States.\n\nToday the black robe, hood, and cap are standard, although some schools have more colorful regalia. Both cap and gown are symbols. According to legend, the privilege of wearing a cap was the initial right of a freed Roman slave. The academic cap, therefore, has become a sign of the freedom of scholarship. The flowing gown has become symbolic of the democracy of scholarship, for it covers clothing that might otherwise indicate social rank or strata.\n\nAt Carroll College, the faculty wear garb unique to the institution from which each received his or her highest degree. All students receiving Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degrees wear the traditional black cap and gown, as well as a hood that is lined in purple and gold, the official colors of Carroll College; the color of the velvet binding represents the various majors at Carroll. Students receiving a Master of Accountancy or Master of Social Work degree wear a black cap and gown with oblong sleeves.\n\nHood Colors\n\nColorMajor / ProgramApricotNursingDark BluePhilosophy, Political Science, Public RelationsLight BlueEducationBrownFine ArtsCitronSocial WorkDrabAccounting, Business, FinanceScience GoldAnthrozoology, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Studiest, Mathematics, Physics, PsychologyMaroonCommunication StudiesOrangeEngineeringPeacockInternational RelationsSageHealth SciencesSalmon PinkPublic HealthScarletTheologyWhiteEnglish, French, History, Sociology, Spanish\n\nHonor Song\n\nToday, and for the first time, Carroll College is including a Native American Honor Song as part of its commencement ceremony. Singers and drummers from the Blackfeet Nation will sing this Honor Song to recognize the accomplishments of all graduates, especially Native American students graduating today. Carroll College sincerely thanks Jaydee Weatherwax, an enrolled member of the Blackfeet nation and first Native American graduating from Carroll’s Master of Social Work program, for championing this effort and assisting with planning. Please remain standing during the Honor Song.\n\nAwards\n\nOUTSTANDING TEACHING AWARD\n\nThe Outstanding Teaching Award is presented by Carroll College faculty, staff, and students to recognize an exemplary educator.\n\nDISTINGUISHED SCHOLAR AWARD\n\nThe Distinguished Scholar Award is presented by Carroll College faculty, staff, and students in recognition of significant scholarly contribution to a discipline.\n\nBISHOP GILMORE MEMORIAL AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING SCHOLARSHIP\n\nSeniors who have attained the highest grade point average and have 60 or more institutional credits at Carroll College are honored with the Bishop Gilmore Memorial Award. The award is named in memory of the Most Reverend Joseph M. Gilmore, fifth Bishop of Helena.\n\nMICHAEL MURPHY AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING COLLEGIATE CITIZENSHIP\n\nThe Michael Murphy Award is presented to a graduating senior who, through personal achievement, generosity, and leadership, has excelled in promoting the true spirit and ideals of Carroll College. The recipient is selected on the basis of his or her contributions to the collegiate community at Carroll. This honor is bestowed in memory of Michael W. Murphy, a deceased student of the college, who himself served as a model for this award.\n\nRAYMOND G. HUNTHAUSEN AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING SERVICE\n\nSince 1986 Carroll College has presented the Raymond G. Hunthausen Award for community service to deserving students who make outstanding contributions to the college or a community (Helena or other). The award was named for Archbishop Hunthausen because of his own commitment to peace and justice in his personal life and in his work with the Catholic Church. The award was established to acknowledge students who exhibit a sense of commitment to others for the sole purpose of giving from their own personal sense of unselfish service.\n\nGRADUATION HONORS\n\nTo be eligible for graduation honors, a Carroll undergraduate student must complete 60 hours of coursework at Carroll and graduate with a cumulative grade point average of not less than 3.50. The three levels of honors are cum laude (3.50–3.69), magna cum laude (3.70–3.89), and summa cum laude (3.90–4.0).\n\nTo be eligible for graduation with distinction, an undergraduate student must complete 60 hours of course work at Carroll, complete the senior thesis with a grade of “B” (3.0) or higher, and graduate with a cumulative grade point average of not less than 3.25.\n\nThe Honors Scholars Program is a four-year program of study founded on the Great Books tradition. Honors Scholars graduates have completed a sequence of five interdisciplinary seminars where they have explored seminal works from the Western intellectual tradition, and they have completed an honors capstone or thesis.\n\nCalculation of the grade point average includes only credits and grades earned at Carroll; for post-baccalaureate students pursuing a second bachelor’s degree at Carroll, only grades earned during the second degree program will be included. Honors noted in this program do not include the current semester; official graduation honors will be evaluated at the time all degree requirements have been completed.\n\nStudents wearing honor cords, stoles, or medals along with their hoods have been inducted into academic honor societies or have earned special academic achievements. Students who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Services are wearing red, white, and blue honor cords. The sashes worn by some students represent the country where the student studied abroad.\n\nStudents and jubilarian alumni wearing a green tassel are being recognized for making a gift to Carroll College. We thank these students and alumni for their tradition of giving.\n\nKEY\n\nMCL – Magna Cum Laude\n\nSCL – Summa Cum Laude\n\nCL – Cum Laude\n\n* Graduates who have completed the Carroll College Honors Scholars Program.
