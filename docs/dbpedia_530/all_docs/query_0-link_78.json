I had the opportunity to attend the 2014 Medal of Honor Convention in Knoxville, Tennessee, on behalf of UnitedHealthcare, and returned to Minnesota so inspired I knew it was my duty to bring this experience to the citizens of our great state. What our team has found throughout the last two years is that our community is one of the best in the country. The outpouring of passion and support people, corporations, and organizations have shown for the Medal of Honor recipients and this convention is mind-blowing. Recipients and loved ones, I hope you can see how much we truly appreciate you; your sacrifices, courage, and heroic acts have not and will not go unnoticed in our community. We will never truly understand your lives, but we will always work to perpetuate your legacies. Putting together a weeklong convention from start to finish takes a lot of work. Over the last several months, dozens of committee members, hundreds of corporate and veteran organization volunteers, and an incredibly generous group of sponsors pulled together for this worthy cause. I would like to personally thank our amazing contributors, especially our Presenting Sponsor, UnitedHealthcare, our Hero sponsor, Target, and our Official Airline Partner, American Airlines. Without our sponsors’ dona- tions, dedication to this project, and nearly 400 volunteers, this week would not have been successful. I would also like to thank our passionate and dedicated committee members, including the Medal of Honor Convention Twin Cities Board of Directors and staff, our volunteer team leads who have been working on this project for over a year, and our active duty and reserve service members and local law enforcement agencies who, combined, have provided THOUSANDS of volunteer hours toward this cause. I have never seen so many individuals come together in such a short period of time, with so much commitment and hard work, to pull off such an impactful and epic week of events. On behalf of the Medal of Honor Convention Twin Cities team, THANK YOU, to all of you, for being part of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I encourage each and every one of you to allow yourselves to be inspired by this experience, take that feeling with you, and do something amazing with it. I know I will.

LONG BEFORE TAKEOFF.\n\n8. 12 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 13 Created in 1861 by President Abraham Lincoln, the Medal of Honor is our Nation’s highest, and rarest, military decoration. It is bestowed by the President of the United States, in the name of Congress, upon members of the United States Armed Forces who distinguish themselves through “conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against the enemy of the United States.” Fewer than 3,500 individuals have received the Medal, many of which were awarded posthumously. About the Medal of Honor 12 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 13\n\n9. 14 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 15 The Navy Medal was the first Medal of Honor, created at the request of Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. It has changed little since Christian Schuller of the Philadelphia firm of William Wilson & Sons designed it in 1862. Originally for enlisted men only, officers became eligible in 1915. This Medal is also worn by those in the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard. The Navy Medal BLUE SILK RIBBON The blue silk ribbon bears 13 stars, symbolic of the 13 original colonies. It was originally red, white and blue. ANCHOR-SHAPED BAIL The anchor-shaped bail was originally wrapped in rope, but changed in 1913 to the current version. MEDAL: INVERTED FIVE-POINT STAR SHAPE Thirty-four stars surround the center of the Medal, one for each of the states in 1862, including the Southern states that had joined the Confederacy. Each point of the star contains laurel leaves, for victory, and oak leaves, for strength. CENTERPIECE DESIGN In the scene “Minerva Repelling Discord,” Roman goddess Minerva wears an owl, for wisdom, on her helmet. Her left hand holds rods and an ax for authority; her right hand, the shield of union. The man clutching snakes is “Discord,” an apt symbol for the chaos of the Civil War. 14 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 15\n\n10. 16 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 17 The Army Medal, from the same die as the Navy Medal, differed only in the bail, an eagle perched on crossed cannons . In 1863, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton presented the first Medals to six surviving members of Andrews’ Raiders. In 1904, recipient General George Gillespie, from Kingston, TN, redesigned the Medal to its current presentation. The Army Medal BLUE SILK RIBBON The ribbon was changed from its red, white and blue to a light blue with 13 embroidered stars for the 13 original colonies. On the back of the Medal, the words, “The Congress To,” appear on the “VALOR” bar. The recipient’s name is filled in below. EAGLE BAIL The 1862 version of the bail was an eagle, symbol of the United States, perched on crossed cannons and clutching a saber. The eagle now clutches shafts of arrows and perches on a bar bearing the word “VALOR.” GREEN LAUREL SURROUND The oak clusters, representing strength, remain in the points of the star but are now rendered in dark green enamel. The laurel clusters (for victory) form an open wreath, also enameled in green. CENTERPIECE DESIGN In the “Gillespie Medal,” the words “United States of America” replaced the 34 stars (representing the number of states at the time of the Civil War). The scene of “Minerva Repelling Discord,” so appropriate during that time of disunion, is now a simple profile of the helmeted Goddess of War, still with an owl on her helmet, representing wisdom. 16 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 17\n\n11. 18 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 19 The Air Force created its Medal in 1965. The first Air Force Medal went to Major Bernard F. Fisher in 1967, for action in South Vietnam. The first airman to receive a Medal, however, was the famous fighter pilot Captain Edward Rickenbacker of the Army Air Corps, who received the Medal of Honor in 1918. The Air Force Medal BLUE SILK RIBBON All three versions of the Medal are worn suspended from a blue silk ribbon bearing 13 stars. AIR FORCE COAT OF ARMS BAIL The Air Force Medal kept the bar of the Army Medal, bearing the word “VALOR.” The Air Force Coat of Arms, made of wings and flashes of lightning, replaced the Army eagle. OAK AND LAUREL The Medal retains the green enamel laurel wreath (victory) and the five points of oak leaves (strength) in the Army Medal, which airmen had previously received. Like the original Army Medal, a circle of 34 stars surrounds the centerpiece. CENTERPIECE The head of the Statue of Liberty has replaced Minerva. Lady Liberty’s image is based on that of Semiramis, Queen of Babylon. Famed for beauty, strength, and wisdom, she is said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. 18 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 19\n\n12. 20 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 21 THE MINTING PROCESS Step 1—The base of the Medal is made by striking a brass blank. Step 2—After creating the blanks, employees anneal and re-strike the piece. Step 3—The piece is trimmed before being pierced where the anchor assembly will be attached. Step 4—Two holes drilled in the top allow the attachment of the anchor. Step 5—The Medal is dipped to apply a coat of antique finish. Step 6—After the antiquing process, the Medal is hand-finished and polished. Step 7—Finally, the Medal is sprayed with lacquer before the suspension assembly is attached. Step 8—Artisans use an 85/15 brass blank to create the anchor for the suspension assembly. Step 9—After piercing the anchor, rings are soldered to the back, adjacent to the anchor hooks.

The purpose of the Society, among other things, is to perpetuate the legacy of the Medal of Honor. The Congressional Medal of Honor Society is made up of all living Medal of Honor recipients, of which six were awarded for actions during World War II, six for actions during the Korean War, 54 for actions during the Vietnam War, and 11 for actions during the Global War on Terrorism. Each year the Society gathers at a different host city around the country for their annual Medal of Honor Convention.

The memorial will be in prominent view of the Capitol, centrally located on the Mall, adjacent to and within view of the war and veteran commemo- rations and the military Court of Honor. The winning design entry provides symbolic ties to the Medal itself and also the character virtues Medal of Honor recipients leave as their legacy to our future generations. The memorial will honor Minnesotan Medal of Honor recipients, as well as our Nation’s recipients. It will also serve to educate the public by providing access to individual citation documentation and available biographical information. Recipient information of all other medals of valor will also be accessible at the memorial. The mechanical Promise of Youth memorial within the Medal of Honor memorial water feature will enhance the connec- tion between Medal of Honor recipients, the six pillars of the Medal of Honor Character Development Program, and our future leaders. The Minnesota Medal of Honor Memorial will be the first state memorial dedicated to all of our Nation’s recipients and that emphasizes the characteristics of the Medal as laid out in the Medal of Honor Character Development Program. It is particularly meaningful and appropriate that the vision and desires of past and present generations have come together in a common commitment to honor the selfless valor of all our nation’s heroes and their legacy with a particularly prominent and ever enduring memorial.

The Honorable James R. Clapper Director of National Intelligence PATRIOT AWA R D he Honorable James R. Clapper was sworn in as the fourth Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on August 9, 2010. As DNI, Mr. Clapper leads the United States Intelligence Community and serves as the principal intelligence advisor to the President. Mr. Clapper retired in 1995 after a distinguished career in the U.S. Armed Forces. His career began as a rifleman in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and culminated as a lieutenant general in the U.S. Air Force and Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. His intelligence-related positions over his 32 years in uniform included Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence at U.S. Air Force Headquar- ters during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm and Director of Intelligence for three war-fighting commands: U.S. Forces Korea, Pacific Command, and Strategic Air Command. Of note, he also served two combat tours during the Southeast Asia conflict and flew 73 combat support missions in EC-47s over Laos and Cambodia. Directly following his retirement, Mr. Clapper worked in industry for six years as an executive in three successive companies with his business focus being the Intelligence Community. Mr. Clapper also served as a consultant and advisor to Congress and to the Departments of Defense and Energy and as a member of a wide variety of govern- ment panels, boards, commissions, and advisory groups. He was a member of the Downing Assessment Task Force that investigated the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996, and was vice chairman of a commission chaired by former Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia on the subject of home- land security. Mr. Clapper returned to the government in September 2001 as the first civilian director of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA). He served as Director for five years transforming it into the National Geospatial-In- telligence Agency (NGA) as it is today. Prior to becoming the Director of National Intelli- gence, Mr. Clapper served for over three years in two Administrations as the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, where he served as the principal staff assis- tant and advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense on intelligence, counterintelligence, and secu- rity matters for the Department. In this capacity, he was also dual-hatted as the Director of Defense Intelligence for DNI. Mr. Clapper earned a bachelor’s degree in government and politics from the University of Maryland, a master’s degree in political science from St. Mary’s Univer- sity, San Antonio, Texas, and an honorary doctorate in strategic intelligence from the then Joint Military Intelligence College.

SAWYER FREDERICKSSawyer Fredericks has certainly come a long way from the 88-acre Upstate New York farm where he grew up. However, home is still a big part of his soulful, contemporary folk sound. “That’s where I started playing guitar,” he says. “It was so much fun growing up there. There was a lot of open space, and I was able to be around animals. Nature really inspired me. I feel like it gave me a different musical perspective.” His stark honesty and soulful delivery turned him into a national phenomenon during the eighth season of NBC’s Emmy Award®-winning The Voice. As part of “Team Pharrell,” he emerged as the “youngest victor in the show’s history” at just 16-years-old. Moreover, he made Voice history, becoming “the first artist to land 14 songs in the iTunes Overall Top 200 Songs Chart in one week.” All in all, his digital sales exceeded 1 million cumu- lative singles, making him one of the show’s most successful artists ever. Most importantly, Sawyer’s time on The Voice taught him quite a few things. “I learned so much,” he says. “It was incredible to be around that many artists and see so much talent. I took it all in. Getting to perform on that stage was amazing. I also remember Pharrell gave me a piece of advice that I’ll never forget. He said, ‘Stay true to yourself.’” That’s what Sawyer does on his latest album A Good Storm for Republic Records. Led by the striking and soulful first single “Take It All,” the collection is a continuation of his singular style. “The process of co-writing was new for me,” he says. “Learning to create a more upbeat song and work with someone else was a great learning expe- rience. Lyrically, it’s a love song about a guy who’s at the end of his rope, and this woman has lifted him up.” Elsewhere on the album, “Lovers Still Alone” sees his voice take the spotlight over a rich sonic backdrop. “I got to work with a full band in the studio, and it came out really nicely,” he goes on. “It’s about a person who’s with someone, but the significant other is not really acknowledging them or loving them. I think everyone’s been through that kind of one-sided relationship. Appearing twice on the album, another stand out track is the song, “4 Pockets.” Closing out the record, each version brings its own flavor and showcases Sawyer’s versatility. The ‘Original Mix’ is the epitome of Sawyer’s soulful style, while the ‘Pharrell Williams Mix’ offers a rhythmic response featuring more production for an alternative viewpoint on the song. “4 Pockets” even caught the attention of The Voice, inviting him back to perform the original version on the show’s tenth season. Ultimately, Sawyer forges a true connection between his roots and his passion for music that has lead him to where he is today “I want the lyrics and music to connect to the audience,” he leaves off. “I just hope they feel when they hear me.” Patriot Awards Gala ENTERTAINMENT www.mohtwincities.com 51\n\n28. 52 The Medal of Honor Convention www.mohtwincities.com 53 CIVIL WAR James F.
