The U.S. Ski & Snowboard National Alpine Masters Committee makes the selections. The award is presented in honor of Al Sise, the acknowledged father of alpine masters racing.\n\nAlbert Sise was one of ski racing's early pioneers in the United States. He raced at Mount Mooselauk in 1928 and competed in the first national downhill championship in 1933. He continued to race for fifty years competing in the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Senior Alpine Championships in 1981 when he won the giant slalom, slalom and combined titles. He was a strong advocate for veteran's racing insisting that it be well organized but conducted in a spirit of friendly competition.\n\nPast Recipients\n\n1987 Penny Bennett | Jorg Dutschke\n\n1988 Joan Crane Barthold | Fritz Siegenthaler\n\n1989 Joan Crane Barthold | Jorg Dutschke\n\n1990 Wendy Hill | Haldor Reinholt\n\n1991 Corneil Russell | Hans Pretscherer\n\n1992 Lisa Feinberg Densmore | David Tengdin\n\n1993 Nancy Auseklis | Allan Beck\n\n1994 Lisa Feinberg Densmore | Bob Bernard\n\n1995 Nancy Auseklis | David Kincaid\n\n1996 Sarah Pendleton | Pepi Neubauer\n\n1997 Nicole Thompson | Greg Sarkis\n\n1998 Nicole Thompson | Greg Sarkis\n\n1999 Anna Droege | John Gianotti\n\n2000 Lisa Feinberg Densmore | Knut Olberg\n\n2001 Not Awarded\n\n2002 Julie Tsamasfyros | Stan Beach\n\n2003 Lisa Feinberg Densmore | Shawn Ackerman\n\n2004 Carolyn Beckedorff | Knut Olberg\n\n2005 Deborah Lewis | Cary Adgate\n\n2006 Jesse McAleer | Patrick McNamara\n\n2007 Dana Alexandrescu | Timothy Hill\n\n2008 Carolyn Beckedorff | Matt Savage\n\n2009 Jennifer Kaufman | Benjamin Green\n\n2010 Anna Droege | Victor Roy\n\n2011 Jessie W.

It was originated by the Deaver family in memory of Sally Deaver, the 1956 and ‘57 slalom champion.\n\nSally Deaver Murray learned to ski at age 10 while attending North Country School in Lake Placid, New York. Her race career started after a ski vacation in Chile, South America. While skiing in the Andes she caught the \"ski bug\" and spent three seasons there under the coaching of Emile Allais, Stein Eriksen, Buddy Werner and Tom Corcoran.\n\nHer most outstanding results came in 1956 when she won the National Women's Giant Slalom Championship and the National Women's Slalom Championship. She again won the National Women's Giant Slalom Championship in 1957 and captained the U.S. women's team for the 1958 FIS World Alpine Championships. She turned down a chance to be a part of the 1960 U.S. Olympic Team Training Squad to marry Benjamin H. Murray. Never having a serious skiing accident, it was her passion for the sport of equestrian which caused her death in 1963 after being thrown from her horse while training.\n\nPast Recipients\n\n1965 Nancy Greene\n\n1966 Wendy Allen\n\n1967 Penny McCoy\n\n1968 Judy Nagel\n\n1969 Barbara Ann Cochran\n\n1970 Marilyn Cochran\n\n1971 Lindy Cochran\n\n1974 Susie Patterson\n\n1975 Cindy Nelson\n\n1976 Cindy Nelson\n\n1977 Christin Cooper\n\n1978 Becky Dorsey\n\n1979 Cindy Nelson\n\n1980 Christin Cooper\n\n1981 Cindy Nelson\n\n1982 Tamara McKinney\n\n1983 Tamara McKinney\n\n1984 Tamara McKinney\n\n1985 Ann Melander\n\n1986 Tamara McKinney\n\n1987 Tamara McKinney\n\n1988 Tamara McKinney\n\n1989 Tamara McKinney | Diann Roffe\n\n1990 Monique Pelletier\n\n1991 Eva Twardokens\n\n1992 Diann Roffe-Steinrotter\n\n1993 Kristi Terzian\n\n1994 Kristi Terzian\n\n1995 Kristina Koznick\n\n1996 Kristina Koznick\n\n1997 Kristina Koznick\n\n1998 Kristina Koznick\n\n1999 Alex Shaffer\n\n2000 Caroline Lalive\n\n2001 Sarah Schleper\n\n2002 Sarah Schleper\n\n2003 Kristina Koznick\n\n2004 Lindsey Kildow\n\n2005 Sarah Schleper\n\n2006 Kaylin Richardson\n\n2007 Resi Stiegler\n\n2008 Lindsey Vonn\n\n2009 Lindsey Vonn\n\n2010 Sarah Schleper, SSCV\n\n2011 Mikaela Shiffrin, Burke Mtn.

In the 70's he switched to just cross country skiing and coaching and returned to college for exercise physiology and sports science. After an athlete he worked with made the '84 Olympic Team he began a Future Stars Program for ski kids 8 years old & older.\n\nIn 1985, he received the US Ski Team Domestic Coach of Year Award. In 1990 he received the Russell Wilder Award for work in helping develop America's youth, through year-round training in Future Stars Camps.

In 1973 she won her first international race, a 7.5K event at Castelrotte, Italy. She went on to win 5 of 6 races in Europe in 1975 and finished 10th overall in the World Cup. Between 1969 and 1975 she won several national distance titles and 18 of 19 possible championships over that period. Twice she was voted the USA's top Nordic competitor. Following retirement from competition she coached Dartmouth's women's ski team.\n\nPast Recipients\n\n1986 Cami Thompson\n\n1987 Nancy Fiddler\n\n1988 Leslie Thompson\n\n1989 Nancy Fiddler\n\n1990 Leslie Thompson\n\n1991 Nancy Fiddler\n\n1992 Nancy Fiddler\n\n1993 Nancy Fiddler\n\n1994 Nina Kemppel\n\n1995 Leslie Thompson\n\n1996 Laura Wilson\n\n1997 Nina Kemppel\n\n1998 Wendy Wagner\n\n1999 Nina Kemppel\n\n2000 Rebecca Quinn\n\n2001 Nina Kemppel\n\n2002 Tara Hamilton\n\n2003 Wendy Wagner\n\n2004 Rebecca Dussault\n\n2005 Wendy Wagner\n\n2006 Kikkan Randall & Liz Stephen\n\n2007 Lindsey Weier\n\n2008 Caitlin Compton\n\n2009 Caitlin Compton\n\n2010 Kikkan Randall\n\n2011 Sadie Bjornsen\n\n2012 Jessica Diggins\n\n2013 Rosie Brennan\n\n2014 Becca Rorabough\n\n2015 Caitlin Gregg\n\n2016 Caitlin Patterson\n\n2017 Caitlin Gregg\n\n2018 Caitlin Patterson\n\n2019 Caitlin Patterson\n\n2020 Caitlin Patterson\n\n2021 Not Awarded\n\n2022 Caitlin Patterson\n\n2020 Hailey Swirbul\n\n2024 Not Awarded\n\nGALE COTTON BURTON AWARD\n\nThe Gale Cotton Burton Award is given to the winner of the men’s 15-km race at the U.S. Cross Country Championships.
