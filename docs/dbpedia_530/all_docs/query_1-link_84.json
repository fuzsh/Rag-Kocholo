        "text": "Tony Gilroy — Ian McLellan Hunter Award for Career Achievement\n\nA WGA East member since 1986, Gilroy has had an extraordinary career writing film and television.\n\nGilroy’s most recent accomplishment is as the creator of the series “Andor.” The acclaimed series’ first season was nominated for two Writers Guild Awards, “Best Drama Series” and “Best New Series,” eight Emmy Awards including “Best Drama Series,” and won a Peabody Award. He was also one of the writers on “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.”\n\nHis four screenplay adaptations of Robert Ludlum’s Jason Bourne series (“The Bourne Identity,” “The Bourne Supremacy,” “The Bourne Ultimatum,” “The Bourne Legacy”) set the bar for 21st century action-thriller films. His 2007 masterpiece, “Michael Clayton,” earned seven Academy Award-nominations including “Best Picture,” and Gilroy himself was nominated for “Best Original Screenplay” and “Best Director.”\n\nGilroy’s other screenwriting credits include memorable films like “The Cutting Edge,” “Duplicity,” “Dolores Claiborne,” “Proof of Life,” and “The Devil’s Advocate.” Tony Gilroy is the son of the legendary screenwriter and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank D. Gilroy, who was honored with the Hunter Award in 2011.\n\nRon Nyswaner — Walter Bernstein Award\n\nA multi-decade WGAE member, Ron Nyswaner is a writer and producer of powerful, issue-driven pieces. Most recently, Nyswaner created and produced the Showtime miniseries FELLOW TRAVELERS. Based on the novel by Thomas Mallon, the story follows the volatile romance of two men who meet in 1950s Washington DC, just as Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn initiate the Lavender Scare, declaring war on “subversives and sexual deviants.”\n\nHis feature film PHILADELPHIA was the first major Hollywood film to focus on the discrimination suffered by people with AIDS and was among the first to feature a homosexual main character. The trailblazing 1993 film earned Nyswaner “Original Screenplay” nominations at the Academy Awards and Writers Guild Awards.\n\nWhether it’s 1950’s McCarthyism, murder on a military base, justice in a Philadelphia courtroom, American counterintelligence post-September 11, or the conflict between religious faith and AIDS activism, his work resonates timelessly across a wide variety of lived and shared experiences.\n\nNyswaner’s feature films also include MY POLICEMAN, FREEHELD, SMITHEREENS, MRS. SOFFEL, SOLDIER’S GIRL, and THE PAINTED VEIL. In television, he has written and produced on acclaimed series RAY DONOVAN and HOMELAND, and executive produced the documentary series MURDER ON MIDDLE BEACH.\n\nI.A.T.S.E., Teamsters, SAG-AFTRA and AFM – Richard B. Jablow Award\n\nEarly into the ceremony, it was announced that the Writers Guild of America East’s Richard B. Jablow Award was being bestowed upon the members and leadership of International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (I.A.T.S.E.), International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and American Federation of Musicians (AFM) for demonstrating unwavering support and sacrifice during the WGA’s 148-day strike.\n\nWhile presenting the honorary award, WGAE President Lisa Takeuchi Cullen, who received the Jablow Award in 2020, stated, “To me, the most pivotal moments of the WGA strike of 2023 were each and every time we were joined by our sister unions. Each and every time Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians showed up to play honky tonk on the sidewalks of New York City. Each and every time a Teamster truck driver refused to cross our line. Each and every time an IATSE crew member sacrificed their day’s pay for our cause. Each and every time a SAG-AFTRA actor grabbed a megaphone out of our hands and chanted chants that did not rhyme. Thank you for your solidarity. We are one union, and we stand by your side, forever.”"
