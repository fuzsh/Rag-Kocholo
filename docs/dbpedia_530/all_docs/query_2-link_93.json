        "text": "Yale launched its rich lacrosse heritage late in the 1800s as one of the first universities in America to play the game competitively. The Elis won the national championship in 1883 and were a national power for many decades thereafter.\n\nYale had four players earn a pair of first-team All-America nods in the 1930s. Earl Stevens '31, Winthrop Smith '31, Harry Beggs '32 and John Train '34 became the first stars of lacrosse in New Haven. Harold Dell '42 joined the elite quartet, earning first-team All-America recognition in 1941 and 1942.\n\nYale had great success under the tutelage of William A.R. Harkness, who went 100-55-1 from 1950-63. His first squad set a school record with 12 wins, while his 1955 team won 11 of the 13 games. Harkness had 11 winning seasons, produced first-team All-Americans Kinloch Yellott '50, John Pendergast '57 and Bob Grose '63, and led the Elis to the Ivy League's first championship in 1956.\n\nRichard Corrigan (36-30-1), who took over as head coach in 1964 and then helped the Elis go 11-2 in 1966, was succeeded by Bob McHenry (60-84) in 1970. The tradition of excellent defensemen continued under Corrigan and McHenry with Charles Benoit '65 and Larry Story '72 earning first-team All-America honors their senior seasons.\n\nHead coach Mike Waldvogel brought Yale lacrosse back to national prominence with three consecutive (1988-90) Ivy championships in the toughest lacrosse league in the country. Yale also participated in the 1988, 1990 and 1992 NCAA Championships. The 1990 team, occupying the No. 2 position in the national poll for most of the season, reached the national semifinals. Two years later, the Elis reached the NCAA quarterfinals. Waldvogel became the winningest lacrosse coach in Yale history in 1993 and finished his career with an overall mark of 166-143.\n\nCurrent Yale head coach Andy Shay resurrected the program and raised the bar for the Bulldogs with a 2010 Ivy title and three (2012, 2013, 2015) league tournament championships. The tournament titles brought Yale automatic NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\nYale has won six Ivy League Championships, including the first one handed out in 1956. The others came in 1969, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 2010.\n\nThe Yale roll call of All-America selections and members of the Lacrosse Hall of Fame are a testament to the impact the program. Yale players have received All-America mention 184 times, including 21 first-team selections.\n\nJon Reese '90, the most decorated of all Yale players, received the 1990 Lt. Don C. McLaughlin, Jr. Memorial Award as the nation's top midfielder. He was a three-time first-team All-Ivy pick, the 1990 Ivy and New England Player of the Year and Yale's career leader in points (200) and goals (162). Reese, whose 82 goals his senior season are still an NCAA record, was a 1990 All-American, was named to the NCAA Silver Anniversary Team and became a U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame inductee in 2011, a year after Yale's home stadium was named after him and his brother, Jason '87, a goalie.\n\nOne of the best-known goalies in the history of the program is Tony Guido '90, who earned the 1990 Ensign C.M. Kelly Jr. Memorial Award as the top goaltender in Division 1. Guido helped the Elis earn three Ivy titles while playing in three NCAA Tournaments.\n\nTony Resch '85, an All-American defenseman his senior year, became better known after his days at New Haven. He helped the U.S. beat Canada in the championship of the 1990 World Games in Perth, Australia. He played professionally from 1988 to 1993 and became a coach in the pro ranks.\n\nThe Elis have had many dominating face-off men in recent years, but none had the success of Dan Kallaugher '06, who was among the nation's top three in face-off percentage for three seasons. Kallaugher, who once had 18 ground balls in a game and was Yale's 2006 MVP, became one of the top face-off men in Major League Lacrosse for the Chicago Machine after completing his college career with a .627 face-off percentage.\n\nSeven Yale graduates are members of the United States Lacrosse Hall of Fame: Jon Reese 90, Harry Beggs '32, Malcolm McIntyre '29 and '33 DSL, Winthrop A. Smith '31, Walter Collins '23, George Chandlee '36 and Robert G. Merrick '54.\n\nYALE MEN'S LACROSSE INDIVIDUAL AWARDS\n\nL. C. STOWELL AWARD.
