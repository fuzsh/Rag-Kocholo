        "text": "For her tireless support of PMEL, organizing the All-Hands Retreat, planning PMEL’s 50th Anniversary celebration, and serving on the PMEL Advisory Committee to improve the lab’s process for onboarding new staff. She also served on the OAR Diversity and Inclusion Committee to reduce bias in Federal hiring and include DEI-relevant evaluation criteria in employee’s annual reviews. She consistently offers constructive, actionable ideas to improve the lab working environment and is particularly adept at communicating the needs of colleagues in a positive, reasoned way, leading cultural change to improve the climate for the overall lab community.\n\nThe Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation recognizes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for producing scientific knowledge, alerting society, and informing decision-makers to make better choices for combating climate change and the loss of biodiversity. The IPCC, the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2007 (in conjunction with Al Gore) is the United Nations organism that has, since 1998, fostered the production of scientific knowledge within the scope of evaluating the climate impacts of human actions and supporting governments as regards their decision-making and the implementation of measures able to combat climate change. The IPCC has played a crucial role in accompanying the commitments made under the Paris Agreement on climate changes through the regular publication of reports and the results of voluntary work undertaken by thousands of scientists all around the world.\n\nThe Oregon State University (OSU) Gladys Valley Marine Studies Building was recognized as a top project by the Structural Engineers Association of Oregon (SEAO) Excellence in Structural Engineering 2021 Awards. The building was built by YGH Architecture with support by Andersen Construction Co, KPFF Consulting Engineers and OSU. The SEAO Excellence in Structural Engineering Awards was created to acknowledge outstanding projects and structural engineering advancement by members. The building currently serves as a Vertical Tsunami Evacuation Structure for the coastal communities of Newport and South Beach, OR. Through a University of Washington-YGH contract in 2018-2019, PMEL and UW CICOES experts (Diego Arcas and Yong Wei) with the Center for Tsunami Research made major contributions in tsunami hazard assessment and the track of large debris for the building design.\n\nThe Oregon State University (OSU) Gladys Valley Marine Studies Building was recognized as a Grand Prize Award in 2021 by Learning by Design. The building was built by YGH Architecture with support by Andersen Construction Co, KPFF Consulting Engineers and OSU. The Learning by Design awards jury, made up of architects and educational facility experts from across the continent, architecture firms, schools and universities, said that it was “designed with sea level rise in mind and designed to withstand an earthquake and a tsunami. It is an example of design for coastal resilience and public safety.” The building currently serves as a Vertical Tsunami Evacuation Structure for the coastal communities of Newport and South Beach, OR. Through a University of Washington-YGH contract in 2018-2019, PMEL and UW CICOES experts (Diego Arcas and Yong Wei) with the Center for Tsunami Research made major contributions in tsunami hazard assessment and the track of large debris for the building design.\n\nAdi Hanein is a Communications Specialist for OAR’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle, Washington. Adi leads PMEL’s outreach efforts, and her work to engage with external stakeholders only has increased during the pandemic. Adi was a key player in staffing virtual “booths” at scientific conferences, contributed to the Washington Orca Bowl, and to the state Alliance for Better School’s STEM Academy. She has produced a number of compelling press releases touting PMEL science, many of which have generated national news exposure, and created educational and informational materials for members of Congress and the general public. Adi also has played an instrumental role in developing collaboration and mentorship opportunities with local schools, and has increased PMEL’s participation in NOAA internship programs, including developing an integrated program for all summer interns that included an orientation and structured engagement across PMEL. In addition to external engagement, Adi leads monthly orientation sessions for new employees, initiated monthly ‘show-n-tell’ sessions to build community within PMEL, and has taken a lead in PMEL’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts by supporting training and co-leading an URGE (Unlearning Racism in the GeoSciences) ‘pod’ at PMEL, which includes anti-racism curriculum and discussions. Adi has gone above and beyond to ensure that PMEL remains a close-knit and equitable community, and has helped people around the world to understand PMEL’s science mission.\n\nThe group created a robust, reliable Autonomous Surface Vehicle CO2 sensor system (ASVCO2) for long-term deployments, capable of surviving the forces of 50-foot waves, 80 mph winds, and collisions with icebergs in the Southern Ocean. NOAA’s PMEL (Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory) worked with Saildrone Inc. through a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) over several years to test and modify the platform, and develop the ASVCO2 so it could collect robust measurements while the Saildrone reached peak speeds of 8 knots in high-wind conditions. The landmark accomplishment will ultimately increase observations and understanding of weather, climate, and ecosystem processes in remote, harsh, and rapidly changing oceanic regions. Preliminary results suggest that there is strong outgassing of CO2 in the austral winter; this finding upends our understanding of the Southern Ocean as a sink for atmospheric carbon. This public-private partnership demonstrated the deep scientific reach of a Federal research lab, and the ability of American industry to manufacture, test, and pilot world-class USVs. This remarkable achievement truly embodies the spirit and standards held up by Ron Brown.

One such cruise, on NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown, was scheduled to depart from South Africa in mid-March, but was caught in the cross-hairs of the coronavirus outbreak. Much of the science crew was in South Africa as that country was closing its borders, and the vessel was ordered to return home immediately and develop new procedures to ensure that no one on the vessel was a carrier. Despite this adversity, with the outstanding assistance of the crew of the Ron Brown, the team was able to collect basin-wide underway samples and measurements and deploy floats and drifters. Their creativity and perseverance resulted in a cross-basin multi-disciplinary set of samples that will support critical NOAA research, and the deployment of long-term observing platforms that will provide data for years to come.\n\nHaving participated in more than 50 expeditions, Susan Merle has demonstrated superior organization and data processing skills both at sea and in the office. She has produced numerous detailed cruise reports, organized sonar and other data sets for scientific analyses and long-term archiving, and contributed to many peer-reviewed publications and meeting presentations. Susan successfully implemented rapid data processing methods for multibeam sonar water-column data to locate and characterize gas bubble plumes being emitted from the sea floor. In 2016, Susan located and characterized more than 900 previously unknown methane gas plumes rising from the sea floor along the Cascadia continental margin (offshore Washington, Oregon, and northern California) using the multibeam sonar system on board the E/V Nautilus, tripling the number of known methane seeps along the western U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\n\nFor the creation and use of a new moored buoy system to provide accurate and timely warning information on tsunamis.\n\nNote: The Gold Medal is granted for distinguished contributions and is the highest honorary recognition bestowed by the Department of Commerce. Because so many people contributed to this success, the Gold Medal is presented as an organizational award."
