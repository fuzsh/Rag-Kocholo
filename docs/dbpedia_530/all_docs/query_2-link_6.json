This small, select recognition society was created to honor non-alumni for their outstanding contributions to the School either through dedicated work as faculty and staff or through outstanding volunteer support.\n\nCandidates with appropriate qualifications will be selected from the following three groups:\n\nFaculty and Staff: Those individuals who work consistently and effectively in improving the quality of life at the School whether by inspiring students to develop intellectual curiosity and to become leaders, or by contributing, often behind the scenes, to the internal functioning of the School.\n\nParents: Those individuals who give of themselves to help make Ravenscroft School a better institution. Frequently, conviction and tenacity are the characteristics that underlie the effectiveness of the parents selected.\n\nFriends: Those individuals whose efforts greatly influence the direction, policies, and growth of the School. Often the recognition of accomplishment is visible over a long period of time due to the unglamorous nature of the contributions.\n\nNominees are not to be judged by the number of letters of recommendation, but by their merit and outstanding service to the School. The recommendations must be submitted in writing and state, in a paragraph or two, the reasons for the nomination. Nomination forms are available on the web site. Members will only be added to the class when qualified candidates are nominated and may not happen every year.\n\nSelection will be done by a committee composed of the President of the Alumni Council and two members of the Council chosen by him/her, the Head of School, one other faculty member, the Director of Institutional Advancement, and the Director of Alumni Giving and Programs.\n\n2024- Doreen Kelly\n\n2023- Phil Higginson\n\n2017- Michelle Piette and Carol Miedema\n\n2015- Martha Janes\n\n2009- Lewis “Snow” Holding\n\n2009- Frances P. Pugh\n\n2007- Barbara Jean Warren\n\n2006- Cherie Fowler\n\n2002- Bruce G. Miller\n\n2000- George F. Joyner"
