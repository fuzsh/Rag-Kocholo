I told her I could take the subway but she insisted on taking me there by car. We had a little breakfast, then loaded on to the train to settle down for a 28-hour long trip. I sat with Tim, Sandra and Joerg, and wrote most of the day, and slept none. We took a ferry to Copenhagen (Helsingor) and had about an hour there which I spent with Mary walking around.\n\nThe next train took us clear to Hamburg where we switched to a sleeper cabin. In the sleeper cabin, I was with Roger, Doug, Shawn, Chris and Ross and after everyone settled down we actually went to sleep.\n\nAfter lunch the Fishing Club met and talked about our responsibilities as a Christian in the USSR. Really good talk.\n\nEDITOR: I was trying to have everyone write a little something in my journal toward the end of the year. Here are a few that were written on June 2nd.\n\nDear Grant\n\nWell guess I'll just have to settle for being the second one to sign this, really want to thank you for having the guts to stand up in Bartlesville & ask the Christians to meet. It was so encouraging to find brothers and sisters in Christ in this cast. I'm glad we've had a chance to have a few talks this year and hope we will have a chance for some more.\n\nYou are really a fun, humorous teddy bear and I can't, believe you're only 20! I really pray that you will continue to grown in our Lord and to share his love with the folks you go back to and meet in college. J\n\nIt's too bad we don't have clowns in the show anymore, cuz you made a great ring master; you're also a great dancer. I'll always remember performing all the way on the other side of the stadium with you & Julie in Stockholm (you made me wanna SHOUT!)\n\nBest of luck in college & your future & come visit me in L.A. some time:\n\nIn his love,\n\nSandra Jung\n\n6/2/88\n\nDear Grant!\n\nIt was really great to have you in our cast. Unfortunately we roomed only once together in Campbellsville, but I remember this very well, when our host mother tried to find out where the girls in the magic trick came from. You were a great ring master.\n\nI also want to thank you for starting the fishing club. It was a concern for me at the beginning of the year if I will find other Christians or not. But I'm very happy I did.\n\nSo I wish you the best for your future and if you ever come to Germany you're welcome to visit me.\n\nGod bless you\n\nJorg Hatermaas\n\n6/2/88\n\nGrant\n\nHey there big guy, you're a dear friend to me & always will be. I still remember our conversation in Tucson when we went shopping in the mall. Now I look at what we've become & can only smile. I'll miss you my friend but look forward to seeing you again. Never stop looking for more ways to be a Christian to make friends & to be humble. Life has so many opportunities take as many as possible. Best of luck in all you do! God Bless!\n\nI¹ll miss you!\n\nLove,\n\nCassi Kuck\n\n6/3/88 Friday Lucerne, Switzerland\n\nFor some reason, they woke us up at 6:30 a.m. even though our ride did not end until 9:00. I tried to stomach breakfast, but couldn't do it. We stopped in Basel, Switzerland for a short time then on to Lucerne. The scenery was just awesomely breathtaking and I finally saw the Swiss Alps and they still had a lot of snow on them for being June.\n\nWhen we finally got to Lucerne, we had a meeting by a lake (where the Wilhelm story took place) then free time to enjoy the weather. We walked around until we had to go to the hotel, but in the process, we stopped by and saw a great castle/fortress which had a fantastic view of Lucerne. Then picked up our stuff and went to the hotel to check in. We were split into two different groups. We only had enough time to check in then go to lunch.\n\nWe rehearsed for a while on this incredible stage that had neon lights, moving stairs, and a water fountain, but did a lot of sitting around. After dinner, we had the rest of the evening free, so Randy and I sat in the room and talked.\n\nINPIRATIONAL MOTIVATION\n\nFrom Darci Buck-Price\n\nHi Grant!!\n\nJust dug up my USSR journal. I'll include some of it here if you want to just cut/paste and add to your entries it would be cool maybe this month to promote that we want to have EVERYONE dig up their journals and then you can just copy and paste as many as possible into your journal emails!! TRUE HISTORY!!! Hopefully we're on the same page. If you need my help I am SOOOO willing to help you in any way!! I know that it is A LOT of workbut copy/paste is pretty easy!!! (plus that would get them into their pictures and memorablia and maybe get even MORE to the reunion!!!!) There is something therapeutic and nostalgic about reading my journal(s)-it brings me RIGHT BACK to that day. Let's encourage it!!\n\nTHANKS GRANT!!\n\nTalk soon!\n\nDarci\n\n(EDITOR: So I am encouraging it. If you will dig out your Soviet journals, pictures, memories, I will send them along with my journal entries and Darci's beginning on June 6th. This will be a great way to hear what other people experienced in the Soviet Union and have one last push to get more people to the reunion. Thanks! Grant\n\n6/4/88 Saturday Lucerne, Switzerland\n\nThis morning we were served breakfast by the Key Master/Dragon Lady. She had a fit when we started sharing our rolls with each other. It was actually pretty funny.\n\nToday was a rainy, yucky day, so I'm sure glad we got to enjoy the beauty of Lucerne yesterday. We went to the performance hall at 9:00 a.m. and did stretch and worked on Russian words until we finally went on at 1:00. We did Sunrise and Up With People in 5 languages then went to lunch.\n\nThey ran out of food for Steve Ellis and I, so we had to wait, and finally got our food when everyone was getting up to leave. We rehearsed for 2 hours for the evening performance, blocking and running it. I was kind of bumming because I was really looking forward to dancing '50's but once again no dice Jack! When we finished, we wrapped up then went to dinner.\n\nWe had 3 hours to kill so we ate dinner, and hung around the hotel. The evening performance was 40 minutes long, but we did not have the production with video screens and the such like this morning. After the show, we had a chance to mingle and I met some really nice people from Ireland. I had a couple glasses of wine; was able to get 2 bottles to take back to the hotel; tried to call home; went back to the hotel and a bunch of us drank the wine and partied a little bit.\n\n6/6/88 Monday - Lapeeranta, Finland\n\nWe didn't have to go until 11:00 a.m., but my family woke me up at 8:45, although I still didn't move until 10:00 a.m. I couldn't believe they woke me up that early after not going to bed until 3:00 a.m. Then they just stood at my door and stared at me.\n\nWhen I finally got up, we tried to converse, but it was very difficult because they don't know English very well and my Finnish is a little rusty. Okay, non-existent.\n\nThe morning started with Carlos introducing Bruce Early who talked about all the media they have contacted: ABC, NBC, UPI, AP, New York Time, Chicago Tribune and all media that has a base in Russia. They also contacted everyone's hometown newspaper and every major affiliate possible.\n\nNext Ralph Caldwell spoke to us about the film crew and introduced them. He told us how they went about deciding who should film us and what personality would be our host. Before deciding on Mary Hart , they had checked into Marilyn McCoo and Casey Kasem to be our host. It will be put all together then be for sale in September or August to TV stations around the U.S. McDonald's and Coke (Coca-Cola) has expressed interest in being the sponsor which will make it sell even better. It is incredible the marketing that is involved in doing this. Ralph also promised that we would each get a copy of it. I won't hold my breath! (EDITOR: It took me editing it together years later to make it happen. It never did air on TV)\n\nWhen he was finished, Birger announced that his video will be fore sale in early fall.\n\nWe ate lunch, then had 50 minutes to go to town to get last minute things. I bought two 1 liters of Coke and 2 packages of crackers (the same for Kurt). Right before I got on the bus, I bought an ice cream cone, and when I put on my sunglasses, the ice cream fell off the cone onto the ground. They gave me another one for free and I laughed, but Cassi didn't find it very funny.\n\nWhen we got back, we did an incredible fitness then worked on the dance for Footloose. I danced with Lisa and was pretty impressed how quickly I picked it up. It is a fun dance to do, following that we went in and rehearsed the Russian words, and blocked it into the show. It is a lot of hard work, but it is starting to become a reality.\n\nI met Pauli and Arja (my host parents) afterwards to have a picnic dinner along with all the host families. Tony was pretty wild so after I showed them my Colorado information I went in and started getting ready for the show. We actually did almost the whole show with all Russian MC's, so it was kind of like a Russian dress rehearsal.\n\nThe show went pretty well, but the Russian songs were still weak. Everyone was sweating profusely because it was so hot, in fact, I think I have never sweated so much as I did tonight.\n\nAfter the show, I got out of the strike to get my hair cut by Deedra. Cecilia cut a little more off the back but it was sure nice to have all that hair gone.\n\nI was picked up about 10:15, went home and proceeded to wash clothes, repack down to two bags, took a shower, and did a lot of writing. Went to bed about 1:30 a.m.\n\nBONUS JOURNAL\n\nFrom Darci Buck-Price\n\nJune 6, 1988\n\nThe production team of 7 just joined our cast. It's 3:30 a.m. and I'm wide awake- white nights here in Helsinki. We go to the USSR tomorrow!!! Long awaited day for Cast A of UWP.\n\nDarci\n\nTuesday, June 7th , 1988 (leaving Finland for USSR)\n\nPoost fsehg-DA BOO-det SONN-tseh!\n\nIt was a weird feeling because it kind of felt like another travel day, but not. When I hung up the phone with my parents I said, I got to go. Im going to Russia in an hour. We took an official cast picture in front of the truck, and Hans said that Mr. Belk called to wish us luck one more time this morning then we hopped on the bus.\n\nWe finally walked our luggage through the inspection. They took a long time on me, and were talking back and forth. I think the beard may have concerned them because my passport is completely different. It was actually kind of scary. It is a weird feeling to be watched so long and hard.\n\nWe eventually left the border about 2:30, which means almost 5 hours at the border. Wow! It is now beginning to soak in that I am in Russia.\n\nThe landscape is very pretty, and a lot like Colorado, but more water. Mostly pine trees but also there are a lot of aspen trees. Different than what I expected, but my preconceived image was soon confirmed when we passed by a compound with many, many tanks covered up.\n\nWhen we drove into the first city (Vyborg), it was like driving into the 1950s and 60s. Lunch was a salad (tomatoes & cucumbers) soup, steak (?) and potatoes, then a delicious ice cream. After lunch I made my first adventure into a Soviet bathroom, and it was scary. It was very dirty, smelly and the toilets had no seats. Luckily I didnt have to sit down, but I will have to eventually.\n\neventually (after doing a small performance of UWP and We Wish You Happiness) we got back in the sauna on wheels. I could not sleep because of the heat, so I wrote, read and talked to pass the next 3 hours on the way to Leningrad.\n\nDinner was amazing! There was caviar (black and orange), ham, roast beef (?), cucumbers, salami, salads, and little daisies made of eggs and carrots in the middle. It was incredible, but most importantly, there was lots of Pepsi to drink! Yeah! It was so hot and I was sooo thirsty. I practically downed one bottle instantly. We ate all we could eat, did a little dancing, then realized the main course was coming. Ooops, no room in the stomach. Little more dancing with Gretchen then some ice cream. When we were finished we sang UWP (Russian) for the Sputnick people, and congratulated a newly wed couple.\n\nBack to the hotel. Denis had to collect our passports in order to get our room assignment. Room 737 with Brett Flood will be my home for the next few days. I brushed my teeth (another challenging task) with my water bottle. I think I am going to really be ready to go home after these two weeks because even after one day I missed some of the luxuries or givens like getting cold water from the sink, and being able to drink it and not worry. Getting an ice cold coke on any corner and just in general western conveniences. I finally went to bed around 2:30 after writing in my journal.\n\n6/10/88  Friday\n\nMy morning started abruptly at 5:45 a.m with a phone call from Brett Flood. He asked me to look through his bag and find his Euro-rail pass, 100 kroner and his passport. I told him his passport was with the staff and then asked him what he needed it for. He wouldnt tell me, but I still couldnt find his stuff. I told him when we were leaving and that he better be there, and he hung up. I dont know what the problem was, but I went back to bed. I couldnt sleep very well, so I was up in plenty of time to get my stuff into the bus.\n\nAfter breakfast we made an official presentation to the Leningrad Sputnik people. We gave them some records and cast picture, then went on our jolly way to Kalinin. It was about a 10 hour trip and very bumpy. I was in the very last row sitting with Lena, Randy, Wynand and Lynda. I laid on the ground in the back on the floor and I woke up to a wet shirt. Something had spilled, and as it turned out a bottle in my bag had broken and spilled.\n\nWe arrived in Kalinin at 7:00pm, had the bread and salt ceremony, sang UWP once and checked into the hotel. Something I noticed while we were singing UWP in Russian is that none of the Big Wigs know it. I thought that was awful ironic being they are always asking us to sing it, and want to look good for the camera.\n\nWe did dinner then relaxed by just sitting around talking and later playing cards. While we were talking some guys came into our room, wanting to trade a Russian record for an American tape. They did not speak English very well, so I was having a little fun with them since they wouldnt leave. I asked them if they knew John Denver and they said Yes, isnt he heavy metal? We said Yes, thats him. And started laughing. Eventually they left and we did our thing.\n\n6/11/88  Saturday\n\nWe met this morning at 8:30, but we didnt get up until 8:00. I wanted to take a shower, but the water was ice cold so I was only able to handle washing my hair. Breakfast, like all the other meals was a challenge to swallow, but I made sure I ate a lot of bread. After breakfast, Carlos held a meeting and passed out schedules (in Russian Cyrillic), then told us what they meant. When he was finished, Bruce Early had some quotes that he read off, and Paul Caldwell reminded us of how historic our being here is and how We are paving the way for future generations.\n\nAfter the meeting, we loaded the buses to go on a tour around Kalinin for 1 hour. We watched this ceremony at this one monument for WWII veterans, and those who gave their lives. It was strange because they had an eternal flame and from the flame it had the sound of a heartbeat. It was eerie and reminded me of Bill Cosbys The Chicken Heart. When the kids walked down the stairs and stood their post, the clock chimed 11:00, and the heartbeat changed to Tchaikovskys music. Hearing his music after seeing the Soviet Union, it kind of explains why his music was so somber.\n\nRight before the ceremony we saw a newlywed couple come and lay some flowers on the stone next to the flame. Al (Bias) and I analyzed it and decided since they dont worship God, they still need to show respect and have a specific ceremony. In order to do this they must go lay flowers on memorials of their fallen soldiers. Kind of strange, but makes sense (if in fact it is true). We continued our tour a little longer then ended up at this peace march (Wave of Peace). The Group I was in watched a bunch of dances performed by kids. They were really good and had some neat costumes. When they were finished, we performed a few songs, and tried to teach the audience UWP at the end of our show. Imagine a bunch of English speaking people trying to teach Russian to a Russian crowd that has never heard of UWP before. It was quite hysterical and pretty useless in my opinion. When we were done there we went down the street a little way and did another show. I stayed off to watch peoples stuff, and after the performance they started asking us questions about the USSR. They asked how many provinces there were and what was the first impression of Soviet people. They were pretty intense questions, and then they asked if we had any questions for them. Katrin asked them what their feelings were between East and West Germany were, and I dont think anyone ever did answer it.\n\nAfter we were quizzed, I asked if I could have one of the posters on the truck/stage that had an American flag and USSR flag circling around the world. They told me I could have it, and when I came down, some guys approached me. One guy gave me this great set of peace posters, and the other two gave me pins, and I gave them an UWP button. We left soon after to go to lunch.\n\nLunch was not that good, but I had a fantastic conversation with Almendra about the big Mexico City earthquake. She went practically minute by minute of how it affected her and her family. It was really an intense conversation and I really appreciate the fact that I am in an international group, but felt sad that soon I will not be able to turn to my neighbor and ask how this affected their lives in another country.\n\nFrom there we went to a kind of camp, where we tried to mingle and participate in their activities. I had a hard time getting into it, but tried to get involved with Stacie, Birger and Kurt. We tried to communicate with this one family/group of people, with success but it was very difficult.\n\nOn the way back to the hotel for dinner we watched part of The Golden Child on video on the bus. We had a very quick dinner because we were going on a boat cruise from 7 until 10pm. Elin and I had a nice talk walking to the boat, to try and get caught up on each others lives. Before the boat left, a good song came on and Lynda and I did a country swing. She has definitely gotten better during the course of the year. I think the cameras were filming us. It would be interesting to see how we looked. I hope they put some in the show.\n\nThe rest of the evening we all (or a lot of us) were upstairs of the boat. It was raining, but we had a top over us and still had the fresh air. I danced a lot with Kelly Bates and really had fun with her. Half way through we had some Russian folk dancing performed for us by both a pair of adults and 2 pair of children. It was pretty good. The lady had on a very sexy revealing dress during the numbers so it was hard to concentrate on their dancing. (Editors note: This is the event that made me decide to teach ballroom dance once we returned to our homes after the year was over. It obviously made an impression on me.)\n\nAt the end of the boat trip, I was talking with Paula and Melinda and they said some very nice things about me. They called me kind, cute and a fatherly figure. I walked back to the hotel with Melinda, in the rain, and we had a nice talk. The rest of the evening was spent talking with Stacie, eventually raiding her room when she was asleep and also getting into Pias room. It was kind of fun, like being in college again.\n\n6/12/88  Sunday\n\nBreakfast was close to being edible, because it was eggs (or that is at least what it looked like). We went straight to the hall to set up at 9:45 and we were finished by 12:30. I was on truck crew with Terry, Matt, Darci, Kira and Jeff so we were done when we finished unloading the truck. We talked a while out in the truck because they were filming us talking.\n\nFor lunch, we were treated real special; we got 6 or 7 cookies and chocolate. No meat and nothing really substantial to eat. This day of all days in my life I have missed a Big Mac and Coke more than anything in the world.\n\nAfter lunch we had stretch then dress rehearsal with full costumes for the cameras. They wanted to get close up shots of people and dances without affecting the show for the audience. It was a real challenge to keep the energy level very high, and not getting any feedback from an audience. We filmed several songs (none that directly affected me), but while we did The Proverb Song the first time I was in the front row behind the soloists. Mia decided she wanted a pretty face up front so she put Amy Roth there and moved me behind Brenda Borgnes and Susie. When we finally ran it, I stayed on the nine so I could see and be seen. We ran Gospel four times which became real old trying to be excited for no one.\n\nWe had a quick wrap up after rehearsal then went to dinner back at the hotel. It was very quick, then back at 6:30 for a show at 7:00. During Green room, we all stood in two lines and sang When the Saints Go Marching in and Swing Lo at each other. Then we all got in a circle to listen to a tape of Irma, we circled up, and we all divided into groups by what color shirt we had on. We couldnt list to all of Irma because we had to go on stage. People tried to sidestep the fact that this is our last two-hour show so that we could still have a good show without crying.\n\nThe show went really well although I was not into it very much. Especially The Sunshine Song and The Proverb Song (with a non-rehearsed reprise), in fact they liked it so much they asked us to come back and do another show tomorrow. They asked us this at the end of the encores, unbeknownst to any of us. After a little bit of mingling we had a quick meeting to tell us we were doing another show tomorrow.\n\nWe went back to the hotel and sat in our room and talked with Heidi, Deedra, Brenda, Lynda, Bill, and Matt. I finally went to bed around 1:00 a.m.\n\n6/13/88  Monday\n\nWe totally missed breakfast altogether and spent from 9:00 - 9:45 getting ready for the day. On the way to the Palace of Pioneers, our bus hit a trolley car that stopped in the middle of the road. We were trying to go around it so the side of the bus (one luggage door up to the window) was pretty dented.\n\nThe Palace of Pioneers was not like a camp like I was expecting, but more like a summer school for boys/girls scouts. We first received some history of the building from some 13 or 14 year old girls, then took a tour that ended up in a room they were all waiting in for us. We sat in rows across the table from each other and asked questions back and forth through a translator. They sang one song. We sang Peace, we both sang Happiness and Sunshine Song together. When we were finished we signed their guest address book. It was an okay time but rather strange. We went back to the hotel for lunch that I couldnt handle, so I left to go to the tourist store. Unfortunately, many people had the same idea so there was a long line. I bought a couple of bottles of vodka to take home, and a six pack of Coke that cost me $13.00 dollars.\n\nI made it back just in time to catch the bus to rehearsal at 1:30, but I had to savor one of those Cokes on the way. We went through some transitions of the new rundown until about 3:30, gave us 15 minutes to change and get make-up on and be in greenroom. Greenroom was very quick, but included a man playing the accordion.\n\nThe show started about 4:15 after all the stuff Hans goes through at the beginning to tell about UWP and then have to translate it. I did a lot of screwing around during this show. I hopped on a mic for 80s with Leanne, then at the end of the show I skipped out of the Russian songs so I could put on an international costume. I ended up putting on Mokus old costume and a bandana around my head, and became Japanese for a couple songs: Unfinished World and UWP. I was even in the UWP line. Mia stood right behind me on stage and asked me why I was wearing that costume. She was laughing but I dont think she was too happy, but I really dont care. I ran off for the encores because I didnt want to be on stage for all those presentations at the end.\n\nBy the time they shut up and I got changed and on the truck it was 6:15pm, but things didnt really come out to the truck until 6:30. After we got going, we made pretty good time and were finished by 8:00pm. We are supposed to have finished and eaten by 7:30 to go meet a family to go home with for the evening. When strike was done, they had some Cokes waiting for us. (I just remember that the film crew filmed strike also. Cool!)\n\nWe went back to the hotel, washed up a little, changed clothes, and went downstairs to meet a family. Monique Balsinger grabbed me as I walked out and asked me to come with here, and I said I would.\n\nPaul and the father (head of the house) were there to pick us up, and we walked to their house on the other side of the Volga River. When we arrived they had a fantastic spread of food out, but also lots of mouths to feed. There were eleven people other than Monique and I and a collie (dog). Dinner conversation started slow, but between Paul (English translator) and one of the other guys, who knew German, we managed pretty well. I asked them what they thought of America, and they had really not heard much. They asked me of what I thought about Russia before I came, and I said onion top cathedrals and Siberia. They asked me a lot about my school, and a lot of questions about UWP. We talked about Communism and Capitalism (which they dont know much about either one). I said the main difference was that in our society The harder you work, the more you can get. Here everyone works for the good of everything, and there is no motivation to do better. During this whole conversation we drank champagne, and had many toasts with Georgian vodka.\n\nAfter dinner, the guys sat down and played Beatles songs and I tried to sing along. They also played some Russian songs for me, and when that got old, I pulled out all my Colorado stuff and pictures to show them. They seemed very interested in looking at where I am from and my family. We did that for about an hour and when we were finished I taught Olga how to country swing (or at least I tried). It was pretty funny because she had no concept of what to do, but considering this she still did well. We took some pictures had some dessert and started exchanging gifts. They gave me some postcards, this banner, a little I.D. book and a cassette tape of Russian music. Also various pins, cards, posters, and picture of a building they designed (They are architects). We presented them with a UWP record signed by Monique and me and UWP buttons to each of them. After one more toast (that I made) with some strong Russian vodka we left to walk back to the hotel. This last toast was several gulps of vodka, and definitely put me into the pleasantly buzzed category. Almost everyone walked back with us to the hotel except for Mom and Dad. It was surprisingly hard to leave. It is amazing how people could become so close, so quickly and not even speak the same language. It was a fantastic evening and I am so glad I went there. I felt I finally got a clear view of what Soviet life was really all about. I didnt get back to the hotel until about 1:30am and packed until about 2:15 when I went to bed.\n\n6/14/88  Tuesday\n\nWe loaded the buses first before we went to breakfast, and afterwards we did our presentations to Sputnik and took an official cast picture\n\nMy bus date was Diane and we worked on the statistics until the movie The Bedroom Window was put on the TVs in the bus. We watched that and figured out the number of shows and hours on a bus. We arrived at our hotel about 2:00 and went through our bread ceremonies, did The Proverb Song and UWP, then went to lunch. It was a fantastic meal (for once), and everyone just went wild.\n\nAfter lunch we got our luggage, and checked into our room. I got into my suit and tie and met Christine Dorn and Ahmet Rhineike downstairs in the lobby. We took off on bus 87 to the Bolshoi Theater where we got off and walked to the Kremlin. As we walked up the hill (it took us 15 minutes to figure out how to cross the street) into Red Square you could see the top of the cathedral. That is the one thing that I have always thought of when I thought of Russia. It was the most awesome feeling in my lifetime. I felt like I was walking into a postcard and for the first time I really felt like I was in the heart of the Soviet Union. Wow! I think I will never forget that picture in Red Square.\n\nWe stood there for a while looking around and trying to get into the Kremlin. We finally started walking and ended up by the tomb of the unknown soldier. When we realized we were not anywhere near where we were supposed to be, we asked a police officer where to go. I had asked the guides earlier in the day to write, in Cyrillic, the place where Gorbachev lived. I showed the officer and he tried to explain where to go but he spoke no English or German, but some passer-byes stopped to help us because he spoke German. Im sure glad Christine came because between the two of us we managed pretty well.\n\nAfter asking several policemen along the way, we finally made it to the building the guides had written down for me. We started to walk in and were stopped by a man standing outside. He didnt speak English or German so he went inside to get someone else, but the person he got was another man who could not speak either English or German. After trying to explain what we wanted and he had no clue, he took us down the street about a block and a half to another building. We went into the lobby before you get to the security checkpoint, and the man went to get someone else. He came back with someone who does speak English, and we gave him the UWP spiel (explanation of what UWP is). After about 5 minutes the guys asked us to wait a minute and 5 minutes later he came back with another man who spoke English.\n\nWe told him why we were there (to invite Mr. Gorbachev to our show) and told him who we were (that we were an international group spreading peace through understanding). I explained to him that we felt UWP is breaking the ice for the Reagan/Gorbachev student exchange program by being such an international group. He said Well you realize that Mr. Gorbachev is a very busy man. I said, I understand that, but I would not be here if I didnt think this was important. We talked a little bit longer with him only being mildly interested until we finally mentioned that our sponsor was Sputnik. He seemingly became much more interested once we told him that Sputnik was responsible for bringing us to the USSR. He said Why then did not an official Sputnik representative ask Mr. Gorbachev to attend the show? I replied Both Sputnik and UWP has sent official telegrams to him, but we thought it would be better and more sincere if we came and invited him in person\n\nAt the end of the conversation he said, The best I can do is try and get him a message from you and have him get in touch with you. So Christine pulled out a business card and I put my name on the back. I also showed him our hotel card and he wrote down the name, my room number and when we would be leaving, and said he would try either way to tell us.\n\nIt was a disappointing ending, but more or less what I expected. I felt at least we tried and had fun doing it. Besides how many people in Colorado Springs can say they tried to talk with General Secretary Gorbachev in person.\n\nWe went back to the hotel for dinner and the rest of the evening was free. Some people went to the walking street at night, but I stayed in my room trying to get caught up with my journal.\n\n6/15/88  Wednesday\n\nToday after breakfast, we had another one of those fantastic bus tours. I was dead tired so I slept most of the time which I just hate doing but couldnt keep my eyes open. The first 2 times the buses stopped I didnt even get out. The third place was at Moscow University which was cool, then an overlook of the Olympic Stadium and also looked into an Orthodox church. When our bus tour was finished, we went to stand in line for Lenins Mausoleum and on the way half of us put flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It took less than 30 minutes to get to the Lenin Mausoleum from a pretty good distance away. The guards, however, were constantly making people get as close together as possible and keep moving. You had to walk within the lines and in pairs, as you turned the corner you had to close your jacket, women had to wear shirts with sleeves, you could not have your hands in your pocket, cross your arms or hold someone elses hand. Jerko had his arms crossed inside the structure and they pulled them apart and down to his side. We laid flowers outside next to the entrance just before we entered. Staying in groups of two in a single file line, we went down about 3 flights of stairs. The inside was made of black marble (not like the red outside) and was kind of cold inside. I was not expecting to go downstairs because I figured that is why it is so tall above ground level. It gave the image that we were going down to see a jewel.\n\nWhen we got to the bottom of the stairs, we turned right for about 4 feet, then walked up about six stairs that led you on to the platform that went around the glass case that contained Lenins body. The lighting in there was very smooth, soft light just on the body. He was covered in a black velvet blanket and raised at a slight angle. His right hand was in a fist and left hand flat. It looked wax, as everyone says, but his beard/goatee was not very well trimmed so maybe it grew after he died. We had about a total of 30 seconds to walk on 3 of the four sides of his glass case, down the platform, up the 3 flights of stairs and out. The whole mausoleum experience lasted less than 3 or 4 minutes from entrance to exit with 16 guards inside to protect a dead body. This was a memorable experience I think I will not soon forget. It was a very morbid, weird thing we did than hundreds of thousands do every year.\n\nWhen we were out, we walked along a path with plaques of dead soldiers who were of some political power. Then lastly you walk by all the graves of the past General Secretaries (except Krushchev) and a stone bust of them. We ended back up in Red Square where the Mausoleum had just closed at one oclock, so Leanne and I took a Reds in Red Square photo as well as all redheads in Red Square picture. We also took an official cast picture with the cathedral in the background.\n\nWe started walking to where the buses were but several of us stopped to get a picture of Kurt and the back of the cathedral, which is the picture on the sweatshirt. While we stood there, this guy in a black car came speeding by us. I pulled Kurt back and right after that, it skidded to stop, but hit Doug in the process. It only hit him hard enough to knock him in the air a little and off his feet. The guy who hit him hardly got out of his car, and when Doug got up and we were trying to get him out of the way, the guy started honking his horn. He was so rude, I couldnt believe it. We then went to the buses to go to lunch. Lunch was late so we missed out on the Kremlin, so instead we had about 45 minutes of free time on the walking street. I found these wall hanging hot plate holders and a little wooden box for my Mom and Penny.\n\nWe went to dinner and then to a car museum of Ladas. It was a joke because the cars are ugly to begin with, but also were in terrible condition. One of the cars had a windshield wiper missing and most were scratched. After about 45 minutes of complete boredom we loaded the bus and went to another facility. Once we got there we sat in the audience and watched two performances. One of a man who plays guitar and harmonica, and was rather funny (interpreted). The second was weird, but cool of a mime acting out the world being blown up. Right after him we went backstage, had a 10 minute greenroom/warm-up, then did a 20-minute Toa show. It was extremely hard to do, but we actually pulled it off. People were really dragging today (literally and figuratively) due to little sleep, being on a bus all day, and several people being sick.\n\nAfterwards we had a light dinner (2 open faced sandwiches and a Pepsi) and there was a disco, but about 6 of us sat around and talked. It was good because I explained about the time capsule and Laurie told of a chain letter she wanted to start. It would go from person to person and each person was required to write something about what is happening in your life and sending it on to the next person on the list. I hope she does it and it works.\n\nAs soon as they announced that the buses were leaving, we all hopped up and hurried out to the buses to go back to the hotel. We really didnt do much back at the hotel, but I was anxious to get back and relax.\n\n6/16/88  Thursday\n\nToday is (was) a rainy, soaking wet day. We broke into four groups in the morning, but after breakfast they changed it into 3 groups. (set up crew couldnt setup today.) One group (my group) went to Lenins Library and the other two went to Pioneer Palace.\n\nWe finally got to the library at 11:10, but the guide had gone to lunch and would be back in 10 minutes. We waited in the lobby until 11:50 and then we went on a weak-ass tour that lasted until 12:40. I dont think I saw anymore of the library than if I would not have gone.\n\nWe went to lunch, then had the option of going to the monastery or to a Beriaska (tourist, hard currency) shop. They were at the same place, so a lot of people did both or tried in the 45 minute we had. At the shop I finished getting all my gifts: Dad- chocolate and candy, Scott  a box; Brett  chess set; for everyone a bottle of champagne and a bottle of vodka. I also bought a book on Moscow for myself and the family ( and had the whole cast sign it.) The book was $17.00 (10.30 rubles) and the rest of the stuff was $38.00, so I spent almost $60.00 Ouch! It will be worth it though. (Editor: What a big spender I was!)\n\nFrom there we went back to the hotel to get ready for a folk music concert we were going to and have dinner. The concert was at the Cosmos Hotel, an awesome tourist hotel, in the theater there. It was really neat because the orchestra consisted of all guitar-like instruments, percussion and large glockenspiels The instruments sounded like they were from the same family as the mandolin. It was nice to be on the receiving end of a performance for a change. They had a few singers perform with them that were pretty good, especially one lady. I think the thing I liked best, however, was the way they ended. On the last song instruments just started leaving by ones and in small groups waving to the conductor as they left. It was done really classy, and was a really cool way to finish. Some people went backstage after the performance to meet some people in the orchestra. I went back to the hotel, riding with Laurie, and when we got there, the door was locked and the key was gone. We knew Doug was in the room and our bet was that Holly was with him and we were right. (Editor: I wonder what they were doing??)\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent running around checking out the scene, but ended up going to bed around midnight.\n\n6/17/88  Friday\n\n(Here comes that rainy day feeling again!) Today we split into several groups to go different ways. They did this at breakfast right after they introduced a girl from Lithuania who wants to travel in UWP and then introduced Mary Hart. I was actually a little disappointed, but I really dont know what I was expecting. She is very pretty, but not the Knock-out that I remember from TV. Terry and all the other people with titles sat at her table and Im sure Terry let her know that she slept in his bed when he was 2 years old.\n\nMy group went to the armory then the Kremlin, and others did the following; 20 did the Kremlin, and then the armory; 30 went to Pace talk conference with Mary Hart; 40 set up. The armory was really interesting, but I didnt enjoy walking with the tour guide because I could not hear her. So, I did a self-guided tour, bur checking in occasionally with the group. Now I am really glad I got the book because it has some fantastic pictures in the armory.\n\nWhen we were done there, we went to the Kremlin, but all we did was walk into a cathedral for a while then left. Dek, Meg and I got into it a little more, and got left behind, but caught up soon afterwards. Then we got on the buses and went to lunch. It was a relatively good tour, but very wet at the Kremlin.\n\nAt lunch I spent a little time talking with Hal Brown about doing commercials. It was really interesting and I really felt that is what I wanted to do. I actually got excited about doing that as a possible profession. I asked him about internships and he said yes they do them and to give him a call when I get back to the states. Although he was answering my questions, he seemed in a hurry the whole time and he kind of talked over me.\n\nAfter lunch I made arrangements with Cassi to go to the Cosmos Hotel with her, to pick up some posters, but she left while Randy and I introduced ourselves to Mary Hart. So Randy and I went to try and invite Gorby to the show again, but ended up talking with this guy for about 20 minutes. We talked mostly in circles, but he was impressed how Americans make an effort to try and make positive contact.\n\nWhen we were finished at the Central Committee building we went to Russias, actually the Soviet Unions, largest and best shopping mall called Gumm (pronounced Goom). It was rather large but we only walked down one hallway on one floor. The shops were almost like the flea market where you stand at the counter, point at something you would like a closer look, then put it back or buy it. You never touch the merchandise except when you look at it and again when it is wrapped. If you decide you want to buy it you must take a slip to the cashier, pay for it, she gives you a receipt, then you go back for the wrapped package and get to pick it up by either showing the receipt or giving it to her.\n\nWe rode the bus back to the hotel, after getting a picture of the water machines, and finding out that a whole string of taxis had no time to take us to the hotel. They werent busy, but it seems to me they only work when they want to.\n\nI got back to the hotel, showered and got ready to go to this Sputnik dinner. It was a pretty nice dinner and we even got to pop a bottle of champagne and toast to several things. We did a lot of dancing and just tried to have fun. It made me think of how the end of the year banquet would be. I actually only danced with Gretchen, Brenda La Mica and Corinne. I rode back to the hotel with Kurt, Gretchen and Nanette. When we got back to the hotel I walked Gretchen back to her room. Almendra gave me a Mexico pin and then Gretchen walked me to the door. I stopped her in the little hallway between the bedroom and door and gave her a kiss. Gretchen is a pretty good kisser. (Editor: Maybe she was my destiny? Must have made enough of an impression as to want to eventually marry her. :) )\n\nI went back and changed and went to Dougs b-day party in #1401. At midnight when we sang Happy B-Day and popped the champagne, and when that had happened I went up to Leannes room (1522) to see her surprise party. I sat there for 10-15 minutes then went back down to Dougs. Deedra grabbed me however, and wanted me to go trading with her. So I followed her and we told everybody that we came in contact with that there was someone in a red shirt and jean jacket with a knife that had stolen some stuff from Rita and Monique. (Editor: hmmm, dont remember what this was about.)\n\nWe wandered around for a while, but I went to bed abut 1:30.\n\n6/18/88  Saturday\n\nAfter another Breakfast with Mary we loaded the buses to go to rehearsal, while some people went shopping with Mary. The performance hall is a sports area/ice rink that holds 35,000 people, and is pretty impressive. The stage went length wise and had our full stage and another stage for other bands facing one half of the arena. It was an awesome sight to see, but they were still building a structure behind our stage when we got there. I spent the whole morning working on costumes with Mary Huckins, Diane, Lena and Deedra. I didnt really do much, but hang up the costumes after they were ironed. We did, however, enjoy reminiscing about the year and talking about different things that have happened to each of us. We all went to lunch at the hotel, and had a little time to get stuff pulled together for the show tonight.\n\nWhen we went back for rehearsal we ran several things with costumes on so the camera could film. We had time to get ready for our first appearance on stage and eat a sack dinner before greenroom. At greenroom we had a quick few words from some people, but did not have much time before we went on.\n\nThe first segment of the show was all the performers on stage doing one song and jamming out. When we were done, we had an hour and 15 minutes to wait before we went on, so the fishing club got together for a while. Henry did most of the talking about his experiences in the hospital in Leningrad. It was pretty scary some of the things he was saying about the isolation ward he was in and the food he was served. It was really eye-opening for me, but somewhat what I expected. We talked a little bit about Lenins Mausoleum and our feelings about how they worship Lenin. We finished up by all praying together. It was really refreshing.\n\nFor our second to last greenroom we listened to the rest of the Irma tape that we started in Vitlander . All she said was that we were a great group and wished us all the luck in our show in the future.\n\nWhen we were getting ready to go on stage I decided I wanted to wear the Japanese costume again, and Noriko gave me a headband to wear with it that is really cool. I was wearing the headband around behind stage and Mia came up to me and said You arent going to wear the Japanese costume on stage again are you? I said, Yeah, I was planning on it. She said, I dont think you should because you dont look Japanese. I could understand if it were the German or Russian costume, but people in Japan are going to watch the video in a year and wonder why you are wearing that outfit. I said  I dont think it is that big of a deal, and just stared at her. She said Do you have a major problem with it? I said As a matter of fact I do. It my cast year, Im just having fun, and I dont thing it matters, but I wont wear it on stage. (Editor: Sorry Mia-if you ever read this- for being a 20 year-old know-it-all.) Soon after I did take a picture with it on, but went on stage right away after I took it off. Needless to say I was not very happy with Mia and wanted to be in a good mood on stage which made it very hard. During the show, I was able to get on a microphone with Leanne for 80s and Song of Peace, and had a blast. I went out in the audience for Shout and was nearly blinded by the spotlight while dancing in the aisle. It was a real challenge trying to stand on a step and not fall off. We were performing for about 12,000 people and the show was going great until we got to We Wish You Happiness the first time. We were also going to do that as an encore with all the bands so they all came on stage because they thought we were done, and we still had a good 20 minutes of performing left. The cast just went with it and kept going, but the people in coats and ties from UWP just went crazy especially Reed Thompson. They started up the smoke machines and he was back there trying to stop them yelling Nyet. The MC for the evening came on stage and was swaying back and forth with us (the wrong way), while Hans walked on stage with a concerned look in his eye. Lindsay and Mia were running around trying to decide whether or not to continue. They ended up doing The Proverb Song with everyone on stage then back into We Wish You Happiness for the encore. At the end another song was played while we went dancing and clapping in the audience. I enjoyed seeing the UWP powers going crazy and frantic more than performing tonight.\n\nI got dressed right away after the show and went back to the hotel. I dont remember the rest of the evening, but I probably stayed up and talked with Steve and Doug and wrote in my journal. I think in general people are holding up really well, but are getting a little run down. The most frustrating thing is (as the saying explains it), Hurry up and wait. That has been the cast motto for these past weeks and the whole year, but not as regularly used. Tomorrow is the last show but I dont think that is sinking into too many peoples heads. I know it hasnt hit me. It will! Im sure.\n\n6/19/88  Sunday (Last show of the year)\n\nWe had the morning off until 1:30 when lunch was served. I slept in until about 11:00 when I got up and showered and wrote some postcards. I also finally wrote in Elins book. I told her I would write some questions and she could answer them in my book.\n\nAfter lunch I bought some stamps so I could get my postcards in the mail. We loaded the buses at 2:30 and like usual we left around 3:00. They were going to take an official cast picture in Red Square in our show costumes, but it was raining so they decided to wait and see if the rain stopped. Well on the way to the hall, they changed their mind and we ended up at Red Square. We all changed on the buses as soon as we found out. It showed how far we have come since the beginning of the year. No one even hesitated changing, they just complained (because most people had been in their costume, but they told us to change into fitness clothes) and started taking their clothes off. I thought it was relatively funny, and what was even more funny was that halfway across Red Square it started raining again. All you could do is laugh it off. We were all in a V shape with our banner in the center in front of St. Basils. We took a few pictures with different Sputnik people then one with Mary Hart and that is when the cameras started rolling. She gained some respect from me when she proved she had some fun in her. On the count of three we all ran and rushed the cameras and screaming. It was funny and sure got some frustrations of having a camera round all the time out of our system. This is, however, where the epitome of Doing it for the camera happened. We all walked around Mary talking with her and walked around Red Square. It was really dumb, and there were a lot of people walking in the back bitching about it. At the front with Mary were the usual suspects: Rick, Ruud-Jan, Susie, Sean, Rodney and Brett. I was walking with Leanne, but there were a lot of Europeans around us. I think the Americans could understand why we were doing what we were doing, and had an easier time accepting it than the non-American, however. Most Americans thought it was a little ridiculous. When we were done, we went back to the facility to work Mary into the show. We all got into our show costumes (those that werent) so that we could film it. We must have run her little speech about 10 times. It got really old, but when we were finished and waiting for instructions we did The Load is Getting Heavier. It was like resurrecting something from the dead.\n\nWhen we were done, we had a quick meeting then had a little time to eat our sack dinner and change into our costumes.\n\nOur first green room was the official one with Sputnik, Hans making presentations, Mary wishing us a good show, and various other official people and stuff happening. We went on for this opening song soon after and there was very little emotion involved. Between the two shows I wrote about 15 postcards before we met for our final greenroom.\n\nIn the greenroom Lindsay spent the time thanking the production staff and told us the staff had gotten together about something, but wanted us to vote on something. In keeping with Russian tradition, they wanted to have a toast with Russian Vodka as an entire cast and wanted to know if anyone objected. Some people raised their hand in jest (Brian Eide), but they had alternative drinks anyways. We were going to do this toast at the end of greenroom, but the vodka started eating through the plastic cups so we had to do it sooner. To Cast A Nastrovia!\n\nLindsay continued by saying what a great group of people we were and ended up getting a little teary-eyed before she was done. When she was done, Christine did a warm-up, but each intern did one of their warm-ups that they were famous for. We did one last Whos the best, whos the best, Cast A! and walked away singing Go Bananas. I missed the last fishing club prayer which I could kick myself for but my head was somewhere else. Most of the crying girls were crying, but for the most part everyone was still stable.\n\nI personally was not feeling anything as far as emotions, which I felt bad about, but came to the conclusion that maybe I have prepared myself for this better than others (Editor: But Boy Howdy did it hit me about three weeks later!). I later found out that several people shared my non-emotions and my same conclusion. We did a lot of hugging then went on stage and had one of (if not the) most energetic shows ever. I dont think I have ever sweated as much as I did this night. I tried to put this whole years energy , excitement, frustrations and achievements into my performance. It was a good show and everyone held it together until Unfinished World then there were a few tears. I have to admit it almost got to me and I had a quick touching moment when I was screaming my lungs out on the AAAAAAAHHHHHH! I was standing next to Tim and holding Jos hand behind me. It was like I had expected, but felt good to be with friends. Then we went into our Russian songs segment, finish off with Mary making her little speech about looking forward to the day when children dont draw picture of missiles. The ending tonight went much better although the MC still came up early.\n\nMost of us went back to the hotel following the show, but one crew stayed back to strike.\n\nWe were just sitting in our room and Shawn and Wijnand brought in 2 members from one of the Russian rock bands that played with us. We were talking and people were straggling in, but before I knew it, it had turned into a party. We tried to keep it quiet for Denis next door, but people just kept coming. At one point in the evening there were 57 people in the room. I dont know how (thats Dougs figure), but I know I counted 50 before that so it is possible. The highlight of the evening was when Hans, Carlos, Terry, Thomas and Reed came in loaded with liquor in their hands (and stomachs). I dont know how many times Hans banged on his glass to make a toast or just to say something and eventually several people made toasts. At one point he clanked his glass and said I just want to announce that my glass is empty. It was a prime moment and I was out of film. I had used my last picture with Mary Hart and her brother that afternoon.\n\nAbout 2:30 we started kicking people out, but didnt succeed until about 3:00 A.M. The room looked like a tornado had hit it, but one broken table was our only casualty. I enjoyed myself especially when Denis came in to ask us to quiet down and came face to face with Hans. (Denis was not a happy person!) (Editor: Denis, have your forgiven us yet after 18 years?)\n\nAfter packing a little, we were in bed no later than 3:30 A.M.\n\n6/20/88:\n\nWe got on the bus at 6:00 a.m. and I was plenty tired, so I slept (not as well as Deedra, my bus date though). We stopped in Kalinin for lunch at 12:00 (we were supposed to be there at 9:30am) until 12:30. I finish the story Roadwork in the Bachman books novel by Steven King. During the course of the trip several movies were shown. The Bedroom Window, Rambo, The Living Daylights (James Bond) and The Golden Child. We arrived in Leningrad at about 9:00 p.m. (15 hour travel day), but by the time we dropped of one group of people at the Palace of Youth hotel and got checked into our hotel it was 10:30 p.m.\n\nHenry was my roommate and we stayed up and talked and wrote -postcards because he was doing some trading at 1:00am. They came to our room along with Marc DeGroot and Jeff Martinson who also wanted to trade. I got caught up in it because I decided I wanted a flag. I gave a pair of my black Mega Sport shorts, some razor blades, 3 packs of gum and a UWP lapel pin. He wanted my used deodorant, shirt (dress shirt), pouch to my black carry on bag, my sweat pants and my Jammin shirt, none of which I wanted to part with.\n\nBy the time they left and we got to bed it was 3:00 a.m. You wonder if these kids have parents and what they think of them being out this late (or early) in the morning. They couldnt have been older than 16 years.\n\n6/21/88  Tuesday\n\nWe woke up at 7:35, washed my hair then loaded the buses for breakfast at 7:45. After breakfast we left Leningrad for the border, but we stopped in Vyborg for lunch. It was really odd because we came back the same way we went and I recognized some of the same signs, houses, and just scenery in general brought back a wave of first impressions.\n\nLunch in Vyborg was actually very good, and what was funny was we got lost and pulled into the train station just like the first time. It was a major déjà vu. Mary Huckins bought me a local newspaper right before we left, then we went to the border. It was only about a 30 minute drive and I saw so many things that I first saw only 2 weeks ago i.e: dogs, tanks covered up, rundown houses, houses painted all different greens, and the beautiful scenery with the buoys in the water.\n\nWe got to the initial border where they took a count of how many people were on each bus. We got to the main border about 2:30 and everyone was worried about them checking luggage. We made it through relatively easily and I dont think anyone was checked. The thing that took time was exchanging money. When I got up there I did not have the exchange papers with me because I didnt think I ever got them. However I found out later that I had them in my address book. Brenda B. exchanged them with her rubles.\n\nWe passed through one more border (to check our numbers) then off to the Finnish border. We arrived about 4:30  5:00 (3:30-4:00 Finland time) and it was like a huge weight was taken off our shoulders (collectively). We all went through Finnish customs and laid outside waiting for the third bus. The weather was great and everyone was all ecstatic (excited) about clean bathrooms and being in the Western world again.\n\nWe arrived in Lappenranta about 5:00 and had two hours to kill before the meeting. I went and bought film ($10 for 1 roll) a candy bar and a chocolate ice cream cone. I was one of the lesser Western world indulgers, a lot of people went out and bought normal food.\n\nWe had a meeting at 7:00pm where we started saying goodbyes to Thomas Rhinecky and his wife and to Christine Stevens who is leaving early to get settled before she starts her job in Topeka. A teary situation but I have yet to get choked up.\n\nMy host family was about 15 minutes late, but when they picked me up I got comfortable, took a much needed shower, got my clothes together to wash, then relaxed by watching the soccer semi-finals. I tried imagine leaving tomorrow for Munich, but couldnt. Thank God. (Editor: This comment was I\n\nin relation to the fact at one point we were going to go do a show in Munich during the soccer finals.)\n\n6/22/88  Wednesday\n\nI didnt have to be in until noon, but I still was up around 10:00 taking a shower and getting ready. I did a little writing and packing before we left at 11:45. Only some people came at noon for lunch, the rest came at 1:00 p.m. for the meeting. I signed up for lunch because it was salad and I had not liked my host familys food the first time I stayed there. After indulging in an ice cream cone, I went back for our USSR evaluation.\n\nCarlos ran the meeting and Bruce Early taped everything everyone said. They asked if our first impression or preconceived ideas were correct. They asked what surprised us, what did we like or dislike, and a few other general questions. The last two hours were spent going around the circle giving our one (ha ha) best experience in the Soviet Union. Most everyone gave two or three in great detail so only about 25 people told their experiences. I was kind of disappointed not getting to share my experience (missed me by about 5 people), and I was really only going to take my one minute. I was just going to list meeting the clowns and trying to invite Gorbachev to our show, then tell about trying to teach my Kalinin Mom country swing. It kind of made me mad that people were taking 4 or 5 minutes. Matt told about our experience with the traders in Leningrad which kind of embarrassed me. He made me sound like a total rule breaker.\n\nWe finished up at 5:00 by asking a few statistics like: how many families did we visit; how many of us feel like they made a friend; how many got marriage proposals? When we were done, I met Paul and we went home to grab our swimming trunks and head to his summer home.\n\nIt was a nice place and I met his mother, uncle, uncles wife, cousin (or nephew) mother-in-law who were all there. We played darts for a while ( I could hardly hit the target let alone the bulls eye), then changed, sat in the sauna (my first Finish sauna) for maybe 5 minutes, then jumped in the lake, swam across and back then back in the sauna to rest. Whew! Paul decided there was enough wind (but very little) to wind surf. He went out first (his second time), but ended up paddling back to let me try. I had to start from the water (he started on the dock, which was a challenge in itself. After taking many times to figure out how to stay on the board and pull the sail out of the water without falling off, I learned how to stand. Just when I would get going I would head to the shore and not know how to turn. Every time Paul said Good job! I would fall off! (Murphys Law) I was going to keep trying until I got it, but it was getting late so I gave up, however, it was a very noble effort. We sat in the sauna little longer, washed off in the lake, dried off and started up the grill for dinner. They called them hot dogs, but it was just large sausages to me. They were good. We left about 9:30, and was home and in bed by 10:30 or 11:00.\n\n6/24/88  Friday\n\nWhen I got up, I finished packing it was about 8:10 and we had to be at HDO at 8:00, but I had forgot to tell my family that it had been changed from 8:30. To help him hurry up, I told him that it had been changed to 8:15. I got to HDO at about 8:25 and had to find which bus I was on to put my luggage on. I found my name scratched out and switched to another bus than what Kurt was on, and we were supposed to be allocated together. I asked Catharina and she said I had been switched because Ruud-Jan had missed the bus so I had to go to this other city. I said What if Kurt and I are roomed together and Im in the other city? She said I doubt you are because a lot of people are alone. I said So you know how pissed I am going to be if I find out that I was supposed to be allocated with him? Luckily Lynda was there and said the good news was that she could be my bus date still.\n\nI was kind of upset at the whole morning because I didnt have any time to say goodbye to anybody before we had to leave. Lynda and I had a good bus date, we didnt say much but just enjoyed each others company.\n\nWe arrived in this town about 45 kilometers from Helsinki at noon and I, of course, was not allocated, but neither was Ruud-Jan. So I found out Steve Ellis had been changed out of a large group so he could be by himself. He asked me to join him right as I was approaching him if I could join him. So he took Clays place, I took Ricks.\n\nOur family never showed up, so this alumna went to their house to see if they were there, but they werent. He came back for us, and took our luggage over and put it on their front porch, then we walked downtown. We tried to hitchhike, but with no luck.\n\nWe ended up at this restaurant and had a pizza and talked for a while. After that we walked around and ran into Dale, but was unable to go anywhere because everything was closed due to Midsummer Nights (holiday). We ended up back at a bar and had a drink and tried to get a hold of our family. Still no answer so we called Timo (the alumnus) and he came to pick us up. We went back to his place and crashed for a couple hours.\n\nWhen we woke up we knew no more info so Timo arranged for us to sleep on the floor in his sisters house. We asked again about his summer home and if that would be okay because we would really prefer beds. He said sure and we took our stuff out there.\n\nSteve and I were so psyched when we drove up because it is out in a forest in the middle of nowhere. There is one hose with running water downstairs next to the sauna, but an outhouse for bathroom accommodations. It is going to be like camping in a luxurious cabin.\n\nAfter we dropped off our stuff, we went to this bonfire at about 9:30pm. It was supposed to be lit at midnight, but somehow got started at 10:00. We watched until 11:00 then left to go back to his place to get some food. We finally got back to our home/cabin around midnight and settled in.\n\nWe spent the first hour snooping around by candlelight in the dark, checking in every door we could find. The second hour we tried to get the wood stove going to boil some tea. After filling the house with smoke we sat in the kitchen and talked until about 2:00am. It was really cool being on our own, in nature, making the best of a potentially bad situation, and getting to know each other. We had never really roomed together except in Moscow, but I really get along well with him and we were equally excited about staying here.\n\n6/25/88  Saturday\n\nFirst thing in the morning when I woke up I called Gretchen and Michelle. I had talked with Michelle on the bus yesterday and she was really up for going camping. We told them how great our situation was and they got excited and decided to come. However they had no car in their host family, so we had the dilemma of how to get them out here. We thought of everything from hitchhiking to bus to have Clay bring them, but after much thinking, and a lot of telephone calls, we decided they should go to the train station and grab a taxi when talking with a taxi driver how much it would cost another taxi driver noticed that they were in UWP. It was Timo (our host dad) and he said, You are trying to get to my house, so he brought them out here free of charge.\n\nWhile we were waiting for them Nannette called wanting to know how to get here so they could come visit. I gave them directions. When they arrived, we walked to go swimming in a lake. We tried a couple lakes before getting to the one that we went swimming in. We swam for a while then walked back, but on the way back Nanette and Brenda drove by us and picked us up and took us the rest of the way. We all lounged around, took a nap (with Gretchen and Michelle), eventually started a barbeque to cook some sausages/hot dogs for dinner. After dinner, Steve started up the sauna and Michelle, Gretchen, Steve and I went and sat in it, and eventually Nanette and Brenda went to sit in there. After that we sat around and talked and asked some serious questions like: Have you ever been in trouble with the cops; Have you broken rule number 9 this year, are you a virgin? were amongst the question. (Editor: Sorry, no answers were written in my journal.)\n\nI dont know what time it was when we went to bed because none of us were wearing watches because we didnt want to keep track of time. We all slept in the same bed (except Steve).\n\n6/26/88  Sunday\n\nI got up around 10:30 in time to see our guests leave. Michelle and Gretchen went to Clays house, and Nanette and Brenda went home. Steve and I laid out in the sun, saunaed, laid out some more, wrote in my journal, read my Moscow book (Nanette did some cool calligraphy in it for me), fell asleep for about two hours, did some more writing and listened to music. Timo came over about 6:00 p.m. with some firewood, and when he left we cooked our dinner, (sausages again). He called us back to tell us we were here for the duration which we were not too happy about. This has been fantastic, but without any TV or anything we will go crazy in another three days. He did bring us some more food which Steve was extremely pleased about. Later that evening we did more snooping out in the barn, went on an adventure in the woods, cut down a tree (Editor: see below for further explanation), came back, wrote in my journal while Steve added up all my statistics (that helped me a lot), then we talked a while about people and the banquet. Steve is an really interesting guy. Earlier he told me about a survival week he did; a summer job as a nurse in a small town mostly working on airplane crashes; all his interests in stocks, and at one time had about $130,000, but lost $60,000. He said he would also like to go through the whole interview process again, be accepted, go to staging with a beard and curly hair, and do the whole year again with no one ever knowing, and see if anyone questioned him or if he could really make it and how far. That would be so cool because you would know so much, but could play dumb and concentrate on the things you want to improve from the first time.\n\nWe have definitely done a lot of talking and I feel like I know him a lot better than I used to. It is neat because now he is someone I might keep in touch with more because of these past few days. (Editor: And I have!)\n\nIt is 1:12am and the sun will probably be coming up in the next hour (it just set an hour and a half ago), so I should go to bed. Im starting to get a little homesick or at least America sick. Being here alone makes you think a lot.\n\nEditors note: Henri was anxiously awaiting this day, and I have been asked by Julie Burgan to share with you the rest of the story behind the cutting down of the tree. Steve and I had two rusty axes and it took us way to long to cut down this three inch round evergreen, but it made us feel very manly and was quite the testosterone charged event. About two years later after we got off the road I received this very official looking letter from the Finland National Forrest  Department of Legal Affairs. It said something to the effect of Dear Mr. Axton, We know that you cut down one of our precious trees without provocation and have issued a warrant for your arrest if you should ever return to Finland. Our trees are our most precious commodity and we prosecute those, to the fullest extent, who destroy them for pure recreation and with no regard to our laws. Something along those lines. At this point I had not realized that there was a US postage stamp on the envelope even though the return address was from Finland. It wasnt until I got to the second page that it said, Here is to remembering a fun few days in Finland. Sincerely, Steve Well, being a gullible college student, he actually had me believing the letter until I got to his disclosure.\n\nI am not one to forget these things easily. I didnt know how or when, but I knew there would come a time when I could retaliate and get Steve back for making me feel like a Finnish fugitive. My opportunity came about four years later when I was performing at the Big Fork Summer Playhouse in Montana. It turns out the playhouse was about 30 minutes from where Steves father lived and and he was going to be in town visiting, so he made arrangement to come and see me perform in one of my productions. As was customary at the beginning of each show we would have a little pre-show announcement about no flash photography, and candy wrappers, etc., and would introduce any family members of the performers or dignitaries in the audience. I had given the person who does the announcement instructions on introducing Steve, but with a twist. First he asked for Steve Ellis to stand and be recognized. Well, you all know he is not one to shy away from attention, so there he is, with 6 or 8 family and friends around him, standing and not knowing why he is standing. The person on stage then asks the audience to help him welcome the Chairman of the Finnish National Forestry Department, and to give him a round of applause for traveling thousands of miles to be at tonights show. I have never seen a brighter shade of red on a human face, nor have I ever seen Steve Ellis speechless! To make it even better, he had people welcoming him to America during intermission and after the show.\n\nI know my days are numbered, and I am constantly watching over my shoulder for the retaliation from Steve, but for the time being, I have the last laugh! HA!\n\nI hope you are enjoying reading these as much as I am sharing them.\n\nGrant,\n\nI have such fond memories of the house in Finland. I remember when Michelle and Gretchen came over and joined us, about five guys . . . and it is so sad I cannot remember all of us who ended up being there. And to save their honor, there were more ladies who joined us. We had a bunch of people at our house!\n\nThe point was that we had a big house, no host family, keys to the car (which we left at the airport parking lot with the keys under the mat . . . did I mention we had NO host family!), run of the house, all the food we needed . . . and Kevin had a Sauna! (Editors Note: Host Family was only there the first night to tell us where everything was and left the next morning on vacation - not before sitting in the sauna topless . . . I wonder why Kevin liked that Sauna!) What a blast and great memory for me! I remember those cold mornings crawling down in that dark hole under the house to put firewood in the stove to heat the water for showers. We had great breakfasts, listened to Sting records (yes, records) and had we found an axe . . . well, we may have cut down a tree or two. Sorry Steve. Wow. Awesome memories.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your memories with us. I have relived so much of this through your writing, but found it to be so cool that someone, in the same cast as me, was having a totally different experience. Very cool. It is a very small world.\n\nClay\n\n6/27/88  Monday\n\nI was awoken at 10:00 am by a phone call from Gretchen wondering what our plans were for the day. We didnt know, but after calling Kurts (and mine) host family starting Monday they said they were able to take three people (instead of two). We called Timo and made arrangements for him to pick us up around 4:00pm to take us to the train station to meet our family at 5:00pm. After such a strenuous evening last night of exploring and chopping down a tree with Steve, we needed to have our daily sauna. While it was heating up I laid outside to catch some rays. Steve and I saunaed and showered then he took a nap and I read The Running Man by Steven King. For lunch we had our usual corn flakes, but also had butter and sugar on a bread warmed up to perfection. We have had a great diet of either sausages or corn flakes. This is called roughing it! During the day we packed and cleaned up the house, and by the time Timo came we were all set and ready to go.\n\nWhile we were waiting for Kurt at the train station, Mina approached us and told us she was our host, and we explained to her that we were still waiting for one more person. The 5:00pm train came and went and no Kurt so we waited for the next at 5:15. We saw Ruud-Jan get off the train and we found out Kurt was with him, so Steve and I thought we were screwed again, but the family said they could take all four of us.\n\nTimo took us and our luggage over to their house and we had Cyndi and Suzy with us too, and the poor family thought it was all of us. We got our luggage and beds situated then had dinner on the barbeque. It was a pretty good steak and nice to have a well-cooked meal.\n\nWe talked a while after dinner, but went to a place called The Upstairs Club around 9:00pm. It was pretty boring, although, quite a few people were there, I just was bored. I had a rum and coke that made me tired, but had trouble getting into the club scene. We left about 12:30, which was fine with me. I did spend part of the evening talking with Birger about making a tape of American music for the video so I will try to do that for him.\n\nWe pretty much went straight to bed when we got home.\n\n6/29/88  Wednesday\n\nMost of the morning was pretty lazy just sitting around until Kurt left for Helsinki to get the costume bags settled. Steve and I sat and watched the movie V until the power went off, so we went to lunch. The strange thing is here the power goes off before the thunderstorm not during. We had these meal coupons to use, but the restaurant had no power either as we sat and watched the rain. It was cool to watch and really started to downpour. We ran out in the rain a little bit until the power came on and went back to the restaurant to eat.\n\nThey spoke absolutely no English, so Steve pointed to the two different things on the board and hoped they would be good. For all we knew we were getting boiled tennis shoes, but actually got something edible. When we finished we went back to watch the rest of the movie, but towards the end, the tape ran out so we never saw the ending. Ruud-Jan came home just as we were leaving without him. He had to hurry in order for us to get out the door quickly.\n\nWe met host Mom at the airport with our luggage and checked it in as soon as possible. I still needed a Finnish flag for my coat so it would be complete (with a flag from every country we visited). Mina went one way and I went another, but she came back with what I didnt want. Oh well, it was a nice gesture and it worked anyways so I was happy I didnt have to buy it. I hung around with Randy until we had to go through passport control. Today was full of just waiting, so while we waited, I took a picture of all the Coloradoans.\n\nWe got on the plane at 6:30pm, and my plane date was Jennifer (McDonald). She was not feeling well so we didnt talk much, but I got some writing done. The whole flight home (to NYC) it was light outside so it was hard to sleep, and the movie was Moonstruck. I was not too impressed with the movie, but watched the whole thing. Walked around talking to people for a while (to Lynda) and played gin with Jeff and Darci.\n\nWe landed at 8:20 and Jeff Van Zyl notified us that we were now alumni. Weird thought! We waited for about 30 minutes for our luggage and the first thing on the belt was Kelly Bates. It was pretty funny, but reality hit hard when Leanne left to catch her flight home. She was the first American to leave.\n\nI went through customs relatively easy. I told them I was part of the UWP group that was going through and he asked me where I was coming from, whether or not I had food, and did I have any alcohol. I told him I had a bottle of champagne, no food, and my most expensive purchase was not over $20.00. I didnt think I should mention about the vodka, but I didnt have any problems anyways. (Editor: Probably a good idea not to mention it since I was only 20 at the time.)\n\nWe all congregated out near the doors and said our goodbyes. Steve Riveria was here to greet us and say hello and goodbye and it was really good to see him again. It got pretty teary-eyed for all of us and I was finally able to get out some of my emotions. We slobbered over each other for about an hour and a half until I could call home after 10:00 p.m.\n\nMom didnt know much about what was going on with my flight plans. I told her I was not able to get in a hotel room that night and that my plans to get to New Jersey fell through so I was back to square one. I had checked with Bill Parker on how to get to Toms River and he told me I would have to switch a couple of times to a different bus in order to get there. She said Mrs. Marko was not able to get any Cats tickets, so she suggested I stay in the city and see what I could do about getting tickets, but she didnt want me to sleep in the airport. When I was done talking with her, I checked the ground transportation and they said I could only get there by personal car. Megabucks! So I decided to wait, spend the night in the airport, and try and tackle it tomorrow with a clear head. A bunch of people (about 10 of us) found a somewhat quiet corner, and took over. Welcome to the Kennedy Airport Hotel! Not quite as comfortable as a hotel bed, but at least it was cheap (free).\n\n6/30/88  Thursday\n\nHow great can a day start off when you start it by waking up in an airport on the floor? We sat around and talked and waited as one by one people started walking away. Finally all that was left was Michelle Bauckham and I, and we said our final goodbye and went our separate ways.\n\nI met up with Marty and Bill and we talked and read the USA Today. I was able to leave my stuff while I called the Markos and told them I was in town. I also looked into tickets to Cats and they had some available but I had to have a credit card to reserve, and besides I didnt know Mary Huckins plans. When I was done with that, I babysat luggage while Marty waited until Cynthia left. I was going to go with Marty to Newark Airport but it cost $17.00 and I would still have to get to Toms River from there, so I decided to go to Port Authority downtown for $8.00.\n\nMarty waited until I left, and we laughed about this guys job it was to inform everyone in sight when the bus came and how much it cost. I answered this girls question as to what bus it was outside and he about had a fit.\n\nAfter I got downtown, I checked my luggage into storage then went straight to Winter Gardens box office (only stopping at the visitors center for a map to make sure I knew where I was headed) to check on Cats tickets. I was able to get one for tonight for $30.00 so I went for it and figured Mary would understand. I thought since I saved money on the ticket I could buy a Cats t-shirt for $10.00. (Editor: Yeah, I am a geek.)\n\nAfter I did that I found the nearest telephone (across the corner from Winter Gardens) and called John Marko and told him my plans. He seemed real cool about it and I told him I already had bought my ticket. He said I could either call when I got there or take a taxi. I called home and told them I checked into an airplane ticket and only found things for no less than $308 smackeroos. I asked if Mom could find more info on the cheaper tickets to call me at the Marko house. They also received my postcard from Russia today which took a lot less time than I expected.\n\nWhen I was finished talking with them I went across the street to the Pizza Hut and had a pepperoni Personal Pan Pizza! It was delicious! I didnt think I missed it that much. When I was finished I took the subway to downtown Manhattan and saw: The World Trade Center two towers, St. Pauls Cathedral (outside) Trinity Church (inside), Wall Street, American Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and was going to see Chinatown and Little Italy, but I ran out of time. On the way back I went clear to 57th Street so I could go to the Hard Rock Café  New York. I stayed there for about 30 minutes and had my first real wine cooler in 3 months! That Bartles and Jaymes was one of the best things I have ever drank! (Editor: Yes, I was quite the wine cooler connoisseur.) The guy standing next to me had a Swedish flag on his coat and I asked him if he was from there. He said yes, but had moved to the states several years ago. I told him that this Hard Rock was much better than Stockholm and he agreed. We talked for a little while. I left about 6:30 to head back.\n\nOn the way back I looked into Radio City Music Hall, the NBC building and read a LIFE magazine in the Time/Life Building. I got to the theater at about 6:50 and just sat around and waited to go in.\n\nWhen I first got my seat I couldnt decided whether or not they would be good seats. I was actually in the stage left wing and right on top of the stage. It was good because you could see extra things the rest of the audience could not see like the entrances and exits, but the things you couldnt see far outweighed what you could see. Most of the time we were staring at their backs and could see nothing that happened on stage left down stage. It was still good and I was glad to be there, but I noticed some seats down front that no one ever took, so at intermission I asked the man. On my way down there I got Old Deuteronomys signature and took some pictures of the stage. Also once everyone was on stage looking around I got a snapshot of Old Deuteronomy. Oooh boy I dont think he liked that. He was not saying anything when he signed autographs, but his look could have burned a hole right through me.\n\nAfter intermission I enjoyed the show much better because I was still close to the stage, but could catch everything. My senses were going crazy trying to absorb everything. The makeup was just phenomenal and you could tell that they had studied the behavior of cats. The stage did amazing things with backdrops falling to make a completely different scene. From a junkyard to a ship. Then at the end this whole tire moved towards the audience and up to meet another staircase that came out of the ceiling to take Grizabella to the heavy side layer. They were constantly in the audience roaming around and really brought the audience on stage or maybe made the audience part of the stage. The entire audience and stage set design was all boxes, cans, bicycle tires and trash in general that were 10 times their original size. I knew that when the song Memory came on the audience would go wild because that is the most famous song from this musical. The first half when she came out to sing it it was good, but not a showstopper. However the second time being able to see her whole face and body was just incredible! She really did not have a great voice, but boy could she project. I dont think I have ever shivered as much as I did during that one song. It was incredible!\n\nAfter the show I walked straight back to Port Authority, picked up my bags, found out where to catch the bus then went upstairs and waited. The bus ride was about an hour and a half and I arrived into Toms River at 1:30am, called John (and Mrs. Marko answered) and he was there to pick me up soon after.\n\nWhen we got home they showed me my room and the bathroom and I went to bed.\n\nJuly:\n\nClick here to choose a different month\n\n7/1/88 Friday\n\nToday was a real relaxing day for me. I got up about 10:30, showered, sat in the sun, wrote in my journal, went to lunch with Bob and John at a hole in the wall diner, came back and started calling travel agents. After I found out some information, I watched TV a while until Mrs. Marko came home Then she took me to get my ticket, went to the grocery store (got normal deodorant hooray!) and to get dinner, went back home, left again with John to the bank to get money, came back and had a delicious steak and corn on the cob dinner with Mr. & Mrs. Marko. After dinner I watched Dragnet on HBO until 10:00 then I went to bed. I really didnt mind not doing anything, but Mrs. Marko felt bad about it. She didnt believe me when I told her I was perfectly content. Oh well, it was a nice home and a nice stay, but Im getting anxious to get home.\n\nI also talked with Mary Huckins for a short time to see if she was coming to the city, but she was not. Good thing I didnt wait to see Cats.\n\n7/2/88 - Saturday\n\nI had a fantastic eggs, sausage and muffins breakfast this morning, then she dropped me off to catch the 9:00 A.M. Express bus to NYC.\n\nI went straight to the ticket outlet when I got there and stood in an incredibly long line, but it moved pretty quickly. I had no problem getting a ticket for A Chorus Line for the matinee this afternoon. I basically just walked around waiting for the show because I only had two hours to wait.\n\nMy seat was way left of the stage so right before the house lights went down I moved to the middle section for a more straight on shot at the stage. I was a little disappointed in the show actually, more so in the casting of the performers. Some of them just really did not look the way I thought they should look. I really liked the way Marsalis played her part and sang the song I Felt Nothing, but some of the other parts didnt work. The girl who sang Tits and Ass was too old trying to look young. One thing I thought was really neat was that the character part of Sheila came from Colorado Springs, so I was going to try and meet her after the show, but didnt. (Editor: Dang, quite the theater critic at age 20!)\n\nAfter A Chorus Line was over, I went downtown to Chinatown and Little Italy where I looked around a while. I called home from a phone booth between the two and gave my flight plans to them and talked for a while. I was not impressed with Chinatown because it was very dirty with too many people.\n\nFrom Chinatown I went down to Battery Park and just sat on a bench and stared at Ellis Island and The Statue of Liberty. I was thinking that so many people look at these places with the American flag waving and think nothing of it. After being overseas, the American flag stands for so much more and means more to me.\n\nI headed back uptown to catch Godspell and was there by about 7:15. While I was waiting I talked with this usher and explained to me that the theater was owned by the church.\n\nThe Lambs Theatre was pretty small with a small stage so there were not many bad seats. I really enjoyed this production after it got warmed up. It was very up to date and down-to-earth. I would like to see another production of it to see if it is the show or the director that made the show good. The cast was 5 guys and 5 girls between age 20 and 27 and was very high energy with lots of interaction with the audience. It was actually very similar to UWP, and at intermission the audience was asked onstage for a Dixie cup of grape juice. I spent some time talking with one of the girls at intermission. I asked her if most of the performers had the same beliefs as what they were saying/performing. She said no, which should not have surprised me, but I didnt feel like they meant what they were saying during the second half. The second act was much more serious than the first and was pretty deep. I really enjoyed this show and getting to laugh. If I come back to New York City, I will have to see more comedies.\n\nWhen this one was over, I hung around and watched the actors and actresses leave, and it hit me that as soon as they leave that theater they become just another New Yorker. After 30 minutes or so, I went and got a Big Mac, fries, and Coke, my first one since Ive been back in the states. From there I walked to the Hard Rock and had another wine cooler hoping to meet someone, but didnt.\n\nI took a different way home checking out nightlife. I actually felt relatively safe. I never saw a prostitute, but there were men selling watches every 10 feet on some streets (literally). It was very strange to me and I couldnt figure it out. A commodity that is not a big seller (watches) and so many of them (sellers). I couldnt understand why they sell watches.\n\nI walked back to the Port Authority, but it was 1:00am so I couldnt get my bags until 7:00 A.M. so I read my book in Burger King until they closed then I moved on to the street to sleep. I slept (or tried) on the bus station steps until 6:00 A.M. when I got my ticket to JFK. (Editor: Amazing how UWP and youth made me crazy enough to think this was okay to do. No wonder my mother wanted to kill me when I told her I slept on the steps of the bus station in NYC.)\n\nWhile I was waiting for the parcel holding place to open, I dozed a little and two cops came and asked me if I was okay.\n\nI guess this is actually July 3rd now. I loaded the bus, checked in my luggage and had about 30 minutes to spare before we left NYC.\n\n7/3/88 Sunday\n\n(Editor: These last couple days had nothing to do with our tour, but I found them interesting because of how random my thoughts were and how my whole goal was to explore my surrounding and my thoughts. This was not a common occurrence for me before UWP. Maybe it will remind you of your own experience of going home right after the tour and how disjointed it felt, yet so good to be home.)\n\nMy flight to St. Louis with continuing flight to Honolulu left at 9:20 A.M. arriving at St. Louis at 10:52 Central Standard Time. Coming in on our 747 our captain assured us it was beautiful 79 degrees. I spent the two-hour layover eating Oreos and playing a video game (Motorcycle).\n\nNow I sit here buckled in my seat in the DC-9 that will take me home to the place where I belong (John Denver) [Ive been reading too much Steven King lately; first Roadwork,, then The Running man, now The Stand. ] This is the first time I have been in Colorado Springs in six months! We are just taxiing to the runway and I already have butterflies in my stomach.\n\nI cant decide (place this mask tightly over your mouth  blah, blah, blah) whether Im excited or nervous. I have ideas of what I would like to do when I get home, but Im afraid Im going to get really bored quickly. I hope I can appreciate the little things that I missed in Europe and that I yearned so much for. I hope that I can accomplish some of the things that I have been thinking about i.e: Ballroom dance Instructor, Community theater, a good job, classes at PPCC or UCCS, maybe go to UWP Dress Rehearsal. Dress Rehearsal wow that seems like a lifetime ago. It was a lifetime ago! I have 130 friends all over the world that I am already starting to miss, and I feel like Im just coming back home after a week at Jeffs (my best friend at the time) in Salt Lake City. Yesterday sitting at the bay, looking at Lady Liberty I couldnt help but think of Elin and Jo, Sanne, Tim, Diane all standing together seeing that spectacular sight for the first time. . Going to see Cats made me think of Elin and that same corner and Radio City Music Hall will always remind me of her.\n\nIve spent a year of my life that none of my friends or family will completely understand what I went through. Was it worth it? Yes, I think so, but would (or will) I do it again? I dont know, but Ill answer that if I ever have to make that decision.\n\nI was starting to read through this journal trying to come to some conclusions when people ask me questions which are probably not going to be: So how did you like it? Or what is Up with (the) People? The questions they are going to ask now are going to be centered around Europe and especially the Soviet Union, i.e.: What was your favorite country / place? What are the Soviet people really like? What does the USSR look like? I will try and write in this in a few months and see if I was right. As far as this entry, this journal will not be written in from an UWP perspective. UWP said my year was over June 29th but it wont be over for me until I reach home. I will have then completed my full circle.\n\nIt is funny that in The Stand a girl talks about her boyfriend and how he always knows how he is being looked upon and he always tries to create the perfect picture. Sometimes I think I have written in my journal with the same thought. I have told several people that my main reason for trying to be so thorough and detailed is in the hope someday someone might write a book or make a movie about my life. Well future son, daughter, or good friend, that is now reading this, I hope this gives you a fair account of the trials and tribulations of just one year of my life. I hope Im around to see how I am perceived by others through my writing.\n\n1:20  Mountain Standard Time\n\nDecent into Colorado Springs\n\nI can see the mountains so I must be home. The only thing in my head is the one line from a song in Anything Goes by the same title: Come on and blow, Gabriel, Blow! Come on and blow, Gabriel, Blow! (Editor: Not sure why this song was in my head. Weird.)\n\nI look out the window and it is good to see familiar things: Pikes Peak, the scar on the mountain, I-24, Black Forest and Colorado Springs. Im not expecting anyone besides Mom, Dad and maybe Scott (my oldest brother), if anyone else shows up I will write it in here but otherwise this is my last entry. There is a lot of turbulence, Pikes Peak is out the left window and we are about to land right now (1:28 and 54 seconds on July 3rd 1988) the day before Independence Day my Up With People Experience is over! (Editor: Damn! So dramatic. Was it that way for you too?)\n\n7/26/87\n\nWell here goes. Today is the day it all began 19 years ago. I didn't write every day, but I wrote a little bit most every day. These are not as long and detailed as the Soviet Union daily journal entries (which you can find on the cast A website if you missed any of them at: www.uwpcasta87.com). You can also find journal entries from Julie Burgan on the website daily. This is all in an attempt to remind you what a life altering year you had in 1987-88, and encourage you to attend our 20th reunion in Tucson, AZ from August 8-11, 2007. My goal is to get 80% of our cast and staff at next years reunion and I think we can do it. Start making plans now. In the meantime, enjoy A Day in the Life of Cast 87A!\n\nGrant\n\n**************\n\n7/26/87 1:00 P.M.\n\nWent to church this morning and took off to catch my flight from Colorado Springs at 11:20am and arrived in Phoenix at 12:35. While waiting for the flight to Tucson with Brad Wagnon, we met up with about another 12 to 15 UWP students also heading to Tucson. After introducing myself and meeting the others (and already forgetting their names) we boarded the plane. Just walking down the boarding hallway, I got a taste (and feel) of the temperatures we will be experiencing for the next five weeks. It was not until now that I finally realized I m really going and really going to be traveling for a year. I would have never thought a year ago that this is where I would be. I will miss my friends and family, but I suppose I won't have time to miss them too much. Kind of a rough flight to Phoenix with a lot of turbulence, but we were greeted by rain in Tucson, however it was still 98 degrees.\n\n10:50pm\n\nWell the first day is over, and I m at my host families house. Sandie Mott and her two children Debra (14) & Carrie (9). Nice people. This is definitely going to be an experience. I went through registration without any problems. People are very friendly and anxious to meet other people. It s like putting 5000 Grant Axton clones in one room. There is so much to know about and remember, but I suppose it will get easier. Every one talks with people as if they have known them for a long time. Everybody is also very hyper and anxious and excited, and don t listen much to instructions, but somehow they are hearing what they need to hear. My roommate for the next 5 weeks is Steve Bailey from Lynchburg, Virginia. I also m"
