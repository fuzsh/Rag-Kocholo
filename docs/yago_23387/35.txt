Amenhotep III ruled Egypt for 38 years during a period of great prosperity. He promoted himself as a promoter of justice and order. Amenhotep III married Queen Tiye, who came from a common background but gained prominence during his reign. They had several daughters together who Amenhotep III later took as "great royal wives", though these marriages were likely ceremonial. Amenhotep III also promoted the cult of the sun disk, which later became the supreme deity under his successor Akhenaten.
