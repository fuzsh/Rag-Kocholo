Tiye had the same titles as Nefertari and so there was not much difference in the way she was regarded in terms of the titles she possessed. From her husband, Amenhotep III's mortuary temple, little remains but the 'Colossi of Memnon' which were two enormous statues of the king and a statue of Amenhotep and Tiye enthroned together on the same scale. This clearly emphasises her importance and great authority, much the same as Queen Nefertari. Similar to Nefertari, she was also deified and retained her prominent position during the reign of Akhenaten, her son. Due to her position, Tiye is believed to have become her husband's 'second in command' as she would have had an active role in administration, religious life and family life. As Amenhotep III is known for his diplomacy, it is unlikely that Tiye had an military involvement.\n\nroyal_queens_sources.docxFile Size: 1026 kbFile Type: docx\n\nDownload File\n\nWife of Akhenaten (formerly Amenhotep IV), Nefertiti was a ruler of Egypt in her own right, following in the footsteps of her mother in law, Queen Tiye. She played a significant role in the deviation away from the society's norm and was deemed the \"heretic queen\". Her role in religion was possibly the most prominent as she was successful, with Akhenaten, in creating the first monotheistic religion to the sun disk - Aten. She is depicted in the Hewet-benben at East Karnak, a temple entirely devoted to worship of the Aten, making offerings to the sun disk with her daughter, Meritaten. Akhenaten is not depicted in any reliefs of this temple and Nefertiti appears twice as often as him in the East Karnak temples. This supports the idea that she was a significant figure of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Talatat from East Karnak and Akhetaten depict Nefertiti in pharaonic poses, such as 'smiting the enemy' and trampling enemies as a sphinx. Reliefs in private and public buildings also depict Nefertiti driving her own chariot in state processions, joining her husband in worship of the Aten and distributing honours and receiving international envoys. Nefertiti is also shown in Ahkenaten's tomb in paintings and statues playing intimately with her children thus showing her involvement in family life. ​\n\nroyal_queens_sources.docxFile Size: 1026 kbFile Type: docx\n\nDownload File"
