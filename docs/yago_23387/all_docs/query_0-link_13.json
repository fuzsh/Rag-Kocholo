        "text": "Early Life\n\nQueen Tiye (also spelled Tye, Taia, Tiy, and Tiyi) lived between 1398 and 1338 B.C., according to legend. Her story, like many others from her time, is shrouded in mystery. She was the daughter of Yuya and Tjuyu, and although she was not of royal blood, her family was well-known in Egypt, and she married Amenhotep III, a renowned Egyptian pharaoh. She was Akhenaten's mother, Tutankhamun's grandmother, and Pharaoh Ay's sister.\n\nThe powerful queen was said to be of Nubian ancestry, but some scholars believe there isn't enough evidence to back up this claim. Scholars agree, however, that she was not an Egyptian native, and that she could have descended from one of the various Nubian ethnic groups, as Africans from further south made significant contributions to Egyptian society.\n\nThe Wise Advisor, Confidant and Ruler\n\nQueen Tiye ruled in the 18th dynasty, which was Egypt’s most popular era. During her husband's reign, she was referred to as the \"Great Royal Wife.\" The queen was given a significant amount of power in state affairs and was a prominent figure at public events. She was the one who communicated with foreign rulers, and the Amarna letters display how much these rulers admired and respected her. She was in charge of governing Kemet, protecting its borders, and facilitating trade harmony.\n\nThe queen was always by Amenhotep III's side in sculptures and inscriptions, emphasising her importance in state affairs and revolutionizing Egyptian art. She was the first queen in Egyptian history to have her name written on a piece of paper. Amenhotep III genuinely loved and honoured his wife, and regarded her as a partner in his life. He built a palace for his queen and dedicated an enormous desert lake to her. He also built and dedicated a temple in Nubia to his wife, where she was worshipped as the living form of the goddess Hathor, due to his wife's Nubian ancestry.\n\nWhen her son Amenhotep IV ascended to the throne, Queen Tiye was given the title of \"King's Mother.\" Her son later changed his name to Akhenaten and caused a lot of controversy in Egypt with his controversial religious reforms. Despite his deviation from traditional practices, Queen Tiye seemed to love and support her son, demonstrating her steadfastness.\n\n‘Tiye ruled with the same authority as a man and exercised her power in equal measure with the great kings of the ancient world.’\n\n- Ancient History Encyclopaedia\n\nHer Death\n\nShe was said to have passed around ages 50-60 during Akhenaten’s 12th year of rule, possibly due to an epidemic. Her body was moved to the Valley of the Kings as her tomb was found intact and badly damaged by thieves. She was moved to her husband’s tomb to rest with him for eternity. Her mummy which is also identified as the 'Elder Lady' has drawn much intrigue due to the ‘unusual’ discovery.\n\nThe mummy was discovered with long beautiful hair and a well-preserved face and teeth. DNA testing of the mummy also further proved that she was indeed Tutankhamun’s grandmother.\n\nHistorical Mark and Cultural Legacy\n\nIn her time, she was thought to be the most powerful woman in history and represented the ideal standard of beauty in the ancient world. Queen Tiye's legacy is cemented by her influence on Queen Nefertiti, one of history's most popular queens.\n\nOne of history’s most influential queens (and she was an African woman)\n\nShe was not only an important vessel for the court, but her death also marked the end of the 18th dynasty's illustrious reign. Queen Tiye's illustrious legacy establishes her as one of Africa's greatest queens.\n\nReferences\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica. n.d. Tiy | queen of Egypt.
