        "text": "King Amenhotep III, stories and secrets revealed by the ancient Egyptian through his great civilization that spans thousands of years, and they continue to dazzle the world until now. From time to time, one of the mysteries of that history that extends over several centuries is solved, some of which were recorded on the walls of temples in the time of ancient Egyptian writing. Others have not yet been recorded, but are revealed by archaeological treasures emerging from the ground.\n\nAbout King Amenhotep III\n\nKing Amenhotep III (sometimes written Amenophis III) was the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and one of the greatest rulers of Egypt in history. He ruled Egypt in the period between (1391 BC – 1353 BC) or (1388 BC – 1351 BC)\n\nIn the second year of his reign, Amenhotep III married Queen Tiye. She did not have royal origins, but her parents held high-ranking positions in the state.\n\nShe gave birth to his successor, Amenhotep IV, who believed in one god and represented him in the sun (Aten) as the giver of life. He called himself Akhenaten, which means “the savior of Aten.”\n\nKing Amenhotep III had many wives, including diplomatic marriages to foreign princesses, such as Princess Gluheba, daughter of the King of Metna (in Iraq today).\n\nAnd the princess of two rivers, and he married his sister Isis. In the thirtieth year, he married another sister of his called Set Amun.\n\nIt is known that he fathered six children, including two sons, Thutmose, the eldest son, who died during his lifetime, and Amenhotep IV, and four daughters. It is possible that Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten) shared the throne with his father and was one of the last to worship Amun.\n\nThe love story of King Amenhotep III\n\nIn his mid-teens, Amenhotep was focused not on the army, but on his one true love, a woman named Ti. She was mentioned as the “Great Royal Wife They married as a child!”\n\nShe was a truly amazing woman. Her parents, Yuya and Touya, were non-royal officials; her father was a charioteer and a priest, while her mother was a priestess.\n\nThe tomb of Yuya and Toya was discovered in 1905, archaeologists have found a lot of riches there, and DNA testing carried out on their mummies in recent years has proven key in identifying the unidentified bodies.\n\nOne of Tiye’s brothers was a prominent priest named Anin, and many have suggested that the famous Eighteenth Dynasty official Ay, the alleged father of Queen Nefertiti and eventual pharaoh after King Tut, was one of her brothers.\n\nThe love story of King Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye is the story that challenged customs and traditions about her and for which he ordered changing the sacred laws of the priests of Amun.\n\nTiye was of non-royal blood and it was not permissible for them to marry. For her sake, he ordered the creation of a vast lake for his great beloved, and for her sake he ordered the establishment of a temple dedicated to her worship in the Sadanqa area, 210 km south of Wadi Halfa.\n\nThis love is also witnessed by a giant statue of the king, with his beloved Tiye sitting next to him in the same size, in an artistic indication of the elevation of the matter and the greatness of love.\n\nSo Ti married her husband when they were very young, but the most interesting thing about her is the way she is depicted in statues.\n\nAmenhotep ordered statues showing him, the king, and Ti in the same size, indicating their importance in the royal court, which were equal to statues of the pharaoh.\n\nIn a culture where visual size was everything, bigger was better, so an equally big king and big queen showed them as equals.\n\nThis egalitarian depiction is largely unprecedented, showing Amenhotep’s devotion to his wife, allowing her to exert an influence similar to his own, so that Ti assumes masculine and regal poses, appearing on her throne as a sphinx who crushes her enemies.\n\nAnd obtains her own sphinx, now, Not only is she an equal to the king in the way she is portrayed, but she fulfills his roles\n\nKing Amenhotep III and his accession to the throne\n\nOur story today is with King Amenhotep III (1405-1370 BC), who assumed power at a young age, after the death of his father, King Tuthmosis IV, at the age of approximately twelve.\n\nAnd his mother had a secondary wife called “Mut-em-Wya”, and he continued to rule the country alone. For about thirty-six years, during which he was the greatest monarch in the civilized world.\n\nAnd Egypt was the largest empire in the ancient East and the one with political and literary sovereignty in it.\n\nKing Amenhotep III was considered the greatest king who carried out construction and reconstruction work during the era of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and the activity\n\nAn interest that the previous kings exerted in the fierce wars was exploited by him in designing the buildings with which he wanted to decorate his country.\n\nIn the early years of his reign, King Amenhotep III was interested in sports, especially hunting and hunting, as he was a great hunter\n\nWhere a scarab was found for him recording that he captured a hundred wild bulls on a royal hunting trip that lasted two days, and another scarab that he released in the tenth year.\n\nIt was mentioned that since his accession to the throne, he had killed 102 lions on hunting trips. He showed little interest in military operations, as King Amenhotep III faced some unrest in the fifth year of his rule in the country of Kush (Nubia).\n\nBut the fighting was taking place with a small group of rebels, and after he defeated them, he expanded his territory until he reached the Fourth Cataract.\n\nA memorial of this campaign was written near the rocks of Konoso Island in Nubia, and his campaign against Nubia was described on a stela of obesity, which is now in the British Museum.\n\nAnother revolution took place in the town of Abhat, located after the Second Cataract, and Nubia had self-administration under the supervision of the royal son of Kush.\n\nAmenhotep sent his deputy to the southern regions and the king’s son to suppress the revolution, but King Amenhotep III did not participate in it. Most of his rule was characterized by stability and prosperity.\n\nEffects and achievements of Amenhotep III\n\nKing Amenhotep III built a temple in Thebes, but it was completely destroyed after that. He also built several temples in Thebes, and in Karnak he built a temple for the god Montu, the god of war, who was the lord of the Theban region.\n\nThen he was replaced by the god Amun, and another temple for the god Mut, the wife of the god Amun-Ra.\n\nHe also contributed to the Temple of Amun, the main temple in Karnak, by building the third edifice of the temple. Amenhotep was loyal to the god Ra and built the Karnak Temple for him to avoid the soothsayers that his mother was a foreign woman.\n\nThe greatest building erected by Amenhotep in Thebes was his funerary temple. Traces of it were found in the Delta, Tura, Banha, Memphis, Giza, Cape, Arment, and also in Sinai.\n\nKing Amenhotep III has two seated statues known as the Colossi of Memnon in Western Thebes, each carved from a single piece of red sandstone and reaching a height of 15 meters without the base. They were erected by the engineer Amenhotep Ibn Habu.\n\nThey decorated the facade of his funerary temple, which was completely destroyed, and they now stand next to the road leading to the royal temples and tombs of the kings in the cemetery.\n\nThe reason for the fame of the two statues is that when an earthquake occurred in the year 27 BC, it shook the Thebes region and led to the northern statue splitting into two halves at its waist.\n\nAfter that, the stone sent sound vibrations through an internal action resulting from the sudden changes in humidity and temperature at dawn\n\nSo a legend appeared that the statue emits sounds of lamentation by the mother of the Ethiopian hero Memnon Aurora, goddess of dawn, over her son who fell in the field of Troy every morning.\n\nFrom him the name of the two statues was taken. King Amenhotep III also issued many commemorative scarabs, of which we know five scarabs that have been preserved over time. The oldest of them confirms the title of Queen Tiye as the main queen.\n\nThe death of King Amenhotep III and his tomb\n\nKing Amenhotep III died after ruling for 38 years, at the age of fifty, perhaps due to an unknown illness. The tomb that he prepared for himself was discovered in 1799, which is tomb No. 22 in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nIt was discovered by Gouloh and Devillier. It was found empty and the walls were destroyed due to pressure and weather factors, and his mummy was not inside it.\n\nHis mummy was found in a cemetery near Deir el-Bahri. It was hidden by priests and discovered in 1881."
