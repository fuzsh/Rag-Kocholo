        "text": "DESCRIPTION: Here is a presentation gift to none other than the head of the entire Hitler Youth organization Reichsjugendführer Baldur von Schirach. It was presented by the Rhein and Ruhr Niederrhain district of the Hitler Youth and signed by Heinz Deinalt, the district führer and presented at the city of Düsseldorf on the 30th of October 1936. It was presented to v. Schirach on the fifth anniversary of his commission as Reichs youth leader. On October 30, 1931, Adolf Hitler appointed 24-year-old Baldur v. Schirach to the new position of Reichsjugendführer dealing with all youth matters. The scroll is beautiful. It is on genuine parchment paper that measures a large 32 x 11 1/2 inches in size. Its rolled and contained in a silver cylinder that is highly engraved with presentation words and a great youth-leader-style eagle that clutches both the cogged wheel and swastika and the youth diamond. There is an oak-leaf motif that is the central motif and design. The cylinder is marked with the 925 silver designation and the entire piece is crafted in silver of the highest grade of the precious metal used in German jewelry and object dart. The cylinder has an engraved section that proclaims: Die Gebietsschule abtl. Handwerk Duisburg-Hamborn. (This is translated as the Area School Section Handwork in the hamlets of Duisburg and Hamborn. On the area just above the bottom cap it says in engraving: Die Jugend von Ruhr und Rhein, The Youth of the Ruhr-Rhein river regions, and at the top 30 Oktober 1936. On the back of the cap is that date corresponding exactly with the date in 1931 when Schirach was appointed and on the front of this opening cap is the magnificent eagle previously mentioned and the maker mark and silver designation. The eagle, except for the double insignia, is typical of a government official-style that v. Schirach would wear being Reichsleiter rank. The capped ends have hammered multicircle design. The scroll is hand done in the height of calligraphy at its finest. The is one of the most important pieces of Third Reich history that we have ever offered at Germania and of course those (other web sites) couldnt hope to match it. V. Schirach was one of the important pivotal individuals of the Third Reich next to Hitler, Himmler, and Göring. The young man formed the youth of the future: Their strength, their morals, their artistic endeavors, their agenda, that, unfortunately, was smashed upon the rocks in 1945 and its like will never be seen again as youth marches today to the sounds of different drummers: A.C.D.C., Kiss, Grateful Dead, and they look up to idols like Paris Hilton, Prince, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson, etc. Oswald Spengler was unfortunately right! Baldur v. Schirach was for a few short years the leader of the youth that would have formed the Aryan Imperium of tomorrow. The von Schirachs were an aristocratic family (ennobled by the Empress Maria Theresa in 1776, hence von Schirach), which had strong connections with the United States. Baldur's paternal great-grandfather emigrated to America in 1855, and his son, Friedrich Karl, served as a major in the Union Army during the Civil War, subsequently marrying into one of America's patrician families. In 1871, he returned to Germany with his American wife, where Baldur's father, Karl Baily Norris von Schirach, was born. Von Schirach père remained in Germany, pursuing the career of an army officer, but reinforced the United States family connection by marrying an American girl, a Miss Emma Middleton Tillou of Philadelphia, in 1896. Baldur, the offspring of this union, was born on March 9, 1907. The following year his father resigned his commission to become director of the theater at Weimar. Brought up the pampered child of well-to-do parents with artistic leanings, young Baldur was dispatched to Munich University to study art history and German folklore. In Munich, the epicenter of the Nazi movement, Baldur became a member of the inner circle of its leadership, through his friendship with Hitler's personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, whose daughter he later married. He enrolled in the NSDAP on May 9, 1925, (Party number 17,251) and at the same time, he joined the ranks of the SA (among the burly stalwarts of the Storm Troops. At 24, von Schirach now occupied what was soon to prove one of the key posts in the Nazi hierarchy. Numerous incompetent HJ bosses were dismissed or downgraded, their places being taken in the main by former NSS and NSDSt.B leaders. The class composition of the HJ had been radically altered by the time von Renteln resigned in June 1932. Von Schirach now assumed personal control of both the HJ and the NSS (which the latter was shortly thereafter obliged to merge with the HJ). Thus in July 1932, von Schirach had become the indisputable supreme leader of the NSDAP's youth, and within a year all of Germany's youth. The Weimar Republic was visibly tottering. In its justifiable alarm at the escalation of street violence, the authorities tried to ban all political militias. Hitler foresaw this possibility, and, fearing that the HJ might be banned along with its SA \"parent,\" decided to sever the formal link between the two. On May 13, 1932, he issued a decree which released the HJ from its subordination to the Chief of Staff of the SA. Von Schirach was elevated to the status of a Department Head (Amtsleiter) at NSDAP headquarters answerable only to Hitler. The Hitler Youths' independence was now absolute. The decree came too late; however, to save the HJ from the ban which was nationwide and in force from April 13th until it was repealed on June 17th. In the General Election of July 31, 1932, the NSDAP won 230 seats in the Reichstag, making it the largest single party, although without an overall majority. Among the new Reichstag deputies was Baldur von Schirach. By way of celebrating his success, von Schirach arranged for a National Youth Day to be held at Potsdam that October. The RJF anticipated a possible turnout of around 20,000. The reality surpassed his wildest expectations. Some 100,000 young persons (15,000 of them girls) took part in a giant rally on October 1st/2nd. It was a triumph for Hitler and von Schirach. Only 3 years previously the HJ contingent at Nürnberg had numbered a mere 2,000. A second general election was held on November 6, 1932. In it the Nazis lost some of the ground they had won in July but still remained the largest single party in the Reichstag. After a series of backstairs deals and intrigues, which need not concern us here, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor (Prime Minister) of Germany on January 30, 1933. The youth sections of the outlawed political parties vanished, of course. Hitler would not tolerate any other youth group in Germany. On June 17, 1933, a significant alteration was announced to the Reichsjugendführer title that v. Schirach bore. He became Jugendführer des Deutschen Reichs (Youth leader of the German Reich). Now all German youth came within the sphere of his authority. Much abut the Hitler Youth and its leader can be found on the internet (go Googling!) Most of the material is despoiled by the writers who stand firmly on the left or meekly on the capitalistic neo-con right. Perhaps a glint of truth or at least rather unbiased truth might leak out if one can stand to wade through the fragrant garbage. As we have said before: History is written by the winners of a war and they write the history of the losers as well! This piece of prestigious, vastly important history is offered as a real Andenken memorabilia of an effort to create a youth as Hitler put it: In my view, German youth must be slim and trim; as swift as a greyhound, tough as leather, and as hard as Krupps steel!\n\nThe following is the translation of the parchment scroll:\n\nAs a token for your help in connection with the schooling and training of our youth groups composed of creative National Socialist youth, our district extends to you now (presents) the district schools and divisional guilds in district Duisburg-Hamborn. The youth membership have produced (this esteemed work) as a gift to you. It is from the youth of the Ruhr-Niederrhein on the fifth anniversary of your appointment (as national youth leader) You, alone, determined our path! Another key to the gates of leadership will never be found because achievement through work is the only key. Whomsoevers hand holds this key, whether it be a laborers son, a builders son, or the son of an academically learned man, it matters not. Only one thing is important; he must be reborn into the nobility of work and of this particular nobility, our new youth are very well acquainted. From this charge we will therefore build up our noble handworkers schooling. This gift shall be but an expression of our strong and deterimed will to march skillfully in the path where you have led us. Heil Hitler! The city Düsseldorf 30 Oct 1936. Heinz Deinalt\n\nPRICE: NO LONGER AVAILABLE."
