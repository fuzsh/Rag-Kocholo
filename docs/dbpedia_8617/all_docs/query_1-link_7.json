        "text": "Origins\n\nThe roots of the Hitler Youth begin before the Nazi’s rise to power. From the 1920s children were targeted by the Nazi Party for exposure to their ideas, such as race consciousness. They were prepared for potential future entry into the SA; the Nazi Party’s paramilitary like organisation, the Storm Troopers (Sturmabteilung). Conformity and loyalty were of paramount importance.\n\nThe original youth movement was established in 1926, and developed into a distinct organisation to train children intended to become Nazis of the future. After Adolf Hitler’s rise to power as Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the move towards incorporation of all other youth groups such as Catholic groups, and outlaw of the Boy Scouts, ensured inclusion of as many children as possible.\n\nIn December 1936, the Law on the Hitler Youth decreed that German children should join the Hitler Youth. Further legislation called the Regulations on implementing the Law on the Hitler Youth made membership mandatory in 1939. These laws required all children who fitted Nazi racial ideals to serve in the Hitler Youth from the ages of ten to eighteen. Specifically, boys aged between 10 and 14 would form the Deutschen Jungvolk [DJ] and those between 14 and 18 would form the Hitler Youth. Membership increased to 5.4 million children prior to 1939.\n\nThe League of German Girls\n\nChildren were split into groups based on their age and gender. Girls between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one would join The League of German Girls, known as the BDM (Bund Deutsche Mädel), while girls between the ages of ten and fourteen joined the Jungmädelbund (JM). These were designed to prepare young women for their futures as mothers in the Third Reich. The BDM focused on educating young women in sports, racial awareness, and community work in order to prepare them for their role as mothers.\n\nOther Youth groups\n\nCatholic Youth groups were a popular part of German society prior to the rise of Nazism. Members of the Hitler Youth were known to harass members of these groups which faced pressure due to the Catholic Church’s refusal to comply with the Hitler Youth regulations. Although the Concordat of 1933 did allow some protection for Catholic groups, by 1939 when the Hitler Youth became mandatory, many Catholic groups had been disbanded.\n\nJewish youth groups including Maccabi Hatza’ir and Blau Weiss maintained large numbers of members through the interwar years. Following Adolf Hitler’s rise to power, Jewish youth groups remained openly for a short time. However, by 1939 it became obvious that Jewish groups would not be tolerated.\n\nJazz groups were a large part of youth society in the inter war years. After 1933, the popular Swing Youth (Swingjugend) developed into a protest movement as the Nazi regime demanded boycotting of all ‘alien’ culture, including jazz music.\n\nFollowing the absorption of all other groups into the Hitler Youth, many members of former groups still met in secret at great risk to themselves.\n\nLeadership of the Hitler Youth\n\nThe leadership emphasised conformity throughout the Hitler Youth movement. The original leader of the Hitler Youth from the 1920s until 1931 was Kurt Gruber, however he was criticised due to the youth movement’s slow growth comparative to the wider Nazi party. The movement gathered momentum under Baldur Von Schirach, who was appointed leader of the youth in the German Reich in 1933. At this time the movement grew and strengthened its militaristic atmosphere. In 1940 after criticism from other leading Nazi officials that Baldur Von Schirach would be incapable of creating a force as ardent as required by Adolf Hitler, Artur Axmann was given control. Although the Hitler Youth had been militarised before, Axmann introduced further practical training to the program, and took a more aggressive stance on the teaching of ideals. Artur Axmann remained in control of the movement until the end of the Second World War, where he commanded Hitler Youth members in the Battle of Berlin."
