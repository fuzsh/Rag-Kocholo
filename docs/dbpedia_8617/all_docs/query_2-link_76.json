        "text": "Ferdinand von Schirach is a German lawyer who has made a formidable literary reputation in Europe with his story collections Crime (2009), Guilt (2010) and Punishment (2018), lightly fictionalised accounts of cases he and his colleagues have worked on. What gets the critics swooning is not just his juicy subject matter but his ruminative, poetic sensibility: the books are Rumpole by way of Rilke.\n\nPart of the appeal of these stories lies in von Schirach’s questing philosophical digressions, immensely serious but often playful, in which human morality is anatomised and the shortcomings of the German legal system are scrutinised but easy answers calmly eschewed, in a way that puts our own shrilly dogmatic Twitter KCs to shame.\n\nHis latest book reads, to a large extent, like the result of what would happen if an editor cut all the digressions out of his latest manuscript and threw them into the wastepaper basket, and then accidentally sent the basket off to the printers. It is a series of brief observations, reflections, recollections: pensées too short to be classed as essays, anecdotes too slight to qualify as stories.\n\nFew chapters last for three or more pages and many comprise only a paragraph or two. The shorter ones are often historical nuggets – the news that Telekom is naming its new phone tariffs “Magenta” prompts von Schirach to recall that the colour is named after the town in Lombardy where so many soldiers died in battle in 1859 that the earth turned red – or reports of idiotic statements by politicians, presented without comment (“Data protection is all very well, but in times of crisis like these, security takes priority,” declares a German minister after a terrorist attack in Brussels).\n\nThe barrier between fact and fiction is even more slippery here than in von Schirach’s earlier books. There is a chilling sketch of a woman who causes her husband an agonising death by putting poison in his toothpaste (“the police find two of the man’s teeth in the shower tray; he had broken them off as he bit down on its edge”), but is it a case history, pure invention, or a bit of both?\n\nOne doesn’t believe the first-person narrator of another chapter, to whom a lawyer called Baumann confesses that he has destroyed evidence damaging to the client he has fallen in love with, is really von Schirach: it would amount to a confession of having colluded in perverting the course of justice. But we are clearly meant to take other chapters as genuine reminiscence, such as the account of von Schirach going to see Raiders of the Lost Ark in the 1980s and a fellow cinemagoer being so delighted with it that he plies the projectionist with cash to run it again immediately. It was Mick Jagger.\n\nThe first chapter in the book is one of the few written in the third person, describing a 15-year-old boy’s suicide attempt; we know from interviews he has given that this is von Schirach talking about himself. His evocation of the depression he endured as a teenager (“Oil begins to drip from the ceiling onto his forehead… into his ears and mouth, clogging his eyes. He breathes it in, becomes numb, and then he himself is the blue-black oil”) is von Schirach at his economical best, conveying years of suffering in a handful of pages.\n\nVon Schirach has written elsewhere about his notorious grandfather – Baldur von Schirach, leader of the Hitler Youth and later Reich Governor of Vienna, who sent some 65,000 Austrian Jews to the death camps – and so there is little about him in this book, apart from occasional reflections such as “Perhaps my anger and shame at his words and deeds have… shaped who I am.” The more philosophical stretches of this book often return to the theme of the importance of the rule of law as a means for humanity to preserve itself from its worst instincts: “The English Magna Carta, the American Bill of Rights… these are our victories over nature, our victories over ourselves.”\n\nBut for all his conspicuous good sense and forensic ability to dismantle the crypto-fascist rhetoric prevalent in European politics, von Schirach is at his most appealing when at his least lawyerly. There is a very funny, self-mocking piece about his unwise decision to accept an assignment to cover Paris Fashion Week, and, as a beleaguered smoker in an aseptic world, he offers us a wonderfully dotty defence of smoking, in which he praises West Germany’s chancellor Helmut Schmidt – not somebody, one feels, for whom he had much political sympathy – for his “wonderfully arrogant exhalation of smoke over other people’s heads”.\n\nVeering between the insightful and the oblique, some of these jottings sear themselves on to your mind instantly; some initially seem pointless but yield hidden depths the more you chew them over; some initially seem pointless and continue to do so. But one quickly develops a taste for von Schirach’s unpredictable musings, a taste which has become such a full-blown addiction by the end of the book that you wish it was twice as long.\n\nCoffee and Cigarettes, tr Katharina Hall, is published by Baskerville at £16.99.
