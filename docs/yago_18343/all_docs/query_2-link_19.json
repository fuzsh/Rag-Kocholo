        "text": "A long time ago, nearly 53 years ago, the bell tolled for an 11-year-old boy who innocently trusted his fatherâs friend.\n\nIt was on an early Tuesday morn (February 8, 1966), that the sacristan (helper) of St. Ritaâs Church, Ratmalana, set in a 1Â½-acre block of land, with the sound of waves in the background, went to the well just behind the church for a pail of water.\n\nMay be he was still half-asleep, but as the pail went down into the murky depths, it did not hit water but something else. Surprised, he rushed back to his room and armed with a torch got back to the well to shine down a light.\n\nImagine his horror when the most unexpected sight greeted his eyes â a body!\n\nThings happened quickly thereafter, we hear from people around the church. The Parish Priest had to be told.\n\nSoon after, the frantic tolling of the church bell, reminiscent of medieval times, alerted the devotees that something was amiss and they gathered, to be told of the terrible discovery. With the information being passed onto the police, the body was brought out.\n\nIt was a child, in shorts and shirt, who would be identified as Ramdas Gotabhaya Kirambakanda.\n\nFor his untimely death in a watery grave, a young woman, Pauline de Croos was sentenced to death, the death penalty being upheld in appeal. Pauline, whose death penalty was commuted to a life sentence, and was finally released much later, we hear has migrated to Australia– some say she is still living there.\n\nAt the time of Gotabhayaâs murder, Pauline had been 20 going on 21. Today (November 4) is supposed to be her 73rd birthday.\n\nNewspapers of yore dubbed it the âwell-deathâ, âwell-murderâ and the âboy-in-the wellâ reporting the case in detail, as people in Colombo particularly Dehiwela, Mount Lavinia and Ratmalana were gripped not only by curiosity but also horror.\n\nAs we wander back down the corridors of time, firstly accessing dusty and yellowed newspapers of the time, then case records and finally following the trail to homes, school and church where the body was found, a tale of unhappy families, neglected children, questionable morals on many sides, lavish parties, a pretence of keeping up the veneer of respectability, all ending in the murder of an innocent, emerges.\n\nâGotabhaya and I were classmates at Hena Vidyalaya in Mount Lavinia and also played the tambourine in the school western band,â says Attorney-at-Law Damitha De Silva, producing a black-and-white photograph.\n\nThe first intimation that his classmates got that Gotabhaya was in serious trouble was when they saw a bare-chested man in sarong running straight into Principal M. Wijepalaâs office, as the boys watched from their class.\n\nâMr. Wijepala rang the main bell a little while later and made a sombre announcement that Gotabhayaâs body had been found in a well. This was the first news we got,â says Damitha.\n\nEarlier, we had picked up the trail of people who figured in this long-ago murder down Quarry Road, snaking parallel to Allan Avenue, behind the rear wall of the Dehiwela Zoo.\n\nâYes, my mother had rented her upstair house to the Croos family. This is the house. Soon after the incident, the de Croos family left. Now, however, the house looks different as it has been renovated. Earlier, it had been a parana thale geyak (old fashioned house), an upstair made of kabok with an arch at the front,â says the daughter, adding that her mother used to speak of the case which took Dehiwela by storm.\n\nThe schoolbag of Gotabhaya had been found in a garden quite close to the de Croos home.\n\nOur next stop is Kawdana Broadway, where the Kirambakanda family lived, once again on rent â father Bodhipala, mother Jessica, youngest child Gotabhaya and his two older sisters.\n\nA school at the top of the road is just concluding its lessons and children, both boys and girls, rush out happy to be out of class.\n\nImages of Pauline, going to another school, Hena (now Lalith Athulathmudali) Vidyalaya in Mount Lavinia and taking Gotabhaya out during the interval on some excuse, comes into our mindâs eye.\n\nMany are the old timers in Kawdana who confirm that they knew the Kirambakanda family very well and also saw Pauline visiting their home.\n\nâEe podi lamaya (Gotabhaya) ape watta udin thama iskole giye,â says Sumathipala, explaining that the child went to school through his property. He shows us the area where the adi para (footpath) had been.\n\nThere were few houses then and those houses were not surrounded by walls like now, we are told, but had weta (fences). Everyone lifted the barbed wire and crept through into each otherâs properties.\n\nLittle details not mentioned in the newspapers but which had been the talk in hushed tones among the neighbours of those days, we hear. There were many squabbles between Bodhipala and Jessica, but all are insistent that both Bodhipala and Jessica loved Gotabhaya very much.\n\nâThis was a quiet neighbourhood,â say others, but the Kirambakanda home was a hive of activity, as parties were galore with high profile personalities dropping by often. Pauline was also a frequent visitor.\n\nAfter the murder of Gotabhaya, the rumour mill worked overtime, with suggestions that someone had placed a lot of money (Rs. 50,000, a princely sum in the 1960s) for the welfare of the boy and he was killed to get at that money. It seemed like a botched up kidnapping, they still speculate, adding that two others were also said to be involved. The story goes that Pauline took Gotabhaya from school, drugged him and was seen praying at St. Ritaâs with the boy next to her on a pew. Later, she had been seen with the boy at the well, but there are no clues whether she carried him or was helped by someone.\n\nIt transpired in the evidence of a Medical Officer of the Colombo South Hospital that in January or early February, Pauline came to him and complained of sleeplessness and headaches. He prescribed three pills. Witness had known her for about a year before she came to get medicine and sometimes he had seen Kirambakanda at her place.\n\nâThough my brother was slightly older, he and Gotabhaya were close friends and Gotabhaya was in and out of our house. He used to have his meals with us,â said an old resident, adding that âre wenakan apith ekka innawa (he used to be with us till night)â.\n\nEven on the day of the tragedy, their brother and Gotabhaya went to school the same way they had been doing over the years. They walked up to Dehiwela Junction, Gotabhaya turned left to board a bus for Mount Lavinia and their brother turned right and headed for Isipathana.\n\nThe day before Gotabhayaâs disappearance, their brother and Gotabhaya had done some work in the garden, planting a kehel pele (plantain tree) close to the Maha Gedera. The mammoty (kotapu udella) was there, where they had left it, even during the boyâs funeral, said the resident, recalling that their brother did not eat his meals for about a week as he was very upset over Gotabhayaâs death.\n\nKawdana was rural then â lots of paddyfields and Broadway had a kurundu kelle (cinnamon jungle), an abundance of coconut and kitul palms, as well as dang and ma-dang trees.\n\nâWetawal waling penala, lamai niyara uding duwala, sellam karanawa,â the resident says, adding that the children would jump over fences and run along the niyara.\n\nGotabhaya was a thin lad, a nice boy, is what everyone says.\n\nWe speak to another family which says that Bodhipala was a businessman dealing in ornamental fish and Jessica was âhari lassanaiâ in her osariya.\n\nThey add that even on the day that Gotabhaya disappeared, âroti kala ape watta udin thama giye hathe bus eka allanna (he ate roti and went across our garden to catch the 7 oâclock bus)â.\n\nWhen the news came that a body had been found in a well in a churchyard, it was another resident who was about 20 years old at that time who took Bodhipala to the Lunawa Hospital to identify the body.\n\nâI drove my fatherâs car there. We walked into a room and saw Gotabhayaâs body. Bodhipala broke down, keeping his head on my shoulder and vowing revenge against those responsible,â he says. He was also present at the inquest.\n\nWhen Gotabhayaâs bag was recovered, once again it was this 20-year-old who took Jessica to the Dehiwela Police Station to identify it. âIt was a small suitcase and his books were in it. There was a postcard indicating a song that he wished to be played on a musical programme, with his two sisters names on it.â (It was an era when there were no TVs, only radios and people could write in requesting the radio station to play a song of their choice.)\n\nPauline miniyata ava, scarf ekak bendagena, others recall, having seen Pauline coming for the funeral wearing a scarf.\n\nSometime later they heard a commotion at the Kirambakanda home, to find that Bodhipala was being arrested. Thereafter, the owners of the house had got the Fiscal to throw out the Kirambakanda family â with people seeing their stuff lying on the road.\n\nThe house still stands, looking slightly abandoned and we hear that there is a single boarder there.\n\nOnto St. Ritaâs Church we head, and people tell us how they had seen Pauline there on many days, seated on a pew at the back. âThe case created an aandolanaya (furore) in those days.â\n\nWe get the scene of those times â the beautiful little church, compared to its more magnificent sisters and the Mission House where the priest resides being just a tiny room.\n\nâThe church was always open like all Roman Catholic churches. Anybody could come here, pray and leave,â says D.S.E.W. Jayasuriya (85), adding that the incident took place on a weekday and people had seen Pauline with Gotabhaya, sitting inside the church.\n\nWhen the boyâs body was taken out of the well, the bell was rung and people gathered at the church. The police were informed thereafter. Parish Priest Fr. Hebastraw immediately ordered the closure of the well, he says.\n\nWith the parishioners being upset over the incident, the church had undergone a name-change from St. Ritaâs to St. Maryâs.\n\nAs we leave, we see two boys, may be slightly younger than Gotabhaya playing in the churchyard oblivious of the tragedy that occurred here nearly 53 years ago.\n\nAccording to reports on the court case a doctor had given evidence that the boy was alive when he hit the water in the well. Death was due to asphyxia from drowningâ¦â¦.the stomach contents were three to four ounces of odourless liquid. The boy would not have had a meal for about seven or eight hours before death. The boy would have been dropped into the well after 3.30 p.m. on February 7 and before 3.30 a.m. the following morning (February 8).\n\nA young life snuffed out â was it for illicit love or was it for money? Was it a kidnapping gone wrong? Was it only Pauline who was involved or were there others? Was Pauline innocent and was there a miscarriage of justice?\n\nMany are the secrets forever lost with Gotabhaya, whose father had insisted on cremating him."
