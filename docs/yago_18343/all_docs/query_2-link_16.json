Base-editing enzymes are commonly delivered in the form of modified linear messenger RNA (mRNA) that is costly to produce. Here, we address this problem by developing a simple protocol for manufacturing base-edited cells using circular RNA (circRNA), which is less expensive to synthesize. Compared with linear mRNA, higher editing efficiencies were achieved with circRNA, enabling an 8-fold reduction in the amount of RNA required. We used this protocol to manufacture a clinical dose (1 × 108 cells) of base-edited chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells lacking expression of the inhibitory receptor, PD-1. Editing efficiencies of up to 86% were obtained using 0.25 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells. Increased editing efficiencies with circRNA were attributed to more efficient translation. These results suggest that circRNA, which is less expensive to produce than linear mRNA, is a viable option for reducing the cost of manufacturing base-edited cells at scale.\n\nKeywords: base editing, BE4max, chimeric antigen receptor, circular RNA, PD-1, TIM3\n\nPule and colleagues present a cost-effective and simplified strategy for the delivery of cytosine base editors into human T cells. As an alternative to linear mRNA, the authors utilize covalently closed circular RNA, which circumvents the need for RNA modification and reduces the amount of RNA required for efficient base editing.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCell engineering is revolutionizing the treatment of genetic diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancers. The advent of early gene-editing tools, such as transcription factor-like endonucleases (TALENS), zinc finger nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9), has greatly extended the possibilities of cell therapies by enabling the disruption of genes1,2,3,4,5 and targeted gene insertion.6,7,8,9,10,11 These approaches rely on the formation of DNA double-stranded breaks, which are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end-joining to introduce insertions or deletions that disrupt gene expression, or alternatively by homology-directed repair to mediate gene integration. However, particularly when multiplexing, gene editing can result in aneuploidy, chromosomal translocations, and significant genotoxicity.1,12,13,14,15\n\nBase editing is an alternative method that uses enzymes to modify DNA without generating DNA double-stranded breaks, thus reducing the likelihood of translocations.16,17,18 Base editing involves directing a deaminase domain, via a DNA-binding domain, to a specific site in the genome where it modifies target bases to either introduce19,20,21 or correct mutations.22,23,24 Early base editors fused Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) to a deaminase domain, with targeting being mediated by the guide RNA (gRNA) to which Cas9n binds. Adenine and cytosine deaminase domains, which convert adenosine to guanosine (A to G)25,26 and cytidine to thymidine (C to T)27 in DNA, respectively, have been mutated to alter their specificity or to reduce off-target editing.28,29,30\n\nBase editor technology is rapidly advancing the field of cell and gene therapies. The correction of pathogenic mutations is a promising strategy for the treatment of genetic diseases, including sickle cell anemia,24 β-thalassaemia,31 Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome,22 spinal muscular atrophy,32 and familial hypercholesterolemia.33,34 Base editors are also being employed to facilitate precise gene disruption through the introduction of stop codons or perturbation of mRNA splicing.18,21 This approach is being adopted for the production of allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies.17,35 The results of a first-in-human clinical trial have been recently reported for three T-ALL patients receiving anti-CD7 CAR T cells engineered with disruptive edits of the TRBC, CD7, and CD52 genes.36 Despite reports of multilineage cytopenia, the results support further investigation of base-edited CAR T products.36\n\nApproaches to delivering base-editing enzymes include mRNA or ribonucleic protein (RNP) complex transfection,31,37 and transduction with adeno-associated virus (AAV).18,32 Messenger RNA delivery is the favored approach due to challenges with purifying the base editor protein37 and the cost of producing AAV. While mRNA transfection is the most widely adopted approach,17,35,36 modifications are required to introduce stabilizing elements such as a 5′ 7-methylguanylate cap and a 3′ poly adenylated [poly(A)] tail. Modified nucleosides may also be incorporated to reduce degradation.38,39 For clinical applications, large quantities of high-purity capped and tailed mRNA are required. The expense of producing linear mRNA is currently a barrier to clinical application of base editing. Approaches that simplify mRNA production and/or result in a lower requirement are hence desirable.\n\nThe use of circular RNA (circRNA), where the 5′ and 3′ ends of the molecule are covalently joined, not only circumvents the requirement for the RNA to be capped and poly(A) tailed, but also offers increased stability due to exonuclease resistance. Several methods exist for generating circRNA,40,41,42 but the most frequently used is permuted intron-exon (PIE) self-splicing RNAs,43,44,45 which promote back-splicing to facilitate circularization. Through the inclusion of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), it is possible to direct translation of coding sequences from circRNAs and achieve higher levels of expression compared with linear mRNA.41,46,47 Here, we explored the utility of circRNA encoding the cytosine base editor, BE4max, for large-scale base-editing. We compared the stability and efficacy of linear and circular BE4max RNA for base editing-induced disruption of TIM3 and PD-1 expression. We also demonstrated application of circular base editor RNA in a semi-closed manufacturing protocol for the large-scale production of base-edited CAR T cells.\n\nResults\n\nRNA encoding the cytosine base editor BE4max can be circularized\n\nWe first sought to determine if a PIE self-splicing RNA strategy could efficiently circularize RNA encoding BE4max, which has a relatively long coding sequence. BE4max was cloned into a plasmid containing the PIE sequence from the group I intron of Anabaena pre-tRNA45,46 ( A). A linear RNA template with 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and a poly(A) signal sequence was also generated as a control ( A). RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription (IVT) and circRNA produced by promoting back-splicing; while linear RNA was capped, and poly(A) tailed ( B and 1C).\n\nFractionation of the linear mRNA on a bioanalyzer indicated that it was of the expected length of 5,990 bases ( D). Analysis of the circRNA indicated faster migration after circularization, consistent with its shorter length of 6,497 bases ( D, left lane). Bands corresponding to the size of the released introns (5′ intron, 624 bases and 3′ intron, 181 bases) were also present ( D, right lane). A circularization efficiency of 68.7% was determined from bioanalyzer data ( E).\n\nTo confirm circularization, the circRNA was reverse transcribed and the region spanning the exon 1 and exon 2 splice site amplified by PCR and Sanger sequenced. This clearly demonstrated that the exons were fused, and the RNA was circular ( F). Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of producing circRNA encoding BE4max from in vitro transcribed RNA using the self-splicing Anabaena pre-tRNA PIE sequence.\n\nEnhanced BE4max expression from circRNA\n\nNext, we explored BE4max expression from circRNA in primary human T cells. CD4+/CD8+ sorted T cells were nucleofected with 4.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells of linear or circRNA. Cellular lysates were prepared from the 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h samples and western blotting carried out with an anti-Cas9 antibody mix to enable BE4max detection ( A and S1A). The BE4max protein (212.6 kDa) was detectable 24 h after nucleofection with circRNA, followed by a gradual decrease in expression over the course of 72 h ( A and S1A). On the other hand, the BE4max expression from linear mRNA was significantly lower and was below the limit of detection in one donor (Figure S1A, top panel). As cells were nucleofected with comparable amounts of RNA, these results suggest a higher translational capacity of circRNA than linear mRNA. To determine whether RNA stability was a contributing factor, we investigated the rate of RNA decay in nucleofected T cells.\n\nTo determine the rate of RNA degradation, RNA was extracted from cells within the first 2 h and then at 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h post-nucleofection. RT-qPCR was carried out to quantify transcript copy numbers of the BE4max base editor along with the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) ( B, S1B, and S1C). BE4max transcript copy numbers were normalized to GAPDH, and RNA decay was determined by further normalization to the initial starting time point. These data revealed similar rates of decay for BE4max linear and circRNA, with ∼90% of RNA degradation occurring within the first 24 h ( B). Reducing the RNA amount from 4.00 μg to 0.25 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells did not appear to affect the kinetics of decay ( B, S1B, and S1C).\n\nCircRNA efficiently directs base editing in primary human T cells\n\nTo compare base-editing efficiencies obtained using linear or circular RNA, stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were nucleofected with BE4max RNA and a non-targeting or a targeting single guide RNA (sgRNA) directed to the T cell inhibitory receptors, TIM3 (HAVCR2) or PD-1 (PDCD1) ( A and 3B). PBMCs from five or three donors were nucleofected with increasing amounts of linear or circular RNA, ranging from 0.25 μg to 4.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells and a fixed amount of sgRNA (30 pmol/1 × 106 cells). After 4 days, T cells were restimulated to up-regulate the expression of the target genes and the following day, surface expression was determined ( A and 3B, bottom panels).\n\nSuccessful HAVCR2 editing was demonstrated with 4.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells of circular and linear RNA by a decrease in the mean percentage of TIM3+ T cells to 10.3% and 20.1%, compared with 76.6% and 75.7% in the non-targeting control samples, respectively ( C). In T cells receiving 0.25 μg, 0.50 μg, 1.00 μg, and 2.00 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells, the mean percentage of TIM3+ T cells was reduced to 31.1%, 19.1%, 14.6%, and 10.9%, respectively ( C). Beyond 2.00 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells, no further decrease in TIM3+ T cells was observed ( C). As 0.50 μg of circRNA and 4.00 μg of linear mRNA resulted in similar reductions of TIM3+ T cells (19.1% and 20.1%, respectively), approximately eight times less circRNA was required for efficient base editing ( C).\n\nPDCD1 gene disruption was also explored using previously described guides ( B).18 The mean percentage of PD-1+ T cells was 56.0% and 63.2% in the non-targeting control samples and 10.7% and 10.1% in those receiving the PD-1 sgRNA and 4.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells of circular or linear RNA, respectively ( D). Although disruption was similar at 4.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells, when the RNA amount was titrated down to 2.00 μg, 1.00 μg, 0.50 μg, and 0.25 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells, circRNA was more efficient at disrupting PDCD1 than linear mRNA. The mean percentage of PD-1+ T cells was reduced to 8%, 4.2%, 15.6%, and 19.9% using circRNA, compared with 20.0%, 31.6%, 43.3%, and 52.1% using linear mRNA, respectively ( D). Some donor-to-donor variability in PDCD1 editing efficiency was observed, depending on which species of RNA was used. The underlying cause of this variability remains to be determined but may reflect differences between the donors in the rate of translation or turnover of the circular and linear RNA. Overall, these data indicate that BE4max circRNA can disrupt the expression of T cell inhibitory receptors more efficiently than linear mRNA.\n\nEfficient base conversion using circRNA is confirmed by sequencing\n\nTo confirm base editing at the genomic level, genotyping was performed by amplifying across the target site, followed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product and determining on-target and bystander base conversion efficiencies using EditR.48 At the HAVCR2 target site, a positive correlation was observed between the amount of RNA and the editing efficiency, with the highest frequency of base conversion occurring at the splice acceptor site (C6 in the base-editing window) and the bystander position at C5 ( A, 4C, and S2A). Near complete base conversion was observed in all donors edited with 4.00 μg and 2.00 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells ( A and 4C). Using 1.00 μg, 0.50 μg, and 0.25 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells, circRNA resulted in 91%, 76%, and 58% on-target editing, compared with 58%, 43%, and 25% with linear mRNA, respectively ( C). CircRNA facilitated greater on-target editing than linear mRNA, most notably at the lower RNA amounts.\n\nSimilarly, genotyping was performed on the PD-1 edited samples to determine the frequency of cytosine conversion within the base-editing window ( B, 4D, and S2B). Cytosines were predominantly converted to thymines, although other base substitutions, including adenine and guanine, were also observed at lower frequencies ( B). Overall, the highest level of target cytosine conversion in the splice donor site (C7 in the base-editing window) was obtained using circRNA, with 1.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells yielding nearly 100% conversion rates, substantially higher than the 44% and 80% editing with 1.00 μg and 4.00 μg linear mRNA/1 × 106 cells, respectively ( D). These results indicate more efficient on-target editing with circRNA than linear mRNA.\n\nLarge-scale manufacturing of base-edited CAR T cells using circRNA\n\nWe next tested circRNA-mediated base editing in a large-scale CAR T manufacturing process ( A). CD4+/CD8+ cells were isolated from leukapheresate using the CliniMACS Prodigy and activated for 2 days prior to nucleofection with BE4max circRNA and either the PD-1 or non-targeting sgRNA. Two different amounts of circRNA, 0.25 μg and 1.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells, were tested in three healthy donors each. The nucleofected T cells were transduced with lentiviral vector containing an anti-CD19 CAR49,50,51,52 on day 3 ( A, 5B, S3, and S4) and transduced and non-transduced T cells were cultured for 9 days before cryopreservation ( A).\n\nNo differences in transduction efficiency or expansion were observed between the different amounts of circRNA and the non-targeting or PD-1 sgRNA (Figures S3, S4A, and S4C). Edited CAR T cells expanded approximately 2- to 3-fold to achieve ∼1 × 108 cells from ∼5 × 106 nucleofected cells, with similar viabilities to the no pulse control cells by day 9 (Figure S4C; Tables S1–S4). The exhaustion profiles of non-targeting-edited or PD-1-edited cells on day 9 were as follows: few PD-1+ T cells were observed across all samples, the TIM3+ population was generally lower in donors edited with 0.25 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells compared with 1.00 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells, and the percentage of LAG3+ T cells was comparable across all samples and the amount of RNA (Figure S5).\n\nThe efficiency of PD-1 editing was determined by carrying out EditR analysis ( C and 5D). Although no editing was detected with the non-targeting sgRNA, the PD-1 sgRNA resulted in near complete conversion of the target cytosine (C7 in the editing window) to thymine in all three donors, as well as the adjacent bystander cytosine (C8) when nucleofected with 1.00 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells ( C, right). Base editing with 0.25 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells was slightly less efficient, with a lower on-target conversion rate of 86% ( C, left). Bystander editing was observed within the editing window (C4 and C8), as well as immediately outside (C3) ( C and 5D); however, no other base conversions were observed within the protospacer sequence.\n\nTo confirm that editing of the PD-1 exon 1 splice donor site resulted in loss of protein expression, T cells were restimulated with TransAct for 24 h and stained with antibodies against the inhibitory receptor, PD-1, and activation markers, CD25 (IL-2Rα) and CD69 ( E and 5F). Although restimulation resulted in PD-1 upregulation in all treated samples, the population of PD-1+ T cells was significantly reduced in all PD-1-edited samples. Upregulation of CD25 and CD69 was observed in all restimulated samples regardless of the editing process ( E and 5F). T cells edited with 0.25 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells and the non-targeting or PD-1 sgRNA had mean PD-1+ populations of 22.8% and 4.7%, respectively ( E). For 1.00 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells, the percentage of PD-1+ T cells was ∼2% in the edited sample compared with 49.9% in the non-targeting control sample, whereas CD25 and CD69 were upregulated in both ( F). These results demonstrate that 0.25 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells is an amount sufficient to disrupt gene expression in T cells at large scale.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of base-edited cellular therapies is limited by the complexity and cost of producing long RNA transcripts encoding the base editor enzyme at sufficient quality and scale. Linear mRNA manufacturing requires multiple steps to modify the transcript to incorporate a 5′ 7-methylguanylate cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail. The capping process can either be performed using post-transcriptional capping enzymes, which generates a pool of capped and uncapped transcripts; or by co-transcriptional methods using cap analogs, such as the anti-reverse cap analog (Cap 0)53 and the Cap 1 analogs.54 In addition to the 5′ cap, linear mRNA requires a 3′ poly(A) tail to promote its stability.55 The poly(A) tail can be incorporated either into the DNA template by the addition of thymine bases in the reverse primer, or added post-transcriptionally using enzymatic methods that rely on the poly(A) polymerase. The scalability of linear mRNA manufacturing is limited by the high cost of capping and tailing reagents, as well as the requirement to purify the RNA before and after modification, which can result in a loss of mRNA yield.\n\nAn alternative to linear mRNA is circRNA, which is modified in its structure as the 5′ and 3′ ends of the transcript are covalently closed. CircRNA is potentially advantageous compared with linear mRNA, as it does not require capping or polyadenylation, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. CircRNA can be generated by back-splicing and several PIE self-splicing RNAs have been described, including the group I intron from an Anabaena tRNA,45,46 Tetrahymena theromphila44,45,56 and bacteriophage T4 thymidylate synthase.57 CircRNAs have received increasing interest in the biotechnology field due to their diverse functions. These RNAs can act as aptamers to manipulate cellular functions,58,59 as therapeutic agents to sponge disease-related microRNAs60,61 or proteins,62 or as immunological agents for vaccination.63 Although circRNA has not been described for base-editing purposes, Liu et al. report their use to enhance prime editing efficiencies.64\n\nThe process of generating circRNA is simple and involves IVT of the self-splicing sequence, followed by heating the transcript in a circularization buffer containing magnesium ions and guanosine triphosphate, which initiates the back-splicing process to ligate the exons and release the intronic sequences. Although RNA circularization efficiency is dependent on the transcript length, with longer RNAs being less efficiently circularized than short RNAs,46 we found that circRNA encoding the long base editors (∼6.4 kb) can be efficiently generated in vitro using the Anabaena PIE self-splicing pre-tRNA,46 with a mean circularization efficiency of 68.7%. CircRNA can be purified by lithium chloride precipitation to allow removal of the buffer contaminants while retaining the RNA integrity, unlike column-based approaches, which were found to cause degradation of the transcript (data not shown). Compared with the production of linear mRNA, circRNA offers a simple and streamlined manufacturing process with significantly lower production costs.\n\nAs previous studies have reported the improved half-life and translational capacity of circRNAs,46,65,66,67 we monitored the stability of BE4max-encoding linear and circular RNA in T cells. Surprisingly, RT-qPCR results revealed that linear and circular RNAs decay at a comparable rate; however, circRNA resulted in increased protein production within 24 h of RNA transfection, which led to a prolonged duration of BE4max expression (∼48 h). Unlike linear mRNA, translation from circRNAs occurs in a cap-independent manner and initiates from the IRES and terminates at the stop codon at the 3′ end of the transcript. Polyadenosyl-binding proteins interact with the cap and poly(A) tail of linear mRNA to promote RNA stability and translation initiation,55 and the closed structure of circRNA may aid ribosome recruitment and continuous translation in an analogous manner. Western blotting results supported higher translational activity from the circRNA than the linear RNA.\n\nConsistent with higher translational activity from the circRNA, it was found from titration of the RNA amount in small-scale experiments that less circRNA was required for efficient editing; although donor-specific variability was observed, the RNA amount could be reduced by approximately 8-fold. These results were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis and genomic sequencing of TIM3 and PD-1 base-edited T cells. Large-scale experiments using 0.25 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells supported these data and clearly demonstrated that less circRNA was required for near complete editing of PDCD1.\n\nTo demonstrate scalability of the protocol, we combined base editing of a clinically relevant gene target with the introduction of an anti-CD19 CAR, aiming to manufacture 1 × 108 base-edited CAR T cells. Using CD4+/CD8+ sorted T cells and 1.00 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells, we achieved near complete base conversion at the target splice site at the PDCD1 loci. As the PD-1 sgRNA sequence had been previously validated,18 we did not assess the off-target events in our study. Cas9-dependent off-target editing may be minimized by careful gRNA selection to reduce mismatches with the target sequence. Off-target sites may be predicted using computational tools,68 and the type and frequency of off-target edits can be determined by sequencing methods, such as DiGenome-seq,69,70 GUIDE-seq,71 Detect-seq,72 or whole genome sequencing. Off-target deamination may also occur in a Cas9-independent manner, and the choice of base editor and delivery method may reduce such events.73,74,75,76\n\nThe base-edited T cells were transduced with lentivirus 1 day after nucleofection, and the disruption of PD-1 did not impact the transduction efficiency, with approximately 60% of T cells expressing the CAR. Although a drop in cell number was observed 1 day after nucleofection, the T cells recovered and expanded to meet the dose requirements (1 × 108 CAR T cells) by day 9. By transducing the cells after nucleofection, we were able to reduce the vector requirements compared with transducing the T cells prior to nucleofection. As 100% base conversion was observed in CD4+/CD8+ sorted donors, we set out to reduce the RNA amount by a further 4-fold. By reducing the amount to 0.25 μg circRNA/1 × 106 cells we could achieve 86% base conversion, while maintaining high transduction efficiencies and comparable expansion profiles in PD-1-edited and non-targeting-edited CAR T cells.\n\nCircRNA has a simplified manufacturing workflow, and increased editing efficiencies owing to its high efficiency of translation. To scale the production of circRNA for clinical use, ∼12.5 μg RNA is required for nucleofection of 5 × 107 CD4+/CD8+ sorted T cells, to achieve ∼1 × 108 edited CAR T cells at the end of the culture. Unlike linear mRNA, circRNA does not require verification of capping and polyadenylation; instead, circularization must be confirmed by sequencing the cDNA across the back-splicing junction. CircRNA can be easily distinguished from linear molecules by capillary electrophoresis, due to its reduced size after the release of the intronic sequences. As some linear RNA and intronic sequences remain after circularization, previous reports have treated circRNA with RNase R.66 However, linear RNA digestion is not always complete and RNase R digestion can reduce the yield of circRNA66 due to nicking of the transcript.77\n\nCircRNA may be further improved, as the inclusion of 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences have been found to enhance the translation of circRNA produced using the T4 thymidylate synthase intron.47 Furthermore, the IRES can be engineered with synthetic aptamers to recruit translation initiation machinery.47 Linear mRNA benefits from the incorporation of modified nucleosides, such as pseudouridine, N1-methylpseuodouridine, 5-methylcytidine, and N6-methyladenosine, to reduce its immunogenicity by preventing signaling through Toll-like receptors.78,79,80 Some nucleoside modifications can disrupt back-splicing of PIE sequences,66 but 5% N6-methyladenosine can be incorporated into the bacteriophage T4 thymidylate synthase PIE to increase its stability through resistance to nuclease digestion.47 Optimization of the sgRNA amount for co-delivery with circRNA may further enhance the editing efficiencies, by ensuring sgRNA availability for pairing with the base editor protein. Alternative methods of circRNA transfection may improve the quality of engineered cells, as well as enabling closed and automated manufacturing. Although nucleofection results in a high efficiency of transfection, the high-voltage pulses and serum-free electroporation buffers can cause cell death.81 Recently, the development of mRNA-encapsulated lipid nanoparticles has revolutionized the field of RNA therapeutics and may be simpler and cause less cell loss than electroporation.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrate the application of circRNA for base editing in primary T cells and prove that it is superior to linear mRNA. Our approach can be scaled to manufacture ∼1 × 108 base-edited anti-CD19 CAR T cells with near complete gene disruption. This process could be scaled up to engineer cells for autologous and allogeneic cell therapies. By streamlining circRNA production and reducing the amount of RNA for efficient editing, the cost of base-edited cell therapies can be significantly reduced.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCell lines\n\nHEK-293T (ATCC; VA, USA; CRL-11268) cells were cultured in complete Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) (Sigma-Aldrich; distributed by Merck Life Science UK Ltd., Watford, UK; I3390) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich; distributed by Merck Life Science UK Ltd., Watford, UK; F7524) and 2 mM GlutaMAX-1 (Gibco; distributed by ThermoFisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK; 35050) in a 175-cm2 tissue culture-treated flask in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n\nPlasmids\n\nThe Anabaena PIE self-splicing RNA sequence46 and BE4max coding sequence (taken from AddGene plasmid 112093) were cloned by Golden Gate assembly using ∼1 kb gBlock fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT); Leuven, Belgium). Fragments were amplified by PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs [NEB], Hitchin, UK; M0491), dNTPs (NEB; N0447L) and custom oligonucleotides (IDT), agarose gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen; Manchester, UK; 28706) and ligated into a pUC-derived plasmid (Blue Heron Biotech; WA, USA) using T4 DNA ligase (Roche; distributed by Merck Life Science UK Ltd., Watford, UK; 10716359001). High-efficiency chemically competent bacteria (5-alpha competent E. coli; NEB; C2987) were transformed with the ligation reactions, plated onto antibiotic-laden LB agar plates, and incubated overnight at 37°C.\n\nIn vitro transcription\n\nThe plasmid DNA template for circRNA production was linearized by digestion with a restriction endonuclease whose site was 3′ to the transcript, while the DNA template for linear mRNA production was amplified from plasmid DNA, using a reverse primer that incorporated a 120-base poly(A) tail. RNA was synthesized from linear DNA templates using the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB; E2050S), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After synthesis, RNA was precipitated using LiCl supplied with the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit. Linear RNA was 7-methylguanylate capped using the Vaccinia Capping System (NEB; M2080S) and methylated using 2′-O-methyltransferase (NEB; M0366S) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CircRNA does not require capping or methylation and was resuspended in a circularization buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (Invitrogen; distributed by ThermoFisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK; 15567-027), 10 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen; AM9530G), 1 mM dithiothreitol (ThermoFisher Scientific; 707265ML), and 2 mM guanosine triphosphate (ThermoFisher Scientific; R1461) and was heated to 55°C for 15 min to allow back-splicing to occur. Capped and methylated mRNA or circRNA was purified by LiCl precipitation, resuspended in TE buffer, pH 7.5 (IDT; 11-01-02-02) and quantified using the Qubit RNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit (Invitrogen; {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q10211\",\"term_id\":\"1723279\",\"term_text\":\"Q10211\"}}Q10211). Purified RNA was checked for size and integrity using the 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape reagents (Agilent; Cheshire, UK; RNA ScreenTape; 5067–5576, Sample Buffer; 5067–5577, Ladder; 5067–5578).\n\nProduction of lentiviral supernatant\n\nHEK-293T cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture-treated plates and were transfected at >70% confluency with a VSV-G envelope expression plasmid, an REV expression plasmid, a Gag-Pol expression plasmid, and the transgene of interest expressed in a lentiviral (pCCL) vector plasmid at a ratio of 1:1:2:4 (total DNA = 12.5 μg). Transfections were conducted with GeneJuice (Millipore; distributed by Merck Life Science UK Ltd., Watford, UK; 70967) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and viral supernatants were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Supernatants were pelleted at 400 x g for 5 min to remove cellular debris and were filtered through a 0.45-μM filter before storing at −80°C.\n\nTitration of viral supernatants\n\nFunctional viral titers were calculated using thawed lentiviral supernatant on HEK-293T cells. Lentiviral supernatant was serially diluted and added to HEK-293T cells plated at 50,000 cells per well of a tissue culture-treated 24-well plate in complete IMDM containing 8 μg/mL polybrene (Millipore; TR-1003-G). Transduction was performed by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 10 min before transfer to a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. The percentage of transduced cells was identified by flow cytometry 72 h later, using the anti-CAT-19 idiotype antibody (Autolus; London, UK; produced in-house). Functional viral titers were calculated, using the equation below, from the cells transduced with <20% efficiency, to aim for a vector copy number of one integration per cell.\n\nViraltiter(Transducingunits(TU)/mL)=(numberofcellsplatedx(%transductionefficiency/100))/(vectorvolumeinmL)\n\nPrimary cell culture\n\nPBMCs were isolated from whole human blood (NHS Blood and Transplant; London, UK) by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Sigma-Aldrich; 17-1440-02) and SepMate-50 Tubes (STEMCELL Technologies, Cambridge, UK; 85450). Isolated PBMCs were cryopreserved prior to use and were thawed and cultured in TexMACS GMP Medium (Miltenyi Biotec; Woking, UK; 170-076-306) containing 3% human serum AB off-the-clot (BioIVT; West Sussex, UK; HUMANABSRMC-1) and 10 ng/mL interleukin-7 and -15 (Miltenyi Biotec; IL-7; 130-095-367, IL-15; 130-095-760). Isolated PBMCs were activated using a 1:100 ratio of TransAct (Miltenyi Biotec; 130-111-160) to T cells in cell culture flasks for a duration of 48 h prior to base editing.\n\nFor large-scale experiments, T cells were separated from leukapheresis material using anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec; CD4; 276-01, CD8; 275-01) on the CliniMACS Prodigy instrument (Miltenyi Biotec). The tubing sets (Miltenyi Biotec; 170-076-600) were installed on the Prodigy and positive selection of the CD4+- and CD8+-labeled T cells was carried out according to standard protocols. Sorted T cells were activated using GMP-grade TransAct (Miltenyi Biotec; 170-076-156) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and were cultured in a 100M G-Rex (Wilson Wolf; MN, USA; RU81100).\n\nBase editing\n\nRNAs were delivered to stimulated PBMCs or CD4+/CD8+sorted T cells using either the 4D or large volume (LV) Nucleofector and corresponding kits (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland; P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L; V4XP-3024, LV Kit L; V4LP-3002) and pulse code EH-115 on day 2 of the process. Cells were harvested from the culture vessel, pelleted by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min at ambient temperature, and resuspended in 1 volume of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich; D8537-500ML). This washing procedure was repeated one more time, re-suspending the cells in 0.5 volume of PBS, before pelleting the cells and re-suspending in P3 electroporation buffer at a density of 5 × 107 cells/mL. T cells were electroporated with a fixed amount of sgRNA (Genscript) (30 pmol/1 × 106 cells) and varying amounts of linear or circular RNA encoding the base editor enzyme. Base editor RNA was added from a concentrated stock (1 mg/mL) to the P3 electroporation buffer to achieve the desired concentration (ranging from 0.25–4.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells).\n\nImmediately after electroporation, T cells were diluted 1:5 with cytokine-free medium and were placed in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 and cells were left to recover for 10–15 min. Transfected T cells were then transferred to the appropriate culture vessels at a concentration of 1 to 2 × 106 cells/mL. For small-scale experiments, base-edited T cells were cultured in 24-well plates and were placed in a humidified 37°C incubator for 4 days; at which point, half of the T cell culture was restimulated with TransAct to up-regulate the expression of the T cell inhibitory receptors, to allow the identification of gene knockouts by flow cytometry. For large-scale experiments, base-edited T cells were cultured in a six-well G-Rex (Wilson Wolf; 80240M) and were placed in a humidified 37°C incubator and left to recover overnight, before transduction to introduce the CAR genes.\n\nLentiviral transduction of anti-CD19 CAR T cells\n\nSorted T cells were transduced with lentiviral supernatant encoding an anti-CD19 CAR49,50,51,52 on day 3 of the process (24 h post-nucleofection) using a multiplicity of infection of 5. T cells were seeded at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL with lentiviral supernatant in RetroNectin-coated (Takara, London, UK; T100A) 100-mL differentiation bags (Miltenyi Biotec; 170-076-400) and were placed in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Expression of the transgene was assessed on day 7 of the process by flow cytometry using an anti-idiotype antibody to detect the anti-CD19 scFv (Autolus; produced in-house).\n\nFlow cytometry and antibodies\n\nFlow cytometry was performed using the MACSQuant10 or X instruments (Miltenyi Biotec). Unless otherwise stated, antibodies were prepared at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich; D8537-500ML) and all staining was performed at ambient temperature for 10 min, protected from light. Samples were resuspended in 50–100 μL PBS or viability stain and 80% of the volume was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell viability dyes used were Zombie-NIR (BioLegend; London, UK; 423106) or SYTOX AAdvanced (ThermoFisher Scientific; {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"S10274\",\"term_id\":\"84309\",\"term_text\":\"pir||S10274\"}}S10274). Isotype and/or non-transduced samples were included as negative controls for flow cytometry gating.\n\nAntibodies were sourced from BioLegend, unless otherwise stated. Antibodies used in small-scale experiments were: CD3-PE-Cy7 (344816), CD279 (PD-1)-PE (329906), CD366 (TIM3)-BV421 (345008), IgG1 isotype control PE (400112), and IgG1 isotype control BV421 (400158). For large-scale experiments, the antibodies were sourced from Miltenyi Biotec, unless otherwise indicated, and consisted of: CD3-VioGreen (130-113-142), CD8-VioBlue (130-110-683), CD279 (PD-1)-PE (130-120-382), CD366 (TIM3)-PE-Vio770 (130-121-334), CD223 (LAG3)-VioBright515 (130-120-012), CCR7-PE (130-119-583), CD45RA-APC-Vio770 (130-117-747), REA control PE (130-113-438), REA control VioBright515 (130-113-445), REA control PE-Vio770 (130-113-440), and REA control APC-Vio770 (130-113-435). Expression of the CAR was detected using an anti-CAT-19 scFv Rat Fc idiotype antibody (Autolus; produced in-house) and an APC-conjugated anti-Rat Fc secondary antibody (BioLegend; 405407).\n\nFlow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo Software, version 10.8.1. The gating strategy first involved the identification of the cell population based on size and granularity (FSC-A versus SSC-A), before isolating the singlets (FSC-A versus FSC-H) and live cells (negative for viability dye). T cells were identified as CD3+ prior to subsequent gating on the markers of interest.\n\nGenotyping\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from 1 × 106 T cells on day 9 of the process using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen; K182002). An 800-base pair region spanning the target site was amplified by nested PCR, and the amplicon was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen; 28106) and sent for Sanger sequencing (Source BioScience). Sanger sequencing traces were uploaded to EditR (http://baseeditr.com/),48 and the frequency of base conversion was determined for each base within the protospacer sequence.\n\nRNA isolation\n\nRNA was isolated from 1 × 106 T cells using the Quick-DNA/RNA Microprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research; distributed from Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK; D7005T), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was digested in the RNA column using 5 U of DNase I (Zymo Research; D7005T) for 15 min at ambient temperature. RNA was eluted in 15 mL of elution buffer and concentrations determined on the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) using the Qubit RNA BR assay kit (Invitrogen; {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q10211\",\"term_id\":\"1723279\",\"term_text\":\"Q10211\"}}Q10211).\n\nRT-qPCR\n\nPrimers and probes for qPCR and RT-qPCR were designed using PrimerQuest (IDT) and custom synthesized (IDT). The sequences of the primers and probe were: BE4max forward, 5′-CCCAAGAGGAACAGCGATAAG-3′; BE4max reverse, 5′-CCACCACCAGCACAGAATAG-3′; BE4max probe, 5′-/56-FAM/ATCGCCAGA/ZEN/AAGAAGGACTGGGAC/3IABkFQ/-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-ACATCGCTCAGACACCATG-3′; GAPDH reverse 5′- TGTAGTTGAGGTCAATGAAGGG-3′; and GAPDH probe 5′-/5HEX/AAGGTCGGA/ZEN/GTCAACGGATTTGGTC/3IABkFQ/-3′. DNA and RNA were extracted from T cells using Quick-DNA/RNA Microprep Plus kit (Zymo Research; D7005T) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified RNA was quantified using Qubit RNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit (Invitrogen; {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q10211\",\"term_id\":\"1723279\",\"term_text\":\"Q10211\"}}Q10211), and samples diluted to 25 ng/mL with TE buffer (Synthego) in preparation for RT-qPCR analysis. Each 20-μL reaction contained 300 nM forward and reverse primer, 250 nM probe, and 1x PrimeTime One-step RT-qPCR Master Mix (IDT; 10007066). A master mix was prepared in a dedicated class II biosafety cabinet and distributed into the wells of a hard-shell, thin-walled 96-well PCR plate (Bio-Rad; Watford, UK; HSP9665). Sample templates and standards were added to the 96-well PCR plate, prior to sealing with Microseal B adhesive sealer (Bio-Rad; MSB-1001) and cycling on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System qPCR machine (Bio-Rad) running on CFX Maestro 1.1 (version 4.1.2433.1219) software (Bio-Rad). Transcript copy number was determined using CFX Maestro 1.1 software, and where appropriate, normalization to GAPDH copy number was carried out to account for variation in the amount of RNA template used.\n\nWestern blotting\n\nCell pellets (1 × 106 T cells) were obtained at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-nucleofection with BE4max-encoding linear or circular RNA (4.00 μg RNA/1 × 106 cells) and a non-targeting sgRNA. Samples were lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer (Millipore; 20–188) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (Millipore; 539134), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Where appropriate, the amount of protein was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo-Scientific; 23227) and 15 μg of protein was denatured in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen; NP0007) supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad; 1610710) at a final concentration of 2.5%, by boiling the samples at 95°C for 5 min. Samples were run on a 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN Precast TGX Protein Gel (Bio-Rad; 4561024) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proteins were transferred to a Trans-Blot Turbo Midi 0.2 μm Nitrocellulose Transfer Pack (Bio-Rad; 1704159), using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad) and a pre-defined protocol for high molecular weight proteins (transfer time; 10 min). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS, 0.1% TWEEN 20 (Sigma-Aldrich; P2287-500ML) for 1 h at ambient temperature, prior to blotting overnight at 4°C with either a mouse anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; A5316; at a 1:10,000 dilution) or a mouse anti-Cas9 antibody mix (anti-Cas9 [clone 7A9-3A8]; Cell Signaling Technologies, MA, USA; 14697S and anti-CRISPR [Cas9] (clone 7A9); BioLegend; 844301, with or without the addition of anti-CRISPR [Cas9] (clone 6G12-H11); BioLegend; 698302, all antibodies were prepared at a 1:1,000 dilution). Following washing in PBS 0.1% TWEEN 20, the membrane was blotted with a secondary HRP-linked goat anti-mouse antibody (BioLegend; 405306) at a 1:5,000 dilution for 1 h at ambient temperature. All antibody mixes were prepared in 2.5% milk PBS 0.1% TWEEN 20. Protein was visualized using the Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific; 32106).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nTwo-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the comparison of multiple datasets.
