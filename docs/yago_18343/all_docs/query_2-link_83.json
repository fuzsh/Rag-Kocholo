        "text": "A trek through the streets and homes of the people who lived in a small town called “Bambalapitiya”, in the city of Colombo (00400), in old Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in the 60s\n\nBeginnings\n\nBambalapitiya, affectionately known to all its residents and even those living within the other bordering zones of Colombo as, “Bamba”, is a small town located on both sides of the Galle Road between Colpetty (Colombo 00300) on the North and Wellawatte (Colombo 00600) on the South. It spans about one and a half kilometers in length, north-south. The West is ringed by the big beautiful waters of the Indian Ocean, while the East borders Havelock Town on the North and Kirulaponne on the South, connected to each other by Havelock Road. “Bamba” is also classified as Colombo 00400 on the zonal map of Colombo, today, and lies within the Municipality of Colombo.\n\nBambalapitya in the early 19th century was a thick jungle infested with venomous snakes. “CadjuPulang” (cashew apple) trees (Anacardium occidentale) were common to this area and it was the belief that outlaws hiding in this dense jungle would hijack and plunder bullock carts carrying produce between Galle, in the south, and Colombo. It is narrated that these bandits would murder these traders and hang their bodies on the “Cadju Pulang” trees. The song sung at the big school cricket match, “we will hang all the Thomians on the Cadju Pulang trees …“ is said to have been derived from this ancient legend.\n\nVast tracts of Bambalapitiya, on the south side, were owned by the Senanayake family, relicts of our first PM, The Hon Mr DS Senanayake.\n\nThe descendants of this family, Haig, Brian and Shelah live in their ancestral home down Mary’s Road. Shelah passed away in 2019\n\nHerbert Bartholomeusz JP and retired Engineer PWD bought 10 acres of land in Bamba for Rs 6.00 per acre in 1896. Today land in the town is worth Tens of Million Rupees per perch (one acre = 160 perches).\n\nGalle Road (The A2)\n\nGalle Road, classified as the A2 highway, begins at Galle Face, somewhere at the roundabout, in front of the old Parliament building at the southern entrance to The Fort of Colombo, and stretches its tired asphalt tracks all the way to the town of Galle, a 100 Km down south, hugging the coastline like a leech all the way through. It used to take two lanes of traffic, one up and one down, driving everyone standing in the center to cross, into sheer madness and jitters until the person gets safely across to the other pavement.\n\nSince of late, the section within the District of Colombo has been divided in the middle by an island, thereby, preventing many crazy road hogs from displaying their antics in the center. Further, the section from the Savoy Cinema, at the Dhammarama Road intersection, is one way up north, all the way to Galle Face. To compensate this, the parallel street, Duplication Road (now renamed to RA De Mel Mawatha), west of Galle Road, is also one way now, from the Liberty Cinema intersection at Dharmapala Mawatha, to Dhammarama Road. While this may have created some inconvenience to the residents between these two points it has certainly helped to move the vehicular traffic smoothly in both directions.\n\nAt Bamba, similar to many of the other towns along Galle Road in Colombo, parallel streets, commonly referred to as lanes interspaced by a few blocks of land and residential houses, ran perpendicularly down to the beach. Here, they meet the southern railway tracks, and, beyond it a myriad spread of coconut trees and wild bushes that ring the white sands of the beautiful beach that curves all the way south, like a mermaids bottom. On the sea front, right at the end of Station Road located at the northern end of “Bamba”, is the Bambalapitiya Railway Station, constructed in identical fashion to the several other stations that ring the southern tracks from Colombo Fort all the way to Matara. Two sets of tracks, parallel to each other take the perspiring office rail commuters to the big bustling bazaar cities of Maradana, The Fort, The Pettah, and, back home to roost on a daily basis.\n\nThe southern coastline railway is a way of life for many office workers and commuters. On the land side, similar parallel lanes take off from the Galle Road, some running all the way, cutting across Duplication Road, to end up at Havelock Road (now renamed to Sri SumBuddha Jayanthi Mawatha), while others ending up in dead ends or curving across to meet the network of inland roadways at some point along the way. From a bird’s eye view, the roads would have looked more like the upper skeleton of a human body with the spine representing Galle Road and the ribs reflecting the parallel lanes on either side. Galle road is the main link between Colombo and the South and is always heavily loaded with trucks, petrol tanks, cars, buses, motor bikes, scooters, bicycles, carts, three-wheeler taxis (tuktuks), and, in the old days the manually pulled rickshaws.\n\nOn some festive and religious occasions one can also see elephants and white cows joining in a festive parade or traditional arts, decked in all their finery, being dragged from temple to temple, celebrating some ritualistic event.\n\nRush hour on Galle Road, mainly during the mornings and evenings, and also during the afternoons, when the many schools located on it close for the day, can be traumatic. Traffic slows down to a crawl and horns and abuse blow out in chorus intermingling with engine noises and fumes that turns the towns into melting pots of absolute pollution. Tuktuk cabs work their way in between the snarling vehicles causing enough mayhem to an already chaotic tangled web of men, machines, and noise. Traffic policemen and policewomen, nattily dressed in their khaki uniforms, wave their arms and legs in a frenzy to try and bring some order and sanity to such a mess of a normal working day.\n\nIn recent times even the calm and quiet atmosphere of the by lanes have become a hive of activity with many commercial outlets sprouting up in what used to be the heavenly old homes of yore. Traffic screams up and down in order to access the Marine Drive that runs along the beachfront. Tourist Guest Houses, posh Restaurants, high-rise condominium apartment blocks, Telephone communication Services & Internet Cafés have all emerged out of a sleepy old town of middle class men and women sixty years ago.\n\nThe sprawling foliage of old is slowly disappearing with the clearing, blocking, and decentralization of the huge old mansions that once stood, in the name of development. Overcrowding, and the demand for more housing and business premises in a fast developing city is bursting its seams.\n\n“Bamba”, the Town\n\nThe town of Bambalapitiya begins, in the North, a little before the intersection of Bullers Road (now renamed to Bauddhaloka Mawatha) and Galle Road. Here, stood the massive FOAMTREADS advertising hoarding (later converted to ELASTO) with its shiny flickering pieces of aluminum clicking away in the sunshine and the lights of the night in its own swishy washy way, a landmark that was unmistakable to all and sundry in the sixties.\n\nAnne Salvador-Dunlop wrote in 2007\n\nToday, a massive five star hotel is being built on this site, facing the Galle Road.\n\nOn the seaside, facing Galle Road and opposite to Bullers Road, stood the respected IC Drug Stores patronized by the residents of “Bamba”, and other nearby towns, from time immemorial, serving its customers in all its glory and splendor. This was no ordinary down-the-street pharmacy as it had its aura of professionalism, respect, and honor by way of its design and interior and also its white coated salespersons, who looked more like the members of a hospital staff rather than a corner store pharmacy.\n\nThe town extends, all the way, along Galle Road, to end at the Wellawatte Canal which borders the next town of Wellawatte (Colombo 00600), on the South. To the East it is bordered by Havelock Road, which begins at the roundabout located at “Thunmulla”, (three cornered junction) on Bullers Road, and extends down, southwards, to what used to be the Wellawatte Spinning & Weaving Mills located at the bridge that crosses the same Canal which winds its way across a large extent of the city of Colombo. The Textile Mill, once a bustling industry, managed by Solih Captain, employed thousands of workers, is now closed and dysfunctional. A massive housing complex project, “Havelock City” with Chinese development company participation has sprung up, offering executive class residency to the rich and famous, at prices that would boggle one’s mind.\n\nBAMBALAWATTA\n\nRANDOM MUSINGS OF A SENILE MIND\n\nby the late Rodney Vandergert (a third party perspective written in 2006)\n\n“Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven” [Wordsworth: Preludes]\n\nIn the Nineteen Forties and early Fifties, Bambalawatte was the center of the universe. It was where all the meaningful action took place and where the principal actors were mainly Burghers and a group of expatriates drawn from half a dozen nationalities.\n\nThis was brought most forcibly to my mind after reading the recent obituaries which appeared in the local press – one to Zoe Jayatilleke by Tita Nathanielsz; the other to David Gladwin Loos , C.C.S.. by Bradman Weerakoon.\n\nThe two articles made reference to a host of distantly remembered persons who figured prominently in those halcyon days, persons who were just names to me but spoken of quite frequently by, or were known to, my younger aunts like Beryl and Aileen and older cousins such as Allanson, Rene, Noel and Inez.\n\nBradman Weerakoon in his appreciation of David Loos brought to mind a dozen or so distinguished young Burgher Civil Servants of that time. While David stood out as the “Adonis” in that constellation there were others equally note-worthy such as Neville Jansz, Anton Mc Heyzer, Donald Speldewinde, Raine Wright and someone whose Christian names alone made an indelible impression on my generation of Government Service colleagues as we perused the old “Civil List” – Dirk Philippus Rutgert Paulusz.\n\nIn various ways they distinguished themselves during their period in the C.C.S., despite the fact that many left prematurely either to take up more lucrative appointments in the private sector or to seek their fortunes abroad. I am informed that even in today’s war-affected Vavuniya, a portrait of Donald Speldewinde continues to hold pride of place in the Kachcheri, while the MacHeyzer Stadium is still the main venue for sports in Trincomalee.\n\nThe persons referred to in the Zoe Jayatilleke obituary included Harry Nightingale, the swimming coach; Greg Roskowski; Rolf Sando Mirsky; Marjorie Sample; Dr. Justin “Dadda” Flamer-Caldera and his brood; Harry and Olga Koch; Stanley and Christobel Livera; ‘Budgie’ Metzeling; the Driebergs and the Felsinger sisters Jean and Miriam. Though not referred to, other names conjured up by association were Yvonne Gulam-Hussain (nee Toussaint); Dr Larry Foenander, Rodney Jonklaas and Trevor Oliver (Tod) Dias.\n\nAssociated with the above and what gave Colombo at that time a very cosmopolitan character was Yvonne Bradley, a dance instructress from England; Madame Maryse Fumet, a French cookery expert; Thelma Kai who taught Hawaiian dancing and the Hawaiian guitar; Rupert Wagn, a Dane who taught the piano; Frank Harrison, a ballroom dancing teacher from Australia and Gerd Von Dinklage, a German who was Sri Lanka’s pioneer spear-fisherman..\n\nTo these must be added Ms. Marjorie Sample and Mrs. Spencer Shepherd and the two earlier mentioned Poles, Greg Roskowski and Rolf Sando-Mirsky, the latter name also bringing to mind his preferred mode of transport- the Triumph Speed Twin on which he met his untimely death..\n\nThe scenes of much of the activities of the above named were the Otters Swimming Club; the BRC, Colts Cricket Club, and the Havelock Rugger Club. Strangely the DBU did not feature in their revels, being much too straight-laced for the likes of the above.\n\nA major influence in fashioning this sub-culture was the newly created Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon, headed by Clifford Dodd and assisted by Livy Wijemanne, Bob Harvey and Norton Pereira. The last of that line of Mohicans, Jimmy Barucha passed away earlier this year, creating a great void in the lives of many people of my vintage. What great pleasure Jimmy gave my aunt Daisy and me in Mutuwal every Saturday night with his radio program “Melodies that Linger”: and his characteristic introduction to each singer – “Now approaching mike- side is………”. But this little microcosm of life could not withstand the political changes that rapidly swept Ceylon from the mid-1950s. Most of the people referred to emigrated to Australia, U.K. or Canada while some of the expatriates returned to their countries of origin.\n\nThe process for me was completed when we no longer saw “Pinkie” Gerreyn and Johnny Ayscough trawling the streets of Bambalawatte, the former on his Harley-Davidson, the latter in his Standard 8 Tourer.\n\nLike many an ageing Burgher1, I bemoan the passing of that happy, innocent era when men wore lounge suits or, at least, long-sleeved shirts and cravats to the 6 o’clock film show at the Majestic and the Savoy and their ladies wore hats and gloves to evensong at the DRC Church, Arethusa Lane, Wellawatte.\n\nBut “tempus fugit“ and all of us have to accept the necessary changes which time must inevitably bring . As Shakespeare wrote –\n\n“Golden lads and girls all must,\n\nAs chimney sweepers, come to dust.”\n\nRodney Vandergert\n\n[reproduced with the kind permission of his wife, Cheryl Vandergert, in Ratmalana, Sri Lanka]\n\nDown The Streets of Bamba\n\nBarefoot\n\nThis establishment was originally, Ahmed Salie & Brothers, started by that erstwhile gem merchant from the south, Ahamed Salie, where he carried on his lucrative gem business catering to both tourists and locals up to the early seventies.\n\nThe store has since changed ownership and has been transformed into a general tourist shop offering a variety of Sri Lankan produce and also a wonderful collection of valuable books and publications by Barbara Sansoni, who is an artist, writer and designer who has exhibited her drawings and woven panels across Asia, Europe and North America. She founded Barefoot in the mid Seventies and has been the designer of rural fabrics and hand woven products of Sri Lanka. Her work is characterized by its colors and simple rectilinear forms. Barefoot Gallery, within the premises, now hosts a café for the literati, art, drama, and music lovers to meet and chat. A restaurant, patronized by writers and literature buffs also stands in the open space at the rear.\n\nSome may claim that Barefoot resides in Kollupitiya since it stands on the border between the two towns. However, it is included here for all what its worth as an intrinsic part of the Bamba heritage.\n\nMenezes\n\nEveryone in “Bamba” will remember the quaint little Menezes music store located on the seaside on the border between Colpetty and Bamba.\n\nOne may still debate which of the two towns it really belonged to. It was located on the basement floor, where the instruments were displayed for sale, visible to the Galle Road, and the rear section of the basement was used for the maintenance and tinkering of musical instruments, which was carried out by the famous musical Menezes family in Colombo.\n\nThe family is said to have originated from Goa in India and claim Portuguese descent from the old colonial era. The shop was first famous for its 78 rpm gramophone records, later 45 rpm’s, and then even later EP’s and LP’s of the latest music in the industry. They also specialized in the import and distribution of acoustic pianos, guitars, wind and percussion instruments and music theory notes. In addition they also taught music.\n\nThe family members, comprising, old man “Papa” Menezes, and sons, Mickey, Tom and Ralph, and daughter, Helen, were all very talented musicians, each specializing in many instruments. Helen is a famous pianist and crooner.\n\nThey also formed a band called “The Papa Menezes Combo” and played jazz, blues and oldies at parties, dances, weddings, concerts and other musical galas in town. With the passing away of Papa and Tom the rest migrated abroad to Australia and the business was closed, much to the sadness of many faithful patrons and musicians who used to visit the shop like a prayer almost every single day.\n\nThe family of Mickey Menezes still lives down Temple Lane in Bambalapitiya. Ralph Menezes, is the only son of Papa Menezes who sought academic excellence and qualified himself professionally at Medical school in Colombo, and passed out as a doctor.\n\nThe rest of the family, were all professional musicians right to the end. Dr. Ralph now lives in Chicago, USA.\n\nThe Sunday Observer of Dec 11 2005 wrote that Helen Menezes and hubby, Ron Lucas, are in Colombo for the festive season to play and entertain all their fans at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.\n\nquote\n\nMusically elegant\n\nBack in the land of her roots and overjoyed to perform here is pianist keyboardist, Helen Lucas who with her husband Ron vocalist / percussionist will be featured at the Mount Lavinia Hotel for the entire festive season.\n\nThey will commence their gigs on Tuesday December 20 and will be a star attraction for New Year's Eve as well.\n\nHelen Lucas a famous band leader in Sri Lanka in the early years headlined her highly successful dance band the Helen Lucas Combo and held center- stage for many years before she and Ron decided to move over to Australia.\n\nAs the daughter of the famous Papa Menezes whose name was synonymous with music in Sri Lanka, she was and still is deeply involved in teaching music and a constant friend to other musicians-young and old. What her major plus in her music artistry is her elegance and sophistication in expression be it Pop, Latin or Jazz and that is hard to beat. Ron an exciting vocalist and percussionist sings a wide repertoire of Michael Buble the current rage, Frank Sinatra's songs as well as songs by the time honored greats like Elvis Presley and Nat King Cole.\n\nNow performing at some of the leading hotels in Sydney, Ron and Helen's music has taken them overseas for performances in Germany, England, Malaysia, Goa and recently a successful tour of Los Angeles, Chicago and Vancouver.\n\nCatch their gig at Mount Lavinia Hotel, you are bound to make returns. - (MP)\n\nSunday Observer of Dec 11 2005\n\nunquote\n\nTom wrote in 2009…\n\nDear Fazli,\n\nI endorse all the encomiums heaped on you on your efforts. As an undergraduate of the University of Ceylon I lived in Kollupitiya down Schofield Place. Once a month or so I used to walk from that road to Savoy in Wellawatte for a show and return by CTB or vice versa.\n\nI knew most of the roads you mention. I avoided the rail tracks after the \"PULLE GIRLS\" were killed by a LGR train near Bamba station.\n\nNear Menezes Music Stores there was a Tony’s Record Shop and the sales girl was one Arlene Vice (?) or Arlene Wise! To my eyes she had the best pair of legs!!I have been to this shop many times just to glance them, but on the pretext of buying a record!!.\n\nYou also should write about the Dutch Burgher Union and about Prof. EOE Pereira, a gentleman to his fingertips.\n\nThere was an eating place called “Terang Bulang” at the top of Bagatelle/Galle Road on the sea side. Good joint for Malay Food.\n\nI also frequented Mayfair Hotel as well as Lion House, Saraswathy Lodgel & smaller ones in front of Majestic Theatre. In those days (as a bachelor), Sundays were the best. The morning starts off with Radio Ceylon's Top of the Morning music then BBC news for 15 minutes and then I turn the radio off. I read the Sunday Observer. Fly by night by Tarzie Vitachie, the Cartoons by Collette on the Animals of the Island and Sooty Banda's stories. (of course there were spurious articles too one caption I recall is \"The Best Injuns are the Dead Injuns) While all what were VISIBLE was good SATAN was at work behind the scenes. He worked on all but with some he overworked them by means only he knew!!\n\nCEYLON was an unalloyed PARADISE. But soon Lucifer got down to work. And GOD ALLOWED - LUCIFER to WORK because GOD was neglected\n\nAnyway there is a ray of hope. One branch of Lucifer has been amputated!! But keep the good work. Also remember that what cannot be recorded is still in our SOULS\n\nTom\n\nGift Boutique\n\nGift Boutique, a glamorous gift shop was located right next to Menezes and run by that erstwhile and lovely young Malay lady, Shinir Amit, from Barnes Place in Colombo 7, who married Emran. Shineer, sadly, passed away early in life. The shop catered to both middle and upper class hoi polloi who flocked in to buy their trinkets and gifts for all occasions. Shineer kept the business running in a spirit of greatness and success during her tenure at the shop. Gift Boutique was previously called Alice in Wonderland.\n\nKala Niketan\n\nAnother wonderful gift store, adjacent to Gift Boutique, that has now ceased to exist stood on the Galle Road and served its many customers in all its splendor and glamor. The place catered, mainly for women, offering gifts, cosmetics, perfumes and many other necessities for the feminine pallet.\n\nLindsay Girls’ School\n\nLindsay Girls School is the next of the many buildings that blot the seaside of the town. A tall and stone bell tower stands in front of the school facing Galle Road threatening to ring out the ears of anyone who passes by. Many a young lady who grew up in Bamba attended this school, which was managed by the members of the Dutch Reformed Church which also stood within the school premises. Most families descendent from Dutch Burgher ancestry sent their daughters here to learn of books and a resplendent life.\n\nPaul wrote from Australia in 2006 to say,\n\nMy wife went to Lindsay Girls School from 1959-1967....Her name is Barbara Bowles...Are there any past pupils that knew her...She also worked for Unical (Ceylon) Ltd from Sep 1969 to April 1971 before departing to Sydney Australia...\n\nAdamaly Place\n\nAdamaly Place is the first lane, adjoining the IC Drug Store, and runs down, westwards, towards the beach. The name is reflective of its inhabitants who belong, mainly to the Bohra2 community, a small clan of people from Gujarat and Punjab in India who had migrated to Ceylon in the early days and were involved in trade, industry, and business, in a very successful manner.

I am one of the Gonsalkorales who lived at No 36, just opposite Jeewa and next to the Minister Jayaweera Kuruppu. Our house was rented from Mt Panditha Gunawardena at a very reasonable rate as he was fond of my father Edwin and wanted to help him educate his sons who all went to Royal College and the only daughter who went to Visakha. The house as we knew it is no longer there but I recall visiting it some years ago and it struck me how small it was.

Sivendran (a Peterite), retired senior superintendent of Police.\n\nquote\n\n”Former Deputy Inspector General of Police P Mahendran passed away on February 2 in Sydney after a brief illness. He was a giant of a man with a massive physique who excelled in athletics, boxing and rugby football. He had the unique distinction of participating in the National Athletics Championship and winning the Putt Shot championship in the afternoon and in the same evening he represented the champion CR&FC team in a rugby Clifford Cup match and went on to win the National Heavy Weight boxing championship later in the evening, all in one day. Thus he earned the title “Brute”.\n\nThough in appearance he appeared to be huge, he was very soft hearted and an amiable person. He joined the Police as an Assistant Superintendent of Police in 1958 after obtaining a Degree with Honours in Chemistry, having had his primary education at Trinity College and Royal College excelling in studies and sports.\n\nThe same year I too joined the Police as Sub Inspector, and during our Police training days at the Katukurunda Training School we became good friends and traveled to Colombo every week to represent the Police at rugby in the car of the Superintendent of Police Fred Brohier who was the Assistant Director of Training and Coach of the Police rugby team. We played together for the Police rugby team from 1958 to 1963 in the illustrious company of Mike Schockman, Quintus Jayasinghe, SS Bambaradeniya, Franklyn Jacob, Rodney Aluvihare, Tony Mahath all from Trinity College, James Senarathna, Sumith Silva, and Raja Pothuhera from Royal College and from St Peter’s College, Letcho Ephraums, Terry Williams and Muni Gomes.\n\nBrute captained the Police rugby team in 1962 and I captained the team in 1963 after which he hung up his rugby boots, even though he continued to contribute to rugby as a Referee and coach of the Police team. He also played cricket in the Police Inter Division Tournament. He always sorted a sense of honor on and off the field with his wit and wisdom. In 1961 the Police were permitted to play against the leading Clubs and in the match against the star studded CH&FC which then comprised of all foreigners in the likes of Peter Sawdy, John Banks, John Burrows, Mike James, mike Birch, Keith Andersen and Neville Leafe to name a few who were huge and some who had played international games. The police team played ferociously and drew the match 3-3 to shock the local rugby world. In this match “Brute\" played a brilliant game tackling the burly British for them to shout “ET TU BRUTE” for which Mahendran will shout “LONG LIVE CAESAR” to the amusement of the spectators and continued with\n\nBefore joining the Police he was a regular member of the champion CR& FC rugby team from 1955 to 1958 which had some of the brilliant local rugby players such as sprint champion Summa Navaratnam, Tevor Anghie, Ana Gunawardena, Mahes Rodrigo, Ago Pavia, A K Doray, Brian Vantwest, N Numan, Ashey Cader, Geoff Weinman, R Edwards, SS Babaradeniya, John Weinman, Kavan Rambukwella Malcolm Wright, Rajah Williams, R C Pathmanathan, Norman Gunawardena and “Puggy” Gunaratna.\n\nBrute was saddened by the turmoil that was taking place in the country during the eighties and found it too much to bear and decided to call of his Police career prematurely and migrated to Australia with his wife Dr Lalitha, daughters Vishantha and Rathy and son Neelan. There too he was gainfully employed in the Motor Traffic Department till recently. I visited him in Sydney recently with my wife and found him in a happy mood as usual even though his health was not as vibrant as before. He leaves behind his loving wife and three adoring children. His funeral took place in Sydney on the 4th of February, 2012. “MAY HE ATTAIN MOKSHAM” unquote\n\nTheva, of Royal College fame, also lived down the street with his folks. Theva married Olwyn and moved to Australia sometime in the eighties. Olwyn was formerly married to Sriyan de Silva, ex-production manager at Usha and Singer factories at Ratmalana.\n\nAn appreciation for Gabo Pieris appeared in The Sunday Leader of Feb 26, 2012 as follows:-\n\nquote\n\nGabo Makes his farewell \"Breakaway\"\n\nIt was in the late sixties and seventies that Gabo dominated the music scene in Sri Lanka. The then stages were always packed with stellar performers, Jet liners, Sam, Spitfires, Los Caballeros, Moonstones, CT and Harold Seneviratne; but is Gabo who led them\n\nAll by the charisma he carried as the leader of ‘The Breakaways’ playing fascinating music that took entertainment to its zenith and beyond.\n\nAnyone young strumming a guitar or scratching the keyboards or blowing horns and drumming or having voices searching for recognition wanted to be with Gabo. That is a statement I make without any hesitation as it was simply the accepted truth when Gabo ruled the band music. No, it wasn’t the Breakaways, it was Gabo, finding talent and doing the arrangements and creating his own brand of music in his childhood home down School Lane in Bambalapitiya. He and his ‘chuda manike’ resonated to be remembered for life. The man had the magic and the looks to match and the personality was spell-binding.\n\nThat is to say a lot about somebody and my sentiment is sincere.\n\nThose who clapped hands and shouted ‘encore’ and jingled and jived on Gabo music would know what I am talking about. The memories may have faded, but recollections would be instant, not just simple remembrances, but with a glint in the eye. That was Gabo the Band Leader at his mercurial best.\n\nThen came the airline part; that’s when I met him and his lovable wife Savi and forged a friendship that lasted a lifetime. They were young years and our days sure were wild and winsome resulting in many a little fairytale in memory circuits. Such is always recalled when the bell tolls and someone has to go, like now.\n\nFrom flying, Gabo went to the travel trade. He did have a Midas touch, not by luck, but by constructive imagination and a personality that made him the ‘total people’s man.’ He took ‘Gabo Travels’ way beyond anyone’s imagination. Gabo had the ‘Band Leader’ name, and the vision and the drive to lift his infant travel company to its present success, right up to the top shelf.\n\nOf course the guardian angel was always there, Savi, the one who stood by him for all flavours and all seasons and gave the anchor to the man and trimmed the sails when the winds howled and the seas got rough.\n\nGabo’s beginnings were humble, his father was a respected teacher, his mother a housewife and a loving sister completed the family, the norms of the multitude. He would have ridden his bicycle and eaten his celebrations at Sarasvathi and watched movies in the first front rows of the Majestic Theatre. Somewhere in that ‘run of the mill’ life Gabo picked a pair of drum sticks and that changed it all. His was certainly a self-made story, an architect of his own fate who took the blows as ‘Old Blue Eyes’ sang and made his life a script of strictly ‘my way’.\n\nNo one can go from where he began to where he ended without having a fall or two, we all do that. Gabo conquered himself and along with Savi raised three lovely children, Sasha, Natasha and Dania, who in turn added their own offspring to the ‘Gabo Band Wagon.’\n\nWe always kept in touch, sometime back met and shared a meal and had a great time speaking of bygones and laughed loud like fools, in the warmth and happiness of ancient camaraderie. That was great. Then came the health problems, sad and unfortunate and demanding in every way. Savi’s strength held and she combined multi-roles and kept the ship afloat. The last I saw Gabo was a few months ago. The warmth was all there, the voice was soft and the words were chosen and scrimp, mostly a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ from a face dressed with a ghost of a smile. It seemed that he was having a silent last laugh to ‘what it was all about’ in his carnival of a life. I was in many ways happy for him.\n\nGabo had found peace. That much I was certain.\n\nI said ‘so long’ and took my leave. Sadly his final words are haunting me now.\n\n“Come and see me,” that’s what he said, waving a feeble hand that had once ruled music with a drum stick.\n\nCapt Elmo Jayawardena\n\n- The Sunday Leader - Feb 26, 2012\n\nunquote\n\nTheva of Royal lived here with his folks.

Olwyn was formerly married to Sriyan de Silva, ex Production Manager at Usha and Singer factories at Ratmalana.\n\nBullers Road (Bauddhaloka Mawatha)\n\nBullers Road, is a very broad street that runs all the way from Galle Road to meet the roundabout at Thunmulla, which spans Havelock Road on its right and Reid Avenue on its left, and goes further down straight towards Jawatte where Radio Ceylon, now the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, is located.\n\nAt the helm of the road was the Great Wall Hotel which was previously owned and occupied by the Sheriff Hadijar family, (aka Pulla Kutty Sheriff, meaning many children Sheriff as he had a total of 32 children from two marriages), who later moved to Davidson Road. Sheriff Hajiar’s Car Number Plate was – X4965 – Vintage AUSTIN 10 (Dark Green).\n\nThe Mosque, attended by Muslims of Bamba stands on this street on the left. Since of late the buildings of this place of worship have been renovated and built up into a three floored structure meeting the many demands of the increasing number of Muslims in that area.\n\nEliyas master and his sister Ms Ahadiya, who tutored children, and her mother lived close to the Mosque. The Kitchil family lived in the garden at the rear of the Mosque. Tuan Ariff Kitchil attended Royal College from 1959 to 66.\n\nThe Bamba central bus station was also located at the beginning of Bullers Road. Many a bus that hailed from the south along Galle Road used to take the Bullers Road turn to the right in order to shuttle their many passengers to various locations inland, viz; Korteboam (105), Layards Broadway (106), & Wattala (104). Since Bullers Road is now a one way street from Duplication Road to Galle Road, all these buses have to turn around Alfred House Gardens, further north of Bullers Road, and return on Duplication Road to take the left turn into Bullers Road.\n\nLater, the destinations of these bus routes were changed to, Mattakkuliya (155), Kiribathgoda (154), & Wattala (134).\n\nOther modes of transport at Bamba were, the Bullock Carts, Buggy Carts, Hackeries, and the old London Transport Red Double deck Buses run by the Southern Western Bus Company. Traffic Police on Motor Bikes, the tar barrel’s lining the road, effectively dividing the road into two traffic lanes, ugly, yet very practical.\n\nMany large residential bungalows stood tall on Bullers Road in the old days. They have now been converted into office complexes, fetching very attractive rents, and the whole environment surrounding the street has changed from a very cozy, quiet and calm VIP residential location to a bustling business bazaar.\n\n“Kos” Dias a Botany teacher at Royal used to live down Bullers Road and every student who passed by in the school\n\nbus never failed to miss his home while the bus passed this way. Mr Dias used to stand in front of his gate to board the school bus in the mornings. The adjoining house was occupied by Robin Soysa and family. One of Robin Soysa’s daughters, Neelika married HS de Silva who captained Royal Rugby in 1959/60. The twin two-story houses were built and occupied by Charlotte (Wife of Francis Peiris) in the 1950s.\n\n[contributions also made by Graham Koch (Aus), Vajira Gunewardena & Kusum Perera (Aus)]\n\nAnd then there was “Rupperty”, Mr Rupesinghe, who lived down Adams Avenue, who also used to stand on the sidewalk waiting for the Royal School Bus every morning.\n\nBullers Road intersects the newly constructed Duplication Road at right angles, and now house branches of many international banks and corporations.\n\nThe Standard Chartered Bank and the HongKong & Shanghai Banking Corporation have a notable presence here. Elite Restaurant, the UN Head Office, and many stately government mansions are also located on this street.\n\nThe Kariapper family, originally from the Eastern Province town of Batticaloa, lived on one of the side streets on the right of Bullers Road. Daughter, Dr. Nazli married Dr Shahnaz Ozeer, a reputed dental surgeon, and moved to Australia. Shahnaz is the son of Khaneema Saleem and MSM Ozeer, formerly of Mary’s Road, Bambalapitiya.\n\nThe Dutch Burgher Union is also located on the left, further down, opposite to the roundabout. In recent times the CBA Copy Center and Bookshop has also started a successful office adjoining the DBU.\n\nLion House & Mayfair Hotel\n\nOn the landside of Galle Road, starting from where Bullers Road begins, are a row of restaurants, shops and business enterprises, some having been in business for more than five decades. The most famous of these used to be Lion House and Mayfair Hotel, two restaurants located next to each other, where schoolboys, referred to as the “bambalawatte boys”, meaning the boys from the gardens of bamba, playing truant gathered together to light up a quick ciggy before hitting the matinee movie at the Majestic Cinema across the street.\n\nLion House, the \"Sinhala Kade\" which dished out the most savory dishes of Sinhalese tradition from the spicy and lovely \"katta sambol\" “lunumiris”, and steaming hoppers, just off the pan, not to forget the mouthwatering kavun and kokis especially during the Sinhala-Tamil New Year and festive season. The \"bithara appa\" (egg hoppers) laced with red hot chillie “katta sambol” soaked and a good cuppa, steaming hot, plain (black) tea, accompanied by a Three Roses cigarette (Four Aces for the guys who wanted it cheap) was the \"diet\" of the hundreds who patronized the \"Lion\" in all its glory and splendor.\n\nThe Lion House cuppa tea was something truly special to all young smokers. Every schoolboy in Bamba knew Lion House almost as second home.\n\nLion House was patronized by a cross-section of guys. Royalists, of the “Bamba” and Wellawatte breed, Peterites from their Bambalapitiya homeland, Thomians too, from far off south as Mt.Lavinia. The Mount boys “jumped” a South-Western bus to be at Bamba in a short span of time as traffic was sparse on the Galle Road in those times, unlike at present where a run from Mount to “Bamba” junction would take about an hour.\n\nThis was also the hide-out for the schoolboys (it did not serve much as the showcase at Lion was there for all and sundry to see) for a \"punt\"(a cigarette) as the next one will have to be in the toilet at home where chances of being detected by \"pater boy\" (dad) are sixty to one in the possibility.\n\n\"Lion\" apart from the schoolboys also had their lion share of press reporters, hangers on, Majestic theatre patrons, (a somewhat downtown branch of the YMCA of Fort patronized by such breed) and of course the \"Bambalawatte boys\". These “boys” are a clan of young chaps who live in the “Bamba” and Wellawatte area, most of them strumming a guitar and sporting an \"Elvis Presley\" hairdo with sideburns to adorn their pimply faces, and whose past time was dishing out remarks at the gals who walked by. Once the \"Lion\" patrons glue themselves to their seats around the rectangular tables it was \"finitos\" for the waiters and management. The ones who come in first wouldn’t leave in a hurry, but spend hours chatting in groups, while only totting up a bill for a few rupees to the dismay of the \"Lion\" management and the poor waiters who longed for a five cent tip to keep their home fires burning. Sadly the \"Lion\" exists today at its original site, the showcase outside the restaurant remains but the floor space has been halved and rented out and the other half is no longer an eating house.\n\nMany were the arguments, debates, brawls, and even fisticuffs that started off from within the walls of Lion House and spilled on to the Galle Road, eventually ending up at the Bamba Flats or even on the shore line of Bamba. Disputes ranged from simple stuff like territory, school flags and cheering to major stuff like “girls”, who is taboo for whom, etc.\n\nFrom the \"Lion\", just next door, stood another famous eating\n\nplace of the 50/60 era, the \"Mayfair Hotel\" a renowned place run by Indian Muslims, synonymous with Biriyani and Watalappam.\n\nThe aroma and mouth-watering taste that came out from Mayfair's delicious meals is still etched in the memories of the 'gluttonous\" of that by-gone era. The roast chicken could not be matched by any other eating \"joint\" in town except, maybe, by the original \"Pilawoos\" restaurant in the Pettah run by the Palandis of South Indian roots. Mayfair too had their fair share of Hoppers, which, soaked in mutton kurma (meat curry) with all the masala (spices) added gave a good run to their competitors next door although patrons still favored hoppers with chillie hot sambol served by the Lion.\n\nIf it’s \"Biriyani\" its Mayfair, and they did a splendid job with it and their take-away specials of chicken and mutton is something still spoken of by the old timers, a taste that has never been matched even to this day. \"Mayfair\" was also a boozer’s favorite.\n\nAlthough the place did not serve liquor many a patron came there soaked and swinging, to wind up their long and thirsty day with a good biriyani feed as their \"old ladies\" (wives) would not be awake when they would eventually get back home in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nMayfair sales used to sky rocket during the end of the month when pay-day came around as a good biriyani was sold for around Rs 3/50, a fairly expensive commodity in the days when a bus ride from Fort to Bamba cost only 15 cts. The name \"Mayfair\" exists even now at the same location with \"new\" added to it but it is a far cry from the good old \"Mayfair\" of old.\n\nIt was here, within these two premises, that many of the ideas that emanated from the youth of Bamba were discussed and plans hatched to carry out whatever mischief they had in mind, whether it was scaling the walls of St. Pauls’ Milagiriya Girls’ School or raiding the echelons of Holy family Convent.\n\nThese two restaurants along with many more that have now sprouted up along the Galle Road, extending all the way to the Bambalapitiya Market and even beyond, also served as eating joints for those driving past after midnight.\n\nSome significant characters of Lion House/Mayfair fame were, the Guneratne’s, local toughs, Douglas Roberts, Tough Kum, & Rutman. The one & only Gerd Von Dinclage of Kinross fame, and his Harley Davidson, Tissa Ariyarate “ Saigon “Hilmi Khalid, and Turab Jafferjee,. This area became known as the domain of the Bambalawatte Boys, of whom much was written by internationally renowned journalist Tarzie Vittachi and newspaper cartoonist Colette.\n\n“Once again to those days”, written by Geoff Wijesinghe – in the Daily News of Sat, Mar 2, 2002, gives a very interesting and illustrative account of some of the happenings in Bamba around Lion House in those times as follows:-quote George Siegertsz, who passed away in London last week at the age of 82, was one of the last of a generation of post-World War Two musicians.\n\nGeorge was a regular at Lion House at the Bambalapitiya Junction. He was one of the motley group of young men who visited the popular eatery, which served more as a \"cup tea punt\" (a cup of tea and a fag) club where these youth chatted for long hours of this, that and the other. Although the group comprised many toughs who walked around like pocket editions of Humphrey Bogart, George Raft and Spencer Tracy\n\nthe tough guys at the time of the silver screen, George Siergertsz was more interested in chatting and in music.\n\nHe was the country's number one whistler, a fine art and often his friends at Lion House, would gather round a table and listen to him whistling the popular tunes at the time.\n\nAbout one in two months or so, George Siegertsz had a 15-minute program over Radio Ceylon and would whistle the popular tunes of the day, haunting melodies, many of them World War Two favourites such as \"Time Goes By\", \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\", \"A Long Way to Tipperary\" and \"The White Cliffs of Dover\".\n\nMany of us younger one who kept in touch with the Lion House crowd knew well in advance when George Siergertsz, a lean, tall, gangling figure was going to whistle over Radio Ceylon.\n\nIncidentally, although some of his pals operated in grey areas, George never blew the whistle on them to the cops. He was only interested in whistling fine musical tunes. The Lion House group, I would not like to describe them as a mob, although some of them were men of violence looking out for a fight.\n\nOne morning we read the sensational news in the \"Daily News\" of two of the Lion House boys having stowed away successfully on board a ship from Colombo to Southampton. If my memory serves me right they were Hula Mortier and Kingsley Rodrigo who, according to their buddies, have gone to the UK to become coal miners. When I last heard of them many years ago they had in fact made their way to London and were domiciled there.\n\nThe years following World War Two produced musicians of\n\nfine vintage in this country. Foremost of them was Erin de Selfa who was discovered by the doyen of Sri Lankan showmen Donovan Andre, a former racing correspondent attached to the Times of Ceylon, which was published in the evenings and on Sundays.\n\nShe was recruited to sing in the group which was known as Red Tail Minstrels and grew up to be dark and dusky, and her voice was very much like the posh Shirley Bassey. Once she grew up, Erin was a regular over a Radio Ceylon. She then left for London under contract to the famous \"Talk of the Town\" nightclub in London, which was patronized by celebrities.\n\nI had the privilege of listening to Erin over the BBC one night. This was the first time that a Sri Lankan musician had been honored by BBC, at the time the premier broadcasting station in the world, a highly prestigious achievement.\n\nHer renditions of \"Blue Moon\", \"As Time Goes By\", \"I can't help Falling in Love with You\" and several other sentimental songs, were of the highest international standards.\n\nSeveral years later, another Sri Lankan Yolande Wolfe, an old girl of Holy Family Convent of Bambalapitiya and whose father owned a building at the top of Retreat Road, followed in Erin's footsteps and became popular in the US.\n\nThat was in the early 1950s, the George and Gerry Crake brother were the seniors in the local music scene and they too were regulars over Radio Ceylon. They had a band known as the Crake Brothers, Gerry had a rich, deep tenor. There was also the Millionaires' dance band that practiced in a house at Edward Lane.\n\nThey had the big band sound and their rendition of the Glen\n\nMiller favorite \"Take the A-train\", a perennial, was simply superb.\n\nThe biggest end-of-the-year dance in the late 1940s was at the Town Hall where several bands played and there was one hectic rush for tickets.\n\nSome of the Lion House \"boys\" used to get involved in a brawl at a New Year's Eve dance, which ended tragically once with the death of a young man, who fell out of an upstairs window when taking a punch.\n\nThe pint-sized Carl Cooke, the former Thomian wicket-keeper, had a ballroom dancing school opposite Lion House directly behind the petrol shed at the Bambalapitiya Junction. In this sprawling old house he also established the 20th Century Club, no doubt getting the inspiration from the name 20th Century Fox, the international film producer.\n\nOne night, some of the boys who had the habit of dropping in for drinks at the 20th Century Club, imbibed more than they should have had and inspired by Bacchus, took all the club's flower pots and placed them on Carl Cooke's billiard table. Being a mild mannered man, all Carl could say was \"what have you fellows done? You have damaged my billiard table. And I will have to replace it with new clothes.\"\n\nCarl, of course, being a peace-loving man, paid for the repairs. But the neighborhood was very angry with the Lion House crowd for having abused Carl Cooke's hospitality, for he was very popular. Carl's brother Percy who has played for S. Thomas' was my headmaster for long years\n\nunquote\n\nLauries Road\n\nIn between these shops are the lanes of Lauries Road and Majestic Avenue, and, at the end of this row the Bambalapitiya Market stands like a monument from the past, for several decades.\n\nA notable corner store that was gutted to cinders during the '83 Sinhala-Tamil riots that erupted, is the banana shop displaying its variety of fruit in all shapes and colors and sizes. Navavi, a textile shop run by a member of the Tamil community and Samarasinghe\n\nBrothers a utility store were also located along this row.\n\nOn the south side close to Samarasinghe store was the house of E B and Malini Fernando. Kumar, Dilip, Ajith and Priyan were the boys and all went to Royal. The youngest was daughter. They were a devout family of Methodists who to this day is involved with many social and welfare activities in the Sri Lankan community. E B Feranando’s ancestral family can be rightfully described as original inhabitants of Bambapitiya. Mr. Fernando did Mathematics honors at the university and later became the head of the Tax Department.\n\nPrasantha Dias Abeygunawardena (Royal College 59er) and Kulendrasingham (58er) both lived a few houses east. Next came the Mettaramaya temple.\n\nFurther east was Lauries Lane that connected to Fonseka watta. During 1930s and 1940s, No. 33 Lauries Road was the residence of Francis Edwin and Charlotte Peiris and their four children, Pearlyn, Merlyn, Princy and Shirley. The girls went to Methodist College and Shirley was at Royal.\n\nThis property was contiguous with New Buller’s Road.\n\nShirley later owned a Garage on New Buller’s Road and had transportation contracts with the Colombo Port.\n\nOn the south side was St Mary’s Church. Many an older residents had connections to this church.\n\nStill further east was the Peugeot service garage. And the south side of Lauries Road ended in a Petrol Station.\n\nOn the north side of the street was a connector to Tummula that served as an alternate for access to Galle Road heading south. [contributions also made by Graham Koch, Vajira Gunewardena, & Kusum Perera]\n\nReceived by email from Mr John Henry de Saram, ex Form Master and English teacher at Royal College Colombo in the 60s:-\n\nquote\n\nMany thanks for your warm response and the links to your blog. I am ploughing through the material in installments and find it all fascinating.\n\nIt is one of the oldest thoroughfares in the area, being the link between Galle Road & Havelock Road at a time when 'New' Bullers Road was populated by coconut trees, shrubbery & small game (hunted by my uncle) and Vajira Road was not much more than a footpath which our rickshaw man had difficulty negotiating en route to the Visakha Kindergarten.\n\nIncidentally it was my grandfather who purchased Clock House & an acre or so of land surrounding it in the early 1900s when it was 'abandoned' by the fledgling HFC.\n\nGood bye for & look forward to seeing you in December.\n\nJH de Saram.\n\nunquote\n\nMajestic Avenue\n\nThis was a narrow street that ran by the side of the Majestic Theater. It had a high wall on the theater side with a small opening for the admission no more than 5-6ft by 2-3ft It served as the entry to the Gallery for a fee of 55 cents. Many a school boys took the afternoon off (cut classes) and stood in the gallery queue for the early matinee.\n\nShanghai Chinese Restaurant (near Rippon road on the land side and opposite the Bambalapitiya Police station) renowned for its meatballs and mushrooms Shanghai style.\n\n[contributed by Graham Koch, Vajira Gunewardena, & Kusum Perera]\n\nWe lived down Majestic Avenue from about 1963 to 1970 at No 11. My father was the famous building contractor of the time ASM Ibrahim who catered to most of the Borah community of Colombo. It was fun as I went to Royal College from Majestic Avenue. Those were the days of yore!\n\nThe Fonseka gals, Shahani, Michelle, & Janaki also lived here.\n\nThe “Bamba” Municipal Market\n\nThe Market square at Bamba is, to this day, managed by the Colombo Municipal Council and provides stalls and booths for the sale of fresh vegetable, fruits, fish, poultry, and meat. Built many moons ago the building used to be in such a dilapidated state that one used to wonder when it would come tumbling down. One could even see small Bo plants growing on its roof. In recent times, however, some renovations have been carried out and a fresh coat of gray paint has given the market some semblance of sanity that didn’t exist for decades.\n\nOnce inside the market one sees an arrogant display of groceries, meats, vegetables and fruits ready for the picking. The many Bamba ladies who haunt this environ with their hefty baskets, some more affluent ones with their housemaids tagging along behind them, do use this place as a meeting venue to discuss the daily dose of town gossip and exchange tidbits before trucking back home with their goodies. In modern times the crowds are most during the evenings what with many of the modern day middle class ladies choosing to work in order to keep the home fires burning. Dogs, cats and crows outnumber the number of humanity that haunts this place, picking up the bits and pieces of meats and fish that are disposed of by the vendors.\n\nStreams of water run down along the side streets originating from the many stalls where the washing of the meats, fish, verge’s and fruits take place. The place reeks with a mixed smell of uncooked food, fishy smelling and sometimes a bit difficult to stomach to those with weak dispositions.\n\nA Municipal Inspector has his own room within the premises and is expected to ensure that all produce sold within are in conformity to local government food sales and hygiene laws. To live in Bamba and not have visited the market would be equivalent to blasphemy.\n\nPrivate Road\n\nAdjoining the market, to the south, is a private road wherein the Aziz family lived. The head of the household, MHA Aziz was an Advocate belonging to the Poothan Haji Family from Galle, who founded the Ahadiyya Movement in Sri Lanka, which was an organization that trained young Muslim children to read the Qur’an in Arabic and study Islam.\n\nHis children are Shibly (married Fathima Waffarn, daughter\n\nof the late Dr Waffarn), Presidents Counsel, Imthiaz, who spent long years in Saudi Arabia working with the Saudi Arabian Airlines, and Ifthikhar, who is involved in business in Colombo, all of whom were fervent Royalists. The daughters, Minna married Proctor Iliyas of Galle, and Ryhan, married Mazhar Ghouse, son of Matheen Ghouse (of Lever Brothers Ceylon Ltd.) who was also an ex Royalist from the same batch as her brothers.\n\nShibly is married to Fathima Waffarn, daughter of Dr ARM Waffarn, from Wellawatte, while Imthiaz married Yasmin Mahamoor the late ASP’s daughter of Pieris Road Kalubowila, and Ifthikhar married Fathima Rezani Markar, daughter of Zain & Rifka Markar.\n\nIfthikhar Aziz wrote in 2019 . . .\n\nO those unforgettable Bamba days........\n\nMy love for the laid back but interesting and eventful Bambalapitiya commenced in my infancy when my Dad, Late M. H. A. Aziz decided to bring his family down from Matara to settle down in Colombo as he found it increasingly difficult to travel to Matara during the weekends due to his lucrative and committed legal practice and his involvement in many public sector and private organizations.\n\nHe initially leased out a spacious home for us behind the Bambalapitiya Municipal market from where my brothers Shibly, Imthiaz and I attended Royal College, Colombo and my sisters Minha and Ryhan(Babsy) went to Lindsay Girls School.\n\nWe had as our immediate neighbor I. A. Cader, a Proctor and Notary Public of repute who was my Mom's younger sister Bahiya, and their kids.\n\nInterestingly, my Dad and Adham (IA. Cader) were very close friends since their childhood in Talapitiya, Galle where they were neighbors and next door neighbors in Bambalapitiya, they made a pact that they would marry in to the same family, which they did. My Dad had a very lucrative legal practice and he Founded the Ahadiyya Sunday Schools Movement. Sadly, he succumbed to a massive heart attack while playing tennis at the Moors Sports Club in Colombo at the relatively young age of 44 year. I was just 4 and my siblings were all below 11 years of age, Shibly being the eldest of them.\n\nAdham Cader went to be elected Member of Parliament for Beruwela, Deputy Speaker and Ambassador to Egypt.\n\nWe also had Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Lambert Weerasekera, Commissioner of Motor Traffic Daya Gunasekera and his wife Barbara Gunasekera (who was at that time, Principal of St. Paul's Milagiriya as our immediate neighbors. We all lived in perfect harmony and it is sad that the situation in our beloved country has changed so drastically over the years.\n\nEntertainment Maestro Donavan Andree's entertainment complex was just across the road from where we lived and we were never short of good, clean entertainment like Holiday on Ice, the famous musical Seven Sisters, the wrestling champions King Kong and Dara Singh and so many other memorable treats.\n\nFor 10 years after we attained Independence from our British colonial masters, all of us from the different communities lived in almost perfect harmony. Almost perfect I say because the Sinhala Buddhist racially biased flank on which UNP dissident SWRD Bandaranayake won the 1956 General Election made fissures into the social fabric of our nation.\n\nThe Tamil people were a disillusioned lot because Banda went back on his promised policy of equal treatment of the minorities to a heavily biased Sinhala only policy. This led to various incidents involving the Tamils who carried out hartals and civil disobedience campaigns which were largely very peaceful. However, this triggered off the first communal riots in Ceylon as our nation was then known and it resulted in several thousands of Tamil homes and businesses being razed to the ground and many hundreds being killed by violent Sinhala Buddhist extremist goons.\n\nSWRD tried his utmost to reverse this dangerous development by even going back on his declared policy of Sinhala Only, but was gunned down by a Buddhist monk, Talduwe Somarama, who was working in cahoots with the Chief Monk of the venerated Kelaniya Temple, Buddharakitha and Banda's own Minister of Health.\n\nSadly, all of these events together with other issues like the university entrance standardization policy, the need for all Public Officers to be proficient in the Sinhala language and other discriminatory policies, led to the emergence of Tamil youth movements which took to arms against the South in their determination to seek a separate state for them within Sri Lanka.\n\nThe streets that followed are Joseph Lane, Pepin Lane, Daisy Villa Avenue and De Vos Avenue. On the land side facing the old Stadium location ringed a row of business enterprises all the way up to the massive Hindu Kovil that still stands, and ends at Vajira Road, and is venerated by many of the Hindu’s from all parts of Colombo.\n\nAnonymous wrote in 2008…\n\nJoseph Lane, like other streets and by lanes in Bamba, produced its share of prominent citizens. The Fonseka’s\n\nwere, perhaps, pre-eminent of all its residents. The street was named for Joseph Fonseka and several pockets were known as \"Fonsekawatte”. Ben Fonseka was an outstanding student at the University and joined the Foreign service ending up as SL's Ambassador to several first world capitols and to the United Nations.\n\nHis brother Michael was well known for his social work and the owner of a prominent Construction Co\" DD Fonseka and Sons. Francis another brother was also in construction and was among the kindest people I knew. There were many branches of the Fonseka family dispersed throughout the Lane.\n\nThe Paiva family was also from and of Joseph Lane. Mr J N Paiva the patriach had a feel for small business and real estate and made money in both.\n\nDuring the war years he catered to the British soldiers in town with the \"Paiva\"s Corner Houses\", two small fast food stops at intersections at Bambalapitiya and Wellawatte mimicking the 'Lyons corner houses\" of London. One of his sons was Augo Paiva who captained CR&FC rugby team in the '50s.\n\nOne of the most distinct Landmarks on Joseph lane was the \"Dhoby House\" a local Laundry for the area and beyond. You could pick up your clothes neatly pressed and starched on the due date provided it did not rain- as all drying was in the outdoors- we were using solar energy ahead of the curve. Also on this street were Norshir and Homi Rustomjee, both Parsis and well known Attorneys. The Redlich s and the da Silva's too lived here prior to their departure for Australia. The Vaz family, The Lovell's, The Abeysinghe's were all longtime residents, who may have also cracked the 50 year barrier.\n\nWhen you add it up you will find that the ethnic diversity that was so typical of Colombo was celebrated down Joseph Lane. Thanks for the opportunity to share this memory.\n\nThe Bambalapitiya Hindu Kovil (Temple)\n\nAn annual processing marking the Hindu Vel Festival was carried out at this premises with the arrival of the traditional Vel Cart all the way from the Gintupitiya Hindu Temple, driven by white bulls and carrying symbols of the Hindu religion. This cart also proceeded to the next temple in Bamba usually referred to as the Wellawatte Kovil, about a Kilometer away to the south.\n\nThe occasion was a massive gala that provided sweet meats, traditional goods, clothes, toys and trinkets with lots of amusements for the children in an event that lasted almost a week during August of every year.\n\nSugarcane was the most abundant delicacy at this event and one would see the cane trees piled up against every wall and pillar waiting to be cut, cleaned and relished by thirsty people passing by.\n\nSugarcane was the most abundant delicacy at this event and one would see the cane trees piled up against every wall and pillar waiting to be cut, cleaned and sold to people who would relish the cane with glee.\n\nMohans, a large textile retail outlet, was one of the big businesses that occupied the long row of shops, traders and businesses that ran along the front of the Hindu temple. The nature of these trading stores is innumerable from temple flowers, camphor, joss sticks for the devoted to heavily decked gold and jewelry for the rich and famous.\n\nAnnamali Navaratnam, born in 1957, is one of them. He comes to his small garland shop, early, each morning to make the garlands with his two assistants, by hand. He is also known as \"Nava\" amongst his fellow garland makers, neighboring businesses and customers.\n\nNava has been making garlands at this location since 1982. He recalls his memories with a smile, \"I had the privilege of making cash garland (\"Kaasu Maalai\"), made from currency notes and coins for Kasiananthan. I made flower garlands for Kirupaanathavaariyar when he visited Sri Lanka, and also for Kambavaarithy Jeyaraj and several other politicians and well known celebrities whenever they visited the Temple.\"\n\nHis two assistants help him to make the garlands and deliver them to his numerous customers on time. \"I get many orders during wedding seasons and temple festive occasions,\" he said.\n\nNava buys his flowers and garland strings, in bulk, from the town of Matale in the central province. \"Flowers are very delicate, like human hearts, and I have to take extra care in having them shipped and delivered without damage\", he says.\n\nThe Bamba Gas Station & Bill Forbes\n\nCrossing back to the seaside of Galle Road, bordering Adamaly place, along Galle Road, is a gas station that dispenses, petrol, diesel, cooking gas, vehicle servicing and washing, very popular with local residents.\n\nIt was here where the famous Sri Lankan crooner Bill Forbes once worked as an attendant. The pump still stands and serves its citizens valiantly until today.\n\nBill Forbes was born on 17th December 1938 in Sri Lanka. He came to Britain in 1955 at the age of 17 doing menial clerical work by day and renting a flat in Victoria, Central London. During 1958 Bill lived out his dreams of being a famous singer by appearing regularly at the “Bread Basket” coffee bar in Tottenham Court Road.\n\nIt was while he was performing one night in September 1958 that two talent scouts representing Jack Good approached him and asked if he wanted to audition for the “Oh Boy!” show. The series had just blasted onto the nation's television screens a few weeks earlier and Bill was already a big fan of the show.\n\nThe show was a groundbreaking British pop music event from 1958-1959, in London with Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde, Bill Fury and others. He released 12 hits for EMI Columbia among them 'Too Young/It's Not the End of the World,' Sri Lankans still sing his baila hit: 'Aacha England,' recorded under the name of Kal Khan. 'Oh to be in England!' is still a favorite of many vintage Sri Lankans. Bill Forbes also appeared on Donovan Andree's musical shows in Colombo in the early 1960s and he was interviewed over Radio Ceylon by the late Vernon Corea.\n\n“I was one of 30 artists who were invited to perform before Jack Good,” recalls Bill. “I turned up for the audition which was held at the actual venue for the live show itself - the Empire Theatre in Hackney- and I was absolutely petrified.”\n\nOn entering the theatre he saw for the first time many of the series regular stars, such as the Lord Rockingham XI, the Dallas Boys, Don Lang and the Vernons Girls.\n\nFrom the 30 artists who auditioned that autumn morning Jack Good personally picked just two to appear in his “Oh Boy!” series - Emile Ford (who appeared just once on the 29th November 1958 edition) and Bill himself.\n\n“I was over the moon,” Bill said, “but the audition didn't exactly get off to a great start!” Bill chose to sing Marty Wilde's current hit “Endless Sleep” as his audition piece. But at the end of the song Jack Good told him his performance was “OK” but he sounded a bit too much like Marty.\n\n“We don't want two Marty's in the show do we?” said Jack, and he got Bill to sing another song. Bill's second audition piece was the Johnny Ray classic “Just Walking In The Rain” which was enough to convince Jack to put him in the series.\n\n“In those days Jack told YOU what songs you will sing, and nobody answered back. None of the artistes dared argue and being young and a novice I did as I was told.”\n\nBill continues “Jack gave me an American record of the upbeat spiritual song `God's Little Acre' (from the film of the same name) which he wanted me to learn and perform on the show. To be honest I wasn't too pleased with the choice because I was a BIG rock `n' roll fan and to me it just wasn't right for the time...and it definitely wasn't rock `n' roll! Oh well I thought, I'll just have to put up with it and sing it.”\n\nBill attended the painstaking rehearsals both at the Empire Theatre and the Four Provinces of Ireland Club in Islington during the latter part of October in preparation for his “Oh Boy!” television debut, which was due to be on Saturday 1st November 1958. (Show Number 8).\n\nHowever a few days prior to the live broadcast Jack called Bill with some crushing news. Tommy Steele had agreed to come on the show at short notice and so Bill's spot was cancelled. “\n\nI was devastated by the news. I didn't hear anything from Jack for several weeks after that. I was in limbo at that time.\n\nI began to think he didn't want me at all and the call was just a polite way of letting me down.”\n\nThen at the beginning of December Bill was finally given his big chance- and a date for his debut show… Saturday 13th December 1958 (Show Number 14)\n\nBill sang the spiritual number backed by the Lord Rockingham XI with the Dallas Boys and the Vernons Girls providing the vocal backing and choreography.\n\nShortly after the show Bill signed a recording contract with Columbia Records and between 1959 and 1962 released eight singles, the biggest of which “Too Young” reached the number 29 position in UK Charts during December 1959.\n\nHis biggest success however was in his homeland of Sri Lanka, where his 3rd Columbia release “Too Young” backed with “It’s Not The End of the World” became a double-sided number one hit at the beginning of 1960.\n\nBill was regarded as something of a hero in Sri Lanka, because although they had never seen the “Oh Boy” show over there, its reputation had spread worldwide and it was big news that one of its homegrown talents was starring in it.\n\nToday, Bill is still regarded as the first Sri Lankan solo artist ever to secure a recording contract and a hit recording outside his native country.\n\nWhen he returned there for a 10-day whistle stop tour in early 1960 - topping the charts with his version of the evergreen ballad “Too Young”- he was mobbed in the streets and even invited to lunch with the Prime Minister at his official residence.\n\n“The biggest kick for me was that “Too Young” knocked Cliff Richard's “Living Doll” off the top of the Sri Lanka charts. I really felt I'd made it! It all happened so fast it's just a blur when I think about it now. All the detail gets lost when so many good things happen at once,” Bill said.\n\nOn 17th January 1959 Bill Forbes made his 2nd of 11 appearances on the series. He sang another song chosen for him by Jack called “Woman From Liberia” which would prove a big hit with the viewers. “She gave me water but it was not from the well” are the songs most memorable if not politically correct lyrics, which warns against accepting suspect liquid refreshment from dodgy African women!\n\nDespite its popularity here in Britain the song was never released as a single.\n\nBill sang the song again the following week 24th January (as well as “God's Little Acre”) and for the very final show on 30th May - at Jack's request. Fortunately this final show has survived so at least one Bill Forbes performance has been preserved on film for posterity.\n\nBill's unscheduled 4th appearance on the 7th February 1959 show came out of the blue and proved to be a highlight in his career.\n\nBill recalls; “On the Friday - the day before the live broadcast- Jack called me suddenly to say that Cliff was sick with laryngitis and was unable to appear. And he wanted me to stand in as Cliff's replacement.”\n\nCliff was due to sing 3 solo songs as well as a duet with Marty, and I had to learn all five numbers with just 24 hours’ notice.\n\n“I sang “Hot Dog”, and “Love Me Tender”. Fortunately I was an Elvis fan so most of the lyrics were no real obstacle. “For the finale Marty Wilde and I closed with a duet singing “Rip It Up”, “Keep On Knocking' (But You Can’t Come In)” and “Bird Dog”.\n\n“That was my biggest moment! Normally I would only get to sing just one song but because Cliff was such a big star by this time he would always get about four or five numbers to sing. The show went very well and was my chance to shine as the big star for the week.”\n\nBill's 5th appearance on “Oh Boy!” was on 28th February singing “Bim-Bom-Bey”- a country hit in 1959 for Jimmy Rodgers in the USA.\n\nA modern casino, catering to foreigners only, now stands right next to the gas station where in days of yore a very popular wine and grocery store, owned and managed by the famous food people, the Corera family, used to stand.\n\nThen comes Arthur’s place, a narrow lane that winds its way down to the beach. The next block was previously occupied by the old Majestic Theatre and car park which was famous for showing MGM movies from Hollywood, three times daily on weekdays and four on weekends.\n\nToday, the block has been converted, by the same management of Ceylon Theatres Ltd., into a sprawling metropolis called Majestic City which houses a massive department store, famous fast food restaurants, KFC, and also multi-cinema facilities showing the latest movies from Hollywood to the Sinhala screen.\n\nNear the Majestic City behind the Gas Station resided the late\n\nHamid Ariff and family and SithyMa married to Mohideen Textiles son. A daughter of theirs is married to politician Fowzy’s son.\n\nStation Road\n\nThe block ends with Station Road which is located right opposite to where the market begins. Station Road is so named, in several towns in Colombo, representing the fact that the railway station is located at its sea-front end. Bambalapitiya is no different.\n\nThe family of MHM Muhseen, married to Khadeeja Ghouse, lived down Station Road. Their son Imtiaz worked for Ceylon Tobacco Company Ltd and then moved to Uzebekistan and is presently employed and living in the UK. Imthiaz is married to Tirmizi Naina-Marikar. The daughter is married to Nawaz Vilcassim from Galle and lives in Singapore where Nawaz is employed and they have now migrated to Australia. The youngest, son Fazal, is married to Naizar Cader’s daughter, also from Galle is also now is Australia.\n\nAt the end of Station Road a perpendicular right turn would take one to meet the bottom of Arthurs Place thus making it an easier way to move round in a rectangle back to Galle Road from either street. Station Road and Majestic Avenue stand face to face and in recent times a very necessary set of traffic lights have been set up at this junction in order to bring some sanity to the chaotic flow of men and machines on this busy highway.\n\n“El Patio Yveony”\n\nThe beautiful home and mansion,”El Patio Yveony”, owned and lived in by Onally Gulamhussein and his celebrity wife Yvonne Toussaint starts off the next block of land adjoining Station Road.\n\nOnally, nicknamed “Jutehessian” and his wife the socialite Yvonne Gulamhussian, nee Toussaint, was referred to as Mrs. Ooh La Jute Hessian.\n\nOnally was a rich Muslim business man who went for dance classes to the Yvonne Toussaints dance school. Once married she inherited wealth which Onally used to propel her to be the Fashion setter in the capital. Onally was a businessman and Yvonne ran a Fashion shop and fashion shows. 'Atrocious fashions' some critics would claim....some out of jealousy no doubt. Probably ahead of its time!! On occasions she would be at a rugby match played at the Havelock sports club leading a poodle whose hair was dyed to match her own hairdo. I remember on one occasion a guy by the name of 'bada' Cassim followed close behind leading a 'pariah' dog just to annoy Yvonne.\n\nThe area facing the Galle Road which used to be the front yard of the villa has now been blocked, sold and built up into another mall where many lucrative and flourishing businesses have sprung up alongside including Perera & Sons bakers, Vijitha Yapa Book Store and several other new and old enterprises.\n\nAlong this same row was located the famous Stadium that hosted many scintillating entertainment performances organized by the famous Donovan Andree during his hey days of the entertainment business.\n\nThey lived on the sea side on the lane adjacent to the Majestic cinema. The entrance was from Bamba Station Road. This was a large property bound on the east by Galle Rd and ran at least half way to the beach.\n\n[contributions also made by Graham Koch, Vajira Gunewardena & Kusum Perera]\n\nThe stadium which belonged to Donavan Andree and Mubarak Thaha where there was a lot of water circus and many overseas performance that took place and was later managed by Donavan’s son Malcolm Andree who was famous for various broadcasting and musical shows along with Chris Greet as his compere. Along a row of businesses, which included Silk Paradise owned and managed by a Sindhi family, was a two storey building which was used for residential purposes one of which was occupied by the Jansz family. Linda Jansz attended St. Paul’s Milagiriya at Bamba.\n\nThe whole place has now been torn down to give way to a massive department store complex.\n\nComments\n\nJulian Fernando I did D.J. at her place at Bamblapitya.
