When the voyage is taken in time of war, the whole aspect changes. . . . then a voyage, no matter where, is of a very diƒerent class altogether. —Frederick Lewis, Sixty Years in Ceylon\n\nAn Italian named Marignolli was the first European tourist to be robbed in Ceylon. In the mid-fourteenth century, he was on his way back to Florence from China with the various treasures he had amassed. Blown oƒ course, his ship landed in Seyllan (Ceylon), where it fell into the hands of a devious Saracen robber who proceeded to strip him of all the finery he was bringing back from China. Apart from that incident, Marignolli found the island quite to his liking. Judging by his accounts, he decided that the isle was, if not Paradise itself, very close to it in a literal sense. Using some imaginative mathematical calculations, he calibrated the distance between the two places and arrived at the figure of a mere forty Italian miles, so close that “the sound of the waters falling from the fountain of Paradise” could be heard in Seyllan. Reason enough to want to come back. And come back many did over the centuries before and after: travelers from Europe, Asia, Africa, and, more recently, America. Some were blown oƒ course; some came for the spices; some to conquer and rule; some, much later, simply to sunbathe. Fa-Hien, from China in the late fourth century AD, was one of the first to\n\n3\n\n4\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nlead the brigade, followed by a Greek merchant named Cosmas in the mid-sixth century. Marco Polo briefly made port here, as did Ibn Batuta, a traveling Moor from Tangier. Dutch admirals, Portuguese soldiers, French envoys, German mercenaries, and (more recently) European sun worshippers shaking winter oƒ their backs—all have come to the island. I came to teach. Over the centuries visitors invented wonderful, magical names for this small place in the Indian Ocean. As they drew maps, the island looked to them like a teardrop hanging oƒ the coast of India. Some saw it rather as a pearl. Those with a more scientific bent considered the island a geological fragment broken oƒ from the Indian subcontinent when the earth was still forming. The Greeks and Romans called it Taprobane (a corruption of the word tambapanni, meaning copper-colored palms); the Arab traders, Serendib, their version of Sihaladipa, the island of the Sinhala. The Portuguese, arriving in search of spice, called it Ceilao; the Dutch tweaked it to Ceylan; and the British, who moved in in 1815 and then out again in 1948, modified it to Ceylon, the name retained today by tea purveyors the world over. In 1972, the people who actually live on this island reclaimed the name Sri Lanka, which in Pali means “resplendent isle,” a name that the Sinhalese majority of the population had used throughout even as foreign powers came and went. The Tamils knew the island as Ilankai, the Tamil translation of Lanka. “Going and coming?” the man at passport control asked me at 3:00 in the morning as my son Noah and I stood rooted in line at Colombo International Airport after two and a half days of flying. “Pardon?” was all I could muster at that hour. “Going and coming, madam? And how long will you be staying?” “No, not a tourist. One year. Resident visa.” “Very well, madam. And you will be living, madam?” “Kandy,” I answered, “but working in Peradeniya. I will be teaching there.” Half an hour later Noah and I stood in silence with a hundred or so other people, rendered stupid by sleeplessness, and listened to the\n\nade le barke r\n\n5\n\ngrinding of a baggage carousel badly in need of oiling as it disgorged boxes carrying TVs, electrical appliances, baby carriages, oversized suitcases, and furniture wrapped in bubble wrap. We grabbed what was ours, wended our way through customs, down hallways, passed stores asleep for the night, and at 3:30 in the morning walked out into South Asia. And into a crowd of five hundred people on the walkway and street. “Quite a welcoming committee,” I remarked to Noah. “I don’t think they’re here for us, Mom.” As we made our way through the crowd, I noticed signs up everywhere with pictures on them of something that looked like a cross between a pineapple and a small melon announcing in English and two indecipherable languages that under no circumstance was durian to be brought on board an airplane. I looked at Noah. “Do you know what durian is?” “Very smelly fruit, madam,” a man nearby with his own load of luggage told us. “Very sweet taste, very bad odor.” I asked him if he knew anything about the crowd that had stationed itself here. “They’re waiting, madam. We didn’t have this problem formerly. People could come and go into the airport. They could accompany whoever was leaving all the way to passport control. But we had this unfortunate incident this past summer and now only the people who are actually traveling and can produce a ticket are allowed in. Excuse me, but I believe you are American. We are very, very sorry.” He put his hands together and bowed. I thanked him and put Noah and myself into a cab. “First time Sri Lanka?” our driver asked. “Yes, first time.” “Madam, your country?” “America,” I replied. I looked over at Noah, who was already dozing in the seat next to me. “Very sorry, madam, for your problems. Very big problem just now in America.” I thanked him. It is three weeks since 9/11. Thirteen time zones removed from where I am registered to vote, six degrees north of the equator, latitudinally level with the Republic of Central Africa,\n\n6\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nColombia, and Baker Island, there is not a person here who does not know about 9/11. Things do not work quite the same the other way around. We have come to a country that has been at war with itself for close to twenty years. And yet it is a war that has gone underreported in the U.S. press. On July 24, 2001, two months prior to our arrival, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (known as the LTTE) who, under the leadership of Vellupillai Prabhakaran, have been fighting for an independent homeland in the north for eighteen years, launched an attack on the Sri Lanka Air Force Base and the adjoining Colombo International Airport in the predawn hours. In the ensuing six-hour melee, twenty-six commercial and military airlines were destroyed or heavily damaged. All thirteen rebels were killed. The intervening weeks had done nothing to resolve the situation, as President Chandrika Kumaratunga proceeded to dissolve Parliament to avoid having her government toppled by the opposition. Subsequently two more car bombs had gone oƒ, and two suicide bombers had detonated themselves in busy sections of Colombo. By the time we arrived in 2001, the civil war had claimed forty thousand lives. “You are going where for a year?” asked the woman at the company that handles my car insurance in Tucson, Arizona. “Did you say Sierra Vista?” Our taxi took us through unlit, rain-soaked streets and deposited us into a time capsule approximately one hundred years back in the heyday of British colonialism at the Galle Face Hotel. We were greeted in our predawn haze by a Sri Lankan doorman with a handlebar moustache, dressed in a white uniform with gold braid, looking like something out of Kipling. We went immediately to our room and collapsed into sleep to the sound of waves fifty feet from us doing battle with the seawall. Toward afternoon we roused ourselves and found our way down a carpeted staircase of nineteenth-century elegance. Ever so slightly the worse for wear, our hotel still retained something of the grace it sported under the British Raj. Something was wrong here, though. We seemed to be the only guests. We were in a play with no peo­ ple in it.\n\nade le barke r\n\n7\n\nWe walked out onto a portico with tables set up and a view of the Indian Ocean. We seated ourselves and looked around nervously until a lone waiter appeared from another room. Gracious and attentive, he ministered to our breakfast needs and stood over us should we need anything, just anything at all. And for the next five days we were watched over by a staƒ that catered to the slightest nod of the head or movement of the hand. We ate long, lingering breakfasts on the hotel veranda. Sometimes I would watch a bartender sitting lazily on a stool, pausing from his languor long enough to dust some glasses; I would order gin and tonics on the back porch; we dined by candlelight and sea spray on the patio. We walked through empty dining rooms and ballrooms. An American named Jon Pearce came over to join us one evening for dinner, having learned from the Fulbright Commission that some new American Fulbrighters had just arrived. He had been teaching for four months at the University of Colombo. His family was still back in California, but his wife would be joining him shortly. He talked to us a little bit about being here on 9/11. I could tell we were getting only half the story. For our part I gave him the formal version of why we were here. It’s a Senior Fulbright, I told him, but up in Kandy and for a year. That was the version the State Department got, but for me it had all come down to something Bruce Chatwin once said: “If it’s a case of going or staying, always get the hell out.” And I did. Jon’s travels had taken him to Africa and Turkey. It was obviously Africa that he had absorbed. Sitting there alone, he seemed to be that part of his family that had been struck with wanderlust. I felt an instantaneous bond with this nomad with a shock of white hair. Ironically, we who had come here to be anything but tourists were the tourists. We are the objects of everyone’s day, the goal of what remains of the tourist trade in and out of our hotel. In the wake of 9/11, there is simply no one here. But we aren’t very good tourists. We don’t budge. We spend our first days in Sri Lanka in the United States, Noah in front of the television watching CNN and the BBC, me in front of the window or on the veranda of the old colonialist dowager, staring out to sea.\n\n8\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nI spend a lot of time outside just looking at the sky. The young men who are doing repairs watch me watching the sky. Rain hangs heavy in the air as the gray sea creeps into a gray sky. “Madam, you are watching our sea a lot, no?” asks one of the men who works here. “Yes,” I tell him. “I am from the desert, and I love the sea. I am trying to get to know Sri Lanka’s waves.” “Our monsoon this year was late,” he tells me. “But now it is finished almost. But when monsoon is finished, still we have a monsoon sea. That is why waves are very big just now.” He is quiet for a moment. The two of us just stand there and look. “Madam,” he says, “our monsoon is like our war. We know we can count on it, but we don’t know when.” On our last day in Colombo I stood on the portico looking out onto Galle Face Green, assessing the possibility for rain that day. A Sri Lankan gentleman, perhaps guessing my nationality, came over to join me. We talked about the sea, the winds, the late monsoon this year and the drought in the south. And then: “We are all very, very sorry.” I thanked him. The next day Noah and I got ready to leave for our new home. We shut the windows, drew the curtains, packed up, and turned oƒ the TV. We turned our back on the sea and headed inland up into the mountains.\n\nchapte r\n\n2\n\nStudent Life\n\nIn 1940 an Englishman named Ivor Jennings, dressed in the de rigueur white drill suit and Panama hat worn by white men coming to the tropics for the first time, arrived on the island that the English called Ceylon. He brought with him several steamer trunks and a vision. Even as World War II was moving into Asia, Jennings had his sights set on founding a university, an oriental Cambridge nestled at the foot of the Hantana range in the hill country of the island. By 1942 his dream began to take shape as the University of Ceylon was founded in Colombo. It would take another twelve years of inordinate delays, mind-numbing bureaucratic hassles, and the clearing of scrub jungle and rubber and tea plantations that had been running at a loss for some time before Jennings’s pastoral vision would be realized. After the war the architects, gardeners, and landscapers moved in, carving out of the brush, tea, and rubber a horticultural Eden that would become the intellectual home for Ceylon’s brightest and best. Scrub was moved out; aloe plants were moved in. Finally, in 1954 a residential university came into being up at Peradeniya in the hill country of Ceylon. Graced with greenery and laced with the streams that fell from the upper reaches of the mountains, the place was designed originally as an extension of the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens, the beauties of the one spilling over into the other through interlinking footpaths. Today if you hike up into the Hantana range far enough, you will come across some of the remaining tea estates, several of which are still being cultivated. Along the old road lead\n\n9\n\n10\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\ning up there sit the campus Buddhist temple, the Hindu kovil, the campus chapel, and the mosque, each partially concealed behind a scrim of green. I was late for the start of the school year by four months. I had been asked via e-mail the previous summer whether I could teach nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian literature since the students in the English program need one foreign literature for their degree. I agreed since most of my training had been in Russian studies. And criticism. Could I do feminist literary theory? Yes, of course. What about a semester of early American literature? This was a little more complicated, but over the summer I was able to pull things together before we left the States. “We’ve got two batches of students here,” my colleague Thiru Kandiah had told me in one of a series of long e-mails we exchanged before I arrived. He told me about the student insurrections that started in the early 1970s and then resurfaced in the 1980s during the civil war. Some of the other university campuses were aƒected by them, but Peradeniya was the epicenter. The government closed the campus down. In the meantime, a new batch of students were accepted, causing di¤culties when the university reopened. “We’re still processing the backlog of students from the 1980s and 1990s who got accepted but couldn’t attend because the university was shut down,” Thiru told me. There are now two diƒerent tracks with two diƒerent sets of requirements as a result of all the closures. Thiru thinks they should be finished with the backlog by 2005 or 2006. In this same e-mail he warned me, “Expect nothing to go smoothly.” We had come up to the town of Kandy where we would be living for the next year in and out of intermittent downpours. I rubbed the steam from the window of the van and could see young women alongside the road taking cover under their tarps. Next to them stood tables with bags of varying shapes and sizes all lined up. “What are they selling?” I asked. “These are the cashew ladies,” came the answer from the driver. “You’re in Pasyala. Each town here sells something diƒerent. Soon,\n\nade le barke r\n\n11\n\nmadam, you will come to the wicker town and then the clay pots town.” As we inched up the mountain, the rain showed no signs of abating, and the driver pulled over at a tea kade to wait out the storm. “Is it the monsoon?” I asked. “Well, madam, we are calling it here pre-monsoon, so not exactly monsoon yet.” “So, is the monsoon worse?” “No, not actually worse, madam.” “So, what is the diƒerence then? How can I tell the diƒerence between the two?” I pressed on. “It is rain, madam,” he said with a shrug of the shoulders and a smile. As we waited for our tea I watched banana leaves torn from their trees lying drenched on the ground. Something rather grandiose, slimy and black and seemingly impervious to the rain, made its way across the street. “Monitor lizard, madam,” said the driver, seeing the look on my face. “Come madam, we are going now to Kandy Town.” We had taken a house for the first week up on a hill alongside the lake in Kandy. The place was a hand-me-down of sorts from an American family who had lived there briefly the year prior before moving up into the hills. I looked around me. No, we will not stay here, I thought to myself, but for now it was a place to lay our heads. I got Noah into school, the International School across the river, headed by a British master who, from what I could gather, was fed up with life in the Midlands, pulled up stakes, and ended up six degrees north of the equator with a new life. With Noah at least marginally settled, I called the university and was told to show up the next morning prepared to start classes. Food. Our bubble of colonialist privilege had suddenly burst the day we arrived in Kandy, as I realized somewhat belatedly that we were going to have to feed ourselves. But the bubble closed in around us once more as we walked into the one grocery store in town, clearly designed for foreigners and Kandy’s upper crust, a place called Food City, where the door was held open for us by a man straight\n\n12\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nout of Kipling, looking suspiciously like the doorman at the Galle Face Hotel. The stuƒ on the shelves looked to be straight out of Kip­ling as well. Jacobs Biscuits. Scotch malt. Clearly, this couldn’t be where people actually shop, but we had fetched up here somehow because we were new and foreign and white, and because I didn’t know enough to know what I was doing yet. We emerged with enough to keep body and soul together for the next two days until I could start putting the pieces of our life together. And for now that was good enough. From one of the sellers on the street, I bought a big red plastic tub with a picture of a Chinese baby on the bottom. It was to be our laundry tub for the next year. As we emerged from the store a short, stocky Sri Lankan wearing a Sea World T-shirt and a pair of jeans appeared with his hand outstretched. He smiled broadly and introduced himself as Champika. “Madam, I am your tuk-tuk driver. Other American will say you will be coming. I am here your driver all year.” Champika was way ahead of me. I was still dealing with the word tuk-tuk, and Noah was getting his first close-up look at something that looked like a cross between a bumper car and a rickshaw. There were at least fifty of these all parked in a one-block area around the food store, from which people were coming and going with packages filled with colonialism. I was getting the sense that word of our arrival had indeed preceded us. A small group of young men in their twenties had already gathered round to listen in and smile. They were all sporting T-shirts with American logos on them and all were tuk-tuk drivers. We seemed to have inherited Champika and didn’t have the strength or the wherewithal to have it any other way, at least not for now. By the end of the conversation, I’d gotten Noah to school and back for the rest of the year and me to the university, all of this at the local grocery store. “No problem. We go and come to campus,” he assured me, grabbing our sacks and ushering us in the direction of his tuk-tuk. And so, tucked in the back of a metal three-wheeler with a canvas roof over our heads, propelled by a small motor that sputtered tentatively, we wove with Champika in and out through tra¤c—stalled buses, moving buses, people attempting more or less successfully\n\nade le barke r\n\n13\n\nto cross the street—and lurched around the lake to our temporary quarters, bringing home the plastic tub with the Chinese baby on the bottom of it. I had the feeling I didn’t need to give Champika our address as he headed up the hill to Mahamaya Mawatha, where we were staying. I looked out at the hawkers on the street and the miniature school vans glutting the roadway around the lake. Champika was singing to the accompaniment of horns. “You call me when you will be finished.” “Yes, yes, I’ll call,” I assured Champika as I looked down the hill onto the campus the next morning. “Good luck,” he said in perfect English. In my straw hat I headed down the stairs alongside the theater and threaded my way in and out of a sea of umbrellas that young women were carrying to protect themselves from the sun. People turned and smiled. Someone pointed me toward the English Faculty, and I walked through an open-air atrium, passed groups of Muslim women in their veils, passed doors with signs reading “Department of Tamil Studies,” “Anthropology,” “Department of Sinhalese Studies,” and into the secretary’s o¤ce of the English department. Half an hour later I was standing in a classroom facing my six students: all female, all English majors, all about to graduate. “You will have us all year, until June, madam,” they told me. “We are what you call third-year batch.” I spent that morning telling them a little about myself: where I came from, that I was here with my son, and that I needed a break from the life I was living. “Are you married, madam?” came the inevitable question. “No, I’m not married; it’s just me and my son.” Are they surprised, I wondered? We all wanted to know more about each other than we were asking and so the larger questions got subsumed into the more immediate ones of textbooks. There is no university bookstore, and the bookstores in Kandy for the most part sell Sri Lankan literature and the British classics. They order what they can, but not everything is easily available. Thiru had warned me about this ahead of time, and so I had multiple copies of the various works we were going to read\n\n14\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nshipped over. All arrived in good order until the anthrax scare hit the diplomatic pouch of the State Department and boxes destined for half a world away began to pile up in Washington. Some things arrived four months late. I simply changed the syllabus. Having dispensed with the textbook problem for now, we embarked that first day on Russian literature. Classes ran in two-hour segments. At the end of an hour, I asked my six girls if they would like a break. “No, madam, we are quite fine, thank you.” And when the first class ended, the second began in the same room with the same young women. “And so I will see you tomorrow,” I told them at the end of our first day together. I had just said something wrong. There was a stilled silence broken finally by Kanchuka, who proceeded to initiate me into the finer mysteries of Sri Lankan holidays. “Madam, we have poya tomorrow. It is our full moon. It is a Buddhist holiday. The Buddha was born, received enlightenment, and died all under a poya. And so on these days everything is closed.” It is lovely, enchanting, and I told them I wished we had something like it in the States. Sri Lanka, I was about to learn, has the wellearned distinction of having more holidays than any other country in the world. Sometimes I will have trouble getting anything taught because of all the holidays. And so began my year of teaching with our classes woven in and out of poya days, election days, election violence days, the religious holidays of four diƒerent religions, and university-induced holidays. “Kanchuka, Nirosha, Rozmin, Sumudu, Tanya, and Vihara,” I repeated to myself in Champika’s tuk-tuk on the way back to try to sort out our domestic situation.\n\nchapte r\n\n3\n\nHousekeeping\n\nI wasn’t sure if we were going to keep this house. It sat above the lake constructed under the last Kandyan king and above the tennis courts of the Kandy Garden Club constructed under the British Raj, both defunct yet ever-present phenomena. The house was way too big for the two of us and seemed almost cavernous. Made of stucco with greenery clinging to its outside walls, the place seemed hollow and uninviting with its three bedrooms, two baths, and a long hallway that led out into an area that was part storage room, part work area. As I walked through its spaces, I saw mementos from other years: other families’ pieces of Sri Lankan folk art, something else that suggested that someone had been to Africa. Old furniture stood side by side with tables and bookcases of hastily thrown together particleboard. From the kitchen and dining room I could see out onto a small back patio where the washing and drying was done and where a steep hill sent down coconuts and rocks torn loose from the world above our house. Further on beyond the connecting work area were other houses, where the landlords lived and where guests came to visit. A portico between the houses was rimmed by a small grassy area that bordered a long hedge punctuated by trees whose leaves and branches were as unknown to me as the birds that nested in them. Our own house had been vacant for a year and a half and bore all the marks of a place left to its own devices. Bus tra¤c from around the lake sprang into action at 5:00 in the morning, sometimes earlier, creating fumes that rose from the street below, up over our\n\n15\n\n16\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nhedge, and into our lives and laundry. But by week’s end I stopped looking for other places partially, though not entirely, out of lethargy. Something kept us here. Perhaps it was my fantasy of having a porch, which I initially saw as a place of Buddhist contemplation. But as the months went by and the power outages increased, a lot of our domestic activity would get shifted outside to make use of the lingering daylight. We ate, talked, read, and observed bird life. Noah prepared schoolwork and listened to music on his CD player. I dug up some old pots that had partially disintegrated and merged with the foliage and sat on the porch steps, planting seedlings and flowers in them. We kept the house for other reasons too. The life in our compound seemed a microcosm of at least part of the island. Kush and Nandana, our landlords, were upper-class Sinhalese. Kush ran the local Kandyan branch of the Alliance Française, while Nandana oversaw that part of our compound that served as a guesthouse for travelers, mainly from France. Latha, a Sinhalese woman with some English, was in charge of cleaning and cooking in the main guesthouse and prepared Kush and Nandana’s meals everyday. From our first day here I had seen an older man of unclear age, perhaps in his sixties, and of slight build, pruning, cleaning, taking care of Kush and Nandana’s dog, planting, and doing repairs. He worked in his sarong, that piece of colorful material wrapped around his waist and reaching almost to the ground, and . . . an oƒ-white button-down shirt. He was introduced to us as Velu, the Tamil guardian of the property. He had no English, just a gentle smile and a tongue made red by the daily chewing of betel leaf. “How do I communicate with him?” I asked Kush, whose English, like that of many upper-class Sinhalese, was the product of schooling in the language both on the island and abroad. “His native language is Tamil. He’s estate Tamil, but it will be better for you to learn Sinhalese and speak to him in it. He can get you bread from the bakery in the morning.” “How do you say ‘bread’?” “Simple. It’s pan.’ ” “Pan,” I said. Velu smiled.\n\nade le barke r\n\n17\n\nKush started with the numbers. “Tell him how many loaves you will want. Eka, dekka, tunai, hatarai.” We stopped at four. “We will never eat that many,” I told her, laughing. “You will need a housekeeper and a cook,” she told me. “There is a woman available who used to work for one of the former tenants. Shall we get a message to her?” This is where I dug in my heels. I didn’t do this at home. Why should I do it here? There was also a race thing that was getting in the way. I didn’t want people who are darker than me fixing our meals and cleaning for us. I was not going to do colonialism. I was going to do this myself. And so I turned down the oƒer. “She needs the work,” Kush told me. “But you decide.” I took down the heavy brown curtains in the living room, stiƒ with age and dirt. Noah and I washed and scraped the walls. I stripped the couches of their thick, brown wool covers and bought some cheap, yellow material at the market that I had made into slip covers. We changed lightbulbs, dusted oƒ lighting fixtures, brushed away cobwebs, and made periodic cleaning forays into the bathroom. I moved seven large pieces of furniture out to a storage shed with Nandana’s help, and threw buckets of hot water at the outside walls of the house, blackened by diesel fumes from the road below. We never did get everything really clean, but we went through the process of claiming the place as our own, which was more important. Occupied dirt was the way I like to think of it. We spent our first days in our home announcing our presence to everything that had taken up residence in it since the past tenants had moved away. Footsteps on the floors, doors slamming, toilets flushing, and electricity switched on and oƒ served as necessary reminders to the creatures inside the walls that henceforth this was shared space. The street outside our house reverberates with the generally happy cacophony of life. It starts up in the morning as the buses and trishaws begin their daily forays around the lake to the accompaniment of the blasting of horns—the modus operandi for driving in South Asia. By 6:00 the noise has spilled up onto our street, which starts to come alive with the chatter of pigtailed girls in their school whites heading up the hill to Mahamaya Girls College. By 7:00 vans\n\n18\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nglutted with other schoolkids, delivery trucks, local tra¤c, people walking to work, more tuk-tuks, construction workers, people taking shortcuts to avoid the gridlock on the street below, and locals on their way to the communal bathing spot at the top of the hill are all vying for the same lane and a half outside our house. Like most of the homes on this street, ours has a high metal gate with a chain and lock designed to keep the boundaries drawn. Some houses seem to accomplish this more e¤ciently than ours. The area just outside the gate becomes a parking area for some of the hundreds of small, white, privately owned vans that take kids back and forth to school in and around Kandy and create gridlock early in the morning and at 2:00 in the afternoon. Our gate area is also a meeting place for couples, while the gate itself becomes a swing for twenty to thirty schoolchildren who use it as a kind of teeter-totter while waiting for their school vans. People drift in and out of our compound all day, selling housewares and clothes, looking for rooms. One Sunday from my porch I watched a man—barefoot, clad only in his sarong, and holding a plastic bag—deftly scaling our frangipani tree. He saw me and made a sign that I was not to worry. I continued to stare at him as he picked flowers from the tree and put them in his plastic sack. Soon Velu emerged, also half clad, with coconut in hand to chase the fellow away. I asked Kush about this later, and she told me that the flower sellers outside the Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Tooth where the reliquary of the Buddha’s tooth is housed, come frequently to pick the blossoms from the frangipani tree since only flowers that have not yet touched the ground can be oƒered to the Buddha. Another time a woman and her small daughter arrived with her husband’s death certificate, wondering if we could help the family. We did. The next week she arrived again. I gave less that time and for four months after still felt wrong about it. I never saw her again. After our first few days of settling in, I came out one morning, tea in hand, to make my morning inspection of the flora and fauna. A slight, middle-aged woman was standing on the dirt path leading from the house to the main gate. She had on a worn sari and carried a large pocketbook and a plastic bag. Her hair, streaked with gray, was\n\nade le barke r\n\n19\n\npulled back into a bun. We stood looking at each other until Velu arrived to sort out the situation. They bowed to each other; clearly, they were old friends. He turned to me. “Loku Menike,” he said, and I knew the name. This was the woman whom Kush had oƒered me when we first moved in to do our cooking and cleaning and whom I had turned down. Somehow she had turned up anyway. I had talked briefly in Colombo with a young American woman who had employed her. “Don’t get confused,” she said. “She’s not your servant. She is your key to the culture. Don’t mix the two. She is educated, she knows a bit of English. The only thing is that she didn’t get through her A levels, and so now she is working in diƒerent capacities for people. Her husband died a few years ago. She needs the work.” Now Nandana joined the group to translate. Much bowing and greeting ensued. “She wants to start today,” he said. I told him that I didn’t even know if I wanted to hire her and that I didn’t feel right about this. I took him aside. “I don’t want to be British and colonial.” “A lot of people say that, and then because of their principles a lot of other people are left without work,” he said, smiling. “It’s our economy; it’s the war. But it’s your choice.” “What do I call her? Loku?” “No,” he laughed. “Loku means ‘big.’ You can’t just call someone ‘Big.’ Besides, she’s little. You call her Loku Menike. It means ‘Big Gem.’ Some women are called Podi Menike, or ‘Little Gem.’ It’s from Buddhist tradition. We worship the triple gems.” I went back and bowed to her. Inside the plastic bag she had brought her work clothes. Loku Menike started work that day. The next day I arrived home from the university and walked into the house to find all the furniture rearranged—but in a way that seemed to defy reason. Loku Menike had been at work, waxing the floors that day with a red wax paste. And so began our biweekly waxing, as this very small woman over whom I towered took cloth to floor and with considerable strength turned the floors at 2 Mahamaya Ma-\n\n20\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nwatha into replicas of all other floors in all other homes in Sri Lanka. It was our house’s entry card into respectability. There still remained the unsolved problem, however, of the other creatures in the house sharing our living space, the ant population for one. Our first weeks in Kandy consisted of a personal ant vendetta on my part. I pulverized them with the bug spray that we brought with us from the United States. One morning I walked into the bathroom to find a discreet ring decorating the edge of every available surface—over the door, down the cabinet, around the sink, and along the towel rack—with no particular point of origin. They looked like tiny brown beads . . . until I put my glasses on. I embarked on a raid and naively claimed victory. Within hours they had reclaimed their territory. After several weeks of repeated failures on Loku Menike and my part to rid the house of its cohabitants, I made an uneasy truce with them. A few days later, I opened the door of the microwave, which hadn’t been used for years, only to find a suspicious-looking black film inside. I prodded it and watched the floor of the microwave leap into motion as the film devolved into thousands of black ants. I slammed the door closed in revulsion, remembering the Greek poet Sappho’s injunction not to prod the rubble on the beach if you’re squeamish about what you’re going to find there. Wise words. That evening I put the dishes away after dinner. The next morning I opened the cupboard only to be greeted by two shelves of our old friends, who had advanced in the night and taken up stationary positions on all available surfaces. I remembered Sappho’s injunction and let them be. Noah and I ate our breakfast that morning out of paper cups. An hour later Loku Menike arrived and uttered an “Aiyo,” an exclamation that turned out to be one of the most useful Sinhalese words I learned. It can be heard an infinite number of times throughout the day, cutting across class, caste, gender, and race lines. It is the classic linguistic response to the dizzying number of things that can go wrong. Example: I emerge from the house early in the morning with a cup of tea in my hand to see Velu holding something in the garden, shouting, “Polanga, polanga.” Nandana comes down from his room, awakened by the noise, and translates. Velu is proudly displaying a Russell’s viper that he managed to snare and\n\nade le barke r\n\n21\n\nkill just as it was slithering into my bedroom at 6:00 in the morning. Polanga is the deadliest snake on the island. A possible response to this scenario would be “Aiyo.” But to return to the ants, Loku Menike explained to me that we couldn’t kill the ants on this particular day because it was poya, or full moon day. Once again at the university there were no classes. Kush and Nandana would observe poya today by going to temple, taking flowers and fruit to the Buddha. On such days particular respect is paid to the sanctity of life—one of the seven major precepts of Buddhism. And so we closed the cabinet and went on about our business. The next morning we were barely out of bed when Loku Menike made an unannounced appearance. This was not her usual day to work. It took her forty-five minutes on the bus to get to Kandy from her village of Ratemulla, a place that sits almost untouched by time at the top of the Hantana range way beyond the town of Ampitiya. But she was here, and I looked at her and shook my head, uttering one of my ten new words, which I thought meant “Wednesday” (Badaadaa), to let her know that this wasn’t her day to work. She embarked on a narrative not limited to my ten new words, while changing from her sari into her house clothes. I understood nothing, but I watched as she headed into the kitchen, made short shrift of the ants, changed back into her sari again, and left to go back up the hill to Ratemulla. “Poya finish,” she told me. I smiled. Noah seems to be handling this better than I am. At home in the United States he is the neater of the two of us. I watch here as he cleans and creates a place for himself in his bedroom and bathroom. He doesn’t recoil in quite the same way I do from what nature throws our way. Is it a male thing, or am I simply too squeamish? Perhaps I am just being too Western about all this, too sanitized. My students look at me patiently as I discourse about my household bug situation in Kandy, but it is simply what people live with here. Maybe I just need to relax about this. But if I can just draw some kind of boundary line . . . In my own defense, I am not the first in this country to be chal-\n\n22\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nlenged by the ant population. In 1660 a Scotsman named Robert Knox was taken prisoner and held in the Kandyan Kingdom for “19 years, 6 months, 14 days,” by his own account. He was given comparative freedom to live among the people, build his own house, and engage in trade. In 1679 he escaped with several Englishmen by making his way through the central jungle down to the western coast, where he emerged sporting an eight-year growth of beard and wearing nothing but a loin cloth (to the horror of incredulous foreigners). Knox and his party were taken on board a vessel heading back to England. It was on this voyage that he began to pen his Historical Relation of Ceylon, published in 1681, a book that remains the definitive account of life in the Kandyan Kingdom in the central highlands during the nearly twenty years that Knox spent there. He also included descriptions of the island as a whole since his English-speaking readers had as yet little knowledge of these parts. Not surprisingly, living in these hills, Knox spent considerable time contemplating the local flora and fauna. He became both botanist and ethnographer of no small distinction, recording the life that he observed around him. In his notebooks he noted six diƒerent kinds of ants, from the harmless variety called Coumbias (“reddish Ants like ours in England,” he called them) to the Tale-Coumbias, Dimbios, Coura-atch, Coddia, and Vaeos. The first book recommended to me by colleagues at the university was Knox’s. Someone suggested I read Knox on ants. And so I did. After class one day I headed over to the Ceylon Room in the university library, a venerable old room stacked with antique bookcases, housing the private collections of former professors. On my way I passed the Periodical Room and took a quick look in, where I spotted a magazine called Mosquito News prominently displayed on one of the shelves. I explained to the librarian outside the Ceylon Room that I was here to read about ants. He looked up. “Robert Knox on ants,” I prompted him, lending some legitimacy to my claim to be stalking news about ants. From one of the locked glass cabinets, the librarian retrieved Robert Knox’s two-volume treatise on Ceylon. Later several of my students happened by and were very impressed that I was reading Knox.\n\nade le barke r\n\n23\n\n“What part are you reading?” they asked. “I’m reading the part on ants,” I said with a shrug. Robert Knox on ants: A fifth [type of ant] is the Codia. This ant is of excellent bright black and as large as any of the former. They dwell always in the ground; and their usual practice is to be traveling in great multitudes, but I do not know where they are going, nor what their business is; but they pass and repass, some forwards and some backwards in great haste, seemingly as full of employment as people that pass along the streets. These ants will bite desperately, as bad as if a man were burnt with a coal of fire. But they are of nobler nature: for they will not begin; and you may stand by them, if you do not tred up on them nor disturb them. The reason their bite is thus terribly painful is this; formerly these ants went to ask a wife of the noya (cobra), a venomous and noble kind of snake; and because they had such a high spirit to dare to oƒer to be related to such a generous creature, they had this virtue bestowed upon them, that they should sting after this manner. And if they had obtained a wife of the noya, they should have had the privilege to have stung full as bad as he. There is a sixth called Vaeos. These are more numerous than any of the former. All the whole earth does swarm with them. They are of middle size between the greatest and the least, the hinder part white, and the head red. They eat and devour all that they can come at; as beside food, cloth, wood, thatch of houses and every thing excepting iron and stone. So that the people cannot set anything upon the ground within their houses for them. They creep up the walls of their houses and build an arch made of dirt over themselves all the way as they climb, be it never so high. And if this arch or vault chance to be broken, they all, how high soeveer they were, come back again to mend up the breach, which being finished they proceed forwards again, eating everything they come at in their way. This vermin does exceedingly annoy the Sinhalese so much that they are continually looking upon anything they value to see if any of these Vaeos have been at it.\n\nWe began life in this house with very small, light brown ants which, after a month, were displaced by much larger, sturdier black\n\n24\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nones. It is the latter that remain today. I think we have Vaeos in our house. Sometimes I take my tea and sit on the porch and think about my horror at the bug and rodent population. I don’t ordinarily consider myself squeamish, but you couldn’t prove it here. Noah had a Sri Lankan classmate over the other day as I was in the process of launching a rearguard attack on a procession of ants. I embarked on my daily litany about the ant population. The boy smiled and said, “So?” I carry this word around with me and let it settle in for months. Get your fingers dirty, Adele. The ants were here first. We are the squatters. With the geckos I made my peace early on, perhaps because for the most part we each respected the other’s living quarters. Mainly they live behind the pictures on the wall or behind the stove. I disrupted their habitat only once in the course of a year when I decided to rehang some old pictures. One indecorously invaded my personal living space only once—the morning when I woke up to find it nestled in my hair. When I told the story at work, a colleague was interested in knowing on what part of my body the gecko had fallen. After initially being somewhat taken aback, I was subsequently introduced to the fundamentals of gecko lore. Known as Houm Sastraya in Sinhalese, it is a compendium of belief according to which a gecko can bring either good or ill fortune depending on factors as variable as what part of your body it falls on, the direction that its cry comes from, and the day of the week on which the two preceding events took place. If, for example, a gecko falls on your head or body on a Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday, it is fatal. If on a Tuesday, it is fatal to your wife (the Houm Sastraya is silent on the subject of when or if a gecko’s fall is ever fatal for the husband), and if on a Friday, one is obliged to leave one’s native country. Sunday is more auspicious; on this day the gecko can bring good luck and success, particularly if it chooses to run all over your body that day. My encounter took place on a Thursday, not an auspicious day for a rendezvous with a gecko. Something about this house nags at me. It has essentially three people taking care of it; two people and a fine specimen, our new German\n\nade le barke r\n\n25\n\nshepherd pup, Samba, actually inhabiting it; a porch with a loveseat that I have refurbished; planters with flowers—and yet it struggles to come to life. Sometimes it seems that if we relax our eƒorts to breathe home into the place it will revert immediately back to its pre-lived-in condition. Is it just the insect war that is being waged or is it something else? By the beginning of December, our shared domestic life suƒers a precipitous reversal. We are invited down to Colombo for an embassy function for the weekend and upon our return find that our house has been reclaimed. Two and a half days was all it took. Over the weekend the already precarious lines of demarcation drawn between house and jungle have collapsed. Our first hint that something has gone awry is that the puppy greets us sporting a new toy between her teeth. I look carefully and then gently remove a monkey’s skull from her mouth. A quick survey of the kitchen reveals that we are not alone. A family of rats has moved in, if it had not been there already. I walk into the kitchen only to find one of the weekend infiltrators looking down at me from the shelf above the stove. The top has been flipped oƒ the rice cooker. Something has moved in, gorged itself, defecated in the cooker, and moved on. There have been other realignments as well in the kitchen. Something has broken loose from behind the cabinets, depositing an entire colony of ants and two queens on the kitchen counter, all of which are engaged in a frantic search for their lost home. Between the living room and the hallway, an impressive-looking sand mound has appeared, evidently constructed as the future dwelling place of our Vaeos. For days, their eƒorts to rebuild are as fruitless as ours to sweep them away. We are at face-oƒ. My bedroom fares no better from the nighttime jungle raid. Having sated themselves in the kitchen, the rat family had moved on into the bedroom closet and helped themselves to the box of Crabtree and Evelyn soap I had brought over as a gift. Half the box is gone, and more than half the soap is no doubt in the process of being digested in some being’s stomach here in the house. Medicine containers and cardboard boxes have suspicious little teeth holes in them. Noah disappears into his room but comes out again holding an enormous, brightly colored orange and green gecko—beautiful,\n\n26\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nreally—that had taken up residence on his curtain along with several diƒerent species of spider. He gently wraps it up in a towel and releases it into the darkness, but not before we take a picture of it. He does it all quietly and deliberately. For my part, I shudder as I feel my way around a house that has come undone. The next three nights I lay in my bed, waiting for the sound of the rattraps Velu had set in the kitchen to snap shut. The well-heeled homes that grace our street, the fancy girls’ schools that line the hill, and the general level of city chaos belie the fact that our neighborhood occupies the outer edges of a jungle. “We live on a monkey path,” Kush told me one morning after we were unceremoniously awakened by the scratching of tin and tile on the roof, Velu yelling, and something pinging on the roof, the product of Velu’s well-aimed slingshot. “Pardon?” I asked her as we emerged in our housedresses to watch Velu at work. “Well, it’s a path that the monkeys make along the line of trees, wires and roofs in order to find their way to their favorite fruit source. This is why we don’t have decent TV service up here. We tried putting in an antenna so that we can get reception, but the monkeys took it. They come down, twenty or thirty at a time, sit on the roof, and twist the antenna until it breaks. They then carry it back up into the hills into the jungle. Perhaps they think it’s some sort of human trophy. Anyway, don’t leave things lying about in the open on the porch. They’ll take them.” At other times they knock a large jackfruit oƒ a tree, which then slides down the hill and comes to rest in the gutter outside the dining room, precipitating a fight over ownership rights. Our house is one of many that climb the hill leading to a forest reserve. As I walk up the street, I can see how the neighborhood has been hewn and chopped away from jungle growth. Noah and Nandana have taken to walking up there sometimes in the evening in search of panthers. While I have yet to see one, I need go no farther than our dining room to remind myself that we are all guests in nature here. The room backs up onto a hill from which dense growth hangs precariously, artificially halted by the walls of our house. The\n\nade le barke r\n\n27\n\nprevious tenants had installed some screens over the window grating to keep whatever comes down the hill out. Something has made short shrift of part of the screen. I keep meaning to fix it and then don’t, partially, I guess, out of the realization that it will just get eaten away again. Sometimes at night I hear rustling in the underbrush or something moving along between the hill and the house. At other times, when the ground is saturated with water, something pulls loose from the hill, tumbles down, and bumps against the house. I learn to recognize certain sounds as things move in and out of the jungle above us. I know that the monkeys are on the move from the particular way the dogs bark. Like anyplace in the tropics, gardening here consists of cutting back, pruning, chopping, and trimming. Nurseries exist here, but to me they become exercises in redundancy, the purchasing on a smaller and less interesting scale of what is already growing in profusion on our property, up the street, and in the forest. Velu spends at least one day a week cutting back the growth between the hill and the dining-room wall. On some Sundays his entire family is out in back in a communal eƒort to keep the lines of demarcation drawn. His brother arrives, along with Velu’s son and granddaughter, the men in their oƒ-white sarongs, the little girl all dressed up in a blue cotton dress, her ears pierced, her hair in tight curls. Velu tells me she is four. I come out sometimes to see her, bringing a candy bar or crayons and drawing paper I’ve brought from the States. She looks and looks at me. I’ve learned a Tamil word or two. “Wannakum” (Good morning), I say. Sometimes I watch Velu and his family from the kitchen window in back as they repair and prune. Velu will look up; I smile and wave and turn away. At other times I pass by the open storage room on the way to the main house and see him and his family sitting, quietly talking among themselves, just the four of them. We spend a lot of time here trying to keep the boundaries clear. I am reminded by Kush and Nandana to be sure the gate to the property is closed. Of course, I forget to do it properly one day and return from work to find someone’s cows grazing in the yard. These are the same cows I pass on the street every day near the lake, tying up tra¤c. Now they seem to have taken up residence here. Sometimes I see them standing outside the milk bar at the bottom of the hill.\n\n28\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nAt night they seem mysteriously to disappear, only to reemerge in the morning to take up their previous day’s activities. I try to chase them out, but they are persistent. I go to find an old rope in Velu’s storage area and start swinging it in the air. All in vain. Velu makes an appearance, says something to the cows, and they are gone. I am a guest here with ten words of Sinhalese, a fact that turns the everyday into a series of evolving mysteries. People and things do not occupy the same spaces they do at home. The cows in Kandy are an excellent case in point. Shouldn’t they be penned up somewhere instead of occupying tra¤c lanes? I think to myself, as I dodge one in order to get onto a bus. A wealthy woman in town took it upon herself several years ago to rescue cows that were headed for the slaughterhouses. She wanted to give them to some of the poorer families so that they might have milk. The problem was that the needy families couldn’t take care of the cows, so the lady was left with a surfeit of bovines with no place to keep them. And that is how, at least according to one urban legend, the cows ended up on the street. Over the months I notice that wherever I go I share the road with cattle even though the area of the island where we live is Buddhist, and thus the cow plays no particular spiritual role. Kandy, in fact, is the center for Buddhist culture on the island because it is here that the Temple of the Tooth is located. Thousands of pilgrims journey up the mountain yearly to worship at this holy spot. At 6:00 every evening I hear the chanting of a diƒerent sermon by the temple monks in ancient Pali over the loudspeaker system. I walk home from the bus station to the accompaniment of the dharma, as the tuk-tuks, buses, and cars compete with each other around the lake. But up north in the Tamil part of the country, the cow plays a very diƒerent role. There the population is predominately Hindu, and thus the cow is sacred, as in India. And yet, as the months go by, I begin to sense that on this small island one cannot simply draw a line that separates the so-called Hindu and Tamil north from the Buddhist and Sinhalese south. I feel Hinduism’s presence here in the central highlands of the island. In downtown Kandy, nestled in between hardware shops, fancy shops, and some Muslim jewelry shops, is a Hindu kovil, or temple. Several months into our\n\nade le barke r\n\n29\n\nstay Kush, in the process of applying for a job as lecturer in French at the university, took an oƒering down to the Hindu kovil to set before the gods. “But you’re Buddhist,” I said. “Why the Hindu kovil?” “Buddha isn’t a God. He did not want us to worship him. It’s a philosophy, a way of life. It is inclusive. He did not prohibit us from worshipping the gods we choose to worship. Buddha was human. Do you want to come with us?” We all went down to the kovil, placed oƒerings of flowers and fruit, and Kush got the job. And the cows, sacred or not, continued to tie up tra¤c in the land of the Buddha. It is Velu who sets my rattraps. In the morning he pulls the night’s catch out of them because I am too squeamish. He is also the one who trains the dogs, Nandana’s dog, Kiki, a Weimaraner, and our puppy, Samba. His room is oƒ the storage area on the side of our house. I sometimes wonder what it looks like, but it is a place I do not go. I hear him in the morning talking to the animals, particularly the caged monkey, Kiriya, who was rescued by Kush’s uncle years ago and is consigned to a cage with rare forays out onto the grounds. When he senses we are up, Velu calls in from the storage shed so that I can hear: “Madam, pan?” I go to the door and utter a few imperfectly pronounced words, always after the perfunctory bow. Our domestic spaces bump up against each other but remain separate, demarcations of caste and class that are not as pronounced here as in India, but are nevertheless real. I don’t know if I am supposed to cross these lines or not. Velu stands at the threshold of the side door and won’t come in unless I ask him to set the traps. Loku Menike cooks me lunch and then stands next to me while I eat it. Before I know it, we have something like a culinary routine going in the kitchen. Our kitchen life also consists of us watching each other’s eating habits while pretending not to. I ask her to sit down, but she refuses. But there is something I need from her —specifically, the knowledge of how to eat curries with my right hand, the only hand Sinhalese and Tamils, like the Arabs, use for eating. They do not use utensils and mix the curries with their right\n\n30\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nhands. The problem is that I am left-handed and need immediately to become right-handed, or at least su¤ciently so in order to eat. I can’t express what I need, so I show her what it is I am trying to do. I can’t do this at the table because she won’t sit with me, so the two of us stand in the kitchen with our plates of curry, and I watch what she does. It’s all in the mixing, Sri Lankans say. Add utensils to it and the flavor is spoiled. And so I watch her dexterously blend all the flavors together, using all of her fingers. Sometimes it seems like she is knitting on the plate. Rice, dhal, sambol, mango, eggplant curry all manage to congeal together long enough for the journey from plate to mouth. She stops, looks at me and gives me a nudge with her eyes. I start in. Rice, dhal, and mango curry seep slowly between the fingers of my right hand, forming a gooey mass on my palm. Loku Menike doesn’t even try to suppress a laugh. End of lesson for the day. Finally, after a month, we manage tea and cookies in the kitchen together, observing each other intently as we do so. Our eating and drinking habits are diƒerent. It feels sometimes as if we are doing an ethnography of each other’s world and bodies. I notice her staring at my hands. I look down. They have what my mother used to call age spots on them. Loku Menike had never seen this and looked at me semi-horrified. I tried to explain, but I couldn’t. “Maduruvo?” she asked, and I stared at her. She paused for a moment and then said, “Mosquitoes?” I didn’t know a word for them, so yes, today my age spots were mosquito bites. “Maduruvo,” I answered her, in agreement. Fevers, rashes, welts, all of these begin to appear and disappear as our bodies try to settle into the jungle. Loku Menike does a quick inspection and announces that we are having body problems because we are mixing hot, or what they call “heaty,” and cold (sitila) foods. “What do you mean by heaty?” I asked her. “Do you mean spicy, sarai? Or hot from cooking?” “Neither,” she told me, with Nandana’s help. “It’s what happens to the food once it enters your digestive system. Breadfruit has a heaty eƒect on the system. So does pineapple. Cucumber is sitila.” She asked me how much breadfruit I ate. I told her and learn that\n\nade le barke r\n\n31\n\nit is way too much; it is why I get rashes. “You should only have a little each week. It is too heaty on the system.” Sometimes, if I arrive home early enough, Loku Menike is still there. Together we make our tea. After a month or so, I invite her to sit on the porch with me. At first she hesitates, then after a while if I am working at home that day she will suddenly appear on the porch at 3:00 with tea and conversation. Should Kush and Nandana arrive home in their car during our teatime on the porch, she will rise and bow to them. I think about her a lot. People who have no business working as domestics are doing so, all because of one set of tests that they didn’t happen to pass. Sometimes in the afternoon I come home from work to find her, Velu, and Latha all assembled in Velu’s work area chatting in the midafternoon calm. I wonder if they are talking about my abject failure to master the art of curry eating. But no matter. I come in and say hello, but I do not stay. This is their space. My shared space with Velu is the plot of lawn in front of our house where the dogs “dance” (buranava), in Velu’s words, with each other at night. Here on this plot of earth, I learn the words for “moon”(handa), “stars” (taru), and “bad dog” (balla narakai). It is the leveler of all else that separates us.\n\nSome of my students at Peradeniya: (from left) Vihara, Tanya, Nirosha, and Sumudu.\n\nchapte r\n\n4\n\nInsurrections in the Hills\n\n“Calling you is like calling Gauguin,” someone told me who dialed my cell phone from the States and reached me while I was walking on a bridge over the Mahaweli River. It’s my place for birdsong, the place that drowns out all other conversation. I watch from the bridge and banks and listen as the deep, lazy waters of the Mahaweli make their slow journey to the northeast through this bird-dense land. I leave one flock behind and acquire another as I head into a classroom that seems to function as a bird corridor. We throw the windows open, erasing all the boundaries between outside and inside. Magpies, bee-eaters, and kingfishers fly in, then out again. Some pause to listen to my lecture briefly and then are gone. On rare occasions a monkey drops in and settles itself on the window ledge, a phenomenon that I initially find exotic and my students find merely irritating. Soon I start to find them irritating as well. Sometimes I suggest to the girls that we all just move outside and have class under the mara tree, a venerable two-hundred-year old giant that comes alive with a profusion of yellow blossoms for three days a year in March. Couples come and have their picture taken backlit by mara blossoms. “Yes, madam, as long as we don’t have to sit in the sun,” they tell me. I comply, and we make our way over to the stone benches under the tree and proceed to focus on the unlikely topic of American Puritanism in the Eden Ivor Jennings built. We weave in and out of the texts as the campus monkey population unobtrusively begins to descend on us from the top of the hill near the Senate building,\n\n33\n\n34\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nfanning out as they approach, moving in on us from several diƒerent directions until we look up to find ourselves surrounded. They are here for rice and curry. That we don’t have any seems not to have any noticeable eƒect on their insistence. Sometimes entire groups of students will vacate the benches under the tree as the monkeys assume squatters’ rights. Outside we often break a little early and just talk. It is here under the tree that I slowly become privy to the lives of my students. Tanya reveals that she is a concert pianist, and won’t I please come to her concert in Colombo? I find out here that Vihara is getting married soon, that Rozmin lost her father several years ago, that Kanchuka is an artist and that her father is a professor of philosophy here. Sumudu and Nirosha seem less forthcoming initially. I will wait to find out more about them. One day the six of them asked me if I knew that we were sitting on Polonnaruwa. “On what?” I asked, moving over, thinking I had inadvertently sat down on a bug. “Madam, we call it Polonnaruwa. It was one of our ancient, medieval capitals. It’s not so far from here, up north in the dry zone near Anuradhapura. The benches are like the stone pillars used in the medieval Sinhalese capital by that name. That’s why we call this place under the tree Polonnaruwa.” “We also call this place the strike tree,” Kanchuka added. “We say strike gaha. Rallies and strikes are called here. There was a famous one here. It was the food strike.” “Is the food that bad here?” I asked them. “In the States all college students complain about the food, but as far as I know no one has ever gone on strike over it.” “Well, madam, we weren’t here, but the students marched to the vice-chancellor’s o¤ce, carrying plates of string hoppers. Have you had string hoppers yet, madam?” (For the record, they are one of the staples of the Sri Lankan diet: rice flour and coconut milk are pushed through a sieve so that they emerge in the shape of noodles. They are then cooked and eaten with dhal or in a coconut and a chili dish called sambol). “Everyone thought the hoppers were too sticky,\n\nade le barke r\n\n35\n\nso they marched to the vice-chancellor’s o¤ce and threw them at the wall.” “Have the string hoppers gotten better?” I asked. “A little,” they told me, a couple of them screwing up their noses. “Have there been any other strikes here?” “Yes, madam, lots.” I was curious about them, but we were oƒ to the next class. Diƒerent class, same benches. One day I walked into class with the announcement that Lord Byron had a crush on the wife of Governor Horton, one of the governors of Kandy under the British. Smiles. Giggles. I had a feeling I’d just reinvented the wheel. I wasn’t sure anyone was interested in this, but I told the story anyway. “You all know the Udawattekele Sanctuary just behind the Temple of the Tooth and Trinity College?” “Madam, we know. This is the place where couples go.” I too had noticed them, sitting covered by their umbrellas on the thick stone benches that line the paths that disappear into the forest. “When I go there,” I told them, “it feels like I am turning back the pages of history. Those benches that the couples occupy today were built for the use of the young English girls of Kandy. They used to walk these paths and take their morning rides here during the British Raj.” “Yes, madam, we know.” Okay, I had reinvented the wheel. Walking in the forest I had found myself in the thick of the nineteenth-century British presence on the island. Along the deep jungle paths, from time to time, one comes upon small signs, pointing to Lady Gordon’s or Lady Horton’s Road, the mark of order and aristocracy in this otherwise completely wild forest zone. I have started to construct a life for these women. I imagine them more than a century and a half ago in crinolines, corsets, and high-necked collars, using their umbrellas as walking sticks. Victorian women, British women. I had stumbled\n\n36\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nupon a story in the Kandy Municipal Library that I was eager to share with the girls. It seems that Governor Horton, who served as governor of Kandy between 1831 and 1837, named the entire area Lady Horton’s Forest after his wife, who was known for her beauty. As she went for her morning walks along the paths, she was escorted by three soldiers, one fully armed, in case an elephant, leopard, elk, or wild boar made a sudden appearance. Governor Horton also happened to be Lord Byron’s second cousin. Byron was evidently not indiƒerent to his cousin’s wife’s charms, either. It was to her that he penned the lines: She walks in beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that’s best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes.\n\n“It’s one of Byron’s most famous poems,” I told my students, “and it seems to have originated right here.” “Have you read Leonard Woolf’s novel The Village in the Jungle?” my colleague Nihal asked me one day. “All the English students here are made to read it. You should have a go at it. He talks about this jungle of yours.” This comes as a complete shock to me. For me Woolf has always been the shadow behind Virginia. Founder with his wife of the Hogarth Press, he was a member of the Bloomsbury Group and was English literary aristocracy par excellence. But here on this island he is known for something very diƒerent. He spent time here, seven years to be exact, between 1904 and 1911, as a member of the Ceylon Civil Service. He learned Sinhalese and Tamil, as all o¤cials were required to, and kept the daily diaries that the British colonial government required of each of its o¤cials. He arrived by steamer in Colombo in 1904 with ninety volumes of Voltaire and a wirehaired fox terrier. After seven years he took a leave of absence to go home to England and subsequently resigned from the civil service, having become increasingly “doubtful whether I liked the prospect of spending my whole life as an imperialist ruling non-Europeans.”\n\nade le barke r\n\n37\n\nAs I read his diaries, I come to believe that even after he returned to his own roots—to the intellectual ferment of Bloomsbury, of Lytton Strachey, Virginia, Clive and Vanessa Bell—he left something essential of himself behind on this island. And that fundamental something propelled him back here after Ceylon had freed itself from the imperialism that Woolf came to abhor. I think that his passion for this place was something he never shared with Virginia. Fifty years later, twenty years after his wife committed suicide, he returned to Ceylon, a country free finally of the British. In the long intervening years, I think he never got the island out of his system. After Woolf came back to England in 1911, he set about writing the novel that Nihal wants me to read. It takes place in a village in the south and is about two young girls and their father, whose lives are turned upside down by the forces of change that threaten them from without. I lie in bed at night under my blue mosquito net with my pocket flashlight, reading it. It is a dark and mysterious book, something completely out of character for the Leonard Woolf I associate with Bloomsbury. I think he loved the mystery of the jungle, though for him there was also something ultimately horrifying about it, a rough mystery that lives according to its own laws and that ultimately reclaims and even swallows up its own. This jungle at the edge of our town has become a haven of solace for me. I take walks up there when I can, and am often struck by the fact that there is something in us, or perhaps something in the jungle itself, that makes me want to learn some abiding lesson about civilization and its obverse by looking at this mass of intricately tangled vegetation, vines, and dense growth. I recognize this impulse in myself while living on its edge, walking in it, thinking about it, and cutting it back. What would Jennings think, I often wonder, were he to come back to life and journey up the mountain to the university that he founded? There are the obvious diƒerences. I suspect that the place is a good deal shoddier than it was when it first opened its doors. The grounds are not kept up in quite the same way as I imagined they were in his time. There simply isn’t money to hire the full-time gardeners that the campus needs. The place seems slightly frayed at\n\n38\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nthe edges—a product, no doubt, of both the war and the economy. I notice, however, in the fall that there is a sudden burst of activity on campus, as gardeners, painters, and general cleanup people are out in force. Students finish their final examinations in March, but graduation, known here as convocation, takes place in the fall, except that it is not really fall because there is no fall. I don’t know what to call the changing times of year here. Nevertheless, I note that things are looking up in preparation for the general influx of student family members from all over the island. There have been other changes since Jennings’s time as well. A common litany of complaint around campus is that the new buildings have been thrown up in a hurry, destroying the architectural integrity of the earlier ones, all done in the style of medieval Anuradhapura architecture. They have no monopoly on architectural aberration, I tell them. Such things are common on campuses in the United States as well. Sometimes I walk around the university just to enjoy nature, being careful not to disturb the couples sitting discreetly under umbrellas by trees overlooking the river. I settle myself under a tree behind the Senate building at lunch and frequently take a nap if I can succeed in fending oƒ the local monkey population. Often I eat lunch or take a walk with my colleague Udaya Meddegama, who is head of the Department of Sinhalese. Udaya appeared in my life my first day at the university in response to an e-mail I had sent to the department inquiring whether there was someone available to tutor me in Sinhalese. Short, mild-mannered, and to all appearances massively overworked, Udaya has been here forever and has seen a great deal. I was sitting at my desk trying to organize my thoughts when he walked in, smiled at me, and proceeded to utter something incomprehensible in Sinhalese. He then switched into beautifully rhythmic English, the product of several years spent in the States and in England, and announced that he was here to initiate me into the mysteries of this language. From then on, twice or three times a week we have met in whatever classroom happens to be available at the moment. Before long I am piecing together the days of the week, the weather, fruits. But mainly what Udaya is teaching me is the culture. “What is the word for ‘elephant’?” I asked him one day, hav-\n\nade le barke r\n\n39\n\ning encountered one coming in the opposite direction earlier that morning in Kandy. “What kind of elephant?” he asked me. “I don’t know. Your plain generic elephant. You know, the big kind.” I looked at him with a half smile. He took it all in stride. “We have three words for elephants. Aliya is our general name for male and female elephants. Then eta are the tuskers; they’re always male. And etinna are the females.” I stared at him in linguistic despair. This is the direction in which our language classes usually proceed. First I learn the words, then I learn the stories that give me the culture. After I get etinna into my head, I learn that the mother of the Buddha was impregnated through her womb by a white elephant; that Buddha in his former lives had been born as an elephant; that his rival Mana, the God of Death, rides a monstrous tusker called Girimekhala; and that parents come to the temple in our town specifically to pass their children under the bellies of the temple elephants, an act designed to ensure the child’s future protection in life. While Udaya is explaining I am thinking to myself that now I understand why I hear small children screaming at all hours of the day in front of the Temple of the Tooth. All in a day’s work in Sinhalese class. One day Udaya arrived and wrote something new on the board, two words: chanda kolebala. “Learn it,” he said. “It means ‘election violence.’ ” “Why are you teaching me this?” I asked him. “I am supposed to be learning how to shop and cook. I’m going to starve with all these abstractions.” “You are learning it because we are coming up to an election, and this will be part of your life. It is almost as normal as shopping and cooking.” The civil war between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil Tiger rebels on this island had already been raging since 1983, although the roots of the conflict can be traced back to the 1950s. It had claimed forty thousand lives by the time we arrived. But there was another war, one referred to by Sri Lankans as the insurrections, that went\n\n40\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nvirtually unreported in the Western press. It has two histories: one in 1971, when the student violence began, and the other in the mid1980s, as the economy continued to worsen and as many of the activists arrested in the early 1970s had now been released. By the 1980s the country also found itself engaged in a civil war. The insurrections were a product of a political party called the JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), which infiltrated the campus and garnered both student and faculty support for its eƒorts to topple both the government and the hierarchy of privilege in this country. I have yet to meet a family on campus that has not been in some way aƒected by these uprisings. I sit in the senior commons room in the Fine Arts Building drinking my milk tea (kiri te) and surrounded by faculty members, some of them elderly, who sip their tea with their news. Some are quiet old men with paunches who, I learn only after a year, were either deeply implicated in or victimized by the violence. Either way, for them it is now a thing of the past. What happened on this campus in 1971 and then again in the late 1980s in some fundamental sense informs much of our life here for the next year. It explains things that otherwise have no explanation. Some people who were around in the early 1970s when the violence first broke out have died; others choose not to talk about what happened or even to remember it; still others took meticulous notes so as never to forget it. For everyone these are two decades of di¤cult memories. Ashley Halpé and his wife, Brigit, live in the hills of Aniwatta (literally Annie’s Garden) up over the town of Kandy. Recently retired from Peradeniya, Ashley is a scholar of Renaissance literature. He is also a poet and, I have heard from colleagues, was asked to take over discipline at the university during the insurrections. I called him to see if he would talk to me, as I wanted to start putting the pieces of what happened together. I drove up with Champika one day into the hills where the Halpés live. Usually lively and often full of song, Champika seemed preoccupied that day. The problem for him is always the same: money. He is in his late twenties and supports his mother, father, grandmother, aunt, and sister on the salary of a tuktuk driver. On a good day driving his tuk-tuk he brings in maybe 1,000 rupees ($10.00). That’s on a good day. These things fluctuate\n\nade le barke r\n\n41\n\nwildly, though. He could just as well bring in 300 rupees ($3.00) a day, depending on business. I prodded him to talk a little bit as we sat at the top of the hill overlooking the town. Today the story centered on his younger sister, who is still in high school and getting ready to take her British A levels, the examinations that are key to gaining admission to a university. Champika was having to pay for a special course she was taking to prepare for it, and it was expensive. “First person in family for university,” he told me proudly, referring to his sister’s prospects. Even then it was not completely clear that she would get in. These O and A levels have done nothing for this society. The O levels are standardized tests given to all pupils in the equivalent of the tenth grade. Much money and sleep are lost over these tests. The kids need to be able to pass six O-level subjects, including math and one of the languages (Sinhalese, Tamil, or English). Students may take the O levels over o¤cially only three times. After that, even if they pass, they can’t proceed on to the A levels. A colleague of mine at Peradeniya was railing against the Kandy police the other day over some matter. “Even these people,” he said, “who in general don’t use their brains, if they have any at all, had to pass their O levels.” He went on to try and explain the system to me. “These kids who do not get through the O levels get stuck in life. They can go to vocational training centers, I guess. Most of them end up as car mechanics, farmers, carpenters, or as politicians. You don’t have to have any brains to end up as a politician in this country. But there’s another thing. Say you have no brains, but your family has money. You can’t get through your O levels. I know of families who send their kids to Russia and to the U.S. for the rest of their education. Here money will buy you what you need. Brains, not always.” Noah is currently studying for his O levels, the only problem being that he will no longer be in the country when the tests are given next year. “Why am I studying the municipal planning of a British town?” is a question he voices repeatedly around the house. I shrug my shoulders, registering the lament. But the real problems for students begin when they have to take their A levels, the significantly more di¤cult exams given after the senior year in high school. On these all depends: entrance into university, whether here or abroad.\n\n42\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nIf one passes them, all is well and good. If not, one can retake them after a year, but if the student fails to pass the second time, that is it. No more A levels and no possibility of entering the university. In general, one is consigned to whatever lower- or middle-level job one can get. It is a system I rail against from the beginning of our life here until I leave the island for the second time in 2007. Too much depends on this one set of examinations. Further, it keeps the social structure in place since, for the most part, students who pass the A levels come from more privileged backgrounds, have attended the international or private schools, which give better preparation, and have had private tutoring in order to help them with the exams. There are, of course, exceptions, but not enough to justify the system. “Going and coming?” Champika asked me, depositing me at Ashley’s gate. “No, just going,” I told him. I wanted to walk back, but I gave him some money for the return trip. I walked up to Ashley’s house, thinking about how poverty gets recycled in this country and how slim the prospects are of breaking out of it. I was greeted by a group of happy, well-cared-for dogs, a rarity here, who escorted me inside the house—most of which was, in fact, outside. It was a place open to breezes, which drifted in, mingling with the sounds of Brigit’s piano students and the soft pattering of dog feet on the floor. The living room of the house, graced with stunning paintings by Sri Lankan artists, opened out onto a deck that was not quite finished yet. Ashley came to greet me and cautioned me to be careful where I step lest I fall oƒ the edge into the garden ten feet below. Surrounded by his dogs, we drank tea, as Ashley settled into his memories of the insurrections. “You know, in order to understand what happened at Peradeniya in the early 1970s, you have to understand what this place was and what it represented to the first batch of students who attended it in the 1950s,” he told me. “The first students to study here moved into campus in the 1950s when Sri Lanka was still Ceylon but newly independent from the British Raj. By and large they came from the Sinhalese elite. Most were from wealthy and privileged families in Colombo, families with last names that even today have instant\n\nade le barke r\n\n43\n\nrecognition on the island. These were halcyon times. The students studied the classics, read with professors who had studied at Oxford and Cambridge, took part in university games, got drunk at the local Kandy bars and, when the Arts Faculty shifted up the road from Colombo, began reading the works of Marx and Engels.” Ashley went on to tell me that in the early years the student protests didn’t amount to much. He remembered one that had something to do with substandard laundry facilities. Then there was another one on campus connected with a stench due to the breakdown of the university water system. I reminded him of the string hopper strike as well. But aside from that, Ashley continued, even as the students read their Marx, they were less impressed by what he had to say than they were by the fact that recent grads had found lucrative employment in the capital and had money jingling in their pockets. I have thought about that so often. At home when I teach Marx, my students and I talk about whether it is possible to really understand Marx if your belly is full and you are bringing in $80,000 a year. Does Marxism die, I wonder, when our pockets are full? “By the late 1960s, “Ashley continued, “things were beginning to change. Namely, what was changing was the student body. Formerly from privileged circles, the entering students now were coming increasingly from rural areas and from a more impoverished background. This is important; you need to understand this. Not all who entered knew English anymore. You see, the language reform after Ceylon’s independence now allowed for secondary school instruction to be conducted in Sinhalese and Tamil as well as in English. The university ranks began to swell. Now we had a very diƒerent kind of student—less worldly. Some people felt that the university was losing its hold on providing an elite education for the crème de la crème of Sinhalese society and had nothing to gain from admitting students from the rural areas. Two things coalesced at this moment—the influx of new and a very diƒerent breed of student and an economy that was taking a downturn. The students from the poorer, rural families graduated after four years at university, looked around them and saw that, for all their education, they were unable to get jobs. But the sons of the elite who had attended private school\n\n44\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\neither at St. Thomas or Royal College in Colombo or Trinity in Kandy, because of their connections, were virtually guaranteed a job in the private sector if they could make it through grade eight. This is the moment when the Marxists and Trotskyites found an audience on campus. “So, that’s basically the background. Then there was the reality of what happened on campus. One night a bomb went oƒ in one of the dormitories, Maars Hall. Some people think that the bomb was planted there by the army or the government as a way of giving themselves carte blanche to come in and search the campus. No one knows, but the army moved in swiftly and defanged the entire campus. The student radicals moved up into the hills of the Hantana, and the Peradeniya police superintendent declared that he would give safe conduct to anyone who wanted to leave the campus for Colombo.” Hours later, both of us sated by the stories, Ashley and I sat there and drank our tea. The dogs had settled in and were asleep at our feet. “You’re a writer. Did you write about this?” I asked him. “Yes, I did. I wrote poems. Sometimes it was all I could do.” Days later I found some of Ashley’s poems in the university ­library. april 1971 I do not know The thin reek of blood, the stench of seared flesh, the cracked irreducible bone; I know only the thinner reek of pity, the harsh edge of self-contempt, the ashy guilt of being too old, salaried, safe, and comfortable. I would know their reasons, The rigour of their hot hate, their Terrifying faith. But They have said everything In dying, a communication Beyond all our speech.\n\nade le barke r\n\n45\n\nWhat happened in Sri Lanka in the early 1970s and again in the mid-1980s is inseparable from the personality of one man, Patabandi Don Nandasiri Wijeweera, alias Rohana Wijeweera, the force behind the JVP. Wijeweera was born in 1943 in a small seacoast town in southern Sri Lanka. His father had been attracted to Marxist and Leninist ideology and passed on his radical leanings to his young son. As important as his father’s influence was on him, Wijeweera’s most defining moment was the time he spent at Patrice Lumumba People’s Friendship University in Moscow. I remember this university from my own student days at Moscow State University in the 1970s. Patrice Lumumba University had been established for international students from developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that were being courted by the Soviets. I used to see students, particularly from Mali, all over Moscow, suƒering from the cold and from deep racism in the land of the socialist brotherhood. The students received their education for free but paid dearly for it in other ways. And they were homesick. This was also a time of the ongoing Sino-Soviet ideological conflict, one in which Wijeweera took the Chinese side in the debate, not a popular stance those days in Moscow. He came back to Sri Lanka for health reasons in 1963, hoping to go back to Moscow the next year to complete his studies. But when he applied for a visa, the Soviet Consulate turned him down. His years in Moscow and the social and economic conditions in his own country had already left their mark on him. With the help of like-minded Marxists, Wijeweera became one of the founding members of the JVP in the late 1960s. Not initially a political party, the JVP operated both in the open and underground. As a legitimate enterprise, it organized educational camps focusing on Marxist philosophy and economics. By 1971 there were over one hundred thousand members a¤liated with the group, mainly workers, monks from the villages, students, and university staƒ. Their goal was nothing less than the freeing of Sri Lankan workers from centuries of exploitation, first by foreign powers under colonial rule and now by the elite of Sri Lanka itself. Wijeweera quickly assumed leadership of the organization and ran it literally like a boot camp. He ordered his followers not to smoke,\n\n46\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\ndrink, or fall in love, reasoning that if people couldn’t obey these simple injunctions, they would never be able to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the revolution. Oddly, his tactics sounded very like those employed later by Prabhakaran and the LTTE. Wijeweera went straight to the heart of popular discontent on the island. He promised the people that under a government formed by the JVP, all Sri Lankans would have equal access to education. He promised to nationalize the gem industry and announced that the JVP had no intention of ever paying back the money loaned to Sri Lanka by the World Bank. The blue beret that was his trademark gave him more than a passing resemblance to Che Guevara. At a Colombo press conference, a journalist once asked him why he wore the beret. Wijeweera answered by asking the man if he had ever asked Mrs. Bandaranaike (then president and mother of former president Chandrika Kumaratunga) why she carried a purse. Part of Wijeweera’s popularity stemmed from his own class roots. He was also a gifted orator. He knew how to speak to Sri Lanka’s rural youth because they were his people. He was the first Sri Lankan politician to come from a poor family with little education, and was the first to stand up to the wealthy elite ruling the country. His popularity was not hard to fathom. He walked the length and breadth of the island, preaching his gospel, often without food or shoes. The persona he created for himself clearly echoed Buddhist and Christian philosophy. But here any similarity between the three ends; the dharma Wijeweera was preaching was violence. He felt that the only way to resolve social and economic disparity in this country was through revolution. And revolution meant violence. By the end of the 1960s, the JVP had begun arming itself. Camps were set up to train cadres in the use of bayonets and rifles. The initial organizers gave lectures on martial arts and on terrorist successes in other countries in South and Southeast Asia. And they were able to recruit several military figures who taught them how to make bombs and firearms. By April 1970, Wijeweera was a wanted man. In March of 1971, he was arrested yet, Mafia-like, continued to direct the JVP from his prison cell in Jaƒna. On April 5, over one hundred police stations\n\nade le barke r\n\n47\n\nthroughout the country were attacked or threatened by the JVP, which had put together an abortive rescue mission of five hundred men whose purpose it was to storm the Jaƒna prison and free Wijeweera. By week’s end, a total of 16,500 JVP suspects had either been arrested or had surrendered to the authorities. Several thousand more had died in the violence. The spate of violence on campus was bad during the first insurrection in 1971, but gut-wrenching during the second wave in the late 1980s. This time it was more drawn out, most likely because the intervening years had brought no perceptible change in people’s social and economic conditions. Tempers in the late 1980s, already at their breaking point, were pushed over the edge by the fact that the country was now in the midst of a civil war that had dealt a blow to the economy. The poor again found themselves in desperate conditions, and the student population at Peradeniya was again infiltrated by the ranks of the JVP. In 1987 my colleague Nihal Fernando was teaching in the English department at Peradeniya. He gathered his things together as he always did in the morning and set oƒ for work on his bike. His route took him across the Mahaweli River at what I call the birdsong bridge. It was a morning like most. “I always used to come to work across that bridge, and I would see piles of corpses stacked near one end of it. By the next morning that pile had been taken away, and a new pile had appeared in its place. I would look down, and on the waters below there were bodies floating, heading downstream along with random branches or lost pieces of laundry. It seemed like something was always burning at that time—tires, bodies, jeeps. One of the ways bodies were disposed of during the late 1980s was something that was known as tire-pyre. People would get old tires, put bodies inside them and burn them. There were incidents all over campus.” Udaya was here then, too. One day the two of us had taken a walk during lunch before our daily tutoring session, and he had shown me a roundabout on campus called the Alwis Circle erected in memory of the original architect of the campus, Shirley Alwis. In its center sits a classical vase painted pink and white, a tribute to\n\n48\n\nnot qu i te parad i se\n\nanother era and to the intention and design of those who brought this place into being. “See this circle.” He pointed. On a sunny morning in 1987 he had put his two smallest children—Indu and Achala—on the bus for school. They were living in one of the university bungalows at the time, not far from the main campus. “Indu told me that as the bus approached the circle, she looked out of the window and saw little flowerpots hanging on it. She kept looking at them. Probably she wasn’t used to seeing flowerpots there. Gradually she realized they were the decapitated heads of students, thirteen of them, hanging from the fountain. The teacher on board pushed all the children to the floor so that they wouldn’t have to see. But they saw.” “Even the monks had been the target of violence,” Udaya had told me. “A monk in a village not far from here was misidentified. The authorities mistook him for another monk. So they dragged him from a procession and shoved him into a jeep. They took him to a cemetery at the far end of the village and hanged him from a tree. Then the police found the victim’s family and set fire to the house where they were living. There was the story of another monk who was forced to jump into an abandoned lavatory pit where he was ordered to look for bombs. He didn’t find anything there that could be a weapon and so the police took him out of the pit and tied him to a tree in the temple yard and left. The monk’s students untied him and washed him, but the monk could not face society after the humiliating ordeal. After a few days he committed suicide.” Nihal remembers going to his family’s land about fifty kilometers north of here. “I passed a body burning and a woman and child crying by the side of the road. There were bodies on the road in completely unrecognizable conditions. One morning, in fact, I was taking my daughter to school on my bike. We passed piles of bodies with their stomachs ripped out. My daughter didn’t even recognize the bodies as human, and so in a sense she wasn’t really bothered. “These were impossible times. I remember that the students found two people whom they suspected of being army spies. They tied them to trees in broad daylight and stoned them to death. Some people say it was just the JVP, some say the military, but it wasn’t. There was violence on both sides.”\n\nade le barke r\n\n49\n\nIt was nearly dark when I arrived home from Ashley’s. Velu met me at the gate and repeated slowly so that I could understand, “Chanda kolebala.” I nodded. Together we listened. In the distance I could hear something that sounded like soft popping, almost like firecrackers from a mile or two away. Kush came down. “Firecrackers?” I asked. “No, grenades,” she said. But the election was still days away. “It starts early,” she told me. Noah and Nandana would be back soon from their evening walk in the panther forest, and we would all be in for the duration behind our hedge. I changed into my housedress, and Kush and I puttered about while the last light of dusk held. Later that night Noah and I ate the curry that Loku Menike had made for us. I went to bed early, taking care to tuck the ends of the mosquito netting in tightly at the corners of my bed. I wrote in my journal and wrapped myself in the comfort of evening ritual as the preelection grenades drowned out the sound of the last of the buses circling around Kandy for the night.\n\nAruni, Udaya, Indu, and Achala Meddegama with puppy.\n\nchapte r\n\n5\n\nHot Curry\n\n“Do you have a garlic press to do this with?” I asked Udaya as he, his wife, Aruni, and I set about chopping and preparing the curry in their kitchen for the ev"
