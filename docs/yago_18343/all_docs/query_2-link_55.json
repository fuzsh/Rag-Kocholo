        "text": "This study throws light on the importance of adjustment lags, variability of inflation, changes in real income, etc. in the empirical estimation of Fisher hypothesis. Variability of inflation has a significant negative impact on both short-and long-term interest rates in a developing economy like India. The 'Philips Curve Effect' has not been operative in a developing country.\n\nThis study examines the Fisher&#39;s hypothesis by utilizing the dataset on India&#39;s macroeconomic variables with the objective to check whether long-run empirical relationship between the nominal interest rate and inflation expectation exists. To this end, study is conducted on monthly data from Jan-1993 to Mar-2015 by utilizing the autoregressive distributed lag model or bounds testing approach developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001). The bounds testing is applied to analyze the co-integration and short-and long-run relationship among variables, for a different combination of the Fisher hypothesis. The present study concludes the existence of a long-run relationship between Treasury bill and expected inflation (estimated by WPI), with a long-run coefficient equal to 0.54, implying partial Fisher effect. While the long-run relationship does not exist between Treasury bill and expected inflation (estimated by CPI). Similarly, long-run relationship although not of one to one ...\n\nThis paper is an attempt to trace the relationship between interest rates and rates of inflation in the economy of Bangladesh. In view of this, a time series approach is considered to examine the empirical evidence of Fisherâ€™s effect in the country. By applying OLS and Unit Root test, the estimated value is used to determine the casual relationship between interest rates and inflation for the monthly sample period of August 1996 to December 2003. The empirical results suggest that there does not exist any co-movement of inflation with interest rates and the relationship between the variables is also not significant for Bangladesh. Further, the trends advocate that the inflation premium, equal to expected inflation that investors add to real-risk free rate of return, is ineffective in the country.
