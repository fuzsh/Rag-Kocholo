        "text": "Blog Archives\n\nGurudeva’s Statement — Attack on America\n\nAround the world more and more news services are reporting on Gurudeva’s passage. Here is a link to a recent report from the Los Angeles Times.\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/\n\nAlso Gurudeva’s sishya around the world continue to commune with him deeply from within. Here is a beautiful testimony from one of Gurudeva sishya in Mauritius:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nProstrations to the lotus Feet of out SatGuru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami of\n\nThe Nandi Natha Sampradaya of The Kailasa Paramparai\n\nSishya ———– transmitting from Mauritius. Half past noon Mauritius time.I t is really beyond words to describe the act of Satguru Bodhinathaswami carying the ashes of our SatGuru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami in tne cave behind Kadavul. Jai. Our Gurudeva is closer to us all nearer than breath than ever. He is the SUN. We are all blessed to work with Him and be under His Umbrella for the future, future and future centuries. He is the life of my life and I will always remain Eternal to my Gurudeva. AUM.\n\nSince Thursday last (Mauritius time) and every morning I am performing a special puja to Gurudeva. I ring the bell after placing a new soumboo full of fresh water on the shrine tablet. I lit a sandalwood and simultaneously call the Nandi Natha Sampradaya of the Kailasa Paramparai. I then place a slightly opened white rose flower bud for paramaguru SivaYogaswami and another white rose flower for Gurudeva in front of his picture. AUM. (continued below)\n\nNo Audio Today\n\nBe surprised!\n\nTake this opportunity for an adventure.\n\nClose your eyes and click to get a message\n\npicked at random from Gurudeva’s vast audio archives\n\nToday our Sun One Homa was a powerful one. Satguru Bodhinathaswami presided.\n\nOur testimony from Mauritius continues:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n“I then lit some sambrani providing scent and perfume. I cut a beautiful banana the same way sadhaka Jothi does into two parts and places same at the feet of Gurudeva. A small piece of saffron is then placed for SivaYogaswami and I take another piece to rub Gurudeva feet and toes.It takes some time for the saffron exercise whilst I sing consistently GURUNATHA.”\n\nTestimony to Gurudeva continued:\n\n“Proceeding ahead, I then take some honey and places same on his Majestic beard. I take my time to shower the honey whilst I now sing mangalam jaya mangalam . I place the saffron piece on the banana and aswell some honey on the banana.Finally, I take yellow flowers ,take their petals and shower same on Gurudeva`s Head, heart, Torso and Feet. I start again with beautiful white flowers petals and sing in honor of our SatGuru SivayaSubramuniyaswami. All the petals have now covered the oval crystal placed at Gurudeva`s Feet.The said crystal was given to me by our church years ago.I feel the presece of the Master ever than before. Jai. I then take the sandalwood for a final arthi and sing Gurunatha. I prostrate at Gurudeva Feet and I pray. AUM NAMASIVAYA. I finally meditate a bit and read Merging with Siva and living with Siva. aum. GURUDEVA IS THE LIFE OF ALL THE SISHYAS. He is the SUN and is LIGHT effulgence. AUM.”\n\nI will now end. AUM.\n\nSatguru Bodhinathaswami gave a 40-minute, powerful, articulate discourse today… and we will be sharing this with you as audio in the days ahead.\n\nWe also had a wonderful family join us today. In the foreground, from Massachusetts on the left is Mr. Kailasapillai Aravinthan and on the right is his wife, Mrs. Yasodara Aravinthan, and their three children, Master. Ashwinikumar Aravinthan (7 years), Miss. Suhasini Aravinthan (5 years) and Master. Guruguhan Aravinthan (3 years). In the back, from Sri Lanka are Mr. Viswanathar Kailasapillai (Aravinthan’s father)\n\nMrs. Abiramipillai Kailasapillai (Aravinthan’s mother)\n\nMiss. Sivamalar Subramaniam (Aravinthan’s aunt) and Mrs. Arunthathi Selliah (Aravinthan’ sister). Though the elder Kailasapillai is retired, he is a very active man. He is someone who doesn’t just “talk” but actually gets things done.\n\nHere they meet with Bodhinatha. The entire family has set up an elder home in Sri Lanka and it has a fund in the Hindu Heritage Endowment. Please visit their web site at: http://www.Manithaneyam.org/ trust.\n\nAnd you may help to support this organization in perpetuity by make a donation to fund #47 of the Hindu Heritage Endowment, go to:\n\nhttp://www.hheonline.org/endowments.html\n\nWe back track now to the last day of ceremonies when Gurudeva’s ashes were interred. Here on the left in the blue urn are Gurudeva’s ashes which were kept overnight with the icon of Siva Yogaswami.\n\nAfter the powerful Ekadasa Kumbha Puja, Satguru Bodhinathaswami took the ashes and was followed by all the swamis to the special meditation cave.\n\nDeep in the ground, behind the Siva Nataraja temple is a “secret” crypt… all the swamis followed Bodhinatha down into the chamber, and Gurudeva’s urn was put into a small vault in the wall. Thus completed the process of Gurudeva’s passage as he now dances in the inner worlds, free at last!\n\nGurudeva’s spiritual center in the island country of Mauritius\n\nin the Indian Ocean near South Africa\n\nWhile many devotees the world over were not able to come to Kauai, they joined in spirit and service with the passage of Gurudeva through wonderful celebrations. Here we have a report from the sishya of Saiva Siddhanta Church in Mauritius:\n\nEarly in the morning Gurudeva’s sishyas turned up at the Saiva Dharmasala to finalise all preparations for the Mritunjaya ceremony which was to coincide with the cremation ceremonies on Kauai. The ladies are here happily weaving garlands while singing beautiful Natchintanai.\n\nThe ceremony started with a nice procession from the Dharmasala’s Shrine to a special Guru Shrine which was beautifully set up in the tent. It was nicely decorated with Toranums and fresh flower hangings. The men are here bringing Gurudeva’s Tiruvadi on which pada puja has been conducted every evening by the Guru’s devoted sishyas of the island.\n\nOnce in the tent, everyone present chanted to his heart’s delight the 108 names of Gurudeva while Brahmachari Vel Mahalingum assisted by two other sishyas, was gracefully offering flowers on the Holy Sandals of Gurudeva.\n\nAt exactly the same time when the cremation was going on in Kauai, the devotees in Mauritius chanted the Mritunjaya Mantra uninterrupted, for a very long time….\n\nOm Tryambakam Yajaamahe\n\nSugandhim Pushti Vardhanam\n\nUrvaaru Kameeva Bandhanaat\n\nMrityoor Muksheeya Maamrutaat\n\nWe worship the three-eyed Lord Siva,\n\nWho is full of fragrance\n\nAnd who nourishes all beings.\n\nMay He liberate us from Death,\n\nEven as the gourd is released from its vine,\n\nBut not from immortality!\n\nThere was a charged spiritual vibration when all those present chanted with bhakti the mritunjaya mantra. Prior to this devotees present at the ceremony, were asked to mentally see themselves in Kauai and to meditate on the Light Form of the Guru."
