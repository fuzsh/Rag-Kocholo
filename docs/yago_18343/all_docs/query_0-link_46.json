        "text": "Shenali D Waduge\n\nMaaveerar Naal or Great Heroes Day has been commemorated since 27 November 1989 with a Heroes Week held annually from 21stending 26thNovember (Prabakaran’s birthday). It is a LTTE event to remember every LTTE combatant killed. While the LTTE propagandists shed crocodile tears to the world that the GoSL denies them to commemorate dead Tamils, what these LTTE propagandists do not disclose is that they FORBID Tamils from commemorating Tamils killed by LTTE & this is a long list. Ironically, some clueless foreign politicians attend these LTTE commemorations & probably some have already accepted invitations for 2021 events. But, what everyone conveniently ignores is that the Mahaveerar Naal ceremonies do not shed a tear for the likes of Alfred Duraiappah, Lakshman Kadiragamar, Sarojini Yogeswaran or even the leaders of the other Tamil militant groups that LTTE killed to reign supreme. If Prabakaran & LTTE had an objective to create an Eelam for Tamils – why kill their own people including leaders of other Tamil militant groups fighting for the same cause?\n\nMaaveerar Naal is to only commemorate LTTE dead\n\nMaaveerar Naal is NOT TO commemorate Tamil civilians, Tamil politicians, Tamil academics, Tamil public servants, Tamil clergy, Tamil children or even Tamil combatants who were all killed by LTTE.\n\nWhat do we call event to commemorate these Tamils?\n\nLTTE’s first victim was a Tamil – Mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappahshot dead after stepping out of the kovil on 27 July 1975\n\nLTTE’s second victims were also Tamils – scores of Tamil policemen making Tamils too scared to join the police & the LTTE propagandists twisted this to claim the government was not recruiting Tamils to the police!\n\nM CanagaratnamTamil United Liberation Front’s candidate for Pottuvilshot outside his home in Kollupitiya, Colombo on 24 January 1978 & died of his injuries on 20 April 1980\n\nC E Anandarajah– Principal of St. Johns College Jaffna.

LTTE killed 7 members of EPRLF\n\nhttps://noolaham.net/project/34/3336/3336.pdf\n\nGopalswamy Mahendraraja (Mahaththaya) Deputy Leader of LTTE executed by Prabakaranon 28 December 1994for being an informant to India’s intelligence.\n\nChelvy Thiyagarajah– Journalist, she won the International Pen Award in 1992.

We witnessed this in the manner some Tamils during the last phase were better fed than the rest of the Tamils.\n\nThe Maaveerar Naal commemorations are naturally held overseas as well – it is another income generator and a camouflage to fool the gullible international community. The LTTE diaspora lighting candles and holding commemorations are all LTTE runaway families – probably missing & disappeared are amongst them with new names & identities.\n\nWhile these commemorations are held with pomp & pageant – the families of those killed by LTTE can only mourn their dead in private inside their homes. No public ceremonies are allowed by LTTE for them.\n\nHow can we forget the LTTE combatants killed by LTTE – children, women, men? How many did LTTE kill? Are their deaths credited to the Sri Lanka Army? During the last phase scores of injured LTTE combatants were put into buses and set fire. Many Tamils living overseas were killed for not towing LTTE line. Some continue to be threatened still.\n\nSo who is Wigneswaran & TNA actually fooling by attending these LTTE Heroes Day commemorations? Decorations are in LTTE colours (red & yellow), LTTE flag is hoisted, Eelam Map is displayed, garland for 1stLTTE hero Shankar is a dead giveaway (pun intended)\n\nHow do the families of these people who were slain by LTTE commemorate their dead?\n\nWhat is that event called?"
