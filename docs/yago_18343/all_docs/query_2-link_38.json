        "text": "Home / Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences, Volume 39, Number 3\n\nAuthors: Mohamed Aslam, Ahamed Lebbe 1 ; Sivarajasingham, Selliah 2 ;\n\nSource: Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences, Volume 39, Number 3, 2021, pp. 687-708(22)\n\nPublisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1108/JEAS-11-2020-0183\n\nAbstract\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSupplementary Data\n\nPurpose\n\nThis study investigates the long-run relationship between workers' remittances and human capital formation in Sri Lanka by using the macro-level time series data during the period of 1975–2020.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nIn this study, the augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Philips–Perron (PP) unit root tests, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds cointegration technique, the Granger causality test, the forecast error variance decomposition technique and impulse response function analysis were employed as the analytical techniques.\n\nFindings\n\nIn accordance with the results of unit root tests, the variables used in this study are mixed order. Results of cointegration confirm that workers' remittances in Sri Lanka have both long-run and short-run beneficial relationship with human capital formation. The Granger causality test results indicate that there is a two-way causal relationship between workers' remittances and human capital formation. The results of forecast error variance decomposition expose that innovation of workers' remittances contributes to the forecast error variance in human capital in bell shape. Further, the empirical evidence of impulse response function analysis reveals that a positive standard deviation shock to workers' remittances has an immediate significant positive impact on human capital formation in Sri Lanka for a period of up to ten years.\n\nPractical implications\n\nThis research provides insights into the workers' remittances in human capital formation in Sri Lanka. The findings of this study provides evidence that workers' remittances help to produce human capital formation.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nBy using the ARDL Bounds cointegration and other techniques in Sri Lanka, this study fills an important gap in academic literature.\n\nNo Reference information available - sign in for access.\n\nNo Citation information available - sign in for access.\n\nNo Supplementary Data.\n\nNo Article Media\n\nNo Metrics\n\nKeywords: Cointegration test; Forecast error variance decomposition test; Granger causality test; Human capital formation; Impulse response function analysis; Workers' remittances\n\nDocument Type: Research Article\n\nAffiliations: 1: Department of Divisional Planning, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka 2: Department of Economics and Statistics, Faculty of Arts, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka\n\nPublication date: 26 July 2021\n\nShare Content\n\nAccess Key\n\nFree content\n\nPartial Free content\n\nNew content\n\nOpen access content\n\nPartial Open access content\n\nSubscribed content\n\nPartial Subscribed content\n\nFree trial content"
