        "text": "Home / International Journal of Social Economics, Volume 47, Number 11\n\nAuthors: Mohamed Aslam, Ahamed Lebbe 1 ; Sivarajasingham, Selliah 2 ;\n\nSource: International Journal of Social Economics, Volume 47, Number 11, 2020, pp. 1381-1402(22)\n\nPublisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1108/IJSE-03-2020-0157\n\nAbstract\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSupplementary Data\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this study aims to investigate the nature of the relationship between workers' remittances and financial development (FD) in Sri Lanka for the period from 1975 to 2017.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThis study used both the exploratory data analysis and inferential data analysis (IDA) techniques to test the objective of this study. The IDA technique consisted of the augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron unit root tests, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds cointegration technique, the Granger causality test and impulse response function analysis.\n\nFindings\n\nThe unit root test results show that the variables are in mixed order. The empirical results of cointegration confirm that workers' remittances have a beneficial long-run relationship with FD in Sri Lanka. The Granger causality test result indicates that there is a bidirectional relationship between workers' remittances and FD. The impulse response analysis indicates that a positive shock to workers' remittance has an immediate significant positive impact on the FD of up to 10 years.\n\nPractical implications\n\nThe analytical techniques used in this study explain how workers' remittances induce FD in Sri Lanka.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThis study fills an important gap in the academic literature by using newly developed ARDL bounds cointegration techniques in Sri Lanka, by using impulse response function analysis, and by studying the dynamic relationship between workers' remittances and FD using time series data.\n\nNo Reference information available - sign in for access.\n\nNo Citation information available - sign in for access.\n\nNo Supplementary Data.\n\nNo Article Media\n\nNo Metrics\n\nKeywords: ARDL bounds test; Financial development; Granger causality; Impulse response function; Workers' remittances\n\nDocument Type: Research Article\n\nAffiliations: 1: Department of Divisional Planning, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka 2: Department of Economics and Statistics, Faculty of Arts, University of Peradeniya, Kandy, Sri Lanka\n\nPublication date: 06 October 2020\n\nShare Content\n\nAccess Key\n\nFree content\n\nPartial Free content\n\nNew content\n\nOpen access content\n\nPartial Open access content\n\nSubscribed content\n\nPartial Subscribed content\n\nFree trial content"
