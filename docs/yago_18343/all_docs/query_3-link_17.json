When coercion or repression, rather than popular consensus, becomes the chief means of holding the society together, it is then on the threshold of its disintegration.\n\nA living society is one that constantly renews itself. The means of that renewal is the creativity of the young. The exercise of that creativity requires freedom - the freedom of idealistic youth to pose the necessary moral questions concerning our direction and to demand change so as to check both injustice and oppression.\n\nIn both the North-East and South of this country, the minds and the spirit of the young are essentially unwanted. That is recent history which touches both our economics and politics, and the swelling of the most destructive of all institutions - the various armed forces.\n\nThe Tamil struggle too began in the 70s and 80s with hundreds of young asking questions, and demanding and working for a more moral order. In the Broken Palmyrah and in the previous reports, we have dealt with how the rise of an increasingly intolerant Tamil nationalist ideology ended all that. Starting with the parliamentary TULF many other groups have contributed towards this tragedy. With the oppressive Sri Lankan state on one side which seems determined not to offer the Tamils the possibility of a just alternative, the Tamils themselves would appear to be caught in an embrace of death with the LTTE.\n\nBeing concerned also with the internal and moral aspect of the working of our society we have thought it no less important to expose violations by Tamil actors themselves, and in particular the LTTE leadership - still the most important of all current actors. To put it tersely, to stifle the minds of our youth, close their options in life, and to offer them death in its service, particularly in the form of suicide, as the most sublime purpose of life, is not the hallmark of a living community. Moreover this is done not because of the lack of possible alternative courses of action in an international climate where the Sri Lankan state is weak and where human rights concern is well institutionalised. But this is done because of internal compulsions into which the LTTE has been led by its history of murder.\n\nWe have seen this tragedy as a broader social phenomenon where the opportunism of intellectuals and the social elite played a key role. A typical and routine example of such opportunism is that of a university professor who with compliments of the LTTE had got his sons safely away to Colombo, telling his students in a speech: You must not just commemorate the LTTE martyrs, but each one of you must aspire to become one. [See Reports No 6,8,9]. In 9 and 10 we have dealt extensively with the LTTEs political prisoners and aspects of its deceit towards the young it had recruited.\n\nWe will here examine continuing trends, based on our own sources and material published by the LTTE. We put these down not just for record, but as before in the hope that these would influence our readers and have a benign impact on current developments. We believe we have no cause for disappointment with our previous efforts.\n\nTamil political leaders, particularly in an election year, and the expatriates who still back the LTTE, must come up with alternatives for those, including the militant cadre, who are trapped. If the Tamils are to survive as a people, we need to find alternatives to narrow nationalism and militarism without abandoning the struggle for justice and dignity. It is our misfortune that the so called moderate Tamil leadership even after decades of tragedy are unable to identify the darker side of our nationalism, which in turn legitimises an intolerant and paranoid Sinhalese nationalism and vice versa .\n\n[Top]\n\n6.2 The LTTE and the world\n\nBecause of the LTTEs intrinsic limitations, foreign contacts and sympathetic journalistic coverage have always been seen as crucial by the LTTE. Conducted tours for journalists and public relations efforts aimed at visiting peace missions served the LTTE well. Western governments with political and economic interests in Sri Lanka, and with a large number of Tamil refugees whose return was sought, found it in some ways useful to permit the LTTE to have offices in their country despite its other activities. To maintain these advantages the LTTE found it prudent to show some token response to queries from human rights organisations. It has however shown no concrete response to requests concerning thousands of its political detainees. But it had come to the point of admitting privately that it had other prisoners who cannot yet be shown to organisations like the ICRC.\n\nWestern disillusionment became visible about mid - 1993 when negotiations by the UNHCR with the warring parties to reopen the Pooneryn ferry were scuttled. Privately, much of the blame was placed on the LTTE. Even earlier while peace efforts by organisations like the QPS (Quaker Peace and Service) in association with several other NG0s were heading towards increasing pessimism, the UNHCR became associated in moves to deport Tamil refugees, with or without peace.\n\nThese seem to have co-incided with the surfacing of endemic internal problems within the LTTE - namely the arrest and interrogation of Deputy Leader Mahattaya and Yogi. This was a bad time for the LTTE to manage its external relations.\n\nThe massacre of more than 20 Sinhalese fishermen off the Mannar coast in March, broke 17 months of restraint by the LTTE. It may point to a new attitude towards human rights pressure. The leader had also been warning people not to place hopes on external powers, but to be self reliant. This is obviously more a warning than a possibility.\n\n0n 22nd April the European Parliament at Strasbourg called for a closure of LTTE offices in its member states on the grounds that these are used to propagate terrorism against a friendly country, and to extort funds from Tamils living in the territory of the European Union, for the pursuit of violent actions. Since the passing of the resolution Tamils living in the apparent safety of Europe and North America have witnessed murder and arson in their midst. The LTTEs own intimidatory behaviour can hardly be other than incriminating. It seems to be bent on snuffing out dissent even in the West. Yet its noises about wanting a negotiated end to the conflict continue in contrast to the intentions otherwise revealed.\n\nWhy did the LTTE at this juncture resort to open criminal behaviour abroad? From the earlier phase of local level intimidation and thuggery to a new one, the activities of which include calulated killing and arson, shows that the decision has been taken at the highest level.\n\nThere is one plausible explanation - viz. the LTTE has decided that if it can not openly function in the West then it will not allow anyone else to operate there. Moreover the LTTE would not mind even it if all Tamil refugees in the West are sent back to Sri Lanka. It would be from the LTTEs point of view a blessing in disguise. Those who have openly identified with the LTTE can of course ask for political asylum, remain in the West and carry on their activites through clandestine means. But the presence in Sri Lanka of frustrated youths sent back from Western countries and living in a hostile environment, far from being a handicap to the LTTEs politics, has right along been an asset. [Top]\n\n6.3 The LTTE and the People\n\nThough the LTTE may still be romanticised from outside, internally its relations with the people are governed by a deep seated cynicism on both sides. The idealistic phase of the struggle has long passed its Indian summer, and a reality as cold as steel is setting in. With its distinctive cynicism, it set about demolishing the moral character of the society for short term gain. Every area of Jaffna produced its professionals who learnt to grab what is not theirs by becoming sneaks and informers. Comic tales about the activities of such persons and their occasional discomfiture are part of the current folklore in Jaffna. But in the long term the LTTE itself is paying a heavy price for its debasement of human values. Its troubles in the East have been documented elsewhere in this report. In other areas the response is varied. In Jaffna the control of the mind is said to be the most complete. There is almost no visible military presence. The barbed wires are described as being within the mind of each individual - people know and accept what they should think and speak and what they should not. In the Wanni area where the people act less as individuals than as a group, the LTTE has been forced to abandon its taxation programmes and its ambitions of building a volunteer force. The people have learnt to play games with the LTTE and the LTTE is not sure of itself.\n\nAn example of the control of the mind concerns the arrest in Jaffna of Deputy Leader Mahattaya. Details of the affair have been published in Tamil journals abroad. Those who know least about it are the people in Jaffna. Those in Jaffna questioned would come out with answers such as, Prabaharan will surely release Mahattaya and is also a good man who has taken into his care Mahattayas wife and child for their protection (rather than his!). It is also a tacit admission that the ostensibly serious charges against Mahattaya, such as his complicity with the RAW, are not taken seriously. But any deeper probing is avoided.\n\nAn important method of control is through the running of the civil administration which forces people to go to the LTTE for many essentials. The most ironic of these is the distribution of government supplied kerosene with quotas assigned to farmers, students, teachers and so on. Improvisations for the use of kerosene have been multiplying. A visitor wondered whether Jaffna could be called the worlds pioneer Kerosene Civilisation. He went on to suggest: I believe it is within the ability of the Tigers to free the people from the grip of government supplied kerosene and make them more self reliant. The uses of wind, steam and solar power as sources of energy could be explored. But these would also make people more independent and loosen the grip of the Tigers. Even if the possibility of an alternative exists, I do not think the Tigers would be interested.\n\nThe corrupting influence on society is a function of the politics and in the case of Jaffna the Tigers are often not directly responsible. When public accountability is replaced by accountability to a totalitarian power many institutions, NG0s and even churches also become oppressive in their outlook. Many of these institutions in a time of crisis have independent access to enormous resources which come as relief or cash for projects. Any official who gets close to the Tigers could circumvent the respective committee or council. Then their power could almost reach the point of arrogance which even an ordinary Tiger may find embarrassing. There is always a dilemma in choosing between cushioning a society in difficulty and contributing to what the political ambience tends to render a corrupting influence.\n\nA report from Jaffna described the pathological condition of the relationship between the Tigers and the people: Even in this environment people are adapting themselves to living happily. How long can they live without hope? Sri Lankan bombers can strike at any moment, or shells fired from army camps or from the sea could end their earthly sojourn. Public functions, private functions and even birthdays are being celebrated with the old splendour. These are cooling shadows cast by occasional clouds which dim the scorching sun hovering over their existence. There are few public functions without the Tigers..... [Another report added that the Tigers had even organised carolling last Christmas!]\n\nTraditional shrines to local deities are being overtaken by shrines to martyrs [dead Tigers], consisting of sheltered 15 feet cut - outs, with a lamp at its foot, beside which flowers are to be placed. Recently the 6th death anniversary of Annai Poopathy, was celebrated. Several of her shrines decked with white cloth, containing her picture surrounded by flowers and lamps appeared in Jaffna. 0ne such shrine was within my vision much of the time. Later in the day the LTTE loud speaker announced, Crowds of people came in droves to pay their respects to Annai Poopathy. But I had in fact not seen a single person pay homage at the shrine.\n\n0n the other hand there had recently been a cricketing event - an annual big match between two schools. It attracted about 30 000 spectators, and the police and LTTE cadre between 10 and 15 years were deployed in crowd control duties. The game over,the winning team decorated a bullock cart carrying a musical band and headed a procession of jubilant cyclists. The LTTE radio announced that night, To mourn the death of Ravi, the General commanding the Killinochchi Division who died in an accidental explosion, all activity ceased in the peninsula to give way to the silence of grief.\n\nAnother report referring perhaps to the same match gives a picture of the operative cynicism and how it might affect impressionable young cadre, shaping their attitude to the people. The LTTE had given its blessings to what may be described as a pure Tamil movement. The report described how supporters of one team cheered their side with the more than a century old College, College, Central college. Upon seeing a uniformed patrol approaching a nudge would be passed down the line,  The  Kavalturai( Police) are coming . The slogan changes to the pure Tamil , Velka, Velka, Maththiya Kalloori Velka. The uniformed boys in their early teens pass on with expressionless faces pretending to be unaware of what they could do very little about. The crowd then instinctively resumes, College, College ....\n\nThus throughout the North - East people see little relevance in this war and have given expression to different ways of opting out. Quite often this opting out expresses itself in an insensitive manner, which is a price the politics has exacted from their humanity.\n\nThis insensitivity could sometimes be very harsh. Some recently qualified medical graduates were at a party in Colombo. In talking about Jaffna, one burst out, These LTTE bastards, they would not even let us use our own cars! These young doctors had very likely sat through and applauded countless speeches made by dignitaries at the university in praise of the LTTE, knew even about students imprisoned by that group, attended to injured LTTE cadre at the Jaffna Hospital, made sure their passes to leave Jaffna were not jeopardised, and this was their final reflection on the whole tragic experience. This is to be expected. Rather than an individual phenomenon, it is a social one, and a verdict on the effect of the politics on the tone of the University - in many ways the cradle of the liberation struggle.\n\nThe LTTE cadre may be young, but they are also intelligent and alert enough to see through the social reality. But they are also young persons who very likely at some point believed that they were going to die for the others, feel angry about how the society really views them, and are also trapped through having joined the movement. Their attitude to people becomes in time one of contempt and the relationship one of mutual deception.\n\nThe first case in the next section shows how this could work itself out in the life of an individual cadre. [See also Ch.2, Report 6 and Ch. 5, Report 8]. [Top]\n\n6.4 The pains of godhead\n\nSusharitha Thiagalingam (Lt.Sambavi): Susharitha was from a professional family and was boarded at a leading girls school in Jaffna. She was a bright student and a spirited girl who argued on issues and insisted that right should prevail. 0nce during the IPKF presence she joined the LTTE and was brought back by her parents a few weeks later. The boarding mistress told her jokingly, I thought once you put a foot forward you never took it back. Susharita responded with some embarrassment, Miss, one day I will come back here in uniform and show you! Susharita graduated to the A.Level class. Sometime about early 1991 she went away and joined the LTTE. She once returned to her school on some business and showed herself to the boarding mistress, Miss, look at me, I am in uniform!\n\nThe LTTE used her in their propaganda wing as she was spirited and articulate. In time she became less accessible to those who knew her. She was evidently brooding over her state. With some who knew her, upon meeting them, she would snap, You cowards, you want to lead normal lives while others are dying for you! But with her intimate friends and teachers she showed a different face. Sometimes she would suddenly drop in and say she was hungry. Having eaten she would sit thoughtfully. Though a Hindu she would ask passages to be read to her from the Bible, and request them for hymns or lyrics she was wont to hear at school. These seemed to soothe her. To her intimate circle she let slip a hint of what she thought of the movement. She said, Never think of joining this. It is no place for women. Home is the place for women!\n\nThrough all this inner doubt she felt impelled to perform her duties on behalf of the movement, urging others to join and support its cause. When her class got their A.Level results, she wrote individually to some of them. 0ne received a sisterly note, Congratulations, do not be disappointed with your results. Despite the handicaps you personally suffered, you have done well for yourself. I wish I had sat for the A.Levels with you. I know I would have got good results.\n\nIt appears that she decided to end her double life. Though the movement highly prized her work in the propaganda unit, she insisted and was posted to a combat unit. This she communicated to an old associate she met on the road. That was the last seen of her. She was among the more than 300 LTTE cadre who died at Pooneryn on 11th November 1993 on the first day of the LTTEs 0peration Frog.\n\nBy now there is probably a wayside shrine for her and a street named after her, and learned folk urging other young to follow her example. But the real thoughts of the reluctant goddess lay interred with her mortal remains.\n\nWe give below some salient features in the lives of several dead LTTE cadre taken from the journal, The Liberation Tigers. Their stories are written in the innocent prose of their close companions and do not appear to have been doctored. The first group are Black Tigers.\n\nCaptain Mathan (Srinivasan Sivakumar), of Battialoa, born 7/9/75. Student at Batticoloa Hindu. Joined LTTE mid 1989 while in Grade 9. His left leg became maimed during an incident in the Trinco jungles.\n\nMajor Varathan (Kanthasamy Ramachandran), of Thodarpakam, Batticaloa, born 11/4/73. Joined LTTE 1989, served in Kallichchai, Vadamunai. Lost right leg in a land mine explosion after June 1990. Transferred to photographic unit after training in Jaffna. His relatives arrived in Jaffna without any knowldge of his family and Varathan thought his family had been killed by the Sri Lankan forces. But this turned out later not to be the case.\n\nVarathan and Mathan joined the Black Tigers, and 62 days later on 25th August 1993 they died smashing their explosive laden boats Pulendran and Kumarappa into Sri Lankan navy patrol boats P115 and P121 in the Jaffna Lagoon.\n\nVarathan is quoted as having said: I constantly think of what the leader told me. I wait patiently for the moment I will ram a water jet (patrol boat).\n\nThe writer says of the two: They may not have possessed the acumen to give rational reasons why they joined the Black Tigers. Nevertheless they were clear about the necessity.\n\nPuvindran (18) Mother disappeared when Puvindran was 12 during the IPKF presence when she went to Trinco. Father evidently a Leftist and well read in English. Puvindran joined LTTE and suffered a leg injury during the Elephant Pass operation of July 1991. Had elder sister & younger brother. Declined fathers request to leave the LTTE.\n\nThe writer says of Puvindran: He was innocent and did not understand the bends and curls of life. He only knew how to be helpful to his neighbour. ..... He joined the Black Tigers and was inspired by the late Admiral Charles to smash an SL Navy Dvora Craft while serving in Kilaly. When alone the limping boy was wont to unfurl a map, point here and there with a long stick and pretend to be a general addressing others on strategy. He would explain how he would smash an explosive laden boat into a Dvora at sea.\n\n0nce the time and place were decided, he had the ceremonial meal with the Leader. A photograph shows the Leader bending down with concern and inquiring about his injured leg with Puvindran blushing at being found worthy of such attention. Puvindran and Captain Maniarasan (apparently 13 or 14 years) smashed into a Dvora off Pt Pedro on 29/8/93.\n\nThe report adds: You fulfilled your prophecy before our very eyes... Then we laughed. But now..... we retrieved two cannons and two 50 calibre machine guns from the sinking Dvora.\n\nMajor Tambo (Kasipillai Thayaparan), of Mulankavil, Mannar. Injured and went to India for treatment. Arrested with Kittu and Rahim, deported and interned IPKF, Vavunia during 1988. Injured in the left leg while escaping. (A Tiger who had allowed himself to be arrested without swallowing cyanide lives with a sense of guilt.) Tambo had two elder brothers and one younger sister. At home on the day of the sisters age attaining ceremony, a brother and the sister argued. His mother beat the brother. Upon this the sister committed suicide by swallowing poison. A month later this brother joined the LTTE. Earlier his other brother who had gone fishing was missing after being arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. Tambo became a Black Tiger. His assigned mission was to smash an explosive laden truck into the Sri Lankan Army encampment at Silavaturai on 19/3/91. Just prior to his mission, Tambo crying and scraping the earth with a stick, related his lifes tragedy to the writer. The truck was hit and exploded before it reached the target.\n\nMajor Kantharuban (Yogarajah Koneswaran), Valvettithurai, born 9/10/71. Almost captured by the SL Army while doing sentry duty at Thondamannaru in early 1987. Was saved after having swallowed cyanide which left him internally impaired. He was with the Leader in Manal Aru during 1988/89. For his condition he was advised to take fresh cows milk, which was boiled and served to him by Mrs. Prabakaran. As much as he was touched, he felt helpless through his inability to repay the kindness. He requested the Leader to make him a Black Tiger as a means of recompense. Having been an orphan, he also requested the Leader to found an orphanage, adding, As you have looked after me with great kindness, do also look after them. In assenting to his request the Leader is said to have been greatly touched. Kantharuban died with Captain Vinoth, smashing SLN Command Ship Editharaoff VVT on 10/7/90. The Leaders orphanage The Red Blossomed Garden is said to be the fulfilment of the promise.\n\n0ther quotes from the testimonies of Black Tigers:\n\nCaptain Sithamparam, 20/12/72 - 4/5/91, VVT, Fisherman to aunt (Periamma) who wanted him to go abroad and support the family: You are giving me as examples others who went abroad. Many of my companions have died. My heart overflows with their memory.\n\nCaptain Malaravan Leo (Kasilingam Vijinthan) of Tinnevely. Apparently very young, died suicide attack, Palaly, 23/11/92: I was seated on my mothers lap with my brother (Sinnannah) when the army entered. They shot my grand father and uncle. My mother was injured in the hand.\n\nThe following are from the records of cadre who died during the attack on Janakapura SLA camp, Manal Aru (Weli 0ya) on 25th July 1993.\n\nLt. Thirumalai Nambi Fernando (Varaprakasam Yuktheepan), Colombogam, Jaffna: Asked his mates to wish good bye to his parents. Came and stood before the camera when a video was taken on the way to the attack. Said: Should I die, the Leader will remember me whenever he plays this video.\n\n2nd Lt. Siyamani (Yogachandran Ravishankar), Trinco, Very Young. Parents refugees in Suthanthirapuram, Puthukudiyiruppu, Mullaitivu. Witnessed atrocities by the SL Army. Used to wake up in the nights crying. Came ashore by sea on day of attack.\n\nLt. Vasan Thamilvannan (Selliah Vetha), Koyilporativu, Batticaloa, very young, personally witnessed much brutality from the SL forces. Used to carry a knife, saying, I wish to behead Sri Lankan soldiers and watch their death throes.\n\nThe cases above vividly corroborate what we have been saying about the nature of the LTTE and its cadre in our past reports. Most of these cases are from sections of Tamil society marginalised in the first instance by economic and social hierarchies internal to the society. 0nce they were ethnically branded and subject to unremitting violence by the state, all major militant groups readily recruited from among them. Ironically the Tamil nationalist ideology which these groups articulated in varying degrees, with the LTTE increasingly driven to take refuge in its most extreme form, incorporated the very alienating and oppressive aspects of Tamil elite culture. A well known fact is that nearly all senior cadre in all the groups - indeed non-LTTE groups have very few, if any, recent recruits- come from deprived backgrounds. They are trapped into their present existence. Also nearly all of them are from rural areas, particularly from the East.\n\nThe cases also display a certain innocence and childlike trust in the Leader. Their naivete and lack of questioning are deemed praiseworthy. Their resentment against the Sri Lankan state, an often deep sense of personal tragedy and the unmitigated emptiness of a highly controlled totalitarian society have all been nourished into a desire to end their life in service of the organisation. There is frequently also a misplaced sense of gratitude for this privilege. These are not strange revelations to those who have lived in close proximity to the LTTE. Even for those cadre who begin to question the organisation, death comes as the most expeditious release. For, the LTTE has ensured that there are no other structures through which those with doubts can challenge or question the organisation. The Sri Lankan states continuing oppressive approach must bear, as always, a heavy share of the responsibility for legitimising this internal state of affairs.\n\nThe unquestioning innocence of the cadre also made it easy for the LTTE leadership to mobilise them into a politics that was as murderous as it was divisive- in some ways paralleled by the situation in the South where village boys form the same family, some in JVP and others in state sponsored regular and semi - regular forces, were hunting each other.\n\n6.5 The Making of the New 0lympians: The LTTEs pantheon of deities.\n\nWhen a politics ceases to respect human norms and expectations, nothing comes more naturally than an official religion to rationalise the politics. Its beginnings were dealt with in the Broken Palmyrah. It has now developed to a point where it, if not competes with, then seeks to co-exist with established religions. A recently issued hymnody Inspirational Tamil Ealam Songs Volume 4 says in its preface that these songs are intended to nourish our people with love for the land and warlike feelings towards the enemy. These songs it is said have today largely replaced cinema songs.\n\nThe following are translated excerpts from this volume. The first group is titled Songs From the Red Blossomed Garden (Sencholai Padalkal). The Sencholai is the orphanage founded by the Leader ostensibly in deference to a pledge he made to the late Black Tiger, Major Kantharuban (Koneswaran), who requested the Leader to look after them (the orphans) with great kindness as you had also looked after me. This kindness is also portrayed in pictures taken of the Leader playing with the children with self - evident pleasure. The songs reveal motives which go far beyond those formally claimed. The composers name is given at the end of each extract.\n\nIn our Elder Brothers shade we sheltered his loving hands gave us motherly ministration We were lost and found direction 0ur hearts emptiness was filled by our comforters.\n\nChorus: Little little roses growing in the red garden\n\nThe little bees have gathered in the hive of love.\n\n Navannan.\n\nWe are flowers and we are Tigers\n\nWe grow up to bring forth wonders\n\nEquality we cherish, nor approaching death shake us\n\nIn the school of knowledge and the sunshine of freedom\n\nThis is the song of gathered flowers.\n\n Pon Ganeshamoorthy.\n\nIn the Leaders footsteps we shall tread\n\nWe shall bring forth Tamil Eelam\n\nIn the fight of our generation\n\nWe too boldly will do our battle\n\n Jeya.\n\nWe shall feed the hungry\n\nBearing weapons we shall vanquish hate\n\nThrough taking to Medicine, Engineering and Trade,\n\nWe shall uplift our nature-endowed land....\n\nWe live as models of the Holy Land of Eelam.\n\n Navannan.\n\nThe next group consists of songs composed by women which appeared under headings such as Awake and be Alert and Songs of birds in search of dawn. 0ne sees frequent occurrences of the motif of death - we will leave our foot-prints in the tomb -and their womanly longings sublimated into devotion for the Leader. Given the natural role of a woman as the bringer and nurturer of life, the frequent reference to death sounds a tragic note.\n\nYou lived as a flower and arose as the storm You descended upon the battlefield to write a new saga As a flash of lightning you were etched in our hearts 0ur duties we forget not and for training we go 0ur mother - land we shall free And sing your praises 0 Leader.\n\n(A later line reads, In the moment you burned you were sown as a seed;)\n\nChorus: We worship at the tomb with lamps uplifted\n\nWe make your dreams ours and bring them to fruition\n\n Thamilaval.\n\nWell run with haste to join the ranks of the Leader\n\nWith our heads held high we free the land of Eelam\n\nThe Legendary Heros (Kaviya Nayakans) path we follow\n\nAnd leave our foot prints in the tomb\n\nThe vision of a millennium lies before our eyes\n\n0ur hearts beat impatiently to attain it.\n\n Dharshi.\n\nThe tomb shall wait for me\n\nFlowers as offerings shall there blossom\n\nA memorial for me who turn into a myriad atoms\n\nThe burning embers shall watch over me.\n\nThe poet then describes a variety of possible deaths awaiting her -such as shells and bullets. It then runs:\n\nThe poison (cyanide) I bore since I became a Tigress Shall also await me The hawk and the hound to taste my flesh Shall stalk the field where I do battle ...All these will I endure for my land To me a grateful nation shall arise.\n\n Uthayaletchumi.\n\n[This song has no reference to the Leader.]\n\nThe next is a song explicitly for the Leader:\n\nFearless of heart and the esteem of the Tamil Nation became his life He will dance as the raging storm The singer who strikes his foes.\n\nA mother are you who feeds us milk of courage A father who daily sings us songs of virtue A teacher (Asan) whose wisdom will ripen into scripture, 0 Big Brother whose great love overflows\n\n Vasanthamathy.\n\nWhat follows is a song for the late General Kittu by the LTTEs poet laureate Puthuvai Rathinathurai. Kittu survived a first assassination attempt on his life by his own group in March 1987. After serving as ambassador in Europe, he took his own life as required when an arms ship in which he was travelling was surrounded by the Indian Navy - something which he failed to do when arrested by the Indian authorities in Madras in 1988. Mahattaya is now alleged by the group of having latterly betrayed him to the Indian state.\n\nWith love you shall dwell in the hearts of Eelavar (Eelam folk)Becoming Prabhakarans brother you shall live forever Desiring a liberated land you came 0 warrior You became our Kittu Annan (Elder Brother) 0 thou Deity.\n\nThe last two are Black Tiger songs composed also by Puthuvai Rathinathurai. The reader should compare these with the reality of the Black Tigers given in the earlier section.\n\nWhen with lightning in your eyes you will, It becomes our command 0 Big Brother Prabakaran We dancing Black Tigers Move with decision Transforming ourselves into bombs We ransom our lives and destroy the enemy.....\n\nInspired by Big Brothers (Annans) gospel We bring the sky down to earth We are the dancing Black Tigers......\n\nAnd lastly -\n\nWith the thirst of the motherland in your breast, You embraced death - In the very moment exploding heat consumed your body, Whom were you thinking of?\n\nDid you think of your mother\n\nWho gave you suck and lulled you to slumber?\n\n0r was it the hand of your father\n\nWhich held you upon his shoulder?\n\n0r did you think of the chosen Hero Who bathed daily in freedoms fire? Who [anointed you by] patting your shoulder and saying, fare thee well? Did you,did you think of the searing pain of sadness bearing down his breast?\n\nThe reader familiar with the religious life of the Tamils will have no difficulty in picking out the elements that go into this syncretised religion. These are elements picked up from folk culture which form the common currency of discourse. The Dancing Shiva personifying fate and destruction was long familiar to the Tamils. The motif of the seed that shall not bring forth life unless it fall on the ground and die, from St. Johns gospel, is now also part of common currency. It was used by the priest who delivered the funeral oration for the fallen Mannar area leader, Victor, in November 1986.\n\nThe last song contains a rationalisation at least partly borrowed from Christianity - the Saviour who voluntarily takes upon him, and dies for, the sins of the world. It provides justification for the Leader whose own life is relatively secure, and at whose bidding others obediently end their lives. The Leader thus voluntarily undergoes immense pain by daily incinerating and purifying himself in freedoms fire. Moreover the pain he feels upon seeing a Black Tiger go on his final mission, is no less than what the victim would feel, as the exploding elements rip his body, and during the prior anguish of expectation.\n\nNote: The Tamil the word Annan is commonly a term of address to an elder brother indicative of affection and respect. It also has its sarcastic uses. Given the culture of surveillance and fear within the LTTE which are combined with awe, we have generally translated  Annan  as Big Brother in trying to give the spirit of the text.\n\n6.6 Shifting Patterns in Recruitment & their 0perational Impact\n\nWe have in the past given a good deal of qualitative information about the social and regional implications of recruitment by the LTTE. We have also reported certain trends from the ground in the East and parts of the North. Now we move on to examine some aspects in the light of information provided by LTTE publications.\n\nThe booklet Manal Aru by Mother Tamil Publishers, Jaffna provides lists of casualties in the sensitive Manal Aru (or Weli 0ya) region between March 1988 and 2nd November 1990. 0ne list has 52 casualties from villages in Manal Aru itself, including Tennamaravady. It seems likely, though not clear, that they died in Manal Aru itself. The other list contains nearly 80 names of persons, whose native villages, dates of birth and death are given. These died in action in Manal Aru, but are from outside the area. We divide this into two groups.\n\nThe first group saw action against the IPKF between March 1988 and September 1989 inclusive.The second group saw action against the SL forces from after mid-June 1990 up to 1st November 1991. Here as in what follows Vanni generally refers to Vavuniya and Killinochchi Districts. The other names refer to the districts themselves. The breakdown of this group with place of origin and period in which the casualities occured is as follows:\n\nTable 1\n\nWe note the approximate equality between Jaffna and Eastern Province cadre. There were also 3 Muslims in the second category who died fighting for the LTTE during or after the massacres of Muslims at Kurukkal Madam, Kattankudy & Eravur. These cadre possibly died not knowing that their own group was responsible for the outrage against their own people.\n\nAnother sample consists of a list of 25 taken from LTTE journals during the second half of 1993. Most of them were either Black Tigers or those who died in Manal Aru on 25th July 1993. This breaks down as:\n\nTable 2\n\nNote again the rough equality between Jaffna and the Eastern Province.\n\nAn LTTE publication provided photographs with names and addresses of more than 440 cadre who died during 0peration Frog at Pooneryn in Novemeber 1993. The publication itself groups the casualties. Three lists make up the cadre who died on 11th, 12th & 13th November. Details of a few more cadre who succumbed to injuries and died subsequently was given in a fourth list.\n\nTable 3 gives the breakdown of casualities on the first three days according to the district of origin. Table 4 is according to the area of origin broadly catogarised as Jaffna, Rural North and East. A few cadre whose native places are outside these districts have not been given in the tables.\n\nTable 3\n\nTable 4\n\nA sample that is at first glance very different from the ones given earlier is the LTTE casualty list during the SL Armys 0peration Yarl Devi launched from Elephant Pass towards Kilaly at the end of September 1993.\n\nTable 5\n\nThe only Eastern casualty was a boy from Batticaloa long time resident in Mannar and included in the 22. What is peculiar here is that the LTTE mustered at short notice the experienced units deployed in the area to resist the SL Army advance. The large number of Mannar District cadre killed is another distinctive feature of this list. This list also comes from an incident whose duration was less than a week. It is thus far more likely to be unrepresentative compared with other lists where the duration spanned several months or where a planned thrust was made by the LTTE asking different units to send a certain number of fighters.\n\nAccording to persons who participated, 0peration Frog, which began on 11th November 1993, required initially the marshalling of about 1000 fighters from different units including 100 Sea Tigers. Hence it is likely to be a very informative sample. However the last sample is still consistent with two conclusions that we will draw. These are to do with the diminishing role of Eastern cadre and the enhanced representation of Jaffna among newer recruits.\n\nIn the earlier tables 1 & 2 provided above we have pointed to the rough equality between casualties from the Jaffna peninsula and from the East. But for the three samples from 0peration Frog which add up to a large whole, a remarkable feature is the markedly higher proportion of Eastern casualties on the second day (12th November 1993) and a far lower proportion of women on the two latter days.\n\nWe have mentioned that in 0peration Frog the number which took part in the first days assault was about 1000. If more than 320 were killed, the injured would have been about twice that figure. This would have meant that a large proportion taking part in the attack on day-one would have been incapacitated. 0n this reading reserves would have been inducted in to carry on the battle on subsequent days. In a sense the LTTEs man-power resources were being stretched. The LTTE would have been faced with a crisis resulting from the huge losses on day-one. Then to press on it would have had little choice but to mobilise available reserves- most of whom it seems happened to be from the East. That this was a crisis reaction is indicated by the seniority of Eastern cadre killed on subsequent days.\n\nWe note some of the trends that are evident in spite of several chance elements in the samples:\n\n1. The Eastern cadre proportionaltely bore the brunt of the fighting in the past and still remain an important segment of the fighting cadre. But among new recruits their significance is dropping. This lends substance to what we observed on the ground: That recruitment in the East is drying up. Since strong pressure on women to join up was a later phenomenon, the smaller number of Eastern women among the casualties also suggests the drying up of recruitment in the East.In assessing the significance of the relative paucity of women recruits from the East, other factors too must kept in mind. 0ne is the inaccessibility of special Womens camps unlike in Jaffna.\n\n2. While the role of women was negligible in the past, ie; before 1990, the figures suggest that women make up about 25% of the newer fighting cadre.\n\n3. Unlike in the past the brunt of the fighting among new recruits is shifting towards Jaffna. This to was qualitatively observed to stem from the recruitment drive backed by intense propaganda in the peninsula, helped by the Sri Lankan forces bombing and shelling. This would also indicate a siege mentality, a drastic drop in recruitment age and high pressure on girls to join.\n\n4. Although greater disillusionment has been reported in the Rural North, particularly between Cheddikulam and Madhu, up to last year at least recruitment seems to have been considerable. There is also, as the casualty list suggests, a notable incidence of recruits of Hill Country origin who had settled in the Rural North.\n\n5. The proportion of casualties from Trincomalee in the last two is much smaller than in the earlier samples. This may be because of chance elements in the choice of units for the latter operations. The other is that recruits of Trincomalee origin are now mainly from among refugees in Mullaitivu and Jaffna, owing to which their main theatre of deployment may be Manal Aru. Another possibility is that a large number of senior Trincomalee cadre who were prominent at one time may have left the movement or died. [See 1.7.]\n\n6.7 The future of the LTTE\n\nThe Leader, now in his fortieth year, is no longer a young man. Several among the highest in the sub-continent, including Lanka, have by word and deed acknowledged his greatness. With few resources other than the widespread alienation around him, and his personal charisma, he conjured up an organisation that shook the sub-continent.\n\nThere is a fundamental error on the part of those who have acknowledged his greatness. Their thoughts and actions were without reference to the Tamil people. Among those awed by him are senior Indian Army officers, presidents and ministers in this country and influential men in the establishment, such as the editor of the Frontline. All of them tried to deal with him on the basis of institutional power and failed. They thought in terms of the interests of institutions they were close to, and the interests of the LTTE. They forgot the Tamil people. When they failed, their comprehension fled them and they were awed. The LTTEs main weapon was the suffering and alienation of the Tamil people. Since the people did not count for others, the LTTE had undisturbed possession of this resource. [See earlier reports, the Broken Palmyrah or Someone Elses War.]\n\nThe Leader has thus through his experience learnt a great deal about people and nations. His contempt for intellectuals is perhaps with good reason and will be readily shared by many. He has come to believe in himself, in his methods and moreover that he is right. Experience has done little to shake his self-confidence. An outstanding feature of his success is that it is founded on institutions for death. He created no institutions for life. People listened in disbelief when his spokesman boasted that the overwhelming bulk of the Tamils would die, but their land of Eelam will be saved.\n\nBut the Leaders besetting error is that he treated people as passive objects and was unable to distinguish between their outward behaviour and their internal feelings.The people had an ordinary longing for life with dignity. As the politics drifted more and more into the rhetoric and the trappings of death, helped by the brutality of opposing state powers, the movement got its recruits. But the people are quietly drifting away. The relationship between the LTTE and the people became one of mutual cynicism. To the Leader himself the habit of cynicism and the distancing of himself from the people had an atrophying effect. Everything, including his cadre, came to be regarded instrumentally. There is perhaps an emotional tie with those who do his bidding - more akin to what a hunter feels towards a good hunting dog, or a racing buff towards a winning horse he owns.\n\nIn turn the Leader and his organisation were trapped. Having no life giving hope to offer, the movement needed to use the enemys idiotic brutality and whip up rhetoric and hopes of a religious nature to obtain its recruits. It thus lost the ability to respond to peace settlements that look too mundane. People in search of life began expressing their disenchantment in different ways which are often instinctive and unpremeditated as seen above. The movement itself became a home of persons who generally get disenchanted and in general go away after a few years if they survived.\n\nWhen an opportunity arises the people themselves often try to get their children out of the movement. Parents contacting the security forces and negotiating the surrender of a son in the movement is now very common in the East. In the Vanni the LTTE has become worried by the drop out rate which is said to be in the region, if not in excess, of the recruitment rate. Under these circumstances it suddenly dropped the idea of arming volunteers in the region. [See Report 12, Chapter 3, on how people volunteered and also 5.2 of this report.]\n\nWhen people opt out of the LTTEs cause it happens by imperceptible stages, but the signs are surely there. What may amount to a strong indication appears in Journeying Together for Peace - The Report of an International Inter-religious Mission to Sri Lanka in June 1993 issued by APHD-SEDEC of the Roman Catholic Church. A concern raised in a discussion with clergy in the Diocese of Trincomalee and Batticaloa reads: The imposition of solutions from the North. The East has different problems and the LTTE does not represent the entire Tamil people.\n\nThis is in sharp contrast to the sentiments among Roman Catholic religious in Jaffna reported by visiting delegations. It also contrasts with what surfaced when the visiting Canadian delegation had a discussion with Eastern University staff in January 1992 (See Pravada, February 1992).It was then suggested that it was the LTTE that should negotiate on behalf of the Tamils. The Roman Catholic clergy in the East are widely travelled in the villages. Many of them have seen the atrocities of the Sri Lankan army at first hand and some of them were even killed. 0bviously they have little sympathy for the Sri Lankan government or its forces. But then what is the LTTE offering the people of the East? The clergy are evidently responding to the widespread hopelessness that prevails in the East and the meaningless suffering particularly in the villages.\n\nThe spate of information reaching the armed forces in areas under their control today is totally uncharacteristic. This is again in sharp contrast to the late 70s and early 80s. The security forces were then very angry at the paucity of information. The Colombo press, if it not actually did, was close to accusing the people of the North-East of a heinous collective conspiracy. It was a time when the Tamil elites were mostly feeling uneasy about the militants activities. But in rural villages, including Muslim villages, the people readily sheltered the militants. In the past the informers actually were and were seen to be individuals. But in the LTTEs rage at what it has today brought upon itself, not individuals but whole communities and villages are accused of being informers. First it accused the Muslims and massacred hundreds of them, even after which Muslim LTTE cadre continued to die for its cause [See the booklet Manal Aru referred to above.] Similarly a large number of Tamil youth of Hill Country origin domiciled in the North have joined the LTTE. But last year some influential local LTTE area leaders in the Vanni reportedly accused Tamils of Hill Country origin resident there of being informers. Many of these hapless folk who had fled communal violence many times sold their goods cheap in preparation for deportation in the same manner as Muslims of the North in 1990. However, wiser counsels seem to have prevailed. Today again some villages close to the armys FDLs in the Vavuniya and Mannar sectors have been accused of giving information. Contrary to what the LTTE may think, the people did not let down the movements. It was the reverse. That the people have been driven to a state where they could be collectively suspect as informers marks a pathology in the politics itself.\n\nIn the final analysis the LTTE is paying the price of disregarding common morality. It has readily bloodied its hands dealing with anyone it saw as a threat to its sole dominance. But then the same logic must begin to apply within the movement itself. 0nce the struggle distanced itself from the high moral ground and placed itself firmly on the low, people doubted everything the leaders said. When Kittu lost his leg in a bomb blast in March 1987, the LTTE controlled press said one thing, but the people believed the opposite. That prominent leaders should fall one by one was seen as only the natural order of things in the LTTE. The recent descent of Balasingam from chief theoretician to apparently interpreter came as no surprise. When with the Leaders approval far - reaching accusations of treachery were levelled against Deputy Leader Mahattaya, they were widely disbelieved.\n\nAccording to published reports which have not been denied, the Leader found his credibility threatened to a point where he had to lay aside the mystique and inaccessibility he had so assiduously cultivated, come down and personally campaign for an acceptance of the charges against Mahattaya. He is said to have talked to members of the intelligentsia in groups. According to independent reports the people of Valvettithurai, home of both Prabakaran and Mahattaya, took out a procession to demand that Mahattaya be spared. Their reasoning was that in 1989 when it was rumoured that Prabakaran was killed in a fight with Mahattaya, they had also taken out a procession to demand from Mahattaya the restoration of Prabakaran. The Leader is thus snared in his own moral choices. The ground is slowly but surely shifting under LTTEs edifice. It may however take years before the effects show militarily. But the cracks have visibly widened in the last two years.\n\nThe Leader has however been innovative in the past. If the government continues to be brutal, or even ambivalent and insensitive about Tamil feelings, new fronts are likely to open up even if there are no more recruits from the villages. Recent hotel bomb explosions in Colombo reveal a new kind of recruit from a privileged class who has made a deliberate choice. There is a large number of young Tamils in the West and perhaps even in Colombo who could make a comfortable living, but feel alienated by the materialism of their surroundings and even the insensitivity and pecuniary pursuits of their fellow Tamils. In their alienation they want to do something. The LTTE possesses an organised structure and a religious aura to quickly tap their alienation and offer them something meaningful even if it is only destructive. If thousands of Tamil refugees are to be deported to Colombo from the West without a settlement and without being offered creative options to rebuild their community, dangers that could arise from several directions are enormous. There is a certain disorientation among people in both the North and the South. New economic mores have destroyed traditional relationships and have gone far to make money the determining factor in relationships. Factors connected to the war have made social behaviour even more chronic in the North. Many young throughout the country are becoming alienated and are looking for leadership. The challenge facing us today is to offer a political force that will direct their energies constructively. How difficult it is, is shown by the tragedies of the last 17 years. If such is not forthcoming, others like the LTTE are there and are waiting in the wings.\n\nIn conclusion we recall what the late Dr. Rajani Thiranagama wrote in the Broken Palmyrah six years ago:\n\nThe Tigers history, their theoretical vacuum, lack of political creativity, intolerance and fanatical dedication will be the ultimate cause of their own break up. The legendary Tigers will go to their demise with their legends smeared with the blood and tears of victims of their own misdoings. A new Tiger will not emerge from their ashes. 0nly by breaking with this whole history and its dominant ideology, can a new liberating outlook be born. [Top]\n\nNext || Previous|| TOC of Report13"
