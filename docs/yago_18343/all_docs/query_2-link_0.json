        "text": "A departure in the investment pattern of Sri Lanka A came in the post 1977 period with the enactment of Greater Colombo Economic Commission Law.1 This Law was enacted to establish and manage Export Processing Zones known as Free Trade Zones within the Republic of Sri Lanka. By this Law, the Greater Colombo Economic Commission was established with the object of inter alia promoting foreign investment within the Republic.2 Later, by amending the Greater Colombo Economic Commission Law,3 the Greater Colombo Economic Commission was named as ‘Board of Investment of Sri Lanka.’\n\nForeign investment is described as an investment of foreign capital by foreign individuals or foreign companies. Sornarajah stated that “Foreign investment involves the transfer of tangible or intangible assets from one country into another for the purpose of use in that country to generate wealth under the total or partial control of the owner of the assets.”7 In the globalisation process, the foreign investment is interwoven with the national economy of most of the developing countries including Sri Lanka.8 The industrial law of a country is also a factor which is considered by the investors, specially the foreign investors.\n\nTherefore, the industrial law of Sri Lanka is a complicated web to those who are in the managerial positions unless they have special knowledge in industrial law. Since managing the labour force is also an integral part of foreign investment, labour laws, amendments and the regulations that are scattered and which deal with various aspects of employment should be codified an consolidated to provide easy access to the managers.10\n\nThe labour legislation of this country is equally applied to the industries that come under the BOI” and no power has been granted to the Board to enter into an agreement to exempt or modify or vary the provisions of labour legislation.12 But it is interesting to note that even though the post 1977 policy of the successive governments has been attracting more foreign investment, the labour legislation of the country has been applied without any change in the context of foreign investment.13\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the State intervention to protect the interests of the workers who do not have equal bargaining power with the employers has resulted in the enactment of large number of labour statutes. The question does arise whether the labour legislation is over protective of employees and weigh heavily in favour of them. If so, it will have an adverse impact on creating a conducive environment for foreign investment in Sri Lanka. Hence, the objective of this paper is, to analyse the industrial law of Sri Lanka in the context of foreign investment from employees perspective and investors perspective.\n\nAlthough, there are a number of labour statutes to protect the interests of the workers, still, some of them require amendments in the context of foreign investment. The Workmen Compensation Ordinance’4 provides for the payment of compensation to workmen for personal injury caused by accident arising out of and in the course of employment15 or for occupational diseases mentioned in Schedule lll16 or for the disease which is reasonably attributable to the nature of the workman’s employment.17 In discussing the diseases attributable to the nature of the workman’s employment, H.J.F.Silva observed that “…it refers to the nature of employment and not occupation. As term ’employment’ is wider in scope than the term ‘occupation’, workmen will now be able to claim compensation in respect of diseases arising out of their work environment.”18 He further stated that “In the United States and Western Countries attempts are made to give a wide interpretation to the word ‘disease’ to include even cases such as repetitive stress injuries,19 caused by repetitive body motions or workplace furniture poorly designed without regard to ergonomics.”20 Hence, it is emphasised that since with the inflow of foreign investment, modern technology as well as various types of chemicals pervades into the industrial sector, the clause ‘diseases attributable to the nature of the workman’s employment’ should be interpreted liberally by the judiciary to compensate the workmen.21\n\nAs to payment of gratuity, the Payment of Gratuity Act23 is applicable to the employer who employs fifteen or more workmen24 and in respect of the employer who employs less than fifteen workmen, the workmen has to make an application to the Labour Tribunal25 for gratuity. It is suggested that the Payment of Gratuity Act should be amended to make it applicable even to the employer who employs only one workman. As to the contribution of the employer to the employees’ provident fund, the employers should be induced to enhance their contribution.\n\nThe Factories Ordinance26 shall also be amended from time to time in accordance with the changes in the technology and the substances used in the factory to ensure the safety, health and welfare of the workers. In Consumer Education and Research Centre v Union of India27 Ramaswamy.J stated that “The right to health to a worker is an integral facet of meaningful right to life to have not only a meaningful existence but also robust health and vigour without which worker would lead a life of misery.”28 The evolution of the right to health of the workman as a part of his human right and the pervasion of modern technology and the various types of chemical substances with the foreign investment require the intervention of the State to ensure the safety, health and welfare of workers.\n\nThe brochure on Labour Standards and Relations issued by the BOI, prescribes the conditions subject to which the female workers could be employed on night shift.29 If these conditions are strictly adhered to, the employment of female workers on night shift will not have deleterious effects. The absolute prohibition of night work for the female workers may be a discrimination against them and may affect their chances of employment by discouraging the foreign investors. Therefore, in the context of foreign investment what is required is regularised night work for the female workers.\n\nEven though, the Sri Lankan legal system is enriched with labour legislation to protect the interests of the employees, there is hardly any legislation to protect the interests of the employers who are the investors. Hence, the existing labour statutes have to be amended to protect the interests of the investors, specially the foreign investors. If not, they will not have a conducive environment for investment.\n\nIn settlement by an Arbitrator or an Industrial Court or a Labour Tribunal, after conducting inquiries and hearing evidence, just and equitable award32 or just and equitable order33 is made. When the Labour Courts make just and equitable decisions they cannot treat the employees from a position of advantage.34 In Hatton National Bank v Perera, G.P.S.De Silva, Cj stated that the just and equitable order made by the Labour Tribunal must be fair and just by both parties.’5 Hence, when the Labour Courts make just and equitable decisions they have to consider the interests of the investors as well. The brochure36 requires the investors to provide a written contract of employment embodying the terms and conditions of employment.37 However, the Labour Courts are not fettered by the terms of the contract of employment in making just and equitable decisions.38\n\namended by the Industrial Disputes Amendment Act No 32 of 1990 provides time limits for the final disposal of cases by a Labour Tribunal,40 High Court,41 Court of Appeal,42 and the Supreme Court.43 However, these time constraints are considered as directory but not mandatory.44 Hence, appropriate measures including increasing the number of Labour Tribunals and the support staff shall be considered for the speedy disposal of labour cases, specially the cases for the termination of services. The establishment of Industrial Appellate Courts to hear the appeals from the Labour Courts also may contribute for the speedy disposal of labour cases. The introduction of mandatory disciplinary inquiry for disciplinary termination of employment also may contribute for the decrease of labour cases or the speedy disposal of labour cases.\n\nAn employer who appeals to the High Court against an order of a Labour Tribunal or makes an application for revision against any such order45 or makes an application for the issue of a writ against the President of a Labour Tribunal in respect of an order made by such President46 has to furnish to such Labour Tribunal, security in cash calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Act.47 This mandatory requirement imposes an unreasonable burden on the employer who wishes to question the legality of the just and equitable order made by the Labour Tribunal on appeal in the Appellate Court. When the Appellate Court decides in favour of the employer, the employer will receive the deposited money with mere bank interest. Since the time constraints for the final disposal of a case is not mandatory, when a case is decided after a long period of time, it becomes a monetary loss to the employer, even though he is successful in his appeal. An employer who terminates hundreds of employees and questions the order of the Tribunal may find it difficult to carry on his business after depositing the security in millions of rupees with the Tribunal. Hence, this requirement imposes an unreasonable burden on the employers who invest their capital and generate employment. It affects the local investors and the foreign investors as well.\n\nPayment of compensation for termination of employment of workmen is one of the important matters that require the attention of the policy makers. The Industrial Disputes Act48 and the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act49 which deal with awarding compensation for termination of employment do not prescribe any guide lines as to the calculation of compensation or the maximum limit of compensation that may be awarded. As to the calculation of compensation or the factors that have to be taken into consideration, in assessing the amount of compensation, the principles evolved from judicial decisions provide satisfactory guide lines.50 But it is submitted that when the compensation payable is assessed according to the principles evolved from\n\njudicial decisions, sometimes, the compensation payable may exceed even the wages of ten years. The payment of compensation calculated in accordance with the excessive number of years of service may be unjust and inequitable to the employer. Hence, it is desirable, if the legislature intervenes to prescribe the maximum limit of compensation that may be awarded for termination of employment.51 In Sri Lanka Cement Corporation v Rajes Pereira52 S.N.Silva.J observed that “it would be most useful to Labour Tribunals and the Appellate Courts if the maximum that may be awarded as compensation is laid down by statute in relation to easily discernible criteria such as years of service and monthly salary.”53\n\nThe Industrial Disputes Act provides guidelines as to payment of compensation as an alternative to reinstatement54 or in lieu of compensation.55 Even though the workman has an option for compensation in lieu of reinstatement56 an employer does not have any such option57 and he has to depend on the discretion of the Labour Courts to pay compensation as an alternative to reinstatement. If the Act is amended and the option is provided to the employer too, he can get rid of the employees on whom the employer has lost confidence by paying compensation in lieu of reinstatement.\n\nThe method of calculation of wages to the workmen is based on time-rate which does not encourage the workmen for optimum out put.58 The wage system which is devised to encourage the workmen for their optimum output will attract the foreign investors. Therefore, it is suggested that the method of calculation of wages shall be the combination of time-rated minimum fixed wages and the merit-rated wages based on the output.\n\nThe employees are entitled for holidays apart from weekly holidays, casual leave, annual leave, maternity leave for female employees and some times sick leave in some industries. In comparison with other countries that compete with our country in attracting foreign investment, in our country the number of holidays are very high. Hence, the number of holidays in Sri Lanka is another factor that requires the re-consideration of it in respect of removal of some holidays and the rationalisation of holidays in the context of present trend in attracting foreign investment.\n\nIt is widely believed that the employees in the EPZs are discouraged from forming trade unions. The law relating to the formation of a trade union and the trade union activities are applicable in the EPZs, as much as they are applicable in the rest of the country. After the recent amendment to the Industrial Disputes Act,59 imposing prohibition on the enjoyment of trade union rights by employees is an unfair labour practice and an offence for an employer.60\n\nWhile emphasising the trade union rights of the employees of the EPZs, the corresponding obligations of the employees when agitating for their rights, whether they are unionised as a trade union or not, is also emphasised. The methods adopted by the trade unions and the employees to demand for their just rights shall also be in disciplined manner. The criminal acts or unfair labour practices in the guise of trade union activities will drive away the present and future investors. The employees should be mindful that the disciplined labour force is also an important factor to attract foreign investment that generate employment.\n\nIn concluding this paper, it is appropriate to state that in employer-employee relationship the survival of one party depends on the survival of other. Therefore, the objective of the industrial law shall be balancing the interests of the parties.71 Hence, the industrial law cannot be static and it has to change with the march of time. If not, the industrial law will not achieve its objective. In Sri Lanka, in the present trend of industrial policy, the protection of the interests of the foreign investors draws special attention for the benefit of the present and future workforce of the country. To achieve this objective the industrial law of Sri Lanka requires the attention of the policy makers as discussed in this paper."
