        "text": "200 YEARS AGO\n\nNapoleon's next step\n\nWith his civil and religious annulments behind him, Napoleon's number-one priority was to marry again and ensure his succession. A secret Privy Council meeting was held on 21 January, 1810, in which Napoleon's advisers (including Cambac�r�s, Murat, Berthier, Champagny, Lebrun, Eug�ne, Talleyrand, Fontanes and Maret) presented their opinions on the three prospective brides: Maria Auguste, Princess of Saxony; the Grand Duchess, Anna Pavlovna, the youngest sister of Alexander I; and Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria.\n\nAccording to Cambac�r�s' memoirs, opinion was split between Anna Pavlovna (who had just turned fifteen) and Marie-Louise. However, Napoleon would go on to outline some concerns regarding the Russian duchess in a letter to Champagny dated 6 February, 1810:\n\n\"[It has been] observed that Princess Anne [is] not yet mature; occasionally it takes a couple of years for some girls to attain maturity having reached the marriageable age and the idea of waiting three years with no hope of conceiving a child goes against the intentions of the Emperor.\" [Letter from Napoleon to Champagny dated 6 February, 1810, Correspondance de Napol�on Ier, Second Empire edition; n� 16,210]\n\nMore concerning, however, was the fact that there had been no response of any sort from the Russian court, despite Napoleon's impression that the major stumbling block, Alexander's mother, Maria Feodorovna, had been removed (although against the marriage, Alexander's mother had decided to leave the ultimate decision to the Russian tsar). With time running out, Napoleon made a decision, writing again to Champagny that same night:\n\n\"Tomorrow evening [...] you will dispatch a letter to inform [the Russians] that I am decided in favour of the Austrian.\" [Letter from Napoleon to Champagny dated 6 February, 1810, Correspondance de Napol�on Ier, Second Empire edition; n� 16,211]\n\nPreparations began to pick up steam and instructions were dispatched for Louis-Guillaume Otto, the French ambassador to Austria:\n\n\"The letter with the marriage contract should arrive in Vienna on the thirteenth of this month; he [Otto] will then send another on the fourteenth with assurances of its ratification; this will arrive in Paris on the twenty-first. The Prince de Neuch�tel, who will be dispatched as ambassador extraordinaire to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage, will then be able to leave on the twenty-second; he will arrive in Vienna on the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth and will make the request the morning after his arrival. [...] The marriage will then be possible on 2 March [...] and the princess will leave on the seventh [...] in order to arrive in Paris towards the twenty-sixth.\" [Unsigned letter to Champagny dated 7 February, 1810, Correspondance de Napol�on Ier, Second Empire edition; n� 16,218]\n\nIn the event, proceedings unfolded much as planned and Marie-Louise arrived in Compi�gne on 27 March, 1810.\n\nThe Elephant and Bastille\n\nThe idea for a fountain at the Place de Bastille was floated by Napoleon as early as 1806. By 1808, it had crystalised, taking the form of huge elephant. And on 9 February, 1810, a new decree was issued, ordaining that:\n\n\"There will be erected, at the Place de la Bastille, a fountain in the form of a bronze elephant, smelted from canons taken from the Spanish insurgents; this elephant will bear a tower [upon its back] and will be as the ancients employed them; water will flow from its trunk. Measurements will be taken in order that the elephant be finished and unveiled now later than 2 December, 1811.\" [Decree issued by Napoleon, 9 February, 1810, Correspondance de Napol�on Ier, Second Empire edition; n� 16,233]\n\nThe project was conferred upon the sculptor Pierre-Charles Bridan, assisted by Jean-Antoine Alavoine, and the former went on to construct a scale-model in plaster measuring 14.6m in height and 16.2m in length. The huge beast was kept at a site close to the Place de la Bastille and was visited by Napoleon in 1813 but the project stalled and funding dwindled as the Empire's priorities turned towards survival. The elephant is probably best known for its role as Gavroche's lodgings in Victor Hugo's Les Mis�rables, in which the French author commented \"It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of timber and masonry, bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house, formerly painted green by some dauber, and now painted black by heaven, the wind, and time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of the place, the broad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his tower, his enormous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at night, under the starry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a sort of symbol of popular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and immense. It was some mighty, visible phantom, one knew not what, standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the Bastille.\" [Victor Hugo, Les Mis�rables, Book 6, chapter II \"In which little Gavroche extracts profit from Napoleon the Great\"] The model was finally destroyed, and the project abandoned, in July 1846.\n\nNapoleonica.org features a number of letters from the Denon archives, including a request for the statue artist to visit the menagerie at the Jardin des Plantes in order to study the elephant housed there, in preparation for a preliminary model for the fountain.\n\nWishing you an excellent \"Napoleonic\" week,\n\nPeter Hicks & Hamish Davey Wright\n\nHistorians and web-editors\n\nTHE NAPOLEON.ORG BULLETIN, N� 528, 5 - 11 February, 2010\n\nInterested in the work of the Fondation Napol�on?
