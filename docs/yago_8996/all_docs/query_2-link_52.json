        "text": "Joseph Bonaparte was the older brother of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nAfter his Napoleon became Emperor of the French, Joseph was made King of Naples during the Napoleonic Wars by his brother after Ferdinand IV betrayed Naples' neutrality with French, declaring support for Austria.\n\nAfter two years however, he was replaced by his brother in law, Joachim Murat. Joseph was then made King of Spain soon after.\n\nIn Spain, he was extremely unpopular. His arrival sparked the Peninsular War as the Spanish revolted against the French. Joseph offered to voluntarily abdicate but Napoleon refused, sending more troops to help him in the war.\n\nAfter the Allied forces led by Marquess of Wellington defeated the French at the Battle of Vitoria, Joseph abdicated. He was shortly given governance of Paris as the Allies close in around Paris, but Napoleon and the French Empire would eventually fall.\n\nHe was seen shortly as the legitimate Emperor of the French after the death of his nephew, Napoleon II.\n\nAfter the war, Joseph moved to Philadelphia Pennsylvania, in the United States. He also shortly lived in New Jersey. In 1844, he died in Florence, Tuscany and is survived today by his great great grandson .\n\nEmperors of the French\n\n(1804-1814; 1815; 1852-1870) Napoleon I • Napoleon II* • Napoleon III Kings of Spain\n\n(1808-1813) Joseph I Kings of Holland\n\n(1806-1810) Louis I • Louis II Kings of Naples\n\n(1806-1815) Joseph I • Joachim-Napoleon (Murat) Kings of Westphalia\n\n(1807-1813) Jérôme I Grand Duchesses of Tuscany\n\n(1809-1814) Elisa Bonaparte"
