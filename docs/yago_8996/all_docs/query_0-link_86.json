        "text": "Â p351Â Bibliographical Essay\n\nThe enormous literature on the Empress Josephine includes more than fifty biographies in several languages. In writing seriously about her a major difficulty is posed by the unreliable memoirs, the anecdotal trivia, and the garbled or manufactured letters that crowd the post-Napoleonic period. It is almost a rule that the better the story about Josephine the more unreliable its source will be. Within aÂ year of her death aÂ dozen pamphlets about her had appeared in Paris; one, for example, purported to contain her last will and testament. Spurious memoirs and letters, supposedly by Josephine, were printed inÂ 1820, provoking a quick protest from her son, EugÃ¨ne deÂ Beauharnais. InÂ 1828, nevertheless, the publishers outdid themselves by issuing an equally spurious three-volume set of her soâcalled memoirs. The memoirs of Madame Ducrest, a lady-inâwaiting to Josephine, which appeared inÂ 1828, and those of Mademoiselle Avrillon, her premiÃ¨re femme deÂ chambre, which appeared inÂ 1833, are typical examples of another sort of half-imaginative literature, as much the creation of the publishers as of their reputed authors. Josephine, it is clear, did not have the least interest during her retirement at Malmaison in writing her own memoirs. Though fluent and sympathetic in conversation, she had no part in that age of the Restoration in Europe when memoir-writing seemed to become a compulsive necessity and was without question a most lucrative source of funds. Not untilÂ 1857, when the biography by Joseph Aubenas appeared, could her life begin to be placed on some kind of respectable documentary foundation.\n\nSubstantial difficulties have existed, too, with the published correspondence. Scholars can now tabulate more than two hundred and fifty letters written by Napoleon to Josephine. While over two hundred of her personal letters (apart from the recommendations with which she tirelessly bombarded the ministries) are known, most of them are letters to her children. Not a single letter from Josephine to her first husband, Alexander deÂ Beauharnais, has survived; and those extant written by her to Napoleon can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The task of collecting the evidence has been made harder by editors, among them Josephine's daughter, Queen Hortense, and Josephine's grandson, NapoleonÂ III, who amended or scissored out from Napoleon's letters passages that might cast a shadow upon past glories or offend against midânineteenth-century propriety.\n\nÂ p352Â If Josephine has remained silent, her biographers have not. The first important documents appeared unexpectedly inÂ 1824. AÂ young Englishman, Charles Tennant, having made the Grand Tour, published his impressions in a twoâvolume work which bore the remarkable title, AÂ Tour Through Parts of the Netherlands, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Savoy and France, in the YearÂ 1821, Including a Description of the Rhine Voyage in the Middle of Autumn, and the Stupendous Scenery of the Alps in the Depth of Winter, by Charles Tennant,Â Esq. Also Containing, in an Appendix, FacÂ Simile Copies of Eight Letters in the Hand Writing of Napoleon Bonaparte to his Wife Josephine. These eight Napoleonic letters mark a new biographical beginning. Tennant explained that he had bought them from 'aÂ Polish nobleman who attached himself and all his fortunes to Bonaparte, whose confidence he enjoyed in several diplomatic negotiations'. The mysterious nobleman told Tennant that a servant had found the letters in a cupboard at Malmaison aÂ few days after Josephine's death, and had sold them to him. Tennant's published facsimiles were so skilfully done, both as to calligraphy and paper, that they have been known to be offered for sale as genuine Napoleonic autographs. Although Tennant's letters showed Bonaparte in an extraordinarily human and vivid light, at the time they attracted little attention.\n\nEight further letters from Bonaparte to Josephine were included in a multi-volume potpourri, MÃ©moires d'une contemporaine, published inÂ 1827, 'LaÂ Contemporaine' being the pseudonym of Ezelina vanÂ Aylde-Jonghe. These had a derivation curiously like that of the Tennant letters. They had been stolen by a valet deÂ chambre at Malmaison, sold to the Duchess of Courland, lent by her to Madame Genlis, and copied by her for the editor, Ladvocat, who published them. Both these groups of letters gave dramatic evidence of the young Bonaparte's ardent infatuation for Josephine and suggested that her life might be written as one of the great romances of history.\n\nThe next important publication seemed to weaken this possibility. InÂ 1833 appeared at Paris the two volumes, Lettres deÂ NapolÃ©on Ã JosÃ©phine pendant laÂ premiÃ¨re campagne d'Italie, le Consulat et l'EmpireÂ : et lettres deÂ JosÃ©phine Ã NapolÃ©on et Ã sa fille. Published under the sponsor­ship of Queen Hortense, the volumes contained over two hundred letters from Napoleon to Josephine, seventy letters from Josephine to Hortense, but only two from Josephine to her husband. The ardent letters that Tennant had published inÂ 1824 were emphatically not included, and it is now clear that many Â p353Â in this 1833Â collection had undergone rigorous pruning. Although three of Napoleon's early love letters to Josephine were printed by FranÃ§ois Gilbert deÂ Coston in his heavily documented Biographie des premiÃ¨res annÃ©es deÂ NapolÃ©on Bonaparte (2Â vols., Paris, 1840), in general little notice seems to have been taken of them.\n\nNapoleonic studies were soon furthered by the march of events. In DecemberÂ 1848 Louis-NapolÃ©on Bonaparte, grandson of Josephine and at the same time nephew of Napoleon, was elected president of the Second French Republic. Soon emperor, he was eager to recapture the glories of his great predecessor. Hence, inÂ 1854, the decision was made to set up a commission that would assemble and edit the correspondence of NapoleonÂ I. ByÂ 1858 the first volume of what ultimately to be a sumptuous thirtyâtwo-volume official collection was published. It is here that Charles Tennant, silent sinceÂ 1824, reappears.\n\nIn MayÂ 1858 one of the editorial commissioners, Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e, received the visit of a handsome English lady accompanied by her husband, a MrÂ Tennant, 'of a respectable age', a formerÂ M.Â P. He had in his possession eight letters of Bonaparte, seven of them to Josephine, and would, he said, be prepared to sell them for eight thousand francs. On investigating the letters, MÃ©rimÃ©e had no doubts of their authenticity; yet he had other qualms. 'They are,' he reported to Marshal Vaillant, minister of war and president of the commission, 'very burning love letters, written during the first Italian campaign. It is a question of hardly anything but kisses, in places the names of which are not found in the Dictionary of the French Academy.'​*\n\nWhat Vaillant replied to MÃ©rimÃ©e, or how anxiously the nine members of the commission may have scrutinized these letters, or what was the fate of the originals, we do not know, but the policy of the commission had already been determined. Tennant's letters were not included and, as it turned out, all but two of the ninety-three letters from Napoleon to Josephine eventually printed in the official Correspondance were those previously available in the Hortense edition ofÂ 1833.\n\nThe industry of individual scholars was able to make good what governmental documentation failed to provide. Joseph Aubenas, who had lived for several years as an official in Martinique, made use of important island sources and also had access to papers in the Tascher deÂ laÂ Pagerie family, these including some early letters Â p354Â from Josephine to her parents that shed much light on the troubles of her first marriage. His two volumes, Histoire deÂ l'impÃ©ratrice JosÃ©phine (Paris, 1857), stand out as the only substantial study of Josephine before we come to the last decade of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe name of FrÃ©dÃ©ric Masson first appears inÂ 1895 when he published two articles on Josephine in the Revue deÂ Paris. Masson was an extraordinary character. AÂ republican by family tradition, he had held a state scholar­ship as a young student in the 1860s because of his father's death on the streets of Paris during the June days of the Revolution ofÂ 1848. Masson, nevertheless, became an ardent and almost mystically dedicated Bonapartist. Those who wish to savour fully the Bonapartism of this perpetual secretary of the French Academy should read his prefaces, most especially that to NapolÃ©on et les femmes (1894), in which Masson tells of how as a boy he had listened to the stories of old Napoleonic veterans and had been allowed by them to touch the very scars of their ancient wounds. Masson saw no incongruity in comparing Napoleon to the Son of Man and in capitalizing, during moments of deep emotion, the pronouns with which he referred to him.\n\nThe profound devotion which Masson had to the name of Napoleon left little room for any corresponding affection for the name of Beauharnais, and so along with his studies of the Bonaparte family he felt impelled to reâexamine the career of Josephine in order to determine whether she was worthy of the place which tradition and family piety had come to assign to her. After aÂ quarter of a century of labour and the publication of four searching volumes of biography â JosÃ©phine deÂ Beauharnais (1898); Madame Bonaparte (1920) ; JosÃ©phine impÃ©ratrice et reine (1899); JosÃ©phine rÃ©pudiÃ©e (1900)Â â he found, in the simplest possible summary, that she was not. AÂ lifetime devoted to the history of the Bonaparte family, a lifetime which resulted in the writing of some thirty-five volumes, made it possible for Masson to accumulate an extraordinary collection of manuscript materials and a staggeringly encyclopedic knowledge of the printed sources. It is, parenthetically, another curiosity of Masson that in all his volumes he invariably refused to cite these sources which, one must concede, were impressive enough. The Fonds Masson in the BibliothÃ¨que Thiers at Paris â the old home of Thiers in the Place Saint-Georges â consists of 586Â cartons, portfolios, registers, and bundles of material assembled by Masson, much of it bearing directly upon Josephine and for the most part incorporated in his various studies. No student can possibly ignore Â p355Â Masson's scholar­ly work; yet few today would accept the entire validity of his approach or of his conclusions.\n\nContemporaneously with Masson's writing the Martinique historian, RenÃ© Pichevin, published his ImpÃ©ratrice JosÃ©phine at Paris inÂ 1909. Like Aubenas, he had access to a good many family papers, some of them unknown to Masson, and he used these to make a strong defence of Josephine. His title is misleading, for the work goes only to the time of Josephine's return to France from Martinique inÂ 1790. Hector Fleischmann's JosÃ©phine infidÃ¨le (Paris, 1910) must be listed, if only because it qualifies as being easily the most savage of all the attacks directed against her. Joseph Turquan's LaÂ GÃ©nÃ©rale Bonaparte (Paris, 1895) and his ImpÃ©ratrice JosÃ©phine (Paris, 1896) are only somewhat less hostile.\n\nSince Masson's death inÂ 1923 scholars have continued their labours. Edouard Driault's biography (Paris, 1928) is the sympathetic work of a good Napoleonic scholar. The elaborate biography of the Marquis deÂ Sainte-Croix deÂ laÂ RonciÃ¨re, JosÃ©phine impÃ©ratrice des franÃ§ais (Paris, 1934), though showing a wide local knowledge of Martinique and having splendid illustrations, reproduces with astonishing lack of critical judgement some of the most flagrant forgeries of theÂ 1820s. In contrast to this, the two volumes of Jean Hanoteau on the Beauharnais family, JosÃ©phine avant BonaparteÂ : le MÃ©nage Beauharnais (Paris, 1935), and Les Beauharnais et l'Empereur (Paris, 1936), are models of accurate scholar­ship and permit us to question in many respects the very hostile interpretations of Masson. In his first volume Hanoteau used the highly revealing letters of Alexander deÂ Beauharnais preserved in the Tascher deÂ laÂ Pagerie archives at the chÃ¢teau of Petit-Fresnoy and in the BibliothÃ¨que Thiers to demonstrate, as Masson had not been able to do, the heavy burdens that Alexander imposed upon his wife. In the second volume he printed seventy-three letters from JosÃ©phine to EugÃ¨ne preserved in the Leuchtenberg Archives at Munich, adding very substantially to the seventyâtwo letters of Josephine in the 1833Â collection authorized by Hortense. These significantly enlarge our knowledge of Josephine's later years and particularly of the period of Napoleon's downfall. AndrÃ© Gavoty's Les Amoureux deÂ l'impÃ©ratrice JosÃ©phine (Paris, 1961), on the other hand, though embellished with the outward appearance of scholar­ship, seems to proceed on the assumption that if a story of scandal about Josephine has once appeared in print it must be true. The most workmanlike biography of Josephine in English, devoid of any attempt at fine writing, still remains PhilipÂ W. Sergeant's The Â p356Â Empress Josephine, Napoleon's Enchantress first appearing in Hutchinson's Library of Standard Lives (NewÂ York, 1909). The recent biography of Hubert Cole, JosÃ©phine (NewÂ York, 1962), appeared after the manuscript of this volume had been called.\n\nWith three exceptions, no attempt is made here to include any of the enormous literature dealing directly with Napoleon. Arthur LÃ©vy's Napoleon intime (Paris, 1898) brings one very close to the great Emperor. Louis Garros's ItinÃ©raire deÂ NapolÃ©on Bonaparte (Paris, 1947) is an invaluable day-byâday record of Napoleon's movements, almost as useful for a study of Josephine as it is for a study of the Emperor. And the first of the seven volumes of Friedrich Kircheisen's monumental NapoleonÂ I, sein Leben und seine Zeit (Munich, 1911) contains in chapterÂ XVIII a sensible, sympathetic, and balanced judgement upon Josephine by one of the very greatest Napoleonic scholars.\n\nFor nearly a century the only edition of Napoleon's letters to Josephine was that authorized by Queen Hortense inÂ 1833. LÃ©on Cerf, Lettres deÂ Napoleon Ã JosÃ©phine (Paris, 1929), brought this material into upâtoâdate form by including the letters previously omitted or garbled. This work is now superseded by Jacques Bourgeat, NapolÃ©on: lettres Ã JosÃ©phine (Paris, 1941) which gives 254Â letters, in many cases establishing the full text of documents previously printed. Bourgeat is the most convenient edition to use, though unfortunately aÂ few of the later letters are wrongly dated. Jean Savant, NapolÃ©on et JosÃ©phine. PremiÃ¨re Ã©dition intÃ©grale, avec deÂ nombreux inÃ©dits, des lettres deÂ NapolÃ©on Ã JosÃ©phine (Paris, 1955), raises the total of Napoleon's letters toÂ 265. He includes many facsimiles and corrects Bourgeat's mistakes in dating. Savant, unfortunately, does not limit himself to his editorial duties but carries on a ceaseless attack upon the character and morals of Josephine as he also does in his NapolÃ©on et Josephine, leur roman (Paris, 1960). Incomplete English translations of the letters, made from earlier editions and of mediocre quality, have been published by J.Â S.Â C.Â Abbott (NewÂ York, 1856), H.Â F.Â Hall (London, 1901), and H.Â W.Â Bunn (NewÂ York, 1931).\n\nScholarship has steadily enlarged our knowledge of the circle within which Josephine moved and thus has enriched the picture we have of her. Constance Wright's Daughter to Napoleon (NewÂ York, 1961) gives a graceful account of Hortense deÂ Beauharnais. Research of another sort has evaluated Josephine's association with the arts, particularly as seen in the galleries, the furnishings, and the gardens of Malmaison. References to these materials will be Â p357Â included in subsequent appropriate paragraphs. Such works, in contrast to the imitative and repetitive biographies of which seemingly there is no end, give stature and respectability to the field of Josephine studies.\n\nFor the background at Martinique the following, in addition to the biographies of Aubenas and Pichevin, are useful: CabuzelÂ A. Banbuck, Histoire politique, Ã©conomique et sociale deÂ laÂ Martinique sous l'ancien rÃ©gime (Paris, 1935); S.Â Daney, Histoire deÂ laÂ Martinique (4Â vols., Fort-Royal, 1846â7), especially vol.Â IV; and Gabriel Hanotaux and Alfred Martineau, Histoire des colonies franÃ§aises (6Â vols., Paris, 1929â33), vol.Â I. Jean Baptiste Thibault deÂ Chanvallon, Voyage Ã laÂ Martinique (Paris, 1763), has a most valuable contemporary appreciation of creole life. J.Â Gabriel, Essai biographique sur Madame Tascher deÂ laÂ Pagerie (Paris, 1856), describes Josephine's mother. Anecdotes about Josephine's girlhood will be found in: Louise Cochelet, MÃ©moires (4Â vols., Paris, 1836â8); Marie Anne Lenormand, MÃ©moires historiques et secrÃ¨tes (2Â vols., Paris, 1818â22); Jean Gabriel deÂ Montgaillard, Souvenirs (Paris, 1895); and Claude Augustin deÂ Tercier, MÃ©moires politiques et militaires (Paris, 1891). An account of AimÃ©e duÂ Buc deÂ Rivery, as fantastic as the author's title, is given in Lesley Blanch, The Wilder Shores of Love (NewÂ York, 1954).\n\nThe most important source for Josephine's life to the time of the Revolution, is the correspondence of Alexander deÂ Beauharnais printed in Jean Hanoteau's LeÂ MÃ©nage Beauharnais (Paris, 1935). Theodore Iung , Bonaparte et son temps, 1769â1799, d'aprÃ¨s des documents inÃ©dits (2Â vols., Paris, 1881), prints in vol. I Josephine's marriage certificate and the baptismal certificates of EugÃ¨ne and Hortense. The original documents concerning the separation are in AN,Â Y,Â 13,795, printed in Caroline d'Arjuzon, JosÃ©phine contre Beauharnais (Paris, 1906). For the social circle of Fanny deÂ Beauharnais see: F.Â K.Â Turgeon, 'Fanny deÂ Beauharnais. Biographical Notes and a Bibliography', Modern Philology, August,Â 1932; Alfred Marquiset, Les basâbleus duÂ premier Empire (Paris, 1913); M.Â Foucaux [Mary Summer], Quelques salons deÂ Paris au dix-huitiÃ¨me siÃ¨cle (Paris, n.Â d.).

For the imprisonment see: Almanach des prisons, ou anecdotes sur la rÃ©gime intÃ©rieure deÂ laÂ Conciergerie, duÂ Luxembourg,Â etc., et sur diffÃ©rens prisonniersÂ .Â .Â . (Paris [1794]); CharlesÂ A.

AÂ good deal of information can be derived from: Joseph Bonaparte, MÃ©moires et correspondance (10Â vols., Paris, 1854â8), vol.Â I; Jean Nicolas Bouilly, Mes RÃ©capitulations (2Â vols., Paris, 1836â7), vol.Â II; and from the memoirs of Hortense and EugÃ¨ne where the story of Alexander deÂ Beauharnais's sword gets strong confirmation. The soâcalled MÃ©moires deÂ Barras (4Â vols., Paris, 1895â6), though vivid, are a savagely hostile compilation concocted by Barras and others at a much later date. Some interesting details of Paris by an English visitor are given in Helen Maria Williams, AÂ Tour in Switzerland (London, 1898). Copies of aÂ few letters from Josephine to her mother in this period are in BN, Nouv. acq.Â fr., 9324. AÂ copy of the marriage contract and of the marriage register is in the BibliothÃ¨que Thiers, Fonds Masson,Â 28, also printed in the Revue des Ã©tudes napolÃ©oniennes for AprilÂ 1936.\n\nFor further details, chiefly concerning the marriage and Josephine's home on the rue Chantereine see: Gustave Bord and Louis Bigard, LaÂ Maison duÂ 'dixâhuit brumaire' (Paris, 1930; G.Â LenÃ´tre [pseud. of Louis Gosselin], Paris rÃ©volutionnaire: vieilles maisons, vieux papiers. 1Ã¨re sÃ©rie (Paris, 1905); Henri Clouzot, 'Un soir deÂ ventÃ´se anÂ IV Ã l'hÃ´tel deÂ Mondragon,' Revue des Ã©tudes napolÃ©oniennes, JulyÂ 1935; Georges Mauguin, L'ImpÃ©ratrice JosÃ©phineÂ : anecdotes et curiositÃ©s (Paris, 1954).\n\nInformation about Josephine's first married years comes indirectly Â p359Â from Napoleon's letters to her.

Bonaparte's affair in Egypt with Marguerite FourÃ¨s is described by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Masson in his NapolÃ©on et les femmes (Paris, 1904). Seven letters from Josephine to Barras running from SeptemberÂ 1796 to AprilÂ 1799 were first published by Alberto Lumbroso in his Miscellanea Napoleonica, sÃ©rieÂ V (Rome, 1898). The most complete account of the coup of Brumaire is in Albert Vandal's classic AvÃ¨nement deÂ Bonaparte (2Â vols., Paris, 1907â8).\n\nThe general pattern of life under the Consulate is described in Henri d'AlmÃ©ras, LaÂ Vie Parisienne sous le Consulat et l'Empire (Paris [1909]); Gilbert Stenger, LaÂ SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise pendant le Consulat (6Â vols., Paris, 1903â8); G.Â LenÃ´tre [pseud. of Louis Gosselin], Les Tuileries (Paris, 1933).

An official Catholic account by the AbbÃ© Louis GrÃ©goire, LeÂ 'Divorce' deÂ NapolÃ©on et deÂ l'impÃ©ratrice JosÃ©phine, Ãtude duÂ dossier canonique (Paris, 1957), disagrees with Welschinger on many points and claims that the officiality of the Paris diocese acted properly according to Gallican law in recognizing that the Senate had already annulled the civil marriage. RenÃ© Pichevin has a brief pamphlet, LeÂ Mariage deÂ l'empereur (Paris,Â n.Â d.), arguing that the whole proceedings were illegal and improper. FrÃ©dÃ©ric Masson also describes the divorce Â p362Â at considerable length in his Quatre confÃ©rences sur JosÃ©phine (Paris, 1924). In addition to vivid accounts of the crisis in the memoirs of Bausset, Constant, and Madame deÂ RÃ©musat, previously cited, see also Antoine Marie deÂ Lavalette, MÃ©moires et souvenirs (2Â vols., Paris, 1831), vol.Â II.

The report of her autopsy is printed in FrÃ©dÃ©ric Masson, JosÃ©phine rÃ©pudiÃ©e (Paris, 1900), p361n. Jean Bourguignon, Les Adieux deÂ Malmaison (Paris, 1930), has a brief account of Napoleon's visit to Malmaison after Waterloo. Guy Ledoux-Lebard's meticulous account of the funeral monument erected by EugÃ¨ne and Hortense to Josephine's memory inÂ 1825 in the church at Rueil, 'Le Tombeau deÂ l'impÃ©ratrice JosÃ©phine Ã Rueil', is in Bulletin deÂ laÂ SociÃ©tÃ© deÂ l'Histoire deÂ l'Art franÃ§ais (1956).
