Following the Revolution of 1789, many members of the French aristocracy crossed the ocean to escape the guillotine. Less than twenty years later, a second wave of French émigrés would arrive—the generals, soldiers, sympathizers of Napoleon, who sought a safe haven following the final defeat at Waterloo. Among these was the emperor’s oldest brother, Joseph (1768–1844), ex-King of Naples and Spain.\n\nIt comes as a surprise to most people that Joseph Bonaparte spent more than seventeen years in exile, living in splendor high above the banks of the Delaware River in New Jersey. Even before his escape from France in 1815 he had American connections. When negotiating the peace treaty of 1800 between Napoleon and the United States, he had met the leading diplomats of the day at his château of Mortefontaine, outside Paris. Before leaving Europe, he had acquired vast tracts of land in upstate New York. He arrived in America with a fortune in hand, and would shortly embark upon building and fitting out the magnificent estate he would call Point Breeze.\n\nBut as his friend Madame de Staël wrote when banished from France, Exile acts on imagination and constantly presents itself as an obstacle to all desires, all plans, all hopes. Joseph would never cease to long for his homeland. An intelligent man who knew French, Italian, and Spanish, he would never manage to learn English adequately, even after living in his adopted country for over seventeen years. He never wished to become an American citizen, and even in the elegant setting of Point Breeze, surrounded by cultured, gifted new friends and neighbors, he continually dreamed of returning to France. Although he would repeatedly plead with his wife to join him, he had never been a faithful husband, and this amorous man would find other loves. But he felt the separation from his two daughters keenly.\n\nJoseph claimed that he had never wanted the overpowering roles thrust upon him by his illustrious younger brother Napoleon. Left to his own devices, he would probably have been a lawyer in his native Corsica, a country gentleman with leisure to read the great literature he treasured and time to oversee the maintenance of his property. When Napoleon’s downfall forced Joseph into exile, he was able to become that country gentleman at last, but far away from so much he held dear.\n\nWhat follows is the story of a man who was nevertheless able to turn the memories of his and his family’s glorious and tumultuous recent past to his advantage—and, as it happened, to the advantage of his adopted home as well. For the superb collection of European art that Joseph had shipped to America to embellish the estate at Point Breeze made of that house the finest gallery of its kind by far in the young country, one that served to educate and influence generations of aspiring artists. In that sense at least, his exile was indeed beneficial for Americans. Ever glancing back at his beloved France, the man who had been king and whose brother had been an emperor helped to shape the fabric of the new republic.\n\nFate will serve you well, but you will be good to fate.\n\n—Madame de Staël to Joseph Bonaparte, Coppet, 18 September 1804\n\nYou have proved, Sire, that you know how to be worthily the citizen of a republic.\n\n—Victor Hugo to Joseph Bonaparte, Paris, 27 February 1833\n\nWhat dethroned monarch has been more fortunate than he to fall in such a way? Generally they have become beggars for aid, or pensioners, or prisoners. This is a change rather than a fall.\n\n—Joseph Hopkinson to Louis Mailliard, Philadelphia, 18 April 1837\n\nChapter 1 A NEW LIFE\n\nWe are disgusted to learn that an officer of the American Navy is in the company of this Corsican Adventurer.\n\n—United States Gazette, 15 September 1815\n\nIn the early morning of 25 July 1815, as the small American brigantine Commerce attempted to slip away on a favorable tide from the coast of France just over a month after Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, the British warship Bacchus loomed out of the fog and blocked its passage. Officers of the English ship came aboard to examine the passports of a Spaniard, an American, and a Monsieur Surviglieri, who kept to his cabin. As the officers knew that the deposed emperor Napoleon was already aboard the Bellerophon, headed for England, they did not press their investigation of the mysterious Frenchman. Thus Joseph Bonaparte, ex-king of Naples and Spain and Napoleon’s older brother (see plate 1), evaded detection on his way to self-imposed exile in the United States. Had Joseph remained in France, he would have been executed by the restored Bourbon, King Louis XVIII, or, if captured by the Allies, deported to a remote part of Russia.\n\nJoseph’s entourage included his Spanish ordinance officer, Unzaga, his American interpreter James Carret, his cook François Parrot, and his twenty-year-old secretary Louis Mailliard. Joseph left behind his wife and two daughters in Paris at the Luxembourg Palace where they had been living. He had chosen escape to a new though uncertain existence in America rather than share his brother’s fate in surrendering to the English, as several of Napoleon’s generals had done. He could go with a clear conscience since he had offered to pretend to be Napoleon, feigning illness and keeping to his bed in the inn at Rochefort, while the real Napoleon escaped to America on the ship Joseph had chartered. But Napoleon had refused his brother’s offer, not wanting to put Joseph in danger of arrest and believing it beneath his dignity as emperor of France to leave his country in disguise. He preferred to place himself at the mercy of the English. Joseph would blame himself for encouraging this decision, which may have been the result of his own earlier friendship with Lord Cornwallis while negotiating the Treaty of Amiens, a short-lived agreement of peace between France and England in 1802. Cornwallis had refused to deal with the wily Marquis de Talleyrand, Napoleon’s foreign minister, but he and Joseph had hit it off famously, no doubt giving the latter a warmer feeling about the English.\n\nThe Bonaparte family was originally from Corsica. The father, Carlo Buonaparte, when an eighteen-year-old law student at Pisa University, left his studies for an arranged marriage to the fourteen-year-old Marie-Letizia Ramolino on 2 June 1764. Both families had pretensions to nobility. The Buonapartes traced their lineage to Florence where they were members of the small ruling noble class. Carlo’s ancestor, Guglielmo di Buonaparte, had, as a nobleman, been a member of the Ghibelline-controlled municipal council of the city in the thirteenth century. When the opposite party, the Guelphs, took over Florence, he and his family fled to Sarzana and eventual impoverishment. In the sixteenth century, Guglielmo’s descendant, Francesco di Buonaparte, sailed to Corsica for a new life.¹ Joseph’s mother’s family, the Ramolinos, descended from noble Lombard antecedents and established in Corsica for 250 years, was decidedly more aristocratic, although as poor financially as the Buonapartes.\n\nJoseph (Giuseppe Buonaparte—Napoleon would change the spelling to Bonaparte) was born on 7 January 1768 at Corte, Corsica, the eldest of eight children. Napoleon was his next younger brother, born on 15 August 1769. Next came Lucien (1775–1840) (fig. 1), by far the most politically radical of the brothers, but in many ways the most sincere in his beliefs. Lucien always felt that Napoleon turned his back on the principles of the French Revolution when he declared himself emperor of the French. After the death of Lucien’s first wife, Christine Boyer, he had married, much to Napoleon’s fury, Alexandrine de Bleschamps Jouberthou, a widow, yet from a noble family. Napoleon, at that point First Consul of France, had wanted his brothers and sisters to marry European royalty in order to cement the empire he planned. He repeatedly petitioned Lucien to divorce his wife, but to no avail. Lucien held fast to his devotion to Alexandrine and to their son, Charles-Lucien. Although Lucien and Alexandrine were married five months after the child’s birth in 1803, Napoleon always considered him illegitimate and refused both father and son a place in the line of succession of his proposed empire. Charles-Lucien was Napoleon’s oldest nephew and should have been his potential heir until Napoleon had a son of his own, eight years later. Furious at his brother’s attitude, Lucien fled to Italy. When Napoleon made life especially vexing for him there, he attempted to escape to America with his entire family—by then there were other children by Alexandrine, as well as his two daughters by Christine Boyer. But the family was captured by the British and taken to Malta, then to England, where they spent three years until Napoleon’s exile to Elba made possible their return to Italy. Lucien returned to Paris to support his brother during the hundred days of the emperor’s rule after his escape from Elba, but by July 1815 Lucien was imprisoned in Turin. In a few months he would be released.\n\n1. Portrait of Lucien Bonaparte by François Xavier Fabre. Oil on canvas.

After Napoleon’s abdication, she moved to Trieste. Another brother, Louis (1778–1846), one-time king of Holland under Napoleon, had married Hortense de Beauharnais, daughter of Napoleon’s wife Josephine, but the marriage had been a disaster from the start. They had been separated for some time, with Hortense living in Switzerland and Louis established in Florence. Pauline (1780–1825), the family beauty and inveterate flirt, first married General C. V. E. Leclerc and accompanied him to Saint Domingue (modern-day Haiti) where Leclerc died of yellow fever. After Pauline returned to Paris she married the Italian prince, Camillo Borghese, and lived in Rome. Joseph’s youngest sister, Caroline (1782–1839), was the wife of Joachim Murat, Napoleon’s daring and flamboyant marshal whom he had made king of Naples. Murat later betrayed the emperor to the Austrians and died on 13 October 1815 by a Neapolitan firing squad. Joseph’s youngest brother, Jérôme (1784–1860), whose marriage to an American from Baltimore was annulled by Napoleon, later married Catherine of Württemberg. With his second wife, Jérôme now lived, a virtual prisoner, in Trieste.\n\nThe year Carlo and Marie-Letizia’s first child, Joseph, was born, the Republic of Genoa, after tiring of the fight against the independence-seeking Corsicans led by Pasquale Paoli, sold the island to France. The following year, on 8 May 1769, Paoli was defeated by the French at the battle of Ponte Nuovo, and among his supporters Carlo with his wife and small child fled into the mountains toward Corte. When Paoli surrendered, the young couple returned to their home in Ajaccio by way of a rugged mountain route. To the end of her life Letizia remembered carrying Joseph in her arms while pregnant with Napoleon, staggering and slipping along precipitous paths.²\n\nThroughout Joseph’s childhood and youth the issue of the family’s bona fide aristocracy was extremely important. In order to secure a free education for his children in France it was necessary for his father to prove the Buonapartes’ noble lineage. The French military governor of Corsica, Charles René, Count de Marbeuf and a favorite of Louis XV’s, was instrumental in arranging Carlo’s job as deputy for the nobility representing Corsica at Versailles in 1777. While he was away obtaining the necessary endorsements for his children, the beautiful young Letizia reputedly had an affair with the sixty-year-old governor, perhaps to further secure her children’s educational plans. Marbeuf, a noted womanizer whose virility belied his age, had conveniently left his wife behind in Paris.³ Carlo, too, had a history of dalliances; with his charm and attractive looks he was apparently a ladies’ man, a trait his oldest son would inherit.\n\nThus, by various means, the necessary noble credentials were presented, and Joseph and Napoleon were sent to school at Autun on the mainland to learn French. Afterward, Joseph was to study for the priesthood at Aix-en-Provence while Napoleon would be sent to military school. Before he left Autun, however, Joseph decided to abandon his religious studies to join the military. Napoleon was furious at this move, for by law the two brothers were not allowed to have the same career and Napoleon would need to change his plans. In a long letter to an uncle, the precocious fourteen-year-old Napoleon attempted to persuade his relative to squelch Joseph’s new ambition. He lacks the necessary boldness to face the perils of battle, Napoleon wrote of his older brother, adding a patent falsehood: his feeble health could never sustain the rigours of a campaign. The catalogue of Joseph’s shortcomings was extensive: ignorance of mathematics would keep him from the artillery and Joseph’s frivolous character and extravagant habits would be his downfall. Joseph had to be persuaded to become an ecclesiastic, the younger brother concluded, for his education and talents would one day make him a bishop.⁴ (Apparently a frivolous character and extravagant habits were no impediment to becoming a bishop.) Not only was an ecclesiastical career far from Joseph’s inclinations but most Corsicans, although nominally Catholic, were uninterested in organized religion, believing more in luck, destiny, and fate than in the doctrines of original sin or damnation or a Christian God.⁵ Although Joseph at times attended mass, he was essentially indifferent to the Church.\n\nAs it turned out, Joseph’s plans for a military career were derailed by the death of his father. Joseph promised Carlo on his deathbed that he would return to Corsica to take care of his mother and six younger siblings. So after spending a few weeks at Aix with his uncle, Joseph Fesch, his mother’s half-brother, who was studying for the priesthood and, as a cardinal under Napoleon, would acquire extravagant habits, he set sail for Corsica.\n\nAt home, Joseph assumed management of the family’s olive groves, orange and mulberry trees, vineyards, and vegetable gardens. It was probably during this period that he developed a lifelong love of gardening and agriculture.⁶ At the same time he worked out plans for a career in the law like that of his father. Always a serious student, Joseph took full advantage of his father’s library and read deeply while preparing for his vocation. When Napoleon came home on leave, Joseph left to attend the university at Pisa. In May 1788, having passed his examinations, he received the degree of doctor in civil and canon law.\n\nBack in Corsica, as a young man of twenty, he describes in his memoirs a particular day when he and Napoleon rode horseback from Ajaccio to Orezzo where Joseph had been chosen to represent the district of Ajaccio at a meeting. As they rode slowly along, Napoleon was preoccupied with the maneuvers and strategic positions of ancient warriors who for so many years had fought over the countryside, while Joseph reports that his own thoughts focused on the singularity and beauty of the landscape.⁷\n\nJoseph was making a name for himself in Corsica under the French, having been selected by the mayor of Ajaccio as his assistant. Within the year he was qualified to plead before the high court at Bastia and he soon became the protégé of the secretary general of the Corsican parliament. Napoleon had gone back to France but, unfortunately, he returned for a few months, only to unsettle Joseph’s life through his passionate adherence to Corsican nationalism. The French Revolution in 1789 caused chaos in Corsica where Joseph, as a moderate, worked to establish order. Meanwhile, the French National Assembly invited General Paoli to return from exile in England to govern the island. Joseph was with the delegation that sailed to Marseilles to bring him back to Corsica.⁸\n\nSeveral years later, the conflict that Napoleon had been stirring up with Paoli ever since the latter’s return to Corsica erupted. In 1792 Napoleon campaigned for the job of commander of the volunteer battalions in Ajaccio, opposing Joseph’s friend and Paoli’s endorsed candidate, Pozzo di Borgo, whose family had rented the third floor of the Buonapartes’ house in Ajaccio for years. A series of disastrous events—exacerbated by Joseph and Napoleon’s brother Lucien, a radical Jacobin who accused Paoli of treason—led to the flight of the entire Buonaparte family to the mainland. They landed at Toulon on 13 June 1793. In France, it was the year of the Terror and it behooved Joseph and the others to renounce any pretensions to nobility and to be designated simply citizen. On Corsica, the Buonapartes’ house and properties were sacked. Considering the times, it was something of a saving grace that the whole family was impoverished.\n\nJoseph soon set off for Paris to obtain money for them as patriot refugees. Corsican deputies of the Convention paved his way to the Administration where he solicited and was granted a relief fund for Corsican exiles. He also urged the government to send troops to drive the English from Corsica. For himself, he secured a job as commissaire de guerre, in charge of provisioning the army, with a salary of 6,000 francs a year, the usual black market deals, and more salary added when he was appointed commissioner to the Executive Committee of the Department of Corsica.⁹ The bloodbath then taking place in Paris between the ultra-Jacobin party and the moderate Girondists goes unnoted in his memoirs, except for the assassination of Marat by Charlotte Corday. Several months later Joseph returned to his family in Toulon. Civil war by that time was raging in the south and he was fortunate to have secured a military post. At this point he seems to have assumed the role of an ardent republican, espousing the revolutionary government of Robespierre.\n\nAware that the Girondist faction (moderate republicans) was preparing to cede Toulon to the English, Joseph moved his family near Marseilles. While there, supporting his mother and younger siblings, Joseph met the charming sixteen-year-old Désirée Clary, daughter of a rich merchant. He had been influential in freeing a family member from prison, and soon became an intimate of the Clary household. The Clarys’ wealth made them subject to confiscation of their property and incarceration, and they were deeply grateful for the handsome young officer’s assistance. Before long Joseph proposed to Désirée. When he brought Napoleon to visit the Clarys, however, his brash younger brother almost immediately claimed her for himself, suggesting in all seriousness that Joseph court her older sister, Julie (fig. 2). Joseph seems to have acquiesced without much argument, perhaps thinking that it would be doubly advantageous for the brothers to both marry the well-dowried sisters. Julie was plainer, but more serious, and she was already in love with Joseph. They were married on 1 August 1794. Napoleon’s affair with Désirée went on for a while, but he would gradually drift away and in time would marry Rose (Josephine) de Beauharnais. Désirée would marry General Jean-Baptiste-Jules Bernadotte and become his consort as Queen of Sweden.\n\nJoseph performed a variety of diplomatic and political undertakings for Napoleon, proving himself quite useful to his younger brother. The following year Joseph went on a mission to Genoa in connection with plans for the French recovery of Corsica. Later, he accompanied Napoleon in the early part of the Italian campaign, by which time Napoleon had become a powerful general, and was personally involved in the French expedition to win back Corsica. There Joseph helped the commissioner of the French republic, Miot de Melito, in the island’s political reorganization. In 1797, Joseph was elected to the Council of Five Hundred, but was soon involved in a diplomatic career as French consul to the court of Parma. But Napoleon, now in a place of power, saw to it that his older brother was appointed minister to Rome. His assignment was to overthrow papal secular order, replacing it with French control under the guise of a Roman Republic. In the Holy City where he was to encourage revolutionary movements, Joseph barely escaped assassination when a riot broke out before the embassy that resulted in the death of the French general Léonard Duphot, his sister Pauline’s fiancé.\n\n2.

Musée National du Château de Versailles.\n\nBack in Paris, his coffers swelled by handsome bribes and gifts, Joseph bought the estate of Mortefontaine, subsequently spending hundreds of thousands of francs on embellishing the château and buying additional land. By the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire (19 November 1799), Napoleon was consolidating the power that would eventually lead to his crowning himself Emperor of the French in December 1804.\n\nJoseph’s star had risen along with his brother’s, but circumstances catapulted him to positions in life to which he never aspired. He was by far the best educated and the most highly cultured member of his family. His education and tastes had prepared him for the existence of a well-to-do lawyer and country squire, enjoying his family and friends, entertaining, reading great literature, collecting art, and building gardens.\n\nJoseph’s secretary, Louis Mailliard, wrote in his journal that Joseph’s life had been a series of contradictions before he came to the United States. His natural preference had been for a tranquil life far from cities and politics.¹⁰ He had married an heiress whose father died the following year leaving her a considerable inheritance. Mortefontaine, outside Paris, had been for him a paradise, surrounded by his small family, Zénaïde born in 1801 and Charlotte in 1803, and good friends. He enjoyed being in the country and he would have been content to spend the rest of his life in this secluded château. But not until Napoleon was permanently incarcerated was Joseph free to live according to his own dictates.\n\nWhen Napoleon became First Consul, he made Joseph his representative to arrange a treaty ending hostilities between France and the United States caused by American trade agreements with the British that France found insulting. The treaty, signed at Mortefontaine in 1800, was celebrated with lavish festivities: illuminations, fireworks, a gala concert, and a play featuring prominent actors and actresses of the day. One of the provisions of this iniquitous agreement stipulated that United States citizens withdraw from the French-owned Caribbean island of Saint-Domingue, which had become a slave-free country under the rule of General Pierre Dominique Toussaint L’Ouverture, a black man originally installed as commander-in-chief by Napoleon several years earlier and a loyal subject of France.¹¹ The French were not planning to leave Saint-Domingue alone. Napoleon, in a stunning about-face, rejecting the abolition of slavery that had been decreed by the Revolution, had decided that a free black republic was a threat to West Indian trade. The Treaty of Amiens that Joseph negotiated on 27 March 1802 with Lord Cornwallis between England and France insured the safety of French ships, loaded with 20,000 troops and led by Joseph’s brother-in-law, Pauline’s husband, General Leclerc, to reach Saint-Domingue and destroy the first multiracial government in the New World.¹² The expedition was a disaster and thousands died, both French and citizens of Saint-Domingue. Toussaint was sent to France in chains to die in prison.\n\nNapoleon had sent Joseph to conclude the Treaty of Lunéville with the Austrian plenipotentiary, Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, in February 1801, which effectively brought an end to the second Coalition against France, securing peace for the first time in ten years. And the following summer, at his magnificent mansion in Paris, the Hôtel Marbeuf, Joseph signed the Concordat with Cardinals Consalvi, Spira, and Caselli, representing Pope Pius VII, restoring the Catholic religion to France. (The French Revolution had banned the Church.) Joseph’s legal training had taught him to be moderate and diplomatic, thus his brother used him for many private transactions as well. Despite Napoleon’s early skepticism regarding his brother’s aptitude, he also made him study military art so he could command an army. When Napoleon was planning the invasion of England, he named Joseph colonel of the fourth regiment at Boulogne.\n\nThe peace with Austria that Joseph had signed was not to last, for an Austro-Russian coalition menaced France in 1805. In August, while away in Germany fighting the armies of this alliance, Napoleon appointed Joseph Regent of France. After Napoleon’s great victory at Austerlitz on 2 December, the emperor decided to take possession of the Kingdom of Naples. In October the British had taken over Sicily after the Battle of Trafalgar, and in order to prevent the British from dominating the Mediterranean Napoleon needed to control Naples and Sicily.\n\nHe advised a no doubt astonished Joseph, in Paris, that he had named him commander-in-chief of the Army of Naples: I wish you to set off for Rome forty hours after receipt of this letter, he said, and let your first dispatch inform me that you have entered Naples, driven out the treacherous court and subjected that part of Italy to our authority.¹³ He wrote again from Stuttgart three weeks later: You will make no truce, you will hear of no capitulation. My will is that the Bourbons shall have ceased to reign at Naples. I intend to seat on that throne a Prince of my own House—first of all you, if not, another.¹⁴\n\nJoseph left at once, and traveling via Turin and Rome he at last reached Capua, where he learned that his advance guard already occupied Naples without firing a shot. The Bourbons had taken flight across the straits of Messina to Palermo. Joseph set about reestablishing peace in the kingdom of Naples, made many changes in the infrastructure of the country by suppressing feudalism, dissolving what he considered too-powerful convents, selling crown lands, founding universities and art centers, and establishing courts free from his own oversight. He tried to improve the Neapolitans’ lot after the cruelty they had suffered under the repressive Bourbon Queen Caroline, sister of the beheaded Marie Antoinette of France."
