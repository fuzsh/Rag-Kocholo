        "text": "“My ambition is to be called the savior (not the destoyer) of the Holy See”.\n\nQUOTES:\n\n“Napoleon was exiled to St Helena, where he died an agonizing and horrifying death.* The Emperor’s real legacy is the modernizing and beautifying of Paris, the official promotion of religious tolerance, the current French legal and educational systems, and the European Union, to name but a few Napoleonic initiatives. And of course, the legend lives on. Drawing on new archival research, Hazareesingh traces not only the emergence of the Napoleonic myth and how it developed into a potent political culture, but also the amazing tenacity of popular affection for the emperor, manifest in countless busts and portraits in ordinary citizens’ homes, grass-roots political activism, miraculous apparitions reported after his death, and the memories kept alive by thousands of imperial war veterans. This book is a timely study of why the fascination with Napoleon has endured for two centuries.”\n\nAbout the Author\n\n“Sudhir Hazareesingh is a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford and a tutor in politics. A specialist in modern French history and politics, his books include From Subject to Citizen (Princeton, 1998) and Political Traditions in Modern France (Oxford, 1994).”\n\n“In Leys’s deliciously sardonic short fable, Napoleon Bonaparte escapes from imprisonment on the isle of St. Helena, where an officer who impersonates him is executed. The exiled emperor becomes a cabin hand on a crayfish schooner, returns to the Continent under an alias, takes a tourist excursion to the battlefield of Waterloo and eventually makes his way to Paris, where loyal Bonapartists are mourning the death of their hero. While coolly plotting his return to power, the deposed ruler lapses into domestic joy and small-time prosperity as a melon merchant, and becomes the live-in companion of a simple, warmhearted widow whom he knows only as “the Ostrich.” Leys is the pen name of Pierre Ryckmans.”\n\n“Most Napoleon biographers portray their subject as a Corsican patriot who hated France….This is a positive portrait of the man whom most of history has painted as loathsome. Englund’s interpretation illustrates and emphasizes Bonaparte’s youthful idealism – and what became of it. Young Napoleon’s writings were of an extremely high quality, and have often been compared to Caesar’s Commentaries on the Gallic Wars. By studying and considering these writings closely, Englund has been able to skillfully integrate them into his explanations of Napoleon’s political existence. Whereas many Napoleon biographies focus on the military aspects of his life, Englund has chosen to focus on the political, for Napoleon believed that war was merely an instrument to an end, not the end itself.\n\nNapoleon said it himself: “what an adventure my life has been!”.\n\nThe book persuaded me, nay seduced me, to respect and admire this great man of European History. Without appearing to be obviously doing so, Cronin destroys the monstrous prejudice that Napoleon suffers in Britain and countries with a measure of British influence (as is my country, Malta). Apart from being a huge work of research with mountains of first hand sources, this is a splendidly easy to read biography….”\n\n�\n\n______________________________________________________\n\n�� Roman-Catholique prediction by Reverend Father Henri LaCordiere:\n\nSermon by Reverend Father Henri LaCordiere at NotreDame : Napoleon is another Moses. This time the “Code” is for All Humanity [The Napoleonic Code]\n\nFor John Q. Public & those who only think of Napoleaon as the Anti-Christ…THAT is an Anglican thing\n\nand quite prejudicial, partly due to Admiral Horatio Nelson (who, by the way, blew-up COLUMBUS’ birth-house on the Citadel of CALVI, Corsica).\n\nTo make things even worse, the popular MAX GALLO series�scripted and incorporated every false legend [size, intentions, manners and order of events], fallacy and anglo-propaganda possible. Not only was it full of inaccuracies…even concerning the Pope (which he portrayed as an old, huge man…quite contrary to the agile and�handsome Pope Pius VII), it degraded the whole RELIGIOUS family of the Bonapartes! I�even had Vatican documentation to the contrary as to what is publicly taught in English speaking Catholic countries…\n\nMARY, QUEEN OF HEAVEN (AND CORSICA):\n\nparticularly concerning the “kidnap” of Pius VI and his death in exile….\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDuring Corsica’s War for Independence, Letizia Romalino-Buonaparté (carrying Napoleon in her womb) proclaimed: “Bullets whistled past my ears, but I trusted in the protection of the Virgin Mary, to whom I had consecrated my unborn child….” Her husband-Carlo’s brother, Napoléoné Buonaparté [whom she would name her newborn son after] was killed in the Battle of Ponte Novo, as a Corsican martyred-patriot.\n\nCRONIN writes: “August 15 is the Feast of the Assumption, and Letizia (with her devotion to the Virgin Mary) insisted upon going to the Cathedral for High Mass. When Mass had begun, she felt the first signs of labor.” Before she could reach the first floor apartment she gave birth to a son still within its caul/veil. “Later that day, a priest came from the cathedral to baptize the boy….\n\nNapoléoné�had a generous nature; and would share his toys and sweets with other children without asking for anything in return…” Letizia saw to it (in Corsican fashion) that he bathed daily…”\n\nAt he age of five, he was sent to a mixed day-school run by Nuns….Later he went to a boys day-school run by Fr. Recco. Napoléoné�was especially adept in mathematics. He learned that “honor is more important than money, fidelity than self-indulgence, courage than anything else…”and a keen sense of justice was inbred into him!…”Letizia upon hearing startling news, would cross herself very quickly and murmur ‘Gesu’…a habit her son picked-up!”\n\nWhen Napoléoné was 9, with his uncle Guiseppe Fesche, along with his older brother, Joseph, these�three [together] would be sent to college in Autun (Aix-de- Provence) under the protection of Letizia’s cousin, the subdeacon of Autun Cathedral, the Abbé Varese, to study the French language and culture together, until Napoléoné’s application for Military school would come through. Thereupon, before going off to military school, Letizia had him and his brother Joseph (who would study for the priesthood) blessed by the Father Superior of the Lazarist priesthood (of which the diocese of Ajaccio’s Archdeacon was his father Carlo’s brother, Luciano Buonaparté [his uncle])in December 1778….The Archbishop of Lyon was the step-uncle of his mother Letizia, being the uncle to her half-brother, Guiseppe Fesch….\n\nWhen, as young lieutenent on leave at age 16, he returned to Corsica,�Napoléoné�not only brought with him a trunk-load of classical books; but, also the desire to write down the history of Corsica, organized a “Corsican National Guard” and began his task of replacing French municipal personnel in Ajaccio with Corsicans! Where his late father Carlo had a small terrace, he built a small “summer-house” for himself, where he could study in solitude and peace. He took full charge of the Buonaparté household; and made sure the family received the missing dues for the harvests and unpaid promisary notes. Little Lucien wanted to be a Priest and Joseph needed money to continue his law studies.\n\nFor the past three years,�Napoléoné spent more time with his family in Corsica, than with his regiment in France. The French ultra-Royalists accused him of being a Jacobite inciting a Corsican “rebellion” against France! He was ordered back….Napoléoné did what little he could possibly do.��He left Joseph in charge, who was studying law at Pisa now [instead of the Seminary]; and returned to his regiment at Auxunne….\n\nBackground, From the pen of Ghjuvan Filipu Antolini:\n\nForced into exile after the defeat of Ponte Novu (marking the bloody end of the Independence of Corsica) Pasquale de’Paoli will be celebrated throughout Europe and is received by the King of England as “head of state” that he surely was.\n\nIn 1776, the United States of America declared their Independence. In 1787, Americans produced their “Constitution”.\n\nSome do not hesitate to say America was inspired by Pasquale de’ Paoli. In any case, Paoli was then known and celebrated in the U.S. (paying him homage) as “a freedom fighter”. [Several cities are set up bearing his name (and still exist today).]\n\nNapolèon supported the original Constitutional Monarchy instituted by Louis XVI. Marbeuf had a “crush” on Napoléoné’s mother and promised her many things. He was welcomed into the Buonaparté Family home. (In the entrance-way is seen a dedication to him!…although Marbeuf, in reality, was not that good to Corsica at all.) In September 1784 MARBEUF died.\n\nNow Corsica was handled by “THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE”! Bureaucrats moved-in; France was on the brink of Bankruptcy…subsequently, the bureaucrats refused to pay Letizia Buonoparté on the use of her groves and facilities. Letizia found herself now in a bad financial situation now that Marbeuf was no longer around. The cost of living rose extremely. Corn inflated to twice what it was in 1771, by 1784. Napoléoné sought justice. He went to Paris in the Fall of 1787 to see the CONTROLLER GENERAL. He had honest figures explaining the amount the French government owed the Buonoparté Family…but added that no sum “could ever compensate for the kind of debasement a man experiences when he is made aware at every moment of his subjection.”\n\nStill, THE MINISTERY did not pay Letizia her due monies….and did not recede the ODONE property taken from the BUONAPARTé’s…because one of those bureaucratic officials, a Msr. SIOVIRIS wanted the property for himself! Napoléoné took action: He wrote to the REGISTRAR of the CORSICAN STATES-GENERAL, Laurent Giubega (his own god-father).\n\nNapoléné protested strongly concerning unerergetic tribunals and officers….where the final decision lay in the hands of one man, “a stranger not only to our language and habits but also to our legal systen (instituted by Pasquale Paoli)….very envious of the luxury he has seen on the CONTINENT; and ofcourse, which his salary would not allow him to attain.” Still, Napoléoné’s letter had No Effect! These injustices, particularly to his mother,totally changed Napoléoné’s attitude to the French in Corsica.\n\nHe completrely understood Paoli’s weary position. Formerly, Napoléoné accepted the French as beneficial; NOW HE SAW IT AS A OPPRESSIVE: THE FRENCH RULE IN CORSICA WAS TOTAL INJUSTICE, particularly due to the new French System. That FRENCH RULE, he decided, MUST BE ENDED AND CORSICA again be a Free Nation.\n\nNapoléoné writes: “The present position of my country [meaning CORSICA], and the powerlessness of changing it, is a new reason for fleeing this land where duty obliges me to praise men whom virtue obliges me to hate.” It took two years for Napoléoné to figure out what had to be done: Napoléoné was to write that book, of which, he for so many years thought-of. He would write a “History of Corsica”, to arose the world’s feelings of humanity;..and once they knew the facts, humanity would demand freedom for Corsica.\n\nNapoléoné made Paoli his central figure; but much of his attention was focused also on the other freedom-fighters against the Genoavese, as Guglielno and Sampiero. Unfortunately, this book was never completed; but, the several chapters completed and written by him, made the distictive point that Corsica would have escaped subjection if only they they had built a strong navy. Napoléonè believed, still, that Corsica must be freed “by a strong and just man”.\n\nIn late October, in Paris, he had the unfortunate experience of “engaging a lewed woman” which so repulsed him, and turned him back to the beauties and richness of Corsican culture. He was granted “a leave of absense” for the Advent and Christmas holidays.\n\nIn 1789, the French Revolution broke out with their own ideas of democracy and freedom; and when the French Revolution began in Paris, Napoléoné viewed it from the prospective of an on-looker, rather than a “French-citizen” [which technically he was]….He was abhored by the mob; but appreciated the love of liberty and self-esteem. Corsica never had the class distinctions of feudal Continental Europe; so, these affairs seemed distant. His thoughts could only run now to where his country “Corsica” would now stand, now that the Bourbon Monarchy had fallen in France. Napoleoné was skeptical to accept the new French rulers. This was reinforced by the fact that the newer French government reversed the promises given to the Buonapartè Family by the Constitutional Monarchy and Marbeuf.\n\nCorsica had sent two deputy-representatives to the “States-Generale” and dearly hoped this would end the occupation of the “Royal-Commissioners” in Corsica. Napoléoné wanted to command the Local Militia; and Joseph desired to be an elected-official deputy! He truly had hopes now of fulfilling Paoli’s dream of a free and independent nation of Corsica.\n\nIn Dec. 1789 the newly formed the “Constuent Assembly” in France declared that Corsica was no longer just a possession but a full fledged “Department of the Country of France. Napoléoné was saddened, and ordered his mother Letizia to hoist up banners: “Viva la Nationé; Viva Paoli”….\n\nIt was therefore logical that Paoli was received well, in triumph, by the Paris Convention, after a long winded speech by the young Napoléoné Buonaparté. The Marquis de Lafayette served Paoli well as a guide to Paris. Pasquale Paoli to Napoléoné: “There is nothing modern about you: You are a character out of Plutarch.”\n\nSo, Paoli was invited back by the DIRECTOIRE,to become the miltary Governeur of Corsica and appointed head ofthe Corsican National Guard and President of the General Council. Joseph received his dream; and was chosen as one of the three delegates to receive Paoli ! When Paoli returned from British exile, Paoli greeted Joseph like a long-lost son; and presented Joseph with a portrait of Paoli (that his father Carlo drew of him on the back of a playing-card) when Carlo was his First Secretary. Letizia treasured this.\n\nFrom 1789-1791, Paoli only wished to preserve good relations on the Island with the French Government.\n\nPaoli was 64 years of age; and Letizia in her mid-thirties believed Paoli was making unwarrented advances toward her! Things got very mixed-up…with Paoli believing that Napoléoné was rejecting his authority….Nothing could have been further from the truth; as Napoléoné adored Pasquale Paoli.\n\nNapolèoné believed a HIGHER VENGEANCE at work; that over all human affairs there broods a DIVINE regulative JUSTICE! In the reforms Napoléoné wished accomplished, he saw the tragic fate of those he envisages for the reformation….BUONAPARTé wrote a 40 page essay, of which he submitted for a prize of 1200 livres offered by THE ACADEMY OF LYON in answer to the QUESTION: “What are the Most Important Truths and feelings to instill into men for their happiness?”\n\nNapoléoné began with an epigraph: “Morality will exist when governments are free” [echoing Raynal’s “Good morals depend upon good government”]. Napoléoné writes: “Man is born to be happy: Nature, an enlightened mother, has endowed him with all the organs necessary to this end. So, happiness is the enjoyment of Life in the way most suitable to man’s constitution.And every man is born with a right to that part of the fruits of the earth necessary for subsitence. Paoliìs chief merit lies in having assured this.”\n\nOn ‘feeling’, Napoléoné says that man experiences his most exquisite pleasure when he is alone at nightfall, meditating on Nature’s Origin; and such sentiments would be man’s most precious of gifts, among which also must be included as, LOVE OF COUNTRY, LOVE OF WIFE, and “DIVINE FRIENDSHIP”. He writes: “A wife and children! A father and a mother, brothers and sisters, a friend! yet, surprisingly, some people find fault with nature, and ask why they were ever born!…. Feelings make us love what is beautiful and just; but, they also make us rebel against tyranny and evil. It is the second aspect we must try to develop and protect from perversion.\n\nThe good legislator must therefore, guide feeling by reason. At the same time, he must permit complete and absolute frredom of thought, and freedom to speak and write (except where this would endanger/DAMAGE the social order. Tenderness, for instance, must not degenerate into flabbiness….It is reason which distinguishes genuine feeling from VIOLENT Passion, reason that keeps society going, reason that develops a natural feeling and makes it great: To LOVE one’s country is an elementary feeling; BUT to love it above everything else is the ‘love of beauty in all its energy, the pleasure of HELPING TO MAKE A WHOLE NATION happy’….\n\nBut there is a perverted kind of PATRIOTISM, engendered by ambition.” Napoléoné denounces this fanatical ambition, “with its pale complexion, wild-eyes, hurried footsteps, jerky jestures and sardonic laugh.”….Napoleon repeastedly comments in his notebook “To what lengths can a man be driven by his passion for fame!” Napoléoné contrasts the ambitious egoist with the genuine PATRIOT: the man who lives in order to HELP OTHERS. Through courage and manly strength, the patriot attains true happiness. To live happilly and to work for others’ happiness is the only religion of God. He says, what pleasure there is to die surrounded by one’s children and be able to say, “I have insured the happiness of a hundred families: I have had a hard life; but the State will benefit from it. Through it, my fellow citizens live calmly; through my perplexities, they are made happy, and, through my sorrows, they are joyous.”\n\nVINCENT CRONIN SUMS IT THUS:\n\n“This was the essay written by Second Lieutenant Buonaparté in his cramped billet in Auxonne(Auçun) between parades and sentry duty…The patriot is clearly Napoléoné himself. His aim in life is to work for others’ happiness….he sees himself as a member of a greater community, working for “a hundred famiies”…and he is not now a soldier; but a civilian.Napoléoné, on 12 June 1789, wrote to General Pasquale Paoli: “I am still young, and maybe rash to undertake this: but I shall be upheld by my love of thruth, of my country and my compatriots, and by the enthusiasm I never cease to derive from the prospect of an improvement of our state….”\n\nNapoléoné, who never ceased admiring Paoli, had early in 1791 requested of Pasoli to provide him with documents, in order that he could fulfill his dream of writing the true history of Corsica. …But the misunderstanding esculated to the point where Paoli issued a legal warrant to have Napoléoné summoned to his “court”!\n\nNapoléoné and some others of his “militia” thought it was a warrant for his arrest and inprisonment…which ofcourse it was not (as all Paoli wanted to do was speak and question Napoléoné); but, this was enough to send Napoléoné and his 12 year-old brother Luigi (now known as Louis) fleeing Corsica, to Provence.\n\nNapoléoné was transferred back to Valance. Dying, great-uncle Lucciano, the Archdeacon, said to Joseph: “You may be the eldest; but mark my words, your brother Napoléoné will be head of the Buonaparté family.” To Napoléoné he said, “Tu poi, Napoléoné, serai un omone;” and told him to keep an eye on Lucien…to be weary of him.\n\nIn October 1791, Archdeacon Lucciano died, Guiseppi Fesch took his uncle’s archdeaconite position at Ajaccio. Letizia feared Paoli and was confused to what a good Corsican patriotess should do…the French or the English! Three months later, Napoléoné was appointed Adjuntant Major of the “Corsican-Volunteers“. The minister of War in Paris granted it to him! He considered resigning from the French Army, and make Corsica his career…for the cause of Life And Liberty!\n\nRobespiere, with his “new edict of Nantes”, declared war on the Roman Church by the oath required of priests November 27, 1790 the day after Christmas Federation. Its adapted declaration , stifled religious consciences, and compelled religious-opposition, in declaring war on the Roman Church, by the oath required of priests 27 November 1790 the day after Christmas Federation.\n\n“This meeting will, in earnest, bring bishops, priests, vicars, to swear to the constitution within a week, otherwise they will be deemed to have waived their office. The mayor is held eight days later to denounce the lack of swearing. And those who, on oath, to fail, would be cited in district court and those who refused to interfere in their former office, prosecuted as disturbers.”\n\nIt is the creation of “the constitutional church”, the priests philosophers who confuse law and morality, the sworn priests who turn away from the Pope, to stand up against him. The fanaticism of refractory priests transform this into a heretical schism, especially in the West, Brittany and Vendée.\n\nOn 28 February 1792, Saliceti ordered the suppression of Corsican convents in Ajaccio, Bastia, Bonifacio and Corté!. In Ajaccio on 25 March, Capucins delivered Easter Communion. The receivers of Holy Communion declared it was by religious men, and not the bought “priests” of the Directory.\n\nIn San Francesco a delegation of faithful Corsicans petitioned a stay of the Orders from Saliceti. It was JOSEPH Buonaparté who ordered them home! When Napoléoné heard about this, he was angered and upset. (It is told that Paoli told Napoléoné: “go forth and be the successor of Alexander.”) Napoléoné was a second lieutenant in the Artllery. Two lieutenant-colonels were to be elected for each batallion. One candidate, Quenza, qas also favored of Paoli. Napoléoné kept “open-house” for his Volunteers. He was very impressed that one decided to stay at his home. The election came the next day, at the Church in San Francesco. Matteo Pozzo di Borgo entered-in like a Malfia bully with arms; and Naopoléoné’s followers marked him down openly with shouts and dragged him from the platform; And against the French law, Napoléoné got himself elected “lieutenant-colonel” with his Corsican Militia along with Quenza.\n\nJoseph Buonaparte sent the company of Volunteers to Ajaccio. On 02 April 1792 they were formerly inspected by the French garrison official, Colonel Maillard. Maillard insisted that only a quarter of the Volunteers [Napoléoné included] could stay in Ajaccio, the rest, under Rossi would have to go into the interior. The “Ajaccienne division” would be given barracks just outside of Ajaccio’s walls. Son fighting broke-out between the Volunteers and the Ajaccio mariners. Many families fled the city and took ship for Italian ports.\n\nEaster Sunday, the nonjurying priests offered Mass at the Convent of San Francesco. On 09 April, the Faithful made a Procession. 17:00 hours in the evening. Violance broke out again between the sailers and the Volunteers. One of Napoléoné’s lieutenants, Rocco-Serra, was murdered beside him. Napoléoné with some others ran through the Ternano mansion to escape…right aside the Cathedral Square…where the seminarians sheltered them. He tried to go to and explain to Colonel Maillard. But Maillard refused Napoléné’s admittance to his residential-governing house in Ajaccio,The Volunteers needed to be within the cidadel for their safety. Napoléoné relentlessly pleaded with Maillard; but said only the King’s orders could permit that!.\n\nMaillard refused to give Napoléoné and Quenza municians they so badly needed. The next day some unruly Jacobeans, accused of being among the Volunteers of Napoléoné, killed Abbé Santo Peraldi, a widow and a young girl, 13 years-old. The Abbé’s father, Mario Battista Peraldi, with some parishoners, attacked the Seminary. The Volunteers counter-attacked and had to occupy the local houses. The ancient Church of the Jesuits was stormed. . The townsfolk blamed Napoléoné for causing a riot. The French Governor Maillard said that he would attack and destroy the Volunteers if they did not withdraw immediately!\n\nBoth Napoléone and Quenza were “men of religion”; and were well known to Abbé Coti, the Procurator Syndic of the District of Ajaccio. Abbé Coti, acted on his own Authority, knowing Napolèoné….Maillard finally agreed to make peace with the Volunteers. Napoléoné that night had attacked the Benelli mansion; so on 10 April, in the meeting with Quenza, Napoléoné, some other officers and Maillard, there was drawn-up an armistace….But the armistance was not being obeyed! There was a break-ot of violence again over a water-fountain. Napoléoné saw these French troops, and Maillard who led them, as disreputable bullies and is believed to have organized an insurrection against Maillard. On the 11th, Maillard reversed his armistace and gave the Municipality cannons to fight the Volunteers.\n\nThe French government sent two commisioners, Cesari and Bartolemeo Arrighi to Ajaccio. Meeting them ahead in Bocognano, Napoléoné gave them the true story. Paoli himself gave Napoléoné and Quenza the right of arms to bring-down the violence in the city of Ajaccio! On 16 April, Cesari and Arrighi entered Ajaccio. The Commissioners sent Quenza to Corté; despite Napoléoné’s pleas; but his brother Joseph interceded against his brother’s wishes and Napoléoné had to give way. There was no “cuccagna”! Abbé Coti was threatened with suspension of his position and called to Corté. In Paris, Pozo and Peraldi spoke-up against Napoléoné and Paoli. Carlo Andrea Pozzo was made in Paris one of the Four Commissioners of War! It became increasingly plain, that Pasquale Paoli was the one sure center of Corsica: and the only one who could guarantee Corsica’s security. Saliceti deplored Paoli, seeking his “power”. When Napoléoné came to Corté with his batallion in May, he immediately sought out Paoli. He proposed a new batallion under his command on 13 May. Joseph told Napoléoné: “It seems to me, that your most prudent course of action would be to leave the island immediately and return to France.” Letizia and Joseph convinced Napoléoné to go to Paris to defend himself and Paoli.\n\nNapoléone told his brother Joseph on 29 May 1792: “Keep on close terms with General Paoli. He is everything, and can do everything. He will be all important in a future that no one in the world can predict….”\n\nSoon came the revelation of the Royal family fleeing justice….and three months after the flight of Varennnes , Napoléoné defended Paoli, finally, at the French Consul despite all that ocurred…as he loved “Il Babbu”, when the French wanted to remove and behead Paoli! Napoléoné was granted leave to return to his Corsican family and meet with the old General!\n\nNapoléoné was sickened by what he saw; recognizing Robespierre and “the Committe for Public Safey” as the vermin they were. His sister, Maria-Anna was at St Cyr: the aristocratic convent school where her name became Elisa. The Invading Prussian Army were raping and murdering in the wild unruly atmosphere of Paris. The prisons were broken into by them; and they butchered 14,000 prisoners by September! The Revolutionaries tried to stop Napoléoné and Elisa …only thing stopping them from being slaughtered was he and his sister’s Corsican tongue, his uniform and his Corsican passport. They made it back to Ajaccio.\n\nNapoléoné was reinstated, and Letizia wrote Louis XVI a letter of thanks…one of the last letters of correspondence sent to the great constitutional-Bourbon King! At this time, Robespierre had supressed all regious Orders. In two weeks time, by August, the Tuilleries were attacked; and then began the mass public executions! The Royal Family had been imprisoned in the Temple!\n\nNapoléoné condemned the beheading of the Royal family; therefore by 1793, came “the severe rupture”.\n\nPasquale Paoli understands that the revolution is falling into the errors of terror, and turns away from France…after a confirmed meeting with General Napoléoné Buonaparté…who was highly critical of “the Commitee for Public Safety” and\n\nthe Directory of Robespierre!\n\nNapoleonic QUOTE:\n\n“The federalism discordant sects vanished in unity, indivisibility of Reason”.\n\nWhen King Louis XVI was executed, Pasquale Paoli said to Lucien Buonaparté: “The wretches have guillotined their King: the best of men, a Saint! No Corsican wants anything to do with them [the Robespierreists]…shame on anyone who side with the brigands!”\n\nIt was LUCIEN [not Napoléoné] who made accusations against Paoli in the Toulon Revolutionaries Club. “The Convention” orderered Paoli’s arrest….Thus these advents fulfiled the old Archdeacon Luciano’s prophecy concering young Lucien…..\n\nOn 11 July 1793, they all finally were enabled to rondevous together out of Ajaccio with the French vessel commadered by Napoléoné; and they sailed for Toulon. They landed in two days time…the whole clan and the Fesch’s. Napoléon [removing the “é” from his Christian name, and the “u” and accent of his surname] landed with his family in Toulon, 14 July 1793. France had as its new Government “The “Commitee of Public Safety” (a Commitee of 12 likened to the 12 Apostles!) …into the scheming arms of Lucien, who felt no remorse….\n\nAfter the holiday season, masqueraders of Reason storm Notre-Dame de Paris on 10 November 1793 dis-establishing the worship of the Supreme Being.\n\nOn 16 November 1793, the Convention says Catholicism is “deprived of public worship”. The most concrete consequences of this, lie in the confiscation of Church property. “In principle all buildings used for worship and housing of his ministers should serve as an asylum for the poor and establishment for public instruction”. Thus began a process of dispossession of all Church properties!!!\n\nJust after this, the British win control of Corsica.\n\nPaoli despised the French, was afraid of his own head be taken…And although having no great love for the English, Paoli hoped that the English would grant Corsica the liberty and freedom of State that France was denying Corsica…as he made a few prominent English “friends” to Corsica’s “cause”….But little hope, commitment and no money was coming from the English Government; and from his so-called “friends”, came but a few British pounds Sterling.\n\nNapoleon despised Robespierre, was very fearful of the The “Commitee of Public Safety”, and condemned the beheading of the Royal family. He loved the ringing of Church bells; and said that he firmly believed that only religion could answer man’s thirst for perfect justice…\n\nHe plucked the Convention on Freedom of Worship, on 21 November 1793, hoping to calm the spirits of the nation, and restore sanity to the “state”!.\n\nParadoxically, Napoléon intended to induce the clergy to respect “the powers of the state”, Catholicism, still widely popular, especially for the needs of the masses, finally re-appears as “an Institution that qualifies for renewal. The Church of the Papacy is decisively right”; and Napoléon seeks to reestablish its full presence in France.In August of 1794, Napoléon was involved with the fall of the Robespierrists. He was imprisoned near ANTIBES. Saliceti played a part in his imprisonment….and wished Napoléon to be guillotined.\n\nA French naval squadron had appeared in Ajaccio.\n\nPaoli decides to abdicate his power, as he, General Paoli, will not serve under England’s [Sir Eliot’s] incompetant Governorship and cruelty, anyway. Paoli abdicated his power…and is exiled to London, for fear that “the Commitee for Public Safety” & France’s “First Consul” would have his head as well!!\n\nPaoli resides in London under the hope that someday his ideals will see the free light of a republic of Corsica and the Western would would follow suit in return…He hoped that if General Bonaparte finally achieved high enough position that he would keep his desired promise of freeing Corsica…BUT the Directory of France (while Napoléon was in Egypt) had other ideas….\n\nIn 1796: upon hearing of Napolèon’s triumph in the abolishment of the Republic of Genoa, Paoli cried out: “It is by the hand of a Corsican that Genoa has received “la Coup de Grace!”\n\n*A “Man of Faith”, Napoleon was, have no doubt.\n\nWhy are there similarities in thought of Muammar al-Qathafi and Napoléoné Bonaparté ?\n\n“Did Napoléoné convert to Islam ?”\n\nhttp://www.progress.org/2010/napoleon.htm\n\nby Pippa Bartolotti\n\nThere are one or two references to the conversion to Islam by Napoleon Bonaparte. The official French newspaper of the time 1798 — carried an account of Napoleons conversion and mentions his Muslim name, Aly Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon is also quoted (in Christian Cherfils: “Bonaparte et Islam” *) as saying that he would like to establish a uniform regime based on the principles of the Quran. [A more recent reference is in the book “Satanic Voices” by David Pidcock.]\n\nNapoleon traveled widely and was well read. As the Emperor of France he was continually searching for ways in which he could strengthen his country, and had a deep knowledge of Shariah Law….\n\nIn 1807, February 9, Napoleon issued a rabbinical Fatwa prohibiting usury (the charging of interest). Upon being shown a table of interest charges, he reflected for a while and made the following comment:\n\n“The deadly facts herein revealed, lead me to wonder that this monster, interest, has not devoured the whole human race. It would have done so long ago if bankruptcy and revolutions had not acted as counter poisons.” (Lincoln: Money Martyred; Omni Publications 1935).\n\nIn the build up to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 on June 18, western bankers were pitched against Napoleon; if he won, they would be out of business. If Britain lost, the value of English coinage would plummet. If Britain was victorious, the value of the currency would increase.\n\nThe prosperity of the Rothschilds rested upon backing the right horse in the Napoleonic wars and developing close relations with one or more of the warring governments involved. In January 1814 the Rothschilds contracted to supply the Duke of Wellington with the monthly hundred thousand pounds sterling in ready cash to continue paying his armies to wage war against Napoleon. They became the disburser of subsidies to the German, Austrian, Belgian, and Russian allies.\n\nThe four Rothschild brothers developed a network of agents, shippers, and couriers to transport gold — and information — criss-crossing the frontiers of Europe buying, selling, and transporting millions of coins.\n\nThe private intelligence service so gathered enabled Nathan Rothschild to receive the news of Wellington’s victory at the Battle of Waterloo a full day ahead of the British government’s official messengers. At the London Stock Exchange, Rothschild dumped hundreds of thousands of British guineas on the market. Guessing that he had prior knowledge of a Wellington defeat at Waterloo, other investors were in a panic to sell. At its lowest price, and shortly before the official news about Wellingtons victory arrived in London, Rothschild bought the currency he had just sold, and the value of the guinea skyrocketed. His fortune multiplied twenty times on that one day.\n\nNathan gained so much that by 18256 he was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a liquidity crisis.\n\nIn 1913 the Federal Reserve Act created a consortium of privately held associated banks called the Federal Reserve Bank. The largest shareholders of the Federal Reserve Bank were Rothschilds of London holding 57% of the stock not available for public trading. It is difficult to track the exact ownership of these banks, however, the Rothschilds may have assets in the trillions.\n\nWhat would have happened had Napoleon not converted to Islam, or at the very least, not prescribed Islamic and non-usurious banking practices for France? Would the Rothschild family not have been so interested in the outcome of Waterloo? And what might have happened if Napoleon had won? (An unlikely event considering the entire European aristocracy and most of the banking families were pitted against him.)\n\nWould we now be living in a world whereby money could be borrowed without interest? We would not be facing a national debt which allows the bankers their huge bonuses and the ordinary people the bill for it all.\n\nSome aspects of Shariah Law still exist in the French constitution based on the Code Napoleone.\n\nExcerpts only from: “Napoleon, an admirer of Islam and its Prophet”\n\nBy Paul-Eric Blanrue\n\nNapoleon, an admirer of Islam and its Prophet\n\nBy Paul-Eric Blanrue\n\nThe truth and the reality of the conversion to Islam by Napoleoné Bonaparté… here are some excerpts from the authentic thought of the Emperor on spirituality.\n\nNapoleon wrote: “That which is superior in Mahomet, is that in ten years he conquered half the globe, while nearly three hundred years of Christianity to establish.”\n\nIn his correspondence, in the chapter “Observations on the tragedy of Mahomet,” Napoleon wrote: “He has destroyed the false gods, overthrew the temple idols in half the world, spread more than anyone the knowledge of one God in the universe … Muhammad was a great man, fearless soldier …. Great captain, eloquent, statesman, he created his homeland and regeneration in the middle of the deserts of Arabia a new people and a new power. “\n\nCount Las Cases Memorial in St. Helena, tells an interesting anecdote: “At dinner, the Emperor said curious things about Egypt, touching one of the chapters, he had dictated the religion, customs etc.. (…) “There are spirtual rewards among faithful Muslims: the hours with blue eyes, smiling groves, rivers of milk and hence he concluded, in between the two religions, that one could say that one was a threat, she [Christianity as we know it today] appears later as the religion of fear; the other [Islam in its Malakite purified state, as Muamar al-Qathafi tries to expound upon], on the contrary, was a promise, and became the religion of the attractions. ”\n\n—\n\n“The ‘confessions’ of Napoleon Bonaparte on Islam”\n\nPublished 03 September 2012 by Chuck\n\nand SUNDAY, 02 SEPTEMBER 2012 / BY RENAUD TOWE:\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte lot speechifying on major issues in his life, particularly when it forced on the island of St. Helena exile. The caged lion for example presented its opinions and beliefs vis-à-vis religion, or rather religions. Islam, whom he met during his expedition in Egypt, is obviously the one he felt most closely.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte really comes into contact for the first time with Islam in 1798, during the Egyptian campaign (1798-1801). Upon his arrival, he shows himself intrigued by the culture of the country and especially in the Muslim tradition, the call to prayer and Koranic teachings.\n\nBonaparte is actually fascinated by the person of Mohammed and touched by religious fervor. In a letter dated 28 August 1798, he confided to Sheikh El-Messiri: “General Kleber reports to me your ways, and I am satisfied. (…) I hope that is not the time where I can meet all the wise and educated men of the country soon and establish a uniform regime based on the principles of the Al-Quran, which are the only true and that can only be enjoyed by men. “(Letter to Sheikh El-Messiri (11 Fructidor VI), Correspondence of Napoleon, Napoleon Bonaparte, ed. H. Plon, 1861, vol. 4, Part Part No. 3148, p. 420).\n\nConfessions of St. Helena\n\nBonaparte, Napoleon became the first, gives back to Catholicism a true place in society. Not by conviction as evidenced by his violent attitude example with Pope Pius VII, but interest. In a letter, he says in effect that “A society without religion is like a ship without a compass.” (ONE MUST NOTE THAT MUAMMAR AL-QATHAFI HAS STATED THE SAME THING.)\n\nIslam seems to disappear from his remarks during his reign, but also re-appeared during his exile on the island of Saint Helena (1815-1821).\n\nThere, he has the time to go back on his life and philosophy on a variety of topics. During a match, present in the Journal de Sainte Hélène, he speaks of the three monotheisms. Firstly, it considers that the Jews were wrong to want to keep the message of Moses to confine their “race to elect of God. ” In addition, he admires Jesus but regrets that Christianity was recovered by “a group of politicians Rome” to control the people, and has distorted the oneness of God: “Then they gave to God partners . They were now three in one “.\n\nAt the end of its reasoning, the deposed emperor comes to Islam, which he describes as such: “And finally, at some point in history, there appeared a man named Muhammad.

More people will read and become smarter, they become familiar with the logic and reasoning. They abandon the idols, or rituals that support polytheism, and they recognize that there is only One God.

Flammarion, 1947, vol. 2, Part 28 August 1817, p. 226).\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte and Islam …\n\nThis small section has its place and in this study, and in this phase of conclusion, despite your astonishment. You’ll quickly understand why. When I was young, in school, that I would be interested to know the views of the Emperor of France on Islam. It would have been interesting to know that he took the time, several times during his Egyptian campaign and especially during his\n\nfinal visit to St Helena, to write and to write his views on the religion of Islam.\n\nhttp://leprocesverbal.com/mag/les-sources-du-code-napoleon-et-du-code-civil/\n\nOn this rock in the middle of the Atlantic, Napoleon then had no interest to reveal their preferences for the Muslim religion, and yet he did. Historians did not discuss this aspect of the personality of this icon of the French nation. Why?\n\n—\n\n“The sources of napoleon code and the civil code”\n\nhttp://leprocesverbal.com/mag/les-sources-du-code-napoleon-et-du-code-civil/\n\nJean Joseph Delsol. 1867. “Elementary Explanation of the Code Napoleon.” Paris: Librairie Council of State, 12.\n\nHe will return to the Civil Code thereafter to be slightly modified in order to achieve its modern and current form:\n\nThe French Civil Code Napoleon seems to be heavily inspired by Sharia, says Christian Cherfils*:\n\n“The influence of the Arabic-Islamic thought on European thought, was not limited to philosophy, poetry or methodology, but it is also found in European legislation. Thinkers argue that the NAPOLEONIC CODE was inspired by the N. African Malikite doctrines (just as is Muammar al-Qathafi’s total thinking), by saying, ‘Malakite Doctrine calls us , because of the nature of the relationship we do with the Arabs of Africa.\n\nTherefore, the French government awarded Dr. Peyron, care to translate: ‘The Abstract Fiqh’, its original author being al-Khalil Isaak bin Yakoub, who died in 1442.”\n\n(This book is very well known in academic and religious circles within the Magreb…)\n\n—\n\nDuring the campaign of the Napoleonic army in Egypt, the French emperor knew almost the Islamic Shariah. We refer here to the work of Christian Cherfils entitled “Bonaparte and Islam”* which contains details in this direction.\n\nNAPOLEONé BONAPARTé :\n\nCorsican born Emperor of France (1769-1821)\n\n“Islam attack especially idolaters there is no other god but God , and Muhammad is his prophet, is the foundation of Islam , it was the most important point : spend the great truth announced Moses and confirmed by Jesus. (…) There is no god but God and Muhammad is his prophet.\n\n(…) I am, and Muslim unit ( that ) I glorify the Prophet . (…) I hope that the time will soon when I can unite all the wise and educated men of the country and establish a uniform regime based on the principles of the Koran ( Islam – nes ) , which are only true and which alone can make men happy . ”\n\n( Excerpts from ” Correspondence of Napoleoné Volume V Part No. 4287 of 17/7/1799 : profession of faith , see also Exhibit No. 3148 , and the work of Christian Cherfils ” Bonaparté and Islam ” – Pedone Ed – Paris – 1914 – p 81 – . 127)\n\nNapoléoné added that “more people will read and become smarter, they become familiar with the logic and reasoning. They abandon the idols, or rituals that support polytheism, and they recognize that there is that One God. And therefore I hope that the\n\ntime will not be long when Islam will dominate the world, because the world ….. it will prevail.”\n\nThus spoke the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nRef.

That is why we are interested in here.\n\nIn Annex I states that in “Correspondence of Napoleon 1”, Volume V, P518 “Correspondence and Memory on the internal administration from 1798 to 1799”, the part No. 4287 of 17 July 1799,\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte also officially pronounce its declaration of faith in Islam. And the same\n\ninformation also appears in another work (Nakoula): his profession\n\nfaith in Arabic (I have the photostat), translated and published by Mr. Desgranges senior official secretary and interpreter, and printed in 1839 at the Royal Printing – p130 and 131.\n\nGod possesses the secrets of the soul, says the “Holy Quran”.\n\nBonaparte should be considered Muslim, since he has said and written!\n\n______\n\nChristian Cherfils entitled “Bonaparte and Islam”*\n\n*:Then these historic National Archives of War, we never will see make the headlines! If not here, in this book, you will have little chance to read it. My references are all verifiable and official yet!\n\n“The existence of God is reflected in everything that affects our imagination and if our minds does not reach Him , it is that we did not allow that our intelligence should go so far.\n\nAn honest man never doubts the existence of God; because, if reason does not understand, the instinct of the soul adopts. All things that make the soul, has sympathy with religious sentiment.\n\nThere is no doubt of Napoléon’s sincerity in making these statements. In other circumstances, he will summarize in more explicitly: “Our credulity is the vice of our nature.\n\nIt seems that the Spirit continually lived in Napoléon’s measurable periods: Premonition… this question was addressed, as sort of meditation aloud, reading like a inspired prophecy :\n\n“Who knows if the happiness of today is not the misfortune of tomorrow? Religion offers comfort in all phases of life – We are less unhappy when given to religious thought; it is therefore, always in itself, the strength for us to bear misfortune>>.\n\nThe spiritual foundation of the Catholic Church has never been questioned and no persecution took place under the Empire:\n\n“The most sacred among men is the consciousness that man has a secret voice crying that nothing on earth can make him believe what he does not believe. The most horrible of all tyranny is that which obliges a nation to embrace a religion contrary to their beliefs, otherwise they can not exercise the rights of citizens, or possess any property, which is the same thing as to have some country on earth>>.\n\nAt a minister, whose name we would now be destined to laugh at, Bigot, truly Bigot de Preameneu said by way of injunction:\n\n“The officers and prisons should never be a means of reducing practice of religion.\n\nWe can bring the conscience of a man to no court; and, no one is accountable for his religious opinions to any earthly power>>.\n\nNapoleon believed in God, he advocated freedom of conscience; but also, he admits the need for the Church:\n\n“Society can not exist without religion. When a man dies of hunger near another who is full, it is impossible to make him admit the difference if there is not an Authority who tells him: “God wills it: It must be that there are poor and the rich in the world; but, then and for eternity, the division will otherwise cease>>.\n\nPriests are required to pass through the beautiful liturgy of mysteries.\n\nThe Justice of God’s power is given to the people through the power of priests>>.\n\nHow is Napoléon to be more explicit in his definition of religion in the public interest?\n\n“Religion is still a sort of inoculation or vaccination, which satisfying our love of the marvelous, guarantees us quacks and sorcerers, as well as the priests who are better than Cagliostro, Kant and all the dreamers of Germany>> .\n\nAnd the best way to maintain/supply this wonderful need is through the Ritual Offices.\n\n“Does the Catholic religion speak more to the imagination of the people by the pomp of her ceremonies than by Her Supreme Morality? When you want to electrify the masses we must first talk to them>>.\n\nUnder this aspect [and only in respect] of the necessary annals of Liturgical-Ritual, a sort of audio-visual storytelling [which permits man with the understanding of the Holy precepts]; and so, this remains validly clear today. Napoleon was a family-minded traditionalist who was willingly suited the nostalgic moment….\n\n( Read Archbishop Lefebvre, Bishop of Epon, who is still a figure of thought with close to the thinking to that of the Emperor Napoléon.)\n\nThe policy of the Eternal Church is made of a diplomacy of small steps.\n\nNapoléoné, found in religion a natural adjuvant against tyranical-monarchy.\n\n“The biggest Republican is Jesus Christ. Aristocracy is in the Old Testament, democracy in the new.\n\nThe moral of the Gospel is that of equality and therefore most favorable to republican government.\n\nPopular sovereignty, freedom, equality, is the code of the Gospel.\n\nFor other reasons, the Roman Church in France [banned under the Revolution, then tolerated with the legal separation of church and state], was re-proclaimed by the Convention of February 21, 1795. Itremains even today, very faithful to the Pope and continues to be favored by French Catholics.\n\nThus, popular with the large French majority, The Church condemned The Revolution; yet it bustled with vitality and holiness. Bishop Gregory, accused the State of being subservient to power of the Revolution !.\n\nUnfortunately, the Roman-Catholics hierarchy mistakenly identified with a con-revolutionary “spirit”. Napoléon tried to counteract this attitude.\n\nFor him, the body of the State is willing to concede to religious Authority and a republic.\n\n“Priests have an administrative function: they are on the verge of civil service”\n\n.\n\n“A priest must be a natural judge, the moral head of population.\n\nThe priests, in the true spirit of the Gospel, must contribute to the public peace by preaching the true mission of charity.\n\nAnd that’s a chagrin that never fails:\n\n“To make really useful Cures, and prevent them from abusing their department, I wanted them to be joined through an agricultural-discourse of theology and matters of law and medicine.\n\nBefore the letter, this is a manner of “worker-priest” that Napoleon tried to invent.\n\nIn short, it is clear that he saw in the social utility of religion, a means of government:\n\n“The Christian religion is always the strongest support for any government clever enough to use it.\n\nThe power seemed to result from its separation of genres.\n\n“The Church must be in the state, not the rule in the Church.\n\nThe administrative authority must be careful not to place undue meddling in the affairs of the clergy and priests must act to the courts, opposing dress, esprit de corps . The judges, in their way, must be kind of theologians such as priests, as they also have their missions, their rules, their common law.\n\nNapoleon hoped for a religion that was more open, more present, more Gallican: only concerned with spirituality and with a detachment to property, almost a fonctionnarisée rise from today [as a Church with wide public utility, engaged in a godly service to the state, saying yes to the service of the people].\n\nThis design is revolutionary for the traditionalist Roman hierarchy of Napoléon’s day, sovereign and sometimes even in fairly recent past, overlords. For those many, who were committed to that Church, the official religion had a whiff of blousé. The “Enlightenment” brought forth a radicalism which denied Divine power; replacing it with the accomplishmments of man (devoid of God).\n\nFirst failure: Napoléon and Pope Pius VI\n\nThe first contact of General Bonaparte, Commander in Chief of the Army of Italy, with Pope Pius VI is on 22 June 1796 in Bologna. The advance of French troops upon the Papal States, forceding the Sovereign Pontiff to negotiate an armistice to prevent a march on Rome is something Pius VI probably fears. Taking advantage of these provisions, Bonaparte tries to put an end to religious riots in France by offering PiusVI an amnesty clause which formalizes the Church designed by the Constitutional Revolution: Pope Pius VI refuses! It is a failure.\n\nThe armies of the Directory thus retain control of Bologna and Ferrara. Culturally, the French Republic receives all the artwork [details of which are determined by the negotiators]. Finally, to replenish the empty coffers of the state, the Pope is forced to sell them to the French for £ 20 million.\n\nAfter Arcola and Rivoli, Austria is defeated and must deal in turn with Leoben. Bonaparte wished to clarify his situation with the Pope and be free to negotiate, preparing for Campo Formio. In his design, the populations of occupied regions are encouraged to reject temporal papal authority; but to keep the Pope as their Spiritual-Authority.\n\nOn 22 January 1797, the General contacted the Chief Minister of the Republic based in Rome. In February, he declared war on Papal temporal Authority. He won, without fighting, the Romagna and the port of Ancona.\n\nOn 16 February, in Tolentino, Bonaparte received a delegation of Cardinals led by Cardinal Mattei who demanded draconian conditions. These “conditions” stoped the progression of the French army towards Rome; but he demanded $ 30 million sent to the Directoire [so financially desperate in pressing for a BLOCKADE: for the prohibition of opening ports to the English].\n\nA note handed to the Pope’s minister, takes the leit-motiv of Bonaparte’s thinking:\n\n“The Pope thinks maybe he is worthy of his wisdom, the holiest of religions, to the command that directs priests to obey the government>>.\n\nAgain Pius VI refuses, who could not retract! Thus, a confirmed failure….\n\nNapoléon DID NOT order the capture of the Pope; nor was he responsible for his death…\n\nNapoléon refused to dispose of the Pope and reordered the reopening of the Churches throughout France; and went, 2 days after marrying Josephine, on his Egyptian Campaign, following orders of the Directory—-who wished “this troublesome General ‘out of the country’ because he interfered with their Papal plans!”\n\nPasquale Paoli fortunately, was able to see his vision of a Free Corsica fulfilled during his lifetime. though but for a short while (For when Napoléon was exiled, Corsica returned as part of France.):\n\nThe wedding present Napoléon gave to his sister Elisa and the Corsican Patriot Felice Pasquale Bachiochi (a distant cousin of his on his maternal-side) consisted of 40,000 francs and a military Command for Bachiochi in Ajaccio. The only condition he imposed upon them was that their “civil” marriage should be as soon as possible be blessed by a Catholic Ceremony in Mombello.\n\nThe Priest who blessed their union, on the same day blessed the marriage between his other sister, Pauline and Officer Victor-Emmanuel leClerc.\n\nWhen Corsica was liberated [the previous October],\n\nNapoléon ordered that the family “Casa Buonaparté” be totally repaired. Soon Letizia was able to return to her Corsican home! She returned home to cheering crowds, Mother of the Liberator of Corsica! (Therfore, the Napoléonic exile lasted only 4 years!) Hudson Lowe was billoted in Ajaccio at the same time…hence the beginning of a future end….The troublesome Lucien was now a French Commisioner in Corsica. Joseph purchased for the family, the part of the house that was not legally Letizia’s. Her half-brother, the young Abbé Guiseppe Fesch joined in, and bought some adjacent lands. But Priests were still being persecuted who did not take the Civil Oath of The New Regime by the French “Enlightenists” who still remained on the Island! So, in Spring 1798 a clash broke-out while Napoléon and Louis were in Egypt [with their party of archaeologists]. She said: “My son will not perish in Egypt as his enenemies are hoping. I know a higher destiny awaits him”. Louis returned first to his mother, carrying some of Napoléon’s Egyptian trophies with him…although he would soon head for Paris. The “Battle of the Pyramids” made Napoléon “Master of Cairo”! Josephine, though (in her infidelity) called the Bonapartes “those monsters” !!!! Grieving, Napoléon was contemplating divource…legally his right for her adultery and barren marriage. Letizia was still weak after recuperating from malaria; and Louis prompted her to go to Paris with him so she could take-in the medicinal waters/pool of a French Spa. [15 years later, she was only able to return for a few hours!] BUT, much trouble lay ahead.\n\nIt was not until 1798 that French General Berthier occupies the Eternal City on the pretext of the assassination of General Duphot. The Pope was then made a “prisoner” of the Republic and had to leave Rome. He stayed in Siena and, during his stay in France, he died at Valencia, 21 August 1799 at the age of 81 years.\n\nOf this account, Cronin wrote:\n\n“Passing through Valencia, on his return from Egypt, Napoléon had found the body of Pius VI unburried after six weeks because the Constitutional clergy refused to perform the Last Rites…”\n\n[Historial note from SAMEER : Napoléon “was actually a comrade to my only hero from south asia, the “tiger of mysore” – tipu sultan. in tipu’s last battle in 1799 against the british east india company “coalition of willing” of five armies, tipu was waiting for napolean to relieve him from the siege of his fort in srirangapatna. napolean had sent one of his generals stationed in india, to help tipu. but unfortunately tipu was martyred, with sword in hand and mysore state fell. Tipu and Napolean together could have thrown the britishers back to britain. and history could have been something else after the year 1799.]\n\nReturning from the campaign in Egypt, Bonaparte found in October 1799, that Religious Peace was still not established. Napoléon went west to pacify the Vendee. He suppressed the uprising of the Chouannerie in 1800 with the feeling that many things remain to be accomplished: as the root of the problem remains to be the French Church as relations with Rome were not settled.\n\nFrom Brumaire there is an ending the chaos; but, the state of religion remains prime-priority for the First Consul. With the Male religious-orders, here as elsewhere, it is Napoléon’s desire to quickly restore the unity of the Christians and convinced the First Consul that the Catholic religion would be politically useful.\n\nSo legally, he reformed the civil constitution of the clergy by a decree allowing freedom of worship. This opening of freedom was necessary; but too ample, it would be dangerous [thought The First Consul], because of the anarchy of the moment. Priests with special status organized worship appropriate to their status: the constitutional-oath was refracted: Religious Orders and the practice of the Liturgy were not subjected to it.\n\nClearly peace and religious unity can only result from understanding and, if possible, to support the Pope. Bonaparte therefore considered that the time had come to speak directly and officially to the Highest Authority of the Catholic Church.\n\n“If the Papacy did not exist, we would have had to create such an opportunity [as the Roman consuls were] under these difficult circumstances. The Pope can certainly do for me a great service [without bloodshed] with his help; for only he, can organize the Catholics of France into obedience to Republican Civility. Therefore, I asked him>>.\n\nFears of a Second failure: Napoléon and Pius VII\n\nA second time, after Marengo, June 14, 1800, Bonaparte began negotiations with the new Pope Pius VII.\n\nIndeed, the Holy Papal-See was vacant, the new conclave elected at Venice, then part of Austria, Chiaramonti Barnabas, Bishop of Imola, whom she proclaimed Successor of Peter, on 14 March 1800, under the name of Pius VII.\n\nConvinced that the New Bishop will be less intricate than Pius VI, the First Consul convened in Milan three months after a small Synod of 200 local priests and two bishops on 05 June 1800.\n\n“Currently,” the Pope said, “I am equipped with full power and I am determined to implement all the means I believe the most suitable to ensure and guarantee that religion remains free>>.\n\nThe new Pope assesses the risk of rejection. The French armies are victorious and running. He feared the establishment of a Republic in Rome and prepared for perhaps, his deportation. It is said that Bonaparte speaks, in his conversations, of a possible department of the Tiber. The Pope prefered to save time by sending negotiators to Paris.\n\nthe church’s “maneuver” did not escape Bonaparte. He does not want the Church to be Roman without some “Gallicism”. Subtly, Napoléon designated 2 Cardinals: Consalvi and Caprara. The Pope sent a delegation of Christian leaders having little intention to understand.\n\nAbbe Bernier Chouan joined them to make life hard for ten months, with Cretet.\n\nIn 1800, upon hearing that Napoléon was elected the First Consul, Paoli lit-up all the window’s in his London house on Oxford Street..\n\nJoseph Bonaparte negotiated for his brother’s position with the Roman Curial Secretary of State. These were indeed harsh clashes; but the Pope finally signed a Concordat on 16 July 1801.\n\n– Catholicism is the religion proposed by the majority of French. (There really was no compromise; this was obvious.)\n\n– The Consulate can nominate new bishops, but their Apointment remains to the Pope.\n\n– The sale of Church property must be endorsed by Rome, but upkeep of the houses and chapels of worship are the responsibility of France.\n\n– Freedom of religion, is fully accepted by the Concordat.\n\n– The regular orders are not mentioned in the document, but a restructuring of dioceses is modeled after the repblican redistricting of departments/parishes.\n\nIndeed, upon analysis, the Concordat reveals “flaws” that do not serve their interests in France. Thus, the Pope took advantage of the concessions. He consented to take back control of all the French clergy who, since the Gallican Declaration of 1682, were virtually independent, or, in schism. (Similiar to the way Pope Benedict XVI annulled the excommunication of the LeFevbre Bishops, in hope that they would be reunited to the Papal Church.) Through the appointments of the new bishops (replacing the ones who demanded their resignation), the Pope put the bishops (and priests appointed by the bishops) under its dependence. The Gallicanism schism, born of the Revolution and its conspirators, ended. The undeniable leader of The Church is the Pope.\n\nBonaparte finally wipes-away a second failure. The slate is now clean….\n\nQUOTE:”…I have received Cardinal Caprara, Your Holiness’ legate, with great pleasure. Peace has been signed with England, Russia, Portugal and the Porte. I hasten to send this information, well knowing the interest Your Holiness takes in the happiness and peace of nations….” [10 Oct. 1801]\n\nThe struggle for influence\n\nNapoléon, recognized moreover, that the Consul was drafting an amendment, giving it the name of Organic Articles. This was an attempt to restore government rule over all major religious non-eccliastical decisions involving the state]. Certainly, the Pope protested the publication of these articles that misrepresent the Concordat; but believed they would have no consequence spiritually, morally and temporally; so, he decided to live with it.\n\nNapoléon Bonaparte asked to be crowned on 18 May 1804. He hoped that the problems which arose because of the half-solutions proposed by “The First Consul”, would be resolved if he were declared Emperor.\n\nNapoléon wished the Solemn Coronation in Notre-Dame de Paris be attended by the Pope in person; for even the kings of France had claimed it there!\n\nDuring the winter of 1804, Pius VII, with a great entouràge, left Rome for Paris. On 27 November, a real caravan of carriages passed through the forest of Fontainebleau. Most sumptuous was the Pope, being prematurely-old and hansomely distinguished in face, but still incocgnito. Gradually and thoughtfully this Pope understood the consequences of these events to come; and, he awaited the next step, in the castle nearby.\n\nNapoléon found the head of the Roman Catholic Church an amiable man. Likewise, the Pontiff thought: “But what if I am kept in Paris?”\n\n“Everything is planned, said the Pontiff, before leaving Italy, I signed an abdication regularly and is in the hands of Cardinal Pignatelli Palermo, beyond the reach of the power of French. Instead of a Pope, he will remain in your hands a less known Barnabas Chiaramonti>>.\n\nCRONIN writes: “PiusVII left for Paris on 02 November 1804. He traveled slowly, with a suit of 100…Napolon wrote: ‘He will be much less tired if he gets it over quickly.’\n\nNapoléon welcomed the Pope at a crossroads in the forests of Fountainebleu, and installed him in the Tuileries THOUGHTFULLY arranging the room to look exactly like Pius’ roomin the Wuirnal…Napoléon gave pleasure to his old wet-nurse (Camilla) by getting her a private audience with the Pope! Napoléone also knew that his original “marriage” with Josephine was not sanctioned by the Church…but only by the French legal-state. He firmly believed in the Sacrament of Marriage; so on the Eve of his Coronation, he had his uncle, Cardinal Joseph Fesch seal for them the sacrament in the private Chapel of the Tuileries.\n\nThe propanda of his insurping the Pope’s power by “crowning himself”” is also highly inaccurate.\n\nNapoléon, out of respect for Pope Pius VII….and NOT OUT OF ARROGANCE….[for by tradition, it would have been a French ecclesiastic to crown Napoléon], dared not to humilify the Pope. So, Napoléon decided [to avoid a dispute] that he would himself place the laurel-crown on his own brow. Pius VII raised NO objection….Napoléon was always a modest man, despite his position in life. He refused to have made for him elegant uniforms. Instead he wore his original lt.-general’s uniform throughout his life and upon his burial as well, He only “dressed to the throngs” in his Coronation….In contrast to Louis XVI’s coronation (where the public was only permitted when the sacring was over), Napoléon insisted that the sacring must be publicly seen**.\n\nFOOTNOTE [** (THE ORIGINAL SACRING, by TRACY R: TWYMAN): “just before being crowned, he will be anointed with oil from the Holy Land. This takes place under a canopy that is lowered over the monarch’s head so that the public cannot see the actual moment of anointing. As soon as the oil is poured, according to tradition, the Holy Spirit enters into his or her body, transforming him or her into a divine being. He or she literally becomes another person, and from then on may take whatever titular name they find appropriate. ——….as the Holy Spirit enters into him.\n\nTo some extent, all monarchs typify the archetype of the original “Lord of the Earth” upon which their title and role is based….The…throne of that king was always seen as the symbolic “center of the Earth,” the pole axis upon which the universe rotates. The king was seen as playing a pivotal role in that process as a conduit between Heaven and Earth. Through him, the pattern on Earth modeled that of Heaven, but the two worlds were also thought to be kept separate by the polar throne, which literally was viewed by ancient man as keeping the sky, and the ethereal realm it represented, from collapsing into, and thus annihilating, the land of the living. But upon his throne, at the seat of his power, both worlds existed simultaneously, as did all moments in time….this same essential symbolism was adopted by the monarchs of every civilization that came afterward. It was in this mythical timeless realm, at the center of the world….” TAKEN FROM http://quintessentialpublications.com/twyman/?p=1743 ]\n\nThe notary, Msr. Raguideau….who originally advised Josephine NOT to marry Napoleon (who at that time “owned only a cape and sword”) was invited to the ceremonies as well. Napoléon never forgot anyone!\n\nNapoleon was pleased with the depiction of the Coronation by the artist DAVID. Napoléon was shown in the painting crowning Josephine. He told David, “You have guessed what I had in mind: You have depicted me as a French Knight!”\n\nFor Napoléon, nothing had changed. He was still the same republican. He told Josephine never to address him as “your majesty” and to always write “tu”!\n\n“I am always the same; my kind (a Corican) never changes…”\n\nQuietly, he whispered to his brother Joseph,\n\n“IF ONLY OUR FATHER COULD SEE US NOW!”\n\nThe Pope’s visit to Paris did not reduce the litigation between the two men. The Pope measured the weight and price of the bond he had given on 02 December. Still, that day the Pope had decided never to concede anything more, and if necessary, to question what he thought to be Napoléon’s strong Christian-Charlemaynistic stand. Napoléon understood too well, that if he did not have the Pope on his side, only how far he could go without serious risk to his standing with God as well as his image in public analysis [the media of his day]. He was restricted, and he knew that history’s analysis of the journey of Pius VII in France would include grave reservations about his part.\n\nIn this assessment of the strength of commitment by both men, the play went beyond the limits of courtesy. Napoleon’s Coronation pushed up the challenge to listen to and obey the Pope.\n\nFrom that moment, there were no excuses too good for “friendly”quarreling with a Pope. The details are known concerning this tragedy.\n\nIn 1805, Paoli continued to make sure his dream of Corté University in Corsica was a reality. Napoléon’s Prefect in Corsica was Pietri. To him, Paoli outlined in great detail, what each of the chairs should be teaching, the syllibus for each Corsican instructor: the completed project should produce a responsible and educated electorate, politicians which were solely devoted to the well-being of their Corsican Nation, and an educated and responsible Clergy.* He desired a school be errected in his native glen of Rostino where all children could be educated. He also desired that 5 scholarships be available to young Corsicans to be enabled to go to the mainland and study at a University of their choice.\n\nUpon hearing of Paoli’s passing in the arms of co-patriot Giacomorsi, on 05 February 1807, [aged 82] Napoléon exclaimed, with great passion, love and admiration: “He devined that I should be something extraordinary.” He was unable-to (while Paoli was still alive) reinstate him, because, as he (Napoléon) explains: “But taken-up with Affairs of State, I rarely had the opportunity in endulging my personal desires.”\n\n_________________\n\n*: Each professor is given a two year course. First Chair: to teach the fundamentals of natural theology and revealed Catholic religion and examination of religious Texts; Second Chair was the teaching of Political Science and Philosophy, using his conscribed Constitution for the Corsican Nation, so that the students will learn to govern well and with probity. The Third Chair would go to logistics, metaphysics and math. Logic and Metaphysics were to accomplish and “direct and assist man’s natural faculties of reasoning and understanding in consideration of general ideals”; and math was to provide the foundation for future studies of the natural sciences, as well as establish a future administrator to manage the nation’s finances in the wisest manner.\n\n– On 15 February 1806 Napoléon wrote from Paris to the Pope telling him of his willingness to submit all of Italy to the laws of the Empire. Napoléon recognized the Pope as “The Spiritual Sovereign” but he did not hide his intention to remove his temporal power [despite his strong love and affection for the Holy Father]. “You’re the King of Rome and the Vicar to the World, but I am the emperor>>.\n\nUpon hearing of Paoli’s passing in the arms of co-patriot Giacomorsi, on 05 February 1807, [aged 82] Napoléon exclaimed, with great passion, love and admiration: “He devined that I should be something extraordinary.” He was unable-to (while Paoli was still alive) reinstate him, because, as he (Napoléon) explains: “But taken-up with Affairs of State, I rarely had the opportunity in endulging my personal desires.”.\n\n– On 02 February 1808 General Miollis occupies Rome. The Pope is trapped on Mount Cavallo, in the Quirinal Palace.\n\n– On 10 June 1809 (pursuant to a decree signed at Vienna on 17 May) Napoléon meets Pius VII in Rome, and the Papal States are handed over to the French Empire. –\n\nOn 06 July 1809, the Pope is exiled to Savona BY GENERAL MIOLLIS.\n\n(From “30 Days” by Lorenzo Cappelletti) we read:\n\nOnly when the Pope was already on his way to Savona, was Napoleon told of his capture. The Pope had consecrated Napoléon in 1804, and now his generals in early 1808 captured him.\n\nThe Pope was forced to stay in Savona for 5 years, from the summer of 1809 to 1812 when Napoléon gave him Fontainebleu to reside in; from whence the Pope returned to Rome only after another 2 years of negotiations with Napoléon. “Napoleon forbade looting ….In letter after angry letter he condemned” the army suppliers who\n\n“stole everything from quinine to badges.”\n\nIn a letter Napoléeon wrote in Dresden on the 21st Of May 1812, he writes:\n\n“….I have just heard that there are English vessels off Savona, and I think that the Pope must be put in a safe place….Explain to this prelate that the European situation, and the presence of the English off Savona, made the Pope’s residence there dangerous; that he must be placed in the center of the Empire; that he will be received at Fontainebleau by the bishops of the deputation; that he will occupy the same rooms as he had before; that he will see the French Cardinals, etc….You must collaborate with the Minister of Police in carrying out these measures. I wish the greatest secrecy to be observed….”\n\nFountainebleau\n\nNapoléon was afraid that, during his absence on the Russian campaign, that the English might try to abduct the Pope from Savona.\n\nI wish I had my papers available to me with the exact names and places; but “30 Days” had a beautiful exposition on this happening in reference to Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to “Les Invalides”…and later his visit to the Italian city of Savona recalling Pope Pius VII’s exile, as well… The peoples of Savona (both Catholic and Protestant) adored the Holy Father and supported the Pope in his exile….A Piedmontese soldier wrote:\n\n“It really moves the heart to hear the cries of an immense crowd of every sex, every age and even the Protestants kneeling on the ground shouting: Holy Father, bless our souls, our children…”\n\n“It is documented that on several occasions, the Pope called Napoleon ‘a dear son, a little stubborn, but always a son.’,” and on several other occasions (also in Fontainebleu) the Pope yielded to Napoleon’s request of his named candidates for the Bishopric, in-so-much that legitimate pastors were available to perform sacraments for the populace….\n\n……………….\n\nNapoléon claimed “there are no men who understand better than the soldiers and priests”; and, we could retort today with a hindsight into history, given the Emperors and Popes…. So, even in face of the challenges that Pope Pius VII gave him….\n\nwith a conflict, unresolved between the two men, (more precisely, between the Emperor and the Roman Curia), this was the only defeat of Napoleon. The military setbacks and defeats that lead to his abdication are misfortunes of war, the diplomatic failure of relationships and reversals of alliances [with the contemporary temporal Executive powers] are related to the economy; but his love of God and His Authority endured….and he did not blame God for his fall from political fortune.\n\nFor in Napoleon’s form of “physical resistance”, his moral and spiritual support was absolutely amazing, and could never be defeated.\n\nIt incorporates, in effect, a power that transcends human power; and in condensenting to this unequal battle, Napoleon certainly knew he was no match, [and] he wished whole-heartedly not to transgress Divine will.\n\nBe\n\npatient, and in a few weeks, I hope to reinstate the lost materials…and the genealogies leading up to some of the greatest American statesmen in 20th century NY!\n\nMeanwhile [to prove this is not just “my” slant on history] a “teaser”! Here is a shot of the 1801 Concordat of Bonaparte and Pius VII:\n\nPainting from Napoleon’s personal collection: The Pope\n\nOn 12 June 1789, Napoléon writing a book at the time, wrote to General Pasquale Paoli: “I am still young, and maybe rash to undertake this: but I shall be upheld by my love of thruth, of my country and my compatriots, and by the enthusiasm I never cease to derive from the prospect of an improvement of our state….”\n\nI have always had a hunger for knowledge and the truth…If people just did not put their own “spin” on things; and history was retold as it really was and happened…perhaps the need would not be as strong. Throughout all my schooling I had to accept (but not believe) all the lies and tales they brainwashed us with in the 1950’s and early ’60’s…and today all of the “hoghwash” is the accepted form and story…just look at the NY TIMES! and prime-tine TV!But the truth is out there…just that one has to do good searching, evaluation and prayer…and know the background to many things…or else one just follows the crowd and accepts what is blasted into their eyes and ears!Usually, if one finds someone…or an author worthy of one’s trust, that person can simplfy the search and make it easier. That is why we have favorite authors, politicians and leaders…etc…and favorite periodicals!To quote Dr. Robert Moynihan:\n\n“My comment is this: Many journalists, no matter how well-meaning they are, cannot report in a full, balanced way on events, especially regarding the Church, because their papers or television stations are owned by corporations with little interest in the full truth, but great interest in those portions of the truth which will help sway public opinion, bit by bit, in the direction of their agenda, which is not the agenda of the Church.\n\nThe influence of these media companies, because of the financial power behind them, often is greater than the influence of all other blogs, emails and newsletters combined.”\n\n…I do not believe in relativism! Ratzinger proved this to me…And, by the way, when Pope Benedict XVI made his Apostolic visit to France, he visited “les Invalides”…paying homage to Napoleon and his brother Joseph Bonaparte.\n\nIt IS hallowed ground….Another unknown snippet perhaps is the fact that when they opened his coffin for reinterment there, his body was found in perect intact state, uncorrupted by death so many years prior!\n\nAlso apparitions of Emperor Napoleon have been reported long after his demise…even up to this very day, by credible witnesses!\n\nWhile he was alive, and had marched into Italy, those sick and with pestilence begged for him to touch them…just like the original Aposles of Christ!:\n\nOne can still be tolerent and know the truth!reminds me of the purpose of “parenthood”!and without a past…there would not be a present!\n\nand all this creates a future…..so, YES, the past IS of utmost importance….If all humans disregarded their past….civilization would still be in the stone-age…like the Neanderthals perhaps for 30,000 years remaining the same?Stories create and reflect imagination…but they need a basis to begin….Many times evil designs govern what is preported to be historical truth…just see how Hiltler was able to twist history to his own sinister designs….and brainwash a nation…mostly youthful…(because a majority of the older generation of adults were killed during WW1) and the youthful mind he found easy to bend. …That is why he created his “Hitler Youth”….he weeded-out all those who thought differently, as all dictators have a habit of doing.\n\nNapoléoné was different! He fostered public education in a positive way…and would never dream of “the Burning book campaigns”/ and mass deicides of Hitler and Stalin and their like!…I would NEVER term Napoléoné a dictator;..and, he did prove that a simple Corsican could now dominate over his/their former supressors: The Italians and the French! He also opened Egypt to the world..and found the Rosetta Stone! His father was Pasqale Paoli’s secretary. Please!: Read some of his literary works..You will be impressed; no one evil could write such heart touching and pure �literature!\n\nNapoleonic quote.\n\n“He who views a battlefield without tears lets many men die needlessly….”\n\nNapoleon’s Generals did a number of things contrare to his wishes…one obviously was the kidnapping of the Pope,. (From “30 Days” by Lorenzo Cappelletti) we read:\n\nOnly when the Pope was already on his way to Savona, was Napoleon told of his capture. The Pope had consecrated Napoleon in 1804, and now his generals in early 1808 captured him.

Letitia (Bonaparte’s mother) “acknowledged as much in a letter dated 27 May 1818 to the Secretary of State: ‘The only consolation granted me is that is knowing that the Holy Father forgets the past to remember only the affection that he shows for all my family. We find no support and assylum except in the Papal govenment , and our gratitude is as great as the benefit we receive.’ “….Italians will, obviously, be always vicely prejudiced concerning the Bonapartes….But Manzoni wrote the beautiful and now famous eulogy upon Napolean’s passing:\n\n“Beautiful immortal,! Beneficient\n\nFaith inured to triumps!\n\nWrite this, lighten your heart,\n\nFor more supurb grandeur\n\nTo the dishonor of Golgoltha\n\nNever yet did stoop.\n\nFrom the tired ashes\n\nScatter each mocking word:\n\nThe God who brings down and raises,\n\nWho wearies and Who consoles\n\nOn the deserted deathbed\n\nBeside him lay down. “\n\n********************************************************************************\n\nI just need time! as my boxes cannot be accessed temporarally…I was supposed to be moved-in to my new residence already; but the legal work took extra time and now I am rescheduled for 11 OCTOBER..”Columbus Day”!!….another malalignment in History!…But there is another story to tell…. My original site was so perfect and good…but, as I said YUKU destroyed it over a video!!!When Etienne Bernier (of the Tuileries) told Napoleon of the numerous soldiers kneeling at stone calvaries before going into battle singing the “Vexilla Regis” and Salvé Regina with enormous religious ferver and resistance to the athiestic policies being forced upon his people of Brittany and those of the Vendée of France, Napoleon declared to him:\n\n“I should be proud to be a Vendéen…surely something must be done for people who have made such sacrifices….”\n\nWhen Pius VII requested in the new Concordat that Roman-Catholicism be declared the official religion of the State of France, 16 days later Napoleon approved and fully granted his request. Roman Catholicism was “the religion of the great majority of the French people” and the religion professed by the Consuls. Worship was to be free and public….But Napoleon was only able pass his Concordat through the Tribunal by merely 7 votes! ….\n\nThis was Napoleon’s personal cross he wore under his vestments.\n\nBrando as Napoléoné in 1954. QUOTES:”…I have received Cardinal Caprara, Your Holiness’ legate, with great pleasure. Peace has been signed with England, Russia, Portugal and the Porte. I hasten to send this information, well knowing the interest Your Holiness takes in the happiness and peace of nations….”[10 Oct. 1801]”…I am a religious man; but I am not a bigoted idiot….For the Pope, I am Charlemagne, because like Charlemagne, I unite the crowns of France and of the Lombards, and my Empire touches the East…”\n\n[in reponse to a letter from the Pope, 1806]”….Holy Father, ….I entreat you to please put an end to this quarrel….”\n\n[22 August 1807]To Pope Pius VII: “Holy Father, I hasten to send one of the Officers of my household to express my gratification at what the Bishop of Nantes has told me of the satisfactory condition\n\nof Your Holiness’ health, for I had been for a moment alarmed this summer on hearing that Your Holiness had been seriously indisposed. The new residence of Your Holiness will give us\n\nan opportunity for meeting, and I have it much at heart to declare that, not-with-standing all that has passed, I have always maintained the same sentiments of friendship for Your Holiness. Perhaps now we can reach a settlement of all those questions that divide State and Church. I, on my side, am altogether disposed that way, SO THAT IT WILL DEPEND ENTIRELY ON YOUR HOLINESS.”\n\n[29 Dec- 1812, showing his respect for the Authority of the Pope]”I closed the gulf of anarchy and brought order out of chaos. I rewarded merit regardless of birth, or wealth, wherever I found it. I abolished fuedalism and restored equality to all regardless of religion and before the law….”\n\nNapoléon had NO intentions of turning Notre Dame Cathedral into a pagan temple!!! So many lies have been spread about him since his departure, that what is universally accepted and “taught” about him is almost hard to comprehend!…and where does the truth lie?\n\nA “UNITED EUROPE”…his dream was fulfilled with the “EUROPEAN UNION”\n\n#8\n\n[url]\n\n[-]\n\nvan Beethoven’s “Song of Joy” is the anthem of the European Union….\n\nNot only was Napoleon responsible for the return of Roman-Catholicism to France; but Napoleon’s elder brother, Joseph\n\nexiled himself (after Waterloo) to Point Breeze, New Jersey (USA), where he cohabited with Ann Savage (de la Folie) for 17 years before returning to Europe.\n\nTheir first daughter, Pauline Anne died as a young child; but their second daughter, Caroline Charlotte, lived to have 5 children with her husband Zebulon Benton. Two of those children were female, named Charlotte and Zènaide. Zènaide married Emile laCoste. Their son, Felix Joseph laCoste, married a women named Isobelle. They had a son, Maurice laCoste, a reknowned New York diplomat.\n\nBut for a partial restoration, one can read about the enormous contributions made by Napoleon’s brothers:\n\nSTROUD: “The Man who had been King” for Joseph Bonaparte (ref: images after p. 82 + page 217)\n\nSERGEANT: “The Burlesque Napoleon,….” for Jerome Bonaparte\n\nSTROUD: “The Emperor of Nature” for Charles-Lucienne Bonaparte\n\nand the life of Elizabeth Patterson and her children have been retold in many…but non-perfect….editions, i.e.: “A Corsican on the shores of the Chesapeake”—take note, that Charles Joseph Bonaparte, Betsy’s youngest grandson, served president Teddy Roosevelt as a great “trust-buster” , Secretary of the Navy and then Attorney-General …wherein he created the FBI ! He devoted the last year of his life to Catholic Charities, dying in 1921.\n\n,\n\nThe story of the early 20th century NY diplomat is another story….\n\nAmericans and Corsicans share a blood-tie stronger than English prejudice and Amer-Anglicized History Books care to admit…..And, the progeny is overwhelming (which produced historical shapers) and some of America’s great statesmen.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Divinity played a strong part in this unfolding of the history of Western Civilization.\n\nNAPOLEONIC QUOTE:\n\n“…My crown procedes from God and the will of my people. Only to God and my people am I answerable for it. For the Court of Rome, I shall always be Charlemagne…..”\n\nAt the end of the film, “Desirée”, Marlon Brando (as Napoleoné Buonaparté) significantly says to Desirée\n\n[just prior to his free-willed exile to St. Helene]: “Was my dream of a liberated, united Europe, consisting of one people,…with brotherly bonds and equality at court and intercommerce by one banking system, so as to eliminate the thought of future wars , so wrong? Was any cost too high to achieve this for our future children?”\n\nPics from “Deserée”:\n\nMarlon Brando above with Marilyn Monroe, who Brando was thoroughly convinced that Bobby Kennedy murdered her…and the next is with HIlee Salasi, King of Ethiopia.\n\nBefore the British made the final decision to exile Napoléon to St Helena, Napoléon really desired to remain his final years…”out of politics” in the United States. He even gave specific instructions to his brother Joseph…about what to bring, the titles of books, etc…[and many of those titles dealt with the framework and early history of the U.S]\n\nJoseph made it, obviously, but he did not, ofcourse….\n\nNapolèone Bonaparte sent this letter [translated by J.M, Thompson] to his uncle, the Archbishop of Lyon, Joseph Fesch, it begins as follows:\n\nROUEN, 02 NUVEMBRE 1802\n\n“I arrived at Rouen three days ago. I am very pleased with the people in this Department, and have reason to be\n\n(This poignant letter reveals Napoleone’s devotion to honesty, truth, The Holy Roman Church, the Papacy and obedience to God‘s desires, rather than the idolatry of man.)\n\nCRONIN writes: “During his 5 1/2 years on St. Helena, right up until his final illness, Napoléon remained unbroken in spirit. Napoléon hoped that a new government would come to power in England. If freed, he planned to sail to America; and he desired that his history go down undistorted. He forgave everyone, just as the example that Christ gave to him.” He told Joseph, who was living in the United States at the time, that his daughters should marry the decendants of Washington or Jefferson, and then return to Europe….Lucien should marry his children into the princely families of Rome and in the future produce a Cardinal or Pope. [One of Lucien’s grandsons in fact did become a Cardinal!]\n\nFirmly declaring his Catholicity, he declared: “Only a madman declares that he will die without a Confessor. There is so much that one does not know…that one cannot explain!” Napoléon wished to have a priest beside him.He became increasingly religious and thought much of his devout mother. (An Austrian mystic, a Madam Kleinsmuller, had a vision of seeing Napoléon freed from St Helena [transported out of exile by angels].\n\nCardinal Fesch [his uncle] and his mother deeply believed this; and even the Pope was sympathetic to Napoléon’s plight.)….Napoléon had his dining-room turned into a Chapel, he heard Mass there every Sunday, and remarked, “I hope the Holy Father will not find fault with us…\n\nWe have firmly become Christians again.”…and said also “I should have lived to be 80 if they had not brought me to this vile place.” Remarkably, in in an early geography school note-book of Napoléon, we find circled by him (as a boy) the distant Isle of St. Helena. Eventually, as he knew his own father’s symtoms, he knew and believed he was dying of stomach cancer; which he also knew could be inherited….He dictated his “Last will and testament”.\n\nCRONIN writes:\n\nNapoleon began by saying that he died in the Apostolic Roman religion, in the bosom of which he had been propheticly born….He had no thought of being cremated, and publicly forgave everyone; but revealed his thoughts about the the British hierarchy: “I die prematurely, assasinated by the English oligarchy and its hired killer: The English nation will not be slow in avenging me” He thought of Pasquale Paoli dying in England, as an exile in 1807, with his remains in a Roman Catholic London Church graveyard. He did not want his remains pickled in some British museum or, be laid in Westminster….\n\nIt is also remarkable that he remembered all his friends even from boyhood by name….and chose the Seine for his final resting place. CRONIN writes: “He continued to make codicils right up to the night of 28/29 April, when he bequeathed to his son all his property in Corsica. The codicil was dictated in the dark to Marchand who had no paper in hand, and wrote it upon a playing-card.” (Unfortunately, his son was to die in an Austrian prison as a POLITICAL-PRISONER by a people fearful he would accept his title as King of Rome, at the premature age of only 21 in the year 1832)….\n\nNapoléon called-in the youngest priest Vignali, asking him to give him Holy Communion and Extreme Unction. “You will set-up an altar in the next room, expose the Blessed Sacrament; and say the prayers for the dying. I was born into the Catholic Faith; I wish to fulfil the duties it imposes and receive the help that it affords.”\n\nOn 03 May the doctors confirmed that it was impossible to have him receive the actual Holy Communion host…for he could barely swallow liquids…but the Abbé Vignali (a Corsican himself) administed the Supreme Unction. It is confirmed that partaking of either of the species singularly…the Bread, or the Wine…is taking the Full Body of Christ. The Abbé annointed him with chrism: The eyelids, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the palms of the hands and whites of the feet…\n\nthat sins commited though each of the 5 senses might be fully forgiven…and he concluded with the prayer: “Deliver Lord the soul of your Servant, as you delivered Moses from the hands of the Pharoah, King of the Egyptians; deliver Lord the soul of your Servant, as you delivered St. Peter and St. Paul from prison.” “At 10 o’clock on the morning of 09 May, the Abbé Vignali celebrated Requiem Mass….The Abbé Vignali blessed the grave and recited prayers….” There really was a Saint Napoléoné.\n\nWhen Napoléon Bonaparte became Emperor, showing that his birthname had significant Catholic origins [known as“giorno onomastico Catholico”], he (by an imperial decree of 1806) imposed the celebration of Saint-Napoleon on 15 August , the anniversary of the signing of the Concordat restoring the Catholic religion in France. This date also coincided with the anniversary of his birth (August 15, 1769). This is the story [from the “WIKIPEDIA“] of St. Napoléoné:\n\nNapoleon Orsini, son of Rinaldo Orsini, brother of PopeNicolas III, Was born in Rome.[1] He began his ecclesiastical career as a canon of the cathedral chapters of Paris and Rheims[2].At the Consistory of 16 May 1288, Nicolas IV gave him the hat of a Cardinal-Deacon of St. Adrian[2].\n\nBefore the cardinals of the family, Saint Dominique resurrects Napoleone Orsini, nephew of Cardinal Napoleon Orsini. Fresco ofAlessandro Fei said “the barber” to Santa Maria Novella of Florence\n\nFrom the 8 March 1306, Clement V sent him as legate to the Papacy (Holy See) in Italy[2]. After three years of fruitless attempts, on the 12 June 1309 , he joined the Pope (who had settled into the convent of the Dominicans at Avignon). Afterward, he lived in Carpentras within which he had established his Roman-Curia.\n\nHis maneuvers in the conclave of Lyon\n\nCoat of arms of the Orsini family: Gules, three bands of gold to the head of a commission to a rose gules buttercups\n\nAfter the death of Clement V, Napoléoné Orsini had to wait two years to build a new conclave at Lyon. He began by working in the Dominican Church in early March 1316., but with some ill-will. On 28 June, Philip V of France, the then regent of France, stormed the cardinals with his troops, and forceably installed them in Guigue Forez [then a walled Fortress]. His remedy seemed radical.\n\nHowever, he still had to wait until 7 August 1316 to have the decision on the new Pope, The proposed three Cardinali [Napoléoné Orsini with his colleagues Francesco Caetani and Arnaud de Pellegrue] elected Jacques Dueze, former Bishop of Avignon and Cardinal of Porto.\n\nPhilip V attacked the fervent advocates who desired to have the Papacy back in Rome. He offered the Papacy fiefs in Languedoc and an annuity on the toll Pont-Saint-Esprit.\n\nThe protector of Ubertino Casale\n\nThe “cloth burned rapidly” [a strong quarrel] between the Pope and the Franciscans requiring the total poverty of the Church[3]. Cardinal Orsini, by whom John XXII had been elected, took under his protection Ubertino Casale, the leader of the protesters. under whom Casale made his confession and penance.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 1322, Orsini was requested by the Pope to make for him an Encyclical on the issue of poverty. His findings were very convincing, but cautious. Cardinal Orsini got rid of his “troublesome penitent” by unloading Ubertino Casale onto the King of Aragon.\n\nHis struggle against the heretical Pope\n\nArms of John XXII\n\nJohn XXII plans disturbed the Church with his “beautific-vision” declaration. Everything began with a sermon, on 1er November 1331. Commenting on a text of Bernard of Clairvaux, The Pope affirmed that the souls of the elect do not immediately enjoy the beatific-vision.\n\nBut the Pontiff gave two weeks later an explanation that “he had to wait until doomsday for the souls enjoy eternal life.” The declaration was improper; especially since, o"
