I figure he’d marry as a “minor” prince of Hesse rather than a Danish prince (despite the fact that he’s likely raised in Denmark his whole life)\n\nSo my question is this: how does Caroline having two boys affect things? Does the crown pass to Christian VIII (like OTL) or does Frederik VI fiddle with the succession laws to allow his grandson to succeed him? Or does it go Christian VIII, Frederik VII (as OTL), then jump to Karl Ludwig (instead of the Glucksburgs as OTL)\n\n@King of Danes @Jürgen @Zulfurium\n\nSo my question is this: how does Caroline having two boys affect things?

I think that the throne would still go to C8 and F7 here due to them being so closely related and mainline Oldenburgs but afterwards I could imagine it going to Karl Ludwig. Despite not being an Oldenburg (or a cadet branch like the Glucksburgs), he is raised in Denmark and is the old king’s grandson.
