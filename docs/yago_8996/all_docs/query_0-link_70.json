        "text": "Hollywood royalty collided with Napoleonic royalty as the two descended upon the opening of one of the biggest film events of the year. The UK premiere of Sir Ridley Scott’s Napoleon biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby took place on Thursday night at the Odeon Luxe in Leicester Square. However, Phoenix (who plays the titular emperor) was not the only Napoleon to conquer the red carpet. Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoleon, the great-great-great-grandnephew of Napoleon Bonaparte attended to see how Phoenix depicted his ancestor. The present-day Napoleon was at the premiere with his wife Olympia, Princess Napoleon. Olympia has her own royal connections, being a great-great-granddaughter of Ludwig III of Bavaria. She is also a descendant of the little corporal.\n\nThe young Napoleon has worked as a financial analyst for companies such as Morgan Stanley. In 2022, he co-founded Leon Capital, a private equity firm. Prior to his professional career, he studied at Harvard Business School, where he received an MBA. He has been married to Olympia since 2019 when the couple had a lavish wedding in the heart of Paris attended by Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. They currently live in London, and celebrated the birth of their first child last year.\n\nRead More\n\nInside Napoleon I’s fascinating dynasty, 200 years on, as Alix, Princess Napoléon marks her 98th birthday\n\nJean-Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte, the great-great-great nephew of the famous Emperor, is forging quite the business empire of his own\n\nMeanwhile, other key figures on the red carpet included director Sir Ridley Scott, Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix and BAFTA winner Vanessa Kirby. Kirby looked ravishing in a one-shouldered red gown, while Phoenix donned a suave black suit. This marks one of the first major press events for a Hollywood production since an agreement was reached on the SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nNapoleon will be released in cinemas on 22 November. The film focuses on the rise of Napoleon during his most well-known military conflicts and his relationship with wife Empress Joséphine. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw gave the film five stars calling it ‘an outrageously enjoyable cavalry charge of a movie’; Tatler called the film an ‘complex portrait of the fabled emperor’.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is the real Empress Joséphine Bonaparte? Ahead of Ridley Scott’s upcoming biopic, Tatler explores the life of the beguiling first wife of Napoleon\n\nPlayed by Vanessa Kirby in Ridley Scott's upcoming blockbuster, Tatler looks into the real life of the 18th century aristocrat who rose to the French throne after a chance meeting at a society ball"
