In October 1804 Hortense gave birth to her second son. The Pope, who was in Paris for the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor, christened the child Napoleon Louis.

Furniture (cabinets, table and chairs, made for Louis-Napoléon and Hortense) in the Royal Palace Amsterdam. Nowadays this is part of one of the guests appartments. Picture.

The Royal Palace Amsterdam has the largest collection of complete sets of Empire ameublement, including clocks, chandeliers, candelabras, outside France. This was a remnant of Louis-Naopléon's attempt to change the Amsterdam City Hall into a palace.
