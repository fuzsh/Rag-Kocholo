        "text": "In the early 1900s, a young woman called Siranush Shirinyan lived in the town of Sivas, in central-eastern Anatolia, where she worked as a carpet weaver in Albert Aliotti's carpet factory. She was born in Sivas in 1898, barely two years after anti-Armenian violence had swept the entire region. One of eight siblings, the violence of 1896 left her father unable to work, so the responsibility for the family's subsistence fell primarily on the young shoulders of Siranush and her three older sisters, who stayed at home to work as weavers. Siranush began working to earn a crust at the age of eight – not especially young for the period – when she went to carpet magnate Albert Aliotti's factory, recently established in the city.Footnote 1 Siranush thus became just one of many Armenian girls and young women in Sivas whose labour became the main source of income for the violence-stricken community.\n\nWhile keeping in mind the stories of Siranush and many other Armenian young women and girls, in this article I shall examine the relationship between violence and different labour regimes and the discourses built around them in various regions in Anatolia after the anti-Armenian violence in the late Ottoman Empire, before World War I. The violence was one result of complex developments in the context of an Ottoman state that was modernizing and centralizing, and of the deeds of various social actors in the second half of the nineteenth century. It included social, economic, demographic, and diplomatic dimensions, which stemmed from the power vacuum in the regions inhabited by the Armenians and was affected by the period's increasing militarization. Moreover, an Armenian mercantile bourgeoisie was on the rise, replacing older hierarchies, and Armenians were increasingly criminalized in state discourse and practice. All that had the effect of transforming the “Armenian Question” from a diplomatic to a socio-political matter, ultimately only to be “solved” during World War I."
