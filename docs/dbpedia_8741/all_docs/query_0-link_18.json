        "text": "History\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Bagratuni Dynasty of Armenia in 1045, Armenia was successively occupied by Byzantines and, following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, by the Seljuks.[7] Khosrov, the first historically traceable member of the Zakarid family, moved from Armenia to southern Georgia during the Seljuk invasions in the early 11th century. Over the next hundred years, the Zakarids gradually gained prominence at the Georgian court, where they became known as Mkhargrdzeli (Long-shoulder) or in Armenian: ÔµÖÕ¯Õ¡ÕµÕ¶Õ¡Õ¢Õ¡Õ¦Õ¸ÖÕ¯, (Yerkaynabazuk). A family legend says that this name was a reference to their Achaemenid ancestor Artaxerxes II the \"Longarmed\" (404â358 BC).[8][9]\n\nDuring the 12th century, the Bagratids of Georgia enjoyed a resurgence in power, and managed to expand into Muslim occupied Armenia.[10] The former Armenian capital Ani would be captured five times between 1124 and 1209.[11] Under King George III of Georgia, Sargis Zakarian was appointed as governor of Ani in 1161. In 1177, the Zakarids supported the monarchy against the insurgents during the rebellion of Prince Demna and the Orbeli family. The uprising was suppressed, and George III persecuted his opponents and elevated the Zakarids.\n\nDespite some complications in the reign of George III, the successes continued in the reign of the Queen Tamar.[10] This was chiefly due to the Armenian generals Zakare and Ivane.[12][13] Around the year 1199, they retook the city of Ani, and in 1201, Ani became the capital of Zakarid Armenia.[10] Armenia was often governed as an independent state by the Zakarians.[4] The volume of trade seems to have increased in the early 13th century, and under the Zakarid princes the city prospered, at least until the area was occupied by the Mongols in 1237. The Zakarians amassed a great fortune, governing all of northern Armenia; Zakare and his descendants ruled in northwestern Armenia with Ani as their capital, while Ivane and his offspring ruled eastern Armenia, including the city of Dvin. Eventually, their territories came to resemble those of Bagratid Armenia.[7]\n\nZakare and Ivane commanded the Georgian-Armenian armies for almost three decades, achieving major victories at Shamkor in 1195 and Basian in 1203 and leading raids into northern Persia in 1210.\n\nWhen the Khwarezms invaded the region, Dvin was ruled by the aging Ivane, who had given Ani to his nephew Shahnshah, son of Zakare. Dvin was lost, but Kars and Ani did not surrender.[10]\n\nHowever, when Mongols took Ani in 1236, they had a friendly attitude towards the Zakarids.[10] They confirmed Shanshe in his fief, and even added to it the fief of Avag, son of Ivane. Further, in 1243, they gave Akhlat to the princess Tâamtâa, daughter of Ivane.[10]"
