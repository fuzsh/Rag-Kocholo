Its history is divided into successive reigns by three royal dynasties: Orontid (321 BC–200 BC), Artaxiad (189 BC–12 AD) and Arsacid (52–428).\n\nThe root of the kingdom lies in one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia called Armenia (Satrapy of Armenia) (549–331 BC), which was formed from the territory of the Kingdom of Ararat (860 BC–590 BC) after it was conquered by the Median Empire in 590 BC. From the 6th century BC, the Satrapy of Armenia was ruled by the Orontid Dynasty (570–201 BC), who were subjects of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nThe Orontid dynasty ruled as satraps of the Achaemenid Empire for three centuries until the empire’s defeat against Alexander the Great’s Macedonian Empire at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. After Alexander’s death in 323 BC, a Macedonian general who served under Alexander the Great named Neoptolemus obtained Armenia until he died in 321 BC.\n\nThe Orontids returned, not as satraps, but as kings. Orontes III recognized himself as independent, thus elevating the former Armenian satrapy into a kingdom, giving birth to the kingdoms of Armenia. He also defeated the Thessalian commander Menon, who wanted to capture Sper’s gold mines.\n\nNeoptolemus\n\nAccording to Arrian Neoptolemus belonged to the race of the Aeacidae, so he probably was related to the family of the kings of Epirus. Neoptolemus is mentioned as serving in the Macedonian royal guards and distinguished himself particularly at the siege of Gaza, 332 BC, of which he was the first to scale the walls.\n\nLittle has been written about him during the subsequent campaigns of Alexander, however he appears to have earned a reputation as an able soldier. Dexippus lists the satrapy of Carmania as assigned to Neoptolemus after the death of Alexander; however, Diodorus and Justin assign this satrapy to Tlepolemus instead.\n\nCarmania (Greek: Karmanía, Old Persian: Karmanâ, Middle Persian: Kirmān) is a historical region that approximately corresponds to the modern province of Kerman and was a province of the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Arsacid, and Sasanian Empire. The region bordered Persia in the west, Gedrosia in the south-east, Parthia in the north (later known as Abarshahr), and Aria to the north-east. Carmania was considered part of Ariana.\n\nA. G. Roos revised Dexippus’ text to assign Carmania to Tlepolemus and Armenia to Neoptolemus. Pat Wheatley and Waldemar Heckel found this revision to be unlikely to represent the original text, and considered it more likely that the fragment of the text of Dexippus includes a scribal error, as “Neoptolemus” is an easy corruption of “Tlepolemus”.\n\nNeoptolemus apparently campaigned in Armenia after the death of Alexander, but his official status in this area is unclear; he might have been a strategos rather than a satrap. Neoptolemus managed only to create havoc in Armenia, which suggests that he wasn’t cooperating with any existing satrap.\n\nAs Neoptolemus had a reputation of being restless and unsettled, Perdiccas (355 BC – 321/320 BC), a general in Alexander the Great’s army, who participated in Alexander’s campaign against Achaemenid Persia, regarded him with suspicion.\n\nFollowing Alexander’s death, Perdiccas had rose to become supreme commander of the imperial army and regent for Alexander’s half brother and intellectually disabled successor, Philip Arridaeus (Philip III).\n\nHe was the first of the Diadochi who fought for control over Alexander’s empire but in his attempts to establish a power base and stay in control of the empire, he managed to make enemies of key generals in the Macedonian army, Antipater, Craterus and Antigonus Monophtalmus, who decided to revolt against the regent.\n\nSo in 321 BC, when Perdiccas set out for Ptolemaic Egypt, he placed Neoptolemus under the command of Eumenes of Cardia (362 – 316 BC), who was told to exercise particular vigilance regarding Neoptolemus.\n\nEumenes was a native of Cardia in the Thracian Chersonese, although he was suspected to be Scythian. He was employed as a private secretary by Philip II of Macedon and after Philip’s death (336 BC) by Alexander the Great, whom he accompanied into Asia. After Alexander’s death (323 BC), Eumenes took command of a large body of Greek and Macedonian soldiers fighting in support of Alexander’s son, Alexander IV.\n\nPerdiccas’ suspicions turned out to be well founded: Neoptolemus immediately entered into correspondence with the hostile Macedonian leaders, Antipater and Craterus, and, on being ordered by Eumenes to join him with his contingent, refused to comply. In response, Eumenes immediately marched against him, defeated his army, and compelled all the Macedonian troops in his service to take the oath of fidelity to Perdiccas.\n\nNeoptolemus managed to escape with a small body of cavalry and joined Craterus, whom he persuaded to march immediately against Eumenes, while the latter was still celebrating his victory and unprepared for a fresh attack. But their cautious adversary was not taken by surprise and met his enemies in a pitched battle.\n\nDuring this battle, Neoptolemus commanded the left wing, on which he was opposed to Eumenes himself; and the two leaders, who were bitter personal enemies, sought each other out during the battle and engaged in single combat, in which, after a desperate struggle, Neoptolemus was slain by Eumenes.\n\nTlepolemus\n\nTlepolemus was the son of Pythophanes and one of the hetairoi of Alexander the Great, who was joined in the government of the Parthians and Hyrcanii with Amminapes, a Parthian, whom Alexander had appointed satrap of those provinces.\n\nThe Companions (Greek: hetairoi) were the elite cavalry of the Macedonian army from the time of king Philip II of Macedon, achieved their greatest prestige under Alexander the Great, and have been regarded as the first or among the first shock cavalry used in Europe. Chosen Companions formed the elite guard of the king (Somatophylakes).\n\nAt a later period Tlepolemus was appointed by Alexander satrap of Carmania, which he retained on the death of Alexander in 323 BC, and also at the fresh division of the provinces at Triparadisus in 321.\n\nIn the following years, Tlepolemus joined a coalition formed by governors of Upper Satrapies with the purpose of fighting Peithon, later assisting Eumenes in his war against Antigonus. Tlepolemus commanded 800 horsemen from Carmania in the Battle of Paraitakene, stationed on the right wing.\n\nAmminapes\n\nAmminapes was a Parthian who was appointed satrap of the Parthians and Hyrcanii by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE. Amminapes knew Alexander from his youth at the Macedonian court, where he remained in exile together with Artabazos II and a Persian nobleman named Sisines, after conflicts with the Achaemenid ruler Artaxerxes III.\n\nHe was later able to return to the Achaemenid Empire and was given responsibilities in Egypt. He was in Egypt with the satrap Mazakes in late 332 BCE when they surrendered the country to Alexander, and he is the one who convinced Mazakes to do so and helped negotiate the terms of the surrender. He then joined the army of Alexander the Great.\n\nAmminapes later received in 330 BCE the satrapy of Parthia and Hyrcania as a reward for his services, but he was still joined with the Macedonian general Tlepolemus, who was later appointed by Alexander satrap of Carmania, which he retained on the death of Alexander in 323 BC, and also at the fresh division of the provinces at Triparadisus in 321.\n\nAmminapes was probably soon replaced by Phrataphernes, who was still in charge of the satrapy in 324, and was then succeeded by his son Pharismanes, a Parthian, son of Phrataphernes, who was appointed Hellenistic satrap of the Parthians and Hyrcanii after his father, circa 320 BCE.\n\nMithrenes\n\nMithrenes was a Persian commander of the force that garrisoned the citadel of Sardis. According to Cyril Toumanoff, he was also a member of the Orontid dynasty. Waldemar Heckel, on the other hand, considers Mithrenes to be a Persian noble of unknown family background.\n\nAfter the battle of the Granicus Mithrenes surrendered voluntarily to Alexander the Great, and was treated by him with great distinction. Mithrenes was present in the Macedonian camp after the Battle of Issus (also Issos) between the Hellenic League led by Alexander the Great and the Achaemenid Empire, led by Darius III, in the second great battle of Alexander’s conquest of Asia in southern Anatolia in 333 BC, and Alexander ordered him to visit the captured family of Darius III and assure them that Darius was alive, before changing his mind and assigning the duty to Leonnatus instead.\n\nHe fought for Alexander at Gaugamela, and ironically he was fighting against an army that included his father Orontes II. Afterwards, Alexander appointed him Satrap of Armenia. Mithrenes disappears from the historical record after this appointment, and his ultimate fate is unknown. It’s not clear whether he actually managed to take control of his satrapy.\n\nAccording to Curtius, in his speech given at Hecatompylos in 330 BC, Alexander the Great listed Armenia among lands conquered by Macedonians, implying that Mithrenes succeeded in conquering it; on the other hand, Justin reproduced Pompeius Trogus’ rendition of a speech attributed to Mithridates VI of Pontus, which mentioned that Alexander did not conquer Armenia.\n\nDexippus lists the satrapy of Carmania as assigned to Neoptolemus after the death of Alexander; however, Diodorus and Justin assign this satrapy to Tlepolemus instead. A. G. Roos emended the text of Dexippus to assign Carmania to Tlepolemus and Armenia to Neoptolemus.\n\nPat Wheatley and Waldemar Heckel found this emendation to be unlikely to represent the original text, and considered it more likely that the fragment of the text of Dexippus includes a scribal error, as “Neoptolemus” is an easy corruption of “Tlepolemus”.\n\nNeoptolemus apparently campaigned in Armenia after the death of Alexander, but his official status in this area is unclear; he might have been a strategos rather than a satrap. Neoptolemus managed only to create havoc in Armenia, which suggests that he wasn’t cooperating with any existing satrap.\n\nDiodorus and Polyaenus mention a man named Orontes, who was a Satrap of Armenia during the Second War of the Diadochi; Diodorus adds that this Orontes was a friend of Peucestas. Edward Anson and Waldemar Heckel consider this satrap to be the same Orontes who fought for Darius III in the Battle of Gaugamela; the authors state that Mithrenes may have perished in an unsuccessful attempt to wrest Armenia from Orontes.\n\nOn the other hand, N. G. L. Hammond interpreted the sources as indicating that Armenia was already in submission when Mithrenes was sent there from Babylon late in 331 BC, that Mithrenes took it over as satrap ruling on behalf of the new Macedonian regime, and that he was left as satrap in 323 BC when Perdiccas let some satrapies remain under the existing satraps; in 317 BC Mithrenes was no longer satrap but had been replaced by Orontes.\n\nHammond noted that Strabo described the satrapy of Armenia as small compared to the size of Armenia under Artaxias I and Zariadres; on the basis of this passage Hammond suggested that Mithrenes’ rule may not have extended as far as Lake Van.\n\nAfter the death of Neoptolemus, and during the struggles among the Diadochi, it seems Mithrenes not only returned to his ancestral seat but declared himself king.\n\nOne of the inscriptions from the Mount Nemrut detailing the ancestry of Antiochus I Theos of Commagene lists an ancestor whose name was incompletely preserved and who was a son of Aroandas, the second ancestor of Antiochus mentioned in the inscriptions from Mount Nemrut who bore that name (identified with the Orontes who was a commander in the Battle of Gaugamela by Karl Julius Beloch and Herman Brijder; Friedrich Karl Dörner found this identification questionable).\n\nErnst Honigmann emended the name of the son of Aroandas as [Mιθρ]άνην, [Mithr]anen. However, Friedrich Karl Dörner and John H. Young (1996) interpreted the first preserved letter of the name as a delta, so that the name of the son of Aroandas ended with -δανης, -danes. Herman Brijder (2014) also interpreted the inscription as indicating that name of the son of Aroandas II ended with -danes.\n\nOrontes II\n\nOrontes II was a Persian noble living in the 4th century BC. He is probably to be identified as the satrap of Armenia under Darius III, and may in fact have succeeded Darius in this position when Darius ascended the throne of Persia in 336 BC.\n\nArrian lists Orontes and a certain Mithraustes as two commanders of Armenian forces in the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. The interpretation of this passage is controversial, with different historians interpreting it as indicating that Mithraustes commanded the infantry, or that there were two different contingents of Armenian cavalry in this battle, or even that Armenia was divided into two parts ruled by two satraps.\n\nOrontes fought at the Battle of Gaugamela on the Persian right flank with 40,000 units of infantry and 7,000 of cavalry under his command, where he died. His son, Mithrenes, Satrap of Lydia, had joined Alexander the Great after being defeated at Sardis in 334 BC, and fought at Gaugamela on the side of Alexander. After the battle, Mithrenes was made Satrap of Armenia by Alexander.\n\nThe ultimate fate of Orontes is unknown. Diodorus and Polyaenus mention a man named Orontes, who was a Satrap of Armenia during the Second War of the Diadochi; Diodorus adds that this Orontes was a friend of Peucestas.\n\nAndrew Burn, Edward Anson and Waldemar Heckel consider this satrap to be the same Orontes who fought for Darius III in the Battle of Gaugamela; Anson and Heckel state that Mithrenes may have perished in an unsuccessful attempt to wrest Armenia from Orontes.\n\nHeckel stated that in all likehood Armenia, which was bypassed by the Macedonian army, was never part of Alexander’s empire. Anson, on the other hand, considered it likely that at some point after the Battle of Gaugamela Orontes made his submission to Alexander, who later put him in charge of the Greater Armenia.\n\nN. G. L. Hammond interpreted the sources as indicating that Armenia was already in submission when Mithrenes was sent there from Babylon late in 331 BC, that Mithrenes took it over as satrap ruling on behalf of the new Macedonian regime, and that he was left as satrap in 323 BC when Perdiccas let some satrapies remain under the existing satraps; in 317 BC Mithrenes was no longer satrap but had been replaced by Orontes.\n\nOne of the inscriptions from the Mount Nemrut detailing the ancestry of Antiochus I Theos of Commagene mentions an ancestor whose name was incompletely preserved, and who was a son of Aroandas. This Aroandas (Orontes) is inferred to be the second ancestor of Antiochus listed in the inscriptions from Mount Nemrut who bore that name, succeeding the first Aroandas, who in turn was the son of Artasyrus and who married Rhodogune, the daughter of Artaxerxes II of Persia.\n\nFriedrich Karl Dörner and John H. Young (1996) interpreted the first preserved letter of the name of the son of Aroandas II as a delta, so that the name ended with -δανης, -danes. The authors considered this reading to be important, because it settled the proposal of Ernst Honigmann’s ([Mιθρ]άνην), as well as one of the suggestions presented by Salomon Reinach ([Όστ]άνην). Brijder (2014) also interpreted the inscription as indicating that name of the son of Orontes II ended with -danes.\n\nAroandas II mentioned in an inscription from Mount Nemrut was identified with the Orontes who was a commander in the Battle of Gaugamela by Karl Julius Beloch and Herman Brijder. This Orontes was also inferred to be a descendant of Orontes I and his wife Rhodoghune, possibly their son or grandson.\n\nOn the other hand, Friedrich Karl Dörner was unsure whether ancient citations of connections of the bearers of the name Aroandas/Orontes with Armenia or their status as leaders of Armenian military units are compelling reasons for assuming that they were relatives.\n\nDörner considered it very questionable whether Aroandas II mentioned in an inscription from Mount Nemrut is identical with the Orontes of Alexander’s time; the author stressed the need to consider that in the course of the 4th century BC, besides the two ancestors of Antiochus I of Commagene, other bearers of the same name may have played a part in Persian politics.\n\nOrontes III\n\nIn his reign Orontes III struggled for control of the Kingdom of Sophene with king Antiochus II Theos until being defeated in 272 BC and was forced to pay a large tribute which included 300 talents of silver and 1,000 horses and mules. He was subsequently murdered in 260 BC, whether at the instigation of King Antiochus II is not recorded. His son, Sames, continued to rule in Sophene.\n\nSamos or Sames was satrap of Commagene, Armenian king of Commagene and Sophene. War between the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom seems to have allowed Sames an opportunity for independence for his kingdom.\n\nWhat side he took in the Syrian Wars is unknown as most of the records of that era have been lost, though it is considered likely that he would have supported the Ptolemaic Kingdom against his large and powerful neighbour, the Seleucid Empire.\n\nMost sources give Orontes III as his father. After Orontes III died in 260 BC, there is no record for when Sames began his rule, only that his year of death is also 260 BC. This could be chronological error or it may be that Sames was meant to succeed Orontes III, but died in the same year. However it seems that Arsames I took control of Commagene, Sophene and Armenia after 260 BC.\n\nCommagene was outside the boundary of historic Armenia, yet the Armenian satraps remained in occupation of many regions of Anatolia, such as Cappadocia and Pontus. It may have been that the son and heir to the Armenian kingdom would rule another region, just as the son or heir to the Achaemenid Empire had always ruled an outlying region, such as Bactria or Hyrkania. Viewing it from this perspective it would make sense, as his father Orontes III was of the Orontid family.\n\nIt is suggested that Samos founded the city of Samosata, which has been submerged by the Ataturk Dam since 1989. Shamash was a Babylonian god, equivalent to Mithra; it was a dramatic break from a seemingly continuous tradition of satraps with Armenian and Persian names.\n\nThe neighbouring region of Osroene maintained a strong Aramaic culture that the Armenian and Persian occupiers never replaced. Although Sames had a very Babylonian (Aramaic) name, his name might have been “Mihrdat” which many of his successors had, but he replaced it with the Babylonian equivalent for cultural reasons on taking control of Commagene. He was succeeded by his son, Arsames I.\n\nArsames I seems to have taken control of Commagene, Sophene and Armenia in the year 260 BC after the death of his grandfather Orontes III, king of Armenia, and his father Sames, king of Commagene. Quite why they both died in the same year is not recorded, though it looks suspicious. It is known the Seleucid Empire was always trying to overthrow the Armenian dynasties who still ruled the lands their forebears had in the time of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nZiaelas of Bithynia found refuge at the court of king Arsames, and upon the death of king Nicomedes I of Bithynia Ziaelas returned to take the kingdom in 254 BC. Arsames also supported Antiochus Hierax against his brother, Seleucus II Callinicus, who was defeated at a battle against king Mithridates II of Pontus near Ankara in 239 BC, after which Seleucus lost control of any lands he had across the Taurus mountains. This was to the benefit of Arsames.\n\nArsames then founded the cities of Arsamosata in Sophene and Arsameia (known today as Eski Kale) in Commagene in 235 BC. After his death his eldest son Xerxes became king of Commagene, Sophene and Armenia. Orontes IV would succeed Xerxes whilst another son known as “Mithras” (or Mithrenes II) is recorded as being the High Priest of the temple to the Sun and Moon at Armavir.\n\nKingdom of Pontus\n\nThe region of Pontus was originally part of the Persian satrapy of Cappadocia (Katpatuka). The Persian dynasty which was to found this kingdom had, during the 4th century BCE, ruled the Greek city of Cius (or Kios) in Mysia, with its first known member being Mithridates of Cius.\n\nMithridates I Ctistes (r. 281–266 BC), also known as Mithridates III of Cius, was a Persian nobleman from Asia Minor and founder (this is the meaning of the word Ctistes, literally Builder) of the Kingdom of Pontus in Anatolia by declaring himself king. He is said to have been born in the mid-330s BC.\n\nIn 302 or 301 BC, shortly after having executed the young man’s father and predecessor Mithridates II of Cius, the diadoch Antigonus became suspicious of the son who had inherited the family dominion of Cius, and planned to kill the boy.\n\nMithridates, however, received from Demetrius Poliorketes timely notice of Antigonus’s intentions, and fled with a few followers to Paphlagonia, where he occupied a strong fortress, called Cimiata.\n\nHe was joined by numerous bodies of troops from different quarters and gradually extended his dominions in Pontus and created the foundations for the birth of a new kingdom, which may be judged to have risen about 281 BC when Mithridates assumed the title of basileus (king).\n\nIn the same year, we find him concluding an alliance with the town of Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia, to protect it against Seleucus. At a subsequent period, Mithridates is found acquiring support from the Gauls (who later settled in Asia Minor) in order to overthrow a force sent against him by Ptolemy, king of Egypt.\n\nThese are the recorded events of his reign, which lasted for thirty-six years. He was succeeded by his son Ariobarzanes. He seems to have been buried in a royal grave near the kingdom’s capital, Amasia. Next to him would be buried all the kings of Pontus until the fall of Sinope in 183 BC.\n\nAccording to Appian, he was eighth in descent from the first satrap of Pontus under Darius the Great and sixth in ascending order from Mithridates Eupator. However, this point is controversial since Plutarch writes that eight generations of kings of Pontus stemmed from him before Roman subjection.\n\nAriobarzanes II, son of Mithridates of Cius, became satrap of Phrygia. He became a strong ally of Athens and revolted against Artaxerxes, but was betrayed by his son Mithridates II of Cius. Mithridates II remained as ruler after Alexander’s conquests and was a vassal to Antigonus I Monophthalmus, who briefly ruled Asia Minor after the Partition of Triparadisus.\n\nMithridates was killed by Antigonus in 302 BCE under suspicion that he was working with his enemy Cassander. Antigonus planned to kill Mithridates’ son, also called Mithridates (later named Ktistes, ‘founder’) but Demetrius I warned him and he escaped to the east with six horsemen.\n\nMithridates first went to the city of Cimiata in Paphlagonia and later to Amasia in Cappadocia. He ruled from 302 to 266 BCE, fought against Seleucus I and, in 281 (or 280) BCE, declared himself king (basileus) of a state in northern Cappadocia and eastern Paphlagonia. He further expanded his kingdom to the river Sangrius in the west.\n\nHis son Ariobarzanes captured Amastris in 279, its first important Black sea port. Mithridates also allied with the newly arrived Galatians and defeated a force sent against him by Ptolemy I. Ptolemy had been expanding his territory in Asia Minor since the beginning of the First Syrian war against Antiochus in the mid-270s and was allied with Mithridates’ enemy, Heraclea Pontica.\n\nThe Kingdom of Pontus or Pontic Empire was a Hellenistic-era kingdom, centered in the historical region of Pontus and ruled by the Mithridatic dynasty of Persian origin, which may have been directly related to Darius the Great and the Achaemenid dynasty.\n\nThe kingdom was proclaimed by Mithridates I in 281 BCE and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63 BCE. The Kingdom of Pontus reached its largest extent under Mithridates VI the Great, who conquered Colchis, Cappadocia, Bithynia, the Greek colonies of the Tauric Chersonesos, and for a brief time the Roman province of Asia.\n\nAfter a long struggle with Rome in the Mithridatic Wars, Pontus was defeated. Part of it was incorporated into the Roman Republic as the province Bithynia et Pontus; the eastern half survived as a client kingdom.\n\nAs the greater part of the kingdom lay within the region of Cappadocia, which in early ages extended from the borders of Cilicia to the Euxine (Black Sea), the kingdom as a whole was at first called ‘Cappadocia by Pontus’ or ‘Cappadocia by the Euxine’, but afterwards simply ‘Pontus’, the name Cappadocia henceforth being used to refer to the southern half of the region previously included under that name. Culturally, the kingdom was Hellenized, with Greek the official language.\n\nAs the kingdom grew in strength, it included Lesser Armenia well. Lesser Armenia (Armenian: Pokr Hayk; Latin: Armenia Minor), also known as Armenia Minor and Armenia Inferior, comprised the Armenian–populated regions of the historic Armenia primarily lying west and northwest of the river Euphrates. It received its name to distinguish it from the the much larger eastern portion of historic Armenia – the Kingdom of Armenia, also known as Greater Armenia (or Armenia Major).\n\nKingdom of Pontus\n\nLesser Armenia\n\nMithridatic Dynasty of Cius\n\nAriobarzanes (Old Persian: Ariyabrdhna, Ariyaubrdhna) Ariobarzan or spelled as Ario Barzan or Aryo Barzan, perhaps signifying “exalting the Aryans” (death: crucified in c. 362 BCE), sometimes known as Ariobarzanes I of Cius, was a Persian Satrap of Phrygia and military commander, leader of an independence revolt, and the first known of the line of rulers of the Greek town of Cius from which were eventually to stem the kings of Pontus in the 3rd century BCE.\n\nAriobarzanes was apparently a cadet member of the Achaemenid dynasty, possibly son of Pharnabazus II, and part of the Pharnacid dynasty which had settled to hold Dascylium of Hellespont in the 470s BCE. Cius is located near Dascylium, and Cius seemingly was a share of family holdings for the branch of Ariobarzanes.\n\nPharnabazus, Satrap of Phrygia (fl. 413 – 373 BCE), son of Pharnaces of Phrygia, is indicated to have shared his rule and territories with his brothers in the late 5th century BCE when Pharnabazos had recently succeeded to the position. Mithradates, Satrap of Cappadocia, might have been one of such brothers. Ariobarzanes of Cius might have also been one of those brothers. The classical source Appianus relates that Ariobarzanes was of a cadet line of the family of the Persian Great King Dareios (Darius the Great).\n\nIt is highly probable he is the same Ariobarzanes who, around 407 BCE, was the Persian envoy to the Greek city-states and cultivated the friendship of Athens and Sparta. Ariobarzanes conducted the Athenian ambassadors, in 405 BCE, to his sea-town of Cius in Mysia, after they had been detained three years by order of Cyrus the Younger.\n\nAriobarzanes was mentioned as under-satrap in Anatolia in late 5th century BCE. He then apparently succeeded his presumed kinsman (possibly elder brother) Pharnabazus (fl. 413 – 373 BCE) as satrap of Phrygia and Lydia, assigned by Pharnabazos himself when he departed to the Persian court to marry Apama, daughter of the Persian king. Thus Ariobarzanes became the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, in what is now the northwest of Turkey. Pharnabazos lived well into the 370s BCE, having obtained higher positions in the Persian monarchy than merely the Phrygian satrapship.\n\nHe appears to have still held some high office in the Persian court in 368 BCE, as we find him, apparently on behalf of the king, sending an embassy led by Philiscus of Abydos to Greece in that year. Both Philiscus and Ariobarzanes, as well as three of his sons, were made citizens of Athens, a remarkable honor suggesting important services rendered to the city-state.\n\nAriobarzanes, who is called by Diodorus satrap of Phrygia, and by Nepos satrap of Lydia, Ionia, and Phrygia, revolted against Artaxerxes II in 362. Demosthenes speaks of Ariobarzanes and his three sons having been lately made Athenian citizens.\n\nHe mentions him again in the following year and says, that the Athenians had sent Timotheus to his assistance; but that when the Athenian general saw that Ariobarzanes was in open revolt against the king, he refused to assist him.\n\nWhen Pharnabazos’ other son, Artabazos II of Phrygia, wanted to regain the satrapy from his brother, Ariobarzanes refused. Ultimately, in about 366 BCE, Ariobarzanes joined an unsuccessful revolt of the satraps of western Anatolia against the Achamenian King Artaxerxes II (Revolt of the Satraps).\n\nSeveral other satraps sided with Ariobarzanes, including Mausolus of Caria (briefly), Orontes I of Armenia, Autophradates of Lydia and Datames of Cappadocia. The rebel satraps also received support from the pharaoh of Egypt, Teos, as well as from some of the Greek city states, with the Spartan king Agesilaus II coming to their assistance with a mercenary force.\n\nAriobarzanes withstood a siege at Adramyttium in 366 BC, from Mausolus of Caria and Autophradates of Lydia, until Agesilaus negotiated the besiegers’ retreat. Ariobarzanes was betrayed by his son Mithridates to his overlord, the Persian king, who had Ariobarzanes crucified.\n\nAriobarzanes’ one predecessor was a (kinsman) named Mithradates (possibly Mithradates, Satrap of Cappadocia). The archaeologist Walther Judeich claims that Ariobarzanes was that Mithradates’ son, but Brian C. McGing refutes that specific filiation. Seemingly, no classical source itself calls them son and father, the filiation being a later reconstruction on basis of successorship.\n\nMithridates, son of Ariobarzanes prince of Cius, is mentioned by Xenophon as having betrayed his father, and the same circumstance is alluded to by Aristotle. He may or may not be the same Mithradates who accompanied the younger Cyrus, or the same Mithradates mentioned by Xenophon as satrap of Cappadocia and Lycaonia in the late 5th century BCE.\n\nDuring the Satraps’ Revolt in the 360s BCE, Mithridates tricked Datames to believe in him, but in the end arranged Datames’ murder in 362 BCE. Similarly, Mithridates gave his own father Ariobarzanes of Phrygia to the hands of the Persian overlord, so Ariobarzanes was crucified in 362 BCE.\n\nDemosthenes speaks of Ariobarzanes and his three sons having been lately made Athenian citizens. – as signal of sympathy in the revolt effort, Athens made Ariobarzanes and three of his sons citizens of Athens. Mithradates was possibly one of those sons.\n\nIn 363 BCE already, Ariobarzanes II (possibly Mithridates’ son) made himself master of the family fiefdom of Cius in Mysia. This Mithradates may therefore have died in 363 BCE, but the date is not recorded and only comes from later reconstructions of the succession in the dynasty. Otherwise, this Mithradates may well be the same man as the elderly Mithridates II of Cius who held Cius in Mysia between 337 and 302 BCE, being said to be an old man at that time.\n\nMithridates of Cius (386–302 BC), a Persian noble, succeeded his kinsman or father Ariobarzanes II in 337 BC as ruler of the Greek town of Cius in Mysia (today part of Turkey). Diodorus assigns him a rule of thirty-five years, but it appears that his rule of Cius was interrupted during that period.\n\nWhat circumstances led to his expulsion or subjection are unknown; nothing is heard of him until his death in 302 BC. However, it appears that he had submitted to the Macedonian Antigonus, who, to prevent him from joining the league of Cassander and his confederates, arranged for his assassination in Cius.\n\nAccording to Lucian, he was at least eighty-four years of age at the time of his death, which makes it likely that he is the same person as the Mithridates, son of Ariobarzanes, who in his youth circumvented and put to death Datames. King Mithridates I of Pontus was his kinsman, although it is not known whether he was his son.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that he was the same Mithradates, son of Ariobarzanes prince of Cius, who is mentioned by Xenophon as having betrayed his father, and the same circumstance is alluded to by Aristotle.\n\nDuring the Satraps’ Revolt in the 360s BC, Mithridates tricked Datames into believing in him. But in the end he arranged for Datames’ murder in 362 BC. Similarly, Mithridates gave his own father Ariobarzanes of Phrygia over to his Persian overlord, so Ariobarzanes was crucified in 362 BC.\n\nPresumably he was not the same Mithridates who accompanied the younger Cyrus in c. 401 BC – there is no proof of this. Neither is he the Mithridates mentioned by Xenophon as satrap of Cappadocia and Lycaonia in the late 5th century BC. Between 362 and 337 BC the family fiefdom of Cius in Mysia was held by Ariobarzanes II (possibly Mithridates’ brother).\n\nCius\n\nCius (Greek: Kίος or Κῖος Kios), later renamed Prusias on the Sea (Latin: Prusias ad Mare) after king Prusias I of Bithynia, was an ancient Greek city bordering the Propontis (now known as the Sea of Marmara), in Bithynia and formerly in Mysia (in modern northwestern Turkey), and had a long history, being mentioned by Herodotus, Xenophon, Aristotle, Strabo and Apollonius Rhodius.\n\nMysia was a region in the northwest of ancient Asia Minor (Anatolia, Asian part of modern Turkey). It was located on the south coast of the Sea of Marmara. It was bounded by Bithynia on the east, Phrygia on the southeast, Lydia on the south, Aeolis on the southwest, Troad on the west and by the Propontis on the north. In ancient times it was inhabited by the Mysians, Phrygians, Aeolian Greeks and other groups.\n\nThe precise limits of Mysia are difficult to assign. The Phrygian frontier was fluctuating, while in the northwest the Troad was only sometimes included in Mysia. The northern portion was known as “Lesser Phrygia”, while the southern was called “Greater Phrygia” or “Pergamene Phrygia”.\n\nMysia was in later times also known as Hellespontine Phrygia or “Acquired Phrygia”, so named by the Attalids when they annexed the region to the Kingdom of Pergamon. Under Augustus, Mysia occupied the whole of the northwest corner of Asia Minor, between the Hellespont and the Propontis to the north, Bithynia and Phrygia to the east, Lydia to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west.\n\nThe chief physical features of Mysia are the two mountains—Mount Olympus at (7600 ft) in the north and Mount Temnus in the south, which for some distance separates Mysia from Lydia and is afterwards prolonged through Mysia to the neighbourhood of the Gulf of Adramyttium.\n\nIn the Iliad, Homer represents the Mysians as allies of Troy, with the Mysian forces led by Ennomus (a prophet) and Chromius, sons of Arsinous. Little is known about the Mysian language. Strabo noted that their language was, “in a way, a mixture of the Lydian and Phrygian languages”.\n\nAs such, the Mysian language could be a language of the Anatolian group. However, a passage in Athenaeus suggests that the Mysian language was akin to the barely attested Paeonian language of Paeonia, north of Macedon.\n\nPaeonian, sometimes spelled Paionian, is a poorly-attested, extinct language spoken by the ancient Paeonians until late antiquity. Paeonia once stretched north of Macedon, into Dardania, and in earlier times into southwestern Thrace.\n\nClassical sources usually considered the Paeonians distinct from Thracians or Illyrians, comprising their own ethnicity and language. Athenaeus seems to have connected the Paeonian tongue to the barely-attested Mysian language, possibly a member of the Anatolian family. On the other hand, the Paeonians were also regarded as being related to Thracians and ancestors of the Phrygians.\n\nModern linguists are uncertain on the classification of Paeonian, due to the extreme scarcity of surviving materials in the language. Wilhelm Tomaschek and Paul Kretschmer claim it belonged to the Illyrian family, while Dimitar Dechev claims affinities with Thracian.\n\nIrwin L. Merker considers Paeonian closely related to Greek, a Hellenic language with “a great deal of Illyrian and Thracian influence as a result of this proximity”. Irwin L. Merker considers Paeonian closely related to both Greek Hellenic and Illyrian languages with a gret deal of Thracian influence as a result of this proximity”.\n\nA short inscription that could be in Mysian and which dates from between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC was found in Üyücek village in the Tavşanlı district of Kütahya province, and seems to include Indo-European words. However, it is uncertain whether the inscription renders a text in the Mysian language or if it is simply a Phrygian dialect from the region of Mysia.\n\nCius was taken by the Persians, after the burning of Sardis, in 499 BCE. Hellespontine Phrygia or Lesser Phrygia was a Persian satrapy (province) in northwestern Anatolia, directly southeast of the Hellespont. Its capital was Dascylium, and for most of its existence it was ruled by the hereditary Persian Pharnacid dynasty. Together with Greater Phrygia, it made up the administrative provinces of the wider Phrygia region.\n\nCius later joined the Aetolian League, a confederation of tribal communities and cities in ancient Greece centered in Aetolia in central Greece established during the early Hellenistic era, in opposition to Macedon and the Achaean League, and was destroyed by Philip V of Macedon in the Second Macedonian War (200-197 BCE).\n\nCius was then given by him to Prusias I of Bithynia. Prusias, who had assisted Philip in ruining Cius, restored it under the name of Prusias. It was sometimes called Prusias “on the sea,” to distinguish it from other towns of the same name.\n\nThe Troada or Troad, or Troas, is the historical name of the Biga Peninsula (modern Turkish: Biga Yarımadası) in the northwestern part of Anatolia, Turkey. This region now is part of the Çanakkale province of Turkey.\n\nBounded by the Dardanelles to the northwest, by the Aegean Sea to the west and separated from the rest of Anatolia by the massif that forms Mount Ida, the Troad is drained by two main rivers, the Scamander (Karamenderes) and the Simois, which join at the area containing the ruins of Troy.\n\nMount Ida, called by Homer “many-fountain” (πολυπίδαξ), sourced several rivers, including Rhesos, Heptaporos, Caresus, Rhodios, Granicus (Granikos), Aesepus, Skamandros and Simoeis [Iliad 12.18 ff]; these rivers, were deified as a source of life by the Greeks, who depicted them on their coins as river-gods reclining by a stream and holding a reed.\n\nThe Troad gets its name from the Hittites’ name for the region, Taruiša. This identification was first put forth by Emil Forrer, but largely disputed by most Hittite experts until 1983 when Houwink ten Cate showed that two fragments were from the same original cuneiform tablet and in his discussion of the restored letter showed that Taruiša and Wiluša (Troy) were correctly placed in northwestern Anatolia.\n\nAccording to Trevor Bryce, Hittite texts indicate a number of Ahhiyawan raids on Wilusa during the 13th century BC, which may have resulted in the overthrow of king Walmu. Bryce also said that archeological surveys conducted by John Bintliff in the 1970s showed that a powerful kingdom that held sway over northwestern Anatolia was based at Wilusa (Troy).\n\nGreek settlements flourished in Troas during the Archaic and Classical ages, as evidenced by the number of Greek poleis that coined money in their own names. The region was part of the satrapy (province) of Hellespontine Phrygia of the Achaemenid Empire until its conquest by Alexander the Great.\n\nAfter this it fell to the Diadoch Seleucid Empire, and then passed to Rome’s ally, the kingdom of Pergamon. The Attalid kings of Pergamon (now Bergama) later ceded Mysia, including the territory of the Troad, to the Roman Republic, on the death of King Attalus III in 133 B.C.\n\nArtashes I\n\nWeakened by the Seleucid Empire which succeeded the Macedonian Empire, the last Orontid king, Orontes IV, was overthrown in 200/201 BC and the kingdom was taken over by a commander of the Seleucid Empire, Artashes I (r. 189-160 BC). Artashes I founded the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia, and is presumed to be related to the Orontid dynasty.\n\nIn the same manner of that of the monarchs of Pontus and Cappadocia, the Artaxiads stuck mainly to the royal traditions used by the former Achaemenid Empire. At the same time Greek influence was starting to advance in the country.\n\nAccording to the Greek geographer Strabo, Artaxias and Zariadres were Macedonian generals of the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great (r. 222 – 187 BC). He adds that after Antiochus III’s defeat by the Romans in 188 BC, the two generals established themselves a kingdom in Greater Armenia.\n\nHowever, this statement has been dismissed by the recent discovery of boundary stones with Aramaic engravings in Armenia, which mentions Artaxias’ proclamation of being “the son of Zareh (Zariadres)” and an “Eruandid (Orontid) king”.\n\nThe ending of -akān in the engravings, originally used in Old Persian, was extensively used in the Parthian ostraca from Nisa and in later Armenian texts. Anahit Perikhanian thus confirms that both Artaxias and Zariadres, “far from being Macedonians, belonged in fact to the earlier native dynasty, albeit probably to collateral branches, and that the Eruandids, or Artaxiad/Artašēsids as they came to be known, with their Iranian antecedents, continued to rule Armenia as before.”\n\nArtaxias and Zariadres united their armies to expand their dominions; the kingdom of Artaxias, originally centered around the middle of the Araxes river, expanded into Iberian land, and especially the territory of Media Atropatene, which lost its territories at the Caspian Sea and the districts of Syunik and Vaspurakan.\n\nMeanwhile, Zariadres conquered Acilisene and Taron. The conquered peoples of the territories likewise also spoke Armenian, however imperial Aramaic (with a largely strong amalgamation of Persian words) was still the language of the government and the court, a practice derived from the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nAccording to the 5th-century CE Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, Artaxias ordered the delimitation of villages and farmland, which has been confirmed by archaeological sites in Armenia. Artaxias used many epithets, one of them being the unidentified Persian word of ʾxšhsrt.\n\nArtaxias founded the city of Artaxata (Middle Persian: Artaxšas-šāt, “joy of arta”) on the left side of the Araxes river, which would serve as the capital and seat of the Armenian monarchy until the 2nd-century CE.\n\nIn 165/4 BC, Artaxias suffered a defeat to the forces of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes (r. 175 – 164 BC), who had him captured. Nevertheless, in 161/0 BC, Artaxias managed to help the satrap of Media, Timarchus, who rebelled against Seleucid rule. Artaxias died in 160 BC, and was succeeded by his son Artavasdes I.\n\nTigranes I\n\nTigranes I of Armenia was a King of Armenia at the end of 2nd and the beginning of 1st century BC. Few records have survived about his and his predecessor Artavasdes I’s reign, which has led to some confusion.\n\nSome modern scholars have doubted that such a king reigned at all. Contrary to them other researchers, such as Manandian, Lang and Adalian consider him a real figure but differ or are uncertain on the exact dates of his reign.\n\nAlthough it has been proposed that Tigranes I reigned from 123 BC to 96 BC, this view has been criticized. Another suggestion is that Tigranes I ruled in 120 BC – 95 BC and this has been recently corraborated by historian Christian Marek.\n\nThe name Tigránēs is the Greek form of Old Iranian Tigrāna (Armenian: Tigran). The exact etymology is disputed but it is likely an Old Iranian patronymic formation of the suffix *-āna- and the name *Tigrā- (meaning “slender”).\n\nCurrently, Tigranes I is assumed to be the successor and brother of Artavasdes I (who died without an heir) and the son of Artaxias I. Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi in his work mentions a Tiran, “son of Artaxias and brother of Artavasdes”, who has been identified as Tigranes I.\n\nManandian, citing Strabo, mentions that Tigranes I put a strong resistance against the Parthians and successfully defended Armenia. According to Khorenatsi, after the death of Artaxias I and against his wishes, the priests of the Vahuni family moved the gold-plated copper statue of Heracles from Armavir to their own temple-complex in Ashtishat located in Muş Province of eastern Turkey. Once Tigranes I assumed the throne, he stripped Vahunis of priesthood and converted Ashtishat into a royal domain.\n\nVahevuni was one of the ancient noble houses of Armenia, believed to derive from Vahagn, god (dic) of fire and war. According to Movses Khorenatsi, the Vahevunis were ranked in the Gahnamak among the first noble houses of Armenian by King Valarshak.\n\nThe princely house of Vahevunis traditionally held the title of the high priests (qrmapet) of Vahagn. They also possessed the temple town of Ashtishat in the gavarr of Vahevuniq (on the left bank of the Aratzani river in Taron. Most likely, in the pre-Christian Armenia, the Vahevunis also hereditarily held the rank of the Sparapet, i.e. the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armenian Army.\n\nAfter his death, Tigranes II, who was given as hostage to the Parthians by Artavasdes I, returned from his captivity in Parthia and assumed the throne. According to Appian, Tigranes II was the son Tigranes I. This view has also been supported by modern research. Barring the conflict with Parthians, the reign of Tigranes I has been described as generally peaceful and devoid of major external events.\n\nRoman–Persian Wars\n\nThe Roman–Persian Wars, also known as the Roman–Iranian Wars, were a series of conflicts between states of the Greco-Roman world and two successive Iranian empires: the Parthian and the Sasanian. Battles between the Parthian Empire and the Roman Republic began in 54 BC; wars began under the late Republic, and continued through the Roman (later Byzantine) and Sasanian empires.\n\nVarious vassal kingdoms and allied nomadic nations in the form of buffer states and proxies also played a role. The wars were ended by the Arab Muslim Conquests, which led to the fall of the Sasanian Empire and huge territorial losses for the Byzantine Empire, shortly after the end of the last war between them.\n\nAlthough warfare between the Romans and Persians continued over seven centuries, the frontier, aside from shifts in the north, remained largely stable. A game of tug of war ensued: towns, fortifications, and provinces were continually sacked, captured, destroyed, and traded.\n\nNeither side had the logistical strength or manpower to maintain such lengthy campaigns far from their borders, and thus neither could advance too far without risking stretching its frontiers too thin.\n\nBoth sides did make conquests beyond the border, but in time the balance was almost always restored. Although initially different in military tactics, the armies of both sides gradually adopted from each other and by the second half of the 6th century they were similar and evenly matched.\n\nThe expense of resources during the Roman–Persian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires. The prolonged and escalating warfare of the 6th and 7th centuries left them exhausted and vulnerable in the face of the sudden emergence and expansion of the Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the end of the last Roman–Persian war.\n\nBenefiting from their weakened condition, the Arab Muslim armies swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire, and deprived the Eastern Roman Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and the rest of North Africa. Over the following centuries, more of the Eastern Roman Empire came under Muslim rule.\n\nTigranes and Mithridates\n\nArmenia was disputed kingdom between Rome and Parthia during the Roman–Persian Wars from 66 BC to the 2nd century AD. Roman influence was first established with Pompey’s campaign of 66/65 BC, and again in 59 AD in the Roman–Parthian War campaign of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo; which resulted in the deposition of Tiridates I.\n\nTigranes II, more commonly known as Tigranes the Great (140 – 55 BC), was King of Armenia under whom the country became, for a short time, the strongest state to Rome’s east. He was a member of the Artaxiad Royal House.\n\nUnder his reign, the Armenian kingdom expanded beyond its traditional boundaries, allowing Tigranes to claim the title Great King, and involving Armenia in many battles against opponents such as the Parthian and Seleucid empires, and the Roman Republic.\n\nTigranes’ short-lived empire has been a source of pride for modern Armenian nationalists, his empire was a multi-ethnic one. The phrase “sea to sea Armenia” is a popular expression used by Armenians to refer to the kingdom of Tigranes which extended from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nTigranes is a typical example of the mixed culture of his period. Following the example of the Parthians, Tigranes adopted the title of Philhellene (“friend of the Greeks”). The layout of his capital Tigranocerta was a blend of Greek and Iranian architecture.\n\nHowever, like the majority of the inhabitants of Armenia, Tigranes was a follower of Zoroastrianism. On his crown, a star of divinity and two birds of prey are displayed, both Iranian aspects. The bird of prey was associated with the khvarenah, i.e. kingly glory. It was possibly also a symbol of the bird of the deity Verethragna.\n\nThe ceremonial of his court was of Achaemenid origin, and also incorporated Parthian aspects. He had Greek rhetoricians and philosophers in his court, possibly as a result of the influence of his queen, Cleopatra. Greek was also possibly spoken in the court.\n\nIn 67 BC Pompey was given the task of defeating Tigranes and Mithridates or Mithradates VI (135–63 BC), also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, the king of Pontus and Armenia Minor from about 120–63 BC.\n\nMithridates, the last king of the Kingdom of Pontus, was a prince of Persian and Greek ancestry. He claimed descent from Cyrus the Great, the family of Darius the Great, the Regent Antipater, the generals of Alexander the Great as well as the later kings Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Seleucus I Nicator.\n\nThe name Mithridates is the Greek attestation of the Persian name Mihrdāt, meaning “given by Mithra”, the name of the ancient Iranian sun god. The name itself is derived from Old Iranian Miθra-dāta-.\n\nMithridates, who has been called the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus, is remembered as one of the Roman Republic’s most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Sulla, Lucullus and Pompey.\n\nMithridates VI Eupator, ‘the Good Father’, followed a decisive anti-Roman agenda, extolling Greek and Iranian culture against ever-expanding Roman influence. Rome had recently created the province of Asia in Anatolia, and it had also rescinded the region of Phrygia Major from Pontus during the reign of Laodice.\n\nMithridates began his expansion by inheriting Lesser Armenia (Armenian: Pokr Hayk; Latin: Armenia Minor) , also known as Armenia Minor and Armenia Inferior, from King Antipater (precise date unknown, c.115–106) and by conquering the Kingdom of Colchis, an important region in Black Sea trade – rich with gold, wax, hemp, and honey.\n\nAfter inherited Lesser Armenia and conquered the Kingdom of Colchis, the cities of the Tauric Chersonesus now appealed to Mithridates for aid against the Scythians in the north. Mithridates sent 6,000 men under General Diophantus. After various campaigns in the north of the Crimea he controlled all of the Chersonesus. Mithridates also developed trade links with cities on the western Black Sea coast.\n\nIn Pliny the Elder’s account of famous polyglots, Mithridates could speak the languages of all the 22 nations he governed, something that has led to the use of his name as a title in some later works on comparative linguistics, such as Conrad Gessner’s Mithridates de differentis linguis, an account of about 130 then-known languages, and an edition (1556) of the works of the 3rd-century Roman miscellaneous writer Claudius Aelian.\n\nThe German grammarian and philologist Johann Christoph Adelung (1732-1806) issued Mithridates, oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde (1806). The hint of this work appears to have been taken from a publication with a similar title, published by Konrad von Gesner in 1555, but the plan of Adelung was much more extensive.\n\nWhere his ancestors pursued philhellenism as a means of attaining respectability and prestige among the Hellenistic kingdoms, Mithridates VI made use of Hellenism as a political tool. Both Greeks, Romans and Asians were welcome at his court.\n\nAs protector of Greek cities on the Black Sea and in Asia against barbarism, Mithridates VI logically became protector of Greece and Greek culture, and used this stance in his clashes with Rome.\n\nCertainly influenced by Alexander the Great, Mithridates VI extended his propaganda from “defender” of Greece to the “great liberator” of the Greek world as war with the Roman Republic became inevitable. The Romans were easily translated into “barbarians”, in the same sense as the Persian Empire during the war with Persia in the first half of the 5th century BC and during Alexander’s campaign.\n\nHow many Greeks genuinely bought into this claim will never be known. It served its purpose; at least partially because of it, Mithridates VI was able to fight the First War with Rome on Greek soil, and maintain the allegiance of Greece.\n\nHis campaign for the allegiance of the Greeks was aided in no small part by his enemy Sulla, who allowed his troops to sack the city of Delphi and plunder many of the city’s most famous treasures to help finance his military expenses.\n\nMithridates entertained ambitions of making his state the dominant power in the Black Sea and Anatolia. He first subjugated Colchis, a region east of the Black Sea, and prior to 164 BC, an independent kingdom. He then clashed for supremacy on the Pontic steppe with the Scythian King Palacus.\n\nThe most important centres of Crimea, Tauric Chersonesus and the Bosporan Kingdom readily surrendered their independence in return for Mithridates’ promises to protect them against the Scythians, their ancient enemies.\n\nAfter several abortive attempts to invade the Crimea, the Scythians and the allied Rhoxolanoi suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general Diophantus and accepted Mithridates as their overlord.\n\nThe young king then turned his attention to Anatolia, where Roman power was on the rise. He contrived to partition Paphlagonia and Galatia with King Nicomedes III of Bithynia. It was probably on the occasion of the Paphlagonian invasion of 108 BC that Mithridates adopted the Bithynian era for use on his coins in honour of the alliance. This calendar era began with the first Bithynian king Zipoites I in 297 BC. It was certainly in use in Pontus by 96 BC at the latest.\n\nYet it soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic alliance with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of Cappadocia, and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assistance of Rome.\n\nThe Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95–92 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other than to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war. By this time Mithradates had resolved to expel the Romans from Asia.\n\nThe next ruler of Bithynia, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, was a figurehead manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his Roman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the Social War, a civil war with its Italian allies.\n\nThus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were only two legions present in Macedonia. These legions combined with Nicomedes IV’s army to invade Mithridates’ kingdom of Pontus in 89 BC. Mithridates won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces.\n\nHis victorious forces were welcomed throughout Anatolia. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and Italian settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the Roman presence in the region. 80,000 people are said to have perished in this massacre. The episode is known as the Asiatic Vespers.\n\nThe Kingdom of Pontus comprised a mixed population in its Ionian Greek and Anatolian cities. The royal family moved the capital from Amasya to the Greek city of Sinope. Its rulers tried to fully assimilate the potential of their subjects by showing a Greek face to the Greek world and an Iranian/Anatolian face to the Eastern world.\n\nWhenever the gap between the rulers and their Anatolian subjects became greater, they would put emphasis on their Persian origins. In this manner, the royal propaganda claimed heritage both from Persian and Greek rulers, including Cyrus the Great, Darius I of Persia, Alexander the Great and Seleucus I Nicator.\n\nMithridates too posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to further his political ambitions; it is no proof that he felt a mission to promote its extension within his domains. Whatever his true intentions, the Greek cities (including Athens) defected to the side of Mithridates and welcomed his armies in mainland Greece, while his fleet besieged the Romans at Rhodes.\n\nNeighboring King of Armenia Tigranes the Great established an alliance with Mithridates and married one of Mithridates’ daughters, Cleopatra of Pontus. They would support each other in the coming conflict with Rome. They would support each other in the coming conflict with Rome. The Romans responded by organising a large invasion force to defeat him and remove him from power.\n\nThe Romans responded by organising a large invasion force to defeat him and remove him from power. The First Mithridatic War, fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw Lucius Cornelius Sulla force Mithridates VI out of Greece proper. After victory in several battles, Sulla received news of trouble back in Rome posed by his enemy Gaius Marius and hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates.\n\nIn this conflict, a war challenging Rome’s expanding Empire and rule over the Greek world, the Kingdom of Pontus and many Greek cities rebelling against Rome were led by Mithridates VI of Pontus against the Roman Republic and the Kingdom of Bithynia.\n\nThe war lasted five years and ended in a Roman victory which forced Mithridates to abandon all his conquests and return to Pontus. The conflict with Mithridates VI would continue in two further Mithridatic Wars.\n\nAs Sulla returned to Italy Lucius Licinius Murena was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to restore his forces. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates defeated Murena’s two green legions at the Battle of Halys in 82 BC before peace was again declared by treaty.\n\nWhen Rome attempted to annex Bithynia (bequested to Rome by its last king) nearly a decade later, Mithridates VI attacked with an even larger army, leading to the Third Mithridatic War from 73 BC to 63 BC. Lucullus was sent against Mithridates and the Romans routed the Pontic forces at the Battle of Cabira in 72 BC, driving Mithridates to exile into King Tigranes’ Armenia.\n\nIn 67 BC Pompey was given the task of defeating Mithridates and Tigranes. Pompey first concentrated on attacking Mithridates while distracting Tigranes by engineering a Parthian attack on Gordyene. Phraates III, the Parthian king, was soon persuaded to take things a little further than an annexation of Gordyene when a son of Tigranes (also named Tigranes) went to join the Parthians and persuaded Phraates to invade Armenia in an attempt to replace the elder Tigranes with the Tigranes the Younger.\n\nTigranes decided not to meet the invasion in the field but instead ensured that his capital, Artaxata, was well defended and withdrew to the hill country. Phraates soon realized that Artaxata would not fall without a protracted siege, the time for which he could not spare due to his fear of plots at home. Once Phraates left, Tigranes came back down from the hills and drove his son from Armenia. The son then fled to Pompey.\n\nIn 66 BC, Pompey advanced into Armenia with Tigranes the Younger, and Tigranes, now almost 75 years old, surrendered. Pompey allowed him to retain his kingdom shorn of his conquests as he planned to have Armenia as a buffer state and he took 6,000 talents/180 tonnes of silver. His unfaithful son was sent back to Rome as a prisoner.\n\nTigranes continued to rule Armenia as a formal ally of Rome until his death in 55/54, at age 85. He had four sons and three daughters. One daughter of Tigranes according to Cassius Dio married Mithridates I of Atropatene. Another daughter married Parthian prince Pacorus, son of Orodes II. Parchments of Avroman also mention his third daughter, Ariazate “Automa”, who married Gotarzes I of Parthia.\n\nThe eldest son, Zariadres, according to Appian and Valerius Maximus rebelled against Tigranes and was killed during a battle (possibly late 90s BCE). Appian also mentions an unnamed younger son who was executed for conspiring against Tigranes.\n\nHis third son, Tigranes the Younger, who showed great care for his injured father and was rewarded for his loyalty, has already been mentioned. He is also alleged to have led a military campaign in 82 BCE. Tigranes was succeeded by his fourth and youngest son, Artavasdes II.\n\nAlthough Cleopatra of Pontus is usually considered to be their mother (Appian writes that she gave birth to three sons)[40], historian Gagik Sargsyan considered only Artavasdes II and one of the unnamed daughters to be her children.\n\nAccording to him, the rest had a different mother and were born before Tigranes became king. The reasoning behind it is that if Tigranes the Younger did indeed lead a campaign in 82 BCE, then he and hence his two older brothers (and possibly two sisters) would be too old to be Cleopatra’s children.\n\nAnother argument supporting this claim would be the situation with Ariazate. As she was probably the mother of Orodes I (r. 80–75 BC), then Ariazate could not have been the daughter of Cleopatra who married Tigranes only in 94 BCE at the age of 15 or 16.\n\nSargsyan also proposed a possible candidate as Tigran’s first wife and the children’s mother: Artaxiad princess Zaruhi, a daughter of Tigran’s paternal uncle Zariadres and granddaughter of Artaxias I. He also considered likely that the reason for the rebellion of Tigranes’s son Zariadres was the birth of Artavasdes who was declared the heir by virtue of being born to a king and not a prince.\n\nWhile Lucullus was preoccupied fighting the Armenians, Mithridates surged back to retake his kingdom of Pontus by crushing four Roman legions under Valerius Triarius and killing 7,000 Roman soldiers at the Battle of Zela in 67 BC. He was routed by Pompey’s legions at the Battle of the Lycus in 66 BC.\n\nAfter Pompey defeated him in Pontus, Mithridates VI fled with a small army to Colchis (modern Georgia) and then over the Caucasus Mountains to Crimea in the winter of 66 BC in the hope that he could raise a new army and carry on the war through invading Italy by way of the Danube.\n\nHis preparations proved to be too harsh on the local nobles and populace, and they rebelled against his rule. His eldest living son, Machares, viceroy of Cimmerian Bosporus, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares killed, and took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom. He then ordered conscription and preparations for war.\n\nIn 63 BC, Pharnaces II of Pontus, one of his sons, led a rebellion against his father, joined by Roman exiles in the core of Mithridates’ Pontic army. Mithridates withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he committed suicide.\n\nHe reportedly attempted suicide by poison. This attempt failed because of his immunity to the poison. According to Appian’s Roman History, he then requested his Gallic bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword.\n\nAt the behest of Pompey, Mithridates’ body was later buried alongside his ancestors in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, the old capital of Pontus. Mount Mithridat in the central Kerch and the town of Yevpatoria in Crimea commemorate his name.\n\nMithridates VI had wives and mistresses, by whom he had several children. The names he gave his children are a representation of his Persian and Greek heritage and ancestry.\n\nIn 63 BC, when the Kingdom of Pontus was annexed by the Roman general Pompey, the remaining sisters, wives, mistresses, and children of Mithridates VI in Pontus were put to death. Plutarch, writing in his Lives, states that Mithridates’ sister and five of his children took part in Pompey’s triumphal procession on his return to Rome in 61 BC.\n\nAll of Armenia became a Roman province in AD 114 under Roman emperor Trajan, but Roman Armenia was soon after abandoned by the legions in 118 AD and became a vassal kingdom. Lesser Armenia, however, was generally incorporated by Trajan, together with Miletene and Cataonia into the province of Cappadocia.\n\nBetween Parthia and Rome\n\nArtavasdes II (Ancient Greek: Artabázēs) was king of Armenia from 55 BC to 34 BC. Artavasdes’ name is the Latin attestation of an Old Iranian name Ṛtavazdā, identical to the Avestan Ašavazdah, presumably meaning “powerful/persevering through truth”. It is attested in Greek as Artaouásdēs, Artabázēs, Artábazos, and Artáozos.\n\nA member of the Artaxiad Dynasty, he was the son and successor of Tigranes the Great (r. 95–55 BC). His mother was Cleopatra of Pontus, thus making his maternal grandfather the prominent Pontus king Mithridates VI Eupator. Like his father, Artavasdes continued using the title of King of Kings, as seen from his coins.\n\nIn c. 54, Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of the Roman triumvirs, who had become proconsul of Syria, had been preparing to invade the Parthian realm. Artavasdes II, who was an ally of Rome, advised Crassus to take a route through Armenia to avoid the desert and offered him reinforcements of a further 10,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry.\n\nHis reasoning was that the Parthian cavalry would be less potent in the Armenian highlands. Crassus refused the offer and decided to take the direct route through Mesopotamia.\n\nAs Crassus’ army marched to Carrhae (modern Harran, southeastern Turkey), the Parthian king Orodes II (r. 57–37 BC) invaded Armenia, cutting off support from Artavasdes II. Orodes II persuaded Artavasdes II to a marriage alliance between the crown prince Pacorus I (d. 38 BC) and Artavasdes II’s sister. Crassus was shortly defeated and killed by the forces led by Orodes II’s general Surena.\n\nWhile Orodes II and Artavasdes II were observing a play of The Bacchae of Euripides (c. 480–406 BC) at the Armenian court in honor of the wedding of Pacorus and Artavasdes II’s sister, the Parthian commander Silaces announced the news of the victory at Carrhae, and put the head of Crassus at Orodes II’s feet.\n\nThe head was given to the producer of the play, who decided to use Crassus’ actual severed head in place of the stage-prop head of Pentheus. The death of Pacorus I in 38 BC and succession of Orodes II’s other son Phraates IV (r. 37–2 BC) damaged the relations between Parthia and Armenia.\n\nIn 36 BC the Roman General Mark Antony started his Parthian campaign. He allied himself with several kings of the region, including Artavasdes, who again switched sides. According to Plutarch, of the allied kings Artavasedes was “the greatest of them all… who furnished six thousand horse and seven thousand foot” to Antony.\n\nArtavasdes II also persuaded Antony to attack his enemy Artavasedes of Atropatene. Nevertheless, once Antony left Armenia to invade Atropatene, Artavasdes II “despairing of the Roman cause” abandoned Antony.\n\nAlthough Artavasdes II gave refuge and supplied the defeated Romans, in 34 BC Antony planned a new invasion of Armenia to take revenge for the betrayal. First he sent his friend Quintus Dellius, who offered a betrothal of Antony’s six-year-old son Alexander Helios to a daughter of Artavasdes II, but the Armenian king hesitated.\n\nNow the triumvir marched into Roman western Armenia. He summoned Artavasdes II to Nicopolis, allegedly to prepare a new war against Parthia. Artavasdes II didn’t come, so the Roman general quickly marched to the Armenian capital Artaxata.\n\nThe Roman Triumvir Mark Antony arrested Artavasdes II with his family, in which they were taken as political prisoners to Alexandria, hoping with his hostage’s assistance to obtain great treasures in the Armenian castles.\n\nThe Armenian king and his family, who were bound with golden chains, had to follow Antony in his triumphal procession. The Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt awaited the triumvir on a golden throne, but Artavasdes II refused to render homage to the Egyptian Queen by Proskynesis.\n\nIn 31 BC, after Antony’s defeat at the Battle of Actium, Artavasdes was decapitated on the orders of Cleopatra VII. He had been an enemy of his namesake, King Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, an ally of Antony and Cleopatra VII. She sent his head to Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene to secure his help.\n\nPlutarch described Artavasdes II as a well-educated man, who had a great fondness for all things Greek and was an accomplished scholar who composed Greek tragedies and histories. From a wife whose name is unknown, he was survived by two sons: Artaxias II, also known as Artaxes II and Artashes, Tigranes III, and a daughter who possibly married King Archelaus of Cappadocia.\n\nIn 34 BC, Artaxias II (60s BC – 20 BC), the eldest son of Artavasdes II of Armenia by an unnamed mother, had managed to escape and fled to King Phraates IV of Parthia. With the support of Phraates IV, he invaded Armenia and placed himself on the throne. As a result, Artaxias II was pro-Parthian and anti-Roman. He was King of Armenia from 34 BC until 20 BC.\n\nArtaxias II was the namesake of his paternal ancestor, a previous ruling Armenian King Artaxias I. He was born and raised in Armenia. He ascended to the Armenian throne in 34 BC as he regained the throne lost by his father.\n\nWith the support of Phraates IV, Artaxias II was successful in a military campaign against Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, also known as Artavasdes I of Atropatene (before or about 59 BC-about 20 BC) , a former enemy of Artavasdes II.\n\nArtavasdes I of Media Atropatene was a Prince who served as a King of Media Atropatene. He is the namesake of his ancestor, Artabazanes a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene in the 3rd century BC, as the name Artavasdes is a variation of the name Artabazanes.\n\nHe was of Median and possibly of Armenian, Greek descent. He was the child born to Ariobarzanes I by an unnamed wife. His probable paternal uncle could have been Darius I. He was born and raised in the Kingdom of Media Atropatene.\n\nAccording to modern genealogies the father of Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was a son of a previous ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty.\n\nAnother possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.\n\nArtaxias II was said to be spiteful and vengeful. He massacred the remaining Roman garrison and slaughtered all the Roman traders in Armenia. A possible consequence of this action was that when Artaxias II sent emissaries in Rome to try to secure the release of his family, then in Roman captivity, the Roman emperor Augustus refused Artaxias II’s request.\n\nHis family, including Tigranes III (50s BC–8 BC), had been taken from Alexandria to live in Rome after Octavian (future Roman emperor Augustus) had invaded Egypt in which he annexed the country to the rule of the Roman Republic in 30 BC.\n\nIn Rome, Tigranes III, the namesake of his paternal grandfather, a previous ruling Armenian King Tigranes the Great, also known as Tigranes II, had lived in political exile, in which during that time he was educated there. In 20 BC after living in Rome for 10 years, Artaxias II proved to be an unpopular leader with his people.\n\nAs the Armenians lost faith in their ruling monarch, they sent messengers to Augustus requesting him to remove Artaxias II from his throne and to install Tigranes III as his successor. Augustus agreed to the request from the Armenians.\n\nAugustus sent his step-son Tiberius, with Tigranes III with a large army to depose Artaxias II. Before Tiberius and Tigranes III arrived in Armenia, a cabal within the palace was successful in murdering Artaxias II. The Romans installed Tigranes III as the new King of Armenia unopposed.\n\nTigranes III ruled as King of Armenia for 12 years. Although he reigned for a substantial period of time, little is known on his reign. His Armenian kingship brought peace, stability to Armenia in which peaceful relations between Rome and Armenia were maintained.\n\nTigranes III died before 6 BC. In 10 BC, the Armenians installed Tigranes IV as successor of Tigranes III. He was survived by two children from two different unnamed mothers: a son called Tigranes IV and a daughter, called Erato, who succeeded their father on the Armenian throne.\n\nTigranes IV and Erato\n\nTigranes IV (30s BC–1) was the son born to Tigranes III by an unnamed mother. His known sibling was his younger paternal half-sister Erato, also known as Queen Erato, who also was born to another unnamed woman.\n\nTigranes III died before 8 BC, and in 8 BC, the Armenians installed Tigranes IV as King as the successor to his father. In accordance with Oriental or Hellenistic custom Tigranes IV married Erato in order to preserve the purity of the Artaxiad Royal blood line. Erato became queen through marriage to her half-brother and his queen consort.\n\nErato was the second Seleucid Greek descendant to have ruled as an Armenian queen and an Armenian queen consort. The previous one was her paternal great-grandmother Cleopatra of Pontus, daughter of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his first wife, his sister Laodice. The first Seleucid Greek princess to have married a king of Armenia, thus becoming an Armenian queen and an Armenian queen consort, was her ancestor Antiochis, one of the sisters of King Antiochus III the Great.\n\nTigranes IV and Erato served as Roman client king and queen of Armenia from 10 BC until 2 BC. They were both born and raised either in Rome, where his father lived in political exile for 10 years from 30 BC until 20 BC, or during his father’s Kingship of Armenia, in which he ruled from 20 BC until 8 BC.\n\nAlthough Tigranes IV was the namesake of his father, the name Tigranes was the most common royal name in the Artaxiad Dynasty and was among the most ancient names of the Armenian Kings.\n\nErato is of ancient Greek origins and means “desired” or “lovely”. In Greek mythology, Erato was one of the Muses and the name derived from the same root as Eros the Greek God of love.\n\nFrom their sibling union at an unknown date, Erato bore Tigranes IV an unnamed daughter who later married King Pharasmanes I of Iberia, who ruled from 1 until 58, and by whom he had three sons: Mithridates I of Iberia, Rhadamistus and Amazaspus (Amazasp), who is known from a Greek inscription found in Rome.\n\nAlthough Tigranes IV and Erato were Roman Client Monarchs governing Armenia, they were both anti Roman and were not the choices of the Roman emperor Augustus for the Armenian throne.\n\nAs their dual rule did not have Roman approval and they leaned towards Parthia for support. Rome and Parthia competed with one another for their protégés to have influence and govern Armenia.\n\nRoman Historian of the 4th century, Sextus Rufus informs us that anti-Roman sentiment was building in Armenia during the reign of Tigranes IV and Erato. Rufus also emphasizes that the Kingdom of Armenia was very strong during this period.\n\nThe dispossessed and the discontent of the ruling Artaxiad monarchs and their subjects towards Ancient Rome had instigated war with the aid of King Phraates V of Parthia. To avoid a full-scale war with Rome, Phraates V soon ceased his support to the Armenian ruling Monarchs.\n\nThis lead Tigranes IV and Erato, acknowledging Roman suzerainty; sending their good wishes and submission to Rome. Augustus, receiving their submission to Rome and their good wishes, allowed them to remain in power.\n\nSometime about 1 AD Tigranes IV was killed in battle, perhaps ending an internal Armenian revolt of those who were infuriated by the royal couple becoming allies to Rome. Because of the war and the chaos that occurred afterwards, Erato abdicated her throne and ended her rule over Armenia.\n\nFollowing the murder of the previous ruling Armenian King the tyrannical Artaxias II by his courtiers and the situation surrounding Tigranes IV and Erato, the Armenians requested to the Roman emperor Augustus, a new Armenian King.\n\nAugustus found and appointed Ariobarzanes II of Media Atropatene (40 BC – 4 AD), also known as Ariobarzanes of Media; Ariobarzanes of Armenia; Ariobarzanes II; Ariobarzanes II of Media Atropatene and Ariobarzanes, as the new King in 2 BC.\n\nBetween 2 BC until 6, Armenia saw two Roman Client Kings: Ariobarzanes who ruled from 2 BC until 4 and his son, Artavasdes III who ruled from 4 until 6. Ariobarzanes II was a monarch of Median, Armenian and Greek descent. He was the first son and among the children born to the ruling monarchs Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene and his wife Athenais of Media Atropatene.\n\nHe was the namesake of his paternal grandfather Ariobarzanes I, a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene. He is also the namesake of his Pontian ancestors who governed with this name and of his mother’s maternal grandfather, uncle and cousin who ruled with this name as Kings of Cappadocia. He was born and raised in Media Atropatene.\n\nAriobarzanes, through his father, was a distant relative of the Artaxiad Dynasty as he was a descendant of an unnamed Artaxiad Princess. She was a sister of King Artavasdes II of Armenia and married Ariobarzanes’ paternal ancestor Mithridates, a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene.\n\nMithridates I had a son, Ariobarzanes I of Media Atropatene, who had a son, Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene. Artavasdes I had the son Ariobarzanes II, who served as King of Media Atropatene sometime from 28 BC to 20 BC until 4, and was appointed by Augustus to serve as a Roman Client King of Armenia Major from 2 AD until 4.\n\nAt an unknown date in the 20 BCs, Ariobarzanes II succeeded his relative Asinnalus as King of Media Atropatene and little is known on his reign. In Armenia, he served as a loyal Roman Client King to Augustus and was used as a key element in Augustus’ Asian Policy. He also served as King of Media Atropatene.\n\nAriobarzanes II accompanied Augustus’ grandson and adopted son Gaius Caesar to Armenia. When Gaius and Ariobarzanes II arrived in Armenia, the Armenians being fiery and proud, refused to acknowledge Ariobarzanes II as their new King, especially as he was a foreigner in their country. The Armenians revolted against Rome under the leadership of a local man named Addon.\n\nGaius with his Roman legions ended the revolt and reduced the city of Artagira. In Artagira, Gaius made Ariobarzanes II the new King of Armenia. Ariobarzanes II made Artagira, his capital city when he ruled Armenia and Media Atropatene together. The Armenians eventually came to respect Ariobarzanes II as their ruling King, because of his noble personality, spirit and his physical beauty.\n\nAriobarzanes II from an unnamed wife had two sons: Artavasdes II, who served as Artavasdes III, and Gaius Julius Ariobarzanes I, who may have had a son called Gaius Julius Ariobarzanes II. In 4, Ariobarzanes II died and was succeeded his son Artavasdes II (20 BC – 6 AD), also known as Artavasdes II of Atropatene, Artavasdes IV of Armenia and Artavasdes II of Media Atropatene and Armenia Major, in his Kingship of Media Atropatene and Armenia Major\n\nArtavasdes II was the namesake of his paternal grandfather, a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene and Sophene, Artavasdes I. He was born and raised in Media Atropatene. The father of Artavasdes, Ariobarzanes II died on June 26, 4 and Artavasdes succeeded his father as King of Media Atropatene and Armenia.\n\nLike his father, Artavasdes in his kingship of Media Atropatene and Armenia, based his rule at Artagira, which his late father made the city, their capital. As Artavasdes, was both King of Media Atropatene and Armenia, as King of Media Atropatene he is known as Artavasdes II and as King of Armenia, he is known as Artavasdes III.\n\nThe reign of Artavasdes didn’t last. As a ruling King, over the Atropatenians and Armenians, he proved to be an unpopular monarch. In the year 6, Artavasdes III who served as King of Armenia was murdered by his subjects. Artavasdes from an unnamed wife was survived by a son called Gaius Julius Artavasdes.\n\nAlthough archaeological evidence reveals and shows that Artavasdes is the son of Ariobarzanes II, there is some confusion, and there are different, various theories on the origins of Artavasdes.\n\nSome modern historical sources and reference books state that he is a son of Artavasdes II of Armenia. While others state he is either a brother or a paternal first cousin of Tigranes IV and Erato. In fact, Artavasdes through his father was a distant relative of Artavasdes II of Armenia, Tigranes IV and Erato.\n\nAs the Armenians grew weary of foreign Kings, Augustus revised his foreign policy and appointed the Herodian Prince Tigranes V (16 BC–36) as King of Armenia. In his Kingship of Media Atropatene, Artavasdes was succeeded by his paternal first cousin Artabanus and in the Kingship of Armenia the Roman emperor Augustus, appointed Tigranes.\n\nTigranes V, who served as a Roman Client King of Armenia from the years 6 to 12, was related to Artaxiad Dynasty as his late maternal grandmother was an Armenian Princess who may have been the daughter of Artavasdes II of Armenia and who possibly married King Archelaus of Cappadocia.\n\nTigranes V was accompanied by his maternal grandfather, Archelaus of Cappadocia and the future Roman emperor Tiberius to Armenia, where he was installed as King at Artaxata. Artaxata became his capital.\n\nTigranes was the first-born son of Alexander and Glaphyra. His younger brother was called Alexander and he also had a younger unnamed sister. His nephew Tigranes VI served as a Roman Client King of Armenia during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero (reigned 54-68).\n\nHis father Alexander was a Judean Prince of Jewish, Nabataean and Edomite descent and was a son of King of Judea Herod the Great and his wife Mariamne. His mother Glaphyra was a Cappadocian Princess, who was of Greek, Armenian and Persian descent. She was the daughter of the King Archelaus of Cappadocia and her mother was an unnamed Princess from Armenia, possibly a relation of the Artaxiad Dynasty.\n\nTigranes was named in honor of his mother’s Armenian and Hellenic lineage. The name Tigranes was the most common royal name in the Artaxiad Dynasty and was among the most ancient names of the Armenian Kings.\n\nRoman Emperor Augustus mentions Tigranes’ Armenian ancestry in his political testament: When he was murdered I sent into that kingdom Tigranes [Tigrans V, ca. A.D. 6], who was sprung from the royal family of the Armenians.\n\nTigranes was born and raised in Herod’s court in Jerusalem. After the death of Tigranes’ father in 7 BC Herod acted in an extreme and brutal manner by returning his mother to Cappadocia, forcing her to leave her children under the sole custody of Herod in Jerusalem.\n\nTigranes and his brother remained under Herod’s guardianship so he could be able to control their fates. Another son of Herod’s, Antipater, was concerned for Tigranes and his brother as he expected them to attain higher station than their own late fathers, because of the assistance Antipater considered likely from their maternal grandfather Archelaus.\n\nHerod died in 4 BC in Jericho. After the death of Herod, Tigranes and his brother decided to leave Jerusalem and to live with their mother and her family in the Cappadocian Royal Court. After Tigranes and his brother arrived in Cappadocia, they disowned their Jewish descent, deserted their Jewish religion and embraced their Greek descent, including the religion.\n\nHowever, the family connections with the Herodian Dynasty wasn’t wholly broken. After Tigranes and his brother disowned their Jewish descent, they were considered to be gentiles by fellow Jews. Archelaus had sent Tigranes to live and be educated in Rome.\n\nIn 6, Tigranes V ruled Armenia as a sole ruler. Sometime into his reign, the Armenian nobles being unsatisfied with his reign rebelled against him. The same Armenian nobles restored Erato back to the Armenian throne. From the years 6-12, Tigranes co-ruled with Erato. His co-rule with Erato is based on numismatic evidence.\n\nLittle is known about his reign of Armenia although some coinage has survived from his reign. The surviving coinage is a reflection from his Hellenic and Armenian descent and is evidence that he relinquished his Jewish connections. His royal title is in Greek ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΤΙΓΡΑΝΟΥ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ which means of great King Tigranes.\n\nErato wanting to cooperate with Rome, co-ruled with her distant paternal relative, Tigranes V. After abdicating her throne, leaving behind the war and chaos in Armenia, Erato had lived in political exile at an unknown location. Little is known of her during this period.\n\nAs a queen of Armenia, she may be viewed as one of the last hereditary rulers of her nation. Her co-rule with Tigranes V is known and based from numismatic evidence. Erato and Tigranes V co-ruled together in Artaxata. There is a possibility that Erato and Tigranes V may have married and she may have served as a Queen consort to Tigranes V.\n\nLittle is known on Erato and Tigranes V co-ruling Armenia together. Erato and Tigranes V were overthrown under unknown circumstances in 12. Augustus kept Armenia as a client kingdom and appointed Vonones I of Parthia as King of Armenia. The fate of Erato afterwards is unknown and Tigranes V may have remained living in Armenia.\n\nAfter his kingship, Tigranes may have remained in Armenia in contention to reclaim his throne in the first years of the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. Around about the year 18 Vonones I died. His maternal grandfather attempted to re-establish Tigranes as King of Armenia. Tigranes may have called upon Archelaus to assist him in regaining his throne and Archelaus may have been charged for treason in Rome for helping a relative who for unknown reasons wasn’t now in favor with the Romans.\n\nThe Armenian kingship was given to Artaxias III. If Tigranes was successful in regaining his throne and succeeding Archelaus, he would have presided directly or indirectly over a virtual empire. After the year 18, little is known about the life of Tigranes. His wife was the unnamed daughter of Pheroras, by whom he had no children.\n\nPheroras was his paternal great-uncle and a brother to Herod. Tacitus records that Tigranes as a victim of the reign of terror that marked the latter years of Tiberius. The charges brought against him by Tiberius in year 36 are not stated but it is clear that he did not survive them.\n\nArsacid dynasty\n\nThe Arsacid dynasty, or Arshakuni, ruled the Kingdom of Armenia from 12 to 428. The dynasty was a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia. Arsacid kings reigned intermittently throughout the chaotic years following the fall of the Artaxiad dynasty until 62 when Tiridates I secured Parthian Arsacid rule in Armenia.\n\nThe first appearance of an Arsacid on the Armenian throne came about in 12 when the Parthian King Vonones I, an Arsacid prince, who ruled as King of Kings of Parthian Empire from 8 to 12, and then subsequently as king of Armenia from 12 to 18, was exiled from Parthia due to his pro-Roman policies and Occidental manners.\n\nPhraates IV (r. 37–2 BC), was King of Kings of the Parthian Empire. He was the son and successor of Orodes II (r. 57–37 BC), a son of Phraates III, whom he murdered in 57 BC, assisted by his elder brother Mithridates IV. The two brothers quickly fell out and entered into a dynastic struggle, in which Orodes was triumphant.\n\nPhraates IV, given the throne after the death of his brother Pacorus I, soon murdered all his brothers, and also his father. His actions allienated the Armenians and also some of his nobles, including the distinguished Parthian nobleman Monaeses, who fled to the Roman triumvir Mark Antony, but shortly returned and reconciled with Phraates IV.\n\nPhraates IV was attacked in 36 BC by Mark Antony, who marched through Armenia into Media Atropatene, and was defeated and lost the greater part of his army. Antony, believing himself betrayed by Artavasdes II, king of Armenia, invaded his kingdom in 34 BC, took him prisoner, and concluded a treaty with Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, also known as Artavasdes I of Atropatene, the king of Media Atropatene.\n\nBut when the war with Octavian broke out, Antony could not maintain his conquests; Phraates IV recovered Media Atropatene and made Artaxias, the son of Artavasdes II, king of Armenia.\n\nArtavasdes I (c. 59 – 20 BC ) was a prince who served as a King of Media Atropatene. He was of Median and possibly of Armenian, Greek descent, and an enemy of King Artavasdes II of Armenia (r. 55 – 34 BC) and his son Artaxias II (34 – 20 BC).\n\nA member of the Artaxiad Dynasty, Artavasdes II was the son and successor of Tigranes the Great (r. 95–55 BC). His mother was Cleopatra of Pontus, thus making his maternal grandfather the prominent Pontus king Mithridates VI Eupator. Like his father, Artavasdes continued using the title of King of Kings.\n\nHe was born and raised in the Kingdom of Media Atropatene, and is the namesake of his ancestor, Artabazanes, a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene in the 3rd century BC. The name Artavasdes is a variation of the name Artabazanes.\n\nHe was the child born to Ariobarzanes I of Media Atropatene (r. 65 – 56 BC), a Prince who served as a King of Media Atropatene of Median and possibly of Armenian, Greek descent, and by an unnamed wife. Ariobarzanes I appeared to have died in 56 BC, as he was succeeded by his son Artavasdes I.\n\nAriobarzanes I and Darius I of Media Atropatene, also known as Darius I or Darius (ca. 85 BC – ca. 65 BC), a Parthian prince who served as a king of Media Atropatene in c. 65 BC, were related as they may have been brothers.\n\nLittle is known on the life of Ariobarzanes I. He appear to have succeeded Darius I as King of Media Atropatene in 65 BC. Although Ariobarzanes I ruled from 65 BC til 56 BC, his reign in the time-scale would appear to preclude the short reign of Darius I and shows that he came to the throne sometime before 59 BC.\n\nAccording to modern genealogies Ariobarzanes I was a son of a previous ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty.\n\nAnother possibility in linking Ariobarzanes I as a son born to Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Ariobarzanes is a name of Iranian origin. There were Persian Satraps who bore this name as did some of the ancestors of Cleopatra of Pontus. Cleopatra was a Pontian Princess, who was a daughter of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his first wife, his sister Laodice.\n\nAnother possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.\n\nAround the same time, Phraates IV’s throne was usurped by Tiridates II of Parthia, who was set up by the Parthians against Phraates IV in about 32 BC, but was expelled when Phraates returned with the help of the Scythians.\n\nTiridates fled to the Romans in Syria, where Augustus allowed him to stay, but refused to support him. He took one of Phraates IV’s sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20 BC, Phraates IV arranged for the release of his kidnapped son.\n\nIn return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53 BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as a small price to pay to regain the prince.\n\nAlong with the prince, Octavian (now known as Augustus) gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl named Musa, who quickly became queen and a favourite of Phraates IV, giving birth to Phraataces (Phraates V).\n\nSeeking to secure the throne for her son, Musa convinced Phraates IV to send his four first-born sons (Vonones, Phraates, Seraspandes and Rhodaspes) to Rome as hostages in 10/9 BC in order to prevent conflict over the succession. In 2 BC, Musa had Phraates IV poisoned and made herself along with Phraates V the co-rulers of the empire.\n\nPhraates V, also known by the diminutive version of his name, Phraataces (also spelled Phraatakes), was the King of Kings of the Parthian Empire from 2 BC to 4 AD. He was the younger son of Phraates IV and Musa, who ruled with him.\n\nUnder Phraates V, a war threatened to break out between the Parthian and Roman empires over the control of Armenia and Mesopotamia. Although Emperor Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD) had sent his adopted son Gaius Caesar to invade the Parthian Empire, in 1 AD the two sides agreed a peace treaty, by which once again Armenia was recognized as being in the Roman sphere.\n\nPhraates V was in return acknowledged as the rightful Parthian king, which was of high importance to him, due to his insecure position in the country. The Roman emperor Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his Res Gestae Divi Augusti.\n\nIn 4 AD, Phraates V and his mother fled to Rome after being expelled by the Parthian nobility, who crowned Orodes III (r. 4 to 6) as king of the Parthian Empire. Albeit he was an Arsacid, the lineage of Ordodes III is unknown.\n\nHe was raised to the throne by the nobility two years after the death of the previous co-rulers, Phraates V and Musa (r. 2 BC – 4 AD). Information regarding his brief reign is lacking. He was killed after a reign of two years.\n\nAfter the assassination of Orodes III in about 6 AD, the Parthians applied to Augustus for a new king from the house of Arsaces. Augustus sent them Vonones I, the eldest son of Phraates IV, but he could not maintain himself as king; he had been educated as a Roman, and was despised by the Parthian nobility as a Roman stooge.\n\nVonones I, who had originally resided in Rome, had been placed on the Parthian throne by a faction led by the Karin and Suren clans. His rule was supported by the Romans. However, the Parthian nobility was quickly alienated by Vonones I, who had become Romanized during his stay in Rome.\n\nThis increased Artabanus’ odds. After years of fighting Artabanus II defeated and expelled Vonones I, who fled to Armenia and became its king in year 12, while Artabanus became King of Kings of the Parthian Empire from 12 to 38/41.\n\nAccording to the classical Roman historian Tacitus, Vonones I was related to the Scythian king. Phraates IV had previously in his reign been aided by the Scythians to retake his throne from the usurper Tiridates in c. 30 BC, and thus Vonones I could possibly be the result of a marriage alliance between Phraates IV and a Scythian tribal chief, who agreed to help him in return.\n\nAnother member of the Arsacid house, Artabanus II, incorrectly known in older scholarship as Artabanus III, who ruled Media Atropatene, was then invited to the throne. He was the nephew and successor of Vonones I.\n\nArtabanus was not from the ruling branch of the Arsacid royal family; his father was a Dahae prince, who was most likely descended from the former Parthian monarch Mithridates II (r. 124–88 BC), whilst his mother was a daughter of the incumbent Parthian King of Kings Phraates IV.\n\nBorn between 30–25 BC, Artabanus was raised amongst the Dahae in Central Asia. When he reached adulthood, he became the ruler of Media Atropatene, which occurred sometime during the late reign of Phraates IV or during the reign of the latters son and successor Phraates V.\n\nThe factor behind Artabanus’ rise to kingship of Media Atropatene is unclear. Before his ascension, Parthian prince Pacorus of Media Atropatene, son of Vonones II, a Parthian prince who served as a King of Media Atropatene and briefly as King of the Parthian Empire, had ruled as king of Media Atropatene.\n\nVonones II was not from the ruling branch of the Arsacid royal family; his father was a Dahae prince, who was most likely descended from the former Arsacid monarch Mithridates II (r. 124–88 BC), whilst his mother was a daughter of the incumbent Arsacid King of Kings Phraates IV.\n\nVonones II’s brother was the Parthian King Artabanus II. Vonones II was the namesake of his maternal relative Vonones I (r. 8–12), as he was born and raised in the Parthian Empire. From about 11 until 51, Vonones II served as a King of Media Atropatene, a period about which little is known.\n\nAfter the death of his nephew Gotarzes II, Vonones II was raised to the Parthi"
