        "text": "President Serzh Sargsyan attended today the opening ceremony of the AGBU Vahe Karapetyan Center in Yerevan’s Kanaker-Zeytun Administrative District. The opening was conducted by the President of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU), Berge Setrakian, and the founder of the center, American-Armenian benefactor Vahe Karapetyan.\n\nThe building bearing the name the “AGBU Vahe Karapetyan Center” is located on 1 Zakaria Kanakertsi Street, Yerevan, and occupies an area of 5000 sq. m. It was donated to the union by Vahe Karapetyan. The center is expected to become an important link and bridge to fulfill the ABGU mission of developing and reinforcing motherland-diaspora ties, expand its presence and activities in Armenia, as well as to implement Armenia-centered programs contributing to the intensification of ties between diaspora and motherland-based youth. It will host various youth, cultural and educational programs, as well as workshops and meetings.\n\nThe center will also accommodate hundreds of diaspora young men and pupil groups from different countries participating in annual ABGU summer programs.\n\nThe president toured the center, familiarized himself with the working conditions, and with the center’s upcoming development programs. Serzh Sargsyan also visited the office of the Center for Coordination of Syrian Armenians’ Issues NGO which is based in the center’s first subsidiary building. The center supports the Syrian Armenians who ask for help.\n\nArmenia’s president was presented that the reconstruction design works of the center’s 3rd subsidiary building has already finished. This building will also host ABGU youth and cultural programs."
