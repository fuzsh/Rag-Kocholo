L. Chaumont, it existed earlier as an Armenian city.\n\nTri-Gavar — a south-eastern canton of Utik bordering the river Kur to the north-east.\n\nAfter the Caucasian Albanians were Christianized in the 4th century, parts of the population was assimilated by the Armenians (who dominated in the provinces of Artsakh and Utik that were earlier detached from the Kingdom of Armenia) and Georgians (in the north), while the eastern parts of Caucasian Albania were Islamized and absorbed by Iranian and subsequently Turkic peoples (modern Azerbaijanis).\n\nIt is worth noting that Strabo described Armenia (which then included also Artsakh and Utik) in the 2nd century BC as \"monolingual\", though this does not necessarily mean that its population consisted exclusively of ethnic Armenians.\n\nThe dynasty was founded when certain Mihran, a distant relative of Sasanian, settled in the region of Gardman in Utik.\n\nAfter the partition of Armenia between Byzantium and Persia (in 387 AD), Albania with Sassanid help was able to seize from Armenia the entire right bank of the river Kura up to the river Araxes, including Artsakh and Utik.\n\nAncient chronicles provide the names of several peoples that populated these districts, including the regions of Artsakh and Utik.\n\nThe marches of Artsakh and Utik were attached to the Kingdom of Armenia in Antiquity.\n\nAccording to the classical authors, the Udi inhabited the area of the eastern Caucasus along the coast of the Caspian Sea, in a territory extending to the Kura River in the north, as well as the ancient province of Utik.\n\nBased on the historical divisions of Ancient Armenia, the current territory of the province occupies parts of the Varazhnunik canton of Ayrarat province, the Dzorapor and Koghbapor cantons of Gugark province, and the Aghve and Tuchkatak (Tavush) cantons of Utik province.\n\nSt. Mesrop was very active in preaching the Gospel in Artsakh and Utik.\n\nThe religious center of the Albanian state also moved here. However, King Vache of Albania, a relative of Yazdegerd II, was forced to convert to Zoroastrianism, but soon thereafter converted back to Christianity. In the middle of the 5th century, by order of the Persian King Peroz I, King Vache built a city initially called Perozabad in Utik, and later called Partaw and Barda; he made it the capital of Albania.[73] Partaw was the seat of the Albanian kings and Persian marzban, and in 552 AD the seat of the Albanian Catholicos was also transferred to Partaw.[24][74]\n\nOverall, Mesrop Mashtots made three trips to Artsakh and Utik, ultimately reaching pagan territories at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus.\n\nAt the crossroads with the road to Mengeš, turn left toward Utik.\n\nIn the early 12th century, Armenian princes of the Zakarid noble family drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent Armenian principality in Northern and Eastern Armenia, known as Zakarid Armenia, which lasted under the patronage of the Georgian Kingdom. The noble family of Orbelians shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country, especially in Syunik and Vayots Dzor, while the Armenian family of Hasan-Jalalians controlled provinces of Artsakh and Utik as the Kingdom of Artsakh.\n\n\"One of the regions in this area was named \"\"Utik\"\".\"\n\nAdriadiesel d.d. - DHT Holdings buys BW Utik tanker and 11 other ships\n\nAuthors"
