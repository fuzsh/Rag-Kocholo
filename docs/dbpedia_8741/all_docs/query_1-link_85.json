        "text": "As early as 1889 I was interested in Armenian history, and I made a brief incursion into this interesting subject in a volume entitled Mission Scientifique au Caucase, fitudes archeologlques et historiques. Tome II. Recherches sur les origines des peuples du Caucase, But, as the title shows, this research was not restricted to the Armenians and the history of Armenia was only included in its main aspects, my attention being more particularly directed to the questions as to the origins of the Kartvelian peoples.\n\nEvidence of a long history is present throughout Armenia today, in monuments, artifacts, and books, as well as in people's minds. It is not surprising to find a village miller, who, while sharing a midday meal with a visitor, might describe the nation's boundaries under Tigran the Great in the 1st century BC. Or he might recount the events that took place on the morning of May 26, 451, at Avarair, when his ancestors fought a losing battle with the Persians - which was considered a victory, nonetheless, since the weakened Persians withdrew, allowing the Armenians to keep their new Christian faith. The Armenian reading of history often incorporates its own sense of justice and injustice in addition to facts, a dynamic that one needs to comprehend to understand modern Armenia.\n\nThe history of the Armenian communities of western Anatolia remains a largely unexplored subject in the field of Armenian Studies. Armenians first settled in these communities during the Roman and Byzantine periods and their numbers grew throughout the twelfth to sixteenth centuries as life in their homeland was plagued by turmoil and war. A great many left the plains and mountains of the Armenian Plateau for towns and cities whose histories dated back to antiquity, such as Konya, Bandırma, Eskişehir, and Sivrihisar, while at the same time building entirely new settlements, including Bardizag, Armash, and Adabazar. They established their own churches, schools and institutions which, in time, rose to prominence as centers of culture and learning and gave birth to such luminaries as the musicologist Komitas Vardapet. This chapter traces the founding of these communities, their social and cultural development in the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire, and their final and complete destruction during the 1915 genocide. By drawing from the memorial volumes of Armenian compatriotic societies and regional histories, ethnographic studies, archival documents, contemporary almanacs, travel accounts, and oral history interviews, this paper seeks both to introduce and enlighten our understanding of the life and death of these communities.\n\nOzet Bugun, Kafkasya’da her alanda degisim ve donusum yasanmaktadir. Guney Kafkasya, Orta Asya’nin on kapisi olmasi, enerji kaynaklari, boru hatlari, ulasim imkanlari, farkli etnik yapisi, catisma ve is birligi noktalariyla onemli ve stratejik bir konumda bulunmaktadir. Gecmisten gunumuze kadar gelen Kuzey ve Guney Kafkasya’daki sorunlar halen cozulebilmis degildir. XX. yuzyilin baslarinda Kafkas toplumlarinin tarihi seyrini belirleyen temel kavram milliyetciliktir. Bu sorunlardan birisi hic suphesiz bolgede kanayan bir yara olarak duran Ermeni meselesidir. Bu calismada, Ermenilerin, Azerbaycan Turklerine karsi yaptiklari katliamlar ve soykirimlar tarihsel perspektif icerisinde incelenmistir. Abstract State of Armenia, Process of its Creation: Struggle for Power in Southern Caucasus and Azerbaijan Today, in all areas of the Caucasus are experienced change and transformation. South Caucasia is in a strategic position due to the energy sources, oil rings, the transportation facilities, complicated ethnic structure, conflicts and cooperation and being a door of Central Asia. The problems which comes from the past up to the present in the North and the South Caucasus is still have not been solved. This is no doubt one of this problems in the region is the Armenian issue stands as a bleeding wound. In this research, Armenian massacres and genocides against Azerbaijani Turks have been investigated in their historical perspective."
