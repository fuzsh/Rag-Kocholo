Ani experienced renewed prosperity, expansion, and the patronage of new monuments based on the revival of trade routes in that period until the devastation wrought by the Mongols was visited on the region.  This church was commissioned by Tigran Honents, a wealthy Armenian merchant who provided it with crosses, lamps, gold and silver vessels and relics.  While it's as Armenian in appearance as any other church on-site, according to virtualani.org and Wikipedia it's believed to have been &quot;devoted to the Georgian Orthodox rite.&quot;  The interior contains extensive fresco cycles which are &quot;rare in Armenian architecture, and so it's believed that these were executed by Georgian artisans.&quot;   One of these depicts scenes from the life of Christ while the other is &quot;an unusual cycle&quot; of the events, trials and torments in the Life of St. Gregory the Illuminator (incl. the baptism of King Trdat and the kings of Georgia, Abkhazia, Caucasian Albania, et al.) which, according to Anthony Eastmond, &quot;is the most developed monumental narrative of a saint to survive from the Orthodox world up to this period.&quot;  Wow!  17 of 18 scenes depict events in the life of the saint.  The last, however, is devoted to St. Nino, the evangelist of Georgia, and &quot;depicts the miracle of the life-giving pillar&quot;, a key event in the establishment of Christianity in Georgia.   Further, &quot;all of the images in the church and their placement are consistent with Byzantinizing frescoes at that time in both style and layout.  The inscriptions identifying the scenes and figures are painted in Greek and Georgian, with Armenian reserved for the exterior dedicatory inscription.  Eastmond argues that “although the donor of the church was Armenian, it served a larger community comprised of both Armenians and Georgians.” <a href=\"https://dspace.nplg.gov.ge/bitstream/1234/152975/3/Georgian_Art_In_The_Context_Of_European_And_Asian_Cultures_2009.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">dspace.nplg.gov.ge/bitstream/1234/152975/3/Georgian_Art_I...</a>  So it could have been an ecumenical church, both Apostolic and Orthodox.  This interpretation is, again, controversial.  The cycle of St. Gregory is held out by the Armenian National Committee of America to be proof that the church was Armenian, as Gregory was the first patriarch and the founder of the Armenian Apostolic Church.  In this article, the said Committee calls out the Turkish 'Ministry of Culture and Tourism' for its apparent mischief in proclaiming the church to be Chalcedonic (Georgian) in the course of its stabilization, stirring the pot /b/ Armenia and Georgia.  <a href=\"https://anca.org/turkey-falsifies-historical-facts-around-tigran-honents-church-of-ani/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">anca.org/turkey-falsifies-historical-facts-around-tigran-...</a>        \n\t- These frescoes were the most extensive that I'd seen in any church that trip east of Istanbul. <a href=\"http://www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/stgregt8.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/stgregt8.jpg</a>  They include &quot;an unusual panel with motifs that evoke silk textile designs of that time.  Four linked medallions each enclose a 'simurgh', a mythical lion-[or dog?]-headed bird from Persian legend.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/stgregt11s.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/stgregt11s.jpg</a>  (I'll scan a photo.)\n\t- The plan of the church is of a type referred to as 'a domed hall', with one nave divided into 3 sections under a central dome.  Before its entrance are the ruins of a narthex and a small chapel from a later period in which fragmentary [Byzantinizing] frescoes survive, which you can see at the entrance in this photo.  The exterior of the church is impressively decorated with ornate stone carvings of real and imaginary animals in the spandrels /b/ blind arcades that cover all 4 sides of the church. \n\t- Vloggers tour this church from the 1:18 - 2:10 min. pt. in this video.: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ejhSDO6SYSc\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">youtu.be/ejhSDO6SYSc</a> \n\t\n\t- This church and all structures at Ani are constructed with the use of local volcanic basalt, a sort of tufa stone.  It's easily carved and comes in a variety of vibrant colors, from creamy yellow to rose-red to brown to charcoal.  This stone is used for the finely cut masonry cladding on the walls and vaults, with a mortared rubble core behind or within.    \n\t\n\tThe other constructions on-site that I toured (and which aren't in these 4 photos) include:\n\t\n\t- The huge City Walls:  The site of Ani is naturally well-defended on a triangular plateau protected on 2 sides by steep cliffs.  The only considerable stretch of flat, unbroken ground is along its northern edge.  While the whole city was encircled by walls, a line of massive double walls were constructed along its vulnerable north side by King Smbat (r. 977-989).  Prior to their construction, the city walls ran across the narrowest point of the site and enclosed an area not much larger than the citadel.  (Those had been built by King Ashot III when he transferred his capital from Kars to Ani in 961.)  The scattering of ruins that extends into the plain suggests that even these new walls didn't enclose an area large enough to contain the whole population.   \n\t- The walls are &quot;undoubtedly the most visually impressive part of Ani, and give a unique character to the ruins.&quot;  The line of double walls was built as a barrier to close the level ground between two ravines.  The outer wall is much lower and less well preserved than the inner, and is preceded by a dry moat.  The high inner wall is pierced by a series of large and closely set semicircular towers, often considerably taller than the wall itself.  These have 2 or sometimes 3 floors of accommodation within them.  \n\t- The walls are constructed of a rubble concrete core with a thin facing of finely cut and joined beige basalt.  Red or black stone was used at intervals to decorate them with patterns, crosses, heraldic or talismanic animals, symbols, etc.  Gates in the outer and inner walls are staggered.  Assailants forcing an outer gate would face a solid wall flanked by towers and would be confined to the narrow space between the walls, unable to manoeuvre well or to use a battering ram.\n\t- While the basic layout of the double walls dates from the 10th cent., they were substantially strengthened over the following centuries.  Walls were thickened by adding additional masonry facings.  In some spots 4 different faces are revealed, like the layers of an onion.  Within several towers earlier crenellations are ‘fossilized’ within later masonry, indicating that the towers originally rose to &lt; 1/2 their current height.  12th and 13th cent. Armenian inscriptions state that the construction of some of these towers was sponsored by private individuals.\n\t- There were 3 main gates in the double walls, the Checker-board (named after a panel of red and black stone squares over its entrance, dating from the 10th cent. with a renovation of the towers by the Shaddadids [r. 1164-'99]), Lion (likely the main entrance, named after a large relief of a lion set in the wall [which I don't recall] and protected by twin towers, the east remaining today) and Kars gates.  The towers on either side of the Kars gate are the largest and tallest remaining in the walls.  The rooms within them are complex and this fortified gate is almost a castle in itself.  An arch once stretched /b/ the towers and over the entrance, permitting defenders to fire directly down at assailants.  Beyond the Kars gate is a stretch of powerful and impressive ramparts.  The outer wall is almost as strong as the inner where it turns to the SE, and has a massive tower lavishly decorated with polychrome stonework (incl. a prominent cross sculpted in contrasting black stone).  My memory's fuzzy but I explored the length of these walls walking towards the SE and would've explored the towers.\n\t\n\t- The 'Church of the Holy Apostles' (Surp Arak'elots):  An important church appears to have been founded by the princely Pahlavuni dynasty and to have been used by the archbishops of Ani belonging to that dynasty.  ... The earliest inscription on its walls dates from 1031 and refers to a donation of land made by Abughamir Pahlavuni.  Its ground plan is of 'an inscribed quatrefoil with corner chambers' (ie. it has a 4-apsed interior within a rectangular plan, and had 4 rooms [chapels?] in the spaces within the corners, each under its own dome and drum [unique in Armenian architecture], with an apse and a 'fully articulated interior').  \n\t- This church was originally built in the midst of an open courtyard which filled with bldg.s over the centuries.  Only one, the south narthex, survives to any appreciable extent.  Otherwise, the courtyard was entirely paved with stone slabs incl. gravestones and khatchkars.  The complex included what appear to be 4 mausoleums, incl. a vaulted room beneath the street, and a chamber which once housed a large khatchkar dedicated to Catholicos Barsegh (1184).  The oldest structure on the site is a small church (possibly as old as the 7th cent.), and which had a single nave ending in a semicircular apse.  \n\t- The south narthex (likely early 13th cent.) has a richly carved eastern facade that survives largely intact and displays many Armenian inscriptions dating from 1215 to 1348.  Several are secular, e.g. decrees re reductions in taxes and trading levies, and suggest the bldg. was used for secular as well as religious purposes.  The bldg.'s design is strongly influenced by contemporary Seljuk and Iranian art, with an entrance in the form of a pishtaq - a portal in a niche in the form of an eivan, surrounded by a decorative frame and with a muqarnas vault at the top, all beneath porthole windows.  The rest of the facade comprises shallow, v-shaped niches alternating with vertical bands of decorative interlace carvings.\n\t- The dynamic interior is &quot;a tour-de-force&quot; of masonry.  A pair of diagonally-crossing arches support the ceiling (uniquely so in medieval Armenian bldg.s) and frame a lozenge shaped central compartment beneath a fine muqarnas dome.  (I'll scan a photo.)  The remaining compartments have flat ceilings richly decorated with patterns formed from inlaid red, brown, and black stone.   \n\t \n\t- 'The Georgian Church':  This was a large, rectangular structure with a double-pitched roof, no dome, and a single nave ending in a semicircular apse.  There was an arcade of 3 bays separated by engaged columns along the internal north and south walls.  Arches rising from those columns supported a barrel vaulted roof.  A long, semi-subterranean, barrel-vaulted room under the nave may have served as a crypt.  Only the north wall of the nave remains standing.  I probably missed bas-reliefs in 2 arcades depicting 'the Annunciation' (Luke 1:28) and 'the Visitation' (Luke 1:41).  (I photographed the ruins of the church with its lone, standing wall, but I don't know how well I toured them.)\n\t- There was an inscription in Georgian (1288) on part of the south wall.  Another 20-line-long inscription (1218) was discovered in 1910 on 44 facing blocks on the remains of the rest of that wall.  The fragments were re-assembled and displayed outside the Ani museum (the Minuchihr mosque).  They vanished after WW1 and 5 of the missing blocks were discovered built into the walls of houses in Ani (Ocakli) village in 1998.  That inscription recorded a pastoral sermon by Epiphane, the Catholicos of Georgia, to Georgians living in Ani.  At the end it was signed (in Armenian) by Grigor, the Armenian archbishop of Ani, and by the emir Vahram, the governor of Ani.  It announced the reduction of Church taxes, encouraged the faithful to be more generous, and warned Georgian priests against following heretical practices.\n\t- 'Georgian' didn't simply refer to an ethnic Georgian in that period.  'Georgian' was a denomination and &quot;would have designated all those in Ani who professed the Chalcedonian faith.  Although the Georgian church controlled this church, its congregation would have been primarily Armenian.&quot; (Virtual Ani)  The inscription dates the bldg. to the 13th cent. when Ani was under Georgian control.  \n\t- The ruins of 'the Georgian church' might've been the last I toured at Ani as I was called over by soldiers by the entrance gate before I could tour the ruins of King Gagik's Church and 'the Palace' nearby at the NW corner of the site.  (See below)\n\t\n\t\n\tI don't recall the following.:\n\t\n\t- The remains of the Citadel, the 'Inner fortress', on a level hill in the south of the site:  Encircled by a single line of ruined ramparts and with towers on its north side, its ramparts are presumed to date in part from the 7th cent. reign of the Kamsarakan dynasty, with periodic renovations and improvements until the 13th.  This was the site of the elaborate palace and the private churches and chapels (at least 5) of Ani's Bagratid rulers, their successors, and possibly their predecessors the Kamsarakans too.  The palace had been added to and reconstructed many times before it was finally abandoned, likely by the end of the 15th cent., and later looted for its masonry.  Much of it had been destroyed by fire at one time.  Divided by a 59 m. corridor, the northern 1/2 of the complex includes a small bath-house (with plumbing and some hypocaust) and 3 elevated 'ceremonial halls'.  One, 'the NW hall', was 20 x 10 m.s2 with windows overlooking the city, but the 'East' or 'Basilica hall' (it took the form of a basilica) was the jewel in its day, with 2 rows of painted wooden columns that supported sculpted wooden arches, and with &quot;a frieze, painted onto wood and framed by plaster rosettes gilded in gold, [that] ran above the arcade and depicted persons of nobility.&quot;  The wooden ceiling was sculpted and frescoed, and &quot;frescoes on the walls depicted flower gardens and groups of horsemen.&quot;  Nikolai Marr, the archaeologist who excavated the site in 1908-'09, later wrote the following: &quot;... the artefacts collected were sufficient to confirm that the zeal of the builders had been concentrated on decorating this [East] hall in an exceptional manner.  The tales in old Armenian accounts of the gold covered rooms in the royal palace of Ani had seemed to us to be only legendary exaggerations.  Remains found in the underground level of the basilica hall [that had fallen down from the upper East Hall] allow us to establish that it was not a legend, but the literal truth&quot;. !\n\t- The southern 1/2 of the palace includes a spacious hall above a large cistern and divided from a raised annex by a wooden, painted partition screen.  \n\t- 3 of the ruined churches in the citadel are written up in some detail in the entries at 'Virtual Ani' in the following links.:  The Palace Church (at the east end of the Palace, and which appears to date from the 7th cent. (!), so built by the Kamsarakan):  <a href=\"http://www.virtualani.org/citadel/palacechurch.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.virtualani.org/citadel/palacechurch.htm</a> ; the Hexagonal Church (built by Prince Abu'khanm in 1026, notably with slightly pointed arches in the 6 apses in the interior): <a href=\"http://www.virtualani.org/citadel/hexagonalchurch.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.virtualani.org/citadel/hexagonalchurch.htm</a> ; and the so-called 'Mausoleum of the Child Princes' (@ 1050-'75; again the arches in its vaults are slightly pointed) <a href=\"http://www.virtualani.org/citadel/childprinceschurch.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.virtualani.org/citadel/childprinceschurch.htm</a> .\n\t\n\t- A Zoroastrian fire temple.  (There's a good chance I saw the remains of this bldg. but didn't know what it was.)  It's believed to date from the Arsacid period (1st-4th cent. A.D.) and to be the oldest structure at Ani.  It might also have been an early Christian monument: an open-air martyrion from the 4th or 5th cent. (the only known open-air non-subterranean martyrion in Armenia if so).  A Byzantine coin from the reign of Justin I (518-527 A.D.) was found in or near this bldg., possibly the only known coin from that period found at Ani.  The remains of the 'fire-temple' consist in 4 squat, round columns, 1.3 m.s in diameter, beneath plain capitals and on cylindrical bases set 1.8 m.s apart in the form of a square (with an altar likely at the centre), and made from a gritty, black basalt (only used at Ani in these columns and in the tower by the gate of the citadel, likely recycled from this temple complex).  The large size of the columns suggests a stone roof.  At an unknown date the structure was converted into a chapel (apparently a private chapel) with the construction of 4 exedera /b/ the columns, little of which have survived.\n\t- &quot;The existence in Armenia of Zoroastrian temple structures in the form of a domed square on 4 pillars may have encouraged the evolution of the centrally planned, domed church so typical of Christian Armenian architecture.&quot; (Virtual Ani)\n\t\n\tThe Kizkale, which I almost toured:\n\t&quot;At the southern end of Ani, south of the citadel hill, the site narrows into a dramatic promontory almost encircled by the Arpa/Akhurian river and protected by near vertical cliffs.  Its flat top was once a separate fortified enclosure.  Known as Kizkale, &quot;Maiden's Castle&quot; in Turkish and Kuysiamrots (Virgin's Castle) or Kusanats (Virgins' Castle) in Armenian, a pagan temple dedicated to the goddess Anahit stood here before 300 A.D. which was then destroyed by St. Gregory the Illuminator who then erected a church on the site, according to tradition.  The site's never been excavated.\n\t- The Kizkale church:  An inscription:  &quot;In the time of the [Georgian] queen of queens T'amar, annointed by God and pious, I, shahanshah Zak'aria amirspasalar, her faithful servant, son of the great Sargis Mkhargrtzeli, by the will of God erected this monument ... in this monastery, close to the church built by our Illuminator, Saint Grigor.&quot;  The ruined church ('Surp Astvadzadzin', the 'Church of the Holy Mother of God' according to the historian Alishan writing in 1881) stands at the very edge of the cliff.  The Zak'aria of the inscription was the Georgian-appointed governor of Ani from 1198 to '99.  The church was rectangular in its form with twin V-shaped niches in each facade and a dome, and cruciform in the interior.  There were small chapels on 2 levels in each corner.  Parts of the bldg. incorporate repurposed material, perhaps from an earlier church.  The dome and the SW section collapsed long ago and an earthquake destroyed the SE corner in 1988.   \n\t- &quot;The panoramic vista from here back over the city is extremely impressive, as are the views along the river that forms the Turkish-Armenian border.&quot;  \n\t- The foundations of houses are better preserved here than in the rest of the city (Virtual Ani).  According to Wikipedia, Ani wasn't entirely abandoned until 1735 when the last monks left the monastery in the Kizkale. \n\t- I knew I wasn't supposed to climb up to this site, but forget how I knew.  Virtual Ani writes that &quot;the peninsula lies outside the wire-mesh fence that surrounds most of Ani.&quot;  Maybe there'd been a sign.  I hiked over towards it and tried climbing up to it anyway, but a cliff on its north side on the final approach was a little too steep and crumbly.  I tried it from a few angles but gave up.  I was a little self-conscious too as I thought the soldiers at the gate might be watching.  Sure enough, when I retrieved my passport from them as I was leaving, one made a point to tell me that they'd watched my efforts to reach the Kizkale with their binoculars.  I didn't get a scolding, but I was leaving.  According to Virtual Ani &quot;the summit can be reached by either of 2 difficult paths that wind their way around each side of the promontory.  The one along the side overlooking the Akhurian was probably the original approach as it's guarded by the ruins of a gateway.&quot;  Again, I tried to tackle it head-on and don't recall any paths @ the side.  You can clearly see one in the video in the next link at the 4:09 min. pt. in shadow on the left or north side of the promontory.  I scrambled up the steep, sunlit slope to the cliff you can see at the top.  If I'd seen and followed the path at the side below one cliff and high above another, or cut into the cliff, I would've passed the Kizkale from below, walked to the end of the promontory facing Armenia, and doubled back by climbing up to the church.  What a miss.   \n\t- Vloggers approach the Kizkale on 'the proper path' or one of 2 (the one on the sunlit side, not seen at the 4:09 pt.) and tour it from the 4 min. pt. in this vlog.: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dW7lSq474cM\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">youtu.be/dW7lSq474cM</a> \n\t     \n\t\n\tStructures I missed.:\n\t- I spent most of a full day at Ani, but it's spread out and there's much that I missed.  I don't recall, didn't photograph, and likely missed 2 bldg.s at the far NW corner of the site, the Church of King Gagik and a Selcuk palace.\n\t\n\t- King Gagik's church:  The ruins of this church was an important miss that I walked past at a distance of only @ 200 m.s.     \n\t- Stephanos Asoghik of Taron: &quot;It was at that time, at the end of the 1000th year of Our Lord's incarnation, at the time of the Emperor Basil, that Gagik, King of Armenia, was taken with the idea of building in the city of Ani a church similar in size and plan to the great church at Vagharshapat, dedicated to St. Gregory, which was then in ruins [Zvart'nots].&quot;\n\t- King Gagik (r 990 - 1020) is said to have hired the architect Trdat (he who designed the cathedral of Ani) to build his 'Millennium' church, erected /b/ 1001 and 1005 (although some sources claim /b/ 990 and 1000).  \n\t- The grandiose cathedral of Zvart'nots (the 'Vigilant Angels') erected /b/ 642 and 662, destroyed in the 10th cent. in an earthquake and the inspiration for this church, was the most acclaimed monument of early medieval Armenia.  It was built on the alleged site of the meeting /b/ King Trdat of Armenia and St. Gregory the Illuminator as recounted by the Armenian historian Agathangelos in the 4th cent., and was built to house the remains of the saint according to tradition.  The patron of Zvart'nots was the Armenian Catholicos Nerses III (i.e.  'the Builder').  He was pro-Byzantine and his cathedral united Byzantine and Armenian architectural forms, resulting in a strikingly elegant, complex, and boldly innovative design, a circular ambulatory wrapped around an inscribed quatrefoil interior (4 open apses within a round outer wall) that closely resembles the size and ground-plan of the Zvart'nots original and of the famous church at Bana the ruins of which I toured en route to Kars.\n\t- &quot;The structure was never very stable.  It was consolidated in 1013 with the addition of extra masonry @ the 2 central columns of each apse [composite 'Armeo-Ionic' cushion capitals], converting them into piers, but this was unsuccessful and the church collapsed shortly afterwards.  Houses were built @ and over the ruins in the 13th cent. with some of the fallen masonry.  Excavations in 1906 revealed many objects of worship, incl. a bronze candlestick and a chandelier.  Only foundations survive and so the appearance of the bldg. is uncertain (like that at Zvart'nots).  A [larger than life-sized] statue of King Gagik holding a model of the church was found in the dig, but the upper portion of the model was missing.  Both King Gagik’s church at Ani and the Zvart'nots church [and that at Bana] resembled tall, 3-stepped rotundas.  Their quatrefoil interior space rose up through 3 stories and was topped with a high dome on a drum.  (It's unknown whether the exterior of the 2nd level was circular or quatrefoil [circular is less structurally sound]).&quot;  \n\t\n\t- 'The Merchant's palace':  The surviving 2-storey structure may have been the late 12th or 13th cent. residence of a wealthy merchant or prince or bishop, or a military structure, perhaps a barracks, the walls of which connect to the outer defenses of the city.  There are no surviving inscriptions.  A basement at the back is a labyrinth of rooms and narrow corridors, likely intended for storage.\n\t- &quot;The imposing, sumptuously decorated gateway in the eastern facade is the most remarkable aspect of the bldg.&quot;  It includes a richly inlaid panel with 8-pointed stars alternating with crosses, both incised with intricate decorations (and very photogenic), and an inlay of hexagonal polychrome stone in the tympanum.  But most of these stone inlays have vanished. \n\t- It's a shame I missed it in 2000 as the ensuing Turkish 'restoration' has been unkind.  The author of 'Virtual Ani' doesn't mince words on that point.: \n\t&quot;The southern walls of the palace had fallen by the end of the 19th cent., revealing the vaults of the basement.  In the early 1990s these were partly rebuilt in a poorly executed 'restoration' that destroyed much of the original fabric and used stone that was entirely different in size, colour and quality from the original.  However bad that work was, it was as nothing compared to the hideous 'restoration' which began in 1999.  Following faithfully in the tradition of Turkish restorations at Ani and elsewhere, there is now far more new masonry in the Palace than original masonry!  The new stonework does not match the old in colour nor finish, and there's no archaeological evidence which indicates that the rebuilt walls originally looked like this.  [The reconstruction of the entrance gateway in 2000] involved the removal of all the remaining star and cross inlays and their replacement with crude, undecorated copies.  See 'The Rape of Ani' for a more detailed account of the destruction.  [ <a href=\"http://www.virtualani.org/history/restorations.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.virtualani.org/history/restorations.htm</a> ]  All this work goes entirely against the established techniques of modern archaeological conservation practiced elsewhere in the world.&quot;\n\t- Re the 'restoration' of the medieval walls, organized and funded by the Turkish Min. of Culture.:  &quot;Restoration in Turkey often simply involves destruction followed by a crude reconstruction - many historic monuments have been irreparably ruined by such 'restorations'. ... Local contractors and politicians (often the same people) were making a great deal of money from the 'restorations'.  In 1999 the process of destruction was resumed on a grander scale and the workers now had an on-site stone-cutting factory.  The walls of this factory were built entirely from stone looted from the ruins! ... [This] went against every established practice of modern archaeological conservation. ... Local opposition to the restorations is minimal, confined primarily to the few people in Kars who make a living from tourism. ... In Turkey, to criticize the powerful is a dangerous thing to do - it's too much to expect for some old bldg.s that aren't even Turkish. ...&quot; (Virtual Ani)\n\t\n\t- the 'Horomos Monastery' aka Ghoshavank:  The following write-up is the longest I think I've written in this stream about a site or sight that I didn't tour (so far); it's just an edit really of 3 pages of content from Virtual Ani.  (I should edit it down further, but as the saying goes &quot;I don't have time to be brief.&quot;)  On seeing photos of it and reading about it online with an Armenian friend of mine after returning home, I now consider it to be the most interesting, significant, and photogenic complex of ancient or medieval Armenian bldg.s in Turkey.  I wish I'd known about it and had tried to visit it, one of my bigger misses in Turkey, if I could have.  According to both Virtual Ani and Wikipedia, &quot;gaining access to the monastery, which was never easy, is now virtually impossible.&quot;  I don't know if that's true but, like Ani, it's right up on the border.  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/serdarkaya/4221103193/in/photostream/\">www.flickr.com/photos/serdarkaya/4221103193/in/photostream/</a>  Off the beaten track 15 km.s NE of Ani, it sits high on a bluff overlooking the Akhurian and the Armenian border and includes at least 2 royal crypts, incl. one of the Bagratid kings, and a tapering, octagonal ceiling vault which for its scale must be one of the most impressive works of ancient Armenian art (if not THE most) anywhere.  (See below.) \n\t- 13th cent. Armenian writers claimed that Horomos was founded by monks fleeing from the Roman (i.e. Byzantine) empire, and that its name meant 'of the Romans'.  Stephanos Ashoghik of Taron: &quot;The monastery called Horomos ... was built by Hovhannes, who was decorated with ornaments of mercy, for he distributed possessions mercifully and virtuously to the point of giving away all of his clothes whenever he came across poor people.  He intended it to be a resting place for passers-by and travellers, so that all strangers may rest as if in their own homes.  The same token of mercy is still observed today in that monastery.&quot;  \n\t- Horomos, &quot;one of the most important religious and cultural centres in medieval Armenia [and &quot;one of the largest in the Christian east&quot; {wikipedia}], was founded [on a caravan route] in the reign of King Abas I Bagratuni (r 929-953), a period of monastic revival in Armenia.&quot;  Following the relocation of the Bagratid kingdom to Ani in 961, part of the monastery became a royal necropolis.  &quot;Sacked and burned by Muslims in 982, it was restored and enlarged under the later Bagratids who built new chapels and churches.&quot;  Ani was captured by the Turks in 1064, but &quot;after a break, donative inscriptions began to reappear on the bldg.s as early as 1174.  A manuscript from the 1180s describes it as a renowned religious and cultural centre.  It became an important burial site for the feudal families who governed Ani on behalf of the Mkhargrdzeli dynasty, rulers of the Ani region in the 13th cent.  The monastery had a large library and an active scriptorium and the archbishops of Ani and northern Armenia likely sat there.  The most recent inscription from the medieval period at Horomos dates from 1336.  In 1788 the monastery was renovated, the circuit walls restored, and the cupola bell tower built (or rebuilt).  John Ussher visited in the early 1860s and found it to be in derelict condition with only one monk in residence. Further renovations and restorations took place in 1852, 1868, 1871, and 1878.\n\t- &quot;Many visitors to Ani in the 19th century stayed at Horomos, and the monastery continued in operation until 1920.  In the Russian period a village surrounded the main part of the monastery, which is entirely deserted today.  Some bldg.s have entirely vanished, the dome of the Church of St. John collapsed, and most of the surviving walls have been stripped of facing masonry since 1920. \n\t- The monastery consists in 2 groups of structures in a rectangular fortified enclosure on an elevated part of a peninsula at the edge of cliffs above the river.  Only fragments of the defensive outer walls remain.  The first is built @ the church of Saint John (pre-1038), a rectangular 'domed hall' with traces of frescos, likely from the 13th cent.  Its outer hall or 'zhamatun' ('church house') is the most prominent and architecturally influential, surviving structure at Horomos.  (Zhamatuns were used as meeting places and as mausoleums as interments were forbidden in churches.)  The 2nd group is known as the 'House of the relics'.  \n\t- An inscription on the outer wall of the Zhamatun:  &quot;In the 487th year of the Armenian era (1038), I, Hovhannes Shahanshah, son of Gagik Shahanshah, donated my orchards in Kulp to my church Surb Hovhannes which I built with this zhamatun in the monastery of Horomos.  Also I granted 100 loads of salt each year, free of all duty, during the patriarchate of lord Petros and the prelacy of this congregation of father Hovhannes [King Hovhannes-Smbat, r. 1020 - 1042].  Now if anyone after us opposes this decree and my grant, he shall be responsible for my sins before God, and shall be cursed in life and in death by the 318 patriarchs who gathered at Nicea. [!] And those who abide by this decree shall be blessed by Christ.&quot;\n\t- When I think of Horomos, I think of royal tombs and this: an octagonal, pyramidal vault in the central portion or division of the ceiling ending in an oculus skylight, capped externally by a lantern dome (once a bell-tower) set on tall, slender columns.  The 8 flat, tapering surfaces in the vault are richly decorated panels covered in low-relief sculpture.  One depicts God seated and framed by an arched canopy with angels on either side, the symbols of the 4 Evangelists, and 2 rows of 4 figures identified by an inscription as representing St. Gregory the Illuminator, his sons Aristakes and Vrt‘anès, and Yusik, son of Vrtanes.  This vault could be the most impressive ancient or medieval Armenian work of art, for its scale, that I know of.  See this.: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horomos#/media/File:The_Monastery_of_Horomos_\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horomos#/media/File:The_Monastery_o...</a>(Ghoshavank)_(4218751594).jpg   Visit with a ladder, make some good rubbings of those panels on paper, frame them, and I bet you could sell them for some good $$.  Flat ceilings to the north and south of the central aisle are also decorated at their centre with elaborate crosses, and the walls and arches are covered in Armenian inscriptions.  According to Virtual Ani, all the windows and most of the doors have been blocked up, and the bldg. is now used as a shelter for sheep. (Huh?). \n\t- The adjoining 'Mausoleum of Ruzukan', a 2-level funerary chapel, was built in 1215 by Khatlu Khatun in memory of her parents, in particular her mother Ruzukan, and to house the tombs of members of her family.  The crypt at ground level is square and hall-like under an octagonal, flat ceiling, with a row of 4 richly decorated khachkars on one wall.  3 small chapels built side by side (the central one surmounted by a round drum and dome) open onto a platform on the upper level.   \n\t- The group of bldg.s known as the 'House of the Relics' incl. 3 separate but linked structures.: 1. the 'Mausoleum of Vache' (1229, Prince Vache Vacutian, governor of Ani @ 1213-'32), in a square plan with interior walls divided into 3 bays each by arcading.  The collapsed roof appears to have been a pyramidal vault of honeycomb corbelling, similar to the one I saw in the Yakutiye medresse (1310) in Erzurum.;  2. 'the Zhamatun of Aruits' aka 'the Hall of the Synod'. Almost square in plan, its interior is divided into 9 compartments by slightly pointed arches on 4 columns and 8 engaged pillars.  The central compartment has a corbelled honeycomb vault, and the ceilings for the rest are similar to those in the Minuchihr mosque.  One wall contains a large, semi-circular niche with a base raised above the floor level.  It was said that the throne of the governor or the archbishop of Ani was set within it.  Or it may have been used as an altar or for the display of particular holy relics.  In the centre of the niche was a khachkar (now gone), and numerous khatchkars were carved into the other walls.;  3. 'The Mausoleum of Aruits' (1277): an ante-chamber, it differs radically in its architecture from all other bldg.s at Horomos and Ani apart from the hall of the Holy Apostles church, with its roof supported on parallel arches that intersect at a honeycomb vault topped by an oculus above the centre of the room.\n\t- Below and north of the main complex, 3 churches stand on a rise encircled by a dry oxbow of the river, those of St. Minas, St. George, and the chapel of King Ashot, each older than anything in the main complex.  The original site of the monastery may have been here.  Old views show them surrounded by khatchkars and other funereal monuments, all gone now.  St. Minas and St. George are rectangular 'domed halls', almost identical in design, with fallen drums and domes.  St Minas had an inscription from 986 recording the gift of an orchard to the monastery, and one on the church of St. George records its construction by King Gagik I of Ani (r 989-1120).  \n\t- Only parts of the north and east walls of King Ashot's Chapel and Tomb, a small, single nave, barrel-vaulted bldg. with an apse, still stand.  It once housed a large monument that bore the inscription 'Ashot T'agawor' ('Ashot the King') and the yr. 977 (Ashot III, 953-'77).  It survived until 1920, but not a stone remains today.  Another tomb next to it was that of Ashot III's queen, Xosrovannush, according to tradition.\n\t- The remains of the 'Triumphal arch', twin towers in the form of massive rectangular piers joined by an archway, overlook the monastery.  There were little domed chapels atop each tower to which a door at the base of each gave access, and there was a walkway above the archway.  (It must've been huge).  1102 was inscribed on one of the towers.  Largely intact before 1920, little of it survives.

        "text": "www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/index.htm\n\n- This best-preserved monument at Ani was built in 1215 during the reign of the Zakarids (the Mqargrdzeli in Georgian sources), a Georgian alliance of princes which took Ani from the Kurdish Shaddadid emirs with a combined Georgian and Armenian army in 1199 and ruled there until 1237. Ani experienced renewed prosperity, expansion, and the patronage of new monuments based on the revival of trade routes in that period until the devastation wrought by the Mongols was visited on the region. This church was commissioned by Tigran Honents, a wealthy Armenian merchant who provided it with crosses, lamps, gold and silver vessels and relics. While it's as Armenian in appearance as any other church on-site, according to virtualani.org and Wikipedia it's believed to have been \"devoted to the Georgian Orthodox rite.\" The interior contains extensive fresco cycles which are \"rare in Armenian architecture, and so it's believed that these were executed by Georgian artisans.\" One of these depicts scenes from the life of Christ while the other is \"an unusual cycle\" of the events, trials and torments in the Life of St. Gregory the Illuminator (incl. the baptism of King Trdat and the kings of Georgia, Abkhazia, Caucasian Albania, et al.) which, according to Anthony Eastmond, \"is the most developed monumental narrative of a saint to survive from the Orthodox world up to this period.\" Wow! 17 of 18 scenes depict events in the life of the saint. The last, however, is devoted to St. Nino, the evangelist of Georgia, and \"depicts the miracle of the life-giving pillar\", a key event in the establishment of Christianity in Georgia. Further, \"all of the images in the church and their placement are consistent with Byzantinizing frescoes at that time in both style and layout. The inscriptions identifying the scenes and figures are painted in Greek and Georgian, with Armenian reserved for the exterior dedicatory inscription. Eastmond argues that “although the donor of the church was Armenian, it served a larger community comprised of both Armenians and Georgians.” dspace.nplg.gov.ge/bitstream/1234/152975/3/Georgian_Art_I... So it could have been an ecumenical church, both Apostolic and Orthodox. This interpretation is, again, controversial. The cycle of St. Gregory is held out by the Armenian National Committee of America to be proof that the church was Armenian, as Gregory was the first patriarch and the founder of the Armenian Apostolic Church. In this article, the said Committee calls out the Turkish 'Ministry of Culture and Tourism' for its apparent mischief in proclaiming the church to be Chalcedonic (Georgian) in the course of its stabilization, stirring the pot /b/ Armenia and Georgia. anca.org/turkey-falsifies-historical-facts-around-tigran-...\n\n- These frescoes were the most extensive that I'd seen in any church that trip east of Istanbul. www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/stgregt8.jpg They include \"an unusual panel with motifs that evoke silk textile designs of that time. Four linked medallions each enclose a 'simurgh', a mythical lion-[or dog?]-headed bird from Persian legend.\" www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/stgregt11s.jpg (I'll scan a photo.)\n\n- The plan of the church is of a type referred to as 'a domed hall', with one nave divided into 3 sections under a central dome. Before its entrance are the ruins of a narthex and a small chapel from a later period in which fragmentary [Byzantinizing] frescoes survive, which you can see at the entrance in this photo. The exterior of the church is impressively decorated with ornate stone carvings of real and imaginary animals in the spandrels /b/ blind arcades that cover all 4 sides of the church.\n\n- Vloggers tour this church from the 1:18 - 2:10 min. pt. in this video.: youtu.be/ejhSDO6SYSc\n\n- This church and all structures at Ani are constructed with the use of local volcanic basalt, a sort of tufa stone. It's easily carved and comes in a variety of vibrant colors, from creamy yellow to rose-red to brown to charcoal. This stone is used for the finely cut masonry cladding on the walls and vaults, with a mortared rubble core behind or within.\n\nThe other constructions on-site that I toured (and which aren't in these 4 photos) include:\n\n- The huge City Walls: The site of Ani is naturally well-defended on a triangular plateau protected on 2 sides by steep cliffs. The only considerable stretch of flat, unbroken ground is along its northern edge. While the whole city was encircled by walls, a line of massive double walls were constructed along its vulnerable north side by King Smbat (r. 977-989). Prior to their construction, the city walls ran across the narrowest point of the site and enclosed an area not much larger than the citadel. (Those had been built by King Ashot III when he transferred his capital from Kars to Ani in 961.) The scattering of ruins that extends into the plain suggests that even these new walls didn't enclose an area large enough to contain the whole population.\n\n- The walls are \"undoubtedly the most visually impressive part of Ani, and give a unique character to the ruins.\" The line of double walls was built as a barrier to close the level ground between two ravines. The outer wall is much lower and less well preserved than the inner, and is preceded by a dry moat. The high inner wall is pierced by a series of large and closely set semicircular towers, often considerably taller than the wall itself. These have 2 or sometimes 3 floors of accommodation within them.\n\n- The walls are constructed of a rubble concrete core with a thin facing of finely cut and joined beige basalt. Red or black stone was used at intervals to decorate them with patterns, crosses, heraldic or talismanic animals, symbols, etc. Gates in the outer and inner walls are staggered. Assailants forcing an outer gate would face a solid wall flanked by towers and would be confined to the narrow space between the walls, unable to manoeuvre well or to use a battering ram.\n\n- While the basic layout of the double walls dates from the 10th cent., they were substantially strengthened over the following centuries. Walls were thickened by adding additional masonry facings. In some spots 4 different faces are revealed, like the layers of an onion. Within several towers earlier crenellations are ‘fossilized’ within later masonry, indicating that the towers originally rose to < 1/2 their current height. 12th and 13th cent. Armenian inscriptions state that the construction of some of these towers was sponsored by private individuals.\n\n- There were 3 main gates in the double walls, the Checker-board (named after a panel of red and black stone squares over its entrance, dating from the 10th cent. with a renovation of the towers by the Shaddadids [r. 1164-'99]), Lion (likely the main entrance, named after a large relief of a lion set in the wall [which I don't recall] and protected by twin towers, the east remaining today) and Kars gates. The towers on either side of the Kars gate are the largest and tallest remaining in the walls. The rooms within them are complex and this fortified gate is almost a castle in itself. An arch once stretched /b/ the towers and over the entrance, permitting defenders to fire directly down at assailants. Beyond the Kars gate is a stretch of powerful and impressive ramparts. The outer wall is almost as strong as the inner where it turns to the SE, and has a massive tower lavishly decorated with polychrome stonework (incl. a prominent cross sculpted in contrasting black stone). My memory's fuzzy but I explored the length of these walls walking towards the SE and would've explored the towers.\n\n- The 'Church of the Holy Apostles' (Surp Arak'elots): An important church appears to have been founded by the princely Pahlavuni dynasty and to have been used by the archbishops of Ani belonging to that dynasty. ... The earliest inscription on its walls dates from 1031 and refers to a donation of land made by Abughamir Pahlavuni. Its ground plan is of 'an inscribed quatrefoil with corner chambers' (ie. it has a 4-apsed interior within a rectangular plan, and had 4 rooms [chapels?] in the spaces within the corners, each under its own dome and drum [unique in Armenian architecture], with an apse and a 'fully articulated interior').\n\n- This church was originally built in the midst of an open courtyard which filled with bldg.s over the centuries. Only one, the south narthex, survives to any appreciable extent. Otherwise, the courtyard was entirely paved with stone slabs incl. gravestones and khatchkars. The complex included what appear to be 4 mausoleums, incl. a vaulted room beneath the street, and a chamber which once housed a large khatchkar dedicated to Catholicos Barsegh (1184). The oldest structure on the site is a small church (possibly as old as the 7th cent.), and which had a single nave ending in a semicircular apse.\n\n- The south narthex (likely early 13th cent.) has a richly carved eastern facade that survives largely intact and displays many Armenian inscriptions dating from 1215 to 1348. Several are secular, e.g. decrees re reductions in taxes and trading levies, and suggest the bldg. was used for secular as well as religious purposes. The bldg.'s design is strongly influenced by contemporary Seljuk and Iranian art, with an entrance in the form of a pishtaq - a portal in a niche in the form of an eivan, surrounded by a decorative frame and with a muqarnas vault at the top, all beneath porthole windows. The rest of the facade comprises shallow, v-shaped niches alternating with vertical bands of decorative interlace carvings.\n\n- The dynamic interior is \"a tour-de-force\" of masonry. A pair of diagonally-crossing arches support the ceiling (uniquely so in medieval Armenian bldg.s) and frame a lozenge shaped central compartment beneath a fine muqarnas dome. (I'll scan a photo.) The remaining compartments have flat ceilings richly decorated with patterns formed from inlaid red, brown, and black stone.\n\n- 'The Georgian Church': This was a large, rectangular structure with a double-pitched roof, no dome, and a single nave ending in a semicircular apse. There was an arcade of 3 bays separated by engaged columns along the internal north and south walls. Arches rising from those columns supported a barrel vaulted roof. A long, semi-subterranean, barrel-vaulted room under the nave may have served as a crypt. Only the north wall of the nave remains standing. I probably missed bas-reliefs in 2 arcades depicting 'the Annunciation' (Luke 1:28) and 'the Visitation' (Luke 1:41). (I photographed the ruins of the church with its lone, standing wall, but I don't know how well I toured them.)\n\n- There was an inscription in Georgian (1288) on part of the south wall. Another 20-line-long inscription (1218) was discovered in 1910 on 44 facing blocks on the remains of the rest of that wall. The fragments were re-assembled and displayed outside the Ani museum (the Minuchihr mosque). They vanished after WW1 and 5 of the missing blocks were discovered built into the walls of houses in Ani (Ocakli) village in 1998. That inscription recorded a pastoral sermon by Epiphane, the Catholicos of Georgia, to Georgians living in Ani. At the end it was signed (in Armenian) by Grigor, the Armenian archbishop of Ani, and by the emir Vahram, the governor of Ani. It announced the reduction of Church taxes, encouraged the faithful to be more generous, and warned Georgian priests against following heretical practices.\n\n- 'Georgian' didn't simply refer to an ethnic Georgian in that period. 'Georgian' was a denomination and \"would have designated all those in Ani who professed the Chalcedonian faith. Although the Georgian church controlled this church, its congregation would have been primarily Armenian.\" (Virtual Ani) The inscription dates the bldg. to the 13th cent. when Ani was under Georgian control.\n\n- The ruins of 'the Georgian church' might've been the last I toured at Ani as I was called over by soldiers by the entrance gate before I could tour the ruins of King Gagik's Church and 'the Palace' nearby at the NW corner of the site. (See below)\n\nI don't recall the following.:\n\n- The remains of the Citadel, the 'Inner fortress', on a level hill in the south of the site: Encircled by a single line of ruined ramparts and with towers on its north side, its ramparts are presumed to date in part from the 7th cent. reign of the Kamsarakan dynasty, with periodic renovations and improvements until the 13th. This was the site of the elaborate palace and the private churches and chapels (at least 5) of Ani's Bagratid rulers, their successors, and possibly their predecessors the Kamsarakans too. The palace had been added to and reconstructed many times before it was finally abandoned, likely by the end of the 15th cent., and later looted for its masonry. Much of it had been destroyed by fire at one time. Divided by a 59 m. corridor, the northern 1/2 of the complex includes a small bath-house (with plumbing and some hypocaust) and 3 elevated 'ceremonial halls'. One, 'the NW hall', was 20 x 10 m.s2 with windows overlooking the city, but the 'East' or 'Basilica hall' (it took the form of a basilica) was the jewel in its day, with 2 rows of painted wooden columns that supported sculpted wooden arches, and with \"a frieze, painted onto wood and framed by plaster rosettes gilded in gold, [that] ran above the arcade and depicted persons of nobility.\" The wooden ceiling was sculpted and frescoed, and \"frescoes on the walls depicted flower gardens and groups of horsemen.\" Nikolai Marr, the archaeologist who excavated the site in 1908-'09, later wrote the following: \"... the artefacts collected were sufficient to confirm that the zeal of the builders had been concentrated on decorating this [East] hall in an exceptional manner. The tales in old Armenian accounts of the gold covered rooms in the royal palace of Ani had seemed to us to be only legendary exaggerations. Remains found in the underground level of the basilica hall [that had fallen down from the upper East Hall] allow us to establish that it was not a legend, but the literal truth\". !\n\n- The southern 1/2 of the palace includes a spacious hall above a large cistern and divided from a raised annex by a wooden, painted partition screen.\n\n- 3 of the ruined churches in the citadel are written up in some detail in the entries at 'Virtual Ani' in the following links.: The Palace Church (at the east end of the Palace, and which appears to date from the 7th cent. (!), so built by the Kamsarakan): www.virtualani.org/citadel/palacechurch.htm ; the Hexagonal Church (built by Prince Abu'khanm in 1026, notably with slightly pointed arches in the 6 apses in the interior): www.virtualani.org/citadel/hexagonalchurch.htm ; and the so-called 'Mausoleum of the Child Princes' (@ 1050-'75; again the arches in its vaults are slightly pointed) www.virtualani.org/citadel/childprinceschurch.htm .\n\n- A Zoroastrian fire temple. (There's a good chance I saw the remains of this bldg. but didn't know what it was.) It's believed to date from the Arsacid period (1st-4th cent. A.D.) and to be the oldest structure at Ani. It might also have been an early Christian monument: an open-air martyrion from the 4th or 5th cent. (the only known open-air non-subterranean martyrion in Armenia if so). A Byzantine coin from the reign of Justin I (518-527 A.D.) was found in or near this bldg., possibly the only known coin from that period found at Ani. The remains of the 'fire-temple' consist in 4 squat, round columns, 1.3 m.s in diameter, beneath plain capitals and on cylindrical bases set 1.8 m.s apart in the form of a square (with an altar likely at the centre), and made from a gritty, black basalt (only used at Ani in these columns and in the tower by the gate of the citadel, likely recycled from this temple complex). The large size of the columns suggests a stone roof. At an unknown date the structure was converted into a chapel (apparently a private chapel) with the construction of 4 exedera /b/ the columns, little of which have survived.\n\n- \"The existence in Armenia of Zoroastrian temple structures in the form of a domed square on 4 pillars may have encouraged the evolution of the centrally planned, domed church so typical of Christian Armenian architecture.\" (Virtual Ani)\n\nThe Kizkale, which I almost toured:\n\n\"At the southern end of Ani, south of the citadel hill, the site narrows into a dramatic promontory almost encircled by the Arpa/Akhurian river and protected by near vertical cliffs. Its flat top was once a separate fortified enclosure. Known as Kizkale, \"Maiden's Castle\" in Turkish and Kuysiamrots (Virgin's Castle) or Kusanats (Virgins' Castle) in Armenian, a pagan temple dedicated to the goddess Anahit stood here before 300 A.D. which was then destroyed by St. Gregory the Illuminator who then erected a church on the site, according to tradition. The site's never been excavated.\n\n- The Kizkale church: An inscription: \"In the time of the [Georgian] queen of queens T'amar, annointed by God and pious, I, shahanshah Zak'aria amirspasalar, her faithful servant, son of the great Sargis Mkhargrtzeli, by the will of God erected this monument ... in this monastery, close to the church built by our Illuminator, Saint Grigor.\" The ruined church ('Surp Astvadzadzin', the 'Church of the Holy Mother of God' according to the historian Alishan writing in 1881) stands at the very edge of the cliff. The Zak'aria of the inscription was the Georgian-appointed governor of Ani from 1198 to '99. The church was rectangular in its form with twin V-shaped niches in each facade and a dome, and cruciform in the interior. There were small chapels on 2 levels in each corner. Parts of the bldg. incorporate repurposed material, perhaps from an earlier church. The dome and the SW section collapsed long ago and an earthquake destroyed the SE corner in 1988.\n\n- \"The panoramic vista from here back over the city is extremely impressive, as are the views along the river that forms the Turkish-Armenian border.\"\n\n- The foundations of houses are better preserved here than in the rest of the city (Virtual Ani). According to Wikipedia, Ani wasn't entirely abandoned until 1735 when the last monks left the monastery in the Kizkale.\n\n- I knew I wasn't supposed to climb up to this site, but forget how I knew. Virtual Ani writes that \"the peninsula lies outside the wire-mesh fence that surrounds most of Ani.\" Maybe there'd been a sign. I hiked over towards it and tried climbing up to it anyway, but a cliff on its north side on the final approach was a little too steep and crumbly. I tried it from a few angles but gave up. I was a little self-conscious too as I thought the soldiers at the gate might be watching. Sure enough, when I retrieved my passport from them as I was leaving, one made a point to tell me that they'd watched my efforts to reach the Kizkale with their binoculars. I didn't get a scolding, but I was leaving. According to Virtual Ani \"the summit can be reached by either of 2 difficult paths that wind their way around each side of the promontory. The one along the side overlooking the Akhurian was probably the original approach as it's guarded by the ruins of a gateway.\" Again, I tried to tackle it head-on and don't recall any paths @ the side. You can clearly see one in the video in the next link at the 4:09 min. pt. in shadow on the left or north side of the promontory. I scrambled up the steep, sunlit slope to the cliff you can see at the top. If I'd seen and followed the path at the side below one cliff and high above another, or cut into the cliff, I would've passed the Kizkale from below, walked to the end of the promontory facing Armenia, and doubled back by climbing up to the church. What a miss.\n\n- Vloggers approach the Kizkale on 'the proper path' or one of 2 (the one on the sunlit side, not seen at the 4:09 pt.) and tour it from the 4 min. pt. in this vlog.: youtu.be/dW7lSq474cM\n\nStructures I missed.:\n\n- I spent most of a full day at Ani, but it's spread out and there's much that I missed. I don't recall, didn't photograph, and likely missed 2 bldg.s at the far NW corner of the site, the Church of King Gagik and a Selcuk palace.\n\n- King Gagik's church: The ruins of this church was an important miss that I walked past at a distance of only @ 200 m.s.\n\n- Stephanos Asoghik of Taron: \"It was at that time, at the end of the 1000th year of Our Lord's incarnation, at the time of the Emperor Basil, that Gagik, King of Armenia, was taken with the idea of building in the city of Ani a church similar in size and plan to the great church at Vagharshapat, dedicated to St. Gregory, which was then in ruins [Zvart'nots].\"\n\n- King Gagik (r 990 - 1020) is said to have hired the architect Trdat (he who designed the cathedral of Ani) to build his 'Millennium' church, erected /b/ 1001 and 1005 (although some sources claim /b/ 990 and 1000).\n\n- The grandiose cathedral of Zvart'nots (the 'Vigilant Angels') erected /b/ 642 and 662, destroyed in the 10th cent. in an earthquake and the inspiration for this church, was the most acclaimed monument of early medieval Armenia. It was built on the alleged site of the meeting /b/ King Trdat of Armenia and St. Gregory the Illuminator as recounted by the Armenian historian Agathangelos in the 4th cent., and was built to house the remains of the saint according to tradition. The patron of Zvart'nots was the Armenian Catholicos Nerses III (i.e. 'the Builder'). He was pro-Byzantine and his cathedral united Byzantine and Armenian architectural forms, resulting in a strikingly elegant, complex, and boldly innovative design, a circular ambulatory wrapped around an inscribed quatrefoil interior (4 open apses within a round outer wall) that closely resembles the size and ground-plan of the Zvart'nots original and of the famous church at Bana the ruins of which I toured en route to Kars.\n\n- \"The structure was never very stable. It was consolidated in 1013 with the addition of extra masonry @ the 2 central columns of each apse [composite 'Armeo-Ionic' cushion capitals], converting them into piers, but this was unsuccessful and the church collapsed shortly afterwards. Houses were built @ and over the ruins in the 13th cent. with some of the fallen masonry. Excavations in 1906 revealed many objects of worship, incl. a bronze candlestick and a chandelier. Only foundations survive and so the appearance of the bldg. is uncertain (like that at Zvart'nots). A [larger than life-sized] statue of King Gagik holding a model of the church was found in the dig, but the upper portion of the model was missing. Both King Gagik’s church at Ani and the Zvart'nots church [and that at Bana] resembled tall, 3-stepped rotundas. Their quatrefoil interior space rose up through 3 stories and was topped with a high dome on a drum. (It's unknown whether the exterior of the 2nd level was circular or quatrefoil [circular is less structurally sound]).\"\n\n- 'The Merchant's palace': The surviving 2-storey structure may have been the late 12th or 13th cent. residence of a wealthy merchant or prince or bishop, or a military structure, perhaps a barracks, the walls of which connect to the outer defenses of the city. There are no surviving inscriptions. A basement at the back is a labyrinth of rooms and narrow corridors, likely intended for storage.\n\n- \"The imposing, sumptuously decorated gateway in the eastern facade is the most remarkable aspect of the bldg.\" It includes a richly inlaid panel with 8-pointed stars alternating with crosses, both incised with intricate decorations (and very photogenic), and an inlay of hexagonal polychrome stone in the tympanum. But most of these stone inlays have vanished.\n\n- It's a shame I missed it in 2000 as the ensuing Turkish 'restoration' has been unkind. The author of 'Virtual Ani' doesn't mince words on that point.:\n\n\"The southern walls of the palace had fallen by the end of the 19th cent., revealing the vaults of the basement. In the early 1990s these were partly rebuilt in a poorly executed 'restoration' that destroyed much of the original fabric and used stone that was entirely different in size, colour and quality from the original. However bad that work was, it was as nothing compared to the hideous 'restoration' which began in 1999. Following faithfully in the tradition of Turkish restorations at Ani and elsewhere, there is now far more new masonry in the Palace than original masonry! The new stonework does not match the old in colour nor finish, and there's no archaeological evidence which indicates that the rebuilt walls originally looked like this. [The reconstruction of the entrance gateway in 2000] involved the removal of all the remaining star and cross inlays and their replacement with crude, undecorated copies. See 'The Rape of Ani' for a more detailed account of the destruction. [ www.virtualani.org/history/restorations.htm ] All this work goes entirely against the established techniques of modern archaeological conservation practiced elsewhere in the world.\"\n\n- Re the 'restoration' of the medieval walls, organized and funded by the Turkish Min. of Culture.: \"Restoration in Turkey often simply involves destruction followed by a crude reconstruction - many historic monuments have been irreparably ruined by such 'restorations'. ... Local contractors and politicians (often the same people) were making a great deal of money from the 'restorations'. In 1999 the process of destruction was resumed on a grander scale and the workers now had an on-site stone-cutting factory. The walls of this factory were built entirely from stone looted from the ruins! ... [This] went against every established practice of modern archaeological conservation. ... Local opposition to the restorations is minimal, confined primarily to the few people in Kars who make a living from tourism. ... In Turkey, to criticize the powerful is a dangerous thing to do - it's too much to expect for some old bldg.s that aren't even Turkish. ...\" (Virtual Ani)\n\n- the 'Horomos Monastery' aka Ghoshavank: The following write-up is the longest I think I've written in this stream about a site or sight that I didn't tour (so far); it's just an edit really of 3 pages of content from Virtual Ani. (I should edit it down further, but as the saying goes \"I don't have time to be brief.\") On seeing photos of it and reading about it online with an Armenian friend of mine after returning home, I now consider it to be the most interesting, significant, and photogenic complex of ancient or medieval Armenian bldg.s in Turkey. I wish I'd known about it and had tried to visit it, one of my bigger misses in Turkey, if I could have. According to both Virtual Ani and Wikipedia, \"gaining access to the monastery, which was never easy, is now virtually impossible.\" I don't know if that's true but, like Ani, it's right up on the border. www.flickr.com/photos/serdarkaya/4221103193/in/photostream/ Off the beaten track 15 km.s NE of Ani, it sits high on a bluff overlooking the Akhurian and the Armenian border and includes at least 2 royal crypts, incl. one of the Bagratid kings, and a tapering, octagonal ceiling vault which for its scale must be one of the most impressive works of ancient Armenian art (if not THE most) anywhere. (See below.)\n\n- 13th cent. Armenian writers claimed that Horomos was founded by monks fleeing from the Roman (i.e. Byzantine) empire, and that its name meant 'of the Romans'. Stephanos Ashoghik of Taron: \"The monastery called Horomos ... was built by Hovhannes, who was decorated with ornaments of mercy, for he distributed possessions mercifully and virtuously to the point of giving away all of his clothes whenever he came across poor people. He intended it to be a resting place for passers-by and travellers, so that all strangers may rest as if in their own homes. The same token of mercy is still observed today in that monastery.\"\n\n- Horomos, \"one of the most important religious and cultural centres in medieval Armenia [and \"one of the largest in the Christian east\" {wikipedia}], was founded [on a caravan route] in the reign of King Abas I Bagratuni (r 929-953), a period of monastic revival in Armenia.\" Following the relocation of the Bagratid kingdom to Ani in 961, part of the monastery became a royal necropolis. \"Sacked and burned by Muslims in 982, it was restored and enlarged under the later Bagratids who built new chapels and churches.\" Ani was captured by the Turks in 1064, but \"after a break, donative inscriptions began to reappear on the bldg.s as early as 1174. A manuscript from the 1180s describes it as a renowned religious and cultural centre. It became an important burial site for the feudal families who governed Ani on behalf of the Mkhargrdzeli dynasty, rulers of the Ani region in the 13th cent. The monastery had a large library and an active scriptorium and the archbishops of Ani and northern Armenia likely sat there. The most recent inscription from the medieval period at Horomos dates from 1336. In 1788 the monastery was renovated, the circuit walls restored, and the cupola bell tower built (or rebuilt). John Ussher visited in the early 1860s and found it to be in derelict condition with only one monk in residence. Further renovations and restorations took place in 1852, 1868, 1871, and 1878.\n\n- \"Many visitors to Ani in the 19th century stayed at Horomos, and the monastery continued in operation until 1920. In the Russian period a village surrounded the main part of the monastery, which is entirely deserted today. Some bldg.s have entirely vanished, the dome of the Church of St. John collapsed, and most of the surviving walls have been stripped of facing masonry since 1920.\n\n- The monastery consists in 2 groups of structures in a rectangular fortified enclosure on an elevated part of a peninsula at the edge of cliffs above the river. Only fragments of the defensive outer walls remain. The first is built @ the church of Saint John (pre-1038), a rectangular 'domed hall' with traces of frescos, likely from the 13th cent. Its outer hall or 'zhamatun' ('church house') is the most prominent and architecturally influential, surviving structure at Horomos. (Zhamatuns were used as meeting places and as mausoleums as interments were forbidden in churches.) The 2nd group is known as the 'House of the relics'.\n\n- An inscription on the outer wall of the Zhamatun: \"In the 487th year of the Armenian era (1038), I, Hovhannes Shahanshah, son of Gagik Shahanshah, donated my orchards in Kulp to my church Surb Hovhannes which I built with this zhamatun in the monastery of Horomos. Also I granted 100 loads of salt each year, free of all duty, during the patriarchate of lord Petros and the prelacy of this congregation of father Hovhannes [King Hovhannes-Smbat, r. 1020 - 1042]. Now if anyone after us opposes this decree and my grant, he shall be responsible for my sins before God, and shall be cursed in life and in death by the 318 patriarchs who gathered at Nicea. [!] And those who abide by this decree shall be blessed by Christ.\"\n\n- When I think of Horomos, I think of royal tombs and this: an octagonal, pyramidal vault in the central portion or division of the ceiling ending in an oculus skylight, capped externally by a lantern dome (once a bell-tower) set on tall, slender columns. The 8 flat, tapering surfaces in the vault are richly decorated panels covered in low-relief sculpture. One depicts God seated and framed by an arched canopy with angels on either side, the symbols of the 4 Evangelists, and 2 rows of 4 figures identified by an inscription as representing St. Gregory the Illuminator, his sons Aristakes and Vrt‘anès, and Yusik, son of Vrtanes. This vault could be the most impressive ancient or medieval Armenian work of art, for its scale, that I know of. See this.: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horomos#/media/File:The_Monastery_o...(Ghoshavank)_(4218751594).jpg Visit with a ladder, make some good rubbings of those panels on paper, frame them, and I bet you could sell them for some good $$. Flat ceilings to the north and south of the central aisle are also decorated at their centre with elaborate crosses, and the walls and arches are covered in Armenian inscriptions. According to Virtual Ani, all the windows and most of the doors have been blocked up, and the bldg. is now used as a shelter for sheep. (Huh?).\n\n- The adjoining 'Mausoleum of Ruzukan', a 2-level funerary chapel, was built in 1215 by Khatlu Khatun in memory of her parents, in particular her mother Ruzukan, and to house the tombs of members of her family. The crypt at ground level is square and hall-like under an octagonal, flat ceiling, with a row of 4 richly decorated khachkars on one wall. 3 small chapels built side by side (the central one surmounted by a round drum and dome) open onto a platform on the upper level.\n\n- The group of bldg.s known as the 'House of the Relics' incl. 3 separate but linked structures.: 1. the 'Mausoleum of Vache' (1229, Prince Vache Vacutian, governor of Ani @ 1213-'32), in a square plan with interior walls divided into 3 bays each by arcading. The collapsed roof appears to have been a pyramidal vault of honeycomb corbelling, similar to the one I saw in the Yakutiye medresse (1310) in Erzurum.; 2. 'the Zhamatun of Aruits' aka 'the Hall of the Synod'. Almost square in plan, its interior is divided into 9 compartments by slightly pointed arches on 4 columns and 8 engaged pillars. The central compartment has a corbelled honeycomb vault, and the ceilings for the rest are similar to those in the Minuchihr mosque. One wall contains a large, semi-circular niche with a base raised above the floor level. It was said that the throne of the governor or the archbishop of Ani was set within it. Or it may have been used as an altar or for the display of particular holy relics. In the centre of the niche was a khachkar (now gone), and numerous khatchkars were carved into the other walls.; 3. 'The Mausoleum of Aruits' (1277): an ante-chamber, it differs radically in its architecture from all other bldg.s at Horomos and Ani apart from the hall of the Holy Apostles church, with its roof supported on parallel arches that intersect at a honeycomb vault topped by an oculus above the centre of the room.\n\n- Below and north of the main complex, 3 churches stand on a rise encircled by a dry oxbow of the river, those of St. Minas, St. George, and the chapel of King Ashot, each older than anything in the main complex. The original site of the monastery may have been here. Old views show them surrounded by khatchkars and other funereal monuments, all gone now. St. Minas and St. George are rectangular 'domed halls', almost identical in design, with fallen drums and domes. St Minas had an inscription from 986 recording the gift of an orchard to the monastery, and one on the church of St. George records its construction by King Gagik I of Ani (r 989-1120).\n\n- Only parts of the north and east walls of King Ashot's Chapel and Tomb, a small, single nave, barrel-vaulted bldg. with an apse, still stand. It once housed a large monument that bore the inscription 'Ashot T'agawor' ('Ashot the King') and the yr. 977 (Ashot III, 953-'77). It survived until 1920, but not a stone remains today. Another tomb next to it was that of Ashot III's queen, Xosrovannush, according to tradition.\n\n- The remains of the 'Triumphal arch', twin towers in the form of massive rectangular piers joined by an archway, overlook the monastery. There were little domed chapels atop each tower to which a door at the base of each gave access, and there was a walkway above the archway. (It must've been huge). 1102 was inscribed on one of the towers. Largely intact before 1920, little of it survives.
