        "text": "Originally posted by MPea3\n\nWord History: We know where Hoosiers come from: Indiana. But where does the name Hoosier come from? That is less easy to answer. The origins of Hoosier are rather obscure, but the most likely possibility is that the term is an alteration of hoozer, an English dialect word recorded in Cumberland, a former county of northwest England, in the late 19th century and used to refer to anything unusually large. The transition between hoozer and Hoosier is not clear. The first recorded instance of Hoosier meaning “Indiana resident” is dated 1826; however, it seems possible that senses of the word recorded later in the Dictionary of Americanisms, including “a big, burly, uncouth specimen or individual; a frontiersman, countryman, rustic,” reflect the kind of use this word had before it settled down in Indiana. As a nickname, Hoosier was but one of a variety of disparaging terms for the inhabitants of particular states arising in the early 19th century. Texans were called Beetheads, for example; Alabamans were Lizards; Nebraskans were Bug-eaters; South Carolinians were Weasels, and Pennsylvanians were Leatherheads. People in Missouri might have had it worst of allthey were called Pukes. Originally, these names were probably taken up by people living in neighboring states, but belittled residents adopted them in a spirit of defiant pride, much as American colonists turned the derisive term Yankee into a moniker for their spirit of rebellion. Today, most of these frontier nicknames have disappeared from the landscape. A few like Okie still exist with much of their original animus. Others survive as nicknames for the sports teams of state universitiesthe North Carolina Tarheels, the Ohio Buckeyes, and so onfighting words only on the playing field or court.\n\nWe have similar obscure terms to describe the residents of the various Australian states:\n\nOriginally posted by Buford\n\nNot exactly a personal nickname but one inspired by a driver. When Gilles Villeneuve's brother was racing in CART they called the walls \"Jacques Absorbers\".\n\nThen of course there was \"King Hiro\" Matsushita who was a moving chicane and got his name because Emmo (oops, there is another one) used to be yelling over his radio all the time complaining about him but wouldn't get the key pushed fast enough when he started his rant, so they would constantly hear, \"****king Hiro.\"\n\nOriginally posted by Buford\n\nMario Andretti among the racers was known as \"Super Wop.\" Johnny Rutherford was \"Lone Star J.R.\" Jan Opperman was \"The Racing Hippie.\" Sprint Car racer Gary Patterson was \"The Preacher.\" Steve Kinser is known as \"The King of the Outlaws\" while Richard Petty was just \"The King.\" Glenn Roberts was Fireball. I forget Tiny Lund's first name but I don't think it was Tiny. Then there was Coo Coo Marlin and I don't think his first name was originally Coo Coo. Eddie Sachs was \"The Clown Prince.\" Jim Clark was \"The Flying Scott.\" I forget Shorty Templeman's first name. Dick Rathmann was actually Jim and Jim Rathmann was actually Dick. A.J. Foyt was \"Super Tex\" but today he is \"Fatso.\""
