        "text": "Masculine given name\n\nFor other uses, see Duane (disambiguation).\n\nDuane is both a given name for a male, and a family name. The name derives from St. Dubhán, who established an abbey in Hook Head, Ireland, during the 5th century. As a surname it is O'Dubhain, or Dubhan. Dubhain was a popular given name in 16th century southern Ireland; its anglicized form is Duane.[1]\n\nIn the United States, Duane became a popular name around the 1920s and remained one of the 200 most popular names for about 50 years.[2] The spelling Dwayne was adopted as time went on, most likely because of the also popular name Wayne. Dwayne eventually became the preferred spelling, especially in the southern U.S., while Duane remains the more common spelling in northern-Midwest states such as Minnesota, Michigan, and North Dakota.[citation needed] Dwyane was once a birth certificate spelling mistake that gained popularity in the 2000s and 2010s thanks to basketball legend Dwyane Wade.[3]\n\nNotable people named Duane\n\n[edit]\n\nDuane Allen (born 1943), lead singer of The Oak Ridge Boys country and gospel quartet\n\nDuane Allen (American football) (1937–2003), American football player\n\nDuane Allman (1946–1971), American guitarist\n\nDuane Bastress (born 1983), American mixed martial artist\n\nDuane Beeson (1921–1947), American World War II fighter pilot\n\nDuane Bickett (born 1962), American football player\n\nDuane Bobick (born 1950), American boxer\n\nDuane Brown (born 1985), American football player\n\nDuane Bryers (1911–2012), American painter, illustrator and sculptor\n\nDuane R.
