        "text": "ROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) – On the morning of August 6, Vice President Kamala Harris made the announcement that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be her running mate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nKTTC spoke with leaders of both the DFL and GOP parties of Olmsted County to get their reaction of the potential for Walz to become the country’s next vice president.\n\nThe DFL’s chair, John Swanson spoke positively on the announcement, as well as what he believes are some of the governor’s positive traits.\n\n“I think it goes back to when I first heard him speak in 2006,” Swanson said. “He has an ability to connect with people and you can just listen to him for one speech, and you can connect with him and he’ s very relatable.”\n\nThe GOP chair, Wendy Phillips, spoke on the negatives of Walz being chosen, citing some areas she believes Walz has failed while in St. Paul.\n\n“He increased the size of our government by 40%, then he raised our taxes to pay for it, and I believe that Governor Walz is clearly unqualified to be the [vice] president of the United States,” Phillips said.\n\nRepublican Minnesota House Representative Duane Quam spoke on how he believes Walz’s priorities in the political landscape lineup well with Harris’s.\n\n“Six years he’s been governor, we’ve been moving towards California, you know, pushing the adoption of some of their standards and things he will fit in pretty close to Kamala and Nancy Pelosi,” Quam said.\n\nWinona State professor of political science Matthew Bosworth added how a potential reason for Minnesota’s top elected leader getting the spot on the ticket is the importance of being able to connect with voters who are in the middle of the political spectrum.\n\n“Being able to appeal to those few people out there, that are still in the middle, I think is going to be very important and Tim Waltz having been elected U.S. House member and a district that, right now, is pretty clearly Republican,” Bosworth said. “The fact that he was able to have success as a Democrat, I think that that was a pretty big selling point for him.”\n\nIf the Harris-Walz ticket is successful, Walz would become the state’s third vice president, joining Walter Mondale under President Jimmy Carter and Hubert H. Humphrey under Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nFind stories like this and more, in our apps."
