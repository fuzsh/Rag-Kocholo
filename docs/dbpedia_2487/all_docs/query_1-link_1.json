        "text": "Carter (name)PronunciationOriginLanguage(s)Latin, GaelicMeaning\"transport goods by cart\"Region of originIreland, Scotland, EnglandOther namesVariant form(s)McCarter MacArthur McArthur McCarthy CartyFrequency Comparisons:[1]\n\nCarter is a family name, and also may be a given name. Carter is of Irish, Scottish and English origin and is an occupational name given to one who transports goods by cart or wagon ultimately of Celtic derivation. It may also appear as an English reduced form of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic derived McCarter or the Scottish-Gaelic Mac Artair with Mc meaning \"son of.\" Its appearance and pronunciation as Carter may also be the Anglicized form of the Irish Mac Artúir, Cuirtéir, or Ó Cuirtéir.[2][3] The name is related to the Gaelic word cairt meaning cart, and ultimately from the Latin carettarius. Additionally, in Gaelic, the word \"cairtear\", which means tourist or sojourner, is also related. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1100s Roman Catholic English derived Carter's also arrived in Ireland and settled into walled towns established by the Normans. These Anglo-Normans assimilated into Irish culture, adopting Irish Gaelic customs, language, and religion unlike later English and Scottish Protestant planter settlers in Ireland who arrived between the 1550s and 1700 and mainly settled in Ulster during the plantation of Ulster, establishing the Ulster Protestant community.[4]\n\nIt is the 44th most common surname in the United States and 56th most common in England. In Ireland it is ranked between McGarry and Cannon where it is found with greatest frequency in County Laois as the 70th most common surname, and 274th in Scotland where it is found with greatest frequency in the Outer Hebrides as the 140th most common surname.[5]\n\nPeople of European heritage bearing this surname may trace their ancestors back to Ireland, England or Scotland. Within the past 150 years, the Carter surname has been adopted widely by African Americans as taken from slavemasters by former slaves upon the Emancipation and 13th Amendment, through mixing with those masters (who were typically of English or Scottish descent), or through the common mixing found between Irish immigrants and free African Americans in Northern cities and communities such as Five Points and Seneca Village in New York City and elsewhere in the United States.[6] This name is common among African Americans capable of tracing their roots back to the southern United States or Caribbean from the early 20th century onward, with some 35% of name holders of Carter in the United States being of African-American descent and it being the 22nd most common surname for Black Americans.\n\nPeople with the surname\n\n[edit]\n\nA\n\n[edit]\n\nAaron Carter (1987–2022), American musician\n\nAd Carter (1895–1957), American comic strip cartoonist\n\nAdam Carter (footballer) (born 1994), Australian rules footballer from Western Australia\n\nAdrian Carter (born 1959), British architect\n\nAimee Carter (born 1986), American writer\n\nAl Carter, (born 1952), American journalist\n\nAlan Carter (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nAlbert Carter (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nAlex Carter (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nAlfred Williams Carter (1894–1986), Canadian flying ace\n\nAli Carter (born 1979), English professional snooker player\n\nAllen 'Big Al' Carter (1947–2008), American artist\n\nAlly Carter (born 1974), American author\n\nAmanda Carter (born 1964), Australian Paralympic basketball player\n\nAmon G.
