Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he was a devoted husband to Antoinette (Toni) and a loving father to Mandy and Katie.\n\nDuane was predeceased by his parents, Goldie and John Paul Eaton and his sister, Joan Carter. He is survived by Toni, his wife of 41 years, daughters Mandy Eaton and Katie Shaffer (Mike), and sister Janet Fox, as well as many friends and extended family members who will miss him dearly. Duane will be remembered with great love for his sense of humor and generosity.\n\nDuane was raised in Towson, Maryland and graduated from Towson State College. He had a 41 year career as an association executive, including 34 years at Produce Marketing Association, from which he retired in 2014. He volunteered for many organizations such as the Newark Jaycees, the Grand Opera House in Wilmington, and Meals on Wheels. He was awarded a Jefferson Award for his volunteer work with the Ronald McDonald House of Delaware, which spanned over 10 years. He was a leader for Ulster Project Delaware in 2001, a cause close to his heart. Some of his favorite things included day trips with his sweetheart, traveling, enjoying the outdoors, the Baltimore Orioles, games, and family time.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to pay their respects at the Doherty Funeral Home, 3200 Limestone Road, Pike Creek on Saturday, July 13 from 9:00 – 11:00AM. A Remembrance Service in honor of Duane will begin at 11:00AM.
