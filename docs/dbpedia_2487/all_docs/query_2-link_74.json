        "text": "The Carter Family Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charity founded in 2019 by Duane and Lynn Carter. The original purpose of the Foundation was to establish a legacy of generosity and Christian charity in the Carter family ~ but God had much bigger plans! He has placed a burning desire on the Carters’ hearts to do more for His Kingdom. In response, the family is working to expand the reach of the Foundation by developing partnerships, recruiting ambassadors and intentionally raising funds for targeted mission fields.\n\n100% of all charitable donations are distributed to the mission field. All corporate officers, directors and ambassadors of the Foundation serve on a voluntary basis. We have no paid staff. Each adult member of the Carter family contributes annually to the Foundation’s operating budget to cover expenses.\n\nL.I.G.H.T. guides our conduct and relationships, and defines us as an organization.\n\nWhen put into action, these five guiding principles combine to create a Christlike\n\nculture that advances our vision and mission."
