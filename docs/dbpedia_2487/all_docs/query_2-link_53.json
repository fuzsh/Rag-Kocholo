        "text": "\"Amazing service, I had an abscess and needed an emergency consultation. I was talking with someone (Annie) from the service team the whole time who helped me to book a consultation. The doctor i had booked with wasnt available for the issue i had but this was quickly resolved, Annie arranged for a different doctor to see me within 15 minutes. I Had the issue resolved within an hour. The service is great and they are very helpful I would highly recommend them to anyone who requires a consultation!\"\n\n\"I would use Dr. Galen again. It was an efficient and cost effective way to get care abroad from the comfort of my hotel room. I would use them again if a situation arose where I needed non-emergent care quickly!\"\n\n\"I think Dr. Galen is a good company as far as telemedicine is concerned. There is efficiency in contacting the patient, coordinating with the physician, especially concerning appointments and a high level of responsiveness and efficiency. I recommended it to any fellow physician who wants to use telemedicine in his/her practice.\"\n\n\"I needed a prescription for a medication and successfully got it in a short time by a qualified doctor after providing medical documents from other country. Recommend this platform for everybody.\"\n\n\"Excellent speedy service. I needed to urgently speak to a doctor and had a video call within 2 hours of my request. I then had a prescription sent over right Way. Communication through out was brilliant. Thanks\""
