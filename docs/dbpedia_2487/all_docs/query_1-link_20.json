        "text": "History of National Carter Day\n\nCarter is one of those names that originated as a surname or family name but later became a favorite choice for parents when naming their newborn babies, predominantly sons. It is considered a gender-neutral English name that means carrier of commodities. Thanks to U.S. President Jimmy Carter, the English occupational surname first gained popularity in the 1970s. It is also associated with flash and elegance, as it sits opposite its French luxury sibling, Cartier. Carter is a charming name with historical and cultural significance.\n\nThe name is of Irish, Scottish, and English origin, and an Irish reduced form of the name McCarter meaning son of and its appearance and pronunciation as Carter being the Anglicized form of the Irish Mac Artir. The name comes from the Gaelic word ‘cairt,’ which means ‘cart,’ and then from the Latin ‘carettarius.’ Furthermore, the word ‘cairtear,’ meaning tourist or sojourner in Gaelic, is related.\n\nPeople of European ancestry with this surname may have ancestors from Ireland, England, or Scotland. Over the last 150 years, the Carter surname has been widely adopted by African Americans who were taken from slave-masters by formerly enslaved people after emancipation and the 13 Amendment or through the standard mixing of Irish immigrants and free African Americans. It is the 44 most common surname in the United States, the 56 most common in England, the 428 most common in Ireland, where it is the 70 most common surname in County Laois, and the 274 most common in Scotland."
