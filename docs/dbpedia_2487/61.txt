Born Duane Martin Carter in Chicago, Illinois on December 10, 1954, Duane grew up in Southern California after moving with his family to Los Angeles in 1961. He attended Locke High School, which was a fertile breeding ground for local talent. His peers included Patrice Rushen, Gerald Albright, Gary Bias, and Leon "Ndugu" Chancler.[1]

Duane freelanced and led his own groups around the L.A. area. He earned a B.A. in music performance from California State University, Los Angeles.[2] Duane went on to become a featured soloist, composer and arranger while serving in the U.S. Army Band.[3]

While in Los Angeles Duane studied with jazz greats Bobby Bryant (musician), and Oscar Brashear.[4] He received a M.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies for Music, Theatre and English, and has written for musical theater.[5] He began writing poetry and short stories while in middle school. He combined his two passions first in songwriting and more recently in the creation of the musical Forever Yours.

As a writer Duane has been the featured poet with the Austin Poet Society. He performs regularly with his own band, but has also performed with many other groups as well including: Groove Daddy, The Creative Arts Ensemble, Tibor Molnar's Sevensemble, Nate Morgan's Ujaama Ensemble, the Nightfire Orchestra, Pro2Call, and the J-Love Band.[1] Duane has also become involved in the world of independent films. His film credits include acting, producing, composing as well as writing and directing his own short film Triad.
