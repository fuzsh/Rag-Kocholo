        "text": "Collector's Edition Blu-ray Review\n\nWritten by\n\nBlu-ray released by Scream Factory\n\nWritten and directed by Clive Barker\n\n1995, Region A, 121 minutes, Not Rated\n\nBlu-ray released on December 16th, 2014\n\nStarring:\n\nScott Bakula as Harry D'Amour\n\nKevin J. O'Connor as Philip Swann\n\nFamke Janssen as Dorothea\n\nJoel Swetow as Valentin\n\nBarry Del Sherman as Butterfield\n\nDaniel von Bargen as Nix\n\nVincent Schiavelli as Vinovich\n\nWayne Grace as Loomis\n\nJoseph Latimore as Quaid\n\nSheila Tousey as Jennifer Desiderio\n\nReview:\n\nVideo and Audio:\n\nBoth the theatrical and director's cut are presented in the original 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The picture is fairly sharp on each with strong colors, deep blacks and natural-looking flesh tones throughout, but there are instances of dirt and print damage. This is particularly disappointing given the impressive treatment of older films with lower budgets than this. That being said, this is easily the best the movie has looked and is quite a step up from all previous releases.\n\nBoth cuts offer a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track and a DTS-HD MA 2.0 mix that preserve the original stereo presentation. The film obviously benefits from the expanded 5.1 option, as music and effects are given the chance to fill the room, particularly during the final act.\n\nEnglish subtitles are provided for anyone in need.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nScream Factory's Lord of Illusions Collector's Edition offers two cuts of the film, each on their own Blu-ray disc.\n\nThe first disc presents the edited theatrical version (108 minutes), paired with the original trailer. It is nice to finally have both cuts in HD, but there is little reason to revisit this disc once you see the work as Barker intended.\n\nThe director's cut (121 minutes) receives a more thoughtful set of supplements, beginning with a note from Clive Barker expressing his appreciation for having the extended version of his film available on this edition.\n\nReturning from the earliest Laser Disc release (1995) is an engaging audio commentary with Barker that is definitely worth checking out. The track is very informative, and longtime fans will cherish hearing the youthful strength in the director's voice as he shares his thoughts on the material, though he is prone to mixing his insight with simply narrating onscreen action.\n\nA Gathering of Magic (18 minutes) is a vintage featurette that offers a glimpse at the making of the film through on-set production footage paired with cast and crew interviews. Everyone is typically fawning, but it is encouraging to hear so many praise Barker's imagination.\n\nA more impressive collection of behind-the-scenes footage that was shot in 1994 appears in the rarely seen The Illusion of Reality (62 minutes), a documentary that anyone with an interest in how films are made will want to check out, as there is quite a bit of “fly on the wall” material here. This long-form piece follows the day-to-day process and offers a look at everything from Barker's directing process to the special make-up effects guys at work to camera blocking and cast rehearsals, which are presented in a split screen with finished film footage.\n\nA collection of deleted scenes (3 minutes) are presented in 1.33.1 full frame with Barker's commentary, as the audio remains unfinished. The content offers a small number of inconsequential moments that were wisely trimmed from the end product, primarily for pacing.\n\nStoryboard artist Martin Mercer shares his memories of working with Barker in the newly recorded interview Drawing Boards (12 minutes). It includes a side-by-side comparison of his work with the finished film.\n\nA photo gallery slideshow runs 16 minutes and is set to selections from Simon Boswell's score. There are character images that showcase different wardrobes and make-up as well as traditional stills from the film, promotional photos and a look at the various poster art campaigns."
