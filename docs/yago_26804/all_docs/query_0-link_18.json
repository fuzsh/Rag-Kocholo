        "text": "Bryan and Joe return to Clive Barker territory to discuss a magical (or illusory?) double bill.\n\nFirst up is ‘The Last Illusion’, the 1985 short from Books of Blood Vol. 6 that introduces private investigator Harry D’Amour. Bryan likes the creatures, particularly Valentin, though Joe finds the plot meandering.\n\nNext up is Barker’s 1995 film adaptation Lord of Illusions, which is both ambitious and feels like Barker succumbing to Hollywood demands. Joe is nostalgic for its messy queerness and prefers the Director’s Cut, while Bryan finds it busy and notes that characters lack agency.\n\nListen on Apple Podcasts / Listen on Spotify\n\nWanna connect with the show?\n\nBryan: @eviltaylorhicks\n\nJoe: @bstolemyremote\n\nMusic Credit: Hellraiser Theme by Christopher Young\n\nIf you like the podcast, please rate, review, and subscribe!"
