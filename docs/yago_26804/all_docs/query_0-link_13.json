        "text": "You've hit the nail on the head. Like most cult leaders (e.g. those without magical powers) he's become obsessed with his own publicity and has started to buy into his own lies about being able to create an apocalypse merely by thinking about it.\n\nAlthough he does possess genuine magical powers, the reality is that the majority of those powers (and the things he accomplished with them, such as murdering his followers) border on feats that could be accomplished by anyone, irrespective of magical ability.\n\nBarker (on his own website) described Nix thusly;\n\n\"One of the things I wanted to do with Nix was to make him very uncharismatic. There is nothing appealing about this man and, towards the end of the movie, when the temptation would be to go into apocalyptic mode, the movie pulls in exactly the opposite direction. Nix becomes this frail, rather pathetic creature. In one of the final scenes, Dorothea asks the metaphysical question, \"What are you?\" and Nix says, \"I'm a man who wanted to be a god and changed his mind.\" And I like that. I like the fact that he is just a man. He wanted to be something more but he gave up on this useless endeavour. He's murdered all his acolytes, his devotees, and now he's alone in the dark. I actively went after that, even though it was flying in the face of what the audience expects.\"\n\nClive Barker - Lord Of Illusions By Nigel Lloyd, SFX, No 16, September 1996\n\nI think him creating a sun and storm out of thin air was pretty impressive and the quicksand that killed his followers.\n\nI think these feats were a taste of his power but after he saw he had nothing left he just gave up his dream 9f becoming a god, he had been to the other side, returned, saw how all flesh just rots and saw his dream as silly and futile."
