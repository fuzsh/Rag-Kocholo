        "text": "Spanning items dating from 1986 to 2023, the earliest here is an August ’86 sketch that Clive drew inside a copy of the US first edition of The Inhuman Condition. Other titles here by Clive include new US editions of Weaveworld and The Damnation Game, as well as the Hulu tie-in cover for Book of Blood volume 1.\n\nLarge glossy books include Sideshow’s Fine Art Prints, Volume 1 from 2020 (with the Hell Priestess by Ian MacDonald inside) and Rick Jones’s 2022 Portraits of Horror, which has a wealth of horror portrait photography. These sit alongside Howard Berger and Marshall Julius’s glorious Masters of Make-Up Effects from 2022, which draws back the curtain on a myriad of legends from big screen and small.\n\nClive noted in the 2012 art book by Chet Zar (who contributed a wonderful afterword to Imaginer volume 3) that his “extraordinary paintings open an elevator shaft that delivers us down into a world of the purest mystery and dread”.\n\nIn the back row are the 1999 Italian edition of Revelations (with Clive’s Chiliad), Phantasmagoria Press’s 2022 tribute to Fantasy Tales and we’ve happily laid hands on a copy of The Pandoric Maker’s Magnum Opus – with thanks to Eric Gross. Darkside Books in Brazil continues its fabulous run of hardback editions of The Books of Blood with this third volume from 2022 – with the other three scheduled to follow.\n\nThere are DVDs and Blu-rays of Candyman and Candyman 2 from France, Candyman and Hellraiser together (France), Nia DaCosta’s Candyman (France, and a UK steelbook), Hellraiser: Inferno (Japan), and Lord of Illusions and Cabal (Nightbreed) both from Germany.\n\nClive’s poetry is featured in Multiverses (2023), Out Of The Ruins (2021) and Sorbet Magazine (2019) while other people’s poetry is in the 2015 French edition of Now We Are Sick from Neil Gaiman and Stephen Jones. Peter Atkins features twice in the pile of books – with a copy of his new All Our Hearts Are Ghosts short story collection that he handed to us over a wonderful lunch together in Los Angeles earlier this year, alongside his Hellraiser: Bloodline screenplay from Encyclopocalypse (2022). Hellraiser: Hell On Earth is represented by Danny Stewart’s 2021 making of book, War Is Hell.\n\nIn magazines, Hellraiser has had a swathe of recent coverage and Undying is also represented here on the cover of Italy’s Games Machine from 2001. Clive’s artwork is featured inside Hi-Fructose along with an interview we did for our 2022 release of Clive Barker’s Dark Worlds.\n\nEphemera includes (with thanks to Paul Doble) Weaveworld in a 1988 World Books Review, a flyer for a 1994 signing at Forbidden Planet in London, and a Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights II flyer from 1998 featuring Clive’s Freakz maze. The German Candyman flyer was for press preview screenings in 1992. The Hulu Books of Blood image was used by Mad Movies in France in 2020 and there are two film festival brochures – for Clive introducing The Director’s Cut of Nightbreed at Outfest 40 in Los Angeles in 2022 and for our on-stage introductions of both Hellraiser and the Director’s Cut of Nightbreed at the BFI Southbank in London in 2022 in the In Dreams Are Monsters season.\n\nMore to follow!\n\nForeign editions of movies include recent releases of Nightbreed and Lord of Illusions in France as well as older VHS releases of Hellraiser III and Candyman from Hong Kong and South Korea respectively.\n\nGuy Astic, who also appears in the French Lord of Illusions Blu-ray extras, has two books of essays on horror, featuring Kirsty and the Chatterer on the cover of volume one.\n\nAmongst the magazine format publications come two career overviews of Clive’s work - in the French Mad Movies and the Italian Nocturno - while Candyman features in HorrorHound and Shock Horror. Lire magazine in France interviews Clive whilst Darkside Books continue publishing beautiful editions of Clive’s titles with The Forbidden and the first Books of Blood volume from Brazil.\n\nScared Sacred is a collection of essays on religion in horror films published by House of Leaves Publishing and sports a foreword by Doug Bradley.\n\nA couple of photos from the August 1995 Los Angeles premiere of Lord of Illusions sit alongside one of the October 1986 cast of the London production of The Secret Life of Cartoons.\n\nDaniele Serra’s new art book has an introduction by Clive and, at the back, Cemetery Dance’s lettered The Damnation Game is an impressive new edition.\n\nThe print at the back of Exiled Mummy is one of more than 25 available now in Clive’s Threadless store at https://clivebarker.threadless.com/ along with shirts, mugs and more…\n\nIt’s been a quiet year in publications from us and Clive but we have our collective heads buried in a number of projects that we’re looking forward to having more news on in coming months!\n\nWith Spring sunshine tinting London with its energy, the Archive is all set for new projects over the next few months. As we take stock of recent acquisitions, we realise it’s over a year since we shared some of the things that have been added to the shelves here, so there’s much to catch up on!\n\nThe handsome Beardless Warriors / Brothers in Arms set arrived on our doorstep from Gauntlet Press just this week, bearing Clive’s cover art on the second volume, and over past months we’ve seen an ever increasing number of publishers with local language editions of the Shining in the Dark anthology, containing Pidgin and Theresa. Cemetery Dance also produced a chapbook of artwork by Erin S. Wells, inspired by the stories of the anthology.\n\nNon-fiction additions include Jon Towlson’s take on Candyman (including an interview with Bernard Rose), ESC / Bragelonne’s Hellbound Heart translation which includes an interview between Clive and Pete Atkins and accompanied its release of Hellraisers 1-3 on Blu-Ray, and Manchester University Press offers a collection of pieces focussed on various aspects of Clive’s work edited by Sorcha Ní Fhlainn.\n\nBut it’s often some of the older, ephemeral things that become uncovered - often with thanks to friends of the Archive - that are most unusual: as Hellraiser debuted on VHS rental in 1988, New World produced a promotional standee featuring the box office data from The Hollywood Reporter on the back; and a set of Murray Close’s black and white contact sheets for Hellbound has happily found its way to the Archive some thirty years after they were created.\n\nPromo VHSs for Gods and Monsters and Lord of Illusions sit next to a much more recent DVD release of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which features Clive’s art on the walls of the Academy of Unseen Arts throughout, and the new Blu-ray release of Candyman.\n\nOf course, Clive’s own notes and working papers form the backbone of the Archive and his manuscript of Heaven’s Reply and a hand-amended Tortured Souls screenplay are new additions.\n\nThe growing complexity of the Abarat plot demanded that, whilst writing the third volume, Clive kept a firm track of characters and places by creating a pinboard of index cards, each one devoted to a plot point - these two cards were recently rescued from a water-damaged storage area deep under his library. Once dried off, they could be safely added to others in the Abarat papers, together with the proofreader’s marked up pages for Absolute Midnight.\n\nMore news on upcoming projects to follow!\n\nFirst up, the fabulous original art for the cover of one of the first run Nightbreed comics (issue #12). Painted by John Rheaume, this representation of Rawhead Rex has superb attention to detail. This photo doesn't do justice to Matt Ryan Tobin's stunning art, shown here on the Arrow Hellraiser steelbook and Christopher Young's soundtrack on vinyl (it's also on a glorious Mondo poster which is currently heading to the framers!)\n\nOther movies here - a Spanish language VHS of Lord of Illusions is new to us and the new Kino Lorber Rawhead Rex Blu-ray was released last month. The Art of Horror Movies is Stephen Jones's latest offering from Applause - a fascinating walk through poster and press art from around the world (including work for Hellraiser sequels, Nightbreed, Lord of Illusions and Quicksilver Highway). Hugely insightful and definitely recommended.\n\nThanks to Cemetery Dance for advance copies of Detours (contains A Night's Work) and Reading Stephen King (with Clive's 2007 speech to the Canadian Booksellers Association), and to Steve Dillon for the Hellraiser-inspired Empath's Tale collection. Earthling Publications' beautiful lettered edition of The Scarlet Gospels is a great addition to its suite of CB publications.\n\nLast, but not least, we love this Candyman figure! Sculpted in polymer clay, Clay Disarray produced this figure as a one-off to create a photographic poster for the movie and we're delighted to give it a home in the archive. (There's also a Clay Disarray Pinhead out there somewhere..!)\n\nA quick reminder that we're turning around orders for the new Clive Barker Playscripts within 24 hours, so there's still time to get copies for you or your very best friends for Christmas!\n\nRecently, we've been working through lots of new manuscripts and notes for projects both published and unpublished - it's like constructing a multi-dimensional jigsaw as we place work thematically and chronologically, often sheet by sheet. As the collections come together we're then able to make them available in different ways.\n\nSome of the recent requests to share material in publications have come from:\n\nArrow Films (The Scarlet Box - Hellraiser Blu-ray set)\n\nThe British Library (Horror: A Literary History)\n\nGauntlet Press (The Great and Secret Show, Everville, forthcoming)\n\nSeraphim Ink (The Thief of Always anniversary edition)\n\nFiddleblack (The Last Illusion)\n\nDark Regions Press (The Body Book)\n\n...with a few more waiting in the wings...\n\nAnd next up from us will be our book on the making of Hellraiser, the Imaginer art volumes and a series of Clive's plays. More news to follow!"
