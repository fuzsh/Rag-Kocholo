In this post I will show you some of the production shots I took while I was working on this project. It's my practice to document my work...

My photographs can't do it justice, but you should be able... Continue Reading →\n\nDigging around in my drives I came across this piece from the mid-90s. It was one of a number of images that I created for a collectible card game (CCG) based on Clive Barker's novel Imajica.
