        "meta_description": "This chapter focuses on Clive Barker's Tortured Souls and Mister B. Gone, which shows a sustained engagement with the body and continues to escape the boundaries of classic horror to form its own elaborate mythologies. The Cenobites, characters who straddle the line between the torturer and the tortured, are possibly Barker's most famous creation; their stories have developed over ten films and an equally impressive number of comics. Like Hellraiser, Tortured Souls proposes a new carnal mythology introducing a pantheon of transmogrified superhumans. Mister B. Gone opens with a three-word exhortation: 'Burn this book'. The experience of reading Mister B. Gone is framed around finding out more about terrific deeds and losing one's mind in the process. Mister B. Gone is more than a straightforward horror novel chronicling the life of a fictional demonic memory.",
