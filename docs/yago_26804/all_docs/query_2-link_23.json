(part two)\n\nRead Part One The mid-1980s saw a change in Herbert's work, of which Moon (1985) although it contains many similar elements to The Jonah, is the first example. The hero of this transitional novel in Herbert's oeuvre has a \"softer\" name than his usual heroes - Childes - which reflects his vulnerability. He's a teacher … Continue reading Horror Rewind special: James Herbert! (part two)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHorror rewind #7 – ‘Skeleton Crew’ magazine, July 1990\n\nBooks last. Okay, some books last. Some books are hailed upon publication and instantly attain 'classic' status; the reputation of others grows only slowly; still others appear and just as quickly vanish. Reputations, too. In the 'Horror Rewind' series I've looked at a selection of horror fiction from the 70s and 80s to examine how … Continue reading Horror rewind #7 – ‘Skeleton Crew’ magazine, July 1990\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n‘Clive Barker’s Dark Worlds’\n\nOh, this is luscious. Produced by Phil and Sarah Stokes, the forces behind Clive Barker's official website, this huge book (350+ pages) is copiously illustrated with cover artwork, behind-the-scenes photos from the likes of Hellraiser and Nightbreed, rare promo materials and Barker's own sketches and paintings.

Winter) (1988)\n\nOr should that be \"Anti-Horror Rewind\"? American lawyer Douglas E. Winter made his literary name with one of the first book-length studies of Stephen King's work (The Art of Darkness), and in 2001 wrote the authorised biography of Clive Barker (The Dark Fantastic). In between, he edited (although curated may be a more appropriate term) … Continue reading Horror Rewind #4 – “Prime Evil” (ed. Douglas E.

For Scovell, Folk Horror can - among other things - be categorised as \"a work that uses folklore…to imbue itself with a sense of the arcane for … Continue reading The Folk Horror Chain in Clive Barker’s “Books of Blood”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHorror Rewind #1 – Mark Morris’s “Toady” (1989)\n\nWelcome to the first in an occasional series of retrospective looks at 80s & early 90s horror.
