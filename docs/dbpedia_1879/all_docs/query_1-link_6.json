        "text": "Andrew Sterrett was a scholar, decorated World War II veteran and a mathematician.\n\nBut the former mathematics professor at Denison University, who died Saturday at age 97, was more than that, those who loved him say.\n\n\"He was a very welcoming father,\" said son Richard Sterrett. The group (at Middleton Senior Living, where he lived) would refer to him as very generous and that he never met a person that he wasn’t interested in working with and listening to.\n\nThe elder Sterrett served in France with the U.S. Army's 44th Infantry Division until he was severely wounded in combat. Sterrett lost his arm on Nov. 5, 1944, when a German artillery shell exploded near him while on the frontlines near Luneville, France. He was awarded the Purple Heart and France's highest honor: The Legion d’ Honneur (Legion of Honor), for his valor and sacrifice in France during the war.\n\n“It was something that had to be done,” he told The Newark Advocate in 2016.\n\nSterrett used that experience to find his passion.\n\n\"He came back to the states and he concluded that because after he had been through rehab and learned how to tie his shoes and even play golf one-armed (he had more to give),\" his son said. \"He then decided that since he had one arm, he needed to be a teacher. ... Because he had a good right arm and he could get up to a chalkboard and write.\n\n\"As he put it, ‘Emphasize what you can do instead of focusing on what you can’t do anymore,'\" said Kevin Bennett, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who drafted the application for Andrew to receive the French award in 2016.\n\nThe National Veterans Memorial and Museum put out a statement: \"We join Andrew Sterrett’s family in mourning their loss and celebrating the life of a true hero. His life was marked by resilience and determination to help others.\"\n\nAfter his return to the United States, Andrew pursued a bachelor's degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh before earning his doctorate in mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh native then pursued teaching mathematics at Ohio University in Athens before coming to Denison in 1953 – where he would hold numerous positions until retirement in 2000.\n\nIt was during all those years that Andrew or \"Andy\" as most knew him, would build relationships with colleagues and students that would last a lifetime. He authored books on math, taught as a visiting scholar at Stanford University and University of California-Berkley before spending his last five years at Middleton Senior Living.\n\n\"I would go with him to these luncheons (at Denison each year) that they would have and it didn’t take long for former students to come up and say, ‘Oh Dr. Sterrett, how are you?’,\" Richard Sterrett said. \"So he was a college professor that students remembered – you may have had some of those, but not too many.\"\n\nA golfer and avid cards player, despite his physical disadvantages – Sterrett was a \"gentle warrior\", Bennett said.\n\n\"He was very unassuming. You quickly picked up this (that) was a gentle and kind soul. Which kind of conflicted with being a warrior or being decorated for military service, (but) that’s what he was,\" said Bennett, a Granville Township trustee. \"I was more than happy to make it known through the proper authorities and put together an application for his being awarded for the Legion of Honor. I was very gratified to see him get it because he shed his blood to liberate France from the Nazi occupation (and) I was glad they saw it that way too.\"\n\nA private graveside service is scheduled for Thursday at College Cemetery at Denison University where military honors will be rendered by the Licking County Veterans Alliance. A public reception will be held at 2 p.m. that day at Whit’s, 138 E. Broadway in Granville.\n\nSurviving are his son, Richard; daughter, Susan; stepchildren, Kauko (Judith) Aro, Ilkka Aro, Pirkko (James) McBride; seven grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Andrew was preceded in death by Betty Baur Sterrett, his first wife of 43 years, and Kaarina Baker Sterrett, his second wife of 22 years.\n\nJDandron@dispatch.com\n\n@JosephDandronMI"
