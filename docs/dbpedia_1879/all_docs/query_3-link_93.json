        "text": "Petty Officer 3rd Class Taylor Todd, a native of Santa Clarita, California, serves the U.S. Navy assigned to USS Sterett.\n\nTodd graduated from Hart High School in 2015.\n\nThe skills and values needed to succeed in the Navy are similar to those found in Santa Clarita.\n\n“Working blue-collar jobs before the Navy taught me a lot about taking responsibility and ownership,” said Todd. “Having built those habits before enlisting has helped me develop my leadership skills and pass on those keys to success to my shipmates.”\n\nTodd joined the Navy two years ago. Today, Todd serves as a damage controlman.\n\n“I joined the Navy to do my part in serving a country that had given me so much growing up,” said Todd. “I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself and help others.”\n\nUSS Sterett is the fourth ship of the U.S. Navy to be named after Andrew Sterett, a U.S. naval officer who fought in the Quasi-War and the Barbary Wars.\n\nAccording to Navy officials, a guided-missile destroyer is a multi-mission ship that can operate independently or as part of a larger group of ships at sea. The ship is equipped with tomahawk missiles, torpedoes, guns and a phalanx close-in weapons system.\n\nWith 90 percent of global commerce traveling by sea and access to the internet relying on the security of undersea fiber optic cables, Navy officials continue to emphasize that the prosperity of the United States is directly linked to recruiting and retaining talented people from across the rich fabric of America.\n\nTodd serves a Navy that operates far forward, around the world and around the clock, promoting the Nation’s prosperity and security.\n\n“We will earn and reinforce the trust and confidence of the American People every day,” said Admiral Lisa Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations. “Together we will deliver the Navy the Nation needs.”\n\nTodd has many opportunities to achieve accomplishments during military service.\n\n“My proudest accomplishment in the Navy is earning my Enlisted Surface Warfare qualification while on deployment,” said Todd. “I am also proud of my community relations trip I participated in, while we were in Singapore, where we helped clean a halfway home with the residents helping them transition back into society.”\n\nTodd can take pride in serving America through military service.\n\nServing the Navy means to me that I strive to be 1% better than I was the day before,” said Todd. “I’m always trying to find a way to grow myself and others. Serving the Navy allows me to be a part of a team that no matter the cost would be there to fight and win.”\n\nEd.
