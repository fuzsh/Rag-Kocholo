Focusing on the federal historic tax credit industry, I demonstrate how new ways to own property intersected with post-crisis financial regulations meant to limit banks’ reach into financial markets to ignite large-scale redevelopment projects in the urban core of many US cities. Banks increasingly switched their focus from ‘cash flows’ to extracting tax-benefits from these buildings. By positioning tax credits as a source of financial accumulation, this talk draws attention to the strategies and tactics that investors use to construct their investment portfolio, create liquidity in the built environment, and enrich their shareholders and executives with taxpayer-subsidized investments.\n\nWednesday, November 13, 12:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Sondheim 001\n\nGES 701 Faculty Panel –
