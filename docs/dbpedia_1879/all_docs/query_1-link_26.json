During the Quasi-War with France, he was still serving in Constellation when she captured L'lnsurgente. By 1800, he had risen to First Lieutenant; and he participated in Constellation's action against La Vengeance. Given command of the schooner, Enterprise, Lt. Sterett led her in the capture of the French privateer, V'Amour de la Patrie, on Christmas Eve 1800. In June 1801, he sailed in Enterprise from Baltimore for service with the Mediterranean Squadron. While on that cruise, Enterprise engaged and captured a 14-gun Tripolitan cruiser and her 80-man crew. In gratitude, Congress awarded Sterett a sword and highly commended his crew. Lt. Sterett continued his Navy career until he resigned his commission in 1805. He died on 9 June 1807, at Lima, Peru.Bill Gonyo USS Sterett (DD-407)\n\n57kUndated wartime view, date and location unknown.- 544kLaunching of USS Sterett (DD-407) at Charleston Navy Yard, South Carolina, 27 October 1938.\n\nNational Archives photo 80-G-8862Fred Weiss 170kUSS Sterett (DD-407) fitting out at Charleston Navy Yard, 03 April 1939.
