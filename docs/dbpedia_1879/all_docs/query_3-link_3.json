        "text": "PrC (DLC); in ink at foot of text: âLieutt. Sterrett.â\n\nA scion of a prominent family of Baltimore merchants and Federalists, Andrew Sterett (1778â1807) received a lieutenantâs commission in the U.S. Navy in March 1798. After seeing extensive service on board the frigates Constellation and President, Sterett was given command of the schooner Enterprize in October 1800. On 1 Aug. 1801, Sterettâs vessel defeated the corsair Tripoli after a three-hour battle near Malta in the Mediterranean, the first American victory in the Barbary War. Sterett and the Enterprize returned to Baltimore in November 1801, then sailed for the Mediterranean again in early 1802. He remained in the navy until 1805, when he resigned after a dispute over rank. He died in Peru shortly thereafter while on a merchant voyage to Latin America (ANB description begins John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes, eds., American National Biography, New York and Oxford, 1999, 24 vols. description ends ; Vol. 35:588â9)."
