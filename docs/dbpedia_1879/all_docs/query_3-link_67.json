        "text": "Product Type: Coin\n\nSize: 1 3/4 inch (44mm) Round\n\nMaterial: Bronze with Enamel\n\nThe USS Sterett (DDG-104) holds an important place in defending American interests and protecting freedom across the globe. As an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer for the U.S. Navy, she is impressively equipped to succeed in even the most demanding of missions. The USS Sterett is named after Lieutenant Andrew Sterett, an American naval hero who commanded the USS Enterprise during the Quasi-War with France and the Barbary Wars.\n\nCommissioned on 9 August 2008, the USS Sterett has a displacement of approximately 9,200 long tons and stretches some 509 feet in length. Armed with naval guns and anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine missiles, plus other weapons, she is equipped for surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and anti-submarine warfare. She also is the home for two SH-60 Seahawk helicopters.\n\nThis coin is minted in bronze, with highlights burnished for a proof-like effect, and pays tribute to the USS Sterett, saluting the exceptional service of her crew. The obverse contains a montage of the ship’s namesake, Andrew Sterett, with a portside view of the USS Sterett cutting through the water and the ship’s motto, “Forever Dauntless.” The reverse displays the shield and crest of the USS Sterett, imbued in bold colored enamel.\n\n™ Department of the Navy.
