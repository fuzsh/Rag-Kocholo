The list is in chronological order.\n\nBelknap Class Destroyer Leader\n\nKeel Laid 25 September 1962 - Launched 30 June 1964\n\nUSS STERETT DLG-31\n\nCommissioned 8 April 1967\n\nUSS STERETT CG-31\n\nReclassified Guided Missile Cruiser 30 June 1975\n\nDecommissioned 24 March 1994\n\nStricken 24 March 1994 - Scrapped 30 November 2006\n\nNaval Covers\n\nThis section lists active links to the pages displaying covers associated with the ship. There should be a separate set of pages for each incarnation of the ship (ie, for each entry in the \"Ship Name and Designation History\" section). Covers should be presented in chronological order (or as best as can be determined).\n\nSince a ship may have many covers, they may be split among many pages so it doesn't take forever for the pages to load. Each page link should be accompanied by a date range for covers on that page.\n\nUSS Sterett DLG-31 / CG-31 Covers Page 1 (1967-1978)\n\nPostmarks\n\nThis section lists examples of the postmarks used by the ship. There should be a separate set of postmarks for each incarnation of the ship (ie, for each entry in the \"Ship Name and Designation History\" section). Within each set, the postmarks should be listed in order of their classification type. If more than one postmark has the same classification, then they should be further sorted by date of earliest known usage.\n\nA postmark should not be included unless accompanied by a close-up image and/or an image of a cover showing that postmark. Date ranges MUST be based ONLY ON COVERS IN THE MUSEUM and are expected to change as more covers are added.\n\n>>> If you have a better example for any of the postmarks, please feel free to replace the existing example.\n\nPostmark Type\n\n---\n\nKiller Bar Text\n\nPostmark\n\nDate Thumbnail Link\n\nTo\n\nPostmark Image Thumbnail Link\n\nTo\n\nCover Image\n\nLocy Type\n\nFDC 2(n+)\n\n1967-04-08\n\nFirst Day in Commission\n\nLocy Type\n\n2(n+) (DLG,USS)\n\n1975-06-30\n\nLast Day of Hull Designation DLG.

During the Quasi-War with France, he was still serving in her when she captured L'INSURGENTE. By 1800, he had risen to First Lieutenant; and he participated in USS CONSTELLATION's action against La Vengeance. Given command of the Schooner, USS ENTERPRISE, Lt. Sterett led her in the capture of the French Privateer, V'AMOUR de la PATRIE, on Christmas Eve 1800. In June 1801, he sailed from Baltimore for service with the Mediterranean Squadron. While on that cruise, USS ENTERPRISE engaged and captured a 14-gun Tripolitan Cruiser and her 80-man crew. In gratitude, Congress awarded Sterett a sword and highly commended his crew. Lt. Sterett continued his Navy career until he resigned his commission in 1805. He died on June 9 1807, at Lima, Peru.\n\nThe ships sponsor was Mrs. Phyllis Nitze.\n\nFour ships of the US Navy have been named in his honor - USS Sterett DD-27, USS Sterett DD-407, USS Sterett CG-31 and USS Sterett DDG-104.\n\nIf you have images or information to add to this page, then either contact the Curator or edit this page yourself and add it.
