        "text": "Welcome to the Jefferson Parish Assessor's Office\n\nWelcome to the Jefferson Parish Assessor's office. Our objective is to assess all property within Jefferson Parish, both real and personal, as accurately, and as equitably as possible. This website will assist you in locating property ownerships, assessed values, legal descriptions, estimated tax amounts, and other helpful information that pertain to the Assessor's office.\n\nAlong with using our website for informational purposes, you are always welcome to call us or visit one of our offices for any questions that you may have. Once again, thank you for visiting our website. It is an honor to serve as your Assessor.\n\n- Thomas J. Capella, CLA\n\nLocations\n\nThe Assessor's office offers you information regarding your homestead exemption, millage rates, ownerships, property valuation, and information for business owners as well. Our office is open for business from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. You may call or visit at one of our locations listed below:\n\nHow Do I File for Homestead Exemption?\n\nYou must appear in person at either location of the Jefferson Parish Assessor's office to sign for the homestead exemption. You should bring with you a copy of your act of sale for the property and a photo identification showing the address of the property on which the homestead exemption is being filed. If a husband and wife own the property jointly, only one has to appear in person. After you have initially filed for your homestead exemption, each year thereafter, you will receive a receipt in the mail showing your homestead exemption is permanent. You will no longer be eligible for the homestead exemption on that home should you move to another location or sell your house."
