If you do not intend to fault your spouse for the breakdown of the marriage, you either cite ‘incompatibility’ / ‘irreconcilable differences’ or separation of at least two years. Your word is sufficient for the court to grant a no-fault divorce.\n\nAlabama offers several fault-based grounds for divorce. They include:\n\nadultery;\n\nabandonment for more than one year;\n\nimpotence;\n\nImprisonment;\n\ndomestic violence;\n\ndeviant sexual behavior;\n\nalcoholism or drug addiction;\n\nconfinement in a mental institution for at least five years;\n\nor the wife’s pregnancy without the husband’s knowledge.\n\nThe petitioner will have to prove any fault-based ground in court, so legal representation advised in cases of fault-based divorce.\n\nOnlineDivorce reviews\n\nWesley H., Missouri\n\nI started my divorce on my own, spending loads of money on lawyer visits in the beginning.

Documents for all stages, alimony, child support and all!\n\nCustody of the child in Jefferson County\n\nAlabama’s child custody policy is expressed in Alabama Code Title 30 Chapter 3 Section 150 — State policy. The court assumes it is in the best interest of minor children to have frequent and continuing contact with parents and encourages parents to share in the rights and responsibilities of raising the children after the dissolution of marriage.\n\nAlthough joint custody is the court’s preferred choice, consideration is given to the needs and possibilities of each party when determining custody. By factoring in the child’s age and health, the parents’ moral character, availability for childcare, and the safety and wishes of all parties involved, the court makes a ruling on how to share legal custody and physical custody.\n\nHowever, before making a final determination, the court first reviews parenting plans submitted by each parent to see how they allocate parenting time and visitation. Some parents divide their time with the child 50/50, while some agree on a 70/30 split. Joint custody does not necessarily mean equal custody.\n\nIf the parents cannot agree on custody arrangements, or if the court does not approve of their settlement agreement, the judge has the final word.\n\nAlso, it is essential to know that parental conduct during the marriage and during the divorce process can affect the determination of custody. The court regards domestic violence, child abuse, severe mental illness, harmful religious practices, and homosexuality as examples of parental behavior potentially detrimental for the child. The grandparents or other relatives can gain custody of the child if the parents are deemed unfit.\n\nWant an easy divorce?\n\nJoin thousands who have already gotten divorce documents online in an affordable way.\n\nRules for child support in Jefferson County\n\nIt is common practice for one or both parents to pay child support after the dissolution of their marriage. As soon as parents apply for child support, they file a Child Support Guidelines form and Child Support Income Statement/Affidavit for the court to know their financial circumstances. The parents can also submit a written agreement to make their suggestions for the amount of child support.\n\nGenerally, the court uses the Income Shares Model to calculate the combined income for a family and adjust the amount of child care obligation to the parent’s share of combined income. Typically, the non-custodial parent pays more in child support as the custodial parent already pays their dividend in child care, household expenses, and other costs (see Child Support Guidelines).\n\nIn Alabama, child support continues until the child reaches 19 years of age or graduates from high school. Unemployed college students are eligible for child support, but it is up to the parents to agree to support their child past the age of 19. In any case, the court may order the obligation of child support to continue if the child has a disability of any kind.\n\nRules for spousal support in Jefferson County\n\nIn Alabama, the length of a marriage is especially crucial for the award of spousal support, referred to as alimony. According to Alabama Code Section 30-2-51 — Allowance upon grant of divorce, if the spouses were married for over ten years, the court may include in alimony up to 50 percent of the retirement benefits of one spouse.\n\nThere are many factors that the court considers when deciding on the length and amount of alimony, such as:\n\nthe length of the marriage;\n\neach party’s respective earning ability;\n\neach party’s age and health;\n\neach party’s value and type of property;\n\nthe conduct of the parties; and\n\nany other factors the court determines relevant.\n\nIn deciding alimony, Alabama courts aim to help the financially dependent spouse get training and experience to enter the workforce and support themselves. Therefore, marriages younger lasting less than 12 years rarely include alimony.\n\nUncontested Jefferson County divorce with children\n\nSave more time for your children - complete your divorce papers online\n\nProperty division in Jefferson County\n\nIn dividing marital property, Alabama uses equitable distribution laws, according to Alabama Code Section 30-2-51 — Certain property not considered. In contrast to many other US states that distinguish between marital and separate property, Alabama includes separate property in the marital assets (commingled property). However, gifts and inheritance remain separate. All separate bank accounts, vehicles, stock, real estate, etc. stay separate. However, if separate money enters a joint saving account, it becomes marital property under Alabama law.\n\nAssessing the value the property and possible tax consequences, the court also considers:\n\nhow long the spouses were married;\n\nwhether they had previous marriages and children;\n\nwhether the spouses contributed to the increased earning capacity of each other;\n\nwhat kind of job the spouses have;\n\ntheir age, health, and needs;\n\nsources of income, expenses, and liabilities;\n\nand who the custodial parent is.\n\nThe court always considers what the spouses want regarding the division of property and what variant they offer. If it is a reasonable distribution, the judge usually approves it. However, if the spouses struggle to split retirement plans or dispute over the family home, the court may order the parties to hire experts to handle financial issues.\n\nMediation support in Jefferson County\n\nAccording to Alabama Code Section 6-6-20 — Instances requiring mediation, divorce mediation can be (1) requested by both spouses; (2) requested by either spouse (who will pay mediation fees); (3) ordered by the court.\n\nMediation can help any couple who cannot resolve their differences over custody, support issues, or property division. During a mediation session, a mediator can help a divorcing couple draft a settlement agreement or parenting plan.\n\nIn most cases, mediation can drive down the cost of divorce because it resolves conflicts without a trail and expedites the divorce process.\n\nHow to file for divorce in Jefferson County | Step-by-Step\n\n1\n\nCheck out the requirements for filing. According to the Alabama Code Section 30-2-5 — Residency requirement, either spouse must have been a resident of the state and the county for at least six months before filing for divorce.\n\nMake sure you choose the proper venue (the clerk’s office or the circuit court in the county of filing).\n\n2\n\nObtain and fill out the court forms. Go to Onlinedivorce.com or obtain the forms from the clerk’s office or the circuit court.\n\nBe aware that under Alabama Family Law, there are legal terms for divorcing spouses. The plaintiff is the spouse who files for divorce, and the other spouse is the defendant.\n\nTo begin a divorce in Alabama, you start with filling out a Complaint for Divorce and Summons. You will need to include your information on child custody, child support, alimony, and dividing assets and debts, so take your time. Also, the forms must be signed in the presence of a notary.\n\n3\n\nFile the court forms. Bring the completed forms to the circuit court in the county where either you or your spouse live and file them with the clerk. The clerk will stamp the copies (you need two of them) and submit the original with the court. Now you can pay a filing fee.\n\n4\n\nServe the spouse. Keep one copy for yourself. Serve the other copy to your spouse to inform him or her of a divorce process.\n\nThe easiest way to serve the defendant is when the spouses agree to an uncontested divorce, and thus the defendant agrees to accept delivery of service. The defendant and a witness must sign the Acceptance of Service, and the plaintiff files a Notice of Acceptance with the court.\n\nAmong other ways of serving the spouse are certified mail, hired process servers, and service by publication. Each of the serving methods requires a fee.\n\nAfter serving the spouse with the divorce paperwork, he or she shall file an Answer and Waiver and pay a filing fee. The deadline for the defendant’s response expires after 30 days. If the spouse fails to respond, the divorce proceedings will proceed into default judgment.\n\n5\n\nFile with the court the rest of the paperwork. Alabama has a 30-day waiting period from the moment of filing. If you have not yet submitted a parenting plan, financial disclosures, or a settlement agreement, this is the time to do it.\n\n6\n\nFinalize your divorce. If by this time you have submitted all the required paperwork and everything is correct and in order, the judge will sign your decree of divorce. If something is wrong with your divorce papers, the judge will ask you to correct it.\n\nWhy us?\n\nContested Divorce\n\nHourly Billing - Driving the Average Cost of Divorce to $15,000+\n\nContested divorces can be lengthy and costly due to spouses being unable to agree on one or more key issues, including child custody, property division, or spousal support.\n\nOffline and inconvenient process in which both parties often hire attorneys to represent their interests.\n\nThe adversarial nature of a contested divorce can lead to heightened emotional stress and strain for both spouses and their families.\n\nAbsent a settlement, the final divorce judgment and terms are determined by the court, which may not fully align with the preferences of either spouse.\n\nThe premier uncontested divorce tool\n\nFast, affordable, and simple process using our fully-guided divorce questionnaire and filing service.\n\nOnline process to be completed at your own pace, can get documents as quickly as same day.\n\nReceive ready-to-file forms specific to your jurisdiction and situation.\n\nEasy online access for both spouses, free revisions for 30 days, and the ability to save your data longer term.
