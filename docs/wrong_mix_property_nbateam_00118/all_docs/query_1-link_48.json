Thomas Eiland was 20 years old when they married. His father Isaih Eiland gave him a double bit ax for a wedding present. This area of Alabama has lots of pine trees, so this was a needed tool for Tom to help him make a living for Maria and their future family. At the age of 48, Thomas left Ramer, Montgomery Co, Al in early 1885. He loaded all of his possessions on two wagons pulled by teams of oxen with his three oldest sons and a 15 year old daughter and made the 650 mile trip to Hickory Grove, Milam Co, Tx On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1885, Rutha Maria and the other children, who were all under 14 years of age, arrived on a train in Rockdale and joined the rest of the family.\n\nLess than a year following their arrival in Tx, tragedy struck the Eiland family and four of their children died of bloody flux, a severe bacillary dysentery caused by bacteria of various kind. Doxy was the first to die, at the age of three. Only 11 days later Charles, who was 15 at the time, died. Four days later, Clara, who was 11, died then after another four days, Lorenza, who was 10, died, Some of the other children were very sick, but lived through the plague and regained their health.\n\nThomas and Maria had a mail order home built in 1900 in the Gay Hill community near the town of Fletcher, Milam Co, Tx Floyd Eiland has a picture of the new home taken in 1901 with grandson Travis, who was a small baby, being held by Millie Miller, a 20 year old black housekeeper for Tom and Maria, another woman in the picture was probably Mary Arnold, another black houskeeper that they had at the time. Joe Leander Eiland, was 19 years old at the time, and he is standing an the porch in the picture. Tom, Maria and the chickens are out in the yard. Calvin Eiland who was 14, and Marcus \"Mark\", who was 11, are not in the picture, so they probably were in school. Their picture, Along with grandson Clyde Eiland, should be in the school picture of the Gay Hill school in 1899. In his later years Tom was blind and Maria was in bad health. They had servants along with their two youngest sons, Calvin and Mark, who took care of them. On the 1920 Census Tom is shown living with his son Joe.\n\nThe Eiland family farm was located on the south bank of Brushy Creek in what was later known as the Gay Hill Community, about six miles west of Rockdale, Tx, halfway between Rockdale and Thorndale. They cleared the land for farming and built rail and brush fences from the timber cleared from the land, to protect the crops from the cattle and horses that were running loose, since at this time this area of Tx was still Open Cattle Range. Fruit orchards were established and sow peaches, plums, pears, berries, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, coin and cotton were being produced for market. As the children, both boys and girls, married, they and their families built their homes on the farm and continued to help work the land. The produce was shipped to the Farmers Markets in Houston and Dallas by the oldest son, William T. Eiland.\n\nAL Civil War Record\n\nLast Name: Eilands\n\nFirst Name: T MI: J\n\nBranch: Infantry\n\nRegimental Unit: 33rd AL Regiment\n\nCompany Unit: E\n\nAuthority: Muster in roll dated Greenville 1862/03/14;muster roll dated November 1862.\n\nEnlistment Date: 1862/03/12\n\nEnlistment Info: Age 25, Al, Greenville, Private.\n\n1860 census District 2, Montgomery, AL\n\nThos J Eiland 24 abt 1836 Alabama Male\n\nMariah Eiland 16 abt 1844 Alabama Female\n\nLeonard Eiland 1 abt 1859 Alabama Male\n\nH Wilson Eiland 25 abt 1835 Alabama Male\n\n1870 United States Federal Census > Alabama > Montgomery > Township 13\n\nThomas J Eiland, 33, M, W, Farmer, 1600, 900, Alabama\n\nRebecca M, 27, F, W, Housekeeper, Alabama\n\nLeonardas, 11, m, w, at home, Alabama\n\nWilliam T, 5, m, w, at home, Alabama\n\nAndrew J, 2, m, w, at home, Alabama\n\nRachael A, 1, f, w, at home, Alabama\n\n1880 Census Place: Dublin, Montgomery, Alabama\n\nT J Eiland, Head, 44, AL , GA , NC , Farming ,\n\nMariah Eiland, Wife, 36, AL , SC , SC , Keeping House ,\n\nWillie T Eiland, Son, 14, AL , AL , AL , Field Hand ,\n\nAndrew J Eiland, Son, 18, AL , AL , AL , Field Hand ,\n\nRuth A Eiland, Daughter, 10, AL , AL , AL , Student ,\n\nCharles Eiland, Son, 9, AL , AL , AL , Student ,\n\nEugene Eiland, Son, 7, AL , AL , AL ,\n\nClara Eiland, Daughter, 5, AL , AL , AL ,\n\nLorenza Eiland, Son, 3, AL , AL , AL ,\n\nLucie Eiland, Daughter, 1, AL , AL , AL ,\n\n1900 United States Federal Census\n\nHome in 1900: Justice Precinct 4, Milam, Texas\n\nT J Eiland 63, head, married 41 years, Apr 1837, Al, Ga, NC\n\nRuth Eiland 56, wife, 17 children, 9 living, Dec 1843, Al, Al, Al\n\nJoe Eiland 18, son, Nov 1991, Al, Al, Al, Farm laborer\n\nCalvin Eiland 13, son, Nov 1886, Tx, Al, Al, at school\n\nMarcus Eiland 10, son, May 1890, Tx, Al, Al, at school\n\nMary Arnold 43, Servant, Black, May 1857, Tx, cook, 7 children 6 living\n\nWillis Miller 19, Servant, Black, Feb 1881, Tx, Farm Laborer\n\nKatie Cunningham 8, Servant, Black, Nov, 1891, Tx\n\nScilla Cunningham 6, Servant, Black, Oct 1893, Tx\n\n1910 United States Federal Census about Calvin Eiland\n\nHome in 1910: Justice Precinct 4, Milam, Texas\n\nThomas J Eiland 73, married 52 years, Al, Ga, NC, farmer, general farm\n\nRuth Eiland 67 [69] , 16 children , 9 living, Al, Ga, Ga,\n\nCalvin Eiland 20 [24] , son, Tx, Al, Al, Farmer, General Farm\n\nMarquis Eiland 20, son, Tx, Al, Al, farm laborer, home farm\n\nAnnie Mason 40, cook, white, divorced, Tx, In, Tx, Cook, private home\n\nOrpha Mason 11, boarder, white, Tx, Tx, Tx\n\n1920 United States Federal Census\n\nHome in 1920: Justice Precinct 4, Milam, Texas, Beat 4 North of I & GN Ry (The International and Great Northern Railroad)\n\nJ L Eiland 36\n\nWillie Eiland 36\n\nVernon Eiland 16\n\nEmory Eiland 14\n\nInos Eiland 12\n\nOtis Eiland 10\n\nLucile Eiland 8\n\nAnise Ray Eiland 6\n\nEdna May Eiland 5\n\nNolan Eiland 3\n\nLaura Eiland 2 [2 2/12]\n\nT J Eiland 83, Al, Al, Al,\n\nAbout Ruth Mariah Thomas:\n\nRuth's sister, Beckey, married Elijah Caffey, and her sister, Sarah (Sally), married Andrew J Jackson.\n\nRuth went by several names in the census.\n\n1850 Ruthy M age 6\n\n1860 Mariah age 16\n\n1870 Rebecca M age 27\n\n1880 Mariah age 36e\n\n1900 Ruth age 56\n\n1910 Ruth age 67\n\nDeath - Aged Lady Dies at Gay Hill - Mrs. Maria Eiland died on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 1914 at her home in the Gay Hill Community after an illness of 12 years.
