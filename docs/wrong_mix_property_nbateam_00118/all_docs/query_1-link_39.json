        "text": "Calculation of Subsidy and Family Share:\n\nThe family share is calculated by subtracting the amount of the housing assistance payment from the gross rent.\n\nExample:\n\n$1290 Payment Standard (maximum subsidy amount)\n\n-$650 Maximum Housing Assistance (amount paid by JCHA to landlord)\n\n=$640 Total Tenant Payment (family's share of monthly rent)\n\nPlease Note: In addition to your monthly rent payment, you are responsible for the security deposit for utilities (if applicable).\n\nExample #1\n\nGross Rent $950\n\nTotal Tenant Payment -$400\n\nHousing Assistance Payment = $550\n\nExample #2\n\nGross Rent $1050\n\nTotal Tenant Payment -$400\n\nHousing Assistance Pay = $650\n\nIn example #1 the PHA will pay $100.00 less per month to the owner than in example #2, even though the family's income is the same in both examples. The difference in the rent payment is because the unit in example #2 had a higher rent to owner.\n\nDetermine Adjusted Income\n\nAfter determining the total annual income for the household, the PHA makes any necessary adjustments to the annual income in accordance with HUD regulations. If the family qualifies, there are five (5) possible deductions and allowances. HUD approved deductions and allowable expenses are subtracted from the annual income to get the family's adjusted annual income.\n\nDeductions and HUD Allowable Expenses:\n\nMedical\n\nChildcare\n\nDependents\n\nDependents:\n\nA $480.00 deduction is made for all minors under the age of 18, and for family members 18 and over who are full time students or a person with a disability, other than the Head or Spouse.\n\nElderly/Disability Allowance:\n\nA $400.00 household deduction is made for families whose Head, Spouse, or Sole Member is 62 or over, or is a person with a Disability.\n\nPHA Determines Final Eligibility:\n\nLet's examine how the total amount of the rent for the unit (Rent to Owner) can affect the amount of the family's rent payment to the owner.\n\nExample:\n\nPayment Standard $1290\n\nTotal Tenant Payment -$640\n\nHousing Assistance Payment = $650\n\nRent to Owner $900\n\nHousing Assistance Payment -$500\n\nFamily Rent to Owner = $400\n\nThe family must pay the difference between the maximum Housing Assistance Payment and the Rent to the Owner.\n\nMaximum Rent at Initial Occupancy:\n\nAt the time a family initially receives tenant-based assistance for occupancy of a dwelling unit, if the gross rent for the unit is greater than the Payment Standard for the family, the family share cannot exceed 40% of the family's monthly adjust income.\n\nThe family share is the gross rent minus the Housing Assistance Payment.\n\nThe family may ask the PHA to assist the family in negotiating a lower rent to the owner.\n\nRent Reasonableness:\n\nAt the time of inspection, the inspector will also be evaluating the rent reasonableness of the housing unit. The proposed rent will be compared to the rent for other units on the market of similar size, features, and amenities.\n\nAlthough there are no HUD \"ceilings\" on the rents charged in the Voucher Program, the rents must still be reasonable and comparable to those charged for similar unassisted units. The PHA bases the determination of reasonableness and comparability on the unit inspection report and rental market information.\n\nPHA Disapproval of Tenancy:\n\nIf the family chooses a unit with gross rent greater than the payment standard and the family share exceeds 40% of their monthly adjusted income, the PHA is NOT PERMITTED to approve tenancy.\n\nAssignment of Bedroom Sizes (Subsidy Standards)\n\nThe Jefferson County Housing Authority will issue a voucher for particular bedroom size - the bedroom size is a factor in determining the family's level of assistance. The following guidelines will determine each family's unit size without overcrowding or over-housing:\n\n0 Bedrooms: Minimum 1 and maximum 1 persons\n\n1 Bedroom: Minimum 1 and maximum 2 persons\n\n2 Bedrooms: Minimum 2 and maximum 4 persons\n\n3 Bedrooms: Minimum 3 and maximum 6 persons\n\n4 bedrooms: Minimum 4 and maximum 8 persons\n\nThese standards are based on the assumption that each bedroom will accommodate no more than two (2) persons. Two adults will share a bedroom unless related by blood.\n\nIn determining bedroom size, the Jefferson County Housing Authority will include the presence of children to be born to a pregnant woman, children who are in the process of being adopted, children whose custody is being obtained, children who are temporarily away at school or temporarily in foster-care.\n\nBedroom size will also be determined using the following guidelines:\n\nChildren of the same sex will share a bedroom.\n\nChildren of the opposite sex, both under the age of 5 will share a bedroom\n\nAdults and children will not be required to share a bedroom\n\nFoster adults and children will not be required to share a bedroom with family members\n\nLive-in aides will get a separate bedroom.\n\nThe Jefferson County Housing Authority will grant exceptions to normal occupancy standards when a family requests a larger size than the guidelines allow and documents a medical reason why the larger size is necessary.\n\nThe family unit size will be determined by the Jefferson County Housing Authority in accordance with the above guidelines and will determine the maximum rent subsidy for the family; however, if the family selects a smaller unit, the payment standard for the smaller size will be used to calculate the subsidy. If the family selects a larger size, the payment standard for the family unit size will determine the maximum subsidy.\n\nEffective 01/01/2023\n\nFY 2023 Fair Market Rents\n\n0-Bedroom $866\n\n1-Bedroom $942\n\n2-Bedroom $1,075\n\n3-Bedroom $1,376\n\n4-Bedroom $1,494\n\n5-Bedroom $1,718\n\nJCHA's 2023 Payment Standards\n\n0-Bedroom $1,039\n\n1-Bedroom $1,130\n\n2-Bedroom $1,290\n\n3-Bedroom $1,651\n\n4-Bedroom $1,793\n\n5-Bedroom $2,062\n\nFor additional information on how these 2023 Rent/Payment calculations are achieved, please visit HUDUser.gov and select the following:\n\nSelect Fair Market Rents\n\nSelect 2023\n\nClick on the button \"Click Here for FY2023 FMRs\"\n\nSelect State Alabama - AL\n\nSelect County Jefferson County, AL\n\nClick on Next Screen"
