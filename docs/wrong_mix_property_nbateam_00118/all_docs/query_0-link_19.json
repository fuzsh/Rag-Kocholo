        "text": "The story goes that Al Jefferson didn’t stop smiling for two weeks after Minnesota traded him to Utah.\n\n“No, the first three weeks,” the one-time Celtic said last week before breaking into a giggle.\n\n“We lost our first game to the Warriors — that’s when I stopped smiling,” Jefferson said. “I’m just in a good position with this situation — the last game was the perfect example of us being down (to the Clippers) and then fighting back to win it.\n\n“I haven’t felt like this since I was in Boston — being on a team where you know you have a chance to win every night is a wonderful thing.”\n\nEven then it doesn’t always work out. Jefferson went out that night and, in one of the most nationally watched games he’s going to play this season, got off to a horrid 1-of-7 start against the Heat. Coach Jerry Sloan, who had seen enough for the night, benched Jefferson for the last 18 minutes, including all of the fourth quarter and overtime during Utah’s stunning comeback win. Jefferson played a much more inspired role the next night, when the Jazz came back yet again, this time in Orlando.\n\nSo as much as Jefferson has to work on his timing and comfort in Sloan’s no-nonsense system, the greater timing that dictates his life couldn’t be much better. The man famously traded for Kevin Garnett hit bottom for a variety of reasons in his last season as a T-Wolf.\n\nHe was arrested on a DUI charge in February; a mistake for which he profusely apologized. His grandmother, Gladys Jefferson — a pivotal person in Jefferson’s life — had died last November.\n\n“I don’t get into a lot of losing situations, even when I was in Boston,” he said. “Last year was the first time I actually gave up. That’s why I ended up getting in trouble. I found myself not focusing on basketball. I lost my grandmother — just a lot of things. A lot of things hit me — getting the DUI. I knew it was a bad moment.\n\n“Minnesota was trying to do wonderful things up there. I just didn’t have the years to wait for it. It was going to take another three years for things to be where they wanted them to be. Both sides departed good, and decided to move on.”\n\nIn Sloan, Jefferson also believes he has found the first coach since Doc Rivers who is making a difference in his game. The unspoken message is that he never received that direction in Minnesota.\n\n“He’s a very difficult coach, but he makes you get after it,” Jefferson said of Sloan. “He’s exactly what I need. It’s a different system. I’m getting it down but I’m still thinking a lot. They call the play out and I’m thinking what it is, but it’s going to come.”\n\nIn a quick Q&A session, Jefferson went on to talk about a variety of subjects, from his current point guard, Deron Williams, to the growth of a former point guard, Rajon Rondo.\n\nQ: How much of a difference has Williams made in your game?\n\nA: I didn’t get to play with a great point guard until — since never. I played with Gary Payton when he was on his way out. Rondo his rookie year. So the point guard I have now is going to make my job a lot easier. I’ve been scoring against double teams my whole career, and now we have weapons. We have somebody who’s going to make you pay for it. It’s a good feeling.\n\nQ: Doc says that he talks to you every week. Do you still have a bond with Boston?\n\nA: We keep in touch. We always text each other, especially during the summer. I’m in Boston all the time working out with Walt (Norton, the former Celtics strength and conditioning coach). He’s got his own gym. Two years I’ve been with him now. Boston is my home away from home.\n\nQ: Has Rondo surprised you?\n\nA: I’ve been knowing Rondo since I was in 10th grade. I’m always trying to support the (Prentiss, Miss., High School) Class of ’04. The things he’s doing, you saw his rookie year, my last year there. You knew he was going to be something special. To see him do it now, it doesn’t surprise me. The only scary thing about it is that he’s only going to get better. Lot of people say it’s easy to do that when you have that many (scorers). But it’s really not that easy. When you look at the passes he gives to Ray Allen — Ray Allen gets the ball right where he can shoot it, right there. I could go out there and make that shot when I’m that open.\n\nQ: Williams does that for you now, right?\n\nA: My point. I just get the ball and go right up.\n\nQ: How are things with your old friend, (Kendrick Perkins)?\n\nA: I’ve kept in touch with him, and I tell (Celtics trainer) Ed Lacerte that I know what he’s going through right now (as Perkins recovers from knee surgery). Keep working. It’s a long road, but it will go by fast. I texted Ed last week and he said Perk was doing good, working real hard.\n\nA NEW STAR IN THE WEST\n\nThey apparently have a homegrown formula for NBA-quality power forwards at Louisiana Tech. The Jazz struck Hall of Fame gold with Karl Malone, and are now reaping huge benefits from Paul Millsap, who has exploded into his own thanks to the departure of Carlos Boozer.\n\nMillsap hit for all sorts of career highs during Tuesday’s win over Miami, including points (46) and 3-pointers (three). Prior to that night, as a bemused LeBron James pointed out, Millsap was 2-of-20 in his career from downtown.\n\nMillsap also scored 30 points the previous week against Oklahoma City, and followed up his night on the town in Miami with 23 points the following night in Orlando. Heading into Friday’s game in Atlanta, he had scored at least 19 points in six of his previous seven games.\n\nGlen Davis, who spent a good chunk of his AAU years in Baton Rouge putting a body on Millsap, understands the numbers.\n\n“Not really surprised,” said Big Baby. “Not for a guy who can play the game the way he plays it. He’s just a surprising player. You expect to get that from Millsap, because he’s been working on it. I knew him growing up playing against him. He’s establishing himself because of the opportunity the Utah Jazz have given him.”\n\nTHIS WEEK’S CELTICS TIMELINE\n\nWednesday, vs. Wasington, 7:30 p.m.\n\nTwo generations of Kentucky point guards — Rajon Rondo and John Wall — go head to head. The quality of point guards in the league is good enough that Rondo is guaranteed of a premium matchup at least once per week, or in this case two.\n\nFriday, vs. Oklahoma City, 7 p.m.\n\nAnother high-profiled rematch, with the Celtics winning the first game in the Ford Center. They are building up quite a record against playoff-quality teams (2-0 against Miami, 1-0 each against Chicago, OKC and Milwaukee). They could go up 2-0 against another blue chip group here.\n\nKeep an eye on:\n\nDelonte West is eligible to return for the C’s in Game No. 11 Wednesday vs. Washington at TD Garden, and that’s when the second unit will begin to take on its true form. The combo guard — suspended for the first 10 games of the season — had emerged as a leader of the reserves almost from the moment this team officially gathered at Salve Regina for the start of training camp.\n\nWest’s locker room dust-up with Von Wafer notwithstanding — a natural clash for two edgy players vying for the same spot in the rotation — he’s clearly the more valuable player. His control will allow the oft-scrambled Nate Robinson to play off the ball.\n\n“This is going to make a huge difference,” coach Doc Rivers said. “We really need another guard right now.\n\nIT’S A RONDO WORLD\n\nInevitably, of course, the Celtics point guard’s assist average started to drop from his league-leading 16.4 mark through the first five games of the season. But no one else in the league — literally — could have put together subsequent performances of 11 (vs. Chicago), 10 (OKC), 15 (Dallas), and 16 (Miami) and seen a decrease in average. But as of Friday he was at a 14.8 average. Keep in mind that Celtics opponents, through nine games, had a team average of 18.2 assists against them. That’s not a bad one-man counter point.\n\nAt least one Celtic already has Rondo minted for something even greater down the road.\n\n“You don’t find young point guards with that kind of command of the game,” said Jermaine O’Neal. “I told him that, ’Boy, I’m going to bring my kids to watch you in a couple of years.’ He’s the kind of player who can hurt a defense without even taking a shot. He’s been working on that quick little pull-up jumper, and when he gets that it’s going to be lights out. Sometimes he even gives up open shots to pass. He has a chance to be one of the all-time great point guards.\n\n“I played with Damon Stoudemire when he was ‘Mighty Mouse’ and Kenny Anderson, and Jamaal Tinsley was good at finding the open guy,” he said. “But the biggest thing I’m a little more shocked about — I knew Rondo was a pretty good point guard, but it was his control and command of the game. It’s his age. He looks like he’s been in this league for 15 years already. He talks guys through plays even during a game, which is rare.”"
