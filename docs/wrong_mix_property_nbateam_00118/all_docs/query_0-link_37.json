        "text": "You are a seeker of truth. You are curious and open-minded, and you are drawn to the abstract and the philosophical. You are also very rational and analytical, and you often see the world in terms of concepts and ideas. You are interested in understanding why things happen and what is truly important in life. You are also motivated by a desire to find your own spiritual path and to become fully self-aware. Your deep intuition and receptivity to the sacred give you a special ability to understand and connect with the spiritual realm. As a result, the ideal or cause you espouse will be related to the concept of universality or totality. Since your lifetime adventure is based in part on this absolute truth, it is important for you to make an effort to define its nature. What kind of universality are you striving for; what spiritual Everest (in yourself or outwardly) are you trying to scale? In fact, you tend to like mountain climbing, because of the effort it requires. It’s a great joy for you. Alone at the peak, you can contemplate and understand everything. In pursuit of this absolute center (positive or negative) which animates you, you are shrewd and persistent. Stamina and endurance are resources of which you are quite confident. Your existence and organism are arranged to optimize them; others may consider you slow, but you are really just playing it safe, because, unconsciously, you know time is on your side. When you take an initiative, it is after careful forethought and preparation. Your great composure, ability to resist and overcome obstacles and wickedness, and your foresight give you a great potential to accomplish total self-control. However, you must beware of one pitfall: excess. You tend to be a bit too rigid and intolerant; in intellectual pursuits, you can tend to be dogmatic, hermetic, or conformist. Some people criticize your obsession with labeling things. A creature of duty, naturally sober and relatively self-disciplined, sometimes a little too demanding of yourself, you might commit yourself to a productive lifestyle as readily as to a stoic philosophy. The path to liberty mapped by a respect for order is not the easiest to follow. Your introverted personality gives you an attitude of reserve. You appreciate solitude and do not always enjoy sharing your feelings. You avoid superficial human contact as much as possible. Indeed, you sometimes feels uncomfortable at long, drawn-out social occasions and activities, and your interest in others is aroused only when they discuss subjects of\n\nAl Jefferson tends to place his emotions in the forefront.

Your personality profile is summarized by the following key words: Individualism, Guile, Vitality and passion, Need for security, Pugnacity, Inhibition, Impatience, Studiousness, Impetuosity, Methodical nature, Enterprise, Foresight, Innovation, Loyalty. Your character is animated by the tension between an impulsive, spontaneous nature and an abiding need for security and continuity. Your behavior is jagged and seems to proceed by fits and starts. Maturity should bring your stability between these contradictory inclinations which will coexist, although you will still be aware of deep doubts provoked by the situation. Ambitious and persistent, you can devote all your energy to succeeding. Your taste for leadership makes you apt to play an important role in society, taking on serious responsibilities.\n\nBorn on the third day before the full moon, you are a Gibbous Moon Lunar type. This “soli-lunar” configuration gives you a rich, complex personality, although you are sometimes troubled by the feeling you are struggling to do something great. Indeed, a feeling that you are lacking something may preoccupy you until you find a spiritual or humanitarian cause worthy of your devotion. Devotion will be important to you as a foundation for your inner and outer development. If you fail to encounter a great and noble cause to which you are willing to pledge yourself, you could always make do with a person whose aura and magnetism attract you. Whatever you decide, it is by working to serve a cause or another person that you will approach your own self-transformation.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of Al Jefferson’s personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of his partner.\n\nAl Jefferson’s moon is located at 15° GEMINI.
