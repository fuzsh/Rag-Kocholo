        "text": "Couples who decide to divorce need to prepare the necessary documents and submit them to the court. In this article, you will find a basic list of Jefferson County divorce forms in PDF format and information about the stages of the marriage dissolution process.\n\nHere are the common papers spouses will need to fill out when filing for divorce:\n\nDivorce Complaint. A plaintiff must submit this document to the court to start the divorce process. It contains information about the marriage, the parties involved, and the grounds for marriage dissolution.\n\nPlaintiff’s Testimony. This form is an affidavit confirming all the facts stated in the complaint.\n\nAnswer and Waiver and Acceptance of Service. After a plaintiff has filed with the court, they must serve the other party with the complaint and summons. If the defendant signs the Answer and Waiver, it means they have accepted service, and a plaintiff will not have to hire a private process server or use another method for serving their spouse.\n\nCertificate of Divorce. This document certifies that the divorce was granted; it contains the personal data of spouses and information about their marriage.\n\nFinal Judgement of Divorce. It specifies the terms of marriage dissolution and officially finalizes the divorce process.\n\nHow to File Divorce Papers in Jefferson County?\n\nTo start an Alabama divorce, spouses should determine the grounds for divorce and meet the state residency requirements; they can submit documents to the local court only if at least one of them has lived in the state for 6 months or more.\n\nThe main steps to file for divorce in Jefferson County are specified below.\n\nStep 1. Preparation of documents.\n\nSpouses should determine and prepare a set of necessary documents for their case. It will vary depending on whether a couple has children, joint property, and any disagreements over child custody, support, and division of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn addition to the original documents, a petitioner should prepare several copies; you can check the exact number of copies needed at the county clerk’s office. You must sign the divorce papers if required; some of them should be signed in the presence of a notary public.\n\nStep 2. Submission of forms to the court.\n\nThe party filing the lawsuit is a plaintiff, while the other spouse is a defendant. It does not matter which spouse filed the complaint; typically, it does not affect the final decision. After the court clerk receives and checks the papers, the case will be assigned a number. When filing the forms, a petitioner needs to pay the court fees.\n\nStep 3. Serving the spouse.\n\nAfter filing a petition with the court, a plaintiff should serve its copy and some other documents on a defendant. If the case is uncontested and the other party is cooperative, they may sign an Answer and Waiver and Acceptance of Service. If not, a plaintiff should choose a different method of service, such as hiring a sheriff or a private process server or using service by publication if a defendant’s location is unknown.\n\nStep 4. Filing a response or counterclaim.\n\nAfter being served, a defendant needs to file a response or counterclaim to the complaint within 30 days. If they do not respond during this period, the court can grant a default judgment.\n\nStep 5. Setting the hearing and finalizing the process.\n\nAfter 30 days have passed, a hearing on the case can be scheduled. If the divorce is uncontested, one hearing is usually enough. The judge will check the documents and make a decision on the case. If the divorce is contested, several court hearings may be required until spouses can agree on marriage termination issues or the judge decides on child custody, support, and property division for them.\n\nWhere Do You File Divorce Papers in Jefferson County?\n\nIf you meet the residency requirements, you can file your documents in any of the Jefferson County divorce courts as specified below.
