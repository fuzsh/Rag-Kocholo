        "text": "Cavaliers power forward Kevin Love has studied Al Jefferson’s game from up close.\n\nThey were teammates with the Minnesota Timberwolves for two seasons, 2008-09 and 2009-10.\n\n‘He was like a big brother to me,’ Love said. ‘He took me under his wing. He beat me up in the post a lot in practice. He’s still doing that today.\n\n‘His game is evolved. I had a great time learning under him.’\n\nThe two post players met Dec. 15 at Quicken Loans Arena. The 6-foot-10, 289-pound Jefferson is averaging 19 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.22 blocks for the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nUsing his long arms and big hands, Jefferson possesses another real weapon in his arsenal.\n\n‘He has one of the best pump fakes in the entire league for a big man,’ Love said. ‘It’s one of those deadly moves in the league.’\n\nCavaliers coach David Blatt called Jefferson a high-level post player.\n\n‘He’ll require some special attention,’ he said. ‘He’s a true post presence. He’ll cause a lot of problems for any team.’\n\nHeated rivalry?\n\nCavaliers forward LeBron James has had some major battles with Hornets swingman Lance Stephenson over the years. Stephenson played for Indiana before signing with Charlotte in free agency. He once blew in James’ ear during a playoff series against Miami.\n\n‘He’s a feisty competitor,’ James said. ‘He’ll try to get under your skin in any way possible. You can’t really get me out of my game. The only way to do that is if I miss shots. (If that happens) I can still affect the game in other ways.’\n\nJohnny Football\n\nJames attended the Browns-Bengals game on Dec. 14. Quarterback Johnny Manziel didn’t play well in the 30-0 loss.\n\n‘I’m not disappointed,’ James said. ‘It’s only one game. I know how the game goes and how the game works. You can’t put all that pressure on what happens in one game.’\n\nJames’ marketing firm represents Manziel.\n\nInjury report\n\nGuard Matthew Dellavedova was in the lineup against the Hornets.\n\n‘To say he’s 100 percent is unfair,’ Blatt said.\n\nDellavedova spent some time in a New Orleans hospital over the weekend with a stomach ailment.\n\nSwingman Mike Miller, who has missed the last six games, must go through a full practice before he passes the NBA’s concussion protocol. The Cavs are hoping that happens Dec. 16.\n\nBlatt hopes he’ll be active in the Atlanta game Dec. 17.\n\nGuard Kyrie Irving is not 100 percent after suffering a knee contusion in the Oklahoma City game Dec. 11. Blatt said he’s not feeling ‘tip top.’\n\n‘He had a scare and took a hit,’ Blatt said. ‘That might take a little while to have him feel (100 percent).’\n\nIrving is shooting 34 percent from the field (21 of 62) in his previous four games.\n\n‘We went through a pretty tough stretch game-wise,’ Blatt said. ‘I think it was more of a fatigue thing. Kyrie is having a great season.’"
