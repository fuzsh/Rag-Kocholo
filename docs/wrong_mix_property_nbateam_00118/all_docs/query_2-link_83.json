        "text": "JEFFERSON COUNTY, Ala. (WBRC) - The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and the Kiwanis Club of Birmingham are partnering together to launch a new initiative called “Books not Bullets” to connect with younger students in the community.\n\nDeputies with the JCSO will now be equipped with books in their patrol cars to share with youth in the communities that they serve – all made possible by a new program called “Books not Bullets”.\n\nSheriff Mark Pettway says he’s excited about the initiative and looking forward to this program being another step in bridging the gap between law enforcement and the community.\n\n“It is imperative that we stay connected to our youth because those relationships are vital to the success of Jefferson County,” Sheriff Pettway says. “We want students to know that their safety is our top priority and using programs such “Books not Bullets” allows us to connect with them and learn more about how we can better serve them.”\n\nThe idea for this program was born out of the announcement that reading scores are down statewide. State Superintendent Eric Mackey says 9% of the state’s 49,000 third graders scored below grade level this spring. That’s an improvement from 17% of third graders reading below grade level last year.\n\n“Supporting education is one of our top priorities each year and we are excited to partner with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office on a program that will serve our youth,” Honora Gathings, Executive Director of Kiwanis Club of Birmingham says. “Reading is fundamental for kids at all ages and this program will benefit them throughout the year.”\n\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here."
