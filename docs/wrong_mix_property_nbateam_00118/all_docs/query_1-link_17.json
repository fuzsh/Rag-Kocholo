        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - Jefferson County (Bessemer Cutoff) District Attorney Lynniece Washington is pledging the firing of her husband from his longtime post at the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office will have “no impact” on the working relationship between her office and the Sheriff’s Office tasked with investigating the cases her office prosecutes.\n\n“This will have absolutely no impact on my ability to do my job or interact professionally with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department,” Washington said in an exclusive statement to WBRC. “I swore to follow and uphold the law and serve the people of this county, and that’s what I will continue to do.”\n\nWashington’s husband, Jude Washington, a Sergeant tasked to a federal drug task force for the last 18 years, was first reassigned, then dismissed by the Sheriff’s Office in January for alleged violations of department policy, allegations Washington denies and intends to fight in an appeals process before the Jefferson County Personnel Board.\n\n“The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office made a grave mistake in terminating Jude Washington,” says Hube Dodd, attorney for Jude Washington. “The allegations that he broke Department rules or policies are based on false and misleading statements which will be easily disproved. Jude Washington dedicated the last 28 years of his career to making the citizens of Jefferson County safer, and he looks forward to being reinstated so that he can resume protecting those citizens.”\n\n“I love my husband and stand by him, but on a professional level, I will continue to execute the duties of my office as I have been,” Lynniece Washington said.\n\n“I’ve recently worked with the JCSO by sending two of my Asst. DA’s to teach court procedures to new recruits that are trained at the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office Training Facility and I appeared on yesterday to greet recruits and emphasize the importance of their decision to protect and serve in their respective county’s. Not only am I committed to serve, I’m living the opportunity to serve the community. I love my husband and stand by him, but this situation will not impact my ability or the ability of my office to continue upholding the law and serving the people we are sworn to serve.”\n\nJefferson County Sheriff Mark Pettway’s office said because this is an ongoing personnel matter, they can’t comment.\n\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here."
