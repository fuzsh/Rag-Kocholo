        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - Newly-obtained personnel records related to the attempted firing of Jefferson County Lt. Jude Washington show the sheriff’s office first suspended Washington after a hearing back in December, then fired him after a second hearing in early January, but the beginning of the rift between Washington and the sheriff’s office started last August.\n\nThat’s when, according to the disciplinary recommendation, Washington and two other deputies visited a federal prisoner in Atlanta as part of a drug investigation. Washington had been assigned to a federal drug task force for several years. According to these records, the inmate Washington was talking to mentioned he had made money in bingo, and referred to someone who worked for their operation. The records say Washington told this defendant he wasn’t interested in bingo because his wife, District Attorney Lynniece Washington, had received criticism from people involved with bingo, and the defendant replied that someone whose name is redacted in the report, believed Lynniece Washington was responsible for shutting down bingo parlors in parts of Jefferson County.\n\nFor context, Sheriff Pettway’s brother Bruce Pettway is a businessman who sued Attorney General Steve Marshall in 2022 claiming he was unfairly targeted when Marshall seized money from a bank account belonging to Bruce Pettway as part of an illegal gambling investigation.\n\nThe record claims Jude Washington later failed part of a polygraph when asked if Sheriff Pettway was mentioned in the drug case interview and Washington said no, but later admitted that the conversation about Pettway and the bingo issue took about 20 seconds and then was dead.\n\nFor this, the sheriff’s office found Jude Washington used his position for personal advantage and made false statements.\n\nThen in October, a separate notice of disciplinary action alleges Jude Washington reached out to a woman on Facebook and arranged a meeting where he said he could help her with her federal case.\n\nSources tell WBRC the woman, whose name is redacted in this report, is Varrie Kindall - State Rep. John Rogers’ former personal assistant who’s been indicted on multiple federal charges and accused of helping to orchestrate a kickback scheme where she and Rogers allegedly got hundreds of thousands in state tax dollars meant for local nonprofit groups.\n\nAt that October meeting, the disciplinary report claims Washington brought up a 1966 Ford Mustang Sheriff Pettway bought with county money and said he would help her find it. The report says Washington texted information about the car including a picture and bill of sale to the woman, then told her he would tell the FBI that she had helped him get the information and says he followed through by calling the FBI to tell them about the car. The sheriff’s office says that car was purchased to promote domestic violence awareness. The department claims Washington recorded that first meeting with the woman without her knowledge and says Washington later admitted he submitted that recording of the conversation to the FBI without her permission, all as part of an alleged attempt to help the FBI launch an investigation of Sheriff Pettway.\n\nIn his written response to these allegations, Jude Washington says, in part: “Over the past several months I have been subjected to harassment and retaliation by this department. I broke no rules, I did not violate any policies.”\n\nHe later says about that jailhouse interview: “I did not seek out that information, I was not interested in that information, and I did not follow up on that information, which involved a relative of the sheriff but had no bearing on the investigation I was conducting. I reported this information as a matter of course, but let me emphasize that I did not do so in a manner that would have prompted myself or others to conduct an inquiry into the Sheriff or his relatives.”\n\n“However, the mere fact that the subject of my jailhouse interview made unsolicited comments to me about the Sheriff and his family sparked an internal affairs investigation into my performance....the magnitude of the retaliation against me for having heard those unsolicited allegations is both enormous and entirely improper. I broke no rules, I violated no policies, yet my 18-year career lies in ruins, subjected to unjust retaliation and harassment through no fault of my own.”\n\nWashington is appealing his dismissal and the Jefferson County Personnel Board is scheduled to hear that case in April.\n\nThe Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office says this is a personnel matter, and they don’t comment on those.\n\nLynniece Washington has repeatedly said this personnel action will in no way affect the working relationship between her office and the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department.\n\n“This will have absolutely no impact on my ability to do my job or interact professionally with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department,” Lynniece Washington said in an exclusive statement to WBRC when we broke the story in January. “I swore to follow and uphold the law and serve the people of this county, and that’s what I will continue to do.”\n\n“I love my husband and stand by him, but on a professional level, I will continue to execute the duties of my office as I have been,” Lynniece Washington said.\n\n“Not only am I committed to serve, I’m living the opportunity to serve the community. I love my husband and stand by him, but this situation will not impact my ability or the ability of my office to continue upholding the law and serving the people we are sworn to serve.”\n\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here."
