        "text": "Safia is a sophomore studying media art and design in Middlesex County College and is planning on transferring in the next year to a 4 year school to pursue fine arts education and graphic design. She first got involved with Multiplying Good as a 6th grader in her school where she was an active member of Students in Action. She carried on being a part of her SIA team throughout high school and joined the Think Big Team in her junior year of high school. Soon she became the head of the previous Communications committee of the Think Big Team and is now on the Executive Council of the TBT as the VP of Marketing and Communication. Outside of the Think Big Team her service passion focuses on racial equality and mental health as both play a big impact in her life.\n\nNoreen Singh is a first-generation Pakistani-Fijian American who is the first in her family to earn a Master's degree. She is currently in her second year at California State University, Stanislaus studying Marriage and Family Therapy. Noreen has been part of the Multiplying Good family for over 10 years now. She has hosted and led over 40 service events and conferences. Her love and passion for service and volunteerism are illuminated in all aspects of her life. She is very passionate about education, mental health, diversity, and advocating for equality and equity for people of color. She strives to empower and inspire others to make a change in their community and accomplish their goals and dreams no matter what may come.\n\nMaddie is a junior at the Academy for Arts, Science, and Technology in Myrtle Beach, SC for the Pre-Medicine program. She is involved in many different activities, such as the Tree Huggers Club oriented towards helping the planet, HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America), multiple Honor Societies, and is a founding member of her school's Students In Action program. Through her SIA chapter, she has worked to give children with special needs a bigger voice in the school system, along with hosting an end-of-year prom for those students who wouldn't be comfortable or safe attending their schools traditional proms. Through this service project, done during the beginning of COVID-19, Maddie was able to stretch her skills as both a leader and a coordinator, as adapting to the ever-changing situation during the first year was a good preface of what was to come: hard work and a wonderful, promising outlook on future service projects.\n\nAbigail Verino is a first generation Filipina-American who is a third-year student at the University of California, Berkeley obtaining two Bachelor of Arts degrees in Ethnic Studies & Legal Studies.\n\nThrough servant leadership, Abigail has been able to find her passion for charity, echoed through her volunteerism in public service, community events, and through starting her own nonprofit. She aims to increase the dialogue for social justice, and the diversity and equity inclusion of minorities through education, providing individuals with better education resources on the topic of sexual violence prevention, especially now serving as an Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) Senator-Elect at UC Berkeley.\n\nAbigail has been involved with Multiplying Good for over six years. Her SIA team was recognized with the Gold Banner in 2021, and was selected to represent the San Francisco Bay Area in 2022 at the National Youth Conference in Indiana. Abigail was formerly a Students in Action Site Facilitator Intern at UC Berkeley from 2022-2023, and was featured on KPIX CBS Bay Area News via news article and news segment on October 2022. She was also the student speaker at the KPIX CBS Bay Area News Jefferson Awards Ceremony in spring 2023. Abigail now serves as the Vice President of Membership on the Think Big Team, the youth advisory board of Multiplying Good.\n\nAbigail moves with compassion and is extremely dedicated to her craft of service. She is a servant leader who wants to make love visible to the people she serves, reminding every individual that they are capable of becoming their own leaders to further create change and impact in their own communities, and to lead with love.\n\nMy name is Caleb Richardson and I am so honored to be a part of the Think Big Team this year! I am a High School Junior from Easley, South Carolina where I attend Wren High School. I have been a member of my high schoolâ€™s SIA team for 3 years and have extremely enjoyed my experience in collaborating with Multiplying Good. Another fun fact about me is that I run Track and Cross Country for Wren High School and our team was the 2022 AAA Track and Field State Champions. I look forward to improving my community service skills and impacting the nation as a part of this team.\n\nI am in my sophomore year at El Camino High School and currently have the privilege to serve as SIA President after being a part of the team for one year! I am very passionate about guiding others as they discover who they are and who they want to be, and am currently working on a Student Athletes Program service project for my school to promote inclusivity and teamwork amongst student athletes and students with intellectual disabilities. Outside of Multiplying Good, I have been a part of the ASB class for four years at both my middle and high school, and also have volunteered with Old Skool Cafe and Special Olympics, in which both organizations sit very close to my heart. Old Skool Cafe has given me the opportunity to get to know at-risk youth who get another chance at life through working in the restaurant business that happens to be a 1920s speakeasy. Through the organization, I have been able to work with and connect with many inspirational individuals who have completely altered my perspective on what it truly is to be a leader and have dreams turn into reality. Working with Special Olympics and coaching the spring Bocce team opened my senses and helped me see how magical it is watching people work together, even if it be through a sports team.\n\nI am a senior at Fort Cherry High School and plan to study Public Relations with a minor in Spanish at Coastal College University. I am involved in many different activities, such as the Fashion Club, which I founded, National Honor Society since my sophomore year, and I am the founding member of my school's Students In Action program. Through our SIA chapter, I applied for and received a $500 mental health grant from Staunton Farm. With these funds, my team and I were able to host 5 active workshops for students, in grades 7-12, to teach how to have an awareness mindset to achieve success academically, emotionally, socially, and with personal skills. I love the passion for service that Multiplying Good has and I am grateful to be part of making a difference in the people and community around me.\n\nRaahim Hashmi is a freshman at Duke University, majoring in Public Policy and Political Science on a pre-law track. Passionate about advocating for the underprivileged and providing equitable resources for all, Raahim has demonstrated a commitment to service and leadership from an early age.\n\nSince his freshman year of high school, Raahim has been actively involved with Multiplying Good, serving as a member of his Students in Action (SIA) team. He was chosen to serve as President of his SIA team during his junior and senior years where he transformed the team into a 501(c)(3). Under his guidance, his team won Gold in New Jersey twice and earned Bronze and Silver at the national level in 2022 and 2023.

During this time, she helped to lead and organize several projects that served as fundraisers for Cancer of Many Colors, a local charity that works to support those fighting cancer in their community, as well as for the St. Baldrickâ€™s Pediatric Cancer Foundation. As she moves into a new chapter of her life, she is excited to explore different service opportunities in her new community and utilize the skills she learned in Students In Action to make an impact. She is honored to serve alongside other young leaders from around the country to continue to multiply the good throughout the next generation of servant leaders.\n\nChase is a passionate advocate for service and equality. During high school, Chase was deeply involved with Students In Action, leading as President in his senior year, and has since continued to impact his community through extensive LGBTQ+ activism. Notably, he coordinated with representatives and submitted anti-discrimination bill proposals, advocating tirelessly on the floor of the Florida House of Representatives. Additionally, Chase has dedicated the past five years to shaping economic and environmental public policy for his local municipal government in Florida, focusing on sustainable development and community growth. Currently, Chase is a senior at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Economics with concentrations in Finance and Real Estate, alongside a minor in Ancient History from the College of Arts and Sciences. Beyond his academic pursuits, Chase has furthered his commitment to service by founding Innovative College Prep, an online platform aimed at increasing access to higher education and top colleges for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds.
