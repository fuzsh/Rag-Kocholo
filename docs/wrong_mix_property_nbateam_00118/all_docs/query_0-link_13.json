        "text": "FILE THIS ONE under ‘really important news’.\n\nAt 6’10 and 290 pounds, Utah Jazz big man Al Jefferson needs a larger bed than the rest of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this 120-square-foot behemoth might be overkill. Jefferson’s teammate Mo Williams tweeted out a photo from inside the bed itself earlier this week. Keep in mind that Williams is six-feet tall:\n\nAs SB Nation points out, Jazz writer Spencer Hall originally broke the news that Jefferson owns this monster last week. He tweeted out a shipping invoice sent to Jefferson for more than $23,000, and noted that the bed was 12′ x 10′.\n\nMuch of the invoice is cropped out, so we can’t tell how much the bed itself cost. Jefferson has made more than $57 million in his career, and is due $15m this year. So he can afford to sleep on something larger than entire bedrooms in some NYC apartments.\n\nBut ESPN’s big documentary last week on how athletes go broke provided all sorts of horror stories about players wasting money on needless items like this. So perhaps this is an ominous sign:\n\nConor Counihan: ‘You always challenge yourself to see can you bring the team forward’\n\nLance Armstrong report: Postal Team’s doping ‘most sophisticated’ ever"
