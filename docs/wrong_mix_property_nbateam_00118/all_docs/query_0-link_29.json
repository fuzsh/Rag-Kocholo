        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY â€” Ryan Thompson made his participation in next week's Jazz training camp official by signing a nonguaranteed contract Wednesday.\n\nWith multiple posts on his Twitter account, Thompson enthusiastically announced the deal that is necessary for him to participate in camp, as the Deseret News previously reported he would.\n\n\"Officially signed and a part of the Utah Jazz,\" he first wrote.\n\nThompson, a 6-foot-6 swingman and younger brother of Sacramento's Jason Thompson, worked out for the Jazz prior to the NBA Draft this past June.\n\nThe undrafted Rider product, who averaged 17.2 points as a senior, previously turned down an offer to participate in fall camp with the Kings.\n\nFrom his tweets at @RyT5, Thompson seems excited to be in Utah, calling his signing \"a MAJOR step forward\" and declaring that he hopes to make \"this is my new home for more than a little (while).\"\n\nThe 22-year-old will be among a handful of players in camp with nonguaranteed contracts. That group will likely include Jazz players Sundiata Gaines and Othyus Jeffers, rookie Jeremy Evans and ex-Syracuse forward Demetris Nichols, among possible others.\n\nNewcomers Gordon Hayward, Raja Bell, Al Jefferson, Francisco Elson and Earl Watson will all enter camp with guaranteed contracts.\n\nA second source confirmed that Watson, a veteran point guard, will sign with the Jazz this week. That deal is expected to be finalized by Friday.\n\nIt's still up in the air whether Kyrylo Fesenko will also be at camp, which begins Tuesday after a media day Monday. The 7-foot-1 center appears to have lost one potential suitor, though. The Cleveland Cavaliers are no longer among the multiple NBA teams that reportedly have interest in the big Ukrainian, according to The (Ohio) News-Herald.\n\nFesenko has until Oct. 1 to sign the $1.1 million, one-year qualifying offer tendered by the Jazz this offseason. Utah owns matching rights, should another NBA team sign him to an offer sheet by then. He would remain a restricted free agent if he does not sign with the Jazz or another NBA team by the expiration date of his current offer."
