        "text": "Who are the best Utah Jazz of all time? Originally based in New Orleans, the Jazz moved to Utah in 1979, which explains its confusing team name. When the team was in New Orleans, players like Gail Goodrich and Pete Maravich were standout players for the Jazz in its early years. Upon the move to Utah, the Jazz have been a model of stability. Within 10 years of playing in Salt Lake City, the Jazz had two of the best players in NBA history on its roster in Karl Malone and John Stockton. As these two Hall of Famers matured, the Jazz became one of the best teams in the NBA. Malone and Stockton went to numerous All Star Games and are one of the most celebrated duos of all time.\n\nWhile Malone and Stockton led the team, there were various other standout players who played supporting roles. Mark Eaton, Jeff Hornacek and Byron Russell are among the best players in Jazz history to have been with the team during its glory years. The team made the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, but fell short against Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls.\n\nMore recently, some of the best players in Jazz history have been Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles and Bojan Bogdanovich, who currently make up Utah's strong core.\n\nVote up the best Utah Jazz of all time, or rerank this list as you think it should look so it reflects who you think should be considered the greatest Utah Jazz player of all time."
