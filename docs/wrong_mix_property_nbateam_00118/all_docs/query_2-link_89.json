        "text": "The high-profile 2015 shooting death of a Jefferson County man at the hands of his wife and their pastor will be featured this week on NBC’s Dateline.\n\nThe killing happened one February night at the couple’s Banks Street home after they got home church and dinner at Milo’s.\n\nAfter shooting Michael Reese in the head, Cindy Kaye Henderson Reese went to Piggly Wiggly to buy groceries and returned to their home, turned the coffee table upside down as part of an attempt to stage a robbery and then finally called 911.\n\nAuthorities said there had been forced entry into the home and, within a month, Reese was charged with murder, alongside her then-boyfriend and pastor, Jeffery David Brown. Investigators learned that Cindy was having an affair with Brown. They plotted to kill her husband so they could be together.\n\nThe episode, titled “Even the Devil Went to Church” airs Friday, October 23 at 10 p.m./9 p.m. CT.\n\n\"In the small town of Morris, Alabama, faith is a way of life. But when resident Michael Reese is murdered in his home, rumors involving a local pastor begin to swirl as the truth ends up turning the community upside down,'' the preview reads.\n\nThe show will include interviews with Jefferson County sheriff’s retired Sgt. Brian Streit, Lt. Ellen Scheirer and others involved in the case. The Reese murder has previously been highlighted on other crime shows, including Investigation Discovery and in a 2018 episode of “Snapped,” on the Oxygen network.\n\nCindy married Michael in 2009, after her first husband killed himself. In her 2016 trial, Cindy said she and Brown began to have an affair in 2013 after he became the senior pastor at Sardis Baptist Church, where Cindy was the minister of music.\n\nThroughout 2014, the Brown family and the Reese family became close friends. The Reeses often babysat Brown’s two children, Cindy testified. She admitted to having a savings account with Brown, and having her name on his title of his vehicle and the lease to his apartment; however, she said she only let him use her credit, and she never paid any bills associated with the car or the apartment.\n\nWhile Brown said the affair never became physical, Cindy said the two began to have sex in the spring of 2014. The sexual nature of their relationship lasted until the fall of that year, when Cindy and Michael went on a trip to Disney World and reconnected. Cindy said Brown called her constantly throughout her trip. “Jeff wouldn’t leave me alone and let me enjoy my vacation,” she testified.\n\nWhen Cindy returned home from Disney World, she said the physical part of her affair ended but she continued to speak to Brown on a daily basis. On February 18, 2015, Cindy said she went to lunch with Brown to help him with some of his divorce paperwork. After he dropped her back off at work, Michael picked her up. The couple went to her mother’s house and then to church. She and Michael went to Milo’s, and while on the way home, Reese told her husband that she needed a few groceries from Piggly Wiggly.\n\nShe said she helped her husband take the food inside, and she left to go to the grocery store. Police investigators said when they arrived on the scene later that night, there was a Piggly Wiggly bag containing ham and orange juice in the home. Cindy said she met Brown at a gas station about 10 minutes away, where she gave him $15 for gas, and then went to Piggly Wiggly. She denies giving Brown a gun or jewelry at the gas station, which was his testimony in court.\n\nWhen Cindy returned home, she testified, the coffee table was turned on its side and the front room of the house was in disarray. She then picked up the house phone, backed outside the home, and called 911. She said she never saw her husband lying, dead, by the back door of the home.\n\n911 tapes revealed Cindy was talking to another person when the line connected and telling the other person her phone was about to die. According to the prosecution and cell phone records, she was talking to Brown.\n\nBrown testified about his relationship with Reese and her frequent comments about killing her husband. He claimed Cindy said on multiple occasions that she would either shoot or poison her husband and plead insanity if she was charged in his death.\n\nMichael had a $50,000 life insurance policy. Reese was the first beneficiary. FBI officials said Cindy called Brown 11 times between the morning of Feb. 18, 2015 and the morning of Feb. 19. Brown called Cindy seven times.\n\nUltimately, Brown pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received a 20-year prison sentence as part of his plea agreement to testify against Reese. He remains behind bars at Staton Correctional Facility and will be eligible for parole consideration in 2023.\n\nCindy in 2017 was found guilty in her husband’s slaying and sentenced to four decades in prison. However, last year it was discovered that less than three years into her 40-year sentence, she was moved from Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women to a work-release program in Birmingham. The center was within walking distance to those who had investigated and prosecuted her, within a short drive to Michael’s still-grieving family and the transfer was carried out without notification to any of them about what had been decided.\n\nBacklash over that move sent Cindy back to Tutwiler. Her first parole consideration will be in 2030."
