        "text": "English and Welsh: patronymic meaning âDafydd's (son)â, equivalent to Welsh ap Dafydd, the Welsh form of David . The spelling Davis is more typical in southwestern England northwards as far as Lancashire, where the frequency of the surname largely reflects Welsh migration, but may sometimes represent a native English surname based on Davy (compare Davies ). Davis (including in the sense 2 below) is the eighth most frequent surname in the US. It is also very common among African Americans.\n\nHistory: John Davis or Davys (c. 1550â1605) was an English navigator who searched for the Northwest Passage. â By the 18th century there were numerous persons named Davis in America, including the jurist John Davis, born in 1761 in Plymouth, MA, and Henry Davis, a clergyman and college president, who was born in 1771 in East Hampton, NY. â Jefferson Davis, born in 1808 in KY, was president of the Confederate States of America from 1861 to 1865."
