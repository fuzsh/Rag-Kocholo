SiteGround is a web hosting company founded in 2004 by a few university friends. In most recent data, it reports servicing more than 1,800,000 domains worldwide. It provides shared hosting, cloud hosting and dedicated servers as well as email hosting and domain registration.

As several users experience speed problems using SobiPro on their servers we asked Siteground to test SobiPro on their servers.

Daniel Kanchev, Senior Technical Support Engineer at Siteground and known as a Joomla! performance specialist, tested SobiPro versions 1.0 and 1.1 with a database of 100.000 SobiPro entries.

His conclusion: "The new version of SobiPro is great and it works much faster. We can host small-medium SobiPro sites on our servers without any issues. We can also create custom VPS solutions for big SobiPro sites."

Joomla! and SobiPro run much faster when hosted by Siteground. They achieve this amazing speed increase thanks to a special server architecture, multiple server locations, and their unique Joomla! caching mechanism.
