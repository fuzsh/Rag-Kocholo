SiteGround was founded in 2004, and now serves more than 800,000 customers and their domains. The hosting provider offers shared hosting, cloud hosting, dedicated hosting and WordPress hosting, with servers located in Chicago, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, and Milan. SiteGround is also one of three hosting providers recommended by WordPress.

One of the major benefits of hosting your site with SiteGround is its solution for monitoring and reacting to reduced website speed. When SiteGround recognizes your site is underperforming, its technology locates and fixes the bug to keep your site performing at optimum speed. Additionally, the company offers managed WordPress hosting on all plans.

SiteGround’s cPanel is also jam-packed with extras for user convenience. It allows you to reference and manage quick stats on storage, inode usage, emails, monthly transfers, subdomains, parked domains, addon domains, FTP accounts and loads more.

SiteGround Packages and Pricing

SiteGround has a transparent pricing structure, and all hosting packages come standard with:

24/7 support

Free WordPress and Joomla app installs

Free email accounts

Unmetered traffic

Free SSL certificate

cPanel & SSH

Free website builder

SSD storage

30-day money back guarantee

Free daily backup

Free Cloudflare CDN

Unlimited MySQL DB

For all of this, you’ll pay just $3.95/month but have the option to upgrade your plan and add a host of additional paid and free features such as priority tech support.

Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is perfect for small business owners and even franchise owners who manage multiple websites. This hosting option puts each domain under one roof for immediate access.

The one downside to shared hosting is that it is not designed for high-traffic websites. So, when your website exceeds over 10,000 hits per day, it will begin to slow down on a shared hosting plan. Consequently, you might want to consider managed or other forms of hosting that are better suited for a great deal of traffic (anything over 10,000 visits a day).

SiteGround offers three levels for shared hosting: Startup, GrowBig and GoGeek. They are all low-cost and are accompanied by a range of features for users — a perfect opportunity for small business owners on a budget.

A one-month trial can also be purchased, for the same monthly price as advertised on annual plans, but you will be charged an additional $14.95 setup fee. The advertised monthly price remains the same no matter the length of your plan (12/24/36 months). However, the price per month is only valid for the initial invoiced term, after which, regular renewal prices apply. Let’s dive into a detailed outline of what you’ll get with each hosting service.

Cloud Hosting

SiteGround’s cloud hosting is swift and customizable. Though SiteGround’s cloud hosting plans are slightly more expensive than those of their competitors, is vital to note that you’ll benefit from advanced features such as enhanced security and 24/7 VIP support.

The company’s cloud hosting services come in four neatly bundled packages: Entry, Business, Business Plus and Super Power.

Plans start at $80.00 and cap at $240.00 — there’s even the option to create your own plan. We can’t say this enough, SiteGround’s Cloud Hosting option is seriously one of the most customizable on the market. Like any other premium service, the more it is enhanced, the more expensive the plan becomes.

At the same time, you must realize that you are also purchasing peace of mind in the form of security. This is because Cloud Hosting is among one of the most secure forms of hosting.

The longer the terms of your hosting plan, the cheaper it’ll become. Here’s a breakdown of pricing for one, three, six and twelve months of service for SiteGround’s Cloud Hosting:

SiteGround also features integration for other platforms like Magento, Drupal and Joomla, offering 1-click installation for the latter as well.

Dedicated Hosting

Dedicated hosting is a great option for those who want to have faster speed. It also comes with the comfort of knowing data are stored on a server reserved especially for them. This sort of reassurance is priceless.

SiteGround’s dedicated hosting is offered in three levels: Entry Server, Power Server, and Super Power Server. Each of them has their own unique nuances that make them perfect for small business owners who are looking for faster speeds, reliability and expecting high traffic to their website.

Last, it is imperative that you take into account the required one-time fee of $99.00 for setup.

WordPress Hosting

SiteGround is unique in that it offers managed WordPress hosting with all of its plans, no matter the type of hosting. The 1-click WordPress installation and free site transfer come standard on all plans, whilst the SuperCacher plugin is offered for free on all plans above StartUp. Users who purchase a GoGeek, any cloud hosting or any dedicated hosting plan also have access to WP staging and Git integration.
