SiteGround Performance

It is undeniable that a web host should deliver optimum performance. Better performance is something you cannot ignore nor compromise when choosing a web-hosting service.

Note that even a one-second delay in page loading results in an 11% loss in view and a 7% loss in conversion rate. Another study by Google says one to three seconds of load delay increases the bounce rate by 32%. Moreover, speed is an essential factor for a better ranking of your site on Google.

Lucky for you, SiteGround delivers some of the best performance offered by many web-hosting companies. The average page load time in SiteGround is under a second (around 649 ms). The server load time remains almost constant even during peak traffic requests. Also, the server response time is under a second, even with high-resolution images on the site.

Thus, if you want to build a super-fast website with a better response time, SiteGround can be a perfect option. Moreover, with a simple control panel layout, any level user can get along with SiteGround easily.

Pros and Cons of SiteGround

Nothing is perfect in this world. Everything has its benefits and flaws. The same goes for the SiteGround. This section will talk about the pros and cons of using SiteGround as your web hosting partner.

Pros of SiteGround

Below are the major benefits of using SiteGround:

1. Pricing Plan

SiteGround offers an affordable pricing plan to suit any user, especially for running a new website.

Originally, SiteGround tagged the StartUp web-hosting services at $14.99 per month. Now they have brought it down to $6.99 per month. You get pretty much everything for running a single website at this price.

You get 10GB storage, free SSL certificate, daily backup, WP auto-updates, and much more. At $6.99 a month, it is a good deal for a beginner.

2. Uptime

Under the Service Level Agreement (SLA), SiteGround guarantees an uptime network of 99.99% annually. This means that if the uptime dips below the threshold, the company compensates as follows:

99.99% to 99.00% uptime – one month of free hosting services.

For every 1% drop below 99.00% uptime – an additional month of free hosting services.

However, there are certain exceptions to this uptime compensation policy. The company is not liable to compensate for uptime drops under the following conditions:

Scheduled maintenance

Emergency maintenance

Any hardware and software failure is resolved under an hour

Downtime caused by IP address o/or DNS changes you have been pre-notified, but you failed to set configurations

Hacker attacks, DDOS (Distributed Denial of service) attacks, and other similar events

Downtime is caused due to your configuration or any third-party applications that you use

Downtime time is caused when you exceed the highest resource allocation for your chosen plan

The violation of the TOS causes downtime.

Downtime during upgrade/downgrade of your Cloud or Dedicated Server resources

Downtime during the processing of your technical support request(s)

Any event beyond the company’s control

3. Host Page Load Time

The host page loading time is the second most crucial factor that decides your website’s success or failure.

SiteGround has the latest hardware like SSD disks and software solutions, like SG Optimizer and HTTP/2, to offer an above-average loading time of 673ms.

4. Good Customer Support and Assistance

SiteGround provides excellent customer support. They offer 24/7 live chat and phone support to their customers.

They also provide high-quality tutorials and guides for customers, which helps them find their quick answers.

5. Multiple Server Locations

SiteGround has data centers in Asia, Australia, America, and Europe. You can choose between the server locations you prefer during the signup.

6. Free Content Delivery Network (CDN) and SSL Certificate

SiteGround provides instant setup of Cloudflare CDN. Cloudflare CDN stores large files on many servers in various locations. This makes sure that the visitors can have faster access to those files from the closest server.

SiteGround offers free integration with Let’s Encrypt for SSL Certificate. SSL protects any kind of information that is sent between the user’s device and the website.

7. Free Site Migration for One Website

SiteGround has created the free WordPress Migration plugin, which you can upload to any website. Using this plugin, you can migrate multiple websites at once.

But if you want SiteGround support agents to take care of your website migration, they will provide free service on their higher plans. But after you exceed the limits on each plan, you’ll have to pay $30 each for additional sites.

Cons of SiteGround

Below are the major drawbacks of using SiteGround:

1. Limited Storage

SiteGround offers only 10 GB of Web Space in its lowest sharing plan to handle around 10,000 monthly visits. This storage is sufficient only for smaller sites or if you’re starting a new one.

However, once the site starts growing bigger, its performance is going to suffer. You will have to upgrade the storage according to their package for increased resources and better performance.

2. No Free Domain Name

Most web hosts provide a free domain name to their customers for the first year. Unfortunately, SiteGround does not offer it.

SiteGround will charge you around $15.95 per year starting from day one if you don’t have a domain name already.

3. Higher Rates for Monthly Renewal

SiteGround’s lowest sharing plan is around $6.99 per month. However, they will charge you double when it is time to renew it. It means that this rate hikes up to $14.99 per month if you choose to renew it monthly.

However, if you sign up for the longest term, you will get a good discount and use it at a lower rate. We recommend signing up for the longest term as SiteGround has the 30-day money-back policy on all their hosting plans.
