        "text": "I've been a customer of SiteGround since 2015, and this is my personal and unbiased review of the service I've received over the last six years!\n\nNow, I'm well aware that there are literally hundreds of reviews of SiteGround already in existence. However, this review is different. At least I'd like to think so.\n\nHow and why?\n\nThis is my personal review of SiteGround. I'm an actual user, a paying customer of the service provided by SiteGround. My review is not just from a technical or statistical viewpoint, though I will share some stats and facts with you, but really more from a user's perspective.\n\nIf you're looking for a more technical review, I'm sure you can find some if you do a search in Google. If you're using an alternative web hosting service provider and are thinking about moving to SiteGround, hopefully, you'll find this review useful.\n\nLet's begin.\n\nWho are SiteGround?\n\nIf you didn't already know, SiteGround is one of the most popular web hosting providers in the business. Unlike many other web hosting companies out there, they are not a subsidiary company of a parent company. Siteground is an independent hosting provider. They are pretty well known in the WordPress community.\n\nThe company was founded by tech entrepreneur Tenko Nikolov in 2004. SiteGround today is made up of over 400 passionate entrepreneurs/employees and hosts more than 1.8 million domains.\n\nThe company continues to grow and is now one of the top-recommended web host providers for the WordPress open-source software (WordPress.org). Check out SiteGround and the company's 'about page' to learn more.\n\nWhat SiteGround has to offer?\n\nIn a nutshell, SiteGround offers affordable, reliable, and secure web hosting for website owners, businesses, and bloggers.\n\nTheir shared web hosting fees start from just $6.99 per month (Usually $14.99), which makes them one of the most affordable solutions out there, though we'll talk more about pricing later on in this review.\n\nHere's a quick overview of what SiteGround has to offer -\n\nShared Web Hosting (Great for starting your website or blog)\n\nManaged WordPress Hosting\n\nManaged WooCommerce Hosting (Ideal for selling online)\n\nManaged Scalable Cloud Hosting (For growth)\n\nSiteGround also offers Reseller Hosting, Enterprise Hosting, Dedicated Servers, and currently has data centers on 3-continents.\n\nThey also have in place hardware infrastructures and resources that provide blazing fast technology performance. This hardware list includes -\n\nSSD (Storage)\n\nNGINX\n\nSuperCacher (For fast loading)\n\nCDN (For serving your pages faster and improved website peformance)\n\nHTTP2 (For security)\n\nPHP7\n\nSSH\n\nSiteGround's list of features\n\nWay too many to list, however, some stand-out features of SiteGround's service include -\n\ncPanel\n\nWebsite management dashboard\n\nWebsite collaboration dashboard (Great for web designers and developers working on client websites.)\n\nWebsite Tools (Security, speed, domain, email, stats, dev tools.)\n\nFree email accounts\n\nAuto-installers\n\nBackup tool and manager\n\nSite-Scanner\n\nDomain transfer\n\nDedicated IP, and more.\n\nMy story with SiteGround\n\nI started my blogging journey with Bluehost, a web hosting company I reviewed here. I was going through a bit of a bad patch with Bluehost, experiencing frequent downtimes and complete outages. Naturally, as you do, I decided to vent some of that frustration on my Twitter account.\n\nHad I not done so, I wouldn't be using SiteGround today. Because, as well as Bluehost noticing tweet, one of the representatives of SiteGround at the time also noticed my tweet. They reached out to offer me an alternative solution, that solution being to migrate my blog to SiteGround.\n\nAfter a quick chat online, I signed up for the GrowBig Plan, and they took care of everything. They even migrated my websites over from Bluehost. See the image below.\n\nAs the story goes, I've not looked back since. Here we are in 2021 and I'm still proudly using SiteGround.\n\nWhat do I like most about SiteGround WordPress Hosting?\n\nOK, here goes -\n\n1. The SiteGround Website and user interface\n\nThe SiteGround website has improved over the years. The dated-looking dashboard has been replaced with a nice clean user interface with improved navigation and new features.\n\n2. Optimized for WordPress Users\n\nSince everything that I do online involves WordPress, I love that SiteGround offers a WordPress hosting plan optimized for WordPress!\n\nThe SSD and dynamic caching technology SiteGround has in place gives WordPress users blazing fast loading times.\n\n3. The Support Team\n\nI've not once had a bad experience with the SiteGround support team. Maybe I've just been lucky, Just kidding. Honestly, I cannot fault their support structure.\n\nI've only been in touch with SiteGround support a few times regarding a few small issues, which they've happily help solve for me.\n\nIn fact, recently, I got in touch with SG customer care because I was experiencing a problem with my broken website (CSS not loading issues), and they helped me solve the problem quickly.\n\nAnother occasion was when I had issues with Cloudflare. And just to prove I'm not making any of this up just to give praise to SiteGround, here's a screenshot of the transcript!\n\n4. Knowledgebase\n\nThe SiteGround FAQ page and knowledge-base is packed with a lot of useful advice and guides. It's very good, however, it could be better. It would be nice to see SiteGround use videos to explain how some of their tools and features work.\n\nAnyhow, from hosting, cPanel, applications, billing, there's plenty of helpful 'written' content to dig into.\n\n5. Technology\n\nSiteGround hosting boasts a host of impressive features and technology including, SSD on all plans, one-click WordPress installation for non-hosting-techies (like me), Let's Encrypt free SSL, Cloudflare CDN service, the latest PHP7, and website migration service.\n\n6. Performance\n\nIn the six years period that I've used SiteGround, I've experienced zero downtime.\n\nThe very reason I left my last hosting provider, Bluehost, was because of the downtime as you know.\n\nHaving cutting-edge technology allows SiteGround to provide optimum-performance web hosting for all their customers. So, in a none-techy world, this means -\n\n99.9% uptime... Translates to 100% uptime in my experience.\n\nBlazing fast website response time.\n\nYou can view the latest speed and uptime status here.\n\nHere's a screenshot of the page speed test that I ran for my site Magnet4Blogging.net on SiteGround, using Pingdom Website Tools.\n\nNow, of course, I realize there are other factors that come into play when measuring page loading time. But this is a good start.\n\nMy WordPress blog, as of April 2021, runs on Oxygen Builder 3.6 and has 29 active plugins installed.\n\nThe simple pricing plans for their shared hosting make it perfect to choose the right hosting plan for your needs.\n\nWhen I originally signed up back in 2015, I took out the GrowBig plan, and only then upgraded to GoGeek. In 2019, my blogs and websites had outgrown this plan and I moved over to SiteGround Cloud Hosting.\n\nRecommended: Check out my SiteGround Cloud Hosting Review.\n\nIf you're just starting out, SiteGround's pricing tier makes it perfect for taking out the right plan. And as your website grows, you can scale up your hosting requirements accordingly.\n\nWhat do I least like about SiteGround?\n\nIt's actually hard for me to pick one thing that I don't like about using SiteGround, let alone a bunch of them.\n\nI'm not that technically minded when it comes to web hosting, so I guess I'm one of those users who's honestly and generally all-around happy with the service received.\n\nIf like me, your focus is on growing your business, you don't want to be spending all your time and energy getting into the technical ins and outs of your web hosting provider. I'm not that interested, to be frank. I just want it to work, and it does.\n\nI don't expect any web hosting company to be 100% perfect, so if I had to be really nit-picky, here's what I don't like about SiteGround; however, I can live with -\n\nKnowledge-base is thin in content - While their knowledge base is great, some of their tutorials can be a little on the thin side. Some screen captures, infographics, or videos included in the tutorial pages would be awesome. At the moment, some of their guides contain a single screen capture. Some have just one paragraph of content.\n\nPrice bump on renewal - If you signup with SiteGround at a discounted rate for the first year, don't be surprised to be greeted with a hefty price bump for the renewal year. It happens, and I'll talk more about this later.\n\nWould I recommend SiteGround WordPress Hosting to others?\n\nAbsolutely, wholeheartedly, yes. I can't be any more honest and transparent than that.\n\nAt the end of the day, not everyone is a tech guru. As I said earlier, most people just want a reliable hosting provider that can get on with the job of hosting their blog or small business website with ease, reliability, and rock-solid security.\n\nSiteGround does just that and much more.\n\nI run all of my online businesses on SiteGround. So that's the Magnet4Blogging blog, my eCommerce business, my freelance website, my online course, and several Amazon niche sites.\n\nHow much does SiteGround cost and how does the price compare to other web host providers?\n\nI think most people would expect to pay a lot of money for a high-quality hosting service. I'm not saying SiteGround is the best in the business, but it's certainly amongst the best.\n\nSome hosting services are beyond affordable. Kinsta, for example, can be quite expensive in comparison. SiteGround is surprisingly affordable, but it can become expensive later on down the line.\n\nStartUp hosting plan starts from $6.99 /mo\n\nThe GrowBig plan starts from $9.99/mo\n\nGoGeek from $14.99/mo\n\nAs I said earlier, if you're signing up for the first time, just be aware that the price you pay for the first year might not be the same when renewing your hosting with SiteGround.\n\nMy hosting fees are much higher because I'm using SiteGround's Cloud Hosting at $100 per month.\n\nWhat is my overall opinion of SiteGround?\n\nSiteGround is a rock-solid hosting provider. They have knowledgeable people. Although sometimes their tech support isn't always able to solve technical problems, customer care really does care about helping you. That said, I've experienced nothing but great all-around service from SiteGround over the last six years.\n\nHowever, you might be a SiteGround customer yourself with a completely different story and opinion of the company. If that is the case, I invite you to share your own personal review of SiteGround below in the comment section, if it's open.\n\nHow do I sign up for a SiteGround WordPress hosting account?\n\nOnce you've decided on the best hosting plan for your website or blog, simply head over to SiteGround here and begin the signup process.\n\nRecommended: If you would like a detailed tutorial on creating a website or blog with SiteGround, check my post here.\n\nRecommended hosting guides\n\n5 Of The Best Web Hosting Providers For Your Business\n\nHow To Find The Best Web Host For Your WordPress Website\n\nSiteGround VS Bluehost VS HostGator"
