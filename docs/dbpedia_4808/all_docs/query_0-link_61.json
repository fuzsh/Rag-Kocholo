        "text": "Are you searching for the perfect hosting company? I will compare 1and1 Vs SiteGround, two well-respected, popular, and old web hosting services.\n\nBoth platforms have been hosting sites for over 10 years. In this review, I will compare the features, speed, support, uptime, and more.\n\nI will even help you setup your site today with a quick setup guide below.\n\nQuick intro\n\n1&1 Internet was founded in 1988 and it is a hosting company owned by United Internet. 1&1 is one of the oldest and largest web hosting companies in the world.\n\nSiteGround was founded in 2004 by university students. What started out as a small business eventually turned into a leading web hosting service provider with over 400 employees.\n\nControl panel\n\nI’m not fond of 1&1’s custom control panel. I found that it is trickier to use and you don’t get the same number of features that you are getting with a cPanel control panel. If you don’t know what cPanel is, it is the hosting industries most popular control panel.\n\nIt is the easiest control panel to use and highly recommend for believers. Most likely if you are coming from another company, you have used it before. SiteGround and all the top hosting companies use cPanel which means SiteGround is going to be easier to set up and manage.\n\nCheck out SiteGround.\n\nDomain\n\nYou will be happy to know that both hosting platforms give you a free domain when you select your hosting package. Free domains make setting up easier and they save you extra money as well.\n\nUptime comparison\n\nIt is crucial that you choose a company with a good uptime rating. Statistics show that website downtime can end up costing your business as much as $5,600 per minute.\n\nIf your site is down your reader or customer can end up becoming someone else’s reader or customer. Both hosting services are known for their high uptime. SiteGround offers a 99.99% uptime rating while 1&1 offers a 99.95% monthly uptime rating.\n\nData centers\n\n1&1 has data centers located in Europe and in Lenexa, Kansas.\n\nSiteGround has data centers in many different locations such as Chicago, USA, London, UK, Amsterdam, Netherlands, Singapore.\n\nSpeed comparison\n\nKissmetrics.com offers a great infographic on how your load speed matters. Every second counts. If I can’t access a website fast enough, then I’ll leave and go to another website. If you’re anything like me, then from experience you know it is essential to have a site that loads fast. Not only is it essential for customers, but Google uses site speed as a way to rank sites in the search engines.\n\n1&1 offers one of the slowest loading times in the industry. 1&1 offers a load response time of around 700ms which is nowhere near the top hosts. SiteGround offers a load response time of around 300ms which makes it over 100% faster than 1&1. From years of observation I found that SiteGround offers the fasting loading times in the industry.\n\nStart SiteGround at 60% off.\n\nPrice comparison\n\nThere is no denying that both companies offer web hosting for an awesome price. 1&1 is slightly cheaper. With their 12 month plan you are able to receive hosting for $0.99/month, which is one of the cheapest prices in the industry.\n\nSiteGround offers premium hosting for $3.95/mo. Although SG is cheap 1&1 is slightly cheaper.\n\nHosting features comparison\n\nSiteGround features\n\nNGINX web server technology to speed up loading times.\n\nSiteGround offers servers on three continents.\n\nLXC-based stability\n\nGeeky SuperCacher\n\nHigh level electricity redundancy.\n\nAnti-Hack Systems & Help\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nPHP7 and HHVM\n\nHTTP/2 Enabled Servers\n\nFree Let’s Encrypt SSLs\n\nFree Daily Backup\n\ncPanel & SSH Access\n\nFree Website Builder\n\nMultiple PHP Versions (7.0, 5.6, 5.5 and more)\n\n1&1 features\n\nSecurity with SSL Certificate\n\nPHP 7 + OPcache\n\n1&1 Hybrid Technology\n\nOver 120 Click&Build and Web Apps\n\nWebspace Recovery\n\nGeo-redundancy\n\nUp to 600 MB RAM\n\nMultiple redundant 65 GBit/s connectivity\n\nDDoS Protection\n\nIPS/IDS & SIEM technology\n\nGreen energy\n\nSupport\n\nBoth support teams are identical. With both hosting providers, you will be given 24/7 web hosting support. Unlike some hosting companies, with 1&1 and SG you will be given phone support, chat support, guides, and more.\n\nShort reviews from satisfied customers of each platform.\n\nSG – servestudioshosting.com – Siteground rocks. Support is unbelievable. From the easiest of questions to the most difficult, the team always manages to help with the situation and make those of us on the other end feel honored (not stupid) while doing it. Your technology is terrific, but your customer service and support are beyond measure!\n\n1&1 – queness.com – Great host. It has all the features that an average blogger like me wants. I have faced no problems yet. Their support is worth admiration. I have no programming skills, still running a stunning site. Thanks to 1&1 for their best support.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nBoth companies have their upsides, but I believe SiteGround easily tops 1&1 as the best web hosting provider in the industry. 1&1 is too slow for me to recommend it to others. SiteGround offers better uptime, better speed, it is easier to use, there are more dater center locations, and there are more features. I strongly recommend SG for your business and below I will help you to set up your site right now.\n\nCreate a website in 5 minutes!\n\n1. Click here to start SiteGround. (60% off)\n\n2. Choose your web hosting plan.\n\n3. Create a free domain.\n\n4. Complete the signup process.\n\n4. Continue and allow the WP to complete the installation process.\n\n5. Create your new WordPress login username and password and log in to your new website.\n\nQuote – The victory of success is half won when one gains the habit of setting goals and achieving them. Even the most tedious chore will become endurable as you parade through each day convinced that every task, no matter how menial or boring, brings you closer to achieving your dreams. Og Mandino"
