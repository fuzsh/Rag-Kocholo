This saves the trouble to manually update the relationships each time.\n\nThe taxonomy module in Drupal allows multiple lists of categories for classification. It offers the possibility of creating thesauri (terms with horizontal relationships) and taxonomies (terms with hierarchical relationships). Basically, the taxonomy deals with a hierarchy of information and the thesaurus deals with relationships between terms. Taxonomy is what affects how exactly the content is organized.\n\nSettings for the taxonomy module can be found in the Drupal admin area > Structure -> Taxonomy.\n\nYou can add a new vocabulary using the Add vocabulary button.\n\nThe Name field is mandatory and the Description field is optional."
