        "text": "In today’s post, I am going to review SiteGround Hosting and will try to tell you everything about SiteGround web hosting the Good and Bad:\n\nThese are the areas we will look into:\n\nSpeed Performance – Speed is essential for your website when you are running an online business. How fast your website will load with SiteGround?\n\nReliability – Will, your website be available for users 24X7/365 with 100% uptime?\n\nCustomer Support – Can you rely on SiteGround customer support?\n\nFeatures – Do they have all the features and tools that you need to run a website smoothly?\n\nPricing Plans – How much it would cost you? Does SiteGround offer any Deals or Coupons?\n\nBottom Line: Don’t have time to read the complete SiteGround hosting review? Let me help you.\n\nI’ve found SiteGround is incredibly fast and reliable. They have one of the best customer supports in the industry. Additionally, Siteground offers flexible hosting plans that suit each type of business.\n\nIt is the recommended hosting for WordPress by official WordPress.org team:\n\nBlueHost\n\nDreamHost\n\nSiteGround\n\nChoosing a web hosting gets easy by looking at the features that they offer, but you should also check whether they support your platform or not.\n\nSiteGround is one of the highest-rated hosting providers in the WordPress community. They are known for its ultimate 24X7/365 customer support.\n\nThey have more premium features that we will see in this detailed SiteGround review.\n\nThe content on your site play a significant role on page load time. For example, if you have high-resolution images on your website, it will increase the page load time of your website.\n\nThat’s the reason speed tests results often misses the actual hosting server speed.\n\nTo verify, we tested the actual server response time instead of page load time. We used Bitcatcha tool; it examines server response time and ignores page content.\n\nIt measures server response time from different locations.\n\nSiteGround servers have an incredibly fast response time. In fact, for some locations like London, server response time is as low as 1ms.\n\nYou can’t afford the downtime of a website when you are making money through an online business. If your website is down for hours, it doesn’t only make site visitors angry, but also your keyword ranking positions affect in search.\n\nIn fact, a single second delay can cause a 7% decrease in conversions, 11% fewer page views, and a 16% decrease in client satisfaction.\n\nHow can SiteGround provide 100% uptime?\n\nIt is because they are using server isolation technology on their shared hosting.\n\nIt means if a website is affected with malware and phishing attacks, it won’t affect another site on the same server.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a fast website, then SiteGround is the best hosting for you.\n\nYou already know the importance of SSL certificates, don’t you?\n\nSSL certificates increase the trustworthiness of a website and secure data transfers, credit card transactions, logins and other sensitive information. In fact, Google considers HTTPS as a ranking signal.\n\nA secure website with an SSL certificate will have an advantage over other websites that are not secure and encrypted.\n\nSiteGround web hosting provides free SSL certificates via LetsEncrypt to its all users.\n\nMySQL and PHP is important to run a WordPress site. Most hosting companies are still offering PHP 5.6 while the latest version of PHP is 7.3.\n\nYou should upgrade your PHP version because most WordPress plugins don’t support PHP 5.6 version.\n\nWith SG optimizer plugin you can quickly upgrade your PHP version from 5.6 to 7.3. Updating to the latest PHP 7.3 version can enhance your website speed up to 3-4 times faster than older versions.\n\nMost of all, the latest PHP version is more secure than the previous version.\n\nI had to shift some of my affiliate sites from the previous hosting to SiteGround.\n\nYou may ask why?\n\nThe poor customer support.\n\nThat hosting customer supports never replied to me on time. Sometimes I had to wait for 24 hours. On the contrary, from SiteGround customer support, I get a reply within minutes of raising a ticket.\n\nWhereas most hosting companies charge you $50 to $150 for website migration, this is totally free on SiteGround.\n\nYes, you heard, right.\n\nIf you are migrating from your existing hosting to Siteground, you can take benefit of their free website migration.\n\nAfter login into your SiteGround dashboard, you will see a form where you can request for site migration.\n\nYou have come this far to know whether you should buy SiteGround hosting or not? However, I have tried to explain everything with this review of SiteGround web hosting.\n\nYes, I am promoting SiteGround hosting but only, because I’ve seen website loading speed improvement and conversion on my site after shifting to SiteGround.\n\nTechnical support of SiteGround is no doubt is one of the best in the market. You will never find yourself alone at a single point; they will be with you from pre-sales to resolving technical glitches.\n\nI’m a happy SiteGround client and would like you to check out SiteGround yourself.\n\nThere is nothing to lose, and you can always get your money back within 30 days if you are not happy with SiteGround hosting services.\n\nAlso Read: Kinsta Hosting Review"
