        "text": "SiteGround – is one of those hosting providers you can’t miss. With a solid interface, one-click managed WooCommerce installation, and a reasonable pricing structure, SiteGround can be that perfect platform to rely on.

Even though it is not performed automatically, the simple guideline helps to figure out the process with no hassle. However, if you aren’t sure you will make it through, the company can provide its professional site migrating service at the cost of $30 per site.\n\nFree SSL: Any online shop hosted by SiteGround gets backed with SSL encryption completely for free. This aims at protecting the data that clients transmit through the site.\n\nFree Shopping Cart Installation: SiteGround features a click-and-install wizard to help its users choose the shopping cart software they wish and get it installed on their account right on the spot.\n\nDaily Backups: SiteGround ensures a credible backup to restore the important data. The feature is provided for free.\n\nSite Builder: SiteGround offers two site builders for free – WordPress and Weebly. If the premier one is best for those sites that plan to grow, the second one is best for inexperienced users thanks to its user-friendly drag and drop editor.\n\nCMS Optimization: SiteGround is optimized to support many PHP & MySQL-based apps. It is catered to running and installing the most popular CMS, CRM, wiki, etc. tools such as Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, and so forth.\n\nUnlimited Email Accounts: SiteGround allows users to create an unlimited number of professional email addresses with the existing domain entirely for free. Furthermore, you can give admission to the accounts to either the whole team or your employees separately.\n\nComprehensible Webmail Interface: This feature enables users to read their email from wherever they are. Moreover, SiteGround has made it possible for both you and those users you have created the accounts for to change the passwords, set forwarders, and autoresponders right from the webmail app.\n\nForwarders and Autoresponses: From the Site Tools section, you can switch on this feature and enhance your business email capabilities.\n\nSMTP, IMAP, and POP3 Protocols: SiteGround has made it possible to receive and send email messages from the domain you have already had due to the support of the mentioned protocols.\n\nCashing: Thanks to the caching functionality that SiteGround has adopted, the end-user of your site will see the latest version of the site. Furthermore, using the Cloudflare CDN, a SiteGround user gets access to multiple server locations worldwide thus delivering quick website loading for your site visitor regardless of their location.\n\nIntegrations\n\nEven though SiteGround features everything needed to set up and run a website effectively no matter whether it is a startup or a large enterprise, the company integrates with other services, too. Such integrations aim at enhancing the opportunities of SiteGround users.\n\nHere are several of them:\n\nDesktop.com: This is a centralized workspace for modern teams. It ensures better collaboration and provides an effective way to manage web-based resources and multiple teams. If you have a big team involved in your virtual project, you may find this integration highly useful. The price is $5 per user per month.\n\nDevKinsta: This is a WordPress development suite. It allows users to create, develop, and deploy WordPress websites easily with any device you have connected to it. The price is $25 per month.\n\nTrackonomics: This is an affiliate software aimed at allowing businesses to create reports in excel, measuring performance, removing any possibility of a human error, etc. With this tool, you get palpable chances of making more money with your virtual content.\n\nSiteGround Dashboard\n\nIf you are among those online store owners who prioritize the importance of a handy dashboard or Cpanel, SiteGround has something to surprise and please you with. Unlike many other hosting companies which feature clunky and outdated dashboards, SiteGround has a transformed backend interface to make sure its clients feel comfortable navigating through. This provider has amazing tools for managing things like databases, backups, email addresses, etc. As a result, it developed its site management dashboard – Client Area and Site Tools. The interface is user-friendly, features a quick top menu with the basic tools, as well as a comprehensible guide on how to get it all started. It will walk a user through the primary steps on how to launch and manage a site when hosted by SiteGround.\n\nEvery feature has a respective button to find it easily. For instance, by clicking WordPress, you can opt to create a new WordPress site instead of migrating your actual one. When doing so, you will be provided with numbered points showing each step to take to configure the new site from pointing to a domain to setting up contacts.\n\nFurthermore, there is a Success Tips and Suggestions feature in the Client Area dashboard with quick links to specific services to perform with a website and improve its performance. These are:\n\nDomain transfer\n\nStaging\n\nBacking up a site\n\nAdding collaborations and white-label access\n\nDesign and Customization\n\nSiteGround works with different CMSs with WordPress. However, in the search for the easiest site builder to cooperate with, SiteGround came up with Weebly – a powerful yet straightforward drag and drop site builder. By subscribing to any SiteGround hosting plan, a user gets the right to set up a new site completely for free. Weebly lets you create a professional-looking site without demanding any technical skills. All the content elements available are added with the use of the drag-and-drop tool. These can be images, videos, texts, and maps.\n\nWhat refers to the availability of themes and templates, users are introduced to an impressive range of themes that are all mobile responsive. The templates can look anything from bold and classic to ultra-modern and anything in between. Whichever you choose, it will come up fully mobile-optimized to fit any screen size whether launched on a PC desktop, a tablet, or a smartphone.\n\nHowever, if the opportunities of free Weebly site builder don’t satisfy you, there is always a chance to upgrade to a Starter, Pro, or Business plan.\n\nWooCommerce Tools\n\nSiteGround suggests installing a WordPress site or including a WooCommerce installation. The latter is especially beneficial if you aim to run an online store. All the configurations of the WooCommerce site are to be done from the SiteGround’s dashboard. Here you are supposed to set your email address login and password, as well as the domain name. After this, the service will install a new WordPress on its server. Once you state your domain at the new host’s servers, all the features such as running backups, making email addresses, etc. will be at your disposal.\n\nSecurity\n\nSiteGround belongs to that category of hosting companies that prioritize security. The company has adopted all the necessary tools to protect its clients’ sites against any malicious code or hack attacks that, can seriously damage the sites’ traffic and credibility.\n\nBesides the free SSL provided to all users for free irrespective of the pricing tier they have chosen, SiteGround offers an AI Anti-Bot system and custom WAF. AI anti-bot is structured to effectively block numerous security threats per day. Custom Web Application Firewall (WAF) is constantly enhanced. SiteGround writes hundreds of new security rules every year so that to stop diverse the identified application vulnerabilities which are yet unresolved.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe site speed is a metric a website developer simply can’t neglect. It affects the search engine visibility and the overall conversion rates of the website. To provide you with a successful site that generates revenue, SiteGround has developed in-house technologies. As a result, the company guarantees 99.9% uptime and meets its guarantee. Sites hosted by this provider operate super fast with no downtimes. According to the stats, more than half of people leave the site if the page doesn’t load within the first 3 seconds. The average loading time of SiteGround sites is only 651ms, which is quite a good result. Surely, the loading time is above average yet it will not result in site visitors leaving.\n\nSiteGround has incorporated such tools to back up its performance as:\n\nFree CDN option\n\nGoogle cloud that features SSD-persistent storage and speedy network\n\nSuperCacher: NGINX direct delivery of static resources, Memcache option\n\nSpeedy PHP to ensure up to 30% faster sites\n\nCustomer Support\n\nThe customer support service by SiteGround has been highly praised by both users and experts. The company registered a 97.7% customer satisfaction rate in 2020, thus winning 2 Stevie Awards for Customer Service in the Process. Despite this, we can’t describe the support of this hosting provider as easy to get in touch with. First of all, round-the-clock support is available for registered users only. And then, it is quite tricky to find a way to contact a company representative.\n\nIf you want to skip the Knowledge Base, which we shall refer to a bit later, and get human help in resolving your issue, you can choose to use the ticketing system, live chat, or phone lines options. To find the help option, you must either scroll down the page or click the Question mark on the top right of the Client Area dashboard. Through the View, Help Center click Contact Us and choose the category that best fits your issue. Now you have got to describe the problem in the text box that pops up. Only after submitting the inquiry, SiteGround will suggest you either use the self-help guide or contact the support team. Why SiteGround has hidden its award-winning customer support is a question yet to find an answer to.\n\nKnowledge Base\n\nThe Knowledge Resources and Tutorials section by SiteGround is a vast one. Here you will find a huge number of tips and guides all built with newbies in mind. They provide step-by-step instructions supported with screenshots. So, you are sure to face no guesswork – everything is presented clearly and simply.\n\nPricing\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when characterizing the pricing system of SiteGround is affordable. And yet, when we look at what’s included in the plans, the reason for cheap hosting plans becomes apparent.\n\nSiteGround offers Web, WordPress, WooCommerce, Cloud, and Reseller Hosting plans. Each hosting plan comes in several tiers. Plans are provided in 1, 12, 24, and 36-month terms.\n\nThe price tiers for Web hosting, WordPress hosting, and WooCommerce hosting are titled as:\n\nStartUp (priced at $3.99/mo)\n\nGrowBig (priced at $6.69/mo)\n\nGoGeek (priced at $10.69/mo)\n\nThe plans for Managed Cloud hosting are:\n\nJump Start (priced at $100/mo)\n\nBusiness (priced at $200/mo)\n\nBusiness Plus (priced at $300/mo)\n\nSuper Power (priced at $400/mo)\n\nIf you are interested in obtaining a Reseller hosting plan, these go as follows:\n\nGrowBig (priced at $6.69/mo)\n\nGoGeek (priced at $10.69/mo)\n\nCloud (priced at $100/mo)\n\nEven though there is no free trial or demo version available for new users, SiteGround offers a 30-day money-back guarantee for all plans. This means that if you don’t get satisfied with the services of this provider, it will fully compensate you upon unsubscribing. Thirty days is definitely enough time to test out the host’s interface and see if it’s the right variant for you.\n\nVerdict\n\nIf you are interested in whether we recommend SiteGround as a website hosting provider or not, the answer is yes. Ever since its foundation, SiteGround has been delivering solid uptime with no major downtime issues. Thanks to the servers spread on three continents, along with a free Cloudflare CDN account, SiteGround speed is pretty good.\n\nIf you still have doubts about whether this hosting provider is what your need to run a website effectively, let’s find a solution together:\n\nDo you plan to run a WordPress or WooCommerce store and look for a quick way to install WordPress on your servers?\n\nWould you like to keep the costs low while scaling up your business with the necessary server space to meet the right amount of visitors?\n\nDo you need a website host that won’t extra charge you for automated backups, a CDN, or SSL certificates?\n\nDo you plan to make an unlimited number of email addresses for both you and your team members and don’t want to overpay for that?\n\nIf Yes is the answer to any of these questions, SiteGround is your best choice!"
