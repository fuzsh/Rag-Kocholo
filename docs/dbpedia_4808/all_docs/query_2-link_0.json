See which conferences we sponsor, where we speak, and our latest initiatives in which you can also be involved.\n\nAt SiteGround we have one main tech principle, and it’s that we like to build everything in-house. Our Software Development team consists of the engineers who craft SiteGround’s custom web-facing applications – our main website, single-page applications, like our Client Area and client Site Tools interfaces, customer service applications, CRM, and more. They work on diverse projects for both internal and client systems, and see the direct impact of their efforts on all our products and services. Driven by new technologies and best code practices, they are shaping and maintaining the SiteGround software, services, and systems used by tens of thousands of clients every day.\n\nEveryone at SiteGround shares the same devotion to deliver the best customer experience and performance of our products. That’s why the DevOps team has a special place for dedicated system test engineers who ensure that all our services and in-house products are working at their best in every use case.\n\nOur Technical Support team members are true masters when it comes to solving the most complicated client inquiries. From the first line Tech Support to Senior Supervisors, all our teammates face different technical challenges every day and help each other expand their knowledge and areas of expertise constantly.\n\nOur Customer Care team is the face of SiteGround. We gather knowledgeable, friendly, and enthusiastic people who want to help and educate clients. We communicate with clients 24/7/365 on Chat and Phone in different languages to help our multinational client base and maintain a growing 98% Customer Satisfaction Rate on an annual basis. Our Customer Care team was awarded the People’s Choice vote and the Silver award in the jury vote for Customer Service Department of the Year in the international Stevie® Awards for Business in 2020.\n\nAll Customer Care team members undergo a comprehensive onboarding program, starting with a two-week intensive technical training and four weeks of practice with one-on-one mentoring from our experienced supervisors. Once a new team member starts servicing clients independently, we continue to provide regular direct feedback and support that helps them develop further. Even when reaching our master Customer Care level, we offer plenty of upskill trainings and opportunities for professional growth. Making the first step is essential, the rest is enthusiasm and support from us.\n\nOur in-house Legal, Finance and Billing teams manage SiteGround’s corporate affairs and all financial activities. They are highly qualified and specialized in international legal, finance, billing, and tax matters, communicating with our internal teams on a daily basis to make sure everything within our complex company structure runs smoothly.\n\nThe mission of the SiteGround Human Resources team, or as we like to call them Employee Success team, is herding unicorns. They are responsible for forming and growing our international team of over 600 talented professionals, as well as walking each of them through their employee journey. It all starts with selection and recruitment, goes through team-tailored onboarding, and continues with maintaining team motivation. Our HR team takes care of sustaining our supportive work environment and unique company culture, managing all HR-related initiatives, enriching employee benefits, organizing company events, and more.\n\nBy submitting this form you agree to receive monthly newsletters from SiteGround with news and updates on our work and initiatives.
