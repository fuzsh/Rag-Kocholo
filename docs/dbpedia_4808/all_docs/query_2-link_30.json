        "text": "Reliable web hosting is one of the key components of every successful website, helping to ensure your site remains live and performs well for users.\n\nHowever, choosing the right hosting provider for your website may be difficult, especially if you’re new to the industry. That’s why we created this overview of the popular WordPress hosting providers to have the best options in one place and make everything easier for you.\n\nPlease note that this article is not about rating, but it’s more like an overview of the available options since each website is unique and may require different hosting features, so read the article and choose according to your site needs and requirements.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nImportance of a Reliable WordPress Hosting\n\nBefore moving to the list of providers, we’d like to briefly explain why choosing a reliable WordPress hosting is crucial for your website:\n\nIt ensures that your website remains live and accessible to visitors around the clock;\n\nGood hosting can make your website really fast, and as we know, the website’s speed matters;\n\nSecurity is also crucial when choosing a hosting provider to safeguard your website and data from potential cyber threats and breaches;\n\nLastly, a reliable hosting provider typically offers scalable solutions to handle your website’s growth over time.\n\nIn a nutshell, a reliable WordPress hosting provider plays a vital role in the success of your website by ensuring uptime, speed, security, support, and scalability. So, you can’t put a price tag on hosting if you want to have a successful website and provide an excellent user experience to your visitors.\n\nThings to Сonsider When Choosing a WordPress Hosting\n\nNow, let’s discuss already mentioned aspects in more detail so you can better understand how to choose a hosting plan for your future website.\n\nSpeed and Performance\n\nSpeed is an essential factor in the success of your website. A fast-loading website can better attract new users and keep them engaged, while slow-loading sites typically lead to higher bounce rates. Moreover, search engines like Google use page loading speed as a ranking factor, meaning better-performing websites often have a better place on SERP (search engine results pages).\n\nLook for WordPress hosting providers that offer:\n\nSolid server performance;\n\nCaching solutions;\n\nContent Delivery Networks (CDNs) to ensure optimal site loading times.\n\nAdditionally, consider the hosting plans that include SSD storage, as it can significantly improve your website’s performance compared to traditional HDD storage.\n\nPro Tip: It’s better to choose VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting instead of Shared or Free since with VPS, you get a separate virtual server specially for your WordPress website, and it guarantees faster performance.\n\nSecurity\n\nYour website’s security should be a top priority to maintain your reputation and ensure the privacy of your users (e.g., customer information, financial records, or confidential business data). First of all, search for WordPress hosting providers that offer essential security features such as:\n\nMalware scanning\n\nDDoS protection\n\nSSL certificates\n\nRegular backups\n\nAdditionally, you can check our guide on how to secure a WordPress website without any tech knowledge.\n\nScalability\n\nAs your website attracts more visitors and traffic increases, your hosting service should be able to handle this without any performance issues, ensuring that your website remains functional and well-performing under changing demands.\n\nIt’s particularly crucial when running a WordPress directory website or a service marketplace, as the number of listings will naturally grow over time, and it will be necessary to scale accordingly.\n\nMoreover, if your WordPress hosting provider has good scalability options, your website can handle sudden traffic spikes, for example, during marketing campaigns or product launches, without having downtime or performance issues.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nThe next crucial point you should keep in mind when choosing a hosting provider is customer support. A helpful and knowledgeable support team can make all the difference when you are facing technical issues or needing assistance.\n\nFortunately, most WordPress hosting providers offer excellent support and are always ready to give you a hand. But in any case, it’s better to check whether your provider:\n\nOffers 24/7 support through multiple channels, such as live chat, email, or phone;\n\nSpecializes in WordPress to assist you with any WordPress-specific issues that may arise;\n\nHas an extensive knowledge base, so you can use it at any time.\n\nTop-notch customer service and technical assistance can save you time and effort in resolving any issues. It’s especially important when something happens with your website, and visitors cannot access it, so you have to act quickly.\n\nTips on How to Assess a WordPress Hosting Provider\n\nOnce you find a good hosting provider for your WordPress website, you have to assess it. Here are a few tips on how to do that, especially if you don’t have a solid tech background:\n\nWebsite – check all the above-mentioned features on the official hosting provider’s website (e.g., check all their plans, support policy, offered features, etc.);\n\nPre-sale Questions – contact the chosen provider and ask questions about features that we discussed earlier;\n\nReddit & Forums – ask people on forums and subreddits about your provider to get some real feedback from users;\n\nReviews – check several reviews about hosting providers to analyze different opinions.\n\nBy following these tips, you’ll collect a lot of information about potential hosting providers and will be able to make a data-driven decision.\n\nNow let’s move forward and we’ll show you some of the most popular WordPress hosting providers.\n\nTop Leading WordPress Hosting Providers\n\nHere are some of the most popular WordPress hosting companies. Please note that this list is only an overview and not a rating of providers.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that in this overview, we are discussing only managed WordPress hosting plans.

The infrastructure is built to offer greater flexibility to scale up any server vertically. Simply saying, you can easily request adding more computing power (CPU, Memory, and Storage) to your existing server.\n\nAlso, Cloudways offers a choice of over 65 worldwide data centers in locations across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia.\n\nCloudways Hosting Plans\n\nHere are a few WordPress hosting plans offered by Cloudways:\n\n$11/month – this plan includes 1GB RAM, 1 Core processor, 25GB storage, 1TB bandwidth;\n\n$24/month – this package offers 2GB RAM, 1 Core processor, 50GB storage, and 2TB bandwidth;\n\n$46/month – this plan provides 4GB RAM, 2 Core processor, 80GB storage, and 4TB bandwidth;\n\n$88/month – this package includes 8GB RAM, 4 Core processor, 160GB storage, and 5TB bandwidth.\n\nYou can check all the features of each plan by visiting the official website.

Since it’s a WordPress-only host, WP Engine has been mastering the WordPress space for years to offer good performance and ensure WP-built websites run trouble-free.\n\nWP Engine is one of the most popular WordPress hosting solutions (that has more than 1.5 million clients) because it’s already pre-configured and optimized for WP websites.\n\nWP Engine Scalability\n\nSimilarly to Cloudways that we mentioned earlier, WP Engine has cloud hosting through Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.

It offers:\n\nFree SSL\n\nDaily website backups\n\nDomain Privacy\n\nMalware scanning\n\nTo make your website more secure, you can get SiteLock for an additional price.
