        "text": "WordPress categories are a very convenient way to organize your posts. You can have parent and child categories, making hierarchical arrangement of your posts possible. In addition, one post can be placed in more than one category. This gives you a lot of flexibility to show exactly the posts you want, exactly the way you want them in widgets, menus, or directly in your WordPress theme.\n\nHow to Create WordPress categories\n\nTo create new categories in WordPress, go to “Posts” > “Categories” page.\n\nOn the left side of the page, you will see a tab that allows you to create categories. Fill in the category name, its slug (which will be used in the category URLs), the category description, and then press “Add New Category”. For this tutorial, we will make a new category named “Family posts“.\n\nNow the new category in your WordPress is ready. Now, let’s make a sub-category of the “Family posts” one named “Nephews”. Fill in a name and slug the way you did with the first category but this time select “Family posts” as a parent for the new category. Then, press “Add New Category” once more to save the new sub-category.\n\nHow to assign posts to categories\n\nOnce you have the category structure created, you can add posts to categories. There are two ways you can do this. The first one is to open a particular post (or write a new one) and place a checkbox in the category you want to assign it to.\n\nThe second way is to bulk-add posts to a category. To do this go to Posts > All Posts. Next, select the posts you want to add to a category, click on the Bulk Actions tab, select Edit and finally press the Apply.\n\nSeveral new sections will show, allowing you to edit different settings of the selected posts. One of them is the Categories section. Select the category you want to add those posts to and click on the Update.\n\nNow, the posts you’ve marked previously belong to the category you’ve chosen."
