        "text": "Project Aim\n\nThe idea for SiteGround Team Fest was born in 2015 as part of a brainstorming game between the employees. The proposal to organize the next team building with a format - a music festival - was awarded by the employees as the best idea. The main goal of the proposal differs from the traditional understanding of team building of companies in Bulgaria (before and in 2015) and builds on it in the direction of experience. SiteGround employees have the opportunity to participate in an event that is spectacular in scale and organization. You cannot buy a ticket for this event. It is a privilege. You cannot come across this event by accident. It is exclusive and only for SiteGround employees. Team Fest means belonging. To the company. And the company is its people.\n\nProject Target Group\n\nThe Team Fest lasts 2-3 days and is an exclusive event for company employees (550+ people). The program during the day includes workshops, sports training, and competitions. This is a great opportunity to show skills and knowledge to the team that affects the cohesion and building of friendships, not only professional relationships. The evening program consists of performances by the group formed of employees “Technical Issues” and by world-known musicians.\n\nProject Duration\n\nEach event has its own name, theme, location, which correspond to SiteGround's year-round corporate social responsibility program: 2016 - SiteGround Open Air Fest (Mechi Chal) 2017 - SiteGround Beach Fest (Varna) 2018- SiteGround Woods Fest (Borovets) 2019 - SiteGround Zero waste (Varna) Team Fest in 2019 before Covid - was dedicated to the theme of 0 waste and environmental footprint.\n\nProject Activities\n\nBetween 90%-95% of the company's employees (550+) attend the event. Some of the employees (based on personal interests, skills and hobbies) lead workshops, share knowledge and skills with other colleagues. Over the years, we have organized workshops for assembling model airplanes, and we have made birdhouses (donated to the Bulgarian Association for the Protection of Birds). We have organized textile printing workshops. Traditionally at Team Fests there are tournaments in football, basketball, beach volleyball, paintball and more. At SiteGround, one of the values ​​we espouse is related to eco-friendly living and protecting the environment. Regarding our internal team events such as Team Fest, we prepare detailed online brochures and newsletters, through which we share the necessary information with all attendees and participants. Our colleagues quickly got used to receiving everything in electronic form, which makes the whole process easier and for them - everything they need is always one click away.\n\nProject Results\n\nSiteGround Team Fest directly affects employee engagement and the feeling of belonging to the company (results of independent studies show that SiteGround won a number of awards for Best employer in Bulgaria). The opportunity to work for a company that invests in events such as music festivals attracts the best candidates in Bulgaria. Colleagues find like-minded people to play sports with, discover a passion for board games or someone to play with in a band. After one of our workshops, many more people started using reusable bags, bottles and food containers after a speaker told them about the benefits and harms of this."
