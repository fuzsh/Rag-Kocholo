        "text": "Shared hosting is the most basic plan you can order with hosting companies. With that said, most of the websites being created as we speak, have no reason to choose a more elaborate program. Siteground’s shared hosting program is no different. They have 3 separate plans of shared hosting, this is what they entail:\n\nStartUp\n\nThe startup plan is a “slim plan” and is good for hosting one domain only. Although it’s a lot, you can host only up till 10GB and bandwidth is up to 10k visitors per month on this plan.\n\nBlogs, business websites, small eCommerce websites – these can all fit in very well with the Startup plan.\n\nHere is a list of what you get with all shared hosting plans:\n\nFree Website Builder – not relevant for most users but you should know that it exists\n\ncPanel & SSH Access\n\nFree Setup & Transfer – this is great for the non savvy users among you\n\n24/7 Technical Support\n\nSSD Storage – meaning the hosting is really fast (important for user experience and SEO)\n\nFree Daily Backup\n\n30 Days Money Back\n\nUnlimited Emails & Databases\n\nFree Let’s Encrypt SSLs – useful if you want to create an https website\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN – another feature which is great for speed\n\nGrowBig\n\nThere are a few differences here. Here you can host multiple domains and not just one. You have 20GB hosting instead of 10 and 25K monthly users instead of 10k.\n\nBesides these differences, here are a few additions that this plan gets:\n\nPremium support – your tickets will be answered faster. Sort of a hosting VIP plan\n\nPremium Speed – Siteground adds their SuperCacher here, to give you another speed boost\n\n30 Backups – Siteground keeps 30 daily backups of your site\n\nGreat for WordPress & Joomla! – Siteground’s caching system is built specifically for these in mind\n\nGoGeek\n\n30 GB storage\n\nUp to 100,000 monthly visits\n\nThis plan is great if you need a server with much more resources, such as a WooCommerce website with lots of products or variations or if you have lots of traffic and need the extra bandwidth.\n\nThe big plus here is that the Gogeek shared hosting plan has fewer accounts using the server.\n\nIf you are interested in Cloud hosting or in Siteground’s cloud hosting to be exact, you probably don’t need any introduction to what cloud is or how you can use it to your advantage. The prices of cloud hosting, no matter what company you are talking about, make sure that only someone who really needs it, signs up for it.\n\nSiteground’s cloud platform is really fast and really powerful. You might be interested in the cloud plan if you are developing a web app that has some specific needs or you may run a super heavy in users and traffic website. These types of websites would fit in the cloud platform excellently."
