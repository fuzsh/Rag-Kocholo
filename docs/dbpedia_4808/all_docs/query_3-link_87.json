        "text": "Almost a year after our first hiring campaign, it was time to launch a new one tailored specifically to the needs of our Customer Care teams. What prompted the direction of the new campaign was largely the current IT services landscape in Bulgaria and our stand against the commoditization of the workforce in local outsourcing centers. But here’s the whole story.\n\nA Little Background\n\nBack when we started in the web hosting business 12 years ago, we were not only one of the very few IT companies in Bulgaria, but also a rare example of one locally founded and managed, not a third-party business outsource. Although this is still as true for us as it was back then, the human resources in demand at the time were mainly programmers. Today, thanks to the abundant technical talent, our geographical proximity to major European cities and comparatively cheaper prices, Bulgaria is turning into а major call center outsource destination. Despite the overall positive effect that it has on the economy, one of the shortcomings of this tendency is the negative effect that it has on company culture and work habits. Working in IT service centers in Bulgaria has become synonymous with working in a cubicle, often seemingly for big international companies, when in fact on a temporary part-time project for an outsourcing center. Employees grow accustomed to being motivated by targets, bonuses and numbers, which takes away from the quality of their work and commitment.\n\nThis is how we do IT – The SiteGround Manifesto\n\nAt SiteGround, we don’t believe in the things that are becoming the epitome of working in Customer Service – clocking your work time, having fixed breaks, quiet “phone off” hours, no personal space, etc. We believe that in order to be meaningful, your workplace or process needs to be healthy, comfortable, enjoyable and productive – suited to the people, not the other way round. We are motivated by way more than numbers and targets and when we say we put people first, we mean it – both in terms of our team members and clients.\n\nEach organization has unwritten rules about how things are usually done that reflect its intangible values. These are often even more important than what is written in your job description. In order to communicate those as a huge motivation to our team and those who were about to join it, we decided to base our latest hiring campaign in Bulgaria around the work principles that really matter to us and turn it into some kind of a SiteGround work manifesto.\n\nAll designs from the campaign are photos from team-buildings, marathons and initiatives that we took together as a team and at the time were not meant to be shared outside of the company. These, however, are not only snippets of our lives in and outside the office. This is who we are as people, what we believe in as a team and how we approach not only our work but everything we do.\n\nBy pinning those down we not only aimed to show to people outside of the team what we are about and what we stand for, but also as a reminder to our ever-growing team that the values we started off with 12 years ago are still as strong as ever – only way more richer now since there is more of us. Because it is your commitment, principles and efforts that count, not just the numbers."
