Conclusion\n\nThis post will highlight some shocking facts about SiteGround while also providing an in-depth look at the various web hosting services/plans offered by the company:\n\n7 Shocking Hidden Facts of SiteGround\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform\n\nA big part of SiteGround's infrastructure is powered by Google Cloud Platform that ensures robust built-in redundancy and application availability with its ultra-fast networks and distributed storage.\n\nEco-friendly hosting\n\nIn addition to providing ultra-reliable hosting services, SiteGround is also committed to sustainability. While all of its data centers are green-friendly, its primary data center partner Google is already an energy efficiency leader.\n\nRecommended by WordPress\n\nWordPress.org, the most popular open-source software for website-building globally, officially recommends SiteGround as one of the best web hosting service providers for WordPress sites.\n\nTop-notch security\n\nSiteGround's in-house system monitors the server status every 0.5 seconds and immediately fixes the issues it detects. Additionally, the system is programmed to prevent a multitude of problems automatically. The company has also deployed an artificial-intelligence (AI) based smart system to detect and stop malicious traffic before it reaches its customers' sites.\n\nCustomized interface\n\nIn 2019, SiteGround introduced new in-house interfaces to make site management more intuitive, replacing the previous and the most commonly used cPanel interface.\n\nLocation-specific hosting\n\nSiteGround allows its clients to pick the best data center location for their website as server location impacts web pages' loading speed. It would be wise to choose a location where most of your site visitors come from, as geographical proximity helps minimize network issues and improves the website's performance.\n\nCDN\n\nSiteGround has partnered with Cloudflare to lets its customers use a free content delivery network service to speed up page loading time for visitors. Spanning across 90 countries globally, CDN caches the site's content and loads them for visitors from their nearest geographic locations.\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting Reviews\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting is ideal for personal and small-to-medium business websites. It is offered in three tiers:\n\nStartup: suitable for 10,000 monthly visitors\n\nGrowBig: suitable for 25,000 monthly visitors\n\nGoGeek: suitable for 100,000 monthly visitors\n\nThe SiteGround StartpUp plan allows for hosting a single website, and this package is suitable to accommodate 10,000 monthly visitors. The TheStartpUp package includes 10GB of web space, unmetered data transfer, automated daily backup.\n\nOn the other hand, the SiteGround GrowBig and GoGeek plans allow for hosting unlimited websites and unmetered data transfer. Both the higher shared hosting plans allow for creating up to 5 on-demand backups at a time, along with the ability to add collaborators.\n\nIt is worth noting that the top tier plan - GoGeek- includes ultrafast PHP that cuts time to first byte (TTFB) and allows the server to load the webpages faster than usual. GoGeek plan also includes pre-installed Git and advanced priority support wherein the company assigns customer issues with priority to its most-experienced support agents.\n\nSiteGround Shared hosting plans.\n\nWith each shared web hosting plan, SiteGround includes the following features:\n\nFree drag and drop Weebly site builder\n\nFree CMSs installation - WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and more\n\nUnlimited free email accounts\n\nUnlimited MYSQL databases\n\nSite Tools for website management\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\nSSD storage\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nHTTP/2 enabled servers\n\nFree automated SSL by Let's Encrypt\n\nAdditionally, SiteGround offers automatic tools through which its customers can install Magento, an open-source shopping cart application, in just a few clicks. The application supports various payment processors and shipping methods. Besides Magento, the SiteGround auto-installer tool also allows users to install other applications such as PrestaShop and WooCommerce, among others, on their shared hosting account.\n\nSiteGround Cloud Hosting Review\n\nFor those unaware, Cloud hosting is ideal for growing websites that need more resources and flexibility than provided by shared web hosting. SiteGround Cloud Hosting allows its customers to manually add resources - CPU, RAM, and storage - with one-click or utilize an auto-scale option that automatically adds more resources - CPU and RAM - to meet unexpected traffic spikes, all without affecting the speed and uptime.\n\nSiteGround Cloud hosting is a fully managed service, and it is offered in four levels with options to configure plans - Custom Cloud - as per your website needs.

SiteGround's Client Area allows you to manage multiple sites from a single easy-to-use dashboard, and there is a search tool that lets you jump to a specific site.\n\nImage Credit: SiteGround\n\nThe company offers Reseller Hosting in three tiers - GrowBig, GoGeek, and Cloud - with each plan including:\n\nUnlimited websites\n\nFree WP Installation and migratory plugin\n\nWordPress Auto-updates\n\nDaily and on-demand backups\n\nFreebies - SSLs, CDN, and email\n\nWP-CLI and SSH\n\nUnlimited Databases\n\nSpeed-boosting Caching\n\nEasy StagingCollaborators\n\nWhile the GrowBig plan includes 20GB webspace, the mid-tier reseller hosting plan provides 40GB of web space and additional features, including:\n\nWhite-label Clients: By registering your clients as users on any of your websites, you can grant them full white-label access to the Site Tools, but the SiteGround logo or branding will not be visible to them.\n\nUltrafast PHP - a performance-boosting server that boosts website speed up to 30 percent as compared to the Standard PHP setup\n\nPriority Support- for faster technical support\n\nAs for the Cloud Reseller hosting plan, it grants more than 40GB of web space along with advanced functionalities such as:\n\nCustomize client's access - This feature allows you to customize access to the Site Tools control panel for your clients. You can enable your clients only to see the tools of your choice\n\nTailor site's resources - With this option, you can create custom hosting packages for each of your websites and allocate hosting resources like space, email accounts, and databases.\n\nSiteGround WordPress Hosting Review\n\nSiteGround is among the top three web hosting providers recommended by WordPress.org.

Using the WordPress Starter tool, you can pick a professional site design of your choice, add key functionalities, and a fully-functional website will be ready without requiring any technical skills.\n\nImage Credit: SiteGround\n\nSmooth WordPress transfer - The SiteGround Migrator plugin allows you to freely transfer as many WP sites from other hosts to SiteGround.

Apart from this, the company's superior SuperCacher service, along with NGINX-based dynamic cache and Memcached service, dramatically speed up WordPress sites.\n\nWordPress Advanced security: SiteGround keeps track of WP-related vulnerabilities, and if any major vulnerability is detected, the company applies server-level fixes before releasing an official security update.\n\nSiteGround Managed WordPress hosting and shared hosting plans are nearly similar except that the former has WordPress-specific features and optimization tools to build and manage WP sites. It has three levels - StartUp, GrowBig, and GoGeek.\n\nApart from the aforementioned features, the higher SiteGround WordPress hosting plans- GrowBig and GoGeek- include:\n\nWordPress Special Cache - for blazing-fast websites\n\nOne-click WordPress Staging tool - to easily create staging copies of your WP website and test new features in a safe environment before uploading them live\n\nSG-Git - to create a repository of WordPress\n\nSiteGround E-commerce Hosting Review\n\nFor e-commerce sites, SitGround offers many applications, including WordPress + WooCommerce, Magento, PrestaShop, and OpenCart.

These mainly include- Startup, GrowBig, and GoGeek. While the StartUp plan is suitable for users who want to host a single website, the higher plans with premium features are ideal for growing and established websites that need more server resources and best performance.\n\nHere are the prices of the various web hosting packages offered by HostGator:\n\nShared/WordPress/WooCoomerce hosting\n\nStartUp: USD6.99/month\n\nGrowBig: USD9.99/month\n\nGoGeek: USD14.99/month\n\nReseller hosting\n\nGrowBig: USD9.99/month\n\nGoGeek: USD14.99/month\n\nCloud: USD110.00/month\n\nCloud hosting\n\nEntry: USD110.00/month\n\nBusiness: USD210.00/month\n\nBusiness Plus: USD310.00/month\n\nSuper Power: USD410.00/month\n\nSiteGround Pros\n\nMultiple data center locations: SiteGround's data centers are located in Iowa (USA), Eemshaven (Netherlands), Frankfurt (Germany), Sydney (AU), London (UK), and Singapore (Asia). During the sign-up process, the company lets you choose between various data centers to deliver the highest speed and reliability level. For instance, if most of your site visitors belong to Australia, you can switch to the Sydney server to improve the page loading times. However, if they are scattered globally, you may activate CDN (content delivery network) service for boosting the site speed.\n\nCustomer support: SiteGround provides multiple ways - live chat, phone, and helpdesk tickets - to assist its customers 24/7 and resolve their issues. The company also offers a paid support service for requests that are outside its free technical support scope. Additionally, the company has a knowledge base that features a comprehensive list of help articles to answer all your hosting questions.\n\nReliable hosting: SiteGround's hosting services are backed by an annual 99.9% network uptime guarantee. The company leverages the Google cloud platform with SSD-persistent storage and ultra-fast network, ultrafast PHP, SuperCacher, and CDN to ensure that your sites run faster.\n\nFree and easy-to-use site building tools: All hosting plans from SiteGround include WordPress and Weebly - two of the easiest and most widely used site-building tools.\n\nMoney-back guarantee: With 30 days and 14 days money-back guarantee for shared hosting and cloud hosting plans, respectively, SiteGround makes it 100 percent risk-free for you to try their hosting services. If the company fails to meet the expectations set out in the Service Level Agreement (SLA), your hosting fees will be refunded. The company claims to offer 1 month of free hosting for uptime ranging between 99.9% - 99.00% and an additional month of free hosting for every 1% of uptime lost below it.\n\nWordPress auto-migration: If you wish to migrate your WordPress sites from other hosts to SiteGround freely, you can utilize the WordPress Migrator plugin. You can also go for the 'Professional Migration' service wherein the company's experts transfer your website.\n\nWordPress staging: SiteGround's built-in one-click staging tool (Site Tools > WordPress > Staging > Create New Staging Copy) lets users test any new significant change in a separate, safe environment, without affecting the live version of the website. Additionally, the push-to-live functionality allows users to deploy the changes to their live site.\n\nSiteGround Cons\n\nTo know the pros and cons of each type of hosting and which form will be best for your site, read our previous post on\" Top 10 Best Web Hosting for Small Businesses\".\n\nHigh renewal prices: SiteGround's hosting renewal prices are higher than their discounted introductory prices. For instance, its cheapest shared hosting plan costs USD6.99/month, and its renewal price is USD14.99/month, more than double the initial term price.\n\nPaid migration: While many web hosting companies provide free site migration, SiteGround offers professional website migration services for USD 30 per site. It is worth noting that SiteGround offers free website migration only for WordPress sites.\n\nNo free domain: SiteGround charges USD15.95 annually for domain registration instead of many other web hosts that provide a free domain name registration for one-year to new customers.\n\nHosting limitations: One of the major drawbacks of SiteGround is that the company does not offer dedicated / Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting.\n\nFinal Word\n\nSiteGround is an excellent choice for small and medium sites; SiteGround's shared hosting service might be an ideal option as all its plans include free daily backups, free CDN service, unlimited databases, and unmetered traffic.\n\nSiteGround is also an excellent choice for those looking to host WordPress sites, as its also recommended by Wordpress.org. While the company offers free WordPress installation with all plans, the higher plans - GrowBig and GoGeek - come with unique features like a safe site staging environment and speed-boosting caching that ensures top WordPress site performance. Most importantly, SiteGround WordPress hosting is a fully managed service.\n\nFurther, if you plan on building an online store, you may choose SiteGround as your web host. With SiteGround's click-and-install wizard, you can install popular shopping cart applications including WooCommerce, Open Cart, Magento, and more to create a fully-functional online store in no time.\n\nIf your business/website is quickly growing, you can move from shared to cloud hosting plans. The best thing about SiteGround's Cloud hosting service is that it provides the flexibility to customize the plans as per your needs. For instance, you can pick the number of CPU cores - between 4 to 33 cores - memory - from 4GB to 130GB - and SSD space - from 60GB to 1TB. Further, with the auto-scaling feature, you don't have to worry about unexpected traffic spikes as it automatically adds resources to prevent downtime and traffic loss.\n\nIf budget is not a concern and your main focus is performance, then SiteGround is the best fit for your hosting need.\n\nAlso Read:-\n\nSiteGround vs HostGator\n\nSiteGround vs DreamHost\n\nInmotion vs SiteGround\n\nREAD MORE ON:\n\nSiteground reviews\n\nSiteGround reviews 2021\n\nFacts of SiteGround\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting Reviews\n\nSiteGround Cloud Hosting Review\n\nSiteGround Reseller Hosting Review\n\nSiteGround WordPress Hosting Review\n\nSiteGround E-commerce Hosting Review\n\nSiteGround Performance Review\n\nSiteGround Hosting Plan Pricing\n\nSiteGround Pros\n\nSiteGround Cons\n\nAdvertisement"
