In the following sections, we’ll continue with our advice, recommendations, and tips for finding the right host for your needs.\n\nWhat are the hosting requirements for WordPress?\n\nAs a Content Management System (CMS), WordPress needs its hosting to have certain characteristics in order to function properly.\n\nAt the time of writing,these requirements are as follows:\n\nPHP: The language in which WordPress is written. The server must be able to read it to display your site. Recommended PHP version: 7.4 (or higher)\n\nMySQL: The language of the WordPress database.\n\nRecommended version for MySQL data: 8.0 (or higher) OR MariaDB (another database management system) version 10.4 or higher.\n\nHTTPS support, enabling secure connection to a site (in particular through an SSL certificate).\n\nNote: At the time of writing, the current version of PHP is 8.3. WordPress does not officially recommend this version for compatibility reasons. If your site doesn’t run on a recent version of WordPress, using a maintained version of PHP (8.1, 8.2 ,or 8.3) could potentially generate display errors and/or cause your site to crash. To find out which version to use and how to update your PHP version, check out our step-by-step tutorial.\n\nIf you see that the PHP and MySQL versions listed above are offered by a hosting company, this means that it’s possible to install WordPress with them.\n\nAnd rest assured, the best WordPress hosting providers in 2024 are going to be right on the mark. 😉\n\nIf you’re using versions older than those mentioned above, WordPress also works with versions as old as PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.0.\n\nBut, in this case, you’re exposing yourself to greater security vulnerabilities than with up-to-date versions. So try to keep up with the timesto avoid errors.\n\nWhat criteria should you use when choosing a WordPress hosting solution?\n\nYour needs\n\nThe most important thing to consider before choosing your WordPress hosting is your needs.\n\nWe’re not talking about choosing the best WordPress hosting provider in 2024, but about selecting a hosting solution that meets your expectations, ambitions, and desires.\n\nTo do this, you’ll need to take a broad look at the following elements:\n\nYour skill level: Can you manage a server on your own (and do you want to)? Do you want to concentrate solely on your content and delegate the technical side?\n\nThe type of site you want to create. The more content a site hosts and the more traffic it receives, the greater the resource and bandwidth requirements of the hosting provider. For example, for a large WooCommerce store with hundreds of products and heavy daily traffic (several thousand visits), shared hosting may quickly show its limits.\n\nThe traffic you receive on a daily basis.\n\nYour budget: How much are you prepared to pay monthly or annually to host your website?\n\nThe features you absolutely need. I’m thinking here of domain names, SSL certificates, storage space, bandwidth, and more advanced tools (cloning, migration, WP-CLI, etc.).\n\nThe type of hosting you want: Shared, VPS, cloud, dedicated, or specialized.\n\nOnce all this is clear, you’ll be in a position to make an informed choice. Let’s take two examples to illustrate my point.\n\nIf you’re a beginner blogger looking to get your site up and running, a good compromise is to opt for shared hosting to get you started.\n\nIf you’re an e-merchant and your business and sales are largely based on your website (with a lot of traffic to your pages), it’s wiser to invest in VPS or dedicated hosting, depending on your technical skills.\n\nThe essential components of a good WordPress hosting provider\n\nIn addition to your needs, it’s important to verify the presence of certain technical features that all good hosting providers must have.\n\nIn our experience, we recommend that you consider the following before deciding on a particular provider:\n\nEase of use of the interface, both in the customer area and in the administration area (cPanel type).\n\nResponsiveness and efficiency of support. This is very important. When you have a problem (it happens), it’s essential that you get a fast response, 24/7.\n\nOnline server availability (uptime). If downtime is too frequent, your site will become inaccessible. In this respect, all the best WordPress hosting providers in 2024 boast rates of around 99.9%.\n\nHosting server performance (speed). The faster the server, the faster your pages will load. This is important for both user experience (very important) and SEO (somewhat important). By the way, the power of the hosting (CPU, RAM) also plays a role here, so check this point carefully.\n\nDatacenter location. The closer the datacenter is to your visitors’ IP address, the higher the performance.\n\nSecurity. Your WordPress hosting provider must apply good security practices: analysis and detection of vulnerabilities, regular backups, server updates, etc. They must also offer you a secure password protection system. It should also offer a backup and restore system, and an SSL certificate.\n\nScalability. Your needs and your site may change over time. Your hosting provider must be able to offer you a superior package at any time (more resources, more bandwidth, etc.).\n\nFeatures offered: free domain name, SSL certificate, professional email addresses, WordPress tools (themes, plugins), migration service, automated installation tool, etc.\n\nDisk space offered.\n\nResources for finding your own answers to your questions and bottlenecks: Knowledge base, videos, tutorials, blog posts, and/or guides.\n\nAlso consider the ecological impact of your WordPress site. By choosing an ecologically responsible web host, you’re doing your part for the planet. The majority of the best WordPress hosting providers are taking action in this direction, so you should find something to suit your needs. 😉\n\nFinally, make sure that the host you choose protects your data and that of your visitors. In principle, all good hosting companies do.\n\nYou can check this point on each host’s website, or ask their customer service department about their commitments in this area (e.g. ISO 27001 certification for information security).\n\nWithout further ado, let’s move on to a presentation of the different types of hosting you’ll find on the market. Understanding how they work will help you make the right choice.\n\nWhat are the different types of hosting?\n\nAlthough each hosting provider has its own specific characteristics, we can group the offers they provide into several categories.\n\nLet’s take a look at the different types of hosting you’ll find on the Internet.\n\nShared hosting\n\nIf you’re just starting out, chances are you’ll opt for this type of hosting for your WordPress site. Shared hosting offers are the most affordable and provide an adequate number of resources to get you started.\n\nThis is the type of offer I chose when I created this blog in early 2011.\n\nIn practical terms, you can think of shared hosting as low-cost housing. The space you occupy on the server (the building), and the resources you use, are shared with other sites (your neighbors).\n\nSince several sites will be occupying the same server, resources will be limited so that each occupant can have equivalent resources.\n\nThis means that if your site becomes popular (which I hope it does!), you’ll have to opt for a higher offer, or another type of offer, so as not to cannibalize your neighbors’ resources. That’s what community living is all about. 🙂\n\nNote: Shared hosting is recommended for freelancers, small businesses, associations, and bloggers.\n\nVPS hosting (and the cloud)\n\nIf your site is becoming so popular that you no longer have the option of upgrading to a higher-level shared offering, congratulations. You must have done your job well in promoting it!\n\nNow it’s time to take your site to the next level with a VPS package.\n\nVPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting is a solution that’s going to take some skill on your part.\n\nIn fact, with a VPS, you’ll need to configure your server from start to finish. In other words, you’ll need to enter command-line instructions to install and configure modules (Apache, PHP, PHPMyAdmin, etc.).\n\nWith shared WordPress hosting, everything is already configured for you. With a VPS, you have to get your hands dirty.\n\nYou’re probably wondering what the word “virtual” in VPS stands for. In practical terms, the physical server has software that allows you to create several independent servers.\n\nSince these “sub-servers” don’t actually exist, we call them virtual.\n\nAs for the word “private,” this refers to the fact that each virtual server is independent of the others.\n\nIn other words, if a problem occurs on one of the virtual servers, it won’t affect the others.\n\nNote: VPS hosting is also available on a “managed” basis, i.e. where the virtual server is pre-configured.\n\nOne of the advantages of VPS is that you can upgrade your offering without too much complexity. If you need more resources (disk space, computing power, RAM, etc.), simply allocate more from the management console.\n\nSo you have flexibility, a word that also applies to another type of hosting: the cloud.\n\nI’d like to mention it briefly here, as we’re hearing more and more about it.\n\nSo let’s digress for a moment. Cloud hosting allows you to host your WP site on several dematerialized virtual servers, which generally ensures greater reliability (if one of the servers goes down, your site won’t be affected).\n\nIt also offers a great deal of flexibility: for example, you only pay for the resources and storage you consume, and you can easily add or remove them.\n\nOn the other hand, your data isn’t stored locally on a server, and you don’t have total control over it.\n\nThis can present certain security risks. And in terms of cost, it’s often more expensive than shared WordPress hosting, for example.\n\nNote: VPS hosting is recommended for medium-sized businesses, bloggers receiving several thousand visits a day, and sites with good visibility.\n\nDedicated hosting\n\nWith dedicated hosting, you no longer share your server with other sites, but have a server all to yourself!\n\nThe main advantage is that you benefit from all the machine’s resources (though there are more or less powerful configurations). You can install the software you need for your site.\n\nIn short, you’re at home. 🙂\n\nThe downside is that you’ll have to manage all on your own. As with VPS hosting, you’ll need to install and configure the software on the server.\n\nThese operations require a fairly high level of expertise to ensure that your server is optimally configured. You may need to hire someone to do the job.\n\nIf you’re going to set up a dedicated server (or VPS), be extremely careful about security. These things are not to be taken lightly.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s move on to the last category of hosting providers in this article on WordPress hosting. This time, we’re going to specialize. 😉\n\nNote: Dedicated site hosting is recommended for large corporations, highly influential bloggers, and sites receiving a very large amount of traffic.\n\nSpecialized WordPress hosting\n\nSome hosting providers offer packages specifically designed for sites using WordPress.\n\nIn concrete terms, these offers include things that go much further than what you’d get from a standard hosting provider (regardless of the type of hosting).\n\nSpecialized WordPress hosting providers set up an infrastructure designed to make your WordPress site perform better and be more secure than with conventional hosting (by which I mean not optimized for WordPress).\n\nBasically, you don’t have to worry about anything (exceptpublishing interesting content on your site). But peace of mind comes at a price (and rightly so).\n\nSpecialized WordPress hosting packages generally start at between $20 and $30 per month for a single site.\n\nNote: WordPress dedicated hosting is for bloggers and entrepreneurs who can afford it, but also for people who want to delegate the technical side of things as much as possible.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is WordPress hosting?\n\nWordPress hosting, also known as managed WordPress hosting, refers to an offer from a hosting service that is specifically tailored to WordPress.\n\nIn this case, the hosting provider takes care of many technical aspects, such as backups, security, speed (performance), server maintenance, and support.\n\nIt also offers features such as migration, restoration, caching, one-click automatic installation of the CMS, and so on. So users don’t have to worry about the technical side of things.\n\nThis applies to several types of hosting, such as shared hosting or dedicated hosting, for example.\n\nIs WordPress a web host?\n\nWordPress is not a host. It’s a CMS (Content Management System) that lets you create any type of website (showcase site, online store, community space, blog, portfolio, etc.).\n\nTo be visible online, a WordPress site needs an online server, i.e. a dedicated space rented to you by a hosting company for the period of your choice.\n\nWhat’s the best host for WordPress in 2024?\n\nThe best host for your WordPress site is the one that best meets your needs. WPMarmite recommends Bluehost. In our opinion, it offers very good value for money, and is suitable for beginners as well as more experienced profiles.\n\nHow do I host a WordPress website?\n\nTo host a WordPress website, you first need to purchase a domain name, usually free of charge.\n\nThen, depending on your needs, select the provider best suited to your requirements. Choose the offer of your choice and create an account. Finish by installing WordPress with the hosting provider, either automatically via one-click installation, or manually.\n\nIs it possible to host a WordPress website for free?\n\nYou can have a WordPress site hosted for free, but I wouldn’t recommend it. First of all, there’s a good chance that the host will display unwanted ads on your site.\n\nIn the event that ads aren’t displayed, free offers are generally more limited than paid offers. Servers are less powerful, functionalities are limited, and support is often nonexistent.\n\nIf you want to create a professional site that’s visible on search engines like Google, you’ll have to invest at some point. Finally, it’s also possible that your free web host will pass on your personal data to third parties, so beware.\n\nHow much does WordPress hosting cost?\n\nPrices vary essentially according to the type of hosting (shared, dedicated, VPS, cloud, etc.), the features offered, and the reputation/experience of the provider.\n\nShared hosting is often the most affordable. On average, you can expect to pay between $3/month (low end) and $10/month (high end). The right price is not necessarily the cheapest or the most expensive. Above all, it’s the one that includes features and services in line with your needs and budget.\n\nWhat do I do once I’ve chosen a WordPress host?\n\nOnce you’ve chosen your host, it’s time to get to work. Get started and create your WordPress site with our step-by-step guide.\n\nFirst, we’ll look at choosing a domain name and hosting, then we’ll explain how to install and set up WordPress, how to add and edit content, how to customize the design, and how to add features."
