They are known for their top-notch customer support, reliable and fast hosting plans, and WordPress-optimized hosting, which includes everything you’ll need to create and grow a successful website or blog. Read our complete SiteGround review to find out if it is the right host for you.\n\nIn this detailed SiteGround review, we’ll put their promises to the test. These are the areas we will look into:\n\nPerformance: Speed is crucial for the success of any website. How fast will your website load with SiteGround?\n\nReliability: Will your website be available 24/7/365 without facing any downtime?\n\nCustomer Support: Can you count on their customer support?\n\nFeatures: Do they offer all the features and tools you’ll need to build your website?\n\nPricing: How much will it cost you? Are there any SiteGround deals that can save you money?\n\nThis is a comprehensive SiteGround review with a detailed analysis of SiteGround’s hosting service. If you don’t want to read the full hosting review, here is the quick scorecard with our verdict right below it.\n\nSiteGround Review Summary Performance gradeA+ Average load time397 ms Average response time123 ms Free domainYes Free SSLYes 1-click WordPressYes SupportPhone / Live Chat / Knowledge base Start with SiteGround\n\nBottom line: We found SiteGround to be noticeably faster and extremely reliable. Their hosting plans are flexible, and their customer support is one of the best in the industry.\n\nThat’s why we’ve chosen to recommend SiteGround as one of the best WordPress hosting companies.\n\nNow, let’s dive into our detailed SiteGround review so that you can see how we reached that conclusion and decide for yourself.\n\nAbout SiteGround\n\nSiteground was founded in 2004 and has grown into one of the most well-known hosting companies.\n\nSiteGround is a holding of companies registered in the USA, UK, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Spain, with data centers on three continents. Today, the company has over 500 employees and hosts over 2,000,000 domains.\n\nPros and Cons of SiteGround\n\nEach hosting company has its pros and cons. Some advantages can overshadow the disadvantages, but some cons can be a total deal-breaker for your needs.\n\nBefore making a decision, you may want to review these SiteGround pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nHere are some advantages that make SiteGround one of the top-rated hosting companies in the world:\n\nSuper fast servers: All SiteGround servers are highly optimized for speed. They use the Google Cloud platform, which is one of the fastest platforms on the market.\n\nTop Notch Customer Support: Their customer support is amazing, to say the least. They offer 24/7 phone support, live chat, and ticket-based support.\n\nFree CDN and SSL They offer an instant setup of Cloudflare’s free CDN and free SSL certificate from Let’s Encrypt.\n\nMultiple Server Locations They have data centers on three continents. During signup, you can choose the location you prefer.\n\nCons\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, every hosting company has some downsides. The following are some disadvantages of choosing SiteGround as your host:\n\nLimited Storage: Their plans come with fixed storage. However, this storage is quite ample, and if you are starting, you will most likely never need extra storage.\n\nHigher fee for monthly billing: The hosting service gets expensive if you choose monthly billing. But if you sign up for a longer billing period, then you’ll get a more significant discount and a lower rate. They offer a 30-day money-back guarantee anyway, so it’s a good idea to choose a longer billing period when you sign up.\n\nSiteGround Performance Tests\n\nWhile price often plays a significant role when choosing a web host, you cannot compromise on performance.\n\nThis is why we decided to run our tests to review SiteGround’s performance thoroughly.\n\nSiteGround Speed Test Results\n\nSpeed is one of the most important performance metrics to look for. A faster website offers a good user experience and boosts your SEO.\n\nIn fact, a single-second delay can cause a 7% decrease in conversions, 11% fewer page views, and a 16% decrease in customer satisfaction.\n\nWe created a WordPress-powered test site on SiteGround and filled it with dummy content for theme development with images.\n\nAfter that, we used Pingdom’s website speed test tool to run our tests. These were the results we got:\n\nAs you can see, our test site loaded in less than a second (397 ms, to be precise) with a performance score of 95.\n\nThis is incredible, but this website had almost no traffic, so the Pingdom test alone is insufficient.\n\nSiteGround Stress Test Results\n\nWe used K6, a stress testing tool by Grafana Labs, to test how SiteGround servers would respond to increased traffic.\n\nThis tool gradually sends up to 50 users to see how the server would respond to increased traffic from multiple connections.\n\nYou can see the results in the chart below:\n\nThe gray line is the number of active virtual users on the site, and the green line is the server response time. SiteGround performed consistently throughout the test without any hiccups.\n\nThis test shows that SiteGround is a perfect choice if you are looking for a really fast website.\n\nOne of the reasons why SiteGround performed exceptionally well in these performance tests is because of the recent innovations they’ve added.\n\nSiteGround servers are hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. They’ve also added UltraFast PHP and created a custom WordPress plugin for optimization (SG Optimizer), which really puts them in a premium web hosting category.\n\nSiteGround Uptime Test Results\n\nTypically, websites hosted on shared hosting accounts slow down during top traffic hours. That’s because your site is sharing resources with other websites on that server.\n\nMost shared hosting companies automatically kill the server process if your site is taking too many resources. This causes downtime on your website.\n\nWe tested our SiteGround site for downtime and got a 99.98% uptime result.\n\nSiteGround Server Response Time\n\nYour website’s content has a huge impact on page load time. For example, if you have high-resolution images on a page, then it will significantly increase the overall page load time.\n\nThis means that speed test results may not accurately reflect how fast your hosting server really is.\n\nInstead of analyzing page load time alone, we decided to test the actual server response time as well.\n\nTo do this, we used a tool called Bitcatcha. It ignores page content and only tests the server’s response time.\n\nBitcatcha also gives you average loading speed from different global locations. The speed for each location is measured three separate times, and then the results are averaged.\n\nTake a look at the results in the screenshot below.\n\nAs you can see, SiteGround is a great choice if your target audience is mostly located in the United States. The server responded in a fraction of a second in the United States.\n\nIt responded within less than a second for all locations.\n\nSiteGround also allows you to change your server location. You can choose a data center closer to your target audience for even better response times in that particular region.\n\nSiteGround Hosting Plans and Features\n\nSiteGround offers shared hosting, WordPress hosting, cloud hosting, and dedicated hosting plans. If you are starting a new site, their shared hosting plans would be a perfect fit. However, your site will eventually grow, and you want to make sure that they have other plans that you can upgrade to.\n\nLet’s check out SiteGround’s hosting plans and their features:\n\nShared hosting: Shared hosting is recommended for new websites, bloggers, small business websites, or a startup online store. It is suitable for low-traffic websites as you will be sharing resources with other websites hosted on the server.\n\nWordPress hosting: This plan is the WordPress-optimized version of their shared hosting plan. It comes with SiteGround’s in-house WordPress optimizations to improve your website performance. See SiteGround WordPress hosting.\n\nWooCommerce hosting: This plan is a WooCommerce-optimized version of their shared hosting plan. It includes SiteGround’s optimizations, which greatly improve the performance of your online store. See SiteGround WooCommerce hosting.\n\nCloud hosting: Cloud hosting plans provide a flexible upgrade to a shared hosting solution. They allow you to use resources of cloud architecture, including multi-core CPUs and bandwidth. Cloud hosting is suitable for growing websites, popular blogs, or businesses. It can also be an upgrade over VPS and traditional dedicated servers. See SiteGround Cloud hosting.\n\nWPBeginner website is hosted on SiteGround’s Enterprise hosting infrastructure, which is an enhanced version of their Cloud platform for large sites.\n\nBreakdown of SiteGround’s Shared Hosting Plans\n\nSiteGround’s shared hosting options are the best way to build a new website.
