        "text": "This article is for the SiteGround’s clients who find the renewal prices too high for the service. This is for shared hosting clients, i.e. who is using the following SiteGround’s plans: StartUp, GrowBig and GoGeek.\n\nBelow I will explain what options you have after the first billing period is over if you don’t want to pay 2-3 times more as you paid before.\n\nPlease note, this article was written a while ago (you can see this by the dates of the previously published comments).\n\nThe general idea of the article and the recommendations are still actual though.\n\nIf you do NOT use WordPress, then this section with my recommended hosts is for you. Other sections include SiteGround’s alternatives mostly to WordPress users.\n\nSince 2013 I’ve been using more than 100 hosts and got plenty of personal experience regarding hosting promises, client support, performance and the risks that hosting clients have. Apart from that I’ve been analyzing reviews and getting my readers’ feedback on particular hosts. In addition, I’ve been monitoring 15 hosts performance since 2016. Also, I have been recommending some of the best hosts I’ve encountered on my way and I constantly get my readers’ feedback on my hosting recommendations which really encourages me.\n\nMy experience helps me see the hosts which suit better for different kind of users with certain requirements and in particular circumstances. And in this article I’d like to sum up my recommendations regarding alternatives to SiteGround shared hosting for current SiteGround’s clients.\n\nHere’s a disclosure: in this article I mentioned a dozen alternative hosts to SiteGround which I have carefully selected according to the principles I explain in this post. I provided affiliate links to the hosts. It means that I will earn a commission if you click on the links and make a purchase. This does not increase price for you. All affiliate links open in new window/tab; no software/program will be installed to your computer. (This is a standard affiliate notice, nothing special.)\n\nBeing happy with SiteGround during the first cheap billing period\n\nBefore all, SiteGround’s shared hosting plans had been one of the best possible options for beginners. And it used to be a superb option for people who start out with their website or who value a high-quality and friendly customer support.\n\nBeing a current SiteGround user or considering this host, you might notice that the renewal price which is triple of the initial price is probably too much. And it makes you sad.\n\nWhat are your options now?\n\nWhy not staying with SiteGround?\n\nIndeed, this is a matter of two arguments: the value you get for the price and your priorities. To put it simply, if you are generally satisfied with the current service, and the price increase is just a not pleasant fact (but you can cope with after all), then there’s no reason to leave SiteGround.\n\nThe point is that SiteGround’s shared hosting business model is based on attracting clients for comparatively low price. But after the initial period which can last up to three years, the price increases significantly. And this is where SiteGround makes money.\n\nIn other words, as regards SiteGround’s shared hosting, this host makes most money on renewals. Otherwise SiteGround could not run its business and could not provide the clients with outstanding service during the first billing period.\n\nThe clients who win the most with SiteGround are the new SiteGround’s clients before renewal. This is the SiteGround’s market advantage – offering generally good services for the small price for the first invoice.\n\nBut there are also many clients who did not utilize the SiteGround features to a great extent or did not use technical support as often as others. And these clients may question if it’s worth paying a triple price for the renewal period now.\n\nIf you are one of these questioning clients, I have something to offer to you. But the options come with their drawbacks. And I explain it all in the following chapters.\n\nAlternatives to SiteGround – the criteria of the options\n\nWhen speaking about SiteGround alternatives you always need to keep in mind your priorities. They can be price, performance, support approach, tools and other options.\n\nIn other words, you need to clearly understand what you may sacrifice if you want to cut the increased hosting cost.\n\nTo make the structure of my article easier, I will use the price as a starting point when suggesting you alternative options to SiteGround.\n\nAlmost all alternative hosts which I have chosen have the same prices for both first billing period and renewals. In other words, the prices of these alternative hosts do not increase after the first billing period. This is a long-term advantage compared to SiteGround.\n\nLet’s get to the particular recommendations now.\n\nWhy I don’t recommend A2 Hosting as an alternative to SiteGround in this article\n\nIndeed, in this article you will not see me recommending A2 Hosting, although this is one of the hosts that I recommend to some users.\n\nThe reason is that A2 Hosting has basically the same flaw as SiteGround. I.e. it has very attractive prices for the first billing period. But the renewals are quite expensive. Thus, migrating to A2 Hosting will simply repeat the current situation in the future in a year or two and then you will likely want to search for another host to migrate to cut your hosting costs.\n\nAnd in this article I want to give you a strategically as long-term solution as possible about which host to move from SiteGround. That’s why I suggest you other hosts which do not have the too high prices after the renewal. But of course, if you intend to migrate from A2 Hosting too after the first billing period is over, you can do it. It’s also a sort of strategy to move from one big host to another using the cheap promotional prices for the first couple of years.\n\nBut I will focus on a long term hosting choice for you. At the same time it does not mean that you have to sign up for the long-term contract! Many hosts that I suggest as alternatives to SiteGround in this article have similar prices for both monthly and yearly plans, or at least the prices do not increase at the renewals.\n\nAlternatives to SiteGround’s GoGeek plan\n\nIf the renewal price of SiteGround’s GoGeek plan is generally okay to you\n\nThis section will not help you pay less, but you can get more for the same price switching to another host. If you need to pay less than SiteGround’s GoGeek’s price, skip to this section.\n\nThe renewal price of SiteGround’s GoGeek plan is almost $35/mo. If you have just one website, then for this price you can get a fully managed hosting service provided by a number of companies. (By the way, for hosting multiple websites see the sections below starting from this one.)\n\nAnd in super-duper short, “fully managed” means qualified and approachable support, turbo-charged performance, tools and services which make the technical part of managing your site easier such as advanced security, more frequent or longer-stored backups, staging area. Some hosts even offer no-hassle and free service for cleaning your website in case of contamination or a hack (e.g. WP Engine, Kinsta).\n\nThese features make the price of fully managed hosting bigger compared to more mass-market (and more affordable) hosts. And if you have multiple sites, it can be quite expensive. But if you have just one website, then these hosts can suit you perfectly for the same budget as you pay with SiteGround now. Moreover, you will likely benefit from migrating, because these hosts are in the higher quality category than SiteGround.\n\nAlthough SiteGround’s GoGeek plan may look like not bad on a shared hosting market, it’s still has a kind of legacy of a shared hosting performance. In other words, if you website is heavy (very resource-intensive) and your speed expectations are high, SiteGround may be not the dream choice for you.\n\nAnd if you are ready to pay the renewal price of SiteGround’s GoGeek plan, but you are lacking speed performance, then I’ve got two articles for you so that you could have a look at alternative hosts within a similar pricing range:\n\nRecommended fully managed WordPress hosts.\n\nRecommended hosts for your e-commerce website.\n\nIf you follow the above links and read the articles, you will see that the hosts that I can recommend in this segment are WP Engine (if you have 1 site), Kinsta (if you have 1 site), WPX Hosting (very affordable for upto 5 sites) and LiquidWeb.\n\nI’d separately emphasize WPX Hosting. This is even a cheaper option whereas its performance and features are top-notch considering the plan allows upto 5 websites. I’ve reviewed this host: a short review, a longer review and the analysis of WPX Hosting reviews.\n\nA comparatively advantageous feature of the recommended hosts I’ve just mentioned above as SiteGround alternatives is that you can pay monthly and the price does not change after the initial period. Also, the per-month price is not very different compared to a longer term contract. Paying monthly has a great advantage that if something goes wrong you are not tied with a long-term contract.\n\nIf you have not decided yet, the sections below describe other alternatives to SiteGround.\n\nIf you want to pay less than the renewal price of SiteGround’s GoGeek plan\n\nIf your main concern is pricing then here are my thoughts for you. SiteGround’s GoGeek plan after the renewal has a pricing of a fully managed hosting. In other words, you can switch from SiteGround to another host and pay less, but it depends on how many websites you have and what resources and support options you need.\n\nHaving just one website\n\nIf you have just one WordPress website which is not very large and not very popular, have a look at FlyWheel hosting. This host is a comparatively low-budget alternative to SiteGround’s GoGeek plan. But its disadvantage is that it’s quite restricted in terms of storage (5 GB) and monthly traffic (25K visits per month). And it does not offer phone support. Daily backups and staging area are included. $25/mo (month-to-month contract) is a good price for this kind of offer. And if you have even less monthly visitors (upto 5,000 visits), then there’s a FlyWheel’s Tiny plan for just $15/mo monthly plan.\n\nAnother affordable option is LiquidWeb’s Spark plan. This is a more classic hosting solution, although very solid one. $19/mo when paying monthly. More technical uses or the owners of the website with high traffic will likely prefer this affordable option.\n\nIf you have not much traffic, then Lightningbase can be a super affordable ($10/mo paying monthly) but really high-performance option for you. A pretty small host which focuses on a very-well managed infrastructure.\n\nWPX Hosting is also a great and affordable option. If you appreciate very user-friendly support (read my review analysis of WPX Hosting reviews), it’s definitely worth taking a look at it. This comes with price $25/mo when paying monthly. This host is the most advantageous when you have multiple websites though (it’s cheaper per site then).\n\nIf you want even less price and want a comparable resources with what you have with SiteGround (number of websites allowed, storage, traffic), then you need to sacrifice something. The following sections are about it.\n\nHaving multiple websites\n\nIf you have multiple websites which are not very large in size, I suggest looking at the following two options.\n\nThe first one is WPX Hosting, that I already mentioned above and reviewed here. Its main advantage is support (read more about it here). $20-25/mo is the price for 5 websites and 10 GB Storage.\n\nAnother option is a small host that focuses on fully-managed WordPress hosting and higher performance – Lightningbase. This is a great managed WordPress hosting which is very affordable if you have upto 3 sites with not much traffic. And for the price less than $20/mo (month-to-month contract) you get hosting for 3 domains, 5GB space, upto 25K views monthly, superb performance, great support, reliable 30 daily off-site backups, CDN and more than ordinary security protection.\n\nCompared to SiteGround’s GoGeek plan, Lightningbase hosting does not have a phone support and it is a much smaller host. But this host will give you reliably superb performance.\n\nSacrificing the features and/or quality and saving more\n\nCutting the costs on your hosting. There are cheaper hosting plans which provide on-par performance. There are so called semi-dedicated or advanced shared hosting plans which have extra CPU and RAM server resources allocated for to account. The typical price for this kind of service is below $20/mo and often within $15/mo.\n\nText in the box with lite grey border and no background (e.g. used for not important tips)\n\nFor this price you don’t get the support that is ready to please you every minute, but there’s a technically efficient support. There’s no advanced security, but the default hosting security is provided. There’s no staging area and sometimes there are even no backups. So, the most importantly, you get the good performance (speed) comparable with what you get with SiteGround’s GoGeek plan. There’s no whistles and bells, but you get a solid hosting option which is enough in many ways.\n\nMy recommended hosting plans which can help you save a good sum of money compared to GoGeek plan by SiteGround are the following guys in the pricing segment $10-16/mo:\n\nVeeroTech (SSD Business or WordPress Pro plans). On a top of comparatively good performance and really helpful support you get daily backups (stored for 30 days) and extra security in terms of DDoS.\n\nGeekStorage (Performance Hosting plans). It’s even cheaper than VeeroTech. But you don’t get even less whistles and bells. In particular, there are no automatic backups except one last-night backup for emergency purpose. Performance and ticket support – bare minimum alternative of SiteGround’s GoGeek plan if you want to save big with no speed sacrifice.\n\nI also want to draw your attention to semi-dedicated and high-performance shared hosting plans at the following providers: MDDHosting, HawkHost and even Cloudways (I recommend it carefully with restrictions – see this post). Also, I have published the article that consists of my email recommendations to one of my readers who needed a hosting alternative to SiteGround. For the price in the range of $10-16/mo you can get a pretty powerful shared hosting option.\n\nSaving even more\n\nIf you want to pay even less than $10/mo (and I’m talking about the renewal price, not the promotional price), then you are entering an ordinary shared hosting zone. And so you have basically two options:\n\nSacrifice the speed of your site (in addition to sacrificing all the other whistles and bells like advanced security, backups, staging area, extra approachable support etc). It’s not a bad option if you have a light-weight website. Just choose an affordable shared hosting. Of course it can’t be compared to the service of SiteGround’s GoGeek plan, but if you decided to downgrade like that, it’s still a way to go. I’d recommend then going to my main page with the recommended hosts and choose the one that fits your budget and your other requirements. Among others I’d like to emphasize GeekStorage attractive Performance plans (considering their server performance and adequate support).\n\nBut I would not recommended going with a very affordable shared hosting plan if you have a heavy or multipurpose theme with tons of plugins. For this kind of websites (as well as for e-commerce websites) you need more server power. In other words, raise your budget and read the above sections where I write about more powerful hosting options.\n\nThe second option to save big (and even win the speed) is to buy a self-managed VPS or cloud hosting like DigitalOcean. You need to know Linux or be ready to learn it. It’s a huge sacrifice in a technical support and quite big savings. For as much as $5/mo you get speed as with $15/mo shared hosting. Anyway, I would not recommend going this cheap way unless you know what you are doing.\n\nIn most cases focusing on your business is more important than spending time on learning and managing the server. In addition you have a big risk of downtime if something goes wrong. And if you are not experienced in Linux, “going wrong” can be often.\n\nIf you have an e-commerce website(s)\n\nIf you are running an e-commerce website, let me tell you a word of caution – I’d definitely recommend stop thinking of shared hosting plans and move to more powerful e-commerce solutions with knowledgeable technical support. It will cost $30/mo and more. Read this for more details.\n\nThe hosting recommendations and considerations that I’ve written above in this article totally apply to e-commerce websites too. But you need to keep in mind that e-commerce software requires more server resources to run smoothly. Technically, you can even use an ordinary shared hosting for your e-commerce website. And many hosts do advertise this option on their cheap shared hosting plans. But if you want to have an acceptable speed, you need a VPS-level hosting.\n\nThere can be only one reason why you may want using comparatively affordable shared hosting (less than $10/mo) for e-commerce website. Even if the hosting plan is a powerful shared hosting like SiteGround’s GoGeek, it can be used only in case of your business is not really running yet and you still in the phase of setting it up and tuning it. Don’t expect to get any decent speed. And of course no sweet cookies like backups, staging area, extra security and so on.\n\nYou can’t get a desired fast speed on a shared hosting running an e-commerce shop. It will be not as fast as you would really want it. It does not mean very slow, but definitely your visitors will notice that it’s not fast.\n\nHowever, if GoGeek plan of SiteGround did satisfy you with speed, then the most powerful shared hosting options from other hosts can still be an option for you. Read the section above for the options in this case. In short, I recommend the powered shared hosting plans in a pricing range of $10-15/mo provided by VeeroTech and GeekStorage. You get not worse performance for less money, but you lose extra approachable support and other sweet options that you enjoy at SiteGround’s GoGeek plan.\n\nHigh-performance or semi-dedicated shared hosting plans (I describe these options here) can also be used.\n\nBut after all, the VPS-level hosting plans with the pricing starting from $30/mo is something that you ideally need to look for to get acceptable speed and service. Get back to the above sections starting from this point and re-read my SiteGround’s GoGeek’s alternative hosting suggestions.\n\nAlternatives to SiteGround’s GrowBig plan\n\nIf the renewal price of SiteGround’s GrowBig plan is generally okay to you\n\nThe renewal price of SiteGround’s GrowBig plan is almost $20/mo. This price is below the price of a fully managed hosting of an entry level provided by most other hosting companies. In other words, for this price you have a quite limited choice of other fully managed hosts.\n\nThe reason why SiteGround’s GrowBig plan costs less than other advanced managed hosts is that this plan is a middle point between a shared hosting and managed hosting. Before all, with this plan you get a quite moderate performance and not that level of priority support compared to what you get with more expensive plans.\n\nSo, if you are satisfied with renewal pricing, but still looking for another host, then SiteGround may disappoint you with something. In many cases there are two reasons for that:\n\nYou website or websites become heavier and you need better speed.\n\nYou website or websites get increasing traffic and you think of getting a similarly priced host but which can handle your traffic.\n\nLet’s see these options separately.\n\nIf you need a better or a comparable speed\n\nFor noticeably better speed for the similar money you need a powerful shared hosting plan. You get more speed but in return you get less service.\n\nIf you have just one website and your traffic is comparatively small, consider these hosts and the advanced plans first for a great speed (with prices $10-19/mo on monthly plans): FlyWheel, Liquidweb, Lightningbase. I discussed these options above.\n\nThe options above are not shared hosts and have better service quality (infrastructure, security, backups, support). So they are more preferable options if their restrictions (the storage, the number of pageviews/visits, the number of sites which is one site for this price less than $19/mo).\n\nBut if you go out of these restrictions (number of sites, pageviews), then in order to be within the budget I recommend the following options among shared hosting plans. They will give you great speed (because of the higher RAM/CPU resources compared to typical shared hosts). These options are also suitable for handling tons of traffic. Here they are:\n\nVeeroTech (SSD Business or WordPress Pro plans). On a top of comparatively good performance and really helpful support you get daily backups (daily backups stored for 30 days) and extra security in terms of DDoS.\n\nGeekStorage (Performance Hosting plans). It’s even cheaper than VeeroTech. But you don’t get even less whistles and bells. In particular, there are no automatic backups except one last-night backup for emergency purpose. Performance and ticket support – bare minimum alternative of SiteGround’s GoGeek plan if you want to save big with no speed sacrifice.\n\nGreat performance and technical support with tickets – this is what you get with these hosts under $16/mo. Notice that you are not bound with long-term contracts. Month-to-month pricing is just 10-15% more than early contract pricing.\n\nIf you need to handle more traffic\n\nActually, the hosts that I just mentioned above suit great for handling more traffic. These hosts are great options for both a single website and multiple websites. However, these hosts (VeeroTech and GeekStorage) at the price below $20/mo have limited service of an advanced type. For example, staging area and extra security protection are missing.\n\nAnother option within this price range that I recommend if you have one website is LiquidWeb WordPress plan. $19 per month on monthly plan and you get 15GB space, iThemes Security Pro service included, staging area and the famous LiquidWeb support (phone, chat, tickets). This is a premium option and it’s more advantageous than shared hosts mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\nIf you want to pay less than the renewal price of SiteGround’s GrowBig plan\n\nSome of the hosts that I mentioned in the previous section are actually cheaper than $20/mo. So you are welcome to read that again.\n\nAnd now let’s see the advantages and disadvantages of the options I suggest as a replacement of SiteGround’s GrowBig plan:\n\nVeeroTech’s WordPress Pro costs $11/mo and is pretty powerful. Compared to SiteGround’s GrowBig plan you will definitely not lose speed. SSD Business plan is a similar plan but with more storage which cost $16/mo (yearly contract is even cheaper). Daily backups for 30 days and extra DDoS security is good bonus to the service.\n\nAnother alternative that I can recommend is GeekStorage. Its Performance plans (PX-1, PX-2, PX-3) are limited in terms of number of websites and storage, but they are more powerful (faster) than its unlimited plans. PX-3 is the most powerful plan in this series and it costs $20/mo if paid monthly (and less than $10/mo on yearly contract).\n\nThe general advantage of the above options is that you get the hosting infrastructure which is more than enough for hosting websites. The technical support is very good and makes it safe for you in case of issues.\n\nBoth alternative companies are not large compared to SiteGround. Anyway the hosts are well-established, solid and reliable providers.\n\nSaving even more\n\nIf the price $10/mo is still too much for you, then there are still options for you.\n\nYou have basically two choices: using an affordable shared hosting plan of a reliable hosting provider or going with unmanaged VPS / Cloud. I’ve explained these options in the section above.\n\nIn short, for this price you can’t be expecting a very high speed if you have a heavy website with lots of plugins. But if you choose a shared hosting plan carefully, the performance will not be a problem compared to SiteGround’s GrowBig plan. I suggest looking at GeekStorage’s Performance plan PX-2 before all. For less than $7/mo on yearly contract you get very good server resources for this price.\n\nAnd as regards unmanaged VPS or a cloud option, this will give you much better performance that you can get with any shared hosting. And it costs as much as $5/mo. But you get no technical support as you can get with any managed hosting (including any shared hosting). You need to know Linux or learn it being aware of the risk of failure (downtime, broken site etc).\n\nAlternatives to SiteGround’s StartUp plan\n\nIf the renewal price of SiteGround’s StartUp plan is generally okay to you\n\nThe renewal price of SiteGround’s StartUp plan is almost $12/mo. This is not cheap, but it’s less than the pricing of fully managed hosts of similar configuration.\n\nThe most of the SiteGround’s StartUp plan price you pay is for the client and technical support. So, if you appreciate the service you get with SiteGround and the price is not a concern to you, why not renewing the SiteGround’s StartUp plan and continue enjoying it? But I think it’s overpriced (I mean the increased price after renewal).\n\nHowever, if you don’t use tech support often or you are not satisfied with it or any reason, I’d suggest finding a more affordable host with the same or even better performance. GeekStorage and VeeroTech are the great option to choose from. You can read my short reviews of these hosts on this page.\n\nIf you want to pay less than the renewal price of SiteGround’s StartUp plan\n\nThe main advantage of the SiteGround’s StartUp plan is the combination of the tools, performance and support for affordable price (before renewal). By the way, as regards its performance, it’s very good, but comparable with other great-performing shared hosts.\n\nIf your main concern is speed, then I’d suggest considering more technically advanced plans from other hosts. My suggestion is the following:\n\nGeekStorage (Performance Hosting plan PX-2). It costs almost $7/mo with annual contract. You will get better speed than SiteGround’s StartUp plan. But you will have to take care of the backups completely yourself. GeekStorage keeps only one last-night backup for emergency purpose. And there’s only ticket support (although it’s good).\n\nIf your main concern is paying monthly, then my first recommendation for you is VeeroTech’s SSD Micro plan. For just $6/mo (month-to-month) you get decent performance, a ticket support, daily backups stored for 30 days.\n\nThere are other shared hosts which offer plans below the SiteGround’s StartUp renewal price. You can have a list of my recommended hosts here.\n\nConclusions\n\nSiteGround shared hosting plans may seem like unbeatable options because of comparatively high quality of the service for the low price during the initial billing period. But when your first billing period is over you have to pay almost a triple price for renewal. In some cases this price may be justified. But in most cases you are not simply ready to pay that much.\n\nIn this article I presented alternative hosting options for you which let you take advantage of better performance or/and fewer prices. If it’s time to move on to another hosting from SiteGround, you have my recommendations now.\n\nDon’t hesitate to contact me if you need a more personal advice.\n\nP.S.: I have not mentioned Cloudways which could be considered as a much cheaper and faster alternative to SiteGround. I have a whole article devoted to this host. Continue here if you are interested.\n\nYou can download a PDF version of this article (722 KB):\n\nShare the knowledge...\n\nLinkedin"
