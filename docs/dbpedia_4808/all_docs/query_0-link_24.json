        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nOver the last 12 months, we have been working hard on new in-house developed chat software. The aim was to implement a series of improvements that would make the customer experience better and the work of our customer care departments even more efficient. Now I am very happy to announce that the new chat has been launched and we are already enjoying all the great improvements it introduced.\n\nPretty and Personal\n\nWell, yes, we put quite an effort in the design in order to make the chat easier and more pleasing to our clients. We also made it very personal, so that you feel at first sight that you are chatting with a friend who cares. And in order to get to know our operators and learn more about them, we made their personal profiles more visible. With just a single click, you could check the profile of the operator you are chatting with, learn more about their interests and their work experience at SiteGround.\n\nMobile-friendly\n\nOf course we also made this fancy interface compatible with mobile devices, so our customers could come to chat with us using their mobile devices without the annoying scroll.\n\nFaster Connection\n\nWe wanted a faster chat connection. Now you get connected twice as fast to an available operator compared to the old chat software. One of the reasons for this fast connection is the usage of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) protocol, which makes the exchange of messages and presence information nearly instantaneous.\n\nIntegrated Tools to help the operator\n\nNow, even the admin back end is more user-friendly, with lots of tools inbuilt in order to speed up the actions of the operator when diagnosing a problem for the client. The operator sees if the server of the client is down and the internal notices reporting the event and the reasons for it. The operator can perform client-side checks for site and email service and automatically forward that report to a higher-end technical support on behalf of the client.\n\nMore efficient chat distribution system\n\nWe have a new system for distributing chats among operators, considering their skill level and number of active chats at the moment. Thus we achieve more efficient resource allocation, better quality of chats and faster servicing of the client.\n\nIt seems our customers are already enjoying the changes made! In the last month since we started using the new software, we received double the number of excellent ratings compared to the previous month. Weâ€™ve also received some feedback emails from our customers, expressing how great our new chat is. Thanks to all of you for sharing your feedback with us!\n\nYour Comment Cancel\n\nError!\n\nI agree to the SiteGround Privacy Policy.
