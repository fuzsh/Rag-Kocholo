        "text": "SiteGround and Hostgator are among the top choices of web hosting providers on the market.\n\nWhile SiteGround is recommended as a top choice for WordPress hosting, Hostgator is known for its affordable pricing.\n\nBoth hosting providers have surely earned their place among the world’s best. We’ve tried both of them and we’re here to share our experience.\n\nAs digital experts who have tried both services, we’re here to share our insights.\n\nIn our head-to-head analysis, we compare SiteGround and HostGator on over 16 features and performance tests, ultimately crowning a winner in this fierce battle.\n\nOur comparison spans essential categories, such as speed, uptime, security, server performance, and customer service, to help you make an informed decision about which provider best meets your needs. So, let’s dive into the detailed evaluation of SiteGround and HostGator.\n\nIntroducing SiteGround\n\nSiteGround was founded in 2004 in Bulgaria, and it wasn’t long before this hosting company started making waves in the hosting space.\n\nNot only does SiteGround host over 2 million websites, but it also operates with over 500 full-time team members. SiteGround stands apart from other hosting providers due to its commitment to delivering quality at every level.\n\nIt’s no surprise why WordPress.org recommends SiteGround as one of the best web hosting companies on today’s market.\n\nAdd to this mix SiteGround’s steadfast dedication to crafting state-of-the-art technology and customer support that clients rave about. All in all, contender number one is a tough one to beat.\n\nIntroducing Hostgator\n\nFounded in 2002, Hostgator made a name for itself as a leader in the hosting market due to its low-cost, beginner-friendly hosting options.\n\nIt has hosted over 2.5 million websites and operates with 1,000+ full-time team members.\n\nSo it’s no surprise why Hostgator was acquired in 2012 by the Endurance International Group (EIG) for $299.8 million! EIG now owns a solid portfolio of hosting companies and means serious business.\n\nHostgator vs SiteGround: Web Hosting Plans Compared\n\nLet’s start the analysis by comparing the plans you can access from each company.\n\nHostgatorSiteGround Cheap Shared Hosting Managed WP Hosting Managed Woocommerce Hosting Cloud HostingKind of... VPS Dedicated Server Hosting\n\nMost notably, SiteGround does not offer VPS And, Hostgator does not offer Woocommerce or true cloud-based hosting. As you can see, both web hosts offer cheap shared hosting and WordPress hosting. Other than these two, the remaining plans differ quite significantly.\n\nIf you’re building an e-commerce store using Woocommerce and you’re after managed hosting, SiteGround is the better choice for your needs. For everyone else, it’s not going to be so simple.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that moving websites to the cloud is a smart move by SiteGround. By leveraging dedicated cloud technology, SiteGround can offer the power of Google’s Cloud Platform directly to their customers.\n\nThe benefits include scalability, better uptime rates, and more secure services. Hostgator also promotes cloud-based hosting, but it’s not comparable to what SiteGround offers. You’ll learn more about this later in this article.\n\nYou’ll also find out the differences between the shared plans in more detail as it can be hard to know which is best at face value.\n\n1. Shared Hosting\n\nWhen looking at SiteGround vs Hostgator pricing, first impressions can lead you astray.\n\nBoth web hosts offer discounted pricing for new plans. The condition a customer must satisfy to secure these low rates is to sign up for a long-term plan.\n\nPromotional Pricing\n\nPlanHostgator Shared HostingSiteGround Shared Hosting Lowest Tier$2.75/month$5.99/month Middle Tier$3.50/month$8.99/month Highest Tier$5.25/month$14.99/month\n\nIf price is your biggest concern, Hostgator’s promotional pricing works out significantly cheaper. Add to it the fact that Hostgator adds further discounts during events like Black Friday and you can score even lower rates than the above!\n\nWith SiteGround, you only need to sign up for a 12-month term, but with Hostgator, you need to sign up for 36 months to secure the cheapest rates.\n\nRenewal Pricing\n\nPlanHostgator Shared HostingSiteGround Shared Hosting Lowest Tier$6.95 - $10.95/month$19.99/month Middle Tier$9.95 - $11.95/month$29.99/month Highest Tier$14.95 - $16.95/month$49.99/month\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, the level of quality is significantly different between the two. We’ll get to these differences further down…\n\nWinner: Hostgator is a clear winner on shared hosting if the price is a concern for you. It comes in at up to 70% cheaper than the price that SiteGround charges.\n\n2. Managed WordPress Website Hosting\n\nSiteGround is a great hosting provider for many WordPress users. It is recommended by WordPress.org [1], alongside DreamHost and Bluehost.\n\nIn saying this, Hostgator also offers WordPress site hosting.\n\nAs mentioned above, both SiteGround and Hostgator offer shared WP hosting and managed WP hosting. Hostgator does not offer Woocommerce hosting, so it may not be the best option for e-commerce stores on WordPress.\n\nPromotional Pricing\n\nPlanHostgator WordPress HostingSiteGround WordPress Hosting Shared WPFrom $2.75/monthFrom $5.99/month Managed WPFrom $5.95/monthFrom $5.99/month Managed WoocommerceN/AFrom $5.99/month\n\nRenewal Pricing\n\nPlanHostgator WordPress HostingSiteGround WordPress Hosting Shared WPFrom $6.95/monthFrom $19.99/month Managed WPFrom $14.95/monthFrom $19.99/month Managed WoocommerceN/AFrom $5.99/month\n\nWinner: Once again, Hostgator comes out on top with regard to pricing for shared and managed WordPress hosting.\n\n3. VPS, Dedicated & Cloud Web Hosting Plans\n\nWhen comparing dedicated and Virtual Private Server hosting to cloud-based hosting, we have to note that we’re not comparing apples to apples here.\n\nIt’s also important to note that Hostgator’s cloud plans are not comparable to those offered by Siteground. Despite using the same terminology, they’re more like shared hosting on steroids.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks about Hostgator’s cloud-based plans are that:\n\nIn other words, Hostgator’s cloud-based plans are not true hosting. For this reason, we didn’t include these plans in the comparisons below.\n\nWe’d only suggest using Hostgator’s cloud-based plans if you want to move your website to the cloud on a very low budget. Even so, the only tangible benefit you’ll get is faster loading speeds.\n\nPromotional Pricing\n\nPlanSiteGround: Cloud HostingHostgator: Dedicated HostingHostgator: VPS Hosting Lowest Tier$100/month$89.98/month$19.95/month Middle Tier$200-$300/month$119.98/month$29.95/month Highest tier$400/month$139.99/month$39.95/month\n\nRenewal Pricing\n\nPlanSiteGround: Cloud HostingHostgator: Dedicated HostingHostgator: VPS Hosting Lowest Tier$100/month$189/month$79.95/month Middle Tier$200-$300/month$249/month$119.95/month Highest tier$400/month$289/month$149.95/month\n\nOverall, Hostgator’s VPS has lower CPU core power and less storage but is also the most affordable of these three options.\n\nIt’s worth noting that SiteGround doesn’t offer promotional pricing on their cloud hosting. Despite coming in slightly more expensive initially, SiteGround offers more features and security since they leverage Google’s Cloud Platform.\n\nHostgator’s dedicated hosting services are a closer match to SiteGround’s cloud-based solutions when it comes to the resources allocated.\n\nSiteGround’s cloud storage options typically have more CPU cores. But, the SSD storage and RAM can be lower than the nearest comparable Hostgator dedicated plan.\n\nWinner: It’s a close call despite the differences in the server setup of each of these types of hosting. We’re handing it to SiteGround for this round.\n\nNot only does SiteGround leverage the Google Cloud Platform, but the renewal prices also come in lower than the costs of Hostgator’s dedicated servers.\n\nSiteGround also offers servers with greater CPU power despite having less storage and RAM on some occasions.\n\nHosting Features Comparison\n\nWhen shopping for a reliable hosting company, you need to go beyond price to find the best-performing company for your needs.\n\nThat’s why we have shared the data from the tests we’ve run comparing SiteGround and Hostgator in all the top hosting features.\n\n1. Ease of Use\n\nBoth Hostgator and SiteGround offer easy-to-use, intuitive dashboards and good hosting services. SiteGround’s team has developed a custom dashboard that is far simpler than the typical cPanel style hosting account.\n\nHostgator, on the other hand, uses the classic cPanel based solutions for most of their hosting accounts.\n\nWinner: Both are intuitive and easy to use. However, we’re handing it to SiteGround due to the wide range of 1-click install options (including a 1-click WordPress installation option too).\n\n2. Speed\n\nIt’s no surprise that Google has made website loading speed a ranking factor. Not only is it crucial for user experience, but there are direct implications between slow loading times and the profits earned.\n\nIn 2006, Amazon’s engineers discovered that for every 100ms in latency, there was a reduction in profits earned by 1%. Sure it may not sound like much but by today’s standards, 1% of Amazon’s revenue is around $3.8 billion!\n\nPoor hosting services could also be costing you a tonne of hard-earned cash.\n\nSo we put SiteGround and Hostgator to the test to see who puts their money where their mouth is.\n\nGT Metrix\n\nHostgator\n\nSiteGround\n\nPerformance ScoreTTFBPerformance ScoreTTFB Vancouver48%1.6s93%108ms London27%1.7s72%936ms Sydney12%1.3s72%1.3s269ms\n\nPingdom\n\nHostgator\n\nSiteGround\n\nPingdom PerformancePingdom Load TimePingdom PerformancePingdom Load Time San Francisco653.24s96508ms Frankfurt652.84s96726ms Tokyo653.09s96792ms London645.70s951.79s Washington DC643.65s86720ms Sydney643.41s961.21s\n\nWinner: The data doesn’t lie! Hands down, this one goes to SiteGround.\n\nIf you’re curious to see how SiteGround compares to other hosting companies, check out our post on the fastest web hosting companies.\n\n3. Uptime\n\nUptime is another critical hosting feature that a reliable hosting company shouldn’t dismiss. Any decent hosting company should prioritize uptime as a core feature of their service.\n\nIn saying that, no host can guarantee 100% uptime. SiteGround guarantees 99.98% whereas Hostgator only guarantees 99.90%.\n\nLet’s take a look at whether they live up to these guarantees.\n\nHostgator Uptime\n\nAt one point, Hostgator did have the highest uptime guarantee at 99.99%.\n\nBut, it seems that instead of ensuring their servers were able to meet this guarantee, they chose to lower the guaranteed amount quite significantly.\n\nAt the current amount of 99.90%, this allows Hostgator’s servers to experience up to 8 hours and 45 minutes of downtime per year instead of just 52 minutes – per the original guarantee.\n\nWhat’s more, Hostgator’s uptime performance in recent years has been below optimal. According to Pingdom’s uptime monitoring data[2], Hostgator’s average uptime is 99.89% since 2015.\n\nSiteGround Uptime\n\nSiteGround’s guarantee has been 99.98% and according to our uptime monitoring data, they’re been upholding it consistently since 2017.\n\nSiteGround’s average uptime since July 2017 has been 99.99%.\n\nIn 2021, Pingdom’s uptime data[3] reported only 2 months that were below 100% uptime. February 2021 was at 99.99% and October was at 99.97%.\n\nAll in all, we’re impressed!\n\nHere’s the data in a head-to-head format.\n\n2018 Uptime\n\n2019 Uptime\n\n2020 Uptime\n\n2021 Uptime\n\nHostgator99.98%99.94%99.91%99.98% SiteGround99.99%99.98%99.99%100%\n\nNot only does SiteGround maintain its guarantee across a yearly average, but their team is also proactive about improving their server performance.\n\nCheck out what we discovered in our in-depth SiteGround review.\n\nWinner: We’re handing it to SiteGround. Solid uptime is a critical feature you should be looking for in your hosting provider if you care about your site’s performance.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Hostgator who chose to lower their guaranteed uptime amount instead of improving their server infrastructure.\n\n4. Customer Support\n\nThere is no doubt that a time will come when you need to reach out to your hosting company’s customer support team. It doesn’t matter how skilled you are with building websites, hosting problems happen to the best of us.\n\nIn our book, superior customer support is what differentiates a good web hosting company from an excellent one.\n\nTo compare the level of customer support between these two hosting providers, we turned to Trustpilot. You can access Hostgator’s page here and SiteGround’s one here.\n\nSiteGround Support\n\nSiteGround customer support rating on Trustpilot\n\nHostgator Support\n\nHostgator customer support rating on Trustpilot\n\nWinner: Winner winner chicken dinner! SiteGround is no doubt the winner when it comes to customer support. With over 9,000 reviews and an average score of “Excellent”, we’re impressed.\n\nAnd, as a sweet cherry on top, we love that SiteGround proactively overstaffs every shift, so no customer is left hanging.\n\nWhat more can you ask for?\n\n5. Server Location\n\nDoes your website target audiences in a specific location?\n\nIt’s worth exploring the ideal server location for your website and ensuring your hosting company has appropriate web hosting services for you.\n\nHostgator’s data centers are located in Utah and Texas. You also cannot choose which data center your files are stored at.\n\nOn the other hand, SiteGround offers more flexibility due to the 6 locations of their data centers around the world.\n\nThey currently have servers located in:\n\nSiteGround data centers around the world.\n\nWinner: SiteGround due to the wide range of server locations available. It is also possible for you to specify which servers you prefer to use.\n\n6. Storage\n\nFor the shared plans, both Hostgator and SiteGround offer unmetered options.\n\nOf the two, SiteGround does cap the amount of web space GB available but offers unlimited databases and unmetered traffic.\n\nHostgator offers unmetered bandwidth on all plans and does not state any storage limits though a fair use policy applies.\n\nWhen it comes to the pro hosting packages, SiteGround’s cloud options are most similar to Hostgator’s dedicated plans.\n\nSiteGround’s plans offer more CPU core power. However, Hostgator’s options aren’t too shabby either. Where Hostgator shines is in the amount of SSD storage offered. It often surpasses SiteGround’s options and can be cheaper.\n\nIn saying this, the storage space alone isn’t a strong enough reason to choose a Hostgator dedicated plan over SiteGround’s cloud servers. Cloud servers offer so much more in the way of security and backups. We’ll get to that next.\n\nWinner: We’re calling this one a tie. If we were forced to pick a winner, we’re leaning (ever so slightly) towards Hostgator due to the higher amounts of SSD storage available.\n\n7. Security\n\nEvery web hosting company offers some promise along the lines of “we offer the best security features” on their website.\n\nTo know who really offers the best security, you have to dig much deeper than the surface. Here’s what we found once we dug beyond the hyped-up sales copy.\n\nSiteGroundHostgator Free SSL CertificateYes (Let’s Encrypt, pre-installed)Yes (Let’s Encrypt) Hotlink ProtectionYesYes Spam ProtectionYesPaid Option - Spam Assassin Free Automatic BackupsYes (Daily)Yes (Weekly) Web Application FirewallYesYes DDoS ProtectionYesYes Brute Force ProtectionYesYes Bot BlockingYesYes - Manual Malware ProtectionYesPaid Option 24/7 Server MonitoringYesYes WP Security PluginYes (Free)No\n\nTo achieve the same level of security with Hostgator, you’ll need to invest in upsell offers and additional plugins to do the job. When you factor in all these extra costs, Hostgator loses its price point advantage over SiteGround.\n\nWinner: SiteGround. All of the desired security features mentioned above are included for free in all of SiteGround’s plans.\n\n8. Backups\n\nWebsite backups are a critical feature. If anything ever goes wrong, you’ll want to know that you can rely on your data to be backed up.\n\nHostgator makes it very clear that they take no responsibility for failed backups. They do offer free weekly backups for customers, but they’re also “not guaranteed in any way”[4].\n\nBesides, they only take backups once a week on a random day.\n\nOn the other hand, SiteGround offers free automated daily backups on every plan (which you can restore for free anytime). Their approach is also much more proactive by offering geographically distributed redundant and mirrored backups too.\n\nThis means if a data center in a particular area went down, your website won’t go down with it.\n\nWinner: SiteGround due to including free daily backups on all plans and taking a more proactive approach than Hostgator.\n\n9. Domains\n\nHostgator offers free domains on some plans whereas SiteGround doesn’t offer free domain names at all.\n\nIn saying this, Hostgator’s domains renew from $18 per year after the initial free period.
