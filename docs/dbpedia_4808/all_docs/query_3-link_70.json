        "text": "Put simply: if you want a basic, reliable website for a low price, SiteGround is a solid hosting option. But if you need a more serious host for handling eCommerce, membership, or LMS sites, you’ll want to graduate to a more powerful host like Convesio.\n\nFounded in 2004, SiteGround is one of the longest-lived website hosting companies. For the most part, they have a good reputation, although their recent price increases have been criticized by many customers. SiteGround is a mass-market host: they have millions of customers and make money by charging very low prices. This means that SiteGround is sufficient if you are just creating a personal website. But if you need something more powerful to handle business-level traffic, SiteGround will probably come up short.\n\nConvesio, on the other hand, is a premium WordPress host that is focused on businesses, LMS sites, membership sites, and other serious websites. Convesio offers advanced cloud hosting solutions that provide better scalability and performance for high-traffic websites. Our fully managed WordPress hosting plans shave seconds off the page load times of WordPress sites. This results in a great customer experience and better SEO performance. That’s why Convesio is the one of the best managed WordPress hosts around.\n\nSimply put, if your site generates revenue for your business, SiteGround probably won’t cut it. Your ROI will be much higher on Convesio, as you won’t have any timeouts from heavy traffic loads. Plus, our expert support team means you get direct, personal support – and not the mass-market generic support solutions provided by SiteGround.\n\nSiteGround is a mass-market web hosting provider with millions of customers. Like many other legacy hosts, it uses large servers, where hundreds of websites are installed on the same physical machine. Once on that machine, you are stuck on it, unless you upgrade to an enterprise plan.\n\nWhile this does lower costs, it also means your performance and security is much lower. If you are just hosting a small personal site, this isn’t an issue. But if you need business-quality hosting, SiteGround probably won’t be sufficient to handle it.\n\nConvesio’s pricing is straightforward and transparent. All plans come with everything you need, including generous storage space, bandwidth, and enterprise software. Plus, we can offer you a free migration to a dedicated server.\n\nSiteGround, on the other hand, doesn’t include most of these extra services. You’ll need to purchase them separately and install them separately. SiteGround also strongly prefers that you sign up for an annual plan; their monthly prices are significantly more expensive.\n\nUltimately, Convesio and SiteGround provide very different types of web hosting services. SiteGround uses large servers, where many websites are installed on the same physical machine. Once on that machine, you are stuck on it, unless you upgrade to a better plan.\n\nThe primary benefit of this shared server setup is lower startup costs, plus the ability to host more sites on the same hard disk. This works best for customers that don’t need performance or uptime and instead want the absolute lowest cost possible. However, it also means that other hosting providers like Convesio provide better performance.\n\nConvesio is an expensive option to those that don’t need scalable infrastructure and we are honest about this. Convesio’s cloud hosting solutions provide better scalability and performance for high-traffic websites. We’re happy to recommend our competitors when there’s a better fit, including SiteGround!\n\nHowever, Convesio is much more affordable than SiteGround when it comes to scalability.\n\nWe’ve productized scaling WordPress and have made it affordable for everyone. You save on set up costs, can get going in minutes and don’t need to engage a SySAdmin for maintenance.\n\nWe have also bundled in premium functions that you pay extra on SiteGround — or aren’t available at all.\n\nSiteGround has pretty good reviews for support as a web hosting provider. However, because they are a huge host with vast numbers of customers, you have little access to experts. The support process is thus very impersonal and not tailored to your particular needs.\n\nSiteGround offers phone, chat, and ticket-based support systems. This does offer some flexibility, but it also means that you’ll be dealing with a different person every time you need help, which may seem impersonal to many people. At Convesio, our expert support team communicates with you consistently, building a personal relationship that lasts over time.\n\nFinally, if your site needs to scale and handle high amounts of traffic in a short period of time, SiteGround can come up short, especially in terms of support. When it comes to scaling container-based server architectures, SiteGround simply doesn’t have the expertise and know-how that Convesio does.\n\nWith Convesio, you can get WordPress support with a quick turnaround time. Convesio’s web hosting service includes 24/7 chat assistance and access via our Slack channel. Convesio staffs full-time WordPress experts that typically respond to chat messages in 30 seconds. Convesio provides 24/7 chat assistance and access via our Slack channel, which allows us to resolve technical issues without filing tickets or waiting for tier escalation support. Convesio also answers and investigates issues with WordPress that go far beyond simple server questions.\n\nOur support is 24/7, tier-less and goes the extra mile. We promise performance and scale and if this means diving deep into WordPress to resolve an issue we’ll do it.\n\nWe’ve adopted Slack as the main internal support channel. You’ll reach support first but any team member, or even multiple people, can jump in to help if needed. It’s not uncommon for our CEO, Tom Fanelli, to lend and a hand either."
