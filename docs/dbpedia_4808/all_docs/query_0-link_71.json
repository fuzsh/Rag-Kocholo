We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and companies, so all are measured equally. Read more about our editorial guidelines and the business solutions methodology for the ratings below.\n\nMore than 55 plans from 17 providers compared\n\nOver 1,200 data points collected\n\n20+ years of combined website management experience\n\n5 levels of fact-checking\n\n10 best web hosting providers of 2024\n\nScala Hosting: Best for security\n\nScala Hosting was launched in 2008 and has since grown into a top web hosting provider that hosts 700,000-plus users around the world. While it’s not the biggest web hosting company, it has made a name for itself for its low-cost managed VPS hosting plans. However, it also has industry-low introductory rates on its reliable shared web hosting plans, reasonable renewal rates, and an incredible anytime money-back guarantee.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThere’s a lot to like about Scala Hosting, but one area where it shines is in its performance and security features that not only offer fast load times but also peace of mind. Its security features include Cloudflare CDN (a global CDN), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to detect malicious traffic, automatic backups, malware scanning, and SShield—its own artificial intelligence (AI) security tool that works to identify suspicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, Scala Hosting also stands out for its unconditional anytime money-back guarantee. While a money-back guarantee has become something of an industry standard among the best web hosting companies, most offer a limited 30-day window. But with long-term, 36-month contracts, it provides a helpful peace of mind to know that you can leave any time—and for any reason.\n\nBest Scala Hosting plan for small businesses\n\nEntry Cloud is the best Scala Hosting plan for small businesses looking for a feature-packed plan that prioritizes performance and security. Plans start at $14.95 per month with the introductory rate and a 36-month term and renew at $29.95 per month. Although it’s not the lowest-priced plan on the market, it does include a number of high-value features that stand to not only provide top-notch performance but save you money. For example, it includes a dedicated IP address, a free domain, unlimited business email addresses, free Cloudflare CDN, and free daily backups.\n\nScala Hosting pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nScala Hosting has four shared web hosting packages, offering varying amounts of storage, number of websites, and extras, such as a free domain and real-time malware protection. New users can take advantage of low introductory rates, and existing users can choose between one-month, 12-month, or 36-month terms, which the latter provides long-term discounts. Additionally, Scala Hosting has a rare unconditional anytime money-back guarantee, giving users peace of mind that they can leave anytime if they aren’t satisfied with the service.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceMini10GB fixed NVMe SSD\n\nUnmetered1 website\n\nFree SSL\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nAnytime money-back guarantee$2.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $9.95 per month)Start50GB fixed NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain\n\nReal-time malware detection\n\nFree SSLs\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nAnytime money-back guarantee$5.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $12.95 per month)Advanced100GB fixed NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain\n\nReal-time malware detection\n\nFree SSLs\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nPriority support\n\nAnytime money-back guarantee$9.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $16.95 per month)Entry Cloud50GB upgradeable NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nDedicated IP address\n\nFree domain\n\nReal-time malware detection\n\nFree SSLs\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nAnytime money-back guarantee$14.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $29.95 per month)\n\nMiniStorage and bandwidth10GB fixed NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures1 website\n\nFree SSL\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nAnytime money-back guaranteeStarting price$2.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $9.95 per month)StartStorage and bandwidth50GB fixed NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain\n\nReal-time malware detection\n\nFree SSLs\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nAnytime money-back guaranteeStarting price$5.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $12.95 per month)AdvancedStorage and bandwidth100GB fixed NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain\n\nReal-time malware detection\n\nFree SSLs\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nPriority support\n\nAnytime money-back guaranteeStarting price$9.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $16.95 per month)Entry CloudStorage and bandwidth50GB upgradeable NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nDedicated IP address\n\nFree domain\n\nReal-time malware detection\n\nFree SSLs\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nFree site migration\n\nAnytime money-back guaranteeStarting price$14.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $29.95 per month)\n\nMore services from Scala Hosting\n\nIn addition to its web hosting services, Scala Hosting’s other advertised service is email hosting. Plans start at $4.95 per month with an annual contract and include up to 10 email accounts, 50GB of storage, daily offsite backups, and its unmatched anytime money-back guarantee. On top of that, it does offer other services that are available but are not widely advertised, such as domain name registration, SSL certificates, IP address check, WHOIS lookup, and an affiliate program.\n\nHostGator: Best for building a new site\n\nHostGator is a popular web hosting service that hosts 8 million websites worldwide. Originally founded out of a dorm room in 2002, it has since outgrown its humble beginnings and is now headquartered in Texas with offices around the globe. It is renowned for its low-cost shared hosting plans starting at $3.75 per month with a 36-month contract, helpful support, and a high uptime.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nHostGator is one of our top picks because its plans include a large span of features from a free domain and SSL certificate to Cloudflare CDN, and a malware scanner, giving businesses everything they need in one place to build out a new website at an affordable price. Speaking of price, plans are competitively priced at $3.75 per month as the introductory rate, which renews at $9.99 per month.\n\nAnother aspect of HostGator that we like is its large list of services and tools that are designed to help businesses start, grow, and succeed. For example, it’s one of the few web hosting companies that has professional marketing services, including pay-per-click (PPC) advertising and search engine optimization (SEO). It also offers professional web design services, making it a good choice for businesses that are building a new site and want a plan that not only includes everything they need to build and manage a site, but the ability to outsource the development to experts.\n\nBest HostGator plan for small businesses\n\nThe Business plan lands at HostGator’s best plan for small businesses due to its ultra-low introductory rate that provides a great value for budget-conscious businesses. It includes 50GB SSD storage, giving the average business ample space, unmetered bandwidth, Cloudflare CDN for enhanced performance, a domain name, SSL certificate, and daily backups free for your first year.\n\nHostGator pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nWhen it comes to HostGator’s shared hosting plans, there are three packages available: the entry-level Hatchling Plan, the midtier Baby Plan, and the top-tier Business Plan. Despite the titles, its Hatchling and Baby plans are suitable for business use and boast industry-low introductory rates, SSD storage, unmetered bandwidth, business email, a free domain and SSL certificate for your first year, WordPress preinstall, and security features, such as a malware scanner.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceHatchling10GB SSD\n\nUnmetered10 websites\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nChat support only\n\nMalware scanner\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$3.75 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $9.99 per month)Baby20GB SSD\n\nUnmetered20 websites\n\nCloudflare CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nPhone and chat support\n\nMalware scanner\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$4.50 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $14.99 per month)Business50GB SSD\n\nUnmetered50 websites\n\nCloudflare CDN\n\nFree daily backups (first year)\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nPhone and chat support\n\nMalware scanner\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$6.25 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $19.99 per month)\n\nHatchlingStorage and bandwidth10GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures10 websites\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nChat support only\n\nMalware scanner\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$3.75 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $9.99 per month)BabyStorage and bandwidth20GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures20 websites\n\nCloudflare CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nPhone and chat support\n\nMalware scanner\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$4.50 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $14.99 per month)BusinessStorage and bandwidth50GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures50 websites\n\nCloudflare CDN\n\nFree daily backups (first year)\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nPhone and chat support\n\nMalware scanner\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$6.25 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $19.99 per month)\n\nMore services from HostGator\n\nWeb hosting isn’t the only service available from HostGator. It also offers a number of website and marketing-related services and tools to help users build and grow their web presence.\n\nHere’s what HostGator offers beyond its web hosting services:\n\nDomain names\n\nWebsite builder\n\nEmail hosting with Google Workspace\n\nSSL certificates\n\nCodeGuard (automated website backups)\n\nSiteLock (web protection)\n\nProfessional services, such as web design, PPC advertising, and SEO\n\nSiteGround: Best for overall performance\n\nSiteGround is a top-rated web hosting company that is widely regarded for its fast load times and high rate of customer satisfaction from the owners of 3 million domain names worldwide. While SiteGround is based in Bulgaria, it has 11 data centers across four continents, eight countries, and four states in the United States, attributing to its high speeds and reliability. Unlike other web hosting services that offer a wide range of services, such as domain registration and website builders, SiteGround focuses on web and email hosting services only.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nSiteGround is consistently one of the fastest web hosting providers in the market and one of the few that include a free content delivery network (CDN) with every plan to further help speed up load times for data-heavy applications. Not only that, but it is also one of the most affordable high-speed solutions. However, there’s a lot more to like than speed and affordability.\n\nThough SiteGround was once a fan favorite among developers, it has grown into a beginner-friendly web hosting provider thanks to its easy-to-use dashboard, plethora of user resources, and helpful support. Unlike many other cPanels that look and feel dated, its user dashboard is very modern and well-organized so that it is intuitive—even for those with little to no experience. Its dashboard offers some stellar built-in features, such as site performance data where users can view a breakdown of their site’s traffic.\n\nWhat we also appreciate about SiteGround is that it offers a variety of security features to help users maintain a secure site. This includes user-controlled security features, such as automated daily backups, free secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates, and a site scanner to detect and report malware. Another way in which SiteGround provides peace of mind for its users is through its highly rated technical support that is quick to assist users in the resolution of issues. As mentioned above, support is available by live chat, tickets, and phone—giving users timely assistance and the ability to choose their preferred support channel.\n\nBest SiteGround plan for small businesses\n\nThe overall best SiteGround plan for small businesses is its top-tier shared web hosting plan, GoGeek. It has a competitively priced introductory rate of $7.99 per month with annual billing for your first year. It includes 40GB of storage and unmetered bandwidth for unlimited sites. Although its pricing increases greatly upon renewal to $44.99 per month, it remains a good value given its industry-high speeds, reliability, and security.\n\nSiteGround pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nPricing and plans vary based on which type of hosting plan you are interested in, but it offers three different packages for each of its self-managed hosting options, such as shared, WordPress, WooCommerce, and reseller. It boasts competitive introductory rates for its shared hosting plans starting at $2.99 per month with an annual contract and a free domain name, CDN, and a 30-day money-back guarantee for all of its shared hosting plans.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceStartUp10GB\n\nUnmetered1 website\n\nAround 10,000 monthly visitors\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$2.99 per month for your first year\n\n(renews at $17.99 per month)GrowBig20GB\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nAround 100,000 monthly visitors\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$4.99 per month for your first year\n\n(renews at $29.99 per month)GoGeek40GB\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nAround 400,000 monthly visitors\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$7.99 per month for your first year\n\n(renews at $44.99 per month)\n\nStartUpStorage and bandwidth10GB\n\nUnmeteredFeatures1 website\n\nAround 10,000 monthly visitors\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$2.99 per month for your first year\n\n(renews at $17.99 per month)GrowBigStorage and bandwidth20GB\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nAround 100,000 monthly visitors\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$4.99 per month for your first year\n\n(renews at $29.99 per month)GoGeekStorage and bandwidth40GB\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nAround 400,000 monthly visitors\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$7.99 per month for your first year\n\n(renews at $44.99 per month)\n\nMore services from SiteGround\n\nSiteGround’s web hosting plans are feature-rich, offering an array of services to its users. Additionally, it also offers email hosting services for those who are looking for competitively priced business email that uses your own domain name.\n\nHere are the services offered by SiteGround:\n\nFree domains (for new users)\n\nFree SSL certificates\n\nFree email accounts for web hosting users\n\nFree email migrator tool\n\nAutomatic daily backups (with up to 30 daily backup copies for shared hosting plans)\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nSuperCacher\n\nSite scanner tool\n\nEmail hosting packages (starting from $2.40 per month)\n\nDreamHost: Best for beginners\n\nThough DreamHost is one of the older web hosting providers on our list with a 1997 launch, it has more recently risen through the ranks to become recognized as one of the best web hosting services. It now hosts over 1.5 million websites worldwide and offers a wide range of web hosting and website-related services and tools, such as domain name registration, email hosting, and professional development and marketing services.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nTrailing right behind HostGator in our ranking, DreamHost is similarly a top web hosting provider between its feature-rich packages that include all the must-have items when building a new website and pro services that enable users to outsource larger projects or technical tasks, whether that be complete web design or one-time development projects.\n\nWhat we also like about DreamHost is that its introductory rates are highly competitive and its cPanel is user-friendly—even for the novice user. All of its domain names come with free domain name privacy to help secure your contact information and prevent becoming inundated with spam in the process. Last but not least, its support is very helpful, and it has an industry-leading 97-day money-back guarantee, which is overshadowed by one host on our list, Scala Hosting, which has a money-back guarantee with no expiration date.\n\nBest DreamHost plan for small businesses\n\nDreamHost’s Shared Unlimited plan is one of the best values available with its unlimited SSD storage and unlimited sites with an introductory rate of $4.50 per month (with a 36-month commitment) and $14.99 per month upon renewal. With unlimited SSD storage, businesses don’t have to worry about exceeding storage limits or impacting site performance, and with its inclusion of unlimited websites, it’s a great value for businesses that manage multiple websites.\n\nDreamHost pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nTo help make your decision easier, DreamHost offers two shared hosting packages. The Shared Starter plan starts at $2.59 per month with a 36-month commitment and renews at $6.99 per month. Its plans are feature-rich with the inclusion of everything you would need to build a new website, such as SSD storage, unmetered bandwidth, one-click WordPress installation, free automated WordPress migration, a free domain for your first year, free SSL certificates, and more. For those who are looking for an affordable solution to host multiple sites, its Shared Unlimited plan includes unlimited storage for unlimited websites.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceShared Starter50GB SSD\n\nUnmetered1 website\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n6 MySQL Databases\n\nWordPress Website Builder\n\n97-day money-back guarantee\n\n$3.75 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $9.99 per month)Shared UnlimitedUnlimited SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\nUnlimited MySQL Databases\n\nWordPress Website Builder\n\n97-day money-back guarantee$4.50 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $14.99 per month)\n\nShared StarterStorage and bandwidth50GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures1 website\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n6 MySQL Databases\n\nWordPress Website Builder\n\n97-day money-back guarantee\n\nStarting price$3.75 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $9.99 per month)Shared UnlimitedStorage and bandwidthUnlimited SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\nUnlimited MySQL Databases\n\nWordPress Website Builder\n\n97-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$4.50 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $14.99 per month)\n\nMore services from DreamHost\n\nIn addition to web hosting services, DreamHost also offers a number of web-related tools and services to help businesses build their site and grow their business, such as:\n\nDomain names\n\nEmail hosting\n\nWebsite builder\n\nWeb design services, including custom development\n\nWebsite management services\n\nMarketing services\n\nGoDaddy: Best for scalability\n\nAnother long-standing web service company, GoDaddy started in 1997 in Arizona where it is still headquartered. It originally started as a domain name registrar, and has since expanded into a web host, website builder, digital marketing, and e-commerce services provider. It now has 21 million customers worldwide across its myriad of web-related products and services, including its low-cost, high-performance web hosting services.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThere is a lot to like about GoDaddy’s web hosting plans. It offers a long list of performance and security-enhancing features, such as optimized servers, high-speed SSD storage, and a free dedicated internet protocol (IP) with its high-performance plans. Plans also include a free WordPress migration tool to make the process of moving an existing site to GoDaddy painless. It’s also one of the few hosts to offer a myriad of other tools businesses commonly rely on, such as a business phone number, a point-of-sale (POS) system, and SEO services.\n\nWhere it shines when it comes to offering plans that businesses can grow and scale with. This gives businesses the opportunity to start with an entity-level plan and upgrade as necessary with time. For example, it has low-cost VPS hosting plans starting at $8.99 per month with a three-year term and an affordable Managed WordPress hosting service starting at $10.99 per month with a three-year term.\n\nBest GoDaddy plan for small businesses\n\nThe best web hosting plan for small businesses from GoDaddy is the Web Hosting Ultimate plan. This is because it offers a solid 75GB of SSD storage for fast speeds—even for content-heavy sites, unmetered bandwidth, a free domain for your first year, unlimited free SSL certificates, automatic daily backups, and a free WordPress migration service for those moving from a different host.\n\nGoDaddy pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nIn terms of shared hosting, GoDaddy has four shared hosting packages with varying amounts of databases, storage, and websites. Its competitively priced introductory rates reflect a long-term, three-year term, meaning that users must pay for the entirety of the three years upfront, similar to most introductory rates.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceWeb Hosting Economy25GB nonvolatile memory express (NVMe) solid-state drive (SSD)\n\nUnmetered1 website\n\n10 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$5.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $9.99 per month)Web Hosting Deluxe50GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmetered10 websites\n\n25 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nUnlimited free SSLs\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$7.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $13.99 per month)Web Hosting Ultimate75GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmetered25 websites\n\n50 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nUnlimited free SSLs\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$12.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $17.99 per month)Web Hosting Maximum100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmetered50 websites\n\n100 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nUnlimited free SSLs\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$17.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $24.99 per month)\n\nWeb Hosting EconomyStorage and bandwidth25GB nonvolatile memory express (NVMe) solid-state drive (SSD)\n\nUnmeteredFeatures1 website\n\n10 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nFree SSL (first year)\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$5.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $9.99 per month)Web Hosting DeluxeStorage and bandwidth50GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures10 websites\n\n25 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nUnlimited free SSLs\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$7.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $13.99 per month)Web Hosting UltimateStorage and bandwidth75GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures25 websites\n\n50 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nUnlimited free SSLs\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$12.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $17.99 per month)Web Hosting MaximumStorage and bandwidth100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures50 websites\n\n100 databases\n\nFree domain (first year)\n\nUnlimited free SSLs\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nFree WordPress migration\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$17.99 per month with 3-year term\n\n(renews at $24.99 per month)\n\nMore services from GoDaddy\n\nGoDaddy has grown into a provider that offers a lot more than feature-heavy web hosting packages. It boasts one of the largest ranges of services and tools among web hosting providers, such as:\n\nDomain names\n\nWebsite builder\n\nWeb design services\n\nSEO services\n\nFree logo maker\n\nBusiness phone number\n\nEmail hosting\n\nManaged WooCommerce stores\n\nPOS system\n\nTMDHosting: Best for tailored hosting solutions\n\nTMDHosting has become one of the best web hosting providers since it launched 15 years ago in Orlando, Florida. It offers a wide range of web hosting solutions, including tailored hosting solutions for businesses of all sizes. Where it stands out is for its state-of-the-art data centers across the globe in six countries and four continents, cutting-edge infrastructure, and offering of fully managed hosting that can be customized to suit your unique needs.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nWhat’s unique about TMDHosting is that it offers such a wide range of hosting plans, giving users the ability to get a hosting plan that precisely fits the needs of their website or application. So, while it’s not necessary to use a tailored hosting solution, it does give users that do better performance. Another aspect of its tailored hosting plans that we appreciate is that prices are not inflated. Instead, its pricing remains on par with many of the top hosts that offer generic hosting plans for a wide range of uses and applications.\n\nSpeaking of affordability, TMDHosting also stands out for its fully managed hosting plans at affordable prices. Plans start at $2.99 per month with its introductory rate with an annual commitment and renew at $9.99 per month—making it one of the most affordable managed WordPress hosting plans in the industry. On top of that, its plans include a number of money-saving features, such as free domain and SSL certificate, Cloudflare CDN, free website transfer, and use of the Weebly website builder for free.\n\nBest TMDHosting plan for small businesses\n\nIf you’re a small business looking for the best value for unlimited SSD storage for unlimited sites, the TMDHosting Enterprise plan is a good solution. It has a low introductory rate of $8.99 per month and costs $19.99 per month upon renewal. While it’s not the cheapest plan on the market, it is packed with money-saving features as well as features and tools to enhance your site’s speed, performance, and security.\n\nTMDHosting pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nIn terms of shared hosting plans, TMDHosting has three plans for either Linux or Windows. All shared plans include a 99.9% uptime guarantee, unmetered bandwidth, a free cPanel, unlimited email accounts, free site transfer service, free SSL certificates, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Instead, it focuses its efforts on its sleuth of tailored web hosting plans and top-notch support.\n\nNamecheap: Best for affordability\n\nOriginally a domain name registrar, Namecheap started in 2000 and has since grown to become a source for domains, web hosting, email, marketing, and security services. It offers a range of different web hosting services to meet nearly any budget or need, but it stands out for its ultralow introductory and renewal rates that start as low as $1.58 per month with a two-year term.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nIt’s difficult to beat Namecheap’s ultralow pricing—and it’s not only its domain names that are cheap (as the name implies). Not only are its introductory rates on its web hosting plans industry-low, but so are its renewal rates, making it one of the most affordable web hosting services available. What’s more, while many of the top web hosting services offer low intro rates, most intro rates reflect a long, three-year commitment paid in full upfront. Meanwhile, Namecheap’s lowest price is available with a 24-month term and for those who aren’t ready to commit that much time, its month-to-month plans start at $4.48 per month.\n\nOf course, Namecheap’s low pricing wouldn’t be of any value if it didn’t offer a quality service. It’s reliable and offers a 99.9% uptime guarantee to back it. Although this uptime guarantee is industry-standard, what’s unique about it is that for every hour that the server is down, Namecheap extends your service for one day. Additionally, plans include a variety of extras, giving users a lot for such a low price.\n\nBest Namecheap plan for small businesses\n\nThe Stellar Plus plan ranks as our best Namecheap plan for small businesses. This is thanks to its ultra-low pricing for both its introductory and renewal rates and its long list of features and inclusions, giving businesses a great deal of value for their money. For example, its introductory rate starts at $2.28 per month with a two-year term and includes unlimited websites, SSD storage, bandwidth, and email inboxes. It also includes automatic backups, a free domain and SSL certificate (with automatic installation), supersonic CDN, and a free website migration for those moving to Namecheap from another host.\n\nNamecheap pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nWith three shared hosting plans to choose from, Namecheap gives potential customers the opportunity to buy a feature-rich plan at an industry-low price of as low as $1.58 per month (introductory rate with a 24-month term). While its share hosting plans do not offer as many performance and security-enhancing features as SiteGround or Scala Hosting, it does include a number of features that can save users money, such as free business email and a domain name.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceStellar20GB SSD\n\nUnmetered3 websites\n\nFree domain name\n\nFree SSL with automatic installation\n\nFree supersonic CDN\n\n30 email accounts\n\nFree website migration\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$1.58 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $4.48 per month)Stellar PlusUnmetered\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain name\n\nFree SSL with automatic installation\n\nFree supersonic CDN\n\nUnlimited email accounts\n\nAutomatic backups\n\nFree website migration\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$2.28 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $6.48 per month)Stellar Business50GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain name\n\nFree SSL with automatic installation\n\nFree supersonic CDN\n\nUnlimited email accounts\n\nAutomatic backups\n\nFree website migration\n\n100% uptime guarantee\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$4.48 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $9.48 per month)\n\nStellarStorage and bandwidth20GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures3 websites\n\nFree domain name\n\nFree SSL with automatic installation\n\nFree supersonic CDN\n\n30 email accounts\n\nFree website migration\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$1.58 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $4.48 per month)Stellar PlusStorage and bandwidthUnmetered\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain name\n\nFree SSL with automatic installation\n\nFree supersonic CDN\n\nUnlimited email accounts\n\nAutomatic backups\n\nFree website migration\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$2.28 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $6.48 per month)Stellar BusinessStorage and bandwidth50GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\nFree domain name\n\nFree SSL with automatic installation\n\nFree supersonic CDN\n\nUnlimited email accounts\n\nAutomatic backups\n\nFree website migration\n\n100% uptime guarantee\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$4.48 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $9.48 per month)\n\nMore services from Namecheap\n\nNamecheap offers a number of services beyond web hosting. For example, it also offers the following website, security, and marketing-related tools and services:\n\nDomain name registration\n\nEmail hosting\n\nSSL certificates\n\nWebsite security\n\nFastVPN\n\nCyber insurance (provided by Coalition)\n\nAnti-spam protection\n\nBusiness formation\n\nMarketing services, such as SEO, social media, ads, and online reputation\n\nSite builder\n\nLogo maker\n\nBusiness name generator\n\nBusiness card maker\n\nA2 Hosting: Best for speed\n\nA2 Hosting started back in 2001 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as a web hosting provider focused on reliability and support. However, upon surveying its entire customer base nearly a decade ago, it discovered that what customers wanted most was a hosting service with fast load speeds, at which point it refocused its efforts on both reliability and speed. It has since become known for its fast load times, which not only improves user experience (UX) for site visitors but helps the sites it hosts rank better in organic search.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nWhat we like most about A2 Hosting is its fast load speeds, which provide a good UX─\n\nbecause nobody likes a site that’s slow to loadand improved SEO. According to speed tests from A2 Hosting, “the average Time to First Byte (TTFB), or the time between creating a connection to the server and downloading the page contents, was reduced by 68% on its Turbo platform.” It’s time to last byte (or time to deliver the rest of the page) also saw a 47% reduction.\n\nIt achieves this through a multitude of factors, such as its proprietary “Turbo” servers, unlimited transfer with every shared plan, SSD speed boost, optimized software, such as for WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, the ability to choose your server location (Michigan, Arizona, Amsterdam or Singapore), Anycast DNS, preconfigured site caching, and more. On top of that, it’s not only high-speed, but it’s fairly priced making it a good choice for those who seek an affordable yet high-performance host.\n\nBest A2 Hosting plan for small businesses\n\nThe Turbo Max hosting plan is the ideal plan from A2 Hosting for small businesses whose priority is speed. With its 100GB NVMe SSD storage, unlimited databases, and turbo servers, users experience 40% faster AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) performance and double the speed to the first byte. Although it doesn’t include extras that those building a new site need, such as a domain name, it does include free site migration for those with an existing site and free automatic backups from JetBackup.\n\nA2 Hosting pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nA2 Hosting gives users four shared hosting plans to choose from, each with a varying number of websites, storage limits, and feature sets. Introductory rates start at $1.95 per month with a 36-month term and increase upon renewal to $12.99 per month. However, it’s worth noting that A2 Hosting has the biggest price increases of any provider on our list, with rates jumping over 330% at the end of the introductory term.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceStartup10GB SSD\n\nUnmetered1 website\n\n5 databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$1.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $12.99 per month)Drive25GB SSD\n\nUnmetered5 websites\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree automatic backups\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$3.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $15.99 per month)Turbo Boost50GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmetered15 websites\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree automatic backups\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$4.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $24.99 per month)Turbo Max100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmetered30 websites\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree automatic backups\n\n30-day money-back guarantee$13.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $29.99 per month)\n\nStartupStorage and bandwidth10GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures1 website\n\n5 databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$1.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $12.99 per month)DriveStorage and bandwidth25GB SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures5 websites\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree automatic backups\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$3.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $15.99 per month)Turbo BoostStorage and bandwidth50GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures15 websites\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree automatic backups\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$4.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $24.99 per month)Turbo MaxStorage and bandwidth100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures30 websites\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nFree SSL\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree automatic backups\n\n30-day money-back guaranteeStarting price$13.95 per month for 36 months\n\n(renews at $29.99 per month)\n\nMore services from A2 Hosting\n\nBeyond web hosting, A2 Hosting also offers a handful of other products and services, such as domain name registration, a beginner-friendly site builder, and SSL certificates for those who have a site and simply need to add an SSL. Unlike other web hosting services, such as DreamHost and Namecheap, it does not offer marketing or web development services.\n\nMochaHost: Best for Java\n\nSince its launch in 2002, MochaHost has become a top web hosting provider that prides itself on instant customer support and environmentally conscious hosting. It takes a modern approach to web hosting with a streamlined cPanel, dynamic load speeds that automatically adjust based on your traffic, and the ability to choose your server.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nBetween its low prices and quality service, there’s a lot to like about MochaHost. But what we like most about it is its tailored web hosting plans that give users the ability to choose a plan that is designed to meet the unique needs of their particular content management system (CMS), such as WordPress or Java. Although it’s not uncommon for hosts to offer WordPress plans, it’s rare to find a hosting provider that offers such affordably priced WordPress hosting plans and never mind Java hosting plans.\n\nSpecific plans aside, MochaHost offers a whole host of features within its hosting packages that lead to steady uptimes and improved security. For example, it gives users the ability to select between Linux and Windows hosting as well as the option to choose their preferred hosting location. It’s also one of the few hosts that provides an eco-friendly hosting option that is carbon-neutral and committed to sustainable initiatives.\n\nBest MochaHost plan for small businesses\n\nSmall businesses with a website built on WordPress will find MochaHost’s WP Professional plan to be a solid option. It has an introductory rate of $12.45 per month with a 24-month term, which renews at $24.99 per month. What makes it ideal for WordPress users is that it is optimized for WordPress websites. It is a high-value plan that includes unlimited websites with unlimited NVMe SSD storage and bandwidth. It also includes 3 vCPU Cores, 5GB of random-access memory (RAM) Guaranteed, and nine server locations around the globe.\n\nMochaHost pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nChoose from four shared web hosting packages, starting at $3.14 per month with its introductory offer (3-year term). Plans boast a long list of features that largely center around performance and security, such as SSD storage, multiple server locations, and the LiteSpeed web server.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting priceSoho30GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmetered1 website\n\n1 vCPU Core\n\n1GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree weekly backups$3.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $6.35 per month)Business50GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\n1 vCPU Core\n\n1GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree weekly backups\n\nFree domain$4.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $8.35 per month)Mocha100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\n2 vCPU Core\n\n4GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree weekly backups\n\nFree domain$6.68 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $13.35 per month)UltimateUnlimited NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredUnlimited websites\n\n3 vCPU Core\n\n5GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree domain$11.95 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $23.99 per month)\n\nSohoStorage and bandwidth30GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeatures1 website\n\n1 vCPU Core\n\n1GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree weekly backupsStarting price$3.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $6.35 per month)BusinessStorage and bandwidth50GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\n1 vCPU Core\n\n1GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree weekly backups\n\nFree domainStarting price$4.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $8.35 per month)MochaStorage and bandwidth100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\n2 vCPU Core\n\n4GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree weekly backups\n\nFree domainStarting price$6.68 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $13.35 per month)UltimateStorage and bandwidthUnlimited NVMe SSD\n\nUnmeteredFeaturesUnlimited websites\n\n3 vCPU Core\n\n5GB Virtual Memory\n\nFree SSLs\n\nFree site migration\n\nFree daily backups\n\nFree domainStarting price$11.95 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $23.99 per month)\n\nMore services from MochaHost\n\nIn addition to its hosting services, MochaHost also offers a top-rated domain name registration service. While it’s not the cheapest domain registrar on the market, it does offer transparent pricing as well as free domain name privacy, so your personal information will be hidden from the otherwise public WHOIS registry, free web forwarding, and unlimited email forwarding.\n\nHostinger: Best for WordPress\n\nHostinger was launched back in 2004 with the goal of helping to unlock the power of the internet for millions. The lofty goal was backed by a free web hosting service, which helped catapult the provider. Since then, it nixed its free plan, but it has risen in popularity with over 2 million customers worldwide. While it offers something for everyone, it stands out for WordPress users as its managed WordPress hosting plans are not only high-quality but come at an industry-low price.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nWhile Hostinger offers a wide range of plans that suit everything from basic business websites and blogs to online games, it stands out for its managed WordPress hosting plans. At first glance, it may seem like about every host offers managed WordPress hosting, although Hostinger’s plan is different. Not only does it have an industry-low price for a managed plan, but it also boasts fast speeds with its LiteSpeed web servers, IPv6, and HTTP/3 for fast data transfer, object cache to decrease response time, automatic image optimization, code minification, and more.\n\nOn top of speed, its managed WordPress plans include some unique features that you’ll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere at such a competitive price. For example, it has a one-click WordPress staging tool to help you make site changes safely, smart automatic WordPress updates, and a WordPress development toolkit, which includes WP-CLI, SSH access, PHP version control, and Git integration.\n\nLearn more: Read our Hostinger review.\n\nBest Hostinger plan for small businesses\n\nWe recommend Cloud Startup to small businesses seeking an affordable, yet surprisingly powerful web hosting solution. For as little as $7.99 per month with its introductory offer for 48 months and a $24.99 per month renewal rate, users get 200GB of NVMe storage, LiteSpeed cache for WordPress acceleration, access to its WordPress staging tool, auto-updates for WordPress, daily backups, free site migration, and a dedicated IP address.\n\nHostinger pricing and shared hosting plans\n\nIn terms of shared hosting plans, Hostinger has three packages to choose from: Premium, Business, and Cloud Startup. Each plan includes ample NVMe storage, unlimited bandwidth, free automatic website migration, free email, unlimited SSL certificates, backups, a WordPress vulnerabilities scanner, and a free domain for your first year.\n\nPlansStorage and bandwidthFeaturesStarting pricePremium100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnlimited100 websites\n\nFree domain\n\nFree SSLs\n\nWeekly backups\n\nFree site migration\n\nLiteSpeed cache$3.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $6.35 per month)Business200GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnlimited100 websites\n\nFree domain\n\nFree SSLs\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree site migration\n\nLiteSpeed cache\n\nFree CDN\n\nWordPress staging tool$4.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $8.35 per month)Cloud Startup200GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnlimited100 websites\n\nFree domain\n\nFree SSLs\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree site migration\n\nLiteSpeed cache\n\nFree CDN\n\nWordPress staging tool\n\nDedicated IP address$6.68 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $13.35 per month)\n\nPremiumStorage and bandwidth100GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnlimitedFeatures100 websites\n\nFree domain\n\nFree SSLs\n\nWeekly backups\n\nFree site migration\n\nLiteSpeed cacheStarting price$3.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $6.35 per month)BusinessStorage and bandwidth200GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnlimitedFeatures100 websites\n\nFree domain\n\nFree SSLs\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree site migration\n\nLiteSpeed cache\n\nFree CDN\n\nWordPress staging toolStarting price$4.18 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $8.35 per month)Cloud StartupStorage and bandwidth200GB NVMe SSD\n\nUnlimitedFeatures100 websites\n\nFree domain\n\nFree SSLs\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree site migration\n\nLiteSpeed cache\n\nFree CDN\n\nWordPress staging tool\n\nDedicated IP addressStarting price$6.68 per month for 24 months\n\n(renews at $13.35 per month)\n\nMore services from Hostinger\n\nWeb hosting is Hostinger’s bread and butter, although it does also offer a few other features. For example, it has a beginner-friendly website builder complete with e-commerce capabilities for as little as $2.84 per month with a 12-month term (renews at $9.99 per month), making it one of the most affordable website builders available. It also offers professional website management services and domain name registration.\n\nWhat is web hosting?\n\nFor a website to be available live on the web, it needs web hosting. In short, web hosting is a service that provides storage for website files and software. The service not only stores your web application and all of its contents, such as files, media, text, and code, on physical servers, but it makes it easily accessible to the public across various device types, including desktops, tablets, and mobile.\n\nFor this to happen, web hosting providers configure, run, and maintain physical servers, which customers then purchase access to. In other words, customers rent server space from web hosting providers. Of course, not all web hosting companies are created equally as all have a varying number of servers and server locations as well as features and services.\n\nWhen do I need a web host?\n\nFor a website to be available on the web, it must have web hosting. However, if you have used website builders in the past, such as Squarespace, Shopify, or Wix, you would not have had to purchase a web hosting plan from a third party. This is because most website builders include web hosting as part of their plans, which might help explain why website builder plans are generally more expensive than web hosting plans.\n\nMeanwhile, those who are building a site with an open-source software or content management system, such as WordPress, Joomla, Magento, Drupal, or Java will need to purchase web hosting to store website applications and content. The good news is that web hosting plans are available at affordable prices─as low as a few dollars per month. With helpful tools, connecting your site to your CMS is easier than ever.\n\nWhat are the different types of web hosting?\n\nWhen shopping for a web hosting plan, you will quickly notice that web hosting companies offer a variety of types of web hosting plans. These may include shared plans, dedicated hosting, VPS hosting, or managed hosting plans, which is right for your website will depend on your needs and budget.\n\nShared hosting\n\nThe most affordable type of web hosting is shared hosting. This is where a host sells plans to various users who share server space. Since space is shared, the pricing is lower and, with that, typically the performance is as well. Think of shared hosting as being similar to a public bus instead of a private driver. It’s far more affordable and although it may not provide the best service, it meets the needs of many. In this case, it’s often a good choice for those with basic hosting needs, such as a small business website or blog.\n\nManaged WordPress hosting\n\nFor those using the WordPress CMS who want a web hosting service that optimizes and manages their site, there are managed WordPress hosting plans. What’s different is that they typically include WordPress-specific optimizations and features designed to help improve the performance and often the security of WordPress websites. Another nice aspect of managed hosting is that it helps reduce the amount of manual maintenance required as plans typically include features, such as automated updates and one-click staging.\n\nE-commerce hosting\n\nOne option retailer may choose is e-commerce or, more specifically, WooCommerce hosting. Similar to WordPress hosting, which is geared toward WordPress users, e-commerce hosting is built to meet the needs of online retailers. This may include features, such as optimized server configurations to handle the needs of online sellers, a free website transfer service for online stores, server-side caching, and offer support with WooCommerce expertise.\n\nVPS hosting\n\nVPS hosting plans are like a hybrid between shared and dedicated hosting plans, where it uses a virtualization technology to isolate components with one server. Each VPS operates independently of each other, giving users more control and better performance. The result is that it creates a hosting environment on a shared server that acts a lot like a dedicated server. However, while VPS hosting is typically more expensive than shared hosting plans, it’s typically much more affordable than dedicated hosting plans, offering the best of both worlds, per se.\n\nDedicated hosting\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum as shared hosting, dedicated hosting plans provide dedicated server space to users. Not surprisingly, it is typically one of the most expensive types of web hosting. The reason why businesses may opt for dedicated hosting is that having an entire physical server, you get full control, high performance, and a dedicated IP address. While it’s widely considered the gold standard of web hosting plans, it’s not necessary for the average business website. Instead, it’s best suited for large or complex websites with high security needs.\n\nHow to choose the best web hosting service\n\nBetween pricing, storage, features, inclusions, and customer support, there is a lot to consider when choosing the best web hosting service for your website. Yet, the decision doesn’t have to be a difficult one. To start, look at web hosting costs. Consider both the introductory rate and renewal rates as hosting companies commonly offer very attractive introductory rates that then increase upon renewal. Also, be aware of the available contract lengths, the inclusion of long-term discounts, and extras, such as a money-back guarantee.\n\nPricing is only one element in the decision-making process. Also consider bandwidth and storage limits (the higher the better) and the type of storage, such as SSD and, more specifically, NVMe SSD, which offers an even faster data transfer speed than SSD. It’s also prudent to consider the number of server locations and the ability to choose your server location, for added speed.\n\nPlans will also include a number of features and inclusions, which should also be taken into consideration. For example, the number of vCPU Cores and amount of virtual memory, the inclusion of a CDN, automatic backups, and a cPanel. On top of that, evaluate plan inclusions, giving consideration to which are of value to you. For example, plans may include free business email, a free domain name, and free SSL certificates. However, if you already have a domain and email, these extras may not provide much by way of value to you. Meanwhile, for those who need a domain and email for their team, this could lead to a good deal of savings. Last but not least, consider support availability and service quality.\n\nTop 10 web hosting features\n\nWith so many web hosting services on the market, finding the best web hosting plan can feel like a challenge. To help, narrow your focus to the key web hosting features, such as reliability, performance, storage, and bandwidth, inclusions, such as a domain name and email hosting, a user-friendly control panel, backups, scalability, security, and support.\n\nHere are the top 10 web hosting features to consider:\n\nReliability: Web hosting services need to be reliable with a high uptime and a solid uptime guarantee.\n\nSpeed and performance: In the world of web hosting, speed, and performance are crucial for both UX and search engine optimization. High-performance hosts employ a variety of methods, such as numerous server locations, CDNs, automatic image optimization, caching, SSD storage, and more.\n\nStorage and bandwidth: Generally, the higher the storage and bandwidth, the better. But it’s also worth considering the type of storage, such as SSD or NVMe SSD for improved performance.\n\nDomain names: Hosting plans often include a free domain name for your first year which can save businesses money when getting started. It’s worth considering the price on renewal as well as whether it includes domain name privacy for extra value and protection.\n\nEmail hosting: One extra that can save businesses money is the inclusion of free email hosting. Some may include a small number of email accounts, while others offer unlimited email, making it a great value for businesses with a larger number of employees.\n\nControl panel: Also known as a cPanel, it serves as the interface where users configure their web hosting account. This should be modern, well-organized, and easy to use.\n\nAutomated backups: Some hosting plans include automatic weekly, or even better, daily backups to help safeguard a website in the case of a hardware failure, attack, or simple human error.\n\nScalability: As your website grows, you will want to have a web hosting service that can grow with it with affordable plans that offer the features you need.\n\nSecurity: Most hosts include a variety of built-in security features to help further secure sites with tools, such as SSL certificates, malware scanning, network monitoring, firewalls, DDoS protection, and more.\n\nSupport: When in need, quality customer support that is available in your preferred channel, such as phone, live chat, and email, when you need it can make all the difference.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThe goal is to find a web hosting service that is not only a high performance host, but one that is also highly reliable, secure, and scalable while offering the key features and tools you need. While all of the top web hosting services offer plans to meet the needs of most businesses, each stands out for a different reason making them the ideal choice for certain goals and budgets. For example, Namecheap is the most affordable. SiteGround and A2 Hosting are best for speed and performance. DreamHost is best for beginners and those with unique needs will find TMDHosting to be a good option with its tailored hosting solutions.\n\nFor further peace of mind that you are making the right choice, all of the web hosting services on our list come with a minimum 30-day money-back guarantee. If that doesn’t sound like enough time to test drive a host, DreamHost offers a 97-day money-back guarantee and, for maximum peace of mind, Scala Hosting has an unconditional anytime money-back guarantee.\n\nOur methodology\n\nThe business solutions team at Fortune Recommends compared over 55 plans from 17 providers to compile a list of the top 10 shared web hosting plans on the market today. We chose our top picks based on the following categories:\n\nPrice at time of renewal (20%): Rather than ranking providers based on their introductory rates, we calculated this category based on the long-term expense of keeping a site up and running over time. Lower rates equate to a higher score.\n\nRenewal price increase (10%): Providers received a higher score for lower price increases at the end of an introductory term, so as to reward transparency. This way, customers will experience less of a shock at the end of their initial term.\n\nDiscounts & money-back guarantee (10%): We took a look at whether a company offers discounts for longer term lengths, as well as if they provide a money-back guarantee. The longer the guarantee, the higher the score.\n\nNumber of sites (5%): Plans received a higher score depending on the number of sites that they can support.\n\nSite storage (10%): We assigned higher rankings to plans with solid-state drives (SSDs) and unlimited storage space.\n\nGeneral features (20%): This category encompasses the basic features that are essential to most new websites, including bandwidth, WordPress installation tools, access to cPanel, and bonuses such as domain names and SSL certificates.\n\nAdditional features (15%): These are features that are nice to have, but not as essential as those in our general features category. Examples include free custom email addresses, integrated website builders, automatic backups, and access to domain name privacy protection.\n\nCustomer support (10%): Companies were scored according to the number of methods they utilize for customer support—live chat, phone, email, and self-help—as well as how readily these communication channels are available. We ranked companies with 24/7 support higher than those that only offer live support during limited hours.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nHow much does web hosting cost?\n\nThe cost of web hosting varies greatly depending on factors, such as the type of web hosting you need as well as storage limits, features, and includes. On average, you can expect to pay anywhere from a few dollars per month to $25 per month for a shared hosting plan, which is generally the most affordable type of web hosting.\n\nWhat is web hosting vs. a domain name?\n\nWeb hosting is the service that enables your website to be live on the web, ensuring multiple visitors can view it at the same time, for example. A domain name is your website’s URL or web address, such as www.fortune.com. Both are necessary when building a website.\n\nWhat is the best web hosting service for small businesses?\n\nThe best web hosting service will depend on your website needs and budget. For example, Fortune Recommends ranked SiteGround to be the best web host for all-around performance, HostGator best for those building a new website, DreamHost for those who want a user-friendly host with helpful support, and Namecheap best for those on a tight budget given its industry-low prices.\n\nWhat is shared web hosting?\n\nShared hosting is a type of web hosting where numerous sites share server resources, such as bandwidth, CPU, and RAM. Since resources are shared—rather than dedicated—it is typically the most affordable type of web hosting.\n\nHow does web hosting work?\n\nIn a nutshell, web hosting is a service that provides storage space for your website’s files, media, and code. These servers connect to the internet, enabling a site to be accessible to the public on the web.\n\nWhat is a CDN in web hosting?\n\nA CDN is a network of servers that are all interconnected. The purpose of a CDN is to help increase a website’s performance as it results in faster webpage loading for data-heavy sites and applications."
