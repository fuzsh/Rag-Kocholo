        "text": "Hostinger Review 2022 – The Best Shared Web Hosting? See how it compares.\n\nHostinger is one of the most popular web hosting and domain registrar companies today. Established in 2004 in Lithuania as “Hosting Media”, rebranded itself in 2011 as the name we are familiar with now – Hostinger. They are known for their exceptionally low prices compared to the industry – But how does it actually perform in terms of speed, user experience, features & pricing, and how does it compare to its peers such as SiteGround, BlueHost, GoDaddy & Hostgator.\n\nThat’s what we will be taking a look at in this review. Oh, and we’ll also discuss how they are able to offer such competitive pricing compared to their competitors. So by the end of it, hopefully you can see whether or not it’s for you or not for you.\n\n9 Reasons Why You Should Choose Hostinger\n\n1. Multiple Data Center Locations\n\nHostingers offers 7+ data centers around the world.\n\nEurope (the Netherlands, Lithuania, the United Kingdom)\n\nAsia (Singapore, India)\n\nNorth America (the USA)\n\nSouth America (Brazil)\n\nThis is important because it allows you to select a data center closest to your audience, which results in faster page load times since the distance for the data to travel is less.\n\nAnd your page load times, will affect the user experience aswell as your Google rankings!\n\nThe best thing about it is that you can change it within your Hpanel (Hostinger’s) dashboard, without the need to ask support staff.\n\nOn Hostinger, changing your Datacenter is also FREE, once every 30 days!\n\nNot all hosting providers will let you select it yourself, you may need to contact them which sometimes is a bit annoying.\n\nNotes\n\nGoDaddy & SiteGround, charges an extra $20+ for a migration to a different server.\n\nBluehost & Hostgator only have data centers in the US, unless you purchase from their foreign subsidiaries.\n\n2. Exceptional Performance AMONG Competitors\n\nI was initially surprised at the speeds when I tested Hostinger, because of their low prices starting at $1.99/mo. But they were the fastest among some of the biggest shared hosting companies (GoDaddy, SiteGround, BlueHost, Hostgator etc) which actually cost more.\n\nFor this test, I signed up for 3 plans on Hostinger (Single, Premium, and Business shared), and plans of similar monthly price on GoDaddy, Bluehost, SiteGround & HostGator.\n\nAfter that, I installed WordPress on it and installed the same Astra starter website template (tech startup) for all the sites.\n\nNext, we tested the speed on Pingdom against 7 different locations 3-4 times and then recorded the average times.\n\nHosting CompanyAverage Speed (7 Locations)Plan TestedMonthly Pricing (Discount Period) Hostinger (Single)2.08 secsSingle Shared$1.99/mo Hostinger (Premium)1.1 secsPremium Shared$2.99/mo Hostinger (Business)1.06 secsBusiness Shared$3.99/mo Bluehost1.87 secsChoicePlus$5.45/mo SiteGround1.31 secsGrowBig$4.99/mo GoDaddy2.59 secsDeluxe$7.99/mo HostGator2.04 secsHatchling$3.95/mo\n\nLocations tested:\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nFrankfurt, Germany\n\nLondon, UK\n\nWashington DC, US\n\nSan Fransisco, US\n\nSau Paulo, Brazil\n\nThe reason we tested it against 7 different locations, is because the data centers for each of the hosting companies are in different places. So the data would be way off, if we just tested it at just one location (like many other reviewers do).\n\nAnd we also tested it 3-4 times because sometimes during the day it may be different and the 1st time will likely be the non-cached version.\n\nSo as you can see Hostinger premium and business shared were the fastest, 1.10 secs and 1.06 secs respectively.\n\nHostinger uses Litespeed web server technology, which consistently ranks as one of the fastest and most reliable web servers. It outperforms old technology such as Apache, which GoDaddy still uses.\n\n3. Strong Load Test Results\n\nThe next test I performed was a load test on K6. This basically tests to see how many visitors a site can handle simultaneously.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nOn the pricing page – hosting companies normally show the estimated amount of visitors your website can handle per month (in total) before needing to upgrade your plan/resources.\n\nBut what they don’t really mention is – how well does your website perform when there a few visitors browsing your website at the same time.\n\nSort of like – how well does your computer perform, when you have a few programs open, and dozens of tabs open on your browser.\n\nSome cheaper computers with less RAM, CPU cores will start to become laggy when you have a few programs open and exporting your edited videos will be slow!\n\nHowever, high-end computers with plenty of ram and CPU cores will perform well even with dozens of tabs open, photoshop open and you’re also able to watch a movie without an issue at all.\n\nIt’s kind of important right?\n\nSo I did some basic tests, not full comprehensive (like doing multi-page browsing) simulation but we sent 50 virtual visitors to the their homepage to give us a general idea.\n\nAnd here are the results:\n\nHostinger (Business) – 50 Virtual Users\n\nThe standard deviation was 18ms, 95% of times loaded 133ms or under, and a max of 434ms.\n\nGreat Performance. Very stable and max didn’t spike too high.\n\nHostinger (Premium) – 50 Virtual Users\n\nThe standard deviation was 121ms, 95% of times loaded 273ms, and a max of 952ms.\n\nGood performance, but with some spikes.\n\nHostinger (Single) – 50 Virtual Users\n\nThe standard deviation was 649ms, 95% of times loaded in 2007ms, and a max of 3201ms.\n\nAs you can see here, there is much more variation here on the Hostinger single plan. So it’s not as good – if you have a website that gets alot of traffic, it will be slow.\n\nWith 20 virtual users (below) it performed better with a large spike. Overall, I probably wouldn’t select this server if I was building anything more than a small portfolio website or maybe creating a small website for friends etc.\n\nSiteGround (Grow Big) – 50 Virtual Users\n\nThe standard deviation was 39ms, 95% of times loaded in 275ms, and a max of 886ms.\n\nGood performance. Fairly stable with a few bumps.\n\nBluehost (ChoicePlus) – 50 Virtual Users\n\nThe standard deviation was 33ms, 95% of times loaded in 98ms, and a max of 2245ms.\n\nGood performance. A little bit high for the max though.\n\nGoDaddy (Deluxe) – 50 Virtual Users\n\nAs you can see, in this test – there were HTTP failures which basically meant the page took too long to load and crashed. So it’s safe to say the GoDaddy Deluxe plan couldn’t handle 50 users simultaneously. However, we did another test for 20 virtual users and it did just fine.\n\nHostgator Hatchling – 50 Virtual Users\n\nThe standard deviation was 74ms, 95% of times loaded under 551 ms and a max of 1824ms.\n\nAverage performance.\n\nSummary & Thoughts\n\nHostinger Business performed the best in this load test. SiteGround (GrowBig) and Bluehost (ChoicePlus) did pretty well too. Really stable response times with 50 users on the site and max wasn’t too far off.\n\nAll others were okay, except for GoDaddy Deluxe and Hostinger (Single) which couldn’t handle 50 users on the site. However, they are okay with 20 users.\n\n4. Lowest Pricing & Decent Renewals\n\nAs you probably know already, Hostinger offers some of the lowest pricing for their shared hosting plans starting from around $1.99/mo for the single shared plans.\n\nIf we compare them side by side with their top competitors. They beat them. So, let’s take a closer look.\n\nHostinger\n\nSiteGround\n\nIf we compare SiteGrounds GrowBig Plan $4.99/mo to Hostingers Business Plan $3.99/mo – they both offer pretty much the same thing. But Hostinger is cheaper and renewals are much much lower.\n\nSiteGrounds GrowBig plan renews at 24.99/mo (12 month term) where as Hostingers Business Plan renews at $11.99/mo (12 month term). More than half the price!\n\nThere are also different rates for 24, 36, 48 months renewals.\n\nSiteGround 24 month renewal is $19.99/mo and for 36 month is $17.49/mo (but you need to pay that amount upfront, or roughly $629.64).\n\nHostinger’s 24 month renewal is $9.99/mo and 48 month is $8.99/mo.\n\nIn terms of price vs value, Hostinger definitely wins by a long shot against SiteGround.\n\nBlueHost\n\nIf we compare BlueHost’s ChoicePlus Plan $5.45/mo to Hostingers Business Plan $3.99/mo – again you will noticed it’s a better deal.\n\nThe only caveat, is that we would assume 100 sites on Hostingers is sort of “unlimited” anyways. Cause if you had more, you’d likely be over their storage and other limits anyways.\n\nHostGator\n\nHostgators pricing is a bit more comparable. HostGators Baby Plan is $3.50/mo (36 months) or 5.00/mo (12 months) and Hostingers Business Plan is $3.99/mo (12months).\n\nBut you do miss out on some cool features on Hostingers business plan such as the WordPress staging tool, CDN, free daily backups etc.\n\nGoDaddy\n\nSame when it comes to GoDaddy, their prices are quite high for what you actually get.\n\nSummary & Thoughts\n\nOverall, from a pricing point of view Hostinger is the definitely the winner here. And to be honest, they are probably keeping a very close eye on their competitors pricing so that it remains that way.\n\nNote: when purchasing hosting, always look at the renewal prices. Most hosting companies will offer a massive discount on their first term – as it incentivizes sign-ups. Some companies renew at a much higher rate (x5), while some not as high (x3).\n\n5. Awesome Documentation & Tutorials\n\nMost reviews don’t mention this, but I actually find this to be really important. Because sometimes you will need to learn how to do something or connect it with a different app etc. Hostinger has a solid, easy-to-find, easy-to-follow, step-by-step guides to literally do everything that you would need.\n\nIt makes your life a lot easier and so you don’t need to contact support. Not all hosting providers have great documentation. Some are hard to find, not up to date, not easy to follow, or just not there.\n\nYou can check out the Hostinger help center and written tutorials.\n\n6. Easy to Use & Intuitive hPanel Dashboard\n\nOnce you sign up and pay for your hosting. You will be re-directed to purchase your domain name (or claim your free one) or connect an existing one.\n\nAfter that you will be able to follow the prompts easily to install WordPress or to start blank.\n\nEverything is very simple and seamless.\n\nThen you will be on the page, where you can activate your SSL certificate, create an email for your domain, and activate your CDN in a few clicks.\n\nI’ve tried others and this is by far one of the easiest and best dashboard experiences.\n\nOlder legacy companies such as GoDaddy, Hostgator & BlueHost use Cpanel and I feel its disconnected. As on the outside when you purchase the hosting and domain – you have one look, normally quite modern and nice but then Cpanel looks completely different. So it can be confusing for beginners.\n\nGoDaddy Homepage\n\nGoDaddy Cpanel (Manage Website)\n\nHowever, SiteGround does have its own Sitetools which they custom-built. It’s a rich, premium-feel user experience. But still, not as simple to use as hPanel, in my opinion.\n\n7. Innovative Website Boost Option (New)\n\nPersonally, I never thought of something like this. I knew cars had a sport mode that gave you some instant power. But having this option available inside a hosting dashboard?\n\nNever did I think of it. But Hostinger has it, and they don’t even advertise it!\n\nInside your dashboard, when you select your website and on the left side panel – you are able to boost your web hosting plan once per month for free.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nYou are able to increase your resources for free to the next tiered plan. For example, if you have the single shared plan you can boost your website to the business shared plan for 24 hours.\n\nThis is great if you want to try out a higher-tier plan without any commitment or perhaps you expect a bit of a traffic spike for that day. You can even use it if you are planning to import large amounts of data since it will be faster.\n\nNevertheless, it’s an innovative, awesome feature that I haven’t seen it in the other big 4 hosting companies.\n\n8. Best Chat Support System\n\nIf we are not talking about the actual response times (which is actually one of the negatives of Hostinger) – but in terms of the chat support system, I like it a lot. The reason is, that it includes a person’s face, it doesn’t lag, it opens up in the same window, don’t need to login again and easily access it again if you close the window.\n\nYou may think it’s standard across all hosting companies, but it’s not. Hostingers chat system interface is really one of the best in the industry.\n\nI’ve tried Hostgators, GoDaddys and Bluehost and you are redirected to another window, you have to login again and confirm your details. It’s just not as fluent, UI doesn’t look great. The system also lags slightly and overall is not as enjoyable as Hostingers to use.\n\nSiteGrounds interface and system is better, but you have to navigate a bit more to find how to get in touch with their live chat support. Which is a little bit annoying, but is understandable. As hosting companies get big – it becomes a tough balance of support, speed, features and still remaining profitable.\n\n9. Free Whois domain privacy\n\nThis used to be paid feature cost around $5-6 per domain. Now Hostinger, has added this option for FREE!\n\nFor those of you who don’t know what this feature is – Basically it hides your personal information such as your name, email, and contact number from public view.\n\nSo if you wanted to learn who owns a specific domain name, you can visit a website like https://who.is – and search for a domain and it will show it.\n\nHaving domain privacy protection is generally recommended and it’s to prevent companies from spamming your inbox or calling you about SEO offers or any business offers (cause they know you’ve started a business).\n\nOther hosting companies normally charge for this – at around $15/per domain. So it’s a great benefit to have.\n\nHow to Enable Domain Privacy in Hostinger\n\nStep 1: Go to the Domains Tab in Hostinger.\n\nStep 2: Selec your domain\n\nStep 3: Scroll down and Enable “WHOIS Privacy”\n\n4 Reasons Why Shouldn’t You Choose Hostinger?\n\n1. Slow or Sometimes Unavailable Chat Support\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong.\n\nTheir actual chat support and documentation are great, but getting a hold of a person to chat to can take up to 30 mins or is even sometimes just limited to email support (recently it’s been better.)\n\nI think this is one of the ways that they are able to offer such affordable pricing, speed, and all those features.\n\nSo what else should you know?\n\nThis isn’t something really advertised either (it used to be), but Hostinger actually has the option to purchase priority chat support for around $2/mo which basically takes the average response time from 20-30 minutes to just a few minutes.\n\nHow about other hosting companies?\n\nGenerally, they take a few minutes to reply. SiteGround was abit faster in terms of first response I’ve found. But again, although Hostinger may be slower – the chat UI is much better and their tonality is top notch.\n\n2. No Phone Support\n\nHostinger doesn’t provide any Phone support, so you can’t pick up the phone if you have an issue to call them.\n\nFor me personally, this isn’t a big issue. As web hosting is handled online and fixing requires you to use your computer.\n\nBut for other people, it may be important, especially – if you if have a problem and the chat support can’t seem to understand you. You may want to get someone on the phone.\n\nDo other top hosting providers offer phone support?\n\nGoDaddy – Yes\n\nBlueHost – Yes\n\nHostGator – Yes\n\nSiteGround – No, just live chat support.\n\n3. No Daily Backups (for Single & Premium Shared)\n\nFor the single and premium shared plans, they don’t offer a daily backup for your sites. Only a weekly backup option. For business plan & cloud plans, you do get the daily backups.\n\nI think, this also makes alot of sense too – since backing up sites does take more resources on the server. And in a lot of cases, for small beginner websites – people don’t update their websites on a daily basis.\n\nTherefore, it keeps the monthly pricing of hosting low and if you do need it – you can purchase it as an addon for $2.15/mo. But I’d probably just get the business shared plan if daily backups are important to you.\n\nI think if you don’t update your website too often, weekly backups are sufficient. But if you are a blog/news website and you make changes everyday – then daily back ups are probably best.\n\nRecommended: You can also use 3rd party WordPress plugins such as UpdraftPlus for FREE backups into your Google Drive or other locations.\n\n4. A lot of Plugins Pre-Installed\n\nWhen you install WordPress on Hostinger, and login to the dashboard area – you will notice alot of plugins pre-installed and it makes it really cluttered.\n\nProbably more annoying than anything, and not much of a reason to avoid them since you can deactivate and delete it within a few clicks.\n\nSo this another way, they are able to offer such amazing prices – as they have partnered up with these plugin companies.\n\nMy Recommendations\n\nOverall, I rate Hostinger at a solid 4.7 score and can HIGHLY recommend them for most people.\n\nIt is my best choice of affordable shared hosting among top competitors such as SiteGround, GoDaddy, BlueHost and Hostgator from what I’ve tested.\n\nPerfect for individuals who are small to medium sized businesses. You can build anything from a WordPress blog, business website, ecommerce store to a learning management website etc.\n\nWho is it NOT for?\n\nThe Hostinger shared hosting plans aren’t recommended for high traffic websites, enterprise level businesses or if you are a professional web agency.\n\nIf you do need more performance you can also take a look at Hostinger Cloud, it’s essentially the next step up and it’s super fast which maintaining the simplicity of Hostingers dashboard and user experience. You should also checkout the alternatives below if you are looking for something different. Each have their pros and cons.\n\nHostinger Alternatives\n\n1. SiteGround (Starts at $3.99/mo) – “Premium Version of Hostinger”\n\nProbably my next pick after Hostinger. SiteGround is very similar in terms of speed & performance, however they provide everything you need in their plans. You don’t need to purchase anything extra such as $2/mo for daily backups.\n\nThey have their own dashboard called “Site Tools” and everything about them feels like a premium German luxury vehicle. For example, when you install WordPress – you don’t get any pre-installed plugins that clutter up your dashboard and the design is unique to them.\n\nThe biggest con, is that their renewal prices are high (at x5) and other things are a bit expensive such as purchasing a domain from them or switching to a different server etc. And they may not be available for all countries. e.g. India. (In 2020, they made this change)\n\n2. Cloudways (Starts around $10/mo) – “Powerful Cloud Hosting for High Traffic Sites/Web Agencies”\n\nCloudways is a managed cloud hosting platform which connects us to cloud infrastructures such as Digital Ocean, Vultr, Linode, AWS & Google. They offer high performance cloud hosting on a easy to use and manage platform that we are probably more familiar with – instead of using command lines if we were to go directly to these cloud infrastructures.\n\nThis is ideal for high traffic websites such as ecommerce stores and perfect for web agencies.\n\nNot ideal for people building their very first website as the setup is a little different, although not hard but there is a few extra steps. I do have full video tutorial on how it works, and how to set it up too.\n\nYou can use HOGAN for 20% off for the first 3 months!\n\n3. WPX Hosting (Starts at around $20.83/mo) – “Ideal for Established WordPress Bloggers/Business Websites”\n\nWPX is a very simplified and powerful shared hosting service (actually one of the fastest). They only offer 3 plans, have a very simple but usable dashboard. All the essential features included such as backups, emails, malware removal etc. They also have the fastest chat response times averaging around 30 seconds for the first response.\n\nRecommended for people who have an established WordPress blog or website – and you are willing to pay a premium for ultra-fast chat response times and fast load speeds.\n\nWPX Coupon: Use HOGAN50 for an extra discount!\n\nHow to get started with Hostinger\n\nStep 1: Go to Hostinger\n\nStep 2: Select “Hosting > Web Hosting” on the top navigation menu.\n\nWhich plan should you choose?\n\nHostinger Single Plan – You can only host ONE website on this plan. Only recommended if you are creating a simple and small portfolio website, resume website or if you are just testing out things and you want to most budget friendly option. In terms of performance it’s not great, so don’t create an ecommerce website on it. And on this plan, you have to choose the 48 month option in order to get the biggest discount at $1.99/mo. Or else, for 12 months and 24 months it’s $2.99/mo and $2.49/mo respectively. So it’s actually similar to the premium plan!\n\nHostinger Premium Plan – Recommended for most people starting. Can host up to 100 websites. You also get a free domain included for the first year. Decent performance. And an pricing is $2.99/mo for 12, 24 or 48 months. The only downside would be no daily backups. So if you need that, it would be a better option to get the business plan from the get go, rather than adding it on later for $2/mo.\n\nHostinger Business Plan – Recommended for eCommerce startups and sites that require more resources or you just want the best. Can also host up to 100 websites. Increased performance. You get a free domain, daily back ups, and also WordPress staging. Pricing is also $3.99 for 12, 24, 48 months. The only difference would be the cheaper renewals if you go for the longer terms.\n\nStep 3: Select your term. Choose 12 months or longer as the monthly deal isn’t going to give you the best price. Normally the longer you go for, the cheaper the renewal pricing will be.\n\nStep 4: Enter in the Coupon code: HOGANCHUA to save an extra 10%.\n\nStep 5: Enter in your details and make payment.\n\nAfter that, you can follow my video tutorial below which shows you exactly step by step how to create your WordPress website, blog, or eCommerce store using Hostinger.\n\nHogan Chua\n\nWhat's up guys :) Currently, in Melbourne Australia.
