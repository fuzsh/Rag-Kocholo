        "text": "SiteGround is a web hosting company founded in 2004 by a few university friends. In most recent data, it reports servicing more than 1,800,000 domains worldwide. It provides shared hosting, cloud hosting and dedicated servers as well as email hosting and domain registration.\n\nAs several users experience speed problems using SobiPro on their servers we asked Siteground to test SobiPro on their servers.\n\nDaniel Kanchev, Senior Technical Support Engineer at Siteground and known as a Joomla! performance specialist, tested SobiPro versions 1.0 and 1.1 with a database of 100.000 SobiPro entries.\n\nHis conclusion: \"The new version of SobiPro is great and it works much faster. We can host small-medium SobiPro sites on our servers without any issues. We can also create custom VPS solutions for big SobiPro sites.\"\n\nJoomla! and SobiPro run much faster when hosted by Siteground. They achieve this amazing speed increase thanks to a special server architecture, multiple server locations, and their unique Joomla! caching mechanism.\n\nVideo: Create a Business Directory with Joomla! and SobiPro on Siteground\n\nRochen Limited, also known as Rochen, was founded in July 2000 by Chris Adams. They currently have teams operating in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\n\nRochen is a company that provides shared hosting and dedicated server solutions for websites of all varieties. Most notably, Rochen's hosting solutions are optimized for websites built with popular Open Source software such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, as well as an extensive list of other applications.\n\nRochen is a strong supporter of the open source community, backing projects including the Joomla content management system (CMS). Rochen is the web hosting partner for the official Joomla! website."
