        "text": "SiteGround were founded in 2004, and the Bulgarian based web host has exploded on to the scene. The company currently manages over 2 million domain names across multiple territories.\n\nSiteGround have not gone down the path of bolting on a ton of supplementary products like Office 365 or marketing services, focusing their efforts on providing hosting technology and platforms to power your websites.\n\nTheir web hosting services include:\n\nShared hosting\n\nManaged WordPress hosting\n\nManaged cloud hosting\n\nReseller hosting\n\nDomain names\n\nSiteGround’s datacenter locations are across three continent, with servers in London, Chicago, Singapore, and Amsterdam.\n\nTheir network is further supported by Cloudflare’s CDN (content delivery network). CDNs make up-to-date copies of your website on a regular basis and store them around the world.\n\nNew SiteGround hosting customers are hosted on Google’s Cloud servers. In SiteGround’s word, you get the following benefits…\n\nDistributed SSD persistent storage\n\nWe are using Google’s SSD persistent storage, which has multiple redundancies. In the rare occasions where the hosting server fails, we can just spin up a new virtual machine on another hosting node in our cloud space and simply attach the distributed storage volume to the new instance, instead of the faulty one, without losing time in backup restores.\n\nState-of-the-art network for faster sites\n\nGoogle is known for maintaining one of the fastest and most powerful networks, which means that using their service will result in a high speed for our clients’ websites. One can hardly think of another global network that is better connected!\n\n100% Renewable energy match\n\nOur partner matches 100% the energy consumed by their global operations with renewable energy and maintains a commitment to carbon neutrality. Google has been a leader in energy efficiency with their achievements in reducing the compute emissions by improving higher efficiency of data serving and storage and diverting waste.”\n\nIt is worth noting that SiteGround are one of the few hosting companies that haven’t been hoovered up in the great industry consolidation of the past few years.\n\nWordPress hosting\n\nSiteGround were one of the earliest pioneers of WordPress specific hosting packages, an their first-mover status shows with the breadth and depth of WordPress-based features on offer.\n\nSiteGround’s WordPress plans include:\n\nOne-Click WordPress install\n\nAutomatic WordPress updates\n\nAutomatic backups\n\nStaging environments are available with the GoGeek plan\n\nSpecific security for WordPress-related vulnerabilities\n\nSiteGround customers can use the cPanel control panel for the majority of its hosting plans. Therefore, anyone who has used cPanel before should be bale to pick it up very quickly. cPanel is the most popular web hosting control panel for good reason, so even if you haven’t used it before, you’ll find it quite easy to get started.\n\nSiteGround offers all customers a 99.99% monthly uptime guarantee. This works out at guaranteeing no more than just over 4 minutes of downtime per month and just under an hour per year.\n\nAs someone who has worked for web hosts, I can assure you downtime is a matter of when, rather than if. 99.99% is a bold promise and if they can keep it, one you should consider.\n\nMost web hosts monitor their servers in intervals of between 1 and 5 minutes, which can mean they find out about a server’s downtime through customer calls or social media!\n\nSiteGround performs real-time tracking. The upside being server problems are detected the instant they occur and can be fixed much faster.\n\nAll SiteGround plans offer free backups and restoration to an earlier version of your website. This includes automatic daily system backups and 30 automatic daily backup copies.\n\nFor additional peace of mind, if you are using a GrowBig plan or higher , you can choose to create an “on-demand” backup at any time.\n\nShared hosting\n\nTheir entry-level startup shared hosting plan comes with\n\n10 GB of storage\n\nUnlimited emails\n\nSpace for a single website\n\nUp to 10,000 visitors a month\n\nOther hosting packages above the Startup Plan come with better features including more storage (with dedicated web hosting packages 2TB disk space being the highest), unlimited websites, a higher allowance of monthly visits, free daily backups and restores, and SSL certificate for security.\n\nWhat about ‘unlimited hosting’? Many hosting companies offer “unlimited” web space and bandwidth. What it really means is that the host does not monitor your resource usage, but will step in and disable your website if your it causes a drag on other websites hosted on the same server.\n\nThe most expensive plan is the GoGeek plan at £8.95 per month (first year only, £24 per month thereafter), that does come with some super-useful features:\n\nUnlimited webstes\n\nUp to 100,000 visitors per month\n\n30GB web space\n\nStaging and Git\n\nPriority support\n\nWhite-label clients\n\nHowever, at £24 per month, this does start to be come difficult to justify.\n\nAdditionally, SiteGround domain names are very expensive, with a .uk domain costing £15 per year. You’ll find that significantly cheaper pretty much every where else.\n\nManaged cloud hosting\n\nSiteGround’s Cloud Hosting products are essentially managed VPS, the same as 123-reg’s ‘Premium Hosting’ and Heart Interet’s ‘Managed VPS’.\n\nCloud Hosting is an attempt to bridge the simplicity of shared web hosting and the more powerful, but more technically difficult VPS (Virtual Private Servers). SiteGround is responsible for maintaining the server, providing you with access to a control panel to manage your hosting and website.\n\nA couple of key reasons why you should consider using Cloud Hosting include:\n\nFewer websites sharing your server resources (faster page loads)\n\nLoad balancing (with a 99.99% uptime guarantee)\n\nDedicated IP address\n\nDirect SSH access to your cloud account\n\nPrivate DNS\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nWordPress auto-updates\n\nOrdering with SiteGround\n\nSiteGround’s order process is simple and easy to follow, almost stark in comparison to the likes of 123-reg. There are next to no attempts to up-sell or cross-sell me.\n\n£14.95 (excluding VAT!) for a .uk domain is far too high. In fact, I would expect a modern hosting company to bundle at least one domain name free with my hosting.\n\nSiteGround let you choose from their data centre locations around the world at the ordering stage.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that SiteGround prices do not include VAT. I assume they get away with this because they claim to specifically target business customers, so they do not have to include it.\n\nSo, if you’re not a business customer, what ever price you see advertised is going to cost you 20% more at the till.\n\nSiteGround customer service\n\nSiteGround have clearly invested a lot of money in their support teams, providing multiple channels to contact them 2×7. You can get hold of them by phone, live chat or tickets.\n\nSiteGround claim they successfully resolve 90%+ of the live chat inquiries they get and the average wait time on the phone is only 2 minutes.\n\nMy personal preference for technical support is through a ticket system, and SiteGround advertise they reply within 15 minutes on average.\n\nWith those stats, you can feel confident SiteGround will be able to help you when you need them. They also offer an extensive knowledge base for those who want to self-help.\n\nMoney back guarantee\n\nSiteGround offers a 30-day money-back guarantee for its hosting products. Domain names, admin fees, and some add-ons are non-refundable.\n\nSiteGround uptime and reliability\n\nFor every 1% uptime below 99%, they will provide you with an extra month of service free. It is worth noting that this is quite a lot of downtime for a host, so a month’s free hosting is reasonable.\n\nThat said, very few web hosts commit themselves to any for level of compensation for downtime.\n\nVisit SiteGround"
