Some of the links on our site are from our partners who compensate us. Read our editorial guidelines and advertising disclosure.\n\nBottom line: SiteGround is great for its straightforward, easily understood plan choices that are excellent for beginners. However, the company struggles with its loading times, bandwidth limits, and expensive pricing that constantly fluctuates throughout the year, all of which are factors that make it difficult to subscribe long-term.\n\nIf you have more time: Finding a hosting provider for your business website might sound like a boring task, but it’s not a decision you should take lightly. That’s because when it comes to web hosting, you’re deciding on so much more than just another vendor: you’re choosing the foundation on which your business website is built.\n\nWith that in mind, it’s also important to understand that not all web hosting providers are created equally. Each comes with its own unique combination of pros and cons.\n\nWhen it comes to cost and performance, SiteGround shines. Its customer service is less dazzling. But if your highest priority is getting the most bang for your buck—especially if you have a straightforward website—SiteGround could be the right choice for your business site.\n\nCompare SiteGround web hosting plans in 2023\n\nData effective 12/15/2022. At publishing time, pricing and features are current but are subject to change. Offers may not be available in all areas.\n\nWhat is SiteGround?\n\nFounded in 2004, SiteGround has become one of the world’s largest website hosting companies. Currently trusted by the owners of more than two million domains worldwide, SiteGround provides multiple types of website hosting as well as domain name registration and email hosting.\n\nExpert Advice, Straight to Your Inbox\n\nGain confidence in your business future with our weekly simple solutions newsletter.\n\nBy signing up I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nShared hosting, managed WordPress, and managed WooCommerce hosting packages from SiteGround\n\nStrengths\n\nMost affordable website hosting packages\n\nLive customer support available 24/7/365\n\nUltra-fast servers\n\nTop-notch security powered by Let’s Encrypt\n\nEasy website management\n\nFree, automated daily backups for your website\n\n99.99% uptime guaranteed (annually)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nServer resources shared with other customers\n\nInsufficient resources for high-traffic websites\n\nCertain features not available for the lower-tiered (StartUp and GrowBig) plans\n\nFor newer businesses, or for existing businesses that receive less than 100,000 visits per month, the shared hosting and managed WordPress hosting plans are the most affordable way to host your website on SiteGround.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the differences between SiteGround’s managed WordPress and shared hosting packages to help you determine which plan is right for you.\n\nThe biggest difference is that SiteGround’s managed WordPress hosting accounts are—you guessed it—optimized for hosting WordPress websites. But shared hosting accounts will support any type of website you’ve created.\n\nSo what makes SiteGround’s WordPress plans a great option? For starters, SiteGround uses its own proprietary WordPress caching system called the SuperCacher. It’s also developed a custom WordPress plugin that’s automatically installed on all of its managed WordPress hosting plans. Together, these SuperCacher tools help speed up your website by caching results from your database as well as caching dynamic data.\n\nAnother perk to SiteGround’s WordPress plans is the one-click WordPress staging tool. This feature allows you to create a copy of your production environment (live website) in a single click. This means you can test new code, implement new features, or modify the design of your website in a separate environment that’s not available for anyone else to see.\n\nThen, once you’re happy with the changes you’ve made, you can commit (push) those changes back to your live website with just one click. We should note that SiteGround automatically makes a backup of your live site before moving any of your changes over from the staging environment. So if there’s ever a case where you need to undo your changes, you can do so with just one click as well.\n\nSiteGround shared hosting plans\n\nPlansStartUpGrowBigGoGeekPrice\n\n$2.99/mo.\n\n$4.99/mo.\n\n$7.99/mo.\n\nDisk space\n\n10 GB\n\n20 GB\n\n40 GB\n\nBandwidth (monthly visits)\n\n~10K\n\n~100K\n\n~400K\n\nStaging environmentPriority supportView PlanView PlanView Plan\n\nData effective 12/15/2022.

Offers may not be available in all areas.\n\nStartUp vs. GrowBig vs. GoGeek plans\n\nSiteGround’s shared hosting and managed WordPress hosting plans include three tiers: StartUp, GrowBig, and GoGeek. Let’s break down the three most important differences between these hosting plans:\n\nFree website transfers\n\nFor their GrowBig and GoGeek hosting plans, SiteGround provides one free professional website migration (or transfer) for your existing website from your current hosting provider. Professional website migrations are still available on the StartUp plans, but it’ll cost you extra.\n\nAdvanced priority support\n\nIf you need tech support, you can reach out to SiteGround via live chat or the service's web-based ticket system. But folks with the GoGeek hosting plans will get the highest priority with the most experienced support agents available. Think of it like FASTPASS at Disneyland but for when you urgently need tech support.\n\nPCI-compliant servers\n\nIf you’re processing online payments, you have to meet the Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards. SiteGround maintains basic PCI compliance standards for all of its GoGeek servers. So you’re covered if your website doesn’t process or store credit card transactions itself but uses a third-party professional service (such as Stripe or PayPal) instead.\n\nFully managed cloud hosting packages from SiteGround\n\nStrengths\n\nUnmatched resource efficiency and site speed\n\nAuto-scalable resources without rebooting\n\nPriority support available 24/7 with no waiting\n\nFully managed infrastructure and server software\n\n7x offsite data backups with no data loss guaranteed\n\n4x datacenters & free CDN for increased speed\n\n99.99% uptime guaranteed (annually)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSignificantly more expensive prices than shared hosting\n\nFinite SSD space & monthly data transfers\n\nInitial setup that may require help from a developer\n\nFor larger businesses, or for websites that need to maintain peak performance at all times, take a look at SiteGround’s cloud hosting or dedicated hosting.\n\nThe biggest benefit of SiteGround’s cloud hosting packages is that the resources you purchase are dedicated exclusively toward your website. This means you won’t be sharing any of your server’s processing power, memory, storage, or monthly data transfer with any other SiteGround customers. That ensures optimal performance for your website at all times.\n\nOn top of these dedicated resources, SiteGround has also developed an auto-scaling feature for its cloud hosting plans. That means you can automatically add any additional server resources without rebooting. Think of this as on-demand resources that can be automatically adjusted by your server, on the fly, to ensure your website is available 24/7. This is a great way to future-proof your website against traffic spikes. Even better, you’ll only be required to pay for these additional resources on an as-needed basis.\n\nFully managed cloud hosting packages\n\nPlansEntryBusinessBusiness PlusSuper PowerPrice\n\n$100.00/mo.\n\n$200.00/mo.\n\n$300.00/mo.\n\n$400.00/mo.\n\nStorage space\n\n40 GB\n\n80 GB\n\n120 GB\n\n160 GB\n\nMemory (RAM)\n\n8 GB\n\n12 GB\n\n16 GB\n\n20 GB\n\nCPU (processor)\n\n4 cores\n\n8 cores\n\n12 cores\n\n16 cores\n\nData transfer\n\n5 TB\n\n5 TB\n\n5 TB\n\n5 TB\n\nView PlanView PlanView PlanView Plan\n\nData effective 12/15/2022. At publishing time, pricing and features are current but are subject to change. Offers may not be available in all areas.\n\nStandout features\n\nThe standout features on the cloud hosting plans are a bit more technical than their shared hosting counterparts. Here are the features that really make cloud hosting plans shine:\n\nFully managed infrastructure and server software\n\nSiteGround configures and manages all of the infrastructure and server software for cloud hosting customers. That means SiteGround’s system administrators are there 24/7 to keep your server up and running. And that allows you to stay focused on what you do best: running your business.\n\n7x daily offsite data backups\n\nSiteGround automatically keeps seven offsite backups of your entire cloud hosting account from seven consecutive days. Keeping your multiple backups offsite means that SiteGround can guarantee none of your company’s data will ever be lost.\n\nFree CDN\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) refers to a group of globally distributed servers that work together to deliver internet content (such as HTML, style sheets, JavaScript files, images, and videos) to each user as quickly as possible. Sound like another term for web hosting? Not quite. SiteGround works with its CDN to boost your site’s performance (load time) and security. Think of it as another awesome gadget in SiteGround’s hosting tool kit.\n\n99.99% uptime guarantee\n\nUptime guarantees are one of the most critical metrics to pay attention to when selecting a hosting provider for your website. Luckily, SiteGround provides an industry-leading 99.99% uptime guarantee. You’ll notice many other hosting providers advertise a 99.9% uptime guarantee annually, so we translated these guarantees into real daily, weekly, monthly, and annual downtime stats for you.\n\nUptime\n\nDaily downtime\n\nWeekly downtime\n\nMonthly downtime\n\nAnnual downtime\n\n99.9%\n\n1.48 min.\n\n10.11 min.\n\n43.8 min.\n\n8.76 hrs.\n\n99.99%\n\n8.64 sec.\n\n1.01 min.\n\n4.38 min.\n\n52.56 min.\n\nCan your online business afford an extra 8.76 hours of downtime every year? If the answer is no, SiteGround’s 99.99% uptime guarantee may seal the deal for you.\n\nSitSiteGround can offer that impressive uptime guarantee because of its security solutions. SiteGround’s web hosting security team has been building its own security solutions for more than 10 years. Standout features include secure account isolation, proactive server monitoring, custom Linux containers (LXC), and a proprietary anti-AI bot.\n\nHow does SiteGround stack up against other hosting providers?\n\nIt’s true that SiteGround provides hosting solutions for businesses of all sizes. But when it comes to the most important pain points online businesses face, how does it fare against the competition?\n\nWe’ve rated SiteGround’s web hosting packages for four of the most important metrics to business owners: overall security, uptime guarantee, loading time, and customer service.\n\nCompare SiteGround vs. competitors\n\nBrandEntry-level pricing\n\n$2.99/mo.\n\n$2.95/mo.\n\n$2.99/mo.\n\n$20.00/mo.\n\nUptime guarantee\n\n99.99%\n\n99.99%\n\n99.9%\n\n99.9%Hosting for any website\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo (WordPress only)\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\n2 cores\n\n2 cores\n\n3 cores\n\n4 cores\n\nFree CDN\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nFree domain name\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nMoney-back guarantee30 days30 days90 days60 daysUnlimited free emails\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nAutomated backups\n\nDaily\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nDaily\n\nGet StartedView PlansView PlansView PlansView Plans\n\nData effective 12/15/2022. At publishing time, pricing and features are current but are subject to change. Offers may not be available in all areas.\n\nSiteGround security and uptime guarantee: 5/5\n\nSiteGround has one of the most impressive security measures we’ve seen in website hosting. The company’s talented DevOps team has been pioneering advanced web hosting security solutions for more than a decade. Back in 2008, the team developed what is still one of today’s best security isolations for shared hosting accounts. In plain English, this means that no account on any shared server can affect the data of another account on the same server.\n\nSiteGround also implemented its own Linux Containers (LXC) technology, which is extremely efficient and stable, ensuring your site stays up and running during unexpected traffic spikes. SiteGround’s DevOps team even wrote multiple patches for the core Linux Kernal, which are now in the official code of the Linux Kernal itself. Talk about impressive.\n\nOn top of this, SiteGround employs its own proactive server monitoring. Server monitoring checks your server status and makes repairs in real time—or before the problem even impacts your server performance. SiteGround’s server monitoring is extremely lightweight, meaning it can check the servers’ statuses more frequently than standard monitoring systems allow.\n\nSiteGround’s anti-bot AI protects your site from malicious attacks by botnets. In fact, across all of its servers, SiteGround’s AI solutions actively intercept between 500,000 and 2 million of these malicious attacks every hour.1 With protection like that, you can rest easy knowing your website will stay up and running so your customers don’t miss out.\n\nWorking together, these systems allow SiteGround to securely provide a 99.99% uptime guarantee annually. That means your website won’t go offline for more than one hour across an entire calendar year. That’s more uptime than most hosting providers guarantee.\n\nSiteGround load time: 3/5\n\nWith SiteGround’s impressive technology stack, some of the fastest hardware meets the latest software. Combined with the service’s innovative network architecture, SiteGround is uniquely capable of ensuring your website loads as quickly as possible.\n\nIn our performance benchmarking tests, many of SiteGround’s servers performed very well. However, the initial metrics from SiteGround’s managed WordPress hosting package weren’t as fast as other hosting providers, such as WP Engine and Kinsta. Because of these less-than-desirable performance results, we gave SiteGround a three out of five rating.\n\nNow, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t purchase a SiteGround managed WordPress hosting account. But if loading speed is the most important hosting factor to you, then you may want to hire an expert to help optimize the performance of your WordPress website.\n\nSiteGround customer service: 4/5\n\nIt’s true: SiteGround provides customer support by both phone and live chat 24/7. However, to receive priority treatment from the support team with no hold times, you’ll need to purchase one of SiteGround’s more expensive hosting packages.\n\nIn our experience, the average time spent waiting for SiteGround customer support agents was less than five minutes. However, we found that entry-level accounts received significantly slower customer support than accounts on more expensive plans. That’s why we’ve given SiteGround’s customer service a four out of five rating.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nWhether you’re a brand-new business building your first website, an existing ecommerce business with tons of traffic, or an up-and-coming technology company who wants to host multiple websites, SiteGround has the website hosting solutions you’ve been searching for.\n\nAll of its hosting packages are highly customizable and scale effortlessly, which gives you more time to manage your business.\n\nIf you’ve been searching for an easy-to-use, budget-friendly hosting provider that values speed and security as much as you do, then you can’t go wrong with SiteGround.\n\nDoes SiteGround’s less-than-stellar customer service make you nervous?

Once you’ve logged in, you start your customer support request by filling out a short online form detailing your problem and your preferred support method (for example, by phone or by email). If you prefer support by phone, you’ll receive a local support phone number as well as a support pin to reference when calling in.\n\nCan I transfer my existing website over to SiteGround?\n\nYes, starting a new website hosting relationship with SiteGround won’t require you to create a brand-new website. However, the exact process of transferring, or migrating, an existing website over to SiteGround varies, depending on how your website was originally developed.\n\nIf your website was developed on a content management system (CMS) such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal, then SiteGround’s knowledge base offers step-by-step directions to successfully transfer your website from your old hosting provider into your new SiteGround account.\n\nPro tip\n\nSiteGround also offers free website transfers for certain hosting packages.
