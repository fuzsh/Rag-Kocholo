        "text": "Having hosted our website on the SiteGround GoGeek Plan for more than a year, we are ready for our honest SiteGround GoGeek Review. If you have been shopping around for WordPress Web Hosting Plans, you probably would have heard about SiteGround.\n\n*Update: SG Optimizer Plugin*\n\nThe latest update of Siteground’s proprietary SG Optimizer Plugin is really quite awesome.We used to run the SG Optimizer along with an array of other Caching Plugins to Speed up WordPress.

If you are planning on moving an existing site, Siteground offers free professional website migration.\n\nDo note that the SuperCacher is not available to StartUp plan.\n\nGrab the sweet 60% Off on Shared Hosting!\n\nFast Hosting with low TTFB\n\nWebsite loading speed is now one of factors that determines the search ranking of a website. Especially with a new website or blog, the speed that the website loads is crucial. A research from Moz concludes that “Time to first byte” or TTFB directly correlates to search engine rankings.\n\nSiteground GoGeek Plan (TTFB test)\n\nSo how does Siteground perform? We are currently on the Siteground GoGeek Plan, which is a Semi Dedicated Hosting plan with more resources. Lets take a look at our test TTFB scores on a test domain that is running on the default WordPress installation and the Twenty Seventeen Theme.\n\nResult: 252.36ms TTFB. That’s quite a good / decent result. Now lets run the SiteGround SuperCacher services that comes with the GrowBig and GoGeek plans.\n\nLets run the test again.\n\nWow 53.06ms. Let’s optimize it a little more and see how fast it can go.\n\nAfter enabling the free Cloudflare cdn and removing query strings from Javascript, we get an awesome 22.02ms.\n\nHeres a screen shot of the TTFB from wpjunction.net to see the actual TTFB of a full website with content and all. 40.26ms.\n\nExtremely fast. However, please do note that network latency increases your TTFB the further you are from the data center. You should choose a data center that is geographically close to your target audience.\n\nSiteground Server Locations\n\nFortunately, Siteground allows you to choose your preferred data center when you sign up. You can choose from a North America Server based in Chicago, Europe servers in London, Amsterdam or Milan and Singapore for reach to the Asia Pacific region and Australia.\n\nRead more about the Siteground’s Speed Technology\n\nExcellent Support and Managed WordPress\n\nApart from the quick response time, Siteground also will help you with popular script extensions, plugins and templates, investigate and fix application-related issues and requests that other hosts turn down as beyond their scope.\n\nSiteground support are experts in WordPress.

But here’s what important;\n\nSiteground uses:\n\nServers that keep resources usage optimal\n\nIn-house backup system for quicker backup restores\n\nAnti bot system that blocks attacks\n\nIf an account is hacked, it does not affect other accounts on the same server\n\nSiteground understands that operating a shared hosting plan is like stacking a house of cards. A hacked account or resource hogging process may affect other customers. That’s why they have employed custom made technologies for account isolation and resource optimization. Bravo.\n\nSiteground Speed Technology\n\nSiteground makes available to its customers the latest technologies to speed up their websites. In essence, giving you the best tools for your website to succeed.\n\nSolid-state (SSD storage) drives for hosting plans.\n\nIt does not matter which hosting plan you choose, be it the cheapest ($3.95/month StartUp plan) shared hosting or a more pricey cloud hosting plan. All of Siteground’s shared and cloud hosting plans comes with SSD drive storage.\n\nSSDs provide for a 1000x increase in input/output operations as compared to regular drives. But the drawback is that currently SSD has a lower disk capacity.\n\nNevertheless, Siteground provides for 10GB - 30GB of storage for shared hosting. Which is more than sufficient for growing websites and blogs.\n\nNGINX web server\n\nNGINX, a fast and lightweight web server, is used to server to serve up static content like images, scripts and fonts. This setup effective takes the load off Apache, the main web server. Although this setup is not uncommon, it helps to deliver web pages more efficiently.\n\nHTTP/2 enabled servers\n\nHTTP/2 is the newest network protocol, which significantly speeds up loading of websites in the browser. Siteground is among the first hosts to support it on all their servers. To utilize HTTP/2 your website needs to have an SSL certificate installed (https).\n\nSiteground has made this technology available for every website on its servers with Let’s Encrypt free SSL certificates.\n\nPHP7\n\nPHP7 enables code executions run faster. Siteground is one of the first web hosts to implement PHP7 for users. And they are continually upgrading as and when new versions and technologies become available. As of writing, the latest version that’s straight out of beta (version 7.2, released 30 November 2017), is already available for customers.\n\nSG Cacher / SG Optimizer and Memcached (GrowBig / GoGeek)\n\nSpeed up your website with even further with their handcrafted in-house developed caching technology. Basically SG Cacher loads your web pages into the server memory that allows even faster access to your pages.\n\nAs for Memcached, it is a technology that caches databases queries for faster subsequent access to the page. Unlike most shared hosting providers do not have Memcached available for shared hosting plans, Siteground gives access Memcached enabled databases their shared GrowBig ($5.95/mth) and GoGeek ($11.95/mth) plans.\n\nFreebies from Siteground\n\nHere’s what you can get from Siteground with every hosting plan.\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nCloudflare CDN services has a free tier so anyone can sign up so this is not really a big deal. However, Siteground has integrated an easy setup option via cPanel so that you need only to activate it with one click.\n\nManage Cloudflare settings easily with Siteground integrated Cloudflare panel.\n\nFree Let’s Encrypt SSL Certificate\n\nNowadays, Google checks if a website is on the secured https protocol to determine its search ranking. Let’s Encrypt is a is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority that any website can utilize. However, the drawback is that the certificates expires in 3 months. And when that happens, you have to regenerate your certificate. And the process is cumbersome.\n\nSiteground addressed these problems by integrating a custom made software to renew your certificates automatically. In essence, giving you a secure SSL certificate that does not expire!\n\nSame thing, all you need to do is click “Activate”. Super convenient.\n\nFree Professional Website Migration\n\nHave and existing site and need to migrate? No worries there.
