The company has a great variety of free templates, tutorials and articles about diverse open source scripts, all supported on its servers and used by both SiteGround customers and website visitors.\n\nDuring the last year, the company has added 180 new website themes and now has one of the biggest collection of Joomla, Mambo and WordPress professional-looking templates that are free-to-download. The templates enjoy great popularity and more than a million of downloads so far.\n\nSiteGround also has an impressive number of tutorials for popular scripts such as Joomla, Mediawiki, Creloaded, Zencart, Drupal and some more recent ones as Zikula, Magento, MiaCMS etc. So far, the tutorials have served millions of visitors and have helped them manage their websites created with their preferred software.\n\nFor more tricky and specific hosting-related issues, SiteGround adds plenty of new articles weekly. There are now more than a thousand articles in the company’s Knowledge Base, that provide technicalities on how to manage the backend of a website and how to fine-tune its performance.\n\nThe company has made a thorough research among its customers about the materials they would like to see and has planned further useful additions on its website for 2009. SiteGround will work with more dedication to add new useful Video tutorials due to the great user interest.\n\n“We are very happy to see, our customers rely on us not only as their hosting provider, but also a partner that provides them with a full website solution and lots of useful materials,” says Marina Yordanova, Marketing Specialist at SiteGround. “We plan to extend our data base with even more customer-inspired and customer-generated content next year. There is a lot of work ahead, but we get inspired by our customers and we enjoy the process of creating content that leads to their satisfaction.”"
