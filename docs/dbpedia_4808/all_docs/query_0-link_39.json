Also, you can keep daily backups and retrieve them whenever you need them. Along with the hosting packages, SiteGround will provide the backup feature, so you have nothing to worry about your website credentials and safety issues.\n\nPerformance & Reliability\n\nAfter launching your website, it will start getting traffic. If the website performance is poor, the users will be unable to browse your services and it will affect your business significantly. You must make sure that the server response and page loading time of your website is faster than your competitors. As you have no control over server response time, so you have to make sure the hosting you are using offers faster server response time.\n\nLuckily, the server at SiteGround loads under 1 second when tested on Pingdom and your website is 4 times faster than the others.\n\nUptime Percentage\n\nWebsite Uptime is one of the most important factors of a web hosting service. If your website is down for any technical issues, it will have a massive impact on your business. It’s true that the web hosts have to do maintenance and upgrades in their server and features. But an average of 99.95% uptime percentage is expected from every web hosting.\n\nThankfully, SiteGround consistently maintains the uptime percentage on an average of 99.99%. The credit goes to the support team, hosting configuration and almost immediate backups when required. SiteGround uses their own crafted solutions and technology to reduce downtimes such as Linux containers, pro-active server monitoring system, account isolation technology, and anti-bot AI system.\n\nLet me share my personal experience with SiteGround. Over the first 3 months using their package, Pingdom reported monthly uptime percentage of 99.96%, 99.97%, and 100%. Got the scenario why should you choose SiteGround?\n\nBest Customer Support\n\nEvery web hosting company should be careful about relentless customer service, but the activities of SiteGround show that they have emphasized more on this part. They have an award-winning customer support team and are incredibly good at providing quick, easy and knowledgeable support to the customers.\n\nThe support system of SiteGround includes live chat, conversation over the phone and ticket-based Email support.
