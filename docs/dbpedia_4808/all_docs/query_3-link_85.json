        "text": "SiteGround was founded in 2004 in Bulgaria and has grown to a conglomerate of companies located in the United States, Spain, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom. During that time, they have grown to become one of the most respected WordPress hosting providers, with over 2 million unique domains on their platform.\n\nWhen it comes to picking the right WordPress hosting at SiteGround, you have a spectrum of options to choose from. No matter where you are in your WordPress journey, SiteGround has a plan for you. We are going to talk about each of them and see why they are recommended by Yoast, Woo and WordPress.org.\n\nWeb Hosting\n\nThe SiteGround “Web Hosting” tier is their Shared Hosting offering with 3 flavors: StartUp, GoBig and GoGeek, at rates starting at $14.99 per month. This is a good choice for people who want to start hosting their website at a good host with limited cost. The standard extras like SSL, CDN, Email and Backups are included with all plans, as well with additional features on the higher two tiers. What is interesting to note is these plans include a mini Managed WordPress offering. This allows you to get started with their WP Starter site-building wizard and get automated updates.\n\nWordPress Managed Hosting\n\nSometimes you need a little extra help and want to have a solution built from the ground up for WordPress. The SiteGround WordPress Managed Hosting solution gives you that with optimized hosting for WordPress, automatic updates and access to support engineers that know WordPress inside and out. The price is low too, starting at only $14.99 per month. The top two plans allow you to add collaborators to your accounts like designers or clients, all while keeping your passwords safe.\n\nWooCommere Managed Hosting\n\nDo you want to start an online store? You may have looked at Shopify and liked the ease of use but with Managed WooCommerce hosting at SiteGround you get a similar turnkey experience at a fraction of the cost. There is a reason why WooCommerce powers more online stores then any other platform. And at a cost starting at $14.99 per month it is the lowest-priced Managed WooCommerce offering we have reviewed.\n\nCloud Hosting\n\nDo you need more than the shared or managed plans offer? SiteGround has high end Managed Cloud Hosting offerings that give you the flexibility of a VPS but without the need to be a System Administrator yourself. You get all the WordPress extras in the lower plans but with your own mini-cloud instance.\n\nIncluded Extras\n\nSiteGround has some of the best extras that many other hosting companies charge for, below is just a sampling of what they provide.\n\nSSL – All plans come with a free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate. This gives your users peace of mind that any data they enter on your site is secure to the server. Their support can also help you install any third party paid SSL certificates you may have.\n\nEmail – Nothing is better than having an email @yourowndomain, and all SiteGround plans include unlimited email accounts.\n\nCDN – Siteground takes part of your site’s content and caches it across their Content Delivery Network so visitors will see your site much faster than if it was only located at the one data center. In addition, you can pick between four data centers so your WordPress site is hosted closest to your users.\n\nMigration – Do you have another WordPress site somewhere else? SiteGround has tools to help you migrate your site via their SiteGround Migrator WordPress Plugin. Just install on your old site and let SiteGround do the work.\n\nMoney-Back Guarantees – All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can make sure you choose the right product.\n\nWordPress Related Support – Many hosts won’t support anything that is not related to the server. This includes WordPress and the plugins in many cases. SiteGround employs experts in WordPress and will help you beyond the standard the server works answers. If you want even more expertise, the GoGeek plans include Priority WordPress Support.\n\nSecurity – All plans come with WordPress Advanced Security which is unique to SiteGround. They monitor the performance on the server level for security issues. You can also buy the SG Site Scanner for $19.80 a year to add an extra layer of peace of mind."
