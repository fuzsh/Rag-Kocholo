Thus it is a good idea to place a banner only for unregistered or awaiting verification users.\n\nIn vBulletin this can be done easily following these steps:\n\n1. Log in your vBulletin admin area (e.g. http://yourdomainname.com/forum/admincp).\n\n2. Go to Styles & Templates from the left menu. There choose Style Manager.\n\n3. Click on << >> to collapse all options.\n\n4. Then choose where you’d like your banner to be placed. In our case, it will be the header so we double-click ‘header‘.\n\n5. Then scroll to the bottom and add the following code:\n\n<if condition=”in_array($bbuserinfo[‘usergroupid’], array(1, 3))”>\n\nYour banner code goes here in HTML\n\n</if>\n\nThe above code means that if the user has groupid 1 or 3 the following code should be executed. By default 1 and 3 user group IDs belong to unregistered and awaiting-approval users."
