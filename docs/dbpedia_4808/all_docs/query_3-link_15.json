        "text": "SiteGround was founded in 2004, and now serves more than 800,000 customers and their domains. The hosting provider offers shared hosting, cloud hosting, dedicated hosting and WordPress hosting, with servers located in Chicago, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, and Milan. SiteGround is also one of three hosting providers recommended by WordPress.\n\nOne of the major benefits of hosting your site with SiteGround is its solution for monitoring and reacting to reduced website speed. When SiteGround recognizes your site is underperforming, its technology locates and fixes the bug to keep your site performing at optimum speed. Additionally, the company offers managed WordPress hosting on all plans.\n\nSiteGround’s cPanel is also jam-packed with extras for user convenience. It allows you to reference and manage quick stats on storage, inode usage, emails, monthly transfers, subdomains, parked domains, addon domains, FTP accounts and loads more.\n\nSiteGround Packages and Pricing\n\nSiteGround has a transparent pricing structure, and all hosting packages come standard with:\n\n24/7 support\n\nFree WordPress and Joomla app installs\n\nFree email accounts\n\nUnmetered traffic\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\ncPanel & SSH\n\nFree website builder\n\nSSD storage\n\n30-day money back guarantee\n\nFree daily backup\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nUnlimited MySQL DB\n\nFor all of this, you’ll pay just $3.95/month but have the option to upgrade your plan and add a host of additional paid and free features such as priority tech support.\n\nShared Hosting\n\nShared hosting is perfect for small business owners and even franchise owners who manage multiple websites. This hosting option puts each domain under one roof for immediate access.\n\nThe one downside to shared hosting is that it is not designed for high-traffic websites. So, when your website exceeds over 10,000 hits per day, it will begin to slow down on a shared hosting plan. Consequently, you might want to consider managed or other forms of hosting that are better suited for a great deal of traffic (anything over 10,000 visits a day).\n\nSiteGround offers three levels for shared hosting: Startup, GrowBig and GoGeek. They are all low-cost and are accompanied by a range of features for users — a perfect opportunity for small business owners on a budget.\n\nA one-month trial can also be purchased, for the same monthly price as advertised on annual plans, but you will be charged an additional $14.95 setup fee. The advertised monthly price remains the same no matter the length of your plan (12/24/36 months). However, the price per month is only valid for the initial invoiced term, after which, regular renewal prices apply. Let’s dive into a detailed outline of what you’ll get with each hosting service.\n\nShared Hosting Pricing\n\nPlan Pricing Specs Startup $3.95/month for the first invoice\n\n$9.95/month for renewal\n\n$14.95/year domain registration\n\nOne Website\n\nFree Site Transfer\n\n10GB Web Space\n\nSupports 10,000 Visits Monthly\n\nGrowBig $5.95/month for the first invoice\n\n$14.95/month for renewal\n\n$14.95/year domain registration\n\nMultiple websites\n\nFree Site Transfer\n\n20GB Web Space\n\nSupports 20,000 Visits Monthly\n\nPriority Tech Support\n\nSuperCacher for Great Speed\n\nOne Year of Free Wildcard SSL\n\n30 Day Backup Copies\n\nGoGeek $11.95/month for the first invoice\n\n$29.95/month for renewal\n\n$14.95/year domain registration\n\nMultiple Websites\n\n30GB Web Space\n\nSupports 100,000 Visits Monthly\n\nFree Site Transfer\n\nFewer Accounts on Server\n\nFree PCI Compliance\n\nWordPress & Joomla Staging\n\nOne-Click Git Repo Creation\n\nCloud Hosting\n\nSiteGround’s cloud hosting is swift and customizable. Though SiteGround’s cloud hosting plans are slightly more expensive than those of their competitors, is vital to note that you’ll benefit from advanced features such as enhanced security and 24/7 VIP support.\n\nThe company’s cloud hosting services come in four neatly bundled packages: Entry, Business, Business Plus and Super Power.\n\nPlans start at $80.00 and cap at $240.00 — there’s even the option to create your own plan. We can’t say this enough, SiteGround’s Cloud Hosting option is seriously one of the most customizable on the market. Like any other premium service, the more it is enhanced, the more expensive the plan becomes.\n\nAt the same time, you must realize that you are also purchasing peace of mind in the form of security. This is because Cloud Hosting is among one of the most secure forms of hosting.\n\nThe longer the terms of your hosting plan, the cheaper it’ll become. Here’s a breakdown of pricing for one, three, six and twelve months of service for SiteGround’s Cloud Hosting:\n\nCloud Hosting Pricing\n\nPlan Pricing\n\n(monthly)\n\nPricing\n\n(3-months)\n\nPricing\n\n(6-12 months)\n\nSpecs Entry $80/month $76/month $72/month\n\n2 Cores of CPU\n\n4 GB of Memory\n\n40 GB of SSD Space\n\n5TB Data Transfer\n\nBusiness $120.00/month $114.00/month $108.00/month\n\n3 Cores of CPU\n\n6 GB of Memory\n\n60 GB of SSD Space\n\n5TB Data Transfer\n\nBusiness Plus $160.00/month $152.00/month $144.00/month\n\n4 Cores of CPU\n\n8 GB of Memory\n\n80 GB of SSD Space\n\nSuper Power $240.00/month $228.00/month $216.00/month\n\n8 Cores of CPU\n\n10 GB of Memory\n\n120 GB of SSD Space\n\nYou can even go as far as to customize the above plans to add more cores of CPU, Memory and SSD Space. This is, of course, subjective, and depends on your bottom line and overall business goals.\n\nAdditionally, there are myriad of other features that users can access once they purchase a cloud hosting package. The following features come pre-installed:\n\nPre-Installed Features More Pre-Installed Features\n\nDaily Backups\n\nFree CDN & Multiple Locations\n\nFully-Managed Servers\n\n24/7 VIP Support\n\nApache/Nginx & CentOS\n\nExim Mail Server\n\nPrivate DNS Server Setup\n\nIPTables Firewall\n\nWHM & cPanel\n\nSoftaculous Auto Installer\n\nMySQL 5 & PostgreSQL\n\n5 PHP Versions & HHVM\n\nFree Domain Name\n\n1 Dedicated IP\n\nFree SSL Certificates\n\nSSH Access\n\nAnother upper hand of SiteGround’s cloud hosting is its near-seamless integration with platforms like WordPress, for which it offers 1-click installation, staging, SSH & WP-CLI, Auto Updates, SuperCacher and GIT Integrated.\n\nSiteGround also features integration for other platforms like Magento, Drupal and Joomla, offering 1-click installation for the latter as well.\n\nDedicated Hosting\n\nDedicated hosting is a great option for those who want to have faster speed. It also comes with the comfort of knowing data are stored on a server reserved especially for them. This sort of reassurance is priceless.\n\nSiteGround’s dedicated hosting is offered in three levels: Entry Server, Power Server, and Super Power Server. Each of them has their own unique nuances that make them perfect for small business owners who are looking for faster speeds, reliability and expecting high traffic to their website.\n\nDedicated Hosting Pricing\n\nPlan Pricing\n\n(monthly)\n\nPricing\n\n(3-months)\n\nPricing\n\n(6-12 months)\n\nSpecs Entry Server $229.00/month $223.00/month $217.00/month\n\nIntel Xeon E3-1230 CPU\n\n3.20Ghz CPU Clock Speed\n\n4 CPU Cores\n\n8 CPU Threads\n\n8MB CPU Cache\n\n4GB DDR3 RAM\n\n500GB SATA II HHD\n\n5TB Bandwidth\n\nPower Server $329.00/month $320.00/month $312.00/month\n\nIntel Xeon E3-1270 CPU\n\n3.50Ghz CPU Clock Speed\n\n4 CPU Cores\n\n8 CPU Threads\n\n8MB CPU Cache\n\n16GB DDR3 RAM\n\n1TB SATA II HHD\n\n5TB Bandwidth\n\nSuper Power Server $429.00/month $418.00/month $407.50/month\n\n2 x Intel Xeon e5-2620 CPU\n\n2.00Ghz CPU Clock Speed\n\n2×6 CPU Cores\n\n2×12 CPU Threads\n\n15MB COY Cache\n\n16Gb DDR3 RAM\n\n4x500Gb SATA III/ RAID 10 HDD\n\n5TB Bandwidth\n\nUnfortunately, adding features like integration with Joomla, WordPress and General Booster cost an additional $50.00/Month. You can even add on domain privacy for an additional $12.00/year.\n\nAs with SiteGround’s other plans, users can select the term length most comfortable for them, and choose the physical location of their desired data center.\n\nLast, it is imperative that you take into account the required one-time fee of $99.00 for setup.\n\nWordPress Hosting\n\nSiteGround is unique in that it offers managed WordPress hosting with all of its plans, no matter the type of hosting. The 1-click WordPress installation and free site transfer come standard on all plans, whilst the SuperCacher plugin is offered for free on all plans above StartUp. Users who purchase a GoGeek, any cloud hosting or any dedicated hosting plan also have access to WP staging and Git integration.\n\nWordPress Hosting Pricing\n\nPlan Pricing Features Startup $3.95/month\n\nWordPress Free Install\n\nWordPress Free Transfer\n\nWordPress Auto Update\n\nWordPress Advanced Security\n\nWordPress Related SUpport\n\nWP-CLI Pre-installed\n\nGrowBig $5.95/month\n\nPriority Tech Support\n\nSuperCacher for Great Speed\n\nOne Year of Free Wildcard SSL\n\n30 Day Backup Copies\n\nGoGeek $5.95/month\n\nFewer Accounts on Server\n\nFree PCI Compliance\n\nWordPress & Joomla Staging\n\nOne-Click Git Repo Creation\n\nTip: Like other hosting providers, SiteGround usually runs frequent promotions on its plans, so it’s best to keep an eye out for deals.\n\nStandout Hosting Features\n\nThirty-Day Backup\n\nThis feature is invaluable and is a great tool for business owners who need that extra bit of security. Data are also backed up for shared and cloud hosting accounts, and users can access and restore past backups from the cPanel.\n\nWordPress Integrations\n\nThis cuts out long waiting periods and multiple downloads, giving users the chance to quickly and securely download and install WordPress and related plugins.\n\nAffordable\n\nWith its most basic managed WordPress plan, SiteGround is only $3.95 per month on an annual plan.\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nYou have thirty days to request your money back but should reference the terms and conditions to ensure you meet the requirements for a refund. Otherwise, you should enjoy the service through the end of your agreement and find another hosting provider when your agreement is over.\n\nControl Panel\n\nThrough SiteGround’s Control Panel, users can design their website and get daily backups, ensuring the safety of your most valuable content.\n\nFrom within the cPanel, users can manage subdomains, addon domains, parked domains. You can also auto install Joomla and WordPress integrations. You can also find some of your most important features there, which include:\n\nIP address\n\nServer name/time\n\nDisk space\n\nEmail\n\nCustomer Support\n\nWith 24/7 live chat, phone, and email-based support, you can reach out to troubleshooting experts around the clock.\n\nDiversified Server Locations\n\nSiteGround has five server locations around the world- Chicago, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, and Milan.\n\nDomain Registration\n\nIf you don’t already have a domain, you’ll need to purchase one at an additional cost of $14.95 annually.\n\nYou can also choose from a number of popular, country-specific and special domains, that will give your website a final personal touch.\n\nIn case you already have a domain name, you can transfer it — and it’s free. The only thing to do now is to protect your personal privacy and contact info by registering personal info like name, email, phone number and more so the general public doesn’t gain access to your information. Privacy Protection costs $1/month.\n\nSiteGround Payment Terms & Conditions\n\nYou should take note of a few different things, namely SiteGround’s refund policy. If you meet any of the following criteria, you can apply for your money back within thirty days of purchase:\n\nInitial orders for hosting services are covered within thirty days from the day we activate the service(s)\n\nRenewal orders are not covered\n\nDomain name and Domain Privacy (ID Protect) fees are not refundable and may be due upon cancellation even if waived initially as part of a special promotion\n\nCloud and Dedicated Hosting Services, Paid Support or Third Party Services are not covered by the money back guarantee\n\nReseller packages are only covered if the complete Reseller package is canceled. The guarantee does not apply to termination of individual accounts in a Reseller package\n\nUsers have thirty days to request their money back, which gives you peace of mind if you’re not 100 percent satisfied with the service.\n\nAutomatic renewal is scheduled 15 days prior to expiration, and if you wish for services not to renew automatically, you must alert customer service.\n\nLastly, regarding payment, SiteGround accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Switch/Solo, checks/money orders and many other acceptable forms of payment. Although not listed, you can use PayPal to pay monthly for hosting services. For this, you must contact the sales department.\n\nUptime\n\nSiteGround offers a 99.9% uptime guarantee.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSiteGround’s customer service is top-notch, with highly trained and knowledgeable professionals offering 24/7 assistance. Members of their support team can, therefore, provide insight that only a seasoned hosting professional could provide, helping better optimize your site for speed and performance. Also, in comparison to other hosting companies, SiteGround’s shared hosting plans are more than affordable, making them an attractive option for small business owners. Lastly, with managed WordPress services offered on all hosting accounts- and not to mention WordPress’s seal of approval- SiteGround is a top option for business owners running a WordPress website."
