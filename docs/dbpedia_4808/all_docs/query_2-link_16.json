        "text": "So far, nothing. I have been with many hosts before and many of them overpromise and underdeliver. With SiteGround, it all works and they deliver on what you need!\n\nI do not like the SiteGround plugins like the optimizer plugin and security plugin, they have caused too much headaches from the optimizer plugin not allowing my website to load properly to their security plugin restrcting me from logging in directly to my WP ADMIN panel via siteground. But their customer support is 10/10 and they're the best support in the game!\n\nI was using BanaHosting, but after months of being a good customer they simply halted my service after 8 days of late payment! I had just launched a marketing campaign and all the potential clients were met with a non working wordpress site (thanks to BanaHosting)... I found SiteGround, I found they had support and contacted support explaining my situation, and they explained they could help and treated me as if they were my life-long friends. I purchased the manual support, gave my credentials to BanaHosting and the support team from SiteGround had my site up and running in less that 3 hours... fully migrated, fully running, extremely professionaly and communicative. This is the best service I've ever had. They are not just providers, they are business partners!\n\nI would have thought that the price is high at first, comparing to other hostings that charge half the price. But if you think about that its not only the hosting service, but access to their support, it is totally worth the price.\n\nEase of use, it abstracts the wordpress server/cpanel/php away so I dont think about it. Staging and version control, I can easily know what changed if I hire a freelance or something. Support, I usually dont tinker with Wordpress installations or migrations so I forget how do it. Support is a click away at a fair price.\n\nSiteGround offers excellent, fast hosting, but their best attribute is their support. They've now added an ai chatbot, but if it doesn't yield the necessary info, there is still the option to chat or call real support people. When I've needed to do this (usually about once a year), they have never failed to fix my problem.\n\nTechnical issues. Today, I tried to upgrade my Joomla site to Jooma 4, crashed it, and reinstalled from back-up, but it still wasn't working right. The person on chat fixed it for me in just a few minutes.\n\nIt is reliable, easy to use interface and simply the best support I have had anywhere. I have used many different webhosts and nothing else comes close in my experience. They have all the features I need and I am slowly moving all my hosting from other companies over there.\n\nWhen I have had questions regarding our website, I have always received excellent IT help. Either via web-chat or telephone, the specialists have always been able to very quickly resolve the issue, or walk me through exactly the steps that I needed to take in order to fix the problem. The help that I received has always been honest with me when I have asked questions about increasing services purchased through Siteground. In every instance, they could have upsold me products, but they did not. That is the epitome of honest, excellent service!\n\nI don't really understand this question. Siteground enables us to have a website, increasing visibility, allowing us to disseminate information to our patients. We have a website to educate our patients, but also so that when the public type in the dentist's name or olur clinic name, the first hit is our clinic and not \"Rate your MD.com\"\n\nWhile I have several accounts for the different businesses, it is easy to switch from one account to another. The platform remains the same unlike some services I use where depending on how I am logged in the set up can be different. I have gotten to know how to use Siteground's tools and their tech support is great. They are quick to respond and always helpful and have resolved the issues or given clear instructions on what I need to do to resolve or avoid the problem in the first place. I am not a web designer or techie by any means, I have learned on the job, and I appreciate that they don't talk to me like I should know everything already - they help me at my level to get back on track.\n\nI've had a cople of basic issues with my hosting over the past few years, nothing major, generally email related or just general questions and every time I called or used the chat option, the issues and the questions were taken care of immediately.\n\nHonestly, nothing at all. I can't honestly think of any issues I've had at all with SiteGround. They've been awesome and their service is top notch in my opinion.\n\nAfter looking at a few hosting providers, Siteground offered the best dedicated hosting, with a global CDN coverage included in the price and very good wordpress support - tools, features and after I discovered the plugins that come with it - SEO, website optimization, cache etc.\n\nA lot of their competitors offer freebies, like Google ads credit or 1 year free SSL and stuff like that. I understand that for a small company that's a big cost, but wouldn't hurt for them to enter in a partnership with someone and offer things like this.\n\nI host my website https://thereach.ai/ on Siteground. I ran various tests and analysis tools to understand my ranking, SEO score, optimization and honestly it works much better than some of the bigger hosting brands I used in the past. The site is responsive and fast."
