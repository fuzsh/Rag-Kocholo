        "text": "Hey @weberkristi\n\nHave these sites been connected before, or are you just trying to connect them now for the first time?\n\nDo you have any SiteGround sites that you can add to the Dashboard?\n\nAnd can you try temporarily disabling all security rules that might be present on the SiteGround hosting and see if that helps? Including firewalls, cloud proxies, etc.\n\nHi Bojan. Thanks for replying. I’ve had all of these sites in MainWP for several months now without any issues. However, I logged in today and of the 25 sites I manage, the only 15 sites I couldn’t connect with are the only ones hosted on SiteGround. I’ve disabled various plugins, including the iThemes Security plugin, and nothing has fixed it.\n\nThanks for the update.\n\nGotcha, all disconnected ones are hosted on SiteGround, but out of those that are connected, are any of them also on SiteGround?\n\nAnd do you know if all disconnected sites belong to the same SG account?\n\nIf you have access to the SiteGround hosting settings, can you try disabling any security rules or CDN they might have enabled?"
