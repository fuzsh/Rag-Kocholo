        "text": "I currently recommend SiteGround hosting for WordPress Web projects whose requirements match what SiteGround offers.\n\nIf you’re thinking about using me for your WordPress Web project, I will — at some point early on — ask whether you’re open to using (or moving your existing site to) SiteGround.\n\nYou may wonder why, and you should. I offer my reasons below.\n\nBut first, let me address an elephant in the room.\n\n“Aren’t you a SiteGround affiliate, dude?”\n\nYes, I am an affiliate of SiteGround. If someone purchases SiteGround hosting using my affiliate link, I earn a small commission, and it costs the purchaser nothing extra.\n\nLike every ethical professional I know, I enter into affiliate relationships only with enterprises I trust — those whose goods and services I would recommend to my best friend if there were no commission to be earned.\n\nSo, if you’re at all concerned by this affiliate thing, don’t click on my affiliate link.\n\nWhy SiteGround Hosting: Some of the Reasons\n\nI don’t want to get all in the weeds here.\n\nI don’t want to oversell.\n\nI just want you to understand where I’m coming from.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you hire me, you get to decide which hosting firm you use. I just want to give you some bullet points. If/when we talk, I’ll be happy to drill down deeper.\n\nAren’t all Web-hosting providers pretty much the same?\n\nNo, they’re not.\n\nIn my experience (again, I’ve dealt with many Web-hosting firms since I started building and maintaining Web sites in 1994), it’s not a question of whether a Web-hosting service will go down the toilet; it’s a question of when.\n\nMost of the failures I’ve encountered in the Web hosting space happened when corporate ownership changed. Large corporations acquire and consolidate small hosting vendors, and things go to poop.\n\nI can’t tell you this won’t happen to SiteGround. I can only tell you that it hasn’t yet.\n\nSumming Up\n\nIf you hire me, you’re the boss. You make the decisions, including where to host your site. But, as I often say (and wrote about in this blog post), that doesn’t mean I won’t push back if I think you’re heading in a wrong direction.\n\nThink of it this way: If you hire a contractor to build a deck, you’ll probably trust her to choose the lumber and joist hangers and fasteners and post hardware and so on. And you probably won’t require that she use your drill and miter saw and nail gun instead of hers. I’m just sayin’…"
