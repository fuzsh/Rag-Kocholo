        "text": "As a website owner and hosting expert, I have tested hundreds of hosting providers and can tell you that SiteGround is one of the very best on the market. Plus when 3 million website owners trust you with their domains, you are doing something right.\n\nIn the rest of this SiteGround review, we’ll take a tour through the web host’s plans, pricing, features offered, real-life performance stats, customer support, and other important considerations every webmaster should consider. Within the hour, you’ll decide for yourself if it’s the web host for you.\n\nFun fact: Our website Unite.AI is hosted on SiteGround!\n\nSiteGround Review\n\nSiteGround was founded in 2004 and has grown over two decades into one of the most reputable privately owned web hosts globally. The provider offers shared hosting, cloud hosting, reseller hosting, and WordPress-specific plans. They also have hosting plans tailored to agencies and a built-in email marketing tool.\n\nSiteGround currently hosts over 3 million domain names across 11 data centers. For whichever of SiteGround’s plans you go for, you get a free SSL certificate, free email, daily backups, free CDN integration, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nSiteGround is also a fan favorite because they are eco-conscious. Their data centers match 100% of the energy consumed by their global operations with renewable energy. The company has been reviewed by over 16,000 people on TrustPilot and scored an impressive 4.8 stars.\n\nSiteGround Rating – My Personal Take\n\nDo a quick search on Google and you’ll find thousands of web hosting providers on the market, all claiming to offer the best services for every website need. In my experience reviewing hosts, I have found that it’s logical to create a standard way to compare web hosts and rate them properly.\n\nConsidering the important features SiteGround offers and how they perform, here’s how I’d rate the web host on a scale of 1.0-5.0. Note that these scores are not static and may change as the host improves their offering:\n\nQualityMy ratingWhy I gave this scoreFeatures and specs4.8Free SSL, CDN, email migration, renewable energy match, free WordPress migration, and out-of-the-box caching are some of the features that make SiteGround amazing. However, not offering dedicated hosting and no free domains, are why the host doesn’t get full points.Pricing4.9Starting at $3.99 per month, SiteGround is one of the most affordable hosts on the market. There are, however, cheaper hosting plans from other providers.Performance stats 5.0An incredible time-to-first-byte of 92 ms puts SiteGround at the very top in terms of server response time. SiteGround also uses SSD storage and gives you a 99.9% guaranteed uptime.Ease of use4.9SiteGround has its own native control panel called Site Tools. In addition, free WordPress integration and an intuitive user interface make the provider’s software very easy to use.Customer support guarantee4.7SiteGround has a thriving support center – Live chat, email tickets, and a knowledgebase. They also have a horde of WordPress-specific tutorials. However, to enjoy their support you need to be a customer – i.e. buy one of their plans.\n\nSiteGround Hosting Plans & Pricing – 2024\n\nSiteGround offers shared hosting, cloud hosting, reseller hosting, WordPress hosting, WooCommerce hosting, and web hosting for agencies. For most of their plans, you get a 30-day guarantee, giving you enough time to decide if it’s for you.\n\nOnce you have decided on a plan from SiteGround, you can pay via card – VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.\n\nSiteGround’s shared hosting plans\n\nStartUp\n\nSpace offered – 10 GB\n\nBandwidth – Unmetered traffic\n\nNumber of websites – 1 website allowed\n\nPrice – $3.99 per month billed annually\n\nGrowBig\n\nSpace offered – 20 GB\n\nBandwidth – Unmetered traffic\n\nNumber of websites – Unlimited websites allowed\n\nPrice – $6.69 per month billed annually\n\nGoGeek\n\nSpace offered – 40 GB\n\nBandwidth – Unmetered traffic\n\nNumber of websites – Unlimited websites allowed\n\nPrice – $10.69/month billed annually\n\nSiteGround’s GrowBig shared hosting plan gives you the most value for money. 20 GB of storage, unlimited websites, and unmetered traffic at $6.69/month is a great deal.\n\nWho this is for:\n\nLike any other web host, SiteGround shared hosting plans involve sharing server resources with other website owners and are best for small or new websites like portfolio websites, dropshipping landing pages, blogs, etc. that don’t need a lot of resources. If you won’t be using more than 40 GB of storage, then their shared hosting plans are best for you.\n\nSiteGround’s cloud hosting plans\n\nJump Start\n\nSpace offered – 40 GB SSD storage\n\nBandwidth – 5 terabytes\n\nMemory – 8 Gigabytes\n\nPrice – $100/month billed annually\n\nBusiness\n\nSpace offered – 80 GB SSD storage\n\nBandwidth – 5 terabytes\n\nMemory – 12 Gigabytes\n\nPrice – $200/month billed annually\n\nBusiness Plus\n\nSpace offered – 120 GB SSD storage\n\nBandwidth – 5 terabytes\n\nMemory – 16 Gigabytes\n\nPrice – $300/month billed annually\n\nSuper Power\n\nSpace offered – 160 GB SSD storage\n\nBandwidth – 5 terabytes\n\nMemory – 20 Gigabytes\n\nPrice – $400/month billed annually\n\nSiteGround’s Business cloud hosting is best for you if you have outgrown your shared hosting plan. For $200/month, you get 12 GB of memory, 80 GB SSD storage, and a bandwidth of 5 TB.\n\nSiteGround Custom Cloud\n\nAside from these fixed plans, SiteGround also offers Custom Cloud plans that allow you to tweak exactly how many CPU cores, how much memory, and storage space you want, without overspending.\n\nThese are super awesome if you need more resources than the Jump Start plan but less than the higher tiers – you can make fine adjustments to your resource demand.\n\nWho this is for:\n\nSiteGround’s cloud hosting plans are best for websites and stores that need more resources than shared hosting offers or have traffic that peaks at intervals – e.g. eCommerce stores during sales events or brands that sell seasonal products, web application providers, etc.\n\nWith cloud hosting, you have more control over the resources you use and how much you spend.\n\nSiteGround’s WordPress hosting plans\n\nStartUp\n\nSpace offered – 10 GB\n\nBandwidth – Unmetered traffic\n\nNumber of websites – 1 website allowed\n\nPrice – $3.99 per month billed annually\n\nExtra features – Free WP installation, Free WP migrator, WordPress auto-updates, WP-CLI and SSH included, Managed WordPress hosting.\n\nGrowBig\n\nSpace offered – 20 GB\n\nBandwidth – Unmetered traffic\n\nNumber of websites – Unlimited websites allowed\n\nPrice – $6.69 per month billed annually\n\nExtra features – Everything in StartUp plus access to on-demand backup copies, faster PHP, and a website staging tool built-in.\n\nGoGeek\n\nSpace offered – 40 GB\n\nBandwidth – Unmetered traffic\n\nNumber of websites – Unlimited websites allowed\n\nPrice – $10.69/month billed annually\n\nExtra features – Everything in GrowBig plus free private DNS and priority when requesting support.\n\nLike their shared hosting plans, I’ll recommend SiteGround’s GrowBig WordPress hosting plan if you’re just starting with them. SiteGround’s WordPress plans are their shared hosting plans plus WordPress-specific features.\n\nWho this is for:\n\nSiteGround’s WordPress plans are meant for… you guessed it!… websites built on or that you intend to build on WordPress. You get free WordPress website migration, automatic updates of the WordPress software, the WordPress command line, etc. all in a comprehensive managed WordPress package.\n\nSiteGround’s reseller hosting plans\n\nGrowBig\n\nSpace offered – 20 GB storage\n\nFeatures – Free WP installation, WordPress auto-updates, Free WP Migrator plugin, free SSL, CDN & email, WP-CLI & SSH\n\nPrice – $6.69/month billed annually\n\nGoGeek\n\nSpace offered – 40 GB storage\n\nFeatures – GrowBig features plus free private DNS and priority support\n\nPrice – $10.69/month billed annually\n\nCloud\n\nSpace offered – 40 GB storage\n\nFeatures – GoGeek’s features plus access to customize client access and tailor your resources\n\nPrice – $100/month billed annually.\n\nSiteGround’s GoGeek reseller hosting plans are excellent for new hosting resellers. 40 GB of storage, WordPress-specific features, free private DNS, and priority in support, all for $10.69/month.\n\nI like how their reseller hosting plans are pooled from their shared and cloud hosting plans. Their Cloud reseller hosting plan is their basic cloud hosting plan allowing you to configure your resource demand.\n\nWho this is for:\n\nSiteGround’s reseller hosting plans are designed for website developers, marketing agencies, IT guys, and web hosting entrepreneurs who want to sell hosting plans as theirs without needing to invest in actual physical data centers.\n\nYou can integrate these hosting plans as cross-sells to your core services to make more money from your clients.\n\nSiteGround’s WooCommerce hosting\n\nSiteGround’s WooCommerce hosting plans are an exact match with their WordPress plans. However, this time, we recommend the GoGeek plan priced at $10.69/month. On all plans you get WooCommerce pre-installed, built-in payment acceptance methods, a free CDN, a custom web application firewall (WAF), and other features adapted for WordPress eCommerce sites.\n\nWho this is for:\n\nSiteGround’s WooCommerce plans are best for business owners who want to run their eCommerce stores on WordPress. WooCommerce comes built-in and is one of the best WordPress eCommerce store-building tools.\n\nSiteGround’s Features\n\nHere’s an overview of the core features offered by SiteGround across its hosting plans:\n\nSSD storage\n\nFree website builders – WordPress and Weebly\n\nDaily backups\n\nWordPress acceleration features\n\nFree email tools\n\nOut-of-the-box caching\n\nRenewable energy match\n\nFree SSL and CDN\n\nSiteGround offers many of the industry-standard features you’d expect from a world-class host but one thing that makes them stand out is that their technology is built on Google Cloud making them one of the swiftest and most reliable hosts on the market:\n\nThey are also one of the few hosts on the market that have ditched the traditional cPanel and provide a custom control panel called Site Tools. The result? A dashboard that makes managing your website’s backend incredibly easy.\n\nSiteGround Performance Tests\n\nWhen considering a new web host, you should evaluate their real-life performance and not just assume the figures they claim on their websites. Some important performance parameters to consider include – speed (average server response time), uptime, and overall performance in search engines.\n\nA web host’s speed is how quickly their server starts to send back data after a user tries to visit a website hosted by them. The uptime measures how reliably the website is available online and is typically scored as a percentage – 99.9% is the industry standard.\n\nThe lower the web host’s response time, the quicker your website will load, meaning less customer bounce and more potential conversions. And high uptime figures mean your website will experience little to no downtime.\n\nTo save you the hassle of finding a website hosted on SiteGround, I did the hard work for you and used GTMetrix to measure the host’s average speed and performance. These were the results:\n\nSiteGround is super impressive and their servers responded in as little as 92 milliseconds – 0.092 seconds. The overall performance of the website hosted on their platform was 95% which is also incredible.\n\nTo test their uptime, I used Uptime Robot and evaluated the website’s availability over the last 30 days:\n\nOver the last 30 days, the website was available 100% of the time, proving their 99.99% uptime claim.\n\nSiteGround’s Customer Support\n\nSiteGround has a thriving customer support hub to answer and solve queries 24/7 via:\n\nLive chat\n\nSiteGround allows you to chat live with their agents 24/7. However, I was a bit disappointed because you’d have to be a paying customer before you can chat with their live agents. Many other web hosts allow you to chat with an agent and make inquiries before you choose a plan.\n\nPhone support\n\nSiteGround also offers different phone lines to reach their agents and talk in real-time. However, like their live chat, you must be a paying customer to see their phone lines and place a call. Also, the phone lines are limited to English.\n\nAn extensive knowledge base\n\nIt’s always great to see a knowledge base that answers questions on everything from how to use the host’s particular features to everything else like domain name issues, WordPress maintenance, the control panel, etc. – and SiteGround doesn’t disappoint.\n\nThe web host’s knowledge base page also has a built-in search engine to make finding the right resources as easy as possible.\n\nEmail support tickets\n\nSiteGround also offers support via email. You can create support tickets on their website that will automatically be forwarded to your email where an agent will reach out to you.\n\nA blog section\n\nWant to stay up-to-date with industry news, marketing trends, tips, and strategies? SiteGround’s blog section is rich with informative posts you’ll surely find helpful.\n\nWordPress tutorials\n\nIf you plan to build your website on WordPress, you’ll be spoilt silly with resources on SiteGround. The provider has several help portals specifically tailored for WordPress owners including a WordPress Tutorials page, a WordPress optimization ebook, a WordPress security ebook, and a WooCommerce ebook.\n\nSiteGround’s security features\n\nSiteGround takes your website security seriously and you should carefully analyze those offered by any host you are considering to protect yourself from DDoS attacks, cross-site forgery, malware, and other security threats.\n\nOn every one of SiteGround’s plans, you get their custom web application firewall (WAF) built-in with regularly updated security rules. SiteGround also boasts an AI-powered anti-bot system to protect your site from bad bots trying to scrape your website, take over your account, or steal card details via carding.\n\nAnd on every plan, you get a free SSL certificate, giving you the ‘padlock’ seal of trust and ‘HTTPS’ badge that is now a Google ranking factor.\n\nSiteGround’s website builders\n\nMany website owners like you want to consolidate their web hosting, domain name registration, and website building from the same provider. While SiteGround doesn’t offer free domains, you can register domains via their platform.\n\nAnd when it’s time to build your website, you can use their free website builders – WordPress and Weebly offered free of charge on every package:\n\nIt’s important to note that these website builders are somewhat limited – well, they are free. If you want more functionality, you’ll have to pay for premium website builders like Wix or Squarespace.\n\nSiteGround's User-Friendliness\n\nHow easy is SiteGround to use – setting up an account, managing your website’s backend via the control panel, and installing WordPress? Let’s see:\n\nRegistering an account with SiteGround\n\nTo register an account with the hosting provider, you only need to pay for one of their hosting plans.\n\nStep 1:\n\nNavigate to the hosting type you want and choose a package. Click on ‘Get plan’. You’ll redirected to the ‘specify your domain’ page:\n\nStep 2:\n\nIf you have an existing domain you want to use, check the ‘Existing domain’ box and move forward. If you don’t you can type in a new domain you are interested in and if it is available, you will move onto the checkout page with the domain price added to your overall cost.\n\nStep 3:\n\nHere, you type in your email and confirm your password. Next fill in your personal details, address, and company name. Finally, you’ll need to fill in your payment details and then choose your payment schedule – monthly, annually, or every 2 years:\n\nYou can also choose the Site Scanner as an addon that runs daily scans on your website to detect and quarantine malware.\n\nStep 4:\n\nFinally, agree to SiteGround’s policies and click ‘Pay now’’. And voila! Your account is created and you can enjoy the web host’s support and services to the fullest.\n\nSiteGround’s intuitive Control Panel\n\nSiteGround is one of the few hosts on the market who have dared to ditch the traditional cPanel and created their intuitive custom control panel – Site Tools.\n\nAnd boy was I impressed! Site Tools is very easy to use, even for web hosting newbies. From the dashboard, you can install WordPress in 1 minute, set up email accounts, manage your website files, and access the Site Scanner, and the content delivery network.\n\nOne really fun feature of Site Tools is the built-in analytics tool:\n\nYou can see how many unique visitors to your domain per day and your page views.\n\nAt the left menu bar, you can access every setting related to your website, security, loading speed, domain name, email, and developer tools if you are no stranger to code.\n\nHow to install WordPress on SiteGround\n\nInstalling WordPress on SiteGround is incredibly easy and the quickest way is using Site Tools. Simply click on ‘Install and manage WordPress’ on your dashboard:\n\nNext, choose whether you want to create a WordPress website alone or WordPress + WooCommerce.\n\nNow, fill in your domain name, select your language, and specify the installation path. Choose a username and password and click ‘Install’:\n\nAnd in just one click, WordPress will be installed on your website:\n\nServer footprint and CDN\n\nYou should also consider the server footprint and content delivery network (CDN) on any web host. The more servers your web host has and the more widely spread they are, the quicker your average website load speed will be for website visitors globally.\n\nOn the other hand, using a content delivery network (CDN), your web host caches your website’s data and distributes it across a network of servers to improve your website load speed.\n\nWebsites hosted on SiteGround have access to a network of data centers spread across four continents. This network is then expanded by 170 CDN edge network locations around the world. SiteGround’s website caching solution is powered by Google Cloud – no wonder their incredible performance.\n\nConclusion: Should you choose SiteGround?\n\nSiteGround is an incredible web hosting provider and one of the best on the market. And the reviews from so many customers are singing their praises. I recommend SiteGround as your next hosting provider whether you are creating a new website or looking for better services than your current provider.\n\nTheir server response speeds and reliability are simply unmatched. And if you are new to web hosting, you’ll find Site Tools incredibly easy to use to manage your website’s backend.\n\nSiteGround gives you everything you need to get your website running from scratch – well almost. You’ll have to pay extra to register a domain name. Their Site Scanner tool also comes with a fee. However, we recommend SiteGround!\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes SiteGround offer free hosting?\n\nSiteGround doesn’t offer a free web hosting package like other hosts do – for example, Hostinger. Their most basic shared hosting plan, StartUp is priced at $3.99/month and billed annually.\n\nIs WordPress free with SiteGround?\n\nFor every plan on SiteGround, and more so for their WordPress hosting plans, you get WordPress for free. You also get a free WordPress migrator and the WP-CLI built-in.\n\nWhich one is better Bluehost or SiteGround?\n\nBlueHost and SiteGround are both WordPress-accredited hosts, so this is a tough matchup. In terms of performance, SiteGround trumps BlueHost. On the other hand, BlueHost’s plans are cheaper and start at $2.95/month. Plus, BlueHost’s platform is to use.\n\nOverall, I think SiteGround is a bit better than BlueHost.\n\nWhat are some great SiteGround alternatives?"
