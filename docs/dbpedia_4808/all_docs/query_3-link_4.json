        "text": "In 2024, we celebrate a huge milestone – 20 years in the web hosting business. In our dynamic sector, such milestones are not only markers of time, they are indicators of hard work, adaptability, striving for excellence, and staying true to your values. Our journey was filled with all of that and a lot more!\n\nFor two decades, SiteGround has been at the forefront of the web hosting industry, helping millions of creative and ambitious individuals start their online presence. Our journey has been nothing short of inspiring, filled with challenges, growth, learning, and most importantly, the loyalty and support of our clients and partners.\n\nA Look Back\n\nThe story of SiteGround began in 2004 with a dream: we wanted to create a hosting service that redefines the standards in this field. We weren’t happy with the level of service offered at the time, so we rolled up our sleeves to build the service we would like to use ourselves. In the beginning, our team was very small and everyone was doing everything, wearing multiple hats. At the end of the first intense year, we got a few hundred clients.\n\nToday, SiteGround is a family of over 500 smart, enthusiastic, and hardworking people. Our hosting platform is home to more than 3 Million domains, and our data centers are spread over 6 continents. All these achievements are the result of our commitment to excellence, innovation, and customer satisfaction.\n\n20 Valuable Lessons from 20 Years in Business\n\nThrough the past 20 years, we’ve witnessed many changes and developments – in technology, in our industry, in consumer behavior, and in the way people work. We’ve also learned invaluable lessons along the way.\n\nWe feel these extend beyond the web hosting field and apply to any online venture or business. From adapting to technological changes to creating strong client relationships, each experience has helped us grow. For our 20th anniversary, we want to share the lessons we learned, hoping to help you on your way to success.\n\nAnd that’s not all – on our 20th-anniversary website, you will also find links to our special giveaway featuring exclusive 20th-anniversary merch. Join us in celebrating this milestone and stand a chance to win limited edition SiteGround swag.\n\nA Big Thank You\n\nAs we celebrate our 20th-anniversary milestone, we do so with gratitude to our clients who have entrusted us with their websites and businesses, to our team members for their dedication and passion, and to our partners for their loyalty and cooperation. We begin our next chapter with even more enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead, and commitment to keep our top-notch hosting service. Here’s to the next 20 years of success together!"
