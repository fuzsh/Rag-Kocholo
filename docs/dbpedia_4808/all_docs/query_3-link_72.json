        "text": "Siteground Black Friday Deals are here! This is the best time in the year to take advantage of huge discounts for their web hosting plans.\n\nI have never seen Siteground offer 86% OFF all their web hosting plans before so this is truly quite rare.\n\nSiteground usually offers discounts on very long subscriptions such as their 3 Year hosting plans.\n\nBut for this year’s Black Friday sale, they are offering a massive 86% OFF for ALL their hosting plans with the 12-Month subscription too.\n\nStartup plan from just $2.99/month! (From regular $14.99)\n\nGrowBig plan from just $4.99/month (From regular $24.99)\n\nGoGeek plan from just $7.99/month (From regular $39.99)\n\nSeriously, this is such a STEAL.\n\nIf you are planning to get a fast and reliable web host or switch to a new one – get this insane deal while it lasts! The icing on top: Siteground offers FREE site migration for the GoBig and GoGeek plans.\n\nIn this post, you’ll also find my affiliate links to Siteground’s Black Friday Cyber Monday hosting deals with the discounted coupon code!\n\nWhat is the Siteground Black Friday Offer in 2023?\n\nThe Siteground Black Friday sale for 2023 offers a huge discount on web hosting. Siteground shared hosting plan starts at just $1.99 per month with the current sale.\n\nThey are currently offering up to 86% off web hosting!\n\nThe regular price for the cheapest plan is $14.99 per month, but you can get it at just $1.99! Resulting in savings of about $156 per year. You can lock in the lower price NOW!\n\nSiteground deals include savings on their three hosting plans – Startup, GrowBig, and GoGeek. All three options include savings of 84% to 86% off the standard price.\n\nYou need to pay upfront for the year. However, this is when you can lock in the lower price. Enjoy 12 months of web hosting for about the price of 2 months of the same hosting.\n\nKey Features\n\nI believe this year’s Black Friday Cyber Monday discount is much bigger than the previous year.\n\nThis discount applies on all three of Siteground’s web hosting plans.\n\nHosting plans compared: Differences\n\nIn a nutshell, each plan differs by its website hosting capabilities depending on the number of monthly visits your website has.\n\nIf your website gets more than 10,000 monthly visits, it is better to get the bigger plans such as GrowBig. This will affect how their servers can handle your site traffic.\n\nSo each hosting plan differ in:\n\nNumber of monthly visits\n\nWeb space\n\nWebsites hosted\n\nData transfer\n\nServer resources\n\nDepending on the plan that you choose, you can get 10 GB to 40 GB of web storage space. It would also affects the number of websites you can create.\n\nIf you have a small blog or online eCommerce store, the startup plan should suffice.\n\nThe average business site built with a WordPress installation uses about 1 GB of data.\n\nEssential features\n\nAnyway, all three hosting plans include the following key features:\n\nUnmetered traffic\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nFree CMS install\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree email\n\nManaged WordPress\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nAll three plans include free SSL certificates, CDN, email, and other common features often found with shared hosting plans.\n\nThese features make it easier to set up a website and manage everything from a single platform, including your business email and content.\n\nSiteground web hosting also features 24/7 customer service. You can contact the help desk any time of the day or night and receive a swift response.\n\nWordPress features\n\nI have noticed that Siteground is particularly focused on the WordPress platform.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with WordPress, it is a free content management system built on MySQL databases and PHP files.\n\nIt includes access to tens of thousands of themes and plugins.\n\nWordPress also has an easy-to-navigate user dashboard and simple website builder. Anyone can easily create, edit, and manage a website using WordPress.\n\nThe simplicity of WordPress and the variety of plugins have helped make it the most used content management system.\n\nOver 40% of all websites currently on the Internet were built using WordPress.\n\nWordPress-focused hosting support\n\nSiteground’s shared hosting plans are indeed specialised for WordPress.\n\nWhile other shared hosting plans allow you to easily install WordPress, a hosting plan designed specifically for the platform provides greater support.\n\nIf you experience any technical issues with your WordPress site, you can rely on the experts at Siteground to help you out.\n\nEach plan also comes with WordPress-optimized features, such as automatic WordPress updates!\n\nSo they have really awesome useful features that make WordPress installation and optimization a breeze.\n\nSuch as free WordPress installation, smooth website transfers, managed security updates, and an intuitive client dashboard.\n\nYou can quickly launch new WordPress sites, transfer existing sites, and automate your updates.\n\nThe dashboard is easy to navigate and allows anyone to instantly start setting up a website.\n\nTheir Black Friday Cyber Monday deals are truly one of the best deals for web hosting right now. If you’re thinking of switching hosts, this is the perfect time to get in on a reliable hosting solution.\n\nI believe their Cyber Monday discounts have been extended so there’s still time to get this limited-time offer!\n\nIf your website has outgrown shared hosting, Siteground also offers cloud hosting with dedicated servers for higher performance.\n\nPlans and Pricing\n\nLet’s recap again. Siteground has three web hosting plans on a huge discount right now:\n\nStartup – 86% off\n\nGrowBig – 84% off\n\nGoGeek – 85% off\n\nEach hosting plan requires you to complete an annual purchase instead of a monthly one.\n\nHowever, with this Black Friday Deal, the annual cost is just a little over the standard monthly cost.\n\nStartup plan\n\nThe Startup Plan typically costs $14.99 per month. It is intended for beginners and small businesses, as it only allows you to set up a single website. Now, you can get it at $1.99 per month!\n\nThis is really a no-brainer.\n\nWith the Siteground Black Friday Deal, you can pay $23.88 plus taxes and fees for an entire year of shared hosting, which is 86% in savings compared to the standard price.\n\nIf you have a blog or an online store, this basic plan is really an excellent web hosting solution for you to get started.\n\nGrowBig plan\n\nThe GrowBig Plan has a standard price of $24.99 per month. The current deal allows you to get a full year for $3.99 per month, which is 84% of the standard price.\n\nI’m currently on the GrowBig plan and it offers better performance features which has improved my site speed!\n\nGoGeek plan\n\nThe GoGeek Plan normally costs $39.99 per month. It is the highest-tier plan and the most expensive.\n\nWith the current deal, you pay just $5.99 per month for the first year. If you are a developer or agency, the GoGeek plan would be best.\n\nThis is really a great time to get this plan if you are building websites for clients.\n\nNo matter which of the plans you choose, you receive tremendous savings.\n\nWhile other web hosts offer free domain name in its packages, Siteground does not. But they do offer free migration on their GoBig and GoGeek plans.\n\nDuring Black Friday, the savings on their regular prices makes it a great deal to get their annual hosting plans.\n\nOverview of Siteground’s Hosting Plans\n\nSiteground is a web hosting company founded in 2004. It currently provides hosting for over two million domains around the world. It is one of the most recommended hosting companies for WordPress hosting.\n\nThey have data centers across the globe to ensure optimal connectivity for websites.\n\nSiteground has three types of hosting: shared hosting, cloud hosting, and reseller hosting.\n\nThe most common type of web hosting is shared hosting. The current Siteground Black Friday Deal is focused on their shared hosting plans. This is focused on WordPress and WooCommerce platforms.\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\nThe plans are also backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you are not happy with the service, you have 30 days to cancel and receive a full refund. After 30 days, you cancel your service but will not get a full refund.\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nAll of Siteground’s hosting plans include unlimited databases, which is useful for WordPress sites.\n\nWordPress uses MySQL databases to store data and dynamically generate webpages using PHP scripts.\n\nYou also get automatic updates. Siteground can automatically update your WordPress installation and plugins whenever a new release is available. That’s pretty awesome, isn’t it?\n\nKeeping your WordPress installation and plugins updated is essential for keeping your site secure and avoiding any issues that may impact the user experience or load times.\n\nFor example, an outdated plugin may stop working properly or cause issues with elements on the pages.\n\nThe bottom line is that Siteground optimizes and simplifies how you manage a WordPress site.\n\nHere is a closer look at each hosting plan.\n\nStartup Plan features\n\nThe Startup Plan is the most affordable of the Siteground hosting plans. Some of the main features of the Startup Plan include:\n\n1 website\n\n10 GB of storage\n\n10,000 visits per month\n\nFree WP installation and migrator\n\nFree SSL\n\nDaily backups\n\nFree email and CDN\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nManaged WordPress\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\nThese features are fairly standard for a basic WordPress hosting plan. You can create a single WordPress site. You also get 10 GB of storage, which is more than enough for one website.\n\nYou can receive about 10,000 monthly visits before Siteground starts limiting bandwidth. Luckily, the typical small business website is unlikely to exceed 10,000 visitors in a month.\n\nMigrating a WordPress site to Siteground is also easy. You can use the free WP Migrator to automate the migration process and avoid any errors that could result in downtime for your website.\n\nGrowBig Plan features\n\nThe GrowBig Plan is made for those that want to grow their business online. You can build more sites and receive more traffic compared to the Standard Plan.\n\nYou get everything provided with the Standard Plan, along with the following essential features:\n\nUnlimited websites\n\n20 GB of storage\n\n100,000 visits per month\n\nOn-demand backup copies\n\n30% faster PHP\n\nStaging\n\nThe GrowBig Plan offers a better value for those that expect to receive more than 10,000 visitors per month. You can also build unlimited websites, which is not an option on the Standard Plan.\n\nSo, if you are a marketing agency building websites for clients, you’d want to get the GrowBig plan.\n\nSecurity and Backups\n\nThe GrowBig Plan also allows you to create up to five on-demand backups. You can use a backup to instantly restore your website if you need to undo a recent change.\n\nYou need to purchase the on-demand backups individually when using the Startup Plan.\n\nFaster loading times\n\nSiteground uses a different method for implementing PHP on the GrowBig and GoGeek Plans. If fast speed is important for your business, consider getting the GrowBig and GoGeek.\n\nCompared to the Startup Plan, you can enjoy up to 30% faster PHP responses.\n\nAs WordPress is mostly built using PHP, a faster PHP framework results in faster loading times for your website.\n\nStaging\n\nSiteground also adds a helpful staging feature. The staging feature allows you to create a copy of your website for testing.\n\nYou can test code or changes before implementing them on your live site.\n\nI personally use the staging feature when implementing technical changes on my own website such as the core web vitals optimizations.\n\nGoGeek Plan features\n\nThe GoGeek Plan includes everything that you get with the GoBig Plan, along with the following features:\n\n40 GB of storage\n\n400,000 visits per month\n\nWhite label clients\n\nFree private DNS\n\nPriority support\n\nThe GoGeek Plan comes with ample storage for just about any type of online endeavor. You can also build unlimited websites and receive up to 400,000 visits per month.\n\nThe GoGeek Plan is designed for entrepreneurs and businesses that expect significant traffic or require more storage.\n\nLarge eCommerce sites and entertainment sites may also require the extra features included with the GoGeek Plan.\n\nWhite-label\n\nYou also get white-label support with the GoGeek Plan. White labeling allows you to give your clients access to a custom set of tools without the Siteground branding.\n\nYou can use this reseller hosting feature to offer white-label hosting and generate income.\n\nFree private DNS\n\nThe GoGeek Plan also comes with a free private DNS. You can set up a custom domain name for use with your nameservers.\n\nThe free private DNS can help create a more consistent image when selling white-label hosting.\n\nPriority support\n\nGoGeek Plan customers receive priority support.\n\nThe customer service department prioritizes your support tickets when something goes wrong.\n\nYou receive help from the most experienced customer support agents, so you can resolve your issue faster.\n\nReasons for Getting Siteground Black Friday Offer\n\nAlong with the features discussed, Siteground offers many reasons to sign up for hosting during the Black Friday sale, including:\n\nOne-click app installer\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nCloudflare app in cPanel\n\nFree backups\n\nSite speed\n\nCustomer support\n\nThe Siteground Black Friday Deal is also incredibly affordable.
