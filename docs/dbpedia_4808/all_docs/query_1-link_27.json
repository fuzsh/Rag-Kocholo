        "text": "You might be wondering why I am recommending SiteGround Web Hosting when I started out my first website using Bluehost.\n\nThe answer is simple.\n\nOver time you learn new things and learn new products that you think might be of overall better quality.\n\nAbout a year after starting my website and just before our big re-brand to Lady Boss Studio, I switched over to Siteground.\n\nIf I was going to take things to the next level, it was going to be with a web hosting provider I could seriously depend on!\n\nThe pricing between the two works out to about the same at $3.95 USD/month but there are a few upsides to SiteGround Web Hosting for WordPress over BlueHost.\n\nYou might be wondering what uptime is…\n\nThink of it this way, the amount of time your site spends NOT up and running is called downtime. Therefore, you want the highest possible uptime percentage.\n\nDowntown can happen for multiple reasons. The servers can become overloaded because of too much traffic, you might have someone hack into your site, or the web hosting provider may simply need to do maintenance on their server.\n\nAll of these translate into your site going down for an unpredictable amount of time.\n\nNot only is the amount of time the site is down unpredictable, but when it will go down is also entirely unpredictable.\n\nThis can mean a major loss for you if you are seeing an influx of traffic from a guest post or perhaps some new great marketing you have just implemented.\n\nThis is why the uptime of 99% claimed by SiteGround Web Hosting is amazing, and they have definitely remained true to that promise.\n\nThis is perhaps my favorite reason to be with SiteGround Web Hosting!\n\nI know uptime is extremely important and I don’t want to take away from that but…. this removes any worries you might have about getting an existing site set up with a new hosting provider.\n\nAlso, in case you didn’t know, a lot of web hosting providers will refund you a pro-rated amount even if you originally signed up for a longer term and you decide to cancel.\n\nIf you are worried about losing out on money you have already paid to your existing provider, it is definitely worth asking them!\n\nThe best part is once you have purchased the hosting and selected the option that you already have a domain name, you can hop onto live chat with a representative and they will take care of the rest!\n\nMagnificent!\n\nNow this is where everyone agrees that SiteGround Web Hosting is top notch.\n\nWhere you might find yourself waiting upwards of 15-20 minutes for a response through online chat with other providers, SiteGround Web Hosting is known for answering you ASAP.\n\nI personally had that experience and was super surprised. It also made me feel even more confident in my decision to use them for my second blog.\n\nIf you want to see for yourself, why not open an online chat with them with a question before you buy?\n\nYou will be getting answers right from the source if you have any extra questions and it will give you the chance to test out their response time.\n\nI’ll be honest here, when I was starting out, I had straight up no idea what this was!\n\nThe fact that SiteGround Web Hosting offers this as part of their Startup package is amazing!\n\nEssentially an SSL is security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.\n\nThis ensures that all the data passed between the server and the browser remains private and protected.\n\nWhy does this matter to you?\n\nBecause you want to keep the information safe, such as your subscriber’s personal information or customer credit card information, while in transit from site to server.\n\nOkay, so now that I have totally convinced you that SiteGround Web Hosting is the way to go, have you clicked the link yet?\n\nIf not, maybe you have some questions…\n\nMaybe I can answer them? or…\n\nMaybe you need to test out my Customer Service Theory and head on over to SiteGround Web Hosting and ask them directly."
