        "text": "While SiteGround and Namecheap both provide great web hosting plans, they’re definitely suited for different types of website owners. Though somewhat interchangeable, we would recommend Namecheap more for beginners or those on a tighter budget. On the other hand, we like SiteGround for those that need premium hosting features, or website owners looking for more of a managed hosting package.\n\nNamecheap’s entry level or Value plan is one of the lowest priced quality hosting packages available—and it includes unlimited bandwidth and the ability to host 3 websites. Namecheap also has more elaborate, higher priced hosting plans. However, if you’re looking to step up from an entry level hosting plan, then SiteGround is a better choice in my opinion.\n\nSiteGround’s GrowBig and GoGeek hosting plans include their SuperCacher technology for faster website performance, CloudFlare CDN, daily website backup, and priority customer support. If you need WordPress hosting, you can also get automated updates. SiteGround’s performance and support have definitely been excellent for me. And, SiteGround continues to upgrade their infrastructure and expand their data center locations.\n\nWhile you get the cPanel interface with both SiteGround and Namecheap, Namecheap doesn’t include Webalizer as one of their web stat applications—not a big deal for beginners, but since I frequently use it to view my web stats, I prefer SiteGround’s cPanel. I also like the way SiteGround integrates cPanel with their account manager dashboard. SiteGround also gives you a 30 day money back guarantee period, whereas with Namecheap you only get 14 days.\n\nIn most cases, we would recommend going with SiteGround—especially for WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal users. With SiteGround, you can get premium features and support at lower prices than a lot of other web hosting companies.\n\nRecommendation\n\nFor most websites, in this comparison we would recommend SiteGround.
