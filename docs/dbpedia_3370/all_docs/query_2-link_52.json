Lewis, one of the oldest citizens of La Salle county, died at his residence in the town of Dayton on yesterday morning at six and a half o’clock. His age was sixty-nine years, and while not so old as many of our citizens as an old settler has a record of over forty-four years residence in this county, or the territory which is embraced by this county. He was a worthy man and one of the energetic pioneers who helped to develop the resources of the county and is entitled to that credit among others. He was an upright, honorable man and leaves numerous friends and the early settlers will mourn his loss with genuine sincerity.1\n\n1. The Ottawa [Illinois] Free Trader, October 10, 1874"
