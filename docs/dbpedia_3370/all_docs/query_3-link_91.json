        "text": "MARTINSBURG, W.Va. — Berkeley County (W.Va.) Schools’ request for about $700,000 from the West Virginia School Building Authority wasn’t included when funding decisions were made Monday in Charleston, W.Va.\n\nAt that time, the agency provided about $5 million in funding to projects across the state, including one for $950,000 for work at T.A. Lowery Elementary School in Shenandoah Junction, W.Va.\n\nElaine Bobo, Berkeley County Schools’ communications director, said the school district’s request was for window, floor and roofing upgrades at Winchester Avenue Elementary School in Martinsburg.\n\nThe total project cost was estimated to be about $900,000, but part of the money would have come from the district, she said.\n\nSchool district officials were told the project fared well in Charleston, but the funding process is “highly competitive, with limited funding,” she said.\n\nInterim Superintendent Harold “Chuck” Hatfield said at Monday night’s school board meeting that the project had been close to being approved since it was in the top 10 projects being considered for funding.\n\n“Berkeley County Schools has always had a strong, positive relationship with the School Building Authority. We appreciate their visit to review the project, and thank them for their consideration on this project and those in the future,” Bobo wrote in an email.\n\nBen Ashley, director of architectural services for the School Building Authority, said projects in seven counties were provided funding from the agency’s Major Improvement Project funds.\n\nThat money typically helps with large infrastructure issues such as electrical upgrades, he said.\n\n“We had a lot of requests this year, actually about $19 million, but with only about $5 million to give out, so we could only get to those that were in dire need,” he said in a telephone interview from his Charleston office.\n\n“Berkeley was very close, but we felt Jefferson was prioritized a little bit higher because of the reported mold issues they have, and the control repairs will fix that.”\n\nThe T.A. Lowery Elementary School proposal will replace heating, ventilation and air-conditioning controls. The total projected cost is about $1.2 million, with about $270,000 coming from local funds and the $950,000 in SBA funding, Ashley said.\n\n“We liked Berkeley’s project, and it was close to the line. We ranked it and gave it some consideration and left it open to the board if they wanted to go down below the line and prioritize it over something else. But ultimately, the board decided to go with staff recommendations,” he said.\n\nEach project is vetted by agency staff members who also make site visits as part of the evaluation process, Ashley said.\n\n“We wish we could do them all, but we do feel we addressed the most critical needs,” he said."
