[Notice that the land John BERKLEY buys here is also owned by John LORD, who was also the owner that originally owned the land sold by William BERKLEY. The book \"Historical Atlas of Westmoreland County\", shows a plot of land patented by John LORD and William HORTON, 1544 acres, on 17 April 1667. There's a note saying that the land was divided and John LORD took the western part, and HORTON the eastern. The northwest corner of the land borders MONTROSS, the present county seat. A note says land for the courthouse was donated by John LORD. There's another tract just south of Pope's Creek patented by John LORD on 29 Sept., 1667, of 1667 acres. The land that John BERKLEY bought in King George Co. was on a road called Maddox. Mattox Creek flows from presently eastern King George Co. northeastward into Westmoreland Co., and into the Potomac. So there is a possible link between John BERKLEY and the William BERKLEY who died in Fairfax Co. in 1762...
