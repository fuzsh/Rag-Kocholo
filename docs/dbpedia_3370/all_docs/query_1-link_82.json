Co., VA. on South Fork of Holston River.\n\nNotes for WILLIAM LEWIS: Settled in Virginia in early 1700s??\n\n\"Families of Washington County & Bristol, Virginia 1776-199l_\" by Holston Territory Genealogy Society.\n\nWilliam LEWIS owned land in Fincastle County (now Washington Co.)\n\nbought 9 March 1774 176 acres on the south fork of the Holston River\n\n\"Will Book 1777-1792 of Washington County, Virginia\" (abstracts only)\n\np. 102: Inventory & Appraisement of the Estate of William Lewis, deceased, by John THOMAS and Henry HENNIS, Appraisers.\n\nOne bond against son William Lewis and one bond against John Lewis.\n\n100 bushels of corn due in the years 1785, 1786, 1787, 1788 and 1789.\n\nRecorded (dates not given) [prob. 1784]\n\nWill of William Lewis, dated 16 November 1784\n\nSons: Griffeth (eldest), William, John & Thomas Lewis\n\nDau's: Ann Stevens and Margaret Bishop\n\nWit: John ROBINSON & John THOMAS\n\n\"I sign this as my Last will\"\n\nWilliam Lewis (his mark)\n\n16 Nov. 1784 \". . . appoint Griffeth Lewis & Abraham Stevens, executors.\n\nWit: same William Lewis (his mark)\n\nProven and recorded 21 December 1784 John Campbell, CWC\n\n281L94 - WILLIAM LEWIS (Additional Info from Dr. Cohen Lewis):\n\nWilliam Lewis was living in southwest Virginia on the South Fork of the Holston River when this area was a part of Fincastle County. The date of his settlement has not been found nor the date when he became a landowner.\n\nFrom the original surveys in Fincastle County Record of Plotts, Book A:\n\np. 23 - surveyed for Wm Lewis by virtue of the Order of Council made 16 Dec 1773, and as part\n\nof the Loyal Company Grant, the annexed figure of land lying in Fincastle Co. on the South fork\n\nof Holston, containing 176 acres and bounded as follows...adjoining John Thomas and Henry\n\nBowen.\n\nSurveyed 9 March 1774 (on same date for Henry Bowen, 426 acres, part of Loyal Co. Grant,\n\nSouth Fork of Holston and for John Thomas, 404 acres, part of Loyal Co. Grant, South Fork\n\nof Holston, both tracts \"corner to Wm Lewis\".\n\np. 198 - surveyed for Wm Lewis - part of Loyal Company Grant - lying in Fincastle County -\n\nsouthwest side of South Fork of Holston - containing 204 acres - beginning Bank of Two-mile\n\nCreek - surveyed 16 May 1775.\n\nThe Holston River was formerly called Indian River, and settlers were in this area long before the above surveys were made. When Fincastle County was discontinued late in 1775, this section became Washington County; and I (Dr. Lewis) believe the area where Wm Lewis lived was later set off to Smyth County. Since no deeds disposing of the above land have been found, no patent was ever issued to Wm Lewis, and no land was mentioned in his will, it is the opinion of the Virginia State Library that he assigned it to someone else, in which case the patent would be recorded under the assignee's name. The assignment made by Griffith Lewis, the oldest son of William, was located through a manuscript called \"List of Loyal Company Platts, Certificates, an d Surveys, 1799-1815\"; but the column in which the recordation was to be entered was blank for both of the William Lewis surveys, nor was there any notation of recordation on either of the original surveys.\n\nI have found no records of Wm Lewis prior to 1774, nor have I been able to \"connect\" him with any other Lewis family in Virginia. He was surely born before 1730 (probably by 1720) and although tradition says this family came from Wales, there is no documented evidence. At present, I have at least 6 claims and suggestions (none of them proved) and I do not feel that copying these would merit the space that would be consumed.... Most of the claims have been disproved.\n\nWilliam Lewis and his sons seemed to have few records in Washington County until 20 July 1779 when they appeared in Court and acknowledge d themselves indebted to the Commonwealth of Virginia, by bonds which would become void if conditions set out were followed.\n\n--John Lewis, for 500 pounds - good behavior for one year;\n\nsecurities, William Lewis and John Campbell, 250 pounds each.\n\n--Griffith Lewis, for 500 pounds - appearance at next court;\n\nsecurities Wm Lewis and John Lewis, 250 pounds each.\n\n--Peter Razor, 1000 pounds; securities, Wm Lewis and Griffith Lewis, 500 pounds each.\n\n--Thomas Lewis - for a misdemeanor, ordered to pay 10 pounds and costs.\n\nThese records probably concerned activities of those in Southwest Virginia who were loyal to Great Britain, of which there were a great many at this time. Since Thomas Lewis had served for the American Colonies off and on since June 1776, his involvement was probably very slight, if any.\n\nOn 22 November 1780, William Lewis served on a jury in the Court of Washington County. A lawsuit, William Lewis against William Paine, was on the docket of this session of court.\n\nPapers of Elmyra (McGuire) Royse <Mrs. Dayton Royse> -- found March 1999 posted on the internet: <http://www.geocities.com/~daisi>\n\n1774 - had land survey on South Fork of Holston River, s.w. Virginia\n\n1775 - William & Griffith Lewis -- land surveys same area\n\n1784 - William Lewis died in Washington Co., VA; named in his will were his children: Griffith, Mragaret, Ann, Wm Jr, John & Thomas\n\nSince many who settled on South Fork of Holston had the same names as earlier residents of Loudoun Co., VA, I am interested in that area . A William LEWIS and a William LEWIS, Jr., appeared on the tax lists of Loudoun Co. in 1766; in that same vicinity were John and William GRIFFITH; William, James & Joshua JONES; Benjamin and Thomas JOHN ; John THOMAS; and other \"interesting names\".\n\nThe 1771 will of William JONES of Loudoun Co. named wife Mary, devised land to sons Joshua and James adjoining the DEHAVEN's and a negro to daughter Mary GRIFFITH, and mentioned the Baptist Meeting House adjoining his plantation of which Joseph THOMAS was minister and William LEWIS and Thomas GEORGE were elders. The will was witnessed by Josias CLAPHAM, William LEWIS, and Sarah GRIFFITH. (This was probably New Valley in Pennsylvania; the members included emigrants from Pennsylvania and converts in Virginia.)\n\nOn 9 March 1774 in southwest Virginia \"our\" William LEWIS and a John THOMAS had adjoining tracts surveyed; on 15 May 1775 \"our\" Griffith LEWIS and a Joshua JONES had tracts surveyed - corner to each other . These were part of the Loyal Company Grant and was located on South Fork of Holston.\n\nIn 1782, John THOMAS, Thomas JOHN, and Benjamin JOHN were taxed in same district in Washington Co., VA as were \"our\" William LEWIS and his sons; in 1784 John THOMAS witnessed the will of William LEWIS.\n\nOn 21 September 1798, Benjamin JOHN and wife Lydia, Washington Co., V A deeded to Thomas PIERCE of Wythe Co., VA, an iron ore bank on South Fork of Holston; in a law suit of 1807 - Pierce vs. Razor - it was stated that the iron works had been owned by Joshua JONES, Peter RAZOR and Benjamin JOHN.\n\nThese notes are presented as a possible clue to the earlier residence of William LEWIS and his family; they are not to be considered as proof.\n\nChildren of WILLIAM LEWIS are:\n\n2. i.

Gardner HOPKINS is buried in a cemetery 1 1/2 miles north o f West Liberty on KY 7. Thomas LEWIS' son acquired land across the river from the mouth of Elkfork, and at one time Francis LEWIS' son , John P. LEWIS was the largest land owner in Morgan County. A portion of the Thomas LEWIS tract has remained in the LEWIS family to this day. It presently (1972) belongs to Mrs. Dima LEWIS, widow of Green LEWIS who was a grandson of Henry H. LEWIS, Thomas LEWIS' youngest son. It was on this farm, on the present site of the Dima LEWIS home that Thomas LEWIS built the big log house which family tradition claimed was the first log house built in what is now Morgan County. The house stood until about 30-40 years ago when it was destroyed by fire.\n\nFloyd County, Kentucky COUNTY COURT BOOK 1\n\nAugust Court: Aug. 28, 1809: On the motion of James LACY, ordered that David ELLINGTON, James ELLIOTT, Thomas LEWIS, and William HOPKINS mark a road from the mouth of Elk Fork to David ELLINGTON's and report at the next court.\n\nNovember 28, 1809: On the order of James LACY, ordered that William MONTGOMERY, Ambrose JONES, William McCLINTICK and Thomas CASKEY to mark the road from Thomas LEWIS to Jeremiah LYKINS.\n\nFebruary Term 1810: Ordered that a deed from Henry FRENCH to Thomas CASKEY, Gardner HOPKINS and Thomas LEWIS be recorded.\n\nMay Term 1810; Monday, May 28th: Order issued to review the road from Thomas LEWIS to Jeremiah LYCAN's.\n\nJanuary Term 1811: Report of the road from Thomas LEWIS to Jeremiah LYCANs received.

Abraham appeared on Washington Co. tax book of 1785. A patent was issued 15 March 1788 to a Benjamin STEPHENS for 1,000 acres on south side of S. Fork of Holston (VA Patents, Bk. 15, p. 541).\n\nIn Madison Co., KY a Jehu STEVENS was taxed 1787 & 1788; he may be the Jehu STEVENS who signed 8 Sept. 1783 in Lincoln Co. KY, bond for h is marriage to Sarah YOCUM; security, George CORN; consent for the license, Matthias YOCUM - relationship not stated. This is published as John STEVENS, but quite plainly \"Jehu\" on the original. Published Lincoln Co. Court Orders name a John STEPHENS in August 1783 which the original shows as Jehu STEPHENS.\n\nIn Lincoln Co., 11 Feb 1788, a marriage bond was obtained for John LEWIS & Hannah STEPHENS; security, Francis HOPKINS. On 9 Feb Abraham (A-his mark) STEPHENS certified \"that Hannah is over 21 years\", no relationship stated.

At the same time it was stated that Thomas LEWIS and Abraham had previously made a joint purchase of 169 acres. (Garrard Deeds A:45 & A:49) On 4 Nov. 1799, Abraham STEPHENS and wife Ann of Garrard Co. sold this 47 1/2 acres to Jacob BACK (A:255) and moved to Shelby Co., KY, where Abraham was taxed 1800 through 1815, which is as far as I have checked; his 1815 tax was for 3 horses, 4 blacks, and 111 acres on Long Run.\n\nThere was another Abraham STEVENS in Lincoln Co. who was married there in 1784 and bought land in 1797 which he and his wife Susannah of Pulaski Co., KY sold in 1798.\n\nNotes for ABRAHAM STEVENS/STEPHENS: Abraham Stevens was executor of her father's will, and appeared on the Washington County Tax Book of 1785.

Both tracts were part of Loyal Company Grant in Fincastle Co., later Washington Co., where Joseph, Levi and Jonathan BISHOP were taxed in 1782. Jonathan had surveys of 150 a. 1781 & 1782; he patented 12 July 1785, 150 a. S. Fork Holston adjoining Isaac ANDERSON, Joseph BISHOP, and Robert CAMPBELL.\n\nOn 20 June 1792 Joseph COLE sold about one acre on north side of S.

Griffith was probably born prior t o 1750 and died between 25 June and 28 August 1806 in Lee Co., VA.\n\nThe earliest reference to Griffith which I have found is the following survey: For Griffith Lewis...192 acres in Fincastle Co., VA part of Loyal Company's Grant...lying on both side of the Two-mile Creek , a branch of the South Fork of Holston River...adjoining JONES' land . Surveyed 15 May 1775. (Fincastle Co., Record of Plotts, Book A, p .196)\n\nOn the same day, 273 acres were surveyed on both sides of One-mile Creek for Joshua JONES; and on the next day, land was surveyed for William LEWIS on Two-mile Creek as previously noted.\n\nGriffith LEWIS assigned his land before a patent had been issued; an abstract of the patent recorded in Virginia Land Grants, Vol. 38, p ages 116-117, follows: James WOOD, Esq., Gov. of the Commonwealth o f VA., ...in consideration of 20 shillings sterling* paid into the treasury...to Peter MINK, Assignee of Griffith LEWIS...192 acres surveyed 15 May 1775...lying in Washington Co. on both sides of the two-mile creek, a branch of South Fork of the Holstein River, and bounded... corner to JONES' land...and being part of an Order of Council granted to the Loyal Company to take up and survey 800,000 acres, established and confirmed by a decree of Court of Appeals made in Richmond 2 May 1783...Signed at Richmond, 19 March 1798, by James WOODS.\n\nGriffith LEWIS was taxed in Washington Co., VA 1782, 1783 & 1785; lists for years immediately following are missing. Although it is quite possible that there was an earlier marriage, he was probably the Griffey LEWIS married by Nicholas REAGAN in Washington Co. to Mary BROWN - undated. (VA Colonial Abstracts, Vol. 34, Washington Co.

VA was taxed there 1782, 1783, and 1785; lists for the years immediately following are missing.\n\nIn Lincoln Co. KY 11 Feb. 1788, a bond was signed by John LEWIS and Francis HOPKINS {Jr.} for \"a marriage shortly intended between the above bound John LEWIS and Hannah STEPHENS\". Abraham (A-his mark ) STEPHENS certified 9 Feb. that Hannah was over 21; but did not state any relationship. Francis HOPKINS, taxed Washington Co. VA 1783, was brother of Hannah HOPKINS who married in 1784 Thomas LEWIS, brother of John. John LEWIS and Thomas LEWIS were taxed 22 April 1789 in Madison Co. KY.\n\nIn January 1791 Madison Co. Court ordered John LEWIS, William COOLEY , Clemmons HILL, and Abraham STEPHENS to view a road from Fredergil ADAMS' mill to Lincoln Co. line to intersect the Hickman and Sugar Creek roads. John LEWIS was taxed here through 1796 when he listed 35 acres on Sugar Creek.\n\nIn 1797 this area was set off to form a part of Garrard Co. 13 August 1797, Thomas LEWIS and wife Hannah, Montgomery Co. KY conveyed to John LEWIS of Garrard Co. for 50 pounds 32 1/2 acres in Garrard Co . on Sugar Creek; recorded Sept. 1798. John LEWIS was taxed in Garrard Co. 1797 through 1802 and called John LEWIS of Sugar Creek to distinguish him from John LEWIS of Canoe Creek.\n\nIn 1803 John LEWIS was taxed in Mercer Co. KY; and on 11 Oct. 1805 John LEWIS and wife Hannah of Mercer Co. deeded to John HUTCHERSON of Garrard Co. for $300, 35 acres in Garrard on Sugar Creek. Both signed their names; deed was acknowledged in Garrard Co. Court and Hannah released her dower rights.\n\nMercer Co. tax book in 1806 listed one male, 16-21, with John LEWIS and in 1807 two males, 16-21, with him. In 1811 and 1813, John LEWIS Sr., John LEWIS Jr., and Thomas LEWIS were listed consecutively, all then above 21. I did not find John LEWIS Sr. after 1815. It is said that John and Hannah (STEPHENS) LEWIS had at least 7 children, but no list of them has been found.\n\nChildren of JOHN LEWIS and HANNAH STEPHENS are:\n\ni. JOHN JR.3 LEWIS, b.

I beleive it is even more worthy of note that there are still among us today descendants of these same great and brave men.\n\nWhile doubtless a better account of the Thomas Lewis family could be written by a more capable hand, the following collection of names and facts is contributed in an attempt to help trace and preserve its history for future generations. It is not contributed in an egotistical way as a means of only drawing attention to our \"clan\", but more in the old traditional Morgan County manner of gladly offering what we have. And it is submitted with the hope that these facts, limited by space and time, will be a convenient and helpful aid to other interested descendants and genealogists delving into the family's history. It is also hoped that it will serve as a spur to a fuller, more accurate, and satisfying investigation of family history, which is a part of the history of Morgan County.\n\nThere are so many Thomas Lewises in Kentucky and Virginia that in compiling family history it is very easy to get confused and misled. Both the pension application of Thomas Lewis and his wife (from Revolutionary War File W-9124, Washington, D.C.) distinguished him from other Thomas Lewises who have come from Virginia to Kentucky.\n\nThe Lewises of Morgan County, descendants of Revolutionary War Soldier, Thomas Lewis, have a large ancestry connection with the other first families of the county. Most of these families, especially those of Thomas Caskey, Gardner Hopkins, John Perry, Edmund Wells, Arch Day. John Nickell, John Day, William Wells, Thomas Lewis, James S. Elliott, and Peter Amyx--through marriage are so interrelated that it is impossible to write the story of one of these families without including the others. Ernest P. Lewis of Morgan County traces lineage through three sons of Thomas Lewis and his wife Hannah Hopkins, Francis H. Lewis, William M. Lewis and Gardner Hopkins Lewis lines, and a great-great-great-grandson through the William M. Lewis line.\n\nGardner Hopkins, also a Revolutionary War veteran, and Thomas Lewis were brothers-in-law. (Besides this being common \"handed-down\" family knowledge, we have Hannah's statement that she was Gardner's sister in a deposition made for Polly Hopkins when she filed for a widow pension.)\n\nThomas Caskey, whose daughter Ellen or Ellender, married Thomas Lewis' son Francis, was also the son-in-law of Gardner Hopkins. In a deposition in Gardner Hopkins's Revolutionary file, Thomas Caskey deposed that he became intimately acquainted with Gardner Hopkins and his family of Orange County, New York, in 1788 and that he and Gardner's daughter Lydia were married 19 Dec., 1790 \"in the same room of the same house where her parents were married\".\n\nFrom the accompanying copy of this application for a pension (Revolutionary War File W-9124) we know that Morgan County's Thomas Lewis was living in Washington Co., Virginia when he was drafted in 1776 at Abingdon...and that he settled in Kentucky on the Dix River in 1782. (Part of the time he served as a spy or scout under Capt. A. Bowan, fought the Indians, and took part in the expedition led by George Rogers Clark.) From Hannah's pension application we know that he returned to Washington County, Virginia and married Hannah Hopkins, then a resident of that county, on the third day of March, 1784...and that they were married by the Baptist preacher, Thomas Woolsey. Census records show that they were living in Kentucky when their oldest child, Francis H. Lewis was born on March 3, 1786.\n\nIn Colonel Hazelrigg's address given at West Liberty July 4, 1876 in which he attempted to trace Morgan County's first half-century he stated, \"It is an authentic fact that Thomas Caskey, Gardner Hopkins, Thomas Lewis, John Perry, John Nickell, John Day, Wm. Wells, Arch Day, Edmund Wells, John Lacy and Daniel Williams located here and made permanent improvements early as 1800, some of them perhaps before that time\".\n\nWilliam Lewis, second son of Thomas, was living at the time Colonel Hazelrigg made this speech and is a logical possibility that he could have been one of the sources consulted for some of the county's early history, because Colonel Hazelrigg further states, \"All of the parties who participated in the organization of the county have gone to their reward except Edmund Vest and William Lewis. William Lewis is in his 90th year, and quite feeble in body yet his mind is rich in memories of incidents connected with the early settlement of the county.\"\n\nAccording to family tradition and some census records, the older members of Thomas Lewis' family who were born before 1800, were born in the Dix River area and Montgomery County. It had always been family tradition that Gardner Hopkins Lewis, born November 8, 1801, was the first child of Thomas and Hannah to be born in what is now Morgan County. To the dissappointment of my relatives interested in documenting family genealogies my only record of this is that older members of the family said he said this. I am more positive, however of where he died. My aunt Cora Gardner Lewis often remarks that she was born exactly 100 years after Gardner Hopkins Lewis I, \"in the same room in the same house in which he died\". He died in the childhood home of my father, the home of my grand-father, Gardner H. Lewis II, a grandson of Gardner H. Lewis I, in December, 1887. His wife was \"Polly\" Amyx Lewis.\n\nWe know that Thomas Lewis, together with Gardner Hopkins, his brother-in-law, and Thomas Caskey purchased 1100 acres of land on the Licking River at the mouth of Elkfork Creek, as shown by early land records in the court house at Prestonsburg, KY. (deed book A-54). This portion of Morgan County at that time was included in Floyd County. They are all listed as residents of Floyd County at that time. This land was purchased from Henry French of Mercer County, KY, and the deed was witnessed by John Perry, James S. Elliott and William Hopkins. (All records for that part of Morgan County which was in Floyd between 1799 and 1808 burned with the Floyd County courthouse in 1808, so if Thomas Lewis had been living here earlier we have no record.)\n\nThe Thomas Lewis tract included 500 acres on the north side of the Licking River at the mouth of Elkfork Creek, and the Hopkins and Caskey tract was between West Liberty and the mouth of the Elkfork. Gardner Hopkins is buried in a cemetery 1 1/2 miles north of West Liberty on KY 7. Thomas Lewis' son acquired land across the river from the mouth of Elkfork, and at one time Francis Lewis' son, John P. Lewis was the largest land owner in Morgan County. A portion of the Thomas Lewis tract has remained in the Lewis family to this day. It presently (1972) belongs to Mrs. Dima Lewis, widow of Green Lewis who was a grandson of Henry H. Lewis, Thomas Lewis' youngest son. It was on this farm, on the present site of the Dima Lewis home that Thomas Lewis built the big log house which family tradition claimed was the first log house built in what is now Morgan County. The house stood until about 30-40 years ago when it was destroyed by fire.\n\nFrancis H. Lewis oldest son of Thomas Lewis helped organize Morgan County and was the first Tax Commissioner. He married John Perry's daughter Eleanor. His second wife was Ellender, daughter of Thomas Caskey.\n\nWilliam M. Lewis was appointed by Gov. Adair as one of the first Justices of the peace in Morgan County. He married Jane, daughter of John Perry. William Henry Harrison Lewis son of William M. Lewis was a Union volunteer in Co. A, 54th Reg. of Ky. Inf. during the civil war. He married Elizabeth Henry daughter of \"Big\" Lewis Henry and Annie Allan Henry of Caney area of Morgan County. William H. Lewis son of William Henry Harrison Lewis (Red Head Bill) was a Justice of the peace in the Yocum and Blaze area and raised the first tobacco for commercial use in the county. He was also the first person to make tobacco hogshead in Morgan County.\n\nIf you have corrections or additions and would like to share them please contact:\n\nDr. Helen Price Stacy\n\n555 Prestonsburg Street\n\nWest Libery, KY 41472-1141\n\nWilliam Lewis, Sr., who died Washington County, Virginia in 1784\n\nThe following information is credited to Elmyra Royse (Mrs. Dayton Royse) nee Elmyra McGuire. The papers of Mrs. Royse were donated to the Oklahoma Genealogical Society by her son after her death. We of the Lewis and Hopkins families greatly appreciate all her efforts and many years of research, which included these families.\n\nI would also like to thank Laura Flebbe of Tulsa, OK for many hours spent copying and then forwarding these papers. I have spent many months reading and sorting and have come to realize the amount of work over many years that went into them.\n\nhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~holland/wmlewis.htm\n\nDaisi Grossman <daisi@att.net> Home Page: Holland Family Connections\n\nWilliam Lewis (first generation found - wife's name not known)-\n\n1774, had land survey on S. Fork of Holston R., S.W. Virginia;\n\n1775, William & Griffith Lewis - land surveys same area;\n\n1784, William Lewis died in Washington Co., VA; named in his will:\n\n1. Griffith, eldest son, of Washington and Lee County, Virginia; wife in 1806 was Mary (Brown?). 2. Margaret, born about 1743, married Jonathan Bishop; lived in Washington County, Virginia in present Smyth County area. 3. Ann, married by 1784 Abraham Stevens (Stephens); moved to Kentucky 4. William Jr., taxed at least 1782 through 1785 in Washington County, Virginia; no furthur records for William Jr. 5. John, born before 1761, married Hannah Stephens in Kentucky. 6. Thomas, born 5 March 1755, married Hannah Hopkins; moved to Kentucky; died 1849 in Morgan County, Kentucky.\n\n********************\n\nSince many who settled on South Fork of Holston had the same names as earlier residents of Loudoun County, Virginia, I am interested in that area. A William Lewis and a William Lewis, Jr., appeared on the tax lists of Loudoun County in 1766; in that same vicinity were John and William Griffith; William, James, and Joshua Jones; Benjamin and Thomas John; John Thomas; and other \"interesting names.\"\n\nThe 1771 will of William Jones of Loudoun County named wife Mary, devised land to sons Joshua and James adjoining the Dehaven's and a negro to daughter Mary Griffith, and mentioned the Baptist Meeting House adjoining his plantation of which Joseph Thomas was minister and William Lewis and Thomas George were elders. The will was witnessed by Josias Clapham, William Lewis, and Sarah Griffith. (This was probably New Valley in Pennsylvania; the members included emigrants from Pennsylvania and converts in Virginia.)\n\nOn 9 March 1774 in Southwest Virginia \"our\" William Lewis and a John Thomas had adjoining tracts surveyed; on May 15, 1775, \"our\" Griffith Lewis and a Joshua Jones had tracts surveyed - corner to each other. These were part of the Loyal Company Grant and was located on South Fork of Holston. In 1782, John Thomas, Thomas John, and Benjamin John were taxed in same district in Washington County, Virginia as were \"our\" William Lewis and his sons; in 1784 John Thomas witnessed the will of William Lewis.\n\nOn September 21, 1798, Benjamin John and wife Lydia, Washington County, Virginia deeded to Thomas Pierce of Wythe County, Virginia, an iron ore bank on South Fork of Holston; in a law suit of 1807 - Pierce vs. Razor - it was stated that the iron works had been owned by Joshua Jones, Peter Razor, and Benjamin John.\n\nThese notes are presented as a possible clue to the earlier residence of William Lewis and his family; they are not to be considered as proof."
