        "text": "January 3, 1949 – July 11, 2018\n\nA life well lived, William (Howard) Lewis, a personal friend of Jesus Christ, was born January 3, 1949.\n\nHe was the first baby born in the year of 1949 in Arlington, WA to Florence Priestley and Cedric Howard Lewis. Howard grew up in Darrington and spent his summers on San Juan Island at the family log cabin. There he became an avid boater – enjoying fishing, cruising and sailboat racing. His family moved to Snohomish and he graduated from Snohomish High School in 1968. Howard married his high school sweetheart, Mary Butt, in 1969. They enjoyed many wonderful years together raising two children, Heather born in 1974 and Kevin born in 1976.\n\nAs early as 1963 Howard had dreams of working in the automotive industry. He worked for Chaplain Enterprises and Bickford Motors before opening his own repair center, L&B Auto in 1981. He and Mary also launched Angel Transport & Towing in 2000. Through the two businesses they served the Snohomish community for 33 years.\n\nHoward gave many volunteer hours to the Automotive Service Association (ASA) of Washington, mentoring and leading new repair shop owners to successful business careers. He held many leadership positions at the local level before being elected by his peers to serve on the National Board of ASA, rising to the position of Chairman in 2000.\n\nHoward became a chaplain for the Snohomish Fire District 4 in 2007 and counseled many families and individuals through difficult times. People sensed his personal friendship with Jesus and found comfort in his words and advice. In addition, Howard found time to serve with the Billy Graham Ministries Rapid Response Team providing solace and comfort to families enduring natural disasters in all areas of the country.\n\nHoward had a passion for service. He was an active member of the Kiwanis Club of Snohomish for 26 years, a board member at CrossView Church, and previously served on the boards of the Kiwanis Club, Friday Harbor Sailing Club, Snohomish Senior Center, and Faith Assembly Church.\n\nIn 2013, Howard married Linda Leonard and they spent five wonderful years enjoying adventures with their extended family and friends. He retired in 2015, allowing more time for sailing in the San Juan and Gulf Islands and cruising to Desolation Sound and beyond.\n\nHoward was preceded in death by his brother Richard, his parents, and his wife of 42 years,\n\nMary. He is survived by his wife Linda; his daughter Heather Dolan (Jeff); his son Kevin Lewis (Amy); his stepson Nate Kraft (Eva); his stepdaughter Anjeannette Hammer (Aaron); his nine grandchildren Isaac, Gwyneth & Connor Lewis, Penny Dolan, Kyler, Ruthie & Sarah Hammer, and Madeleine & Miles Kraft; his brother Hugh Lewis (Dawn); his sisters Athlene Schneider (Sidney), Marian Jones (Warren), Joan Mann (Lyle).\n\nHoward will be remembered as a wonderful, dedicated Christian, husband, father, grandfather, and friend who always had a good story to tell. He was full of mischief, laughter and love. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him."
