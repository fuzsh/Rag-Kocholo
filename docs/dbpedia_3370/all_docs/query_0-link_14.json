He received a B.A. from St. Edmund Hall, Oxford 10 July 1624, and a M.A. from Merton College 10 July 1629, and was a fellow there 1625-1646.[7] He entered the Middle Temple in 1627 before touring the continent.[2]\n\nWilliam was known in London as a playwright of merit. In 1632, he gained an appointment to the privy chamber of King Charles I. That position gave him entrée into a court literary circle known as \"The Wits\". Berkeley wrote several plays including one performed before the King & Queen: The Lost Lady, A Tragi-Comedy (1638).[2]\n\nWilliam was knighted by King Charles I at Berwick-upon-Tweed[3] on 12 July 1639,[7] after having served the king in the first and second Bishops' Wars (1639-40).[1]\n\nLife in Virginia\n\nSir William Berkeley purchased the office of governor Virginia from the incumbent, Sir Francis Wyatt and, on 9 August 1641, Charles I named William as governor and captain general of Virginia.[1] He arrived in Jamestowne in February 1642.[8] In 1643 he acquired land 5 miles west of the city, where he built Green Spring House and conducted agricultural trials.[1] He built his own home of brick, and encouraged others to follow his example. To encourage diversification of crops and reduce the colony's reliance on tobacco as its chief export, William cultivated flax, cotton, and rice on his lands and also experimented with silk production.[3] William also spent considerable time in real estate development and advancing trade with local Native Americans.[2]\n\nThe colony was attacked by Indian forces under Opechancanough in April of 1644, spurring the Third Anglo-Indian War (1644-1646). William Berkeley and Necotowance, Opechancanough's successor, signed the peace treaty that ended the war in October 1646. That treaty established reservations for the Indians who had been a part of Powhatan's chiefdom and required Necotowance and his successors to pay a yearly tribute to the governor.[6]\n\nBerkeley was a fervent royalist and fostered a safe haven for supporters during and after the English Civil Wars (1642-1651). He encouraged the Cavaliers to come over in large numbers and also gave asylum to persecuted English clergy. After Charles II was exiled, Parliament called upon him to submit to the Commonwealth, but he refused[3] and armed forces were sent to the Colony. On 12 March 1652, William peacefully surrendered his government to Cromwell's pro-Parliament forces, but under terms that left Virginia's political and social establishment intact.[2] On 30 April 1652 Richard Bennett became acting governor under the Commwealth of Cromwell.[8] William left Jamestowne and retired to his plantation.[2]\n\nWith the Restoration of Charles II in 1659/60, and the sudden death of Virginia Governor Samuel Mathews in January 1660, William was reinstated as governor[2] on 23 March 1660 (commissioned by Charles II on 31 July 1660).[8] He returned to England in 1661 to persuade Charles II to back him financially, lobbying for almost a year and writing his Discourse and View of Virginia, which outlined his ideas for improving the colony and implementing free trade. Although William gained Charles II's approval of agricultural diversification and consideration of limiting tobacco production, Charles II offered no financial support and rejected William's appeal for free trade. William returned to Virginia in September 1662.[2]\n\nOn 24 March 1662/3 Charles II granted letters patent to William and seven others that created them as the \"true and Absolute Lord and Proprietaries\" of Carolina, making William the greatest landowner in Virginia. The other grantees, all living in England, agreed that William would colonize and establish a government for that land. William chose William Drummond to be the first Governor and his appointment was confirmed 3 December 1664. Disagreement arose between the two men and Drummond was relieved of his post. Later, their quarrel would turn deadly when Drummond sided with Nathaniel Bacon.[9]\n\nAlthough William's early years as governor were very successful, during his 1660-1677 tenure, he had several significant failures. He was unable to diversify the colony's dependence on tobacco as there were few who would follow him and the idea was abandoned in the late 1660's. The colony lost trade with the Dutch during the wars with the Netherlands and the closure of foreign markets affected tobacco prices. Peaceful relations with Native Americans deteriorated, proprietary land grants were revived, and William was slow to punish the misrule of some of his \"favorites\". Although William's leadership was questioned, it wasn't challenged directly until after a July 1675 attack by Indians on an outlying plantation which set off a series of events that incited the frontier colonists.[2]\n\nIn spring of 1676 Nathaniel Bacon challenged Berkeley directly by taking command of a force of volunteer Indian fighters, going against the governor's direct command.[2] On 30 July 1676, Bacon and his army issued the \"Declaration of the People\" which criticized Berkeley's administration in detail and accused the governor of corruption. On 19 September 1676, Bacon's forces burned Jamestown to the ground.[10]\n\nBacon died of dysentery in October 1676 and, soon after, Berkeley regained control of the region. Several of the rebel leaders were hanged and rebel lands were seized without trial.[10] One of the executed rebel leaders was former Carolina governor Nathaniel Drummond.[9] The king had sent troops to Virginia to put down the rebellion, along with a commission to investigate the uprising. Although Bacon's Rebellion had ended before the English forces arrived, one of the commissioners, Col. Herbert Jeffreys, brought with him an order that appointed Jeffreys as \"governor of Virginia in the place of Sir William Berkeley\".[2] The order was dated 9 October 1676,[11] however, Berkeley resisted and Jeffreys didn't take office until 27 April 1677.[8]\n\nWilliam Berkeley, old and in poor health, returned to England in May 1677 with the desire to explain himself to Charles II and clear his name. He did not have the opportunity to do so, as William died on 9 July 1677, before being able to address the crown.[2]\n\nMarriages\n\nWilliam was married in Virginia by 1650 to his first wife (name Unknown).[2]\n\nIn Virginia he married his second wife, Frances Culpeper, about 21 June 1670.[4] Frances was the widow of [Capt.] Samuel Stephens, and daughter of Thomas Culpeper of Hollingbourne, Kent, by Katherine, daughter of Sir Warham St Leger. They had no issue.[3][4] Frances was a trusted political advisor to William[6] and he sent her to London during the Bacon Rebellion in 1676 to defend his administration.[1]\n\nDeath\n\nSir William Berkeley died 9 July 1677, and was buried at Twickenham, Middlesex,[3][4] at St. Mary the Virgin, on 13 July 1677.[2] He shares a memorial and a vault with his brother, Lord John Berkeley of Stratton, the inscription as follows:\n\nIn the same vault with the Lord Berkeley lies buried the body of\n\nSir WILLIAM BERKELEY, knt.\n\nWho being constituted governor general in Virginia in 1660, after the death of Colonel Mathews,\n\nwrote a description of that country, and collected the laws then in force\n\ninto one body, and added most of the best himself,\n\nwhich he procured to be confirmed by the Grand Assembly anno 1661.\n\nHe died July 13, 1677\n\nAnd was at first buried in the middle chancel, and removed into the vault 1678.[12]\n\nWilliam left a will dated 2 May 1676, proved 22 November 1678 in Virginia. He named his wife, Frances, as his sole executor and heir to all his lands and properties. He left bequests to his sister Mrs. Jane Davies and friend Mrs. Sarah Kirkman, and noted that the children of his brother, the Lord Berkeley, \"have noe want of what little I can dispose of, and to the rest of my kindred (all but my dear sister Davies) I am farr from haveing any obligation to\"[13] A son of one of his nephews in England unsuccessfully attempted to challenge the bequest of Carolina lands, claiming that it was due to him as William's nearest blood relative.[9]\n\nHis widow, Frances, married third about 1680, as his second wife, [Gov.] Philip Ludwell, of James City County, Virginia, member of the Council, deputy Secretary of State of Virginia, Governor of both North Carolina and South Carolina. They had no issue. Frances was living in July 1690.[3][4]\n\nLegacy\n\nBerkeley County, South Carolina is named in his honor.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nMarriages\n\nRichardson mentions no first wife or children in RA III:577, but in RA II:371 he says Frances was William's 2nd wife.\n\nChildren\n\nRichardson, Billings and ODNB list no children and none are named in his will.
