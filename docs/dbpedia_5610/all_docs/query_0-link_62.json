Additional venues this year include the Queens Public Library at Forest Hills, and Yant Tattoo Studios – the Official Filmmaker Lounge. This year the festival expands its programming with special presentations at the Queens Center Mall in Rego Park. The festival opens with Ivy Vale’s coming of age musical Out of My Comfort Zone and closes with the world premiere of Delfine Paolini’s A Wonderful Way with Dragons.\n\nAdditional world premieres among the feature film lineup include Laura Angiulli’s I Know You, Harrison Dillingham’s Mortimer, and Charles Caracciolo’s The Old Ballgame: The QBH Story.

The reception will take place at Yant Tattoo Studios in Forest Hills, the official filmmaker lounge for the 2024 festival. Artwork will be on display for the entirety of the event from August 2 - 11\n\nAlong with its presentation of more than 100 screenings, and FOC NYC’s popular Red Carpet entrances flush with seemingly countless filmmakers, actors, documentary subjects, and below-the-line talent, the film festival’s footprint will expand beyond the Regal UA Midway, by adding additional programming, that is free and open to the public, at the Queens Library of Forest Hills, Yant Tattoo Studios, and Queens Center Mall. The jam-packed week and a half of screenings and events will conclude with an Awards Ceremony on August 11th at the Jamaica Performing Arts Center in Jamaica Queens.\n\nFestival of Cinema NYC Founder and Executive Director Jayson Simba, said, “This year’s edition of the film festival continues the growth of our event. Our mission to establish a bridge between community and the arts, by exhibiting the work of talented filmmakers, gets stronger every year. It always begins and ends with great films, but it becomes special by highlighting why we love to come to the movie theater and celebrating the artistic accomplishments of our filmmakers who foster that connection between us.”\n\nIvy Vale’s musical Out of My Comfort Zone opens the film festival on Friday, August 2. The film involves the tangled relationship triangle between two lifelong friends and a cyber bully who inadvertently sends their relationship to a very different place after outing one of them publicly. The screening will be preceded by Raymond-Kym Suttle’s short film, Groomed & Bridled. Delfine Paolini’s A Wonderful Way with Dragons screens on Saturday, August 10 as the Closing Night presentation. The film focuses on a group of children struggling to survive in a post-pandemic world and stars Violet McGraw (M3GAN). Cast and Crew from both films are scheduled to be in attendance.\n\nWorld premieres featured at this edition of FOC NYC are led by Laura Angiulli’s Italian drama I Know You (Io Ti Conosco) about a film editor whose work on her latest film intersects with her struggle to piece together the details of a family tragedy that plagues her. Harrison Dillingham’s Mortimer focuses on a man’s journey during a rainy night in 1948, to tend to the aftermath of a passionate affair. Charles Caracciolo’s documentary The Old Ballgame: The QBH Story is the filmmaker’s personal look at the Queensboro Hill Athletic Association in Flushing, NY that was responsible for running that area’s little league.\n\nAdditional film highlights include Caroline Keene and Dan Kennedy’s Merry Good Enough. Starring 2024 FOC NYC Festival Juror Raye Levine Spielberg, the holiday-themed drama follows a young woman with a complicated relationship with her dysfunctional family, who must oversome those feelings to bring her family back together again when her mother disappears on Christmas Eve. Julien Hayet-Kerknawi’s World War I set acton drama The Last Front stars Iain Glen (Game of Thrones) as a grieving father tasked with leading villagers to safety while evading a relentless enemy driven by vengeance.
