        "text": "TAMPA — Riddle me this: Nine men have portrayed the Joker in live-action cinematic productions, with Joaquin Phoenix set to reprise his version of the demented clown in October’s “Joker: Folie à Deux,” But which of the actors has a historic and personal connection to the Tampa Bay area?\n\nHere’s a clue, in a verse as Batman’s other archenemy, the Riddler, would compose:\n\nThis actor’s grandfather was the poet who helped set Cuba free, inspiring his countrymen from Ybor City. His Joker challenged Batman to surf out at sea, and his production was considered over-the-top, nonsensical, campy.\n\nThe answer is Cesar Romero.\n\nThe handsome mustached actor was the first to bring the comic book villain to life, doing so in the 1960s in a three-season television series and theatrical movie, both of which were titled “Batman.”\n\nBut while researching Romero’s connection to the area, the Tampa Bay Times was faced with a new riddle: Did he live in the Tampa house at 2714 N. Poplar Ave.?\n\nIt’s rumored that he did, and that rumor was once even used to market the residence.\n\nThe house is already popular among historic preservationists. Built in 1925, its facade is allegedly made of ballast rocks, which are stones that were once used to balance empty ships. Crews unloaded ballast rocks into a body of water before picking up cargo. This particular ballast is said to have come from the Hillsborough River.\n\nThe house looks similar to two other historic Tampa structures: a home at 712 S. Edison Ave. and St. James House of Prayer Episcopal Church at 2708 N. Central Ave. But the rocks that make up those buildings are said to be native to the river rather than ballast.\n\nRomero’s alleged connection to 2714 N. Poplar Ave. has made it an even greater talking point among locals.\n\nDid he own it?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nDoes he have any link to it?\n\nUnfortunately, perhaps only Batman, known in comics as the world’s greatest detective, has the skills to find that answer.\n\nThe local connection\n\nJose Marti is considered the George Washington of Cuba for his role in inspiring the nation’s residents to revolt against colonialist Spain. As a poet, he wrote and disseminated well-read essays about Cuba’s need for independence.\n\nIn the 1890s, Marti took his movement to U.S. cities with large Cuban American populations. Through public speeches, he asked that they financially support the effort and recruited soldiers. Historians estimate his efforts included some 20 such trips to Ybor, where Cuban immigrants had settled and formed a cigar industry.\n\nFrom New York in February 1895, Marti wrote the order to begin the Cuban War of Independence. He sent it to Tampa, where it was rolled into a cigar and smuggled to Cuba.\n\nMarti died in the war that pushed Spain from the island. His daughter remained in New York, married and, in 1907, gave birth to Romero.\n\nBefore dying in 1994, Romero amassed more than 200 acting credits, including “Weekend in Havana,” which knocked “Citizen Kane” from the top of the box office chart, and the original “Ocean’s 11″ starring Frank Sinatra.\n\nBut he’s perhaps best known for his portrayal of the Joker to actor Adam West’s Batman. In 2013, “TV Guide” named Romero’s Joker one of “The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time” despite the series and movie being classified as comedies due to gags like Shark Repellent Bat-Spray, a Joker-Batman surf contest, and the Batusi, which was the Caped Crusader’s version of the Watusi dance.\n\nRomero frequented the Tampa Bay area throughout the 1970s and 1980s to perform in dinner shows at Clearwater’s Showboat Theater, considered the top local venue for those performances in that era, according to news archives.\n\n“They’re fun and I make a lot of money,” Romero told the press in 1977.\n\nBut Mary Kay Walker, whose family owned the Showboat Theater, described Romero as “down to earth.”\n\n“He was a wonderful guy,” she said. “He never had demands like needing a certain ice cream and after the show he’d take pictures with the audience. He could not have been more friendly ... and he endeared himself to the public.”\n\nNews archives report that, while here for performances, Romero attended local Latin cultural events and often visited Ybor’s Jose Marti Park — built on the site of the home where the Cuban freedom fighter was nursed back to health after being poisoned by Spanish agents.\n\nBut where did Romero stay while in the area? And did he own a place of his own?\n\n“I don’t remember,” Walker said with a laugh. “That was a long time ago.”\n\nThe house\n\nA 1973 article reported that Romero was staying in a Clearwater apartment for a few weeks while working at the Showboat Theater. That’s the only mention of a residence the Times could find in news archives.\n\nOn Facebook groups dedicated to local history, members allege Romero owned 2714 N. Poplar Ave.\n\nWhen that house was on the market in 2015, the listing said, “This lovely place is also rumored to be the home of the famous Cuban actor, Cesar Romero.”\n\nCurrent owners Andrew and Jessica Wentworth, who reside in Germany and rent out the home, told the Times that they too have heard that Romero once lived there, but have never seen proof.\n\nThrough land records, the Times traced the ownership history of the house. Romero’s name does not appear on a deed for that residence, nor is it in ledgers listing all Hillsborough County and Pinellas County homeowners during Romero’s 86 years.\n\nPerhaps he rented 2714 N. Poplar Ave., or stayed with the owner?\n\nMaybe.\n\nWinston Morris owned it during the decades when Romero frequented the area. Morris’ nephew John J. Cullaro Jr. said: “I am not aware of any connection to Romero.”\n\nThe other owners, in order from when the house was built in 1925 until when Romero died, were Agnes Ames, William Bartlett, Walter Ragg, Morris and Carol Byrd.\n\nThe Times could not find their descendants nor a link between them and Romero. But it remains possible that the celebrity kept his affiliation quiet.\n\nFor now at least, whether Romero owned a Tampa home remains a riddle."
