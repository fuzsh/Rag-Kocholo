        "text": "01 of 30\n\nShirley Jones\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actress (for 1960's Elmer Gantry), beloved for her roles in Oklahoma!, The Music Man and The Partridge Family, turned 90 March 31, 2024, and celebrated with a party surrounded by her family.\n\nSon Shaun Cassidy shared a photo of Jones (posing with him and his brothers Patrick and Ryan) wearing a \"90 and Fabulous\" sash and \"90\" tiara with the caption \"Happy birthday to Miss Pittsburgh!\", a nod to her early pageant days.\n\nIn a note on his website, Cassidy elaborated further about what made his mom so special.\n\n\"In one week, on Easter Sunday, this small-town girl from Western Pennsylvania, who grew up to become a movie star but who never acted like one, will celebrate her 90th birthday. In a journey full of dramatic highs and lows, mom has always been an optimist and a lover of life. Simple things mean the most to her: family, friends, nature, animals, laughter, sing-a-longs at the piano, a dry martini. Not necessarily in that order.\"\n\n02 of 30\n\nTippi Hedren\n\nThe Alfred Hitchcock muse (and star of The Birds) has had an incredibly interesting life, and her Hollywood legacy is strong: She's mother to Melanie Griffith and grandmother to Dakota Johnson. She celebrated her 90th birthday in January 2020.\n\n03 of 30\n\nCarol Burnett\n\nThe comedy icon turned 90 in April 2023, and told PEOPLE at the time, \"I can't wrap my head around it. I still feel like I'm about 11, but I'm amazed. It sure went fast.\"\n\nKnown for her Emmy-award winning program The Carol Burnett Show as well as her role as Miss Hannigan in Annie and many, many other TV appearances, the actress says she hopes to leave a legacy of laughter. \"I made people laugh, made them feel good when they might have been down,\" she said. \"In my fan mail, many say it was the only time the family would get together, to watch and laugh. And that sometimes they were lonesome and were cheered up by our show. That's a good feeling.\"\n\n04 of 30\n\nJames Earl Jones\n\nThe esteemed actor turned 90 on Jan. 17, 2021.\n\n\"I'll make an exception and enjoy a slice of strawberry shortcake, my favorite!\" he told USA Today via email of the low-key festivities for his 90th birthday at his home in upstate New York. Jones, who said that he plans to continue acting \"for as long as I can,\" added at the time that he was \"feeling fantastic and grateful.\"\n\n\"Looking back at my life and extensive career, I am so proud of my work and accomplishments. I love growing older and wiser with time,\" he said.\n\nWhile Jones intends to continue acting, in September 2022 he announced that he would step back from performing the voice of one of his most iconic characters, Darth Vader. Moving forward, the franchise will use cutting-edge A.I. to voice the character by utilizing archival recordings of Jones' previous performances.\n\n05 of 30\n\nJoan Collins\n\nJoan Collins, who turned 90 in May 2023, is the epitome of indomitable, from growing up in London during World War II to being the most glamorous woman in the room at the Emmys well into her 90th year. Five husbands, three children and one indelible role later (as Alexis Carrington Colby, in Dynasty), Collins truly proves there is nothing like a Dame (she was named one in 2015)!\n\nIn a November 2023 feature with Louis Theroux, she told him her youthful outlook (and 32-years-younger husband) were essential to her well-being.\n\n“First of all, I don’t even feel my age. I don’t even talk about it. I don’t think about it,\" she said. \"I have some friends around my age and, um, I don’t find them interesting. Everybody’s gotten older except me.”\n\n06 of 30\n\nWilliam Daniels\n\nDaniels, who starred on the drama series St. Elsewhere and voiced the iconic KITT automobile in the action series Knight Rider, is perhaps best known as Boy Meets World's beloved Mr. Feeny.\n\nDaniels still occasionally hangs with his former Boy Meets World castmates, joining them for a hilarious photo op at the Boston Comic-Con Fan Expo in August 2019.\n\nDaniels, who turned 90 in March 2017, is also known for his longtime marriage to fellow actor Bonnie Bartlett. The pair celebrated their 70th anniversary on June 30, 2021.\n\n07 of 30\n\nRobert Wagner\n\nThe actor had been working in film for nearly 20 years before hitting it big in the late '60s and '70s with roles on TV's It Takes a Thief, Switch and Hart to Hart.\n\nIn his later career, Wagner (who turned 90 in February 2020) played Number Two in the Austin Powers movies and had recurring roles on Two and a Half Men and NCIS.\n\n08 of 30\n\nRita Moreno\n\nOne of the few stars to earn an EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award), Moreno turned 90 on Dec. 11, 2021, with decades of iconic, groundbreaking work to her name.\n\nShe's pictured here on the left attending the 1961 premiere of the original West Side Story, for which she won an Oscar for her portrayal of Anita, and on the right at the 2021 premiere of the Steven Spielberg version, in which she plays a new character, Valentina.\n\nIn addition to the West Side Story remake, Moreno has remained very active, including appearing in the 2023 films 80 for Brady and Fast X.\n\n09 of 30\n\nBarbara Eden\n\n\"I feel young,\" the I Dream of Jeannie star told Page Six shortly after her 90th birthday in August 2021.\n\nIn addition to maintaining an \"active\" social life, she credits regular workouts (she still has a trainer!) for her longevity.\n\n10 of 30\n\nBob Newhart\n\nThe actor and comedian turned 90 on Sept. 5, 2019 — and celebrated in Las Vegas! Days later he surfaced at the Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, playing a part in a bit about comedy legends that figured life-like statues of George Burns and Lucille Ball. When Ben Stiller, who did the segment, got to Newhart, the actor wryly reminded him, \"I'm still alive.\"\n\n\"You put me with George and Lucy and it's weird,\" Newhart said. \"Like I was in some weird museum of comedy.\"\n\n\"It's more like legends of comedy,\" Stiller insisted, riffing. \"Alive, dead … all different types of comedy!\"\n\nBut Newhart wasn't buying it. \"This legend is going to kick your ass, that way you'll know I'm alive,\" he said. \"You thought I was dead!\"\n\nThough best known for starring in the sitcoms The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart, he has continued to occasionally appear on television in shows like The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon.\n\n11 of 30\n\nQuincy Jones\n\nOne of the most legendary music producers of all time, who worked with everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, Jones is responsible for iconic contributions including \"We Are the World,\" the E.T. score and \"Billie Jean.\"\n\nHe celebrated his 90th birthday in March 2023; his daughter (one of his seven children) Rashida Jones posted in his honor: \"This man is 90 today!!! 90 pics on his 90th birthday! No one has lived more life, survived more challenges, contributed more culturally, loved with every piece of his heart than 'le Q',\"\n\n12 of 30\n\nMichael Caine\n\nMichael Caine turned 90 in March 2023, and celebrated with a star-studded birthday party. Several months later, following the premiere of his final film The Escapers, the actor announced his retirement, saying he'd gotten to do everything he wanted to: \"I might as well leave with all this — what have I got to do to beat this?”\n\nWith two Oscars, a happy family life and many enduring roles to his name, it's hard to argue with that assessment!\n\n13 of 30\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nCountry icon Willie Nelson celebrated his 90th birthday in April 2023 with (what else?) an epic, two-day concert, with musical tributes from friends ranging from Snoop Dogg to Miranda Lambert.\n\n\"I never thought I'd get here,\" Nelson told PEOPLE ahead of the event, which drew around 36,000 fans — and he said that performing is part of what contributes to his longevity.\n\n\"I get a lot of fun out of playing for an audience,\" he said. \"There's a great energy exchange there. It's what keeps me going.\"\n\n14 of 30\n\nWilliam Shatner\n\nThe Star Trek actor with the iconic voice celebrated entering his 90s in March 2021 by joking on Twitter: \"Well! I must say that the reaction to a 90th birthday is overwhelming.
