Have an account? .\n\nThe careers of some of the world's most acclaimed actors looked wildly different in their 20s.\n\nHarrison Ford was a struggling actor who used carpentry to supplement his performing career.\n\nOther actors, like Maggie Smith, were already getting cast in life-changing roles by age 22.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Hanks was cast in a slasher film at age 23.\n\nNow in his 60s, Tom Hanks has had a prolific acting career spanning multiple genres. In his 20s, Hanks moved to New York City from California and got his first film role in the slasher \"He Knows You're Alone\" (1980).\n\nIn 1981, he met actress Rita Wilson while filming the show \"Bosom Buddies.\" Then at age 29, Hanks acted alongside Wilson again in the film \"Volunteers.\" The pair later married in 1988.\n\nDecades later, Hanks is best known for his work in \"Big,\" \"A League of Their Own,\" \"Cast Away,\" the \"Toy Story\" franchise, and \"Elvis.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 26 years old, Meryl Streep was a successful Broadway actress.\n\nA versatile actress, to say the least, Meryl Streep is one of the most-awarded actresses working today.\n\nStreep was born in New Jersey in 1949. After graduating from the Yale School of Drama at age 26, Streep moved to New York City and was soon cast in multiple Broadway shows.\n\nStreep's first feature role was alongside Jane Fonda in \"Julia\" (1977), and in 1978 she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in \"The Deer Hunter.\"\n\nNow in her 70s, Streep has appeared in seemingly countless films including \"Sophie's Choice,\" \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" \"Into the Woods,\" \"The Post,\" and \"Don't Look Up.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForest Whitaker was 21 when he was cast in his first film.\n\nForest Whitaker has had a long and celebrated career in film.\n\nBorn in Texas in 1961, Whitaker largely grew up in California and went on to study drama in college.\n\nAt age 21, Whitaker was cast in Cameron Crowe's \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" and received roles in \"The Color of Money,\" \"Platoon,\" and \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" soon after.\n\nAs he has gotten older, Whitaker has gone on to receive acclaim for his acting abilities in dramas like \"Bird,\" \"The Last King of Scotland,\" and \"The Butler.\"\n\nRecently, Whitaker has played prominent roles in \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" \"Black Panther,\" and \"Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSigourney Weaver was 29 when she portrayed Ripley in \"Alien.\"\n\nBorn and raised in New York, Sigourney Weaver attended the Yale School of Drama and even acted alongside Streep in a theatrical production at Yale.\n\nAlthough her acting background was theatrical, Weaver was cast in her first film in 1977 as a small character in \"Annie Hall\" at age 27.
