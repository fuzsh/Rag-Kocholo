        "text": "My name is Larry Miller, I’m the President and CEO of Sit ‘n Sleep. In 1980, my father and I started Sit ‘n Sleep and its original name was Rivera Convertible Sofas. I put in $10,000 that I borrowed from an aunt and my dad put in $10,000 he borrowed from the bank. It was a business that was designed to sell futons, day beds, and sofa beds. We sold no mattresses, at that time.\n\nI slept on futons in Japan in 1971, ’72. I thought the futon would be a great thing to bring to America and sell here and, somehow, God blessed me, and I was right. The first year of business we did $200,000 in volume. I made $9,000 for the whole year. It was a very humble beginning. Fast forward to 2014, we did $113,000,000 and we expect to do in excess of $120,000,000 this year. So things have changed a lot in the life of the Miller family.\n\nMy father and I struggled in business for a good number of years. The first 15 years were blood and guts. It was difficult. We advertised in the LA Weekly, The Herald Examiner, and very little else. Eventually, we began to expand our advertising efforts. In about 1985, we found KABC Radio. A friend of my dad’s, Wally Sherwin, was the Program Director. He invited us to an opening-day Dodger game. We had a wonderful time. He said you should go on the radio and I looked at him and looked at my Dad and started laughing. I said, “We don’t have any credit. If you want to give us credit, I’ll come on.” He said, I’ll vouch for you. Give it a try.”\n\nSo, we went on the air for four over-nights on The Ray Briem Show. Eventually, we started getting business from his referrals and began expanding the number of shows we would advertise on. As time went on, we started improving little by little.\n\nLater, I started complaining about the advertising. The personalities read them without much passion. So the Program Director said, “Well smart ass, why don’t you come in and do it yourself?” So, eventually, I got so embarrassed I had to come in and do it myself. It was an absolute disaster. I stunk. I was pathetic. I took a half hour to do a 60-second spot and I was beside myself. Anyhow, I croaked it out and eventually got a little better and a little better.\n\nI started experimenting with some other radio stations and began to build the business. I might have hit $1,000,000 in 1990. So, it was still a very small business. At the end of ’91, I met a guy named Rich Kagan. Rich Kagan tried to sell me air time on a show called The Howard Stern Show. I hadn’t heard much about him and I started to do some research on this character, Howard Stern. I started listening. I thought, this cats dirtier than crap (laughs). But I kind of like him. I told Rich, “I don’t know if I can advertise on his show because people might get upset at work. We have a lot of women customers…” But Rich kept coming back and coming back and coming back. After about the tenth trip into the store he still wouldn’t take no for an answer.\n\nThe Howard Stern Show built our business by 100% that year. At the end of ’92 we were a $2,500,000 business. We decided to expand our advertising to TV and sure enough we went on to become a $5,000,000 business. And it was off to the races from then on. We started making money after that. I’d say that was the first year I made $100,000 in my life and, you know, I’ll never forget that.\n\nIt was a pretty good feeling to go from $9,000 a year to $100,000 a year. Over that period of time while I was working with Rich, I met another fella named Steve Dubane. We all became really good friends. They became kind of like my advertising consultants. Around that time, Steve and Rich had left to start their own advertising agency, Wingman, and Sit ‘n Sleep became their first client. After all that they did for me and my business the least I could do is give ’em a shot.\n\nThat was a fortuitous move, because not only were we friends, which we still are to this day, but they helped my business in a huge way. Shortly after that, I had bought my father out of the business and we opened a second and third store.\n\nBefore I knew it, Rich and Steve had helped me grow Sit ‘n Sleep to over 33 stores. Now it’s a $120,000,000 business. They’re bright and capable; always coming up with new ideas and new ways of doing things. They helped shepherd me into e-commerce and they helped modernize my business. Of course, there has been a lot of hard work on our part, but having great partners like Rich and Steve have made a huge difference in my business.\n\nI think there’ll be a lot more motion products and adjustable beds being sold. There should be new services introduced. For example, Tempur-Pedic has just introduced a hybrid called the Flex. Different types of foams are being introduced as well as new types of coil systems. We have foam coils now. There’s going to be many different types of experiments and some of them will work really well and some will not.\n\nSo, we have to embrace experimentation and try to introduce new and improved ways of sleeping. I think consumers are becoming more and more aware that sleep is an intrinsic part of health and without a good night’s sleep, we can’t be healthy. I think that mattresses are becoming more and more important to the consumer. We really spend a third of our life in bed so it’s become more and more important. We will sleep on it, walk on it, hop on it, watch TV on it, use our computers on it, make love on it, and sometimes we die in it. Selecting a mattress is a very personal decision.\n\nI think that we’re on the forefront of technology, both on the Internet and in-store. Sit ‘n Sleep has tried to enhance the mattress selection process with our Body Diagnostic and Bed Match system. Nobody really has anything like it in the industry. We try and consistently give the consumer a unique experience with our technology and mattress selection. If we don’t give our consumer an overpowering reason to come in and buy a mattress then we don’t deserve their money… and then we have to deliver on it. You have to make your promise, and you have to deliver on it. You know, I would be very sad and very disappointed if we couldn’t deliver on all of our promises."
