        "text": "Americans love celebrities, especially movie stars. We look to them for entertainment, cultural leadership, and — for better or worse — political guidance. Any way you look at it, actors have an inordinate amount of influence in our society.\n\nThat influence generally emanates from Los Angeles and New York City, the two main hubs of the entertainment industry. Yet only a fraction of actors actually come from these cities. Our nation’s star thespians originate from all across our vast nation.\n\nExploring this notion, 24/7 Wall Street has identified the most famous actor from each state. Each actor’s level of fame was determined by creating an index based on IMDb popularity, Wikipedia page views, and audience ratings of his or her work.\n\nMany of the country’s most famous actors have earned their status through years of hard work. John Goodman, who was born in Affton, Missouri, has been working steadily for 43 years. He has 155 acting credits and is the most famous actor to originate in Missouri.\n\nStill, an entertainer’s level of fame doesn't directly correlate with how prolific or formally accomplished they are. A number of actors on the list are younger and have had shorter careers. These include Damon Wayans Jr., who hails from Vermont, and Matthew Fox, who comes from Wyoming. Both actors have fewer than 30 credits to their names yet represent their respective states on our list.\n\n1.

To be considered, each actor had to appear in the top 10,000 rankings on IMDb’s STARmeter.\n\nEach actor’s place of birth was the reference point for determining where they are from. Actors who have gained the majority of their fame for reasons other than acting, such as Meghan Markle, were excluded from consideration."
