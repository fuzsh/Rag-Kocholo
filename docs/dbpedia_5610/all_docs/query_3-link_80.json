        "text": "When Will Smith was turning 21, the rapper was going by Fresh Prince, but he hadn't yet landed his breakout role on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. By the same age, Jaden was also pursuing a career in music and has already had a strong influence in the fashion world.\n\nBy the age of 41, Tom had already won two Academy Awards for best actor, in consecutive years. His son, Colin, has followed his father into show business and by the same age, had a solid number of credits under his belt—from King Kong to House Bunny.\n\nPrince Charles was nearing the end of his marriage to Princess Diana and had recently welcomed his second son, Prince Harry, by his late 30s. As for Prince William, he'd been married for eight years and had three kids.\n\nPrince Charles welcomed his first son, and heir, a couple of years before his 35th birthday. As for Prince Harry, he was a couple years behind his father and welcomed his first son at 35.\n\nThe son of the N.W.A. rapper-turned-actor, Ice Cube, looks so much like his famous father that he played him in the 2015 biopic about his 1980 group, Straight Outta Compton. Ice Cube was already a well-known rapper by the same age.\n\nBoth Kirk and Michael Douglas had distinguished acting careers and were considered part of A-list Hollywood. Back when Kirk was 30, he had just landed his first role in the film The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, while Michael, at the same age, was busy starring on the show The Streets of San Francisco.\n\nJust like Michael is the spitting image of his father, his son Cameron very much resembles him. At 43, Michael starred in the 1987 hit Fatal Attraction, while Cameron kicked off an acting career of his own in The Runner.\n\nBy the time he turned 28, Scott was already following in his father's footsteps and pursuing a career in acting, landing roles in 2015's The Longest Ride and 2016's Suicide Squad.\n\nFormer Mr. Universe, Arnold, and his son with Maria Shriver, Patrick, prove that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. By the age of 23, Patrick had worked as both a model and an actor—though we don't think he'll be running for governor any time soon.\n\nWhen your dad is one of the best NBA players of all time, it's only natural that you follow suit. Bronny is well on his way to playing professionally, with LeBron often showing up to his son's games to coach and cheer him on.\n\nIt's no wonder Ben Stiller is one of comedy's biggest names—comedic genius runs in his blood, as his father was Jerry Stiller, who enjoyed a successful career spanning almost 70 years. Both actors were well-known in Hollywood by their mid-40s.\n\nAlthough his father was assassinated in 1980 at the age of 40, Sean Lennon has upheld his father's name with honor by working as a musician, singer-songwriter, and guitarist.\n\nSadly, at the age of 36, Jamaican musician and cultural icon Bob Marley passed away. At the same age as his late father, Ziggy Marley looked almost identical and was carrying on his dad's legacy as a musician.\n\nDonald Sutherland, who shot to fame in shows like M.A.S.H. and Dirty Dozen, hit his stride in the film industry when he won acclaim for his roles in 1900 and Ordinary People. His son, Kiefer, rose to fame for the '80s film, The Lost Boys, and was later on the hit TV show 24.\n\nThere's no mistaking that jawline. The grandson of Marlon Brando, Tuki Brando, carries on the iconic actor's legacy of devilish good looks working as a model for brands like Versace.\n\nAlan Thicke was America's favorite sitcom dad on Growing Pains throughout his late 30s and early 40s. But the late actor's son, Robin Thicke, has paved his own way in the entertainment industry as a singer and has had several big hits by the same age, including \"Blurred Lines.\"\n\nRob Lowe was an '80s heartthrob during his teenage years. While his son, John, didn't spend his teen years in the public eye, he did appear in a few projects with his father and brother, including a reality series called The Lowe Files.\n\nThe late great Glenn Frey and his son shared more in common than just their long hair. Deacon Frey kept Glenn's musical legacy alive after his passing in 2016, and began touring with his father's band, The Eagles, as a guitarist and vocalist.\n\nMartin Sheen clearly passed some serious acting chops onto son, Emilio Estevez, who was a member of the Brat Pack in the 1980s and has made a name for himself in his own right in Hollywood.\n\nAt 23 years old, Brandon Thomas Lee, the son of Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson, opted for a different career than his father's in Mötley Crüe. Instead of music, he pursed acting and was one of the newcomers on The Hills: New Beginnings."
