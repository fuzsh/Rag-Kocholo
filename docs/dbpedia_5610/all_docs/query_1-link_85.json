        "text": "No one knows comedian and actor Larry Miller better than his own son.\n\nIn a recent telephone interview about his one-man show, which comes to CityStage this week, Miller was talking about some of his strengths, citing acting, writing good character pieces, music, but before he could finish, his young son yelled in the background – “cocktails.”\n\nDrinks just happen to serve as part of the inspiration behind Miller’s current one-man show which he calls, “Cocktails with Larry Miller: Little League, Adultery & Other Bad Ideas.”\n\n\"The show is actually about real life, and the word cocktail becomes a metaphor for everything that happens in life. It's not really about drinking too much, but about saying a little of this and a little of that ... everything I have had a chance to do and observe in life. It's not topical in the sense you won't find me talking about the presidential race, that's not my style of comedy,\" Miller said.\n\nIf you don't recognize the name Larry Miller, then just take a look at a photograph of him. As one of Hollywood's most recognizable faces, Miller has amassed an impressive list of performances in over 100 film and television shows. He began his career with a memorable scene alongside Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in the blockbuster film, \"Pretty Woman,\" as well as roles in such films as \"The Princess Diaries,\" \"The Nutty Professor,\" \"Bee Movie\" and \"Ten Things I Hate About You.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nEvent:\n\n“Cocktails with Larry Miller”\n\nWhen:\n\nWednesday and Thursday, 7:30 p.m.; and Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere:\n\nCityStage, Springfield\n\nCost:\n\n$40.50, $36\n\nFor more info:\n\nCall (413) 788-7033 or www.citystage.symphonyhall.com\n\nMiller has made dozens of appearances on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,” “The Late Show with David Letterman” and “Real Time with Bill Maher.” He has also starred in his own HBO comedy specials and on Broadway in Neil Simon’s play, “The Dinner Party.” His other television credits include “Desperate Housewives,” “Medium,” “Burn Notice,” “Law & Order” and “Seinfeld,” in addition to a recurring role on “Boston Legal.” Miller is the also the only “bad guy” to return on “Law and Order” as an unrepentant and uncatchable wife killer.\n\nAnd, he recently made guest appearances on the HBO show “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” CBS television’s popular “NCIS” and was in the Garry Marshall film, “New Year’s Eve.”\n\nMiller hosts the podcast “This Week with Larry Miller” for the Ace Broadcasting Network, where he unleashes a barrage of humor about the absurdities of daily life. He can also be heard weekly on the most downloaded podcast on iTunes, “The Adam Carolla Show.” He is also a contributing humorist to The Huffington Post and The Weekly Standard, as well as the author of the best-selling book “Spoiled Rotten America.”\n\nWith an impressive list of performances on television, the big screen, and on the theater stage, you have to really love what you do, and Miller literally “gushes” about his job.\n\n“I may sound like a nine-year-old, but the truth is that I have the best time on every acting job, even those that didn’t work out quite like I had hoped. Performing is everything that I love ... it’s my home away from home when I’m on a set, just like when a baseball player steps up to the plate and says to himself ‘this is where I belong,’ that’s exactly the way I think about a set,” Miller said.\n\nAnd, the popular comedian and character actor feels even stronger about performing live in theaters, and that applies to touring his “Cocktails with Larry Miller” in theaters across American and Canada.\n\n“I love doing stand-up comedy, and still do it in its purest form on shows like Letterman and Leno. But, a good one-man show is as different from stand-up as a flute is from a trumpet. If well conceived and grows over time, it becomes theater on its own with different characters, music, original songs, sets and costume changes and, of course, is funny,” Miller said.\n\nMiller, who attended nearby Amherst College where he majored in music, said while growing up in Long Island, his family vacationed twice each year in Springfield.\n\n“I asked my mother, ‘Why Springfield?”, and she didn’t really know other than to tell me my dad picked it and that was our trip to enjoy. Even my uncle told me he always loved our trips to Springfield, but he didn’t know why we went there so often,” Miller said."
