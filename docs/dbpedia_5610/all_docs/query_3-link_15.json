        "text": "Can I meet famous Broadway actors after the show?\n\nMeeting stars on Broadway at the stage door (or “stagedooring”) is a huge NYC theater tradition. Many actors love meeting fans to sign Playbills and briefly chat about the show. It is a great way to share your appreciation for the performance and even get a photo with your favorite actors. The cast usually meet fans after the evening show rather than matinees because of the quick turnaround between performances, but this can vary.\n\nSome Broadway theaters may have restrictions on stagedooring, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. If you are unsure about stage door policies, it is worth asking at the venue’s official box office or social media channels.\n\nHow should I prepare to meet actors at the stage door?\n\nTheatergoers usually visit the stage door after they have seen a show, and you may be asked to present your ticket as proof of attendance. This is to prevent overcrowding.\n\nIf you want to stagedoor and meet stars on Broadway, here are our top tips:\n\nBring a pen and something to sign. Playbills are free and getting one signed is a great souvenir! The best pens to bring are felt tips, because signatures can be easily written and read with thicker ink.\n\nRespect safety measures at the theater. Some theaters may ask you to keep your distance or wear a mask, to ensure the comfort and safety of you, the actors and venue staff.\n\nBe prepared to wait. Actors may not come out right away if they are getting changed, eating, or entertaining guests. You might have to wait for a while, but many theater fans enjoy the community aspect of this, as they can chat to other people about the show.\n\nListen to theater staff. Security and ushers at the theater have your safety in mind, so any directions they give are to make sure the stage door is well-managed.\n\nBe respectful of other theatergoers and the actors. Line-cutting, interrupting conversations and other disruptive behavior is frowned upon, and can make the stage door experience a lot less fun for everyone. A polite thank you to the actor and staff is always welcome as well, as they often take time out of their day to meet fans.\n\nBe polite if an actor can’t stagedoor. If an actor is unable to meet fans at the stage door, it can be very disappointing, but fans will be informed as soon as possible to ensure they are not waiting outside.\n\nCan you send gifts to actors on Broadway?\n\nThe policy for sending gifts and cards to Broadway performers varies from theater to theater and food items may be prohibited for safety reasons. If you intend to meet an actor at the stage door, they may be able to accept small gifts in person. It is best to email or phone the venue’s box office in advance to ensure you are not disappointed.\n\nWhat happens if an actor does not appear at a performance?\n\nThe appearance of any actor on Broadway is subject to scheduling, illness, injury, holiday entitlement and unforeseen circumstances. Your ticket is primarily for the show rather than for an actor, but in some cases refunds or exchanges may be possible if a star billed above the show name is not at a scheduled performance. This is entirely down to the venue’s discretion and you are not entitled to a refund.\n\nIf you have booked tickets to see a famous actor on Broadway, it can be disappointing if they are unable to perform. However, most shows have fantastic understudies who work hard to deliver a performance you won’t forget. Some of the biggest names in theater started as understudies, so you might be watching a future Broadway star!\n\nMany shows publish holiday dates for the leading actors, so you can check which dates they will not be performing on. Check our production page for dates that celebrities are not appearing on.\n\nWho are the biggest Broadway actresses right now?\n\nTony Award winner Patti LuPone is currently appearing in one of the hottest shows in town, The Roommate. Coming up soon, you can also see Tony Award winner Audra McDonald in classic musical Gypsy, and Nicole Scherzinger in Jamie Lloyd's acclaimed revival of Sunset Boulevard at the St James Theatre.\n\nSeveral other award-winning female Broadway stars actresses continue to deliver fantastic performances in long-running shows, including Tony Award nominee Eva Noblezada as Persephone in Hadestown.\n\nWho are the most famous Broadway actors performing this year?\n\nSome of the most acclaimed male Broadway stars on stage right now include Robert Downey Jr. in McNeal; Downey is an Academy Award-winning actor who is making his Broadway debut in a tense new thriller about Artificial Intelligence.\n\nOther popular Broadway actors to watch include Adam Driver in Hold on to Me Darling. Driver is best known for playing Kylo Ren in Star Wars and has appeared in Marriage Story and House of Gucci."
