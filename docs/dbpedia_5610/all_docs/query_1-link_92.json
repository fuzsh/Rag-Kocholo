        "text": "KALAMAZOO â€”\n\nHey, it's that one guy. He was in that movie, that one show, you know the one ...\n\nLarry Miller laughed when told that was this writer's response at seeing his name and face. When that's the response he gets on the street, \"It's nice, it's great, it means you work enough,\" Miller said during a phone interview from his home in the Los Angeles area.\n\nMiller was a vengeful doorman on \"Seinfeld,\" a sleazy comedy club owner on \"Law and Order,\" a creepy ex in \"Best in Show,\" the father in \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" and the role that launched his character actor career, the arrogant salesman in \"Pretty Woman.\"\n\n\"You're not on the short-list of new James Bonds,\" he's realized, \"but what's wrong with that?\"\n\nHe's also a standup comedian who's been a regular on late-night talk shows for decades. Over 30 years ago Miller tried standup after attempting to be a pianist and drummer in New York City clubs.\n\nNow Miller is combining standup and music in a one-man show, \"Cocktails with Larry Miller: Little League, Adultery, and Other Bad Ideas.\" He's planning on taking it to \"thousands\" of theaters, including the Saugatuck Center for the Arts Saturday.\n\nHe had two realizations when calling for the interview -- first, he was late; second, he had forgotten the time because he was at the piano. \"All right! I'm practicing!\"\n\nMiller is working on satirical songs based on timeless foibles. \"Funny enough, the song I was practicing is called 'Cocktail,'\" he said.\n\n\"Life is a cocktail,\" he said. Like a Harvey Wallbanger's ingredients, in life and comedy \"the topics are always going to be the same. The topics are: Hey, did you wake up today? Did you get out of bed today? What did you see?\"\n\nAnd, more cocktail-focused, were your bad ideas influenced by alcohol today?\n\nOne of Miller's signature pieces is \"Five Levels of Drinking,\" \"six if you live in a trailer park.\" Level one is when \"one of your friends buys another round -- one of your unemployed friends.\" And the fifth is when you crawl out of the bar to find the sun has risen and it's zeroed in on you \"'like God's flashlight.' It took me a while to find that phrase,\" Miller said.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhen:\n\n8 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere:\n\nSaugatuck Center for the Arts, 400 Culver St., Saugatuck\n\nCost:\n\n$35\n\nContact:\n\n269-857-2399,\n\nMiller has avoided all gimmicks that have come and gone in the last decades of standup.\n\nHe likes \"classic, solid, right-up-the-middle\" comedy. Classic, to him, \"doesn't mean old. It's like saying someone's a good kisser. Like Cleopatra. Good kissing wasn't invented 40 minutes ago.\"\n\nHe'd been speculating how angry he'd be at the world if he never found comedy, Miller said. Comedy is a driving force for him, like the visions that caused Richard Dreyfuss to make mountains out of mashed potatoes in \"Close Encounters,\" he said.\n\nComedy is hard, but it's what he does. \"What would be easy, working for Etna? Would that be easy for me or any of us (comics)? How far would we get before we got fired?\" he said, then slipped into the voice of a boss. \"You seem pleasant, sometimes, but ...\""
