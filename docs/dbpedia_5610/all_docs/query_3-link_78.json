        "text": "Young rising talent is an exciting prospect—it means that the future is in good hands. There's a lot of very talented actors that are in their twenties and younger who are making their presence felt in the land of Hollywood and beyond. They've invested a lot of time and hard work into honing their craft, and the results of that work are starting to pay off. Some of the emerging best young actors are dynamic, versatile talents that you will certainly be seeing much more of on big and small screens in the future, and if you are a fan of movies and television, that is something that should make you very excited.\n\nToday we'll be taking a look at the 40 best young actors that are currently making their marks in Tinseltown. Scroll down to check out our selections, and make sure to show your support and encouragement by watching their upcoming projects.\n\nRELATED: How the Last Blockbuster Store Became a Tourist Destination\n\n1. Shameik Moore\n\nImage credit: Netflix\n\nAge: 28\n\nWhere They're From: Atlanta, GA\n\nOur Favorite Role: Miles Morales, Spider-Man Series\n\nLet's start with the man of the hour—Shameik Moore. While Shameik has previously starred in movies and series such as 2015's Dope and Wu-Tang: An American Saga, it's his role as Miles Morales/Spider-Man that has propelled him into superstardom. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was an Academy Award winning success, and it would be an awful shame if Across the Spider-Verse doesn't see similar awards considering it's even better than its predecessor (but that's a different topic for a different day). The bottom line is—the future is bright for Moore. You can next catch him as Miles Morales again in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse in 2024.\n\n2. Timothée Chalamet\n\nImage credit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nAge: 27\n\nWhere They're From: Hells Kitchen, NY\n\nOur Favorite Role: Paul Atreides, Dune\n\nTimothée Chalamet has an eventful rest of the year ahead of him with Dune: Part Two due out in November, and Wonka scheduled to release in December. In the past several years alone, Timothée has managed to receive various accolades such as nominations for an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, and three BAFTA film awards—and he's only 27! The sequel to Dune and Wonka is sure to cause a stir as we get closer to the premiere dates, so stay tuned because it's going to be a fun fall and winter.\n\n3. Zendaya\n\nImage credit: Hulu\n\nAge: 26\n\nWhere They're From: Oakland, CA\n\nOur Favorite Role: Rue, Euphoria\n\nZendaya is...Zendaya—one of the biggest brightest stars in entertainment. When she isn't captivating as Rue on Euphoria, she's dazzling in roles like MJ in Spider-Man and Marie in Malcom & Marie. Zendaya has two projects scheduled to come out in 2023, and that's the romantic sports comedy Challengers due out on September 15th, 2023, and Dune: Part Two on November 3rd, 2023.\n\n4. Yara Shahidi\n\nImage credit: Freeform\n\nAge: 23\n\nWhere They're From: Minneapolis, MN\n\nOur Favorite Role: Tinker Bell, Peter Pan and Wendy\n\nIf it seems like Yara Shahidi has been around for a long time, it's because she has. In fact, it can be easy to forget that she's still only 23-years-old because of how loaded her resume already is. We got to see Yara in a different role earlier this year when she portrayed Tinker Bell in Peter Pan and Wendy, and we're sure there's plenty more of that in the years to come.\n\n5. Letitia Wright\n\nImage credit: Marvel Studios\n\nAge: 29\n\nWhere They're From: Georgetown, Guyana\n\nOur Favorite Role: Shuri, Black Panther, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nWhen Letitia Wright isn't dominating as Shuri aka Black Panther, she can be seen in other projects like Death on the Nile, The Silent Twins, and Sing 2. Letitia's work has earned her notable honors such as the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2019, and a Satellite Award nomination in Steve McQueen's 2020 anthology series Small Axe. Next up for Letitia is a starring role in the western film drama directed by Anthony Mandler, Surrounded, which is set to be released digitally by MGM on June 20th.\n\n6. Tom Holland\n\nImage credit: Apple TV\n\nAge: 27\n\nWhere They're From: Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom\n\nOur Favorite Role: Danny Sullivan, The Crowded Room\n\nIs it still too early to say The Crowded Room is our favorite Tom Holland role to date? Seriously, if you haven't started watching the show, this is your call to action as it's incredibly intriguing. Tom showcases why he's one of the most versatile young actors in the game right now, and it's a performance you don't want to miss.\n\n7. Kelvin Harrison Jr.\n\nImage credit: 20th Century Studios\n\nAge: 28\n\nWhere They're From: New Orleans, LA\n\nOur Favorite Role: Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-George, Chevalier\n\nMake no mistake—Kelvin Harrison Jr. has been putting that work in now for almost a decade, and the world is finally starting to notice what a talent he really is. Kelvin's latest role was as Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-George in Chevalier, to which he earned major praise from critics and audiences around the world, and you can next catch him as Taka in Mufasa: The Lion King, which is tentatively scheduled to be released in 2024.\n\n8. Noah Schnapp\n\nImage credit: Netflix\n\nAge: 18\n\nWhere They're From: New York, NY\n\nOur Favorite Role: Will Byers, Stranger Things\n\n18-year-old Noah Schnapp is one to watch as well. Best known for his role as Will Byers in Stranger Things, Noah was most recently seen in the film The Tutor, which is about a tutor becoming the obsession of one of his students. We're looking forward to seeing what else Noah has in the tank in the coming future.\n\n9. Kiernan Shipka\n\nImage credit: Netflix\n\nAge: 23\n\nWhere They're From: Chicago, IL\n\nOur Favorite Role: Sabrina Spellman, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\n\nKiernan Shipka's career continues to flourish with a riveting performance as Sabrina Spellman in the Netflix Series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina which garnered a lot of praise, and starring roles in films such as 2014's Flowers in the Attic, and 2019's The Silence. This past May it was announced that Kiernan has joined the cast for the upcoming epic disaster film Twisters due out July 2024, and you can also catch her in the upcoming comedy Maximum Truth, which is scheduled to be released on June 23rd, 2023.\n\n10. Storm Reid\n\nImage credit: Sony Pictures\n\nAge: 19\n\nWhere They're From: Atlanta, GA\n\nOur Favorite Role: June, Missing\n\nTurning 20 in July, Storm Reid has been acting on the big and small screen now for over a decade, with some of her most notable roles being the films A Wrinkle In Time (2018), The Invisible Man (2020), and The Suicide Squad (2021) along with television appearances on Euphoria where she plays Gia Bennett, and The Last of Us. Storm turned a phenomenal performance in this year's Missing where she starred alongside Nia Long, and will next appear in The Nun 2 due out on September 8th, 2023.\n\n11. Paris Jackson\n\nImage credit: Hulu\n\nAge: 25\n\nWhere They're From: Los Angeles, CA\n\nOur Favorite Role: Hailey, Swarm\n\nParis Jackson has proven to be an elite triple threat singer, actress, and model. When the 25-year-old artist isn't rocking out the stage/studio or modeling, you can find her acting as she has amassed quite a few credits over the past few years including her role as Maya in American Horror Stories, and most recently, her portrayal as Hailey in the Amazon Prime series Swarm. We're excited to see what's next from Paris in the acting world.\n\n12. Tanner Buchanan\n\nImage credit: ABC\n\nAge: 24\n\nWhere They're From: Lima, OH\n\nOur Favorite Role: Leo Kirkman, Designated Survivor\n\nAt just 24, Tanner Buchanan has already been able to fill up his resume with his role as Robby Keene in Cobra Kai (a role he has had since 2018), along with a main role on Designated Survivor from 2016 to 2018. Tanner has also appeared in the films He's All That (2021) and 2022's The Hyperions. There's certainly more in store from Tanner in the years to come.\n\n13. Asante Blackk\n\nImage credit: Netflix\n\nAge: 21\n\nWhere They're From: Waldorf, Maryland\n\nOur Favorite Role: Malik Hodges, This Is Us\n\nAsante Blackk's work has already earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination (which makes him one of the youngest in history to be nominated) for his role in the 2019 miniseries When They See Us, and a Critics' Choice Televison Award nomination for his performance as Malik Hodges in This Is Us, so it's safe to say the future is bright for this young man.\n\n14.

This past February, it was announced that Keke will next star alongside Sacha Baron Cohen in a 1970s period piece entitled Super Toys, which will be directed and produced by David O. Russell.\n\n16. Anya Taylor-Joy\n\nImage credit: FOCUS FEATURES\n\nAge: 27\n\nWhere They're From: Miami, FL\n\nOur Favorite Role: Beth Harmon, The Queen's Gambit\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy is another young actress who's work has lauded numerous praise and accolades. She received stellar reviews for her performance as Beth Harmon in The Queen's Gambit in 2020 where she won a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award along with an Emmy nomination, and her recent credits include starring roles in the films Last Night in Soho (2021), The Northman (2022), The Menu (2022), which also nabbed her another Golden Globe nomination, and of course, the record-breaking The Super Mario Bros.

Since then, Hedges has appeared in the films Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), Boy Erased (2018), Waves (2019), and more.

We're definitely keeping an eye on what direction Marcel goes career-wise next.\n\n24.

Victoria Pedretti\n\nImage credit: Netflix\n\nAge: 28\n\nWhere They're From: Philadelphia, PA\n\nOur Favorite Role: Love Quinn, You\n\nVictoria Pedretti has given us a little bit of everything thus far in her career from being a bit on the cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs side as Love Quinn in You, to scaring the mess out of us in The Haunting of Hill House (2018). There's plenty more of that lively acting range in the coming months as Victoria is currently filming the upcoming drama Caste.\n\n28.

Asa Butterfield\n\nImage credit: HBO\n\nAge: 26\n\nWhere They're From: Islington, London, United Kingdom\n\nOur Favorite Role: Otis Milburn, Sex Education\n\nWhile Asa has been acting since childhood, it's his starring role as Otis Milburn in Netflix series Sex Education that has propelled him into stardom, and while his television work definitely keeps him busy, Asa regularly squeezes in film work too appearing in three films alone last year. Asa's next film appearance will be a starring role in All Fun and Games, which is currently in post-production.\n\n34.
