        "text": "Most people know that Hollywood is full of famous short men. You can’t tell how tall someone is on screen!\n\nThere are all sorts of tricks to make people appear taller on camera (like surrounding them by other short people, for example). Here are some of the most successful and influential actors and famous male celebrities under 5’9″ (sort by name or height):\n\nLet’s look at each actor in more detail…\n\nTom Cruise\n\n5’7″\n\nLove him or hate him, Tom Cruise is one of the most legendary actors of our time. From Rain Man to the epic Mission: Impossible franchise, there isn’t a genre in which he hasn’t delivered a captivating (even Oscar-worthy) performance.\n\nAt a humble 5’7”, Tom Cruise is somehow larger than life. I think his success is due in part to the intensity that he brings to the screen. This energy seems to be an inherent part of his character, but you can tell that he works hard, too.\n\nAfter all, he’s a male actor who does a lot of his own stunts, which is pretty badass. Of course, he occasionally partners with a stunt double.\n\nFor example, in the opening scene of Mission: Impossible 2, he had some help from legendary rock climber Ron Kauk, who is only an inch or so taller.\n\nElijah Wood\n\n5’6″\n\nShort and slender, Wood’s first film debut in Back to the Future Part II, although brief, put him in the spotlight.\n\nShortly thereafter, he established himself as an emotional, versatile actor through his roles in Radio Flyer, The Good Son, and The War (which, by the way, is an amazing movie that didn’t get nearly enough attention at the box office).\n\nIn 2001, when Wood was 20 years old, he catapulted to super-stardom after voice acting the lovable Frodo in the first installment of what would become one of the most epic film trilogies of all time.\n\nSince LOTR, Wood has been in some awesome movies. After all, he has enough money to do whatever he wants, so he doesn’t exactly have to chase the blockbusters anymore. If you want to see the grittier side of Elijah Wood, check out Green Street Hooligans, the brutal tale of soccer gang rivalries in England.\n\nWood is also a funny dude. If you don’t believe me, check out his new show Wilfred. Fair warning: you’ll either love it or hate it.\n\nWoody Allen\n\n5’5″\n\nAn award-winning author, comedian, actor, writer, director and musician, Woody Allen is one of the most talented entertainers and creative minds of the century. He stands five feet and five inches tall and weighs less than 150 pounds, so he’s a pretty small guy.\n\nAllen has said a lot of quotable things, but one of my favorite lines of his is:\n\n“Eighty percent of success is showing up.”\n\nIt’s so true. Just show up. Make sure you’re on time and looking sharp, and you will get far. But don’t take my word for it. Take Woody’s. After all, he has won four Oscars, two Golden globes and nine BAFTAs.\n\nAl Pacino\n\n5’6″\n\nWhat comes to mind when you think of Al Pacino? Is it the fact that he’s 5’6″ tall? Or do you picture a pissed-off, blood-covered Tony Montana letting loose with a machine gun? Yeah…me too.\n\nArguably one of the most famous Italian male actors, Al Pacino, has played some of the most hardcore characters in some of the most dramatic films ever made. The crazy thing is, he actually has a lot in common with these characters that he portrayed so masterfully.\n\nPacino grew up in a broken family in the bad part of NYC. He was drinking and smoking at a very young age, and he apparently didn’t shy away from a fight. He dropped out of high school at age 17 and worked odd jobs to finance his acting lessons.\n\nSo, even as a little kid in the ghetto, he didn’t let his size hold him back. He worked hard and fought (literally) his way to success. Let Al Pacino be an example of how a short man – or any man – can overcome the odds and achieve great things.\n\nBen Stiller\n\n5’7″\n\nBen Stiller is a hilarious actor and director. He parents were both established comedians, so it was pretty much inevitable that he was going to be a funny man.\n\nHe got his big break with There’s Something About Mary in 1998, and it was all uphill from there.\n\nStiller is only 5’7″ tall, but he stays in great shape. He’s been side by side with Tom Cruise in a few short spoofs, and he definitely holds his own when it comes to “jackedness”.\n\nBen’s willingness to use slap-stick, self-deprecating style of humor has worked out well for him. About his commitment to acting and making people laugh, he has said:\n\n“I’m always willing to endure humiliation on behalf of my characters.”\n\nBeing a shorter man, I think this sort of “roll with the punches” mentality goes a long way. You should expect someone, at some point, to make fun of you. Whether it’s about your height or something else. Your power comes from how you react, and Ben Stiller has mastered that.\n\nMichael J. Fox\n\n5’4″\n\nFox is cool for a lot of reasons. First and foremost, he rode a hoverboard in Back to the Future Part II, a scene which, to this day, makes me resentful that we don’t have real hoverboards yet.\n\nSecond, he became a heartthrob actor, producer, activist and philanthropist despite being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease more than two decades ago.\n\nThese days, Michael J. Fox puts a lot of energy in to his foundation for Parkinson’s research, although he still does some acting (like unexpected and often hilarious appearances on Saturday Night Live, Rescue Me and Curb Your Enthusiasm).\n\nMost people, however, will remember Fox for his starring roles in the classic films like Teen Wolf, Back to the Future, Doc Hollywood and Stuart Little.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss\n\n5’5″\n\nSome people love him for Jaws, some respect him for Mr. Holland’s Opus, and others just want to watch What About Bob on repeat.\n\nRegardless, most of us generally agree that Richard Dreyfuss is an outstanding actor.\n\nAt 5’5″ he is one of the shortest actors on our list. This didn’t stop him from winning an Oscar for Best Actor, along with a Golden Globe and BAFTA Award.\n\nDreyfuss is also a political activist, public speaker, author and academic. He has battled bipolar disorder for a long time, but he clearly didn’t let this or any other physical or mental conditions stop him.\n\nDustin Hoffman\n\n5’5”\n\nStanding at 5’5”, Dustin Hoffman has starred in over fifty films.\n\nHe’s perhaps best known for his role in the hit film Tootsie, released in 1982.\n\nScott Caan\n\n5’5”\n\nSon of famous bad boy actor James Caan, Scott Caan measures 5’5” tall.\n\nHe’s forayed into both the world of Hollywood and television acting and has even made a name for himself as a photographer.\n\nTom Hollander\n\n5’4”\n\nLet’s hop over to the other side of the pond for our next short actor, shall we?\n\nAt 5’4” tall, English actor Tom Hollander had been starring in film and television since he was just fourteen.\n\nHe is not to be confused with Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, though he’s another British actor under 5’8″.\n\nMartin Freeman\n\n5’4”\n\nHere’s a talented English actor (and comedian, by the way) who has gotten very famous over the past few years.\n\nMeasuring 5’4”, Martin Freeman is best known for his portrayal of Dr. John Watson in the hit British TV series Sherlock.\n\nJohnny Galecki\n\n5’5”\n\nGalecki has been acting in movies since he was just a kid, starring in classics such as Prancer and National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation.\n\nNow, this 5’5” actor is most well-known for his role as Leonard Hofstadter in The Big Bang Theory.\n\nSimon Helberg\n\n5’6”\n\nHmm…we’re thinking CBS must have a soft spot for men of modest height. What do you think?\n\nStanding at 5’6”, Simon Helberg also stars in the hit show The Big Bang Theory as the goofy yet loveable Howard Wolowitz.\n\nKevin Hart\n\n5’4”\n\n5’4” tall actor Kevin Hart isn’t just an accomplished actor.\n\nThis famous short man also a comedian, a television host, and a producer.\n\nKen Jeong\n\n5’4”\n\nAmerican comedian and actor Ken Jeong stands at 5’4” tall and is best known for his role as Leslie Chow in The Hangover.\n\nMany people don’t know this, but he’s also a licensed physician in the state of California!\n\nSeth Green\n\n5’4”\n\nAt 5’4”, Seth Green doesn’t let height get in the way of fame and fortune.\n\nHe’s been acting since he was just ten and has appeared in comedies such as Austin Powers and Without a Paddle.\n\nWhat’s more, he’s married to a gorgeous taller woman who loves short men.\n\nJackie Earle Haley\n\n5’5”\n\nAlthough not as well known as some of the short actors on this list, Haley has made quite a name for himself in Hollywood.\n\nStanding 5’5” tall, Earle Haley has acted in and produced famous films such as Watchmen, Little Children, and a Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nToby Jones\n\n5’5”\n\nIn an age of blockbuster-only movie stars, Jones is truly a well-rounded actor.\n\n5’5” English actor Tony Jones is one of greatest stage and screen actors both in the UK and abroad, starring in movies, television, and even Broadway musicals.\n\nGiancarlo Esposito\n\n5’8”\n\nGiancarlo Esposito, 5’8” tall, landed his first role at age eight back in 1966.\n\nThese days, though, he’s better known for his role as Gus on the TV series Breaking Bad.\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\n5’3”\n\nOkay, he’s not technically an actor, but Scorsese is still insanely talented and very famous in Hollywood.\n\nIn his more than fifty-year career, 5’3” Martin Scorsese has become arguably one of the most famous directors to hit the big screen, producing films such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nEmilio Estevez\n\n5’4 1/2”\n\nDucks fly together!
