        "text": "[on the mechanics of Hollywood and auditioning] Everything's nerve-wracking; you really shouldn't be in show business if you can't stand situations that are nerve-wracking, and you just have to learn to push that aside or rip it off and graft it onto your positive, creative energy. I mean, c'mon, I've been in 40, 50 movies and a bunch of TV shows. Someone asked a few months ago how many auditions I took, and I said, \"Boy, you got me. A lot, I guess. 700? 2,700? I don't know.\" And then I started thinking and realized, \"Boy, I guess that's a lot.\" You know what, either get some hard bark on you, or find another line."
