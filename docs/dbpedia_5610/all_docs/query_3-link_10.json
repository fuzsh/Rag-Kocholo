        "text": "There are tons of celebrities on the Upper West Side, and it’s certainly not hard to understand! Living on the Upper West Side can be quite relaxing compared to the rest of the city. The residential feel, the many exceptional Upper West Side restaurants and bars, and plus it borders Central Park.\n\nSo, it comes as no surprise that it’s one of the most popular neighborhoods for celebrities living in NYC. From brownstones, to modern luxury high rises, to pre-war co-ops – the UWS has something for everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Banderas\n\nThe movie star lives on the UWS, but maybe not for long. He’s been trying to sell his grand apartment at The Prasada — located at 50 Central Park West — for a bit over $7 million for several years now. The home (temporarily off the market, as of writing) is listed with The Corcoran Group (see it here).\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nThe king of comedy owns an impressive spread at the famous Beresford, located at 211 Central Park West (on the corner of 81st Street). This isn’t too far from his fictional TV address, which was 129 West 81st Street! Though it should come as no surprise that his real apartment is much bigger and better.\n\nHere are some other Seinfeld Locations of the Upper West Side!\n\nEllie Kemper\n\nThe hilarious and absolutely adorable star of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt purchased an Upper West Side co-op in 2016. Kemper and her husband bought the classic-six on West End Avenue for $2.8 million. Want to see what it looks like? Check out this article by 6 Square Feet!\n\nTrey Anastasio\n\nThe frontman for Phish is an Upper West Sider. In a 2009 interview with New York Magazine, which took place at Cafe Lalo, it was revealed that Trey Anastasio resides in the neighborhood with his wife and two daughters. It was also revealed that the jam-band king is a huge classical music fan, and an avid follower of The New York Philharmonic. In fact, he originally went to school to become a composer.\n\nA 2019 article by liveforlivemusic.com also confirmed he’s still in the neighborhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRandy Rainbow\n\nThe comedian and singer, famous for his viral videos, announced his departure from Queens in June 2019. He didn’t identify which Upper West Side building he moved into, which was probably a wise move. He had lived in Queens for 17 years, building his video empire out of a small Astoria apartment.\n\nTony Danza\n\nThe actor from “Who’s The Boss?” lives on the Upper West Side. And apparently, he really likes cleaning his apartment. According to an article published by The Real Deal, Danza grew up in East New York, Brooklyn, moved to LA to shoot eight seasons of Taxi in 1977, and in 2010, he permanently made the Upper West Side his home.\n\nMisty Copeland\n\nThe principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre bought a $3.125 million apartment at an Upper West Side condo in 2018. The three-bedroom home is located on West 88th Street. Copeland is noted for becoming the first black female dancer to be named principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre.\n\nLeslie Stefanson … and James Spader?\n\nActress Leslie Stefanson purchased a $4.3 million apartment at 2 West 67th Street in early 2017. She’s been in a relationship with James Spader for over 10 years, though it is unclear if he lives in the apartment with her.\n\nGayle King\n\nThe CBS reporter moved from Greenwich, CT to the Upper West Side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Shalhoub\n\nThe star of Monk purchased an 81st Street co-op with his wife in late 2016. The apartment came with two-bedrooms and was sold for just under $4 million.\n\nTim Gunn\n\nThe fashion icon and consultant, best known for producing and starring in Project Runway, designed his own Upper West Side apartment with all types of antiques and historical artifacts. Here’s an interview he did with Traditional Home, who he let in for an exclusive look!\n\nMichael Strahan\n\nThe television personality and former Giants star owns a townhouse on the Upper West Side. He revealed this in a 2017 interview with the New York Times, during which he told them what he loves most about the neighborhood:\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nThe actor and political activist owns an early 1900s, four-story townhouse in the West 80s off of Central Park West – one of the prettiest streets in NYC! The long-time NYC celebrity had previously owned a townhouse in Carrol Gardens which he sold for a loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan Peele\n\nThe co-star of “Key and Peele” and the director of “Get Out” is an Upper West Side native. He attended elementary school on the Upper West Side (both the Computer School and Calhoun) before going to college and becoming famous.\n\nJoel Coen and Frances McDormand\n\nThe producer and actress live in a co-op in the 70s on West End Ave. Coen of “Coen Brothers” fame has produced legendary hits including The Big Lebowski, Fargo, No Country For Old Men, Raising Arizona, and many, many more. McDormand also acted in Fargo, as well as in movies including Almost Famous, Something’s Gotta Give, and Primal Fear.\n\n(Joel is on the right).\n\nBobby Flay\n\nWhile it’s far from being his only residence, Bobby Flay owns a 1 bed, 1.5 bath apartment in a Riverside Boulevard building, which he purchased in 2008.\n\nJeff Daniels\n\nThe seasoned actor has an apartment on the top floor of a brownstone. Yep, a fourth floor walk up.\n\nBob Balaban\n\nThe actor, writer, director and producer lives with his wife at The Apthorp, located at 390 West End Avenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Guttenberg\n\nAccording to a NY Times feature, Guttenberg has lived in several different apartments in the same Lincoln Center condo for years. And, apparently, he likes to walk around naked. But after getting a number complaints, he stopped.\n\nSamantha Bee and Jason Jones\n\nThe couple purchased a $3.7 million co-op at 300 Riverside Drive in early 2017. Their apartment is on the top floor of the building and has four bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths, and they paid full asking price for it.\n\nAmy Schumer\n\nThis hilarious comedian has lived in two Upper West Side apartments. She purchased a 4,500 square foot penthouse at 190 Riverside Drive in 2016. This was a big-time upgrade from her previous pad, which was also pretty sweet (a brownstone floor-through on West 80th Street).\n\nKeanu Reeves\n\nThis Hollywood good guy, frequently spotted around NYC (including on the subways), owns an apartment on Central Park West. Apparently, though, he isn’t usually there.\n\nKyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon\n\nThe celebrity power couple have lived on the Upper West Side for years. According to a New York Post article, Kyra loves Central Park, butcher Hudson and Charles (at 555 Amsterdam), and Italian restaurant Gennaro (at 665 Amsterdam). She also shops at CPW, a clothing boutique at 495 Amsterdam.\n\nAnd Bacon, who has lived on the Upper West Side since 1976, has made it a point to be involved in the community. Back in 2012, he was part of a petition against a rooftop addition of a new condo on 82nd Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Oliver\n\nThe hilarious host of “Last Week Tonight” purchased a $10 million penthouse at 60 Riverside Boulevard in 2015.\n\nYoko Ono\n\nThe philanthropist and widow of John Lennon still lives in the same apartment they shared at the famous Dakota. The Beatle’s star was sadly killed outside of the building in 1980.\n\nMichael C. Hall\n\nThe star of Dexter purchased a 2 bedroom apartment at the El Dorado in late 2017. He picked up the pad, which features park views, a wood-burning fireplace and a 29 foot foyer, for $4.3 million.\n\nAlan Alda\n\nThis famous New Yorker and legendary actor owns three apartments in the Upper West Side’s Park Millenium condominium. His combined unit is located on the 51st floor of the building, located at 101 West 67th Street.\n\nAnne Hathaway\n\nAnne Hathaway has been an NYC celebrity for a while. The beautiful star of Les Miserables, Alice in Wonderland, and countless other hits purchased a $2.55 million penthouse in an Upper West Side co-op with her husband in early 2016, after selling their much larger loft in Dumbo’s Clocktower building.\n\nJoy Behar\n\nThe co-host of The View purchased an apartment at 62 West 62nd Street in late 2017, but Joy Behar has been an Upper West Sider for years, as her previous pad was located in a co-op on West 89th Street. This move will certainly cut down her commute to work, as The View is filmed at the ABC Studios on 66th and Columbus. Perhaps you’ll catch her dining at a fancy restaurant near Lincoln Center!\n\nHoward Stern\n\nThe legendary shock jock lives with his supermodel wife Beth Ostrovsky on the 53rd and 54th floors of the super luxury condo Millenium Tower (at 101 West 67th street). This is a convenient location for him, as his place of business is 1221 Sixth Ave (between 48th and 49th Streets).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBob Costas\n\nSports caster Bob Costas lives at 15 Central Park West with his wife; they reportedly moved from the nearby Time Warner Center in 2007. They bought their 15 CPW apartment for $11 million.\n\nTina Fey\n\nWho doesn’t want to live close to Tina Fey?! Or at least get a glimpse of her… The SNL actress and 30 Rock creator has lived with her husband in their UWS co-op at 300 West End Ave for years. In early 2016, Fey purchased the unit directly above her current apartment, ultimately creating an astonishing duplex with 22 windows! So cool.\n\nBono\n\nThat’s right – one of the biggest celebrities living in NYC has chosen the Upper West Side as his stomping grounds! This Irish sing-songwriter owns a top-floor duplex in Manhattan’s San Remo building. He purchased the apartment from Steve Jobs for $15 million in the late 80’s/early 90’s. He, his wife, and four children have lived there since.\n\nIt’s pretty cool to share a neighborhood with the guy considered as the top ten most influential celebrities (according to Time)!\n\nDonna Karan\n\nThis iconic designing queen has hailed from the UWS for many years. A resident of a building overlooking Central Park – which is fitting since her style is very zen and modern. A lot of stone accent ledges and furniture pieces keep the focus on all of the massive black and white photographs and paintings that lean or hang from the walls. Known as a person of habit and intention, it’s probably safe to say she will be hanging around the neighborhood for a while.\n\nDenzel Washington\n\nThis hunky, Oscar-winning New York native resides in 15 Central Park West. He purchased his apartment here for just over $13 million in 2006. 15 Central Park West was inspired by the designs of Rosario Candela, a 1920’s architect, and cost nearly $1 billion to build. Not only does this Training Day star reside here, but so too do many other New York celebrities, hedge funders and CEOs.\n\nBruce Willis\n\nThe “Die Hard” star has been an Upper West Sider since the 1970s. His most recent moves were in early 2018, when he sold his fourteen room duplex on Central Park West in exchange for a four-bedroom at One West End, which is a brand new building filled with amenities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Duchovny\n\nThe X-Files lead purchased a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom home at The Ardsley in 2012. The Ardsley is located at 320 Central Park West, between 91st and 92nd Streets. His apartment has a private elevator landing, terrace and a working fireplace. The apartment had been listed for $6.25 million.\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce\n\nThe actor who portrayed Dr. Niles Crane on Frasier owns three apartments with his husband at 260 West End Avenue. They purchased their first apartment in the co-op in 2005, and made their most recent purchase in 2012. Pierce has recently had roles in “West Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later”, “Julie’s Green Room” and “When We Rise”.\n\nSteve Martin\n\nThe legendary comic has lived at The San Remo for years, and in 2017 filed plans to renovate. The San Remo is located at 145-146 Central Park West, between 74th and 75th Streets. It has been home to many past celebrities, including Steve Jobs, Steven Spielberg and Barry Manilow.\n\nMaury Povich and Connie Chung\n\nThe talk show host and news anchor have an apartment at the exclusive Dakota at 1 West 72nd Street. I’m not sure if you knew they were a couple, but they are. And, clearly, they are very rich. If you have a day job, the Maury Povich show is a bit like Jerry Springer, in that the guests are people feuding over personal issues. A common theme is fathers taking paternity tests, many of whom are hoping to hear Maury say, “You are NOT the father!”.\n\nWhen it comes to celebrities on the Upper West Side … Maury IS one of them!\n\nRichard Kind\n\nYou might know him best for his role on Curb Your Enthusiasm as Larry’s cousin Andy. Or as Paul Lassiter from Spin City. Richard Kind lived on the UWS during his early acting days, and is now back in the neighborhood with his family.\n\nChristian Slater\n\nThe star of “Mr. Robot” grew up on the Upper West Side. After he sold his Hell’s Kitchen apartment in 2017, he moved back to his birth-neighborhood with his family.\n\nMadonna\n\nWhile her primary residence is in a mansion on the Upper East Side, Madonna owns at a co-op at 1 West 64th Street (also known as Harperley Hall), and boy has she had her fare share of feuds with the co-op board. These range from trying to buy too many apartments to letting her guests stay without her being there.\n\nEstelle Parsons\n\nThe acclaimed star of Bonnie and Clyde, as well as the actress who portrayed Roseanne’s mother, has chosen the charming Clebourne on West End Avenue as her residence.\n\nEric Schneiderman\n\nThe former New York Attorney General lives in a building on 92nd and West End Ave. After losing his position in 2018 from allegations of serious abuse towards women, reporters camped outside the building for several days.\n\nSo, now that you know who and where to look… NOW, all we need to do is practice our ‘play it cool’ face when you spot them shopping at Zabar’s or enjoying their Upper West Side brunch dates.\n\nFeatured social media image c/o Caroline Bonarde Ucci\n\nSharing is caring!"
