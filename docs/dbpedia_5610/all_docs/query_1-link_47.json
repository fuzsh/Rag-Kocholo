        "text": "Actor, comedian and author Larry Miller is one of Hollywood’s most recognizable faces. He has appeared in over 100 film and television shows, beginning his career with a memorable scene alongside Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in the blockbuster film, Pretty Woman. He has since gone on to unforgettable roles in such films as The Princess Diaries, The Nutty Professor, Bee Movie and 10 Things I Hate About You. He’s also a proud member of Christopher Guest’s ensemble cast in the films Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration.\n\nMiller has made dozens of appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman and Real Time with Bill Maher. He has also starred in his own HBO comedy specials and on Broadway in Neil Simon’s play, The Dinner Party. His other television credits include Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Medium, Burn Notice and Law & Order, in addition to a recurring role on Boston Legal. Miller is the also the only “bad guy” to return on Law and Order as an unrepentant – and uncatchable – wife killer."
