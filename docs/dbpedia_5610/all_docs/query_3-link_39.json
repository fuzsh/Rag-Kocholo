        "text": "You know about George Eastman, Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony — people who moved to Rochester and did great things.\n\nBut scores of people who were born here or in the surrounding area achieved excellence or made a mark on the world in some way, from Maud Humphrey, an acclaimed illustrator and the mother of film star Humphrey Bogart, to David Walentas, who rose from poverty to create Brooklyn’s DUMBO neighborhood and become a billionaire in the process.\n\nHere, in alphabetical order, are 24 notable people (and one dog) who were made in Rochester.\n\nAesha Ash\n\nBorn in Rochester in 1977, Aesha Ash started dancing at the age of 5, studying at the Joyce Winters School of Dance. She was accepted to the American School of Ballet in New York City at 14 and joined the New York City Ballet at 18. After seven years there, she moved to Switzerland and danced there before returning to the United States and retiring from performance in 2008. Three years later, she founded the Swan Dreams Project to encourage Black children to take up ballet. In 2020, she was chosen as the first Black female full-time instructor at the School of American Ballet in New York City.\n\nFrancis Bellamy\n\nThe author of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, Francis Bellamy was born in 1855 Mount Morris and graduated from the University of Rochester and the Rochester Theological Seminary.

After being introduced to Steve Martin by his New Yorker editor, he teamed with the actor and comedian on 2020’s “A Wealth of Pigeons,” a collection of cartoons written by Martin and drawn by Bliss. They followed it up in 2022 with “Number One is Walking: My Life in the Movies and Other Diversions.” Both books were New York Times bestsellers.

He would be cast in the show, marry the student, have three daughters with her and choose acting as a profession. A role in the 1965 Broadway production “Mrs. Dally Has a Lover” led to Forster being signed to a movie studio contract and roles on TV before entering what he described as a “27-year slump.” After “Jackie Brown,” he worked consistently and at a high level.

Named Twenty in honor of her new home, she became a fixture in the firehouse, raising morale during a terrible time. “She went on all the runs, she’d jump in the truck, stick her head out the window and bark,” one firefighter said. “She became a local celebrity.” Twenty also was a source of support at firefighter funerals.
