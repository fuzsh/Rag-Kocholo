        "text": "The actor: Larry Miller, a venerable stand-up comedian, improviser,\n\nand character actor who can be counted upon to improve every film or television\n\nshow he appears in. Since his breakthrough role as a store clerk in 1990's Pretty\n\nWoman, he's appeared in nearly a hundred movies and TV shows,\n\nincluding both Nutty Professors and Christopher Guest's Waiting For\n\nGuffman, Best In Show, A Mighty\n\nWind, and For Your Consideration.\n\nHe's also lent his voice to Dilbert, Bee Movie, and Dr.\n\nKatz, Professional Therapist. He can\n\ncurrently be seen in Get Smart, and he recently appeared in National\n\nLampoon's Senior Skip Day, which is out on\n\nDVD. A schedule of his stand-up appearances can be found at larrymillerhumor.com.\n\nFame (1982)—\"Emcee\"\n\nLarry Miller: I'll\n\ntell you something that's pretty neat. It's not necessarily an edgy story. My\n\nparents were staying with me—I'd just moved out about a year before to\n\nLos Angeles, and I auditioned for that role while they were staying with me in\n\nmy apartment. It was a typical comic's apartment, where you live on someone's\n\nfloor for eight weeks, and then that guy and your other friend help you find a one-bedroom\n\napartment for about $400 a month. So my parents were staying with me; they were\n\nsleeping in my bed, I was sleeping on the couch. I went in for this audition,\n\nand I just knew that it was good. I liked meeting these guys, and I started\n\ntalking about my parents staying, and how they couldn't believe how I was\n\nliving. About how I would buy cheap plates and throw them out instead of\n\ncleaning them. Just single-guy stuff. You know, my mom started to look for\n\nsomething to cook in the kitchen, and she said something like \"Where's your\n\ngarlic press?\" I looked at her and said, \"Garlic press? I don't have underwear,\n\nwhat are you talking about?\"\n\nBut we all laughed about it, and those guys laughed\n\nand enjoyed the audition. And as I was leaving the room, one of the producers\n\nsaid—and Hollywood is known to be a tough business, I guess every\n\nbusiness is tough—\"Hey!\" And I turned around, and he said, \"Tell your\n\nmother you did well.\" And I just smiled and said \"Thanks.\" And they smiled and\n\nnodded, and I got the part. It was filmed at an American Legion hall I passed\n\nevery day—it's very famous, a lot of things are shot there. I got a\n\nchance to work with Debbie Allen—see, I love this stuff, I really love\n\nit. People rolling around having fun; that was my first acting job. I love\n\nstand-up very much, and in fact, I'm going back on the road more now. But I've\n\nbeen lucky at all this stuff. I love acting and writing, and I have a book out\n\nnow that's done well, and I have Senior Skip Day coming out on DVD, and I had a great time doing that! I mean, I sound\n\nlike an idiot when I talk about these things, but I love this stuff.\n\nSenior Skip Day (2008)—\"Mr. Frankfurt Dickwalder\"\n\nLM: It's just funny. Again, I have to say this, and it sounds knuckleheaded,\n\nbut it's true: There isn't a day on the set, even on the ones that don't turn\n\nout that well, that I haven't loved. Because there isn't a day that I really\n\ndon't try—you know, you're writing something new, you say to the\n\ndirector, \"How about this? How about that?\" And people get to know what I bring\n\nto the party. It either annoys them or it doesn't. Evan Wasserstrom had written\n\nthe script, and I'd met the producer, George Gallo—this guy wrote Midnight\n\nRun, which I think is one of the best movies ever made. I put really\n\ngood comedies up there with Raging Bull\n\nor Sophie's Choice. To me, a\n\ngreat comedy and a warm comedy—a good buddy picture, if it's done well,\n\nit's as good as Casablanca.\n\nAVC: It's an undervalued genre.\n\nLM: In\n\nfact, come to think of it, Casablanca is a buddy movie. But at\n\nany rate, I came to this thing, and from the first day in the trailer, we had\n\nthe best time on the set. Nick Weiss, who was a first-time director, really\n\nsaid, \"Let's try and be good at this. Let's try and be fun. Let's try and find\n\nthings that work.\" And you know what? I think it does. Now, they didn't get a\n\ndistribution deal. It's not going to be at a theater near you. And that's the\n\nway it goes. It's not that it's smooth as silk, but it won't be an hour and a\n\nhalf wasted.\n\nAVC: That's the conundrum of the character\n\nactor. When you're doing something like that, are you focused on making your\n\nscenes as funny as possible, or serving the film as a whole?\n\nLM: There's\n\nsometimes a vaudevillian sense of comedy in American movies, in a good sense.\n\nMeaning, if someone says, \"Well, how did the dean in the Nutty Professor\n\nmovies get to be that angry at this guy?\" And the answer to give to that one\n\nis, \"You know what? He just is.\" Sometimes in comedy, like vaudeville, two guys\n\nwalk out there and say, \"Say, that's a funny hat you've got there,\" and bang,\n\nyou're just in the bit. But not in this one. One of the fun things was, I kept\n\npitching, and they agreed to do this, instead of like a Ferris Bueller's Day\n\nOff—which is a great movie, a\n\nseriously great movie and a classic—where the principal gets increasingly\n\nweak and shattered as it goes on, and is just destroyed by the end, I said, \"Why\n\ndon't we go in the exact opposite way, on an arc up?\" This guy starts out as a\n\nknucklehead, but as he gets bashed down, he becomes darker and darker until he\n\nemerges like from some alien cocoon, as this dark criminal lord who's going to\n\nwind up running a giant crime operation in Shanghai or something. His line goes\n\nstraight up, and that's why Clint Howard and I—he's playing a guy I\n\nmessed up when he was in high school, and he's coming to kill me, because he's\n\nbeen so angry in prison for so many years. But in just a short time, I'm able\n\nto grab him by the lapels and say, \"You don't even know what death is. Come\n\nwith me.\"\n\nWe had so much fun doing that, saying, \"Let's make\n\nthis guy into something we haven't really seen.\" And we kid around—you\n\nalways do—we said, \"Look, we know what the sequel is, if there's ever\n\ngoing to be one: This guy is set up with Clint Howard as his right-hand man in\n\nthe center of a giant crime world somewhere in Asia, where they're just\n\ndrinking snake venom.\" So at any rate, in this case, I had the best time every\n\nsingle day. It's not a high-budget movie. But pal, I'll tell you what—like\n\nyou guys there, like anything creative, every single day started, and I said, \"No\n\none has ever been this lucky!\"\n\nPretty Woman (1990)—\"Mr. Hollister\"\n\nLM: It was\n\ngreat. That's also probably a good instructional story for when people say, \"How\n\ndo I get parts? How many different ways do people get parts in things?\" In this\n\ncase, I was doing my job, I was onstage at the Improv, I was a comic here, and\n\nI had already been on the road a lot. I had already been in seven or eight\n\nplays, and I was also in a play at the time here in Los Angeles. I would go after\n\nthat play to the Improv to do a set, so my days were full. I was writing during\n\nthe day, so I felt good, 'cause I was like, \"Wow, I'm squeezing in every job\n\nhere!\"\n\nThere was a casting woman named Dori Zuckerman. She\n\nwas doing her job too, going to plays in Los Angeles, and going to The Improv,\n\nso when [director] Garry Marshall said to her, \"Do you know of any interesting\n\ncharacter actors who haven't been seen yet who could work around, dance around\n\nwith me?\" she said \"I think I do,\" and she brought me in. That was her doing\n\nher job, and being good at it. So I sat down with Garry Marshall, and we just\n\nriffed on a bunch of improv things, which is what the whole part was, by the way.\n\nThere was nothing written, which is why I love working with the guy. Garry\n\nMarshall is one of the funniest guys in the world. All he has to do is open his\n\nmouth, and he's funny. There's nothing ever written. He just says, \"Well, okay,\n\nyou come in, and then you hug her, and action.\" So he hired me for that part. And\n\nthen on the day we shot it, he said, \"All right, when they come up, you want to\n\nkiss his ass a lot. We'll have you walk into him, and you'll tap him on the\n\nshoulder and say \"Who are you\" and \"I'm looking for the manager.\" It's cool, 'cause\n\neveryone on the set, even though I had very little experience or none, everyone\n\nknew you just started coming up with stuff. It's just little things, all\n\nimprov, like calling out to other saleswomen: \"Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary\n\nFrancis, Tova,\" ya know? Little things that strike me as funny. It was good\n\nluck. And regardless of me being in the thing, I think that's going to be\n\nreally entertaining, I think it's a movie that's going to be terrific for\n\nanother 500 years.\n\nAVC Did it do a lot for your career?\n\nLM: I don't\n\nsee things like that. To me, it's more of a grade up in life. I don't recall\n\nthat the phone was ringing off the hook. It was just a good steady grade up. It's\n\nnot like being on the first Tonight Show as a comic. It's not\n\nlike something cracks open.\n\nAVC: It's more of a steady evolution?\n\nLM: Exactly.\n\nIt's like hopefully putting a brick in the wall every day, and then a show like\n\nthat is like 10 bricks on a given day. And then one day, theoretically, someone\n\ndrives by and says, \"Look at that wall.\"\n\nCarry On Columbus (1992)—\"The Chief\"\n\nLM: That's\n\nso much fun. Gerald Thomas was an English director who directed a series, very\n\npopular in England, called Carry On. There were something like 28\n\nof them: Carry On Doctor, Carry On Nurse, Carry On this, Carry On that. As you know, the English really just have two\n\nextremes… There's no real middle ground.\n\nAVC: It's either Monty Python or Benny Hill.\n\nLM:\n\nExactly. It's either something really smart and thinly sliced and ironic and witty,\n\nor it's \"Holy mackerel, she doesn't have a blouse on.\" But that's fine, that's\n\ncool. So in this case, they wanted to tell their Columbus story too, with Jim\n\nDale, a very big Broadway star at the time, playing Columbus. One of the jokes\n\nwas that they wanted all the Indians to have American accents. It's something\n\nAbbott and Costello used to do, where they're looking for directions, and Lou\n\nsees an Indian standing there way out in the West, and he goes to this very\n\nslow way of speaking, \"Excuse me, I'm looking for this road that goes here.\" And\n\nthe chief just turns to Abbott and says, \"What's wrong with him, what's he\n\ntalking about?\"\n\nThat's what they wanted, so that when Columbus\n\ncomes to the New World, the Indians would be American comics. I was the chief\n\nthere, and you know what? The coolness of that was, not only did I get a\n\nterrific job and get to go to England—and by the way, their commissary\n\nthere on the lots had the worst food in the world, but it was always connected\n\nto a really nice pub, and everyone there on the crew used to go and have two or\n\nthree pints for lunch. But the thing about the lots was, it was at Pinewood\n\nStudios. Pinewood Studios is like Ealing for all the great English comedies of\n\nthe '50s. This studio was completely in disrepair, and it was very sad to me. And\n\nthere was nothing working on it, nothing. There were studios, giant concrete\n\nbuildings that had weeds growing through them, and the fountains at all these\n\nplaces were overgrown. It was like we had gone 500 years into some Mad Max future where everything had just gone to seed.\n\nIt was a little sad, but it was neat to think, \"I'm\n\nat Pinewood Studios. I'm working at Pinewood Studios, I get picked up every day,\n\nand I'm taken to Pinewood Studios.\"\n\nAVC: Carry On Columbus was an attempt to revive the Carry\n\nOn franchise, but it didn't go\n\naccording to plan.\n\nLM: A lot\n\nof things don't in life, whether it's show business or not. But you know what? It's\n\na nice effort. So many efforts that people put their hearts into are not for\n\nthe right reasons. So many times, when people get together in rooms, what they're\n\nreally saying is, \"All right, if we kidnap everyone, we can slice their heads\n\noff.\" So here is a case where people got together and said, \"You know what? Maybe\n\nwe can make a lot of these comedies again.\" Well it didn't work, but they\n\ntried, and I was awfully glad to be a part of it.\n\nAVC: Both of the Columbus movies flopped, so the\n\nmarket for a Columbus parody may not have been as strong as they might have\n\nimagined a year earlier.\n\nLM: That's\n\nvery funny and true. And by the way, I've seen both of the others; one had [Marlon]\n\nBrando. God bless him and all, but he wasn't very good in that.\n\nAVC: That might have been at the point where he\n\nhad a hearing aid installed that would feed his lines to him.\n\nLM: I'm\n\nsorry to hear that, because I'm one of those people—I know the old\n\nsaying, but when it comes to art I want to say, almost shout at the sky, \"Why\n\ndid you do that for all those years? Why didn't you do what we all wanted you\n\nto do, which is make another hundred movies and just knock them off and be an\n\nactor, and love being an actor,\" do you know what I mean? We didn't want you to\n\nsit around in a robe on an island eating bread.\n\nAVC: At a certain point, he just seems to have\n\nstopped caring.\n\nLM: I only\n\nknow this from reading biographies and such, but he felt that way when he was\n\ndoing Streetcar on Broadway, 1949 or something. He'd say, \"Oh, I\n\nhate going in, it's just the same stupid business, let the understudy do it,\"\n\nhe'd come in late and be drunk. But don't you understand you thrill people, and\n\nthat's really good?\n\n[pagebreak]\n\nRadioland Murders (1994)—\"Herman Katzenback\"\n\nLM: It was\n\nanother thing that didn't work out the way they wanted, but I had a great part.\n\nIt was a George Lucas-produced movie. He said there were three movies he wanted\n\nto make when he first came to town: Star Wars, Raiders Of The\n\nLost Ark, and Radioland Murders. Mel Smith, who was a terrific, funny English actor,\n\ndirected this, and it shows you again that storytelling is sometimes—the\n\nfirst image that came to my mind was pitching. When a pitcher just can't hit\n\nthe strike zone for six, seven, eight pitches in a row, it seems like he'll\n\nnever throw a strike in his life. You just say \"How is it even possible to\n\nthrow a strike? It's too small.\" But then you start grooving it, and you say, \"Oh,\n\nthis is how.\" And in this case, boy we had a terrific time, we did our best\n\nthere, I had the chance to be—speaking of film history, I said to Mel on\n\nthe first day of shooting, \"It may not fit, but I was thinking of playing him\"—the\n\nmanager of the radio station in 1936 or something, where everyone's very official,\n\nI said, \"Suppose he's a German, suppose he's very officious and imperious and\n\nannoying, just yelling at everybody?\" [Affects German accent.] And I start\n\ndoing this accent, and he said, \"That's a good accent, you want to do it?\" And\n\nI said, \"Well, that's Sig Ruman from the Marx brothers' Night At The\n\nOpera.\" He said, \"Sounds great,\" because he\n\nknew the movie too. So whatever it's worth, I had a great time doing Sig Ruman\n\nfor three weeks in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nAVC: Was Lucas a hands-on producer? Was he on\n\nthe set a lot?\n\nLM: Not all\n\nthe time, but when he was, it was—deservedly so, all the actors, crew,\n\nand ADs were like 9-year-olds when word came around, \"George is on the set\n\ntoday.\" He came around and directed some second-unit stuff that I was in, and\n\nit was pretty neat. I've never been able to resist, with great actors I admire—you're\n\ngoing to try to be cool, but I've never been able to resist finding a chance to\n\ngo over and say, \"Oh, Mr. Lucas, oh, I think you're great. I know you hear this\n\na lot, but I have to shake your hand and say, boy, you've done some great stuff.\"\n\nHe's gracious, but I've never been able to resist that with a great actor I admire—not\n\non the first day, necessarily, but finding a place or time to say, \"Hey, let me\n\nask you something, your accent is great, where did you find that?\"\n\nSeinfeld (1995)—George Costanza finalist\n\nAVC: According to the IMDB, you came very close\n\nto getting the role of George Costanza on Seinfeld. What was that process like?\n\nLM: This\n\nisn't going to sound very interesting, but all things come down the same way. Everything's\n\nnerve-racking—you really shouldn't be in show business if you can't stand\n\nsituations that are nerve-wracking, and you just have to learn to push that\n\naside or rip it off and graft it onto your positive, creative energy. I mean, c'mon,\n\nI've been in 40, 50 movies and a bunch of TV shows. Someone asked a few months\n\nago how many auditions I took, and I said, \"Boy, you got me. A lot, I guess. 700?\n\n2,700? I don't know.\" And then I started thinking and realized, \"Boy, I guess\n\nthat's a lot.\" You know what, either get some hard bark on you, or find another\n\nline. With Seinfeld, it happened more or less like anything. It\n\ncame down to me and Jason [Alexander], and would I have rather gotten the part?\n\nSure, every actor would always rather get any part, but also, Jerry and I are\n\nfriends, we knew each other from the early days. You know what I've always had\n\na lot of faith in? Number one, my friends are good at what they do, and they do\n\ntheir best. And they have 50 people, and everyone makes a decision, and you\n\nknow what, that's the right thing to happen. Would I be happier today or a\n\nbetter man if I had a jillion dollars?\n\nAVC: My father would say yes.\n\nLM: That's\n\na funny father thing to say, but I bet you he knows a deeper truth to that, and\n\nI bet you do too. No, you wouldn't. You wouldn't sleep better. It wouldn't help\n\npeople like you more, or help you like them more. It wouldn't help me write better, it wouldn't\n\nmake me perform better tonight at the club I'm going to. It wouldn't make me be\n\na better actor two days ago on the job I just finished, or on one I'm starting\n\nin a couple weeks. Obviously, Seinfeld is a giant show, one of the greatest shows ever made. The writing, the\n\nacting, the combination, could they have cast that any better? Of course not. Could\n\nthey have gotten four people who were more iconically perfect for those parts\n\nat that chunk of life? I know I've always made the best decisions I could, and hit\n\nthe ball as far as I could. And you know what? When it drops, it's okay with\n\nme.\n\nWaiting For Guffman (1996)—\"Glenn Welsch, Mayor\"\n\nLM: I sure\n\nhave a lot of respect for those guys. Guffman is a very good\n\nmovie, it's awfully good, and again, it has nothing to do with me. I just got a\n\ncall one day at home here writing, and it was Christopher Guest, and that's a\n\npretty neat call to get. He was talking to some of the folks over there, and\n\nthey were already in production, and someone said I might be good in this,\n\nwould I like to come down and play with them. I said of course. They put a\n\nreally good group of knuckleheads together, and it was just great to be funny\n\nthat way, but also to get to know this group of folks. When one of these things\n\nis made every two or three years, it's just a cool show-business call to get\n\nwhen you say \"Hello?\" and you hear [Imitates Guest's voice.] \"Hello, Larry, it's\n\nChristopher.\" So that's cool, and I know all the other actors are the same on\n\nthis, this is one deal where everyone just tells their agents and managers,\n\n\"Whatever they send, we're just going to do it,\" no one's going to talk about\n\nit or make offers or counter-offers. They've been very generous. They just send\n\nmoney, and if the movie's done well—no one's ever done this in show\n\nbusiness. After five or seven months, you get a check, and everyone gets a\n\nlittle hunk of this. And it's not little, either, it's some good dough, it's\n\nmoney you live on. And if there's more naturally funny people on the earth than\n\nChristopher Guest and Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, I'd like to know who\n\nthey are.\n\nBlonde Ambition (2007)—\"Ronald Connelly\"\n\nLM: I like\n\nthat, I really mean it. Scott Marshall directed that, Garry Marshall's son, and\n\nI really dig the guy. We got a cool time on the set. He knows me, he knows my\n\nwork. Ad-lib, rewrite, do everything fast, and I love working with Jessica\n\nSimpson. You know why? She's a young woman, she's obviously holding seven\n\ntigers by the reins here, who knows what life is like when you're in that\n\nworld? And she was very nice, very gracious, very cool, and she knew how to\n\ndance, so to speak. If Scotty and I could come over and say \"Let's do this, let's\n\ntry this four different ways, you'll come over and he'll say this,\" whatever\n\nshe did was fine, because she was going to go along with the stuff we could do.\n\nI think it's probably a good story and well told, and I had a good time with\n\nLuke Wilson. You know, it's a movie. And I'm a huge fan and friend of Penelope\n\nAnn Miller, and also Penny Marshall who was there. C'mon, it was great. You\n\nspend a week strolling around with these folks having a coffee here or there.\n\nAVC: It takes two people to improvise."
