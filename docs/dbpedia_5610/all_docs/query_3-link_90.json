        "text": "01 of 30\n\nKirk Douglas\n\nThe late Kirk Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch in upstate New York, the son of poor and illiterate Russian immigrants Herschel and Bryna, who later went by Harry and Bertha.\n\nHe told PEOPLE in 2015 that, before pursuing a career in show business, he changed his name because his given name was too unwieldy and too Jewish for Hollywood at the time.\n\n\"I wish I had kept it,\" he said, looking back on the decision. \"It's more interesting to keep your original name. But can you imagine that name on a marquee?\"\n\nThe Douglas name carried over to Kirk's son, Michael Douglas, whose name would force another actor on this list to adopt a name change.\n\n02 of 30\n\nDove Cameron\n\nBorn Chloe Celeste Hoffman, the actress legally changed her name to Dove as a tribute to her late father, who called her that as a nickname.\n\n\"He called me Dove more than he ever called me Chloe,\" she told StyleWatch. \"He passed away when I was 15, and I decided to legally change it. So it's on my passport — everything legal is Dove.\"\n\nHowever, she shared on Twitter in September 2017 that she responds to both names, and friends and family still call her Chloe.\n\n03 of 30\n\nJohn Legend\n\nBorn John Roger Stephens, the singer's stage name comes from a childhood nickname that stuck.\n\n\"John Legend is a nickname that some friends started calling me, and it kind of grew into my stage name,\" he told MTV in 2008. \"It grew to the point where more people in my circle would know me by that name than by my real name.\"\n\n04 of 30\n\nMeg Ryan\n\nRyan's moniker might sound short and sweet, but her real name is quite a mouthful: Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra.\n\nShe began using her grandmother's maiden name, \"Ryan,\" as a surname when she joined the Screen Actors Guild, Entertainment Weekly reported.\n\n05 of 30\n\nAudrey Hepburn\n\nThe origins of Hepburn's true name are shrouded in mystery. Sources have disagreed on the exact birthname of the Belgian-born actress, but The New York Times reported she was born Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston.\n\nThe names Edda, Audrey (the English form of the Dutch name Edda) and Andrey (a feminine form of Andrew) can be found in different biographies, although Edda is found most frequently, according to Britannica.\n\nSources do agree, however, that Hepburn's mother was the Dutch baroness Ella van Heemstra and that her British father's surname was Ruston, though he went by the more aristocratic-sounding name Hepburn-Ruston, believing he was a descendant of Mary, Queen of Scots, the encyclopedia reports.\n\n06 of 30\n\nVin Diesel\n\nApparently, the name Mark Sinclair didn't sound tough enough for the actor when he worked as a New York City bouncer before his big break.\n\nThe action star shortened his mother's maiden name Vincent to get his new first name. As for \"Diesel,\" he once revealed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien that he got the nickname from friends who said he was always full of energy.\n\n07 of 30\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nTrinidadian-born rapper Minaj's stage moniker is a shortened version of her real name, Onika Tanya Maraj.\n\n08 of 30\n\nCalvin Harris\n\nFans might have raised an eyebrow when Taylor Swift thanked her then-boyfriend \"Adam\" at the 2016 iHeartRadio Awards — but Harris goes by Adam Richard Wiles when he's not spinning records.\n\nThe Scottish musician told the Shortlist in 2009 that he decided to change his name \"to exploit the racial ambiguity of his stage name,\" according to Esquire.\n\n\"My first single was more of a soul track, and I thought Calvin Harris sounded a bit more racially ambiguous,\" he said. \"I thought people might not know if I was Black or not. After that, I was stuck with it.\"\n\n09 of 30\n\nCharlie Sheen\n\nMartin Sheen's youngest son, Carlos Irwin Estevez, adopted his father's stage name when he began acting using the name Charlie.\n\nIn contrast, Charlie's siblings — Emilio, Ramón and Renée — who are all actors, continue to use their Spanish last name, Estévez.\n\n10 of 30\n\nDiane Keaton\n\nKeaton's real surname is Hall, as in Annie Hall, the character she played in the Woody Allen film of the same name, which won her an Oscar in 1978. Allen wrote the role specifically for the actress, whom he had previously dated, taking her real last name and combining it with her nickname, Annie, according to Stig Björkman's Woody Allen on Woody Allen: In Conversation with Stig Björkman.\n\nThe Marvin's Room star originally changed her surname to Keaton, her mother's maiden name, because there was another actress named Diane Hall in the Actors' Equity Association, according to Vogue.\n\n11 of 30\n\nOlivia Wilde\n\nPaying tribute to Oscar Wilde, one of her favorite authors, actress Olivia Jane Cockburn legally changed her last name to Wilde when she began acting.\n\n12 of 30\n\nKaty Perry\n\nThe pop star was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson but changed her name so she wouldn't be confused with actress Kate Hudson (though Perry released her self-titled first album under the name \"Katy Hudson\" in 2001). Perry is her mother's maiden name.\n\n13 of 30\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nCyrus legally changed her name from Destiny Hope to Miley Ray (a rendition of her childhood nickname \"Smiley\") in 2008.\n\n14 of 30\n\nNina Dobrev\n\nBulgarian actress Dobrev shortened her name from Nikolina Konstantinova Dobreva.\n\n15 of 30\n\nJamie Foxx\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor was born Eric Marlon Bishop but changed his name to the more gender-ambiguous Jamie Foxx during his stand-up days.\n\nThe actor-comedian chose the more feminine-sounding name because female comedians were often called to the stage first, Yahoo! reports.\n\nHe chose \"Foxx\" in honor of Sanford and Son star Redd Foxx.\n\n16 of 30\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nThe actor's parents changed the family's last name from Bottom to Phoenix in the late 1970s to represent a new beginning.\n\n17 of 30\n\nBruno Mars\n\nBorn Peter Gene Hernandez, he later told Latina magazine, \"My dad nicknamed me Bruno since I was 2 years old.\"\n\n\"I was going to go by 'Bruno,' one name. Mars just kind of came joking around because that sounds bigger than life. That was it, simple as that.\"\n\nMars would later reveal that his father nicknamed him \"Bruno\" after professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.\n\n18 of 30\n\nMichael Keaton\n\nThe actor was forced to change his last name from Douglas to Keaton to enter the actor's union since his birth name, Michael Douglas, was already taken by a future Academy Award-winning actor.\n\n19 of 30\n\nTom Cruise\n\nHe might be the only Tom Cruise in Hollywood, but not in his family! The actor's birth name is Thomas Cruise Mapother IV. He began using his middle name as a surname at the behest of an agent.\n\n20 of 30\n\nDemi Moore\n\nSometimes less is Moore! Born Demetria Gene Guynes, the actress shortened her first name to just Demi. The star's last name is a holdover from her first marriage to singer Freddy Moore.\n\n21 of 30\n\nWhoopi Goldberg\n\nBorn Caryn Elaine Johnson, the Oscar-winning actress explained that her stage name \"Whoopi\" comes from the whoopee cushion.\n\n\"If you get a little gassy, you've got to let it go. So people used to say to me, 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from,\" she told The New York Times in 2006.\n\nGoldberg is her mother's maiden name, which she opted to use in the hope of being taken more seriously.\n\n\"My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name, it's part of my family, part of my heritage. Just like being Black,\" she revealed to The Jewish Chronicle in 2011.\n\n22 of 30\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nIt's hard to imagine the iconic actress by any other name, but Monroe went by several different monikers throughout her life, even before she landed in Hollywood.\n\nMonroe was baptized Norma Jeane Baker, but the name on her birth certificate was Norma Jeane Mortenson. It changed again after she married James Dougherty and adopted his surname.\n\nShe didn't legally change her name to Marilyn Monroe until 1956, although she had been publicly known by the moniker since 1946. Ben Lyon, a 20th Century Fox executive, gave her the name Marilyn because she reminded him of actress Marilyn Miller. She picked Monroe after her mother's maiden name.\n\nShe later went by Marilyn Monroe Miller after marrying author Arthur Miller in 1956.\n\n23 of 30\n\nNatalie Portman\n\nBorn Neta-Lee Hershlag, the Israeli-American actress took her paternal grandmother's maiden name, \"Portman,\" as her stage name for privacy reasons.\n\n24 of 30\n\nAlicia Keys\n\nTurns out, the singer's name and impressive piano skills are no coincidence! Keys changed her name from Alicia Augello Cook to reflect her love of music.\n\n25 of 30\n\nWinona Ryder\n\nThe actress changed her last name from Horowitz when asked how she would like to have her name appear on the credits of her first role. She suggested Ryder as Mitch Ryder's album was playing in the background.\n\n26 of 30\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nNo, Aniston's real name is not secretly Rachel Green — it's Jennifer Linn Anastassakis! Her Greek father, actor John Aniston, changed the family's last name when he went into show business.\n\n27 of 30\n\nElton John\n\nBorn Reginald Kenneth Dwight, the singer started going by the name Elton John in honor of two blues legends: saxophonist Elton Dean and singer Long John Baldry. As he grew to \"dislike\" his birth name, he legally changed his name in May 1972, adding the middle name \"Hercules.\"\n\n\"When I became Elton John, it was like a new lease on life,\" he said in a 1987 interview, The Daily Express reported. \"I didn't particularly like being Reg Dwight. It had too many unhappy memories.\"\n\nHe added, \"I hated the word 'Reg,' anyway.
