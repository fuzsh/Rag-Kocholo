        "text": "Originally posted by Unregistered View Post\n\nMiller does not attend tournaments. Miller was so concerned about being identified at tournaments that he went out of his way to make sure that you never see pictures of him. His daughters' Facebook account never had pictures of their parents.\n\nMiller used to have a habit of wearing a concealed camera/microphone at some events and recording people talking about others.\n\nI have met him. Slightly hunched over (think Chuck Schumer), he stands around 5'10\", mostly bald with some gray hair and scraggly facial hair, weighing about 180+ pounds. His attire is generously described as unkepmt. Miller eats like a slob and winds up spraying plenty because he never shuts up during a meal. He has the attention span of a flea unless you are talking about exactly what he wants to talk about.\n\nOriginally posted by Unregistered View Post\n\nOne time he was blogging about a camp. I sent players there, almost a whole team years before he started promoting them. Great staff, wonderful everything except if it rained they had no options for fields. I wrote that in and it never got published. I contacted him directly at first a few nice emails back and forth until I won the argument and then the phone call. What a scared little man he really is."
