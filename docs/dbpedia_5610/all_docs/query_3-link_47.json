        "text": "“I got lucky,” Matt Damon once said of his bride, Luciana Barroso. “I fell in love with a civilian.” Sure, it’s sweet to think that opposites attract, but the likelihood of a Hollywood star and an average Joe (or Jane!) getting together seems like a better fit for a story that unfolds on the big screen—which makes the times that it does happen all the more romantic. For proof that there’s plenty of love to be found beyond the limelight, here we’re taking a look at 20 couples who demonstrate that love knows no star power (or lack thereof).\n\nTaylor Lautner and Taylor Dome\n\nMarried: Late 2020\n\nBefore the Twilight star met his match, he met her family. Taylor Lautner's sister, Makena Moore, became friends with Dome after meeting her at a Nashville church and set her up with Lautner. \"Think I picked out a good one for my brother,\" Moore wrote in an Instagram post celebrating their engagement. Dome is a registered nurse who worked during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June, she launched The Lemons Foundation, a nonprofit focused on mental-health support and advocacy. She also created the blog Lemons by Tay and a podcast co-hosted with Lautner called \"The Squeeze,\" both of which discuss prioritizing mental health and wellness.\n\nRiz Ahmed and Fatima Farheen Mirza\n\nMarried: Late 2020\n\nThis actor-writer pair made waves at the 2021 Oscars when Ahmed stopped to fix Mirza’s hair, and their meet-cute was no less romantic: the two met at the same table in a coffee shop. As Ahmed recalled on The Tonight Show, “We were both jostling over the same laptop plug points.” A secret pandemic wedding followed: “We did it in a backyard, which is nice in lots of ways,” Ahmed revealed. “And I think the nicest thing about it was you didn’t have 500 aunties hanging around you, pinching your cheeks.”\n\nMeryl Streep and Don Gummer\n\nMarried: September 1978\n\nYou might expect one of Hollywood’s greatest living actresses to have a spouse similarly high up in the entertainment industry, but that’s not the case for Meryl Streep; her husband, Don Gummer, is a sculptor, and the pair have four children together. “First, I’m going to thank Don, because when you thank your husband at the end of the speech they play him out with the music, and I want him to know that everything I value most in our lives, you’ve given me,” Streep said in 2012, as she accepted the best-actress Oscar for her role in The Iron Lady.\n\nEllen Pompeo and Chris Ivery\n\nMarried: June 2012\n\nBaldwin and Thomas were first introduced in February 2011 at Pure Food and Wine, a since-closed vegan restaurant in Union Square. As Thomas recapped the event for the couple’s New York Times wedding announcement: “I was standing near the door with my friends when he walked up and took my hand and said, ‘I must know you.’ ” (The actor has since admitted his opening line was “none too clever.”) Thomas was 27 years old and working as an instructor at Yoga Vida, a studio she helped open upon graduating from NYU. “I saw right away that she was very dedicated,” Baldwin told the Times. “She’s the yoga queen of the Village.”\n\nVince Vaughn and Kyla Weber\n\nMarried: January 2010\n\nVaughn’s movie-producer friend reportedly introduced him to Weber at a wedding in 2008. A former Calgarian from rural Alberta, Weber was raised on a small farm in Blackie (population est. 400) and worked as a real estate agent. “Because she lived far away, at first I was nervous to date her because it’s one of my best friends’ wife’s best friend from childhood…. If it goes wrong, you’re talking about awkward,” Vaughn said during an appearance on Live! with Regis and Kelly. “She’s a civilian, which is good.” According to Vaughn, they started off by exchanging emails and phone calls, and they’ve been inseparable ever since.\n\nChristian Bale and Sibi Blazic\n\nMarried: January 2000\n\nBlazic was working as personal assistant to Winona Ryder when she met Bale, according to reports, at one of the actress’s barbecues. They later eloped in Las Vegas, and an Elvis impersonator reportedly officiated the marriage; Bale was 26 years old and Blazic was 30. When Bale won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role for The Fighter, he told reporters: “I get choked up about that stuff…. [My wife] had to be married to so many different characters over our marriage. I know that it truly would be impossible to do it without her. She’s such a good, strong woman.” Case in point: The following year Blazic was a stunt driver in The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nPaul Rudd and Julie Yaeger\n\nMarried: February 2003\n\nAfter his breakout role in Clueless (1995), Rudd moved to New York and, on the advice of Amy Heckerling, the film’s director, got a publicist. When he arrived to the city, Rudd went straight to his publicist’s office, where Yaeger also worked as a publicist herself. As Rudd was late for an audition, Yaeger offered to drop Rudd’s bags at his friend’s apartment. A few days later, hardly knowing a single soul in Manhattan, he asked her out for lunch, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nGeorge Clooney and Amal Alamuddin\n\nMarried: September 2014\n\nLong considered one of Hollywood’s most infamous bachelors, Clooney fell in love with Lebanese-British human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin when a mutual friend brought her by his Lake Como home. After marrying Clooney in Venice in 2014, Alamuddin gave birth to a set of twins, Ella and Alexander, in 2017.\n\nJennifer Lawrence and Cooke Maroney\n\nMarried: October 2019\n\nLawrence and art dealer Cooke Maroney now epitomize power-couple style. The couple met through a mutual friend in 2018; one year later they got married at a 150-person ceremony in Rhode Island (to which the bride wore Dior of course).\n\nAmy Schumer and Chris Fischer"
