But with more than 100 film and TV credits on his resume, Miller has made a career of sometimes short but memorable roles on screen in Pretty Woman, Ten Things I Hate About You, The Nutty Professor, Boston Legal, Seinfeld, Law and Order, Desperate Housewives, and as a member of the ensemble in Christopher Guest’s masterpieces Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration and Waiting For Guffman, to name a few.\n\nMiller is a renaissance man: a standup comedian with HBO specials, a Broadway stage actor, a podcast host of This Week with Larry Miller, a humorist who has published in The Huffington Post, Maxim, The Weekly Standard, and the author of the 2006 book Spoiled Rotten America. His one-man show, Cocktails With Larry Miller, still tours as well.\n\nLarry Miller performs his stand-up act at the Paramount Theatre in Middletown Oct. 26."
