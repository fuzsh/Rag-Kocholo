        "text": "Jason Momoa, Auli'i Cravalho, Cliff Curtis, And 16 Other Polynesian Actors Who Are Taking Over Hollywood\n\nTaika Waititi's out here doing the Lord's work.\n\nWhile Hollywood still has a long way to go in terms of diversity, recent years have seen more and more Polynesian actors in major roles. And as a Samoan woman, I love to see it!\n\nSo here are 19 Polynesian actors making big moves in Hollywood:\n\n1. Jason Momoa\n\nBorn in Hawaiʻi, Jason is Native Hawaiian on his father's side and German, Irish, and Pawnee on his mother's. After the world fell in love with him in Game of Thrones, he went on to star in Frontier, See, and the Aquaman movies. In May, we'll get to see him join the Fast and Furious franchise in Fast X. And I cannot wait for his upcoming show, Chief of War.\n\n2. KJ Apa\n\nThe New Zealand–born actor is of Samoan and European heritage, and he received his matai (chief) title last year. He became a household name by playing Archie Andrews on Riverdale, but you can also find him in The Hate U Give and I Still Believe. And did you know that KJ is a talented musician? In 2021, he released an indie folk-rock album called Clocks.\n\n3. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson\n\nDwayne is Samoan on his mother's side and Black on his father's. After gaining fame as a WWE wrestler, he became the Hollywood star we know and love today. He's been in everything from the Fast and Furious franchise to Moana to the Jumanji movies. And last year, he became the first Samoan to play a superhero with Black Adam!\n\n4. Taika Waititi\n\nBorn in New Zealand, Taika is Māori on his father's side and Russian Jewish on his mother's. Is there anything this man can't do? He wrote, directed, and starred in both What We Do in the Shadows and Jojo Rabbit, for which he became the first Māori filmmaker to win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. He directed several of Marvel's Thor movies and an episode of The Mandalorian. Currently, he writes for the show he co-created, Reservation Dogs. And his film Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a masterpiece! Do yourself a favor and watch it if you're ever in need of a laugh.\n\n5. Auli'i Cravalho\n\nBorn in Hawaiʻi, Auli'i is of Native Hawaiian, Puerto Rican, Portuguese, Chinese, and Irish heritage. After making her acting debut as the voice of Moana, Auli'i returned to Disney as Ariel in ABC's live-action concert rendition of The Little Mermaid. Since then, she's starred in the drama film All Together Now and teen comedy show Darby and the Dead. And she'll be playing Janis in the upcoming Mean Girls movie musical!\n\n6. Cliff Curtis\n\nThe Māori actor is known for powerful New Zealand films like Whale Rider and The Dark Horse, as well as his long Hollywood career. He's been in tons of stuff, including Live Free or Die Hard, Fear the Walking Dead, and Hobbs & Shaw. Most recently, he played Tonowari, the chief of the Metkayina clan, in Avatar: The Way of Water.\n\n7. Jemaine Clement\n\nThe New Zealand–born actor is of Māori and European descent. He was sooo funny in Flight of the Conchords! Jemaine joined Taika Waititi as an actor, writer, and director in What We Do in the Shadows. He's done tons of voice work for animated movies, including Despicable Me, Rio, Moana, and The Lego Batman Movie. He's also been in hits like Men in Black 3 and Avatar: The Way of Water.\n\n8. Rose Matafeo\n\nBorn in New Zealand, Rose is Samoan on her father's side and Croatian and Scottish on her mother's. This woman can do it all — she's an actor, writer, comedian, director, and podcast host. You can find her stand-up special, Horndog, and comedy series, Starstruck, on HBO Max.\n\n9. Cooper Andrews\n\nOn his father's side, the actor is Samoan, and on his mother's, he's Hungarian Jewish. Best known for playing Jerry on The Walking Dead, Cooper was also in Halt and Catch Fire and the Shazam movies.\n\n10. Alex Aiono\n\nAlex is Samoan and Māori on his father's side and white on his mother's. After gaining a massive following on YouTube for his music, he landed a starring role in Finding Ohana. He plays Walter in Doogie Kameāloha, M.D. and Alex in Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin.\n\n11. Kelly Hu\n\nBorn in Hawaiʻi, Kelly is of Native Hawaiian, Chinese, and English heritage.
