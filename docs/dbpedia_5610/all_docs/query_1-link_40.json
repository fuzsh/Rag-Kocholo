        "text": "Is there a name for that kind of actor described in the title of this thread?\n\n2 actors come to mind that I had to look up on IMDB because I see them alot…Larry Miller and Clifton Powell.\n\nYou may not know who they are but most likely you have seen them in a movie you like.\n\nUsually they are referred to as “character actors.” An actor who does that can have a long career in bit parts.\n\nThe champion is Charles Lane: 254 movies and 94 TV guest appearance in the IMDB. Recently celebrated his 100th birthday and was still acting at age 90.\n\nIn my circle of friends it was always “That guy,” as in: “Hey, it’s That guy!”\n\nReading threads here and elsewhere, I’ve found that this term is extremely common.\n\nGo over to www.fametracker.com and click on “Hey! It’s that Guy!” They do write-ups of character actors. Lots of fun.\n\nAnd Larry Miller is definitely one of my personal HITGs. I used to get him mixed up with John Carroll Lynch (another HITG), but I have it figured out now.\n\nI’ll see your JT Walsh and raise you a James Hampton.\n\nAnd an additional challenge- name the Lucas Black film in which they both appeared.\n\nLucas Black, you know- that kid.\n\nHow about David Strathairn? I always figured he never got famous because nobody knew how to pronounce (or spell) his last name. I really felt bad for him when he got third billing in The River Wild because he HAD to know it was the peak of his career…and still, that bratty kid Joey Mazzello out-billed him!\n\nAnother guy who’s been in a million things and everyone would recognize but few be able to name is Brad Dourif. I think he’s just now starting to get some recognition for his role as the doctor on Deadwood but he’s been solid for years."
