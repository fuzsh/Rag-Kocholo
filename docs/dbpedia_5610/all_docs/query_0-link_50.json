        "text": "Original Airdate: May 8th, 1976\n\nThe first season of SNL featured this darkly hilarious depiction of Nixon's final days in the White House. Played by a perfectly glowering Dan Aykroyd, the Watergate-besieged president drunkenly talks to a picture of Abe Lincoln on the wall (\"Abe, you were lucky. They shot you\") and demands John Belushi's Henry Kissinger to join him in prayer (\"Don't you want to pray, you Christ-killer?\"). The sketch was written by future U.S. Senator Al Franken and the late Tom Davis and goes well beyond easy political satire into something far deeper: \"Tom was very, very oriented towards human feelings and very sensitive,\" Aykroyd told Rolling Stone when Davis died in 2012. \"So, when they wrote the Nixon piece, which was lifted right off the pages of history, it's a little sentimental, it's a little sad. When Nixon goes to his knees you almost feel sorry for him, because he's at the bottom.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: December 19th, 2009\n\nThe scatterbrained singing duo Garth & Kat, played by Fred Armisen and Kristen Wiig, brought real danger to live televison: If they always appeared to be inventing their holiday songs on the spot, it's because they were. \"He definitely starts and I just try to follow,\" Wiig told Movieline. \"We don't rehearse. The first time we do it that week is literally at the dress rehearsal.\" Armisen has referred to Garth as his favorite SNL character, and though Wiig has had several more popular characters, she has said that Kat was the \"most fun\" to perform. \"So much of the show is writing, working, deadlines, trying to figure things out, punching up your sketch, knowing you're going to perform live,\" she said. \"And that two and a half minutes of airtime is so freeing and fun.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: May 20th, 2006\n\nA quick case for Will Forte as the most underrated cast member in SNL history. He didn't get the fête that Kristin Wiig and Andy Samberg received on their exits and, along with Jason Sudekis, he pushed SNL's male WASP count too high. But Forte, more than any other recent cast member, could walk the line between funny and genuinely unsettling. His nondescript face was the perfect canvas for shut-ins and right-wing conspirators like his recurring character the Falconer. In the Falconer's time travel sketch, each cast member (and host Kevin Spacey) mimics Forte's character, but they're unable to match the barely-contained psychosis of the original. This kind of absurdist Forte was too often relegated night's final segment. In some way, his outsider characters have prepared him for his acclaimed role in the Oscar-nominated film Nebraska. We're sure to see more of him soon.\n\nOriginal Airdate: May 15th, 1999\n\nAnimal talk show host Brian Fellow was inspired by someone that Tracy Morgan's ex-wife knew in high school – Morgan built a character around her descriptions. \"I said he was this weird gay dude who imagined stuff in his head and thought he knew everything. My man [SNL writer] Tim Herlihy picked right up on that shit,\" Morgan said in his autobiography, adding that Herlihy came up with the animal element. \"A delusional gay guy interviewing animals? What the fuck is that, Tim?\" Tracy Jordan's tenure on SNL, sorely underappreciated at the time, spawned a host of running characters who were hysterically strange but never quite took off, from Astronaut Jones to Dominican Lou. But few were stranger than Fellow, a dense young man who hosted a show about animals despite seeming to lack even the most basic understanding of the animals or their surroundings (\"The rainforest, that sounds wet!\"). Few SNL cast members have had a greater knack for delivering a sublimely stupid line, and Jordan gave it all with signoffs like \"Join us next week, when our guests will be a dog, and a baby dog.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: February 17th, 2001\n\n\"I worked so hard for so long to create an environment where people were nice, where people were treated nice, and where people realized how important it was to be nice,\" former Barney's New York shoe buyer Jeffrey Kalinsky told the Advocate And then there was a skit, and it needed a name, and somehow because we were new in town and doing something different and cool, it got associated with not acknowledging people. It was polar opposite to everything I'm about… All my friends, anybody that I knew, thought it was the most incredible, wonderful thing in the whole world and that I should be thrilled.\" In this recurring sketch, Will Ferrell and Jimmy Fallon (and whatever guest host was around) sent up the high-end store Jeffrey, a designer-stuffed house of haute owned by Kalinsky. When Will & Grace's Sean Hayes hosted in 2001, he joined Fallon on the floor in a sketch that peaked with Ferrell answering a cell phone approximately the size of a paperclip – and then peaked again when Fallon and Hayes succumbed to the giggles. Real life outpaced its farcical counterpart seven years later, when Christian Dior launched its very own miniphone – although the $5100 gadget one-upped the SNL writers' snob fantasia by adding a mirror.\n\nOriginal Airdate: October 7th, 1978\n\n\"The censor said, 'Don't put that pencil in there,'\" Dan Aykroyd says in Live From New York, recalling a sketch that racily revealed some male posterior on network TV years before David Caruso. \"I was checking this fridge and I had put the pencil somewhere. 'Don't put the pencil there!' And of course I said I wouldn't, but then on the air, I did. And you know – massive laugh.\" In the bit, Bill Murray and Gilda Radner's noogie-loving \"nerds\" – electric characters that writer Anne Beatts says were inspired by Elvis Costello – couldn't keep their eyes on their homework because Aykroyd was showing off his pencil holder. (\"The moon came out surprisingly early,\" exclaims Murray as Todd.) \"Todd and Lisa ended up mirroring [Murray and Radner’s] relationship in a sick way,\" said Beatts in the book American Nerd. \"Billy had this girlfriend who he ended up marrying… and when Gilda would laugh louder at all of his sketches when they were being read, you knew that they were together. But I think that mild sadism of Todd toward Lisa was a reflection of the dynamic of their relationship.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: March 12th, 1977\n\n\"When I was in college, I would tape Dan Aykroyd off the television, tape his Jimmy Carter, shamelessly practice it, and then go to the clubs and just steal it, do his Jimmy Carter,\" said Dana Carvey in the book Live From New York. \"Then eight, nine years later, Danny's in the office going, 'I really like your George Bush.' It was kind of surreal.\" In this classic sketch, SNL answers the question: How hip could the President be in the pre-Clinton era? Well, president Carter, in the hands of Aykroyd, was able to identify a brand of acid as \"orange sunshine\" from a phone call, and even helped a young constituent on a bad trip. (\"Do you have any Allman Brothers?\")\n\nOriginal Airdate: May 9th, 1992\n\nTom Hanks sells this twisted sketch about obsessive Christopher Hewitt fans so well that it's difficult to imagine if this would have made it to air at all, if he hadn't come in as a last minute replacement for original host Joe Pesci. \"When you're there for a while, you begin to recognize the patina of a sketch that has yet to be on air because no one has fully committed to it,\" Hanks said in the Live From New York book. The Guy Who Plays Mr. Belvedere Fan Club\" could be of historical importance as well, as the dawn of '80s kitsch – the decade, and Mr. Belvedere itself, had ended less than three years before, but already the mere name of the show felt like a curio of a bygone era.\n\nOriginal Airdate: May 9th, 1998\n\nA fairly straightforward parody of the over-simplified questions on Jeopardy!'s actual celebrity episodes, this recurring sketch hit its stride in its fourth installment, which escalated the hostile relationship between Will Ferrell's Alex Trebek and Darrell Hammond's Sean Connery. (It also contains Hammond's classic mispronunciation of the category \"Therapists\"). Despite the many jokes about his mustache and his mother, the real Trebek admired the sketch. \"Every taping, somebody in the audience says 'How do you feel about the Will Ferrell impression of you on SNL?' And I say the same thing every time: I love it,\" Trebek told the Hollywood Reporter. As for Hammond's jeering Connery impression, it soon took on a life of its own. \"I go around the country and people will yell out Sean Connery lines,\" Hammond said in a 2007 interview. \"It's the most popular thing I ever did.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: December 15th, 1984\n\nIn some ways, Mr. Robinson was a crude stereotype (a black version of Mr. Rogers who – surprise – lives in the ghetto and leads a life of crime) and in other ways, it was savvy, razor-sharp social satire (jokes about white flight, Reaganomics, racist cabbies abounded). But the real draw was the absolute glee with which Eddie Murphy threw himself into the role, – even more than he did with every role. In the Christmas installment, Mr. Robinson explains his hustle to the children while wearing a Santa suit and a shit-eating grin: \"With this little operation, I figure I'll be taking on about $300, 400 a day. Oh, why oh why, must Christmas come but once a year?\" Rising SNL star (and occasional Eddie Murphy impersonator) Jay Pharoah always mentions how the Mr. Robinson sketches were a formative influence.\n\nOriginal Airdate: December 12th, 1998\n\nAna Gasteyer, who wrote and starred in this legendarily naughty sketch, went on the actual NPR in 2012 to dish on the origins of this public radio send-up: \"It was sort of a combination between [NPR's] \"The Splendid Table\" and a show that was aptly named, a show called \"Good Food,\" on KCRW… You don't need to go to a commercial,\" she said about the secret to public radio's studiously understated intonation. \"You don't need to leave, you just need to take your time and explore a subject to the point that people want to weep with boredom.\" Alec Baldwin, of course, was Pete Schweddy, a man who was producing a holiday treat – balls, branded with his name and sold in sacks. Those who didn't get the joke on first utterance would get multiple chances. So iconic was this simple bit of wordplay that Ben & Jerry's produced an ice cream in honor of the skit in 2011. \"My parents tried it, which I thought was the funniest thing in the world,\" Gasteyer said. \"My mom called. She said, 'Dad laid in a supply of Schweddy Balls.' OK, and then she goes, 'Zowee, is it rich.'\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: April 22, 1978\n\nSteve Martin is one of SNL's all-time greatest hosts not merely for the record-holding frequency with which he's appeared (second only to Alec Baldwin), but for how he was the rare host that brought his own comedic sensibility to bear on the show's format. Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber was typical SNL in its period satire and silly costumes, but there was something very Martin about the shrewdly embedded commentary on the smug superiority every era feels about the previous era's scientific practices and customs. \"Just 50 years ago, we would've thought that your daughter's illness was brought on by demonic possession or witchcraft. But nowadays we know that Isabelle is suffering from an imbalance of bodily humors, perhaps caused by a toad or a small dwarf living in her stomach.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: May 1st, 2004\n\nIn her autobiography, Rachel Dratch explained that her Debbie Downer character was inspired by a trip abroad: When she informed a stranger that she was from New York City, they replied, \"So were you there for 9-11?\" She and co-writer Paula Pell introduced the character in a Disney World sketch in 2004 – the first of seven appearances – and it was so funny that it induced some of the best character-breaking crack-ups in SNL history. Guest host Lindsay Lohan, who was 16, remembered laughing so many times in rehearsal that she was afraid of being fired. When the sketch went live, the line that broke everyone was, \"It's official: I can't have children\" – at which point, Horatio Sanz was literally wiping away tears with his Mickey Mouse waffle.\n\nOriginal Airdate: September 14th, 2008\n\n\"This sketch easily could have been a dumb catfight between two female candidates,\" Tina Fey wrote in her book Bossypants. Instead, \"you all watched a sketch about feminism and you didn't even realize it because of all the jokes. Suckers!\" In the sketch, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton (Amy Poehler) take a bipartisan stand against campaign sexism. At the time, Palin's vice-presidential candidacy was a satirist's dream, and no one fulfilled it better than Fey. Two years gone from the SNL cast, Fey returned play her Republican doppelgänger in this Seth Meyers-penned sketch – ultimately NBC.com's most popular video ever. Fey reprised the role four times leading up to the 2008 election, delivering SNL its highest ratings since 1994 – and its most political relevance ever.\n\nOriginal Airdate: October 6th, 1984\n\n\"It was funny before we put one word to paper,\" Martin Short told Roger Ebert. \"I saw synchro swimming on TV – real synchro swimming – and I laughed out loud. It is the funniest sport in history.\" In 1984, Short and SCTV weren't really mainstream and This is Spinal Tap hadn't become a cult favorite yet, so this mini-mockumentary was Short, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest's biggest splash. Saying you're \"not a strong swimmer\" became a hip catchphrase as the skit set a new standard for the filmed SNL short. You can find DNA from this masterpiece in Guest's Waiting For Guffman (mincing director, check) and really, almost every parody streamed on Funny or Die. Fun fact: Also, off in his own corner of the writer's room that year? Larry David.\n\nOriginal Airdate: April 17th, 1976\n\n\"To those on the 17th floor, the 'Bass-O-Matic' was so exhilaratingly strange that many remember sitting and listening, open-mouthed, when Danny [Aykroyd] presented it at the Monday writers' meeting,\" wrote Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad in A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live. \"Nobody felt jealous of it because they couldn't imagine writing anything remotely like it.\" According to producers and cast members, Dan Aykroyd was SNL's sharpest writer and performer at the time. At 23, he was also their youngest, a not ready for prime time Orson Welles. But he didn't come into his own until he parodied late-night pitchman Ron Popeil with this mutant of his Veg-O-Matic and the Pocket Fisherman. The sketch only lasts 90 seconds but it's enough time to blend a fresh bass into a bubbly pink smoothie. From then on, the gross-out sketch became a regular feature on SNL, stretching from the projectile vomiting Rookie Cops to the Kissing Family's on-air make-out sessions.\n\nOriginal Airdate: October 27, 1990\n\nThe breakout sketch for one of SNL's most explosive masters of physical comedy was Chris Farley's shirtless dance-off with guest host Patrick Swayze, his rival for the last spot in a Chippendales show. \"I'd say it was one of the funniest sketches in the history of the show,\" SNL writer Robert Smigel said in Farley's biography, The Chris Farley Show. \"The way it was constructed, with everyone sincerely believing that this guy has a shot, and the judges studiously scribbling notes on his dance moves, that's what makes it original and completely hysterical.\" Not everyone in Farley's life agreed. \"Chippendales was a weird sketch. I always hated it,\" said co-star Chris Rock. \"The joke was basically, 'We can't hire you because you're fat'… It's just fucking mean. A more mentally together Chris Farley wouldn't have done it, but Chris wanted so much to be liked.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: December 13th, 1975\n\n\"It's like an H-bomb that Richard and I toss into America's consciousness.\" That's how comic and Pryor accomplice Paul Mooney describes writing the ballsiest race joke – possibly the ballsiest joke, period – that anyone had ever done on network TV. The audience laughs, not gasps, when Chevy and Pryor's black/white word association test peaks with: \"Nigger?\" \"Dead honky.\" The whole week, Chevy had been begging to be in a skit with Pryor, while Mooney was fuming about assorted bullshit and questions from producer Lorne Michaels. So Mooney killed two birds by writing one skit. It could be the last time a white guy said the N-word on TV and actually diffused racial tensions rather than ignited them. Bonus points: At Pryor's insistence, Gil Scott-Heron was the musical guest that night.\n\nOriginal Airdate: April 8th, 2000\n\nAmerica loved it, but for new cast member Jimmy Fallon this sketch was a revelation. \"I had just started on the show and I'm not the best actor in the world,\" he said later. \"I do impressions and stuff like that. So I was stuck in a scene with the great Will Ferrell, who's one of the funniest guys ever and we do the sketch in dress rehearsal and it's OK – it's not even that great. And then, on air… he came out with a smaller shirt so that his gut would hang out when he banged the cowbell. And everyone just broke up laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing. That's what you get when you play with the big boys.\" Though, yes, you got sick of the catch phrase, and the T-shirts and maybe even the whole idea of cowbells – and cows and bells. But the majesty of this lovingly ironic Seventies rock parody is pretty undeniable.\n\nOriginal Airdate: October 11th, 1986\n\nDana Carvey's first appearance on SNL, the season 11 opener, is still one of his most popular works. This sendup of rock-star burnout, in which Brit crooner Derek Stevens play the morose piano ballad \"The Lady I Know\" (or as SNL fans have come to call it, \"Chopping Broccoli\") dates back to Carvey's audition reel. In it, he called it his impression of a \"very pretentious\" rock star. \"I think all of us at one time in our lives wanted to be a rock star,\" he said. \"All you have to do is flare your nostrils and look like you're about to vomit. Everything you say is suddenly very important. It doesn't have to make any literal sense.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: May 11th, 1991\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" Mike Myers has said of kissing Madonna. And no wonder: In 1991, there was no more intimidating star than the just-banned-from-MTV Material Girl. Her fantasy rendezvous with Wayne and Garth was probably SNL's most perfect pop culture convergence ever: One of the most famous people on earth, writhing in the black-and-white world of \"Justify My Love,\" the most controversial video of all time, speaking in the dopey slang (\"No way!\" \"Way!\") of the most popular recurring characters since the Blues Brothers. And we were only approaching Waynemania, which would peak in 1992 with their feature film. During shooting, Myers and Dana Carvey had a personal falling-out, and were never quite able to re-capture the magic – though that didn't stop Lorne Michaels from producing a sequel or doing the sketch seven more times.\n\nOriginal Airdate: December 17th, 2006\n\n\"[W]e wrote this song in a delirium of no sleep on a Wednesday or Thursday of the week. We recorded it that night, and we were laughing so hysterically – and probably through the delirium of trying to write something so funny, this came out of it,\" Justin Timberlake told NPR about co-writing the most popular SNL Digital Short of all time (and possibly the best Timberlake song post-FutureSex/LoveSounds). Though co-star Andy Samberg says this R-rated, very-bleeped send-up of '90s R&B was written in two hours, it's shelf life is seemingly endless – a performance at Madison Square Garden, an Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics, two follow-up sketches, and a stardom for Samberg that continues today. \"[Lorne Michaels] says the thing you're known for will be in quotes in the middle of your name,\" he told Esquire He's Lorne 'SNL' Michaels, and I'm Andy 'Dick in a Box' Samberg. If that's how it goes down, that will be A-okay.\"\n\nOriginal Airdate: May 8th, 1993\n\n\"It paints a picture; the phrase has a lot more meaning to it than just a catchphrase that stands alone,\" sketch writer Bob Odenkirk told the Chicago Reader about Matt Foley, the motivational speaker who's \"35 years old, thrice divorced, and living in a van down by the river.\" \"[T]here is a lot more to it when Chris did it, and he made that character whole. It's not a gimmick. You felt like there was a real person in that character.\"\n\nBeyond Odenkirk's vivid storyline and Farley's honest portrayal, Foley was the single best use of the manic energy stored inside SNL's greatest physical comedian since John Belushi; a bundle of twitches, tics, throat-busting yells, and extreme pratfalls that made Chevy Chase look like Baryshnikov. Foley was invented by the pair in their days at Chicago's Second City, but quickly became a national legend since the folks on stage were laughing almost as hard as the audience. \"Lorne didn't like us cracking up on air,\" said Norm MacDonald in The Chris Farley Show. \"But it was always Chris's goal when it was live on air to make you laugh, to take you out of character, and he always succeeded. You could never not laugh.\"\n\nThe main victim in this sketch was David Spade: \"In rehearsal, he's done the thing with his glasses… But he'd never done the twisting his belt and hitching up the pants thing,\" said Spade. \"He saved that for the live performance, and so none of us had ever seen it. He knew that would break me.\""
