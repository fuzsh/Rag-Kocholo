        "text": "It's not often that you see an APIA actor cast as the lead in a movie or TV show, but things are slowly beginning to change. Historically, if an Asian actor was asked to be part of a project, the role was usually a supporting one or fell under an offensive trope. Asian men are still often asked to play the stereotypical nerd, the doctor, or the best friend, but almost never are they cast as the leading man or enviable love interest. But guess what, Hollywood? They can do both, and some of the best Asian actors in Hollywood are doing just that in movies and TV shows, like the critically acclaimed (and Oscar-nominated) films \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" and \"Minari,\" as well as hit TV series like \"Pachinko,\" \"Squid Game,\" and \"XO, Kitty.\"\n\nHollywood still has a long way to go when it comes to casting Asian men in a variety of roles.
