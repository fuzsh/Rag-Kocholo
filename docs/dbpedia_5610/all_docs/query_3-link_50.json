        "text": "There may be no perfect age to become a parent (did any of us really feel ready?), but the National Center for Family and Marriage Research reports the average age a man becomes a dad is between 27 and 30.\n\nFor some, though—including these celebrities—becoming a dad can happen at any age. In fact, some famous fathers have doubled the average, becoming dads past the age of 65. We have to hand it to them—keeping up with an energetic toddler is hard enough in your 30s. We can't imagine it after retirement!\n\nHere are some older pops who had children later in life. Note: the ages listed below are the ages at which each celebrity had their latest child.\n\n01 of 15\n\nAl Pacino, 83\n\nHollywood legend Al Pacino was expecting a baby with his 29-year-old girlfriend Noor Alfallah in the summer of 2023. Pacino already has three other grown children. He shares his oldest daughter, 33-year-old Julie Marie with ex-girlfriend Jan Tarrant. Pacino is also a father to 22-year-old twins Anton and Olivia with Beverly D'Angelo.\n\n02 of 15\n\nRobert De Niro, 79\n\nIn May 2023, Robert De Niro announced the birth of his seventh child. He shares Gia Virginia Chen De Niro, with his girlfriend Tiffany Chen. Talk about an age difference—there is a 51-year gap between De Niro's oldest child and his youngest child.\n\nDe Niro shares children Drena, 51, and Raphael, 46, with first wife Diahnne Abbott, has twin sons Aaron and Julian, 27, with his ex-girlfriend Toukie Smith, and has Elliot, 25, and Helen, 11, with ex-wife Grace Hightower.\n\n03 of 15\n\nMick Jagger, 73\n\nPapa is a Rolling Stone! Mick Jagger welcomed his eighth child—a son, with girlfriend Melanie Hamrick in 2016—at the age of 73. According to The Daily Mail, the two have no plans of marrying, but the rock legend flew 3,500 miles from London to New York at the last minute to be with Hamrick for the birth.\n\nNow at age 79, Jagger has eight children in total—sons James, 37; Gabriel, 25; and Lucas, 24—plus daughters Karis, 52; Jade, 51; Elizabeth, 39; and Georgia May, 31. The Stones frontman also has five grandchildren and even became a great-grandfather (!) in May 2014.\n\n04 of 15\n\nRichard Gere, 70\n\nRichard Gere first became a father in 2000 when he welcomed a son, Homer, with his second wife Carey Lowell. The actor was also stepfather to Lowell's daughter from a previous marriage.\n\nEighteen years later, Gere's third wife Alejandra Silva gave birth to their son Alexander. Their second son, whose name has not been shared publicly was born in 2020. Gere was 70 years old when his second son was born. He is also a stepfather to Silva's son from a previous marriage.\n\n05 of 15\n\nGeorge Lucas, 69\n\nGeorge Lucas and his wife Mellody Hobson welcomed their daughter, Everest, in 2013, when Lucas was 69 years old. She was delivered via surrogacy and is the first biological child for Lucas and Hobson. The now 79-year-old Lucas also has three adopted children: Amanda, 41, Katie, 35, and Jett, 30.\n\n06 of 15\n\nRonnie Wood, 68\n\nIt seems time is on his side. Jagger's bandmate and The Rolling Stones legend Ronnie Wood and his wife Sally Humphreys, who is 31 years his junior, welcomed twin girls just two days before his 69th birthday. It was the same year (2016) that Jagger welcomed his latest son.\n\nWood has four adult children from previous relationships, so he may know a thing or two about the \"Midnight Rambler\" routine with newborns. His oldest child, musician Jesse Wood, was 39 years old when the twins were born.\n\n07 of 15\n\nBilly Joel, 68\n\nIn October 2017, the legendary singer welcomed another 'Uptown Girl' to his family at the age of 68. That's when his fourth wife, Alexis Roderick, gave birth to Remy Anne. Remy joined big sister Della who was born in 2015. The day after Della was born, Joel performed 'My Life' and showed off photos of his newborn daughter.\n\nJoel's first-born daughter Alexa Ray is now 36 years old. Alexa's mom is Joel's second wife, Christie Brinkley.\n\n08 of 15\n\nSteve Martin, 67\n\nHe might have won our hearts in Father of the Bride, but he didn't have a child of his own until he was 67 years old. His daughter Mary was born in 2012 to his wife Anne Stringfield. Mary is Martin's only child.\n\n09 of 15\n\nRod Stewart, 66\n\nSinger Rod Stewart has eight children with five different mothers. His youngest, Aiden Patrick, was born in February 2011 to his current wife Penny Lancaster. Stewart was 66 at the time. And it was a true Father of the Bride story. Six months after Aiden was born, Stewart's daughter Kimberly had a baby.\n\nStewart's four daughters and four sons range in age from 59 to 12.\n\n10 of 15\n\nAlec Baldwin, 64\n\nAlec Baldwin has a total of eight children. He shares his oldest daughter, Ireland with his ex-wife Kim Basinger. Baldwin married his current wife Hilaria in 2012 and they had their first of seven children shortly thereafter. Their youngest daughter Ilaria Catalina Irena was born in September 2022. Baldwin was 64 years old when she was born.\n\n11 of 15\n\nJeff Goldblum, 62\n\nThe now-70-year-old actor may have been married before, but he once told Parade that he never considered having kids until he met his wife, Emilie Livingston. At 62, Goldblum became a parent for the first time to their son Charlie Ocean. In April 2017, the couple added to their family when River Joe was born.\n\n12 of 15\n\nBruce Willis, 59\n\nBruce Willis has five kids, all daughters. Even though his three children—Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah—with ex-wife Demi Moore were almost grown in 2012, he welcomed a third daughter, Mabel Ray, at the age of 57. Two years later, he and his wife Emma Heming had another daughter, Evelyn Penn. The entire extended family is very tight-knit, supporting Willis after he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a rare condition.\n\n13 of 15\n\nMichael Douglas, 58\n\nActor Michael Douglas first became a father in 1978 when his son Cameron was born to his first wife, Diandra Luker. After their divorce, Douglas married actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. Their son Dylan Michel was born in 2000 and their daughter Carys Zeta was born in 2003. Douglas was 58 years old when Carys was born. He's now 78.\n\n14 of 15\n\nHugh Grant, 58\n\nHugh Grant first became a father in 2011 at the age of 51 with his girlfriend Tinlan Hong. \"I can't pretend it wasn't a little bit of a surprise,\" he said about the first pregnancy.\n\nSince then, Grant has had a total of five children—two with Hong and three with his now-wife Anna Eberstein. Grant's youngest child was born in January 2018. Grant was 58 years old.\n\n15 of 15\n\nSimon Cowell, 55\n\nSimon Cowell became a first-time father in 2014 when he and Lauren Silverman welcomed a baby boy, Eric. He was 55 years old at the time. Now 63 years old, Cowell has recently talked about possibly having a second child. Only time will tell."
