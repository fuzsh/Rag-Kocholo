CHIBA, Japan (AP) – The Lotte Marines of Japan’s Pacific League say they have signed former New York Yankees utility infielder Luis Cruz to a one-year contract worth $750,000.

The 29-year-old Cruz, who split the 2013 season between the Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers, has a career batting average of .234 with seven home runs and 57 RBI in 195 games.

Cruz has played more than five seasons in Major League Baseball.

A native of Mexico, he represented his country at the World Baseball Classic in 2006 and 2013.

The Marines also said they have re-signed first baseman Craig Brazell and right-handed reliever Carlos Rosa for next season. Terms of their deals were not announced. (end)
