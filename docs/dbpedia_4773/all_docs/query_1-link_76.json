        "text": "The York Revolution announced today that they have signed catcher Luis Cruz. The 23-year-old is in his seventh professional season, originally signed as an undrafted free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2011. A native of Cotui, Dominican Republic, Cruz has spent his entire career with the Cardinals, beginning in the Dominican Summer League, and has making it as high as Triple-A Memphis, last season. This year he played nine games for Double-A Springfield, batting .250 with 2 doubles, and 3 RBI.\n\nIn addition to playing behind the plate, Cruz has served as a first baseman and designated hitter in his career, and has also made four appearances on the mound. He has thrown out 34% of baserunners in his career, while posting a fielding percentage of .980.\n\nThe move will provide additional versatility for manager Mark Mason, who now has three viable options behind the plate, in Cruz, Tejeda, and Alen. Furthermore, all three York catchers can also play in the field, and by having an additional backstop, it will allow Mason to play two of his catchers in the field at the same time, while the third catcher that night is free to warm up pitchers in the bullpen.\n\n-Matt Present"
