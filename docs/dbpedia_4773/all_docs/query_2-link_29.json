        "text": "Our first excursion to a Japanese baseball game this season took us to Chiba, home of Bobby Valentine and the last place Marines. Even with it being a Saturday, I figured it wouldn’t be too difficult to get a seat given the opponent (Rakuten Eagles from Sendai) and with the Marines being out of the race. Not so.\n\nWe barely got tickets to this game that sold out soon after we arrived more than an hour early. As we walked into the stadium of 30,000 people (about 29,000 already in their seats even though the game wouldn’t begin for almost an hour) our foreign faces were on the giant video scoreboard in center field for all to see. Did someone notify the camera man that some strange looking people were about to enter? I don’t know, but it was funny. I’ve been to hundreds of games in my life and that was my first time, that I remember, being up on the big screen. My daughter turned red immediately upon seeing her face up there.\n\nFinding a seat was no easy task. We ended up with about the worst seats in the place and were lucky to have found those. We couldn’t see the big screen or left field from where we sat.\n\nThe Japanese national anthem, “Kimi ga yo,” was sung by someone flanked by the Marines many mascots.\n\nWhat would you like to eat? There are no hot dogs or nachos on the menu here. But you can have some Tempura, Curry Rice, or Tanuki Udon.\n\nMore pictures of the crazy fans and the beer girls in a later entry…"
