        "text": "Payoff for months spent tracking down tickets to the nine contests we would attend during the 17 day trip to Japan all hinged on a tourism bureau in a back alley in Shibuya being open on a public holiday. My wife, Yalina, stood patiently as several rings on the buzzer went unanswered and I contemplated the irony of potentially missing the Marine’s home game on Marine Day. While many were off celebrating the bounty of the sea, I was loopy with jet lag thinking of ways to break into an office building.\n\nAfter a brief lunch and a second attempt at retrieving my tickets, it was time for Plan B. In Japan, baseball tickets can be purchased at any konbini (7/11, Lawson, FamilyMart, etc.), so we set off to the nearest location. Armed with zero language skills and an air of desperation, I played charades well enough to convey to the clerk that I needed two tickets for that evening’s game between the Chiba Lotte Marines and the Orix Buffaloes. Several thousand Yen later, we were in business.\n\nZoZo Marine Stadium, home of the Marines, is located in Chiba City on the northern shore of Tokyo Bay about an hour’s train ride from central Tokyo. It’s a straight shot on the JR Keiyo Line from Tokyo Station to Kaihin-Makuhari Station, followed by a mile walk through an office park to the greenbelt beyond. Trudging along the path through the grass, there is little indication that you’re anywhere near a professional baseball stadium save for the goofy statue at the station and lamppost adornments that promised that we were on the right track.\n\nBefore long, a path through the trees led to a large clearing where the tailgate was in full swing. Yalina and I walked past a long row of food and beer stalls to where a crowd had gathered around a cluster of tables surrounded by boxes.\n\n“It’s Super Lady Day,” an usher informed us, “Ladies can check in over there to get a prize.”\n\nNever one to pass up a giveaway, Yalina dove into the fray and emerged with a tee-shirt commemorating the evening. We meandered over to a massive row of headshots where a photographer announced that a formal poll was held and the faces on display were of those players judged to be the handsomest. A few kissy-face snaps later and we entered the ballpark.\n\nThe extra cash we were forced to spend on an emergency set of tickets ended up being well worth it as an usher dressed like a sailor led us to our seats about 50 feet behind home plate. The first thing we noticed was that the field was much smaller than anything in the Major Leagues. This type of setup is common in Japan. In fact, many of Japan’s professional ballparks would not be legal according to Major League rules.\n\nThe Marines kicked things off with a solo home run bottom of the first inning. We wouldn’t see another run plated until the Buffaloes pushed one across in the bottom of the fifth. Despite the relative lack of offense that night, Yalina and I enjoyed our prime vantage point, soaked in what would be the best baseball sunset of the trip, and repeatedly summoned the beer girls who patrolled the stands.\n\nThe Marines and the Buffaloes play in the Pacific League which is the NPB equivalent of MLB’s American League. Neither team is the most popular in their league, and the Pacific League suffers from poorer attendance and lower exposure than the competing, Central League. Predictably, a foreigner with little access to Japanese baseball would know next to nothing about either team or fanbase.\n\nThe one thing I did know ahead of time was that the Marines have, quite possibly, the greatest mascot in the history of sports. I didn’t even know it’s name until a friend translated it for me some days later, but the Mysterious Fish is a sight to behold. I didn’t know if or when it would happen, but I held out hope that the beast would make an appearance.\n\nTo my delight, with the game tied at one in the middle of the fifth, a crowd of children flooded the field as a booming, cartoonishly exaggerated deep voice announced the arrival of the Mysterious Fish’s first form. An enormous neon anglerfish preached to his disciples before a saccharine sweet, poppy remix of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” played over the PA.\n\nCheerleaders formed a line and began to dance as the Mysterious Fish took its second, man-sized form and emerged onto the field to slowly bumble around amongst the assembled. As the song reached its crescendo, the final form was achieved as the skeleton of the fish leapt forth from its gaping maw. The skeleton wore a red dress with a bow on its head (in honor, one assumes, of Super Lady Day) and continued to bop around the outfield until the song ended.\n\nThe video I took will not do it justice, so please accept this offering:\n\nAs quickly as the scene had devolved into madness, the game resumed like nothing had happened. I needed a chu-hi and a couple innings worth of dribbling grounders and shallow fly balls in order to come down from the scene I’d witnessed. Both were readily available.\n\nAs the game progressed, Yalina and I gorged on calamari, edamame, and noodles; standard ballpark fare.\n\nAs the innings progressed, the starting pitchers fatigued. When the Marines skipper eventually walked out to the mound to take the ball from his man, I looked around for the bullpens and realized that they were nowhere to be seen. Before I could question where the relief corps warmed up, a convertible Mazda emerged from the corner of the outfield. Piloted by a plucky young woman, the car navigated around the other position players and drove right up to the mound. A serious looking pitcher hopped out and finished his warmup as the car retreated back to the bowels of the stadium. This peculiar scene would repeat itself several more times.\n\nWithout glossing over too much of the game, Lucky 7 and the balloon jets came and went, the couple sitting in front of us got stumblingly drunk, and jet lag began to get the better of us.\n\nThe action resumed in the top of the ninth inning when the Buffaloes’ second baseman, Koji Oshiro, smashed his first home run of the season to put the away team up 2–1. Even though the visitors couldn’t add any insurance, I was certain the Marines (and the super ladies) would take the L on their special day.\n\nThe bottom half of the inning heated up and the first two Marines batters were quickly retired. Down to their final out, the Marine’s offense managed to knock a couple of singles. This brought left fielder Shohei Kato to the plate. The crowd found new life as he looked at a couple of pitches and, seeing one he liked, ripped a double into the gap in left field. Two runners crossed home plate and the place went bananas as the Chiba Lotte Marines defeated the Orix Buffaloes 3–2.\n\nThe energy was palpable as Kato took to the field for his hero interview, but Yalina and I didn’t stay for too much of it. We wanted to grab a bowl of ramen at the station before we caught the train back to our hotel. With one down and eight games left to go, the trip couldn’t have kicked off on a more exciting note.\n\n7/17/17 Chiba Lotte Marines 3, Orix Buffaloes 2. Box Score"
