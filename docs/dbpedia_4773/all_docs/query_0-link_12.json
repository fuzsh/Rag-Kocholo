        "text": "As free agents begin to sign with their new or old teams, a former Dodger has a new team and a new country to play in.\n\nLuis Cruz came up to the Dodgers in July 2012 and played well enough to warrant the starting position at third base to begin 2013. He didn’t last long as a starter and was released by the team on June 28.\n\nAccording to Dylan Hernandez of the L.A. Times, Cruz is heading overseas for his next job:\n\nCruz hit just .127 with a home run and six RBI in 45 games with the Dodgers before being released. Juan Uribe took over and played well enough to allow the team to let Cruz go and the 29-year-old Cruz went to the New York Yankees for just a month.\n\nIn 2012, Cruz came up and became a fan favorite when he hit .297 with six home runs and 40 RBI in 78 games for the Dodgers. The crowd would often welcome his at-bats with an overextended pronunciation of his last name, as he provided timely hitting and excellent defense in his time.\n\nTo start the year, Cruz represented Team Mexico in the World Baseball Classic and hit .273 in three games. He was teammates with fellow Dodger Adrian Gonzalez. After the 2013 season, Cruz went to play in the Mexican Winter League for the Culiacan Tomateros and hit .291 in 29 games for the team.\n\nHis new team, the Marines, finished 74-68 last season and in third place in the Pacific League of the Nippon Professional Baseball league in Japan. It’s unclear what the intentions are for Cruz for the Marines, but it’ll be interesting to see if he will thrive in the new country, as some players do when they head overseas.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nICYMI: Dan Haren and the Dodgers agreed to a one-year deal over the weekend."
