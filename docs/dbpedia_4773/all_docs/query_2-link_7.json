        "text": "Baseball and rugby union stadium in Chiba, Japan\n\nZOZO Marine Stadium[2] (ZOZOマリンスタジアム, Zozo Marin Sutajiamu) (official name: Chiba Marine Stadium (千葉マリンスタジアム, Chiba Marin Sutajiamu)) is an outdoor baseball stadium in Chiba City, Chiba, Japan. It opened in 1990, with a capacity of about 30,000 spectators. It is primarily used for baseball games, and is the home field of the Chiba Lotte Marines. It is also used for rugby as well as large-scale music concerts. The stadium was built with a multi-purpose circular shape, similar in shape to some (now-defunct) American stadiums, such as Three Rivers Stadium or Busch Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe inaugural event at the Chiba Marine Stadium was on April 13, 1990, with a sold-out performance of the Blond Ambition Tour by American singer Madonna; the concert was the first of three sold-out dates (April 13, 14 & 15, 1990) by Madonna at the stadium. In addition to the April 13th concert being the big opening event for the stadium, it was also the first date of Madonna’s tour itself. The April 13th show was marred by heavy rain, thunder, lightning, and high winds, which led to the production being drastically scaled back; this was documented on the tour documentary film, Madonna: Truth or Dare, where it appears that the weather did not prevent her audience’s enjoyment that evening. The remaining two shows went-on successfully as scheduled.\n\nLady Gaga performed two sold-out shows at the venue in August 13 and 14, 2014, for her ArtRave: The Artpop Ball[3] tour.[4][5]\n\nThe stadium hosts the main stage of the Summer Sonic music festival every August, with the other stages of the festival located in nearby Makuhari Messe. The main stage of Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) Japan has also been held at the stadium, with its first event beginning in 2017.[6]\n\nOne of the stadium's most notable baseball events was on April 10, 2022, when Chiba Lotte Marines pitcher Rōki Sasaki threw a perfect game, the 16th perfect game in NPB history. Four more no-hitters, aside from the perfect game, would be thrown that season.\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nFront of ZOZO Marine Stadium(photo is from QVC Marine Field at that time)\n\nMemorial of Marines, at Chiba Marine Stadium (ZOZO Marine Field)\n\nMakuhari Messe (right)\n\nTrivia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe stadium was modelled as a stage in the 1994 video game Tekken, although it was only known as simply \"Stadium\".\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nLists of stadiums\n\nList of stadiums in Japan\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
