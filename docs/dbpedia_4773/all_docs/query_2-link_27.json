        "text": "Outfielder Andy Martin, 23, has joined the Chiba Lotte Marines on a training contract as of July 2nd. After arriving in Japan in May, he started his Japanese career with the Ibaraki Astro Planets of the Route Inn BCL. Martin made his debut with the Astro Planets on May 24th, hitting a home run. Over 11 games with the team, he posted a .216 batting average, with 9 RBIs, 2 stolen bases, and three home runs, including a grand slam.\n\nReflecting on his transition to playing in Japan and his time with the Astro Planets, Martin said, “It was great. I’m really thankful for the opportunity that Ibaraki Astro Planets gave me and it did take me a minute to get used to it, but at the end of the day, this is the same game I’ve been playing my whole life. My mentality was to go out there, be myself, and play ball.”\n\nBefore heading to Japan, Martin played at Dyersburg State Community College, hitting .307 over two seasons. During his time in the TCCAA (Tennessee Community College Athletic Association), he hit 24 home runs, drove in 97 runs, and stole 24 bases.\n\nIn addition to his college career, Martin is also part of the Cuban Professional Baseball Federation (Fepcube) and started alongside his brother, Leonys, in the outfield in the Cuban Independent team’s first-ever exhibition game vs. the Miami Dade College Sharks.\n\nSeen as a promising power bat, Martin will continue his development with Chiba’s farm team, wearing number 138. Notably, Andy is the younger brother of Leonys Martin, who played with Chiba from 2019 to 2022, hitting 75 home runs and being selected as an NPB All-Star in 2021. Andy and Leonys Martin become one of the few foreign player siblings to sign with an NPB team.\n\nOn signing with the same team his brother played for, Andy expressed his excitement: “It’s an honor. My brother did a lot of good things here and the fans love him, so being in this situation right now is definitely an honor and something I dreamed about.”\n\nWhen asked about the experience of playing in front of Japanese fans compared to those back home, Andy noted, “Oh, it’s amazing. They have shown me love and support since the first day. It’s incredible how much energy they bring to the stadium every game, always cheering for you no matter how you do or what the score is.”\n\nOne of Andy’s most memorable moments in Japan so far has been the camaraderie with his teammates in Ibaraki. “Definitely all the time that I got to spend with my teammates in Ibaraki,” he recalled. “They took care of me since the day I got here.”\n\nAs Andy Martin continues his journey with the Chiba Lotte Marines, he aims to build on his early success and develop into a key player for the team, much like his brother before him."
