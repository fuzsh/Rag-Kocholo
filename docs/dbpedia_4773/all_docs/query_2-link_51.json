        "text": "\"He had the injury and then he needs time,\" Setoyama said through translator David Yamamoto. \"I'm sure that he will get better. It takes time to adjust to the major leagues here after playing in Japan.\"\n\nNishioka is hitting only .197. He got off to a slow start in the first week of the season, then missed two months after breaking his left leg when the Yankees' Nick Swisher slid into him trying to break up a double play. Nishioka's bat hasn't heated up since his return, and he has six errors in 19 games in the middle infield. The switch hitter went 0-for-4 in Wednesday's 1-0 victory over Los Angeles, but his grounder drove in the only run after Ben Revere led off the first inning with a triple. For the three-game series, Nishioka went 2-for-11.\n\nLast year, he led the Nippon League with a .346 average, 206 hits and 121 runs a year ago in helping the Marines to the Nippon Baseball League title. The Twins paid $5 million for the rights to negotiate with Nishioka and gave him a three-year, $9 million contract to come across the Pacific Ocean to play here.\n\nThey are 34-45 after winning the past two games. Despite the horrible record, clubhouse morale seems to be good, according to manager Ron Gardenhire. The only flareup came Friday in Milwaukee, when Joe Mauer and Jose Mijares had a disagreement about what pitches should be called.\n\nGardenhire admitted this has been his toughest year as a manager because of all of the injuries, but he also said the team has stuck together and there has been peace in the clubhouse. And he hasn't given up on winning the division.\n\n\"We've got to get more consistent and stop the long losing streaks and put more of those winning streaks together,\" he said. \"That's the thing that you're fighting against, is the ups and downs. Hopefully our pitching staff is going to take care of that.\"\n\n\"We have so many different people in our lineup, so when we get some people [back] ... I think our offense will pick up a little bit as far as production goes,\" Gardenhire said. \"But these kids, they're running around, we can steal some bases, we just have to be a little finer than we would with all of our big shooters, and there's really no room for error here.\"\n\nJottings • The Minnesota High School Football All-Star Game was held at TCF Bank Stadium on Saturday night, but NCAA rules prevented Gophers coach Jerry Kill or any of his coaches to attend to find a player that could help their team. \"I don't understand that rule, to be honest with you,\" Kill said. \"We have these great youngsters who have worked so hard, what a privilege to get the opportunity to play and so forth, and they play right here at our stadium and I can't watch it. I would have liked to have gotten me some popcorn and a hot dog and watched it and been a fan for once. But I couldn't do it.\"\n\n• Denard Span, the Twins center fielder who is sidelined because of a concussion, said he did have one small headache Wednesday, but they are coming far apart, and he hopes to be back in the lineup soon. ... Michael Cuddyer has tied his record of seven stolen bases for a season, set last year. He has been caught only once this season.\n\n• New Jersey Nets forward Kris Humphries, the former Gophers standout coming off the best year of his NBA career, is a free agent this offseason. Appearing at Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital in Hackensack, N.J., on Wednesday, he didn't want to talk about his contract status or his personal life with Kim Kardashian. Instead, he wanted to focus on the kids, telling reporters: \"One thing that everyone has to know is that no one is beyond hospitals and that everyone is somehow connected to someone who is struggling. I have had family members deal with cancer and all sorts of diseases and different things. So it's something you have to know. It could very well be your kid in there someday.\""
