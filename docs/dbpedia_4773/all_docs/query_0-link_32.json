        "text": "Reds closer Alexis Díaz headlines the 16 players from the Reds organization on World Baseball Classic rosters.\n\nDíaz will play on team Puerto Rico alongside 2022 feel-good story Fernando Cruz; the pair are two of the five players on the Reds’ 40-man roster who will participate. Right-hander Luis Cessa is on Mexico’s team, right-hander Ian Gibaut is playing for Great Britain and lefty Reiver Sanmartin is on the Colombian team. The other 11 come from up and down the minor-league system. Of the 16 participants, 14 are pitchers.\n\nThe WBC kicks off March 8 and concludes March 21 with the final in Miami.\n\nHere’s a look at the Reds players on WBC rosters:\n\nAustralia\n\nRHP Kyle Glogoski — The 24-year-old was claimed off of waivers in November after spending the entirety of his career in the Phillies’ organization. He was 2-6 with a 2.77 ERA in 16 appearances and 12 starts for the High-A Jersey Shore team. Glogoski, who was born in Auckland and pitched for New Zealand in the 2016 WBC qualifiers, struck out 75 batters in 65 innings with 20 walks.\n\nColombia\n\nRHP Pedro Garcia — A 27-year-old reliever, Garcia appeared in 40 games for Double-A Chattanooga, putting up a 2.17 ERA with 12 saves. He struck out 58 batters with 19 walks in 49 2/3 innings. He made nine appearances in Triple A, where he allowed eight earned runs in 6 2/3 innings.\n\nRHP Tayron Guerrero — The 32-year-old signed with the Reds as a minor-league free agent last month. The 6-foot-8 reliever has appeared in 113 games in the big leagues with the Padres and White Sox, last appearing in a big-league game in 2019. Last year he pitched in Japan, where he was 3-3 with a 3.52 ERA in 49 appearances for the Chiba Lotte Marines, earning three saves.\n\nLHP Reiver Sanmartin — The Reds reliever is listed as a starter for his home country. Sanmartin started in the rotation last season, but found a home in the bullpen with the Reds. He was 0-4 with a 19.85 ERA in four starts, but 4-0 with a 2.96 ERA in 41 relief appearances.\n\nGreat Britain\n\nRHP Donovan Benoit — The 24-year-old was a 10th-round pick by the Reds out of Tulane in 2021. He went 3-4 with a 4.00 ERA in 33 appearances for High-A Dayton last season, recording 12 saves.\n\nRHP Ian Gibaut — The Reds picked Gibaut up off of waivers from the Dodgers last July. The 29-year-old appeared in 33 games for the Reds, going 1-2 with a 4.67 ERA and a save. He’ll be battling for a bullpen spot this spring.\n\nIsrael\n\nLHP Evan Kravetz — A 6-foot-8 lefty, Kravetz was 4-5 with a 4.20 ERA between High-A Dayton and Double-A Chattanooga last season. He struck out 103 batters in 83 2/3 innings, but walked 41. He started eight games of his 17 in Dayton and all 11 of his appearances with the Lookouts were out of the bullpen.\n\nItaly\n\nLHP Nicolò Pinazzi — The Reds signed Pinazzi out of the Italian league in 2020. He pitched mostly in the Rookie Arizona Complex League last season, but did make one appearance at Low-A Daytona. In his 11 games and five starts in Arizona, he was 3-1 with a 4.54 ERA.\n\nRHP Vin Timpanelli — A catcher in college, the Reds signed Timpanelli out of a men’s league in 2020. Last season he reached Double A where he appeared in 11 games and had a 7.00 ERA. At High-A Dayton, he was 1-1 with a 3.94 ERA in 21 appearances. He also appeared in eight games in the Arizona Fall League, finishing with a 10.00 ERA there.\n\nMexico\n\nRHP Luis Cessa — Cessa went from the bullpen to the rotation last August and was 1-3 with a 4.30 ERA in 10 starts, while he was 3-1 with a 4.91 ERA as a reliever. He’s expected to battle for a rotation spot this spring, but will obviously miss some time pitching for his country.\n\nNetherlands\n\nRHP Arij Fransen — The 6-3 righty pitched three seasons in the Dutch Major League before signing with the Reds. Last year he pitched in both the Arizona Complex League and Low-A Daytona. Between the two spots, he was 3-8 with a 6.96 ERA. He made 22 appearances and 13 starts, six starts coming with the Tortugas.\n\nNicaragua\n\nSS Steven Leyton — The 24-year-old played at four levels for the Reds last season, with the majority of his time at Low-A Daytona. Overall, he hit .250/.274/.471 with 11 homers in 84 games. He played 51 games for Daytona, 23 for Dayton, three for Chattanooga and seven for Louisville. He also played in the Nicaraguan Winter League.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nRHP Fernando Cruz — One of the great success stories of 2022, Cruz reached the big leagues 15 years after being drafted. The 32-year-old appeared in 14 games for the Reds and was 0-1 with a 1.23 ERA, striking out 21 batters in 14 2/3 innings. He’s in big league camp and has a good shot at making the Opening Day roster after his successful debut.\n\nRHP Alexis Díaz — The younger brother of Mets closer Edwin Díaz, the Reds pitcher made a name for himself as a rookie in 2022. Díaz led the Reds with 10 saves last season and would logically step into the closer’s role this season. He was 7-3 with a 1.84 ERA in 59 games, striking out 83 batters in 63 2/3 innings. Batters hit just .131 against him and he had a WHIP of 0.958 and finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting.\n\nOF Henry Ramos — The 30-year-old Ramos played for the KT Wiz of the Korea Baseball Organization last season, but was limited to just 18 games. He reached the big leagues in 2021 with the Diamondbacks.\n\nVenezuela\n\nRHP Silvino Bracho — The Reds signed the 30-year-old to a minor-league deal in December with an invitation to big-league camp. The reliever has played parts of six big-league seasons totaling 95 games between the Diamondbacks and Braves. Bracho started the season in the Red Sox organization. Between the Triple-A Worcester Red Sox and the Gwinnett Stripers, Bracho was 2-4 with a 2.67 ERA in 38 appearances and five starts. He had 11 saves in 17 appearances for Zulia of the Venezuelan Winter League.\n\n(Top photo of Alexis Díaz: Michael Reaves / Getty Images)"
