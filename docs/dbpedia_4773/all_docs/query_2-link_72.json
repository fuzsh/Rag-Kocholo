        "text": "YOHOHAMA – Mazda All Star Game 2008! This was my first time heading out to the stadium in Yokohama. The trek wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be from Chiba but once the train started getting closer to Yokohama, people clad in yukatas and jinbes started to crowd the train. For some reason the Yokohama fireworks were scheduled at the same time as the All Star Game. It was a strange mix of people wearing gear from the 12 baseball teams and people dolled up for the fireworks at Sakuragicho station.\n\nI went inside just as the “Homerun King” face off was about to begin. Since my seat was out in the bleachers a lot of the balls that were hit into the stands came flying by. It was really fun to see Alex Ramirez ‘s (Yomiuri Giants) homeruns zoom by. Unfortunately G.G. Sato (Seibu Lions) really wasn’t hitting that well and his time out to bat was pretty short. All of the balls that didn’t make it over the fence were left for school boys in uniforms to catch out on the field. Some of the boys had bulging pockets with a ball in each pocket while others were frantically running to catch their own prize.\n\nAs the clock ticked closer to 18:00, more and more people poured into the stands. I was so excited to cheer on all of my favorite Pacific League teams at the same time! It turned out that the person sitting next to me was wearing a Tsuyoshi Nishioka (Chiba Lotte Marines) and his friend next to him was wearing a Masahiro Tanaka (Rakuten Eagles) uniform so I knew I was in good company. My whole row was jumping up and down when the Pacific Leaguers were up to bat just like at Marine Stadium. Some guy who sat two rows behind me knew every single song for each player so he was leading the chants in our section.\n\nThe starting lineup for the Pacific League was Tsuyoshi and Ohmatsu from the Marines, Yamasaki and Rick from the Eagles, Inaba from the Nippon Ham Fighters, Kataoka and Nakajima from the Lions, and Matsunaka from the Softbank Hawks. Then the remaining Pacific League All Stars were called out one by one. Everyone came out in a “normal” way but of course Hichori (Morimoto form the Fighters) had to do something different. When he first came out the announcers were confused and announced that Hichori came out doing a handstand but once our eyes adjusted you could see that he had put his pants on his head and his shirt on his legs and attached a head to his crotch… I have no idea where his inspirations come from but it was pretty funny to watch him during the singing of the national anthem by Kumi Koda.\n\nThe Central League All Stars were slightly blinding in their all-white uniforms and was more difficult to tell them apart. However, I did manage to catch Alex Ramirez (or “Rami chan”) come out from the dugout but was soon distracted by Hichori again and went back to watching him interact with his team. It was great to have a chance to see the Central Leaguers since I usually only watch Pacific League games. For example, I know that Kenshin Kawakami of the Chunichi Dragons (last year’s champs) has a huge following so it was a treat to see him pitch.\n\nHisashi Iwakuma, the Eagle’s ace pitcher, had a couple of good innings and everything was going well until Yoshihisa Naruse of the Marines took the mound. It was seriously the most painful pitching I have ever seen. I might not remember this correctly but he gave up something like 11 hits and 8 runs in a couple of innings!! This was totally unexpected, especially coming from the man who gave up fewer runs than Yu Darvish in the 2007 season. What happened Naruse?? In an interview after the game, he didn’t even know what happened「自分でも分からない」were his words after the game. Seriously painful pitching. As for something good, Ohmatsu was on a roll and hit two homers. July was a fantastic month for Ohmatsu and I believe that he was given MVP status for July.I am not sure why he does this but every second time I went to take I picture of him he had his hand in his left pocket. So here he is in his favorite position.\n\nOne of my favorite moments of the evening was when the mascots of every team came out to roll a gigantic baseball from one end of the field to the other. The Central League mascots and the Pacific League mascots were out to get each other and kept derailing the ball rolling process. It was really fun to watch and people near first base even got to participate. I know that I am biased but Mar-kun is the cutest mascot! I’ll have to find a new home for my Mar-kun mascot when I get a new phone in Canada.\n\nFor the last few innings, I had a friend sneak me around to different seats behind the Japanese journalists covering the event. (I noticed that a lot of them had red-penned Naruse’s 6-run inning as they were taking notes). For some reason beyond anything I can comprehend, there was a musical interlude by Yuko Ogura (an idol) and her non-musically gifted friends. I feel like the baseball was enough entertainment as well as the Yokohama fireworks in the background but the organizers threw in some idols to spice some things up.\n\nAhh and yes, I got to see Ma-kun pitch! Yay!! He only pitched for one inning. If you recall Ma-kun was pulled form the team roster because of a rumoured right-shoulder injury. There was talk that he would miss the All Star game as well as the Olympics but he worked on his arm and gave it some rest. I hope that he isn’t pushing himself too hard and that he has actually recovered from the injury. The Eagles don’t need another Iwakuma… especially since the team rakes in huge merchandise profits due to Ma-kun’s popularity. When I got home and watched the highlights, there was so little focus on who hit what when but a lot of attention was paid to Ma-kun’s one inning. Go figure.\n\nCHIBA – Now that I have had a chance to rest a little, I am feeling a bit more clear headed. Again, a great big “thank you” to the Marines staff. I was lucky enough to have a chance to go to the dugout yesterday and say my final good byes (but only sort of because I sent and said good bye after the game too…oh well).\n\nBelow: This is what it looks like from the bench in the afternoon before a game. I just missed an interview with Tsuyoshi Nishioka when I arrived. Since this was the last game before the All Star Game and only a few days away from the start of the Olympics, there were a lot of camera crews and reporters.\n\nI saw a lot of familiar faces amongst the TV crews. There were people from Fuji TV, sports papers, and many other media outlets. It was seriously scorching hot on the field yesterday so I have a lot of respect for the journalists and their patience. It really takes a certain kind of person to go get a story day after day no matter what the weather has in store.\n\nIt was great to see members of Team Japan out practicing before the game. The Marines players must have no clue who I am and why I am there… but it was nice to watch things unfold on the field. Here is a picture of Satozaki out at practice yesterday (and you can also see Saburo in the background getting ready to catch).\n\nSatozaki, Naruse, and Nishioka adorn the cover of the Marines magazine this week. They are on the cover with an image of the Japanese flag in the background. There aren’t any home games at Marine Stadium before the 13th so I was really, really fortunate to be able to catch these guys before they head off to the Beijing Olympics.\n\nCoach Frank Ramppen had to fill me in about Monday’s game and to explain why Ohmatsu was being greeted like a rock star. I had no idea how amazingly well Shouitsu Ohmatsu (no. 10) has been doing this season but he hits when it counts. He has had a lot of great hits. For example, he hit a three-run homer on Monday after the Rakuten Eagles were up 3-0. According to his profile, he played in 77 games in the 2007 season and this year he has already played in 94. At the rate he is hitting you can bet to see him in a lot more.\n\nYay! I got a picture with Frank. If you ever see him riding his bike around the Makuhari area, just remember that he is one of the nicest foreigners around town. I met his wife (gorgeous!) and his kids (soooooo cute!!) last night during the game. Really, really nice family. It’s been a pleasure helping translate/interpret for them during my time in Chiba City. I hope that they enjoy the rest of their stay in Japan.\n\nThough you can only see the back of Larry, you know that he is hard at work. If you are a foreigner, group of foreigners etc. who love watching baseball and want to come out to a game, he is the person to get in contact with. It can be a bit challenging trying to figure out how to buy tickets or box seats etc. through the Japanese ticket-buying system but Larry is the expert and can help you sort things out. I really hope that more people will come out and experience the fun at Marine Stadium, especially in the summer. The fireworks are a blast and so is the dancing at the end of the evening outside the stadium. Many of the games are also sponsored so you may have a chance to walk away with prizes.\n\nSummer vacation has finally arrived for children in Japan! I just took a list of all of the great things going on at Marine stadium this summer and thought I would share what I discovered.\n\nHere is a list of some of the regular events taking place at the stadium:\n\n1. Photo areas (July 28 and 29, Aug 13 – 18, 24 – 28) : There will be life-size cutouts of the star players set up at special photo booths. There will also be life-size blow up picture of the posters with players and game schedules (Imae, Ohmatsu, etc.) One neat Olympic addition is that there will be life-size cutouts of Marines players who are off to Beijing in their old uniforms. That’s Naruse, Tsuyoshi, and Satozaki.\n\nWhere: Third floor, third base side, gate 20 concourse\n\n2. “Marines Bon Odori” -Japanese summer festival dance (July 28 – 29, August 13 – 18, 24 – 28) : Marines mascots (Mar-kun, Rin-chan, Zu-kun), and the M-Splash cheerleaders will lead summer festival dances after the games to the tune of “We Love Marines Bon Odori” – there will be other songs too. Come join in the festivities.\n\nWhere/when: 20 min post game, in front of Marines Stadium and the bus terminal loop\n\n3. “Makuhari Fire” – fireworks (July 28 – 29, August 13 – 18, 24 – 28) : The fireworks are back! Fireworks will fill the sky at Marines Stadium at the bottom of the fifth.\n\nWhen: Bottom of the fifth inning\n\n4. Fireworks tour (July 28 – 29, August 13 – 18, 24 – 28) : You and your child (10 and under) can enjoy the fireworks from the field! Two children per guardian. Note: A guardian must be present.\n\nWhere/when: First 100 couple/pairs to line up at F gate before the game. Numbered tickets will be given out 30 min before the start of the game.\n\nI hope this helps convince some of you out there to hop on a train to Makuhari! You can spend hours and hours enjoying your time at Marine Stadium and the surrounding neighbourhood. If you find yourself looking for a few hours to kill, I suggest wondering around the Makuhari outlet and going for a good crepe or two.\n\nAnd yes, I am kicking myself for booking my flight home on the 12th. Wanted to catch a full day at Marine Stadium before heading back to Canada but the first home game in August is on the 13th…\n\nSENDAI – Honestly, yesterday was the perfect day at Kleenex Stadium (K-sta). My friend Aki and I were very, very lucky to have geen given guest passes for the day. We hung out with Bobby Valentine in the dugout and the Marines are in forth place!!! They won their fifth game in a row to put them only seven games behind Seibu. Love it!\n\nWhen we walked inside the stadium, there were many cameras pointed in the direction of Rick Short (no. 55, Eagles). It took me a while to figure out what was going on but he was being interviewed for the All Star Game. Rick has been having a great year. He is 35, has played for the Eagles for a couple of seasons and is batting .330 at the moment. This puts him just behind Nakajima of Seibu in the Pacific League.\n\nAfter Rick headed out, the crowd was still waiting for Masahiro Tanaka (no. 18, Eagles) – so we decided to wait too. I’ve been a big fan of Tanaka since coming to Japan in summer 2006. I arrived right in the middle of the Tanaka vs Saito showdown at the summer koshien and was blown away by the intensity of the whole experience. I’m not sure if I can say this without being corrected, but I think that it is safe to say that I am Canada’s number one Masahiro Tanaka fan.\n\nOn to the Marines dugout. As we headed out to the field, we passed Saburo (no. 3) and Kazuya Fukuura (no. 9) and got to experience the turf and the blazing sun. I can’t imagine what it is like to be out there in the field for hours and hours in the hot hot sun. It must have been around 30 degrees yesterday and it was hot enough sitting in the plush-reclining K-sta seats. I noticed the Team 26 uniform hanging so I had to take a picture (it was also hanging next to a ceiling fan so it was a great place to stand). We chatted to Bobby for a while and was really blown away by his attempts to learn Kanji. Since March, he has learned 1400 kanji (that’s more than I know). He really know how to go after what he wants.\n\nCoach Frank Ramppen is a gem (he organized this for us) and is honestly one of the nicest people I have met in Japan. I know I have said this before but the guys who work for and play for the Marines are really great people. I met Tomoya Satuzaki (no.22)!!! He is the best catcher in Japan – no, really. He was designated team captain last year, was solid at the 2007 Asia Championships, and got Japan a spot in the Beijing Olympics to name a few of his recent accomplishments.\n\nWe also got to chat to Benny Agbayani (was hero of Saturday’s game against the Eagles), Brian Sikorski (who pitched really well during yesterday’s game), Shunichi Nemoto (who has been having a great season), and Jose Ortiz (he had some nice hits this weekend) – to name a few. Oh! wait!! I also had a brief chat with Yuta Ohmine (no. 1) about his hometown Ishigaki Island and Kara-age kun (no. 19)!!! Seriously, Karakawa is 100 times cuter in person. He has a smile that will light up a room and is really well spoken for someone who just turned 19 a week ago. I hope he has a long, fruitful career, and wish him the best for the rest of the season.\n\nThe game was great too. The boys beat the Eagles 7-2 and won their third straight game against them. It must have hurt the home team’s fans to have lost every game during fan appreciation week… My friend and I were lucky enough to sit near other Marines fans so when I was busy cheering for the Marines I didn’t receive any death threats. Loved that Tsuyoshi Nishioka (no. 7, who the ladies looove and will be at the All Star Game) came on later in the game to turn the tide. He had the “hero interview” at the end. It also made my day to see Imae (no. 8), Nishioka, and Saburo’s names on the scoreboard at the same time. They are my hometown batting super stars. It’s safe to say that I can go on gushing about yesterday for hours so I think I will end the post here.\n\nStay tuned for the pictures."
