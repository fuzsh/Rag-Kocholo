        "text": "It wasn’t the move to defense, or the occasional defeat that frustrates Luis Cruz.\n\nNo, it’s the fact this is his final season at New Jersey City University.\n\nThe former West Windsor-Plainsboro South star has done everything the program has asked through his four years and done it very well.\n\n“He is the only true senior we have,” said NJCU coach Joe Cullen. “He’s been through it all. He’s seen the highs and the lows and when it comes to leadership he’s the one everyone is going to look to. The classroom and community stuff is all A+ as well. Everything he does, he does well.”\n\nA biology major, Cruz has always played up front or in the midfield, but this year he was asked to move to center back and he has made the adjustment a smooth one.\n\nBeing the only four-year program guy, Cruz has earned the respect of his teammates and when they need guidance they search him out.\n\n“I tell the team I’ve seen it all,” said Cruz. “I’ve seen seasons wen didn’t win a game and I’ve seen seasons where we started out with seven straight wins. I’ve learned a lot on and off the field. It’s something I would go and do again, but it’s frustrating that this is my last year.”\n\nCruz can recall WW-P South coach Bryan Fisher moving him to varsity late in his freshman season and how that moved helped him develop confidence.\n\nA confidence that has just grown at NJCU.\n\n“I’m much more mature,” said Cruz. “If someone had told me my senior year at South that in four years I’d be playing center-back at New Jersey City I would’ve told you that’s crazy. But, I learned that with sacrifice comes great things. As long as I’m on the field I just want to do what is in the best interest of the team.”\n\nIt’s not just as a player that Cruz has matured.\n\n“I’ve become a better leader and I’ve learned how to manage my time better,” admitted Cruz. “I try to work off campus in the community as much as I can. Being a college athlete is not easy, but being here for four years is definitely a blessing.”\n\nThe soccer field is the place where Cruz’ hectic schedule with school, fraternity, community service and being a captain all calms down, it’s his haven.\n\nApuzzi Off to Fast Start\n\nLuke Apuzzi (Lawrenceville) had seven tackles in his first game for Williams.
