        "text": "Luis Cruz returns to the lineup as the Dodgers take on the Angels on Thursday afternoon at Camelback Ranch, the first of two straight days of playing the Halos in a home-and-home of sorts. The Dodgers have a split squad on Friday, sending some to Tempe to play the Angels while keeping some at Camelback Ranch to face the Padres.\n\nCruz was scratched in each of the last two days while battling what was believed to be the flu.\n\nClayton Kershaw makes his second start of the spring for the Dodgers, and will be followed by Ted Lilly, making his first Cactus League appearance. Also scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers are Peter Moylan, Steve Ames, and Josh Wall.\n\nSkip Schumaker is the first repeat leadoff hitter, as he bats first and plays center field on Thursday. Here are the lineups:\n\nAngels\n\nBourjos CF\n\nAybar SS\n\nKendrick 2B\n\nTrumbo 1B\n\nWells LF\n\nCallaspo 3B\n\nIannetta DH\n\nHester C\n\nGrichuk RF\n\nJerome Williams starts for the Angels.\n\nDodgers\n\nSchumaker CF\n\nEllis 2B\n\nEthier DH\n\nCruz 3B\n\nMoore LF\n\nEllis C\n\nPunto SS\n\nUribe 1B\n\nAmezaga RF\n\nScheduled reserves for the Dodgers are:\n\nHerrera CF\n\nSellers 2B\n\nMartinez 3B\n\nBarden LF\n\nFlores C\n\nGordon SS\n\nMcPherson 1B\n\nEvans RF\n\nNick Evans, who has played two games in left field in addition to games at first and third base, gets time in right field today. Dallas McPherson's 17 innings played at first base so far this spring is second on the club to the 18 innings at the position by Adrian Gonzalez.\n\nGame info\n\nTime: 12:05 p.m. PT\n\nTV: Prime Ticket\n\nRadio:570 KLAC"
