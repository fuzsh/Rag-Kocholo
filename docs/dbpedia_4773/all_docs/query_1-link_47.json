        "text": "Luis Cruz Azaceta, born 1942, is a Cuban American visual artist.\n\nHe left Cuba as a teenager in 1960. After immigrating to the United States, Azaceta lived in New York, graduated from The School of Visual Arts and began his long career as an artist.\n\nSince the late 1970s the paintings and drawings of Luis Cruz Azaceta have been addressing the moral and ethical pulse of this country. Early works focused on urban violence, the Aids epidemic, and racism. His current works relate to the rapid state of change in the world at large - war, terrorism, displacement, identity, and collapsing economies.\n\nAzaceta is a devotee of visual experiment who often develops parallel series in several media at once, combining materials in totally unexpected ways, as with his extended series of photographs mounted on twisted metal stud. Azaceta works constantly and is extremely prolific.\n\nFor Azaceta, art is a way of facing the world. He recognizes that change is inevitable, and that all of us are implicated by reality and time passing. The world we inhabit is contingent and changing; and chaos is an inherent part of the process. This is the reality we all share and which we all too often ignore."
