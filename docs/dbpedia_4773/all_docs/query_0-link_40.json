        "text": "New York Yankees\n\nThe New York Yankees selected Laird in the 27th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft.[6] He signed with the Yankees.\n\nOn August 2, 2010, Laird was promoted from the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League.[7] Laird was named both the Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year of the Eastern League in 2010, following a breakout season.[8] Following the 2010 season, he was added to the Yankees' 40 man roster in order to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft.[9]\n\nLaird was promoted to the majors for the first time on July 18, 2011, when Ramiro PeÃ±a was placed on the disabled list.[10] On July 22, at Yankee Stadium, Laird made his major league debut, and got his first major league hit and RBI against Oakland Athletics pitcher Craig Breslow on a single to center field. He scored his first run earlier in the game, scoring on a single by Nick Swisher after working a walk off of A's pitcher Joey Devine. The Yankees designated Laird for assignment on August 27, 2012.[11]\n\nHokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters\n\nIn November 2014, Laird signed with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).[20] Laird struggled to start the 2015 season with Hokkaido, batting under .200 into June. On the final day of the All Star break, Fighters third base coach Shirai took Laird out to dinner at a local sushi restaurant to get him to relax. The chef, a big Fighters fan, suggested that Laird should act like he is making sushi when he got into the batter's box to intimidate the pitcher. The next day, he did not do the gesture getting into the batter's box, but after he hit a home run, he acted like he was making sushi and thus the nickname \"sushi boy\" was born.[21] He started to gain momentum after that performance and had a nice second half, finishing his first season in NPB with 34 home runs and a batting average of .231.[22]\n\nIn 2016, Laird led the Pacific League with 39 home runs. He hit the game-winning home run in Game 4 of the 2016 Japan Series,[23] and a grand slam in Game 6. Laird won the Japan Series Most Valuable Player Award.[24]\n\nLaird spent the 2017 and 2018 seasons with the club, but failed to reach an agreement on a contract extension prior to the 2019 season and became a free agent.[25]"
