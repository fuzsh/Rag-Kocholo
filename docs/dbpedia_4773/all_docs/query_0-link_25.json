        "text": "The Chiba Lotte Marines (千葉ロッテマリーンズ, Chiba Rotte Marīnzu) are a professional baseball team in Japan's Pacific League based in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture, in the Kantō region, and owned by Lotte Holdings Co., Ltd. The Marines were a founding member of the Pacific League in 1950 as the Mainichi Orions when the Japanese Baseball League reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball, where they won the inaugural 1950 Japan Series. Since 1992, the Marines' home ballpark has been ZOZO Marine Stadium, located in the Mihama Ward of Chiba, seating 30,118 people.\n\nThe \"Marines\" name originates from the name of the stadium they play in, which is officially named Chiba Marine Stadium, because the stadium is located right on the water.\n\nThrough 2022, the franchise's all-time record is 4733-4701-394 (.501).\n\nHistory\n\nThe Marines franchise began in 1950 as the Mainichi Orions, an inaugural member of the Pacific League, and were owned by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. The Orions were named after the constellation of the same name. The Marines won the inaugural Japan Series in 1950.\n\nIn 1958, the team was merged with the Daiei Unions and renamed the Daimai Orions, to reflect that both Daiei and Mainichi had a 50% stake in the team, with control being given to Daiei Film president Masaichi Nagata. In 1964 they became the Tokyo Orions, and the Lotte Orions in 1969. The franchise was slow to replicate its initial success: the Orions made the Japan Series in 1960 and 1970, only to lose both years.\n\nThe team played in central Tokyo until 1972. From 1973 to 1977 the Lotte Orions played in the northern Japanese city of Sendai. In 1974, they beat the Chunichi Dragons, becoming the first Pacific League team to win the Series in ten years, as the Yomiuri Giants had claimed the prior nine titles behind the Oh–Nagashima attack. After beating the Dragons, their owners, Lotte Holdings, decided to hold their victory parade in Tokyo, which shocked fans in Sendai. This eventually caused their attendance there to crash, from sold out games in 1973, to only about 2000-3000 for their last few years in Sendai.\n\nIn 1977, the Orions signed Major League Baseball player Leron Lee, who ended up playing for the team for eleven seasons, compiling a .320 career batting average and slugging 283 home runs with 912 career RBI. From his retirement to early 2018 (when surpassed by Norichika Aoki), Lee held the Japanese record for career batting average (players with more than 4,000 at bats). In 1978, Lee invited younger brother Leon Lee to play in Japan, and the brothers formed a feared cleanup for the Orions for five seasons — in 1980, Leron had 33 home runs, 90 RBI, and a batting average of .358; while Leon slugged 41 home runs and drove in 116 runs, with a batting average of .340.\n\nIn 1978 the team returned to the Tokyo area, settling in Kawasaki's Kawasaki Stadium, at one time home to the Taiyo Whales (today's Yokohama DeNA Baystars).\n\nIn 1992, the team moved to Chiba City's Chiba Marine Stadium on the eastern shore of Tokyo Bay. They held a fan vote for a new name for the team; the name \"Dolphins\" won, while another popular choice was \"Pirates\". However, the name \"Dolphins\" was thrown out because though an unrelated team named the Nagoya Dolphins was long defunct, the letter \"D\" in broadcasts was already taken by the Dragons; while \"Pirates\" was disregarded because the Chiba Pirates name was used by a team in a baseball manga, and since the team in that manga is terrible, executives thought it would look bad on the real team. \"Marines\" was ultimately chosen because the team believed it meant \"heroes of the sea\" (and because the letter \"M\" was available), yielding the club name Chiba Lotte Marines. Originally, the club used pink, blue, and white on their logo, which included a pirate ship, with a seagull below it, and a wave pattern to reflect the ocean currents off Chiba's coast. In 1995, this was changed to the logo's current design, while dropping pink and blue in favor of red, black and white (with red being dropped in 2019). The current logo's design features a baseball in the background with a seagull soaring, with the club's name around the circle.\n\nThe team failed to reach the Japan Series again until 2005. The Marines started the 2005 season in first place behind American manager Bobby Valentine, who had returned after having managed the team to a 2nd place finish in 1995 behind the Orix BlueWave, but struggles between him and general manager Tatsuro Hirooka had him leave after that lone season, but fell behind the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks as the year progressed. Under the playoff format of the time, the preliminary five-game playoff round, prior to the Japan Series, saw the teams with the best first and second half records face off. The Marines defeated the Hawks three games to two in the Pacific League championship, winning the rubber match despite entering the eighth inning trailing, 2–1.\n\nThe Marines thus qualified for the Japan Series, the first time they had reached the tournament since 1974, a 31-year drought. In a one-sided series, the Marines swept the Hanshin Tigers in four games, scoring ten runs in each of the first three games. The apparent ease with which the Marines defeated the Tigers added fuel to the ongoing debate concerning the need for a playoff system in the Central League, which was finally added in 2007 (see Climax Series). The Marines went on to defeat South Korea's Samsung Lions in the final round of the Konami Cup Championships.\n\nIn 2010, the Marines clinched third place on the last day of the season to earn a berth into the Climax Series. They went on to become the first third place team to ever win the Climax Series, and faced off with the Chunichi Dragons in the 2010 Japan Series. The Marines defeated the Dragons in seven games, composed of four wins, two losses, and one tie, winning their second Japan Series in under ten years.\n\nIn 2013, the Marines clinched third place to clinch a berth in the Climax Series and faced the Saitama Seibu Lions in the first stage. They defeated the Lions in 3 games to move onto the final stage. They would lose to the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in 5 games, who would go on and defeat the Yomiuri Giants in 7 games to win their first (and still only) Japan Series title.\n\nThey would make it back in the playoffs in 2015. They defeated the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in 3 games in the first round, then got swept by the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, who received a one game advantage for having the best record in the Pacific League.\n\nThe following season, they returned to the playoffs. They would make a much earlier exit, as they were swept by the Hawks in 2 games in the first stage.\n\nIt would not be until 2020 when they returned to the playoffs. The Hawks, with a 1 game advantage, would sweep them again in the first stage.\n\nThey bounced back the following year by defeating the Eagles in 2 games in the first stage, including a tie in the second game which allowed them to advance as they had the better record at 67-57-19, while the Eagles had a 66-62-15 record. They got swept by the Orix Buffaloes in the final stage in 3 games, however a tie in the third game and Orix having the better record at 70-55-18, allowed the Buffaloes to advance.\n\nOn April 10, 2022, Rōki Sasaki threw a perfect game, NPB's first in 28 years and the 16th in NPB history. Sasaki tied an existing NPB record by striking out 19 batters, and setting a new record by striking out 13 consecutive batters. It didn't do much to help the season, as the Marines finished in 5th place with a 69-73-1 record, and Tadahito Iguchi would be let go after that season, replaced by Masato Yoshii.\n\nThe Marines would edge out the Hawks and Eagles in a close playoff race in 2023, finishing 2nd with a 70-68-5 record. They would defeat the Hawks in 3 games in the first stage, but lost in 5 games to the Buffaloes in the final stage, who also had a 1 win advantage for having the best record in Pacific League. That season would be the last for ZOZO Marine Stadium public address announcer Emi Taniho. Originally, she was given a farewell ceremony on October 7, 2023, her supposed last home game, which included many former Marines players, but she was given extended duty, as the Marines were appearing to make a run for the Climax Series.

It was inspired by some teams in other sports (such as football, which retires \"12\" for the \"12th man\", or basketball, which retires \"6\" for the \"6th man\").The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles has the No. 10 retired in similar fashion. MLB's Los Angeles Angels has retired No. 26, in same fashion, for the founder Gene Autry.\n\nManagers\n\nNo. Years\n\nin office YR Managers G W L T Win% Pacific League\n\nchampionships Japan Series\n\nchampionships Playoff\n\nberths 1 1950–1951 2 Yuasa, Yoshio 230 135 85 10 .614 1 (1950) 1 (1950) 2 1952 1 Yuasa, Yoshio\n\nBetto, Kaoru (1st) 120 75 45 0 .625 3 1953 1 Wakabayashi, Tadashi 120 56 62 2 .475 4 1954–1959 6 Betto, Kaoru (2nd) 834 467 341 26 .578 5 1960 1 Nishimoto, Yukio 133 82 48 3 .631 1 (1960) 6 1961–1962 2 Uno, Mitsuo 272 132 136 4 .493 7 1963–1965 3 Hondo, Yasuji 440 203 227 10 .472 8 1966 1 Tamaru, Hitoshi 134 61 69 4 .469 9 1967 1 Tokura, Katsuki ,\n\nNonin, Watarui 137 61 69 7 .469 10 1968–1970 3 Nonin, Watarui 399 216 164 19 .568 1 (1970) 11 1971 1 Nonin, Watarui ,\n\nOhsawa, Keiji 130 80 46 4 .635 12 1972 1 Ohsawa, Keiji 130 59 68 3 .465 13 1973–1978 6 Kaneda, Masaichi (1st) 780 374 339 67 .525 1 (1974) 1 (1974) 2 (1974,1977) 14 1979–1981 3 Yamauchi, Kazuhiro 390 182 171 37 .516 2 (1980,1981) 15 1982–1983 2 Yamamoto, Kazuyoshi 260 97 145 18 .401 16 1984–1986 3 Inao, Kazuhisa 390 185 175 30 .514 17 1987–1989 3 Arito, Michiyo 390 153 213 24 .418 18 1990–1991 2 Kaneda, Masaichi (2nd) 260 105 148 7 .415 19 1992–1994 3 Yagisawa, Soroku 390 160 224 6 .417 20 1995 1 Valentine, Bobby (1st) 130 69 58 3 .543 21 1996 1 Ejiri, Akira 130 60 67 3 .472 22 1997–1998 2 Kondo, Akihito 270 118 147 5 .445 23 1999–2003 5 Yamamoto, Koji 690 324 352 14 .479 24 2004–2009 6 Valentine, Bobby (2nd) 837 425 392 20 .520 1 (2005) 1 (2005) 2 (2005,2007) 25 2010–2012 3 Nishimura, Norifumi 432 191 213 28 .472 1 (2010) 1 (2010) 26 2013–2017 5 Itoh, Tsutomu 717 339 368 10 .473 3 times\n\n(2013,2015,2016) 27 2018–2022 5 Iguchi, Tadahito 692 324 338 30 .489 1 (2020,2021) 28 2023– 1 Yoshii, Masato 0 0 0 0 .000 0 Totals 71 seasons 23 managers 9,551 4,597 4,580 374 .501 5 times 4 times 11 times\n\nStatistics current through the end of the 2020 season.\n\nCheer dancers\n\nThe Marines' cheer dancing squad is known as M☆Splash!!. They were formed in 2004. Alongside the team's mascots Mar-kun, Rine-chan and Zu-chan, they entertain the crowd during Marines games, with 27 members.\n\nMascots\n\nMar-kun (マーくん, Maa-kun) is a main mascot character of the Marines. With his girlfriend Rine-chan (リーンちゃん, Riin-chan) and his young brother Zu-chan (ズーちゃん, Zuu-chan), he entertains spectators at team games. Their name is a separateness of the team name. Originally Rine-chan wore a pink sports visor cap till the 2022 season when she wore the same baseball cap as her boyfriend while retaining the skirt, while Zu-chan wears the cap backwards and wears an apron instead of the jersey beginning 2022, before that he wore a shirt unless all three wear their team's special home uniforms.\n\nMysterious fish (謎の魚, Nazo-no-sakana) was a mascot character that was introduced in May 2017. He is a weird fish with legs. He has collaborated with Hawaiian Airlines that former Marines' player Benny Agbayani works for, since 2018. However, the person playing the mascot announced after the 2021 season that he would retire, which also meant the mascot was officially retired.\n\nBack when the team were known as the \"Lotte Orions\", their mascot was a character known simply as Bubble-Boy (バブル坊や, Bable-Boya) who only appeared as a logo.\n\nIn 2005, the Marines introduced a mascot named Cool-kun ( かっこいいくん, Kakkoi-kun), a penguin who was known for his acrobatic stunts and would often challenge mascots like Doala and B.B to acrobatic stunt contests at rival games. He also would be stuck up and rude at times, but he would burst to tears or show great emotion at the right time. Despite being friends with Mar-kun, they do not get along very well. In 2016, he was retired by the team.\n\nMinor League team\n\nThe Marines farm team plays in the Eastern League. The team was founded as the Mainichi Glitter Orions in 1950.\n\nSee also\n\nIn Spanish: Chiba Lotte Marines para niños"
