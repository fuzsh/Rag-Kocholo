        "text": "When Kodai Senga delivered a 99-mile-per-hour fastball to Luis Arraez of the Miami Marlins on April 2, he became the 14th Japanese player to appear in a game for the Mets, the most of any team in the major leagues. The Seattle Mariners are next with 11.\n\nIt is a connection fostered over the years, with enthusiastic support from Bobby Valentine, the former Mets manager, who has led teams in both the United States and Japan. And the pipeline, it appears, goes both ways: This season, five of the 12 managers in Nippon Professional Baseball spent at least part of their playing careers with the Mets.\n\nThe rookie managers Masato Yoshii of the Chiba Lotte Marines and Kazuo Matsui of the Seibu Lions, along with Tsuyoshi Shinjo, the second-year manager of the Nippon-Ham Fighters, all made their major league debuts with the Mets. Shingo Takatsu of the Yakult Swallows and Kazuhisa Ishii of the Rakuten Golden Eagles played in Queens after starting elsewhere.\n\nThe unique nature of the Mets connection is not lost on Yoshii.\n\n“Each of us played for the Mets,” he said recently in Japanese when asked to name the N.P.B. managers with major league playing experience. “That’s really interesting. I wonder if it’s coincidental or something more?”\n\nYoshii’s tenure with the Mets came first, with him jumping straight to the majors in 1998 after a strong season pitching for the Swallows. Some of the Mets’ Japanese players had short stints, like Takatsu, a right-handed reliever who made only nine appearances for the team in 2005. Others had more substantial runs, like Matsui, who had 949 plate appearances for the team from 2004 to 2006.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
