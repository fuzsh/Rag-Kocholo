Each week, comedian Larry Miller tells stories from his own life, in the tradition of great American radio raconteurs like Jean Shepherd and Garrison Keilor. Miller’s genteel tales are witty without being stuffy and uplifting without being naive. Join the party! It’s time well spent!

Larry is known for his roles in Waiting For Guffman, Best in Show and 10 Things I Hate About You, as well as his standup comedy.
