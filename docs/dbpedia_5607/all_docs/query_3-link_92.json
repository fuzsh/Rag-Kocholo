        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers announced Saturday that team president Larry Miller, who held that position for five years, has stepped down. Jason Quick of The Oregonian reported that Miller would be taking his old job as president of Jordan Brand at Nike, where he was from 1999-2006.\n\nThe move comes in a time of flux for the Trail Blazers, who just hired general manager Neil Olshey away from the Clippers, despite, according to the brilliant Ben Golliver at Blazers Edge, Miller disagreeing with the decision. Golliver provided insight into just what kind of president Miller has been and the possible rationale for his leaving.\n\nHere is the Blazers' press release announcing Miller's departure. Nike will welcome him back with open arms, as will basketball sneakerheads who have been disappointed with Jordan Brand since Miller left."
