        "text": "As one of Hollywood’s most recognizable faces, Larry Miller has appeared in over 50 films and numerous television shows. Miller began his career with a memorable role as the brown-nosing store manager in Pretty Woman and has gone on to delight audiences in some of the most unforgettable roles in such films as Best In Show, Waiting For Guffman, 10 Things I Hate About You, The Princess Diaries I&II and The Nutty Professor I&II.\n\nIn addition to acting, Miller is a contributing humorist to The Weekly Standard. He recently finished writing his first book Spoiled Rotten America, adding his own clever commentary to today’s political discourse.\n\nMiller was most recently seen in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, starring Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer as well as the critically acclaimed documentary The Aristocrats, which featured 100 of the world’s most well-known comedians telling the dirtiest joke ever heard. He will next be seen in the upcoming films Keeping Up With The Steins, starring opposite Jeremy Piven and For Your Consideration, which was written and directed by Christopher Guest and starring an ensemble cast which includes Eugene Levy and Catherine O’Hara.\n\nHis numerous television credits include the hit shows Desperate Housewives, Law & Order, and Seinfeld, along with recurring roles on Boston Legal, 8 Simple Rules And Mad About You. Miller has also made regular appearances on Real Time With Bill Maher, The Tonight Show With Jay Leno and Late Show With David Letterman, as well as starring in several of his own HBO comedy specials and on Broadway in Neil Simon’s play The Dinner Party, opposite Jon Lovitz.

Thank you for all of your assistance in our on going endeavors.\"\n\n- Assistance League of Newport Beach, CA\n\n\"It was a real pleasure having Larry join us for our campaign thank you event. He was very well received by the audience and his Jewish message was strong and right on target. He also made himself completely available to us from the time we picked him up at the hotel, until the program was over. He would be a wonderful addition to any Federation program.\"\n\n- United Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh\n\n\"Unlike so many guest entertainers traveling to what could be considered the sticks, Miller made us feel like he was truly delighted to be in Oklahoma City and meet and make new friends. He left our community with a whole host of new friends and fans who will closely follow his career far into the future. I would highly recommend using Larry Miller for any event. He delivers!\"\n\n- Variety Health Center, OK"
