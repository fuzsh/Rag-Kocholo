        "text": "Catch comedian Flip Schultz at the Improv October 2 & October 3.\n\nTickets available here.\n\nWhen Flip Schultz was 8 years old, he won a summer camp talent show by performing stand-up comedy. There was never a doubt in his mind that comedy would be his future. After leaving as one of the hottest and most requested comics in South Florida, Flip moved cross country to Los Angeles where his funny and well-crafted jokes, combined with his physicality, improvisation & hilarious characters, has made him a favorite on the LA comedy scene and a regular at the world famous Hollywood Improv & Comedy Store.\n\nHe has also had the pleasure of sharing the stage with such performers as: Lewis Black, George Carlin, Dana Carvey, Jeff Duhnum, Pablo Francisco, Jeff Garlin, David Alan Grier, Jamie Kennedy , Larry Miller, Jay Mohr, Kevin Pollack, and more."
