        "text": "Marcus Lane remembers what the standup comedy scene was like when he moved here in 2007.\n\nThere is a recurring joke about that kind of audience here, and it goes like this: “Chirp, chirp.”\n\nIt wasn’t Lane’s jokes that were causing the crickets to make a racket. There just wasn’t a market for local standup acts, said the comedian. Comedy clubs had come and gone, weekly comedy showcases at other clubs had petered out and Lane wasn’t aware of any standup performers based in the area other than himself.\n\n“I thought it was a lost cause, honestly,” he says.\n\nLane was undeterred, and he used Fayetteville as a launching pad for shows outside the area.\n\nIt was as good as any location for the Fort Smith native. It’s close to U.S. 71, Interstate 40 and other roads that could take him to gigs.\n\nLane is still based in Fayetteville, and he stillperforms comedy. But, unlike four years ago, there is a burgeoning standup scene in Fayetteville. An all-comedyopen mic night has been established in a local club, and at least two standup groups composed of local comedians- Fools on Parade and Lane’s own Expendables of Comedy - have surfaced in the past year.\n\nFor the first time in his memory, local comedian Troy Gittings says the local comedic talent and fan base are aligning.\n\nMaterial Things\n\nA visit to a local comedy-only open mic night, hosted byGittings, shows quite the hodgepodge of standup personalities. Gittings is happy to note that during the five weeks that he’s been overseeing a comedians-only open mic night at West End in Fayetteville, many people have come to the microphone for the first time.\n\nThese open mic nights are vital for several reasons, he explained. First, it gives comedians the opportunity to polish new material. Telling a new joke and flopping isn’t nearly as bad at an open mic night as it is in front of a paying crowd expecting ace material.\n\nSecondly, it keeps the scene alive by giving new comedians a chance to try their skills.\n\n“The more people who are involved, the better longevity (the scene) will have,” says Bentonville resident Brian Spence, who has been performing for about a year and a half. “It’s like having a deep bench on a basketball team.”\n\nGittings encouraged bar patrons at one of the Tuesday night sessions to give it a chance. Specifically, those people whose friends tell them they are funny are prime candidates, he said.\n\nAt the open mic events hosted by Gittings, comedians sign up for a spot and the show order is selected at random. An emcee introduces each participant, and the unscripted nature of the event ensures a diverse collection of acts. On Tuesday night, for instance, participants ranged from comics such as Spence, who offered Mitch Hedbergstyle one-off jokes (such as: “A surefire way to avoid parking tickets is to remove the windshield wipers from your car”) to Christy Hall, who offered a series of songs, including one about a smartphone application with nefarious purposes.\n\nThere are few rules about content or style, but comedians are given a fixed amount of time, an amount depending on the number of comedians participating on the night in question.\n\nGittings said that thegroup prides itself on being inclusive.\n\n“You’re around supportive comedians. … An open mic is for everyone,” he said.\n\nComedy Collectives\n\nFor som e, co medy open mics, surrounded by supporting friends and perhaps the encouragement of a few drinks, are the pinnacle of their comedic achievement.\n\nBut for folks like Gittings, comedy has become an increasingly worthwhile pursuit. He has a full-time job as a school teacher, but he’s been working the local open mic scene for about a year and a half. That’s how he met Spence, who was heading up an open mic at Drifters in Fayetteville. They also spent time performing at open mic nights at Rogue Pizza Co. on Dickson Street in Fayetteville, although those showcases were not comedy-specific and the comedians often had to compete with slam poets, songwriters and others for time at the microphone.\n\nAs the number of performers in the area grew, so did the scope of their ideas.\n\nLast fall, as the Sylvester Stallone movie “The Expendables” was in theaters, Lane got the idea to put together a team of comedians who would perform both locally and beyond. That team became The Expendables of Comedy, and the group made its debut in October at Rogue.\n\nIn the months that followed, Lane, Anthony Waits, Seth Dees and Doug Shadell have visited several locations in Arkansas but also perform close to home, as they did Aug. 20 at the UArk Ballroom in Fayetteville. Lane serves as the headliner, and the other comedians open or serve as emcee for the event.\n\nThe comedians vary wildly in substance and style. Among the group, Lane noted, are a black man, a gay man, a half-Hispanic man and a video game nerd, all of whom have a diverse range of life experiences to draw from. It’s usually R-rated, with comedianscovering topics such as sex, drugs and, perhaps not rock ’n’ roll, but there didn’t seem to be many topics off limits.\n\nDees talked about his cat farting. Waits had a bit about the high visibility levels of American tourists. Lane told the audience his favorite part of his George Foreman brand grill was the sauce pan at the bottom.\n\nThough the size of the crowds in Fayetteville are not yet what Lane and others dream about, Lane insists there is a need for such events.\n\n“Obviously, there is a market. … We’ve got something really good going,” he said.\n\nGittings has the same high hopes for Fools on Parade. That group had its first show on April Fool’s Day - hence the name - of this year. It formed, Gittings admits, in part because he was not among the local comedians chosen by Lane for the Expendables troupe.\n\nThe scene was still growing,and Gittings realized he had enough talented friends to form another group.\n\nHe and comrades such as Zac Slusher and Spence prefer to call it a collective, a rotating cast of comedians who can be featured on local stages.\n\n“I knew enough of these dudes that I could put together a show,” Gittings said.\n\nFools on Parade has staged several shows on their own, with the most recent to take place two days ago.\n\n“This area is ripe for comedy. People want to laugh,” said Gittings.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nThat people are demanding comedy should come as no surprise, said Jodi Beznoska, the Walton Arts Center’s vice president of communications. Any growth in the comedy scene would be a parallel to the growth in demand for other creative disciplines, she said, and the ever-increasingnumber of Northwest Arkansas residents is the catalyst.\n\nThe Walton Arts Center has for at least a decade provided a third tier of standup comedy opportunities: big-name, big-ticket performers.\n\nAmong those who have performed at the Fayetteville facility are Bill Cosby, Brian Regan and more recently, Ron White, who sold out three shows there in May.\n\nThe goal is to have at least one big-name standup act per year, with the chance for more depending on venue availability and the routing needs of target performers.\n\nFor the center’s 2011-12 season, acts such as Larry Miller and Lewis Black are already slated to perform and other performers remain possibilities.\n\nThe market for such marquee acts remains strong in the area, said Jennifer Ross, the center’s director of programming.\n\nEven a touring group billedas the Nobodies of Comedy was met with a packed house, Ross said.\n\nOther venues have or will be hosting nationally recognized stand-up performers, too. The UArk Ballroom will tonight lend the stage to Paul Hooper, a North Carolina native who has appeared at the HBO Comedy Festival and other comedy competitions. On Sept. 9, the same venue will be the location of a threewoman showcase called the Funny Bitches Comedy Tour.\n\nIt’s hard to tell exactly what all the activity will mean for the local comedy scene. Lane hopes for an allcomedy club in Fayetteville. Gittings hopes newcomers keep taking the plunge and jumping onstage at the open mic nights.\n\nBut one thing he wonders about is not the growth of the scene. The only thing Gittings worries about is getting in the way of its momentum."
