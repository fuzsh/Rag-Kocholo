        "text": "The Raue Center for the Arts has invited comedians from the monthly \"Lucy's Comedy Cafe\" to join together for one big show on Friday.\n\nLucy’s Comedy Café, a monthly gig featuring standup comedians at the , has become a huge success.\n\nSo huge, in fact, Raue directors decided it was time to invite comedians back to the downtown theater, at 26 N. Williams St., for an encore performance — all in one night.\n\nAnd so it happens, the “Best of Lucy’s Comedy Café” show is set for 9 p.m. this Friday, Nov. 25, at the Raue.\n\nThe special lineup of entertainers includes Chicago’s own Pat McGann, Dwayne Kennedy, Denise Ramsden along with Rocky La Porte, who hales from Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\n“Lucy’s Café has been a stellar success,” Raue Executive Director Richard Kuranda said. “We decided to have a ‘Best of Lucy’s' and tickets have been selling so well we’ve moved the show to the big house.”\n\nLucy’s Comedy Café is a monthly show — held on the third Friday — where the audience seating is arranged on the Raue stage, giving viewers an up-close and personal experience with the performer. The intimate club-atmosphere setting only allows for 160 seats.\n\nSince the “Best of Lucy’s” tickets were selling so well, organizers expanded the performance to the full theater setting, now permitting 350 guests, Kuranda said.\n\n“This is the first time we’ve done a ‘Best of Lucy's,’ but the tickets are selling well,” Kuranda said. “What better way to spend an evening after being stuck with your family all week? People should come on out and have a good time.”\n\nBut the laughs don’t stop there.\n\nComedian Larry Miller — First Appearance at Raue\n\nPost-Thanksgiving weekend has been dubbed “Comedy Weekend” by the Raue. Therefore, on Saturday night, renown comedian Larry Miller makes his first appearance on the main stage.\n\n“Cocktails With Larry Miller” is scheduled for 8 p.m., where Miller will share his perspective on marriage, children and drinking during the one-man show.\n\nMiller has a long list of television and movie credentials, having appeared in the Nutty Professor, Pretty Woman, A Mighty Wind, Valentine’s Day and more. Kuranda, who caught Miller’s show while in New York recently, described Miller as “one of the wittiest, hardest working guys in comedy right now.”\n\n“If you look at Larry’s website, there are at least 15 nationally televised shows/ movies from now until Dec. 4 that Larry has a role in,” Kuranda said.\n\nBox office details are available by calling (815) 356-9212. Both shows are for viewers age 18 and older.\n\nComedian Bios:\n\nLarry Miller: As one of Hollywood’s most recognizable faces, Miller has appeared in over 100 film and television shows. He began his career with a memorable scene alongside Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in the blockbuster film, Pretty Woman. He has since gone on to unforgettable roles in such films as The Princess Diaries, The Nutty Professor, Bee Movie and Ten Things I Hate About You. He is also a proud member of Christopher Guest’s ensemble cast in the films Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration.\n\nMiller has made dozens of appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman and Real Time with Bill Maher. He has also starred in his own HBO comedy specials and on Broadway in Neil Simon’s play, The Dinner Party. His other television credits include Desperate Housewives, Medium, Burn Notice, Law & Order and Seinfeld, in addition to a recurring role on Boston Legal.\n\nPat McGann: A standup comedian and television host, McGann was born and raised on the Chicago’s south side, and since has become a northsider, residing near the famous Zanies Comedy Club, where he has served as Zanie’s House MC since 2008, according to his website bio.\n\nMcCann is creator and host of the television show The Chicago Stand-Up Project airing on Chicago’s PBS station, WTTW. The show features famous Chicagoans - not known for comedy - attempting the art of stand up. In 2010, McCann was among an elite group of comedians invited to perform at The Great American Comedy Festival.\n\nDwayne Kennedy: Another Chicago native, but since transplanted to Los Angeles, Ca., Kennedy is a comedian, actor and screenwriter. He has performed in clubs nationwide and abroad, and Kennedy’s many television appearances include The Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Apollo, Premium Blend, and Comedy Central Presents.

The comedian has done a lot of charity work for St Jude’s for Children, NFL charities, homeless shelters, cancer research and police/fire department fundraisers.\n\nDenise Ramsden: Born and raised on the south side of Chicago, Ramsden loves to sarcastically pay tribute to her Irish Catholic upbringing. A favorite among female audiences, Ramsden’s natural, honest sense of humor also appeals to men. Ramsden discusses familiar topics and situations.\n\nRamsden continues to sharpen her comedic skills at Chicago clubs and weird one-nighters all over the Midwest.
