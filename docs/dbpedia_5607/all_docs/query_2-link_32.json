        "text": "Hopefully by now you have completely survived this past weekend and the St Patrick's celebrations that seemed to be everywhere (I was in Philly with my girlfriend and her daughter Saturday afternoon and it seemed like everyone was in Green and partying hard!) You may have been looking at yourself in the last 24 hours and said \"I swear I will never do that again!\" Most of us have been there once, and nobody describes this better than the extremely funny Larry Miller.\n\nMiller has made his living as a comedic actor having appeared in about 100 films over his career (which launched on the big screen with a security guard role in 3 Fugitives with Nick Nolte and Martin Short in 1989). His big break came in 1990 with an HBO appearance on the series One Night Stand, giving talented comedians their shot in a 30-minute special format. Miller nailed his moment with his now classic \"Five Levels Of Drinking\" (one of the funniest bits any comic has ever had on stage).\n\nThat moment helped Miller become a steady face and comic talent on films ranging from the college football farce Unnecessary Roughness in '91, to the Radioland Murders in '94, then playing the dean of the college that housed The Nutty Professor in '96 (and was back for the sequel in 2000), appearing in a string of Christoper Guest comedies (Waiting For Guffman, A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration and Best In Show), and many know Larry as Walter Stratford from the 1999 movie followed by the 2009 ABC Family series 10 Things I Hate About You.\n\nMiller is back on the road doing comedy with his \"Cocktails with Larry Miller\" tour. Should he come to South Jersey, buy the ticket and get ready to laugh loud and hard!\n\nNow if you are one you chose to go party hard over the weekend, enjoy Larry's theory of drinking - a bit over 20 years old and still hilarious!\n\nNow you know you have experienced something like this in your lifetime (if not personally, then through someone else)."
