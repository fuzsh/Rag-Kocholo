        "text": "December 30 • Maui Arts & Cultural Center\n\nDecember 31 • Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall\n\nPre-sale tickets available\n\nstarting Thursday, April 25 at 10:00 A.M. HST\n\nPre-sale Code: BILL2020\n\nTickets go on sale worldwide\n\nFriday, April 26 at 10:00 A.M. HST\n\nThe tradition continues! For the ninth year in a row, Bill Maher will be ringing in the New Year in Hawaii, at Maui Arts & Cultural Center (December 30) and Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall (December 31). To make this year’s celebration extra memorable, Bill will be joined by two very special guests, Sarah Silverman and Larry Miller. With his sold-out shows for the past eight years, Maher continues to make good on his promise to be the “Don Ho of New Year’s.”\n\nConcert promoter Rick Bartalini Presents will honor Hawaii residents and military with an exclusive Kamaʻāina pre-sale so that they may purchase the best seats first. Starting Thursday, April 25 at 10:00 A.M., Kamaʻāina can use pre-sale code BILL2020 to get early access to tickets before they go on sale to the general public. Hawaii fans may purchase up to eight tickets each. Pre-sale is on-line only and runs until 10:00 P.M. HST the same day. Tickets go on sale to the general public starting Friday, April 26 at 10:00 A.M.\n\nMaher began his career as a stand-up comedian and still performs sold-out dates across the country. But he may be best known for his television programming, which has never held back and has set the boundaries of where funny and political talk can go on American television. First on Politically Incorrect (Comedy Central, ABC, 1993-2002) and for the last 10 years on HBO’s Real Time, Maher’s combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs has earned him 34 Emmy nominations; winning his first in 2014 as the Executive Producer for HBO’s Vice. In 2008, he wrote and starred in Religulous directed by Larry Charles (Borat). The documentary about religions around the world went on to become the eighth highest-grossing documentary ever.\n\nAdding to this New Year’s extravaganza are Sarah Silverman and Larry Miller. Silverman is a two-time Emmy Award winner and one of the most versatile talents in entertainment. She is perhaps best known as creator, executive producer, and host of the Emmy-nominated weekly topical talk series I Love You, America, which streamed on Hulu. The series earned nominations at the Emmy Awards and Writers Guild Awards. In May 2017, she released her latest standup special A Speck of Dust on Netflix, which culminated in two Emmy Award nominations and a Grammy Award nomination.\n\nActor, comedian and author Larry Miller is one of Hollywood’s most recognizable faces. He has appeared in over 100 film and television shows, beginning his career with a memorable scene alongside Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in the blockbuster film, Pretty Woman. He has since gone on to unforgettable roles in such films as The Princess Diaries, The Nutty Professor, Bee Movie and 10 Things I Hate About You.\n\nFans can expect the unexpected when it comes to Maher’s New Year’s extravaganza. In 2013, Academy Award-winner actor Sean Penn and director Michael Moore made a surprise appearance to introduce Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder, who wowed the crowd with a surprise acoustic set. In 2015, David Spade and Jeff Ross added to the hysteria, and were followed up by Margaret Cho and Dana Gould in 2016 and finally by Bob Saget and Reggie Brown in 2017. Last year, Bill’s Hawaii shows with Natasha Leggero and Carol Leifer were joined by a host of surprise celebrity guests including Woody Harrelson, Paul Simon, Eddie Vedder, Bonnie Hunt and Sean Penn. No matter what happens, one thing is for certain: This show is the place to be as the world welcomes in 2020.\n\n“I think everybody wants to be in Hawaii in December,” Maher said. “That was my plan all year; get my ass booked there for New Year’s!”\n\nGeneral Ticket Information\n\nTickets for Bill Maher, December 30 at 8:00 P.M. in the Castle Theater at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center are $99.50 and $79.50 plus service fees.
