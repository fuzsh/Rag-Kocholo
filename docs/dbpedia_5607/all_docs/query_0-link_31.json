        "text": "— Larry Miller has been told many times that he has a positive attitude, but notes he “wouldn’t know any other way to live.”\n\nThe comedian - who has appeared in multiple films, among them “Pretty Woman,” “10 Things I Hate About You,” “The Princess Diaries,” “Waiting for Guffman,” “Best in Show,” “For Your Consideration” and “A Mighty Wind” - will be showcasing this outlook and his sense of humor in a one-man show called “Holiday Cocktails With Larry Miller” tonight at the Walton Arts Center.\n\nMiller loves show business and being an actor, writer and comic, he says.\n\nWhile recently on set shooting an episode for the upcoming television show “Bent,” co-star Jeffrey Tambor asked him about his one-man show, and the comic said he was going to Fayetteville to perform it at the Walton Arts Center.\n\n“I said to him, ‘I’m going to be as happy on that stage with those folks as I am on this stage with you right now,’” he says.\n\nHis love for comedy and performing began in his childhood. He listened to comedy albums by Bill Cosby, Bob Newhart and Robert Klein and started performing routines from those albums for his family while at the dinner table. He says his mom had a pretty sharp wit, and his dad loved to tell jokes.\n\nMiller writes comedy about experiences common to everyone, such as celebrating Thanksgiving or dating. His show is about how “life is the cocktail.” He says one of his favorite lines from it is about marriage, children and drinking and how one of them always leads to the other two.\n\nMiller will also be playing piano in his holiday-themed show. He was a music major in school and made a living as a drummer and piano player for a couple of years before getting into stand-up comedy. He plans to play original songs, a couple of parodies and holiday music, some of which will include his original lyrics.\n\nMiller says a one-man show is different than standup comedy. It is more like storytelling, but there are elements of standup in it. In the show, he will be talking about the period between Thanksgiving through the new year.\n\nAt the recent premiere of his newest movie, “New Year’s Eve,” he was asked what he wants for the new year. He says the concept of making resolutions is wonderful and even the crabbiest people get a little reflective and introspective.\n\n“I think probably even assassins think, ‘How can I be a better murderer?’” Miller says.\n\nMiller says the holiday season is a wonderful time but notes that every single moment in life can be inspiration for comedic material. One example he gave is sitting in a row of cars waiting to pick up a child at school and seeing other parents cut in line. He says that’s not right, and most everyone knows that feeling.\n\n“My way of underlining that is to make it funny,” he says."
