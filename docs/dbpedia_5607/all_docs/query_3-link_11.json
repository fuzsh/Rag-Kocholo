Miller Company is excited to announce David Smart as the newest member of our board of directors. Smart is the executive vice president, CFO and CIO of Milliken & Company, a leading global manufacturing company specializing in flooring, textiles, chemicals and healthcare solutions since 1865. He also spent 20 years with Ford Motor Company in various senior leadership roles. Smart earned his MBA from the University of Michigan and holds a bachelor’s degree in finance, business economics and public policy from Indiana University. “We are pleased to welcome David Smart to our board of directors. His board experience, public and private company insights, and perspectives operating family-owned businesses will contribute greatly as the Larry H. Miller Company continues to grow,” said Steve Miller, board chair of the LHM Company. https://lnkd.in/eshTSJfE\n\nEvery year, the Larry H. Miller Company welcomes a new cohort of interns for a summer of hard work, networking, hands-on experience, and, hopefully, a bit of fun. At their graduation ceremony, each intern presented their learnings, accomplishments and experiences from the last four months to their mentors and company leadership. We ended the ceremony with words from various members of our executive team, who shared advice as our interns prepare to enter the workforce, complete their collegiate studies, and begin their next adventure. “The Larry H. Miller Company is excited you have shared your talents with us. As you build your resumes and gain new skills, we hope that you’ll reflect on your experiences here. As interns and young professionals, you have an opportunity to determine what matters most in terms of workplace culture, an organization’s mission and values, and the coworkers who may lift and motivate you. Our mission is to enrich lives, and we encourage you to continue to do so along your journey.” - Steve Starks, CEO We thank them for their hard work this summer, and we wish them luck with their future endeavors. They leave today as teammates we’re excited to partner with as we work to make the places Where Life Takes Place.\n\nThe Larry H. & Gail Miller Family Foundation donated $1 million to the Ogden-Weber Technical College (OTECH) Foundation to support the construction of its new Pathway Building. OTECH President James Taggart said, “The Miller Family Foundation is one of the most influential forces for good in Utah, and we are so grateful for their partnership with Ogden-Weber Tech. This investment will help generations of OTECH students access educational opportunities and build high-wage, high-demand careers in our community.” We are excited to be a part of this project and look forward to the incredible outcomes it will foster. The Pathway Building will create a space where education and opportunity meet to create an environment where students can thrive. “Ogden-Weber Technical College is helping solve significant needs for our economy by providing experiential education and ensuring students are ready to enter the job market,” said Steve Starks, CEO of the Larry H. Miller Company. “We value innovation and know this center will contribute positively to communities across the state and enrich lives.” These renderings are conceptual.\n\nThe Salt Lake Bees (formerly the Salt Lake Buzz) arrived in Salt Lake City in 1994 and have been a staple of our community since. The uniforms may look different, the mascot may have a new look and Daybreak Field is on the way, but one thing that will never change is our mission to enrich lives by making the places Where Life Takes Place. We’ve served millions of fans, seen incredible home runs and had a great time living life at the ballpark. We can’t wait to see what happens next for our favorite MiLB team. #lhm #saltlakebees #WhereLifeTakesPlace\n\nCalling all baseball fans! Miller Sports + Entertainment is bringing Béisbol en Salt Lake to Smith’s Ballpark this fall. On Oct. 5-6, Béisbol en Salt Lake will host two top teams in La Liga ARCO Mexicana del Pacífico for a two-day baseball series and activities for the community. The event, taking place during Hispanic Heritage Month, will be a rich celebration of baseball and Utah’s Hispanic and Latino communities. “The Larry H. Miller Company and Miller Sports + Entertainment are committed to supporting baseball at all levels,” said Ty Wardle, EVP of Miller Sports + Entertainment. “Béisbol en Salt Lake is another piece of that puzzle, and it’s going to be so much more than two days of baseball.” Weekend festivities include live music, vendors, food and a postgame drone show on Saturday, and an early afternoon game and on-field concert on Sunday. We believe in the power of sports and baseball to enrich communities, and we’d like to thank our community and government partners who will help this event come to life. Our partnerships allow us to continue making the places where life takes place. “Sports are powerful tools that bring people together,” said Utah State Senator Luz Escamilla. “It’s a great honor to be part of this legacy event that we’re leaving behind to our children and community.” For more information and to purchase tickets, visit www.beisbolsaltlake.com. We can’t wait to see everyone at the ballpark!"
