        "text": "Probe deeply enough, and the average stand-up comic - off-stage - often turns out to be a sad or even miserable person who's fuelled by deep reservoirs of anger and self-loathing.\n\nThat would not describe Larry Miller, the stand-up comedian turned versatile actor turned writer turned (quite recently) stand-up comedian again.\n\nNow in his mid-50s, Miller projects an almost unnatural aura of well-being. He has a childlike sense of wonder and appreciation for the life he has been allowed to lead, as expressed at length in his 2006 book, Spoiled Rotten America, a collection of essays at once comic and insightful.\n\nAfter two decades in Hollywood writing, producing and appearing in some 50 films ( Get Smart, Waiting for Guffman, The Nutty Professor and, most famously, Pretty Woman, as the fawning sales clerk) and in TV's Seinfeld (as the smiling but malevolent apartment doorman), he's been back on the road again for several months, reconnecting with his comedic roots.\n\nMiller made several appearances at the Montreal Just for Laughs festival last week, and tonight he'll be joining an impressive lineup of comedians at back-to-back Toronto galas hosted by Saturday Night Live alumnus Jimmy Fallon.\n\nDespite his good-natured disposition, it's not as if, like every performer, Miller isn't stricken on occasion with crippling self-doubt. But he deals with it.\n\n\"I go through the same black periods everyone else does,\" he said, looking out the window at a summer afternoon in Montreal last week. \"Anywhere from seven to 57 times a day, I sit in my hotel room wondering, 'What am I doing here? I have nothing to say.' But I have a path, a method I use to stop that. I'm not a floating yogi.\"\n\nMiller says he can't really describe his brand of comedy. \"I love words, the colour and texture of words, and word pictures. I love trying to find the right phrase and I love broad physical bits that go right back to vaudeville. I think it's storytelling. But so is everything - a painting, a piece of music, a Rodney Dangerfield or Steven Wright joke. I love storytelling that has a true moment that moves you or makes you stop.\"\n\nMiller came to comedy almost accidentally. The Long Island, N.Y., native He'd studied music in college (he plays the drums, among other instruments), considered law school and, not really sure about his future after graduation, took a job with Amtrak as a reservations agent in New York. One night in 1977, he went to a comedy club that had just opened. The first comedian he saw was a young Jerry Seinfeld. \"And I thought, 'This is good. I like this.' \" He started performing soon after.\n\nProbably his scariest moment in standup came the night he wrote and delivered his first original joke, to a high-school prom audience in rural New Jersey. The joke played with the notion that, however important we become in life, our teachers were, are and will forever be addressed with formality, as Miss This or Mr. That. So in the joke that opened his act, Miller had a student who became Secretary of State say, \"Hey, Mr. Cooper, remember when we set you on fire?\"\n\n\"Now, not only was there no laughter,\" recalls Miller, \"but there was this palpable wave of hate, visible, like heat coming off a radiator in the winter. I shook it off and limped through another 19 minutes of something. And what happened was that, apparently the week before, a beloved, Mr. Chips-like teacher at the same school, named Mr. Cooper, had died in a terrible fire.\n\n\"How could I know that? The odds are incalculable. So we had to beat it to the parking lot and our '66 Nova while this throng pursued us, like villagers in a Frankenstein movie with torches.\"\n\nMiller says he \"knew instinctively I wanted to live a creative life. But I don't think I ever struggled, because I never saw it that way.\" Between gigs, he played drums in a club band for $125 a night, and later became a part-time bartender, although he had no idea how to mix drinks. \"Everything,\" he said, \"became a Budweiser.\"\n\nLater, after years on the circuit, he was runner-up to Jason Alexander for the George Costanza role on Seinfeld.\n\n\"Anything that you don't get is disappointing,\" allows Miller.\n\n\"A series. A movie part. But it's still of a piece with me. I just love that I'm here now and alive. Would I have been a better comic, writer, actor, husband, father [he and his wife, writer Eileen Conn, have two young sons] The answer is no. Will I continue to put bricks in the wall or 10 rows of bricks in the wall? Well, I guess we'll find out. Because you can either dive out the window and lose every game you've been asked to play, or say, 'You know what? I will go on.' And enjoy the moments.\"\n\nSeinfeld, he says, was a comedic equivalent of a gimme. \"The writing was so good that all you had to do - Spencer Tracy said this - was just say the words and don't bump into the furniture. And Jerry said to me the first or second day, because I was trying to add all sorts of stuff, and he said, 'No, just stand there. It's already funny.' \" The two remain close friends.\n\nNow developing an animation series with Sony Pictures executive Russ Krasnoff, Miller and his wife are devoted facilitators of their sons' Little League baseball careers. \"It's like hockey in Canada,\" he said. \"The coaches and the parents are out of their minds. Anyone who thinks there's even the smallest chance of peace in the Middle East has never been involved in Little League.\n\n\"It's unfair to make people who have been enemies for thousands of years link arms like Bavarians at Oktoberfest when all across America, doctors and lawyers and accountants - otherwise nominally sane people who live in the same block - will stab each other over whose kid is next in the batting cage.\"\n\nFor himself, Miller says he just wants to entertain: \"There's great honour in that word. A poem, Henry IV, Gainsborough's Blue Boy - that's entertainment. It doesn't have to be frivolous. When the lights go down, I want everybody in the audience to be like a nine-year-old kid in a striped shirt.\"\n\nLarry Miller is one of a number of performers at tonight's Just for Laughs galas at Massey Hall in Toronto, at 7 and 9:30\n\n(hahaha.com).\n\n*****\n\nShort steals the show\n\nIt was a strong opening night for Just for Laugh's second summer season in Toronto. The first of six galas at Massey Hall, Thursday night's early show was anchored by a killer hosting performance from that indefatigable charmer, Hamilton native Martin Short. His act came complete with a couple of clever songs, a 12-minute improv routine between Short's brilliant, doughnut-munching, celebrity-pricking, inflated alter ego, Jiminy Glick and former CFL great Damon Allen (a gracious and serviceable straight man), as well as a cameo sketch employing Short's SCTV incarnation, Ed Grimley.\n\nAustralia's likeable Adam Hills warmed things up nicely. Toronto's Doo Wops sang well and they write fine music, although their songs are essentially one-joke wonders, repetitive after the first verse. Shaun Majumder's raw material is only so-so, but his delivery is so polished and his acting so smooth that you almost fail to notice. American Elon Gold scored with bits about Jewish stereotypes and double entendres about George W. Bush and the first name of his then-running mate. And the enduring Andr√©-Phillipe Gagnon - like Short, a national treasure - breezed through a series of uncanny vocal impersonations that included Robert Goulet, the Oak Ridge Boys, the Platters, Phil Collins, Elvis Presley and a wailing tenor sax. But in the end, it was Short's evening to steal, and he did not disappoint.\n\nMichael Posner"
