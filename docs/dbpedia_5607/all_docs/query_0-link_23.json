        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the host of the Laugh Track column, a real thrill seeker ... Mike McIntyre. Thank you, Cleveland. It's tough to find extreme sports here. We don't exactly have mountains or towering waves. Still, if you're creative, you can get your thrill on. Here's what I do: Pick up the entire bowling team, spend an hour gorging at the Ponderosa buffet, and then drive slowly across the Inner Belt Bridge as it groans beneath the weight.\n\nMy heart is still pounding, but that might just be from the T-bone.\n\nIt's Miller time\n\nLarry Miller, who got his start at the Comic Strip in New York in the 1970s, left stand-up comedy for years to concentrate on writing and acting (he had roles in \"Pretty Woman,\" \"The Nutty Professor\" and \"Boston Legal\" to name a few.) He was brilliant at it, but now that he's back on stage, he wonders how he ever lived without stand-up.\n\n\"Over the last five years, each time I began to write, I said to myself, 'Gee, these words feel like they could be spoken out loud. To people. By someone,' \" said Miller, who will be in Cleveland Thursday-Sunday for a gig at Hilarities 4th Street Theatre. \"Last February, I said, 'You know what, I want to be a comic again. Now, I am never going to stop.' \"\n\nBut how to fit it in along with writing, acting and regular stints on Los Angeles radio?\n\n\"Oh what a joy it is to know the day is full,\" said Miller. \"Come on, we're not tarring roofs here.\"\n\nMiller expounds on topics that interest him. He doesn't need a rim shot.\n\n\"I love Steven Wright and Dangerfield and all of the great line comics. Me, I like to talk. I am in the storytelling business. I explore a topic anywhere from one minute to 10 minutes,\" he said. \"There's so much out there, it's just an endless supply, an infinite horizon.\"\n\nJust then he'd been jotting notes about the street cleaner that he'd seen rumble by and how its design hadn't changed in years. \"And another thing that hasn't changed: I don't think one of them has ever actually picked up anything.\"\n\nMiller, who can deliver edgy and dark material, is careful to never polarize the audience with topics like race or politics.\n\n\"As soon as the lights go down, it's important to me that everyone in the room feels exactly the same. They're all 9 years old with a striped shirt on,\" he said. \"The topics are what I hope everybody sees, feels and understands. Just being a comic in your time; it's a great honor.\"\n\nMiller performs at 8 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 20 ($20), 7:30 and 10:15 p.m. Friday ($23) and Saturday, Nov. 21 and 22 ($25), at Hilarities 4th Street Theatre inside Pickwick & Frolic, 2035 E. Fourth St., Cleveland. call 216-736-4242.\n\nAlso playing\n\nLarry Reeb headlines the Improv inside the Powerhouse, 2000 Sycamore St. on the west bank of Cleveland's Flats with shows Wednesday through Sunday (two on Friday and Saturday). Call 216-696-4677.\n\nFormer professional tennis player Mike Kosta headlines Bogey's Comedy Club, 28060 Chardon Road, Willoughby Hills Thursday through Saturday (two shows Friday and Saturday). Call 440-944-9000.\n\nThat's my time. Please don't forget to tip your carrier."
