        "text": "Nick Hoff is a nationally touring stand-up comedian who has been on MTV, Dry Bar Comedy, co-hosts a weekly show on SiriusXM, and was a featured act in Netflix's Comedy Festival. His debut album \"Baby Daddy\" hit #1 on the iTunes comedy charts, and his new hour-long special \"Front to Back\" can be streamed on YouTube. When he's not on stage, Nick can often be seen in commercials for Miller Lite, Pepsi and Amazon.\n\nJeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy hand-picked Nick to open for them on their International \"We've Been Thinking Tour.\" He has headlined the \"Pink Ribbon Comedy Tour\" which made stops in 40 cities doing 65 shows all raising money for breast cancer research. He was also part of the \"Walk of Shame\" national comedy tour, which was not quite so noble a cause.\n\nCheck out Nick live when he comes to a city near you, and listen to his weekly podcast \"Hoffcast\" where he trades stories with comedians, friends, and one astronaut (so far).\n\nThis show is 21+\n\nTwo drink/item minimum per person\n\nCheck in at least 15 minutes before show\n\nVince is fast-talking, frenetic, and frustrated. He has a quick-witted, fast-paced style that envelops you with an avalanche of punchlines that never stop. He is chaotic, cathartic, and a complainer. But the deeper he delves into his show the more you relate to him, root for him, and feel his pain just as he relives it, night after night. That’s Vince’s greatest gift, his ability to instantly connect with the everyman (and every woman). He sees the absurdities of the world and he rallies against them. Vince says the things on stage you would only dare to speak in a mumbling, hushed tone when no one else was within earshot.\n\nVince has been seen on Tubi, TBS and heard on Chicago’s Mancow in the Morning radio show, and WGN Radio. His most recent of his 6-specials “Bad Father” has been met with strong reviews.\n\nHe was the winner of the 2019 “Best of the Midwest” Competition at Gilda’s Laughfest and headlines the MGM in Las Vegas. Vince’s show is filled with genuine, heartfelt laughs. He’s fast, he’s furious and he is funny. It’s not just a wild ride. It’s a journey. It’s a whirlwind of ranting, raving, and refreshing material.
