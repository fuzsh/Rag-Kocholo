        "text": "I love a good pop in! üòÇ Reddit, Inc. is the greatest! I really am so blessed to end up working at the The H3 Show ! I get to do sales, which I‚Äôm great at, and help the show grow their sponsorships. And I still get to sit the studio once in a while to hang out and have fun. And make people laugh. Whats better than that?! Yesterday, I went to the studio and sat in for the show and then had my weekly sales meeting. And then I went home and worked my ass off at home until late, trying to grow their sponsors. And it was all an absolute pleasure! Beyond grateful for Ethan and Hila, the show and most importantly the H3 community. Just an amazing, funny, smart, talented and supportive group of people! They even have their own networking group here on LinkedIn https://lnkd.in/gduxbuZY Oh, and if you‚Äôd like to sponsor the show, shoot me an email. We have some availability in the next month. Tom@h3h3productions Peace and love! Peace and love. ‚úåÔ∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nOne year ago I had back surgery. After years of running, boxing, lifting weights, etc. my back had enough. They said recovery is pretty easy. They replace the bad disc and you're walking the same day. And pretty soon you're back to normal. Well that wasn't the case for me at all. They aggravated a nerve, so I had a new pain in my upper glute. It would start hurting after any prolonged movement Physical therapy was excruciating. But I worked out my entire life and I was going to get back to the boxing gym. That was my goal. Not even to spar or anything. Just to be able to go there and hit the bags, hit mitts, etc. I haven't made it back to the boxing gym yet but I'm close. It's all about getting a little bit better than the day before. One of my favorite words of all time is \"Kaizen.\" It's a Japanese word that means continuous improvement. I even have it tattooed on my arm. So, that's my goal every time I'm in the gym. Just do one more rep, one more round, add 1 lb to the weights, etc. And that's the key to anything. Those little, seemingly insignificant wins pay off big time in the long run.\n\nI shouted out my LinkedIn profile on the H3H3 podcast and here‚Äôs what happened. After a couple of years focusing on my podcast full time, I wanted to get back into sales and I‚Äôve got to say‚Ä¶Looking for a job has been a pretty daunting process. I just started my search and it seems like every single job I‚Äôve even looked at, literally has hundreds of applicants withing hours after posting. How am I going to break through all that noise? I didn‚Äôt go to Harvard. I didn‚Äôt work for a sexy startup. I was doing a comedy segment for the H3H3 podcast last week and before I went on, I thought about what I wanted to promote. Usually, when you go on a big show like that, your goal is to get people to follow your podcast or to follow you on social, etc. There were 40,000 people were watching me live when I went on. That's a lot of eyeballs. So, I thought, what if I told them I was looking for a sales role for and shouted out my LinkedIn when I went on? I did it and the response was nuts! I got 500 new followers, great leads, great connections and just great engagement with professional people who were watching. Now, how does this help you? You‚Äôre not getting invited to appear on podcasts, so who cares. The point is that a lot of the people who were watching my silly video were actually successful professionals who wanted to connect and possibly work together. So, drop your LinkedIn contact in a social setting that you might not have considered it before. Who knows where it will get you. It's a party on LinkedIn these days! Cayman Rojas knows!"
