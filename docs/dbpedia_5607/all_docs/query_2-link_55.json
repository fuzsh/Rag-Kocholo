        "text": "Our lives now depend on staying home and doing nothing.\n\nWe are cooped up with no end in sight, getting increasingly irascible.\n\nSo I thought I would reach out to the world’s leading expert on the art of nothing: the endlessly irascible man whose mantra has always been: “It doesn’t pay to leave your house — what’s the point?”\n\nI found Larry David barricaded in his home in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles. “No one gets in here,” America’s most famous misanthrope said. “Only in an emergency plumbing catastrophe would I open the door.”\n\nI asked what he fears most and he replied: “Anarchy and a potential dental emergency — and not necessarily in that order.”\n\nLong ago, when he was a miserable stand-up comic in New York, he would sometimes abruptly stop his act, telling the audience, “This is what happens when you run out of nothing.” Then he made two of the best shows in TV history, “Seinfeld” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” about … nothing.\n\nAnd now, in this plague season, Mr. David’s odes to trivial pursuits are providing relief to some of us who are nostalgic for the days when we had the bandwidth to focus on trivia, when our lives weren’t blighted and freighted.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
