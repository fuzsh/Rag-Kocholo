        "text": "Actor and comedian , who starred in HBO's hit show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" has died. He was 76 years old.\n\nLewis, who revealed he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in April, passed away at his home in Los Angeles on Tuesday night after suffering a heart attack, according to his publicist Jeff Abraham.\n\nLewis portrayed himself alongside Larry David on Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nRichard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life he’s been like a brother to me,\" David said in a statement. \"He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest. But today he made me sob and for that I’ll never forgive him.”\n\nHBO released the following statement in reaction to Lewis' death:\n\nWe are heartbroken to learn that Richard Lewis has passed away. His comedic brilliance, wit and talent were unmatched. Richard will always be a cherished member of the HBO and 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' families, our heartfelt condolences go out to his family, friends and all the fans who could count on Richard to brighten their days with laughter.”\n\nFellow stars, including Albert Brooks and Biz Markie, took to social media about Lewis' passing.\n\nRIP Richard Lewis. A brilliantly funny man who will missed by all,\" Brooks wrote on X. \"The world needed him now more than ever.\"\n\nMarkie shared similar sentiments, praising Lewis' comedic genius.\n\nRIP Richard Lewis, who could turn a mundane complaint into high art, whose neurosis was its own form of novella, who could turn a passing kvetch into a zen koan, whose third act on \"Curb\" made it into one of the greatest ever, and whose hair volume was enviably unparalleled,\" Markie wrote.\n\nLewis' wife, Joyce, thanked everyone for their \"loving tributes\" and said he \"would be beyond thrilled and so touched, as am I.\"\n\n\"In response to the many queries, I know Richard would appreciate donations in his memory to the Los Angeles based charity ( ) or the charity of your choice,\" she noted on her husband's X account.\n\nLewis, who rose to fame in the mid-1970s as a stand-up comedian, was a regular performer in clubs and on late-night TV for decades.\n\nComedy Central named Lewis one of the top 50 stand-up comedians of all time and he earned a berth in GQ magazine’s list of the “20th Century’s Most Influential Humorists.” He lent his humor for charity causes, including Comic Relief and Comedy Gives Back.\n\nAside from Curb Your Enthusiasm, he also played Marty Gold, the romantic co-lead opposite Jamie Lee Curtis, in the ABC series “Anything But Love” and the reliably neurotic Prince John in “Mel Brooks’ Robin Hood: Men In Tights.\n\nDuring his career, Lewis was open about his struggle with drugs and alcohol. He often spoke of his recovery, as well as bouts with depression and anxiety, in his comedy routines.\n\n_____"
