        "text": "From ANDRAS JONES: The great LARRY MILLER joined our Pop Oracle session at Starburns Industries with OPIUM MOON. Larry was good friends with LILI HAYDN‘s mom, LOTUS WEINSTOCK. This is the beginning of 3 Pop Oracle sessions with comedians who were a big part of the stand-up comedy explosion of the early 90’s. In this episode Larry talks about moving out to LA and sleeping on “Jerry’s couch”. Jerry Seinfeld that is. Tomorrow’s session features LUCY WEBB, and the following day we have comedian RICK OVERTON who many will remember from the great doomed series “I’m Dying Up Here” that featured a character played by Ari Graynor who bears some striking similarities to Lotus Weinstock. It feels appropriate that we wrapped up this chapter of our association with Starburns by featuring a previous generation’s comic all-stars.\n\nI’m not sure if you’ll think it’s funny but I do (in a sad way). A day or two after this session was recorded it was suggested in an e-mail from Starburns Audio that one of these comic old timers “tried to break in” to the Starburns lounge. I’m sure Dino Stamatopoulos would have been happy to share his vodka with Larry Miller but I can assure you Mr. Miller wasn’t in the mood for a smash and grab theft of Starburns’ booze. This is the nature of the micro-aggressive treatment we experienced at Starburns Industries in our final months with Starburns Audio. When an elder statesman comedian accidentally trying to open the wrong door is escalated to the level of criminal trespass, and attending a Mormon and The Meth Head show is considered “harassment”, it’s a sign that someone has lost their sense of humor (and decency)."
