She is a broadly trained Classical archaeologist with research interests in Bronze Age Greece and landscape history. Her current projects include a reexamination of the Main Building of the Palace of Nestor in southwestern Greece and the Kea Archaeological Research Survey where she serves as the study tour and field school manager. She is particularly interested in Mycenaean palatial architecture, the impact of shifting socioeconomic systems on regional landscape histories, and methodologies for interpreting archaeological survey data."
