Maroon stamped cloth, gilt letters on spine, dark turquoise & illus. dust jacket, 453 pp., many BW and color illus., maps, one fold-out. As New. Item #155977\n\n\"Publishes 713 vessels and objects that document the history of early glassmaking from its beginnings in the Bronze Age to the rise of the formidable Roman glass industry of Augustan and Julio-Claudian times. ... The volume accomplishes two primary goals. The first is to publish comprehensively the early ancient glass found in Toledo's collection in a thorough manner, with complete descriptions of form, color, decoration, mosaic patterns, and techniques. ... The second goal is to place the Toledo collection of pre-blown ancient glass within the framework of the history of glassmaking from the Bronze Age to the advent of the Christian era.\" (dj)."
