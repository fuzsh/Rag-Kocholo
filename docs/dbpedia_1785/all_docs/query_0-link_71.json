For instances beyond Fair Use, it is the responsibility of the researcher to determine whether any permissions related to copyright, privacy, publicity, or any other rights are necessary for their intended use of the Library's materials, and to obtain all required permissions from any existing rights holders, if they have not already done so. Princeton University Library's Special Collections does not charge any permission or use fees for the publication of images of materials from our collections, nor does it require researchers to obtain its permission for said use. The department does request that its collections be properly cited and images credited. More detailed information can be found on the Copyright, Credit and Citations Guidelines page on our website.

Users may visually inspect physical media but may not remove it from its enclosure. All analog audiovisual media must be digitized to preservation-quality standards prior to use. Audiovisual digitization requests are processed by an approved third-party vendor.

Finding aid written by Peggy Kidwell in 1979 .\n\nAcknowledgments: The arrangement of the Henry Norris Russell Papers have been a joint project of the Princeton University Library and the Center for History of Physics, American Institute of Physics. Jean Preston, Curator of Manuscripts at Princeton, has provided patient, intelligent and cheerful supervision, for which I am most grateful. David DeVorkin has generously shared his own knowledge of Russell's life and work. I thank him and his colleagues at the Center for History of Physics for their encouragement and practical suggestions. I also am indebted to Charlotte Moore Sitterly, not only for her bibliography of Russell's publications but for generous answers to my inquiries. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the hospitality of the staff of Mudd Manuscripts Library. Finally, John O'Rourke deserves thanks for his help in arranging the papers, and so does Eve Thompson for typing this guide.\n\nThis collection was processed by Peggy Kidwell with the assistance of John O'Rourke and Eve Thompson in 1979.
