        "text": "Peter Grose, one of the last of a generation of foreign correspondents who cut their teeth covering the Vietnam War — an experience that he drew on later for assignments in Moscow and Jerusalem, and later still as the author of several well-received books about American history, died on Dec. 31 in Minneapolis. He was 88.\n\nHis daughter Kim Grose Moore said the cause of death, at an assisted-living home, was complications of a stroke.\n\nMr. Grose was the archetypal foreign correspondent: cosmopolitan, educated, able to write with sweep about world events or to zero in on the telling detail. He served in Paris, Saigon (today Ho Chi Minh City), Moscow and Washington, and was later the executive editor of Foreign Affairs, the august flagship journal of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n“He was quiet, calm and judicious, very much in the old-fashioned New York Times style,” Max Frankel, a former Times executive editor, said in a phone interview."
