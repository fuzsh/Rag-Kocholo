I soon began to show little watercolors in his gallery and others around the Cape and somehow after a few years of selling hundreds of paintings in the summers on Cape Cod, I got the idea that I could keep on doing this cool thing.\"\n\nThese latest small editions of color reduction woodcut prints were all done in the year of 2017, except for Salt Marsh, which I made in the fall of 2019. They are printed mostly on Japanese papers using oil-based etching inks and a silver spoon with lots of elbow grease!\""
