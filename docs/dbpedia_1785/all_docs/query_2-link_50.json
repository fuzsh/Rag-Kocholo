        "text": "Obituary For Jean Grose Bullard\n\nIda Jean Grose-Bullard (nee Harel), age 93, of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, passed away peacefully on March 14, 2024 in her home. Born in Ontario, Canada on September 22, 1930 to Charles and Evelyn (Miller) Harel. Jean married Gerald H. Grose in 1952 in Manitoba with whom she had four children. As a family they relocated to four provinces and more than 26 states.\n\nAfter Jean and Gerry divorced, she returned to school. Having only an 8th grade education, and determined to succeed, not only did she graduate from the Murray State University in Kentucky with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work in 1983, but she followed with a Licensed Masters in Social Work from Highlands University, in Las Vegas in 1988.\n\nIn 1986, Jean moved to Truth or Consequences, NM, and settled in town working at the New Mexico Veterans Center as Director of Human Services. She enjoyed playing bridge and being a Goren Bridge Instructor. Jean met Richard \"Dick\" Bullard at a Bridge game, and they married June 1992. She discovered her love of travel and cruise ships on her honeymoon. They split their time between T or C and his home of Maxwell, Iowa. In 1993, Jean began her private practice as a counselor treating Vietnam Vets for the VA at her office next to her home in T or C.\n\nJean had a special appreciation for the power of education and worked with GED students and sponsored College and University scholarships for Indigenous Veteran students both in the US and Canada. Her work with Veterans was extensive and included acquiring resources for local families, especially those of Vietnam Veterans, and reestablishing the WWI Geronimo outpost group. She donated her son's, Sgt. Michael G Grose, uniform and memorabilia to the Veteran's Memorial Park and Hamilton Military Museum here in Truth or Consequences. Her passionate support of Indigenous Veterans came from her family history of military service and her Red River MÃ©tis heritage.\n\nJean was very involved in her community and was a member of the 1st United Methodist Church, Eastern Star, R.S.V.P., D.A.V.A., American Legion, V.F.W. Aux., and the Hot Springs Group Senior Center for over 20 years.\n\nJean is preceded by husband Richard Bullard; former husband Gerald H. Grose; son Sgt. Michael G. Grose; daughter, Lynn K. Grose; son, James M. Grose (Peggy); son, David T. Grose (Lois), brother, Charles Harel; and sister, Edith Harel.\n\nShe is survived by her grandchildren Jessica L. Kiser of Seattle, WA; Renee L. Jewell of Wilmington, DE; Jason M. Grose (Ashley) of Claymont, DE; Rachael Anya Roy (Daryl) of Smyrna, DE; James R. Grose (Yassmine) of Dover, DE; Sara Collins (Travis) of Duluth, MN; sisters Lorraine Shannon, Joyce Terranova, Rechenda Munroe Constantineau and Jip Monroe all in Canada; as well as nieces and nephews, and great grandchildren in Canada and USA.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held at Kirikos Funeral Home on Saturday, June 1, 2024 at 10:00 A.M. followed by a Graveside Service at Vista Memory Gardens Cemetery.\n\nThe Services will be livestreamed using the link below.\n\nSend flowers to the service of Jean Grose Bullard\n\nLive Stream Links\n\nLivestream"
