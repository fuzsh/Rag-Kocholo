        "text": "Grose History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nGermany\n\nThe name Grose comes from the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. It was a name for a person who because of their physical characteristics was referred to as the gross man or the heavy man. At times, it was a personal name and variant of Grace. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Grose family\n\nThe surname Grose was first found in Cornwall where the first record of the family was found in \"Trescobays, or Triscobays, [which] was formerly inherited by the family of Grosse; after which it was purchased by Sir Peter Killigrew, together with the barton of Howard as a parcel of Tregangy.\" 2\n\n\"During [the reign of Elizabeth] four-fifths [of the manor of Rosmoddris] was granted to St. George Carye, and sold by him to Ezekiel Grosse, Esq. whose family had an ancient seat at Triclodevas in this parish.\" 2\n\n\"Leah or Leigh, [in the parish of St. Buryan, Cornwall] now occupied by a farmer, was anciently a seat of the Grosse family, and afterwards of the Usticks.\" 2\n\nNot withstanding the Cornish origin of the name, some of the family may have originated elsewhere. By example, Willelmus filius grosse was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 in Suffolk. The same source also lists Willelmus Grossus in Norfolk. 3\n\nLater in Yorkshire, Geraldus filius Grossi was listed there in the Pipe Rolls of 1176. Adam le Gros was listed at Holme in Norfolk 1186-1210 and Wiliam le Groos was listed in the Feet of Fines for Essex in 1314. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Grose family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Grose research.

The name Grose has undergone many spelling variations, including Gross, Grosse, Grose and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Grose family\n\nNotables of the family at this time include Alexander Grosse (1596?-1654), English Presbyterian divine, born about 1596, the son of William Grosse, husbandman of Christow, Devonshire. \"After attending Exeter school for five years, he was admitted sizar of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 26 July 1618, and proceeded M.A. (College Admission Register, ed.
