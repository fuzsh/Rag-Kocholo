        "text": "Welcome to the Children’s Church ministry at Bethel Christian Church. Our goal is to provide your children with a joyful, safe, and loving atmosphere where they can learn about God and Jesus. We have volunteers who will provide a Bible based lesson, snack, and supervised play. We encourage all children ages 5 through 2 nd grade to attend. We want our children to be involved in our church service, so they will be in church when service starts and will be dismissed for Children’s Church after special music. Brother Bill will give them dismissal instructions and there will be Children’s Church volunteers waiting to escort the children to the yellow house for their lesson. Pick up will be at the yellow house after church dismisses.\n\nPlease follow the sick policy that is posted at the yellow house. If you are interested in volunteering in Children’s Church or for further information, please contact Jaime Lunsford at (859) 475-4112 or email cchurch@bchristianchurch.com"
