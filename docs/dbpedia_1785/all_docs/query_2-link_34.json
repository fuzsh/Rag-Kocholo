        "text": "Jessica Grose\n\nI’m an Opinion writer for The New York Times.\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nI cover family, religion, education and culture. I am particularly interested in finding fresh angles on major social changes, like why Americans are moving away from organized religion, and why the birthrate has fallen around the world. I love doing surveys, and I find that hearing from Times readers about the issues that are dear to their hearts is one of my favorite parts of the job.\n\nMy Background\n\nI have been covering family, policy and pop culture at many publications including Slate, New York Magazine and Jezebel since I graduated from Brown University in 2004. I joined the Times as the editor of their parenting product in 2018, and I moved to the Opinion section in 2021.\n\nI am also the author of “Screaming on The Inside: The Unsustainability of American Motherhood,” and two novels “Soulmates” and “Sad Desk Salad.” I was the founding editor of Lenny, the email newsletter and website. I was named a Glamour “Game Changer” in 2020 for my coverage of parenting during the pandemic.\n\nI grew up in Irvington, N.Y., and I remember nerding out over Entertainment Weekly, Sassy, Mirabella and other magazines in their ’90s heyday — I would be so excited to check the mailbox. I started writing for my high school newspaper, and I eventually became the editor. In college, I was an arts editor at The Indy, Brown’s independent weekly. I thought I would be a rock critic (my first job out of undergrad was at Spin) but I realized pretty quickly that I wanted to widen my lens to many more subjects.\n\nI live with my husband and two kids in Brooklyn.\n\nJournalistic Ethics\n\nAs a Times journalist I am committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook. Though I am an opinion writer, my stories are always reported and rigorously fact-checked (our department’s fact checkers are top tier, I trust them with my life)."
