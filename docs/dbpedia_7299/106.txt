Name

Shamus Culhane

James "Shamus" Culhane (November 12, 1908 â€“ February 2, 1996) was an American animator, film director, and film producer. Culhane worked for several animation studios, including Fleischer Studios, the Ub Iwerks studio, Walt Disney Productions, and the Walter Lantz studio.

He began his animation career in 1925 working for J.R. Bray studios, and is known for promoting the animation talents of his inker/assistant at the Fleischer Studios in the early 1930s, Lillian Friedman, making her the first female studio animator.

Culhane also animated characters for the Flip the Frog series, including Flip's Betty Boop-ish girlfriend Fifi. In 1994, he drew an "exclusive" Limited Edition cel titled "Betty Likes It Hot,"[2] featuring Betty Boop in a famous Marilyn Monroe pose.

Quotes

Shamus Culhane: "Under careful cross-examination Helen Kane had to admit that she, in turn had copied the 'Boop-Boop-a-Doop' business from an obscure black singer Baby Esther."[3] (1986)

He was a lead animator on Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in which he animated the "Heigh-Ho" sequence, which took him a total of six months to complete.
