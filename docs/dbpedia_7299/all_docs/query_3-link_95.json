But, this Friday not one but TWO recognizable faces will be in the studio.\n\nChristopher \"Kid\" Reid\n\nChristopher Kid Reid | FaceBook\n\nFirst, Chris “Kid” Reid will be in town.\n\nYou know Kid from Kid n Play, a legit force in the hip hop world…\n\nEven if you don’t recognize the song (unlikely) you DEFINITELY recognize that famous hi-top fade. Kid n Play also made FIVE House Party movies.\n\nFive.\n\nHere’s the famous dance scene from the first one…\n\nYou might even remember Kid n Play had their own Saturday morning cartoon that was… something...special.\n\nChris “Kid” Reid is headlining a benefit show for the cops. It’s for the El Paso Municipal Police Officers Association scholarship fund.\n\nIt’s this Saturday at the EPMOA Memorial Hall at 3601 Rutherglen.\n\nThere are going to be two shows, both on Saturday.\n\nThe first show is at 7:30 and the second is at 9:30.\n\nAlong with Kid will be Jorge Jimenez, The Comegician Gibbs Saad, and EPPD’s own Joe Rosales.\n\nGreg Romero Wilson\n\nNow, the second famous guest on Friday will be Greg Romero Wilson.\n\nGreg is a well-known touring comic who’s also appeared in too many movies and television shows to list here.\n\nMaybe you’ve seen his most recent GEICO commercial where he’s jumping off a parking garage, shooting through a window, etc. etc.\n\nGreg Romero Wilson performs at Bart Reed’s Comic Strip this Friday through Sunday.\n\nAlso, his family LIVES in El Paso so he’ll enjoy some home-cooked meals while he’s here.\n\nBoth Chris “Kid” Reid and Greg Romero Wilson will be in the KLAQ MoShow Studio this Friday morning."
