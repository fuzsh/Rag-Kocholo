        "text": "Happy 60th Anniversary to the World-Famous Studio Tour! This beloved attraction isn’t just a fan favorite; it kicked off a series of innovations that completely reshaped the themed entertainment industry. To honor this game-changing tram tour, Universal Studio Hollywood has a whole bunch of vintage-inspired fun in store from April 26 to August 11, 2024.\n\nA (very) quick history lesson: The Studio Tour began in 1964 as Universal Studios’ humble effort to get tourists onto the lot to pay for lunch at the commissary. Guests paid $2.50, hopped aboard a candy-striped “GlamorTram,” and got to peek at film sets, a stunt show, a makeup demonstration and a costume show. In doing so, Universal effectively demystified the movie-making process, as film sets had until then been largely closed off to the public. But beyond that, the Universal Studio Tour birthed a series of innovations that changed entertainment forever. Showcasing practical effects on the Studio Tour led to creating thrill rides based on beloved movies, which led to…well, what Universal Studios Hollywood is today. Learn more about the history of the Studio Tour right here.\n\nSix decades and over 200 million guests later, the Studio Tour basically invented the modern theme park. So how could Universal not throw a party for it? Here’s everything you need to know about the celebrations for the 60th Anniversary of the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nA Special Edition Studio Tour\n\nEven if you’ve been on the Studio Tour before, you’ve definitely never experienced what the 60th Anniversary of the Studio Tour has to offer. Naturally, the biggest Studio Tour celebrations are happening on the attraction itself. The whole tour is getting a makeover for its anniversary, including updated decor, new scripts for the tour guides, and new media content (featuring new celebrity cameos) you’ll watch on the tour.\n\nThe trams themselves are getting in on the fun, too: several will be made up to look like old school, candy-striped Glamor Trams, just like those from the 1960s. Plus, new (and oh-so quiet) electric trams will take guests cruising through the past in modern style.\n\nStep Onto an Iconic Movie Set\n\nThe 60th Anniversary Studio Tour is so much more than a makeover. For the first time in decades, guests will get to step off the Studio Tour trams and experience the studio backlot by foot! Once the tram reaches a certain well-known movie set, you’ll get to deboard for some extra special photo ops. Not only will you get an opportunity to get up close and personal with an old-school Glamor Tram, but you’ll get unique photo ops inspired by some of Universal’s most adored blockbusters. Some of those include special, cinematic AR filters, but we’ll keep that as a fun surprise.\n\nAnd, just a heads up, you are on one of the creepiest sets in movie history. Keep an eye out for a certain someone lurking around the set. He just might be amenable to a selfie — if you’re lucky.\n\nExperience Historic Studio Tour Moments\n\nThe World-Famous Studio Tour is always a fun history lesson, but this special version will really relish in the legacy of this iconic attraction. Several iterations of the Studio Tour have traversed the studio backlot. That means celebrated experiences have come and gone, including the Parting of the Red Sea, the Ice Tunnel, and so many more. This year’s gussied-up tour will give you a taste of those retired moments: as you pass the location of an erstwhile Studio Tour moment, the tram screens will display what Classic Moment used to be there. For history nerds like me, this is huge.\n\nEven better, though: one of those Classic Moments is returning to the World-Famous Studio Tour for this celebratory event! The Runaway Train, which originally ran from 1974-1985, will be in the backlot for the 60th Anniversary of the Studio Tour. (An archival photo of the original is shown above.) If you want to see an old-school attraction up close, you’ll definitely need to take a spin on the Studio Tour this summer.\n\nPRO TIP: So many classics were shot in Courthouse Square, but “Back to the Future” fans know the set best as downtown Hill Valley. Keep your eyes peeled for a familiar scientist (and vehicle!) once your tram reaches this memorable locale.\n\nA New Look For a Beloved Classic\n\nOne beloved Studio Tour moment has a whole new look for 2024. “Earthquake – The Big One” which replicates an 8.3 Richter scale seismic shift inside a 1989 San Francisco BART station, has been revamped as a modern subway stop, complete with electric bikes and sleek white tiles. Don’t worry, “Earthquake – The Big One” hasn’t lost any of the thrills its namesake promises. Complete with a fire, a ceiling crashing in, a gas tank sliding into the station, a flood — all fabricated with practical effects, of course – the 21st century spin on the crowd favorite won’t disappoint.\n\nKeep the Celebration Going at Universal Plaza\n\nYou don’t have to wait until you’re on the tram to get a taste of the Studio Tour fun! From June 22 through August 11, Universal Plaza (located on the Upper Lot) is totally decked out for the Studio Tour 60th Anniversary. Here, you get to immerse yourself in the six-decade history of the Universal Studios Tram Tour — it’s a chance to relive iconic moments of the tour’s storied past.\n\nIn addition to limited-time 60th Anniversary merchandise and food carts, the plaza has a series of throwback photo ops just begging to be in your selfies. Strike a pose with recreations of various iconic Studio Tour moments, including the larger-than-life Ice Tunnel (a classic, now retired Studio Tour attraction), the Amity Island billboard, and a tribute to the Six Points wild west area in the backlot. Holding court in the middle of the plaza is one of the most recognizable vehicles of all-time: the Time Machine from “Back To The Future.” Step up and say “Cheese!”\n\nPlus, you can get up close and personal with Universal royalty, Woody and Winnie Woodpecker. And, in what will certainly be my most coveted photo of the summer, you’ll get a chance to hop on a bike and (appear to) pedal through the night sky with the Extra-Terrestrial himself! (I’ll be posting that one on the fridge, thank you very much.)\n\nWhat’s more, Universal Plaza is just a stone’s throw from Mel’s Diner and City Snack Shop, whose menus boast all kinds of Studio Tour-themed goodies this summer. Let’s dig in!\n\nCelebratory Food and Beverage Offerings\n\nWhat’s a celebration without party food, right? Throughout the festivities, Universal will have special, retro-inspired eats, drinks and desserts available throughout the park. Here’s what you can expect on the food and beverage front:\n\nSpecial Edition Popcorn Bucket\n\nGreat news for collectors: for the 60th Anniversary of the Studio Tour, Universal Studios Hollywood is rolling out one of its more adorable popcorn buckets ever. Classic Universal cartoon character Woody Woodpecker helms the Studio Tour on this delightful snack vessel. Woody might not actually drive the Glamor Tram in real life, but let us dream, OK?\n\nFestive Drinks\n\nThe park has two celebratory drinks on tap to honor the 60th. And they are both, in a word, extra— in the very best way. First is the non-alcoholic Cosmic Pop, a swirl of Sprite, alcohol-free blue Curaçao, grenadine and sparkling cranberry juice, topped with blue raspberry Pop Rocks.\n\nFor the 21+ crowd, there’s the Glitz and Glamour, a vodka hibiscus lemonade; the Shark Bite, a tequila-based drink with tropical vibes and a shark lollipop; the Old Hollywood, with whiskey, a root beer liqueur and cream soda; and the rum-based Banana Tiki which, appropriately, uses banana and other fruit flavors. When I said extra, I meant it.\n\nCelebratory Snacks\n\nGuests can enjoy 60th Anniversary snacks on-the-go, too. City Snack Shop, a to-go stand flanking Production Plaza on the Upper Lot, is offering giant pretzels shaped like the number 60, special edition Banana Breath Popcorn (that’s caramel + banana chips), and a whole lineup of commemorative sugar cookies — including one shaped like a candy-striped Glamor Tram. Just don’t forget to Instagram it before you take a bite!\n\nNostalgic Meals\n\nYou’ll find the bulk of the Studio Tour 60th Anniversary offerings at Hollywood & Dine and Mel’s, two eateries located on the Upper Lot. Hollywood & Dine will boast a drool-worthy slate of sandwiches — smoked brisket, BBQ cheeseburger, BBQ pulled pork, and BBQ grilled chicken — all on adorable Woody Woodpecker buns. Over at Mel’s, guests will nosh on fried chicken and meatloaf served on throwback combo trays. It’s just so charmingly ‘60s, isn’t it?\n\nDelightful Desserts\n\nIf you’re a can’t-skip-dessert person like me, you’ll be particularly amped for the Studio Tour 60th anniversary. Over at Hollywood & Dine, guests can dig into sweets inspired by Woody Woodpecker’s pal Chilly Willy: the Chilly Willy Funnel Cake, and the Chilly Willy snowball. Film Reel Cookie Sandwich, which is a sugar cookie with cream filling shaped, yes, like a film reel. Lights! Camera! Dig in!\n\nDown on the Lower Lot, Studio Scoop has whipped up some throwback treats for the festivities, too. You might need a buddy to dig into Kong’s Ice Cream Sundae, a gigantic banana split topped with strawberry, chocolate, waffle cone chunks, candy bananas, whipped cream, banana chips and a 60th Anniversary cookie. If you don’t have a Kong-sized appetite, try the Glam Tram Cone: vanilla soft serve with a strawberry flavor swirl, also topped with a 60th Anniversary cookie.\n\nAnd don’t miss out on the big daddy of ‘em all: the 60th Donut. It’s technically two donuts covered in blue icing and candy pearls, because we’re just that serious about celebrating.\n\nPRO TIP: In-between sundaes and donuts, keep your eyes peeled for blue signs reading HERE BACK THEN all throughout the theme park. When you scan the QR code, you’ll get a look at the retired attractions or shows that used to stand in that same spot.\n\n60th Anniversary Dining Pass\n\nWant to really indulge in all the flashback fare the 60th Anniversary of the Studio Tour has to offer? The Dining Pass just might be for you. One pass includes your choice of two entrees and four desserts, snacks, sides or beverages. Just head to a location serving retro 60th Anniversary bites, flash your Dining Pass, and dig in. Check out the full details here.\n\nCityWalk Eats\n\nThe celebration doesn’t stop once you leave the theme park! Dining locations at Universal CityWalk Hollywood are getting in on the 60th anniversary fun, too. As always, Voodoo Doughnut has concocted an undeniably adorable themed treat. They’re honoring the Studio Tour’s six-decade run with a raised yeast doughnut, with a whipped blood orange filling, decorated like an old-school Glamor Tram. You’ll have just as much fun eating it as you will photographing it.\n\nBut the doughnut shop is far from the only spot getting in on the retro fun this summer! Margaritaville is serving Mama’s Chicken Dinner and Mama’s Apple Pie, NBC Sports Grill & Brew has a delightfully well-balanced Classic TV Dinner on the menu, and Antojitos Cocina Mexicana is dishing up just-have-to-order-it Mexican Fondue. Over at VIVO Italian Kitchen, you can get an Old Fashioned Classico made tableside (how chic!), and pair it with their Dolce di Nonna for dessert. And we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention the retro milkshake offerings at the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium and Savory Feast Kitchen! Take your choice of classic strawberry, vanilla, or chocolate shakes, with the option to add a shot to make it a “Milk-tail.” You’re welcome.\n\nGet the full scoop on all the CityWalk fun with Discover Universal’s Guide to Universal CityWalk Hollywood.\n\nLimited-Edition Throwback Merch\n\nThe Studio Tour 60th aesthetic is looking cute. Inspired by the red and white stripes on the original Glamor Trams, these shirts, jackets, hats, mugs, cups and so much more will be available at Universal Studio Store at CityWalk, Universal Studio Store (inside the theme park) and Production Central (also inside the theme park) all celebration long. Because we all want a piece of history all to ourselves, right?\n\nThat’s what’s on the docket for the Studio Tour 60th Anniversary celebration at Universal Studios Hollywood! What’s your favorite part of the backlot tour? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nMust be 21 years and older with valid identification to purchase or drink alcoholic beverages."
