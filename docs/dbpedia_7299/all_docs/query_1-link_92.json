        "text": "Walter Lantz, an animator and producer who created the cartoon characters Woody Woodpecker and Andy Panda, died yesterday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, Calif. He was 93 and lived in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe cause was heart disease, said Kenneth Thimmel, a friend.\n\nMr. Lantz made more than 800 short films, about 200 of them featuring the brash red-headed woodpecker with the noisy \"ha-ha-ha-HA-ha\" laugh. Mr. Lantz's cartoons have been translated into more than 60 languages and seen in more than 70 countries, according to Universal Studios, their distributor. From Hearst to Hollywood\n\nMr. Lantz was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., on April 27, 1900, the first of three sons of an immigrant grocer. The family name, Lanza, had been changed to Lantz by an immigration official. At the age of 15, Mr. Lantz was hired as an office boy in the art department of The New York American, William Randolph Hearst's newspaper, where, among his other duties, he washed brushes for Winsor McCay, the legendary Hearst illustrator.\n\nMr. Lantz took night classes at the Art Students League, and his ambition and competence were such that at the age of 16 he was hired to work in the new Hearst animation studio, which produced films of comic characters owned by Hearst, including Krazy Kat, the Katzenjammer Kids and Happy Hooligan. Within two years, Mr. Lantz was promoted to full-fledged animator."
