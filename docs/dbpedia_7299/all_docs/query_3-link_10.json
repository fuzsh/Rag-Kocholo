        "text": "J B Roongta, the founder of Famous Studio, needs no introduction. He was the first to have introduced Asia’s first air-conditioned studios (Famous Studios) in pre-independent India, 1946. Anant Roongta is the third generation of the family. It has been 4 years since Anant has taken the position of MD and taking forth the 75-year legacy.\n\nWith a keen fascination with content from the very beginning, Anant spearheaded new offerings at the studio such as visual engineering, Motion Capture, content creation, production, and post-production, and has launched India’s second-largest Dolby Atmos home mixing facility for the OTT original content space.\n\nIn an exclusive interaction with Media Infoline, Anant Roongta, Managing Director, Famous Studios talks about\n\nQ) Tell us something about your passion, hobbies, and dreams.\n\nAnant: In 2009, I began my business career after working with Famous Studios for five years. There wasn’t much going on in the Media Industry other than regular broadcast and Television Ads. My interest at the time was sports, so I decided to team up with my cousin’s brother to launch a Sports Tourism company. I was in charge of that company from 2014 to 2018. Post that, I returned to Famous Studios to drive the business here as OTT platforms had started creating ripples and it was time for Famous to foray into multiple verticals.\n\nAlso Read: Famous Studios debuts in OTT; releases “Shaadisthan” on Disney+Hotstar\n\nI have always been a huge fan of the process of filmmaking and how it translates to the screen creating immersive storylines. Given my love for films and sports, I wish to strengthen Famous Studios’ presence in the film industry nationally & internationally to sustain our 75 Year legacy. The excitement, challenges, and opportunities that lie ahead have motivated us to create content that makes a difference highlighting the true essence of Famous Studios. Going forward, the main goal of Famous Studios is to create a world-class center of excellence where any storyteller who wishes to publish their story through audio, video mode can use our facility to make their dream come true. We also aim to inspire the next generation of storytellers with the help of our trust, technology, and infrastructure.\n\nQ) Take us through your journey of being the Managing Director of Famous Studios.\n\nAnant: To be honest, it’s a family business that my grandfather started. It’s more than just being a Managing Director or having that title; it’s the duty that my grandfather and father have placed on me to carry on their heritage and be committed to the clients and technology, which is a critical aspect of the business. The journey has been quite fascinating. When I returned to Famous back in 2018, I spent a few months trying to identify the need of the market from a services standpoint, while simultaneously launching a new enterprise in content production. We eventually began to invest in the right technology, and as a result, we were able to move forward with our film Shaadisthan, which was co-produced by Mr. Sanjay Shetty. The movie is now streaming on Disney+Hotstar. Besides that, we’ve completely overhauled the infrastructure, studio facilities, co-working space, visual effects, green screen with virtual production, and visual engineering. We completely remodeled the post-production facility, and Famous Studios is now one of the only few studios in the country with certified Dolby facilities. Our services business doesn’t just rely on branded content i.e., commercials but also closely working with significant OTT players, production houses, broadcasters, and has just launched a localization business that has delivered multiple titles in multiple languages.\n\nQ) Has the pandemic affected the business? If yes, then how?\n\nAnant: The pandemic has affected the industry, disrupting content production at large with restricted mobility and COVID protocols. With multiple waves, businesses across the sector have faced huge losses. Having said that, we have successfully managed to diversify our business and that has helped us keep the business strong and operational. As a matter of fact, there were no pay cuts to the employees during the pandemic. With the foresight of the first and second wave, Famous Studios moves forward to create and help create content like never before.\n\nAlso Read: Famous Studios unveils Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision Facility\n\nQ) What is your plan for the future of entertainment?\n\nAnant: In terms of the future of entertainment, I believe that content will have a very broad scope and will be well shared across all platforms and devices. Having said that, as businesses unlock, the audience will go back to the routine and begin visiting theatres to experience cinema in a conventional manner. Whereas on OTT, the content will manifest, and people will see new producers, new directors with different ideas. And then content will be produced in different ways with the help of new technologies. I feel tech will play a major role in the future of entertainment. As we all know India is a land of heritage, culture and there are so many stories that are embedded in different parts of the country and now the time has come to work on those stories and bring them to life.\n\nQ) Tell us about the growth and changes of the cinema industry.\n\nAnant: Over the years, content consumption has changed. The audience is now looking for immersive and impactful storylines instead of conventional masala films. This is large because of the new talent flooding the industry. From screenwriters to new-age storytellers, the film industry as we know has evolved for the better. While OTT is dominating film consumption during the pandemic, cinemas will get back to routine once everything is normal. So, the future of cinema is bright and as I said, technology will play an important role in showbiz.\n\n“Our services business doesn’t just rely on branded content i.e., commercials but also closely working with significant OTT players, production houses, broadcasters, and has just launched a localization business that has delivered multiple titles in multiple languages.”\n\nQ) Will people go back to the cinema halls?\n\nAnant: Cinema is all about the immersive experience, people don’t go to cinema halls to watch movies, they go there to experience it. The sound, the ambiance, the tech involved gives a holistic movie-watching experience. While OTT is dominating the film consumption space, we should also note that several films are meant to be experienced instead of just watching. One cannot attain the cinema hall type experience on OTT, they can only watch the movies. For instance, if Interstellar were to be released on OTT today, the way it was shot and the tech involved in making the film would not have done justice to it. To answer the question, people will go back to cinema halls to experience the true essence of cinema.\n\nQ) Tell us about your collaboration in terms of films.\n\nAnant: The most recent collaboration is our feature film Shaadisthan that is co-produced by Famous Studios and Opticus Inc. With this film, we at Famous Studios, have forayed into OTT content production. Besides Shaadisthan, we have also collaborated with Netflix and Amazon Prime for some of their shows. We are looking forward to producing more such content in the near future. As one of the largest studios in India, we have the benefit of in-house shooting facilities such as shooting floors, cameras, post-production, visuals effects, volumetric capture, virtual production, etc., that would help us inspire new-age storytellers to leverage our facility for creating compelling stories.\n\nAlso Read: FoxyMoron And Famous Studios Partner To Create India’s Largest Digital Content Lab\n\nQ) What’s your plan for the future?"
