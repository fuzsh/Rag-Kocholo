        "text": "​For all its light-hearted, rambunctious fun this first Out of the Inkwell film also demonstrates the enthusiasm for innovation and invention that, in the coming years, would attract so many talented animators to Out of the Inkwell, Inc. and quickly became synonymous with the “Fleischer Style\". Modeling featured the use of Max’s most recent invention, the Rotograph, which further refined the Fleischer’s novel blend of live action and animation. The film also featured extensive use of Claymation, at the time still a relatively new technique. Blending Claymation with live action and animation, Modeling creates a world in which the power of the artists’ imagination- at times awkward, at times hilarious- seems to know no bounds. ​\n\nDave Fleischer can be seen in the 1922 Film The Mechanical Doll (a.k.a. The Dresden Doll) in which he plays a projectionist whose screen and projector are highjacked by Max’s Little Clown who draws and then falls in love with a dancing girl only to have her melt when she is hit by a drop of oil from the projectionist’s oil can. It has been suggested that Max's daughter Ruth served as the model for the Little Clown's dancing doll. This is quite possible. Ruth was a dancer in real life and would later be featured in the Studio's live action Carrie of the Chorus series and- both animated and in live action- in the film Ko-ko's Queen.\n\nThe live action sequences, especially in these early films, tended to feature the people who happened to be around. Often sequences were shot in their own living rooms. Descendants of the brothers have recognized everything from family rugs to hand mirrors in these early films.\n\nAbove and right: Live action scenes were often shot in whatever found space was available. In these remarkable photos, Max himself climbs a ladder to help prepare for a scene. (photos courtesy of J.J. Sedelmaier Collection)\n\nAbove: Dave Fleischer, who also served as the model for the Little Clown, comes face-to-face with his alter ego in \"The Mechanical Doll.\"\n\nIn 1922, Out of the Inkwell became one of the first studios to sign with Margaret “Peggy” Winkler, the first female film producer/distributor. Under the gender-shielding moniker of M.J. Winkler, Peggy Winkler would go on to play a critical role in the success of many of the greatest animators of the silent era, including Walt Disney.\n\nOut of the Inkwell, Inc. released 27 films between 1921 and 1923. Most were shorts that featured their famous- and still unnamed- Little Clown. But in 1923, the studio released two longer, scientific films, Relativity and Evolution, that marked a dramatic departure from the studio's usual animated antics.\n\nRelativity and Evolution reflected Max’s lifelong interest in science, as well as his deep belief in the power of film to convey new and complex ideas to audiences regardless of their access to education. While this may not seem like a particularly radical statement today, it was not a generally accepted point of view at the time.\n\nRelativity and Evolution explained complex scientific theories that were still new to the general public.\n\nEvolution, on the other hand, drew audiences but also drew controversy. Released two years prior to the infamous Scopes Trial in which a Tennessee teacher was accused of illegally teaching Darwin’s theories, Evolution introduced audiences to ideas that, at the time, were still considered quite radical.\n\n1923 was also the year that animator Dick Huemer joined the growing Out of the Inkwell team as Animation Director. Huemer's work had a remarkable style and energy that transformed the look and feel of Max’s Little Clown. He named the clown Ko-ko and gave him a sidekick; the mischievous little dog Fitz.\n\n​Max was so impressed with Huemer’s skill and distinctive style that he hired an assistant to create the “in between” images that carried the characters from one gesture or motion to the next. This practice of having a second animator create these in-between images sped up production and allowed Huemer to take the lead on a greater number of films. It also created a new job in the field of animation: the inbetweener.\n\nOver the years, many great animators would start their careers with the studio as inbetweeners- including the very first inbetweener Art Davis. Dave Tendlar, Shamus Culhane and Benny Wolf all started as inbetweeners at Out of the Inkwell, as did Edith Vernick, the first female inbetweener who eventually became the \"Inbetween Supervisor.\"\n\n​It wasn’t long before the brothers found that they’d outgrown their basement beginnings. In November of 1923 the studio- now with 19 employees- moved to the 6th floor of the iconic Studebaker Building at 1600 Broadway in the heart of New York City."
