        "text": "Floyd Norman is a former Disney animator whose credits stretch as long as my arm, and may be the only black animator who worked with Walt directly. This is not meant as a negative towards Disney, mind you -- he came from a different era.\n\nJames Tucker of Justice League, Legion of Superheroes, and the upcoming Batman: The Brave & the Bold is also black. I'm sure that there was one other JL staffer who was black (and wasn't Dwayne McDuffie, who's a writer and not an animator), but I'm blanking on a name at the moment.\n\n-- Ed\n\nI don't how how famous these people are but there's Ron Husband:\n\nhttp://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3990932.html\n\nThere's people listed here:\n\nhttp://blackcartoons.tripod.com/\n\nand\n\nI just found this:\n\nfrom http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3990932.html :\n\nThere have been very few women of color in animation history. The first woman (of any color) that I know of who worked in the US industry was Lillian Friedman at Fleischers in 1933. Myron Waldman helped move her up when Al Eugster, Grim Natwick, Berny Wolf and Shamus Culhane all jumped ship to Hollywood and Iwerks.\n\nWhile she wasn't an animator, Mary Tebb was a crucial part of the Iwerks Studio color department and had a leadership role there. Unfortunately her role didn't help women in other positions there. Dot Powers, the daughter of mogul, Pat Powers, languished in minor roles at the Iwerks Studio. She told me that she attempted to get promoted to animator many times and believed she had the skill to do so but was always kept out of the boys club. Her father would not intervene on her behalf and she eventually left the industry somewhat bitter about the entire experience.\n\nAnd of course, lest our US-big studio fetish prevent us from looking beyond our shores, Lotte Reininger was already renowned in the 1920s for her silhouette animation.\n\nSorry for restarting this thread, but a month ago, I was talking about this subject over a couple weeks ago.\n\nTo me, they're all famous.\n\nJames Tucker (Animator on Animaniacs for Startoons; Character Designer/Director on Superman:TAS, Batman Beyond; Producer on Justice League, Legion of Superheroes, and Batman: The Brave and The Bold)\n\nDavid Teague (Director on The Oz Kids, Sabrina: TAS, Extreme Ghostbusters)\n\nFrank C. Braxton (The first noted African-American animator working under Ben Washam in the Chuck Jones unit at Warner Bros.
