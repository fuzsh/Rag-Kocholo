        "text": "Muscle Shoals Sound Studio is owned and operated by the Muscle Shoals Music Foundation (MSMF), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. This status ensures that all revenue from tours, sales of merchandise, and recording sessions directly contributes to the improvement of the studio. In addition to managing the studio, the foundation collaborates with educational institutions in the Shoals area, such as the University of North Alabama’s music education and recording technology program, as well as Nashville’s Blackbird Academy.\n\nThe foundation was established prior to its acquisition of Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in 2013, initiating private fundraising efforts aimed at restoring the original building to its former splendor. During this period, Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine from Beats Electronics were inspired by a documentary and subsequently launched a philanthropic initiative within Beats called ‘Sustain the Sound.’ Their grant to the foundation played a pivotal role in realizing the dream of revitalizing historic studios, with 3614 Jackson Highway being a primary focus.\n\nFollowing the commencement of restoration in late 2015, the project reached completion on January 8, 2017. Since reopening on January 9, 2017, the studio has welcomed visitors from all 50 states, 40 different countries, and every continent. Thanks to the generous support of donors, Muscle Shoals Sound Studio now stands restored to its 1969 state, poised to enrich its legendary legacy and sustain its future."
