        "text": "The World Famous Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood\n\nThe World Famous Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood\n\nGo behind the scenes of a real working movie studio at Universal Studios Hollywood during your visit to the entertainment capital of LA! Paying homage to over 100 years of movie making history this working studio is constantly belting out blockbuster movies, is home to numerous television and cable T.V hits and hosts live tapings the public is welcome to attend all while providing an amazing destination for locals and visitors alike to enjoy. The beginnings of the Studio Tour have set the foundation for what is now one of Hollywood's most visited icons, see what awaits you!\n\nUniversal Studios dates back to March of 1915 when it's founder, Carl Laemmle, opened the gates of the studio which was then called Universal City. Public paid an admission price of 25 cents where they could enjoy a hillside picnic while watching the production of Universal’s latest film on the 230 acre ranch. Filming in front of a live audience posed no dilemma during the silent film era until all that changed and the term “quiet on the set” became necessary when sound was introduced into films in the 30's. In 1964 the studio started offering tram tours and the rest is history.\n\nA visit to Universal Studios Hollywood is not complete without taking a ride on the Studio Tram tour! Hop on as you are driven around 13 city blocks on four acres of this historic studio lot in the largest set construction project in studio history, many built with the creative consultation from Steven Spielberg himself.\n\nLaugh along with comedian Jimmy Fallon who is the video co host of the Studio Tour along with your driver and studio tour guide. As you tour takes you through many working sets the star of “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” introduces entertaining clips seen on overhead HD monitors in the tram aiding the live Studio Tour guide narration. What you get is a very funny, interesting and informative look into the makings of movies from yesteryear and today.\n\nWhat you can expect to see and experience\n\nDrive through the smoldering wreckage of the Boeing 747 from Steven Spielberg’s 2005 War of the Worlds staring Tom Cruise. The plane itself cost $60k but to have to delivered costs a whopping 200k! all for it to appear in the movie for a few short minutes.\n\nLive through Earthquake The Big One.\n\nCome face to face with King Kong 360 3-D created by Peter Jackson. It’s the world’s largest, most intense 3-D experience based off the Blockbuster film that was released in 2005. This part of the tour opened July 1, 2010 after a fire destroyed the original that was open from 1986 to 2008. (3D glasses are used for this section of the tour)\n\nMoving Picture Car line up includes vehicles from Jurassic Park, Fast and the Furious, The Flintstones and many more!\n\nTravel through Jurassic Park with picture cars used in the films and a few feisty inhabitants along the way.\n\nVisit old Mexico and 6 Points Texas.\n\nCourthouse Square is home to Back to the Future.\n\nAmity is still a sleepy town due to it's largest dweller Bruce the shark from Jaws!\n\nFans of Desperate Housewives will get a close up look at Wisteria Lane from the T.V Series\n\nThere’s a vacancy just for you at the legendary Bates Motel from Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. Check in for a restful stay but I have a feeling Norman is up to his old ways still.\n\nSee where Sully, Bruce Almighty and Jaws filmed their water scenes at Falls Lake. The Log Cabin directly in front of it was where The Great Outdoors was filmed.\n\nGo behind the scenes! Explore the largest and busiest motion picture and TV studio in the world. More movies and television shows have filmed on this lot than any other lot in the world. Current filming The Voice, The Happy Place Hallmarks Home and Family show, Family Feud and countless more.\n\nGrab those 3D glasses and hold on tight for the grand finale of the Studio Tour, Fast & Furious – Supercharged!\n\nOther famous movie sets you might see are the streets where they filmed Back to the Future, Spiderman, Blues Brothers, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Psycho, War of the Worlds. Filming of hits like Pirates of the Carribean, Spider Man, as well as the classic like Dracula and Frankenstein all happened here too, the list goes on and on!\n\nDue to the back lot being an actual filming location, each studio tour can be different. Live filming aka a hot set will detour the tour or have the trams guide go silent within areas of the lot. Here is a little more info about the tour:\n\nRun time will vary from 45 minutes to 1 hour and you never know who you might see!\n\nThere are 4 cars to a tram and each provide a different experience. I always recommend the 3 car from the front, right or left gets you a different but equally fun experience.\n\nThere are tours offered completly in Spanish and Chinese check for times.\n\nLooking for a different way to experience the Studio Tour? Check it out at night!\n\nGeneral info: Food and drinks are allowed on the tram. Hit the restrooms before you board the tram located just after you exit the escalators to the right. Selfie sticks are not allowed on the tram. Check out the Hollywood sign photo opp after returning from the tour on the left. Have questions? The tram guide is available after your tour to answer them. FYI: Want to get even closer to the sets and buildings on the back lot? Visit during HHN or go big and do the VIP tour!\n\nEnter for a chance at the pair of Harry Potter Charm Bracelets below! Good Luck.\n\nMore of what's happening at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Citywalk below."
