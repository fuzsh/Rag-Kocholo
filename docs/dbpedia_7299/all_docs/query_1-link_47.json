        "text": "This page contains information about lost films written by Michigan animator/director Steve Stanchfield. Steve has a huge collection of 35mm and 16mm film, including the only known prints of several cartoons from yesteryear. These are some notes I requested from him about some of the cartoons he has:\n\nMendelssohn's Spring Song-1931- A \"Jingles\" cartoon (only one made) animated by (Sy) Cy Young and a handful of art students. Young went on to head the special Effects department at Walt Disney Studios, doing some amazing work on Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo and Bambi. Reportedly, this is the film that gave Disney the idea to hire Young. Animated in New York, it was the first animation experience for Lillian Freedman, who was the first woman to work as an animator in the Studio system, at Fleischers. Brewster color was a two-color process that was patented in 1931 but only used in a handful of cartoons. (perhaps this film was a test?) Young moved back to New York after the strike at Disneys, working on commercials. Shamus Culhane told a friend of mine (Les Brooks) that Cy changed his name to \"SY\" to protect his ethnicity (sy, after all, could be Sylvester!). Cy commited suicide in 1959. Transferred from the only known print.\n\nThe Museum-1930- starring Toby the Pup- One of the few existing Toby the Pup cartoons (and incomplete at that). Made by Charles Mintz studio for Radio Pictures (RKO) and directed by Fleischer Vet Dick Huemer, who went on to direct the early Scrappy cartoons. Another Toby cartoon just turned up in a television package somewhere in the middle east!\n\nThe Snowman-1932 (released 33) Produced by New York based Ted Eshbaugh productions and Released by Invincible Pictures (home movie /TV version released by Official Films). Cute 30's animals build a Snowman that comes to life and terrorizes them. Origially filmed in Two-Strip Technicolor (Eshbaugh financed these shorts by doing slides for the educational market). I almost have my paws on a 35mm nitrate Technicolor print of this thing....\n\nLittle Black Sambo- 1935-UB Iwerks- design by Grim Natwick based on a children's book version) 2-color Cinecolor (need I say more?). Cinecolor was used in these cartoons because of Disney's exclusive deal with Technicolor (the ban was lifted in 1936- the year Iwerks folded)\n\nGoofy Goat Antics-1931- originally made in technicolor as well- some sources say this film was made in 1929- hard to believe. Eshbaugh had a deal with the originally based in New York Technicolor and it's possible this film was a kind of test for the two-color process (some sources say it was made for Technicolor).\n\nWizard of OZ- Eshbaugh -1932/33- Another rare short by Eshbaugh- this was never released to theatres because of a legal problem with Frank Baum's estate (I couldn't find any record of legal action taken). Another source (late film historian Bill Everson,who worked with Eshbaugh in the 60's) said that Wizard was actually made in 3-strip Tech, but couldn't be released because of Disney's exclusive right to Technicolor). Strangely enough, Carl Stalling (who left Disney in Mid 32) did the score for this film!\n\nCAPN' CUB- 1944 (released in sept 45.. AFTER the war was over!!)- mind numbing propaganda, animated by Esbaugh and at least one former Fleischer employee....Beautiful Technicolor...\n\nUndersea Wedding is the first Russian (Czech) fully animated cartoon. Made in color in 1945, it took over a year to complete. Obviously influenced by American shorts, the short also has rotoscoping and multiplane camera effects. Very impressive, eh? A little floaty. A friend of mine has it in color but STILL won't let me borrow it!! It has a hot spot in the middle of that print, though.. Official films released this and the second short from the studio as well ( I think it's called the grey donkey or something like that....\n\nKorn Plastered In Africa is absolutely one of the strangest cartoons ever. Animated by \"Scarfoot\" (!) McCrorey (sp?), it stars the voice of Uncle Don, a popular childen's radio personality in New York. Uncle Don was supposedly fired for saying at the end of a broadcast \"that oughtta take care of the little bastards for another week\" not knowing the microphone was still on.... The thing really looks like it was made silent, or at least most of it... There's that really strange double exposed scene in the middle.. McCrorey was a spot cartoonist and work at Van Beuren at least for a little while. In the early/Mid 30's he wrote the Walter Foster \"how to draw animated cartoon\" book. It's still for sale; the author if officially listed as being WALTER FOSTER in the book, even with a mini- biography!! Someone who worked at Media Station had the 1930's version of the book, with proper credits...\n\nHey Steve, what's up with that \"Mischevous Mice\" Cubby Bear cartoon produced by Harman/Ising?\n\nBy early 1933 RKO was unhappy with the quality of Van Bueren's product. Disney's Cartoons were becoming more and more popular and most of the studios wanted their cartoon product to have some marquee value. In 1935 Terrytoons was told to \"fix\" their product or be shut down. Van Beuren's studio was really an offshoot of Terry's operation- Terry and Van Beuren ran the Fables studio though the 20s, then parted in 1929 over the dispute of whether or not to make sound cartoons-Van Bueren did, Terry refused- for another year! Used to tiny budgets and short schedules (with 2 units, Van Bueren turned out a new sound cartoon almost every two weeks!) Van Bueren's product was easily some of the sloppiest (but strange and surreal!) of any studio. In an attempt to increase the quality of its product, Van Beuren bought the rights to Otto Soglo's popular Little King character. Manny Davis, a longtime animation vet, created Cubby Bear (I looked for all the Cubby cartoons for 6 years- and finally got them all- in 1992). Van Beuren heard of Harman/Ising's leave form Warners and hired them to make 3 Cubby Bears in 1933. They are pretty slick compared to Van Beurens, but nowhere near as much fun... it's the same ol' Harman Ising thing. Some sort of dispute occured while the third short was in production-Hugh Harman kept it and released it (with the sound from a 1947 film he made called Easy Does It(for Van Camp's) plus some stock music.)"
