        "text": "THE little-known 1933 short film called \"Stoopnocracy\" opens with two cartoon dogs driving a truck painted with the words \"Nut House Wagon.\" A dispatcher's voice commands them to \"go to 1600 Broadway--big nuts just broke loose!\"\n\nIt wasn't such an outlandish observation. Back then, the building at 1600 Broadway, on the corner of 48th Street, was the real-life home to Fleischer Studios, where the winsome young brunette Betty Boop was born and countless irreverent shorts like \"Stoopnocracy\" were churned out. It is easy to see how the film's creators might have fancied themselves nuts; they were working for the biggest animation company in the East Coast and producing films, some 600 in all, noted for their clever gags and surreal images. The same year \"Stoopnocracy\" was made, the studio headed by Max Fleischer animated a comic strip character who, in his heyday, proved more popular than Mickey Mouse. His name was Popeye.\n\n\"When I was a kid, just mentioning to a theater manager that I was Max Fleischer's son got me into the movie for free,\" Richard Fleischer, the director of \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\" wrote in \"Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution,\" just published by the University Press of Kentucky.\n\nBut last December, the old Studebaker Building at 1600 Broadway, which had housed the studio, was razed to make way for luxury condominiums. The only trace of the cartoon animation empire that existed there from 1923 to 1938 is the Betty Boop paraphernalia for sale at a string of gift shops on a nearby block of Seventh Avenue. When one thinks of cartoons, the name Walt Disney comes to mind, not Max Fleischer.\n\n\"Disney made his name a trademark synonymous with cartoon animation,\" said Bruce Goldstein, director of repertory programming at Film Forum, which will show 10 Fleischer cartoons tomorrow and Tuesday as part of the theater's \"Paramount Before the Code\" series. \"He owned animation like Starbucks owns coffee, though of course he didn't. Disney was an incredible visionary, but he didn't invent animation.\"\n\nAlthough Disney is credited with releasing the first synchronized sound cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie,\" in 1928, it was Fleischer, collaborating with the inventor Lee DeForest, who had introduced sound four years earlier in several less successful cartoons. That year, 1924, Fleischer along with his brother Dave also created the memorable bouncing ball that skitters along over song lyrics, and in 1917, he invented the Rotoscope, which enables an animator to trace images over film of real people or animals. The device is still in use.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
