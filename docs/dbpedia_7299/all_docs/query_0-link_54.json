        "text": "Cartoon Animator\n\nAlfred Eugster (1909-1997) was an animator whose career started in silent cartoons and ended in TV animation. He worked for producers Pat Sullivan, Max Fleischer, Ub Iwerks, and Walt Disney. Some of the characters he worked on include Felix the Cat, Betty Boop, Krazy Kat, Willie Whopper, Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Dopey, Popeye, Gabby, Little Lulu, Herman and Catnip, Little Audrey and others.\n\nI was fortunate to work with Al on two occasions and knew him for the last 20 years of his life. This web site is dedicated to his career. Much of the material is from Al's own files and was graciously lent to me by his niece, Joan Bell.\n\nYou can read an article I wrote about Al for Animation World Magazine by clicking here.\n\nI've posted photos of Al with other animation people from throughout his career.\n\nI've also posted a partial list of scenes that Al animated.\n\n(This site is under construction. It was formerly located at Geocities, which recently shut down. Over time, I'll be duplicating the site here.)"
