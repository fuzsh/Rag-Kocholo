        "text": "It’s undeniable that animated films and cartoons are dominating the entertainment industry. However, we tend to neglect how much time and effort it takes to bring our favorite characters to life. In the beginning, artists had to spend so much time sketching and turning their ideas into animated films. Some animated works became monuments of famous studios. In this article, we will review the best cartoons with the highest-grossing of all time.\n\n1. The highest-grossing animated movie: Frozen II (2019) - $1.45 Billion\n\nIn 2020, Disney has officially announced, Frozen 2 has revenue of $ 1.45 billion worldwide. The film has officially usurped the throne of Frozen part 1 (with a revenue of $ 1.281 billion) and became the most popular animated film in history. However, the title of king of Frozen 2 is also controversial when many people believe that The Lion King 2019 is also an animated work with a revenue of $ 1.65 billion. However, Disney does not consider it an animated film. but rather the live-action version of the old film.\n\nFrozen 2 continues the adventures of Anna and Elsa as they step out of Arendelle and explore the world around them and find the secrets of the past. In addition to the return of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell, the voice cast also includes Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown, and Evan Rachel Wood.\n\n2. The second-highest-grossing animated movie: Frozen (2013) - $1.28 Billion\n\nThere were quite a few awkward years for Walt Disney Animation Studios as it saw Pixar (a Disney subsidiary) go on to release movies with critical acclaim and universal appeal while failing to reach any kind of major success. However, all of that changed with Frozen as the film is considered the most successful animated film ever by Walt Disney. The film tells the adventure of the courageous princess Anna and her friends on the way to find her sister - the ice queen Elsa, who has plunged the whole country into eternal winter. A beautiful ending for those two girls is a consolation for every girl in the world. Nothing new, but a must-have for all of us. Everyone has to go through loneliness and fear before they learn how to connect with those around them, push boundaries, and surpass themselves.\n\nFrozen has achieved great commercial success: becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time and critically acclaimed with 2 Oscars in the categories of Best Animated Film and Best Soundtrack (\"Let It Go\").\n\nRead more: How Frozen took over the world?\n\n3. Incredibles 2 (2018) - $1.24 Billion\n\nThe modern world is filled with superhero movies from Marvel to DC, but Pixar and Disney always create one of the best-animated superhero movies on the big screen. Pixar’s Incredibles 2 was released 14 years after its first installment, 2004’s The Incredible. But little did anyone expect that the second installment would do so well at the box office, managing to open to an astounding $182 million weekend and ending up accumulating a gross of $1.24 billion around the world over time.\n\nAlthough it is only an animated film for children, Incredibles 2 has always been the ideal model for every hero movie to follow. Incredibles 2 does not overdo the action, everything is really meticulously calculated so that in 2 hours, the story is complete from the characters, motives, and how the main characters gather to defeat the evils.\n\n4. Minions (2015) - $1.16 Billion\n\nKnown as the spin-off of the Despicable Me series, but performed at the box office at a higher level than the movies that originated it.\n\nRight after hitting the theaters in July 2015, Minions became the highest-grossing animated film of all time in 11 markets: Hungary, Indonesia, Lavia, Lithuania, Philippines, Russia, Slovakia, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. The animation by Illumination Entertainment has accumulated a global $1.16 billion at the box office throughout the years. Even when counting every movie in history – animated or otherwise – Minions is still in the Top 20 of highest-grossing films ever.\n\n5. The Lion King (1994) - $1.083 Billion\n\nThe Lion King has received rave reviews for its plot, philosophical content, and music. It is the highest-grossing traditional hand-drawn animated film and is also in the top 5 most famous animated films in history. Released in 1994 (and re-released in 2002 and 2011), The Lion King got its very own live-action adaptation in 2019, starring Donald Glover, Beyoncé, Seth Rogen, and James Earl Jones.\n\nSet in the wild nature of Africa, the film has built an organized society of the animal world. In that society, there are contradictions, disputes and even love like the human world. The main character of The Lion King is the lion Simba, the son of Mufasa, the king who is dominating the wild world there. The Lion King is always remembered for beautiful images, great music, and the spiritual values it brings.\n\nCheck out The 10 Highest-Grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios Movies Ever.\n\n6.
