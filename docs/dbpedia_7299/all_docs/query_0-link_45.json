        "text": "The Dog Without a Name\n\nHe may not have had a name, but the dog featured in the Fleischers' 1926 film My Old Kentucky Home holds a very special place in animation history.\n\nOne of the challenges in early sound film was matching, or synchronizing, a character’s mouth movement with the words they were speaking. Utilizing what was, at the time, cutting-edge technology designed by famed sound pioneer Lee DeForest, the Fleischers released My Old Kentucky Home in June 1926. In that film an unnamed dog speaks the first synchronized words ever spoken by an animated character: Follow the Bouncing Ball and join in everybody! With that one seemingly simple sentence, animation history was made!\n\nThe Many Faces of Bimbo\n\nThe unnamed dog featured in \"My Old Kentucky Home\"\n\nClick here to watch My Old Kentucky Home in its entirety on Critical Commons.\n\nOne of the intriguing things about Bimbo’s early films is how completely his appearance seems to vary from picture to picture. The truth is that the kind of visual consistency we expect today wasn’t considered important in the early days of animation. It likely wasn’t surprising to audiences that a character’s appearance seemed to change from one film to the next. In one cartoon Bimbo might be a white dog, in another film a black dog. Historian Ray Pointer notes that Bimbo’s appearance continued to vary until 1931. The version of Bimbo that appeared in The Herring Murder Case became the standard and best known version of Bimbo: a short, round, black dog who behaved like a human.\n\nBimbo was still the star of the Talkartoons series in August 1930 when the script for Dizzy Dishes called for a female entertainer to play opposite him. This new character, a sexy singer with a bouncy behind, was mostly human but had long floppy dog-like ears. To look at her now, there is no doubt that this flirty singer sporting fashion-forward pin curls and a short black dress would soon be known to the world as Betty Boop. Betty’s popularity caught on like wildfire and soon she was receiving star billing, with her boyfriend Bimbo in a supporting role. By 1932 Betty was so popular that the Talkartoon series was re-named the Betty Boop series.\n\nThe fact that Betty eventually lost her floppy ears and became 100% human while Bimbo remained a dog didn’t seem to bother audiences. Neither did the fact that Betty’s dog-boyfriend wore a sweater and shoes, but no pants. People seemed to accept that Betty lived in a cartoon world where anything was possible!\n\nThis, however, was not a view shared by the drafters of the Motion Picture Production Code. Adopted by the film industry in 1930 (though not fully enforced until 1934), the Code sought to clean up the film industry by censoring work that was deemed to be immoral or overly suggestive. In light of these new guidelines, Betty’s relationship with Bimbo was very questionable indeed, even raising questions of bestiality. Quite simply: Bimbo had to go.\n\nIn the film Is My Palm Read, currently featured in our online theater, the Fleischer animators are clearly taking advantage of what they know is one of their last opportunities to release a film prior to the enforcement of the Production Code rules. You can click here to watch and learn more fun facts about Is My Palm Read in our online Theater.\n\nShortly after, in 1933, Bimbo makes his last film appearance in the film I Heard.\n\nMyron Waldman, the Fleischer Studios Head Animator who created Pudgy, was the Head Animator for most of the Pudgy films and also had the distinction of overseeing more Betty Boop films than any other Studio animator, including this marvelous film: Pudgy Picks a Fight.\n\nWhen he died in 2006 at the age of 97, the Associated Press reported that Myron Waldman was the last surviving Head Animator from Fleischer Studios. After his death, Myron’s son, Steven wrote that:\n\nIt was shortly after midnight Saturday Feb. 4, 2006, my father legendary Fleischer animator Myron Waldman passed away, When my brother Robert arrived, he pointed out dad's final resting position had his right hand as if he was holding a pencil and his left hand flat as if he was holding paper. What made this night even more strange was when Mom told me to inform the nurses station of Dad’s passing, the nurse that came on duty at 11:30 was wearing a Betty Boop/Pudgy scrub outfit. Needless to say I was stunned. I asked her why she was wearing this outfit, she said ”I love Betty Boop especially that little dog,” I replied that the man that drew Betty Boop and created her dog just passed away in the hospice on this floor! She had no idea that Dad was there. She was shocked! It seemed Dad had his last act! RIP. We Miss You!!!!!\n\nFun Facts\n\nDid you know that the animated character Bimbo was named after the Fleischers' real life dog? Bimbo was the name of a rambunctious Belgian Griffon that belonged to Max's son, Dick.\n\nIn this intimate 1932 home movie, Max, wife Essie, daughter Ruth and her husband (Fleischer Studios Head Animator) Seymour Kneitel have all traveled to Twin Lake-Awanee Camp in Brandon, Vermont to visit Max's then 16-year-old son Dick. Of course they brought Dick's dog Bimbo along, as well as Ruth's puppy, Ruffy.\n\nThis rare glimpse into Fleischer family life reveals a relaxed Max, allowing himself to be silly and playful, although even on vacation he dresses like a gentleman in long sleeves, tie, and suspenders. This is very true to form. Max loved work and so he rarely vacationed and was rarely seen dressed in the kind of casual summer clothes that everyone else seems to be wearing. There's even a moment, early on in this clip, in which his entire family seems to be trying to get him out of his office clothes.\n\nAnimator Seymour Kneitel could never resist decorating a mailing envelope, like this one to his wife Ruth.\n\nBetty Boop helps an adorable pup get on the right foot\n\nIn January 2015 this adorable pup, missing one of her back paws, was found wandering the streets of Chicago and taken to PAWS Chicago, a no-kill animal shelter, where she was given the name Betty Boop.\n\nLater that month, Chicago's FOX 32 shared Betty's story and invited its viewers to donate towards the cost of providing Betty with a prosthetic paw - and that's where we come in.\n\nWhen we at Fleischer Studios heard this story, we knew exactly what Betty Boop herself would do; and so that's exactly what we did! We reached out to PAWS and donated the entire cost for the puppy's prosthesis."
