James H. "Shamus" Culhane was an American animator, film director, and film producer.

While at the Disney studio, he discovered, while working on a sequence with Pluto and a crab on Hawaiian Holiday, an animation method that involved stewing for multiple days, before animating the entire rough sketches, straight-ahead, without invoking the left side of the brain. He was an animator on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, animating arguably the most well-known sequence in the film, the animation of the dwarfs marching home singing "Heigh Ho". The scene took Culhane and his assistants six months to complete.

Culhane left Disney in 1939 to work at the Fleischer Studio in Miami, Florida. Prior to leaving, he was assigned to animate a sequence with Honest John in Pinocchio, which ended up being done by his assistant Norman Tate.

At his death on February 2, 1996, Culhane was survived by second wife, the former Juana Hegarty, and by two sons from his first marriage to Maxine Marx (the daughter of Chico Marx) which ended in divorce: Brian Culhane of Seattle and Kevin Marx Culhane of Portland, Oregon.
