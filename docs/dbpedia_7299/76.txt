James Culhane worked for a number of American animation studios, including Fleischer Studios, the Ub Iwerks studio, Walt Disney Productions, and the Walter Lantz studio. He was the only animator to work on all of the first four animated feature length cartoons: Disney's Snow White and Pinocchio; Max Fleischer's Gulliver's Travels, and Dave Fleischer's Mr. Bug Goes to Town. James Culhane was a lead animator on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, animating the Dwarfs marching home singing High Ho. Later in his career, he worked briefly in Chuck Jones's unit at Warner Bros, before moving on to being a director for Walter Lantz, where he produced Woody Woodpecker's 1944 classic, The Barber of Seville, the cartoon famous for one of the first uses of fast cutting. James Culhane also is credited in creating the animated characters as Krazy Kat, Betty Boop, Popeye, Pluto, and Woody Woodpecker.
