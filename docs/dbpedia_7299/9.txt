James "Shamus" Culhane was the only animator to work on all of the first four animated feature-length Walt Disney cartoons. In a career that spanned six decades, he worked for 18 cartoon studios, including his own. In the mid-'0s his early hand-drawn animation was combined with computer animation for Disney films, including Aladdin (1992), Der König der Löwen (1994), and Pocahontas (1995).
