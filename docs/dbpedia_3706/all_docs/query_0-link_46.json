Over the course of over five decades, Firebird has stayed true to that founding principle, as more than fifty events are offered during the April to October drag racing season.\n\nFirebird has been continuously operated by the New family and its staff since its inception. We are proud to be aligned with and a member track of the National Hot Rod Association. All of us at Firebird are dedicated to providing a first-class facility for racers and fans of all ages to enjoy drag racing at its finest. It’s a rather simple notion, but we like to call it the “Firebird Experience”.\n\nWe look forward to having you and your family join us this season."
