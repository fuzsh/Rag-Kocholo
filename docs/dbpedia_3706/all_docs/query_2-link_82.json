        "text": "THERE will be no Triple Crown this year; once again a Kentucky Derby winner was thwarted in the shorter, faster Preakness Stakes. But if you could have a day and a major race in which everyone won, yesterday was it.\n\nAfleet Alex, who finished third in the Kentucky Derby, stumbled and nearly fell at the top of the stretch, yet somehow he regained his balance and won the race.\n\nScrappy T, a long shot, finished second. And Giacomo, ridiculed and disrespected by so-called experts despite his victory in the Kentucky Derby, proved he belonged with the elite. He ran a solid race and finished third.\n\nJerry Moss, who owns Giacomo with his wife, Ann, stood by his stable after the race and put in perspective the whirl of events of the past two weeks. Giacomo came from nowhere to win the Kentucky Derby at 50-1 odds, Moss celebrated his 70th birthday a day later and yesterday Giacomo finished in the money.\n\n\"I loved the way he ran,\" Moss said. \"He certainly showed that he definitely belongs here at the top of this group. To win at the Derby and finish third at the Preakness is pretty nice stuff.\"\n\nGiacomo's next stop will probably be the Belmont, a fantastic homecoming for Moss, who was born in the South Bronx, a rematch with Afleet Alex in his hometown.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
