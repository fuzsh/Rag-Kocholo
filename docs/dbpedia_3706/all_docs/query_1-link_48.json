        "text": "Try to name a CD that you loved from first listen. Better yet, have it be from a little-known band from Long Island that is on the rise. Don’t forget that the members of the band have to be your age too. Give up? Then it’s a safe bet Merrick, New York’s Brand New is not in your rotation.\n\nBrand New take their musical influences from classics such as, The Beach Boys and The Cars and they add new school punk sounds of New Found Glory and Midtown.\n\nTopped emotional lyrics like Saves The Day, Brand New is definitely not your 14-year-old brother’s Blink-182 pop-punk band.\n\nWith last year’s “Your Favorite Weapon” on Triple Crown Records, Brand New introduced themselves to an over-saturated pop-punk genre as something, brand new.\n\nTheir extremely heartfelt lyrics, crunching guitar riffs, and melodic vocal harmonies show off the songwriting talent that few 18 to 20-year-olds have. Singer Jesse Lacey, guitarist Vincent Accardi, bassist Garrett Tierney and drummer Brian Lane collaborate into a solid fusion of hard-rocking emotion.\n\n“Your Favorite Weapon” speaks to the listener as if it were the tell-all story of teenage angst and heartbreak. “Jude Law and a Semester Abroad” contains lyrics, “So here’s a present to let you know I still exist / I hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his lips.” Any broken-hearted guy or girl can relate to an emo song like this. Brutally honest lyrics are what attract so many people to bands like Brand New.\n\n“Failure by Design” is upbeat and reminiscent of Good Charlotte-like punk infused hip-hop. “Logan To Government Center” is the band’s letter to no one in particular and apologizes for messing up a relationship before it actually breaks apart.\n\nOne of the best songs on “Favorite Weapon” is “Seventy Times 7.” This song shows the band’s spiritual side while still showing displeasure with all who trouble them. An example of their lyrics, “I’ve seen more spine on jellyfish / and I’ve seen more guts in 11-year-old kids / Have another drink and drive yourself home / I hope there’s ice on all the roads,” sings Lacey.\n\nBrand New mixes punk-rock and emo-core styles in a unique style is what will make mainstay for fans of bands from Weezer to Jimmy Eat World. Do not expect them to be like any of those bands. Expect something Brand New.\n\nOn April 19, Brand New plays The Skate and Surf Fest in Asbury Park, NJ. The festival lasts the whole weekend and among many, they share the bill with other bands such as, Further Seems Forever, The Get Up Kids, Thursday, Catch 22, Hot Rod Circuit, Midtown, River City Rebels and New Found Glory. Tickets are available from Ticketmaster outlets."
