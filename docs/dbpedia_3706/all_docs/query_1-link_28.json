IF YOU ORDER OTHER ITEMS ALONG WITH THIS ALBUM, THE ENTIRE ORDER WILL NOT SHIP UNTIL THE ESTIMATED SHIP DATE.\n\nFor International Orders, please order from: www.friendclubrecords.com\n\nThe debut release from the Massachusetts post-hardcore/emo outfit Orange Island. Orange Island were once a household name in the scene after numerous US tours and releases on Iodine, Triple Crown Records, and Rise Records. While never fitting neatly into a box when it came to genres, Orange Island brought influences from post-hardcore, emo, and punk, while maintaining a unique sound that was well ahead of its time. Shape of Calling is an upbeat album full of sing-along anthems, but the lyrics focus on loss, regret, and struggling with alcoholism in a small depressed suburban mill town. Produced by Michael Poorman of Hot Rod Circuit. Fully remastered now for its 20-year anniversary by Jack Shirley at Atomic Garden and featuring the bonus cover of Crimson and Clover.\n\nA split release with Friend Club Records, limited to only 100 copies on an orange cassette.\n\n“Sounding like a drop-D tuned Saves the Day or Jawbreaker, this Clinton, MA, quartet fuses gut-quaking East coast post-hardcore rhythms, à la Quicksand, dual guitar interplay and intelligent and earnest lyrics.” - EXCLAIM\n\nTRACK LIST\n\n01. When it Was New Years Eve Three Times a Week\n\n02. Always Goodbye\n\n03. The Pledge of Allegiance\n\n04. Eyes Closed to Motion\n\n05. Making Her (Walk the Plank)\n\n06. Personal Vendetta\n\n07. Crimson and Clover\n\nALBUM CREDITS\n\nOrange Island was: Dave Gorman, Chuck Young, Brendan Dickhaut, and David Chouinard\n\nProduced by: Michael Poorman at The Church Studio in Boston, MA 2001\n\nMastered by: Colin Decker at M-Works, Cambridge, MA\n\nRe-Mastered by: Jack Shirley at Atomic Garden, July 2021\n\nArtwork by: J. Bannon"
