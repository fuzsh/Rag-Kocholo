        "text": "RECKLESS RECOMMENDED:\n\n>> KIM GORDON – The Collective LP/CD (Matador) *Double-sided poster available w/ purchase while supplies last\n\nThe Collective is another excellent addition to KIM GORDON’s post- SONIC YOUTH catalog, signaling a bold new reinvention of her sound in the 4th decade of her career. It’s a Blistering set of molten soundscapes crafted from SoundCloud trap beats, blown-out bass, immersive waves of distortion, and Kim’s iconic NYC drawl – imagine a classic Youth jam like “Kool Thing” if it were dipped in lava, fossilized and then Electrified by lightning. There are nods to her heroes in SUICIDE & THROBBING GRISTLE, old peers ROYAL TRUX & MBV, artists like M.I.A. & SLEIGH BELLS who were inspired by SY, and some genuinely left-field influences like DEATH GRIPS, CHARLI XCX & even PLAYBOI CARTI, if you can Believe it. This is Yet again a truly Essential release from one of the coolest to ever do it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> TOMATO FLOWER – No LP (Ramp Local) *Indie Exclusive Multi-Color Vinyl\n\nBaltimore’s TOMATO FLOWER releases their full length debut, a textured, deftly played mix of psych-pop, folk and emo. Little touches of ANIMAL COLLECTIVE, some PALM mathyness, and heart-on-your-sleeve CLOUD NOTHINGS guitar rock. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> TORREY – Torrey LP (Slumberland) *White Vinyl\n\nSecond album (and first on Slumberland) for Bay Area dream pop/ shoegaze outfit TORREY, putting together guitar-driven, melody-forward pop compositions that strike a balance between 90s alt-rock (think LUSH, DROP NINETEENS) and brighter, more contemporary indie (ALVVAYS, a little JAPANESE BREAKFAST).

Similar to another Boston band at the time, THE SWIRLIES, DROP NINETEENS took the Brit-Pop/shoegaze sound of bands like SLOWDIVE, MY BLOODY VALENTINE & CATHERINE WHEEL and added their own twist to it. Their debut album has been impossible to find for years & we’re really excited to be able to carry it once again. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> RUTH GOLLER – SKYLLUMINA LP/CD (International Anthem)\n\nLondon based composer & bassist RUTH GOLLER has worked a lot with Int’l Anthem mainstays ALABASTER DePLUME and BEX BURCH, and her solo work embraces the open improvization of her comrades with ethereal pop vocals that remind us a bit of ANA ROXANNE. Features support from BURCH and THE SMILE’s Tom Skinner. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> JAHARI MASSAMBA UNIT – YHWH is LOVE LP (Law Of Rhythm) *KARRIEM RIGGINS and MADLIB\n\nThe duo of MADLIB and KARRIEM RIGGINS return as JAHARI MASSAMBA UNIT for a record that blends spiritual jazz, rare groove and instrumental hip-hop. While the other instruments are handled by MADLIB, it’s RIGGINS on the drums that stays front and center, at once nimble and powerful, all recorded to perfection. Fans of MADLIB’s jazz project YESTERDAYS NEW QUINTET as well as Int’l Anthem artists like MAKAYA McCRAVEN and JUNIUS PAUL will find a lot to love here. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> VARIOUS – Disco Not Disco 3LP (Strut) *25th Anniversary – Yellow Vinyl\n\nAn absolutely essential disco compilation gets a much needed anniversary version. Disco Not Disco collects some of the best leftfield disco and early dance cuts from the post-Studio 54 era in downtown Manhattan. Featuring tracks from LIQUID LIQUID, ARTHUR RUSSELL, DON CHERRY, WAS (NOT WAS), YOKO ONO and DJ NICKY SIANO, this one is now finally back in stock after a limited Record Store Day run. A MUST GRAB!

Her sonic palatte is rooted in world of dance music, and these tracks end up as skillful forays into trip-hop, drum’n’bass and hip-house. But at the forefront is DE CASIER’s voice, never aggressive but always expressive in wrapping tight, hooky melodies around these beats. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> HURRAY FOR THE RIFF RAFF – The Past is Still Alive LP/CD (Nonesuch) *Translucent “Orange Crush” Vinyl\n\nAfter some thrilling detours into other genres on the defiantly radical Life on Earth, Alynda Segarra returns to their vintage roots-rock sound for this latest entry under the HURRAY FOR THE RIFF RAFF banner. Alynda sounds laser-focused after a few years in the wilderness, their voice clear as a bell over chiming guitars and crisp drums. This is powerful folk music of the first order, informed by struggle and pulsing with life. Deftly produced by Brad Cook (WAXAHATCHEE, BON IVER) and featuring CONOR OBERST, HAND HABITS’ Meg Duffy, ANJIMILE and SG GOODMAN. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> MGMT – Loss of Life LP/CD (Mom + Pop) *Black or Indie Exclusive “Blue Jay” Vinyl\n\nThe mighty psych-pop duo MGMT return for their fifth studio album, and Loss of Life (“lol?”) is a little harder to pin down compared to the icy synths of their previous effort Little Dark Age or the technicolor party rock of their debut Oracular Spectacular. The sonic influence here ranges from vintage chillwave to stuffed-up 70s glam to synth punk with a collage-like pace. Great, energetic stuff from a band that’s been going at it for nearly twenty years. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> MARY TIMONY – Untame the Tiger LP/CD (Merge) *Black or Peak Vinyl Edition Neon Pink Vinyl\n\nFor her first solo album in 15 years (after stints with the supergroup WILD FLAG and fronting the kickass power trio EX HEX), ex-HELIUM singer/songwriter/axe wielder MARY TIMONY looks inward for a set of intricate, tightly wound folk-rock tunes. It trades in her vintage face-melting riffage & wild energy for a different kind of rawness, fresh as an open wound. Fans of RICHARD & LINDA THOMPSON and FAIRPORT CONVENTION (whose drummer Dave Mattacks very coolly guests here) will absolutely adore this record. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> NEIL YOUNG – Dume 2LP (Reprise) *Indie Exclusive Ltd. Edition w/ art print & lyric poster\n\nDume was originally released as part of the Archives Vol. II box set in 2020. The title comes from Pointe Dume, a promontory off the coast of Malibu where Neil & CRAZY HORSE wrote & recorded the songs. The sessions would be whittled down to form Zuma, one of Neil & the band’s greatest achievements. Now expanded with outtakes & alternate mixes, Dume is a new look at the Zuma era with 7 songs that have never been on vinyl before. This is as good as these Archives releases get in our opinion.

CHIU made a stop into the Vintage Synthesizer Museum in Highland Park, LA, with an open-ended plan to record, and over the course of two days built, programmed and sequenced the pieces that would become this record. The result is a great display of intuitive songwriting, ranging from RAYMOND SCOTT-like vintage miniatures to grand kosmiche in the mold of HARMONIA. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> CODEINE/ BEDHEAD – Atmosphere b/w Disorder 7″ (Numero Group) *Color or “Ozone Blue” Vinyl\n\nTwo of the legit first-wave slow core bands team up for a split 7″ with both bands covering two of your favorite JOY DIVISION songs. Hook it into our veins… RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> LAURA JANE GRACE – Hole in My Head LP/CD/CS (Polyvinyl) *Hot Pink Vinyl ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nThe mighty LJG is back at it with another record in what’s shaping up to be a fruitful solo discography. It continues the trend started on her pandemic-era releases of paring down the trademark AGAINST ME bombast to its bare essentials, resulting in really sharp lo-fi punk & folk (& even rockabilly & country) tracks that are as raw and bracingly immediate as any she’s ever made. Chicago’s gonna miss you, Laura! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> IDLES – Tangk LP/CD (Partisan) *Black, Indie Exclusive Translucent Pink Vinyl, or Deluxe Edition Ltd. Yellow Vinyl w/ holographic sleeve & book\n\nBristol’s IDLES enlist the help of RADIOHEAD producer Nigel Godrich (as well as KENNY BEATS and James Murphy of LCD SOUNDSYSTEM) for a record that expands out of punk onto the dancefloor while still retaining the group’s signature cockney aggression. On Partisan and RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> CHELSEA WOLFE – She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She LP/CD (Loma Vista) *Black or Indie Exclusive Transparent Blue Vinyl\n\nLongtime Reckless fave CHELSEA WOLFE returns with her 1st solo album in almost 5 years (though she’s devoted time to great side projects with CONVERGE and MRS. PISS and scoring the film X). This new joint is produced by DAVE SITEK, who draws out the industrial, electro, and trip-hop influences that have always creeped at the edges of Chelsea’s music. The chilly electronics & buzzing rhythms marry extremely well with Chelsea’s voice, as lush & powerful as ever. Fans of PORTISHEAD, BJÖRK, and TRICKY will find lots to love here & hopefully feel compelled to take a deeper dive into Chelsea’s eclectic catalog as a result.

Finally, one of the greatest heavy progressive albums of ALL TIME (yes, that’s right) has been OFFICIALLY reissued by Seelie Court. This major slab features the heavy psychedelic guitar work of the legendary MARTIN WEAVER (ex-WICKED LADY), guitarist/vocalist STEVE GILES, bassist RON JOHNSON and drummer CLIVE THORNEYCROFT. This is a fantastic psychedelic boogie album with a sinister bent and a wicked sense of humor. We couldn’t be more overjoyed that this album can be heard again. GET IT WHILE YOU CAN! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> DUCKS LTD. – Harm’s Way LP (Carpark) *Ltd. Color Vinyl\n\nDUCKS LTD. – a Toronto-based duo with roots in the Australia, UK, and Midwest music scenes – are back with this follow-up to their assured 2021 debut LP. On Harm’s Way they nail the classic CARS/STROKES trick of making every instrument part a hook – each chiming riff, bassline, drum fill, and rich vocal harmony are pure, sticky ear candy. And like all the best jangle/power pop, repeated listens reveal layers of aching melancholy beneath the sugary surface. PLUS, awesomely, this record was made in Chicago and features members of RATBOYS, DEHD, FINOM and MOONTYPE. Really good stuff – HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> BRITTANY HOWARD – What Now LP (Island) *Translucent Yellow Vinyl\n\nBRITTANY HOWARD returns with her second solo LP removed from ALABAMA SHAKES. For What Now, she taps into the same wells of influence that BEYONCÉ did for Renaissance – glitchy funk, warm R&B, and euphoric house – for a set of songs equally as resilient. Throughout she proves her bonafides not just as a powerhouse singer but also as a truly incredible guitarist – one of our best living, no doubt about it. This is just one more brilliant release from an artist who is building up an absolutely towering body of work… HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> HELADO NEGRO – Phasor LP/CD (4AD)\n\nRoberto Carlos Lange follows up his expansive double LP Far In with a tighter collection of songs that draw influence from atmospheric kosmiche ambience (a direct reference to PAULINE OLIVEROS in the album’s opener) and tight, prominent grooves. For fans of SAULT, CATE LE BON & even STEREOLAB. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> DAVID NANCE & MOWED SOUND – David Nance & Mowed Sound LP (Third Man) *Black or Color Vinyl\n\nHighly prolific journeyman songwriter/guitarist DAVID NANCE has banded together a Crazy Horse of his own in MOWED SOUND for this S/T’d “debut” LP, his first on JACK WHITE’s Third Man Records. Together they conjure up a set full of freewheeling boogie, cosmic Americana & greased-up psych with motorik grooves that throb & pulse hypnotically, evoking ghosts of Afrobeat, raga & CAN as much as classic ZZ TOP or ALLMAN BROS. A thrilling listen that will make you wanna trade in your wings on some wheels, hit the pavement & find some desert to go flying by… RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> STEVE ROACH – Structures From Silence LP (Projekt) *2024 Remaster – Color Vinyl\n\nMuch appreciated reissue of this ambient/new age classic by Steve Roach. Originally released in 1984, this album is now regarded as one of the most important releases in the ambient genre & it sounds incredibly modern today as many artists now are exploring similar territory that Roach did over 30 years ago. ENO, VANGELIS & SCHULZE are solid comparisons but Roach was pushing his synth textures into a realm that still sounds fresh. Fans of the previously mentioned ambient giants as well as contemporaries like ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER & Steve Hauschildt will want to check this out. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> SONIC YOUTH – Walls Have Ears LP/CD (Goofin’) *Black or Ltd. Silver Vinyl\n\nWalls Have Ears was originally released as an artist sanctioned “unofficial” release in 1986 & has been highly sought after ever since. The legendary LP featured material taken from 3 UK shows spliced together with sound collage & experimental sections that set it above your typical bootleg release. The lo-fi recordings really put you in the room with the band & the Bad Moon Rising heavy tracklist mixed with in-process/pre Evol tunes hits about as hard as you’d hope.

Color Vinyl\n\nSophomore release from DEL THE FUNKY HOMOSAPIEN, & 30 years later it’s become a classic. Del’s first LP was put together with some help from his cousin, ICE CUBE & it should be no surprise to listeners that this second record, produced primarily by Hiero crew members Domino, A-Plus, Casual & Del himself, is a bit Jazzier & less G-Funky. Del’s got a great ear, a great pen, & an incredible voice, & if you don’t have a copy of this recOrd, you should grab this anniversary release before it’s too late. Promise you it’s worth it. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> ARIEL KALMA, JEREMIAH CHIU & MARTA SOFIA HONER – The Closest Thing to Silence LP/CD (International Anthem)\n\nThis collaboration between French-Australian new age luminary ARIEL KALMA and Int’l Anthem experimentalists JEREMIAH CHIU and MARTA SOFIA HONER was born at first from a meeting on BBC Radio’s “Late Junction” series, where the trio would exchange and work on fragments of each other’s original music. The initial twenty minute broadcast inspired them to expand their collaboration into a full length album, weaving together classical minimalism, fourth world rhythmic jazz, drone & sound design into a captivating collage. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> THE LAST DINNER PARTY – Prelude to Ecstasy LP (Island) *”Midnight” Black Vinyl w/ poster\n\nUK five-piece THE LAST DINNER PARTY have built up an impressive amount of hype in their short time as a band, cracking the charts overseas and opening for the STONES all without a full-length to their name. Now Prelude to Ecstasy is finally here and, frankly, it rules. Bombastic & theatrical alt-pop in the vein of SPARKS or KATE BUSH with hooks for days, a really inventive rhythm section, and some serious guitar heroics that also line this up neatly with ST VINCENT or T.REX. Produced by JAMES FORD (JESSIE WARE, ARCTIC MONKEYS) and HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> METH. – Shame LP/CD (Prostethic) *White Vinyl ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nChicago “experimental heavy band” METH. are back with another heater, their second on Prosthetic Records. Shame’s seven tracks assault the senses relentlessly with pummeling tempos & harsh sonics that, in concert with the vox & lyrics, offer a stark, harrowing glimpse into cycles of addiction, trauma & depression. They channel many of the same influences as peers like CHAT PILE and PRIMITIVE MAN – i.e. if you’re a fan of GODFLESH, THE JESUS LIZARD, SWANS BIG BLACK/SHELLAC etc, you’ll find lots to love here and you’ll relish the challenging listen.

BENNY THE BUTCHER has an uncomplicated flow & style that’s never out of place. That’s not to say he’s not a great lyricist, that’s to say that sometimes the gymnastics aren’t the draw. See, what Benny does is put together rhymes, flows, & beats for a complete experience, you can vibe to it, but the drums knock hard enough to get people on the dance floor. You can put it on at the party, but your writer-ly friends can rock with the penmanship. It’s a one-stop shop for any fan of good Hip-Hop music. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> FUTURE ISLANDS – People Who Aren’t There Anymore LP (4AD) *Black or Indie Exclusive Clear Vinyl\n\n7th full length album for Baltimore indie mainstays FUTURE ISLANDS, rooting themselves again in their trademark synth-pop sound influenced instrumentally by NEW ORDER and THE HUMAN LEAGUE with Sam Herring’s recognizable bellow floating above. On 4AD and RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> ZANDER RAYMOND – To Have Several Lives LP (Sound As Language) *Remastered – Ltd. Green Vinyl ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nBeautiful ambient record from Chicago’s ZANDER RAYMOND that was originally released in 2022. To Have Several Lives centers on improvisation, making use of modular synths and samples to construct a non-linear sound design. The result is a beautiful, often surprising set of vignettes, sketching outer worlds and inviting Inner calm. Now newly remastered for vinyl, this comes HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> TY SEGALL – Three Bells 2LP/CD/CS (Drag City)\n\nThree Bells might be the most sprawling record TY SEGALL has ever made, and if you’re familiar with Ty’s work then you know that’s no small feat. Many of these tracks aren’t “songs” so much as they are densely layered suites: they start at one point before morphing over several minutes into an entirely different beast, and then they build to a mighty crescendo before moving on to the next cycle. If you imagine the Abbey Road medley made album length then you’re not far off, but you’d also have to factor in Ty’s recent knack for channeling as many genres as possible – garage & psych of course, but also new wave, freak folk, knotty funk, art punk, and the most abrasive bursts of interstitial noise this side of NIN’s Downward Spiral. The sprawl is tied together by a massive sense of groove and an almost jazzy swing to the drums (played by Ty himself), lending the set a swagger that few of Ty’s contemporaries can rival. It’s always a thrill when a songwriter as brilliant as Ty challenges himself & his own conventions, and even more so when they stick the landing. Produced with COOPER CRAIN (✶ ✶ ✶ ✶), on DRAG CITY and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> THE SMILE – Wall of Eyes LP (XL) *Black or Indie Exclusive Blue Vinyl w/ limited listening party swag available with purchase while supplies last\n\nThis sophomore full length from JONNY GREENWOOD, THOM YORKE and TOM SKINNER drapes their unconventional rhythms in a gauzy, dream-pop atmosphere, at times channeling orchestral, spiritual jazz with textured string & brass arrangements and swirling cosmic synth. Unlike many of the later RADIOHEAD efforts that appear as immaculate studio soundcraft, Wall of Eyes seems instead to embrace disharmony. The ideas are frenetic and loose, and neither YORKE nor GREENWOOD have been as energetic as songwriters in years as they are here. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> SPRINTS – Letter to Self LP (City Slang) *Ltd. Red Vinyl\n\nYoung Irish band SPRINTS drop their debut full-length on City Slang, building off the buzz of a pair of great EPs & a reputation for a ferocious live show. They level up from their road-tested garage-punk sound with a heavy grunge feel that places this in the same continuum as classic HOLE & PJ HARVEY, even as the tempos amp up a la prime MOTÖRHEAD. Band leader Karla Chubb’s world-beating voice & lyrics are the icing on the cake, tying the songs together to make a piece of defiantly cathartic art. Instantly one of the best rock albums of 2024. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> VARIOUS – Sonic Transmutations 8LP Box (Clone)\n\nSonic Transmutations is an extended compilation album celebrating over three decades of Clone Records. Marking the 31 years – which is coincidentally the national Dutch telephone code – the 8×12 inch box set draws together veteran talent and emerging iconoclasts, transmitting a frequency rooted the imprint’s signature blend of essential dance music while journeying off into territories unknown.

Red Vinyl – One of Reckless’ Best of 2023 staff picks now in stock!\n\nAfter a relatively quiet couple of years, DANNY BROWN got busy in 2023, as Quaranta followed his avant-goofball collaboration with JPEGMAFIA on Scaring the Hoes. Quaranta was written during that interim, and showcases BROWN’s more introspective, reflective side. Lots of jazzy, proggy leftfield production on this – partially helped by THE ALCHEMIST – with features by KASSA OVERALL, MIKE and BRUISER WOLF. EXCELLENT and RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> 90 DAY MEN – We Blame Chicago 5LP Box (Numero Group) *Black or Ltd. “Super Illuminary” Vinyl ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nThe late 90s/early 00s was a brilliant time in Chicago music history & one of the finest bands from that era was 90 DAY MEN. They got their start in the St. Louis punk & emo scene then relocated to Chicago. Their sound was a mix of Touch & Go style post-punk & WIRE/BAUHAUS influenced art rock with a solid but fluid rhythm section & towards the end the addition of the Fender Rhodes which gave them a really unique sound. Guitarist/vocalist Brian Case went on form DISAPPEARS and FACS as well as releasing multiple solo records; Bassist Rob Lowe formed LICHENS & worked with Johann Johannsson on the Arrival soundtrack & scored the Candyman remake; and drummer Cayce Key played in BLOODIEST. Their 3 albums are included in this box along with some outtakes & Peel Sessions & another Chicago legend in his own right Tim Kinsella wrote the liner notes. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> LOU REED – Hudson River Wind Meditations 2LP (Light In The Attic) *Remastered – Black or Coke Bottle Color Vinyl\n\nOriginally released in 2007 on a small indie label, LOU REED’s final solo album is available again thanks to Light in the Attic. This music wasn’t originally intended for public release – instead Reed composed these pieces as background music for his meditation, yoga & tai chi practice. The opening piece is nearly 30 minutes of deep, circulating synthesizer tones that sound like a machine breathing, maybe a deep space traveler in cryosleep. Some of the other pieces are darker, almost sine wave & tone experiments that would fit in well on a COIL album. We’re really glad to be able to stock this in our racks. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> WINDY & CARL – Unreleased Home Recordings 1992-1995 3CD Box (Windy & Carl) *#’d Ltd. Edition w/ signed insert\n\nOriginally released in 2020, this collection of home recordings from 1992-1995 is available again in a nifty box with a signed insert! Beautiful dream pop & drone from one of our all-time favorite duos. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> HIROSHI YOSHIMURA – Surround LP (Temporal Drift) *Remastered – Black or LITA Exclusive Blue Vinyl\n\nThis is the first ever reissue of the wonderful 1986 album Surround by HIROSHI YOSHIMURA. The master of Japanese environmental music was selected by an architect to compose music to compliment his company’s new living spaces. Similar to Yoshimura’s other environmental classics inspired by ENO’s ambient works, the music is a meant as a companion to the space where it’s being played or heard. Percussive & melodic vibraphone-esque sounds & mellow digital synth drones with Yoshimura’s expert use of reverb & space. Fans of his other great work, Eno, STEVE ROACH & MIDORI TAKADA should pick this up for sure.
