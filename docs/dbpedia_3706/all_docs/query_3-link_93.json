        "text": "The article also failed to mention Uncle John Westbrook, the black neighbor who taught Carl a lot about guitar playing (and sold the family Carl's first guitar), particularly the bluesy side of Carl's sound, and of course the Blind Lemon Jefferson song \"Matchbox\" - one of Carl's classic numbers. Since Carl is certainly one of the most important influences on the rockabilly sound and rock and roll, this seems particularly significant to me. Black musicians directly influenced Bob Wills, Jimmie Rodgers, Bill Monroe, Hank Williams, Carl Perkins, Billy Lee Riley, and many others.\n\nIn turn Carl has influenced countless others, including yours truly. A new subscriber to BSN, who lives near the Perkins family in Jackson, Tennessee, has told me he was present at Carl's last recording session, at which Perkins was recording songs for a John Fogerty tribute. No doubt there will be another Carl Perkins tribute disc (\"Go Cat Go\" should qualify, with the number of luminaries joining Carl), and when it comes out we'll see a list of stars who have been inspired by Carl's music. In my own case, I was given the Beatles album \"Beatles '65\" (called \"Beatles For Sale\" in U.K. release) for Christmas that year. Having been excited by Beatle records like \"Twist And Shout\", \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"She Loves You\" and \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\", I was kinda disappointed by the general down tone of virtually all the original Beatle songs on that album. \"Baby's In Black\", \"I'll Follow The Sun\", and especially \"I'm A Loser\" made me realize that mega fame had a horrible price for these interesting guys. On that last song, I had to assume John Lennon (I was quite sure that since he sung it, he'd written it in the main) was serious, not just trying to write a cute pop song. It certainly made me have second thoughts about becoming a rock star, probably enough to stop it from happening if there had ever been any danger.\n\nBut the album's redeeming feature was the two Carl Perkins songs and the Chuck Berry classic \"Rock And Roll Music\". These songs were steeped in the groove and sense of fun that was what rock and roll meant to me, and still does. I've grown to appreciate those other songs on the LP too, but the classics they covered are still my favorites. By that time Carl's career had pretty much foundered here in the states, but his tour of England showed him that there was still an audience for his unique and wonderful hillbilly rock and roll.\n\nI watched (and taped) the TNN special \"The Life And Times Of Carl Perkins\", and interstingly, though this is supposed to be a country music network, only Carl's rockabilly and rock and roll are featured, though a couple of his hillbilly sides were mentioned.\n\nTo me, Carl's songs like \"Turn Around\" and \"Sure To Fall\" are just as good as everything else he did. And I think anyone who doesn't like Carl's hillbilly side doesn't understand either the man or his music. I was especially happy when Ricky Skaggs asked for \"Turn Around\" during Carl's appearance on the \"Monday Night Concerts\" show. Carl said it was the first song he ever performed on that Ryman Auditorium Stage, during his first Grand Old Ory performance. My assignment for this article was to discuss Carl's influence on other artists. One thing Howard DeWitt failed to mention in his article is the fact that Carl is the one who suggested that Jerry Lee Lewis try standing up to play the piano. He probably should have bought stock in a piano stool manufacturer the next day. Carl joked about how he and Johnny Cash thought maybe he should have kept his mouth shut - and certainly Lewis' meteoric rise after that consumed Sun Records' meager resources for promotion, forcing not just them but also Billy Lee Riley and others to jump ship to other labels.\n\nBut Carl's perspective returned when he kicked booze one cathartic day in California. He had a loving wife, kids who grew up to follow in their father's footsteps and even play with him in his band, and the ability to make a living doing what he enjoyed the most - playing and writing music. He said on the TNN special that he never would have wanted to trade places with Elvis Presley, so perhaps folks should stop emphasizing the notion that he lived his life in Presley's shadow. Lee Cotten's BSN article tended to read like a catalogue of Perkins' commercial failures, when I'd have rather it were a tribute to Carl's artistic successes, which are many.\n\nSince Johnny Cash suggested Carl write \"Blue Suede Shoes\", perhaps it's appropriate that Carl never got credit for writing the music for \"A Boy Named Sue\" on the spot just before the famous \"Live At Folsom Prison\" show. But it's something that we should all know just the same. Cash did hire Carl to replace Luther Perkins after Luther died, and let Carl sing some of his hits in the show, and he cut Carl's wonderful \"Daddy Sang Bass\". Once again Carl and Luther were brothers of the road, but in a different way.\n\nI certainly miss Carl already, though I've been listening to all the recordings I have, especially the fabulous Bear Family box set. I wonder, does anybody know where I could obtain Carl's Universal title \"Born To Rock\" on CD? The borrowed cassette I had disappeared when it went to be halftoned for the issue we reviewed it in. Special thanks to David Dennard (of Dragon Street Records), who sent me these Big D Jamboree photos a few months ago. I wish I'd gotten it together to run them while Carl was still living. I'm told the sparkly blue shoe was a gift from Sam Phillips. But Carl Perkins' music was the real gift, and I'll always treasure it. -Marc Bristol\n\nVarious Artists / Girls Gone Rockin': 75 Fabulous Femme Rockers / Fantastic Voyage FVTD 054\n\nTop 2010 album sales, as reported in the June issue of BILLBOARD, place nine women among the 20 highest chart positions. These ladies are: Sade, Lady Gaga, Kesha, Susan Boyle, Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Monica, Rihanna, and Carrie Underwood. This narrow sales snapshot omits several other highly successful contemporary female recording artists such as Janet Jackson, Miley Cyrus, Mariah Carey, Cyndi Lauper, and Madonna. Girls Gone Rockin' explores the 1950s audio roots of women's rise to fame and fortune in the commercial recording industry. Obviously, some very talented early black female artists like Alberta Hunter, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Ida Cox, Mamie Smith, and Memphis Minnie paid their dues during the segregated era of disc distribution and sales. Fortunately, the mid-century musical world exploded with a diversity of opportunities for female artists, both black and white. Girls Gone Rockin' isn't saluting everyone, though. It ignores such pop stars and big band performers as Teresa Brewer, Doris Day, Dinah Washington, Rosemary Clooney, Kay Starr, Julie London, Georgia Gibbs, Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, Margaret Whiting, Jo Stafford, Peggy Lee, Della Reese, and Ella Fitzgerald. Instead, the compilation lionizes those rockin' female rebels who repeatedly put the audio pedal to the metal with screaming vocals, suggestive lyrics, and upbeat rhythms. Fantastic Voyage compiler Lucky Parker provides generous, thoughtful retrospective tributes to Ruth Brown, Rose Maddox, Wanda Jackson, Janis Martin, Etta James, LaVern Baker, Annisteen Allen, Brenda Lee, Ella Johnson, Lorrie Collins, Barbara Pittman, and many others. Of the 75 songs featured on this 3-disc anthology, most artists perform at least two of their best numbers. Among the most memorable tunes presented are \"Razzle Dazzle\" by Ella Mae Morse, \"Crazy Little Baby\" by Shirley Gunter, \"You Can Have My Husband (But Please Don't Mess With My Man)\" by Irma Thomas, \"Go Get The Shotgun Grand'pa\" by Ann Castle, and \"Rang Dang Dilly\" by Big Maybelle. The only strange track among these fine recordings is \"Lipstick On Your Collar\" by Connie Francis. The more serious problem, though, is the unexplainable omission of a few women who embodied explosive performing zeal and stage-commanding presence on the fifties music scene. Specifically, this compilation should have included \"Hip Shakin' Mama\" by Chubby Newson, \"Hound Dog\" by Willie Mae Thornton, \"I'm Gonna Play The Honky Tonks\" by Marie Adams, and \"Mistrustin' Blues\", \"Misery\", and \"Deceivin' Blues\" by Little Esther Phillips. Girls Gone Rockin' is a terrific introduction to the strong, highly-motivated, independent women recording artists that emerged during the second half of the 20th Century. Ready or not,the fifties faded into memory just as a new generation of very hot, very determined, and very talented female singers emerged. The new divas on disc included Koko Taylor, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, Janis Joplin, Patti LaBelle, Martha Reeves, Pat Benetar, Joan Jett, Chaka Khan, and Melissa Etheridge. Girls Gone Rockin' offers a more than reasonable overview of the R&B, rock 'n' roll, and country music world of the fifties. For those who desire even more tunes by rockabilly gals, check out Hot Rockin' Girls: Female Rock 'N' Roll, 1956-1958 (Jasmine, 2009). -B. Lee Cooper, Ph.D.\n\nHere's some reviews that didn't fit in our\n\nWinter '09/2010 issue!\n\nStephen Stills / Live At Shepherd’s Bush, Manassas / Pieces, Crosby, Stills & Nash / Demos / Eyewall/Atco/Rhino 521560, Eyewall/Rhino 521089 & Atlantic/Rhino 519624\n\nStephen Stills, as solo guy, group leader and group member, was the subject of a trio of 2009 reissues. The first, “Demos,” with Crosby, Stills & Nash, has a dozen tracks laid down between 1968 and ’71. All three harmonize on the opening “Marrakesh Express,” then various members take the lead. Stills is alone on “My Love Is A Gentle Thing” while David Crosby flies solo with “Almost Cut My Hair.” The demos are different enough from the final album versions that this CD is worth checking out. While Crosby, Stills & Nash still tour and record together, they have also gone their separate ways since debuting in 1969. Stills formed Manassas in 1971, enlisting hotshots like Chris Hillman and Joe Walsh. “Pieces” is an appropriate title for the 15-track set. It includes alternate takes from their second album (“Do You Remember The Americans” and “Lies”) along with the previously un-issued “Sugar Babe” and “Word Game” and other rare treats. While bits of “Pieces” might interest serious Stills types, the live album, from a 2008 show in London, is really the way to go. The 13-song CD/DVD is broken into to “acoustic” and “electric” sets and draws on all aspects of Stills’ colorful career, ranging back to Buffalo Springfield (“For What It’s Worth,” “Bluebird”), CSN (“Suite: Judy Blue Eyes”) and solo hits like “Love The One You’re With” and a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Girl From The North Country.” Backed by a tight three-piece band, Stills is clearly at ease, enjoying a romp through his past as much as the enthusiastic crowd. www.rhino.com -Mark Marymont\n\nSteve Conte & The Crazy Truth / Varese Sarabande 302-066-987-2\n\nRock ‘n’ roll fans with a long memory may recall that Steve Conte was the lead guitarist, songwriter and backing singer for The New York Dolls. He’s worked with other bands  Crown Jewels, Contes  but will always be a Doll. On this new project, with drummer Phil Stewart and bassist Max Roach, he’s managed to retain a punky New York persona while blending in bits of power pop, surf and straight ahead rock ‘n’ roll. It’s an attractive blend that, hopefully, will find an audience. Conte wrote all 11 songs and they open with the driving “This Is The End,” move onto the Stones-like “Gypsy Cab,” spit out “Get Off” (a snotty nod to “Get Off My Cloud”), turn to surging power pop in “The Truth Ain’t Pretty,” tell the bitter tale of Atlantic City-bound gamblers on the “Busload Of Hope” and offer a queasy love song in “Strumpet-hearted Monkey Girl.” The only ballad, more or less, is the ironic “Indie Girl.” There are a few guests to fill out the sound, including former Doll front man David Johansen on harmonica, but this is clearly Conte’s show and he offers a powerful collection of songs that reflect on the sometimes seedy, even violent life in the big city. www.steveconteandthecrazytruth.com -Mark Marymont\n\nE-mail BSN\n\nKim Field and the Mighty Titans of Tone / Black Diamonds\n\nEric Daw / Hey Now!\n\nThere are several good reasons to review these two CDs together  they were recorded at about the same time, by two men who were playing together in a band at the time (although the personnel on the two CDs are different on most tunes). The two CDs even share a song (Eric Daw’s “You’re the One”) in versions that offer a good comparison of these top-flight Northwest musicians. The two CDs were also recorded in the same studio (Seattle’s Orbit Audio), both with an emphasis on an uncomplicated, live-in-the-studio, rootsy sound. Both these artists are comfortable as bluesmen, but both have a wider musical view. Influences from classic country music, 60’s soul music, and from the rise of rock and roll are evident here. Of the two, Kim Field is the experienced master; possessed of a long and rich career as a performer, song writer, recording artist and graphic designer  and an internationally known music historian who literally “wrote the book” on the development and history of the harmonica. In his book Harmonicas, Harps and Heavy Breathers, Kim traces his chosen instrument from its humble origins as a pocket instrument for cowboys and hoboes, to the highly amplified, soaring electric instrument launched by the likes of Little Walter and George “Harmonica” Smith into the front lines of modern improvisational music. The younger man, Eric Daw arrived on the Seattle music scene less than a decade ago, and his rapid development as a guitarist; first as a dedicated sideman, seemingly popping up everywhere you looked, to a smoking instrumentalist and increasingly dazzling soloist, to a confident vocalist and a competent songwriter  this development has been a joy to watch and a pleasure to hear.\n\nKim Field’s album, Black Diamonds, represents a solid return to form by Kim as a songwriter. Kim has always pushed himself well beyond the clichés that so many roots music songwriters fall into. “Endless boogie” crowd pleasers are notably absent here, although the Titans can rock with the best of them. What you get from Kim are finely crafted songs  both musically and lyrically  songs that often plunge deep into the heart of human relationships. In addition to calling up the spirits of Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf and their delta predecessors, Kim’s influences by later R&B and country music geniuses like Sam Cooke, Arthur Alexander, and Merle Haggard have added a richness and complexity to his work that sets this CD apart form any other area artist currently on the scene. Kim’s CD opens up with one of the highlights of the set, “My Heart is Still My Own,” a rocking statement of survival in the face of romantic turmoil, followed by “The Language of Love” with the great line “don’t look to the Good Book, or the customs of Japan, if you want my touch, you got to put it in my hand.” “So Dark in Here” follows, a fine soul ballad reminiscent of the classic work of Dan Penn, followed by another of Kim’s rockin’ Cajun tunes (this one written with Henry Cooper), “Dis Pas Ca.” Other\n\nhighlights of this excellent set include Kim’s signature harp instrumental, “Heavy Breathing,” his rollicking take on Eric Daw’s “You’re the One,” mentioned earlier, and the very dark “She’ll Bury You (In the Hole She Dug For Me)” here with Kim on delta style guitar. A reworking of the Slamhound Hunter’s “The Snake Sheds it’s Skin” might make your skin crawl, and the title tune, “Black Diamonds,” is a minor blues coming straight out that desperate 3am hour, with Kim’s huge harmonica tone flowing out of the speakers like black, bitter honey. The musicians on this CD are all top-flight, with a special mention of Billy Spaulding’s rock-solid drumming throughout. As James Ellroy would say, DIG IT.\n\nEric Daw’s CD opens with the title tune, “Hey Now!” a Jimmie Vaughan-style instrumental shuffle which let’s you know right away that you are in for some treats with this collection! The personnel on this cut and several others make up another band that Daw stands out in during appearances around the area  The Satellite Four, a Booker T. and the MGs style instrumentals-only band featuring the amazing Jeff Conlin, who has quickly become my favorite area organist, as well as a solid rhythm section in Johnny Horn and David Hudson on bass and drums. If you like what you hear on this track, “Ricky’s Revenge,” and “Under Control,” you need to get out and see The Satellite Four live! They will blow you away, guaranteed.\n\nThere’s plenty of great guitar scattered all over this set  Daw is an imaginative player who covers a lot of territory, all done with true feeling and a lot of style. Eric has a lighter touch with his singing, but again, this man is growing by leaps and bounds before our eyes and ears, and he carries this initial solo CD very well as a frontman. His vocal touch on “You’re the One” calls up the classic Hollywood rock-a-billy of Ricky Nelson, and had my wife dancing around the room singing along. Expect more great things from Eric Daw  ‘cause we’re gonna get ‘em!\n\nThe best idea, of course, is to get out and see these cats live and pick up these CDs direct from the source, but if need be, you can get either one or both from cdbaby.com. You WILL be glad you did! -Mark Dalton Fall 2009\n\nLes Blousons Noirs / Special Rock\n\nBorn Bad Records 006\n\nThis is so bad it's impossible to believe the 8 tracks actually were released on two EPs in 1961 and '62. The young quartet covers a few American hits (and sings some in French, too), starting with the dreadful \"Be Bop A Lula\" and ending on several Twist covers. A singer who can't hold a note (and with a super strong accent on the English songs), a drummer who is totally out of sync plus very rudimentary guitar licks. Marc said the rehearsal tape for his very first 60s band sounded better than this. The quartet sounds like a chaotic one man band and yes, it does me remind me of Hasil Adkins who had a ton more talent than Les Blousons Noirs. A+ for enthusiasm and guts! Liner notes are in French and if I understand it correctly, the Blousons Noirs are celebrated as early Punk rockers in the tradition of the Legendary Stardust Cowboy and such. If you need a (astonishingly bad) gag present for someone, this would be it. Myspace.com/Bornbadrecords. -GMB\n\nNatasha James / Tequila Time / HOR 817\n\nHere's some nice laid back roots music for a lazy afternoon. Call it Americana, Country or Roots Rock, Natasha James surrounded herself with an excellent crew of experienced musicians (Asleep At The Wheel, Chris Isaak band) to create a 15 song, 49 minute toe-tapping album that comes straight from the heart. Plenty of pedal steel guitar, fiddles, resophonic guitar. The stand outs for me are the songs with a Tex Mex flair and the California native dishes it out with gusto on the accordion laced \"Boy Do We Drink\". There's a Latin flair in \"Cheetah On The Run\" and a slide guitar spicing up \"Get Out Of My Way\". I dig the jug band feel of \"Stuck in Atlanta\", the groovy, bluesy \"If You Think This Is Love\" and the New Orleans style \"Somebody Just Blew It\". It's Tequila Time! Natshajames.com. -GMB\n\nThe Tractors / Trade Union / Koch-CD 5071\n\nThis new album by the Tractors has been on the shelves since spring but just in case you missed it, the bouncy beat of the Oklahoma gang is worth a listen. While considered a Country act, the Tractors incorporate roots music styles from Rock'n'Roll to Blues and deliver it all with a boogie beat to boot. Head Tractor Steve Riley sings, plays guitar, produced and wrote the majority of songs and invited a star studded cast of friends to participate. 70s Country icon Leon Russell pounds the 88 keys on the energetic opener \"Up Jumped The Boogie\" and also on his own 50's style Rock'n'Roll \"Good Old Days\" with wailing saxophones and great steel guitar. Guitar great J.J. Cale nails a shuffle on his composition \"Rhythm Bone\", also taking the second lead vocals. \"Pick Me Up On Your Way Down\" is probably my favorite Harlan Howard song and The Tractors take a traditional approach here with a real nice Western Swing arrangement. Several rootsy Country tunes follow, a couple slower like the weeper \"Love Hurts\", some drivin', others bluesy (\"Midnight Train'\") or full blast roots Rock. While I enjoy the album, the one beef I have (besides the dismal cover art) is that several songs have some sort of intro that distracts from the actual tune. Overall a good pick for fans of upbeat Country with a roots twang. -GMB\n\nSaffire The Uppity Blues Women / Havin' The Last Word / Alligator Records\n\nAfter 25 years of existence, Saffire calls it quits! Fortunately they go out with a bang in form of this new 16-song album aptly titled \"Havin' The Last Word\". If you know these three talented and outspoken women, you know they just have to dispense another big dose of sassy advice and wise cracking comments packaged into an acoustic Blues music mix that clocks in at just under an hour of playtime. Six well chosen covers by the likes of EG Kight and Deanna Bogart supplement the originals by this trio that range from laid-back Country Blues to Boogie Woogie, Gospel and beyond . The opener \"Goin' Down To The River\" with its infectious New Orleans groove and the fun \"Nothin' In Your House\" are among my favorites here. Gaye Adegbadola's (guitar, harmonica) excellent recent solo album was very personal and so are her contributions here. \"Bald Headed Blues\" deals with her triumph over cancer. \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself\" tells the story of getting foreclosed upon in this recent economic downturn. Her \"Locked Up\" is an encouraging Gospel laced piece about unconditional support for an incarcerated loved one. In the tradition of the often suggestive blues lyrics that date back to the 20s and 30s, Gay revives the genre with the risky piano driven \"Bald Eagle\". Ann Rabson's (piano, guitar) husky voice graces her toe-tappin' \"Since You Been Gone\" that ends on an uplifting note. Her boogie piano prominently drives the fine \"Travelin' At The Speed Of Love\" and rocks and rolls on \"Haste Makes Waste\". Andra Fay's (mandolin, fiddle, upright bass) glass clear voice works perfectly on her beautiful \"Blue Lullaby\", an excellent addition that you'd rather expect to find on a traditional Country or Bluegrass album. She rocks, rolls and boogies on her upbeat \"Walkin' Home To You\". The real show stopper here is \"Too Much Butt\", if this doesn't bring a smile to your face, you're way too skinny! And remember \"there no such thing as too much butt\" and if you need more encouragement take \"I'm Growing Older\" defying the stereotype of mature women. Saffire will be touring behind this album and we all know we'll hear from them again (watch out for the soon to be release documentary \"Hot Flash\"), individually or maybe for that special occasion. uppityblueswomen.com. -GMB\n\nGene Snowden / Austin's Original Hillbilly Poet / Part CD 676.001\n\nThis is what you'd call a “field” recording, and Snowden was playing for a couple of friends whom you can hear in the background clinking glasses and talking some. Ray Campi recorded Gene's “Quit Your Triflin'” early in his Rollin' Rock era, and later Gene sent this tape of a bunch of his other original songs (made in 1970) in case Ray might record another. Ray did do “How Can I Get On Top, two versions of which are here.” It reminds me a little of those Ramblin' Jack Elliot recordings where they had to trick him into recording by gathering a few friends and putting the lights low etc. Occasional annoying pops when Gene is tapping his foot on the mike stand, or too near it. And some of the songs are incomplete - he didn't remember all the verses. At the end are a couple of Gene's full band recordings from about 1950. 27 tracks, some partial and a couple repeated in different versions. Part-Records.de -MB\n\nMike Westhues / Dumbflakes For Breakfast / Humble House Records 32\n\nSometimes a song grabs you from the very first notes and sometimes a whole album has that effect. Dumbflakes for Breakfast does it to me, you can feel the pain, experiences of a life lived to the fullest with all its ups and downs from loving to leaving. What Watermelon Slim is to the Blues community, Mike Westhues is to the field of roots music with his gravely vocals, wry lyrics packaged into a frame of a man that had his share of bar room romances, whiskeys and days and nights spend at the roadhouse saloon. He's been a world traveler since 1971, first hitchhiking through the USA, then moving to Finland, later Sweden, back to the USA and finally Finland again. Helsinki is were he recorded these 13 original tunes, beautifully backed by a team of first rate players (guitars, acoustic bass, drums, piano plus occasionally dobro and organ). The opener \"Bettin' On Love\" (a fine slow Country shuffle) and the energetic \"Fools Like Us\" come to full life with a great female chorus - the latter with a bit of a New Orleans flair. The haunting \"47 Ford\" sounds autobiographical, \"Hide-Away St. Bar\" swings and \"Raindrops On Your Doorstep\" is another sad shuffle. Mike Westhues spices it up with the toe-tappin' roots rocker \"53rd And Vine\" with sizzling Blues slide guitar and pounding piano. Another fine bluesy track is the slow groovin' \"If You Don't Mind My Company\", Ray Charles style. \"Scrambled Red Eyes\" is a great piece with Rockabilly style guitar and the yummy \"Tennessee Stew\" (about eating roadkill) combines a variety of Blues and Rock'n'Roll influences to maximum effect, sounds like a real crowd pleaser to me! This is an excellent release with lots of heart and soul. Often in a laid back mood but always passionately delivered songs with gritty lyrics and vocals and a great sound that should make an impact in the Blues, Americana/Roots music and possibly Country scene. Humblehouserecords.com -GMB\n\nRhythm Aces / Hand Me Down Suits'n' Hobnail Boots / TRA 01\n\nFor starters, don't confuse this British Trio with the American Amazing Rhythm Aces. These Rhythm Aces are veterans of the British Rockabilly scene and just put out this all original 12-track album that comes with an insert boasting song lyrics and lavish layout but no band bio of any sort - same goes for their myspace space! The three (guitar, upright bass, drums) are very active playing festivals and clubs all over Europe and have a somewhat unique sound. \"What's The Matter Baby\" has the distinct Johnny Cash guitar sound, but that's the only comparison I can come up with. Many songs are somewhat specific to England and it's hell raising Teddy Boys. Check out \"I'm Bad\", \"The First Teenage\" and the atmospheric \"Cosh Boy\" - very cool with excellent guitar work. \"Life At The Top\" is an all acoustic offering (with acoustic lead guitar) while \"The Fabulous Rosina\" is a great song about a pin up and it rocks and rolls, one of the most dynamic offerings here. \"78 RPM\" is a fine Rockabilly that fittingly describes the dawn of the Rock'n'Roll revolution in Great Britain. Overall an interesting release that could have benefitted from a mix that would have emphasized the vocals a little more. Myspace.com/therhythmaces -GMB\n\nHere are some current reviews that DIDN'T fit into our Spring 2009 issue! Read 'em only here\n\nOrder our Latest Issue!\n\nAnd read the rest of the current reviews!\n\nRaul Malo / Lucky One\n\nFantasy 30896-02ADV\n\nRaul Malo has always been an eclectic fellow, going back to his days with the Mavericks, and that’s certainly the case on this collection of a dozen songs. All were written by Malo, the first such CD in seven years after a couple of well-done sets spotlighting renditions of pop and country classics. Those old influences are obvious on this new project, from the twangy Bakersfield country of “Lonely Hearts” and the jangly rock of “Lucky One” to the cheerfully lusty “Moonlight Kiss” and the elegantly sad “Crying For You,” which could have been done by Roy Orbison. “One More Angel,” a ballad with a strong rock beat, and the mournful, Latin-influenced “Rosalie” are clearly about the departure of a loved one  in one case to that great bedroom in the sky  but avoid coming off as too maudlin. Working with producer Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) Malo used a full band on some tracks while others are demos cut over a two-year period at his Nashville home that didn’t need that much enhancement. Malo’s voice is as evocative as ever and it’s clear he still knows how to write a meaningful, entertaining song. www.concordmusicgroup.com -Mark Marymont\n\nTwangbangers / Twang! Boom! Bang!\n\nTCY Records\n\nThis is a German Rockabilly trio, not the US Honky Tonk roots rockers Bill Kirchen and Redd Volkaert are part of. The three musicians garnered experience in several other bands, most notably the Jailbirds, before \"Mr. Twang\" lend his singing, song writing (10 originals, 4 covers here) and guitar playing abilities to the Twangbangers. The trio has a modern sound and lyrics that circle around \"Back Seat Lovin'\", \"Burger Time\", \"Lady Ink\", \"Don't Feel Like Fighting\" - pretty typical fare. The drivin' \"Rockabilly Cat\" describes his musical idols, from Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran to the Blue Cats and Polecats and cleverly incorporates a few licks Gene Vincent & The Blue Caps and Restless style, among others. He's proud to be a \"White Trash Man\" and slows it down a bit for the bopper \"I Would Only Make You Blue\". The melodic \"Guard My Heart:\" is one of the more memorable tracks. \"Race With The Devil\" is a pretty furious cover, I could have done without Jagger's \"Satisfaction\" (done Rockabilly style) but I dig Billy Joe Shavers' \"Georgia On A Fast Train\" with steel guitar, deep baritone vocals and finger picked guitar at a break neck speed. The Twangbangers are tight, Mr. Twang's singing is fine, his guitar playing (with a nice, clean tone and often twangy) a highlight throughout the album that overall could have profited a bit from more variety in styles and tempi plus a few more well chosen covers. tcy-records.com. -GMB\n\nHere's some reviews that didn't fit in our\n\nWinter '08 issue!\n\nFilm Review\n\nCadillac Records / Sony Music Pictures\n\nA film covering 20 years of the meatiest American music history ever is of necessity going to be an over simplification at best. Gaby and I enjoyed this film quite a bit, though, even though at least a couple important characters (Bo Diddley and Phil Chess  Shiloh Fernandez plays Phil, but I don’t remember the character in the story at all, perhaps it was a scene of the brothers at a young age) were left out of the story completely. Adrian Brody plays Leonard Chess and Jeffrey Wright plays Muddy Waters, Cedric the Entertainer plays Willie Dixon, whose character narrates the film. Another thing the film comes up short on are Dixon’s contributions both as a songwriter and record producer  only one of his songs (“My Babe”) actually appears. Chronological history takes a hit when Elvis appears along about 1962- ’64, but in a clip from the mid-‘50s, then the version you hear of “My Babe” by Elvis is from ’69. They could have included Dale Hawkins’ version of that song which appeared on Chess subsidiary Checker, but again, too many characters just are impossible in a 109 minute film. Still, Eamon Walker as Howlin’ Wolf, Mos Def as Chuck Berry, and Beyoncé Knowles as Etta James are all quite good! Wright is also good as Muddy, just doesn’t look that much like him. Eric Bogosian as Allen Freed was powerful if not realistic. The film was written and directed by Darnell Martin. One hopes that Mos Def and Beyoncé will bring many younger viewers in who’d then check out not only a bunch of the original recordings from Chess, but also the true stories. The real stories are much richer yet, but this film gives a good taste, and I hope it is successful enough to spawn several more films about our pioneers of Blues and Rock’n’Roll! Do buy a ticket and see it! You’ll likely also want to own the DVD when it comes out. -MB\n\nDino Delray & Uncle Dave Harrison / Coyotes Howling at the Crescent Moon / South Mountain Music SMM001\n\nWe reviewed a Dino Delray disc a while back, and I think that one was made in his own basement studio. This one was recorded at Wild Hare’s studio on the vintage gear, with a couple of guys from Rockabilly band the Chaotics for a rhythm section. They have their own group called the South Mountain Coyotes, and I assume the material here is indicative of what that group does. That material includes Bluegrassish stuff like Vince Gill’s “High Lonesome Sound,” and Rockabilly like “I’m On Fire.” Even Louvin Brothers’ classics like “My Baby’s Gone,” which is my favorite track. There are 2 Evan Johns songs in “Day Go By” (with a little electric guitar  actually another favorite because I like the song!) and “Pain Of Love”, and even a Beatles song with “Two Of Us.” They tap Gordon Lightfoot for “For Loving Me,” themselves for “Running Heart” (Dino wrote it with another guy), and NRBQ’s Joey Spampinato for “That’s Alright.” Two guys on acoustic guitars singing separately or together, with upright bass & drums (brushes mostly) backing. With that instrumentation, the folkier stuff is what works best. dinodelray@yahoo.com -MB\n\nThe Creepshow / Run For You Life / STMP 062\n\nPsychobilly fans will dig the second release by Ontario based Creepshow who just came back from a big European tour. The quartet writes their own tales about \"Demon Lover\", being \"Buried Alive\" and other creepy stuff. \"You'll Come Crawlin'\", is a full tilt rocker with vocal harmonies by the boys here, helping out Sarah who is a powerful singer. The band races through a total of 10 hot original Psychobillies with a Punk edge with hard slappin' bass, scorching guitar and energetic drums plus an organ played by Revered McGiny that gives Creepshow a distinctive sound. What makes Creepshow special though is clearly the presence of front woman Sarah Sin who belts out every song and plays a mean guitar - a great sounding weapon of massive ear attacks and eye candy to boot. Elaborate & stylish album packaging, including song lyrics too! Stomprecords.com. -GMB\n\nDonnie Fritts / One Foot In The Grove Leaning Man Records-01\n\nThere's been a gap of some eleven years since Fritt's last album Everybody's Got A Song. Like buddies Dan Penn, Bobby Charles and Spooner Oldham he is known more as a writer of classic songs than a performer. Fritts and Eddie Hinton co-wrote 'Breakfast In Bed' for Dusty Springfield as well as countless others for the likes of John Prine and Kris Kristofferson. The title track is a wonderful combination of blue-sy southern soul and grove recalling Fritt's recovery from surgery where he literally had just 'one foot in the grove'. The raw humor of 'She's Got A Crush On Me' where he is on the receiving end of unwanted adulation 'She lives at the Sweetwater Trailer Park lot number three / She goes to the Church of Christ / She chain smokes Camel Lights / And she's got a crush on me,' is equally funny and profound. Old friends Tony Joe White and Billy Swan lend a hand on several songs and the horns of Wayne Jackson and Harvey Thompson create an easy goin' grove to the proceedings. It's all fairly laid back stuff, but repeated listening reveals many moments of sheer genius. www.donniefritts.com -Rick Meek\n\nThe Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue / Command Performance Delta Grove DGPCD121\n\nThe LRBR is Tommy Castro, Deanna Bogart, Magic Dick and Ronnie Baker Brooks backed by a solid band including Scott Sunderland (bass), Keith Crossan (sax), Tom Poole (trumpet) and Chris Sandoval (drums). This live set from October 2007 was recorded in various California clubs, plus three tracks taken from the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise. Ronnie Baker Brook's 'Can't You See' kicks off in high gear, he's a talented guitarist and no mean vocalist either. Equally Tommy Castro takes no prisoners on his 'High On The Hog'. Magic Dick of course has been around forever and shines on several songs with his unique harmonica licks and vocals, but for me the real star of the show is multi-talented Deanna Bogart who flits between piano, organ, sax and vocals with ease, even reviving Billy Preston's 'Will It Go Round In Circles' and making it sound new. Other guests include Curtis Salgado and Marcia Ball who's version of 'Sea Cruise' ends a pretty good mix of down home party music. Wish I could have joined in the fun! www.deltagrovemusic.com -Rick Meek\n\nOrder our Latest Issue!\n\nScott Ellison / Ice Storm / Earwig CD 4956\n\nEllison has quite a resume, but the standout item on it is playing rhythm guitar behind Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown in the early ‘80s. He’s also written and recorded a number of songs that have been part of TV shows, and the opening tune (“Don’t Push Your Luck”) of the Morgan Freeman Film Feast Of Love released last year. He also wrote all 12 of the songs on this CD, which features modern Blues with Rock sensibilities. This one’s pretty close to the line I draw between Blues/Rock and Rock/Blues. I have no interest in the latter anymore, but this one’s on the Blues side of the line. As if to make me a liar, “Keys To My Heart” opens with acoustic guitar. But that one’s not really Blues, more like a John Hiatt type thing. My favorite song is “Cadillac Woman”, a faster shuffle. The title song is a fast swinging Blues instrumental with extended sax lead, another favorite. Ellison’s a good songwriter, and I’m not sure why, but his CD reminds me a lot of a bunch of titles I used to review on the now defunct Ichiban label. One clue might be that former Ichiban artist Travis Haddix is now on Earwig. Earwigmusic.com MB\n\nTravis “Moonchild” Haddix / Daylight At Midnight / Earwig 4955\n\nMississippi born Haddix’s CD is straight ahead Blues with a horn section and harmonica (Bob Frank, who also plays lead guitar in addition to Haddix). Besides for himself Travis has also written songs for Artie “Blues Boy” White, Jimmy Dawkins and the late Son Seals. This is really more like it for my taste, and all 10 songs are original. The band sounds great, even features David Ruffin on tenor sax! Well, not the one we remember, a different Ruffin. Bouncing around from Milwaukee to Cleveland to Stuttgart (Germany, while in the service), Haddix made his first recording with Chuck & The Tremblers back in Cleveland in ’65. “Stop Cheating Woman” was his own song, on the Del-Nita label, not released until ’68. Striking out on his own after 6 years with Chuck Barkley, Travis had superstar Johnnie Taylor steal his band the New Sound after they opened for him, so he started the Travis Haddix Band, which he still runs. He acquired the nickname “Moonchild” from the title of a 1984 single backed by Ernest & The Roccos, which he’d played with during the same time as the Tremblers. Ichiban folded after he made 5 albums for them, and Haddix formed his own label Wann-Sonn. In fact this CD was cut for that label, then picked up by Earwig, which also makes available all 10 of Travis’ self-produced CDs. He tours Europe extensively, and I can see why they like him over there. This is real Blues, from a guy who came up with it  his father and uncles played Saturday Night Fish Frys down in Mississippi. If your dad got drunk and sat on your Stella breaking off the neck, you’d have the Blues too! Shuffles here, slow Blues, and some funky things too  great stuff! Earwigmusic.com MB\n\nLiz Mandeville / Red Top / Earwig CD 4954\n\nYou might remember Liz with the last name Greeson, but this is the same red head that plays sassy, swingin’ Blues. She wrote all 15 songs. And her band (which includes Eddie Shaw on a couple tracks, and our old buddy Twist Turner on 5) is totally solid. There’s some fine piano from Allen Batts on 5 songs, and horns on 5 tracks. Ricky Nelson plays drums on a cut, but again, obviously not the one we remember. Liz knows how to work it with titles like “Spanky Butt”, “My Baby’s Her BabyToo,” “Scratch The Kitty,” “Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,” and “Guilty Of Rockin’ All Night.” She mixes the tempos and grooves well too, even including vintage Blues mama style on “Rub My Belly.”. “Hold Me” is Soul music at its best. “Home Cookin’” features the acoustic resonator guitar. She even plays a bit of Louisiana style scrubboard! Highly recommended! Earwigmusic.com MB\n\nHermann Lammers Meyer / 1961  A Love Song / Desert Kid DK 2006-20\n\nMeyer is one of the top Country artists of Germany, and he’s also got a few radio shows (hear them on the internet linked at the web address below)  spreading the Gospel of Country music in more ways than one! He traveled to Nashville to make his latest CD, and among the pickers on it are Buddy Emmons on pedal steel and Buddy Spicher on fiddle! With buddies like that…well it’s no joke  that’s the way to cut some great Country music. Not only that, one of my all-time favorite artists Becky Hobbs plays piano and sings on “Nashville Cats Boogie,” one of 6 of Hermann’s original songs on the CD. The covers come from a variety of directions, including Ned Miller’s “Do What You Do Do Well,” Merle Haggard’s “Just Between The Two Of us,” Willie Nelson’s “Mr. Record Man” (done as a duet to enhance the picture that there are matching lonely people out there listening to the radio), even Lennon, McCartney and Starkey’s “What Goes On” and Delaney Bramlett’s “Never Ending Song Of Love” (with a bit of banjo) and more! Production is also excellent, there are a few other guest vocalists on duets  Lois Johnson, Laney Hicks, Dusty Owens and Annie B. Hermann reminds me a lot of “Whispering” Bill Anderson on his own title song and some of the others, but not all the time. My favorite is “Neon Leon” about a broke down Country singer. The only other German Country act I’ve heard  Truckstop  sings some of their songs in German, but Meyer sings all his in English. If you like REAL Country music, you’d enjoy this CD! 16 tracks total, including an all-star jam instrumental.

They are veterans of the Southern California music scene and on this CD they join forces with veteran blues guitarist Kid Ramos. The results are spectacular. A remake of Rockin’ Dopsie’s “You Ain’t Nothin’ But Fine” brings a bit of Doug Sahm’s influence. Another Cajun classic Clifton Chenier’s “All Night Long” brings a new twist to an old classic. It is on a remake of the Rock N Roll Trio’s “Lonesome Train In My Eyes” that the Los Fabulocos demonstrate their rock roots. They dip into roots rock for a version of Lloyd Price’s “Just Because” that brings a new twist to a classic rocker. The two Jesus Cuevas original songs “If You Know” and “Day After Day” are brilliant examples of the genre. Covers of Huey Piano Smith’s “Dedicated Fool” and Rockin’ Sidney’s “You Ain’t Nothin’ But Fine” are classics with an original twist. Kid Ramos and Jose Cuevas provide vocals that make this a highly recommended CD. A great effort. -Howard A. DeWitt\n\nEddie Floyd/ Eddie Loves You So Stax Records STXCD-30795\n\nEddie Floyd is back with an album of new material. The good news is that he reprises some old classics. With remakes of the Falcons’ “You’re So Fine” and “Since You Been Gone,” Floyd’s scintillating vocals are still in place. “Since You Been Gone” was a Falcon demo that was never released and this is a rare Eddie Floyd gem, With nine of the ten songs on the CD written by Floyd, he gets a chance to record songs he wrote for other people including the Sam and Dave “You Don’t Know What You Mean To Me,” Dorothy Moore’s “I Don’t Want To Be With Anybody But You” and Carla Thomas “I Will Always Have Faith in Your.” This is a masterful soul album with a version of Floyd’s 1964 classic “Never Get Enough of Your Love” that is worth the price of the CD. A soul legend releases another masterpiece. -Howard A. DeWitt\n\nNeon Swing X-Perience / Here To Stay\n\nNeon Swing X-Perience has been playing a powerful mix of modern Swing for the last 10 years in and around Pennsylvania. Founder and singer Mike Urick (also on trumpet) contributed four of the ten songs. Reworks of classics include \"In The Mood\" (like Glenn Miller's arrangement), \"Jump, Jive & Wail (more like the Brian Setzer version than Louis Prima's original) and Cab Calloway's cool \"Minnie The Moocher\", among others. Their own \"Tragically Uncool\" starts off the self released album with a powerful groove and lines you haven't heard before like \"A Subaru is my favorite car\". The following \"Man With The Hex\" is a rockin' Swing that combines the power of Gospel style shouting with the voodoo of Screamin' Jay Hawkins. The septet reminds me of bands like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Fans of modern Swing music will enjoy Neon Swing X-Perience.

Factory 826663-10984\n\nFormed as a duo in 1996 by fiddle ace and singer Elana James and guitarist and singer Whit Smith, they morphed into a trio that specialized in a congenial mix of hot jazz, Western swing and bits and pieces of pop and country. This 20-track CD draws on their four albums for HighTone Records, which was recently acquired by Shout! Factory. They haven’t done a studio album in more than six years but are now back in the studio and on the road after a two-year hiatus. Hopefully, future work will match the quality of the past ably demonstrated here. Both James and Smith are talented writers as she demonstrates on the countrygrass of “Forget-Me-Nots” and the pouting but good-natured “I’d Understand Why.” Smith’s deadpan voice is perfect on the infectious jazz of “It Stops With Me,” brooding “When I Lost You” and “Sleep,” an original tale of insomnia. The group demonstrates eclectic taste in covers, offering an easygoing instrumental of “Stardust” while vocalizing on pop standards like “I Can’t Believe You’re In Love With Me,” “Deed I Do” and the much-recorded “Ida Red.” It closes with a dynamic live version of “Orange Blossom Special” that actually breaths new life into the classic fiddle tour de force. www.hotclubofcowtown.com -Mark Marymont\n\nHolly Golightly and the Brokeoffs / Dirt Don’t Hurt / Transdreamer TR 1259-CD\n\nThese two sound at times like the Rolling Stones and others like an out-of-Appalachia folk duo. And, they are a duo, with Ms. Golightly singing and playing guitar and banjo and Lawyer Dave, aka the Brokeoffs, singing and playing all kinds of stuff. Golightly has worked with various other groups, including Thee Headcoatees, and has issued on almost 20 albums and other releases. No matter how experienced she is, they keep it simple here, from the upbeat Stones-sounding opener, “Bottom Below” and minor-key, brooding “Up Off The Floor” to the frisky, folky blues of “My 45” and atmospheric “Indeed You Do.” It’s hard to gauge the seriousness of the gospel “Gettin’ High For Jesus,” but it’s a lot of fun and is balanced out by the intensity of “Boat’s Up The River” and the good-natured cheer of the blues oldie “I Wanna Hug Ya, Kiss Ya, Squeeze Ya.” It would be interesting to see them carry off the depth of sound they achieve on this disc when they play live, but you have to figure they make it work. And they certainly make it work on their first “official” U.S. release. hollygolightlyandthebrokeoffs.com -Mark Marymont\n\nBrenda & The Tabulations / The Dionn Records Singles Collection 1966-1969” (Jamie 3909) & “The Top & Bottom Singles Collection 1969-1971 / (Jamie 3912)\n\nThis may almost too much of a good thing for fans of the Philadelphia-based sweet Soul group, with 28 tracks spread over two separate discs. But they did some good things for both labels and completists will enjoy the mix of hits and albums tracks by Brenda and the boys. Some of this material came out almost a decade ago on the then-newly revived Jamie label. And, like those collections, they are drawn from the original masters overseen by esteemed pros like Gamble & Huff and Van McCoy. Both small labels were distributed by Jamie and each had a Brenda smash and lesser-known songs that did better on the R&B charts. Debuting in 1967 with “Dry Your Eyes,” the group had a Top 10 success followed by other soulful treats via Dionn. Resurfacing in 1969 on Top & Bottom, their best seller was the McCoy-produced “Right On The Tip Of My Tongue.” They also did well with their take of Dionne Warwick’s “Don’t Make Me Over” and the morose “A Child No One Wanted.” Brenda Payton (who died in 1992 at the age of 46) had an expressive voice if not the most unique of that era. But she was always convincing and the various Tabulations offered stellar backing. jamguy.com -Mark Marymont\n\nMack Fowler/Playin’ For Keeps MF Records\n\nMack Fowler is a songwriter with a modern blues touch. His eleven original songs on this CD bring a new talent to the fore. With “Lovin’ Me Blind” he recreates a Southern blues sound that owes a great deal to the traditions of classic Southern blues bands. The poignant “Woman” is a classic blues song that showcases Fowler’s vocal talent. There is a smoky vocal to “Dana” and Fowler’s guitar work on She’s A Real Good Time” is classic. This is a CD that deserves a wide audiences. The original songs are in a blues-rock vein that is well worth listening and the concluding tune “Rollin’ On” is a wonderful way to end a great CD. -Howard A. DeWitt\n\nWhiskey River (Take My Mind): The True Story of Texas Honky-Tonk\n\nBook by Johnny Bush with Rick Mitchell. University of Texas Press\n\nWell, you can bet your boots Johnny Bush knows what he's talkin' about when it comes to Texas Honky-Tonk. That's what he's been playin' and singin' since the early 1950's and that's what he's still playin' today. Bush grew up in Houston - singin', playin' guitar, learnin' from his musical uncle Smilin' Jerry Jericho, doin' local radio and t.v. and turnin' pro when he's still a teenager. His first regular gig was playin' the Texas Star Inn in San Antonio - drawin' good crowds and makin' good money - ten dollars a night. That's where he learned to play the drums and where he learned about watchin' out for shady club owners. Since then he's been in Willie Nelson's band, and in Ray Price's, he's been in package shows, and he's been a bandleader. And he's always been able to pack the house and to sell records in Texas - even when the rest of the world didn't give a damn. Now for most of his adult life Johnny Bush was the kind of guy who just couldn't resist puttin' the pork to just about any chick he came across, but he also liked fallin' in love and gettin' married. This usually meant that his marriages didn't last too long, but it also meant he knows what he's singin' about when he does a cheatin' song or a splittin' up song. It also gives him plenty of good stories... and he ain't afraid to tell 'em. For example, at a time when he and Willie were each gettin' more ass than a couple of toilet seats, Bush gets the clap for the third time - so he asks Willie how come he never gets it. Willie's reply: \"It's very simple. I only fuck married women.\" Hmmm... so seems to me that Ol' Willie left that little pearl of wisdom out of his own autobiography. But don't worry, there's plenty more great Willie stories here. And some Ray Price/Cherokee Cowboy stories, too. Naturally, Bush tells about the fun he's had of drinkin' and poppin' pills - and about his troubles from drinkin' and poppin' pills - but you've heard all that before about other hard livin' Country stars. But what you might not know about are his troubles with spasmodic dysphonia - a medical condition that weakened the vocal cords and eventually took his voice away... for a while. With therapy he learned how to talk and sing all over again - but his voice had changed. He couldn't hit the high notes anymore - so he learned to sing in lower keys. (Personally, I like his voice better now. It's definitely lower and less operatic. It's growlier and more lived in, it just lets you know he's been through some hard times and it damn sure is a better fit with the words he's singin'.) Now about Bush's writing style: his train of thought seems to get de-railed pretty easily. For example: he'll start out explaining the steel guitar part of one of his songs (\"Sound of a Heartache\"). Then he'll jump back in time to the first time he heard \"Steel Guitar Rag\" as a kid. Then he'll throw in a brief history of the evolution of the steel guitar: from an acoustic guitar with the nut raised, through Leon McAuliffe's Fender solid body triple neck non-pedal steel, through the current favorite double necks with ten strings on each neck with floor pedals and seven knee pedals. Then he'll explain the different tunings for each neck (E9th - best for ballads and C6th - best for up tempo stuff). Then he talks about his all time favorite steel players Jimmy Day (best for the slow stuff when he was straight) and Buddy Emmons (best for the fast stuff - unless he didn't like the song - then he might get up and walk out of the session) Then Bush talks about Herb Steiner - who's been playing steel in Bush's band for the past ten years. Then he'll get back on track, back to \"Sound of a Heartache.\" It's a round about way of tellin' the story, but you damn sure understand what he's talkin' about. It all reads like a good barroom conversation and you'll damn sure enjoy the ride.There's about 50 photos, a discography, lots of song lyrics.

Read 'em only here\n\nBilly Joe Royal / Going By Daydreams Raindrops\n\nI’m sure you remember Billy Joe Royal’s 2 biggest hits “Down In The Boondocks” and “Cherry Hill Park”, and maybe also “Hush.” Royal has been playing the oldies circuit, and now has a new CD produced by Chips and Casey Moman on B.J. Thomas’ label Raindrop Records. I’m all for guys like this keeping their hand in with more than just nostalgia shows, and while it starts off with some gentle Pop stuff, “All He Wants To Do Is Play” rocks on about a guy who wants to play “Johnny B. Goode.” There’s a cover of “Under The Boardwalk,” Moman’s “Class Of ‘65” reminisces and wonders “Where Did The ‘60s Go?”, and most of the program is fairly wistful Pop, but Royal still has his pipes. Bjraindrops.com MB\n\nCrazy Hambones / Blowin The Family Jewels / Stormy Monday MO 81221\n\nWe had the great pleasure of seeing these guys in Germany a couple years ago, and I even got to sit in for a tune! We also reviewed a previous CD that had been released under the name Coolstep, with their previous harmonica player/frontman Paul Orta. They are committed to the vintage Blues sound and feature just guitar, drums (sometimes washboard, spoons or tambourine), and harmonica/vocals. This new 15 song CD features a mix of traditional material from the likes of Johnny Shines, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Jerry McCain, Chuck Berry and Dr. Ross, with originals written or co-written by guitarist Peter Krause and “Hambone Boogie” which credits all three, Henry Heggen (harp, vocals), Michael Maass (drums, vocals) and Krause (guitar, vocals). The production places you, the listener, right in the midst of the band, a great immediate and intimate feel. In this day of in your face bass mixes, here’s a band with NO bass player  and it works fine for me! I’m not against bass, but there’s plenty of traditional precedent for this type of lineup. Excellent vintage style Country Blues, with some fine harmonica, guitar (and slide) and for that matter percussion plus great singing! Hambones.de MB\n\nFranklin & Baytop / Searching For Frank Patuxent CD-156\n\nOK, they got me: I’m looking for Frank Stokes too! In fact it was one of his songs(“Downtown Blues”) I played with Crazy Hambones in Saltzgitter-Bad. They don’t do that tune on this CD, but open with another of my favorites, Blind Blake’s “Champagne Charlie.” They’re not just doing Stokes obviously, but instead trying to paint a picture of the context in which Stokes and his partner Dan Sane were working. They do “I Got Mine,” which the Frank recorded, along with others, and tunes from contemporaries like Furry Lewis (“Jail House Blues”), Bo Carter (“Beans”) and others. These two guitarists come of the Washington D.C. area, where Rick Franklin had worked with the late Archie Edwards and the late John Jackson. Michael Baytop also hung around Edwards’ barbershop, and both have absorbed the fingerpicking Blues tradition. They are among the few younger black artists to take up this tradition. Baytop also picked up the bones playing tradition, and you can hear a bit of that s well as his harmonica, giving some variety of sound to this pastiche of street singer style vintage Blues.

Back in the middle and late 60’s, they were writin' and puttin' out some of the hardest of all hard-core Honky-Tonk. This was not good-natured dance music, this was gut-churning hard drinkin' juke box music for the guy at the bar that you just know you’d best steer clear of. Mayhew did the producin' and Paycheck was the label’s top singin' star. Top pickin' star was their amazing house steel man Lloyd Green. But nobody was gettin' rich, so they closed up shop. But now Aubrey Mayhew is back producin` and Green is back still playin' his steel guitar “with an attitude”. They’ve brought back a few other original session men like Pig Robbins on piano and Pete Wade + Billy Sanford on guitar. None of these boys has missed a lick and they’re doin' the same song that put Little Darlin' and Paycheck on the map to begin with. Only this time its Dale Watson doin' the singin'. Sounds like he’s singin' deep down from his balls and that matches up just fine with these 15 emotion-drippin` drinkin` and hurtin` songs. To my ears everything on Dale Watson’s The Little Darlin Sessions sounds just like it ought to sound- like it could have been recorded back when men were men and when a Country record was still Country, [ its almost unheard of today, but they actually recorded Watson’s vocals while the band was playin'. ] The songs are right on the money- 9 written by Mayhew and/or Paycheck, a couple from Groovey Joe Poovey, and a real sad one co-written by that Kentucky-Fried Col. himself Harlan Sanders. My favorites are an unrepentant gettin' wasted song “If I’m Gonna Sink (I might as well go to the bottom)” from Mayhew-Paycheck, followed by Mayhews “I don’t need a bottle (to sleep like a baby now )” - about kickin` alcoholism and “He thought he‘d die laughing (.. And he did )” - a fun ironic one from Poovey about killin' the dude who’s been braggin` about fuckin` your ol’ lady - God I just love this stuff. that’s why it surprizes the hell out of me that Dale Watson has pretty much disowned his Little Darlin Sessions album, sayin' that they were hurried in the studio and didn’t have time to get it right, and that he’s not happy with the results or with his own singin`.. Go figure.\n\nNow the album that Watson’s not disownin' is From The Cradle To The Grave on his new label Hyena Records. Here he’s slidin' off of Paycheck's barstool and into Johnny cash territory. Watson’s voice booms out like the voice of God over top of the Luther Perkins- Marshall Grant boom-chicka-boom style pickin and Watson’s phrases are punctuated by spare Cash-style horns. The album was even recorded at Johnny Cash’s old cabin in Hendersonville, Tennessee - now owned by Watson’s friend Johnny Knoxville. Watson claims that he went there without any songs to record “and basically wrote ten songs in ten days”. And he came up with songs about a child murder, suicide, revenge, killin' your ol’ lady, facin' the electric chair and even the end of the world. There’s also one about Johnny Cash. I get the impression that Watson set out to make a serious record… and he did. Just one note: I listened to his song “Yellow Mama” over & over and I didn’t know what the hell it was about. Then I read his press release explain that “Yellow Mama” is the nickname of Alabama’s bright yellow painted electric chair. Now it makes sense, but it would have been nice if Watson woulda explained that in the song (or at least in the liner notes). Or maybe this ol’ honky-tonk singer is tryin' to go cryptic on us … Anyway what we have here is one album rushed in the studio.. And one rushed in writin' … hmm .. I like ‘em both, but I tell you I’ve been spendin' a lot more time listenin to The Little Darlin` Session with its songs that have damn sure stood the test of time. © 2007 Billy Tom Hogg\n\nDave Gross / Take The Gamble / Swingnation Records SNCD 388006\n\nThis is Dave Gross’ second CD, produced by the great Duke Robillard in “Duke’s Mood Room”. Duke picks only the best musicians to back up this talented young guitar pickin’ Blues singer  Duke himself lends his chops to three songs, Dennis Gruenling on harmonica on 4 songs, Dona Oxford plays piano and organ and half the songs feature horns. “Take The Gamble” has a vintage feel to it and incorporates a lot of Swing, a little New Orleans Blues, Country and Chicago style Blues, guitar driven old-school R&B and more. The strong good-time starter “She Walks Right In” is a rompin’ Gatemouth Brown swinging rocker, get your dancing shoes! One of 9 Dave Gross originals follows and I simply love his wit in “Mess On My Plate” with lines like “I Forgot To Leave You Baby”. It has that groovy New Orleans vibe with great piano and saxophone. A Chicago style 6-minute Blues follows, then a slow burning musical tribute to T-Bone Walker called “I’m So Hungry Blues”. A straight vintage style Swing (the original “Swingin’ On All Six”) and a Hot Lips Page tune are next. “That’s All You Get” and “Movin’ On Down The Line” are two modern Blues numbers, the aforementioned on the funky side with organ and both feature electric bass instead of the upright that dominates the album. The slow shuffle “You Ain’t Playing Me No More” is a fine Country Blues example, T-Bone Walker’s humorous “I Know Your Wig Is Gone” swings and the classic “After Your Gone” is as good as any great 30s style Swing number. I dig the hoppin’ Country number with a galoppin’ “Mystery Train” kinda groove on “Once I Had A Girl”. Dave Gross mentions he enjoyed the chicken pickin’ on his tele here (most other songs feature a vintage Gibson). Closing out the set is a more contemporary slow swamp Blues. Sound and mix are simply perfect, Dave Gross is a fine singer and guitarist and overall it’s a well-rounded album that fans of vintage style Blues and Swing will enjoy. Personally I would have favored inclusions of a few more uptempo numbers like the lively opener or the irresistable New Orleans groove on my favorite here “Mess On My Plate”. Check it out. DaveGrossBand.com -GMB\n\nDavid Evans / Needy Time / Inside Sounds ISC-0532\n\nShouldn’t it say “Dr.” David Evans? He’s a noted Blues scholar and teacher who also has performed and recorded with folks like Hammie Nixon, Johnnie Shines, Robert Balfour and others. We enjoyed a previous Jugband CD that featured Evans, and indeed this new one has some tracks with that kind of lineup, as on “Adam & Eve In The Garden Of Eden,” but also everything from solo guitar and vocal and other accompaniments such as harmonica, fiddle, mandolin, banjo etc. But several have fuller jug bands. In fact Nixon appears on “Bottle Up And Go,” and the late Alan “Blind Owl” Wilson appears on 2 tracks. Several tunes are Evans' own, but he also draws from Tommy McClennan (“Highway 51”), Sleepy John Estes (“Brownsville Blues”), Big Joe Williams (“Baby Please Don’t Go”), and Wilson (“On The Road Again”, written with Floyd Jones  an electric track with Billy Gibson on harmonica). The Blind Owl tracks date from ’64 and ’67, and the Nixon track is from ’79. Personally, I think that street Blues scene from Memphis has been a larger influence on Rockabilly and also the Chicago Blues sound than it seems to get credit for. Of course radio was the great cross pollinator, but groups like this were on public display in Handy Park throughout the youth of Elvis and other Memphis based Rockabillies. And Memphis was the hub of the Delta too. David Evans represents that sound well on this CD, and the others he has done as well. Insidesounds.com -MB\n\nRoadracers / Roadrage\n\nFull blast Rockabilly is what the Roadracers do best! Ricky Nelson’s “Believe What You Say” gets made into a raspy voiced wild rocker with sizzling guitar interesting transformation! Most songs here are originals and I dig their cool “Roadrage”, the aggressive opener “No Fool” and the gallopin’ “Trouble Hound”. “My Way” is head on Rock’n’Roll with piano and saxophone and yes, that’s the vintage Eddie Cochran number! Every song here is hot and rockin’, the hip shakin’ bluesy “New Shoes”, the shuffle “Rock’n’Roll Ship with great piano and all the Rockabillies and hot Rock’n’Roll numbers. The Roadracers end the 13-piece romp with a hard hitting drinking song “This Is What I Drink”. Explosive Rockabilly with a hot rhythm section, sizzling lead guitar and a raspy voiced, often shouting leadsinger who know how to rock out! GMB\n\nDi Maggio Brothers / When I Hit My Stride\n\nItaly’s premier rockin’ brothers are back with an excellent album. Marco Di Maggio is known for his impressive guitar skills and … is an skilled singer with a fine, deep baritone voice. Among them they play every instrument on this 15-song album. Slappin’ bass, sizzling lead guitar, drums, rhythm guitar  an exciting sound, based on late '50s Rockabilly / Rock’n’Roll but unmistakenly modern. Weirdly enough they start their set with a hit from the disco era, a makeover of the somewhat annoying “Born To Be Alive” from 1979. Don’t worry, it’s Rockabilly now! The title Track “When I Hit My Stride” is a hard hitting rocker complete with Paul Burlison style fuzz guitar work, cool! “A Date With Fate” is a sweet sounding rock-a-ballad, “Blue Refrain” with its wonderful guitar work and brotherly harmonies is very much reminiscent of the Everly Brothers mellower hits. Among the many Di Maggio Brothers originals is a fine cover of Cash’s “I Walk The Line”. “If You Want Me To” could be a Junior Brown track, fancy guitar work, and that certain '60s Honky Tonk sound, very cool! Buddy Holly’s beautiful “Raining In My Heart” is faster than the original, but maybe it’s the speedy and extra fancy picking that makes me think so. The '60s come alive with a real cool Twist-rocker “Latin Nights”. “A Lotta Swing”, reminds me a little of Gene Vincent and High Noon. “I Got Stung” is of course an RCA Elvis hit and the Di Maggio do a great job and you can tell that’s pretty much the sound they’re successfully aiming for! More melodic rockers follow and last but not least a fingerpicking instrumental named after their late dad ”Bruno”. A great album filled with mostly originals with an exceptionally good sound and production, exciting guitar work and fine vocals. GMB\n\nJussi Syren Rockabilly Revival / Stayin’ On Top Of The Beat / Goofin’ GRCD 8137\n\nHere’s another Finnish Rockabilly trio, this one with lead guitar, slap bass and drums and a singer (Jussi Syren) who has that southern accent down, including that ultra cool “hot potato in your mouth” style. I enjoy every song here, a total of 13 and five of them Jussi Syren originals that include one of my favorites, an intense, slow and very cool “Chichamauga Jeanie”. Hypnotic the opener “Down At Bradley’s Bar”, real fine the tribute to Carl Perkins “Rockabilly Guitar Man”. When bands split their releases between '50s scene classics and originals there is a pretty good chance that their own material can’t hold up. Not here! Strong songs/lyrics complete with great melodies, passionate musicianship and an absolutely great sound make these originals a lasting contribution to Rockabilly legacy. Yes, the covers are top notch, too. Benny Joy’s mega hot bopper “Steady With Betty”, Charlie Feathers’ classic “Bottle To The Baby”, the wild slappin’ “Imitation Of The Blues” with cool guitar licks, or Jimmie Skinner’s Hillbilly lament “Baby You Don’t Know My Mind” and Eddie Bond’s full blast “Slip Slip Slippin’ In”  cool stuff, great rockers that are never short on melody. Carl Perkins’ fine early Country effort “Sure To Fall” is followed by the forceful and haunting Neo-Rockabilly style of “Hank’s Nightmare” with a gallopin’ beat and repetitive guitar licks. Great album, highly recommended. Goofinrecords.com. -GMB\n\nJessie Lee Miller / Waiting\n\nJessie Lee Miller has one of those dreamy and sweet and at the same time sultry voices perfectly suited for sexy barroom ballads  but that’s not all she does. It seems impossible to escape her magic once you pop this 13-track album in your CD player. It kept me hitting the play button over and over again instead of sitting down to finally write the review. Six numbers are her own and they range from sweet ballads to rockers and vintage style Honky Tonk to Blues and oldtimey Jazz. “Runaround” is a cool, slow swingin’ bluesy song that includes Cindy Cashdollar taking the lead on dobro. Jessie Lee Miller’s beautiful voice is always the most important instrument, making every song her own, like the upbeat “Loved By You” with its exotic beat and a trumpet lead. I especially love the hot Honky Tonk material here, the rocker “Good Lookin’ No Good” and Sean Mencher’s fine “I’m Yours, You’re Mine”, and “When You Said Hello”, wonderful two-step material, too. “Shameless Tomorrow” is Jessie Lee’s own convincing Hillbilly effort with slappin’ bass and Johnny Cash style guitar work, while her “Hard To Admit” features upright bass, a bluesy guitar solo and just a snare played with brushes. Overall a great release with a vintage feel and a voice you won’t forget. Every song possesses charm and is superbly supported by a strong cast of first rate musicians. The recording quality and the packaging are excellent, too. “Waiting” puts Jessie Lee Miller on the map. GMB\n\nThe Astrophonix / Suspended Time Thunderball TR2007-1/AP0C7\n\nLast time I heard young Simone Di Maggio (yes, related to the Di Maggio Brothers) he was playing straight Rockabilly, now he heads the Italian Surf-Rock band The Astrophonix. He’s just as talented as the rest of the musical family, strong on lead guitar, a fine singer and he co-wrote all but one of the 10 tracks here. The trio (guitar, drums, bass) puts out an astonishingly full soundwall. You can hear all kinds of hard hitting '60s beats, Surf, Psychobilly and Punk influences but their style is unmistakenly modern and very forceful. “Guitar Maddness” is a close as we get to a sizzling Rockabilly instro-rocker. Do you remember Annie Lennox and Stewart’s '80s Pop hit “Sweet Dreams”, well here you get the sped up hard rockin’ version with twangy and fuzz-guitar. If you like energetic, full blast guitar heavy modern Surf-Rock, check out the Astrophonix. GM\n\nHot Roddin’ Romeos\n\nThis demo shows Bellingham’s quartet Hot Roddin’ Romeos rock with vintage classics and some new Rockabillies. Their aggressive opener has sizzling guitar, and a Psychobilly edge. “Six Inch Heels And Dynamite” is a real strong rocker, powerful delivered. “Red Hot” is cool, and the Stray Cats “Rock This Town” is a real good remake, I dig that song. A cool lo-fi rocker follows that raps up this pretty good demo. The Hot Roddin’ Romeos with Johnny Rocket’s raspy lead vocals and Killer Kate on drums just formed in 2007 and are planning on recording a full length album soon. In the meantime you can catch their energetic performances live in the Seattle/Western Washington area.

In their quest for proof of this, they recruit a Jewish Elvis impersonator who calls himself Schmelvis, and a rabbi from Toronto, and head for Memphis. The premise promises more fun than the finished product delivers, though there are many funny moments. The main problem is in the bickering amongst the participants along the way, which maybe is supposed to be funny, perhaps if you yourself are Jewish, but is just very annoying if you’re not. The other big problem is that Schmelvis refuses to perform at an Elvis karaoke event because he won’t work without his guitar (so let him play it doing karaoke already!). Then, when in desperation they fly back to Memphis (after visiting Israel, and being informed by Hassidic Jews swimming in the Dead Sea that a Jewish Elvis impersonator is a sign the Messiah is coming), Schmelvis is to participate in an Elvis impersonator contest, but also ends up not performing. In that case the organizer, who happened also to be the veterinarian who treated Elvis’ monkey (which died of cirrhosis of the liver), demanded that there be no religious statements or political statements made. They also didn’t want Elvis being made fun of, and the Schmelvis persona has a comic name at least, regardless that I see no disrespect inherent in it. We do get to see him sing a couple times, and he turns out to be a fairly good guitar player as well. Performance-wise, when Schmelvis sings to a group of Palestinian kids near the huge Elvis statue at a truck stop which is the second most popular tourist attraction in Israel (!!!), it’s the best dose we’re going to get of his performing, and kind of a heartwarming moment. But the bottom line is that Elvis being Jewish is a non-issue for nearly everyone who isn’t Jewish. These guys apparently expected to engender anti-Semitism in Memphis by going around saying Elvis was Jewish, and didn’t really come close. I think they pretty much would have had to find a Klan meeting to make it real. They should maybe have gone to Vegas for the impersonator contest. For Elvis fans the best thing may be the interviews with neighbors of Elvis from when he was 15, and with one with one of the Lansky Brothers. Schmelvis.com MB\n\nDestination Vegas Elvis Weinerworld MVDV 4651\n\nThis somewhat schizophrenic DVD seems to want it both ways: it’s alternately worshiping of Elvis and thoroughly sarcastic about his later work and drug problem. I’ll say this, it’s probably not possible to sound more sarcastic than with an English accent, as with the narrator of this. The majority of meaty clips are ones you might already have from the ‘50s TV appearances, which I guess are now “out of copyright” in Europe. The clip of “Tutti Frutti” has frames missing in places. The Vegas footage is all home movie stuff, usually with sound recordings of different performances than what you see, with Elvis talking to the audience. While this purports to be a documentary about Elvis’ Vegas years, it actually covers the whole of his career, though not certainly any better than others already out there. One thing it has that others may not is in the “extras”, a series of photos a few of which I’d seen, but most of which are audience snapshots from Vegas performances, in which you can see a wide variety of Elvis’ stage costumes. The other extra is more of the home movies with different soundtracks to what is happening on the stage in the pictures. Elvis rambles about his early career, and raves about people who had spread inaccurate word about his drug problems, and makes specific threats towards whoever that was. MVDVsual.com -MB\n\nRed Meat / We Never Close / Ranchero Records 0701\n\nSan Francisco honky-tonkers Red Meat have been packin' them into the Bay area bars and clubs for a few years now and their tight sound comes from many nights letting loose on their mix of mostly self-written songs. Produced by Dave Alvin, who also produced their last album 2001's Alameda County, he gets the best out of the band both in a well recorded sound and choice of songs. Red Meat are Smelly Kelley (great name!) (vocals), Scott Young (vocals, guitar, trombone) Jill Olson (vocals, bass) Michael Mantalta (guitars, accordion) and Lea Jamea (drums, percussion, vocals) other musicians lending a hand include Doug Livingston (pedal steel, piano) and Rick Shea (guitar, mandolin). You can smell the saw-dust on the floor! with the opener \"Honky Tonk Habit\" with great guitar riffs and is a whole lotta' fun. Jill Olson contributes some good songs including bar room ballad \"I'm Not The Girl For You\" and the rowdy \"Queen Of King City\". So all of the songs tell familiar tales of drinking, women and having a great time (nothing wrong in that), but Red Meat do inject something new with superb playing throughout mixing hot shuffles, Country swingers and Rock 'n' Roll. They probably come over even better live, but this will do for now! Ranchero Records, 4200 Park Blvd, Oakland, CA 94602 -Rick Meek\n\nOmar Kent Dykes & Jimmie Vaughan / On The Jimmy Reed Highway / Ruf 1122\n\nWhen I was working in Hamburg in the early '60s the German audiences couldn't get enough of Jimmy Reed songs and our hourly set list always included \"Baby What You Want Me To Do\" and \"Bright Lights Big City\". Here vocalist Omar Kent Dykes and guitarist Jimmie Vaughan team up in a great album of Reed songs, not all of them familiar, but every one reminding us what a genius he was, often overlooked because his laid back vocal style hid his many talents as a songwriter. Omar doesn't try to recreate, he couldn't because his gruff and rough vocals bear no resemblance to Reed's smooth delivery, but somehow it works. The backing band has some of Austin's top guys Derek O'Brien (guitar), Ronnie James (bass), Wes Starr and George Rains (drums) with guests Kim Wilson, Delbert McClinton, James Cotton, Lou Ann Barton, Gary Primich and Gary Clark Jr all contributing to make this one of the best Blues albums of the year. Their are two originals by Omar that begin and end the album. The first is dedicated to the late Clifford Antone, both songs avoid any sentimental sweetness and fit in well with the rest of Reed's songs. I should add that Jimmie Vaughan's often understated guitar playing is a key factor in making this collection of songs come to life for a new generation that will hopefully seek out Jimmy Reed once more. -Rick Meek www.rufrecords.de\n\nOrder our Latest Issue!\n\nAnd read the rest of the current reviews!\n\nTracy Nelson / You'll Never Be A Stranger At My Door Memphis International DOT 0219\n\nTracy Nelson is a Blues belter of formidable power and vocal range and over the years has given us some classic albums detailing her talent. You'll Never Be A Stranger At my Door is Tracy's homage to some Country classics, where Blues meet Country without her loosing any of her trademark growl and delivery. You could almost imagine her singing these songs in the bath! because they are great songs that she obviously loves to sing. \"Cow Cow Boogie\" is a jazzy opener. \"Four Walls\" (the Jim Reeves chestnut) and Johnny Cash's \"I Still Miss Someone\" fit perfectly into Nelson's plan of what makes these country gems sound great. Most of the songs are from long ago, but Randy Sharp's \"New Way Out\", an '80s single by Karen Brooks is mesmerising given the Tracy Nelson treatment. The only let down for me was the old Browns '50s hit \"The Three Bells\", it sounded mawkish and downright crass back then, even Nelson can't bring this back to life. With sensitive backing by multi-instrumentalist Fred Kaplin, guitarist Robert M Britt, Steve Conn on piano and accordion, plus Guy Clark and Alice Newman Vestal (vocals on \"Salt Of The Earth\") this is Country delivered Tracy Nelson style and I love it all the more for that! -Rick Meek www.memphisinternational.com\n\nDavid Olney / One Tough Town / Red Parlor 00705\n\nDavid Olney has been writing unique and biting lyrics for years. His songs have been recorded by many, including Emmylou Harris, whose versions of \"Deeper Well' and \"Jerusalem Tomorrow\" are classic. Olney comes from the timeless Texan songwriter tradition of Towns Van Zandt, Eric Taylor and Vince Bell. Olney is perhaps the bluesiest of the bunch with a deep growl of a voice and masterful technique of acoustic guitar playing. His songs, always varied with clever wordplay and firmly rooted in acoustic Blues and Jazz background. Case in point is the wonderful \"Who's The Dummy Now\" written from the dummy's view of malice and spite of his controlled existence. \"Panama City\" blends Caribbean rumba and tequila rhythms with laidback guitar and vocals while \"Sweet Potato\" is downright Dixie with tuba and clarinet backing. There is one Van Zandt song \"Snake Song\" which Olney delivers with a sparse reverence of just himself and Sergio Webb's guitar as backing. If you like your music acoustic with songs full of dark humor, often funny sometimes sad, Olney is the man for you! www.RedParlor.com -Rick Meek\n\nMuddy Waters, Johnny Winter & James Cotton / Breakin it UP, Breakin’ it DOWN / Epic 07283 2)\n\nAfter making 1977’s Hard Again, these three went on tour to promote it, and now you can hear what that sounded like. The rest of the band included Pinetop Perkins, Bob Margolin, Willie “Big Eyes” Smith and Charles Calmese. Hard Again was Muddy’s album, but this one belongs to all 3, and it’s best moments may be when they are jamming, pushing and playing with each other. It’s got to be a show many of you would like to have been at, along with myself. They recorded 3 nights and took the best for this new CD. There’s a great picture of the 3 principles just inside the booklet, along with Margolin’s notes and a few other pictures from the shows. Legacyrecordings.com -MBSchmelvis / VSC SCH1638\n\nSixtyeight Twentyeight: The Life and Times of a Texas Writer and a Flat Top Box Guitar by Vince Bell A vincebell.com book\n\nFirst of all, this is a book for musicians. If you've never been up there pickin' in front of a barroom crowd - you probably don't want to read this. But if you have - you probably do. In 'Sixtyeight Twentyeight’ Texas songwriter-picker-singer Vince Bell gives us brief glimpses of his life in music starting with him buyin' his first good guitar - a 1968 Martin D-28 acoustic (hence the title). In '71 he's startin' as a solo act playin' to crowds of 8 people in run-down Houston barrooms. He tells of bein' on the bottom rung of the musical food chain - an Opening Act - and of his strange encounters with Headliners like Townes and Delbert and Doug Sahm's band. He's played bars all over Texas and he's done the National Coffeehouse Circuit. He's played songwriter showcases with Lyle Lovett, Guy Clark, Willis Allen Ramsey, and Steve Fromholz. He's played Austin City Limits, Mountain Stage, and Europe. And he's had a car wreck that almost did him in. And he had to re-learn how to do anything musical. He's had troubles with a small Texas record company (Watermelon) and with an affiliate of a giant (Paladin/Warner). And most recently he's been puttin' out his own stuff on the Internet, cuttin' out the middle men and probably even relaxin' a little. Of course there's some technical stuff for us pickers: like learnin' to deal with his singin' voice gettin' lower as he gets older, by tunin' his guitar down a whole step and switchin' to bigger gauge strings. But above and beyond everything else, this book is the love story between Vince Bell and the one guitar that he played for over 30 years - the one guitar that he was with \"for several lifetimes\" - the one he got at age 19. You don't even have to know Vince Bell's music to appreciate this book. Bell squeezes 59 chapters of his life into 171 pages, so it's really quick readin'. Hell, I read it cover-to-cover while I was tendin' my roadside stand on Memorial Day. But I'll tell you one thing: there's a surprise ending here that hit me hard and kinda left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not gonna blow it for you, so you might want to check it out yourself. -vincebell.com 7 Avenida Vista Grande, #237, Sante Fe, New Mexico 87508 © 2007 Billy Tom HoggDestination Vegas Elvis\n\nJames Harman / Takin' Chances / Cannonball Records CBD 29107\n\nAlthough they didn't send me any booklet or notes with this CD, I don't need any more words on it than \"James Harman\" to know it's gonna be somewhere between really good and truly great. This one, with an ongoing theme of gambling, is at the latter end of the spectrum. Harman just seems to have an unending fount of great tunes, all different, with great grooves to them, coupled with the best possible taste in how to present the music. Some writers complained when he departed slightly from his patented '50s sound for one CD, but it was a real good record, too. This one's a great one, guaranteed to please. Anyone who's heard this guy has to know he's one of the best! -MB\n\nFlattop Tom & His Jump Cats / Swing Dance Party / Palamar Records PR6178\n\nHere are Flattop Tom & His Jump Cats again with their gutsy Swing. Serious fun for dancers (well, Tom is a swing dancer himself and knows how to please a dance crowd) and Jump Blues fans alike. They've been around for six years now and this is their third CD release. Packed with 17 songs we get to hear a few classics, among them Jackie Brenston's \"Rocket 88\" (some say that's when R&B became Rock'n'Roll!) and another of my all time favorites of that genre, the dynamic \"Don't Let Go\". Flattop Tom (Hall) himself is in charge of 10 songs - perfect examples of their very bluesy west coast swing style. And he plays harmonica as well (on most of the tracks), and this alone sets him apart from most competitors in the swing scene with bands who just got started in the last two or three years who present a more modern and rocking swing. Don't get me wrong, Flattop Tom and his L.A. based band rocks, too, but in a very bluesy way with an R&B horn section, bluesy guitar, piano, harp etc. I especially love their groovy mambos \"Jump Cat Mambo\" and \"Left Coast Carl's BBQ\". This is the right CD for Jump Blues fans. See the ad. -GM"
