        "text": "On Sunday at Monmouth Park, American Pharoah, the first Triple Crown winner since 1978, will race for the first time since winning the Belmont Stakes on June 8. If Pharoah wins, he’ll be the seventh Triple Crown winner to win his first race after capturing thoroughbred racing’s biggest prize.\n\nAmong the horses that won that first post-Triple Crown race is Secretariat, winner of the prize in 1973, who shipped out to Arlington Park near Chicago to capture the Arlington Invitational Stakes by nine lengths at the end of June that year.\n\nBut when he came back to New York, to Saratoga Race Course, the track over which he’d twice won races convincingly as a two-year-old in 1972, Secretariat’s run of seeming invincibility came to an end on August 4 1973 in the Whitney Handicap – at the hooves of a horse called, perhaps somewhat ignominiously, Onion.\n\nOnion was owned and bred by Hobeau farm’s Jack Dreyfus, founder of the Dreyfus Funds. The horse’s sire was a stakes winner, his mare a winner of five races from 11 starts, but his bloodlines didn’t exactly suggest that he had the pedigree to upset the horse that many observers said was the best they’d ever seen, the horse that set records in both the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont (later, a record in the Preakness was added, too), and who had captured the Triple Crown by an unheard-of 31 lengths.\n\nWhat Onion did have was a world-class Hall of Fame trainer in H Allen Jerkens, known affectionately as the Chief, and, though he always said he didn’t like it, the Giant Killer.\n\nJerkens, known for knocking off big favorites – his Beau Purple, another Dreyfus horse, three times beat Kelso, a five-time horse of the year – was also fond of noting that “the check for second place isn’t so bad either.”\n\nBut he sensed vulnerability in Secretariat. He’d watched the champion work out at Saratoga and thoughtthe horse looked sluggish. When Onion, who was primarily a sprinter, set a track record winning a six-and-a-half furlong race on July 31, the elder Jerkens decided to take a shot.\n\n“Onion was a high-priced claiming or allowance horse,” said Jimmy Jerkens, Allen’s son, this week. “He’d had a good season the year before, and he’d won a couple of races in Saratoga. My father knew it was going to be a small field, and I remember him saying that he didn’t think Secretriat worked well.”\n\nThe Jerkens horse was little more than an afterthought as the town turned out to welcome the first Triple Crown winner since Citation in 1948, 25 years before. As the younger Jerkens remembers it, the colors of Meadow Stable, Secretariat’s owner, bedecked Broadway, Saratoga Springs’ main drag.\n\n“It was a big deal,” he said, that the Triple Crown winner was coming to town.\n\nA teenager then walking horses in his father’s barn, Jimmy watched the race from the backstretch after finishing up afternoon chores.\n\n“There was a tote board that obscured the view from about the 3/16 pole to a couple of yards before the wire,” he remembered. “The horses would disappear behind it.\n\n“I remember them going behind the tote board, and Onion was a half a length in front, and we knew by the time they’d come from out behind the tote board, back into sight, that Secretariat would be five lengths in front.\n\n“But he was running so good, and sure enough, they came out with only a few yards to go and he was that same half-length in front.”\n\n“We got to hopping and down and screaming to beat the band,” said Ralph Theroux, now a placing judge at the New York Racing Association (NYRA), which runs Saratoga Race Course, Belmont Park, and Aqueduct Racetrack. In 1973, he too was working in Jerkens’ barn, and like Jerkens’ son, he watched the race from the backstretch. “He was glorious in victory.”\n\n“They shouldn’t have run Secretariat,” said Sonny Taylor, then and now a NYRA placing judge. “He had a 102 temperature.”\n\n“But Jacinto’s a pretty crafty rider,” he went on, referring to jockey Jacinto Vasquez. “Secretariat tried to come up the inside and Jacinto trapped him on the rail.”\n\n“I had pretty good idea I could win the race,” Vasquez said this week. “Secretariat had never run inside; he always came around, and I made him come inside me that day.\n\n“I got him inside and crowded him back to the inside fence to keep him there, and around the 5/16 pole, I saw [Secretariat’s jockey Ron] Turcotte hit him [with the crop], and Secretariat never moved. I said, ‘I got this stakes race.’”\n\nJerkens’ only instruction to him that day?\n\n“’Get me a check,’” recalled Vasquez.\n\nAllan Carter, the historian at Saratoga’s National Museum of Racing and Hall of Face, was at the track that day and said he was “aghast” that Secretariat had gotten beaten.\n\n“We were stunned when it ended.”\n\nCarter wrote about the race in a book he co-authored, 150 Years of Racing in Saratoga, and realized that while Onion’s win has gone down as one of racing’s biggest upsets, the four-year-old horse was actually not an illogical choice. “He only went off at 9-2,” Carter pointed out. “He was an older horse, and four days before he’d set a track record.”\n\nBut, he added: “His biggest asset was Allen Jerkens.”\n\nJerkens died this past March after a short illness, a month shy of his 86th birthday. He was known for his emotional reactions to his horses’ success, but, said his son, Onion’s win was different.\n\n“He’d get emotional right after a race and then like a half hour after the race, he’d be on to something else,” Jimmy said. “But that day, he was in a daze, he really was.”\n\nLess than two months later, Jerkens beat Secretariat again, this time with Prove Out in the Woodward at Belmont. He might have hated the moniker “Giant Killer,” but he couldn’t deny it.\n\n“If I knew where to run my horses,” he used to like to say, with an impish grin and a twinkling eye, “Secretariat would have retired with two more wins.”"
