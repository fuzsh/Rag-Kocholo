        "text": "Much has been made about the final time and the quarter-mile fractions in American Pharoah’s Triple Crown winning Belmont Stakes. Comparisons are made because that is what horse racing fans and handicappers do on a day-to-day basis when we try and pick winners. Of course, we know that final times, separated by years or even generations, were dictated by the pace and the shape of those races and, most importantly, the track condition.\n\nAmerican Pharoah vs. Secretariat (1973)\n\nIn Secretariat’s Belmont Stakes victory he was pressed early on by his Kentucky Derby and Preakness rival, Sham. They ran in stride, head to head, for the first half-mile or so, prompting a very fast early pace. Once Big Red had dispatched Sham, he relaxed and the fractions slowed down. He opened up to the legendary 31-length lead and coasted to the finish line.\n\nOn the other hand, American Pharoah was able to quickly open an early one-length lead, relax, and produce amazingly consistent quarter mile splits that were all 24 and change and, aside from the first quarter, he got progressively faster throughout the race.\n\nIn the end, American Pharoah’s final time in the Belmont was the second fastest of all the Triple Crown winners, behind only Secretariat.\n\nAmerican Pharoah vs. Seattle Slew (1977)\n\nSeattle Slew, the only undefeated horse to win the Triple Crown, ran his Belmont Stakes on a slow MUDDY track. Seattle Slew went to lead immediately and opening up a quick and easy one-length lead. From there he was able to keep the field at bay and then extend his lead to a final margin of four lengths. His victorious trip was very similar to that of American Pharoah in both style and ease.\n\nAmerican Pharoah vs. Affirmed (1978)\n\nHere, too, Affirmed broke from the gate and went right to the lead opening up to a comfortable one-length lead. He was able to control the pace and click off two very slow 25 second quarter miles to start the race. When Alydar came up to challenge Affirmed on the outside, the pace quickened. Following the three fastest quarters of the race, determination would win out over speed as the two career rivals battled head-to-head down the stretch. The final quarter of :25.2 was the slowest, yet most exciting of the race.\n\nIn the end through similarities and differences, American Pharoah's time and performance fits right in with three of the greatest horses from the 1970's, which has often been called the Golden Decade of Racing."
