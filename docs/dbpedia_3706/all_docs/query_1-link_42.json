        "text": "We launched March Sadness on Monday and it’s been incredible to see how well the POZ alternative to March Madness has been going so far. Voting for the vote-in round will end on Sunday night before the Sad 16 begins, which is why we thought it’d be a great idea to release a “stat sheet” on all 20 bands selected with information on their careers and why they were picked for March Sadness. Vote here until Sunday night and make sure to check out stats on each band while reblogging with your comments below!\n\nBraid\n\nLifespan: 1993-1999, 2004, 2011-present\n\nMembers: Bob Nanna, Todd Bell, Chris Broach, Damon Atkinson\n\nAlbums: Frankie Welfare Boy Age Five, The Age Of Octeen, Frame And Canvas, Movie Music, Vol. 1 + 2, Lucky To Be Alive\n\nLabels: Divot Records, Mud Records Polyvinyl Records, Glue Factory Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nBraid may have not reached levels of success like The Get Up Kids or Jimmy Eat World, but the band left its mark on emo and indie-rock with its early releases, and most certainly Frame And Canvas. (ZZ)\n\nSee: Killing A Camera off Frame And Canvas\n\nThe Get Up Kids\n\nLifespan: 1995-2005, 2008-present\n\nMembers: Matt Pryor, Jim Suptic, Rob Pope, Ryan Pope, James Dewees\n\nAlbums: Four Minute Miles, Something To Write Home About, On A Wire, Guilt Show, There Are Rules\n\nLabels: Doghouse Records, Vagrant Records, Quality Hill Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nMajor players in the mid-1990s emo-takeover, these blue collar Kansas City natives took the punk approach to their association with the genre. Not only did they publically denounce the idea, they also detested it. Hell, Jim Suptic even went on the record to apologize for an contribution the band might have had in influencing the bands that would follow in their foot steps. However, there is no denying the thumbprint that the band left on the emo world. They helped put Vagrant Record on the map and fueled a sound that spread the nation like wildfire. They may not have intended to light the torch, but they certainly threw gasoline on the flame. (JH)\n\nSee: Holiday from Something to Write Home About\n\nJimmy Eat World\n\nLifespan: 1993-present\n\nMembers: Jim Adkins, Tom Linton, Zach Lind (guitars), Rick Burch\n\nAlbums: Static Prevails, Clarity, Bleed American, Futures, Chase This Light, Invented\n\nLabels: Capitol Records, Dreamworks, Interscope Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nWith a sound embedded in raw and vunerable lyrics and hook as infectious as they come, Jimmy Eat World strikes hard as the most approachable and embraced band on this list. With Bleed American (i.e. self-titled) snagging airplay in ever major market (and many smaller markets) the band took over the world and broken the hearts of everyone in their way. With well over 2 million album sales, they without question took emo to the bigger stage and larger scale. (JH)\n\nSee: Hear You Me from Bleed American\n\nThe Promise Ring\n\nLifespan: 1995-2002, 2005, 2011-2012\n\nMembers: Davey von Bohlen, Jason Gnewikow , cott Beschta, Dan Didler\n\nAlbums: 30˚ Everywhere, Nothing Feels Good, Very Emergency, wood/water\n\nLabels: Jade Tree Records, ANTI- Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nNothing Feels Good proved to be one of those records that helped define many of the bands around The Promise Ring, and helped put Jade Tree Records on the map for the label itself and the emo and hardcore bands that filled its roster. (ZZ)\n\nSee: Is This Thing On? from Nothing Feels Good\n\nSunny Day Real Estate\n\nLifespan: 1992-1995, 1997-2001, 2009\n\nMembers: Jeremy Enigk, Nate Mendel, William Goldsmith, Dan Hoerner\n\nAlbums: Diary, Sunny Day Real Estate, How It Feels To Be Something On, The Rising Tide\n\nLabels: Sub Pop Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nDiary to many is as important as Jimmy Eat World’s Clarity. Though there are so many emo bands not featured on March Sadness, Sunny Day Real Estate is one that could not be skipped over. (ZZ)\n\nSee: Seven from Diary\n\nBrand New\n\nLifespan: 2000-present\n\nMembers: Jesse Lacey, Vinnie Accardi, Garret Tierney, Brian Lane\n\nAlbums: Your Favorite Weapon, Deja Entendu, The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Me, Daisy\n\nLabels: Triple Crown Records, Razor & Tie Records, Interscope Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nDeja Entendu translates as “already heard,” which is a little ironic (don’tcha think?) since most of us got totally floored by the maturity and originality behind the powerhouse record. Sure, Your Favorite Weapon, John-Nolan beef song and all, might be more snotty and angst-driven, but Deja Entendu quantum leaped Brand New up the emo scale. Poised, poetic, and brilliantly subtle, Deja Entendu set the gold standard for emo-injected alternative rock for much of the 2000s, at least until Brand New topped themselves in sadness and quality on The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me. (EV)\n\nSee: Me vs. Maradona. vs. Elvis from Deja Entendu\n\nDashboard Confessional\n\nLifespan: 1999-present\n\nMembers: Chris Carrabba\n\nAlbums: The Swiss Army Romance, The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most, A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar, Dusk And Summer, The Shade Of Poison Trees, Alter The Ending\n\nLabels: Fiddler Records, Vagrant Records, Interscope Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nThe Places You Have Come To Fear The Most sings sadness and despair, and Chris Carrabba is a man known for penning incredibly relatable songs of love, loss, and hope with both of his bands. (ZZ)\n\nSee: Screaming Infidelities from The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most\n\nSaves The Day\n\nLifespan: 1994-present\n\nMembers: Chris Conley, Arun Bali, Rodrigo Palma, Claudio Rivera\n\nAlbums: Can’t Slow Down, Through Being Cool, Stay What You Are, In Reverie, Sound The Alarm, Under The Boards, Daybreak\n\nLabels: Equal Vision Records, Dreamworks, Vagrant Records, Razor & Tie Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nOn Through Being Cool, Saves The Day were sneering pop-punk brats with desperate teenage anthems and a whole lot of confidence. Two years later, the band released one of emo’s seminal records, Stay What You Are. Before Chris Conley’s voice jumped an octave and the band veered into experimental concept records, Saves The Day spun some of the saddest songs us millenials grew up with. Try to get through “At Your Funeral” or “Nightingale” without a box of tissues: I dare you.

But it’s that bleeding-heart honesty that made John Nolan and Adam Lazzara household names for the emo crowd. Taking Back Sunday would eventually make the jump to straight-up, no-holds-barred rock ‘n’ roll, but we’ll remember them most fondly for penning venting confessionals like Tell All Your Friends and Where You Want to Be.

Thursday were one of the most influential emo/post-hardcore bands in the early and mid-2000’s. It would be difficult not to find their touch on other bands in a similar genre from the past few years.

Ben Jorgensen and co had a gift of writing emotionally hard-hitting songs in a way rarely seen in any genre. (ZZ)\n\nSee: Car Underwater from What To Do When You Are Dead\n\nThe Early November\n\nLifespan: 1999-2007, 2011-present\n\nMembers: Ace Enders, Joe Marro, Sergio Anello, Jeff Kummer, Bill Lug\n\nAlbums: The Room’s Too Cold, The Mother, The Mechanic, And The Path, In Currents\n\nLabels: Drive-Thru Records, Rise Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nWe noted from the start that classifying “emo” at all is a tricky game in itself because there are so mark forks in its genre-road. The mid-2000’s saw a more aggressive path (Hawthorne Heights) while taking also a more mellow path (The Early November). The Early November exemplified what being an emo band on Drive-Thru meant with classics like “Sunday Drive” and “Ever So Sweet.” (ZZ)\n\nSee: Sunday Drive from For All Of This EP\n\nHawthorne Heights\n\nLifespan: 2001-present\n\nMembers: JT Woodruff, Micah Carli, Matt Ridenour, Eroc Bucciarelli\n\nAlbums: The Silence In Black And White, If Only You Were Lonely, Fragile Future, Skeletons\n\nLabels: Victory Records, Wind-Up Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nIt’s hard not to mention emo’s growth in the middle 2000’s without reciting “Cut my wrists and black my eyes” in the same breath. While fans of the genre roll their eyes at Hawthorne Heights’ “Ohio Is For Lovers” angsty poetry, the band brought emo back to an enormous mainstream scale with The Silence in Black and White. Chances are, middle-school you didn’t mind belting the words to “Saying Sorry,” and neither did hundreds of thousands of other sad sacks.

(ZZ)\n\nSee: Inhabit from Reality’s Coming Through\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nLifespan: 2001-present\n\nMembers: Gerard Way, Mikey Way, Frank Iero, Ray Toro\n\nAlbums: I Bought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, The Black Parade, Danger Days\n\nLabels: Eyeball Records, Reprise Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nMy Chem’s outspoken frontman Gerard Way called the band’s emo classification “bullshit.” On the flip side, to deny My Chemical Romance’s emo leanings would be just as bullshit. Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge and I Brought You My Bullets, Your Brought Me Your Love are prerequisite listens for emo fans. The Black Parade, while stepping away from emo in favor for a pomp-and-circumstance-heavy arena rock album, is probably the genre’s most important concept record.

(ZZ)\n\nSee: Echo from Separation\n\nDads\n\nLifespan: 2010-present\n\nMembers: John Bradley, Scott Scharinger\n\nAlbums: American Radass (this is important)\n\nLabels: Flannel Gurl Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nThough the Kinsella brothers couldn’t scrape a spot in the March Sadness brackets, their kindred spirits in twinkly guitars and self-deprecating lyrics might be New Jersey’s dynaming duo, Dads. Rifle through the tracklisting, and tongue-in-cheek song names and punny witticisms (“Bakefast at Piffany’s,” “Honestly, Chrome Q & A”) abound, but John Bradley and Scott Scharinger craft gems with heartbreaking guitar riffs and longing vocals.

Over It.\n\nLifespan: 2009-present\n\nMembers: Evan Weiss\n\nAlbums: Proper\n\nLabels: No Sleep Records, Topshelf Records\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nThe Evan Weiss songbook might be one of emo’s most comprehensive: honestly, any one of Weiss’s projects might’ve earned a bracket spot. But Into It. Over It. is especially ambitious (not to mention tugging at the ole’ heartstrings). Into It. Over It’s discography boasts a record with a song for every week of the year (52 Weeks) and a travel diary set to plaintive guitar and nostalgic lyrics (Twelve Towns). Weiss sounds like the pal you get drunk at the bar with, swapping sad stories, and he’s become a real emo everyman.

It’s hard to deny that songs on his first LP and his second masterpiece, Dig Up The Dead, are not some of the best sad songs you’ve heard in recent memory. The man writes songs that cut deep, even too deep. (ZZ)\n\nSee: Call Me When It’s Over off Dig Up The Dead\n\nThe World Is A Beautiful Place&IANLATD\n\nLifespan: 2009-present\n\nMembers: David Bello, Josh Cyr, Derrick Shanholtzer-Dvorak, Greg Horbal, Steven Buttery, Chris Teti, Katie Shanholtzer-Dvorak, Katie Shanholtzer-Dvorak\n\nAlbums: Are Here To Help You\n\nLabels: Topshelf Records, Count Your Lucky Stars\n\nWhy They’re In March Sadness:\n\nWhat happens when the aching poignancy of emo french kisses the haunting, ethereal instrumentals of post-rock? You get The World is a Beautiful Place, a band with its unlikely brand of emo down to a science. Everything feels cautiously layered — keyboards, gang vocals, the occasional horns — and the band puts as much painstaking care into its explosive choruses as it does into its breathtakingly stunning buildups.
