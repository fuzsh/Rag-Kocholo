        "text": "Congratulations to Alexandera Houchin, who successfully completed the arduous 800-mile Arizona Trail Race last night, establishing fresh women’s singlespeed records for both the AZT800 and the Triple Crown Challenge. Learn more and find photos from the finish here…\n\nPhotos by Wyatt Spalding\n\nJust before 9 p.m. yesterday evening, Alexandera Houchin reached the northern terminus of the 806-mile Arizona Trail and broke her own record from last year’s event. According to Trackleaders, she finished with a time of 10 days, 13 hours, and 36 minutes (10d:13h:36m) and shattered her previous record by over two full days!\n\nThere’s a reason that this headline seems all too familiar. This remarkable feat marked Alexandera’s third time riding in the full 800-mile event across the state and the third year in the row with a record-breaking feat on the Arizona Trail. Notably, she had previously established records on the 300-mile route in 2021 (2d:19h:25m), surpassing the former singlespeed record set by Alice Drobna back in 2015 (3d:10h:30m). In an incredible display of determination, Alexandera returned to the trail later that same year for the fall grand depart and set a new women’s singlespeed record on the AZT800 (15d:16h:11m). Then, last year, Alexandera finished it in 12 days, 16 hours, and 38 minutes (12d:16h:38m). As we dot-watched over the last week, it was easy to see that Alexandera was on pace to do it again this year. This is clearly her race.\n\nWhat’s even more remarkable is that Alexandera’s accomplishment comes on the heels of her impressive finish at this year’s Tour Divide (18 days, 18 hours, and 26 minutes) and her win in the women’s singlespeed category at the 2023 Colorado Trail Race (5 days, 14 hours, and 31 minutes). This achievement makes Alexandera the second cyclist to complete the Triple Crown Challenge this year, an extraordinary feat reserved for riders who conquer the Tour Divide, the Colorado Trail, and the full Arizona Trail Race in a single season, participating in each of these three prestigious events during their respective grand departs.\n\nNot only that, but Alexandera set a new women’s singlespeed Triple Crown Challenge record by completing all three races in a total time of 34 days, 22 hours, and 33 minutes (34d:22h:33m), reducing the previous record held by Alice Drobna (36 days, 6 hours, and 56 minutes) by nearly a day and a half. Alice’s record had remained unbroken for almost a decade. Andrew Strempke holds the current overall singlespeed record of 34 days, 7 hours, and 2 minutes (34h:07h:02m), which he set in 2022.\n\nCongrats on another inspiring ride, Alexandera!
