With that in mind, I‚Äôm opening a fast numbers set with a Stones‚Äô rocker not from Some Girls (that‚Äôs just what you‚Äôd be expecting üôÇ ) but from their 1989 release Steel Wheels. Then into some interconnected hard rock and metal for a Monday, finishing off with heavy psychedelia from Iron Butterfly. My track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1. The Rolling Stones, Hold Onto Your Hat\n\n2. Led Zeppelin, Achilles Last Stand\n\n3. Coverdale/Page, Absolution Blues\n\n4. Whitesnake, Take Me With You\n\n5. Rainbow, Stargazer\n\n6. Gillan, Don‚Äôt Want The Truth\n\n7. Black Sabbath, Warning\n\n8. Heaven & Hell, Double The Pain\n\n9. Judas Priest, Dissident Aggressor\n\n10. Fight, Little Crazy\n\n11. Iron Maiden, Powerslave\n\n12. Blue Oyster Cult, 7 Screaming Diz-Busters\n\n13. AC/DC, Kick You When You‚Äôre Down\n\n14. Van Halen, Pleasure Dome\n\n15. The Joe Perry Project, Rockin‚Äô Train\n\n16. MC5, Sister Anne\n\n17. Pantera, Cemetery Gates\n\n18. Brian May, Resurrection\n\n19. Iron Butterfly, Termination\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. The Rolling Stones, Hold Onto Your Hat . . . Bill Wyman was still in the Stones at the time of this rocker from 1989‚Äôs Steel Wheels album, Wyman‚Äôs last with the group, but he doesn‚Äôt play bass on it. Ron Wood, who played bass in the original Jeff Beck Group, handles the bottom end while Mick Jagger and Keith Richards trade guitar licks, with Charlie Watts on drums. That‚Äôs it, just the four guys, on a stripped-down ‚Äòbelter‚Äô as a music writer termed it, akin to, say, Rip This Joint from Exile On Main St. nearly two decades previous. I considered opening this hard-rocking set with Rip This Joint but have played that recently so I figured I‚Äôd go with something newer from the Stones although, time flying as it does, this song is already 35 years old (!?).\n\n2. Led Zeppelin, Achilles Last Stand . . . Epic opener to Zep‚Äôs 1976 album Presence, as we embark upon a series of songs released by artists who are all connected in one way or another.\n\n3. Coverdale/Page, Absolution Blues . . . From the one-off collaboration between Whitesnake (and onetime Deep Purple) singer David Coverdale and Zeppelin‚Äôs Jimmy Page, released in 1993. The collective wisdom at the time, which Page called BS but only Page really knows, was that Page partnered with Coverdale to tick Robert Plant off and push Plant into a Zeppelin reunion because the success of the Coverdale/Page album prompted rumours that a new Led Zeppelin, featuring Coverdale, Page, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham on his father John‚Äôs drum stool, would take flight. Plant, who to that point had rebuffed Page‚Äôs seemingly endless overtures to reunite (and good for Plant, I thought, move on, you know?), had been critical of Coverdale and Whitesnake, particularly the later 1980s glam/hair metal version of Whitesnake, for ripping off Plant‚Äôs vocal style and Led Zeppelin‚Äôs music. It‚Äôs an argument with some merit but is also a case of pot meeting kettle, given Zep‚Äôs own issues over the years in terms of plagiarism problems or, at best, borrowing. In any case, Page and Plant did reunite a year later, without Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, who was apparently miffed at not being invited, for the 1994 Page/Plant live album/MTV Unplugged film No Quarter: Unledded, featuring reinterpretations of Zep songs. And, later, for the 1998 Page/Plant studio album Walking Into Clarksdale and in 2007 the famous reunion concert, with John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham, at the O2 in London.\n\nAs for the Coverdale/Page album, it divided critics and likely some fans, but I‚Äôve always liked it, but then I like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and, certainly, earlier, more blues-rock Whitesnake. Coverdale has said there are a few unreleased tracks from the Coverdale/Page sessions that may see release at some point in an expanded version of the album.\n\n4. Whitesnake, Take Me With You . . . Speaking of early Whitesnake, this propulsive rocker is from that band‚Äôs first album, Trouble, released in 1978. White Snake, two words, was the name of Coverdale‚Äôs first solo record, released in 1977 after Deep Purple, Mark IV version with Tommy Bolin on guitar replacing Ritchie Blackmore who had formed Rainbow, broke up after the 1975 album Come Taste The Band. Along with Coverdale‚Äôs second solo effort, 1978‚Äôs Northwinds, White Snake the album was produced by Roger Glover, who had been the bass player in the pre-Coverdale days of Deep Purple (and is again now) when Ian Gillan, as he is now, was Purple‚Äôs lead singer before being replaced by Coverdale. Coverdale went on to name his band Whitesnake and Trouble included his former Deep Purple mate Jon Lord on keyboards, soon to be joined in early Whitesnake by Purple drummer Ian Paice for three studio albums ‚Äì Ready and Willin‚Äô (1980), Come An‚Äô Get It (1981) and Saints & Sinners (1982). Paice and Lord then departed for the 1984 reunion of the famed Mark II version of Purple ‚Äì Blackmore, Gillan, Lord, Paice and Glover ‚Äì and the Perfect Strangers (1984) and House Of Blue Light (1987) albums before another breakup and round round we go . . . Did I mention how these bands/artists are all connected? Or, perhaps better expressed, convoluted?\n\n5. Rainbow, Stargazer . . . And we‚Äôre not done yet with the wider Deep Purple population, which soon enough will bleed into Black Sabbath. But first, here‚Äôs Ritchie Blackmore and Rainbow, Ronnie James Dio on lead vocals, from the classic second Rainbow album, Rising, released in 1976.\n\n6. Gillan, Don‚Äôt Want The Truth . . . Here‚Äôs Ian Gillan, who from 1976 to early 1978 did a jazz fusion/progressive rock thing with The Ian Gillan Band. That group released good, interesting stuff over the course of three studio albums, like Clear Air Turbulence which I‚Äôve previously played on the show, before Gillan returned to hard rock with songs like Don‚Äôt Want The Truth from his band simply titled Gillan. The song is on the 1981 release Future Shock, one of five Gillan band studio albums through 1982 after which Ian Gillan joined Black Sabbath. Sabbath had just lost Dio (who after leaving Rainbow had replaced Ozzy Osbourne on lead vocals) to a solo career and had considered Robert Plant and David Coverdale, before settling on Gillan for what became his lone effort with Sabbath, the 1983 album Born Again. As the Robert Shaw character in the 1973 Paul Newman-Robert Redford movie The Sting was wont to say, ‚Äòya falla?‚Äù (follow).\n\n7. Black Sabbath, Warning . . . The original Black Sabbath ‚Äì Ozzy, Tony Iommi (guitar), Geezer Butler (bass) and Bill Ward (drums) ‚Äì from the self-titled first album, released in 1970. Warning is a cover of a late 1960s song by The Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation that Sabbath expanded from three minutes and change into a 10-minute epic. Dunbar, a drummer, has an extensive musical resume including stints with John Mayall‚Äôs Bluesbreakers and appearances or full band membership on albums by countless artists including Frank Zappa, David Bowie, Lou Reed, Ian Hunter, Journey, UFO, Michael Schenker and, them again, Whitesnake.\n\n8. Heaven & Hell, Double The Pain . . . Black Sabbath with Dio in all but name, Heaven And Hell the band ‚Äì Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice ‚Äì was named after the 1980 Sabbath album on which Ronnie James Dio first replaced Ozzy Osbourne, who went on to a hugely successful solo career, later to reunite with the original Sabbath members at various times although drummer Bill Ward has not been involved in recent years. Appice replaced Ward for the 1981 Mob Rules album and the 1992 Dio/Sabbath release Dehumanizer, and when that lineup came together to record three new songs for the 2007 compilaton Black Sabbath ‚Äì The Dio Years, the band went on tour as Heaven & Hell. They did so to fully differentiate themselves from the Ozzy-fronted Sabbath which by that point had reunited various times for concerts and eventually released a new studio album, 13, in 2013. Double The Pain is from Heaven & Hell‚Äôs lone studio release, The Devil You Know. It came out in 2009, a year before Dio died of cancer.\n\n9. Judas Priest, Dissident Aggressor . . . Early Priest, kick butt hard rock/metal from the 1977 album Sin After Sin, produced by Roger Glover in another one of those myriad connections within the set. I‚Äôm probably over-emphasizing it, there were similar connections among artists in an early rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll mostly 1950s set I played last Monday, Aug. 19, and such is true of any industry and it‚Äôs natural that there would be such cross-pollination within the hard rock/metal genre but I do find it interesting. And it‚Äôs why we have things like English music journalist/historian Peter Frame‚Äôs Rock Family Trees books, which were turned into a 1990s BBC TV series, and various similar books and websites. And going from a Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio song situation is a reminder that Judas Priest‚Äôs Rob Halford sang lead vocals for Black Sabbath at two 1992 shows in Costa Mesa, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Ozzy Osbourne, who had announced a retirement he didn‚Äôt follow up on, was playing there and asked Black Sabbath, then on their Dehumanizer tour fronted by Dio, to open for him. Dio refused and quit, and Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi asked Halford to fill in and he pulled off two Sabbath shows, opening for Ozzy. And then Sabbath‚Äôs musicians, sans Dio or Halford, backed Ozzy for an encore of Sabbath songs on the second night of his Costa Mesa dates.\n\n10. Fight, Little Crazy . . . Halford was available for those Sabbath shows in part because he had left Judas Priest to form his thrash metal band Fight, which in 1993 released its first of two studio albums, War of Words, from which I pulled this song. Halford returned to Priest ‚Äì which continued with Tim ‚ÄúRipper‚Äô Owens on lead vocals for two studio albums and several live releases ‚Äì in 2003. I saw the reunion tour with Halford in 2004 with Slayer, who covered Priest‚Äôs Dissident Aggressor on their 1988 album South of Heaven, opening an excellent double bill. Owens is now the lead singer in former Priest guitarist K.K. Downing‚Äôs band, KK‚Äôs Priest which has released two studio records in the last four years.\n\n11. Iron Maiden, Powerslave . . . Somewhat typical ‚Äògalloping‚Äô type of Iron Maiden cut, a 7-minute title track to the band‚Äôs 1984 album. It was one of many Maiden albums produced by the late Martin Birch. Birch was at the helm for all of Deep Purple‚Äôs 1970s albums in addition to the early Rainbow and Whitesnake albums and Black Sabbath‚Äôs Ronnie James Dio-fronted records Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules. And two albums ‚Äì Cultosaurus Erectus (1980) and Fire Of Unknown Origin (1981) featuring the hit single Burnin‚Äô For You ‚Äì by the next band in the set, Blue Oyster Cult.\n\n12. Blue Oyster Cult, 7 Screaming Diz-Busters . . . Birch wasn‚Äôt involved with the album from which this track comes, Tyranny and Mutation, BOC‚Äôs second record, released in 1973. Not sure how to describe this one but it‚Äôs typical of early BOC. Dark, great riffing, psychedelic in spots, mysterious and spooky in others, an intoxicating 7-minute (one for each titular scream, I suppose) listening experience in my opinion.\n\n13. AC/DC, Kick You When You‚Äôre Down . . . As someone on YouTube commented, tasty riff. Hypnotic, irresistible shake and shimmy. From the band‚Äôs most recent album, the 2020 release PWR/Up. Recorded at The Warehouse studio in Vancouver, owned by Bryan Adams and where AC/DC has cut its last four studio releases. Other bands/artists having recorded there include Adams himself, The Tragically Hip, Billy Joel, Elvis Costello, R.E.M., Slayer and Colin James.\n\n14. Van Halen, Pleasure Dome . . . I‚Äôd describe this, from the Van Hagar-era 1991 For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge album, as progressive hard rock/metal. There‚Äôs no real rythmic hook, just Alex Van Halen‚Äôs incessant drumming and brother Eddie‚Äôs guitar licks but the song itself is the overall hook, careening along in a compelling fashion.\n\n15. The Joe Perry Project, Rockin‚Äô Train . . . Aerosmith was in a chaotic state of drug abuse and other issues when guitarist Perry left during the recording of their 1979 album Night In The Ruts, although he played on six of that album‚Äôs nine tracks. I love that raunchy, rocking album, actually; it‚Äôs arguably the last featuring the original Aerosmith sound before they cleaned up and ascended massive commercial heights from the late 1980s onward but maybe lost some of their soul what with bringing in outside songwriters and getting into the power ballad hit-making business. I like the later stuff, too, the band still rocks for the most part outside the power ballads, but given a choice I‚Äôd take the earlier material.\n\nAnyway, back then Perry formed his own band with a gent named Ralph Morman, who had been in an early 1980s version of Savoy Brown, on lead vocals. At least, he sang on the first of three albums done with various vocalists by Perry‚Äôs Project, the 1980 release Let The Music Do The Talking from where I pulled this funky, R & B type rocker. The title track for the Perry Project album was later re-recorded by Aerosmith and released on their 1985 reunion album Done With Mirrors, which to me and many fans comes closest to early Aerosmith as it‚Äôs the last of their albums where every song is fully group-penned. Yet, most of the band is on record as being dissatisfied with it. Perry did two more Project albums, 1981‚Äôs I‚Äôve Got The Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Rolls Again and 1983‚Äôs Once A Rocker, Always A Rocker, before returning to the mother ship for Done With Mirrors.\n\n16. MC5, Sister Anne . . . Pulsating proto-punk garage rock from the influential Michigan mavens‚Äô 1971 album High Time.\n\n17. Pantera, Cemetery Gates . . . A power ballad with, hey, it‚Äôs Pantera, some powerfully heavy passages to it, from the thrash/groove metal band‚Äôs breakthrough 1990 album Cowboys From Hell. The album marked the completion of Pantera‚Äôs transition from their gla/hair metal beginnings in the 1980s, spandex and all, to what they became. But, while the band has for the most part disowned its earlier material and its then-look, it was pretty heavy, too, albeit probably too derivative of, say, Judas Priest or Kiss to be successful in its own right.\n\n18. Brian May, Resurrection . . . A space rock ethereal intro into some heavy riffing from the Queen guitarist‚Äôs first solo album, 1992‚Äôs Back To The Light. The late Cozy Powell, whose extensive credits included stints with Jeff Beck, Rainbow, Whitesnake and Black Sabbath, on drums. Powell died in a car crash at age 50 in 1998.\n\n19. Iron Butterfly, Termination . . . As we terminate the show with some hard rocking psychedelia from 1968‚Äôs In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album. This is a good tune, but like every other song on that album was overshadowed by the 17-minute title cut that was edited down to 2:52 for single release.\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-19-24-So-Old-Its-New-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-19-24-So-Old-Its-New-hour-2.mp3\n\nA set comprised of mostly early rock and roll, done by the original artists and/or those who were inspired by them, before veering off into other musical territory near the end of the 24-piece program. My track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1. Johnny and Edgar Winter, Rock & Roll Medley (live: Slippin‚Äô And Slidin‚Äô, Jailhouse Rock, Tutti-Frutti, Sick And Tired, I‚Äôm Ready, Reelin‚Äô And Rockin‚Äô, Blue Suede Shoes, Jenny Take A Ride, Good Golly Miss Molly)\n\n2. The Rolling Stones, Mona (I Need You Baby)\n\n3. Bo Diddley, She‚Äôs Fine, She‚Äôs Mine\n\n4. Ronnie Wood & Bo Diddley, Crackin‚Äô Up (from Live At The Ritz)\n\n5. The Plastic Ono Band, Money (from Live Peace In Toronto 1969)\n\n6. Paul McCartney, Hi-Heel Sneakers (from Unplugged ‚Äì The Official Bootleg)\n\n7. The Beatles, A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues (from Live At The BBC)\n\n8. Jerry Lee Lewis, Crazy Arms\n\n9. The Ventures, Walk ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Run\n\n10. Chuck Berry, Guitar Boogie\n\n11. The Champs, Tequila\n\n12. Buddy Holly/The Crickets, Fool‚Äôs Paradise\n\n13. Roy Orbison, Go Go Go (Down The Line)\n\n14. Charlie Rich, Lonely Weekends\n\n15. Eddie Cochran, Nervous Breakdown\n\n16. Carl Perkins, (The Right String, Baby, But The) Wrong Yo-Yo\n\n17. Rufus Thomas, Bear Cat\n\n18. Danny & The Juniors, Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay\n\n19. Django Reinhardt, Djangology\n\n20. Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live, Scatterbrain\n\n21. Peter Green, White Sky (Love That Evil Woman)\n\n22. Van Morrison, Listen To The Lion\n\n23. Steve Winwood, Night Train\n\n24. Tony Banks, Siren\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. Johnny Winter and Edgar Winter, Rock & Roll Medley (live: Slippin‚Äô And Slidin‚Äô, Jailhouse Rock, Tutti-Frutti, Sick And Tired, I‚Äôm Ready, Reelin‚Äô And Rockin‚Äô, Blue Suede Shoes, Jenny Take A Ride, Good Golly Miss Molly) . . . Nine rock ‚Äòn roll classics, or at least snippets of them, some longer than others but it works, whipped up in a torrid six minute package. From the Winter brothers‚Äô 1976 live album Together.\n\n2. The Rolling Stones, Mona (I Need You Baby) . . . From their early days, the Stones doing the Bo Diddley beat. The song was first released on the band‚Äôs UK debut album, simply titled The Rolling Stones but, with a different track listing that didn‚Äôt include Mona, subtitled England‚Äôs Newest Hitmakers in North America. The colonies had to wait for 1965‚Äôs The Rolling Stones, Now! album to get Mona on an LP, back in the days when British bands like the Stones, Beatles and others, thanks in part to the practice of singles in the UK not usually also being released on albums outside of compilations, often saw their records repackaged and/or bastardized, depending how one looks at it.\n\nFor instance: The cover art for the Stones‚Äô 1965 US release December‚Äôs Children (And Everybody‚Äôs), a photo of the band, was the same photo used for the UK album Out Of Our Heads while the US Out Of Our Heads cover used a different photo (and track listing) of the group. The Beatles, for one, hated the practice and what Capitol Records in the US did to their albums, understandable in terms of artistic integrity, album titles (Beatles ‚Äô65, Beatles VI etc. which didn‚Äôt exist in the UK) song sequencing, sound mixes and such. But on the flip side, those were the records many North American fans grew up with and were accustomed to, hence things like the 2014 box set CD release The U.S. Albums and, previous to that, the respective 2004 and 2006 boxes The Capitol Albums Volume 1 and 2. As a Stones and Beatles completist, I have all of it and while I grew up in Canada and first heard and had the North American ones, I do prefer the UK versions of the early albums, in at least some measure as a way of honoring the artists‚Äô intentions.\n\n3. Bo Diddley, She‚Äôs Fine, She‚Äôs Mine . . . And here‚Äôs Bo himself, from 1955 with the B-side to Diddley Daddy, the A-side hitting No. 11 on the R & B charts. Diddley‚Äôs She‚Äôs Fine, She‚Äôs Mine was in 1960 adapted by American blues singer/songwriter/harmonica player Willie Cobbs and became his You Don‚Äôt Love Me, later to be given an epic 19-minute treatment on The Allman Brothers Band‚Äôs classic 1971 live album At Fillmore East.\n\n4. Ronnie Wood & Bo Diddley, Crackin‚Äô Up (from Live At The Ritz) . . . And Bo again, this time with Stones‚Äô guitarist Wood on a rollicking live album recorded in New York City in 1987 and released in 1988. A 10-song trip through mostly Bo‚Äôs catalog including Crackin‚Äô Up but also showcasing Plynth (Water Down the Drain) from the Jeff Beck Group‚Äôs Beck-Ola album, Ooh La La by another of Wood‚Äôs former groups, Faces, and the Stones‚Äô Honky Tonk Women, the album hit No. 40 on the Japanese charts.\n\n5. The Plastic Ono Band, Money (from Live Peace In Toronto 1969) . . . Heavy, gritty version of the rock and roll standard, as performed by the hastily put together band of John Lennon (vocals, guitar), Eric Clapton (guitar), longtime Beatles‚Äô associate Klaus Voorman on bass and future Yes drummer Alan White ‚Ä¶ and Yoko Ono, literally in the bag for at least part of the performance at the Toronto Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Revival festival at Varsity Stadium. The festival featured, among others, rock and roll pioneers Bo Diddley (him yet again, not obsessed with him he just keeps popping up; it‚Äôs that type of interconnected song set), Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Little Richard along with Chicago, The Doors and Alice Cooper, whose band also served as the backing group for Gene Vincent of Be-Bop-a-Lula fame.\n\n6. Paul McCartney, Hi-Heel Sneakers (from Unplugged -The Official Bootleg) . . . From McCartney‚Äôs terrific 1991 release, part of the then-popular MTV Unplugged series that eventually became too much of a good thing. The album, which includes Gene Vincent‚Äôs Be-Bop-a-Lula but I decided to play Hi-Heel Sneakers instead, is a nice combination of early rock and roll standards and some Beatles‚Äô material like I‚Äôve Just Seen A Face, Here, There and Everywhere, We Can Work It Out plus McCartney solo stuff like Junk and That Would Be Something. It also includes a great version of Bill Withers‚Äô Ain‚Äôt No Sunshine, sung by one of McCartney‚Äôs guitarists at the time, Hamish Stuart. Stuart, an original member of the Average White Band, is currently in Ringo Starr‚Äôs All-Starr Band.\n\n7. The Beatles, A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues (from Live At The BBC) . . . The many connections within the set continue with the Fab Four‚Äôs cover of Alabama songwriter/guitarist Terry Thompson‚Äôs tune, which was the B-side to American soul singer Arthur Alexander‚Äôs hit single You Better Move on, which in 1964 was covered by The Rolling Stones. The Beatles either recorded or performed live on the BBC countless times between 1962 and 1965, many of the results of which appeared on Live At The BBC, a 2-disc set first released in 1994 and then re-released in expanded form along with On Air ‚Äì Live At The BBC Volume 2 in 2013. A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues, sung by John Lennon, was recorded in early August, 1963 and aired on the BBC later that month.\n\n8. Jerry Lee Lewis, Crazy Arms . . . A No. 1 country hit and top 30 overall chart placing for Ray Price in 1956, it was the first single recorded by Lewis, also in 1956 although it didn‚Äôt chart. The song was later released on Lewis‚Äôs self-titled debut album in 1958. That record is sometimes referred to as High School Confidential due to that single‚Äôs presence on the record, by which time The Killer was a star via hits like Whole Lot of Shakin‚Äô Goin‚Äô On, Great Balls Of Fire and Breathless.\n\n9. The Ventures, Walk ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Run . . . The first of three consecutive instrumentals. Written by American jazz guitarist Johnny Smith, The Ventures took it to the top of the charts in 1960 and yes, this is a deep cuts show but as I often mention, I do play the occasional singles that either didn‚Äôt chart, ones by relatively obscure artists or songs that may not have been heard, at least by me, in ages. I pulled this one, along with some others in the set, from my trusty 3-CD Totally Essential Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll collection. Not sure how to describe it in words but it‚Äôs one of those tunes that one recognizes immediately upon it starting to play.\n\n10. Chuck Berry, Guitar Boogie . . . Perfectly descriptive title for this instrumental from Berry‚Äôs 1958 album One Dozen Berrys. It‚Äôs got Berry‚Äôs signature intro to the point one almost expects him to start singing Johnny B. Goode or something but it works perfectly well without vocals. There‚Äôs way more than a dozen strawberries on the cool cover, but the album is called One Dozen Berrys due to its 12 tracks including the hits Sweet Little Sixteen and its B-side Reelin‚Äô and Rockin‚Äô (later an A-side hit) and Rock and Roll Music.\n\n11. The Champs, Tequila . . . Last one in the mini-instrumental set although I suppose it‚Äôs technically a semi-instrumental with this one because the word ‚Äòtequila‚Äô is spoken, in a fun and effective way, three times during the two minute, 13-second track. A No. 1 hit in 1958, it‚Äôs one of those cool cases where an A-side, in this case Train To Nowhere, a fine song in its own right but unsuccessful, was flipped over by a DJ who played the B-side Tequila at a Cleveland radio station, and the rest is history. The song has been covered countless times by artists from every genre of music one could name and has a big popular culture presence. It‚Äôs appeared in movies like Breakfast At Tiffany‚Äôs, Pee-wee‚Äôs Big Adventure, Cheech and Chong‚Äôs Next Movie and the TV series Happy Days.\n\n12. Buddy Holly/The Crickets, Fool‚Äôs Paradise . . . It sounds instantly familiar which I suppose most if not all Holly tunes do, similar to, say, Chuck Berry, which some might consider repeating themselves but I find a testament to the effective hooks and melodies inherent in their work. This was the B-side to the top-30 charting A-side Think It Over which also made No. 9 on the R & B list. Fool‚Äôs Paradise made No. 58 on the main charts.\n\n13. Roy Orbison, Go Go Go (Down The Line) . . . B-side to the 1956 single Ooby Dooby and the first song written by Orbison although, according to Wikipedia, Sun Records owner and founder Sam Phillips later bought out out Orbison‚Äôs songs and put his own name on the credits. It was later covered and released as Down The Line by both Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson, among others including Orbison himself, who reworked it for his 1970 album The Big O.\n\n14. Charlie Rich, Lonely Weekends . . . Does the great country singer ever sound like Elvis Presley on this 1960 rockabilly release, but I suppose lots of these types of songs sound like Elvis, or vice-versa. In any event, it‚Äôs all such quality, infectious stuff ‚Äì short, sweet, effective.\n\n15. Eddie Cochran, Nervous Breakdown . . . As I was saying, about the Charlie Rich tune ‚Äì short, sweet, infectious, effective. Best known for hit singles like Summertime Blues, Twenty Flight Rock, C‚Äômon Everybody, Somethin‚Äô Else and Cut Across Shorty, Cochran ‚Äì like his friends Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens ‚Äì died young in an accident. In Cochran‚Äôs case it was in a car crash in 1960 at age 21, just over a year after Holly, 22 and Valens, 17, along with The Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson), 28, perished along with pilot Roger Peterson in the February, 1959 plane crash immortalized as The Day The Music Died in Don MacLean‚Äôs 1971 hit American Pie. Chillingly, apparently Cochran was spooked by the death of his friends and developed a premonition that he, too, would die young and wanted to cut down on touring to reduce chances of an accident. The single car crash came while he was riding in a taxi on tour in England.\n\n16. Carl Perkins, (The Right String, Baby, But The) Wrong Yo-Yo . . . Terrific toe-tapper by the man likely best known for Blue Suede Shoes, famously covered by Elvis Presley among countless renditions by various artists. Perkins also is responsible for Honey Don‚Äôt, Matchbox and Everybody‚Äôs Trying To Be My Baby, all covered by The Beatles to the point Paul McCartney was once quoted as saying ‚Äúif there were no Carl Perkins, there would be no Beatles.‚Äù I think there would have been, talent of that level tends to emerge regardless but no doubt Perkins was influential and provided at least some degree of push towards prominence.\n\n17. Rufus Thomas, Bear Cat . . . A fun response to the song Hound Dog, by the man who gave the rock and roll world the 1963 hit single Walking The Dog which has been covered by artists like The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Roger Daltrey, Johnny Rivers, Mitch Ryder, Jason & The Scorchers, Green Day and many others.\n\n18. Danny & The Juniors, Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay . . . Best known for their 1957 chart-topping At The Hop, this similar-sounding (especially the intro with the doo-wop vocal harmonies) 1958 followup made No. 19 on the hit parade.\n\n19. Django Reinhardt, Djangology . . . Genre change as we bridge into some more modern, longer material via this 1935 recording by the renowned and influential Belgian jazz/gypsy jazz guitarist.\n\n20. Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live, Scatterbrain . . . Beck, hardly a slouch himself, once described Django Reinhardt, in an interview with Guitar World Legends magazine, as ‚Äúby far the most astonishing guitar player ever‚Äù so I figured let‚Äôs see what Beck himself has to play in the jazz fusion idiom as on this collaboration with the Czech-born composer/musician/producer Hammer, released on their 1977 album. Hammer, who was in the original lineup of John McLaughlin‚Äôs Mahavishnu Orchestra starting in 1971, also played on Beck‚Äôs studio albums Wired (1976), There & Back (1980) and Flash (1985). Hammer is well known for various movie and TV scores including the Miami Vice Theme which was a top 20 worldwide hit, including No. 1 on some lists, in 1985.\n\n21. Peter Green, White Sky (Love That Evil Woman) . . . Propulsive near-nine minute title track to the Fleetwood Mac founder member‚Äôs 1982 album. Among the personnel on the album was drummer Reg Isidore, best known for his work in Robin Trower‚Äôs band on albums between 1973 and 1981 including Trower‚Äôs first two solo releases after leaving Procol Harum, the excellent Twice Removed From Yesterday and its followup a year later, the 1974 classic Bridge Of Sighs. Isidore died of a heart attack in 2009 at age 59.\n\n22. Van Morrison, Listen To The Lion . . . An 11-minute voyage into Van The Man‚Äôs vocal style from his 1972 album Saint Dominic‚Äôs Preview. His voice as I often suggest and marvel at is an instrument in itself. Of course that is true of all singers, and it‚Äôs obviously subjective but Morrison‚Äôs voice in this regard is exceptional, as demonstrated on this epic as he sings, chants, moans . . . in short, vocalizes. In the words of noted music journalist/critic Robert Christgau in his review of the album and this song, vocals are sometimes more important than words. Also of note on the song is Ronnie Montrose, best known for hard rocking guitar in his band Montrose (from whence singer Sammy Hagar emerged), showing his versatility with some beautiful acoustic playing in tandem with Morrison.\n\n23. Steve Winwood, Night Train . . . Funky, extended closing cut on Winwood‚Äôs hit album (No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the US) Arc of a Diver, released on the third-last day of 1980. While You See A Chance was the big hit, the title track also made the charts from a true solo album as Winwood sang and played every instrument ‚Äì guitar, bass, various keyboards and synthesizers, and drums.\n\n24. Tony Banks, Siren . . . And why not a little classical music from the Genesis keyboardist to conclude a set that went down some avenues that ‚Äì after I intentionally started with lots of early rock and roll ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt expect or necessarily intend. But in the end that‚Äôs a lot of the fun of it for me and the results come from having assembled the song list over a period of a few days, meaning I put things down, so to speak, then picked them up the next day and the day after that, in different musical moods each time. Composed by Banks and performed by the City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, this piece is from Banks‚Äô second of now three classical albums, the 2012 release Six Pieces For Orchestra. The others are Seven: A Suite For Orchestra (2004) and Five, depicted as ‚Äò5‚Äô on the album cover, released in 2018. I don‚Äôt own any of them but I clued in to Sirens via the 3-CD Genesis compilation R-Kive, a 2014 set that features Genesis band material from all periods of the group plus solo work by Banks, Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett.\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-17-2024-so-old-its-new-Hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-17-2024-so-old-its-new-Hour-2.mp3\n\nAn album replay show featuring releases, in descending order, from 1974, 1973 and 1972: Stormbringer by Deep Purple, Goats Head Soup from The Rolling Stones and Lou Reed‚Äôs Transformer. Track listing after my long preamble.\n\nI‚Äôve been revisiting full albums from my formative musical years of late so I expect I‚Äôll be doing album replays for a few weeks at least, on Saturdays. Such an approach works well for my Saturday show because, unlike Mondays when I‚Äôm actually live in studio, the Saturday morning set, which I volunteered long ago to do to help the station fill an empty time slot, is one I program via the station computer system. So the songs/albums play straight through, no DJ talk to interrupt anyone should they be recording the record off the radio, and yes I‚Äôm dating myself üôÇ from the days we did those sorts of things when a new album was released and an FM station would play the whole thing and you got your blank cassettte tapes ready. And then, me at least, if I liked the album wound up buying it, anyway. Not that such is necessary these days given streaming and such but that‚Äôs, for instance, how I got into Joe Jackson, via a Toronto station playing his first album, Look Sharp! in its entirety.\n\nI always remember such a taping circumstance with AC/DC‚Äôs Back In Black album where, at the time, shortly after college, I had moved to northern Alberta to start my journalism career and the house I was sharing with a bunch of people was beside a construction zone so every now and then a dump truck would drive by, cross the railroad tracks and shake the foundations of the building. Yes, a deliberate nod to a later AC/DC song Shake Your Foundations from the Fly On The Wall album. So, my cassette tape of Back In Black, recorded off radio, had a brief ‚Äòrumble‚Äô in it because the tape deck shook. As I recall, it was during Shoot To Thrill, so the truck driver‚Äôs timing (or mine) was off as obviously the rumble should have come during You Shook Me All Night Long but you can‚Äôt have everything. In any event, when I actually bought Back In Black, I kinda missed that dump truck-induced distortion I had grown used to hearing on playback.\n\nBack to Saturday‚Äôs set . . .\n\nStormbringer is from the Mark III version of Deep Purple featuring David Coverdale on lead vocals supported by bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes. The lineup‚Äôs first outing was the critically acclaimed and commercially successful Burn album but by the next record, Stormbringer, Hughes in particular was pushing Purple towards a more funky, soulful sound which ‚Äì while the album was still successful on the charts ‚Äì guitarist Ritchie Blackmore found distasteful, leading to his eventual departure from the band.\n\nAs a forever Purple fan, all personnel versions of the band and they‚Äôre up to Mark IX now, I‚Äôve always found Blackmore‚Äôs stance interesting given that, while Purple always purported to be a democracy, if the band did have a leader it was Blackmore, so if he didn‚Äôt like the direction one wonders why he didn‚Äôt put his foot down. But, the ever-mercurial Blackmore was also at the time looking to explore other hard rock musical avenues and had become enamoured of the band Elf, which supported Purple on tour and was led by singer Ronnie James Dio, with whom Blackmore eventually partnered to form the first (and best, to me) versions of Rainbow. Yet despite his misgivings, Blackmore still contributed his usual excellent guitar playing to the Mark III albums and Stormbringer features some of my favorite Deep Purple songs, any era and personnel configuration. Things like the beautiful Holy Man and Soldier of Fortune, featuring the vocals of Hughes and Coverdale, respectively, plus the opening rocker of a title cut.\n\nThe Stones‚Äô Goats Head Soup received mixed critical reviews at the time of release and was considered as not measuring up to the so-called ‚Äòbig four‚Äô studio albums that preceded it: Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main St. (likely my favorite album by anyone). That four-album run is one of the greatest in rock music history, but to dismiss, or sell short an album like Goats Head Soup that features songs like Angie, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker), Winter, 100 Years Ago and the infamous Star Star (aka Starfucker, the original title, rejected by the record company) is, well, I‚Äôm a big Stones fan so wrong guy to ask I suppose.\n\nAnd in listening to Transformer again for the first time in ages, in preparing the show, wow, what an album, co-produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson. The record of course features Reed‚Äôs most commercially successful song, Walk On The Wild Side, but is full of great stuff like Vicious, Andy‚Äôs Chest, Satellite Of Love, Perfect Day and others.\n\nHere‚Äôs the set list:\n\nDeep Purple ‚Äì Stormbringer\n\n1. Stormbringer\n\n2. Love Don‚Äôt Mean A Thing\n\n3. Holy Man\n\n4. Hold On\n\n5. Lady Double Dealer\n\n6. You Can‚Äôt Do It Right\n\n7. High Ball Shooter\n\n8. The Gypsy\n\n9. Soldier Of Fortune\n\nThe Rolling Stones ‚Äì Goats Head Soup\n\n1. Dancing With Mr. D\n\n2. 100 Years Ago\n\n3. Coming Down Again\n\n4. Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\n\n5. Angie\n\n6. Silver Train\n\n7. Hide Your Love\n\n8. Winter\n\n9. Can You Hear The Music\n\n10. Star Star\n\nLou Reed ‚Äì Transformer\n\n1. Vicious\n\n2. Andy‚Äôs Chest\n\n3. Perfect Day\n\n4. Hangin‚Äô Round\n\n5. Walk On The Wild Side\n\n6. Make Up\n\n7. Satellite Of Love\n\n8. Wagon Wheel\n\n9. New York Telephone Conversation\n\n10. I‚Äôm So Free\n\n11. Goodnight Ladies\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-12-24-so-old-its-new-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-12-24-so-old-its-new-hour-2.mp3\n\nMy track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1. Meat Loaf, Everything Louder Than Everything Else\n\n2. Bruce Springsteen, Jungleland\n\n3. Argent, Thunder And Lightning\n\n4. Rod Stewart, The Balltrap\n\n5. Long John Baldry, Intro: Conditional Discharge/Don‚Äôt Try To Lay No Boogie Woogie On The King Of Rock & Roll\n\n6. Stephen Stills/Manassas, Johnny‚Äôs Garden\n\n7. Steve Miller Band, Space Cowboy\n\n8. ZZ Top, Groovy Little Hippie Pad\n\n9. Elvis Presley, The Girl Next Door Went A ‚ÄòWalking\n\n10. Blackfoot, Highway Song\n\n11. The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, The Faith Healer\n\n12. Beck Bogert Appice, Lady\n\n13. Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Woncha Take Me For A While\n\n14. The Rolling Stones, I Just Want To See His Face\n\n15. Groundhogs, Thank Christ For The Bomb\n\n16. Howlin‚Äô Wolf, Poor Boy (from The London Howlin‚Äô Wolf Sessions)\n\n17. David Bowie, Stay\n\n18. Little Feat, Dixie Chicken (live, from Waiting For Columbus)\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. Meat Loaf, Everything Louder Than Everything Else . . . Typically bombastic Meat Loaf, but that‚Äôs the point with him. It‚Äôs from Bat Out Hell II: Back Into Hell, released in 1993. It‚Äôs unclear whether they were inspired by the Meat Loaf song title but Motorhead released a live album in 1999 called Everything Louder Than Everyone Else.\n\n2. Bruce Springsteen, Jungleland . . . Epic track from the Born To Run album, 1975. Violin intro by Suki Lahav, who worked with Springsteen on Born To Run and the preceding album The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle before returning to Israel where she continued her varied career as an actress, lyricist, singer, screenwriter and novelist. And, of course, Jungleland features the memorable saxophone solo by The Big Man, longtime E Street Band member Clarence Clemons until his death at age 69 in 2011, to be replaced by his nephew Jake Clemons.\n\n3. Argent, Thunder And Lightning . . . Propulsive rocker, released in 1974, from the band best known for the hit single Hold Your Head Up. Argent leader Rod Argent was also a founding member of The Zombies and co-wrote such Zombies‚Äô hits as She‚Äôs Not There and Time Of The Season.\n\n4. Rod Stewart, The Balltrap . . . Chugging rocker that opened the ‚ÄòFast Side‚Äù, side two (side one of course being the ‚ÄòSlow Side‚Äô) of the original vinyl release of Stewart‚Äôs chart-topping 1976 album A Night On The Town.\n\n5. Long John Baldry, Intro: Conditional Discharge/Don‚Äôt Try To Lay No Boogie Woogie On The King Of Rock & Roll . . . Speaking of Rod Stewart, he produced six songs on one of his heroes‚Äô albums, Baldry‚Äôs 1971 release It Ain‚Äôt Easy. Among the other ‚Äòname‚Äô helpers on the record: Elton John (who produced four songs), Ron Wood and Caleb Quaye, Quaye at various times during the 1970s in and out of Elton John‚Äôs band.\n\n6. Stephen Stills/Manassas, Johnny‚Äôs Garden . . . I got to discussing how great Stephen Still is, with a buddy of mine this past week. So, here he is, a relatively well-known song, from the Manassas album (also the name of the band) although it perhaps surprisingly wasn‚Äôt one of the singles released from that renowned 1972 record.\n\n7. Steve Miller Band, Space Cowboy . . . That‚Äôs what he truly was early in his career, Miller starting his career as a psychedelic blues rocker. Space Cowboy, from 1969‚Äôs Brave New World album, references two Miller tunes ‚Äì Living In The U.S.A. and Gangster Of Love ‚Äì from his 1968 album Sailor and Space Cowboy and Gangster Of Love are referenced in the opening lines ‚Äì ‚Äòsome people call me the space cowboy, yeah, some call me the gangster of love‚Äô ‚Äì of Miller‚Äôs breakthrough hit The Joker. That was the title cut from the 1973 album that presaged the hit singles machine period of Miller‚Äôs career that included tracks like Fly Like An Eagle, Take The Money And Run and many others.\n\n8. ZZ Top, Heaven, Groovy Little Hippie Pad . . . At the time, a sign of things to come for ZZ Top, the use of synthesizer played by an uncredited Linden Hudson, a longtime friend and confidant of the band members and one of the group‚Äôs sound engineers, on this infectious little ditty from the 1981 album El Loco. ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons was apparently inspired to go in the synthesizer direction in part by witnessing a Devo soundcheck. The ZZ Top book Sharp-Dressed Men, by former band crew member David Blayney, includes a section detailing Hudson‚Äôs extensive contributions to the shift in sound that reached full-blown status on the next album after El Loco, 1983‚Äôs Eliminator which featured such hits as Legs, Sharp Dressed Man and Gimme All Your Lovin‚Äô. Hudson, according to the book, later sued over credits that were denied him and the case was reportedly settled out of court for $600,000. Aside from the legal machinations, what‚Äôs fascinating, as related in the book, is how Hudson studied song tempos and beats per minute in hit songs, something ZZ Top, and Gibbons in particular, then used to help write songs whose beats and hooks would prove irresistible to listeners. Calculated, yes. Successful, yes.\n\n9. Elvis Presley, The Girl Next Door Went A ‚ÄòWalking . . . Rockabilly type tune from Elvis‚Äôs 1960 album Elvis Is Back! The album was his first stereo album and first one of fresh material, outside of compilations, issued after his 1958-60 stint in the U.S. Army. Elvis served in West Germany as a regular soldier despite offers to enlist in Special Services, the entertainment branch of the U.S. military where he, like many who did serve in that branch, would have entertained the troops and lived in priority housing. There‚Äôs lots of interesting reading about Presley‚Äôs military stint available including how Presley‚Äôs manager Colonel Tom Parker kept the machine going, so to speak, in terms of releasing music while Elvis was overseas.\n\nAs for the Elvis Is Back! album, as I was telling a friend the other day, while I‚Äôm a big fan, I suppose not big enough of one because, like perhaps many people, I‚Äôve always owned various Elvis hits compilations but never any of his actual studio records which of course go deeper. That is, until last week when I was in my neighborhood independent music shop and for $15 there sat a used, great condition, 4-CD, 8-individual albums remastered with a plethora of bonus track singles box set of Elvis‚Äôs early stuff. It runs from his 1956 debut ‚ÄúElvis Presley‚Äù (the one with ‚ÄòElvis‚Äô printed vertically down the left hand side with ‚ÄòPresley‚Äô horizontally on the bottom and the man himself pictured playing his guitar, a cover later copied by The Clash on their London Calling album) through to the 1960 gospel album His Hand In Mine. So I quickly checked the web, confirmed this was a legit release, saw that the same set was available online for a minimum of $50 and a maximum of the sky‚Äôs the limit, and now it‚Äôs mine. Sounds great, is great, it‚Äôs Elvis, what more can one want? Especially for $15, plus tax, $18.07 total. I am pleased.\n\n10. Blackfoot, Highway Song . . . I say this every time I play one of them, which I have, so at risk of and in fact repeating myself I‚Äôll say it again: Every so-called southern rock band seems to have a lengthy, signature tune. Think Lynyrd Skynyrd with Freebird, the Outlaws with Green Grass and High Tides and Molly Hatchet with Fall Of The Peacemakers, all amazing tunes. This is Blackfoot‚Äôs such song, from the band‚Äôs 1979 album Strikes with a cool cover of a cobra about to, er, strike. There are so many connections between the various successful southern rock bands. Blackfoot leader, guitarist, singer and frontman Rickey Medlocke was in early versions of Lynyrd Skynyrd, as a drummer and sometime singer before that band released an official album although his work is all over the 1978 original band post-plane crash compilation of early material called Skynyrd‚Äôs First . . . And Last which was later expanded and re-released in 1998 as Skynyrd‚Äôs First: The Complete Muscle Shoals Album. By then, Medlocke had become a permanent member of the reconstituted Skynyrd, in which he remains to this day. And the late Hughie Thomasson, a founding member of the Outlaws, was Medlocke‚Äôs guitar sparring partner with Skynyrd from 1996 to 2005 before he left to reform the Outlaws, dying of a heart attack at age 55 in 2007.\n\n11. The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, The Faith Healer . . . A relentless groove to this one from the Scottish band‚Äôs second studio album, the 1973 release Next.\n\n12. Beck Bogert Appice, Lady . . . I‚Äôll just repeat what I said/wrote about the previous track by The Sensational Alex Harvey Band. Different song of course, but same effect. From the lone studio album, the self-titled 1973 record, issued by the supergroup of guitarist Jeff Beck, bass player Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice, the latter two having previously played together in Vanilla Fudge and Cactus. Appice later was a member of Rod Stewart‚Äôs band for the albums Footloose and Fancy Free, Blondes Have More Fun, Foolish Behaviour and Tonight I‚Äôm Yours, issued from 1977 to 1981. Appice‚Äôs drummer brother Vinny is best known for his work in the Ronnie James Dio lead singer version of Black Sabbath as well as Dio the band.\n\n13. Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Woncha Take Me For A While . . . Typically gritty C.F. (Fred) Turner vocal on this part ballad, part rocker, a power ballad in today‚Äôs parlance, from the 1975 album Head On, perhaps best known for the hits Take It Like A Man, Lookin‚Äô Out For #1 and the original packaging where the album cover expanded into a poster featuring head shots of the four band members at the time ‚Äì bass player Turner, guitarist Randy Bachman, drummer Rob Bachman and guitarist Blair Thornton. Little Richard played piano on two songs on the album ‚Äì Take It Like A Man and Stay Alive.\n\n14. The Rolling Stones, I Just Want To See His Face aka Just Wanna See His Face . . . I mentioned gospel music earlier while discussing Elvis‚Äôs 1960 album His Hand In Mine and I also had a discussion about gospel music in general over the weekend with a friend who mentioned an album of gospel tunes he had recently purchased. One doesn‚Äôt have to be religious, or spiritual, to enjoy what is simply a great genre of music. Here‚Äôs the Stones‚Äô successful stab at it, from Exile On Main St.\n\n15. Groundhogs, Thank Christ For The Bomb . . . A multipart piece about war. Initially acoustic with vocals followed by a low-key instrumental passage that develops into a heavy rock coda ending in, of course, explosions. It‚Äôs the title track to the English blues rock band‚Äôs 1970 album.\n\n16. Howlin‚Äô Wolf, Poor Boy (from The London Howlin‚Äô Wolf Sessions) . . . This one came to mind to play thanks to having attended the annual Kitchener Blues Festival over the weekend. One of the artists, the noted Canadian musician and producer Colin Linden, not only played a fine set on Saturday afternoon but, earlier that day, held one of the festival‚Äôs ‚Äòworkshops‚Äô, where artists interact with an interviewer, and the audience, telling tales of their careers. It‚Äôs fascinating stuff, and I got to thinking of The London Howlin‚Äô Wolf Sessions album because Linden mentioned it while relating a story ‚Äì both at the workshop and later at his actual show ‚Äì about how as a youngster his musical life was changed when he discovered the blues great, then later met him when the Wolf, real name Chester Burnett, was playing at a Toronto club. The London Howlin‚Äô Wolf Sessions album was originally released in 1971 and was re-released in an expanded deluxe edition in 2002. Receiving top billing with Wolf on the album cover are Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood and The Rolling Stones‚Äô rhythm section of drummer Charlie Watts and bassist Bill Wyman. Clapton and the two Rolling Stones play on the entire album, Winwood contributes piano or organ to five songs while among others contributing are Beatles‚Äô drummer Ringo Starr, Beatles associate Klaus Voorman on bass and Stones‚Äô pianist Ian Stewart.\n\n17. David Bowie, Stay . . . Great funk/soul rocking number from the 1976 album Station To Station. It was released as a single but didn‚Äôt chart. Golden Years was the big hit from the album.\n\n18. Little Feat, Dixie Chicken (live, from Waiting For Columbus) . . . Little Feat was backed by the Tower Of Power horn section on the shows from which Waiting For Columbus was drawn. This is an extended 9-minute workout of the title track from the band‚Äôs 1973 album.\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-5-2024-so-old-its-new-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-5-2024-so-old-its-new-hour-2.mp3\n\nLots of covers (and radical reinventions in some cases, like Oingo Boingo doing The Kinks and XTC doing Bob Dylan) plus a one-hit wonder segment including In The Year 2525 by Sager and Evans, Venus by Shocking Blue and Mason Williams‚Äô Classical Gas. My track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1. Jeff Healey, Jambalaya (On the Bayou) (Hank Williams cover)\n\n2. Cat Stevens, Indian Ocean\n\n3. Phil Collins, Tomorrow Never Knows (Beatles cover)\n\n4. Love, August\n\n5. Martha and The Muffins, About Insomnia\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Love In Vain (Robert Johnson cover, from semi-acoustic live, part studio album Stripped, studio session with false start including laugh-filled discussion over screwup)\n\n7. Zager and Evans, In The Year 2525\n\n8. Mason Williams, Classical Gas\n\n9. Shocking Blue, Venus\n\n10. 999, Homicide\n\n11. XTC, All Along The Watchtower (Bob Dylan cover)\n\n12. Oingo Boingo, You Really Got Me (Kinks cover)\n\n13. Slash featuring Demi Lovato, Papa Was A Rolling Stone (Temptations cover)\n\n14. The Doors, The Spy\n\n15. Robert Plant, Embrace Another Fall\n\n16. Mudcrutch, Lover Of The Bayou (Byrds cover)\n\n17. Van Morrison, T.B. Sheets\n\n18. Booker T. & The M.G.‚Äôs, Melting Pot\n\n19. Kris Kristofferson, Me and Bobby McGee\n\n20. Robert Palmer, Remember To Remember\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. Jeff Healey, Jambalaya (On the Bayou) (Hank Williams cover) . . . Rocking version of the Hank Williams classic, released on Healey‚Äôs 2008 album Mess Of Blues, a covers album which came out just two weeks after his passing, of cancer, at age 41. Healey had previously released another covers album, Cover To Cover, in 1995.\n\n2. Cat Stevens, Indian Ocean . . . One of my favorite Cat Stevens/Yusuf Islam songs, a touching ‚Äòworld music‚Äô track first released as a digital download to benefit 2004 Asian/Indian Ocean earthquake/tsunami relief efforts. It saw physical release on the 2005 compilation Cat Stevens Gold.\n\n3. Phil Collins, Tomorrow Never Knows (Beatles cover) . . . From his debut solo release, Face Value, issue in 1981 which featured the big hit In The Air Tonight and another top 10 track in Canada and the USA, I Missed Again. I first heard the album, playing over the store‚Äôs sound system, while browsing a record store in the San Francisco Bay Area with one of my younger brothers during some time I spent in California the spring and summer of 1981.\n\n4. Love, August . . . Well, it is August, so I figure I had to get this in before the end of the month. From the fourth Love album, 1969‚Äôs Four Sail, a somewhat harder rocking album, of which this song is an example, than the previous psychedelic fare serve up by Arthur Lee and friends, although any Love is good Love, to me. Great band, never sold all that many records but hugely influential particularly via albums like the seminal 1967 release Forever Changes.\n\n5. Martha and The Muffins, About Insomnia . . . A track, actually a single that didn‚Äôt chart, from 1980‚Äôs Trance and Dance album. It‚Äôs about (not really but it fits) my last couple nights of not getting much sleep, just an hour or two here and there but I‚Äôm in remarkably fine fettle all things considered. Martha and The Muffins is of course best-known for the 1979 hit single Echo Beach although they had other hits, at least in home country Canada, like Paint By Number Heart, Women Around The World At Work, Danseparc (Every Day It‚Äôs Tomorrow) and Black Stations/White Stations (during the 1983-86 period when the band was also known as M + M).\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Love In Vain (Robert Johnson cover, from semi-acoustic live, part studio 1995 album Stripped) . . . From a studio session in Tokyo with false start including brief laugh-filled discussion between Ron Wood and Keith Richards about guitar arpeggios after Wood messes up (sounded fine to me but I don‚Äôt play guitar) and wants to start over. Love In Vain has a long history with the Stones, dating to its first studio release on 1969‚Äôs Let It Bleed album, the 1970 live album Get Yer Ya Ya‚Äôs Out! and many concert renditions since.\n\n7. Zager and Evans, In The Year 2525 . . . First in my one-hit wonder mini-set. I‚Äôve been planning to play this and the several songs that follow, for a few weeks, finally getting to it for tonight‚Äôs show. Not much more to say about these songs except they‚Äôre great and, so what if the artists never approached the same commercial heights, they did what they did and their legacy is assured.\n\n8. Mason Williams, Classical Gas . . . From the 1968 album The Mason Williams Phonograph Record. Williams may have been a one-hit wonder but still with us at age 85 he is/was an accomplished writer and comedian, among other artistic pursuits. Among his comedy writing credits are The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour and Saturday Night Live.\n\n9. Shocking Blue, Venus . . . They were a one-hit wonder (but actually maybe not, more on that in a bit) featuring the striking singer Mariska Veres who sadly died young, of cancer, age 59 in 2006. But in putting together the show I explored the Dutch band‚Äôs ouevre and in addition to their own stuff, like Venus and Send Me A Postcard (with Veres sounding like Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, or vice-versa) they did fine covers of Hank Williams‚Äô Jambalaya, just a terrific up-tempo reinvention of the tune I played earlier in the show as covered by Canadian Jeff Healey, and the classic John D. Loudermilk tune Tobacco Road.\n\n10. 999, Homicide . . . Not sure why but I scared the shit out of a friend years ago and she told me as much the next day, she was listening to the show, when I played this track from the English punk/new wave band. It‚Äôs just a song, as I told her, it‚Äôs arguably aggressive for sure but it‚Äôs not advocating anything the way I read the lyrics and there‚Äôs any number of songs about disturbing subject matter. Like for example Polly, by Nirvana, about the abduction, rape, and torture of a 14-year-old girl returning home from a punk rock concert in Tacoma, Washington in 1987 that I played fairly recently. I like Polly a lot musically but it‚Äôs quite disturbing to the point I‚Äôm often reluctant to play it and almost feel bad for liking it, musically, but, fortunately, the perpetrator was caught and is behind bars, serving two concurrent 75-year terms. In any event, Homicide by 999 is a propulsive track, hit No. 40 on the charts in 1978, my first year of college which coincided with punk/new wave breaking big and contributing to opening my musical horizons.\n\n11. XTC, All Along The Watchtower (Bob Dylan cover) . . . I like lots of XTC, including of course the hit that got me and many people into them, 1979‚Äôs Making Plans For Nigel, but I‚Äôd never heard their cover of the Dylan tune until I went down the YouTube rabbit hole some time back. XTC reinterpreted the Dylan tune, as Jimi Hendrix also of course did, in a different fashion, on the band‚Äôs 1978 debut album White Music.\n\n12. Oingo Boingo, You Really Got Me (Kinks cover) . . . I discovered this major reinterpretation by the California ska/new wave band of The Kinks‚Äô classic while listening to some of the earlier songs in the set, on YouTube, as I prepared tonight‚Äôs show. Playing it reminds me and brings a smile to my face, of my equally music-loving younger brother, into classic rock along with me, Stones, etc. with his ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs happened to you?‚Äô when he at some point saw my late 70s early 80s punk/new wave albums, Haircut One Hundred, Fabulous Poodles and the like. He said something like, what next, Oingo Boingo? Not at the time, although I‚Äôd heard of them and thought the name was cool, but here I go playing them. Cool version, akin to, say, how Devo reinvented the Stones‚Äô Satisfaction.\n\n13. Slash featuring Demi Lovato, Papa Was A Rolling Stone (Temptations cover) . . . From Orgy of the Damned, a covers album by the Guns N‚Äô Roses, Velvet Revolver, Slash‚Äôs Snakepit etc. guitarist, released just a couple months ago, May 2024.\n\n14. The Doors, The Spy . . . Spooky sort of track, musically and lyrically, from 1970‚Äôs Morrison Hotel album.\n\n15. Robert Plant, Embrace Another Fall . . . Intoxicating experimental world beat folk rock from Plant‚Äôs 2014 album Lullaby . . . and the Ceaseless Roar as Plant continues on his late career amazing musical explorations.\n\n16. Mudcrutch, Lover Of The Bayou (The Byrds cover) . . . Tom Petty‚Äôs original, pre-Heartbreakers band which reformed and released two studio albums, in 2008 and 2016 before Petty‚Äôs 2017 passing. Here, from the first Mudcrutch album, the band covers one of my favorite Byrds tunes and of course Petty was hugely influenced musically by The Byrds, to whom he and friends pay great tribute on this track.\n\n17. Van Morrison, T.B. Sheets . . . Near 10-minute piece, his voice as always an instrument in itself, from Van the Man‚Äôs 1967 debut solo album Blowin‚Äô Your Mind after he left Them.\n\n18. Booker T. & The M.G.‚Äôs, Melting Pot . . . Title cut, typical funky R & B fuelled instrumental rock, from the band‚Äôs 1971 album.\n\n19. Kris Kristofferson, Me and Bobby McGee . . . Sometimes a song covered by someone else overshadows the original, which is what Janis Joplin‚Äôs No. 1 cover of the KK tune did. As did, maybe, Roger Miller‚Äôs cover. Or the one by Jerry Lee Lewis. Yet . . . crazy as it maybe sounds, as with Jimi Hendrix‚Äôs reinterpretation of Bob Dylan‚Äôs All Along The Watchtower which even Dylan himself said became ‚Äòa Jimi Hendrix song‚Äô, I still prefer the originals while loving the covers. Honestly. I mean, I absolutely love the Joplin version, particularly the way she sings the ‚Äúwindshield wipers slappin‚Äô ‚Äòtaaaam‚Äù (time)‚Äô but well, Kristofferson if one checks out his stuff Bobby McGee and beyond is/was just an amazing songwriter. And emotive singer. In any case, his song includes one of the best, and perhaps most true or accurate lines ever, depending obviously upon how one looks at life: But I‚Äôd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday. And I don‚Äôt live in the past, but sometimes would be interesting to go back.\n\n20. Robert Palmer, Remember To Remember . . . He topped the charts later on with stuff like Addicted To Love and so on but for me, it‚Äôs the back-to-back albums, Secrets in 1979 and Clues in 1980. Track-for-track excellent, this one from Secrets whose hit was the cover of the Moon Martin-penned Bad Case Of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor).\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/So-Old-Its-New-2024-08-03-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aug-3-24-so-old-its-new-hour-2.mp3\n\nA ‚Äòbrothers‚Äô set airing for a Saturday morning. I was undecided as to what direction to go for Saturday‚Äôs show until something in my brain told me I had not played The Doobie Brothers in a while. So that led to loading a bunch of Doobies songs into the system, which led to loading songs by bands with ‚ÄòBrothers‚Äô in their name, which further led to what I finally settled on, a brother act show featuring bands that include actual brothers and bands which may not be so familial but feature the word ‚ÄòBrothers‚Äô in their name. Must be something to do with the fact I am one of four brothers (and one sister).\n\nSo: We have AC/DC with the Young brothers, Angus and Malcolm, Collective Soul with the Roland brothers Ed and Dean, the Allmans of Duane and Gregg, The Kinks of the forever fractious Ray and Dave Davies, early Dire Straits which featured Mark and David Knopfler for the first few albums, the similarly to The Kinks at odds Everly Brothers Don and Phil, same with the Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, the Wilson brothers and cousin Mike Love in The Beach Boys, the brothers Gibb of the Bee Gees, John and Tom Fogerty of CCR, at various points Randy, Tim and Rob Bachman in Bachman-Turner Overdrive, the Van Halen brothers guitarist Eddie and drummer Alex, and Dean and Robert DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots.\n\nMy track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1. AC/DC, Let There Be Rock\n\n2. Collective Soul, Disciplined Breakdown\n\n3. The Allman Brothers Band, Heart Of Stone\n\n4. The Doobie Brothers, Toulouse Street\n\n5. The Kinks, Living On A Thin Line\n\n6. Dire Straits, In The Gallery\n\n7. The Flying Burrito Brothers, Wild Horses\n\n8. The Everly Brothers, Crying In The Rain\n\n9. The Beach Boys, Sail On Sailor\n\n10. Bee Gees, Lonely Days\n\n11. Creedence Clearwater Revival, Effigy\n\n12. Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Blue Moanin‚Äô\n\n13. Van Halen, Cabo Wabo (Sammy Hagar lead vocals)\n\n14. Van Halen, D.O.A. (David Lee Roth lead vocals)\n\n15. Van Halen, Year To The Day (Gary Cherone lead vocals)\n\n16. Oasis, I Am The Walrus (live)\n\n17. The Chambers Brothers, Time Has Come Today\n\n18. Stone Temple Pilots, All In The Suit That You Wear\n\n19. The Allman Brothers Band, Mountain Jam (live, from Eat A Peach, recorded March 13, 1971 at Fillmore East, New York City)\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. AC/DC, Let There Be Rock . . . Title cut from the band‚Äôs 1977 album, Bon Scott still around and on lead vocals, and it does, er, rock as Bon, lyrically, takes us through the history of rock and roll music, to that point.\n\n2. Collective Soul, Disciplined Breakdown . . . Title cut from the band‚Äôs 1997 release, typically grungy, tuneful guitar work.\n\n3. The Allman Brothers Band, Heart Of Stone . . . No brothers in The Rolling Stones, my favorite band who I always play, but I‚Äôll always figure a way to get them in my sets. üôÇ This is the Allmans‚Äô fine cover of the early Stones‚Äô tune, released on the final Allmans‚Äô studio album, Hittin‚Äô The Note, a terrific statement released in 2003.\n\n4. The Doobie Brothers, Toulouse Street . . . Hauntingly beautiful, somewhat spooky title cut from the band‚Äôs 1972 album.\n\n5. The Kinks, Living On A Thin Line . . . A minor hit, one of my favorite Kinks tracks, written and sung by guitarist Dave Davies, easily one of his best, a passionate vocal performance commentary on England at the time of writing.\n\n‚ÄúAll the stories have been told of kings and days of old but there‚Äôs no England now . . . all the wars that were won and lost somehow don‚Äôt seem to matter so much anymore . . . all the lies we were told . . . I see change but inside we‚Äôre the same as we ever were . . . Now another century nearly gone, what are we gonna leave for the young? . . . ‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs from the 1984 album Word Of Mouth and the song was used later in an episode of The Sopranos but I‚Äôm not much of a TV series buff outside of Star Trek and a few others, so never heard it there. But if the show gave the song deserved exposure, that‚Äôs great. Word Of Mouth was the last in a commercial hot streak, certainly at least in North America, for The Kinks that started with the 1979 album Low Budget and continued through 1981‚Äôs Give The People What They Want and 1983‚Äôs State Of Confusion which featured the hits Come Dancing and Don‚Äôt Forget To Dance.\n\n6. Dire Straits, In The Gallery . . . Yet another fine, bluesy cut from the band‚Äôs self-titled debut album, released in 1978.\n\n7. The Flying Burrito Brothers, Wild Horses . . . A cover of The Rolling Stones‚Äô tune, came out on the Burritos‚Äô second album, Burrito Deluxe, released in 1970, a year before the Stones‚Äô own version appeared on their Sticky Fingers album. By that point, Burritos‚Äô leader Gram Parsons and the Stones‚Äô Keith Richards had become friends and sometime collaborators at least in terms of influencing each other‚Äôs music. A nice version of an amazing song, one I was revisiting the other day via the version on the Stones‚Äô live semi-acoustic 1995 album Stripped, a very worthwhile listen.\n\n8. The Everly Brothers, Crying In The Rain . . . A No. 6 hit in the USA in 1961, not quite as successful elsewhere but relatively well-known.\n\n9. The Beach Boys, Sail On Sailor . . . One of my favorite Beach Boys songs, released in 1973 via the Holland album. Sail On Sailor was a single, pretty well known I would think although it made little dent in the charts, grazing the top 50, or worse, depending on country. It was an interesting period for the band, thought by many to be a spent force distanced from their hugely hit successful surfer music of the 1960s, some conflict within the group as to whether they should progress musically or rely on past hits at least in terms of live performance, yet they came up with an excellent track like this, sung by new guitarist Blondie Chaplin, later a studio session player and touring musician with The Rolling Stones.\n\n10. Bee Gees, Lonely Days . . . The Bee Gees tend to get pigeonholed by some as a disco band given their contributions to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, late 1970s but they were truly an amazing band well before that, as this earlier multi-part track from the 1970 album 2 Years On demonstrates.\n\n11. Creedence Clearwater Revival, Effigy . . . Extended cut from CCR‚Äôs 1969 album Willie and the Poor Boys, remarkably perhaps the prolific band‚Äôs third studio album release that year. Obviously known for their well-known hit singles, CCR was, as demonstrated by songs like this jam, far more.\n\n12. Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Blue Moanin‚Äô . . . A typical BTO chugger, particularly when C.F. (Fred Turner) is singing.\n\n13. Van Halen, Cabo Wabo (Sammy Hagar lead vocals) . . . First of three from the various configurations of Van Halen, this the Van Hagar version, from the OU812 album, the second of four studio records with Hagar on lead vocals.\n\n14. Van Halen, D.O.A. (David Lee Roth lead vocals) . . . One of my favorites from the Roth version of the band, a kick butt tune from VH II.\n\n15. Van Halen, Year To The Day (Gary Cherone lead vocals) . . . From the ill-fated Van Halen 3 version, which is what that lineup‚Äôs lone studio album, released in 1998, was called. It bombed, relatively speaking, although it was a top five charting record, actually but of course many fans would buy it out of brand recongition and curiousity about the new lineup. It took me many listens but I did finally ‚Äòget‚Äô the record although I think it simply wasn‚Äôt to most VH fans‚Äô taste. Many never accepted Cherone, the style of music was different, most of the songs, like this near-nine minute track, were longer, less immediate and with fewer obvious hooks, almost progressive rock in spots, than what the band had produced to that point, although Cabo Wabo from OU812 checks in at seven minutes. Still, aside from two short instrumental interludes, every song on Van Halen 3 was at least 5:30 in length, somewhat atypical for the band. Soon enough, Hagar was back to record some new tracks for a double disc compilation. What then followed was what became an ill-fated reunion tour of the Van Hagar lineup, although I saw the first leg of the trek in Toronto and it was a great show. But a big Van Halen fan friend of mine, who had seen the Toronto concert, also saw a later gig, five months later in Hamilton, Ontario and said it was awful, the conflicts within the band evident on stage and affecting the music, as were Eddie Van Halen‚Äôs struggles with substance abuse.\n\n16. Oasis, I Am The Walrus (live) . . . The Gallagher brothers pay homage to one of their acknowledged influences, The Beatles. The track was recorded at a concert in Glasgow, Scotland in 1994 and first released in an 8-minute version as the B-side to the hit single Cigarettes and Alcohol. I‚Äôm playing the edited 6:25 version that appeared on The Masterplan, a 1998 compilation of B-sides that hadn‚Äôt made it to albums at that point.\n\n17. The Chambers Brothers, Time Has Come Today . . . Yeah, it was a hit, No. 11 in the US, No. 9 in Canada, but it‚Äôs by a band of real brothers and I occasionally play singles one might not have heard in a while, despite mine being for the very most part a deep cuts show. What‚Äôs interesting about Time Has Come Today is the number of versions of it that were done. The original 1966 version, clocking in at 2:37, was rejected by Columbia Records. The band then released the full 11:06 epic version of psychedelic soul as the ostensible title cut of the 1967 album The Time Has Come. Then came two hit single versions, both released in 1968 ‚Äì one a 3:05 edit and the other 4:45. I‚Äôm playing the 4:45 version but all of them are of course excellent.\n\n18. Stone Temple Pilots, All In The Suit That You Wear . . . A to that point unreleased track that came out on the band‚Äôs hits compilation, Thank You, in 2003. I like a lot of STP‚Äôs stuff, saw them as an opening act for The Rolling Stones on the Voodoo Lounge tour stop in Toronto in 1994, one of the more memorable performances I‚Äôve experienced from Stones‚Äô opening acts I‚Äôve witnessed over many shows over the years. Some of them: AC/DC at the 2003 SARS Toronto Rocks show (also have seen AC/DC on their own) and also at SARS, Rush, The Guess Who including Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings at a time before legal issues over naming rights cropped up, The Isley Brothers, The Tea Party, Sass Jordan, Blue Rodeo, The Flaming Lips . . . at other Stones shows: Atlanta Rhythm Section, Big Sugar (have also seen them separately in a small venue, great band but too bloody loud for my ears, frankly; I wore ear plugs but was seriously worried until the ringing stopped three days later), The White Stripes, No Doubt, Beck. That‚Äôs the great thing sometimes, going to concerts by iconic acts like the Stones; the undercard so to speak can be so rewarding which is why I always take in opening acts. Like Pretenders opening for The Who in Toronto in 2006, or Slayer for Judas Priest in 2004, etc.\n\n19. The Allman Brothers Band, Mountain Jam . . . (live, from Eat A Peach, recorded March 13, 1971 at Fillmore East, New York City) . . . 33 minutes the Allmans had the great ability to jam for almost literally hours on end and never be boring. This version was originally split in two on first vinyl pressings of Eat A Peach but has since come out as the one full version on CD reissues of the album and various expanded re-releases of the At Fillmore East album.\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-22-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-22-hour-2.mp3\n\nMusic for a Monday night. My track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1. Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Nut Rocker (live, from Pictures at an Exhibition)\n\n2. Golden Earring, Sleepwalkin‚Äô\n\n3. Deep Purple, A Bit On The Side\n\n4. Jethro Tull, Rock Island\n\n5. David Bowie, Shadow Man\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Laugh I Nearly Died\n\n7. Elvis Costello, Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down\n\n8. The Byrds, You‚Äôre Still On My Mind\n\n9. Warren Zevon, Poisonous Lookalike\n\n10. The Kingsmen, Death Of An Angel\n\n11. Grand Funk Railroad, Creepin‚Äô\n\n12. Manfred Mann‚Äôs Earth Band, Don‚Äôt Kill It Carol\n\n13. Gov‚Äôt Mule, Silent Scream\n\n14. Eric Clapton, Black Summer Rain\n\n15. Rory Gallagher, I‚Äôm Not Awake Yet\n\n16. The Butterfield Blues Band, Just To Be With You\n\n17. Kansas, Throwing Mountains\n\n18. Patti Smith, Birdland\n\n19. George Thorogood & The Destroyers, That‚Äôs It, I Quit\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Nut Rocker (live, from Pictures at an Exhibition) . . . One of ELP‚Äôs several rock interpretations of classical works, this one from the album where the band put its stamp on the piano suite by Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky. Nut Rocker, however, was the last track on the album and lone piece not by Mussorgsky. It was ELP‚Äôs adaptation of a work by another Russian composer, Tchaikovsky‚Äôs The Nutcracker. Nut Rocker was also a hit single in 1962 for American instrumental ensemble B. Bumble and the Stingers, who were famously among the many artists name-checked by the one-hit wonder band Reunion on their 1974 hit Life Is A Rock (But The Radio Rolled Me), which I played a few weeks ago although B. Bumble is referred to as B.B. Bumble in the first verse of the Reunion song.\n\n2. Golden Earring, Sleepwalkin‚Äô . . . Funky boogie boppin‚Äô single, didn‚Äôt chart, from the 1976 album To The Hilt. Much more to the Dutch band than just the songs Radar Love and Twilight Zone.\n\n3. Deep Purple, A Bit On The Side . . . Chugging, driving rocker from the new Deep Purple album, = 1, released this past Friday, July 19, to celebrate my birthday. üôÇ Officially a senior now, at 65. Just coincidence, of course, but a nice birthday present to myself. It‚Äôs the first studio album to feature Purple‚Äôs new guitarist, Northern Irish player Simon McBride. McBride replaces Steve Morse, who McBride filled in for on tour a couple years ago when Morse took a break from the band to care for his ailing wife who has, alas, since died. Morse eventually left the group and McBride was made a fulltime member. I liked the Morse period, which covered eight studio albums from 1996 to 2021, but McBride has fit right in and the album, rightly, is getting good reviews but I‚Äôm probably the wrong person to ask, being a huge Deep Purple fan. As for the album‚Äôs title, according to Wikipedia ‚Äúthe album has been described as having a loose concept around the idea that in a world growing ever more complex, everything eventually simplifies down to a single, unified essence. Everything equals one.‚Äù There‚Äôs a mathematical equation on the inside sleeve of the album cover, which gives me nightmares about high school algebra, but the cover is cool: a simple = 1 and ‚ÄúDeep Purple‚Äù on an otherwise entirely white background, somewhat akin to The Beatles‚Äô White Album.\n\n4. Jethro Tull, Rock Island . . . I‚Äôve been going through some of Tull‚Äôs more recent albums of late, and played Occasional Demons from 1993‚Äôs Catfish Rising a couple weeks ago. This is the title cut from the album preceding that one, released in 1989. Typical Tull, part ballad, some riff rocking, nice.\n\n5. David Bowie, Shadow Man . . . Haunting, spooky track featuring a stirring vocal performance by Bowie. It was originally recorded in 1971, but left unfinished, during the sessions for the classic 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars. Bowie reworked it in 2000 for the Toy album project, which wasn‚Äôt released on its own until 2021 although Shadow Man was included on the 3-CD deluxe edition of the compilation Nothing Has Changed, released in 2014.\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Laugh I Nearly Died . . . Slow burning bluesy funk track, if that makes sense but I think you can marry myriad genres, a mashup of sorts. Apparently used in the TV series Supernatural, which I‚Äôve never seen but aside from sports, history documentaries and Star Trek I‚Äôm not a big TV watcher although all of that consumes enough time. Probably a good thing I‚Äôve not seen Supernatural, although now I‚Äôm tempted, because then I‚Äôd think of scenes from the show instead of enjoying the song. It‚Äôs like when a novel becomes a movie and the paperback is re-released with a character or two, as portrayed by actors, on the cover. Just not my cup of tea ‚Äì I prefer to imagine what characters look like or interpret the song for myself, but I ‚Äòget‚Äô the tie-ins.\n\n7. Elvis Costello, Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down . . . Just randomly picked Almost Blue, Costello‚Äôs 1981 country and western covers album, off the shelf and played it driving back and forth to the gym this past week. A Merle Haggard tune, nicely done, on a solid album. The older I get, the more I seem to enjoy country music. Interesting.\n\n8. The Byrds, You‚Äôre Still On My Mind . . . Still in the country groove, here‚Äôs another hurtin‚Äô tune, from the Sweetheart Of The Rodeo album, the one record Gram Parsons, who sings the tune, did with the Byrds before leaving to form The Flying Burrito Brothers.\n\n9. Warren Zevon, Poisonous Lookalike . . . About a relationship gone bad, from Zevon‚Äôs 1995 album Mutineer. David Lindley helps out on fiddle and cittern, a guitar-like stringed instrument, similar to a lute, dating to the Renaissance. Lindley, who had an extensive session playing history with many artists including Zevon, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt, is perhaps best known on his own for his 1981 debut solo album El Rayo-X. That record featured the hit single Mercury Blues (also done by Steve Miller on the Fly Like An Eagle album), written by blues musicians K. C. Douglas and Robert Geddins and first recorded by Douglas in 1948.\n\n10. The Kingsmen, Death Of An Angel . . . Slightly speeded up version of a spooky sort of song originally done in 1955 by the Los Angeles-based doo-wop vocal group Donald Woods and The Vel-Aires. It was released on the 1964 album The Kingsmen Volume II, subtitled ‚ÄúMore Great Songs From The Group That Gave You ‚ÄòLouie, Louie‚Äô ‚Äú.\n\n11. Grand Funk Railroad, Creepin‚Äô . . . Inspired to play it by a friend mentioning it, an appropriately-titled track from 1973‚Äôs We‚Äôre An American Band album, it was the B-side to the title cut No. 1 single.\n\n12. Manfred Mann‚Äôs Earth Band, Don‚Äôt Kill It Carol . . . Two different English bands with one leader. There‚Äôs the 1960s Manfred Mann of hits like Do Wah Diddy Diddy, Pretty Flamingo and their cover of Bob Dylan‚Äôs Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn), released as Mighty Quinn by Manfred Mann. Then there‚Äôs the 1970s progressive/jazz rock Manfred Mann‚Äôs Earth Band, best known for their 1976 hit single cover of Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs Blinded By The Light. The trippy, psychedelic Don‚Äôt Kill It Carol, from 1979‚Äôs Angel Station album, made it just inside the top 50 in the UK.\n\n13. Gov‚Äôt Mule, Silent Scream . . . Bluesy, dark, near 11-minute epic from the Mule‚Äôs 2004 album Deja Voodoo.\n\n14. Eric Clapton, Black Summer Rain . . . Lovely track from the 1976 album No Reason To Cry. Among the personnel on the album were Bob Dylan, all members of The Band, Ron Wood, ace session guitarist Jesse Ed Davis and Yvonne Elliman, who contributed vocals to four Clapton studio albums during the 1970s and was part of his touring band.\n\n15. Rory Gallagher, I‚Äôm Not Awake Yet . . . Typically fine guitar picking on this cantering cut from Gallagher‚Äôs second solo album ‚Äì Deuce, released in 1971 ‚Äì after the 1970 breakup of Taste.\n\n16. The Butterfield Blues Band, Just To Be With You . . . Soulful blues from Paul Buttefield and friends from the In Your Own Dream album, released in 1968.\n\n17. Kansas, Throwing Mountains . . . Great prog rock from a band that, like a lot of people, I first appreciated during the 1970s for their hits Carry On Wayward Son and Dust In The Wind but investigated more deeply, and was rewarded, as time passed. This one‚Äôs from a latter day album with a great title ‚Äì The Absence of Presence ‚Äì released in 2020.\n\n18. Patti Smith, Birdland . . . I‚Äôd describe this harrowing, nine-minute production from Smith‚Äôs debut release, the 1975 album Horses, as progressive punk stirring spoken word art rock. According to Wikipedia, it was inspired by A Book of Dreams, a 1973 memoir of Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich by his son Peter, and revolves around a narrative in which Peter, at his father‚Äôs funeral, imagines leaving on a UFO piloted by his father‚Äôs spirit.\n\n19. George Thorogood & The Destroyers, That‚Äôs It, I Quit . . . I‚Äôm outta here, quitting for the night as Thorogood covers a Nick Lowe-penned song, from The Destroyers‚Äô 2003 album Ride ‚ÄòTil I Die. The song was also done by English band Dr. Feelgood, released on the 1977 album Be Seeing You, produced by Lowe.\n\nMy track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.

Frank Zappa/The Mothers Of Invention (credited as The Mothers), Fifty-Fifty\n\n19. Rare Earth, Ma\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. Montrose, Space Station #5 . . . Montrose has been top of mind because I watched a documentary on Sammy Hagar last week, so here you go. Cool ‚Äòspace‚Äô intro and then into a propulsive hard rock tune from Montrose‚Äôs self-titled debut album, released in 1973 with Hagar of course on lead vocals. It‚Äôs where the eventual connections between Hagar and Van Halen arguably began. Eddie Van Halen was a fan of Montrose guitarist Ronnie Montrose and the Montrose album was produced by Ted Templeman, five years before Van Halen‚Äôs debut which was produced by Templeman among many Van Halen albums he was involved with, although just one, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, with the Van Hagar version of the band. Templeman, well-known for his production work with The Doobie Brothers and Van Morrison, also worked on solo albums by both Hagar and David Lee Roth.\n\n2. Atomic Rooster, Head In The Sky . . . Driving rocker from a progressive British band whose roots are traced to The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown (known for the single Fire) which featured the late keyboardist Vincent Crane and drummer Carl Palmer, before he left in 1970 after one album with Rooster to join Emerson, Lake and Palmer. This is from the band‚Äôs third album, In Hearing Of, released in 1971.\n\n3. Camel, Never Let Go . . . From the English progressive rock band‚Äôs self-titled debut album in 1973, melding acoustic and harder rock flourishes.\n\n4. J.J. Cale, Stay Around . . . Typical bluesy, relaxed groove from J.J., an artist I often say did essentially the same thing for countless albums yet was always different enough to never be boring or repetitive. This is the title cut from a 2019 posthumous release of to that point unreleased material. It was put together by Cale‚Äôs widow Christine Lakeland, who was a member of his band and appeared on many albums, and his longtime friend and manager, Mike Kappus, who also worked extensively with John Lee Hooker and Robert Cray, among others.\n\n5. Steely Dan, I Got The News . . . Funky, jazzy track from an often funky, jazzy band, from 1977‚Äôs Aja album.\n\n6. The Rolling Stones, Terrifying . . . A swinging tune from the 1989 album Steel Wheels. It was the fourth single released from the album, did reasonably well yet isn‚Äôt among the band‚Äôs well-known tracks in terms of widespread recognition. So, I‚Äôm happy to use it as a relative deep cut.\n\n7. Boz Scaggs, Runnin‚Äô Blue . . . Many people I think remember Boz Scaggs for hits like Lido Shuffle and Lowdown but, long before those hits he was a member of the pre-commercial hits Steve Miller Band during that group‚Äôs early, psychedelic and blues period, then a fine solo artist in his own right as evidenced by this rhythm and blues tune from his 1971 album Boz Scaggs & Band.\n\n8. Paris, Black Book . . . Hard rocking tune by a hard rocking, Led Zeppelin-ish band put together by mid-period Fleetwood Mac member and, later, solo artist Bob Welch, after he left Fleetwood Mac following 1974‚Äôs Heroes Are Hard To Find album. Also in the band, which released two albums in 1976, was former/original Jethro Tull bass player Glenn Cornick.\n\n9. Fleetwood Mac, Born Enchanter . . . And here‚Äôs Welch in a different light, on this jazzy, er, enchanting tune he wrote and sang for the aforementioned 1974 Fleetwood Mac album Heroes Are Hard To Find. It was Welch‚Äôs last of five albums with the Mac, which recruited Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham and went on to massive commercial success. The band was essentially three different groups: the early, blues-oriented outfit led by Peter Green, the Welch period and the Nicks-Buckingham lineup, all excellent in their own ways.\n\n10. Joe Cocker, Hitchcock Railway . . . Bouncy, jaunty track from Cocker‚Äôs second album, the 1969 release Joe Cocker! Cocker is joined by a host of session players including The Grease Band. That group, which backed Cocker at Woodstock, included such luminaries as keyboardist/bassist Chris Stainton, whose long list of credits include albums with Eric Clapton, Leon Russell (who also plays on the Cocker album), Spooky Tooth, Pete Townshend and Ian Hunter, and guitarist Henry McCullough, later of Paul McCartney and Wings.\n\n11. Jimi Hendrix, Ezy Ryder . . . From the first of countless posthumous Hendrix releases, the Cry Of Love which came out in March, 1971. I remember my older brother having it, him being a big Hendrix fan who introduced me to Jimi‚Äôs music. The album was comprised of material Hendrix was working on for a planned fourth studio album, which he never completed before his death. Ezy Ryder, a funk-driven rocker, is one of the few available studio recordings by the Band of Gypsys ‚Äì Hendrix, bass player Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles. The trio is well-known for the album Band of Gypsys, recorded at New York City‚Äôs Fillmore East venue as the calendar flipped from 1969 to 1970.\n\n12. Bill Withers, Harlem . . . Ever-escalating soul track from Withers‚Äô 1971 album Just As I Am. It‚Äôs the one featuring his biggest hit, Ain‚Äôt No Sunshine and is notable for the who‚Äôs who of musicians backing Withers, including Stephen Stills, Booker T. Jones and Donald ‚ÄòDuck‚Äô Dunn of of Booker T. and The M.G.‚Äôs fame, and session drummer to the stars Jim Keltner.\n\n13. Peter Gabriel, The Rhythm Of The Heat . . . Haunting track from Gabriel‚Äôs 1982 album, his fourth. It was called Security in North America and featured the hit Shock The Monkey, although Gabriel reluctantly went along with the ‚ÄòSecurity‚Äô nomenclature the record company wanted in order to differentiate the album from what preceded it. The first four Gabriel albums are officially called, simply, Peter Gabriel but the first three are also unofficially known and identifiable as, in order, Car, Scratch and Melt based on their cover art.\n\n14. Pink Floyd, Cymbaline . . . Early Floyd, a pastoral-type track whose sound is at odds with the dark lyrics. It‚Äôs from the More movie soundtrack, released in 1969. The movie, about drug addiction, is currently available on YouTube but, regardless, the album hangs together well as a stand-alone statement.\n\n15. Ten Years After, Convention Prevention . . . Typically fine boogie rock from TYA, from 1972‚Äôs Rock & Roll Music To The World album.\n\n16. Steve Earle, I‚Äôm Looking Through You (Beatles cover) . . . Earle gives the Rubber Soul song the country/bluegrass treatment; from his 1995 album Train a Comin‚Äô.\n\n17. Traffic, Many A Mile To Freedom . . . Beautiful track from The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys album, released in 1971. Jethro Tull, and I love that band, isn‚Äôt the only group employing fabulous flute playing ‚Äì here courtesy Chris Wood.\n\n18. Frank Zappa/The Mothers Of Invention (credited as simply The Mothers), Fifty-Fifty . . . Typically great guitar by Zappa on this one from 1973‚Äôs Over-Nite Sensation, coupled with the renowned Jean-Luc Ponty on violin. Vocals by Ricky Lancelotti, lost to the world to a drug overdose in 1980, age 35.\n\n19. Rare Earth, Ma . . . Epic, 17-minutes and change title track from the band‚Äôs 1973 album. Written by Motown ace songwriter/producer Norman Whitfield, who often teamed with Barrett Strong to write such classics as Papa Was A Rollin‚Äô Stone, to which Ma is considered to be something of a companion piece. Among their other collaborations: I Heard It Through The Grapevine, War and Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me).\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-08-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-08-hour-2.mp3\n\nMy track-by-track tales follow the bare-bones list.\n\n1.

Little Feat, I Do What The Telephone Tells Me To Do\n\n16. Santana, Every Step Of The Way (live, from Lotus)\n\nMy track-by-track tales:\n\n1. New Barbarians (Ron Wood, Keith Richards and famous musician friends), Am I Grooving You (live) . . . A song I first heard on Wood‚Äôs debut solo record, 1974‚Äôs I‚Äôve Got My Own Album To Do, first recorded in 1967 by American soul singer Freddie Scott. The New Barbarians were comprised of Wood, Richards, saxophonist and Rolling Stones session player/touring member Bobby Keys, renowned bassist Stanley Clarke, keyboardist Ian McLagan of Faces fame, who also played with the Stones on their 1978 tour of the United States, and drummer Joseph (Ziggy/Zigaboo) Modeliste of funk band The Meters. They toured the US in 1979 in support of Wood‚Äôs then new album Gimme Some Neck. They also stopped in Oshawa, Ontario for the Keith Richards/New Barbarians/Rolling Stones show I still can barely believe I somehow managed to get tickets to, proceeds to the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB). It was Richards‚Äô sentence for his 1978 conviction on drug charges resulting from an arrest in Toronto in 1977 around the time the Stones were in the city leading up to their famous club shows at the El Mocambo. That resulted in one vinyl side of the live album Love You Live and, more recently, a full-blown (and mind-blowing) 2-CD release of the shows, El Mocambo 1977, issued in 2022.\n\nThis live version is from New Barbarians: Live In Maryland ‚Äì Buried Alive, a document of the tour that was released in a 2-CD package in 2006. Am I Grooving You was c0-written by Bert Berns (aka Bert Russell; he was born Bert Russell Berns) and Jeff Barry, hitmakers extraordinaire with a long list they either wrote or co-wrote with others. From Berns: Twist and Shout, Piece Of My Heart, Here Comes The Night, Hang On Sloopy, Cry To Me and Everybody Needs Somebody To Love. From Barry: Do Wah Diddy Diddy, Da Doo Ron Ron, River Deep-Mountain High, Leader Of The Pack, Sugar Sugar and I Honestly Love You. Berns wasn‚Äôt with us long. He had a history of cardiac trouble after his heart was damaged by a childhood bout with rheumatic fever and died of heart failure in 1967, age 38. He was the subject of the 2016 film Bang! The Bert Berns Story.\n\n2. John Mayall, Gimme Some Of That Gumbo . . . Now age 90, the blues legend announced his retirement from touring in 2021, but left open the possibility of doing shows close to his California home. He‚Äôs released new studio albums, consistently, every two or three years, the most recent being The Sun Is Shining Down in 2022. This funky, bluesy number, featuring some fine lead guitar work from Rocky Athas, no longer in the band but who was with Mayall when I saw him at the 2011 Kitchener Blues Festival, is from the 2016 album Talk About That.\n\n3. Robin Trower, Victims Of The Fury . . . Spooky title track from Trower‚Äôs 1980 album, the last to feature the guitarist‚Äôs classic trio of himself, bassist/soulful singer James Dewar and drummer Bill Lordan.\n\n4. UFO, Queen Of The Deep . . . From 1974‚Äôs Phenomenon album, the third UFO album and first to feature guitarist Michael Schenker as the band moved to a more straightforward hard rock sound from their earlier space rock, psychedelic approach.\n\n5. Pat Benatar, My Clone Sleeps Alone . . . From her first, and still for my money best album, the 1979 debut release In The Heat Of The Night. Benatar hit it really big a year later with the Hit Me With Your Best Shot single from the Crimes Of Passion album, a good record, but I still prefer the first one.\n\n6. Budgie, Parents . . . And we enter the hard rock/metal portion of the show with this 10-minute piece from the Welsh band that never achieved widespread commercial success but was influential. Among Budgie‚Äôs disciples are Iron Maiden and Metallica, who covered Breadfan, a hellacious riff rocker I‚Äôve played before on the show, on the Garage, Inc. covers album.\n\n7. Dio, Don‚Äôt Talk To Strangers . . . The late Ronnie James Dio was a fantastic singer and while I like his work with his namesake band, I prefer his stuff fronting Rainbow and Black Sabbath during the time he was with those groups. Perhaps it‚Äôs because, while Dio the band had lots of fine guitarists, in Rainbow and Sabbath, Dio the singer was working with all-time great guitarist/songwriters Ritchie Blackmore and Tony Iommi. Still, as mentioned I do like Dio the band and this is a good song if you‚Äôre into hard rock/metal, from a solid record, Dio‚Äôs debut release, 1983‚Äôs Holy Diver.\n\n8. Black Sabbath, End Of The Beginning . . . Speaking of Sabbath, a doom metal track from 13, the final studio album by the group, released in 2013 which, according to bassist Geezer Butler, is part of the reason for the album title, apparently suggested by singer Ozzy Osbourne. Also according to Butler, the band was being pressured by the record company for a 13-song album but in the end just eight songs made the standard edition although my deluxe 2-CD version has 11 tracks. The original lineup ‚Äì Ozzy, Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward ‚Äì had previously reunited for a concert that resulted in the 1998 live album Reuion, which featured two new studio songs including the hit single Psycho Man. But 13 wasn‚Äôt a full reunion as Ward did not participate, citing contractual issues. Brad Wilk of Rage Against The Machine and Audioslave fame handled the drumsticks in Ward‚Äôs place.\n\nThe song title reminds me of Winston Churchill‚Äôs famous line, one of my favorites of his many, after the British victory over the Germans at El Alamein in North Africa in November, 1942 as the tide of World War II turned in favor of the Allies: ‚ÄúNow this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.‚Äù What an orator Churchill was.\n\n9. Bad Company, Evil Wind . . . Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Fantasy was the big hit on the 1979 album Desolation Angels, and it‚Äôs a good one along with the other single, Gone Gone Gone, but the release is full of great songs, this being one of them. ‚ÄúThat was full of Paul‚Äôs (singer Rodgers) tumbleweed across the plains imagery,‚Äù drummer Simon Kirke is quoted as saying in the liner notes booklet to The ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù Bad Company Anthology. ‚ÄúI think Paul was a cowboy or one of those bounty hunters in another life.‚Äù\n\n10. Jeff Beck, Let Me Love You . . . The Truth is, the album from which this comes is ridiculously good.\n\n11. ZZ Top, Snappy Kakkie . . . If you played this funky groove tune to casual, hits-oriented listeners and asked them to identify the band, I wonder whether they could. And it‚Äôs OK if they couldn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre all into what we‚Äôre into, as deeply as we want to be. But that‚Äôs what of course makes great bands and albums and shows the value of listening to deep cuts. From the Tejas album, 1976.\n\n12. Stevie Wonder, Another Star . . . I was spinning Wonder‚Äôs Songs In The Key Of Life the other day and was ‚Äòoh yeah‚Äô on this one, remembering it, having not heard it in a while. I‚Äôm playing the full 8:28 album version, which was cut down to five minutes and change for single release. The Latin-influenced exercise in rhythm was the fourth of five singles released from the album. I Wish, Isn‚Äôt She Lovely, Sir Duke and As were the others. Another Star made No. 32 on the US Billboard chart, No. 29 in the UK, No. 51 in Canada and No. 2 on Billboard‚Äôs dance/disco list.\n\n13. Joe Jackson, Blaze Of Glory . . . Title track to JJ‚Äôs 1989 album. Despite being full of good songs, like this one, it had just one single that charted to any great degree. That was Nineteen Forever, which made the top 20 in the USA. Another good one, Down To London, managed to make, wait for it, No. 126 in Australia, despite much critical acclaim both for the song and album. No wonder Jackson was disappointed; he thought the record represented some of his finest work and I agree, but then I‚Äôm a huge fan.\n\n14. Jethro Tull, Occasional Demons . . . Good rocker from the 1993 release Catfish Rising, one of my favorite later period (30 years ago now!) Tull albums.\n\n15. Little Feat, I Do What The Telephone Tells Me To Do . . . Prescient, perhaps, given the ubiquity of people and their (smart)phones although this song, from 2003‚Äôs latter-day Kickin‚Äô It At The Barn album, is more about actually calling on a phone or waiting for it to ring than, say, walking, head down and oblivious, texting or scrolling and risking bumping into people or something worse, say at a crosswalk. ‚ÄúHead‚Äôs up!‚Äù I have been known to say, sometimes to a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô response, other times drawing a dirty look. Anyway . . . Little Feat is still around, with original member and keyboard player Bill Payne still in the band as are longtime stalwarts Sam Clayton (congas, percussion, vocals) and bassist Kenny Gradney, both of whom have been in the lineup since 1972. And they‚Äôve just released a new album. It‚Äôs called Sam‚Äôs Place, Clayton does most of the singing and is well-suited to the mostly blues covers like Got My Mojo Working and Long Distance Call, which features Bonnie Raitt on co-lead vocals with Clayton.\n\n16. Santana, Every Step Of The Way (live, from Lotus) . . . Intoxicating instrumental that saw studio release as a nine-minute cut on 1972‚Äôs Caravanserai, whose 10 tracks included seven instrumentals as Santana moved in a jazz fusion direction. The Lotus version runs 11 minutes, 30 seconds featuring typically fiery fretwork from Carlos Santana along with the usual Santana band brew of bongos, congas and maracas.\n\nhttps://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-01-hour-1.mp3 https://radiowaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/So-Old-Its-New-2024-07-01-hour-2.mp3\n\nAn all-Canadian artists set for Canada Day.
