        "text": "Gone by Daylight is a 4 piece rock n' roll band from Western, MA. Their sound is filled with catchy as hell melodies, rockin' riffs and solos, and an unbeatable live show filled with loads of fun, energy, and charisma. The songs are solid and upbeat and are based on honest feelings and memories that anyone can relate to. The group originally formed in 2000 when Eric and Shaanan decided to start a band in the 7th grade. Along with Jordan on bass, the group wrote pop punk songs, the most fun music to play at their age. As they got older, other influences were thrown into the mix, those including the rock n' roll that inspired them to pick up their instruments and the growing underground metal and hardcore scene of Western Massachusetts. They recorded their first demo in 2002. It circulated for a few years under the names Donkey Punch and Piranha. They stayed a trio until late 2004 when Jordan switched to second guitar. They went through two bassists until Dan started jamming with them in the early summer of 2005. As a solid 4 piece rock n' roll band, the energy was increased along with the creativity. Dan's heart and vision was the same as the rest of the guys, and the chemistry was immediate. They had spent 2004 recording a full length when they were still a 3 piece. Once the lineup was solid and the name Gone by Daylight was decided on, they were finally ready to put out the album. \"Love Grooves\", a collection of songs that were written from 2002-2004, was released on Warhol Records in the late summer of 2005. They ended the summer by playing the closing date of the Vans Warped Tour on the Triple Crown Stage and landing a spot on this years SkateFest. With an album under their belts they are finally ready to take their music out of Western Mass and out on the road. Gone by Daylight has always believed in working hard and setting goals for themselves. The friendship and brotherhood between Shaanan, Jordan, Eric, and Dan is mainly what holds them together; along with the same love and passion for music. They are more than dedicated to what they do, and to the vision they have for their band. Gone by Daylight plan on touring as much as possible and delivering a tighter, more fun filled performance with every show. They are having the time of their lives playing music together, and hope you will also enjoy their take on rock n' roll.\n\nShow More"
