        "text": "In late 2013 Enjoy The Ride Records announced one their releases, which was a joint effort with Fadeaway Records, a not defunct, but dormant label. It was a compilation on a grand scale. It wound up being a triple LP featuring unreleased songs from many popular indie scene bands. Profits from the comp went towards cancer research. Some of the bands on this comp included Brand New, Saves The Day, Motion City Soundtrack, Hot Rod Circuit, Nightmare Of You, Far , Fred Mascherino of Taking Back Sunday and Terrible Things fame, The Honorary Title, Vinnie Caruana of The Movielife and I Am The Avalanche fame, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra fame, Matt Pryor, Reggie And The Full Effect, Head Automatica, Frank Iero of My Chemical Romance fame, and Kevin Devine. It was comprised mostly of bands producer and head of Fadeaway Records, Michael Dubin, worked with or had some connection to over the years. The comp was simply entitled Friends.\n\nThe record is housed in a triple panel gatefold jacket and comes with an insert to boot. Each copy is also hand numbered out of the variant total, not the total amount of copies pressed. All copies were also pressed on colored vinyl, some sort of splatter was used for the several variants this comp has. There were some, what I feel were shady goings-on with the variants.\n\nThere is a “1st press” and a “2nd press” of this record. I use the quotes because they really are one combined pressing. The “1st press” sold out, rather slower than expected, and right on the heels of it selling out, before the “1st press” even shipped, a “2nd” pressing was announced and put up for pre-order. Anyone with common sense would say how can there be a second pressing when the records from the first pressing were not even done and pressed yet.\n\nThe nonsense with the variants continued even after all the “pressings” were announced, as the “1st press” had a friends press, limited to 100 copies. When the comp was first announced there was no mention that there would be a friends press, only that the comp would be limited to 500 copies. Since it took so long to sell out the actual 400 copies of the pressing that were available to the public didn’t matter. It continued still with the“2nd” pressing, as it had a friends press of sorts, which was called an “extra special variant.” I’m not making that up for giggles, the two labels responsible for this comp actually called it that; “extra special variant.” This “extra special variant” was split into two groups; 50 copies were randomly given out in orders for the “2nd pressing” and 50 copies could only be pre-ordered at the compilations’ record release show. Yes, a compilation album comprised of unreleased songs had a release show, where I should point out none of the bands featured on the comp played.\n\nSo the pressing info for this comp is as follows: “1st press” – 400 copies on red/white/black splatter and 100 copies on red/clear/white splatter (friends press). “2nd press” – 500 copies on milky clear/red/blue/yellow splatter and 100 copies on black/blue/white splatter (“extra special variant”). Again, a triple panel gatefold jacket houses the records. An insert is also include.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this comp is the price gouging and downright ripping off of people. The comp cost $40 before shipping, a bit outrageous but since it was a triple LP and came in a nice jacket with an insert it became a bit easier to swallow. My justifiable pricing, a price which I consider acceptable for multi-disc releases is $10 per LP. So in that train of thought this should be closer to $30 than $40. Again, the finer points of the release somewhat justify the price tag. After hearing how much it cost to produce this comp, which was stated publicly by the head of Fadeaway Records on a public message board (and which I took a screen shot of for posterity), each copy cost at most $20 to produce. I understand the business model of doubling your money or don’t bother, but in this case that markup is a bit drastic.\n\nThe shipping charges are where I have a major problem; I find them unacceptable. Fadeaway Records charged $9 for shipping, and they wound up shipping it media mail, which as well all known is the cheapest shipping method available for records. The actual cost on my mailer said $3.65; factor in material costs (guy who runs the labels packaged orders himself so no employee costs) and shipping shouldn’t have been more than $6, and that’s being generous.Fadeaway Records justified the price points as, direct quote; “The proceeds are going to charity. Any overages on shipping will be donated to charity.”\n\nI have no problems with charitable donations, but customers, anyone really, shouldn’t be forced to pay more money so someone else can make a bigger donation to charity. If I wanted to donate more of my money to charity I would donate the money directly to the charity of my choosing myself. That decision shouldn’t be made by someone else and it definitely shouldn’t be made by a bias third party.\n\nAfter a long wait Hot Rod Circuit’s The Underground Is A Dying Breed was released on vinyl. A joint release between Enjoy The Ride Records and Thunderbeard Records, there were four variants for the record which was spread out across the 1,000 total copies pressed. There were 225 copies on orange with black smoke, which was an Enjoy The Ride exclusive, 225 copies on sky blue, which was a Thunderbeard exclusive, 400 copies on gray, which was a Hot Topic exclusive and lastly there was a secret variant limited to 100 copies that was a quad split consisting of orange with black smoke and a darker blue than the sky blue regular variant. The quad split is patterned after a radioactive shield, so going clockwise a ¼ of the record is orange with black smoke, the next ¼ is blue, the next ¼ is orange, the next ¼ is blue.\n\nEnjoy The Ride has been doing these secret variants for their last few releases. They’re the most limited variant and are randomly given out in orders. This time around all outlets selling any of the variants were allotted a percentage of the secret variant pressing ( % out of the 100 copies) and they were shipped in orders in place of the regular variants ordered (orange with black smoke, sky blue or gray). All copies were sealed so odds are people packing up orders did not even know who or what orders were getting the secret variant.\n\nAll copies of the record also came packaged with a bonus 7” featuring the acoustic EP that was released a bit after the regular album came out back in 2007. Also include on this bonus 7” is a cover of the Hot Rod Circuit song “At Nature’s Mercy” performed by Max Bemis. The download code included with the record includes the full album and all the songs found on the bonus 7” as well. This release is the only place to get this Max Bemis cover, at least to my knowledge. This bonus 7” is pressed on cola brown and since it came with every copy of the record it’s limited to 1,000 copies. The 7” does not come with any jacket or sleeve, just a plain white paper dust sleeve. The 7” is housed inside the gatefold jacket for the LP. It slides into a pocket cut into one of the panels.\n\nThis was the first time and what will likely be the last time I ever order anything from Run For Cover Records due to their lackadaisical and somewhat arrogant approach to shipping orders. I heard about their horrible track record with shipping orders (taking months to ship or not shipping at all), and thankfully up until this Hot Rod Circuit 7″, RFC has not released anything I had a desire for. I’ll give some details on this 7″ before delving into my issues with RFC.\n\nThis is Hot Rod Circuit’s first new material in about four years, and their first after coming out of a break up/hiatus. The 7″ contains two new original songs plus a Superdrag cover. It was pressed on three color variants, “Halloween,” which is orange and limited to 100 copies, Cyan Blue limited to 300 copies and black limited to 600 copies. As of right now orange is the only color tha is sold out. As of writing this, the band is currently selling blue and black copies on their current reunion tour.\n\nAs stated above RFC racked up a reputation of horrible mail order service, needing several emails just to figure out where orders are then several more to get your order shipped, if you were lucky enough to have your order ship at all. To stave off some of the anticipated negative remarks on message boards, RFC said their latest round of release/pre-orders would arrive on the release dates as they already had most of the records in hand, they were just waiting to ship them closer to the release date and would start shipping orders five days ahead of the release to ensure delivery on release date. Now I’m not one to expect orders to ship immediately or expect my records to arrive the next day, but if you make a claim that all releases will ship five days ahead of release day to try to get them to their destination ahead of or on the release date, you better at least ship them on the actual release date. The release date for the Hot rod Circuit 7″ was November 1, and my order did not actually ship until November 9. Download codes, which were suppose to be included with the records, were not included. But knowing full well download codes were not included with the records, RFC did not send out codes to customers via email till November 17.\n\nTerrible Things is a side project/sort of super group that features Andy Jackson, Fred Mascherino and Josh Eppard. Jackson is most notably the front man of Hot Rod Circuit and is also in Death In The Park. Mascherino is most noted for once being in Taking Back Sunday, and is also in another side/solo project The Color Fred. Eppard is most famous for once being in Coheed And Cambria.\n\nThis 7″ was a Record Store Day 2010 exclusive release, and it really doesn’t have an official title. There is no title printed on the jacket or the labels. There are two demo versions of songs on the 7″ that later went onto Terrible Things’ debut full length album. This was intended as a promo 7″ and was given away for free at select stores on RSD to anyone who purchased a RSD exclusive release. Not all stores that participated in RSD received copies of this 7″. Since it’s a promo release, pressing info is not out there, at least to my knowledge.\n\nIf you were fortunate enough to get one on RSD consider yourself lucky, if you didn’t get one and you’re looking for a copy they are few and far between. I have only seen two on ebay since this past April. One sold for close to $10 and the other one sold a few weeks for $1.25. Since this is a rarity on ebay the market value for this 7″ has not been steadied or even really placed yet. I know many record stores still have copies of this lying around. Some have them up for sale in their racks, some are posting them on ebay and others are continuing to give these away either under certain stipulations or to anyone who asks for it."
