        "text": "Marty Rhone was born as Karel (or Karl) Lawrence van Rhoon on 7 May 1948 in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) His father was Eddy Emile van Rhoon, his mother was Judith Olive. She was a singer and actress, who met Eddy through the Sydney jazz scene; he was a visiting pianist. The couple married in 1947, and migrated to Australia on 21 April 1950 and briefly lived in Sydney and Brisbane, and then moved to Darwin.\n\nRhone was taught piano by his father but he preferred singing. In August 1959, aged 11, he first performed publicly at Darwin's Mitchell Street Town Hall in Around the World in 80 Minutes – a charity variety concert – alongside his father on piano and his mother. After he finished primary school, the family moved to Sydney.\n\nIn mid-1961, Rhone appeared on a talent quest segment of ATN7-TV series, Tarax Show, and was offered a singing spot on a children's show,\n\nDuring 1966 Marty Rhone and The Soul Agents supported The Rolling Stones on the United Kingdom rock group's tour of Australia. They also performed on the bill of the P.J. Proby Show at the Sydney Stadium with Wayne Fontana, Eden Kane and The Bee Gees appearing. Rhone moved to Melbourne and issued five singles on Spin Records but had \"limited success\".\n\nIn March 1970, Rhone was conscripted for National Service until 1972. During his service he attended the Royal Military College, Duntroon, as a member of their band, for 18 months.\n\nFrom April 1972 to July 1973 he acted in the Australian stage version of Godspell at The Richbrooke, Sydney with Rod Dunbar, Peita Toppano and John Waters. The Australian cast soundtrack album was issued as Godspell: a Musical Based on the Gospel According to St. Matthew on His Master's Voice. He attended the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and in July 1973 he released a new single, \"Goodbye in May\". He composed the music for Ruzzante Returns from the Wars, which starred Ivar Kants Rhone followed with appearances on TV soap operas, Number 96 (1974) and Class of '75 (1975).\n\nBy mid-1975 Rhone had signed with M7 Records and issued his next single, \"Denim and Lace\", which peaked at No. 8 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. It was promoted on the Class of '75 soundtrack album. It was co-written by L Lister (aka Jack Aranda) and F Lyons (aka Shad Lyons). Lister and Lyons also produced Rhone's debut album, Denim and Lace, recording at Alberts Studio 139. At the end of the year \"Denim and Lace\" was the second highest selling single in Australia. His next single, \"Star Song\", reached the Top 50, the next two were less successful, while the last one for the year, \"On the Loose\" reached the Top 40. Of the four singles, \"On the Loose (Again)\" – co-written by Bryan Dawe and Steve Groves (ex-Tin Tin)– was used by Rhone to win the 1976 Australian Popular Song Festival and represented Australia at the World Popular Song Festival. In June 1977 he had another hit with \"Mean Pair of Jeans\", which reached No. 10. In July 1978 Rhone relocated to London. In June 1979, Rhone took the role of Lun Tha in the London Palladium presentation of The King and I alongside Yul Brynner and Virginia McKenna. By September 1981 he had returned to Sydney.\n\nIn 1987 Rhone became a business manager for a trio of brothers, the Australian boxers: Dean, Guy and Troy Waters. In December 1988 Rhone organised the \"Battle on the Beach\" for January 1989 with Dean Waters, as Australian heavyweight champion, to fight New Zealand's title holder.\n\nIn 2007, Rhone performed a repertoire of tracks by Cliff Richard; a gig at the Crown Casino, Melbourne, in late 2008 it was filmed and broadcast in February the next year as Marty Rhone: A Tribute to Cliff Richard and The Shadows. In May 2011 on the Cliff & Dusty presentation he performed with Sheena Crouch as UK pop singer Dusty Springfield and in June 2012 with his own \"musical theatre fantasy\" covering Richard's and The Beatles' material in Cliff Joins The Beatles.\n\nIn August 2016, Rhone released 50th Anniversary Album, a career spanning compilation album.\n\nSusan Kay Quatro was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1950, and grew up pursuing performing. Suzi was playing bongos on stage with her father’s jazz band by the age of eight, and by 14 she’s changed her name to Suzi soul and had left school to become a Go-Go dancer.\n\nBy the age of 15, Suzi was fronting the band the Pleasure Seekers, with her sisters. The band toured the country and were invited to Vietnam to entertain troops, before changing their name to Cradle in the early 1970’s and transitioning to a more hard-rock sound.\n\nIt was performing with Cradle where Suzi was first noticed by British producer Mickie Most, who was interested in Suzi as a solo performer. Mickie invited her to London and introduced her to professional songwriters Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, which turned out to be a winning formula.\n\nIn 1973, “Can the Can” flew to number one and went on to sell two and a half million copies worldwide. Between 1973 and 1980, Suzi featured in the British charts for no less than 101 weeks, and has sold to date over 55 million records.\n\nSince then, she has released fifteen studio albums, ten compilation albums, and one live album. Other songs, including \"48 Crash\", \"Daytona Demon\", \"The Wild One\", and \"Your Mama Won't Like Me\", also charted highly overseas.\n\nWhile Suzi enjoyed great success both in the UK and Australia, she is mostly known in the US for her cameo on hit TV show Happy Days as Leather Tuscadero. However the appearance might’ve helped her duet \"Stumblin' In\" with Smokie's lead singer Chris Norman reach No. 4 in the US.\n\nSuzi is still active, writing, broadcasting, recording, and this year she’s embarking on her 38th tour of Australia.\n\nBorn Christopher John Cheney in 1975, Chris graduated with a VCE from Wheelers Hill Secondary College. Chris played guitar since age 6 and studied jazz at Box Hill Tafe in 1994-95. However, it was at a barbecue Chris' was introduced by his sister to Scott Owen. In 1992 they formed a cover band called 'The Runaway Boys' taken from a Stray Cats song of the same name which performed covers of the band's songs with the odd original song thrown in.\n\nIn 1994 he got his first album with The Living End who formed with a drummer called Joe Piripitzi who was later kicked out for musical differences. In 1995 the EP 'Hellbound' was released and The Living End was made. In 1996 they released another EP called 'It's For Your Own Good' and had success by sending a T-shirt to Green Day for a gig as their supporting act.\n\nIn 1997 after Joe was replaced with new drummer Trav Demsey, The Living End cut their first single, entitled \"Prisoner Of Society/Second Solution\". Two songs from their debut album. This followed up with more success of their self-titled album 'The Living End'. In 2000 this followed with the album 'Roll On'.\n\nIn 2001 Chris was involved in a severe car accident with his girlfriend Emma who escaped with minor injuries but left Chris in a wheelchair with a broken leg and 3 pins to replace some of the muscle that was damaged. After 2 years of resting and writing songs for the new album they were back in the studio where Trav quit due to a disliking of heavy touring and to spend more time with his family. The Living End were stranded. They spent two days auditioning 40 drummers of which the first was Andy Strachan. Their current drummer. The boys hit the studio and recorded a 14 track album entitled 'Modern ARTillery' which was released in 2003. In 2004 the boys hit the studio once more to record 2 more tracks, \"I Can't Give You What I Haven't Got\" and \"Bringin' It All Back Home\". This was a greatest hits album called 'From Here On In: The Singles (1997-2004)'. The same year he formed tribute super group The Wrights with Nic Cester (Jet) - Bernard Fanning (Powderfinger) - Phil Jamieson (Grinspoon) - Kram (Spiderbait) - Davey Lane (You Am I/The Pictures) and Pat Bourke (Dallas Crane). He performed with the band as the lead and rhythm guitarist for parts 1 and 3 respectively and later released Stevie Wrights hit Evie with all three songs of \"Evie: (Let You Hair Hang Down)\", \"Evie: (Evie)\" which Chris was not involved with and \"Evie: (I'm Losing You)\".\n\nIt wasn't until 2005 the boys hit the studio again to record the fifth album entitled \"State Of Emergency\" released in 2006. After almost a year and a half of touring Chris left the band and took up yoga and painting while his other band mates hit the surf. It wasn't until late 2007 that they hit the studio again to write and rehearse songs which resulted in the band's sixth studio album 'White Noise' with a single of the same name.\n\nSince then the boys have been performing to the general public throughout Australia, Japan, USA and more.\n\nPeter first came to prominence with Stylus in 1975, releasing four albums with hits such as ‘Summer Breeze’ and ‘World of Make Believe’ before the band split in 1980.\n\nA successful solo career followed throughout the 80’s, with a top 20 hit for his first release, ‘Fear of Thunder’, and success with the song ‘Blame it on the Weather’ – not only for Peter but also for John Farnham, whose voice, incidentally, Peter’s soaring vocals are often compared to. Peter also became a regular on TV shows such as The Midday Show, Hey Hey It’s Saturday, Tonight Live, and Carols by Candlelight at the Myer Music Bowl.\n\nOther albums released include ‘Still Alive’ (with a reformed Stylus); ‘Changes’, ‘Bac2basix’ – a roots album filled with wonderful storytelling songs such as ‘Pioneers’, ‘Family’ and the ‘Poor Man’s Al Jolson; a jazz standards album, ‘About Time’; and ‘Home Grown’ – Peter’s own tribute to some of his favourite Aussie artists.\n\nOver the last decade, Peter has toured both solo and with Stylus, and with his close friend, Australian rock legend, the late Jon English. Their collaborative show, Uncorked’, filled with nostalgia and good humoured banter, delighted audiences everywhere throughout Australia.\n\nPeter works with many charities and has written songs for the ‘Make a Wish Foundation’ and the ‘Sacred Heart Foundation’.\n\nHis album, ‘OBSERVATIONS’ – which he describes as ‘a collection of songs that look at the heart of our everyday existence, some personal, some not’ – was released in October 2016. “I am extremely proud of this album,’ says Cupples. “I truly believe it is probably one of the best things I’ve ever done.”\n\nHe is now bringing a night of great entertainment to the Taphouse with the songs of Burt Bacharach. From 'Say a Little Prayer' to 'What the World Needs Now' enjoy the songs you know and love.\n\nMelbourne-born sisters, Vika and Linda Bull, grew up singing at church, and were taught how to harmonize by their Tongan mother.\n\nThe talented siblings first made their mark as members of Joe Camilleri’s The Black Sorrows in the late 1980s, also providing backing vocals for other artists including Hunters and Collectors, Archie Roach, John Farnham, Deborah Conway, and Paul Kelly.\n\nIn 1994 they left the band to launch their own career as a duo, releasing their debut self-titled album that same year. The album was produced by Kelly, and peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart, reaching certified platinum and nominated for an ARIA Music Award in 1995 for 'Breakthrough Artist – Album'.\n\nVika and Linda had four singles, “Hard Love”, \"We've Started a Fire\", \"When Will You Fall For Me\", and \"House of Love”, the latter two were featured as backing music on the soap opera, Home and Away.\n\nThe pair have since had near-inseparable careers, releasing eight studio albums and twenty-one singles, collaborating closely with the likes of Paul Kelly, Diesel and Renée Geyer and cementing their place as national musical treasure.\n\nVika and Linda have a long and decorated music career, with constant critical acclaim, including four ARIA Award nominations for Best Adult Contemporary Album, a Special Recognition Award at the Pacific Music Awards, and performed the national anthem at the AFL Grand Final.\n\nIn 2019 they were inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame and in 2020, their retrospective album 'Akilotoa: Anthology (1994-2006) entered the Australian charts at number one, making Vika and Linda the first Australian female duo to debut at No. 1. They are currently finalists for the Artistic Excellence Award at the 2023 Australian Women in Music Awards.\n\nTheir music has traversed genres over the past three decades, incorporating rock, country, gospel, reggae, R&B, soul and blues, as well as paying tribute to their rich Tongan heritage.\n\nMike Brady was born in England and moved with his family to Australia when he was 11 years old. His recording career began in the mid 60’s with the formation of MPD Ltd (Mike, Pete & Danny).\n\nAfter MPD Ltd, Mike spent the majority of his time building his career as producer and writer of jingles for Television and Radio. One such jingle brought Mike back into the public spotlight. He was asked to record a promotional song for Channel Seven’s Football program. This song being “Up There Cazaly” went on to be the biggest selling local single of its time, with sales in excess of 250,000 and has become the unofficial Anthem of all Australian Rules Football Fans.\n\nOver the years, he has been responsible for some of Australia’s most catchy advertising jingles.\n\nDuring the 70’s Mike formed his own Record Label and Record Production Company, Full Moon Records., and publishing company, Remix Publishing. Two hugely successful singles released by Full Moon were Mark Jackson’s “I’m An Individual” and Joe Dolce’s “Shuddap You Face”. “Shuddap You Face” broke the record previously held by Mike’s “Up There Cazaly” as the biggest selling single in Australian History and has been translated into many different languages.\n\nMike and his company have produced albums for artists such as Tina Arena, Colleen Hewett, Mark Gillespie and Mike Rudd and Bill Putt. Many of Mike’s songs have been recorded by leading artists including Tina Arena, and John Farnham.\n\nIn June 2013 Brady was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for services to the community and to music as a composer and performer.\n\nOn Monday 3rd July 2017 Mike was honored to be named Victorian of the Year in a ceremony in Melbourne.\n\nBill Armstrong - Legendary Music Producer was born in 1929.\n\nThe Melbourne audio technician-turned-producer has been at the forefront of the local music industry for more than 60 years.\n\nIn the mid-50s, Armstrong was working as a \"balance officer\" at ABC Radio, producing live-to-air programs, outside broadcasts and variety shows and working with the likes of Graham Kennedy. In 1956, he was charged with overseeing the PA system at the main stadium of the Melbourne Olympic Games.\n\nIn 1965, Armstrong opened his own studio in a small terrace house in Albert Rd, South Melbourne. One of the first pop recordings made there was the backing track for The Easybeats' 1965 breakthrough hit \"She's So Fine\", which was overseen by British-born engineer Roger Savage. Over the next few years the studios expanded into six adjoining properties, including four studios equipped with 4-track machines. In 1968 Armstrong installed one of the first 8-track recorders in Australia, followed by 16 and then 24-track machines, together with state-of-the-art mixing desks in the early '70s. During this time, many of Australia's most distinguished producers and engineers worked there. The original engineering team were Roger Savage, Allan Pay and Philip Webster. Armstrong's studios soon overtook two other major studios in Australia at the time - the EMI and Festival Records facilities in Sydney - to become the most sought-after recording venue in the country, and the \"engine room\" of Australian pop and rock recording. Many of the most popular and successful Australian recordings from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s were made there, including hit albums and singles by The Masters Apprentices, The Twilights, The Groove, The Groop, Zoot, The Aztecs, Russell Morris, Brian Cadd, Daddy Cool, Franciscus Henri, Hans Poulsen, Spectrum, John Farnham, Skyhooks, Little River Band, The Sports, Models and many others. Many famous overseas artists also recorded there while visiting Australia, including Earl Hines, Cleo Laine and John Dankworth, and Stephane Grapelli.[2]\n\nArmstrong left the company in 1977 and stuck with the music industry, working as the manager of SBS Radio in Sydney and Melbourne before establishing the first commercial FM radio station in 1980, EON FM, now Triple M. His contribution to the industry has been well recognised – an ARIA for Lifetime contribution to the Australian Music Industry, the Advance Australia Award for outstanding contribution to the industry and commerce, an APRA for Outstanding Contribution to the music industry and the National Film and Sound Archive's Cochrane-Smith award for his contribution to Sound Heritage, among them.\n\nBill Armstrong - Legendary Music Producer was born in 1929.\n\nThe Melbourne audio technician-turned-producer has been at the forefront of the local music industry for more than 60 years.\n\nIn the mid-50s, Armstrong was working as a \"balance officer\" at ABC Radio, producing live-to-air programs, outside broadcasts and variety shows and working with the likes of Graham Kennedy.

He grew up in Richmond with a younger sister, Josephine \"Jo\". Early in his career he performed as Johnny Lo Piccolo. From the age of 11 he played piano accordion on TV talent quests, such as Brian and the Juniors, New Faces, variety shows, including In Melbourne Tonight, and at clubs in Melbourne.\n\nJohn St Peeters and the Sharells were formed in 1974, as a vocal trio, with two female vocalists, Niki Nicholls and Kim Julin. They performed \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" on the Ernie Sigley Show in May 1975. They toured Australia, North America and South-East Asia before issuing a single, \"Take Me if You Want Me\", in October on the Astor label. He resumed his solo career in 1976 with a disco-based single, \"You Know that You're Sexy\", in November of that year.\n\nPeeters signed with EMI Records, which issued his next three singles, \"Shiny Side Up\" (June 1977), \"Fadin' Away\" (October) and \"Love the Way You Move\" (December): At the King of Pop Awards of 1977 St Peeters won Most Popular New Talent. In the following year his contract was taken up by RCA Records. He released his next single, \"Deep Inside of Me\", co-written by Peeters and Aldo Lennard, He followed with his debut album, So Many Ways (1978), produced by Spencer Lee. In 1979 he formed the John St Peeters Band and toured the Australia club circuit. He appeared on teen pop music TV show, Countdown, from 1976, he co-hosted an episode in June 1978. He later reflected \"The biggest thrill of all, though, was making it on the biggest television music show that existed during those years — Countdown, hosted by Molly Meldrum. What a fantastic experience that was.\" He premiered his single, \"Wonder World\", on the show in March 1980; it is the theme song for Simon Townsend's Wonder World, a children's variety TV series.\n\nBorn on 10 May 1946 in Manchester, Graham was given his first guitar at the age of 11 and started playing with local bands at 15. He received early encouragement to develop his musical talent from his mother Betty and father Hymie, who also contributed with suggested lyrics and song titles.\n\nGraham played with various Manchester bands before forming The Mockingbirds in 1965 (with Kevin Godley on drums), and when the record label Columbia rejected Graham’s first single composition for the band, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The song, For Your Love, became a huge hit for The Yardbirds.\n\nWorking by day in a men’s outfitters shop and playing by night with his semi-professional band, Graham went on to write a string of hits, such as Pamela, Pamela for Wayne Fontana, For Your Love, Evil Hearted You and Heart Full of Soul (The Yardbirds), Bus Stop and Look Through Any Window (The Hollies), No Milk Today and Listen People (Herman’s Hermits), and Tallyman for Jeff Beck.\n\nIn 1972, along with Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, he formed 10cc and enjoyed a string of Top 10 hits, including three No 1s – Rubber Bullets, I’m Not In Love and Dreadlock Holiday – along with Donna (No 2), Art For Art’s Sake and Good Morning Judge (both reaching No 5), The Things We Do For Love and I’m Mandy Fly Me (6), and The Wall Street Shuffle (10).\n\nIt’s the enduring popularity of these tracks, along with others such as Bridge To Your Heart from Graham’s time in Wax with the late Andrew Gold and songs from film soundtracks including Animalympics, that led to the formation of Heart Full of Songs. Needless to say, the band also features tracks from Graham’s acclaimed solo albums, And Another Thing, Love And Work, Play Nicely And Share and 2020’s Modesty Forbids.\n\nPatrick Simmons born October 19, 1948 is an American musician best known as a founding member of the rock band The Doobie Brothers (whom he was inducted as a member of into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, he has been the only consistent member of the band throughout their tenure.\n\nIn 1970, a California-based power trio consisting of Tom Johnston, Skip Spence, and John Hartman, teamed up with Simmons to form a group together. They would call themselves “The Doobie Brothers”, after their friend Keith \"Dyno\" Rosen, who either lived with or next to the band told them\n\nWhy don't you call yourself the Doobie Brothers because you're always smoking pot?\n\nSimmons wrote and sang many songs for the Doobie Brothers, including \"South City Midnight Lady\", \"Dependin' On You\", \"Echoes of Love\", \"Wheels of Fortune\" and \"Black Water\", the group's first #1 record.\n\nPatrick sang lead on many Doobie Brothers songs, such as Listen to the Music.\n\nThe group's 1978 studio album, Minute by Minute, which reached number one for five weeks, and won the band a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, while the single \"What A Fool Believes\" from the album won three Grammys itself.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 200 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on November 7, 2020.[2][3] The group has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide.\n\nReyne was born in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nHe formed a band called Spiff Rouch. By early 1978 Spiff Rouch had split, and Reyne formed Clutch Cargo, with Binks, Robinson, Williams and his younger brother David Reyne.\n\nIn late 1978, Clutch Cargo was renamed Australian Crawl and started to gain popularity on the pub circuit. The band went on to sell more than one million albums in Australia in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1987, Reyne released his self titled debut solo album and started the \"Rip it Up\" tour. The first two singles released from the album, \"Fall of Rome\" and \"Hammerhead.\n\nHis debut was followed in May 1989 by his next solo release, Hard Reyne, which featured the hits \"House of Cards\" (#17 ARIA Charts and \"One More River\" (#22 ARIA Charts.\n\nIn 1991, Electric Digger Dandy was released. \". It remains Reyne's highest-charting album in Australia, reaching No. 3 on the ARIA albums chart.\n\nIn 1992, he recorded a duet with country singer James Blundell. Later that year he joined former Sherbet frontman Daryl Braithwaite, Jef Scott and Simon Hussey to create the album Company of Strangers, which spawned three Australian top 50 singles: \"Motor City ,\"Sweet Love\", \"Daddy's Gonna Make You a Star.\n\nOctober 1994 saw the release of his fourth album, on the RooArt label, The Whiff of Bedlam, recorded in Los Angeles with Stewart Levine.\n\nReyne returned to the studio in 1997 to work with producer Ashley Caddell. Now signed to Village Roadshow Music, the first release was \"Brand New Emperor's Clothes\" in October 1997.\n\nIn 2004 he released Speedboats for Breakfast, which included the singles \"Bug\" and \"The Rainbow's Dead End\".\n\nReyne hosted Dig, a music show on ABC2 (2006–2007), and made an appearance on The AFL Footy Show in Melbourne in 2006.

Toon Town Lullaby released in July 2020.\n\nTemperley was born in 1978 in Mosman Park, Western Australia, and grew up in Fremantle. At seven years of age, his name was changed to 'Satyam Kavyen Temperley'—Temperley is his mother's maiden name and 'Satyam Kavyen' means \"Poet of Truth\".\n\nThe Temperley family were members of the 'Orange People' (Rajneesh movement) and made trips to India as well Oregon, United States, throughout the early 1980s.\n\nBetween the ages of seven and 12, Temperley attended the Lance Holt School, a Fremantle community school. At the age of thirteen, he accompanied his mother on a trip to India, where they stayed at the Osho International Meditation Resort in Pune. It was during this trip that he enrolled in an international alternative boarding school in Devon called Ko Hsuan that is based on the teachings of controversial Indian mystic Osho. Temperley was accepted as a boarder and remained at the school for a year:\n\n“That was an amazing place, musically. They had a really good music room. If we had two periods of math, in between we'd run off and jam for 10 minutes. We'd come back and be totally chilled because we'd gotten all that nervous energy out of our systems.”\n\nTemperley referred to his time at Ko Hsuan as his \"saving grace\", and it was there that he discovered a passion for music before he returned to Fremantle and John Curtin High School due to homesickness:\n\n“Then I thought I was going to become an actor until I started wagging school and writing songs.”\n\nKav Temperley was frontman, bassist and songwriter of legendary Australian Rock band and 1990’s Indie icons, Eskimo Joe. With 6 studio albums under their belts and sales in excess of 750,000, in Australia alone, the band has seen 3 of those albums debut at number 1 on the ARIA charts, with steamroller ‘Black Fingernails, Red Wine’ shining for a monster 62 weeks in the ARIA Chart Top 50 and “Foreign Land”, from their 4th album ‘Inshalla', bringing home 2 APRA Awards, for Most Played Rock Song on Australian radio and Best Rock Song of 2010.\n\nAusten Tayshus is always, as a matter of principle, pushing the boundaries, and entering the quagmire of Political Correctness throwing hand grenades all to stomp on narrow-mindedness and mediocrity to wake people up to alternative ideas.\n\nHe performs anywhere-from outback bowls clubs, to hipster pubs in Melbourne and Adelaide, Universities, Theatres, and Rock Concerts all over Australia, to refine and define his craft.\n\nWhen he strides on stage no-one he knows what is going to happen. He can improvise brilliantly, impersonate creatively, offend everyone, satirise anything and talk louder than anyone. He magically creates a masterful night of gut- laughing totally uncensored, exciting entertainment\n\nSome people don’t like it, so he goes in harder. He shakes it up. He can control anY audience. If they do not like it, they should have stayed at home.\n\nThis is how he makes a living. Driving thousands of kilometres, a year, he has seen more of Australia than any other performer. He keeps doing it because he loves it.\n\nHis biggest hit ‘Australiana,’broke sales records in Australia in 1983. It was on top of the charts for 13 weeks and was the biggest selling single of the year and remains the biggest selling Australian Single EVER.\n\nBut it is his love of Stand-Up that rules his life. He is a complete master at it. No audience, no hecklers, no drunken behaviour escapes his sharp tongue. He has never been one for the comfortable life, the easy fix, the day job, the tv talk show noddy drip feed, the comfort zone or the chasing of accolades.\n\nRichard Clapton began his recording career in 1974. Australia was still in the vice-like grip of the cultural cringe. He plunged into the “deep water” and legends like Skyhooks and Paul Kelly, Cold Chisel, INXS, Midnight Oil, and hundreds of others, followed in his wake.\n\nClapton’s songs are still omnipresent on the radio to this day, his records charting the political landscape of the nation and the turbulent lives of two generations.\n\nClapton grew up in Sydney in the 1960s before hopping a plane for London, and then later to Germany, where he wrote a first album, Prussian Blue (1973) which was one of the first major Australian “singer-songwriter” albums.\n\nFast track to 1975, Clapton had the critics on side but his label at the time, Festival Records, insisted on a hit single. However, it was the song they picked as a B-side called “Girls On the Avenue” that reached #1 on the national charts and put Clapton at the top of his class. Like Americans Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen, Richard Clapton developed a sound based on melodic rock while his lyrics were poetic musings on his state of mind or the state of the nation.\n\nIn 1980 he released the searing Dark Spaces, an indictment on the meanness and mendacity that would blow through the 1980s. Ten years after his first release, Richard Clapton was a tribal elder to whom younger artists like Jimmy Barnes, INXS and Cold Chisel turned as a mentor.\n\nINXS asked Clapton to produce their second album, Underneath the Colours, and they became firm friends. They, and Cold Chisel, returned the favour on Clapton’s The Great Escape album with INXS drummer Jon Farriss going on to produce The Glory Road album. Few records of that time captured the roller coaster ride of the late 1980s as well as Glory Road.\n\nThese albums brought Clapton’s melodic gifts and his love of electric rock & roll into lockstep.\n\nIn the 1990s Richard continued to write and record and tour and his 1990s songs reflect a hard-won maturity. Indeed, Richard counts 2003’s Diamond Mine as amongst his best albums – and the critics unanimously agreed.\n\nIn 1999 Richard Clapton was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2014, his first memoir “The Best Years of Our Lives” was published by Allen and Unwin. The book connected with people of all generations because it was not only a story of Clapton’s journey, but it also documented the story of the lives of thousands of fans who had travelled the same road. Young people – fascinated by how it was “back in the day” also became a new generation of fans. The book continues to flourish through “word of mouth”, resonating with so many people in so many ways\n\nRichard Clapton has never been rich. He has never had the pleasure of passing through life in a luxurious rock star bubble. In a career that now spans over 40 years he has battled everything from bad managers and capricious record companies to debt, taxes, personal tragedy and a thousand room service dinners. The fact that he’s come through it all with his sanity intact surprises all who know and love him.\n\nDavid Sean Gleeson, (born 3 June 1968) is the lead singer of Australian hard rock group The Screaming Jets. He was born in Newcastle, New South Wales . . Gleeson formed his first rock band, Aspect, in 1985, with school pal, Grant Walmsley.\n\nIn January 1989 Gleeson on lead vocals and Walmsley on guitar, were joined by Brad Heaney on drums, Richard Lara on guitar and Paul Woseen on bass guitar, to form The Screaming Jets as a hard rock band in Newcastle. Within twelve months they had performed more than 280 live shows, they established a reputation for being one of the best young live bands in Australia, winning the praises and support slots of The Angels, The Choirboys and The Radiators.\n\nBy late 1989, The Screaming Jets had won youth radio station Triple J's National Band Competition. They signed a recording deal with the leading independent label rooArt. The Screaming Jets moved from their hometown Newcastle to Sydney's notorious Kings Cross district in early 1990, and recorded their debut album All For One in mostly midnight to dawn sessions at a local studio, after playing live shows seven nights a week.\n\nIn 2006, Gleeson appeared as the vocal coach for actress Kate Fischer in the televised celebrity singing competition It Takes Two. He returned to the show in 2007 and partnered with TV presenter, Julia Zemiro.\n\nIn early 2011 Gleeson was offered a radio show with the Triple M network. By mid-year he was hosting two shows, Access All Areas and Rock of Ages, interviewing artists including Jimmy Barnes and Don McLean, and giving an inside view of the music industry. Late that year Gleeson recorded an album, Take It to the Streets (31 August 2012), with his childhood idols, The Angels, as their new lead singer, and they completed a national tour.\n\nOn 19 June 2016 at the Governor Hindmarsh - Adelaide, Dave Gleeson was inducted into The South Australian Music Hall Of Fame, alongside The Angels.\n\nOn 31 January 2022 he returned to Australian rock radio station Triple M filling the 7-10pm nightly slot with his new show Triple M nights with Dave Gleeson broadcasting across Australia from Triple M Adelaide studio."
