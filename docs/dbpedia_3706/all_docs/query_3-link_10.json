        "text": "It’s not every day that you get to premiere a music video that consists of images recovered from a 21-year-old VHS tape. But we are happy to share Massachusetts post-hardcore/emo outfit Orange Island’s take on the timeless 60's classic, ‘Crimson And Clover’. The cover is included as a bonus song on the band’s recently re-released debut ‘The Shape Of Calling,’ which has been fully remastered by Jack Shirley for its 20-year anniversary. It is out now on Iodine Recordings, the recently resurrected label that also originally released the album back in 2001.\n\nOrange Island were once a household name in the scene after numerous US tours and releases on Iodine, Triple Crown Records, and Rise Records. While never fitting neatly into a box when it came to genres, Orange Island brought influences from post-hardcore, emo, and punk, while maintaining a unique sound that was well ahead of its time. Shape of Calling is an upbeat album full of sing-along anthems, but the lyrics focus on loss, regret, and struggling with alcoholism in a small depressed suburban mill town. Produced by Michael Poorman of Hot Rod Circuit.\n\nAnd the good news keeps coming because influential label Iodine Recordings, which launched back in 1996 by distributing punk and hardcore records from a cramped apartment in Boston during the golden age of mail-order and print catalogs, is back.\n\nThe label has been rebooted by founder Casey Iodine. In addition to reissues of signature titles by Orange Island, Jeromes Dream and There Were Wires, the label will once again serve as a home for new artists. New signings include Audio Karate, Onelinedrawing, The Darling Fire, Ritual Earth, and more to come."
