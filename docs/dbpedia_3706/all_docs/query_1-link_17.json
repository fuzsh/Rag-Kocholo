        "text": "Hot Rod Circuit's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Hot Rod Circuit for your party. As long as your funding is commensurate with the price range to book Hot Rod Circuit, CTI will propose your event to the official agency representing Hot Rod Circuit. After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.\n\nCTI can give you the accurate Hot Rod Circuit booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. \"How much does it cost to book Hot Rod Circuit for an event?\" is a frequent question we get. The final Hot Rod Circuit booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Hot Rod Circuit charge for an event. An example fee to book Hot Rod Circuit is in the starting range of $2,500-$7,499. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement."
