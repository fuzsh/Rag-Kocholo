        "text": "This album consists of older stuff that is out of print, hence the witty album name. I'm a fan of \"Very Best Friend\", the first song; it has a nice pop rock feel. But after that it is like coming down after smoking a fatty bowl, or bowel if you don't know how to spell. The rest of the album is very average with a lack of fun provided like that first track. Save your twelve dollars for some foliage, and when smoked, it will provide more fun than the four and a half minutes provided by this sinker.\n\n4.0 / 10 — Zed\n\nWell this record does win something. Worst album cover and album name of the year thus far. I didn't like their first ep the first time I heard it so it did nothing for me on this cd. Nothing else on the cd compares to anything that they have done lately. The cover songs don't help this cd any either. Pick up one of their cds with a better album cover.\n\n4.0 / 10 — Shane\n\nI didn't hate this album, that's about all I can say for it. Nothing on this CD stood out in my mind at all, it all seemed pretty bland and boring. If you're a HUGE fan of Hot Rod Circuit's post-emo indie/pop sound they have going, you might want to check this out, I wouldn't go out of my way to do so if I were you. The songs are better than most of the \"emo\" coming out these days, but I don't think Hot Rod Circuit really needed to rerelease any of this stuff, all of it is beyond subpar for them. They should be locking away the original recordings in a vault and burying it deep in some tundra, not putting it out for all us poor souls to here. I must say, they did make one smart decision. Using that horrible artwork for the album cover certainly DOES make the CD sound a bit better in contrast.\n\n5.0 / 10 — Sean"
