Half of the tracks is just dudes going “boing boing boing” on a mouth harp and then the other half is chirruping bamboo flutes. It’s seriously something else. Anyone interested in hearing something they’ve never heard before must cop\n\n*The Tubs – Dead Meat (Trouble…) – “ex Joanna Gruesome” always makes the year end list\n\n*Laurel Halo – Atlas (Awe) – i think i would call this “Ambient Plus”\n\n*Ratboys – The Window (Topshelf) – “The Gang Makes An Album With Chris Walla”\n\n*Various – Canto A Lo Divino (Mississippi) – gorgeous billion string guitar music. Probably all about Jesus but guess what so are Sufjan Stevens albums\n\n*Asher White – New Excellent Woman (Ba Da Bing) – kind of elephant six-y textures married to really rich harmonies and lyrics\n\n*Yo La Tengo – This Stupid World – Gods favorite band\n\nCurling – No Guitar – this band is sick as hell\n\n*Hydroplane – Selected Songs 1997-2003 (World Of Echo) – great retrospective from ex-Cat’s Miaow members thats somewhere between clasico indie pop and trip-hop.Thank you World of Echo, very cool!\n\n*Erik Hall – Canto Ostinato (Western Vinyl) – this piece by Simeon Ten Holt has been recorded 1,0000 times but this version really takes it all the way into “library-based period drama soundtrack” territory\n\nFrog – GROG – Frog’s back\n\n→ Special award for great albums by local bands\n\nYou Are The Garden – Six Leaf Clover\n\nPrathloons – Live Loons: The Bronze 8.4.23\n\n*Ok Cool – Fawn – ive never felt older than when i saw this band live and they covered “A-Punk”\n\nModel Living – Alignment\n\nDoom Flower – Limestone Ritual (Record Label)\n\nHalf Gringa – Ancestral Home\n\n*Tom Musick – The Many Moods of… – see you at Weegees\n\n→ Here are albums i liked in theory and listened to a couple times and now theyre on this list:\n\n// “normal person” category\n\n*Subsonic Eye – All Around You (Topshelf, natürlich) – what’s going on in Singapore??\n\n*@ – Mind Palace Music (Carpark) – new innovations in ungoogleability\n\n*En Attendant Ana – Principia (Trouble in Mind)\n\n*Black Country New Road – Live at Bush Hall (Ninja Tune) – i will NOT put the comma in this band name. do not ever ask me to do that\n\n*L’Rain – I Killed Your Dog (Mexican Summer)\n\n*Julie Byrne – The Greater Wings (Ghostly)\n\n// “record store employee” category\n\n*Masahiro Takahashi – Humid Sun (Telephone Explosion)\n\n*Martinou – Chiral (Nousklaer) – fell off the dance music train in 2023. I will do better next year\n\n*American Analog Set – For Forever (Darla) – strips away the gauzy production & showcases the evil side of what many people are calling “Death Cab for people still renting in their 30s”\n\n*Mike Cooper – Life & Death in Paradise (Reissue)\n\n*Drop Nineteens – Hard Light (Wharf Cat)\n\n*Beau Wanzer + Champagne Mirrors – Gub (Sophomore Lounge)\n\n________\n\n________\n\n<< ZACH WAGENFUEHR >>\n\n(Belmont)\n\nIf I Promise – On Departure (self-released)\n\nModel/Actriz – Dogsbody (True Panther)\n\nCicada – Seeking the Sources of Streams (flau)\n\nTim Hecker – No Highs (Kranky)\n\nParannoul – After the Magic (Topshelf)\n\nLia Kohl – The Ceiling Reposes (American Dreams)\n\nMu tate – They’re With You Always (3XL)\n\nYo La Tengo – This Stupid World (Matador)\n\nThe Necks – Travel (Northern Spy)\n\nFlooding – Silhouette Machine (Ghost Is Clear)\n\nPurelink – Signs (Peak Oil)\n\nInfant – Sigla, Sone (Warm Winters)\n\nWednesday – Rat Saw God (Dead Oceans)\n\nEuclid C Finder – The Mirror, My Weapon, I Love You (Dark Trail)\n\nBilly Woods & Kenny Segal – Maps (Backwoodz)\n\nRolin/ Pulice/ Powers – Prism (Cached)\n\nDiles Que No Me Maten – Obrigaggi (Come Algo)\n\nSundae Painters – Sundae Painters (Leather Jacket)\n\nHashirat – A Place To Myself (self-released)\n\nAsha Sheshadri – Whiplash (Recital)\n\nBar Italia – Tracey Denim (Matador)\n\nSprain – The Lamb as Effigy (The Flenser)\n\nErik Hall/ Simeon ten Holt – Canto Ostinato (Western Vinyl)\n\nGreat Falls – Objects Without Pain (Neurot)\n\nArooj Aftab, Vijay Iyer, & Shahzad Ismaily – Love in Exile (Verve)\n\nGridlink – Coronet Jupiter (Willowtip)\n\nOnewaymirror – Onewaymirror (Zegema Beach)\n\nApproaching Mountains – Ley (self-released)\n\nherlovebeheadsdaisies – carving initials (self-released)\n\nFeeble Little Horse – Girl With Fish (Saddle Creek)\n\nHysterical Love Project – Lashes (Motion Ward)\n\niANO – What Will We See (Dismiss Yourself)\n\nGia Margaret – Romantic Piano (Jagjaguwar)\n\nOldstar – On the Run (Rope Bridge)\n\nMartyna Basta – Slowly Forgetting, Barely Remembering (Warm Winters)\n\nZorn – Zorn (Furo Bungy)\n\nEx Pilots – Ex Pilots (Smoking Room)\n\nVoice Actor – Fake Sleep (Stroom)\n\nArthur Russell – Picture of Bunny Rabbit (Audika) *archival\n\n7038634357 – Neo Seven (Blank Forms)\n\nOld Saw – Sewn the Name (Lobby Art)\n\nRaphael Roginski – Talan (Instant Classic)\n\nThe Motifs – I’m the Only One You Love… (Daisart) *archival\n\nGigi Masin/ Rod Modell – Red Hair Girl at Lighthouse Beach (13)\n\nKitchen – Breath Too Long (okwhatever)\n\nMasahiro Takahashi – Humid Sun (Telephone Explosion)\n\nAlice Phoebe Lou – Shelter (self-released)\n\nwhat is your name? – My Name Is… (5am)\n\n________\n\n<< ANDREW MIN >>\n\n(Loop)\n\n-replacements – tim (let it bleed edition)\n\n–yeah not a new lp but hearing this incredible new mix from ed stasium, it might as well be.\n\n-yeule – softscars\n\n–such well crafted, intricately produced and personal music. As catchy as it is great headphone music.\n\n-a.s.o – a.s.o.\n\n–if u dig on trip-hop, u dig on this new duo out of berlin.\n\n-hotline tnt – cartwheel\n\n–sick guitar driven lp out on third man records. like blown out teenage fanclub. sugary melodies/scuzzed out production.\n\n-caroline polachek – desire, i want to turn into you\n\n–scratches my frou frou/imogen heap pop itch. probably the best vocalist in the game.\n\n-bully – lucky for you\n\n–her 4th lp might be her best yet. emotional and sooo hooky. the kind of record that makes u immediately check for tour dates.\n\n-pinkpantheress – heaven knows\n\n–great debut of bedroom dnb pop tunes. simultaneously feels nostalgic and like the future.\n\n-grian chattan – chaos for the fly\n\n–poetic and intimate solo offering from fontaines dc frontman. engaging on a totally different level but just as excellent.\n\n-anohni & the johnsons – my back was a bridge for you to cross\n\n–i feel this is her most accessible and moving lp yet which i think is saying a lot! as haunting as it is uplifting.\n\n-vyva melinkolya – unbecoming\n\n–best shoegaze release of the year, all enveloping, comforting and heavy.\n\n________\n\n<< STEVEN RAHMAN >>\n\n(Loop)\n\nIn 2023 I found these things worth discussing or recommending to other peoples:\n\n–Don’t miss the opening/ support acts. I finally got to see the Smoking Popes featuring one former co-worker (Hi Eli!), & a few bands I hadn’t really heard before, including Teenage Halloween (from New Jersey), who absolutely killed during their set, so much so, I went & bought a shirt. If you like power-pop like Pup, but with a little more Punk influence, you’ll love Teen Ween’s 2023 record Til You Return.\n\n–The best beat boxer I’ve ever seen live plays bass for Phum Viphurit. This is probably hyperbole, I’ve seen both Doug E. Fresh & Rahzel, but during Phum’s set at the House of Blues this unassuming but awesome bassist took center stage while Phum & the rest of the band took a break. Pom Tanapon picked up a mic & for 4 or 5 minutes the whole crowd sat transfixed as we saw the worldwide appeal of hip-hop music. It was such a cool little scene, a massive departure from the band’s normal psychedelic, summery, soul-adjacent guitar music, which you can hear on the record Viphurit dropped earlier this year on The Greng Jai Piece.\n\n–50 years in Hip Hop keeps growing & expanding. Some of the best rapping I heard all year came fromwomen. Big Boss Vette on Resilience, KenTheMan on Back to 304’n, Chika on Samson, & Flyana Boss on Hello Christ…; all of these sets have incredible performances on the mic. We also got some great “grown man raps” from acts that I really love to hear from: Black Milk dropped Everybody Good, Black Thought teamed up with El Michels Affair for Glorious Game, Oddisee gave us To What End, & Open Mike Eagle’s another triumph… all took approaches that we don’t always get to see in hip hop. We also got some excellent documentation, May the Lord Watch from Rap Portraits & What Had Happened Was season 4 from Stony Island Audio.\n\n–This was a pretty good year for R&B & Soul music. I went looking for good R&B this year, & boy howdy did I find it. Victoria Monet with Jaguar II, Jordan Ward with Forward, & Leon Thomas with Electric Dusk. And those are just the 3 I liked best. Each has a different vibe, each has a different approach, but they make you want to move, to feel & sing along.\n\n– We were due for a ska revival & I think it’s here! I for one welcome this development. It’s a good time for Bad Times Records who put a tour on with Kill Lincoln, We Are the Union, Catbite, & J. Navarro & the Traitors this year & also released Flying Racoon Suit Moonflower. We also got an ep from Fishbone, & a ripper of a record from ska-adjacent Jeff Rosenstock with Hellmode. There’s a lot of DIY pop music happening out there right now & I’m glad people are still making fun music for fun’s sake.\n\nI’m sure I missed something, but that’s what I remember from this year… Cheers!\n\n________\n\n________\n\n<< DYLAN SOWLE >>\n\n(Belmont)\n\nHole Dweller – “Crossroads” (Dungeons Deep)\n\nDeath’s Dynamic Shroud – “After Angel” (Ghost Diamond)\n\nParannoul – “After The Magic” (Topshelf)\n\nOneohtrix Point Never – “Again” (Warp)\n\nBell Witch – “Future’s Shadow Part 1: The Clandestine Gate” (Profound Lore)\n\nFucked Up – “One Day” (Merge)\n\nAsian Glow & Sonhos Tomam Conta – “Dreamglow” (Longinus Recordings)\n\nOozing Wound – “We Cater To Cowards” (Thrill Jockey)\n\nEn Attendant Ana – “Principia” (Trouble In Mind)\n\nSadness & Abriction – “Sadness // Abriction” (Canti Erectici Productions)\n\nSquid – “O Monolith” (Warp)\n\nTime Is Away [Various Artists] – “Searchlight Moonbeam” (Efficient Space)\n\nQuest Master – “Sword & Circuitry” (Out Of Season)\n\nCaroline Polachek – “Desire, I Want To Turn Into You” (Perpetual Novice)\n\nSufjan Stevens – “Javelin” (Asthmatic Kitty)\n\nThe Armed – “Perfect Saviors” (Sargent House)\n\nMort Garson – “Journey To The Moon & Beyond” (Sacred Bones)\n\nRatboys – “The Window” (Topshelf)\n\nTim Hecker – “No Highs” (Kranky)\n\nHonorable Mention: Miserable People – “Miserable EP” (Rat’s Pizza) [This is my band’s tape and I’m using my year-end list to advertise it to you, dear reader.

Thankfully there was a ton of great music to help us make our way through it. Hoping for brighter days ahead for us all…\n\nSHASTA GILMORE\n\nHere are some new releases, new reissues, and just things I picked up this year that I really loved\n\nShintaro Sakamoto – The Feeling Of Love\n\nStrum and Thrum: The American Jangle Underground\n\nAlan Vega – After Dark\n\nThe Clean – Boodle Boodle Boodle\n\nThe Cure – Disintegration\n\nGoblin – Suspiria OST\n\nCurtis Mayfield – Curtis (expanded edition)\n\nScreamers – Demo Hollywood 1977\n\nThe Sound – Jeopardy\n\nSuburban Lawns – S/T\n\nPHILIP CERZA\n\nMy favorite albums of 2021 are Sweep It Into Space by Dinosaur Jr and Superwolves by Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Matt Sweeney. Here are some other projects and records from this past year I loved:\n\nAdmonitions // Endless Boogie\n\nAfrique Victime // Mdou Moctar\n\nComfort To Me // Amyl & The Sniffers\n\nHappier Than Ever // Billie Eilish\n\nHaram // Armand Hammer & The Alchemist\n\nHarmonizer // Ty Segall\n\nHey What // Low\n\nIf I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power // Halsey\n\nJubilee // Japanese Breakfast\n\nLike A Stone // Remember Sports\n\nMa Délire // Myriam Gendron\n\nMcCartney III // Paul McCartney\n\nNew Long Leg // Dry Cleaning\n\nNo Medium // Rosali\n\nPath of Wellness // Sleater-Kinney\n\nPick A Day To Die // Sunburned Hand of the Man\n\nPressure Machine // The Killers\n\nShadow I Remember // Cloud Nothings\n\nSound Ancestors // Madlib\n\nStar-Crossed // Kacey Musgraves\n\nThings Take Time, Take Time // Courtney Barnett\n\nTwo Saviors // Buck Meek\n\nEl Último Tour Del Mundo // Bad Bunny\n\nUltrapop // The Armed\n\nUrban Driftwood // Yasmin Williams\n\n“Stoned At The Nail Salon” // Lorde\n\n“Soul Love” // Jeff & Ruby Parker\n\n“Like I Used To” // Sharon Van Etten & Angel Olsen\n\n“All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” // Taylor Swift\n\nJAMIE DRIER\n\nThe Bug – Fire (Ninja Tune)\n\nMax Richter – Voices 2 (Decca)\n\nPan Daijing – Jade (Pan)\n\nLoraine James – Reflection (Hyperdub)\n\nTirzah – Colourgrade (Domino)\n\nCharles – Let’s Start A Family Tonight (Babe City Records)\n\nTeste – Graphic Depictions (L.I.E.S.)\n\nPloy – Unlit Signals (L.I.E.S.)\n\nJeff Parker – JP’s Myspace Beats (International Anthem)\n\nHiro Kone – Silvercoat The Throng (Dais)\n\nSpace Afrika – Honest Labour (Dais)\n\nAaron Dilloway & Lucrecia Dalt – Lucy & Aaron (Hanson)\n\nChynna – Drug Opera (Twin)\n\nVarious Artists – Paura (A Collection of Italian Horror Sounds\n\nFrom The Cam Sugar Archive) (Decca / Cam Sugar)\n\nSTEVE RAHMAN\n\nThis year was thoroughly exhausting. These are the records that I think most helped me through the longest of the days.\n\nLA Exes “Get Some”\n\nI love things that can contain a multitude of emotions in a single space & “Get Some” does that better than most records. It’s a sobering record sometimes, full of upbeat, sunshine-y pop tunes that often as not are about heart-break; Not in a depressing oh-my-gosh-it’s-all-terrible-and-I-wanna-die way, but in a more subtle “I wouldn’t mind disappearing for a while, a Temporary Goodbye” kinda way. In fact, one of my favorite things about this record is the humor with which they tackle the subject matter, even the stuff that really might make you sad if you think about it too hard.\n\nMelanie Charles “Y’all Don’t (Really) Care About Black Women”\n\nMelanie Charles as a musician & producer is at times incredibly challenging for me. On this Verve Remixed project, each song is originally performed by another great woman in jazz & soul, but Charles takes them in incredibly diverse directions. The way that Charles manipulates & interpolates the original tracks is creative & adventurous, & I haven’t even mentioned the beautiful way she uses her voice. This record exemplifies fearlessness.\n\nSkyzoo “All the Brilliant Things”\n\nIf what you want from your Rap music is very good rapping & very good beats, it’s difficult to overlook Skyzoo. Prolific & brilliant, there aren’t many pens in the world that can match Sky’s & the layered entendres that populate the whole of “All the Brilliant Things” require listen upon listen. The thing is, what you get with Skyzoo is consistency. Each track will be well crafted, with impeccable lyrical delivery & beats that knock. This is dope beats, dope rhymes… what more could y’all want.\n\nSilk Sonic “An Evening with Silk Sonic”\n\nI don’t know how to talk about this record without hyperbole. I don’t know what hasn’t been said about it since it came out. I don’t even know where to begin with this partnership between Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars. All I can say is it’s a throwback R&B record with smooth, clean, crystal clear production. It’s pure ear-candy. It sounds great & it feels great. I know there’s a lot of criticism to be had about originality or lack there-of, but baby… who cares!? This record is groovy as hell & sometimes that’s all that matters.\n\nA couple more from this year:\n\nWe Are the Union “Ordinary Life”\n\nRosemarie “Sinnergy”\n\nMac Ayres “Magic 8Ball”\n\nBeach Bunny “Blame Game EP”\n\nCJ Fly “The Way I (H)ear It Vol. 1”\n\nArlo Parks “Collapsed in Sunbeams”\n\nAdrian Younge “The American Negro”\n\nSam Dew “Moonlit Fools”\n\nChika “Once Upon a Time EP”\n\nKota the Friend & Statik Selektah “To Kill A Sunrise”\n\nOlivia Rodrigo “Sour”\n\nTyler the Creator “Call Me If You Get Lost”\n\nLeon Bridges “Gold-Diggers Sound”\n\nMeet Me @ the Altar “Model Citizen EP”\n\nLittle Simz “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert”\n\nKacey Musgraves “Star-Crossed”\n\nTasha “Tell Me What You Miss the Most”\n\nMen I Trust “Untourable Album”\n\nDYLAN SOWLE\n\nBEST OF 2021\n\nBest Albums:\n\n1. Parannoul – “To See The Next Part Of The Dream” (Longinus Recordings)\n\nSouth Korean shoegaze/emo hybrid, all made by one dude using digital instruments, yet sounds as full and lush as if a full band had been present in the studio. Will make you nostalgic for experiences you’ve never had, and places you’ve never been. Unfortunately this has only received very limited pressings, as the label it’s on is run out of a dorm room where I went to college. Without a doubt the greatest thing I’ve heard all year.\n\n2. The Killers – “Pressure Machine” (Island)\n\nThe Killers were my all time favorite band in middle school and high school, but every album after Day & Age has sounded like increasingly bloated arena rock. The turnaround on this record completely took me by surprise, even if it’s just complete Springsteen worship. Feels like a return to Sam’s Town, and an album where they finally take their foot off the pedal and allow their songwriting to breathe. Beautiful American music.\n\n3. Richard Dawson & Circle – “Henki” (Domino)\n\nI only just listened to this record, so it almost seems unfair to list it this high, but I can’t stop thinking about it. I really have no history with either Richard Dawson or Circle, so this came out of left field for me and I’m not sure how to talk about it yet?? It feels epic, ancient, psychedelic, and weaving a wild tale for you to chase after. I can’t wait to listen to this over and over again.\n\nA Bunch Of Other Really Great Albums:\n\nGaldre Visions – “Galdre Visions” (Leaving Records)\n\nFreak Genes – “Power Station” (Feel It Records)\n\nLuca Yupanqui – “Sounds of the Unborn” (Sacred Bones)\n\nDry Cleaning – “New Long Leg” (4AD)\n\nJeff Rosenstock – “Ska Dream” (Polyvinyl/ Quote Unquote Records)\n\nSquid – “Bright Green Field” (Warp)\n\nChai – “Wink” (Sub Pop)\n\nSnow Ellet – “Suburban Indie Rockstar” (Self Released)\n\nBo Burnham – “Inside (The Songs)” (Imperial Distribution)\n\nIron Maiden – “Senjutsu” (Parlophone)\n\nGuided By Voices – “Styles We Paid For” (Guided By Voices, Inc.)\n\nThe Armed – “Ultrapop” (Sargent House)\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – “Sour” (Geffen)\n\nSilicone Prairie – “My Life On The Silicone Prairie” (Feel It Records)\n\nFire-Toolz – “Eternal Home” (Hausu Mountain)\n\nNatalie Bergman – “Mercy” (Third Man)\n\nAnika – “Change” (Sacred Bones)\n\nTorres – “Thirstier” (Merge)\n\nMarissa Nadler – “The Path of the Clouds” (Sacred Bones)\n\nNick Cave & Warren Ellis – “Carnage” (Goliath)\n\nSilk Sonic – “An Evening With Silk Sonic” (Aftermath Entertainment)\n\nOrwell – “Orwell 1995” (Expert Work Records)\n\nABBA – “Voyage” (Polar)\n\nAndrew W.K. – “God Is Partying” (Napalm Records)\n\nBest Compilations:\n\nVarious Artists – “Heisei No Oto: Japanese Left-Field Pop From The CD Age, 1989-1996” (Music From Memory)\n\nVarious Artists – “Somewhere Between: Mutant Pop, Electronic Minimalism & Shadow Sounds of Japan 1980-1988” (Light In The Attic)\n\nVarious Artists – “Virtual Dreams: Ambient Explorations in the House & Techno Age, 1993-1997” (Music From Memory)\n\nVarious Artists – “Numero 95” (Numero Group)\n\nVarious Artists – “The World’s Most Precious Cows” (The World’s Most Precious Cows)\n\nCheeky – “Freaky Deaky: The Cheeky Discography” (Quote Unquote Records)\n\nVarious Artists – “Intermission” (Ghost Box)\n\nParannoul/ Asian Glow/ sonhos tomam conta – “Downfall of the Neon Youth” (Longinus Recordings)\n\nTangled Shoelace – “Turn My Dial: M Squared Recordings and More, 1981-84” (Chapter Music)\n\nBest Singles & Reissues:\n\nAndrew W.K. – “Babalon” (Napalm Records) [single]\n\nA.r.t.

Even if you don’t, you should listen to her debut album if you have ever dealt with anxiety or depression.\n\n*IDLES – Crawler\n\nI would never call an IDLES album soft, but if you ever want to feel angsty but not, like, their usual full blown Bristol post-punk angsty, this is a good starting point.\n\n*Maneskin – Teatro d’ira: Vol. I\n\nThis album sounds like glitter and sweat and I wouldn’t have asked for anything else from the Italian rock band.\n\n*PinkPanthress – To Hell With It\n\nHer debut mixtape is only 20 minutes because if it was any longer it would be too powerful.

I gained nothing by this experience, and furthermore it liquefied my brain.\n\n10 LPs/activities I enjoyed, available at reckless:\n\n-katy kirby / cool dry place (keeled scales) — arbitrary AOTY pick\n\n-the ophelias / crocus (joyful noise) —the kind of record where you hear the sound of an ambulance going by in the vocal mic. perfect median between 2021-style confessional songwriting + Yo La Tengo in their chamber pop mode. someday this will soundtrack a Bloomsday-style tour of Cincinnati where I rank the public libraries by “vibe” and point out various places I was hit by cars\n\n-raiding the New Age CD section — great gift idea for the broke: these bad boys start at only $3.99! if you must have it on wax check out Numero’s excellent Numero 95 comp (Numero). either way this is the year to give that special himbo/thembo in your life the gift that keeps on giving: New Age Music\n\n-japanese breakfast / jubilee (dead oceans) — I saw this band live and they sounded exactly like Wilco to me. Or maybe I’d just had a few too many NEW ENGLAND STYLE IPAS????\n\n-wobbly / popular monitress (hausu mountain) — let’s say somehow ontological boundaries became blurred and you accidentally inhaled a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) through your nose and then looked for a tissue to try and blow it out but you don’t have any tissues because you’re a logan square band guy; but then suddenly not only can you not find a tissue but now your house is a scratched up copy of NBA 2K. Karl Malone is executing a mid-range jump shot into your kitchen sink. What are you going to do about it? this album gave me havana syndrome\n\nmoontype / bodies of water (born yesterday) —straight down the lane, we love to see it, Chicago excellence, whenever spin this I do a 2-handed Italian chef kiss. sometimes I’m on my bike and it’s very dangerous to do the chef kiss but I do it anyway\n\n-marc riordan / life systems (sophomore lounge) —soothing and ominous, urban but also dreamily pastoral. deep breath and a can of soda\n\n-ryley walker / course in fable (husky pants) — the year is 2035. Everything from the book “Station Eleven” has happened. Phish is cool again. your friends are trading Phish bootlegs, from the crappy years, like 2003. a copy of “Close to the Edge” on CD costs $4,000. an elite mod on forums.stevehoffman.tv has heard there’s a VG+ original copy of “In the Court of the Crimson King” buried under the ruins of Michigan Central Station in Detroit. a confidential buyer (possibly Elon Musk) has offered to pay two billion dollars for it, in specie. you’ll have to fight your way there and back through Indiana—burning scrub brush, far as the eye can see; trigger-happy militia patrols; packs of stray dogs. you’ll have to subsist on saltine crackers and pedialyte. you’ll have to fire a harpoon gun, multiple times. The task is herculean. They say it cannot be done. but many years ago, you took a stranger’s recommendation, and you listened to “Course in Fable”. and now you are ready to do what must be done\n\nblack midi live @ Sleeping Village 9/13/2021 — telling people I was in “in the pit” at this show because a tall person stepped on my foot and caused me to spill my New England Style IPA. the LP is great too\n\n-another michael / new music + big pop (run for cover) — a handful of dynamo singles are the main attraction but the album cuts grow on you; good to see that Philly is still in the ring. go sixers\n\n-fav label of ‘21 / Orindal, who put out great records by wednesday, macie stewart, karima walker, dan wriggins, etc.\n\n-fav beer / New England Style IPA\n\n———also liked by me, and stocked here———\n\nrecords by: Adult Mom — Bad Bad Hats — Boo Hiss — Charles — DJ Black Low — Dummy — Hand Habits — Lande Hekt — Lael Neale — Carlos Niño — Spellling — Pauline Anna Strom\n\n———bandcamp-only releases———\n\npersonal space / a lifetime of leisure — patricia brennan / maquishti — subtitles / commoner — chaos in the cbd / te puke thunder EP — fievel is glauque / god’s trashmen sent to right the mess, &c. — SLONK / where do you see yourself in five years? — ki oni / stay indoors and swim + indoor plant life — wombo / keesh mountain\n\nMATT JENCIK\n\nThe Body & Big Brave Leaving None But Small Birds\n\nCan Live in Brighton 1975\n\nCan Live in Stuttgart 1975\n\nCerebral Rot Excretion of Mortality\n\nLucinda Chua Antidotes\n\nCircuit Des Yeux -io\n\nColdreams Crazy Night\n\nAlice Coltrane Kirtan: Turiya Sings\n\nJohn Coltrane A Love Supreme Live in Seattle\n\nCrypta Echoes of the Soul\n\nSarah Davachi Antiphonals\n\nKenny Dorham Quiet Kenny reissue\n\nDramarama Cinema Verite reissue\n\nDream Unending Tide Turns Eternal\n\nFACS Present Tense\n\nRoger Fakhr Fine Anyway\n\nFloating Points & Pharoah Sanders w/ The London Symphony Orchestra Promises\n\nMyriam Gendron Ma Delire: Songs of Love Lost & Found\n\nGrouper Shade\n\nHollie Kenniff The Quiet Drift\n\nLamp of Murmuur Submission & Slavery\n\nKedr Livanskiy Liminal Soul\n\nDamon Locks Black Monument Ensemble Now\n\nMare Cognitum Solar Paroxysm\n\nJames McAlister Scissortail\n\nMia Joy Spirit Tamer\n\nMistreater Hell’s Fire\n\nLee Morgan Rajah: Blue Note Tone Poet Series\n\nNatural Information Society w/ Evan Parker Descension\n\nJeff Parker Forfolks\n\nQrixkuor Poison Palinopsia\n\nClara Rockmore Lost Theremin Album\n\nClaire Rousay Softer Focus\n\nElori Saxl The Blue of Distance\n\nSeam Headsparks reissue\n\nSeth La Morsure du Christ\n\nThe Silver Ward of Roses\n\nLinda Smith Till Another Time 1988-1996\n\nStephen Radar of Small Dogs reissue\n\nStormkeep Tales of Other Time\n\nAndy Stott Never the Right Time\n\nTangerine Dream The Keep (Soundtrack) reissue\n\nTribulation Where The Gloom Becomes Sound\n\nVoivod Outer Limits reissue\n\nYasmin Williams Urban Driftwood\n\nVarious Artists Heisei No Oto: Japanese Left-Field Pop From the CD Age 1989-1996\n\nVarious Artists Somewhere Between: Mutant Pop, Electronic Minimalism & Shadow Sounds\n\nNeil Young Carnegie Hall 1970\n\nNeil Young Young Shakespeare\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse Way Down in the Rust Bucket\n\nFAVORITE USED LP SCORES\n\nGene Ammons Jungle Soul\n\nFrancoise Hardy If You Listen\n\nQuincy Jones Deadly Affair (Soundtrack)\n\nOliver Nelson Skull Session\n\nPopol Vuh Aguirre\n\nRoedelius Jardin Au Fou\n\nSteve Tibbetts Northern Song\n\nLEA BOARD\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nThe Armed “Ultra Pop”\n\nDoja Cat “Planet Her”\n\nPixel Grip “Arena”\n\nTurnstile “Glow On”\n\nLil Nas X “Montero”\n\nShame “Drunk Tank Pink”\n\nDry Cleaning “New Long Leg”\n\nSpirit of the Beehive “Entertainment, Death”\n\nFlying Lotus “Yasuke”\n\nMannequin Pussy “Perfect EP”\n\nOlivia Rodrigo “Sour”\n\nTorres “Thirstier”\n\nKELSO ANTOINE\n\n(in no particular order)\n\n1.

These reissues sound great and offer great value and should offer example of how reissues should look and sound.\n\nI’d also like to formally thank my friends, coworkers and the internet for constantly providing me with music. If it weren’t for you all, I would still be at home listening to CCR, more than I still do. Also, sincere gratitude to every one of our customers that continues to support our stores, this industry and our livelihoods.\n\nEternal shout outs: song writers, music makers, sound generators, home recordists, noise enthusiasts, gear geeks, two channel audio, electronics designers & engineers, global supply chains, Taylor Swift for still printing CDs, scented garbage bags full of wet DVDs, all the middle aged dudes, mental illness, everyone that’s ever worked retail or food service, YOUTUBE/discogs/Spotify, theQuietus, every record store ever and the people that go there, brick & mortar hi-fi shops, the US Postal Service, delivery drivers, digital chess, return policies, usb cables and every dog i’ve ever loved. RIP my attention span\n\nJohn Massey\n\n—10 things I liked from Reckless:\n\nLomelda / Hannah (Double Double Whammy) — my favorite album of 2020 sounds pleasant enough at first and then you get drawn into its urgent and oblique world: talking in circles, running up against the edges of life, like a poem or a math problem, or maybe she’s just writing about hanging out with your friends in a parking lot, I can’t really always tell, but anyway it’s a killer record\n\nKatie Dey / mydata (Run For Cover) — the first good album ever made about going online succeeds partly because of schubert-level songcraft and partly because it sounds cool as hell. The 2020s will be the decade of MIDI strings and you can take that to the bank. Public criers beware: save this one for your room\n\nHum / Inlet (Earth Analog) — 2020 has been a banner year for loud snare drums. At first I loved this album but thought the snare drum was way too loud. Now to be honest I think it’s not loud enough\n\nShinichi Atobe / Yes (DDS) — I would love to listen to this record while standing on the moving sidewalk at a large airport\n\nBrandee Younger + Dezron Douglas / Force Majeure (International Anthem) — probably 2020’s least “ambitious” int’l anthem release gets the nod because it’s the only thing I’ve heard this year that has managed to calm me down for more than 30 seconds at a time\n\nThe Beths / Jump Rope Gazers (Carpark) — is there like a school that New Zealand bands go to? What’s going on down there?\n\nFenne Lily / Breach (Dead Oceans) — Phoebe British. Do you see what I did there\n\nEmma Ruth Rundle + Thou / May Our Chambers Be Full (Sacred Bones) — 3 things I am legally bound to respect for all time: grunge, Louisville KY, and spelling “magical” as “magickal”\n\nRatboys / Printer’s Devil (Topshelf) — E-flat Major is back baby. it’s good again. Awoouu (wolf howl)\n\nMike Hanapi / With Kalama’s Quartet (Mississippi) — there’s a lot of bad/corny pre-Renaissance Hawaiian music out there but this loving reissue is the real deal. Anyone with even a passing interest in Hawaiian music / Pacific music in general needs to buy two copies of this immediately\n\n—plus a few things i liked from bandcamp:\n\nBats / There’s a River Up High (Citrus City)\n\nMorhping (sic) / Distance Learning Suite (Strudelsoft)\n\nFennec / Free Us of This Feeling (self-released)\n\nK-Lone / Cape Cira + the Falls EP (Wisdom Teeth)\n\nDJ Python / Mas Amable (Incienso)\n\nThanya Iyer / KIND (Topshelf)\n\nMax Gowan / Last Companion (Z Tapes)\n\nOldsoul / You Were Overwhelmed (Counter Intuitive)\n\nMiserable Chillers / Audience of Summer (self-released)\n\nDylan Sowle\n\nBest Albums of 2020:\n\n1.

(Chicago Research)\n\nSatoshi & Makoto – CZ – 5000 Sounds & Sequences II (Safe Trip)\n\nOrphx – Fragmentation (Hospital Productions)\n\nSteven Rahman\n\nIn the year 2020, I found it extremely hard to keep up with things\n\nthat were released, so this is not a list of things that were\n\nnecessarily better than the other things that came out. They are just\n\nthings that I happened to be exposed to, & that helped to lighten the\n\nload…\n\nWithout Further Ado:\n\n1. Spillage Village – Spilligion\n\nI mean… what do you do when one of the most interesting collectives\n\nin Hip Hop drop a near perfect record? It’s a sermon & a service. It’s\n\nthe kind of rapping that my head longs for, but also a message that\n\nresonates in my heart without ever feeling preachy. It’s so good, I\n\nwould bet good money it’s the thing I’ve come back to most over this\n\nyear.\n\n2. Sen Morimoto – Sen Morimoto\n\nSen Morimoto’s sense of self seems to be unshakeable. He bends & flips\n\ngenres & styles but, it always sounds like Sen. I was looking forward\n\nto this record, particularly after his removal from the virtual\n\nconcerts this year, & it delivers. It’s got it’s quirks & it’s\n\nstrangenesses, but it fits together really well & I enjoy the vibe.\n\n3. Khruangbin & Leon Bridges – Texas Sun/ Khruangbin – Mordechai\n\nI love very little as much as I’ve come to love Khruangbin’s unique\n\nsound. It’s just masterful what they’re able to do with what seems\n\nlike a really minimalist approach. Then if you add Leon Bridges, who\n\nis for what little money I have one of the better writers in soul\n\nmusic today, you’ll get something that not only works, but just seems\n\nnatural.\n\n4. Open Mike Eagle – Anime, Trauma, & Divorce\n\nUnapologetic Art Rap… but with knock. I think this is the best thing\n\nI’ve ever heard from Mike & I don’t know that I would have believed\n\nthat was possible after Dark Comedy. It’s a serious record, but the\n\ncomic timing & absurdity is still there. It’s such a fun listen even\n\nwith the morbid subject matter.\n\n5. Tank & the Bangas – Friend Goals\n\nThis is probably my favorite band in the world right now. They are\n\nwhimsical & joyous, & a balm in a cold world.

Dorian Electra – My Agenda (Electronic / Futurepop) [Digitally Self-Released]\n\n-Dive into the Sea of Electra, drown in jewelry and accessories before growing digital gills that deliver oxygen to the most neglected recesses of your being. Abrasive, unapologetic, kind, loving, and inventive.\n\nFavorite track: My Agenda (ft. Village People, Pussy Riot)\n\n2. Channel Tres – i can’t go outside (Hip Hop / Detroit Techno) [Digital Release on GODMODE]\n\n-Somewhere between Hip Hop and House, Channel Tres is on a couch, in a plane, in the sky. How can something be so fire yet so chilled out?\n\nFavorite track: fuego (ft. Tyler, The Creator)\n\n3. Yin Yin – The Rabbit That Hunts Tigers (Funk / Psychedelic) [LP on Les Disques Bongo Joe]\n\n-Nose-riding a 16 foot surfboard in the lotus flower stance, meditating on the crest of a wave that never crashes. Time isn’t a straight line, it’s a fundamental element of limitless dimensions.\n\nFavorite track: One-Inch Punch\n\n4. Horse Lords – The Common Task (Krautrock / Avante-Garde) [LP on Northern Spy]\n\n-Carl Linveld said it best, “Horse Lords are like using a fidget spinner to map out a migraine aura. I mean that in the best way possible.”\n\nFavorite track: Fanfare for Effective Freedom\n\n5. Kid Cudi – Man on the Moon III: The Chosen (Hip Hop / Neo-Psych) [LP on Wicked Awesome]\n\n-Triumphantly, Scott Mescudi completes the trilogy he started 11 years ago. Cudi voyages into new territory and production while retaining all his unique idiosyncrasies that made him so likeable in the first place. This is like joyriding through your own neural pathways.\n\nFavorite Track: Lovin’ Me (ft. Phoebe Bridgers)\n\n6. CB Radio Gorgeous – EP (Punk / Hardcore) [7-inch on Thrilling Living]\n\n-Fast and frenzied, glamorous and grimey, high on energy and low on fluff, and always over too soon. The first band I would see live when shows can return.\n\nFavorite track: The Devil\n\n7. Foxy Shazam – Burn (Glam-Rock / Hard-Rock) [LP on EEEOOOAH]\n\n-If there was ever a year that needed Foxy’s comeback the most, it was this one. A true test of what it means to be uplifting, undeniable, and unstoppable. A national treasure of Smithsonian magnitude.\n\nFavorite track: Into the Wild\n\n8. Yves Tumor – Heaven to a Tortured Mind (Psych-Soul / Art-Pop) [LP on Warp]\n\n-When I was laid up in hospital with a shattered ankle and a staph infection, isolated from my people, and disoriented from 3 surgeries worth of anesthesia, it was this album that I found most comfort in. Thank you Yves.\n\nFavorite track: Gospel for a New Century\n\n9. Luke Schneider – Altar of Harmony (Ambient / Lap Steel) [LP on Third Man]\n\n-A truly beautiful, honest, meditative, and mind blowing experience from one of the most legendary lap steel guitarists of our time. This is what happens when a humble session musician finally gets the spotlight. Prepare to catch your own jaw on its way to the floor.\n\nFavorite track: somnificus\n\n10. 100 Gecs – 1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues (Hyperpop / Comp) [LP on Dog Show]\n\n-Never did I think I’d be penning a remix album on my AOTY list, but here we are. Lots of different genres, collaborators, and styles cohesively come together.\n\nFavorite track: gecgecgec (ft. Lil West, Tony Velour)\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard – K.G.\n\nOsees – Protean Threat\n\nIdles – Ultra Mono\n\nHayley Williams – Petals for Armor\n\nMachine Gun Kelly – Tickets to my Downfall\n\nRun The Jewels – RTJ4\n\nHo99o9 – Blurr\n\nDogleg – Melee\n\nThundercat – It is what it is\n\nNine Inch Nails – Ghosts V\n\nKip McCabe\n\nKip’s “some things I liked in 2020”\n\nBudos Band “Long in the Tooth”\n\nBill Callahan/Bonnie Prince Billie covers series\n\nRob Mazurek Exploding Star Orchestra “Dimensional Stardust”\n\nRun The Jewels “RTJ4”\n\nIdles “Ultra Mono”\n\nHum “Inlet”\n\nJeff Parker “Suite for Max Brown”\n\nTyler Lopez\n\nALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nPaysage D’Hiver – Im Wald [Kunsthall]\n\nOther Favorites\n\nDJ Akoza – Control Theory [Doom Shop]\n\nKjostad – Extinctionist [Chondritic Sound]\n\nBeau Wanzer – Busted & Bamboozled [Ophism] “have you ever eaten tater tots from Skylark?…”\n\nOf Feather & Bone – Sulfuric Disintegration [Profound Lore]\n\nPaysage D’hiver – Im Traum (along w/ the other 4 singles released this year.)
