        "text": "PRIVACY POLICY\n\nLast Updated: July 26, 2024\n\nTriple Crown Athletic, LLC, (“Triple Crown Athletic,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is committed to protecting both the personal as well as business information you share and/or store with us. This Privacy Policy applies to transactions and activities and data gathered through the Triple Crown Athletic Website and interaction you may have with its related Social Media accounts. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may revise it without notice.\n\nGenerally, we may collect and use personal information for many purposes, including, but not limited to: billing, product and service fulfillment, understanding customer needs, providing a better website, improving products and services, and communicating with customers and potential customers regarding our products and services with third-party products and services.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information that You Provide to Us\n\nWe do not collect personally identifiable information e.g., name, e-mail address, contact or similar information unless you choose to provide it to us. If you voluntarily provide us with personal information, for example by sending an e-mail or by filling out a form and submitting it through our Website, we may use that information only to respond to your message and to help us provide you with the information or services that you request. To the extent that we process your personal information based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time as stated below.\n\nAccount Registration Information\n\nIn some instances, use of the Triple Crown Athletic Website and Services may require that you disclose certain personal information for identification, including a unique email address and demographic information (including, for example, ZIP code, age, sex, job industry, job title, and income) to register.\n\nBilling and Credit Card Information\n\nOur Services comprise, generally business coaching Webinars, Seminars and materials distributed on a subscription basis. To enable payment, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who facilitate completion of the purchase transaction, such as by fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.\n\nWe will not disclose your billing and/or credit card information unless required by law or a court order, or unless disclosure is required to address an issue implicated by the financial transaction. For instance, if you claim that your billing and/or credit card information was used to make a purchase you did not authorize, details about the transaction may be disclosed to law enforcement and any party we deem necessary to address the matter.\n\nHow this Information is Used\n\nThe information we collect is used for a variety of purposes, such as:\n\nto enable your use of our services and fulfill your requests for certain features, such as enabling you to participate in and renew paid services, polls, and message boards;\n\nby performing statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users of our services to improve our relationship with our customers\n\nfor product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base to improve our relationship with our customers;\n\nto customize your experience by allowing advertising to be targeted to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent\n\nDirect Communication\n\nAn important aspect of our services includes direct communication with our customers. As a result, we will periodically send you communications to your email, text, or voice mailbox, via telephone, fax, cell phone, email, paper mail, or any other delivery method regarding the products or services you may have purchased through this Website. We may also send you information about product or service updates, new features, or information we believe you may find interesting. We may send you information regarding other products and services we offer.\n\nHow to access, correct, delete or exercise other rights regarding your Personal Information\n\nIf you would like to request to access, correct, object to the use, restrict or delete personal information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company, you may contact us at info@triplecrownathletic with the subject line “Data Subject Request.” We will attempt to comply with your request. However, the nature of our business, along with the applicable law governing our business, requires us to retain your information for several years. Please also note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.\n\nAs a result, we cannot guarantee the deletion of all your information. But, when we receive a deletion request, we will remove your applicable information from our marketing and billing systems accordingly. This will ensure that there are no further mailings or billings directed towards you.\n\nAs we continue to refine our systems, we will establish a method for the complete removal of all user information from the system without compromising our legal and ethical duties. This document will evolve as these new methods are defined and tested for permanent account deletion.\n\nFor your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nYour choices regarding our use and disclosure of information\n\nWe may use the information you provide for marketing purposes such as promotional emailing, direct mail, and sales contacts. We give you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes. You may opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us if you are a user of products or services and no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by sending a request for list removal to [email protected]. If you have provided your information to us, and opt-out, we will put in place processes to honor your request. This may entail keeping some information for the purpose of remembering that you have opted-out. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you messages for administrative or other purposes directly relating to your use of the products or services, and you cannot opt-out from receiving those messages.\n\nData Retention\n\nWe will retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:\n\nThe length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);\n\nWhether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or\n\nWhether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).\n\nSecurity of Your Information\n\nThe security of personal information is a high priority for us.
