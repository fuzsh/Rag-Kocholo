        "text": "A Triple Crown is right up there among the greatest accomplishments in sports – there’s a reason it took 37 years between Affirmed’s sweep in 1978 and American Pharoah’s triumph in 2015.\n\nBut how many horses have won the Triple Crown? In the 148-year history of the Kentucky Derby, only 13 horses have gone on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes and claim a Triple Crown.\n\nAll distances are 1 1/4 miles for Kentucky Derby, 1 3/16 miles for Preakness and 1 1/2 miles for Belmont unless otherwise noted:\n\n1919\n\nSir Barton\n\nSir Barton was the first winner back in 1919, before the term “Triple Crown” had even been coined. An underdog coming into the race, Sir Barton led every step of the way in the 45th Kentucky Derby and went on to become the first horse to take all three competitions.\n\nJockey: Johnny Loftus\n\nOwner: Commander J.K.L. Ross\n\nTrainer: H.G. Bedwell\n\nDerby time: 2:09 4/5\n\nPreakness time: 1:53 (1 1/8 miles)\n\nBelmont time: 2:17 2/5 (1 3/8 miles)\n\n1930\n\nGallant Fox\n\nThe next sweep occurred 11 years later by Gallant Fox in 1930, under the tutelage of Jim Fitzsimmons, a Hall of Fame trainer.\n\nJockey: Earl Sande\n\nOwner: Belair Stud\n\nTrainer: James Fitzsimmons\n\nDerby time: 2:07 3/5\n\nPreakness time: 2:00 3/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:31 3/5\n\n1935\n\nOmaha\n\nFrom the first crop of Gallant Fox, Omaha has for nearly nine decades held the distinction of being the only Triple Crown winner sired by another.\n\nJockey: Willie Saunders\n\nOwner: Belair Stud\n\nTrainer: James Fitzsimmons\n\nDerby time: 2:05\n\nPreakness time: 1:58 2/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:30 3/5\n\n1937\n\nWar Admiral\n\nWar Admiral – the offspring of Man o’ War and Seabiscuit’s competition in the iconic “Race of the Century” – pulled off the feat in 1937 on his way to becoming one of the most successful thoroughbreds in the history of the sport.\n\nJockey: Charles Kurtsinger\n\nOwner: Glen Riddle Farms\n\nTrainer: George Conway\n\nDerby time: 2:03 1/5\n\nPreakness time: 1:58 2/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:28 3/5\n\n1941\n\nWhirlaway\n\nWhirlaway ran a record-setting 1941 Kentucky Derby, winning by eight lengths (the largest margin in Derby history) while establishing a new record time of 2:01 2/5.\n\nJockey: Eddie Arcaro\n\nOwner: Calumet Farm\n\nTrainer: Ben A. Jones\n\nDerby time: 2:01 2/5\n\nPreakness time: 1:58 4/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:31\n\n1943\n\nCount Fleet\n\nThe 1943 Kentucky Derby was nearly canceled due to wartime restrictions on gasoline and transportation. Run for local spectators only, the “Streetcar Derby” was easily won by Count Fleet.\n\nJockey: Johnny Longden\n\nOwner: Mrs. John D. Hertz\n\nTrainer: Don Cameron\n\nDerby time: 2:04\n\nPreakness time: 1:57 2/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:28 1/5\n\n1946\n\nAssault\n\nAssault won the Kentucky Derby by a record-equaling eightlengths, won the Preakness by a neck, and captured the Belmont Stakes by a marginof three lengths, all in the span of four weeks.\n\nJockey: Warren Mehrtens\n\nOwner: King Ranch\n\nTrainer: Max Hirsch\n\nDerby time: 2:06 3/5\n\nPreakness time: 2:01 2/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:30 4/5\n\n1948\n\nCitation\n\nCitation became the second Triple Crown winner for Calumet Farm in 1948.

Jones\n\nDerby time: 2:05 2/5\n\nPreakness time: 2:02 2/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:28 1/5\n\n1973\n\nSecretariat\n\nArguably the greatest horse of alltime, Secretariat won the 1973 Kentucky Derby. Nicknamed “Big Red” for his reddish-browncolor, Secretariat broke several records in his 16 month racing career.\n\nJockey: Ron Turcotte\n\nOwner: Meadow Stable\n\nTrainer: Lucien Laurin\n\nDerby time: 1:59 2/5\n\nPreakness time: 1:53\n\nBelmont time: 2:24\n\n1977\n\nSeattle Slew\n\nSeattle Slew went on to win it four years later in 1977. Also considered one of the greatest racers in the sport’s history, Seattle Slew sired 1984 Kentucky Derby-winner Swale and many of his descendants are still on the track in 2018.\n\nJockey: Jean Cruguet\n\nOwner: Karen L. Taylor\n\nTrainer: William H. Turner\n\nDerby time: 2:02 1/5\n\nPreakness time: 1:54 2/5\n\nBelmont time: 2:29 3/5\n\n1978\n\nAffirmed\n\nJust one year later, Affirmed pulled off the sweep in 1978.

And then, in 2015, American Pharoah happened. Trained by Bob Baffert and with jockey Victor Espinoza aboard, American Pharoah wrapped up his career with a victory in the 2015 Breeders’ Cup Classic and now resides in retirement at Ashford Stud near Lexington.\n\nJockey: Victor Espinoza\n\nOwner: Zayat Stables\n\nTrainer: Bob Baffert\n\nDerby time: 2:03.02\n\nPreakness time: 1:58.46\n\nBelmont time: 2:26.65\n\n2018\n\nJustify\n\nAnother Baffert-trained colt joined the exclusive three years after American Pharoah. Justify in 2018 ran away with a win in the wettest Kentucky Derby in history, came out on top in the fog and mud in the Preakness and then wrapped it up with a decisive victory in the Belmont. Baffert joined Fitzsimmons in the record books with his second Triple Crown win.\n\nJockey: Mike E. Smith\n\nOwner: China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners LLC, Starlight Racing, WinStar Farm\n\nTrainer: Bob Baffert\n\nDerby time: 2:04.20\n\nPreakness time: 1:55.93\n\nBelmont time: 2:28.18"
