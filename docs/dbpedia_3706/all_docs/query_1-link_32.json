        "text": "Episode #25 of Scottify is below. (Also, follow Scottify on Facebook.)\n\nNot only was this was my second straight episode of Scottify essentially called on the fly (literally, the only thing I knew I was going to play ahead of time was Drive Like Jehu’s “Luau” and Gallows’ cover of Hot Snakes “If Credit’s What Matters I’ll Take Credit”), it was the first episode of Scottify not to air in its usual timeslot.\n\nThe reason for both of these things? Aubrey and I spent the long holiday weekend “camping” (read as: absolutely glamping) in southeastern Ohio, even popping over to West Virginia for about as long as it took to take a photo of the World’s Largest Teapot (honestly? not really worth it).\n\nI was originally going to record a show in advance, but then fellow DJ Will of the Cowboy Kim Super Show (one of the best programs on WCSB, if you ask me) was unable to make his usual timeslot this week, so we decided to do a foreign exchange student program of sorts. Bonus: I got two hours of airtime instead of my usual one! You can hear my super-sized episode below, and if you want to hear what Will played in my timeslot, you can do so here (spoiler: he played a lot of good songs [and unfortunately also that new Fall Out Boy cover]).\n\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.
