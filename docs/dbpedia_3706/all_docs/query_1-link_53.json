        "meta_description": "The Shape of Calling by Orange Island, released 10 July 2001\n\n1. When it Was New Years Eve Three Times a Week\n2. Always Goodbye\n3. The Pledge of Allegiance\n4. Eyes Closed to Motion\n5. Making Her (Walk the Plank)\n6. Personal Vendetta\n7. Crimson and Clover\n\nThe debut release from the Massachusetts post-hardcore/emo outfit Orange Island. Orange Island were once a household name in the scene after numerous US tours and releases on Iodine, Triple Crown Records, and Rise Records. While never fitting neatly into a box when it came to genres, Orange Island brought influences from post-hardcore, emo, and punk, while maintaining a unique sound that was well ahead of its time. Shape of Calling is an upbeat album full of sing-along anthems, but the lyrics focus on loss, regret, and struggling with alcoholism in a small depressed suburban mill town. Produced by Michael Poorman of Hot Rod Circuit. Fully remastered now for its 20-year anniversary by Jack Shirley at Atomic Garden and available digitally for the first time, featuring the bonus cover of Crimson and Clover. \r\n\r\n“Sounding like a drop-D tuned Saves the Day or Jawbreaker, this Clinton, MA, quartet fuses gut-quaking East coast post-hardcore rhythms, à la Quicksand, dual guitar interplay and intelligent and earnest lyrics.” - EXCLAIM",
