        "text": "Fifty years after his Triple Crown triumph, Secretariat and his legacy still loom large over the Kentucky Derby.\n\nHis sub-2-minute sprint around the Churchill Downs track has been approached just once by the 49 other champions since 1973. The mark will be challenged again Saturday, 34 years since his death, by eight horses from his bloodline during the race's 149th running.\n\nSecretariat's Kentucky Derby time is still undefeated\n\nThe Triple Crown is a combination of three races in a single season:\n\nThe Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky\n\nThe Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore\n\nThe Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York\n\nSecretariat, also known as Big Red, started his Triple Crown run 50 years ago when he finished the Kentucky Derby in 1:59.40. Among the jewels of his crown: Big Red went on to set records that still stand at the Preakness and Belmont.\n\nSecretariat's margin of victory and time is even more remarkable when compared with the more than four dozen other winners since.\n\n8 descendants of Secretariat are running in this year's Derby\n\nThis year, eight of the 20 horses competing in the 149th Run for the Roses are part of Big Red's lineage. All trace back to three of Secretariat's 660 offspring:\n\n• Secrettame, born in 1978• Weekend Surprise, born in 1980• Medaille d'Or, born in 1976\n\nAnother horse from Secretariat's lineage, Wild On Ice, had qualified to run in this year's Derby, but he was euthanized the week before the race after a training accident.\n\nSecretariat starting post at the Kentucky Derby is still one of the winningest\n\nSecretariat's starting position toward the center of the field in the 1973 derby has proved a favorable one. The starting gate and how the horse responds to it can have a great influence on its performance and odds.\n\nFifty years ago, Secretariat started in Post 10, which has a good record. This spot boasts nine Derby winners, the second-highest among all gates, and 24 horses that finished in the money.\n\nThe only gate that has produced more champions is Post 5, with 10 Kentucky Derby winners."
