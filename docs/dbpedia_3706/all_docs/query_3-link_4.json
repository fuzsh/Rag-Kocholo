And these are just the songs that are memorable. The majority of the 11 tracks do nothing to distinguish themselves from one another, progressively becoming blander as time ticks away.\n\nThe disc contains a few highlights, however: The aforementioned \"Inhabit\" could be stuck on repeat in my CD player for an hour, and I wouldn't complain. Likewise, \"Tell The Truth\" is a strong rocker, reminiscent of their Triple Crown days. But overall, the album falls flat on its face (thanks in part to the cardboard production of Tim O'Heir. FYI, Tim: this band ain't the All-American Rejects, so don't try to make them sound like 'em).\n\nHot Rod Circuit has written an album's worth of catchy rock songs in their six-year career, but they've been spread out over four full-lengths (plus a handful of EPs). It's almost an insult to say that Vagrant would be better off putting out a \"Greatest Hits\"-type compilation of the band's material, but frankly, that's the only good way to get all their good material in one place. Reality's Coming Through is definitely the wrong place to start, if you're looking for original, hard-hitting Hot Rod Circuit music. I can't imagine the band blowing up from this release, as there's nothing on the album that warrants massive attention (again, outside of \"Inhabit\"). With Andy on his second Safety In Numbers album, and Casey's new band The Only Children having a record coming out in November, I can't imagine Hot Rod staying together much longer with an album this tepid. It's a shame, because this band really had something. Once.\n\nMP3\n\nInhabit\n\nSTREAMING AUDIO\n\nTell The Truth\n\nCheap Trick\n\nSave You"
