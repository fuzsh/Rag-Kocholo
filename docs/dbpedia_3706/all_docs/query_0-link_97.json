        "text": "Feature: Alter The Press! 2011 Preview\n\n2010 has been another superb year for music, with great releases from bands new and old. Here at Alter The Press, it's got us thinking can 2011 follow it up? The answer is a resounding yes!\n\nFor our 2011 preview, we compiled a list of over a 100 bands and artists and then asked our writers to pick out 50 acts to feature. We'll admit it was tough and there maybe some obvious names we've missed out but nevertheless we can promise 2011 is going to be a great year, with both new and old bands set to make their mark.\n\nYellowcard\n\nWords by Jon Ableson\n\nAfter a two and a half year break, one of the most influential pop-punk bands of our time is back! Yellowcard will return in March with their seventh studio album, 'When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes'. If the record sounds anything like the recently debuted live track, 'For You, And You Denial', we could be looking at possibly an early contender for one of the best albums of 2011.\n\nTitle Fight\n\nWords by Jon Ableson\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated releases of next year. The rightly-so dubbed, \"buzz\" band of 2010: Title Fight. If you thought 'The Last Thing You Forget' EP was great, wait till you see these guys live. The band will release their debut full-length on a new label this Summer.\n\nDaytrader\n\nWords by Jon Ableson\n\nWho said good things don't come out of bad situations? When Long Island heroes, Crime In Stereo called it a day, guitarist Gary Cioni formed the pop-punk supergroup (featuring members of Crime In Stereo, Bridge & Tunnel, The Motorcycle Industry), Daytrader. With only a three-track self-released EP under their belts, the band have announced they will release their Run For Cover debut release, 'Last Days In Rome' early next year.\n\nThe Front Bottoms\n\nWords by Jon Ableson\n\nOne of the hottest up and coming bands from NJ, The Front Bottoms are set to release their new EP this Spring. 2010 has already seen the band receive exposure with the recent, 'Slow Dance To Soft Rock' EP, with rave reviews and packed out shows.\n\nMan Overboard\n\nWords by Sean Reid\n\nHaving ending 2010 on a high with a successful UK and European tour, Man Overboard will continue their rise on 2011 with a new EP and a 7\". The former will be released on the bands old label, Run For Cover, whilst the 7\" will be released on their new home of Rise Records. With so much momentum going into the year, expect Man Overboard to continue the \"pop-punk revival\".\n\nThe Get Up Kids\n\nWords by Sean Reid\n\nAfter deciding to ditch the plan to release a series of EP's in favour of a full-length, the legendary Kansas group return in 2011 with 'There Are Rules'. To be released on their own label, Quality Hill Records, The Get Up Kids returns sees the band picking up where 2010's 'Simple Science' left off; a blend of ever consistent song-writing mixed with a progressive and at times experimental touch.\n\nBlink-182\n\nWords by Sean Reid\n\n2010 saw the legendary pop-punk make their return to the UK and are set to continue their comeback with a series of arena shows and festival appearances in the summer. Nevertheless fans will be hoping the band live to their promise and release new material in the spring. Whilst some may question if the new album will be any good, others are thankful that the band are back together.\n\nO'Brother\n\nWords by Sean Reid\n\n2010 was a somewhat quiet year for the Atlanta, GA group. Although having played shows with the likes of Circa Survive, Manchester Orchestra, Moving Mountains, The Felix Culpa, and Biffy Clyro, 2011 will see a new album called 'Garden Window' and is produced by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell from Manchester Orchestra. With a sound that is very much at home on Favorite Gentlemen Recordings, expect to hear more from O'Brother in 2011.\n\nThe Cape Race\n\nWords by Sean Reid\n\nHaving spent most of 2010 working on their dÃ©but release, Manchester's The Cape Race are set to release new material in 2011. Working with producer Pete Miles (Canterbury, Futures, Your Demise, Francesqa and more), The Cape Race's brand of urgent, inspiring rock is set to gather plenty of attention in the coming months. The band will be kicking the year off on a high when they release a new single ('They're Young, They're In Love') on New Years Day.\n\nNightmare of You\n\nWords by George Gadd\n\nIf Morrissey was born in the 1940s and took the role of John Lennon in The Beatles then Nightmare of You is what they'd sound like. Crooning lyrics as illustrated in songs such as; 'I Want To Be Buried in Your Backyard' and 'Heaven Runs on Oil', the band still remains to be relatively unknown despite writing pop songs with beautifully crafted lyrics. Expect the 1960's tinged release around summertime.\n\nAstronautalis\n\nWords by George Gadd\n\nFollowing their collaboration on the brooding closure of 'The Story of My Life' from the album 'Pomegranate', which received favourable reviews from a number of music websites including absolutepunk.net. The folk/rap artist, also known as Charles Andrew Bothwell, is currently recording a collaboration album with P.O.S. who also had a critically acclaimed album with last year's 'Never Better', think of a hip-hop Bad Books.\n\nJamie Woon\n\nWords by George Gadd\n\nAlso featured on BBC's Sound of 2011, Jamie Woon has a lot of hype to follow after releasing his song 'Night Air' which presents his eclectic range of musical styles all blended into one song. The release of 'Night Air' saw critical acclaim from The Guardian, as well as garnering airplay from Radio 1's Zane Lowe, the Ramadanman and Burial remixes only brought more attention to the song. Expect an album Spring 2011 and be sure to catch him on his February/March UK tour for perhaps the most intimate but intense gigs of 2011, get there before he headlines arenas the year after.\n\nManchester Orchestra\n\nWords by George Gadd\n\n'Simple Math' has been described by Andy Hull as a concept album influenced by his wife as well as southern folk-rock legend Neil Young, due for release in March, we've already heard an acoustic rendition of the title track as well as short snippets of the erupting 'April Fool'. By the sounds of it, this album is going to easily be a contender for mainstream radio and if you're not on the Manchester Orchestra bandwagon yet, I highly reccomend you get on it quick.\n\nBloodhound Gang\n\nWords by George Gadd\n\nAfter releasing an aptly titled Greatest Hits album ('Show Us Your Hits,') alongisde the new halloween themed track 'Altogether Ooky' as a precursor to their new album. The band is in the early stages of promoting for the long awaited follow up to 2005's 'Hefty Fine'. You may recognise the bands ubiquitous songs 'The Bad Touch (Discovery Channel)' as well as 'Fire Water Burn,' which are both still prevailant in our heads as well as on our radios a decade later. Keep your fingers crossed, 'Getting Laid On A School Bus' should be released early 2011, but the band has pretty much said that every year, Expect cover art to be just as interesting as the music itself.\n\nTall Ships\n\nWords by Connor O'Brien\n\nHaving released two EPâs in 2010 it was a busy year for Tall Ships, supporting Minus The Bear and 65daysofstatic to name a few took them on tours around the UK and Europe. They will be entering the studio in 2011 to record a single but an album has yet to be confirmed.\n\nArchitects\n\nWords by Connor O'Brien\n\nThese brutes are coming out with one of the first big releases of 2011 in January. âThe Here and Nowâ is released on 24th and by the sounds of âDay In Day Outâ fans are going to get something a bit different from the absolutely beast of âHollow Crownâ. And if youâve been living under a rock they are going out on a UK tour with Bring Me The Horizon, Parkway Drive and Devil Wears Prada in April.\n\nCrazy Arm\n\nWords by James Berclaz-Lewis\n\nAfter releasing their debut 'Born To Ruin' in 2009 to wide-spread acclaim, Crazy Arm have made it a priority to religiously tour around the country stamping their distinctive brand of country-tinged melodic punk rock into the hearts of everyone that dares to give them a listen. If 'Ambertown', the first single of their upcoming 2011 album, is anything to go by then we can expect a sensational year from Crazy Arm and will definitely be a band to follow come the new year.\n\nTubelord\n\nWords by James Berclaz-Lewis\n\n2009 saw the release of their debut album 'Our First American Friends', an exciting cocktail of math rock, pop, post-hardcore and the secret ingredient X. They followed it up in 2010 with their unusually named 'Tezcatlipoca' EP which saw them slow their style down and offer a fresh take on their music. Bubbling with creativity, it's hard to tell what could come next, which makes 2011 that much more exciting for it.\n\nTellison\n\nWords by James Berclaz-Lewis\n\nIn 2007, these math-popers were awarded the Rock Sound Best Unsigned band. A few years along the road, Tellison have refined their sound as proved by their most recent single 'Collarbone'. Far from toning down the adorable geekiness of their style, they seem to have updated it and polished their lyrics to remain relevant. If we are to believe the quality of their first album, then their sophomore album should be a right corker.\n\nSucioperro\n\nWords by James Berclaz-Lewis\n\nArguably the soul-mates of fellow Scotsmen Biffy Clyro, Sucioperro have been gracing the rock scene with their exciting and angular guitar rock for a few years now without ever breaking out into the mainstream. However, their underground credibility and fan loyalty has allowed them to continue against all odds in the shadow of their more successful fellows. After releasing their new album's debut single 'Threads' in 2010, it seems they still have more than enough in them to create some of the most exciting rock you're likely to come across.\n\nDrawings\n\nWords by James Berclaz-Lewis\n\nLike many others out there, the loss of Reuben within the British alternative rock scene was a significant blow for the emerging scene of the time (mainly consisting of the likes of Hell Is For Heroes, Hundred Reasons, Reuben, Million Dead and the like). Only a very small number of bands have thus hinted towards the character and charisma these bands showcased. That is exactly the reason for Southampton's Drawings, who mix hard rockness with unexpected melodies and vocal harmonies while still managing to sound like the casual lads having a laugh down at the pub. Get in this before it's too hot.\n\nTell It To The Marines\n\nWords by James Berclaz-Lewis\n\nCurrently writing their debut, younglings Tell It To The Marines seem to walk the very fine line between indie and that infectious rock we're all looking for. Sewing epic vocal lines with atmospheric guitars the band intertwine various levels of noise by always keeping an eye for a melody. Don't come here looking for a hook though, these guys are in for the intricate instrument lines. Indie haircut haters, though, beware as they still need a little time to mature.\n\nTexas In July\n\nwords by Connor O'Brien\n\nItâs been two years since their killer debut album âI Amâ was released in 2009 and since then they have signed to Equal Vision Records, lost and gained a guitarist and toured relentlessly across USA and Europe. Theyâre currently in the studio writing a new album which is due for release this year and will no doubt get out on the road again.\n\nRival Schools\n\nWords by Connor O'Brien\n\nWe were all stoked to see Rival Schools get back together and play some shows this year. Their long awaited second album âPedalâ is due for release in March and theyâre also heading out on tour across Europe with And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead so 2011 looks to be a big year for their come back.\n\nPianos Become The Teeth\n\nWords by Connor O'Brien\n\nâOld Prideâ has received great reviews this year and although itâs unlikely we will be seeing a new release from these guys in 2011 they are finally making their way over to Europe in April with Suis La Lune.\n\nLower Than Atlantis\n\nWords by Connor O'Brien\n\n2010 was a big year with âFar Qâ and touring and thereâs more to come from Lower Than Atlantis in 2011. The new album is titled âWorld Recordâ and is set for release early in the year.\n\nWe Came As Romans\n\nWords by Dan Issitt\n\nLooking to build on their substantial success in their native US, Troy Michiganâs We Came As Romans are set to go. They have a co-headline UK tour with The Word Alive booked for April, and a new album set to drop in the summer. If metalcore with synths and plenty of beatdowns is your thing, We Came As Romans are set to be your new favourite band.\n\nAsking Alexandria\n\nWords by Dan Issitt\n\nBased in Yorkshire, but far bigger in the US, 2011 could be the year metalcore mob, Asking Alexandria finally make a bigger name for themselves in their homeland. They followed their 2009 debut âStand Up And Screamâ with an EP and track for the 'Punk Goes Pop' Compilation this year, but 2011 holds two big releases for the band. Following in the footsteps of Bring Me The Horizon, January will see the release of âStepped Up & Scratchedâ a remix album, hotly followed by their sophomore effort in March.\n\nBelleville\n\nWords by Dan Issitt\n\nOne of the hottest properties from Kent at the moment, eclectic four-piece Belleville have big plans for 2011. Following hotly on the heels of their recently released âThe Promises EPâ, the band will be hitting the studio to record a long awaited debut album. Guaranteed to be full of dance-enthused epic Indie numbers, itâs definitely something to keep an ear out for. Anticipated slots at the summer festivals, and a busy countrywide touring schedule, mean this band will be at your door and in your lives before you know it.\n\nStates\n\nWords by Dan Issitt\n\nA band very much in itâs infancy, States, featuring members of both Lydia and Copeland, released their debut EP âLine âem upâ at the tail end of this year. States play upbeat female-fronted indie infused with 60âs pop sensibilities. The inevitable likeness to Paramore will be drawn upon, due to frontwoman Mindy White's friendship with Hayley Williams, but musically their is no comparison. Sure to be picked up by a major label this year, expect this band to be all over the music press and airwaves in no time.\n\nAlaska\n\nWords by Dan Issitt\n\nBleak hardcore in the vein of Rise and Fall is the order of the day for this young hardcore mob. Alaska boast one of the most brutal sounding vocalists in the UK right now, and if the progession from their demo âMMXâ to the two tracks on their recent split with End Reign are anything to go by, whatever they release next will be mind-blowing. Straight-up with no gimmicks, these boys will provide the perfect soundtrack to the bleakest of years\n\nScarlet Grey\n\nWords by Dan Issitt\n\nThere is no question that given the right break, this band could easily go stratospheric. Based in LA, the band play the kind of stadium orientated rock, that 30 Seconds To Mars play, but on a less egocentric level. Their âFancy Blood EPâ and backing by AFIâs Davey Havok may suggest to the uninitiated some kind of goth tendencies, but this is far from the truth. When the full length from this band drops, they will explode.\n\nBlitz Kids\n\nwords by Chris Marshman\n\nThis lot have a potentially massive 2011 ahead of them, having seemingly picked up a head of steam in 2010, they now have the weight of some pretty powerful players behind them, with their just released tantalising teaser of their upcoming album; 'Story' is a big step up for these guys, featuring a guest vocal from a certain Aled Phillips, it sees them transform their brand of techy pop rock into something spectacular and if the album follows in it's footsteps, we could very well see this band reaching the heights of their guest vocalist.\n\nNot Advised\n\nwords by Chris Marshman\n\nThis band have potential written all over them, after a relatively quiet 2010, Not Advised are ready to bounce back with a bang with an as yet unwritten album for 2011, easily the best pop/punk/rock band in the UK at the moment, their penchant for writing a catchy hook is second to none, and with the mainstream starting to take notice in the form of You Me At Six taking them out on tour, it's only a matter of time before they get the recognition they oh so deserve.\n\nBright Eyes\n\nWords by Chris Marshman\n\nAfter the utterly spectacular 'Cassadaga' 2011 sees the hotly anticipated return of Conor Oberst and co. in the form of Bright Eyes, new album \"The Peoples Key\" is set for a February 15th release and Bright Eyes are set for yet another historic show, headlining Londons prestigious Royal Albert Hall in June, tickets are selling fast, but you can still pick up some limited seating, it promises to be a special show and you'd be mad to miss out.\n\nStraight Lines\n\nWords by Chris Marshman\n\n2010 saw the emergence of perhaps one of the biggest surprises of the year, Straight Lines' debut album 'Persistance In This Game' has headed a fair few peoples top 10 of the year, earning rave reviews throughout the scene, and quite rightly so! 2011 now sees the pressure being turned on, with the expectations of maintaining their own high standard, it's going to be a big year for the lads in Straight Lines and we have no doubts they'll make it their own.\n\nDance Gavin Dance\n\nWords by Chris Marshman\n\nPerhaps one of the most exciting releases in 2011 will be Dance Gavin Dance and the release of their new album 'Downtown Battle Mountain II', having recently reunited their original line up, the presence of Jonny Craig with the spectacular technical ability of Dance Gavin Dance promises one of the most anticipated releases of 2011, if you're not convinced then the band are in London in May to showcase their new album and their 2007 classic 'Downtown Battle Mountain' and its soon to be released follow up, on two separate dates, get down and see them, and you'll soon see what all the fuss is about.\n\nThe Dangerous Summer\n\nWords by Nick Robbins\n\nBaltimoreâs The Dangerous Summer released Reach for the Sun in 2009 to much critical acclaim, though not a massive amount of commercial success. A UK tour in 2010 in which they opened some tiny venues seemed to ill-fit a band with a quality back-catalogue. Anyone who heard their 'Live in Baltimore' CD will appreciate how tight this band sound live and how well their album sound can translate on tour. 2011 will see them release their second full-length, and if the early release of track 'Good Things' is indicative of the rest of the album, 2011âs AOTY could be sewn up already.\n\nMoving Mountains\n\nWords by Nick Robbins\n\nFor those who missed out, 2007s Pneuma was a quite phenomenal record. Mixing post-rock with melodic hardcore, the album created sweeping sound-scapes all the while remembering they were a rock band. After signing to Triple Crown Records, former home of Northstar, Brand New and Hot Rod Circuit, they are gearing up to release their second album in 2011. The wait will almost certainly have been worth it, and it is doubtful that it will remain the cult-classic Pneuma became. Jump on this band-wagon now.\n\nTaking Back Sunday\n\nWords by Nick Robbins\n\nNine years after âTell All Your Friendsâ was unleashed on the world, Taking Back Sunday are back to their original line-up and set to release their most anticipated album. While I expect most people who read this site will be familiar with TBS it is always worth mentioning them. I have no doubt this will be many music writersâ most anticipated album of 2011, and the album most people will have been waiting for since John Nolan and Shaun Cooper left the band.\n\nKyoto Drive\n\nwords by Nick Robbins\n\nBrummie rockers Kyoto Drive have been steadily releasing solid records since their inception, with last yearâs 'This Is All We Ever Wanted' being criminally overlooked by many. If you liked Spitalfield or The Early November then Kyoto Drive are definitely for you. Look out for them realising another album this year.\n\nCanterbury\n\nWords by Nick Robbins\n\nTheir album, which was distributed on a pay-what-you-want platform, was a free treat to many but was well worth the price of a normal CD. Their follow up single âGloriaâ garnered them a fair amount of play on the music channels and their newest EP âCalm Downâ has built on that success. At the forefront of the UK revival in pop-rock, Canterbury look just about set to emerge as its leader. A current support slot with You Me At Six might potentially see their roles reversed in the not-so-distant future.\n\nFreeze the Atlantic\n\nWords by Nick Robbins\n\nFormed out of the ashes of a raft of quality UK hardcore bands and featuring Guy Davies from Reuben on drums (one of the best drummers I have ever seen live) Freeze the Atlantic are yet to officially release anything bar a few tracks on their MySpace page. Luckily these tracks are all of a high enough quality to put their debut full-length (being recorded currently [Nov 2010]) at the top of my most anticipated list. Inevitably sounding like a cross between Reuben, Hundred Reasons and Hell is for Heroes, this should be a welcome listen to anyone still mourning the deaths of their favourite UK bands.\n\nPolar\n\nWords by Matt Buck\n\nPolar have already been tearing up venues up and down the country in 2010 and expect more of the same in 2011. The most energetic live band youâll ever find, recently signed to A Wolf at the Door Records and fresh from a stint of shows with Gallows. Polar are ready to take their own brand of punk hardcore to the masses. Expect a new release on the February 21st, followed by the Relentless/Atticus tour with TRC, Feed the Rhino and Heart in Hand beginning in April.\n\nCav OK\n\nWords by Matt Buck\n\n2010 was been a big year for Cav OK, playing bigger and better shows and really creating a buzz around the underground scene with their unique blend of electro, indie and rock. Expect the band to move onto a new level on 2011. Definitely ones to watch, they have a new EP out in the early part of the year followed by their biggest show to date, playing the IndigO2 venue at the O2 arena.\n\nMute Math\n\nWords by Matt Buck\n\nMute Math are quite simply one of the best bands Iâve ever seen live! Mute Math enjoy a moderate level of success over in the States but have never taken off over here, why? No label support! Quite why a label wouldnât want to sign them over here makes me very worried about the state of the music scene. Simply check them out on Youtube and youâll see why they deserve your attention. Theyâve just released a live DVD/CD and you can expect another glorious album of grandiose rock in 2011. Fingers crossed theyâll make it over here, because they will quite simply blow your mind!\n\nWhat Now\n\nwords by Matt Buck\n\nRecently seen touring with The Xcerts and having enjoyed coverage nationwide and here on Alter The Press! Originally from South Africa but now residing in London, What Now have just released their debut EP; âTake Controlâ. With comparisons being made from Blink 182 to The Swellers, via Jimmy Eat World and Midtown, Iâd say that they have got they sounds pretty spot on, ready for the masses. If they can get a full length out in 2011 then who knows where it will take them?\n\nFin Raziel\n\nwords by Matt Buck\n\nHaving released the âFallout EPâ in 2010; Fin Raziel managed to capture the imagination of people all around the world with their brand of epic melodramatic synth rock, most notably becoming one of the most popular new rock acts in South Africa. Having played a handful of sell out shows in and around London the band went straight back into the studio to record 2011âs release; âBecome the Seaâ. Expect the new EP to drop around March and the band to make many more friends around the UK and beyond during 2011.\n\nTo Catch a Thief\n\nwords by Matt Buck\n\nTo Catch a Thief scored a 5/5 EP review in 2010 on Alter the Press! Everyone should be excited to hear what they come up with when they finally release their debut album in early 2011. If they continue where they left off in 2010 then they simply cannot fail to succeed. One of the ones to watch in 2011 for sure, its definitely onwards and upwards for this band.\n\nTwin Atlantic\n\nwords by Matt Buck\n\n2010 was a huge year for Twin Atlantic, releasing the EP; âVivariumâ led them to tour the UK countless times and head over to the States. They ended up playing arenas with the likes of Blink 182 amongst others and selling out the Glasgow ABC in a triumphant home coming show. Expect more in 2011 as the band release their debut album. In the words of Sam from the band; \"My ambition is so great for this band that I'm never going to be really happy until we're one of the big guys\". Well I think it will be mission accomplished in 12 months time.\n\nIn addition to these 50 acts, expect releases from the likes of Death Cab For Cutie, All Time Low, Panic! At The Disco, D.R.U.G.S. (Destroy, Rebuild, Until God Shows), Stagecoach, Ute, Pegasus Bridge, Jumping Ships, Deaf Havana, You Me At Six, The Republic Of Wolves, Castevet, Grown Ups, Defeater, Caravels, The World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die, Fireworks, GDP, The Ocean Between Us, Delta/Alaska, La Dispute, Balance and Composure, Former Thieves, Into It. Over It., Such Gold, The Felix Culpa, Athletics, Moonlit Sailor, The Lions Rampant, Emmure, Radicus, Hear The Sirens, A Shipwreck A Castaway, What Hands Are For, This Or The Apocalpyse, Me and the Mountain, Life On Repeat, Mozart Season, The Dear and Departed, Eisley, Kids Can't Fly, Cuba Cuba, Don Broco, Brother, Basement, Starters, Hang The Bastard, Transit, Burn The Fleet, He Is We, Gracer and many, many more.\n\nEdited by Sean Reid.\n\nWords by Jon Ableson, Sean Reid, James Berclaz-Lewis, Dan Issitt, Chris Marshman, Matt Buck, Nick Robbins, George Gadd and Connor O'Brien."
