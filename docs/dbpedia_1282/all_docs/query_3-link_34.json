        "text": "On 20 October 1962, the results of the elections for the conciliar commissions were announced.\n\nIn addition to the 160 elected bishops, John XXIII added nine appointed members bringing the total number in each commission to twenty-five.\n\nAlthough there was no Jocist ‘ticket,’ the results revealed a significant representation of movement-linked bishops in nearly every Commission.\n\nThis was particularly so in the all-important Doctrinal Commission on Faith and Morals (Doctrinal Commission) and in the Lay Apostolate Commission (LAC), which now had the clumsy, formal title of Commission on the Apostolate of the Faithful, Press and Public Spectacles [sic], each of which each included at least eight such bishops.\n\nDoctrinal Commission\n\nElected\n\nGabriel-Marie Garrone, longstanding proponent of the JOC\n\nJoseph Schröffer, who participated in the IYCW Rome pilgrimage in 1957\n\nAlfredo Scherer, a JOC supporter from Brazil\n\nPaul Emile Léger, a Canadian proponent of the SCA movements\n\nAndré-Marie Charue, who had links with the Belgian JOC back to 1924\n\nMarcos McGrath CSC, Holy Cross father and JOC patron in Panama\n\nMaurice Roy, pioneer JOC chaplain, cousin of Quebec JOC founder, Henri Roy\n\nAppointed\n\nBishop Georges Pelletier, Canadian bishop closely linked to the SCA movements\n\nLay Apostolate Commission\n\nElected members\n\nManuel Larrain, pioneer of Specialised Catholic Action in Chile\n\nFranz Hengsbach, bishop of Essen, seat of the German JOC/CAJ\n\nJacques Ménager, bishop responsible for Catholic Action movements in France\n\nJohn E. Petit, an English bishop close to the YCW\n\nJoseph Blomjous, of Dutch origin, supporter of the SCA movements in Tanzania\n\nPaul Yu Pin, JOC pioneer in China before coming to Formosa (Taiwan)\n\nGerardus De Vet, director of (Specialised) Catholic Action, Breda, Netherlands\n\nAppointed\n\nRené Stourm, an early JOC chaplain in France\n\nThis gave the Jocist bishops close to a third of the numbers in each of these commissions, with the former responsible for the future Lumen Gentium, and both responsible for the eventual Gaudium et Spes.\n\nOther members of the LAC also supported the JOC and Specialised Catholic Action to varying extents, including Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez, the Salesian archbishop of Santiago, who admired Cardijn, Emilio Guano, a former International Movement of Catholic Students (IMCS-Pax Romana) chaplain from Italy, as well as Castellano and Luigi Civardi\n\nfrom Italian Catholic Action.\n\nThe Doctrinal Commission also included Vienna Cardinal Franz König, who had known Cardijn for decades particularly through the Pax Romana network.\n\nA notable absentee in the LAC, however, was Cardijn’s Belgian ally, Charles-Marie Himmer, whose nomination had been opposed by Suenens, who confirmed this in a 16 October 1962 letter to Veronica O’Brien of the Legion of Mary:In any event, the 65 Belgian missionary bishops are behind me – which is not the case for the seven here (i.e. the seven diocesan bishops)… I felt this in De Smedt’s manoeuvres which aimed to place Himmer on the list of candidates for the Catholic Action Commission (i.e. Lay Apostolate Commission). I told him privately that I did not agree with the idea but he publicly returned to the charge for him to be included on our list.\n\nIndeed, Suenens was ‘very isolated among the Belgian bishops on account of his ideas of the lay apostolate,’ as Congar noted, although he remained undeterred in his campaign against the alleged ‘monopolisation’ of Catholic Action.\n\nOther Commissions\n\nPromisingly, every other commission also included a Jocist presence.\n\nBishops and Government of Dioceses\n\nEmile Guerry, another French JOC pioneer\n\nPierre Veuillot, previously in the Holy See, connected to France’s Mission ouvrière\n\nDiscipline and Sacraments\n\nAlexandre Renard, Liénart protégé, involved in the Ecole Missionaire du Travail in Lille\n\nDiscipline of the Clergy and the Christian People\n\nGuillaume Van Zuylen, bishop of Liège, Belgium\n\nAgnelo Rossi, JUC/JIC chaplain from Brazil\n\nFrançois Marty, JOC/JAC chaplain in France\n\nThomas Cooray omi, Colombo, Sri Lanka\n\nReligious\n\nGerard Huyghe, bishop of Arras, another Liénart protégé and promoter of SCA\n\nJean Janssens SJ, the Jesuit Superior General and close friend of Cardijn\n\nMissions\n\nGuy Riobé, bishop of Orleans, JAC chaplain and promoter of JOC and ACO\n\nJean Zoa, bishop of Yaoundé, Cameroon, former JOC chaplain\n\nCardinal Manuel Gonçalves Cerejeira, a Cardijn disciple since the 1930s\n\nLiturgy\n\nHenri Jenny, Sillon sympathiser from Lille, and auxiliary bishop to Guerry at Cambrai\n\nJoseph Malula, JOC chaplain from Congo Kinshasa\n\nEnrique Rau, former national chaplain of JOC Argentina\n\nBernardo Fey Schneider, former national chaplain of JOC Bolivia\n\nSeminaries, Studies and Catholic Education\n\nRamon Bogarin, JOC founder in Paraguay\n\nDenis Hurley omi, Cardijn disciple from South Africa\n\nEmile Blanchet, participated in 1950 JOC Internationale congress, Brussels\n\nJustin Simonds, Melbourne co-adjutor and long-time JOC supporter\n\nChristian Unity\n\nChristian Unity\n\nEmile-Joseph De Smedt, former JOCF chaplain and close to Cardijn\n\n, former JOCF chaplain and close to Cardijn\n\nOriental Churches\n\nMelkite Patriarch Maximos IV Saigh\n\nSOURCE"
