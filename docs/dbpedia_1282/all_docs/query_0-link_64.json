According to an article by ecclesiastical historian Msgr. Vicente Cárcel y Ortí, in a letter written in 1928, King Alfonso XIII asked Pope Pius XI that Valencia would again be a cardinalitial see (its last cardinal, Archbishop Enrique Reig y Casanova, had been transferred in 1922 to the metropolitan and primatial see of Toledo) and to promote its archbishop Prudencio Melo y Alcalde to the cardinalate. Msgr. Cárcel Ortí found the letter in the Secret Vatican Archive in the fund pertaining to that pontiff. The pope responded in writing saying that at the moment he could not make the promotion because Spain already had the habitual number of cardinals, four, two of them fixed, Toledo and Sevilla; and the other two variable. The pope recommended that the monarch wait for a future occasion but the time passed, and because of the circumstances, it was not possible. Not until 2007 did Valencia have a cardinal again, when Pope Benedict XVI promoted Archbishop Agustín García-Gasco Vicente to the cardinalate.\n\nJuly 15, 1929 (XI)\n\n(32) 1.

Bishop Iuliu Hossu, of Cluj-Gherla of the Romanians, Romania, was created cardinal in this consistory and reserved in pectore. He died in confinement on May 28, 1970. His creation as a cardinal was revealed in the consistory of March 5, 1973.\n\nNote 2. On February 22, 1969 in a private audience between Pope Paul VI and Monsignor Hieronymus Menges, former professor of theology in Bucharest, the latter asked the pope to do something that would encourage the Romanian faithful and the pope asked: \"what\"? in response to what he could do. Monsignor Menges recommended that the pope create both Bishops Áron Márton of Alba Iulia and Iuliu Hossu of Cluj-Gherla, as cardinals as well as name several priests as monsignors. Pope Paul VI agreed and tasked Archbishop Agostino Casaroli with seeing whether it would be acceptable to the Romanian government. Archbishop Casaroli sent his aide to meet with the Minister for Culture in Bucharest to ask if the double appointment would be welcomed. The Minister assured the aide that Bishop Márton's appointment would be acceptable to them but that Bishop Hossu was an unacceptable choice. Bishop Márton himself learned that he was to be created a cardinal but refused upon learning that the government had denied Bishop Hossu. But the pope circumvented the government: he named Bishop Hossu a cardinal and reserved him \"in pectore\" and never made Bishop Márton a cardinal.\n\nNote 3. This was the largest consistory since the one celebrated by Pope Pius XII on February 18, 1946, in which he created thirty two cardinals. Pope John Paul II created forty-two cardinals in the consistory of February 21, 2001 and it became the largest consistory in history.\n\nMarch 5, 1973 (IV)\n\n(89) 1.
