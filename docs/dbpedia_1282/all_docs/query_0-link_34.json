        "text": "Name Diocese Dio/Order Notes Sources\n\nRev. Carlos Aedo Méndez\n\nTemuco diocese Diocesan/Diocesano\n\nSuspended in November 2017 due to an accusation that he had sexually abused a boy 26 or 27 years previously. Héctor Eduardo Vargas Bastidas, S.D.B., the bishop of San José de Temuco, sent the case to the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. As of January 2018, the church's investigation apparently was ongoing.\n\nBishop Vargas announced Mendez's suspension one month after the alleged victim presented a complaint to the diocese. Méndez had ministered at San Enrique de Purén parish since April 2012.\n\nThe alleged abuse occurred in the early 1990s in the town of Galvarino, also in the Temuco diocese. At the time, the boy's family filed a complaint with civil authorities, and then-bishop Sergio Contreras Navia suspended Méndez from ministry. Méndez reportedly had been placed under house arrest during the ensuing civil investigation but ultimately was acquitted.\n\nEmotiva Eucaristía de despedida en Victoria al párroco Carlos Aedo del Sagrado Corazón, Iglesia.cl, 04.16.2012\n\nSuspenden priest of Purén for sexual abuse denunciation occurred 27 years ago, by Carlos Martinez, biobiochile, 11.12.2017\n\nSacerdote de Purén fue suspendido tras acusación de abuso sexual a menor, Cooperativa.cl, 11.13.2017\n\nRev. René Aguilera Colinier\n\nSan Bernardo diocese Diocesan/Diocesano\n\nVicar of education of San Bernardo diocese until 2007. Chaplain of several schools. Committed suicide in September 2010 after admitting to church officials that he had grabbed the buttocks of a 14-year-old schoolboy and tried to kiss him during confession.\n\nA report by CIPER, a Chilean center for investigative journalism, found that the school’s primary concern was to report the abuse to the diocese before informing civil authorities or the victim’s family. Four days after the priest’s suicide, the victim’s mother filed a complaint. The school, in a statement published by the diocese of San Bernardo, admitted it had not reported within the 24-hour period mandated by law (see Chile's Code of Criminal Procedure articles 175 and 176). Instead, the school informed the parish's “advisory team,” which included lawyers who eventually formalized a complaint to civil authorities.\n\nNot included on the Chilean bishops' public list of guilty clerics.\n\nCorte Suprema Rechazó Recurso a Favor de Profesora Lesbiana, lanación.cl, 04.20.2008\n\nInvestigan muerte de sacerdote al interior de una parroquia en San Bernardo, Emol.com, 09.09.2010\n\nCura que se Suicidó Tras Confesar Abuso a Menor Fue Vicario de Educación y Exoneró a Profesora Lesbiana, by Pedro Ramirez, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística), 11.22.2010\n\nSuicidas pedófilos, by Teresa Gurzaa, etcetera.com, 05.20.2011\n\nIglesia Catolica De Chile Entrego Listado Oficial De Los Sacerdotes Condenados Por Abusos a Menores, by Ana Maria Guerra, La Segunda, 11.11.2011\n\nRev. Richard Joey Aguinaldo Apóstol, S.V.D.\n\nSanta María de Los Ángeles diocese Society of Divine Word/Congregación del Verbo Divino\n\nFilipino. Transferred to Chile in 1991. Worked in schools. Convicted December 2011 of sexually abusing two four-year-olds at the Liceo Alemán del Verbo Divino (German School of the Divine Word) in Chicureo [Chacabuco Province]. At the time, Aguinaldo headed the department of missions for the Congregación del Verbo Divino (Society of the Divine Word), served as the Society's vice-provincial (second-in-command) and worked at the Liceo's sister school in Los Ángeles [Bío Bío Province]. Following the arrest warrant, the Society refused to disclose his whereabouts, \"sheltered him in various branches and buildings of the congregation,\" and invested resources to defend him.\n\nAguinaldo was sentenced January 2012 to a 4-year, 200-day probation rather than the eight years in prison requested by the prosecutor. The Provincial Superior of the Society of the Divine Word immediately announced the Society’s “full support” of another trial for Aguinaldo, so that he could “demonstrate his complete innocence.”\n\nIn February 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the priest's conviction and sentence, rejecting a mistrial motion by the defense. [See the court's ruling.] The family of one of the victims filed a civil suit in September 2012 for 700 million pesos against the school. A year later, civil authorities told Aguinaldo that he would have to leave Chile upon completion of his sentence in 2017.\n\nIn late 2015, the victim's family dropped the lawsuit in exchange for a public apology and unspecified reparations by the Society. In apologizing for its \"errors and omissions\" in handling the case, the Society finally admitted that Aguinaldo indeed had abused the two children and had been rightfully convicted.\n\nNot named in the Chilean bishops' original list of 18 guilty clerics, published November 11, 2011, but named in all subsequent iterations of the list, from 2012 to 2016. In August 2016, the bishops unpublished the list of names, replacing it with a list of tallies.\n\nSacerdote filipino acusado de abusos sexuales seguirá en prisión preventiva, cooperative.cl, 11.26.2009\n\nDenuncia de abuso en el Liceo Alemán: La promesa incumplida del cardenal y el ocultamiento del acusado, por Pedro Ramirez y Juan Pablo Figueroa en Actualidad y Entrevistas, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística), 05.09.2010\n\nIglesia Catolica De Chile Entrego Listado Oficial De Los Sacerdotes Condenados Por Abusos a Menores, by Ana Maria Guerra, La Segunda,\n\n11.11.2011\n\nDeclaran culpable a sacerdote filipino por abusos sexuales contra menores de 4 años en Chicureo, by Mario Rosende, biobiochile, 12.29.2011\n\nCarta de Padres de niño abusado en Liceo Alemán del Verbo Divino, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística), 01.05.2012\n\nComunicado de la Congregación del Verbo Divino, Iglesia.cl, 01.08.2012\n\nTribunal sentenció a sacerdote filipino a cuatro años de libertad vigilada por abusos sexuales, cooperativa.cl, 01.09.2012\n\nCongregacion del Verbo Divino dio \"todo su apoyo\" a sacerdote condenado por abusos sexuales, cooperativa.cl, 01.09.2012\n\nPriest Charged with Child Abuse in Chile Gets Four Years Parole, by Juan Francisco Veloso, OlguinSantiago Times, 01.10.2012\n\nJosé Andrés Murillo Llamó a LA Iglesia a Ser \" Más Solidaria\" Con Las Víctimas De Abuso, The Cooperativa, 01.10.2012\n\nVerbo Divino Senalo “Apoyo” a Sacerdote Conendado por Abusos en Chicureo, lanacion.cl, 01.09.2012\n\nCorte Suprema rechazo nulidad del juicio a sacerdote del Verbo Divino condenado por abusos, por Juan Pablo Figuero en Actualidad y Entrevistas, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística), 02.29.2012\n\nSupreme Court Ruling, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística), 02.29.2012\n\nCongregación de colegios del Verbo Divino reconoce caso de abuso sexual de cura y pide perdón por \"errores y omisiones\",The Clinic Online, 11.06.2015\n\nComunicado Misioneros del Verbo Divino, Iglesia.cl, 11.06.2015\n\nAguinaldo retiró demanda contra colegio Verbo Divino de Chicureo, El Mostrador, 11.17.2015\n\nFacebook, 04.13.2016\n\nIglesia retira de su web lista con nombres de sacerdotes condenados por abusos, by Camila Mardones, La Tercera, 09.28.2016\n\nRev. José Andrés \"Fr. Tato\" Aguirre Ovalle\n\nSantiago archdiocese\n\nDiocesan/Diocesano\n\nArrested October 2002 after a mother filed a criminal complaint that he had sexually assaulted her two daughters, ages 11 and 14. The girls were members of the parish where Aguirre worked, in the Santiago municipality of Quilicura [Santiago Province]. The abuse of the two children lasted from 1999 to 2002.\n\nAguirre was known as \"Fr. Tato.\" He worked at a number of Catholic girls' schools, including in Honduras, where he had been sent in 1994 by Cardinal Carlos Oviedo (Santiago archbishop 1990-1998) following earlier reports of child sexual abuse.\n\nIn September 2002, the day after a mother accused Aguirre of abusing her two daughters, Aguirre again was allowed by Santiago archdiocesan leaders to flee Chile for Honduras. He was soon summoned back to stand trial.\n\nAfter the priest's arrest, more victims came forward. One girl said she had revealed Aguirre's crimes to other priests during confession and was told merely to pray about it. Her confessors included Archbishop Cox, who was suspected at the time of sexual abuse.\n\nIn June 2003, a Chilean court sentenced Aguirre to 12 years in prison for the crime of “abuso deshonesto” against nine girls and statutory rape against a tenth victim. (He reportedly had raped and impregnated at least one girl when she was age 13.) Aguirre thus became the first Chilean priest to be convicted of sexually abusing children.\n\nAlthough the criminal trial considered only crimes committed by the priest between 1998 and 2002, the judge ruled that the Church had had prior notice of Aguirre's criminal tendencies and so was jointly responsible for reparations to the victims. The Church was guilty of failing to act with care to prevent future crimes, the judge said.\n\nAguirre was released from prison in November 2012, 24 months early, sparking concern among residents of the Santo Domingo district where he decided to locate. He died in November 2013 at age 56 from complications of muscular myotonic dystrophy.\n\nIncluded on Chilean bishops' public list of guilty clerics.\n\nDeclaración del Arzobispo de Santiago, Cardenal Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa, Iglesia.cl, 10.24.2002\n\nCaso del \"cura Tato\": Octavo procesamiento por abuso sexual, El Mercurio de Valparaiso, 10.31.2002\n\nRights-Chile: Bishop Suspected of Sex Abuse Retires to\n\nMonastery, by Gustavo Gonzáles, ipsnews2, 11.01.2002\n\nEn el Nombre de Tato, by Víctor Gutiérrez, La Nación, 04.27.2003\n\nCura Tato condenado a 12 años de prisión, El Mercurio, 06.25.2003\n\nYo, Pecadora, by Juan Manuel Ugalde R., La Nación, 06.29.2003\n\nCorte Suprema confirmo condena a 12 anos para el cura \"Tato\", cooperativa.cl, 01.05.2005\n\nTop Cardinal, Tarcisio Bertone, Blames Paedophile Crisis on Homosexuals, by Ruth Gledhill, The Times, 04.13.2010\n\nSnapshots of Catholic Priests Accused of Abuse, Associated Press, 04.14.2010\n\nLas Sotanas Sucias se Lavan en Casa, elciudadano.cl, 01.23.2011\n\nLa condena del \"cura Tato\" llega a su fin, by E.

A prosecutor investigated. He escaped without criminal charges: judicial proceedings were suspended provided the priest leave the country for at least three years. Araujo reportedly relocated to Lima but a journalist who sought to interview him there couldn’t determine his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to one news report, Araujo also worked in the Chilean town of Cañete [Arauco Province, Biobío Region].\n\nIncluded in the Chilean bishops' original list of 18 guilty clerics, released November 2011.\n\nSacerdote Abandona el País, El Mercurio, 04.15.2001\n\nChile/Pederastia: Procesan a Sacerdote, by Gilberto Villarroel, BBCMundo.com, 10.18.2002\n\nAbogada Magina Zegpi Pons: “La Iglesia ya entendió que no puede ocultar a pedófilos”, by Sonnia Mendoza, revistanos.cl, 03.2011\n\nIglesia reveló listado de sacerdotes condenados por abusos contra menores en Chile, cooperativa.cl, 11.11.2011\n\nRev. Audín Osvaldo Araya Alarcón, S.D.B.\n\nConcepción archdiocese Salesians of Don Bosco/Salesianos de Don Bosco (Salesians)\n\nArrested in May 2011 on charges he sexually abused three high school students at Colegio Salesiano in Concepción [Bío Bío Region] between March and November 2008. Araya was the high school's rector. One of the students committed suicide just before the start of the investigation.\n\nDays after Araya's arrest, attorneys for the victims filed a canonical complaint before the ecclesiastical tribunal of the Concepción archdiocese, requesting that Araya be removed permanently from the priesthood.\n\nAccording to the prosecutor, the congregation learned of the abuse in December 2008 and transferred Araya to Puerto Montt, where he became director of another Salesian school. He later was relocated to a Salesian retirement home in Santiago.\n\nIn January 2014, he was sentenced to two years of prison on two counts of sexual abuse of one of the students. Araya maintained his innocence throughout and was absolved of three other counts of sexual abuse. The two-and-a-half years he had already spent under house arrest were applied to his sentence, and he was therefore released.\n\nThe sentence also banned the priest for life from working in education, prohibited him for a period of three years from any employment that might bring him in contact with minors, and required him to inform the police of his residence every three months for 10 years\n\nIn a March 2014 communiqué, the Salesians announced that Araya's defense would not appeal. They said they were awaiting the outcome of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's investigation of Araya, who in the meantime would be prohibited from exercising ministry. In the Salesians' five previous statements about Araya, dating back to May 2011, there had been no mention that he had been suspended from ministry.\n\nBy July 2014, Araya's name had been added to the Chilean bishops' list of clerics found guilty under canon or civil law. He remained on the list until 2016, when the bishops removed it from their website.\n\nConcepción: Ex alumno de Salesiano relata presuntos abusos sexuales de cura que fue rector de colegio, by Denisse Charpentier, biobiochile.cl, 06.22.2010\n\nFiscalía de Concepción formalizará a sacerdote por supuestos abusos sexuales, by Joaquín Peñailillo, La Tercera, 02.22.2011\n\nFormalizan por abuso sexual a ex rector de Colegio Salesiano de Concepción, elmostrador.cl, 05.13.2011\n\nSacerdote salesiano de Concepción acusado de abusos quedó en prisión preventiva, Cooperativa.cl, 05.13.2011\n\nPriest in Chile Accused of Sexually Abusing Minors, AFP, 05.13. 2011\n\nIndagaran Complicidad De Congregacion Salesiana En Denuncia De Abuso Sexual Contra Ex Rector, The Publimetro, 05.13.2011\n\nPresentan acusación canónica en contra de sacerdote por abusos sexuales en Concepción, by Alvaro Guerrero, La Tercera, 05.24.2011\n\nEl Escandaloso Clóset de los Salesianos,The Clinic Online, 06.07.2011\n\nJusticia Chilena Prepara Juicio Oral Contra Sacerdote Pederasta, noticiaaldia.com, 11.27.2012\n\nDenunciante del Ex Obispo de Iquique Declarará Acusando Abusos de Audín Araya en Concepción, biobiochile.cl, by Erasmo Tauran, 05.31.2013\n\nCondenan a sacerdote de Concepción por abuso sexual reiterado de un menor, emol.com, 01.09.2014\n\nEx director del colegio Salesianos de Concepción fue declarado culpable por abusos sexuales, cnnchile, 01.10.2014\n\nLa Deuda que Deió El Cardenal Ezzati como Arzobispo de Concepción en Caso de Abuso de Menores, by Pedro Cid, biobiochile, 01.13.2014\n\nTribunal condena a dos años de cárcel a sacerdote Audín Araya por abusos sexuales, emol.com, 01.19.2014\n\nSacerdote condenado por abuso sexual contra menor no irá a prisión, Cooperativa.cl, 01.19.2014\n\nSacerdote Fue Sentenciado a Dos Años de Cárcel, recortes.iglesia.cl, 01.20.2014\n\nComunicado de la Congregación Salesiana sobre el caso del P.

Arrested by Chilean police in August 2009 for downloading child pornography at Liceo Politécnico El Señor, a school that enrolled 500 children in the municipality of Renca [Santiago Province, Santiago Metropolitan Region]. Arregui had been living in Renca since January 2008 while working as a professor at Universidad Santo Tomás, also in Santiago.\n\nThe Chilean police confiscated thousands of hardcore images of naked children and 400 hours of pornographic videos, including dozens containing explicit pedophilic content filmed by Arregui. He had filmed the children in Spain between 1992 and 2005, when he worked in seven schools as a clergy member of the Viatorians, or Clerics of Saint Viator, a teaching order. The videos showed at least 15 children, ages 12-14, from at least three of the schools, where Arregui is said to have sexually abused as well as filmed them -- touching them, engaging in mutual masturbation, and penetrating them with objects. Only after his arrest in Chile was it revealed that he had gained personal access to the 15 Spanish children to \"measure\" them under the pretext of his doctoral thesis on physical growth during adolescence. He also installed hidden cameras in the schools' gymnasiums, locker rooms, and showers. In 2004, he was institutionalized for depression and attempted suicide. Two years later, still in Spain, he defended his doctoral thesis. The Viatorians assigned him in January 2008 to a teaching position at Universidad Santo Tomás in Santiago.\n\nThe provincial superior of the Clerics of Saint Viator in Madrid said that the congregation never knew about Arregui's actions, and that there had been no similar accusations against him in the past. Chilean prosecutors, however, reportedly suspected that the congregation was protecting the priest. The Viatorians were believed to have paid for Arregui's lawyer, one of the most expensive in the country.\n\nIn March 2010, Arregui was sentenced by a Chilean court in March 2010 to 817 days in jail for possession of child pornography.\n\nA few days later in Spain, a Spanish victim filed the first criminal complaint against Arregui in that country. A former student of the San Viator school in Huesca, the complainant said that he had been molested by Arregui when he was 7 or 8 years old.\n\nArregui was extradited to Spain. In November 2011, he was convicted by a Madrid court of child pornography possession, and sentenced to eight months in jail and a four-year prohibition from any employment that might bring him in contact with minors. The statute of limitations had been reached for the allegations of child sexual abuse and molestation.\n\nVictims of Arregui during his various assignments in Spain continue to come forward.\n\nNot included on Chilean bishops' public list of guilty clerics.\n\nUn Religioso Encarcelado en Chile Filmó Cómo Abusaba de 15 Menores en España, by Maria R.

The woman discovered in late 1995 that Baeza had sexually abused two of her four teenage daughters , when each of the girls was 15 years old. One of the daughters filed rape charges against him in 2009; there was no conviction. Baeza is said to have been sexually involved with three other wives of Chillán businessmen and to have sexually abused a number of other adolescents. Baeza was removed from ministry in early 1996. He was discovered in 2008 to be leading a Schönstatt movement group called \"The Dawn\" in Huepil. He was married with two sons.

In 2010, he was sanctioned by the church after a preliminary investigation. His name appeared on the Chilean bishops' initial public list of convicted priests, published November 11, 2011; Benavides was listed under the sub-category of those who had received a canonical sentence. However, a letter to the editor from supporters of Benavides objected to the priest's inclusion on the list, pointing out that his canonical case was still in process, the appeal stages not exhausted and thus his sentence not final.\n\nBenavides' name was removed from two subsequent versions of the bishops' list (see the October 1, 2012 and July 26, 2013 lists).\n\nListed on the San Felipe diocesan website in October 2013 among priests of the diocese.\n\nIn December 2013, San Felipe bishop Cristián Contreras announced that Benavides' conviction under canon law had been confirmed and that he had been expelled permanently from the clerical state, the most severe penalty possible under church law. The ruling was unappealable and substantiated the three counts of child sexual abuse. He is barred permanently from administering sacraments, celebrating mass in public or in private, and participating in other religious activities.\n\nFollowing his 2013 laicization, Benavides' name was reinstated on the Chilean bishops' list of those found guilty under civil or canon law.

Convicted in November 2012. The abuse occurred from 2008 to 2010, beginning when the boy was age 13 or 14. Cartes, the boy's confessor, abused him on at least four occasions: inside the rectory; at the parish school, where he was chaplain; at the shrine, El Carmen de Curicó, where the boy was an altar server; and at the priest's private residence, where he hugged, kissed, and caressed the boy, put the boy's hands on his genitals, and had the boy masturbate in front of him.\n\nSentenced in December 2012 to 5 years' probation, and banned for an additional 10 years from work with children. Ordered to pay 30 million pesos (nearly 55,000 U.S. dollars) in damages to the victim. Also to be included in the national child sex offender registry. Cartes went on a hunger strike to protest his conviction.\n\nIncluded on Chilean bishops' public list, under the sub-category of clerics found guilty in civil court. The Chilean church, however, concluded differently: On October 15, 2016, the church announced that while its own investigation had found the priest's behavior to be \"reckless\" and so warranting a reprimand, it could not determine his guilt \"with moral certainty.\" Cartes was thus cleared to return to ministry, a church official said in a press conference.\n\nIt is not clear how the church's approval of his return to ministry can be reconciled with the civil court's 2012 ruling that he not work with children.\n\nDeclaración del Obispo de Talca ante acusación contra sacerdote, iglesia.cl, 03.29.2011\n\nSacerdote Francisco Cartes Aburto: Cura será formalizado por presuntos abusos sexuales a un menor, by Sergio Bustos, Iglesia.cl, 05.21.2011\n\nIglesia Catolica De Chile Entrego Listado Oficial De Los Sacerdotes Condenados Por Abusos a Menores, by Ana Maria Guerra, La Segunda,\n\n11.11.2011\n\nComunicado de prensa del Obispado de Talca, Iglesia.cl, 11.09.2012\n\nDeclaran Culpable de Abusos Sexuales a Sacerdote de Curicó, by Mónica Ñancupán and Marcos Peña, 24 Horas, 11.09.2012\n\nSacerdote de Curicó es Condenado por Abuso a un Menor de Edad, La Nación, 11.09.2012\n\nSacerdote Francisco Cartes Cumplirá Condena en Libertad, by Luis Albert Cabello, vivimoslanoticia.cl, 12.05.2012\n\nSacerdote Condenado por Abuso Sexual Fue Internado en Hospital, El Diario de Caracas, 01.29.2013\n\nVíctima del Sacerdote Francisco Cartes Cuenta su Verdad, 24 Horas, 08.23.2013\n\nComunicado de Prensa, Diocese of Talca, 10.15.2016\n\nTribunal Eclesiástico desestimó acusación que pesaba sobre sacerdote Francisco Cartes, Diario El Centro, 10.16.2016\n\nBrother Jesús Castañeda, S.M.

By the late 1970s, he also was national director of the Schönstatt Movement in Chile. In 1981, he went to Rome to serve as Secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Family, returning to Chile in 1985 when he was named coadjutor archbishop of La Serena [Elqui Province, Coquimbo Region].\n\nThroughout these years, beginning in the 1970s, he was warned about his inappropriate behavior toward seminarians and other youths.\n\nIn 1990, Cox became archbishop of La Serena. An ex-priest who worked under him said that Cox would greet his favorite youth with kisses on the mouth, unconcerned that people were watching. The ex-priest also said that Cox used the archdiocese's dormitories to house young male visitors.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a priest named Manuel Hervia reportedly discovered Cox in flagrante delicto with a young man. Hervia saw Cox's misconduct as an abuse of authority and submitted a complaint to the bishops' conference. (In 2011, Hervia himself would be accused of child sexual abuse.)\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Cox's \"obsessive sexual inclination toward young people\" was an open secret, according to a 2002 investigative report by journalist Alejandra Matus Acuña.\n\nIn 1997, Cox resigned at age 63 after being investigated by the apostolic nuncio in Santiago.\n\nDespite the numerous allegations against him, Cox remained publicly active in the Church following his resignation. He assumed the presidency 1997-1999 of the National Commission for Jubilee 2000. He then went to Rome, ostensibly to work for the Great Jubilee Committee, but actually for psychological treatment, according to some reports. He then took a position with the Latin American Episcopal Council in Bogotá, Colombia.\n\nAlthough Cox never faced criminal charges, he reportedly sexually assaulted minors as well as young adults. In October 2002, Cox retired to a Schönstatt monastery in Germany and asked for forgiveness \"for this dark side that is inside me, and that stands in opposition to the life and teachings of Jesus.\"\n\nHis successor as archbishop of La Serena, Manuel Donoso, admitted that in the short time he had served as auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese, he had received nine complaints about Cox. The allegations involved \" excessive affection\" that \"everyone saw\" but the abuse was difficult to prove. \"I humbly ask for forgiveness in the name of the Church if any person or family was affected,\" said Donoso.\n\nCardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz, who was then archbishop of Santiago, minimized the allegations against Cox. He conceded that Cox \"had a somewhat exuberant affection,\" which \"was addressed to all kinds of people, although it is more surprising in relation to children.\" But, he said, Cox never had been named in any formal complaints. However, a priest quoted anonymously by El Mostrador said that Errázuriz had been aware of Cox's misconduct since seminary days and had promoted and favored him nonetheless.\n\nShortly after Cox announced his move to a monastery in 2002, the Chilean bishops' conference, which was headed by Errázuriz at the time, issued a tactful statement that included no condemnation of Cox's behavior. \"It is not our intention to place judgment on what occurred in the privacy of his [Cox's] conscience,\" the bishops wrote. \"... We understand and support Monseñor Cox's decision to retire to a life of prayer.\"\n\nErrázuriz and Cox reportedly have been close friends since their youth. They studied together, were ordained the same year (1961), and were members and then leaders of the Schönstatt movement in Chile.\n\nCox was not included on Chilean bishops' public list of guilty clerics in the five years (2011-2016) it was posted. He retains the title archbishop emeritus of La Serena.\n\nRights-Chile: Bishop Suspected of Sex Abuse Retires to Monastery, by Gustavo Gonzales, 11.01.2002\n\nNuncio Cavalli descartó que denuncias contra sacerdotes afecten a la Iglesia, cooperativa.cl, 11.01.2002\n\nIglesia Reconoce que Recibió Nueve Denuncias Contra Cox, Primera Linera, 11.02.2002\n\nEl arzobispo de La Serena reconoce haber recibido reclamos contra Cox, elmercurio.com, 11.02.2002\n\nLos Archivos Secretos Cox, by Alejandrea Matus, primerlinea.cl, 11.03.02\n\nProductor Tomás Cox: \"Nuestra familia está muy afectada y con mucho dolor\", estrellavalpo.cl, 11.04.2002\n\nHoras dolorosas llaman a la conversión, Iglesia.cl, 11.05.2002\n\nFrente a las denuncias: La cruz de la Iglesia, entrevista de Raquel Correa, El Mercurio, via Iglesia.cl, 11.10.2002\n\nCardenal Errázuriz y sus calculos: ¿Son \"poqutios\" los casos de curas abusadores en Chile?, by Juan Pablo Barros, The Clinic, 04.06.10\n\nTop Cardinal, Tarcisio Bertone, Blames Paedophile Crisis on Homosexuals, by Ruth Gledhill, The Times,\n\n04.13.2010\n\nSnapshots of Catholic Priests Accused of Abuse, Associated Press, 04.14.2010\n\nEl Ostracismo de Monseñor Cox, La Nación.cl, 05.09.2010\n\nSacerdote Manuel Hervia: \"Descubrí al obispo Cox en una relacion homosexual\", by Pablo Vergara, The Clinic, 04.11.2011\n\nLas Negligencias y Omisiones del Cardenal Errázuriz que lo Tienen Cuestionado a un Día de Comenzar el Cónclave, por Alejandra Carmona, elmostrador, 03.11.2013\n\nEpiscopado Chileno, Iglesia.cl, 11.26.2013\n\nRev.

To date, it is not known how many of the eight complainants allege they were abused by Cuevas.

Joseph Doherty Congregación de la Santa Cruz (Congregation of the Holy Cross)\n\nRev. Julio Dutilh Ros\n\nSantiago archdiocese Diocesan/Diocesano\n\nIn November 2014, a woman told the Santiago archdiocese that Dutilh had groped her breast during confession in February 1989, when the woman was 16. In a preliminary investigation, the archdiocese deemed the allegations credible. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith authorized Santiago archbishop Ricardo Ezzati to discipline Dutilh. Ezzati chose three mild penalties: Dutilh was removed from the parish, instructed to make monthly pilgrimages for one year to pray for the victim and his own 'spiritual journey,' and told to \"hear confessions in a confessional, and in that way avoid close proximity to the penitent.\"\n\nIn June 2015, Ezzati announced Dutilh’s departure from Santa María in Las Condes, where he had been pastor since 1999. The archbishop implied that the alleged abuse was only one of the reasons for the priest's removal - the other was that Dutilh already submitted his resignation three years earlier, when he turned 75. The statement also noted that the victim \"was not [considered] a minor, according to canon law of the time,\" and that the canonical statute of limitations had been reached.\n\nDutilh remains in ministry. In July 2015, he was appointed parochial vicar of San Alberto Hurtado, also in Las Condes. In September 2016, he was observed saying Mass at that parish, apparently as its pastor. On October 25, 2017, he concelebrated Mass with Ezzati to mark the establishment of San Alberto Hurtado as an official parish.\n\nNot included in Chilean bishops' list of guilty clerics.\n\nLetter to victim from auxiliary bishop Fernando Ramos Pérez, Archdiocese of Santiago, 05.07.2015\n\nCommunicado del Arzobispado de Santiago, Iglecia.cl, 06.17.2015\n\nEzzati remueve a sacerdote de parroquia en Las Condes por acusación de abuso sexual, The Clinic Online, 06.18.2015\n\nIglesia remueve a párroco de Santa María de Las Condes, Latercera, 06.18.2015\n\nExclusivo: Habla la víctima de sacerdote removido Julio Dutilh, por Verónica Moscoso, 24Horas.Cl, 06.22.2015\n\nDecrees of Archdiocese of Santiago, 07.2015\n\nDenuncian que sacerdote fue cambiado de parroquia tras abuso en medio de confesión, by Piangella Obradorbiobiochile.cl, 09.06.2016\n\nRevelan que cardenal Errázuriz designó a cura sancionado por abuso para oficiar misas en otra parroquia, eldinamo.cl, 09.06.2016\n\nIglesia cambia de parroquia a sacerdote sancionado por abuso durante la confesión, by Alejandra Carmona López, elmostrador.cl, 09.06.2016\n\nMonsenor Ezzaati se reune con agentes pastorales y feligreses de San Alberto Hurtado, Parroquia San Alberto Hurtado, 10.25.2017\n\nRev.

Nibaldo Escalante Trigo\n\nPunta Arenas diocese\n\nLa Serena archdiocese\n\nDiocesan/Diocesano\n\nIn November 2002, investigative journalist Alejandrao Matus reported Escalante's alleged abuse of a boy in the 1990s as part of a La Nación series about clerical sexual abuse cases during the tenure of La Serena archbishop and alleged child molester Francisco José Cox. Cox was archbishop of La Serena in 1990-1997.\n\nAccording to Escalante's victim, during a trip in Escalante's car from the boy's home in Ovalle to the church, the priest massaged the boy's legs and back. At the church, Escalante massaged the boy's body, kissed him, hugged him, and told him repeatedly how impressed he was with the boy's development.\n\nEscalante worked in at least three different parishes in the archdiocese: San Juan Evangelista parish, located in Compañía Alta, city of La Serena; Cristo Resucitado parish, in the town of Tierras Blancas; and one or more of three parishes in the city of Ovalle: San Vicente Ferrer, El Divino Salvador and El Santísimo Redentor. All five parishes are in Elqui Province, Coquimbo Region.\n\nYears earlier, another priest reportedly had seen Escalante lying down with a boy in a rectory and reported the incident to then-archbishop Cox, who dismissed the accusations because \"there was no proof.\"\n\nUnbeknown to the public, Escalante was removed from ministry for life by the Vatican in 2008. The archdiocese gave him a place to live in his hometown of Andacollo, Elqui Province, Coquimbo Region, where he reportedly was seen co-organizing youth vocational trainings with the rector of the diocesan sanctuary.\n\nThe public had no knowledge of Escalante's 2008 punishment until April 2011, when La Serena's then-archbishop Manuel Donoso confirmed the priest's guilt in the church's only official statement on the case, saying that the victim had not wished to file a complaint with civil authorities. Asked why the case wasn't made more public earlier, he said it was to \"protect the people.\" Until this point, the townspeople had assumed that Escalante had returned to his hometown to settle down during retirement.\n\nIncluded on the Chilean bishops' list of guilty clerics for the five-year period (2011-2016) the list was public. Escalante's name appeared in the sub-category of those who were sentenced under canon law.\n\nA propósito de curas, pedofilia, violencia y poder, El beat del tambor (blog), 04.28.2010 [quotes extensively from investigative journalist Alejandra Matus's 2002 series about child sexual abuse by clerics during the administration of confirmed molester Archbishop Francisco Cox]\n\n\"Cuando la verdad sale, si alguien se equivocó, tiene que pedir perdón y hacer gestos públicos\", interview of La Serena archbishop Manuel Donoso, reprinted in El Observatodo, originally published in Diario La Región, 04.2011\n\nCommunicaco Iglesia La Serena, choapa.cl, 04.03.2011\n\nArzobispo de La Serena Confirma Caso de Sacerdote Condenado por Abuso Sexual, El Observatodo, 04.04.2011\n\nIglesia Catolica De Chile Entrego Listado Oficial De Los Sacerdotes Condenados Por Abusos a Menores, by Ana Maria Guerra, La Segunda, 11.11.2011\n\nBrother Adolfo Fuentes Corral, S.M.\n\nSantiago archdiocese Congregation of Marist Brothers//Congregación de los Hermanos Maristas\n\nSpanish. In October 2017, an investigative report by The Clinic Online identified several Marists and other clerics who allegedly abused children at Marist-run schools and camps. The article included an account by a man who said that he was raped twice by Fuentes when he was six. The first assault occurred in a tent at a Marist-run camp. The second occurred shortly after the child had entered Alonso de Ercilla Institute, the prestigious Marist school in Santiago. He said that Fuentes took him out of class and led him through a tunnel to a room beneath the school's gym, where Fuentes forced him to perform oral copulation, then made him wash his teeth in a nearby bathroom.\n\nFuentes' name has never appeared on the Chilean bishops' list of clerics convicted under canon or civil law.\n\nEl oscuro sótano de los Maristas, by Claudio Pizarro and Jonás Romero, The Clinic, 10.25.2017\n\nEl escándalo de pederastia de los Maristas se reproduce en Chile, by Guillem Sànchez, El Periodico, 01.06.2018\n\n\"Nunca escapamos de aquella habitación de los Maristas,\" by Guillem Sànchez, El Periodico, 01.10.2018\n\nEx alumno marista: Hay varios casos de abuso sexual que no están prescritos, Cooperativa.cl, 02.26.2018\n\nEl relato de la primera mujer denunciante del Caso Maristas, by Claudio Pizarro and Jonás Romero, The Clinic, 03.20.2018\n\nCaso maristas suma más de 30 denuncias y fiscal accede a fichas de religiosos, by Sebastián Labrín, La Tercera, 04.22.2018\n\nRev.

Gajardo sexually assaulted the victim during a religious retreat. The youth was staying overnight in the youth home of the P.

Galaz was director of Pequeño Cottolengo, a home for severely mentally disabled children in Rancagua [Cachapoal Province, O'Higgins region], and the boys were residents there.\n\nGalaz was arrested in July 2005 after Pequeño Cottolengo employees accused him of sexually abusing the boys. One of the incidents had occurred earlier that month when Galaz drove his victim from the home to his private residence, where he raped him.\n\nThe case was brought by the prosecutor's office and the National Service for Minors (Sename). One of the witnesses, an ex-seminarian, said that he was pressured by the Superior General of the Orionine Fathers to withdraw the accusation against Galaz.\n\nAfter the court's July 2006 guilty verdict, the director of the Orionine Fathers in Chile said that \"we have always believed in Fr. Jorge's innocence, and we continue to even now.\"\n\nAt the time of the verdict, the prosecutor had been investigating Galaz for sexually abusing two other residents of the home, ages 6 and 24.\n\nIn August 2006, Galaz was sentenced to 15 years and one day in prison. He continued to say he was innocent, and his attorney filed to appeal the sentence. In November 2006, the Court of Appeals confirmed the priest's sentence of 15 years and a day.\n\nIncluded on the Chilean bishops' public list of guilty clerics from when the list first appeared in November 2011 to when the bishops unpublished it in August 2016.\n\nFiscal amplia cargos contra sacerdote, by Paola Moreno, El Mercurio, 03.25.2005\n\nCorte rechaza libertad de director de Pequeño Connolengo, El Mercurio, 08.06.2005\n\nCura Galaz: \"I have not violated any children\" El Mercurio (Chile), 06.06.2006\n\nCaso Cottolengo: A un día de conocer el veredicto, sacerdote reitera su inocencia, El Mercurio, 07.24.2006\n\nDenuncias contra sacerdotes, Iglesia.cl, 07.25.2006\n\nCaso Cottolengo: Declaran culpable a sacerdote por violación de dos menores, El Mercurio, 07.25.2006\n\nCondenan a Cura por Violación de Dos Niños y Fiscal Indaga Otros Casos, by Barbara Saez, La Tercera, via recortes.iglesia.cl, 07.26.2006\n\nSacerdote del Pequeño Cottolengo Condenado a 15 Años, emol.com, 08.11.2006\n\nSorpresiva renuncia de la defensa de sacerdote Galaz, by Paola Moreno, elmercurio.com, 08.15.2006\n\nCaso Cottolengo: Defensa de sacerdote Galaz presenta recurso de nulidad, El Mercurio, 08.21.2006\n\nAbogada Magina Zegpi Pons: “La Iglesia ya entendió que no puede ocultar a pedófilos”, by Sonnia Mendoza, revistanos.cl, 03.2011\n\nAbusos: La lista de los curas condenados e investigados, by Claudio Leiva Cortés, La Nacion, 05.16.2011\n\nIglesia reveló listado de sacerdotes condenados por abusos contra menores en Chile, cooperativa.cl, 11.11.2011\n\nAbusos Sexuales en la Iglesia Catolica [Sexual Abuse in the Catholic Church], pp. 219-220, by Jorge Llistosella, 2012\n\nIglesia retira de su web lista con nombres de sacerdotes condenados por abusos, by Camila Mardones, La Tercera, 09.28.2016\n\nRev.

In charge 1983-1992 of Hogar Indígena Padre Remigio Gúbaro, a boarding school for indigenous (Pehuenche) children in Santa Bárbara, in the Bío Bío region. The school was owned by the Los Ángeles diocese and affiliated with El Servicio Nacional de Menores (Sename).\n\nIn 1988, female chaperones at the school reported to Sename that Gielis was behaving suspiciously with the children at night. Sename sent the report to Bishop Adolfo Rodriguez, who did nothing to stop the priest.\n\nIn 1992, civil authorities launched an investigation when four children from the home wrote letters (see 3 of the 4 letters, as published by CIPER) reporting their abuse by Gielis. The priest admitted to touching the children's genitals with his hands and mouth, and Bishop Rodriguez acknowledged having received the chaperones’ complaint against Gielis in 1988. Nonetheless, legal proceedings against the priest were dismissed by the investigating judge, Erasmo Sepulveda. After a few articles in local newspapers (see 1-2 and 3), Judge Sepulveda prohibited any further media reports on the case. With the permission of Bishop Rodriguez, the former bishop of Los Ángeles, Orozimbo Fuenzalida, transferred Gielis to Fuenzalida’s then-current diocese of San Bernardo.\n\nGielis stayed in ministry in the San Bernardo diocese for the next 19 years, working in parishes and a school and running the diocese’s Marriage Encounter program. He worked at Laguna de Aculeo until 2005 when he was named pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes, in Nocedal Villa. In December 2009 he was assigned to Ascension of the Lord parish in La Platina, and in August 2009 he became chaplain of Manuel Balmaceda School.\n\nIn July 2010, Gielis traveled home to Belgium for vacation, where he was arrested on charges of child sexual abuse. A Belgian prosecutor appealed to the Chilean courts for access to the victims and witnesses from the 1992 case. In the city of Los Ángeles [Bío Bío Province], police re-opened the investigation.\n\nDespite Gielis’s admission in 1992 and the strength of the evidence against him, he was never added to the Chilean bishops’ list of guilty priests during the five years it was public (2011-2016).\n\nIn 2016, a lone mention of his name in an April 2016 Chilean court gazette indicated that he might be back in Chile.\n\nPDI Indaga Caso De Sacerdote Belga Acusado De Abusar De Niños En Hogar Indígena De Santa Bárbara, Biobiochile.cl, 10.05.2011\n\nJusticia belga investiga a sacerdote por abusos sexuales contra menores pehuenche, by Juvenal Rivera (Los Ángeles) and Pedro Ramírez, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística)10.03.2011\n\nRev.

The church opened an investigation and asked the individuals who filed the complaint to attend a neighboring parish to avoid any run-ins with him. He was later suspended from ministry in El Monte. No known criminal charges.\n\nIn an interview published online in December 2015, the bishop of Melipilla, Cristián Contreras Villarroel, said that, after a period of spiritual retreat, González was transferred to Virgen Medianera de Cartagena, another parish in the diocese, where he ministers in the community, tends to the sick, and celebrates mass.\n\nThe bishop also said that the diocese is awaiting the outcome of the investigation by civil authorities.

González worked at the school at the time. In March 2012, the Jesuits found González guilty of child sexual abuse and suspended him permanently from ministry. According to the Jesuits, the cleric was transferred 'immediately' to the San Ignacio Residence in Santiago, where he is prohibited from contact with minors and adolescents without 'the presence of other responsible adults\" and is limited to domestic chores. The allegation against González was not made public by the Jesuits until May 2018.\n\nInformamos sobre casos de abuso cometidos por sacerdotes y religiosos, San Ignacio de Loyola, 05.31.2018\n\nComunicado de la Compañía de Jesús en Chile, Jesuitas Chile, 05.31.2018\n\nCompañía de Jesús sancionó a dos sacerdotes por casos de abusos, Cooperativa.cl, 05.31.2018\n\nRev.

The Jesuits' superior general imposed a five-year restriction on Guzmán's ministry, whereby he could not celebrate mass publicly, was prohibited form contact with minors, and could not leave his residence without permission from his superior. In June 2017 the restrictions were extended to another five years. Former students had come forward in 2010 and 2011, having found one another via Facebook. The Jesuits claimed that they had not received complaints about the priest during his years at the school, but one former student stated that he had reported abuse by Guzmán 17 years previously. Guzmán's victims said that the abuse involved the priest photographing them naked while bathing, and touching their genitals during confession. The Jesuits announced on January 31, 2018 that a canonical investigation was to be opened based on new information the order had received against Guzmán.\n\nComunicado de la Compañía de Jesús, JesuitasChile, 01.22.2018\n\nLas culpas del cura Guzmán, by Carla Ruiz Pereira and María José O'Shea Cox, La Tercera, 01.27.18\n\nComunicado de la Comañía de Jesús en Chile, Reflexión y Liberación, 01.31.2018\n\nRev.

Another man subsequently reported that Healy initiated a sexual relationship with him when the man was 23 years old, also in the 1980s. Healy did not deny the allegations. The first accuser reported Healy to civil authorities; Columban order investigated, then referred findings to the Vatican. In August 2012, the Columban Fathers announced that the Vatican had found Healy guilty.. Healy was prohibited from public ministry and forbidden from contact with children or vulnerable adults, unless accompanied by another. His good behavior and compliance could modify the penalties.\n\nHealy was not included in the Chilean bishops' first public list of 18 convicted clerics when it was published in November 2011.

He was listed under the sub-category of those convicted under canon law for sexual abuse of a minor.\n\nHealy's name was missing from the published list dated January 4, 2016, and it was missing also from the July 20, 2017 list that the bishops' conference did not publish but did share with CIPER. Asked to explain Healy's removal from the list after 2014, his congregation explained to CIPER that at the time the boy was abused, 16-year-olds were not considered by the church to be minors. We infer from this, but have not confirmed, that Healy successfully appealed the Vatican's judgment against him, resulting in a reversal of his guilty verdict and removal of penalties.\n\nSuperior de los padres columbanos frente a denuncia por abusos sexuales: “No voy a negar la verdad\", by Gustavo Villarrubia, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística, 10.26.2011\n\nDeclaración Pública de los Padres Columbanos, ciperchile.cl, 10.27.2011\n\nChurch probes allegation against Kerry priest in Chile, by Simon Brouder, The Kerryman, 12.14.2011\n\nSacerdote columbano fue sancionado por casos de abuso sexual de menores, cooperativa.cl, 08.06.2012\n\nLa Iglesia recibe al Papa ocultando el fallo por abusos sexuales del ex obispo de Iquique, by Gabriela Pizarro and Pedro Ramírez, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística), 01.10.2018\n\nRev. Juan Arnoldo Henríquez Zapata\n\nValparaíso diocese Diocesan/Diocesano\n\nCharged in March 2010 with procuring sexual services from children and inciting prostitution of a minor. Juan Henríquez was pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes parish in the small city of Limache [Marga Marga Province, Valparaíso Region]. According to the victims, two boys ages 15 and 16, the priest paid them 25,000 pesos in April 2008 in exchange for sex. The incidents took place in his parish residence.\n\nThe bishop of Valparaíso, Monsignor Gonzalo Duarte, SS.CC., immediately announced Henríquez's suspension.\n\nAt the priest's arraignment, the mother of one of the boys retracted her previous support of her son's claim and said the priest was innocent. Henríquez, who initially had admitted guilt, went on to plead innocent, saying that his confession had been due to extortion by the boys and \"external pressures.\"\n\nIn March 2011, Henríquez was convicted of inciting prostitution with one of the boys and given a suspended sentence of 3 years and 1 day. His alleged crime against the other boy was still being investigated, according to a 2011 news report.\n\nValparaíso bishop Gonzalo Duarte responded to the conviction by reiterating his March 2010 pledge to cooperate fully with civil authorities.\n\nWhen the Chilean bishops first released a list of guilty clergy in November 2011, Henríquez was included in the sub-category 'convicted under Chilean criminal law' ['condenados en la justicia penal chilena'.]\n\nIglesia reveló listado de sacerdotes condenados por abusos contra menores en Chile, cooperativa.cl, 11.11.2011\n\nDeclaración pública del Obispado de Valparaíso, Iglesia.cl, 03.26.2010 [see original article]\n\nFormalizan a un párroco de Limache acusado de abusos sexuales, by Hernán Cisternas, El Mercurio, 03.26.2010\n\nPárroco de Limache acusado de abusar de dos menores quedó con arraigo nacional, cooperativa.cl, 03.26.2010\n\nAbren proceso contra sacerdote por abuso sexual contra menores, diarioelsur.cl, 03.26.2010\n\nInformes cruzados marcan formalizacion ce sacerdote, El Mercurio de Valparaíso, 03.27.2010\n\nAcusado un Párroco Chileno por Abuso e Incitación a la Prostitución, catolicosincensura.com, 04.07.2010\n\nDeclaración Sobre Condena a Sacerdote Juan Henríquez Zapata, Valparaíso Diocese Communications Dept., documentos.iglesia.cl/conf, 03.16.2011\n\nObispado de Valparaíso recalca confianza en sistema judicial tras condena a párroco de Limache, elmostrador.cl, 03.16.2011\n\n3 años de condena para cura limachinole, La Estrella, 03.17.2011\n\nSacerdote condenado a tres años, El Mercurio de Valparaíso, 03.17.2011\n\nRev.

Juragaro was found in possession of images “involving the privacy of individuals, including a female minor\" who was 16 years old.\n\nAuthorities found that between October 2011 and August 2012, he had installed a hidden video camera at the church in the girls' bathroom and shower, and transmitted the footage to a computer in his bedroom. His crime was discovered after he handed over his personal camera, where he had stored some of the images, to someone from whom he was seeking technical help. It contained images of the body parts of at least five females, three of them minors, while they were using the bathroom.\n\nJuragaro admitted guilt. Sentenced in June 2013 to a reduced sentence of 541 days and fined $300. He was allowed to serve his sentence outside of jail. Current whereabouts unknown.\n\nFrom November 2011 to August 2016, the Chilean bishops posted a list of clerics found guilty under canon or civil law of abusing minors. The list grew from 18 to 30 names over the five-year period.

Fernando Karadima Fariña\n\nSantiago archdiocese Diocesan/Diocesano\n\nOnce considered Chile’s most revered and powerful priest, Fernando Karadima was declared guilty by the Vatican in November 2010 (announced early 2011) of sexual abuse of minors and assigned to a life of prayer and penance. [See the Vatican's confidential, five-page ruling on Karadima, published by an investigative news organization in 2015.] In November 2011, Chilean judge Jessica González dismissed the criminal case against Karadima because of the statute of limitations, but she detailed the priest’s abuses in a searing 84-page ruling, calling the allegations \"truthful and reliable.”\n\nKaradima’s crimes had been reported years earlier to his superior, Santiago archbishop (1998-2010) Cardinal Francisco Errázuriz Ossa, P. Schönstatt. In 2003, Errázuriz received a letter from a Karadima victim but did nothing. When told in 2004 of another victim, the cardinal opened an investigation but then suspended it for three years. [See an interview of the priest Eliseo Escudero, who conducted the archdiocese's first investigation of Karadima, from 2004 to 2006.] Karadima himself claimed the archbishop had protected him by paying 500 million pesos to halt a publication of a book alleging that Karadima was a pedophile.\n\nThe cardinal finally sent Karadima's case to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in June 2010, shortly after four victims went public with their story, having received no response to formal complaints they had filed with the church in preceding years.\n\nIn April 2013, Pope Francis appointed Errázuriz to his Council of Cardinals, despite knowing of the cardinal's mismanagement of Karadima.\n\nIn September 2013, three of Karadima’s victims, Dr. James Hamilton, the journalist Juan Carlos Cruz and the president of the Foundation for Trust, José Andrés Murillo, filed a civil suit for 450 million pesos against Errázuriz and the archdiocese, citing the Church's “systematic negligence” and “voluntary blindness.”\n\nAn email correspondence 2013-2014 between Errázuriz and his successor, current Santiago archbishop Ricardo Ezzati Andrello, was leaked to the press in September 2015. The email exchange revealed the archbishops’ joint strategy to prevent Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima’s victims, from becoming a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. Ezzati, in his email to Errázuriz, wrote that Cruz’s appointment to the Commission would be “too threatening to the church of Chile.” Errázuriz later admitted that he had in fact intervened so that Cruz was not named to the Commission.\n\nA news organization also published two letters written by Errázuriz to Karadima and another priest that, according to the plaintiffs, revealed a strategy by the archbishop to conceal allegations and protect Karadima.\n\nA month after the email leak, Errázuriz delivered a 22-page testimony in the civil suit, saying that when he first learned of the accusations against Karadima, he “devalued” them because they “came without evidence.” Also, “there was Karadima’s prestige,” and “it was difficult to assimilate that people who were now adults for years had been abused without reporting it.”\n\nAlso in 2015, Pope Francis selected Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros Madrid to head Chile’s Osorno diocese despite allegations of Barros's complicity in the crimes of Karadima, his former mentor. Three victims attest that Barros witnessed Karadima’s abuse of them, and as secretary to the Santiago archbishop in the early 1980s, Barros allegedly destroyed a letter from parishioners complaining of Karadima's misconduct. In March 2015, hundreds of Osorno Catholics gathered to protest Barros’s appointment. Dozens of priests and deacons of Osorno sent a letter to the Apostolic Nuncio in Chile requesting his removal.\n\nOn March 16, 2017, Chilean justice minister Juan Muñoz Pardo dismissed the victims' 2013 lawsuit against the Santiago archbishopric. In his 291-page ruling, Judge Muñoz wrote that there was insufficient evidence of ‘silencing’ of victims and of cover-up by the archbishopric. He said that Errazuriz had explained his delay in reporting and ‘even asked for forgiveness.’\n\nThe plaintiffs’ attorney, Juan Pablo Hermosilla,\n\nsaid he will appeal the judge’s decision, a process that is almost certain to end in Chile's Supreme Court.\n\nIn May 2017, Karadima was transferred to Hogar San José in Lo Barnechea, run by the female religious of the Santa Teresa Jornet congregation. In September 2017, he was hospitalized with a heart attack.\n\nMons.

In 2013, Labarca was removed as a parish pastor in Bogota, Colombia after being investigated by the Church in 2012 for the sexual abuse of seminarians and children. The church's investigation surfaced evidence that Labarca may have abused minors when he was rector of a Mercedarian school in Concepción.\n\nThe preliminary investigative report sent to the Vatican included witness testimony and accusations involving six other priests of the Order in improper acts possibly including the abuse of minors.\n\nIn April 2017, the Mercedarian Province of Chile stated that Labarca had been removed by Pope Francis from the clerical state and from the congregation, without the right to appeal. The notice cited his \"grave damage to priestly dignity and religious commitments.\"\n\nIn the five years (2011-2016) that the Chilean bishops maintained a public list of clerics found guilty under civil or canon law, Labarca's name was not included.\n\nVaticano aplica medidas cautelares a sacerdote chileno ex superior mundial de la Orden de la Merced acusado de abuso sexual, by Gustavo Villarrubia, CIPER (Centro de Investigación Periodística), 06.14.2013\n\nComunicado Orden de la Merced, Provincia Mercedaria de Chile, 06.14.2013\n\nSacerdote que es investigado por el vaticano por abusos sexuales está \"recluido\" en un convento en Lo Cañas, cambio21.cl, 06.18.2013\n\nVatican Investigates Chilean Bishop for Sex Abuse, sbs.com.au, 02.07.2014\n\nVíctimas chilenas de abusos piden cuentas al Papa sobre obispo acusado de encubrimiento, by Jorge Cancino, Univision.com, 10.08.2015\n\nComunicado de la Provincia Mercedaria de Chile, mercedarios.cl, 04.20.2017\n\nEx Superior mundial Mercedario expulsado por abusos sexuales, reflexionyliberacion.cl, 04.25.2017\n\nIglesia expulsa del clero a sacerdote y ex rector de colegio penquista acusado de abusos, by Cecilia Bastias, biobiochile.cl, 04.25.2017\n\nPapa Francisco expulsa de la Iglesia a sacerdote chileno por su participación en casos de abuso sexual contra menores y ex seminaristas, El Mostrador, 04.26.2017\n\nRev.

Carlos Antonio Larraín Pérez-Cotapos, S.D.B.\n\nPunta Arenas diocese\n\nSantiago archdiocese\n\nPuerto Montt archdiocese\n\nSalesians of Don Bosco/Salesianos de Don Bosco (Salesians)\n\nAccused in 2001 of sexually abusing a nine-year-old girl while director of María Auxiliadora school in Porvenir [Tierra del Fuego Province]. The girl was a student at the school, where Larraín became director in 1996. From 1992-1996, he was a parish priest at Sagrada Familia, a Salesian parish in Macul [Santiago Province]. Prior to that, from 1986 to 1992, he was director of Monseñor Fagnano, a Salesian school in Pueto Natales [Última Esperanza province, Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica region].\n\nIn October 1999, the girl told her mother that Larraín had touched her and hurt her. The mother took her daughter to a hospital to be evaluated by a psychiatrist and pediatric gynecologist, who urged the mother to report the abuse to the National Service for Minors (Sename). The girl detailed the most recent abuse: Larraín called her to his office and, alone behind closed doors, slid his hand beneath her underpants. He warned her that something bad would happen if she told anyone.\n\nA formal complaint against Larraín was presented in April 2001, accusing him of abusing the girl beginning in 1997, when she was seven years old. In September 2001, after the mother of another girl, age eight, accused Larraín of molesting her daughter, he was indicted for \"abusos deshonestos\" against the two minors and removed from his position as director of the school. The two mothers confided to a Salesian priest in Porvenir that they had previously informed bishop Tomás González but that no action was taken. The Porvenir priest, who testified in the case, later revealed in a 2004 interview that, in addition to the two mothers, two fathers, who asked that they not be named because they feared retaliation by the church, told him that their sons had been molested similarly by Larraín.\n\nAfter he was indicted, Larraín spent a night in jail before being released on bail and relocated to Santiago, where he reportedly became director of Casa de Salud, a Salesian home in Macul. Three months later, he was prosecuted for the sexual abuse of the nine-year-old girl in Porvenir. The alleged abuse of the eight-year-old girl was never prosecuted after an appeals court dismissed the complaint.\n\nIn January 2002, Bishop González filed a lawsuit for defamation against the nine-year-old girl's mother, accusing her of \"lying systematically.\" In April 2005, Larraín was absolved in a court of law. The judge also dismissed a 118-million-peso civil suit against the diocese of Punta Arenas and the Salesian Congregation. However, in June 2006, an appeals court overturned the ruling and sentenced Larraín to 300 days in jail. The dismissal of the civil suit was upheld because the statute of limitations had been reached. Finally, in May 2007, the Supreme Court declared Larraín innocent. The Salesians demanded that Larraín’s good name and reputation be publicly restored.\n\nIn March 2012, Larraín was assigned to Cristo Salvador, a Salesian parish in the archdiocese of Puerto Montt, in Puerto Montt [Llanquihue Province]. The archdiocese of Puerto Montt website, last updated in 2015, lists him as parochial vicar.\n\nLarraín was never included on the Chilean bishops' public list of guilty clerics during the five years (2011-2016) it was posted.\n\nPunta Arenas: Procesan a sacerdote por abuso de menores, El Mercurio, 09.26.2001\n\nCorte de Magallanes decide procesar a sacerdote, emol.com, 12.10.2001\n\nObispo González anuncia querella, El Mercurio, 01.30.2002\n\nEscándalo en Porvenir, by Alejandra Matus, alejandramatuls.cl, 04.2002\n\nChile/Pederastia: Procesan a Sacerdote, by Gilberto Villarroel, BBCMundo.com, 10.18.2002\n\nCorte rechaza segundo proceso contra sacerdote, El Mercurio, 03.22.2003\n\nPadre Héctor Berenguela, ex párroco de Porvenir, by Cherie Zalaquett Aquea, recortes.iglesia.cl, 06.03.2004\n\nJusticia absuelve a sacerdote salesiano, by Rolando Martínez, El Mercurio, 04.13.2005\n\nSacerdote Antonio Larraín fue condenado a 300 días de pena remitida por abuso, El Mercurio, 06.29.2006\n\nSalesianos pidieron reparación pública para cura Larraín Pérez-Cotapos, cooperativa.cl, 05.04.2007\n\nLa historia de los sacerdotes cuestionados por abusos sexuales en el Obispado de Punta Arenas, latercera.com, 04.10.2008\n\nConformación Comunidades 2014, salesianos.cl, 12.26.2013\n\nRev.

In 1988, he became rector of Colegio San Mateo in Osorno [Los Lagos Region]. One year into his six-year term as rector, he was removed due to inappropriate conduct.\n\nThe Provincial Superior of the Jesuits said that Leturia's exit \"had to do with alcohol, various incidents, and an indirect complaint from a family. I don't recall the details, but a father said something or other about sexual conduct with a boy, and that was the impetus for him [Leturia] leaving the school a few days later.\"\n\nLeturia soon returned to ministry. Beginning in the early 1990s, he worked at Colegio San Ignacio El Bosque in Santiago, where he taught and was a spiritual adviser. In 1997, the Jesuits sent him to the United States for treatment, ostensibly for his alcoholism.
