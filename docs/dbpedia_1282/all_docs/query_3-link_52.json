        "text": "Concepcion, Chile – 30 May 2023 – The Vicar of the Rector Major, Fr Stefano Martoglio, visited the Salesians in Concepcion and blessed the St Dominic Savio Hall. The occasion was enthusiastically welcomed by community representatives and student councils. The event began with a warm greeting from the Rector, Fr Claudio Cartes, the Principal, Ida Sepúlveda, and the President of the Student Centre, Patricio Báez. During the reception Fr Martoglio was introduced to the rich history of the school and to the objectives of the educational project that, for more than a century, has formed young people committed to the service of the region and the country in different social areas. The Vicar of the Rector Major addressed a few words to the community, highlighting the fundamental aspects of the Preventive System and its implementation in over 135 countries around the world where Salesians form young people to service, thus contributing to the construction of a society that honours human dignity. He encouraged young people to continue to demonstrate their qualities in an environment that has always maintained a strong sense of belonging and a Salesian identity. Then Fr Martoglio proceeded to bless the St Dominic Savio Hall which will be available for meetings of teachers and families, and was honoured with a commemorative plaque. Before concluding the blessing, the community gave the Vicar of the Rector Major the school's medal of honour on which are engraved the insignia and the motto “ora et labora”, symbols that identify the life of the institute."
