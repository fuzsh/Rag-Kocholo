        "text": "This beautifully written book is a model of how to weave the social and political histories of Catholic priests and the communities in which they lived during the last two centuries in Argentina. María Elena Barral, also author of De sotanas por la Pampa. Religión y sociedad en el Buenos Aires tardocolonial, is a leading representative of the renovation of the scholarship on the Catholic Church in Argentina. Curas con los pies en la tierra focuses on how local communities forged bonds with their priests, the Catholic Church, and Catholicism, according to the political context of each era. Even though the book examines historical ways to be a “cura” (priest) by providing biographies of ten priests from the eighteenth century to the present, the core thread of this work shows how parishioners mobilized, politically and socially, their priests. Rather than Catholic priests predominantly marshaling people into political developments, the vignettes that populate this book shed light on how leaders (the priests) were led or followed predominant (among their parishioners) feelings and demands. This story from below does not “turn” social history into politics or vice versa, but as the “feligreses” (parishioners) are the subject of this book, their own categories blend both aspects according to how they culturally understood their relationships with priests.\n\nIn 1980 a group of Chilean exiled historians and history students in the UK formed an Association and an academic journal, Nueva Historia, which was published throughout the eighties, generating a total of 17 issues until 1989. Taking advantage of resources found in Britain (a tranquil working place, intellectual companionship, material help in the form of libraries, financial support and psychological and intellectual distance) they decided to question prevailing ways of thinking and writing history back home. The result was a social history grounded in empirical research that used conceptual tools borrowed from the social sciences. However, rather than a carefree adoption of European historiographical trends, this was a sustained effort to contribute to the historiographical needs of their country. Upon their return to Chile, the students in question have continued with the task of developing a new kind of social history. Unfortunately, some of the main principles developed in the UK have been now left behind.\n\nIn this paper I focus on the historiographical fate of Francisco Suárez (1548-1617) and Pedro da Fonseca (1528-1599) in two Iberian journals ran by Jesuits and founded in 1945: the Spanish Pensamiento, and the Portuguese Revista portuguesa de filosofia. I endeavor to show that the discussions of Suárez's and Fonseca's ideas on these journal is a twosided case of constructing the legacies of major figures in late scholasticism, and I emphasize how the demand to identify cultural national heroes intertwines with theoretical and ideological elements, especially the peculiar history of the Iberian Peninsula, and to the historical relationships between Spain and Portugal. With regard to Suárez, the Pensamiento group strives to carve out a specific place for Neo-Suarezianism within Neo-Thomism, also via a substantive reassessment of Suárez's importance in the history of scholasticism and of philosophy in general. Hence, Suárez's thought undergoes triumphant reevaluation, which even aims at ousting Aquinas as the ultimate reference of scholasticism, to make Suárez's Thomism the principal authority of contemporary schools. By contrast, Fonseca remains a rather obscure and neglected figure, dug up by his fellow compatriots on the Revista portuguesa de filosofia, also against this attempt at establishing a Suarezian, Spanish hegemony."
