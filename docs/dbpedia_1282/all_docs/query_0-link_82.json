Lobato\n\nLobato, Nicolau dos Reis (b. 1952, Bazartete, western Portuguese Timor [now Timor-Leste] - d. Dec. 31, 1978, near Dare Mulo, East Timor), East Timorese leader. In May 1974, one month after the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, which triggered the decolonization process, he helped form a political party called the Timorese Social Democratic Association, which in September 1975 became the Revolutionary Front of Independent East Timor (Fretilin). In mid-1975 he went overseas on a diplomatic mission, and in August he played the leading role in the defeat of the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) in the civil war. At this stage he was vice-president of Fretilin, but because of his leadership in the war he became the real leader of Fretilin, although its president, Francisco Xavier do Amaral, continued to be respected. During the period of Fretilin administration in East Timor (September-December 1975) he endeavoured to establish a farmers cooperative in his home region. When Fretilin formed the Democratic Republic of East Timor on Nov. 28, 1975, he became prime minister, with Amaral as president. His wife Isobel was shot on the Dili wharf on the first day (Dec. 7, 1975) of the Indonesian invasion. For the next three years he was the military and, for the most part, the political leader of the Timorese resistance in the mountains. His position as military commander was confirmed at the Fretilin congress at Soibada in May 1976, and later, after the arrest of Amaral in September 1978, he became the president. When Timorese fortunes were at their lowest after the Operation Encirclement, he was shot in the leg by Indonesian forces. Rather than being taken prisoner, he said \"my last bullet is my victory\" before shooting himself dead. For the Timorese, both his Fretilin followers and even those who had previously been UDT or Apodeti, he became a folk hero.\n\nLobato, Raymundo Felippe (b. 1798, Alcântara, Maranhão, Brazil - d.

Dec. 23, 1943), governor of Hedemarkens amt/Hedmark fylke (1916-26); brother of Einar Løchen.\n\nLocher, Ralph S(idney) (b. July 24, 1915, Romania - d. June 18, 2004, Beachwood, Ohio), mayor of Cleveland (1962-67). He was the city's law director when he was thrust into the mayor's job after Pres. John F. Kennedy appointed Mayor Anthony J. Celebrezze to a federal cabinet post in 1962. Locher immediately faced a special election to remain mayor. Although he was thought to be a mild-mannered technician without political skills, he swamped his opposition so decisively that he was unopposed when he ran for a full term the next year. However, he was not prepared to deal with the heightened black consciousness of the 1960s. His administration became beleaguered before he was defeated by Carl B. Stokes in 1967. Locher was elected a probate judge in 1972 and an Ohio Supreme Court justice in 1976, retiring from the bench on Dec. 31, 1988.\n\nLocke\n\nLocke, Gary (Faye) (b. Jan. 21, 1950, Seattle, Wash.), governor of Washington (1997-2005). A son of Chinese immigrants, he seems to have cultivated a Chinese name, Luo Jiahui. He was elected to the state House in 1982 and rose to chair the Appropriations Committee; he supported an income tax and the 1993 tax increases that helped to make Democratic governor Mike Lowry unpopular. That same year, Locke was elected executive of the state's largest county, King, which includes Seattle. In February 1996 Lowry announced his retirement and Locke decided to run for governor. He supported gay and abortion rights and portrayed himself as tough on crime and fiscally moderate. It was a crowded field in an all-party primary. Locke won with 24% of the vote over his Democratic rivals, Seattle mayor Norm Rice (18%) and Jay Inslee (10%). The Republican field was more fragmented, and the nomination was won by former state Senate leader Ellen Craswell, who was an ardent foe of abortion, called homosexuality sinful, and vowed to fill government with \"godly\" people. She promised to cut state taxes 30% (later modified to 15%), slice government spending, and privatize state universities. Locke won 58%-42%. He became the first Chinese-American governor in the U.S. and the first Asian-American to be elected governor outside Hawaii. Washington's Asian population was less than 6%. His Republican opponent in 2000 was radio talk show host John Carlson, who called for lower taxes, a new bridge to Portland, and more teachers. But voters were in a pro-incumbent mood, and Locke won 58%-40%. In December 2002 he became chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and in January 2003 he delivered the Democratic response to George W. Bush's State of the Union address. On July 21, 2003, he announced he would not seek a third term. He was U.S. commerce secretary in 2009-11 and ambassador to China in 2011-14.\n\nLockhart, Sir James Haldane Stewart (b.

Sept. 2, 1778, Ajaccio, Corsica [now in France] - d. July 25, 1846, Livorno, Tuscany [now in Italy]), king of Holland (1806-10); brother of José I Napoleón, Napoléon I, and Lucien Bonaparte.\n\nH.C. Lodge\n\nLodge, Henry Cabot (b. May 12, 1850, Boston, Mass. - d. Nov. 9, 1924, Cambridge, Mass.), U.S. politician. A Republican, he began his political career in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1880-81) and later was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1887-93) and of the U.S. Senate (1893-1924). He became an implacable foe of Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic president of 1913-21. After the U.S. entered World War I (1917), he called for united support of the war effort. After the armistice, however, his opposition flamed up anew. Though he initially endorsed an international peacekeeping mechanism, he opposed the idea of a world organization with compulsory arbitration as advocated by Wilson. He maintained that there were matters, as touching the Monroe Doctrine, the Panama Canal tolls, or Asiatic immigration, which the U.S. could never consent to submit to arbitration. In the 1918 elections the Republicans gained control of the Senate, and he became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. It was largely his leadership and tenacity which prevented the U.S. adoption of the Treaty of Versailles, including the League of Nations covenant. On the one hand, he used delaying tactics to allow enthusiasm for the League to wane; on the other, he introduced a series of amendments (the Lodge reservations) that would require the approval of Congress before the U.S. would be bound by certain League decisions. Wilson refused to accept the reservations, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. The landslide victory of Republican Warren G. Harding in the 1920 presidential election was considered a vindication of Lodge's position. He went on to serve as one of four U.S. delegates to the Washington Conference on the Limitation of Armaments (1921).\n\nH.C. Lodge\n\nLodge, Henry Cabot (b. July 5, 1902, Nahant, Mass. - d. Feb. 27, 1985, Beverly, Mass.), U.S. politician; grandson of Henry Cabot Lodge (1850-1924); great-great-grandson of John Davis. In 1932 he was elected to the Massachusetts legislature, and four years later to the U.S. Senate, defeating Boston Mayor James M. Curley. He resigned in February 1944 to go on active duty with the U.S. Army, and saw combat in North Africa and Italy. Reelected to the Senate in 1946, he lost his seat in 1952 to Rep. John F. Kennedy. In that year he had been active in promoting the presidential candidacy of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who subsequently appointed Lodge permanent representative to the United Nations (1953-60). His principal tasks in the UN during 1953 and 1954 were to counter Soviet propaganda and attempts to split the Western powers and to combat the continued efforts of the Soviet bloc to secure admission of Communist China to the UN. Much of his time during 1955-56 was spent on efforts to secure release of 11 U.S. airmen imprisoned by China as \"spies,\" to persuade the U.S.S.R. to participate in a world atomic energy pool for peaceful purposes, and to present the U.S. view before the UN subcommittee on disarmament. In 1957 he turned his attention to UN debates over administration of the Suez Canal and to the proposed censure of the U.S.S.R. for its suppression of the Hungarian revolt of 1956. He became something of a television idol and in July 1960 he was nominated vice presidential candidate on the unsuccessful Republican ticket headed by Richard M. Nixon. He served as U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam (1963-64, 1965-67), ambassador at large (1967-68), ambassador to West Germany (1968-69), chief negotiator at the Vietnam peace talks in Paris (1969), and special envoy to the Vatican (1970-77).\n\nLodge, John Davis (b.

He was defense minister (1956, 1958, 1959-66), deputy premier (1963-66), and premier (1966-67), resigning after a serious car accident left him hospitalized for several months. He returned to the cabinet as defense minister in 1968 and one year later regained the premiership, also keeping the defense portfolio until 1971. He was a prime architect of the March 1970 coup that overthrew Norodom Sihanouk as head of state. Abandoning Sihanouk's policy of neutrality in the Indochina war, he established close ties with the United States and South Vietnam, permitting their forces to operate on Cambodian territory. The U.S. bombing raids against Vietcong bases in Cambodia resulted in growing alienation of the peasants, and the Communist Khmer Rouge grew from about 3,000 guerrillas to 30,000. After a heart attack in 1971 he resigned (and was raised to the rank of marshal), but it was decided that he should remain titular premier, and he soon took full power again. In March 1972, he installed himself as president. On April 1, 1975, with Khmer Rouge insurgents only a few miles from the capital, he left the country. He lived first in Hawaii but moved to California in 1979.\n\nLonardi\n\nLonardi (Doucet), Eduardo (Ernesto) (b. Sept. 15, 1896, Buenos Aires - d. March 22, 1956, Buenos Aires), provisional president of Argentina (1955). He entered the Argentine Military College in 1914 and was commissioned in the Horse Artillery. In 1938 he was sent to Chile as military attaché. In 1947 he went to Washington with the rank of colonel to serve as military attaché and representative on the Inter-American Defense Board. He remained in the U.S. for nine months, returning to Argentina to command the Third Army, a post he held until he was forced to retire in September 1951. He spent much of the next four years in cautious conspiracy to overthrow the regime of Juan Perón. In December 1951 he was jailed for eight months in connection with the abortive effort of a disgruntled general to topple the government. In 1952 he was accused of complicity in a plot to assassinate Perón but escaped imprisonment. A year later he was again confronted in another roundup but escaped arrest. An attempt to seize the government in June 1955 failed because of lack of coordination between the Navy and Army organizations. But General Lonardi continued preparations, and on September 16, he broadcast a proclamation from Córdoba identifying himself as \"chief of the forces of liberation.\" A week later he arrived in Buenos Aires to take over as provisional president. He often referred to the moral and material collapse of Argentina under Perón's dictatorship and said that his government's aim was to restore \"the sentiment of decency in the country.\" After two months he was overthrown in a palace coup, being accused by the ruling military junta of having favoured right-wing \"undemocratic\" politicians.\n\nLoncar, Budimir (b.

Aug. 30, 1893, Winnfield, Winn parish, La. - d. Sept. 10, 1935, Baton Rouge, La.), governor of Louisiana (1928-32). Methodically planning a political career by way of a secondary state office, he won election to the state railroad commission in 1918. Styling himself as an advocate for the poor and rural folk of Louisiana, he ran for governor in 1924 and lost, but won in 1928 and proceeded to build one of the most effective political machines in U.S. history. He became legendary for his political rhetoric. He was popular with poor white voters for his programme of social and economic reform, which reduced the impact of the Depression upon the state. He was elected Democratic senator for Louisiana in 1930, but, in order to prevent the lieutenant governor Paul Cyr from succeeding him, he only left the governor's post for the Senate in 1932. At first a supporter of the New Deal and Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, he became a significant critic of the president. Long's \"Share Our Wealth\" scheme called for a massive redistribution of wealth through high inheritance taxes and confiscatory taxes on high incomes. His own extravagance - including the state capitol building at Baton Rouge, built of bronze and marble - was widely criticized. Although he became a virtual dictator in the state, his slogan was \"Every man a king, but no man wears a crown.\" He was fatally shot at the capitol in Baton Rouge on Sept. 8, 1935, one month after announcing his intention to run for the presidency. His brother Earl K. Long went on to serve several times as governor, while his son Russell B. Long served in the Senate from 1948 to 1987.\n\nLong, John D(avis) (b.

March 12, 1925, Beijing, China), military governor (1913-16) and civil governor (1913, 1915-16) of Guangdong. He was the brother of Long Jinguang and son of a tribal chief in Yunnan. He was a brigade commander in the Qing dynasty. During the \"Second Revolution\" (1913) against Yuan Shikai, he followed Yuan's orders and occupied the city of Guangzhou, which contributed to the failure of the revolutionaries, who basically stayed in the south. For a long time he was Yuan's strong supporter in the revolutionary-minded south. He gained the trust of Duan Qirui after Yuan's death and offered to stay on Hainan island. In 1917, he tried to launch an attack on the southern government led by Sun Yat-sen, but failed. He then left politics.\n\nLong Jinguang (b. 1863, Mengzi, Yunnan, China - d. Aug. 7, 1917, Beijing, China), civil governor of Yunnan (1916). He was the younger brother of Long Jiguang and the son of a tribal chief in southern Yunnan. He served in both the Yunnan Army and the Guangxi Army during his early days. He became commander of the 1st Division of the Guangdong Army, which was controlled by the Yunnan Army after the latter made its way to Guangdong. His forces, as well as those of his elder brother, supported Yuan Shikai's imperial reign, and exchanged fire with Cai E's anti-Yuan \"Salvation Army\" in Yunnan in 1916. He was subsequently detained by Guangxi governor Lu Rongting and went to Beijing after being freed.\n\nLong Yun\n\nLong Yun (b. Nov. 19, 1884, Zhaotong, Yunnan, China - d. June 27, 1962, Beijing, China), chairman of the government of Yunnan (1927-45). He served in Tang Jiyao's Yunnan Army for years until 1927, when he, together with Hu Ruoyu, launched a coup and expelled Tang from office. Soon after that he became the 38th Army commander within the National Revolutionary Army, at the same time continuing as Yunnan chairman for more than a decade. During World War II, he was nominated as commander-in-chief of the 1st Army Group, fighting against the Japanese in his province. Nicknamed \"King of Yunnan,\" Long enjoyed significant prestige in his province, and Chiang Kai-shek became suspicious that Yunnan might slip out of his control. In 1945, Long was sacked by Chiang as Yunnan chairman and recalled to the capital. Chiang gave him a powerless post of deputy director of the \"Committee of Strategic Advisers,\" thus putting him under \"house arrest.\" Long fled to Hong Kong at the end of 1948 and joined the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (KMT-RC, a KMT anti-Chiang organization which became the largest \"democratic party\" under the Communist Party's leadership after the founding of the People's Republic). In August 1949, he declared his revolt against Chiang together with Huang Shaohong in Hong Kong. After the Communist victory he became vice-chairman of the National Defense Committee and vice-chairman of the Administrative Council of Southwestern China. He was also vice-chairman of the KMT-RC. He was determined a \"rightist\" by the government in 1957 (posthumously rehabilitated in 1980).\n\nLongaric\n\nLongaric (Rodríguez), Karen (b.

Dec. 5, 1905, London, England - d. Aug. 3, 2001, London), British politician. He was the second son of the 5th Earl of Longford and great-great-grandson of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. He was created 1st Baron Pakenham in 1945 and succeeded to the Irish earldom (and the barony of Silchester) in 1961, when his elder brother died. He was a passionate social reformer and champion of society's outcasts. Born and brought up a Protestant aristocrat and Conservative, he ended up a Socialist, a Roman Catholic, and an Irish Nationalist. His persistent crusades overshadowed his political career, and in later years it was largely forgotten that he had served as leader of the House of Lords (1964-68) and had held other ministerial posts, among them undersecretary at the War Office (1946-47), chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1947-48), minister of civil aviation (1948-51), first lord of the admiralty (1951), lord privy seal (1964-65, 1966-68), and colonial secretary (1965-66). He opposed the appeasement of Adolf Hitler before World War II and worked on social reforms that led to the creation of Britain's welfare state. He chaired a committee that in 1963 proposed state compensation for victims of violent crime. He was most noted, however, for his prison reform campaign, and particularly for arguing that one of Britain's most notorious modern criminals, child killer Myra Hindley, should be paroled. Lord Longford was made a Knight of the Garter in 1972. In 1999 he was created a life peer as Baron Pakenham of Cowley, allowing him to continue to sit in the House of Lords when hereditary peers lost their right to do so.\n\nLongino, Andrew H(ouston) (b.

In 1919 he joined the Italian Socialist Party but in 1921 he was one of those who broke away to found the Italian Communist Party (PCI). He struggled against Italian Fascism - being arrested for the first time in 1923 for his political activity in Turin and being assaulted and badly beaten by Fascists at Reggio Emilia in 1924 - until Benito Mussolini's ban on political parties forced him into exile. He continued the struggle among Italian refugees in France, Switzerland, and at Moscow, where he represented the PCI in the executive committee of the Communist International in 1932-34. In 1936 he became a political inspector of the international brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was arrested in France in 1939 and sent back to Italy, where he was interned. Released in 1943, he became deputy commander of the Italian partisan military organization, winning the U.S. Bronze Star for his contribution to the Allied war effort. After the war, he became deputy secretary of the PCI. Knowing his loyalty to the Soviet Union, many were surprised when he was chosen in 1964 to succeed Palmiro Togliatti as secretary-general of the most independent of the European Communist parties. But he proved to be a firm supporter of the \"Italian road to socialism\" and denounced the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968. After his retirement in 1972, he became party president, an honorary post. He continued to support the diversity of roads to socialism (as in an article he was allowed to contribute to Pravda in 1977), but he expressed misgivings about the \"historic compromise\" with non-Communist political parties, a policy pursued by his successor, Enrico Berlinguer.\n\nLongrigg, Stephen Hemsley (b.

Four years later he won the race for Lisbon's mayor, a post he held until he was appointed prime minister in July 2004, replacing José Manuel Durão Barroso who resigned to become European Commission president. His first five months in office were marked by delays in the start of the school year, accusations of government interference in the media, a downgrading of the credit outlook given by ratings agency Standard & Poor's, and the angry resignation of a minister. Then in December Pres. Jorge Sampaio called early elections for February 2005, and Lopes resigned, remaining in a caretaker capacity until the elections, which were won by the Socialist Party. Lopes then resigned as party president and briefly returned as mayor of Lisbon (March-September 2005).\n\nLopes, Tarquinio (Brazileiro) (b. June 30, 1848, São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil - d. Nov. 4, 1911), acting president of Maranhão (1891).\n\nLópez (Hernández), Adán Augusto (b. Sept. 24, 1963, Paraíso, Tabasco, Mexico), governor of Tabasco (2019-21) and interior minister of Mexico (2021-23).\n\nLópez (Benítez), Benigno (María) (b. July 6, 1961, Asunción, Paraguay), finance minister of Paraguay (2018-20).\n\nLópez (Ynsfrán), Carlos Antonio (b. Nov. 4, 1790, Asunción, Río de la Plata [now in Paraguay] - d. Sept. 10, 1862, Asunción), joint consul of the republic (1841-44) and president (1844-62) of Paraguay. He left Asunción after falling out of favour with the regime of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, but soon after the dictator's death, López was chosen by the Congress to rule alongside Mariano Roque Alonzo. In 1844, he had himself elected president and ruled with dictatorial powers for the next 18 years. He devoted his regime to modernizing Paraguay, as well as to building his own private fortune. As the national economy grew, so too did López's landholdings and profits from regulated industries. Despite his personal corruption, he did oversee some notable achievements in Paraguay, such as the construction of roads and the first telegraph lines. He also devoted considerable resources to improving the education system and equipping the national military. He eased the trade and diplomatic restrictions that had been in place under Francia, and Paraguay gradually became embroiled in the thorny foreign affairs that had long plagued Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay; disputes with Brazil, Britain, and the United States nearly resulted in war, but each time he succeeded in extricating himself by skillful evasions. Like his predecessor, he achieved progress at the expense of personal liberties. He officially abolished slavery and torture, though both were still prevalent at his death. He oversaw the drafting of a constitution in 1844 that gave the executive extraordinary powers and allowed him to name his successor. He died in office and was succeeded by his son Francisco Solano López.\n\nLopez, Fernando (Hofileña) (b. April 13, 1904, Jaro, Iloilo, Philippines - d. May 26, 1993, Manila, Philippines), vice president of the Philippines (1949-53, 1965-72). He was also mayor of Iloilo (1945-47), secretary of agriculture and natural resources (1950-53, 1965-71), and president pro tempore of the Senate (1958-65).\n\nF.S. López\n\nLópez (Carrillo), Francisco Solano (b. July 24, 1827, Asunción, Paraguay - d. March 1, 1870, Cerro Corá [now in Amambay department]), president of Paraguay (1862-69). The eldest son of the dictator Carlos Antonio López, he was made a brigadier general at the age of 18. Upon his father's death (Sept. 10, 1862) he seized power and quickly fortified it with the help of the army. His Irish mistress, Elisa Alicia Lynch, became a person of enormous influence in Paraguay. Vastly overrating Paraguay's military potential and underestimating its two giant neighbours, Brazil and Argentina, he in 1863 allowed himself to be drawn into boundary disputes with both countries and into a civil war raging in Uruguay in which Brazil and Argentina were involved. He may have hoped to play the role of arbitrator in the dispute and thereby take centre stage in Latin American politics, but as a result of complicated diplomatic intrigues, he found himself at war with Brazil in December 1864. By demanding the right to place troops in the Argentine province of Corrientes, violating Argentina's desire to remain neutral, he provoked the Triple Alliance of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay against Paraguay on May 1, 1865. Although he had successfully invaded Brazil's Mato Grosso province in late 1864, his invasion of Uruguay in 1865 was a disaster. The allies defeated him at Tuyutí in May 1866 and captured the fortress of Humaitá in July 1867. In January 1869 he was forced to withdraw into northern Paraguay, where he held out for another fourteen months until he was routed and, after refusing to surrender, was killed. While some saw him as a paranoid megalomaniac who wanted to become South America's Napoléon, he was later also regarded as a hero who resisted Argentine and Brazilian designs on Paraguay.\n\nLópez, Germán (Osvaldo) (b. Nov. 30, 1918, Buenos Aires, Argentina - d. Sept. 13, 1989, Buenos Aires), defense minister of Argentina (1986).\n\nLópez, Hermógenes (b. April 19, 1830, Naguanagua, Carabobo, Venezuela - d. Dec. 17, 1898, Valencia, Carabobo), governor of Carabobo (1867, 1867-68, 1880-81, 1882-84, 1888-89) and acting president of Venezuela (1887-88).\n\nLópez (y López), Joaquín María (b. Aug. 15, 1798, Villena [now in Alicante province], Spain - d. Nov. 14, 1855, Madrid, Spain), prime minister of Spain (1843, 1843). He was also minister of interior (1836-37) and justice (1843, 1843).\n\nLópez (Valdés), José Hilario (b. Feb. 18, 1798, Popayán, New Granada [now in Colombia] - d.

May 27, 1911, Currimao, Ilocos Norte province, Philippines - d. Oct. 18, 1993), foreign secretary of the Philippines (1963-64). He was also minister (1955-56) and ambassador (1956-62) to France, minister to Belgium and the Netherlands (1955-59), Switzerland (1957-58), and Portugal (1959-62), permanent representative to the United Nations (1964-68, 1986-87), and ambassador to the United States (1968-69).\n\nLópez Agràs, Pere (b.

He has been secretary-general of National Solidarity (2019-20) and president of Popular Renewal (2020- ).\n\nLópez Arellano\n\nLópez Arellano, Oswaldo (Enrique) (b. June 30, 1921, Danli, Honduras - d. May 16, 2010, Tegucigalpa, Honduras), head of state of Honduras (1963-71, 1972-75). He became defense minister and head of the armed forces in 1956, was a member of the ruling Military Government Council in 1957, and was promoted to colonel in 1958. He ousted Pres. Ramón Villeda Morales in a violent coup in 1963 and two years later held a constitutional assembly that formalized his position as president of Honduras, then a banana-producing country under the sway of Washington. He reversed some of Villeda's liberal economic policies, but faced workers' unrest and agitation for agrarian reform. His decision to repatriate Salvadoran immigrants, in an effort to reduce population pressure, precipitated a short but bloody war with El Salvador in 1969; known as the \"Soccer War,\" it broke out after teams from the two nations played World Cup qualifying matches that saw opposing supporters beaten or killed. He remained in power until 1971, when he was constitutionally debarred from standing for reelection. He then backed Ramón Ernesto Cruz Uclés, like himself of the National Party, who won the election. Remaining head of the armed forces, in 1972 he toppled Cruz in another military coup. He was himself ousted by the armed forces in 1975 after dissident officers accused him of receiving a $2.5 million bribe they said U.S. banana company United Brands offered to reduce a banana export tax.\n\nLópez Arias, Fernando (b. Aug. 8, 1905, Suchilapan, Veracruz, Mexico - d. July 3, 1978, Mexico City, Mexico), governor of Veracruz (1962-68). He was also Mexican attorney general (1958-62).\n\nLópez Arias, Óscar (Andrés) (b. Feb. 17, 1971, Curridabat, San José province, Costa Rica), Costa Rican politician. He was a minor presidential candidate (2010, 2014, 2018, 2022).\n\nLópez Bravo (y Castro), Gregorio (b. Dec. 19, 1923, Madrid, Spain - d. Feb. 19, 1985, near Bilbao, Spain), Spanish politician. In 1959 he was appointed director general of the Department of Trade within the Ministry of Commerce. In line with the policy adopted by Francisco Franco in the 1950s, he opposed doctrinaire Falangist economic nationalism and advocated contemporary European and American management and industrial methods. In 1960 he became head of the Institute of Foreign Currency in the Ministry of Finance. As minister of industry (1962-69) he encouraged private investment and laid the foundations for the rapid economic growth of that period. As foreign minister (1969-73) he continued the policies of his predecessor, José María Castiella. He travelled widely (becoming known as \"Señor Barajas\" after Madrid's airport) in an attempt to develop Spain's diplomatic and trade links with Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Arab states. An early success was the establishment of relations with the Soviet Union at permanent trade mission level. His eventual removal from office was attributed to his failure to extract from Britain any promises regarding the future status of Gibraltar. He was severely criticized for his decision to withdraw the Gibraltar issue from the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, in order to save Britain embarrassment, and when he nevertheless returned empty-handed from his fourth meeting with British foreign secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home (May 1973). After Franco's death (1975) he was a member (1977-79) of the Cortes (parliament) elected under the Political Reform Law. He was killed in an air crash.\n\nLópez Caballero, Alfonso (b. Aug. 17, 1944, Bogotá, Colombia), Colombian politician; son of Alfonso López Michelsen. He served as agriculture minister in 1991-93 but was forced to quit in a scandal over oil rights on land he owned in Casanare province. López and other landowners sought government compensation for the exploitation of oil reserves under their property, despite provisions in the constitution placing oil and mineral rights in state hands. He stepped down after accusations that he had tried to gain personal benefit from his ministerial position and from his status as son of a former president. He served as interior minister from January to August 1998 and was also ambassador to France (1990-91), Canada (1994-98), the United Kingdom (2002-06), and Russia (2016-21).\n\nLópez Callejas, Ricardo, interior minister (1926-28) and finance minister (1928-29) of Nicaragua.\n\nLópez Chávarri\n\nLópez Chávarri, Mario (Juvenal) (b.

May 5, 1924, San Andrés de Sotavento, Córdoba, Colombia - d. July 7, 2015, Bogotá, Colombia), justice minister of Colombia (1987). He was also president of the Senate (1976-77), ambassador to the Soviet Union (1983-85), Yugoslavia (1988-92), and the Dominican Republic (1994-96), and minister of communications (1986-87).\n\nLópez Guevara, Carlos Alfredo (b.

Aug. 18, 1978, Caracas, Venezuela), defense minister of Venezuela (1958-61).\n\nLópez Leyton, Raúl, interior and justice minister of Bolivia (1978-79). He was also army commander (1984-85) and commander-in-chief of the armed forces (1985-87).\n\nLópez López, Ancízar (b. May 25, 1926, Montenegro, Caldas [now in Quindío], Colombia - d. c. March 2003, Colombia), Colombian politician. He was mayor of Armenia (1958-59), governor of Quindío (1966-69), and president of the Senate (1987-89). He was abducted by ELN guerrillas on April 11, 2002, and died in their captivity; his remains were returned on Sept. 6, 2005.\n\nLópez Mateos\n\nLópez Mateos, Adolfo (b. May 26, 1910, Atizapán de Zaragoza [now Ciudad López Mateos], México state, Mexico - d. Sept. 22, 1969, Mexico City, Mexico), president of Mexico (1958-64). He entered politics in 1929, first as a socialist, then as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was elected senator for the state of México in 1946. He became campaign manager for Adolfo Ruiz Cortines in the presidential campaign of 1951-52. Ruiz Cortines named him secretary-general of the PRI and later included him in his cabinet as minister of labour and social security. He showed conciliatory talents - there were no serious strikes during his term of office - and helped draft the U.S.-Mexico migrant-labour treaty. He was chosen as the PRI candidate for the presidency in November 1957 and was elected president on July 6, 1958, by an approximate margin of 10 to 1 over his opponent, Luis H. Álvarez. The presidential election was the first in which women could vote. His election had been a certainty, since no presidential candidate of the PRI had been defeated in decades. Leading the country during the time Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba and when many Mexicans asked whether their own revolution of the 1910s had not been betrayed, he needed to walk a tightrope between the vociferous left wing with Communist sympathies and the right who were determined to cling to their fortunes. Some of his left-wing declarations, clearly intended for home consumption, aroused near-panic reaction in the U.S., leading to large-scale flights of capital, but he later conciliated the businessmen, though he refused to modify his policies of continued agrarian reforms and resisted pressure from the U.S. to take an actively hostile attitude to Castro's government.\n\nLópez Maya, Alexander (b. June 26, 1967, Cali, Colombia), Colombian politician. He was president of the Senate (2023).\n\nLópez Michelsen\n\nLópez Michelsen, Alfonso (Antonio Lázaro) (b. June 30, 1913, Bogotá, Colombia - d. July 11, 2007, Bogotá), president of Colombia (1974-78); son of Alfonso López Pumarejo. Returning to Colombia from voluntary exile in Mexico in 1958, he organized a new party of dissident Liberals, the Liberal Revolutionary Movement (MRL), to oppose the National Front, the coalition of the two major established parties, the Liberals and Conservatives. Established in 1957 to end a decade of violent civil strife, the National Front pact had guaranteed the peaceful alternation of presidential terms between the two parties, thereby, in López' opinion, stifling any real political competition and leadership. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 1962 but gained a seat in the Senate, to which he was reelected in 1966. In 1967 he made peace with the orthodox Liberal Party leadership and, returning to the fold, was appointed governor of the new department of César by Pres. Carlos Lleras Restrepo. In August 1968 he became foreign minister, serving until 1970; he formed closer ties with the Soviet Union and worked for better relations with other Latin American countries. In 1974 the termination of the National Front agreement restored competitive presidential elections, and he soundly defeated Conservative Álvaro Gómez Hurtado. A provisional extension of the pact, however, required the president to form a cabinet made up of equal numbers of Liberals and Conservatives. He took steps to curb inflation, raised taxes on high incomes, and eliminated price subsidies. But there was a rise in unemployment, leading to a surge in labour unrest, land seizures by peasants, and guerrilla activity, moving him to declare a state of siege in 1975. He lost the 1982 presidential election to Conservative Belisario Betancur Cuartas.\n\nLópez Montaño, Cecilia (Matilde) (b. April 18, 1943, Barranquilla, Colombia), Colombian politician. She was ambassador to the Netherlands (1985-88), minister of environment (1994-95) and agriculture and rural development (1995-97), and director of the National Planning Department (1997-98).\n\nLópez Moreno, José (Antonio) (b. Dec. 13, 1936, Havana, Cuba), a vice premier of Cuba (1979-88). He was also minister of construction (1976-85) and president of the Central Planning Board (1985-88).\n\nLópez Muñoz, Antonio López Muñoz, conde de (b. April 1, 1849, Huelva, Spain - d. March 15, 1929, Madrid, Spain), foreign minister of Spain (1913). He was also minister of education and fine arts (1912-13) and justice (1923) and minister to Portugal (1915-17). He was created count in 1920.\n\nLópez Murphy, Ricardo (Hipólito) (b. Aug. 10, 1951, Buenos Aires), defense minister of Argentina (1999-2001). He was also economy minister (2001) and a presidential candidate (2003).\n\nLópez Nogales, Armando (b. Sept. 1, 1950, Cananea, Sonora, Mexico), governor of Sonora (1997-2003).\n\nLópez Obrador\n\nLópez Obrador, Andrés Manuel (\"AMLO\") (b. Nov. 13, 1953, Tepetitán, Macuspana municipality, Tabasco state, Mexico), president of Mexico (2018- ). In the 1960s he joined the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), but by 1988 he and other dissenters were accusing the party of betraying the poor and soon formed the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). He became the PRD leader in Tabasco and ran for governor in 1994. Losing to the PRI candidate, he claimed fraud and launched a protest campaign which helped propel him to national prominence. In 2000, he won election as chief of government of the Distrito Federal (mayor of Mexico City). Hundreds of thousands of his supporters protested weekly after the Mexican Congress voted on April 7, 2005, to strip him of his immunity from prosecution. Mexico's attorney general's office filed contempt of court charges against López Obrador on April 20, on allegations he disobeyed a court order to halt the construction of a road in 2001. López Obrador said the case against him was politically motivated, to prevent him from running for president. A court later sent back the charges, and Pres. Vicente Fox retreated by replacing the attorney general and ordering a review; the new attorney general dropped the case on May 4. On July 29 López Obrador resigned to run for the PRD presidential nomination, which he obtained in September. In the presidential election of July 2006, he was defeated by less than a percentage point by Felipe Calderón of the governing National Action Party. He claimed he was the victim of fraud, and his supporters engaged in massive protests, blocking the central boulevard of Mexico City with a tent camp from July 31 to September 15. On November 20 he was \"sworn in\" as \"legitimate president\" in an alternative inauguration ceremony, saying he was launching a \"parallel government.\" This had no effect, and he lost again as the PRD candidate in 2012; he then left the PRD to help create the grassroots leftist Movement for National Regeneration (MORENA). As its candidate he won a landslide victory in the 2018 presidential election.\n\nLópez Obregón, Clara (Eugenia) (b. April 12, 1950, Bogotá, Colombia), Colombian presidential candidate (2014). She was also acting mayor of Bogotá (2011) and minister of labour (2016-17).\n\nLópez Padilla, Benecio (b. Aug. 23, 1888, Zaragoza, Coahuila, Mexico - d. Sept. 9, 1969, Mexico City, Mexico), governor of Tamaulipas (1923-24) and Coahuila (1941-45).\n\nLópez Pelegrín (y Martínez), Ramón (b. Aug. 30, 1767, Molina de Aragón [now in Guadalajara province, Castilla-La Mancha], Spain - d. July 21, 1841, Madrid, Spain), acting first secretary of state of Spain (1822, 1822).\n\nLópez Portillo\n\nLópez Portillo (y Pacheco), José (Guillermo Abel) (b. June 16, 1920, Mexico City, Mexico - d. Feb. 17, 2004, Mexico City), president of Mexico (1976-82); grandson of José López Portillo y Rojas. He held various administrative positions under presidents Gustavo Díaz Ordaz and Luis Echeverría Álvarez before becoming minister of finance in 1971. As president he followed a more conservative approach than that of his predecessor, deemphasizing land redistribution and favouring the creation of nonagricultural jobs, exploitation of oil and natural gas, tax concessions to stimulate industrial development, and attraction of foreign investment. His most significant political reform was to increase the size of the Chamber of Deputies to 400, with a minimum of 100 seats reserved for opposition parties. This measure was designed to permit more minority participation in Mexican politics, which had been dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party since 1929. On the international front, he adopted a somewhat conciliatory approach toward supplying the United States with oil and gas while exerting pressure for the easing of U.S. trade and immigration restrictions. His ambitious program for the exploitation of huge, newly discovered petroleum reserves by Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), the state-owned Mexican oil agency, resulted in the rapid expansion of Mexico's oil exports, but by the end of his term in 1982, the bottom had fallen out of the world crude oil market, rampant government corruption and unrestrained government borrowing had resulted in a huge foreign debt, and the economy was in shambles. For many years after the boom went bust, he was reviled. In 1983 Pres. Miguel de la Madrid dissociated himself from López's administration, accusing it of aggravating the \"grotesque\" maldistribution of wealth and defrauding PEMEX.\n\nLópez Portillo y Rojas, José (b. May 26, 1850, Guadalajara, Mexico - d. May 22, 1923, Mexico City, Mexico), governor of Jalisco (1912-14) and foreign minister of Mexico (1914).\n\nLópez Puigcerver, Joaquín (María) (b. Nov. 18, 1841, Valencia, Spain - d. June 28, 1906, Madrid, Spain), finance minister (1886-88, 1897-99) and interior minister (1893-94) of Spain. He was also minister of justice (1890, 1902, 1905) and development (1894-95).\n\nLópez Pumarejo\n\nLópez Pumarejo, Alfonso (b. Jan. 31, 1886, Honda, Tolima department, Colombia - d. Nov. 20, 1959, London, England), president of Colombia (1934-38, 1942-45). He first entered politics in 1915 when he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives as a Liberal. In 1921-22 he was treasury minister. In 1930 he helped to elect as president Enrique Olaya Herrera, bringing the Liberal Party to power for the first time in 45 years. López was then named minister to Britain. In 1934 he was elected president himself, being opposed only by a Communist candidate, Estiquio Timote. A friendship he had formed in Britain with Óscar R. Benavides, who became president of Peru in 1933, averted a threatened war between the two countries over the ownership of Leticia on the upper Amazon and led to the signing of a protocol of peace and friendship. He formally tendered his resignation in 1937 because he was dissatisfied with the action of parties in Congress, but it was refused. The constitution prohibited a president from serving two consecutive terms, but after an interval of four years he was elected a second time in 1942, defeating Carlos Arango Vélez. He was on leave of absence from November 1943 to May 1944, to take his wife to the United States for medical treatment, and thereafter again attempted to resign, but rescinding the resignation after the Senate rejected it. In an abortive coup by an army faction in July 1944, he was kidnapped and held for a short time. He finally resigned in July 1945.

In 1896-99 he was president of the Senate, and then was elected president of the republic following the death of Félix Faure. Favouring settlement of the case of Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish army officer convicted for treason on questionable evidence in 1894, he summoned René Waldeck-Rousseau to form a ministry to resolve the affair and appealed to all republicans to rally behind it.

In 1905, amid violent controversy, any relationship of the Roman Catholic Church, as well as of the Protestant and Jewish faiths, to the state was dissolved.

In 1965 he became leader of the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party. At that time his party did not have a single seat in the Alberta legislature, but he quickly reversed the party's fortunes. He was first elected in 1967 to represent Calgary West in the legislature. In the 1971 provincial election the Progressive Conservative Party gained a majority of seats, and Lougheed became premier of Alberta. His goal as premier was to convert the money earned from oil revenues into permanent capital to yield a self-sustaining economy once the nonrenewable resource base was exhausted. To this purpose his government established with oil revenues the Alberta Heritage Fund, a financial base from which to finance future industrialization and development in the province. Lougheed, a former football player with the Edmonton Eskimos, became the man to fight for Alberta in the conflict with the federal government over the pricing and sharing of the oil and gas reserves. The battle began in 1973 when the federal government put an export tax on crude oil. Finally, after years of wrangling, haggling, and political maneuvering, the province and the federal government reached an agreement on oil pricing on Sept. 2, 1981. By the terms of this pact the federal government would receive 25% "
