        "text": "2 . Jorge Medina ( 1926 - 2021 )\n\nWith an HPI of 54.38 , Jorge Medina is the 2nd most famous Chilean Religious Figure . His biography has been translated into 23 different languages.\n\nJorge Arturo Agustín Medina Estévez (Spanish: [ˈxoɾxe meˈðina]; 23 December 1926 – 3 October 2021) was a Chilean prelate of the Catholic Church who held senior positions both in his native country and in the Roman Curia. He was prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments from 1996 to 2002 and was made a cardinal in 1998. Beginning in 1985 he served as auxiliary bishop and then from 1987 bishop of Rancagua and then bishop of Valparaíso from 1993 to 1996. As Cardinal Protodeacon, the longest serving cardinal of the order of cardinal deacons, he announced the election of Pope Benedict XVI to the world on 19 April 2005.\n\n3 . Teresa of the Andes ( 1900 - 1920 )\n\nWith an HPI of 52.88 , Teresa of the Andes is the 3rd most famous Chilean Religious Figure . Her biography has been translated into 18 different languages.\n\nTeresa of Jesus of Los Andes, OCD (Spanish: Teresa de Jesús de Los Andes; born Juana Enriqueta Josephina de Los Sagrados Corazones Fernández Solar; 13 July 1900 – 12 April 1920) was a Chilean nun of the Discalced Carmelites. Fernández Solar was a pious child but had an often unpredictable temperament for she could be prone to anger and being vain but could also demonstrate her charitable and loving nature; she seemed transformed when she decided to become a nun and her character seemed to change for her sole ambition was to dedicate herself to the service of God. But her time in the convent was cut short due to her contracting an aggressive disease that killed her - she knew she would die but was consoled knowing she would be able to make her profession before she died. Her canonization process opened on 23 April 1976 under Pope Paul VI and she became titled as a Servant of God. The confirmation of her life of heroic virtue on 22 March 1986 allowed for her to be titled as Venerable. Solar was beatified on 3 April 1987 in Chile after a miracle attributed to her from her native land cleared her for beatification while another miracle coming from Chile led Pope John Paul II to canonize her as a saint on 21 March 1993 in Saint Peter's Square.\n\n6 . Raúl Silva Henríquez ( 1907 - 1999 )\n\nWith an HPI of 46.46 , Raúl Silva Henríquez is the 6th most famous Chilean Religious Figure . His biography has been translated into 15 different languages.\n\nRaúl Silva Henríquez SDB (27 September 1907 – 9 April 1999) was a Chilean prelate of the Catholic Church, a cardinal from 1962. He served as Archbishop of Santiago de Chile from 1961 to 1983 and as Bishop of Valparaíso from 1959 to 1961. Both as Archbishop and in retirement, he was an advocate for social justice and democracy and a forthright vocal critic of the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet—\"a constant thorn in the Government's side\"."
