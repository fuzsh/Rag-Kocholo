        "text": "Riccardo Ezzati, often referred to as \"Ricardo\", due to the many years he spent in Chile, was born in Campiglia dei Berici, in the Province of Vicenza, Italy, on 7 January 1942, to Mario Ezzati and Assunta Andrello. He completed his elementary studies in the municipal school in his district. The first sign of his vocation dates back to those years: one day the mother of a friend came to visit his family and told him about her son who was preparing to attend a Salesian vocational guidance centre. He decided to follow in his footsteps, so he enrolled in the college at Penango, in the Province of Asti. And when at the age of eighteen he arrived in Chile, in 1960, he immediately entered the Salesian novitiate at Quilpué.\n\nHe made his first religious profession on 31 January 1961, then studied philosophy and pedagogy at the Salesian institute affiliated with the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso, and from 1964 to 1966 he taught at the Camilo Ortúzar Montt high school in Santiago.\n\nReturning to Italy to complete his studies in Theology, he took courses at the Pontifical Salesian University in Rome, finally obtaining his licence. Subsequently he moved to the University of Strasbourg, France, where he gained his master's degree in religious pedagogy. Returning to Chile, he taught religion and philosophy at the Catholic University of Valparaíso, until he made his perpetual profession on 30 December 1966 and was ordained a priest on 18 March 1970.\n\nAdmiring his loyalty to the mission and professional and human skills, the superiors entrusted him with various tasks in the following years. From 1971 to 1972 he was responsible for the pastoral care of the Salesian institute in Valdivia. From 1973 to 1977 he worked in Concepción, as superior of the local religious community and Director of the Salesian institute. In 1978 he was appointed Director of the Salesian formation centre in Santiago, as well as being elected Provincial Councillor.\n\nAt the same time, he also continued teaching: he taught Fundamental Pastoral Care in the Faculty of Theology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and was a member and Director of the Centro de Estudios y Experiencias Catequísticas (CEEC). In 1984, during General Chapter 22, he was appointed Provincial of the Chilean Salesians, and shortly thereafter he was also elected Vice-President of the Conference of Major Superiors of Religious Men and Women of Chile (CONFERRE).\n\nIn 1991 he was called to the Vatican to collaborate with Archbishop Errázuriz Ossa, then Secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life.\n\nPope John Paul II appointed him bishop on 28 June 1996, assigning him the diocese of Valdivia, which he took possession of on 8 September 1996.\n\nOn 10 July 2001 he was transferred to the titular Church of La Imperial and at the same time appointed auxiliary of Santiago de Chile.\n\nAfter many years of dedicated service to the Church and the people of Chile, on April 24, 2006, the President of the Republic, at the request of the National Congress, granted him Chilean citizenship \"by special grace\" .\n\nOn 27 December, Benedict XVI appointed him Archbishop of Concepción.\n\nIn the Chilean Episcopal Conference he was a member of the Pastoral Commission, where he presided over the area of education for two terms. He has also been part of the seminary commission, the pastoral care of vocations and the mixed commission of major superiors and bishops. He has been a member of the Standing Committee since 2007.\n\nHe also held various duties and positions within the Latin American Episcopal Council (CELAM), including member of the Department of Consecrated Life and President of the Department of Culture and Education; he also participated, in 2007, in the historic fifth General Conference of the Episcopate of Latin America and the Caribbean held in Aparecida, Brazil.\n\nOn 15 December 2010 Benedict XVI appointed him Metropolitan Archbishop of Santiago de Chile. That year the Episcopal Conference elected him its president, a position that was renewed on 8 November 2013 for another three years. In the Chilean capital, he aimed above all to educate people to share with the poorest. He stressed the fact that there is no shortage of goods, but a fairer and more just distribution is necessary to transform the country into a \"mesa para todos\" (a table for all), according to the slogan launched to raise awareness among the faithful. He called on the laity to shared responsibility in the new evangelisation. Also noteworthy is his contribution to the enhancement of consecrated life, through documents and interventions.\n\nCreated Cardinal in the Consistory of 22 February 2014, he became Archbishop emeritus of Santiago on 23 March 2019, at the age of 77."
