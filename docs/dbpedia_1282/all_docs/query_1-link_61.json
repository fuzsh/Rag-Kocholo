        "text": "üïô: 10 min.\n\nThroughout the history of the Salesian Congregation, the popes have chosen some of its members as cardinals, that is, as his closest collaborators in the government of the Universal Church. Always a reason for joy and sadness: joy because of the appreciation of the service performed by certain Salesians, sadness because the Congregation has to do without one of its most valuable members.\n\nThe term ‚Äúcardinal‚Äù comes from Latin and means ‚Äúhinge‚Äù, i.e. a point around which a door usually revolves. Or perhaps it can be better understood if we recall the cardinal virtues, i.e. the virtues around which all other human virtues revolve.\n\nCardinals are people who have received the sacrament of Holy Orders and are called by the Pope to perform a mission alongside him in the Universal Church, either individually or collegially. They hold the most important positions in the Roman Curia.\n\nTheir importance also lies in the fact that they are the ones who have the mission of electing the new pontiff (only the electors, i.e. those who have not reached the age of 80), with the College of Cardinals gathered in Conclave, when the Sede Vacante occurs.\n\nThere are three groups of cardinals: Cardinal-bishops, who are the holders of the suburbicarian dioceses (outside the walls of Rome or in the city‚Äôs environs) and, by decision after the Second Vatican Council, the Eastern Patriarchs elevated to the cardinalate (who retain the title of their own patriarchal see); Cardinal-presbyters ‚Äì the most numerous -, and Cardinal-deacons. The latter two orders are respectively assigned titles or deaconships (churches) in Rome. These honorary titles reflect their closeness to the Pope.\n\nThere are usually 6 Cardinal-bishops (there are 6 suburbicarian Sees), but today, by virtue of a papal dispensation, 4 more Cardinal-bishops are appointed ad personam (without the cardinal title being elevated to an episcopal title) and 2 more patriarchs, in total 12, of whom 6 are electors.\n\nThere are 182 Cardinal-presbyters, of whom 97 are electors.\n\nThe Cardinal deacons are 27, of whom 16 are electors.\n\nIn total there are 221 cardinals, of whom 119 are electors.\n\nCardinals are usually chosen from among bishops, archbishops, metropolitans or patriarchs, but there have also been appointments among priests. Pope St John Paul II appointed 9 priests as cardinals, Pope Benedict XVI appointed 5 priests as cardinals and Pope Francis has so far appointed 8 priests as cardinals, 10 if we consider the latest announcement on 9 July.\n\nThe first Salesian to be elevated to the dignity of cardinal was Archbishop John Cagliero, on 6 December 1915. After him, 18 other Salesians received the cardinal‚Äôs biretta and the 20th, Fr √Ångel FERN√ÅNDEZ ARTIME, will receive it on 30 September next. He is the first Rector Major to receive the cardinal‚Äôs red hat.\n\nFor many people looking in from the outside, the first thing they see is the dignity it implies; but even if this is real, Pope Francis reminds them that it is not a privilege, but a service, and the red colour means it must be performed until the outpouring of blood. And it is an unspecified service that requires total availability. God asked Abraham to set out without specifying where he would go, to prove his faith; similarly for the new cardinals.\n\nWe wish our Rector Major, Fr √Ångel many graces from the Lord to guide him in his new mission and assure him of our prayers.\n\nIn the hope of making more and more Salesian cardinals known, we present below the list of all these cardinals with the dates and the most important offices they have held or continue to hold to date."
