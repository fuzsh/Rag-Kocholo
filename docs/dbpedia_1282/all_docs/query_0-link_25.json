        "text": "Nestled along the western coast of South America lies Chile, a nation that has produced remarkable individuals. From world-famous entertainers to prominent politicians, famous Chilean people continue to light up screens and influence lives.\n\nIn the acting sphere, Pedro Pascal shines with his stellar performances in hit series such as Game of Thrones and The Mandalorian, enamoring viewers around the globe. Literary aficionados hold Pablo Neruda, a Nobel laureate poet, in high esteem for his verses on love, nature, and politics. Cote de Pablo became an international sensation on the TV screen through her portrayal of special agent Ziva David on NCIS.\n\nPolitically, Salvador Allende's tenure as President of Chile left an indelible mark on history by championing democracy and social justice in both his country and Latin America at large.\n\nRead on to learn about Chilean celebrities who broke barriers in their respective domains, inspiring future generations and admirers worldwide.\n\nRanked by\n\nBirthplace : Santiago, Chile\n\nNicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi, a dynamic personality in the entertainment industry, is best known for her vivacious presence on the reality television show Jersey Shore. Born on November 23, 1987, in Santiago, Chile, she was adopted and raised by Italian-American parents in Marlboro, New York. Her upbringing fostered a unique blend of cultures that would later add to her distinct persona on television. Polizzi's journey into stardom began when she was cast in MTV's Jersey Shore in 2009. As one of the most memorable characters, Polizzi quickly gained notoriety for her lively spirit and flamboyant lifestyle. The show's immense popularity catapulted her into the limelight, making her a household name. Subsequently, she starred in a spin-off series, Snooki & Jwoww, further cementing her place in pop culture. Polizzi's career extends beyond reality television. She has made guest appearances on various talk shows, competed on Dancing with the Stars, and even authored several books. An entrepreneur at heart, Polizzi launched her own line of clothing and accessories, demonstrating her diverse talents and business acumen. Despite her fame and success in entertainment, Polizzi maintains a focus on her family, often sharing glimpses of her life as a mother and wife.\n\nBirthplace : Tocopilla, Chile\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky, a titan in the world of cinema and comic books, was born in 1929 in Tocopilla, Chile. His cultural influence extends beyond his native land, with a career spanning several continents and multiple mediums. Jodorowsky's early life was marked by a profound sense of mysticism inherited from his parents who were both Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. This spirituality would go on to shape much of his artistic output, imbuing it with a unique depth and complexity. Jodorowsky's foray into filmmaking began in Mexico, producing avant-garde theater during the 1960s. His ascent to international prominence came with the release of El Topo (1970), a metaphysical western often regarded as the first-ever midnight movie. Equally significant is his attempt to adapt Frank Herbert's science fiction novel Dune, a project that remains one of the most famous unmade films in history. Despite its non-completion, the planned film had a far-reaching impact on the sci-fi genre, influencing creators such as Ridley Scott and George Lucas. Apart from his cinematic ventures, Jodorowsky is celebrated for his work in comic books. He collaborated with French artist Moebius to create The Incal series which has since been acclaimed as a masterpiece of the comic medium. His other prominent works include Metabarons and Technopriests. Furthermore, Jodorowsky's exploration of spiritual themes led him to create \"psychomagic\", a therapeutic practice that combines elements of tarot, shamanism, and traditional psychotherapy. Alejandro Jodorowsky's multi-faceted career thus presents him as a visionary artist and innovative storyteller, consistently pushing boundaries across diverse spheres of creativity.\n\nDec. at 59 (1915-1974)\n\nBirthplace : Talcahuano, Chile\n\nGeneral Carlos Prats González (Spanish: [ˈkaɾlos ˈpɾats]; February 24, 1915 – September 30, 1974) was a Chilean Army officer and politician. He served as a minister in Salvador Allende's government while Commander-in-chief of the Chilean Army. Immediately after General Augusto Pinochet's September 11, 1973 coup, Prats went into voluntary exile in Argentina. The following year, he and his wife, Sofía Cuthbert, were assassinated in Buenos Aires by a car bomb planted by the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional.\n\nDec. at 40 (1932-1973)\n\nBirthplace : Chile\n\nVíctor Lidio Jara Martínez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈβiktoɾ ˈliðjo ˈxaɾa maɾˈtines]; 28 September 1932 – 16 September 1973) was a Chilean teacher, theater director, poet, singer-songwriter and communist political activist tortured and killed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. He developed Chilean theater by directing a broad array of works, ranging from locally produced plays to world classics, as well as the experimental work of playwrights such as Ann Jellicoe. He also played a pivotal role among neo-folkloric musicians who established the Nueva Canción Chilena (New Chilean Song) movement. This led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of President Salvador Allende. Jara was arrested shortly after the Chilean coup of 11 September 1973, which overthrew Allende. He was tortured during interrogations and ultimately shot dead, and his body was thrown out on the street of a shantytown in Santiago. The contrast between the themes of his songs—which focused on love, peace, and social justice—and the brutal way in which he was murdered transformed Jara into a \"potent symbol of struggle for human rights and justice\" for those killed during the Pinochet regime. His preponderant role as an open admirer and propagandist for Che Guevara and Allende's government, under he served as a cultural ambassador through the late 60's and until the early 70's crisis that ended in Allende's Coup, marked him for death. In June 2016, a Florida jury found former Chilean Army officer Pedro Barrientos liable for Jara's murder. In July 2018, eight retired Chilean military officers were sentenced to 18 years and a day in prison for Jara's murder.\n\nDec. at 44 (1946-1991)\n\nBirthplace : Chile\n\nJaime Jorge Guzmán Errázuriz (June 28, 1946 – April 1, 1991) was a Chilean lawyer and senator, member and doctrinal founder of the conservative Independent Democrat Union party. In the 1960s he opposed the University Reform and became the main ideologist of the gremialismo thought. He opposed President Salvador Allende and later became a close advisor of Pinochet and his dictatorship. A professor of Constitutional Law, he played an important part in the drafting of the 1980 Constitution. He was assassinated in 1991, during the transition to democracy, by members of the communist urban guerrilla Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front.\n\nDec. at 65 (1908-1973)\n\nBirthplace : Valparaíso, Chile\n\nSalvador Guillermo Allende Gossens (US: , UK: , American Spanish: [salβaˈðoɾ ɣiˈʝeɾmo aˈʝende ˈɣosens]; 26 June 1908 – 11 September 1973) was a Chilean democratic socialist politician and physician, President of Chile from 1970 until 1973, and head of the Popular Unity political coalition government; he was the first ever Marxist to be elected president in a country with liberal democracy.Allende's involvement in Chilean political life spanned a period of nearly forty years, having covered the posts of senator, deputy and cabinet minister. As a life-long committed member of the Socialist Party of Chile, whose foundation he had actively contributed to, he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections. In 1970, he won the presidency in a close three-way race. He was elected in a run-off by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority. On 11 September 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'état supported by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende committed suicide with an AK47 rifle gifted to him by Fidel Castro, according to an investigation conducted by a Chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011.Following Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990, ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic rule. The military junta that took over dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which thousands of civilians were kidnapped, tortured, and murdered."
