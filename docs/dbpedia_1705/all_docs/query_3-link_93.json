        "text": "Research of the world of cinema often deals with the manner in which movies replicate the social balance of power, creating a symbolic order based on an essentially masculine world-view that puts the man at its center. The price women pay for this phallocentric approach-their persistent objectification in cinema, and the very small number of female screenwriters and directors-has become a much-discussed topic in contemporary research. However, the question of the price paid in the male artistic creation process has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This qualitative study addresses the lacuna in contemporary research, with reference to three metafictional films that focus on male directors for whom cinema is the pivotal center of their being: the Israeli film Peaches and Cream directed by Gur Bentwich (2019); the Spanish film Pain and Glory, director Pedro Almodóvar (2019); and Bob Fosse’s All That Jazz (USA, 1979). They all are viewed as having an affinity with the ancient Greek comparison of male creativity with female procreativity, which is still reflected in contemporary studies. The films paint a picture of the male creative process shadowed by a sense of danger and loss of self. All three expose the feelings of anxiety inherent in film directors’ work, and the possible resultant breakdown, not only in an emotional sense but in a real, potentially fatal physical or medical sense as well. In all three movies, the director conceives of his ability to restore his sense of inner wholeness and male identity in a manner that contradicts the conventional balance of power, while customary power-relations are revealed as another road to loss of identity and sense of self. Each of the films ties the director’s ability to renew his sense of personal wholeness to developing a relationship with his surroundings, facilitated by audience appreciation, critical praise, or empathy from those close to him – all of which reinforce his feeling of belonging and significance. Without these aspects, the ‘absolute artist,’ whose life revolves around his art, is shown to be at death’s door, whether symbolically or in reality.\n\nThe aim of this study is, within the art education given to the prospective teacher of visual arts, to determine the effect of watching some movies as regards artists on artistic development process. The participants of the study consisted of senior students (of three-years) carrying on their education at the Department of Fine Art Education, Art Teaching Unit of Çukurova University during the academic year of 2011-2012. The study has been carried on through qualitative research. As a result the use of films about artists of all students in the process of education was positively they viewed.\n\nFilm as document The moment when Siegfried Kracauer knew that he wanted to write of film as what he terms the ‘Discover of the Marvels of Everyday Life’ is relayed in his introduction to the Theory of Film from 1960.1 Kracauer recalls watching a film long ago that shows a banal scene, an ordinary city street. A puddle in the foreground reflects the houses that cannot be seen and some of the sky. A breeze crosses the site. The puddle’s water trembles. ‘The trembling upper world in the dirty puddle – this image has never left me’, writes Kracauer. In this trembling, which is the moment of nature’s uninvited intervention, its inscription as movement on film, everything, from nature to culture, ‘takes on life’, he notes. What is important about film is its presentation of this given life indiscriminately. The puddle, this unworthy spillage, is redeemed in the low art of cinema. Both cinema and puddle are elevated from the ground. The upper world is brought down to earth as image. Fixed ..."
