He meets and falls in love with Marie, an aspiring actress who is rehearsing for a stage production of 'Alice in Wonderland'. All his attempts to find a job and a way out end up in failure, his friends Étienne and Jean-Pierre are powerless to help him, and the dreamy yet desperate hero loses his mind.",

        "text": "Light, rom-com flavored, a bit on the fluffy side... but there''s an inescapable thesis at work, with a lead character chafing at the mundanity of daily life and craving the kind of excitement one sees in the movies (exemplified here by Douglas Fairbanks.) \"Real life just ain't like that\" is the whole of the message, and it's hammered home by sequence after sequence in which he goes for broke with swashbuckling stuff or stunt work that seems inappropriate to his Paris 1976 surroundings.\n\nThe biggish problem I had with that is that contriving those action sequences becomes a bit of a reach after awhile, a bit of a desperate reach, and it detracts enormously from the script's ability to present him as a unified, coherent personality -- his motivations, style, way of confronting problems, changes at the drop of a hat, depending only on what flavor of galliivanting he's going to do next.\n\nJust discovered cinephobe.tv, a channel that streams obscure films all day. I do love live streams because they take the power away from me to choose films or to pause the film lol\n\nThis was interesting, Fairbanks is so petulant, the ending was kind of surprising."
