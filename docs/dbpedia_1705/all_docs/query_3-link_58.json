        "text": "Introduction\n\nDiscoverFrance.net welcomes you to our online Video Store! We are very pleased to offer the world's largest inventory of DVD and VHS movies for sale, as part of our association with Amazon.com. This alliance, now entering its fifth year, is based on their rigorous standards of quality, dependability, and a reputation for unmatched customer service.\n\nGérard Depardieu\n\nWithin these pages you will find thousands of titles by French directors, cinematic masterpieces featuring the performances of France's greatest talents  from long-established screen legends to the up-and-coming new stars of the silver screen. Famous names such as Cocteau, Deneuve, Belmondo, Depardieu, Huppert, and hundreds more are only a click away in this extensive catalogue.\n\nIn addition to featuring cinema produced and directed in France, we are pleased to present you with a selection of fine English-language movies whose themes, filming locations, or actors provide a wonderful taste of France. For those who are contemplating a trip to France, we also offer visual tours of this country's many charms  with travelogues covering Paris sightseeing attractions, the colorful and varied cultures of the French provinces, narrated visits to famous castles of the Loire valley, and delightful barge cruises through the heart and soul of France.\n\nLanguage and Sub-titles\n\nMost of the movies produced in France are provided with a French soundtrack. The VHS editions are usually subtitled in English (unless otherwise noted), while the DVD editions frequently offer both subtitles and several different language tracks. Every product listing will specify the special features and language options, as well as compatible viewing platforms (such as NTSC, PAL, or SECAM for VHS) and regions (for DVDs). (See country guide for VHS compatibility list.)\n\nVirginie Ledoyen\n\nEnglish-language movies, such as travelogues and feature films produced in the U.S. and U.K., will not usually offer subtitles in any language, though the DVD editions may offer various language tracks. Refer to each product listing for details.\n\nHow To Navigate This Site\n\nUsing the dual menus above, choose a category from the left menu  Directors, Actors, Actresses, or Miscellaneous Films. Then, from the right menu, scroll down to select the named director, performer, or topic of your choice. In the event you cannot find a preferred subject in our menus, we offer you a choice of both English and French search engines to locate any item from the convenience of your desktop.\n\nMost in-stock DVDs are offered at a discount of 15% or more off the list price; many VHS tapes are offered at close-out prices (or reduced list), as the DVD format gradually replaces VHS in consumer popularity. Note that many titles will also qualify for FREE Super-Saver Shipping, subject to certain order minimums. Some products are available by special order, and Amazon.com will even query its network of used video merchants to locate a hard-to-find title for you!\n\nThanks to state-of-the-art encryption technology, you have our assurance that online credit card orders are totally secure (see our Safe Shopping Guarantee). All orders will be fulfilled directly by Amazon.com, and your satisfaction is absolutely guaranteed!\n\nManon des Sources\n\nstarring\n\nDaniel Auteuil,\n\nEmmanuelle Béart,\n\nYves Montand\n\nWhy Shop at DiscoverFrance.net?\n\nWhile it is always possible for you to shop directly through Amazon.com's home page or through any of its 600,000 other affiliates, shopping through the links provided in the Discover France Cinémathèque helps us to defray the expenses of developing and hosting this site. We are constantly adding new content to serve our audience of francophiles throughout the world (1.75 million visitors in 2003!), and our site has received numerous awards for its educational excellence during the past four years.\n\nThis effort can only be sustained with your support! If you feel that your experience on our site has been a positive one, and that the information we have presented here has proved helpful to you in planning a trip or learning more about France, please consider making your purchases through our Boutique.\n\nWhen you follow links to Amazon.com products through our Video Store, a temporary cookie is stored in your browser which tells Amazon.com that your visit originated here. If your visit results in a purchase, approximately 5% of the total sale (before shipping) is credited to Discover France in the form of a commission. The cookie is erased when you finish your browsing session, and a subsequent visit directly to Amazon.com's home page will NOT be credited to Discover France. Consequently, we respectfully ask that you bookmark the page you are now viewing, to ensure that future purchases will support our ongoing efforts.\n\nPlease visit our Guest Book, let us know what you think, and suggest any particular actors or titles which you'd like to see offered by DiscoverFrance.net in the future. Thank you kindly for your patronage and support! I hope that your visits here have provided you with a useful and informative collection of resources on France.\n\nIan C. Mills, Managing Director\n\nwww.discoverfrance.net"
