        "text": "ENTRIES IN PART 7:\n\nDan Sallitt\n\nDan Sallitt is a filmmaker and film writer living in New York\n\nFilms released for the first time in 2021, in approximate order of preference:\n\nEl Planeta (Amalia Ulman, 2021)\n\nSouad (Ayten Amin, 2021)\n\nKoozhangal (Pebbles, P. S. Vinothraj, 2021)\n\nOutside Noise (Ted Fendt, 2021)\n\nFrance (Bruno Dumont, 2021)\n\nQuién lo impide (Who’s Stopping Us, Jonás Trueba, 2021)\n\nSusanna Andler (Benoît Jacquot, 2021)\n\nThe Cathedral (Ricky D’Ambrose, 2021)\n\nDangsin-eolgul-apeseo (In Front of Your Face, Hong Sang-soo, 2021)\n\nEspíritu sagrado (The Sacred Spirit, Chema García Ibarra, 2021)\n\nWood and Water (Jonas Bak, 2021)\n\nI usually add many films to this list after the year-end submission deadline.\n\nOlder films encountered for the first time in 2021, in chronological order. Each of these films would be in my 2021 top five if they were released this year:\n\nMashenka (Yuli Raizman, 1942)\n\nA esli eto lyubov? (But What If This Is Love?, Yuli Raizman, 1962)\n\nOnce More (Paul Vecchiali, 1988)\n\nAux petits bonheurs (Life’s Little Treasures, Michel Deville, 1994)\n\nKippur (Amos Gitai, 2000)\n\nEmek Tiferet (Beautiful Valley, Hadar Friedlich, 2011)\n\nAferim! (Radu Jude, 2015)\n\nTemporada (Long Way Home, André Novais Oliveira, 2018)\n\nJong chak yeok (Short Vacation, Kwon Min-pyo and Han-Sol Seo, 2020)\n\nI won’t play favorites among all the great online series that made home viewing worthwhile this year, but I do notice that I crossed a psychological line sometime in the last decade, maybe during the pandemic, and would no longer cite “watching movies” as the most important reason to live in big cities. When I was an 18-year-old cinephile, I imagined the future as a home screening system that could show movies on demand from all international film archives. Having not foreseen the internet, I thought that centralized film collections would be necessary for any such system. Anyway, I lived long enough to get what I wished for, mutatis mutandis.\n\nMaria San Filippo\n\nEditor-in-Chief, New Review of Film and Television Studies\n\nNot having managed a “best of” last year – the first I’ve missed in a decade, but it was that kind of year – I’m excited to get back to both list-making and movie-going. In alphabetical order, here’s what I loved most and the five cherished art house cinemas where I watched them.\n\nBergman Island (Mia Hansen-Løve, 2021)\n\nCoolidge Corner Theatre (Brookline, MA, USA)\n\nHansen-Løve’s meditation on life-as-art-as-life is her most moving, fully realized work to date, assisted by a perfect quartet of lead performers and (it must be said) an utterly sublime marriage of Maestro Bergman and ABBA.\n\nThe Card Counter (Paul Schrader, 2021)\n\nKendall Square Cinema (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\nFollowing First Reformed (2017), this second shocker of Schrader’s late period is a fierce four-hander – all supreme performances – about redemption, revenge, and life in endless wartime.\n\nDays (Tsai Ming-liang, 2020)\n\nBrattle Theatre (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\n30 years since Tsai and muse/creative partner Lee Kang-sheng first teamed up, their latest collaboration simmers with their signature slow-build, deep-seated desire for connection, and generational sense of time lost and – thanks to cinema – regained.\n\nL’événement (Happening, Audrey Diwan, 2021)\n\nBrattle Theatre (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\nArriving amidst U.S. rollbacks against reproductive freedoms, Diwan’s adaptation of memoirist Annie Ernaux’s harrowing pursuit to terminate her pregnancy in early 1960s France made my “Filming Abortion” themed playlist and warns why – paraphrasing Planned Parenthood – we can’t go back.\n\nMadres paralelas (Parallel Mothers, Pedro Almodóvar, 2021)\n\nBrattle Theatre (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\nPenélope Cruz and the too-long-buried legacy of Franco’s Spain clearly make for combustive creative inspiration, as the septuagenarian filmmaker’s late period has me hooked more than ever. Together with Volver (2006) and Dolor y gloria (Pain and Glory, 2019), it’s Almodóvar’s Holy Trinity.\n\nPetite Maman (Céline Sciamma, 2021)\n\nBrattle Theatre (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\nThis intricately constructed jewel box of a film is as serene as Sciamma’s Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait of a Lady on Fire, 2019) was impassioned; that they are only her fourth and fifth features, released two years apart, make them all the more momentous.\n\nRed Rocket (Sean Baker, 2021)\n\nBrattle Theatre (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\nBaker works in mysterious ways: alchemizing Americana at its most degenerate yet uplifting, treating his characters lovingly yet knowingly, ingratiating itself as charmingly as Simon Rex’s hustling protagonist. Though his aims don’t appear political, Baker’s films could unite us all.\n\nThe Souvenir: Part II (Joanna Hogg, 2021)\n\nAngelika Film Center (New York, NY, USA)\n\nLike Bergman Island, this story of a stalled woman’s fumbling to find creative drive by recalling a lost love results in his, and her, revival through filmmaking. Resisting closure, Part II complicates rather than resolves Part I, by making meandering the artistic end the point in itself.\n\nSummer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised, Amir Questlove Thompson, 2021)\n\nKendall Square Cinema (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\nThis transcendent document of the Summer of 1969’s Harlem Cultural Festival provided a rush of jubilation as the lockdown eased, even while giving a wistful reminder of when revolution seemed realizable; every musical act nails it, but they save the best for last.\n\nVerdens verste menneske (The Worst Person in the World, Joachim Trier, 2021)\n\nBrattle Theatre (Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\nAn exhilarating portrait of a woman’s becoming and a man’s withering, and the shape-shifting bond between them, with a breakout performance by Renate Reinsve and Anders Danielsen Lie at his most astonishing yet.\n\nGūzen to Sōzō (Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi)\n\nFilm Forum (New York, NY, USA)\n\nAs rumors of (not yet seen) Doraibu mai kā (Drive My Car, 2021), Hamaguchi’s other film topping the year’s best lists, is a quiet marvel, pray that he remains as prolific as Yasujirō Ozu, whose playful solemnity he seems to have inherited.\n\nHonorable mention for most promising newcomer:\n\nnumb (Liv McNeil, 2020)\n\nA belated find, to which I’m definitely late to the game but amazed, nonetheless.\n\nContenders I’m still waiting to behold on the big, or small, screen: Azor (Andreas Fontana, 2021), Benedetta (Paul Verhoeven, 2021), The Disciple (Chaitanya Tamhane, 2020), Doraibu mai kā (Drive My Car, Dune, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, 2021), France (Bruno Dumont, 2021), The Green Knight (David Lowery, 2021), Ghahreman (A Hero, Asghar Farhadi, 2021), The Humans (Stephen Karam, 2021), I’m Your Man (Maria Schrader, 2021), Kajillionaire (Miranda July, 2020), Language Lessons (Natalie Morales, 2021), Licorice Pizza (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2021), The Lost Daughter (Maggie Gyllenhaal, 2021), Malcolm & Marie (Sam Levinson, 2021), Memoria (Apichatpong Weerasethakul, 2021), Nightmare Alley (Guillermo del Toro, 2021), El Planeta (Amalia Ulman, 2021), The Power of the Dog (Jane Campion, 2021), Felkészülés meghatározatlan ideig tartó együttlétre (Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time, Lili Horvát, 2020), Procession (Robert Greene, 2021), Spencer (Pablo Larraín, 2021), Test Pattern (Shatara Michelle Ford, 2019), Titane (Julia Ducournau, 2021), The Truffle Hunters (Michael Dweck, 2020), Ras vkhedavt, rodesac cas vukurebt? (What Do We See When We Look at the Sky?, Aleksandre Koberidze, 2021), Zola (Janicza Bravo, 2020) – and no doubt many more.\n\nRowena Santos Aquino\n\nLos Angeles-based film lecturer and critic\n\nFavourite films viewed in 2021\n\n2021 releases\n\nAzor (Andreas Fontana, 2021)*\n\nEl Planeta (Amalia Ulman, 2021)*\n\nUna película de policías (A Cop Movie, Alonso Ruizpalacios, 2021)\n\nСтоп-Земля (Stop-Zemlia, Kateryna Gornostai, 2021)*\n\nTime irregardless\n\nAraya (Margot Benacerraf, 1959)\n\nBloody Nose, Empty Pockets (Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross, 2020)\n\nFelkészülés meghatározatlan ideig tartó együttlétre (Preparations to be Together for an Unknown Period of Time, Lili Horváth, 2020)\n\nGull (Kim Mi-jo, 2020)*\n\nHappy People: A Year in the Taiga (Werner Herzog, 2010)\n\nIn the Land of Lost Angels (Bishrel Mashbat, 2019)*\n\nThe Dead Don’t Die (Jim Jarmusch, 2019)\n\nThe Fugitive (John Ford, 1947)\n\nThe Inheritance (Ephraim Asili, 2020)*\n\nThe Painter and the Thief (Benjamin Ree, 2020)\n\nTiong Bahru Social Club (Bee Thiam Tan, 2020)*\n\nHonourable mentions\n\nAnima (Cao Jinling, 2020)*\n\nLiborio (Nino Martínez Sosa, 2021)*\n\nΜήλα (Apples, Christos Nikou, 2020)*\n\nTaming the Garden (Salomé Jashi, 2021)\n\nToda la luz que podemos ver (All the Light That We Can See, Pablo Escoto, 2020)\n\n*debut feature\n\nJack Sargeant\n\nJack Sargeant is an author, casual academic, and curator – working as program director of the Revelation Perth International Film Festival. In 2021 he also assisted in programming the Sydney Underground Film Festival.\n\nAs ever, I’m sure this will change and I’ve probably missed something out, but these films all caught my attention and imagination in 2021. These are presented in no particular order…\n\nBabardeală cu bucluc sau porno balamuc (Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, Radu Jude, 2021) – there’s a combination of Brechtian cinema, melodrama, and explicit sex in this analysis of online porn, collective hypocrisy, and the power of social and cultural opprobrium. The shift between the three acts is fascinating and there’s a real sense of the possibilities of cinematic storytelling at play here.\n\nTitane (Julia Ducournau, 2021) – this looked and sounded great on the big screen, I saw it twice at the cinema, which is rare for me. Several people mentioned it in the same vein as Crash (David Cronenberg, 1996), but to me this is a misreading of both texts. Titane is its own (motorized) beast. A fascinating combination of body horror, maybe even a mutant form of science fiction, a family drama, and many other things.\n\nBad Girls (Christopher Bickel, 2021) – the kind of no-budget, absurd, gleefully-nihilistic women-and-guns interstate-crime-spree-road-movie that you need in your life.\n\nIn The Earth (Ben Wheatley, 2021) – I am a fan of Wheatley’s work and this low-key horror is no exception.\n\nPleasure (Ninja Thyberg, 2021) – the story of one woman’s attempts to break into the porn industry, this really stayed with me after viewing.\n\nOther, Like Me (Marcus Werner Hed, Dan Fox, 2020) – the Coum Transmissions and Throbbing Gristle documentary. Pretty much essential viewing for fans of TG and Coum Transmissions, perhaps it’s obvious I am, but I was very pleased to see this.\n\nDelia Derbyshire: The Myths & Legendary Tapes (Caroline Catz, 2020) – as somebody who grew up in the seventies and as a fan of Dr Who, Derbyshire’s work was central to my childhood. This film really told her story and helped contextualize her work.\n\nThe Velvet Underground (Todd Haynes, 2021) – a great year for music documentaries (an honourable mention here to the equally enjoyable King Rocker, Michael Cumming, 2020), but this was just perfect. I watched it just coming out of lockdown and it was exactly the right film at the right time. A good use of archive footage that draws on many early Sixties’ underground movies to create its atmosphere.\n\nThe Suicide Squad (James Gunn, 2021) – I tend to feel most superhero movies are mindless and largely forgettable fun, but James Gunn yet again takes the form and plays with it. In The Suicide Squad he seems to renounce any attempt to create the kind of canonical intertextual work that many seem to relish instead, inventing something that gleefully dances through the more surreal possibilities of the genre.\n\nSwan Song (Todd Stephens, 2021) – Udo Kier is on top form in this story of ageing, community, and friendship.\n\nChristine Sathiah\n\nChristine Sathiah runs a film club in Penang, Malaysia\n\n2021, unfortunately, because of the pandemic, was not a great “cru” for outstanding films but, thankfully, there were a few notable exceptions.

The Rescue (Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, Jimmy Chin, 2021)\n\nThe Rescue is the tension-filled story of the rescue of twelve young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in a cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys had often used in the past, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. The film is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen for full impact.\n\n2. Ras vkhedavt, rodesac cas vukurebt? (What Do We See When We Look at the Sky? Aleksandre Koberidze, 2021)\n\nWinner of the FIPRESCI prize at the Berlinale, Koberidze celebrates the country of Georgia and the city of Kutaisi showing joy on the faces of small children, the slow-motion choreographed rhythm of a soccer game, and the eternal power of two human beings who find magic in each other’s presence. The sense of seeing the world newly permeates this lovely cinematic tone poem that bounces between playful fantasy and documentary-like realism.\n\n3. Nomadland (Chloé Zhao, 2020)*\n\nFollowing the economic collapse of a company town in rural Nevada, Fern (Frances McDormand) packs her van and sets off on the road, exploring a life outside of conventional society as a modern-day nomad. The third feature film from director Chloé Zhao, Nomadland features real nomads as Fern’s mentors and comrades in her exploration through the vast landscape of the American West. Fern adopts a nomadic, hand-to-mouth lifestyle, and along the way, she meets other kindred spirits, modern-day nomads whose entire generation suffered a crippling blow after the 2008 financial collapse.\n\n4. Beautiful Something Left Behind (Katrine Philp, 2020)*\n\nThe efforts of a non-profit New Jersey group, “Good Grief”, founded in 2004 to offer support for children and surviving parents who have lost someone close, are documented in the remarkable film Beautiful Something Left Behind, winner of the Grand Jury Award for Best Documentary at the 2020 SXSW Film Festival. In spite of the difficult subject matter, the film is filled with elements of joy as well as sadness and the resilience of children.\n\n5. Words on Bathroom Walls (Thor Freudenthal, 2020)*\n\nHigh-school student Adam Petrazelli lives in a world without silence. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, the voices in his head never stop, interfering with his ability to function and endangering his need to graduate from high school and fulfil his dream of going to culinary school. The film is framed by Adam’s own narration. Speaking to an unseen and unheard psychiatrist, Adam takes us into his confidence as he talks about his daily challenges.\n\n6. Felkészülés meghatározatlan ideig tartó együttlétre (Preparations to be Together for an Unknown Period of Time, Lili Horvát, 2020)*\n\nHungary’s submission for Best International Film at the 2021 Academy Awards, the film is a meditation on loneliness, the role of projection in a love relationship, and the problems we have in communicating the truth to each other. Complete with a femme fatale, loads of atmosphere enhanced by Gabor Keresztes’ score, and bits of opera and chamber piano music, it is an absorbing viewing experience that keeps us riveted, attempting to find out if there are any answers at the bottom of all the questions.\n\n7. Time (Garrett Bradley, 2020)*\n\nWinner of the Sundance Award for Best Director, Garrett Bradley’s stunning documentary, Time, shows the human cost on a Black family in Louisiana coping with the absence of husband and father of six boys, Robert Richardson, sentenced to sixty years in prison for the attempted robbery of a credit union. The passage of time in the film, as shown in the videos compiled by wife and mother, Sibil Fox Richardson – known as Fox Rich, reflects the boys’ growth from childhood to young adults, an entire life without having ever known what it means to have a father.\n\n8. 1982 (Oualid Mouaness, 2019)*\n\nMouaness looks at the Israeli-Lebanese War through the eyes of pre-adolescent children in Cedar High School, a private elementary school near Beirut. Based on his own experience as a ten-year old student on the last day of school in Lebanon in 1982, Mouaness’ film explores the children’s attempt to make sense of an incomprehensible situation, one that they can sense is fraught with danger for themselves and their families. The film shows that in “the darkest places of human behaviour generosity and love can survive; that humanity and love can overcome cruelty and brutality.”\n\n9. Khorshid (Sun Children, Majid Majidi, 2020)*\n\nSun Children’s focus is on the street kids of Tehran – children of absent, addicted, or unemployed refugee parents, forced to sell trinkets on trains or buses, work jobs that require manual labour, or compelled to steal, transport drugs, and protect criminals from the police. No stranger to films about young people, the film continues in the tradition of Majidi’s works such as Bæccähâ-ye âsmân (Children of Heaven, 1997) and Rang-e Khodā (The Color of Paradise, 1999), the first two Iranian films nominated for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award. His works have a purity and innocence that allows young people to see images on the screen that have relevance to their life.\n\n10. The Power of the Dog (Jane Campion, 2021)\n\nDirected by Jane Campion, the first female director to win the Palme D’Or, in 1993 for The Piano, The Power of the Dog is a provocative exploration of toxic masculinity and its effect on women and families, a theme that dominated the myth of the Old West in American literature and films for half a century. Based on Thomas Savage’s 1967 novel, the focus is on the relationship between two brothers, both wealthy ranchers: the overbearing Phil Burbank and his laidback brother George, his civility a sharp contrast with his brother’s brazen and bullying demeanour.\n\n*Released in Canada in 2021\n\nHonourable Mention: C’mon C’mon (Mike Mills, 2021)\n\nDisappointments: Benediction (Terence Davies, 2021)\n\nChristopher Small\n\nWriter, filmmaker, and programmer based in Prague, Czech Republic\n\nA 15ª Pedra (The 15th Stone, Rita Azevedo Gomes, 2007)\n\nAquí se construye (o Ya no existe el lugar donde nací) (Under Construction, or the Place I Was Born No Longer Exists, Ignacio Agüero, 2000)\n\nAuksinis flakonas (Golden Flask, Jurgis Matulevičius and Paulius Anicas, 2021)\n\nBanditi a orgosolo (Bandits of Orgosolo, Vittorio de Seta, 1961) 35mm\n\nThe Blunder of Love (Rocco di Mento, 2021) DCP\n\nCharm Circle (Nira Burstein, 2021) DCP\n\nČiary (Lines, Barbora Sliepková, 2021)\n\nDer Untertan (The Kaiser’s Lackey/Man of Straw, Wolfgang Staudte, 1951) 35mm\n\nDiários de Otsoga (The Tsugua Diaries, Maureen Fazendeiro, Miguel Gomes, 2021)\n\nÉ Rocha e Rio, Negro Leo (Riverock, Paula Gaitán, 2020)\n\nEsquirlas (Splinters, Natalia Garayalde, 2020)\n\nGaslight (George Cukor, 1944)\n\nGorbachev.

But for the most part my film-watching took place online, with a few exceptions. Herein follows my favorite films viewed in 2021, in random order.\n\nAttica (Stanley Nelson, 2021) Viewed at Doc Stories, at the 2021 San Francisco International Film Festival. An utterly devastating documentary about the infamous 1971 upstate New York prison uprising. Stanley Nelson masterfully weaves together archival footage with contemporary interviews with survivors of the rebellion and the result is a haunting, incendiary indictment of the police and carceral state. This one stayed with me for a long time.\n\nLa Nuit Des Rois, (Night of the Kings, Philippe Lacôte, 2020) Viewed at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival. Another film about inmates, this time set in the infamous MACA Prison in the Ivory Coast. The film is a fantastical, gritty, and gripping fable about creativity, survival and the power of storytelling.\n\nFaceless (Jennifer Ngo, 2021)Viewed at the 2021 Hawai’i International Film Festival. This documentary follows four anonymous participants in the 2019 Hong Kong protests as they demonstrate for the human rights of citizens in the city. Watching the events documented a year or so after they occurred, with full knowledge of the ultimately futile demands of the protestors, is similar to watching Attica. You know this doesn’t have a happy ending, but you can’t help rooting for the protagonists in their quixotic efforts.\n\nBalsinjehan (Hard Hit, Kim Jang-ju, 2021) Tense and well-crafted, this film is everything you’d want from a South Korean thriller and more. Jo Woo-Jin is outstanding as an ordinary man suddenly facing a bomb crisis, who is forced to go to extremes to save his family from destruction. Heartthrob Ji Chang Wook plays against type as the obsessive antagonist who terrorizes a seemingly innocent family. Along the way the film makes a cogent commentary about South Korea’s crisis of compressed modernity.\n\nZuk Seoi Piu Lau (Drifting, Jun Li, 2021) Viewed at the 2021 International Film Festival Rotterdam. Jun Li’s socio-conscious narrative follows several homeless denizens of Hong Kong as they attempt to retain some semblance of humanity and dignity despite the dire straits of their daily existence. Anchored by Francis Ng’s stunning turn as the ex-con junkie Big-Eye Fai, the film is an empathetic look at the forgotten street dwellers sleeping rough beneath Hong Kong’s glittering skyline.\n\nThe Sparks Brothers (Edgar Wright, 2021)Viewed at the 2021 South by Southwest Festival. Emulating the cheeky and off-kilter attitude of its subjects, the documentary follows brothers Russell and Ron Mael from their childhood in Southern California through their long and winding musical career as pop duo Sparks. I’ve always been a fan of Sparks and their unique and twisted pop stylings, led by Russell Mael’s dramatic and operatic high tenor and Ron Mael’s sophisticated keyboards and songwriting. Throughout the film, their wit and intelligence shine through.\n\nThe Velvet Underground (Todd Haynes, 2021) I loved the way Todd Haynes remixed classic experimental movies and treated them like found footage. Shirley Clarke, Maya Deren, Stan Brakhage and many others are all part of the mashup. It’s hilarious, ironic and horrifying that he uses those films just like we 90s kids used old educational movies back in the day. To the average viewer, those clips may be just as anonymous and meaningless as educational films. But, some experimental film acolytes got a bit bent out of shape over the irreverence of it all. Turnabout is fair play, I say.\n\n7 days (Roshan Sethi, 2021)\n\nViewed at the 2021 Hawai’i International Film Festival. A charming and amusing little romcom about a pair of strangers thrown together at the start of COVID-19 lockdowns in the US. Lead actors Karan Soni and Geraldine Viswanathan deliver spot-on comic performances. Nothing is quite as it appears at the start of this entertaining tale about two ABCDs (American-Born Confused Desi) who meet on a blind date set up by their parents. Traditional expectations about love, arranged marriage, family obligations and compatibility are turned on their head.\n\nSau Gyun Jin (Hand-Rolled Cigarette, Chan Kin Long, 2020)\n\nViewed at the 2021 Hawai’i International Film Festival. Hand-Rolled Cigarette updates Hong Kong’s storied gangster films to the 21st century, centering around the uneasy relationship between a Chinese Hong Konger (Gordon Lam Ka-Tung) and a South Asian immigrant (Bipin Karma) who are caught in the middle of various shady activities. Hong Kong cinema, as a rule, tends to ignore minority communities living in the territory. The focus on the South Asian residents of the Chungking Mansions is refreshing and enlightening.\n\nHonorable mentions: Singkeuhol (Sinkhole, Kim Ji-hoon, 2021); Águilas (Kristy Guevara-Flanagan, Maite Zubiaurre, 2021); Red Taxi (anonymous, 2020); Flugt (Flee, Jonas Poher Rasmussen); Qīn’ài de fángkè (Dear Tenant, Cheng Yu-Chieh, 2020); Fanny: The Right to Rock (Bobbi Jo Hart, 2021)\n\nBonus: memorable film viewed for the first time in 2021. Metallica: Some Kind of Monster (Joe Berlinger, Bruce Sinofsky, 2004). Loved this one for humanizing the larger-than-life metal legends during a particularly fraught period in their lives.\n\nMark Spratt\n\nIndependent film distributor and cinephile.\n\nIn a year with a vast number of films seen via streaming links, many of which one is aware have diminished impact in not being seen on a big screen, I’ve chosen today ten which have stuck with me the most, including three which, as a distributor, I’ve paid shall we say a bit more than the usual price of admission to share with others – the best testament I could give?\n\nThe year’s home viewing has also been rich with enhanced access to many festivals and discoveries, such as those from Bologna and Pordenone and troves found on Mubi (the extraordinary films of Sergei Balabanov), and recently the 35mm.online/en site with an amazing restored archive of Polish cinema and the opportunity to see many films from directors such as Wojciech Has, Feliks Falk and more.\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\nAnnette (Leos Carax, 2021)\n\nBabardeală cu Buluc Sau Porno Balamuc (Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, Radu Jude, 2021)\n\nBabi Yar.

They will be included (or not) next year when I see them in cinemas, on home video or via streaming platforms, depending on each case. It was a good year, despite the usual share of disappointments, mediocrities and horrors, whether they were made by established auteurs or by committee, but it is not worthwhile to talk about them. As I always say, maybe the problem is with me for failing to appreciate their merits. This year was unforgettable for me as a cinephile due to discovering the work of Maurice Pialat, Alan Clarke and José Luis Guerín, and I also encountered for the first time many great films by Éric Rohmer, King Vidor and Richard Fleischer when I watched a retrospective of their work at home. In addition to this, I had the great fortune of physically attending the Gijón International Film Festival, where I saw some of the films included on these lists."
