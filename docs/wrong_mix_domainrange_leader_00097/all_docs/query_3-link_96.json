        "text": "The ruling Imperial Japanese military factions of the interwar-WW2 period was a classic example of the \"irrational regime under pressure hypothesis\" that has been rattling around the noonosphere since 9/11/2001.[1] [2]\n\nThe basic concept of the hypothesis is that for certain unstable regimes (or even stable ones with no effective means of resolving internal disputes peacefully, particularly the succession of power) domestic power games are far more important than anything foreign, and that foreigners are only symbols to use in domestic factional power fights.\n\nThe reason \"Irrational Regimes\" become more so under pressure are due to the internal power games of \"I'm more militant than thou\" take over. This militant behavior is driven by the need to show ideological purity and resolve -- \"virtue signaling\" in modern terms -- as it became the primary means of achieving power and gaining resources inside the ruling faction in-group.\n\nThis power-reward process becomes far more important than objective reality. Outside reality is merely a prop or symbol to be used in the internal power games. And as external pressure in terms of objective reality mounts in the form of increasingly angry armed foreigners getting closer, \"Irrational Regimes\" become more so under pressure\n\nThis positive feedback loop of militant behavior in the Intra-Nippon military factional politics lead to the extreme self-defeating militancy that dehumanized the Imperial Japanese state & people in the eyes of the American people and political leadership. Thus leading directly to the events of August 1945.\n\nImperial Japan's Ketsu-Go suicidal fight to the death strategy of 1945, after losing Okinawa, was the ultimate expression of irrational Imperial Japanese militancy in pursuit of an unachievable national policy goal -- maintaining the Japanese imperial system via a post-war armistice rather than unconditional surrender.\n\nU.C. - Santa Barbara historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa has described this factional decision making in enormous detail, in multiple articles and books, trying to establish what the positions of each faction were at each point in the decision process.\n\nShort form:\n\nSurvival of the Imperial House was the only concern to those that made the surrender decision, and they had to consider the military die-hards in that as that faction had a very different agenda.\n\nHirohito et al wanted to surrender on terms which let them stay in office, subject to an American shogunate which they expected would be temporary, and got those terms from the Truman Administration.\n\nThe Emperor and his supporters wanted to avoid an invasion because they believed it meant a coup by the Imperial Japanese Army die-hard faction, and such complete destruction and starvation that the surviving Japanese civilians would kick the Imperial House out after the defeat…plus face a likely Communist takeover following termination of the U.S. occupation.\n\nSo it was a question of the Emperor and the peace faction getting the military die-hards to stand down. That was what the A-Bomb meant - the Imperial Japanese Army wouldn't get a glorious last stand as they'd just all be nuked from a distance.\n\nAnd in this decision making, the A-Bombs, plural, were decisive.\n\nIt is my opinion that the chemical tests of Japanese physicists working for the separate IJA &IJN nuclear programs had detected the difference between the HEU Hiroshima and Nagasaki Plutonium bombs, telling the Imperial Japanese Military that America had two different production methods for making nuclear bombs.\n\nThe Soviet attack was icing on the cake. It gave the Imperial House another argument to use on their military fanatics - that the Communists would conquer the place because the Imperial Japanese Military couldn't defend Yamato. This was an emotional, not rational, argument.\n\nThis is why neither the chiefs of staff of the IJN & IJA provided zero support for the final coup attempt.\n\n[1] The Noonosphere is the whole huge realm of ideas that are current and moving around from person to person. See the history of the concept here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere\n\n[2] The term \"Irrational\" is usually replaced with much less academic, and more derogatory, terms.\n\nWilliam O'Neil,\n\nRegards this --\n\n\"The application of the ULTRA cryptonym to USN COMINT product output belongs to a later date than the brief period of effective IJN at-sea refueling capability and COMINT's actual role in the destruction was less central than he makes it out to have been. Note also that ULTRA was only ever a product cryptonym, not a system one as his statement might be taken to imply.\"\n\nNo.\n\nWe are deep in a Jon Parshall and Anthony P. Tully \"Commander Fuchita's Three Whoppers at Midway\" class moment regards the real history of IJN at sea refueling capability in the Pacific War.\n\nAnd to be frank, most of the big named foundational Pacific War historians, to include both Jon Parshall and Anthony P. Tully now getting to play either the role of Commander Fuchita (I'm looking at you Samuel E. Morison) or the English Language historians who did not talk to the Japanese historians for 15-20 years.\n\nThe list of historical works and authors that Fuquea throws well deserved elbows at for getting the IJN's underway replenishment capability wrong includes the following:\n\no Samuel E. Morison, History of United States Naval Operations in World War II\n\no Clark Reynolds, The Fast Carriers\n\no Gordon W. Prange, At Dawn We Slept, the Untold Story of Pearl Harbor\n\no Paul Dull’s Battle History of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1941–1945)\n\no David C. Evans and Mark R. Peattie, Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887–1941\n\no Jonathan B. Parshall and Anthony P. Tully, Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway\n\nAs for ULTRA and the dates of the extermination of IJN fast tanker UNREP capability, it was all after Midway and the breaking of the JN25 code.\n\nThe following are two paragraphs from the conclusion of David C. Fuquea's article:\n\n\"Conclusion\n\nIn the next twenty-four months of the war, whatever monopoly or superiority\n\nregarding underway refueling the IJN possessed completely disappeared. Japanese\n\nnaval leaders, even after the death of Yamamoto, still understood the critical\n\nimportance of speed and fuel to any plan and, therefore, the need to sustain the\n\nfleet with underway refueling. Yet, in June 1944, at the Battle of the Philippine\n\nSea, the remnants of the Kidō Butai, now under the same Admiral Ozawa who\n\nemployed underway refueling so well during the Indian Ocean operation, sortied\n\nwith only four oilers in support of the Kidō Butai. In October, off to the Battle\n\nof Leyte Gulf, he sailed with only two. Admiral Kurita, well acquainted with the\n\nimportance of oilers at Midway, had none despite carrying the main effort in\n\nthe same battle. Kurita stopped his fleet to refuel in port only 800 miles from\n\nhis objective because underway refueling was no longer a capability for the IJN.\n\nDoctrine still remained. Training and practice conducted early in the war had\n\nperfected the skills. Leaders still understood the need. Yet, the “fast oiler” and\n\ntanker fleet and the specialized equipment they carried was gone.\n\nBy Midway,103 losses included three of the sixty oil-carrying vessels available to\n\nthe IJN six months before. USN submarines and aircraft took two more by the end\n\nof the year. Limited industrial capability turned toward replacing the lost carriers,\n\ncruisers, and destroyers from Midway and the “streetfight” in the Solomons, not\n\noil carriers. In 1943, the IJN lost twenty-four more oil tankers, twenty-two to the\n\ntorpedoes of U.S. submarines. Half of the losses were “fast oilers,” including three\n\nof the seven that had sailed against Hawaii. The following year, as was the case with\n\nthe entire Japanese Navy, the results for underway refueling were worse. Thirty-six\n\noil tankers sank to the bottom, two thirds victims of submarines. In response, the\n\nJapanese could only field three additional vessels. The last nine months of war did\n\nnot leave many targets, but nine additional tankers went down. By war’s end, only\n\nthree of the original sixty oil-carrying vessels available to the IJN in December\n\n1941 still floated. The IJN’s capability, once a monopoly, was shattered.\"\n\nDavid C. Fuquea's article \"Advantage Japan: The Imperial Japanese Navy’s Superior High Seas Refueling Capability\" is a stud, frame and baseboard tear down and remodeling of Pacific War historiography.\n\nThis is a great time for young, up and coming, military history master's and graduate students. The whole of the Asia-Pacific War historiography related to IJN operations from America's 1941 oil embargo through Midway is now up for rewrite and they get to be on the ground floor of doing so.\n\nTo David Silbey, It is quite possible I have the timing of the attempted meeting between Morison and Fletcher wrong. And possibly the location too, because in Black Shoe Admiral, if I remember correctly (I am not at my office, still doing telework), Fletcher did return to the states.\n\nBTW, someone (probably Nimitz but perhaps King) attempted to throw Fletcher a bone in the Downfall operation as one of the naval commanders. But Rich Frank is the guy to check with on that score (or, DM Giangreco in Hell to Pay).\n\nBTW, here is a memory of Fletcher someone whose dad served under him in Adak sent me, I think it captures Fletcher as a person--often lost in all the acrimony directed at him-- quite well:\n\n\"Two vignettes about Adm. Frank Jack Fletcher\n\nMy father, Gabriel Sabat, was one of six Navy personnel in a Communications Security (ComSec) Unit on Adak Island during WW II. He was a radioman who took and sent Morse code and was aware of any number of military secrets at the time.\n\nAdak wasn’t the end of the Earth, but according to a retired USAF Major I knew, “It was pretty darn close to the edge.” Long periods of darkness, howling winds (Williwaws), and isolation left many service people with mental health problems that were recognizable by what came to be called the “Aleutians stare”, a blank look in the eyes of those who were in trouble. My Dad knew one man who committed suicide days before the arrival of his orders to go home.\n\nThis island was, therefore, challenging in many ways in addition to the fact that we were at war and that the Japanese were present on Attu and Kiska at one time.\n\nMy Dad and his buddies in the ComSec Unit always wore knit hats, wool sweaters, boots, peacoats etc. while on duty. My Dad even smoked his pipe at times. In other words, they dressed informally by Navy standards. Admiral Fletcher set the tone for this, recognizing that there was a time and place for strict military decorum regarding dress and a time and place when there is no point on insisting on that sort of thing. Adak Island was among the latter category because he wanted his men to do their important jobs without his creating what to him were relatively silly demands given the conditions. Morale was key and Adm. Fletcher recognized the big and small pictures of fighting a war and how morale mattered so much to our success.\n\nAt some point, a Marine Lieutenant arrived and gave orders that all Navy personnel will heretofore be attired in dress uniforms while on duty. To the guys in the ComSec Unit, this was rather beyond the pale and so they contacted Adm. Fletcher and asked about this new order. In no time at all, the Admiral had the Marine Lieutenant on the “horn” and essentially told the young man, new to Adak Island, that no such orders will be issued to people under his command and that he, Admiral Fletcher, is the person who will make such decisions. There was no screaming or shouting, but just very clear and direct speech that the young Marine seemed to understand immediately.\n\nIn this and in other ways, Admiral Fletcher was a sailor’s sailor.\n\nAnother story my Dad told me involved a time when he and the Admiral met to discuss something (I don’t recall if Dad told me the subject matter, but I don’t recall what it was in any case). They were walking together outside when another sailor, collecting trash, shouted at the Admiral, “Hey Mac, where do I dump this shit?” Now, Admiral Fletcher was wearing a knit hat and a peacoat with no indication of his rank anywhere in sight. This was rather typical of the way he dressed most of the time on Adak. The Admiral replied, “I don’t know, I’m on a different detail.” My Dad had to choke back his laughter.\n\nLater that day, my Dad ran into that same sailor and said, “Do you know who you were talking to when you had that trash?” Of course, the sailor said, “No, should I have known?” My Dad said, “I guess you didn’t realize that you were talking to Admiral Fletcher.” The guy almost fainted with embarrassment.\n\nEven though Frank Jack Fletcher, was a Vice Admiral in the U.S. Navy, a veteran of the Battle of the Coral Sea, of Midway, a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor decades earlier, and therefore someone who could easily “pull rank” on someone and be a stickler for every detail no matter how insignificant or arbitrary, demand all sorts of faux expressions of respect from each and every subordinate, he did not do so. Rather, he expected competence, devotion to duty, to the larger goals of the war effort, and engaged the sailors who worked under his command with respect and honored their efforts. In so doing, he earned their undying respect.\n\nI cannot tell you exactly how many times I heard my Dad sing the praises of Adm. Fletcher, but I remember hearing about him when I was a boy, a teenager, a young adult, and a middle aged parent. That kind of respect and admiration is literally priceless because it cannot be bought. It must be earned, and Adm. Fletcher surely earned that and then some.\n\nWhen I watched your lecture about him, I thought to myself that I needed to tell you about these small, but large, moments that are part of the defining character, the authenticity, the modesty, of Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher.\"\n\nvr, John\n\nI have a longstanding interest in Pearl Harbor and teach a seminar on it every year, so I’ve been enjoying this thread; given that I’m a historian of Japan during this period, I thought I might be able to say something worthwhile regarding Japanese perspectives on the decision to go to war (or, more accurately, expand the war from China to Southeast Asia and the Pacific).\n\nAs one might expect, this is a subject of enduring interest in Japan and there is quite a bit of good scholarship on the topic although, as is true in general of Japanese historical scholarship, very little of it is ever translated into English. The image of irrational army officers ignoring unpleasant realities and leading Japan off a cliff has been a potent one inside and outside of Japan, but it’s not one that holds up well to close scrutiny. The more accurate—and far more interesting—picture is one of rational elite staff officers (and other government officials) who understood perfectly well the gravity of the decision they were facing, but nevertheless convinced themselves they had no real choice but to follow through on the decisions that had brought them to this precipice (i.e., the decision to construct a “new order” in Asia) and that there was at least some possibility of success if events progressed in their favor (e.g., continued German success being a key factor). One of the more interesting recent contributions to this understanding comes from an economic historian, Makino Kuniaki, who located portions of a report prepared by leading economists and bureaucrats at the request of the army, a document that was long thought to have been destroyed. Here’s the reference for interested parties who read Japanese:\n\n牧野邦昭(Makino Kuniaki)『経済学者たちの日米開戦―秋丸機関「幻の報告書」の謎を解く』(The Economists' Outbreak of the Japan-US War: Solving the Mystery of the Akimaru Organization’s “Phantom Report”)新潮選書2018.\n\n(Akimaru refers to Lt. Colonel Akimaru Jirō, who oversaw the research project; Akimaru studied in the economics department at Tokyo Imperial University and was close to many reformist bureaucrats and intellectuals, including some of the country’s leading economists)\n\nThose involved in the report, such as the lead economist Arisawa Hiromi, long claimed their conclusions regarding the vast gap in economic power between Japan and the US had been not only ignored but also destroyed by army officers (specifically, Arisawa blamed chief of staff General Sugiyama Hajime), because it ran counter to the agreed upon national policy to construct the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and adhere to the Tripartite Alliance, even if that led to war with the US and Great Britain. However, Makino makes a compelling case that the army in fact requested and accepted a frank, honest assessment of the economic situation, and that the reason they paid little attention to the part about the differential in economic power is because it reconfirmed (with more number crunching) what they already understood to be true. What they found more interesting was the report’s argument that further successful prosecution of submarine warfare in the Atlantic could contribute significantly to the Axis objective of forcing Britain's surrender, which would place the US in a difficult position from which to prosecute the war. This, too, was not new, since relying on continued German success was already a key, and very risky, part of war planning, but it was welcome reinforcement of their inclination to take that risk. (Incidentally, it’s also interesting how much of this was commonly understood not only in government circles, but also publicly discussed at the time in mass magazine and newspaper articles, including by some of the men involved in these reports.) There’s more to Makino’s account than that, but these are the major points that I recall off hand (hopefully with accuracy). Ultimately, I think one can say that by the fall of 1941 many Japanese leaders, in uniform and out, had convinced themselves that giving in to American demands to back away from the New Order in East Asia (and thus give up on Japanese autarky over the region), was synonymous with a humiliating reduction of the Japanese Empire to second or third-rate status. There are other important factors, and not everyone felt this way, but I think it is an important part of Japanese perceptions of the crisis they faced.\n\nMakino’s also book reminds me of a much earlier account of the thinking of army staff officers and the question of rationality by the historian Hatano Sumio; early in his career, Hatano knew and worked with some former staff officers in the war research office of the old Self-Defense Forces institute and couldn’t reconcile what he knew of them personally with the widely held image of irrational army officers who recklessly dragged the nation into a hopeless war. It’s been quite a while since I read his account, but again, if I recall correctly, the upshot is that they understood the gravity of what they were proposing, but nevertheless convinced themselves that this was necessary or unavoidable, and that some sort of victory was not impossible. A key component of this process was an underestimation of American ability to mobilize for and prosecute total war for the amount of time it would take to achieve victory. The reference for Hatano’s book is as follows:\n\n波多野澄雄(Hatano Sumio)『幕僚たちの真珠湾』(The Staff Officers’ Pearl Harbor) 朝日選書1991.\n\nFinally, regarding Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku and the “Treaty Faction”: After the war, Yamamoto was often portrayed as part of the Treaty Faction, perhaps largely because of some of his personal associations (e.g., Vice-Admiral Hori Teikichi) and his later opposition to the Tripartite Alliance and desire to avoid war with the US and Great Britain. However, the best recent research on Yamamoto makes it clear that, in the early 1930s, at least, he was actually closer to the “Fleet Faction” in his stance on the London Naval Treaty. A member of Japan’s delegation, Yamamoto was strongly opposed to the prospective agreement and, in one famous incident, physically threatened Finance Ministry official Kaya Okinori for insistently emphasizing the fiscal consequences of trying to build too many warships (specifically, he told Kaya to shut up or he was going to smack him). However, once the cabinet of Hamaguchi Osachi made its decision to sign the treaty, Yamamoto enforced discipline within the delegation and, after returning home, he did not speak out publicly against the treaty or participate in criticism of the government for supposedly infringing on “the right of supreme command.” He thus rejected the politicization of the treaty characteristic of those who led the Fleet Faction (e.g., Admiral Katō Hiroharu [Kanji]). He also appears to have been unhappy with the subsequent retiring of Treaty Faction officers, including men to whom he was close, such as Hori. If Yamamoto had actually been aligned with the Treaty Faction he, too, would likely have been forced into retirement. Ultimately, it seems best to say that he wasn’t aligned with either faction, which helps explain why he was still around to command the Combined Fleet when it attacked Pearl Harbor. For discussions of Yamamoto and these divisions within the navy over the London Naval Treaty, see 田中宏巳(Tanaka Hiromi)『山本五十六(Yamamoto Isoroku)』人物叢書、吉川弘文館2010, pp. 52-64, and 相澤淳(Aizawa Kiyoshi)『海軍の選択―再考 真珠湾への道(The Navy’s Choice: A Reconsideration of the Road to Pearl Harbor)』中公叢書2002, pp. 18-45.\n\nRoger Brown\n\nProfessor of Modern Japanese History\n\nSaitama University, Japan\n\nMany thanks to Prof. Roger Brown for this very valuable contribution.\n\nArisawa Hiromi (1896-1988) was a very interesting and influential figure in Japanese economics. He was what might be called a pragmatic Marxist who taught a number later-prominent economists at Tokyo U. until purged by the Home Office for his communist connections in 1938 — which did nothing to prevent him being called upon by both Prime Minister Konoe and the Army to aid in planning for the coming war. And after the war he played a central role in working out the problems of economic recovery and then of Japan's industrial takeoff.\n\nThere is quite an interesting article on his economic involvement:\n\nGao, Bai. “Arisawa Hiromi and His Theory for a Managed Economy.” Journal of Japanese Studies 20, no. 1 (1994): 115–53. doi:10.2307/132786.\n\nRegarding the study for the Army, Gao reports (citing sources by and about Arisawa):\n\nOn the eve of the Pacific War, Arisawa learned about Wassily W. Leontieff’s input-output analysis in the course of an investigation on national economic power organized by the Japanese Army. ... The inves­tigation aimed at providing an objective foundation for the Army to make a judgment about whether Japan’s economic power could afford another war in addition to the one with China. The more than 20 economists involved in this investigation were divided into four groups, focusing re­spectively on Japan, Britain and the United States, Germany, and the So­viet Union. Arisawa Hiromi was head of the Britain-U.S. group. The con­clusion drawn by Arisawa and his colleagues in this investigation was negative, namely, that Japan could not afford to wage a second war. Even if it might be successful at the initial stage, it would be impossible to win the war in the long run. Nevertheless, the high-ranking officials of the army refused to accept this conclusion and they burned all the relevant materials together with the report itself. [pp. 131-32.]\n\nIt's good news that at least some of the materials from this study have survived.\n\nDuring the course of my four decades of service in and with the U.S. government on military and related matters I dealt frequently with policy-level officers and officials in a number of foreign governments (including Japan), both friendly and otherwise. This led me to conclude that the most useful perspectives for understanding the thinking and action choices of people in ministries, general staffs, etc., are those of social psychology and sociology. That is to say that such people indeed are \"much more simply human than otherwise,\" as Harry Stack Sullivan long ago insisted, with their outlooks and actions influenced far more by institutional imperatives than by cultural traits. Isolated individuals may follow courses that are truly irrational but institutional leaders scarcely ever do.\n\nThe organizational imperatives that they pursue, however rationally, may themselves depart quite strongly from economic or political \"rationality.\" That has been true of almost all decisions to initiate wars for many centuries, and it was true of Japan's decision to make war on essentially the entire world (as it turned out). It would not be difficult, I believe, to prove this formally in terms of mathematical game theory.\n\nIt is also true, of course, that bad information may lead rational policymakers to pick poor choices even in pursuit of objectives that are on their face quite rational. There was unquestionably some element of this on both sides in 1941.\n\nGiven the enduring interest in the subject of how and why the United States and Japan came to armed conflict in the Pacific War I have repackaged a set of brief essays I wrote a few years ago under the the title of \"Steady on Course for Pearl Harbor 1851-1941,\" posted at\n\nhttp://analysis.williamdoneil.com/Steady%20on%20Course%20for%20Pearl%20Harbor%201851-1941%20-%20WDO.pdf\n\nMy thanks to William O’Neill for his post which, like always, is informative and worthwhile. I agree about the overlap of the rational and irrational in policy making (if that’s the right way to put it), both in Japan in this period and many other places and times.\n\nBut a bit more about the report in question: One of the arguments Makino is making is that, contrary to Arisawa’s postwar recollections (that were echoed by others), the report was not burned in 1941 by irritated, bullheaded army officers. To begin with, a copy of one portion (that regarding US economic power) was found in his own personal papers after he died in the late 1980s. That discovery became the basis for an NHK program on the topic a few years later (for those who are unaware, NHK is something like the BBC here). Within the past decade Makino has found several more volumes of the report (e.g., the one on Germany), and these sources spurred him to write his book. Then there are problems with Arisawa’s testimony regarding, for instance, who supposedly ordered it destroyed (e.g., in one recollection, instead of Sugiyama, he said it was General Umezu Yoshijirō, even though Umezu was in Manchuria in 1941) and, moreover, according to Makino, to date there is no other corroborating evidence of such an order or act from surviving primary sources or in other postwar memoirs, despite the fact that destruction of such a major report would have surely made waves in both the Army Ministry (to which Akirmaru’s group was attached) and the General Staff. And again, as stated in my earlier post, Makino makes a good case that the economic content of the report wouldn’t have been remarkable or sensitive enough for the army to want to destroy it in the first place. But more damning for Arisawa’s account is the existence of references to the report being utilized in other army documents produced in 1942. Ultimately, the most likely reason there are few extant copies of the report is that most of them were burned together with mountains of other material in August 1945 (this is me speculating—I don’t remember if Makino says this).\n\nRoger Brown\n\nResponding to the sensible suggestion made by David Silbey, I propose to respond in this thread to a proposal made by John Kuehn under the heading of Pearl Harbor as History.\n\nHe proposes, in part:\n\nBased on some of things written by Will ONeil, Roger Brown, Tom Wildenberg, et al. it seems there is a need to update the original classic on this sort of thing re: Pearl Harbor and Japan's widening of the Greater East Asian War. This classic was:\n\nDorothy Borg and Sumpei Okamoto, editors., Pearl Harbor as History: Japanese-American Relations, 1931 – 1941. New York: Columbia University Press, 1973.\n\nPerhaps a new Pearl Harbor as History edition is in order? At the time the scholarship was cutting edge, but no longer, e.g. Sadao Asada revised his conclusions in his original essay for this set and how even those revisions (in From Mahan to Pearl Harbor) are themselves in need of furthe revision if Roger Brown et al are correct (and I think they are).\n\nFinally, there was something along these lines recently that came out of University of Kansas, an anthology entitled Beyond Pearl Harbor, editors Beth Brown and David Farber (U. Kansas Press, 1919).\n\nIt's a very interesting proposal. Published nearly half a century ago, the 743-page Borg/Okamoto volume remains the towering monument of the field. For me it was the introduction to serious thinking about how the tragedy of the Pacific War came to be, and I expect it was for many other members too, or at least the older ones. Many collections have followed, including the one edited by Beth Bailey (not Brown) and David Farber that John refers to, but none even approach the stature of that first one.\n\nIn the meantime, a group of Japanese scholars under the leadership of Tsunoda Jun had assembled the massive Taiheiyō Sensō e no michi, kaisen gaikō shi which formed the basis for five large volumes published under the leadership of James William Morley as Japan's Road to the Pacific War, comprising translations of the bulk of the Japanese text together with excellent summaries and commentaries by the volume editors, altogether running to about 2,000 pages.\n\nBoth of these efforts were on a massive scale. In the days when I was in a position to dispense government money for research efforts I spent a pleasant few hours with one of those who had participated in the Borg/Okamoto effort and among other things heard some of the details. They had obtained foundation funding which among other things had paid for a conference bringing virtually all of the participants together in a Japanese resort, where many matters were worked out. Moreover, there was a staff of administrative people who coordinated all the myriad details. Even with all this there were some gaps that could not be filled, but overall the book is far better integrated than most of scholarly collections I have occasion to review. It is unrealistic, it seems to me, to contemplate an updating of Borg/Okamoto without considering where the resources will come from. And of course there is no realistic possiblity of bringing out a new edition of a work whose authors have almost all passed from the scene.\n\nIt is also important to consider what the focus is to be. The implicit assumption of Pearl Harbor as History is that the war was at its root a clash between Japan and the United States, with the actions of other powers playing only subsidiary roles in bringing it about. So two questions arise: Is the thesis of a predominately bilateral conflict as compelling now as it was then? If so, have the discoveries made in the interm provided a basis for a wholesale revision of our views within this frame? I would submit that the answer is negative to both questions.\n\nNow as I have said repeatedly over at least the past three decades, I see it as much more productive to break out of the bilateral frame and look at the Pacific War not as a separate conflict but rather as an integral aspect of a global one. As has often been observed the conflicts at the two ends of the Eurasian Continent were indeed almost wholly independent of one another in military terms. But if we are to follow in the path of Borg and Okamoto (and Tsunoda and Morley) to discern how it all came about we cannot well escape, in my view, the recognition that it all was part of one fabric on the level of politics and grand strategy. At very least, anyone wishing to reject this perspective owes an explanation of why.\n\nThe record to support study along these lines is not fully in view. There is much we do not yet know about how the Chaing Kai-sheck government conducted its affairs, for instance, and even more lacunae in the Soviet record. But we do have a very great deal more than was known fifty years ago. (I will remark that as a student of the First World War I am very well aware that quite important material regarding its origins is still coming slowly into the light — and of course that there are mysteries that may never be resolved.)\n\nFinally, I have to question how far this all belongs to the field of military history, properly speaking.\n\nWith that I shall rest oars and await the wisdom of others.\n\nRegarding historiography and the global context: The importance of the international context and developments in Europe to the origins of the war in Asia and the Pacific is a central theme in the work of Akira Iriye (e.g., The Origins of the Second World War in Asia & the Pacific, Longman, 1987). This perspective has certainly shaped my understanding of the subject and how I teach it. European affairs had a major impact on decisions being made in Japan on what foreign policy was in the empire’s best interests and, relatedly, affected the balance of political power inside Japan. For instance, the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939 took the wind from the sails of pro-Axis “reformist” (kakushin) forces, whereas German successes in the spring of 1940 energized them and helped bring down the cabinet of Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, which was not enthusiastic about an alliance with the Axis powers. The new (second) cabinet of Prince Konoe Fumimaro made that a priority again and concluded the Tripartite Alliance in September of 1940. Meanwhile, Konoe’s government initiated the movement to create a new political order that would transform the nation into a one-party state similar to those of Japan’s new allies (the reformists failed in this endeavor, despite managing to create the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, or IRAA).\n\nA bit more on Yamamoto and the Fleet Faction/Treaty Faction issue: I cited recent research, but I should note that the observation regarding Yamamoto’s hardline in the early 1930s was also made decades ago by Hata Ikuhiko, one of the doyens of Japanese military history (Ref: 秦郁彦『昭和史の軍人たち(Military Men of Showa History)』文藝春秋1983).\n\nAnd since I mentioned Yonai (Yamamoto’s close associate in the final years before the Pearl Harbor): Yonai also was not clearly aligned with either side in the naval treaty dispute and seems to have been held in high regard by both camps. Incidentally, it also appears that there were rough seas ahead for some members of the Fleet Faction after the 2.26 Incident of 1936, when Admiral Nagano Osami assigned Yonai and Yamamoto to important posts and anti-treaty Admirals Katō Hiroharu and Suetsugu Nobumasa were placed on the retired roster (Katō died in 1939, while the politically ambitious Suetsugu served in Konoe’s second and third cabinets in civilian posts and in the IRAA before dying in 1944).\n\nOne quick note on factions and labels: These were often provided by journalists covering political and military affairs and thus shouldn’t be taken as gospel. They can be helpful, but can also oversimplify and perhaps mislead. I’m still trying to bring myself up to speed on the navy, but I have done some research on the bureaucracy in this period of time, and specifically those in the Home Ministry who were labelled then—and ever since—as “new bureaucrats”; yet they didn’t call themselves that and don’t appear to have thought of themselves in this manner.\n\nRoger Brown\n\nSaitama University\n\nWell, if this is a dead horse, we certainly do seem to keep beating it! This reply is for William O'Neill. I'm happy to accept criticism but in this instance I'm honestly confused by what you mean when you say I'm \"looking through the wrong end of the telescope.\" I've downloaded _Undefended_ to my Kindle and am reading it with interest. To paraphrase Bogart, \"We'll always have Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nMy perspective is linked to the methodology of \"scenario-based forecasting.\" Not something we saw a lot of during my 20-year career in the US Intelligence Community, early 80s to the \"early oughts.\" It involves looking a plausible future events and asking, \"if they're going to do it, how would they do it?\" and deriving indicators from answering that question. Re. 9/11, for example, if the IC suspected that al-Qaeda might hijack airplanes and attack buildings (see the declassified 6 August 2001 PDB) we might have derived useful warning indicators by posing the question of how they might do it. The famous FBI \"Phoenix Memo\" got the methodology right but the target set wrong, and in any case never got the high-level attention necessary to figure out how al-Q would carry out such attacks. The IC was enslaved by inductive reasoning, and \"need to know\" was the final nail in the coffin.\n\nSo let it be with Pearl Harbor. If, as you suggest, everyone knew that Japan would probably carry out a surprise attack, the Navy certainly knew Pearl Harbor was a plausible target (recall Admiral Richardson's ill-timed warning) and it should not have been impossible figure out how they would do it. It would obviously involve aircraft carriers, of which the IJN had plenty, and the North Pacific was the most likely avenue of attack. We'd already demonstrated that in one of the Navy's \"Fleet Problems.\" So . . . focus air search to the northwest of Hawaii, do a rush job to get radar up & running on a 24/7 basis, and maintain readiness to go to General Quarters on a short-notice basis. Examining why this wasn't done leads me to conclude that Admiral Kimmel and General Short headed the list of those responsible for the Pearl Harbor disaster.\n\nWe're all \"second guessers\" at this stage. So, how should I turn the telescope around?\n\nHere I plan to stick with 12/7, rather than 9/11.\n\nPeter Swartz and I had several exchanges while we were both in naval uniform, served together for some years at the Center for Naval Analyses, and have long been friends. Possibly Ralph Hitchens got some secret sauce, but I believe I understand Peter's points reasonably well, as well as the related ones of my recently-deceased friend Ed Smith. While their notions, amounting generally to Bayesian analysis, can indeed be very useful in identifying critical indicators, one must be wary of the wrong end of the telescope.\n\nLooking through the wrong end of the telescope (a phrase I believe I recall hearing Peter Swartz use in such matters) involves a priori narrowing your list of threats and then simply looking for critical indicators relating to them. Thus in 1941, CDR Hitchens, as Kimmel's Fleet Intelligence Officer, might have counseled Fleet commander that the threat was that the Japanese would mass 6 carriers in a single great task force, sortie them from the Kuriles and steam eastward in radio silence to a point 250 nmi or so north of Pearl Harbor, launching a maximum-effort strike at about dawn. He would then have derived the critical indicators for such a strike and advised the admiral of the need to keep watch on them. But what if CDR Hitchens' foresight was not as certain in 1941 as his hindsight in 2020? Looking through the other end of the telescope he might have seen a number of other threat options, multiplying the potential indicators and the resources needed to watch them.\n\nIn fact, the record suggests that Kimmel and his staff did follow a broadly similar procedure. But motivated reasoning crept in unobserved, as it very, very frequently does in such situations. Kimmel was responsible for defending the fleet and was mindful of this, but he was much more focused on preparing the fleet for offensive operations. And while he surely understood, in the abstract, that failing to defend the fleet in the face of a Japanese attack could vitiate its offensive potential, in fact he focused on training and readiness to the virtual exclusion of defense.\n\nPace Ralph Hitchens' assertion that the North Pacific route was the only option that need be considered, there were strong arguments as seen at that time for a sortie from the fleet anchorage at Truk, which would have presented many advantages (and which the IJN planners did indeed consider carefully). The First Air Fleet (Kido Butai) could all have sailed by that route, or could have divided hits forces between the two axes. Clearly, this would have presented further difficulties for surveillance.\n\nIn practice, Kimmel and RADM Patrick Bellinger, commanding his patrol wings, were reluctant to mount standing long-distance patrols for fear of the effects on the matériel and personnel readiness of forces that would play a critical part in the fleet's offensive operations.\n\nStarting 8 December and for four years thereafter it was the rule throughout PacFlt that ships in harbor set Condition I(AA) at the beginning of civil twilight and continuing for half an hour after dawn (and similarly at dusk). If this had been started a few days earlier the attacking raids would have been met with a great volume of AA fire which at very least would have seriously degraded their bombing accuracy. But again Kimmel was concerned about the effects on readiness for offensive operations.\n\nI go on in this vein at some length in Undefending Pearl Harbor. And yes, I do conclude that Kimmel and Short were the goats-in-chief. (This has earned me a very sharp and even abusive rebuke from one of Kimmel's grandsons, who maintains that the admiral should not only have his name cleared and rank restored but be honored for his unblemished service.)"
