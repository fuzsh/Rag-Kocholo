        "text": "Gerd Fenchel&#39;s first publication about the psychology of human interaction was in 1951 (Fenchel, Monderer, & Hartley, 1951). And now, fifty-five years later, with his recent book, Psychoanalytic Reflections on Love and Sexuality , we have the benefit of Fenchel&#39;s years of teaching, treating and scholarship on sexuality, intimacy, gender, culture, spirituality, philosophy, art and psychoanalysis. Fenchel&#39;s range of knowledge is reminiscent of Freud, with his broad European view of humanity. It is a rare scope of scholarship in this age of over specialization and reductionism. Fenchel weaves through the history of human passions and beliefs as an orchestral conductor of ideas. Fenchel introduces themes from art, mythology and science and then zooms into the primitive fantasies of the unconscious. It is his grand lecture on &quot;the ways of love, the &#39;meaning,&#39; as it were of our humanity.&quot; Science is based on experimentation, verifiable observations and theore...\n\nVolume details and firt page of the article. The Volume is available here: https://www.routledge.com/Reading-Desire-in-a-New-Generation-of-Japanese-Women-Writers-A-Special/Cornyetz-Copeland/p/book/9781032437330 This book explores desire through the work of a new generation of Japanese women writers, in response to the increased attention these writers have received following the release of their work in the English language. The contributions explore a wide range of theoretical approaches and psychoanalytic interpretations to \"reading\" a new generation of Japanese women writers’ relationships to identity, sex/gender, and desire. Through dealing with female spaces, maternal roles, gendered bodies, or resistant speech acts, the book uncovers the overarching theme of desire – desire for language, touch, and recognition. Focusing on authors who have previously been underrepresented in English-language scholarship, the book highlights the diverse nature and the important synergies of writing by women in the last few decades. Addressing experimental and nonconforming authors whose works challenge gender and culture expectation as well as Orientalist myths, this will be a valuable resource for students and scholars of Asian literature, Japanese culture, and Asian studies.\n\nThe enjoyment of women, both in the sense of object and subject, is a powerful political and cultural construct. My doctoral dissertation, submitted to Oxford University in 2003, explores the fantasy of women's sexual enjoyment in philosophy, psychoanalytic theory, and popular culture. If offers a sustained critical engagement with the work of thinkers such as Slavoj Žižek, Otto Weininger, and Jacques Lacan, as well as the art and literature of Michel Houellebecq, Michael Haneke, and David Lynch. It investigates how the fantasy of feminine enjoyment manifests itself in Western intellectual and popular culture, and analyzes the ethical and political consequences this fantasy has on the real-life perception of and response to sexual violence. While not attempting to assess or present the “truth” of female enjoyment, this work exposes how the “enjoying woman” fantasy is itself an ideological fantasy that structures the hegemonic field of Western liberalism, bringing it perilously close to its self-avowed opposite, Islamic fundamentalism. Žižek's Marxist-Lacanian syncretism is valuable to feminist theory and to ethical theory more broadly because it politicizes the violent enjoyment of racism and other prejudices; however, Žižek’s theory disappointingly fails to assist in the politicization of sexual violence because of its reliance on the Lacanian fantasy of the enjoying woman. The field of Western liberal hegemonic ideology is not characterized only or primarily by capitalism but also by the depoliticization of sexual violence. The fantasy of the enjoying woman attempts to place “jouissance féminine” beyond or outside this field, and in so doing guarantees the perpetuation of that field. This work is an attempt to expose the violence and resignation that structures the fantasy of feminine enjoyment, and an attempt to re-politicize sexual violence by breaking with the theoretical and cultural coordinates of its ideological field."
