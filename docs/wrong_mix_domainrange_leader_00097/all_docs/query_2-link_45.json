        "text": "Concepts to Consider for the Lesson\n\nIn this Lesson, we see the birth of the modern oil industry. I say “modern” because fossil fuels and hydrocarbons have been in use for thousands of years. We learned that what defines this new era was driven by several factors- the growth of the “business” aspect, the advent of new technologies and efficiencies, and the shift to “rock oil” or oil recovered by drilling as compared to finding seeps and skimming off the surface. In other words, we started digging for it rather than stumbling onto it. Another fact defining the “modern” oil industry was the incredible diversification in uses. We tend to think of fossil fuels as mainly for heating and transportation, but those uses are relatively recent arrivals to the story. The early years were focused on oil as a source of lighting, as a lubricant, and to an extent, for medicinal purposes. In regard to efficiencies, the rapid evolution from horse-drawn carriages carrying barrels to railroads to seafaring tankers completely altered the dynamics and economics of the business.\n\nThe textbook frames these aspects as themes- oil as the rise of modern capitalism; oil as a commodity important enough to impact politics and national strategies, and as something that permeates society so thoroughly that we are in what the book calls the age of “Hydrocarbon Man.” This short half-century from the mid to late 1800s saw this industry go from its birth to unseating coal as “king,” and making itself one of the world’s most important commodities even to this day. As we will see as we go further into the textbook, many of the characteristics of the industry back then still exist and occur today. We will also see how we got to be where we are today.\n\nHowever, the focus of the first few chapters actually highlights another effect altogether of the oil industry and that is how it shaped and molded the business world as a whole and helped define the era of the giants of the industry. The oil industry taught us many things about the general aspects of being successful in business. We learned that it takes an immense risk, confidence in convictions, patience, and tolerance for failure or at best, long delays between successes. Without this mindset, the giants of their day, most exemplified by Rockefeller, would not have been able to create what they did. Unlike typical manufacturing, in the oil industry, you need to go to where it is. You also need to move it great distances to get it from where it is to where it is needed, with the intermediate elements of processing and refining. It is truly amazing then that it was the oil industry and not typical manufacturing, that was the early pioneer of fully integrated and multinational giants.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n\nRecall course concepts relating to the history and development of the oil industry in America and throughout the world\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the role of oil in relation to pivotal events in history\n\nDiscuss the role of oil in business applications, global markets, conflicts, energy security, and various unconventional applications\n\nWhat is due for Lesson 1?\n\nThis lesson will take us one week to complete.

Recall in Lesson 1 the diversification of uses for oil, and the meteoric growth of Standard Oil. We saw in Lesson 1 that with this rapid growth came great success. But brewing underneath that success was the focus of the competition and others' suspicion of ulterior motives.\n\nAs with Lesson 1, the readings teach us two stories in parallel. The evolution of the oil industry itself, and the oil industry as an example of the evolution of capitalism as a whole. For example, the appearance of competitors, the obsession with “cutting Standard Oil down to size,” and the expansion of markets. There are two ways to succeed in business- get a bigger piece of the pie, but also see what you can do to make the pie bigger! Consider what you read about the early days of the oil industry to what you see today with electronics, social media, and the entertainment industry.\n\nAnother significant takeaway from the readings in Lesson 2 is that what may seem like a solid business that will last forever rarely does. In a short time, the oil industry almost disappeared simply because of the invention of electric lighting. It was only by sheer luck that the automobile came along at the same time and innovation found a way to utilize oil products for that market. The key was the ability of the oil industry to see what was happening and find a way to adapt. The oil industry never stopped innovating since then, and today, the uses of crude oil products are staggering. A common misconception by society is that if we can eliminate the automobile, there will no longer be a need to drill for oil and gas. Many people will be quite disappointed if they knew how many day-to-day household necessities come from crude oil products. So even if phased out of transportation or power generation, there will be a lot more innovation needed to phase out its other uses entirely.\n\nWith Lesson 2 we will discuss the loss of oil markets with the invention of electric light and the almost simultaneous regaining of new markets with the development of the automobile. It also discusses the decline in the dominance of Standard Oil with the discovery of oil in other parts of America and the subsequent emergence of competitors. But at the same time we will also discuss the growing public hatred against big oil, and the cry for the Federal government to break up Standard Oil as a way of overcoming its monopoly. Concurrent with the desire to break up the monopoly that was Standard Oil, the concept of the major international oil company was born. The rise of Royal Dutch/Shell as a major international oil company and the fall of the Russian oil industry will also be discussed.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n\nRecall course concepts relating to the Standard Oil Trust and to the “Oil Wars”\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the role of oil in relation to pivotal events in history\n\nDiscuss the role of oil in business applications, global markets, conflicts, energy security, and various unconventional applications\n\nWhat is due for Lesson 2?\n\nThis lesson will take us one week to complete. Please refer to the Course Syllabus for specific time frames and due dates. Specific directions for the assignment below can be found within this lesson.\n\nLesson 2 Checklist Activity Location Submitting Your Work Read The Prize: Chapters 4, 5, & 6 (select sections), and The Quest: Chapters 2 & 4 (selected sections) No Submission Discuss Participate in the Yellowdig discussion Canvas Complete Complete Quiz 1 Canvas\n\nQuestions?\n\nEach week an announcement is sent out in which you will have the opportunity to contribute questions about the topics you are learning about in this course. You are encouraged to engage in these discussions. The more we talk about these ideas and share our thoughts, the more we can learn from each other.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 4 Overview\n\nThe chapter is characterized by additional themes. We see the rapid, and fortuitous transition of the industry from primarily supplying fuel for lighting to now supplying fuel for transportation- mainly for the newly commercially mass-produced automobile. And not a moment too soon because the invention of the electric light completely decimated the oil for lighting business. To this day, fossil fuels are fundamental to transportation of all types. From cars to airplanes to ships, they move because of fossil fuels. The time period also saw the oil industry keep up with rapid industrialization of the economy, with the growing use of fuel oil to power boilers in factories.\n\nThis chapter also highlights that the oil sector was growing, and it was no longer all about Standard Oil. We see the birth of new companies and new producing areas. No longer was Pennsylvania the center of action. During this period Texas and California came online as substantive producing areas. Unlike Pennsylvania, which has faded a bit, places like Texas and California still dominate as major US producing regions. The famous Spindletop in Texas occurred in this period. Spindletop exemplified that despite many lessons learned over time, certain things were done the “old way,” resulting in the same problems. The same issues of over-drilling and uncontrolled production that crashed the industry in Pennsylvania also hurt Spindletop. Unfortunately, those drilling at Spindletop did not learn that production rates must be controlled to maintain reservoir pressure and price stability. An interesting development as the California oil sector evolved in 1900-1911 was the use of science, specifically geology, to be more logical and accurate in searching for oil. The days of finding oil by chance gave way to using science. Geology helped explain how oil forms and where to look for it. Eventually, the “petroleum geologist” became its own profession.\n\nAs to competition, we saw the birth of many new companies that have since become iconic household names today. Shell, Gulf, Sun, and Texaco all came of age during the late 1800’s and early 1900’s. We also saw the establishment of the “integrated company” where a single entity controlled everything from getting oil out of the ground all the way through to refining and distribution.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 4 - The New Century\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nMarkets Lost and Gained\n\nBreakouts\n\nPatillo Higgins' Dream\n\nThe Deal of the Century\n\nSun: \"To Know What to do With It\"\n\n\"Buckskin Joe\" and Texaco\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was happening with the markets at the time?\n\nWhat threatened kerosene’s dominance?\n\nIn addition to Russian & Sumatra Oil, where was new oil was found?\n\nWhat was happening to Standard Oil’s dominance?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 6 Overview\n\nOne tried and true rule of business success, and which is clearly demonstrated in what we see in Chapter 6, is that if you invest in one part of the business, you must invest in other parts to maintain a balance. A supply with no market or way to get the product to market is not very valuable. Similarly, a market with no product quickly collapses. This “supply chain” concept became a household term recently during the COVID and immediate post-COVID period.\n\nThe birth of Royal Dutch-Shell, one of today’s largest and most iconic oil giants, illustrates this concept well. As you will read in the chapter, the evolution of Royal Dutch-Shell was a series of mergers, deals, market manipulations, and conflicts. The goal to integrate all aspects of the business as a way to make it most resilient meant pulling together oil supply, transportation options, and outlets to markets. As you read about the journey from separate Royal Dutch and Shell, through iterations of British Dutch and Asiatic, you will see how things had to adapt in order to bring in the necessary pieces. Shell is a great example of a company at death’s door being reborn as a success story by adapting to new business models and accepting reality. But the Royal Dutch-Shell story also taught us another frustrating reality in that companies continued to be undisciplined in developing fields, and as quickly as areas grew, the reservoirs lost pressure and reserves, and prices crashed due to overproduction.\n\nIn Lesson 1, we focused on the US market in the story of Standard Oil. But covering approximately at the same time period, Lesson 2 tells the story of Royal Dutch-Shell and describes the story of the Russian, European, and Far East oil markets. We must remember that we not only have huge oil reserves in the US, but also in many other parts of the world. Those regions had to go through the evolutionary process, but unlike the US markets, those markets had the added challenge of social unrest, regional wars, and extremely difficult conditions. Russia best exemplifies how social and political unrest and chaos can affect the private sector, global industry. Just because you are not government-run does not mean you are insulated from government conditions.\n\nOne final additional element we learn in Lesson 2, and something we will see continue throughout the rest of the history of the oil industry, is that multinationals were moving more widely among markets. Until now, the US market was dominated by Standard Oil and the Europe/Far East markets was by Royal Dutch-Shell. Standard Oil was known for intruding into other parts of the world, but in Lesson 2 we see Royal Dutch-Shell coming to the US, especially in California and Oklahoma.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 6 - The Oil Wars: The Rise of Royal Dutch, the Fall of Imperial Russia\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe First Step Toward Combination\n\nThe \"British Dutch\" - the Asiatic\n\n\"The Group\" - Samuel Surrenders\n\n\"To America!\"\n\nReturn to Russia\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat does a vertically integrated company do for the oil business?\n\nWhat is required for investment in a new field?\n\nHow can you avoid strategic mistakes?\n\nWhat is something that can cause major oil supply disruptions?\n\nThe Quest\n\nChapter 2 - Caspian Derby\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Oil Kingdom\n\nHistory on Display\n\nChapter 4 - \"Supermajors\"\n\nSections to Read\n\nWere He Alive Today\n\nMajor Themes to Ponder as You Read:\n\nWhat are some similarities and differences between the 1860s oil industry and today?\n\nConcepts to Consider for the Lesson\n\nWe are used to hearing about important oil producing areas around the world. But they did not all come online at the same time. Oil exploration evolved over time, with certain periods of history focusing on specific geographies. In Lesson 2, we studied the development of the markets in Russia, Europe, and the Far East. In Lesson 3, we start to see the expansion into what we now know as the Middle East oil region, one of the most important, and prolific, oil markets in the world. We will discuss the beginnings of oil discovery in the Middle East, specifically in Persia, the clash of British and Persian cultures, and the emergence of Anglo-Persian Oil Company.\n\nThis lesson also covers the changes in the markets as well. Recall changes in Lesson 1 when more uses for oil products were being developed. Then in Lesson 2 was the automobile. Lesson 3 will introduce us to the role of the internal combustion engine and the need for gasoline. It was not that long before where gasoline as a by-product was seen almost as a nuisance, and now it is evolving into its own product in demand.\n\nLesson 3 also reminds that even as new concepts crystallize; some old habits die hard. We still see the up and down aspects of the market with companies oscillating between doing quite well and experiencing imminent collapse. We also still see squabbling among companies, distrust, and cutthroat competition, punctuated with moments of cooperation for the greater good. But we must realize that the “greater good” in many cases meant to ensure their own survival.\n\nAs important as all of that is, one of the most impactful elements of Lesson 3 content is the emergence of oil as a strategic commodity- becoming central to global crisis and military positioning. The uptake of the internal combustion engine and its use of gasoline, combined with the transition from coal to oil, completely changed the face of military readiness and national security. As you will read, it is safe to say that the use and availability of oil drove the progress, and ultimate outcome, of World War I. The transitioning of the Navy from coal to oil is one thing but imagine the rest of the military equipment if they didn’t run on oil and had to use coal!\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n\nRecall course concepts relating to Asian oil development and World War I\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the role of oil in relation to pivotal events in history\n\nDiscuss the role of oil in business applications, global markets, conflicts, energy security, and various unconventional applications\n\nProduce an evaluative statement that justifies your answer to a posed homework question\n\nWhat is due for Lesson 3?\n\nThis lesson will take us one week to complete.

You are encouraged to engage in these discussions. The more we talk about these ideas and share our thoughts, the more we can learn from each other.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 8 Overview\n\nChapter 8 is best characterized by the statement “oil is an instrument of national policy, a strategic commodity”. The British Royal Navy pioneered the connection between oil and military advantage. Prior to this period, the Royal Navy was powered by coal, as most other Navy’s were, including Germany’s. But the Royal Navy had the foresight to switch from coal to oil. The advantages were obvious, both logistically as well as tactically. The Navy would be more mobile, maneuverable, and reliable. And it would operate without having to cart around tons and tons of bulky coal. But with this decision came the negative aspect of needing to ensure a reliable supply. For Britain, access to coal was not a problem, they had an incredible amount within their national borders. Oil on the other hand, was for the most part, sourced from elsewhere. Resolving that conflict took some time and persuasion, but eventually the Navy pivoted to oil. With this decision, the support and pressure from the government, and specifically the military, fell on the oil industry to produce.\n\nIt was clear that the government was not effective or positioned to manage their own oil operations, they had to look to and actually depend on what the big private companies were doing. But being passive observers was not prudent, and we see the beginnings of these public-private partnerships between government and the private sector.\n\nAs mentioned before in prior lessons, similarities between the early days of the oil industry, and the situation today are remarkably similar. And it makes you wonder if we learn anything from history. The concept of needing to be energy independent and reducing dependency on outside sources that one cannot always control was the leading issue of the day. And pressure to control and ensure supply led to the rapid development of these new reserves in Persia, in spite of the logistical challenges.\n\nAnother similarity is the conflict between the government’s military spending and social spending. Social unrest in the early 1900s characterized the conflict between sharing limited budgets between the military and the people. But a great global conflict of a scale not seen since the oil industry started to take off in the mid 1800s was just around the corner- a world war was coming. Eleven days after Churchill's bill, on June 28th, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated at Sarajevo. Russia mobilized its forces on July 30th and on August 1st, 1914, Germany declared war on Russia. Churchill flashed the order to the entire British fleet to \"Commence hostilities against Germany\" starting the First World War!\n\nThe Prize\n\nChapter 8 - The Fateful Plunge\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\n\"The Godfather of Oil\"\n\n\"Made in Germany\"\n\nSpeed!\n\nThe Shell Menace\n\nAid for Anglo-Persian\n\nA Victory for Oil\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nHow did Britain's Navy compare to the US or Germany?\n\nWhat were some benefits of the oil conversion in the navy?\n\nWhat was seen as a strategic aspect of oilStrategic access to oil?\n\nWhat interests were at play in the political theater?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 9 and The Quest, Chapter 2 Overview\n\nOverview, The Prize - Chapter 9: The Blood of Victory\n\nWhile previous wars depended on men and horses, WWI depended on men and machines powered by oil intensifying the extent of damage and destruction. It is interesting that in wars with horses, planning required one horse for every three men and 10 times the food of each man for every horse! WWI was characterized by oil and the internal combustion engine. And to have the oil required rapid development and exploitation of Persia, and as we shall see, what is now Iraq.\n\nFor a period of more than two years, the battle lines hardly moved more than 10 miles in either direction until the British turned to technology to break the stalemate by designing, developing and building a new vehicle funded by Churchill’s Navy under the codename “tank”. With the tanks and motorized transport, suddenly speed and mobility became possible as the tanks moved on traction, impervious to machine guns and barbed wires, and amplified the devastation. Towards the end of the war, the British had 56,000 trucks, 23,000 motorcars and 34,000 motorcycles. The US entered the war in 1917 with another 50,000 vehicles to France—all powered by gasoline! Eventually more than 13 million died during World War I, and victory of the truck over the locomotive was demonstrated.\n\nAviation technology also advanced during the war and provided strategic importance and advantages of the air with a bird’s eye view of the battlefield (reconnaissance and observation) and the ability to bomb enemy positions and airplanes. The planes powered by oil as fuel provided another reason to maintain access to petroleum products. The advanced aviation technology yielded fighter planes that had greater lethality and were much faster. The Germans actually took the lead in strategic bombing with the use of Zeppelins and Strategic Bombers. The war constantly pushed innovation for larger numbers, faster, and better planes. In fact, by 1915, all machines that had been in the air at the beginning of the war were obsolete. The war proved Churchill and Fisher right in their conversion of the British fleet to oil as it provided advantages over the German fleet powered by coal--greater range and speed and faster refueling. Oil also proved useful not only for transportation fuel to power all of these new pieces of equipment, but as a new, better source of toluene- needed to make TNT.\n\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same. During this period we see more inter-company squabbling and the desire by companies to be more integrated, leading Anglo Persian to acquire British Petroleum.\n\nMany military aspects of WWI are actually rooted in oil. The German U-boat attacks were meant in large part to disrupt the access to oil for the allies. In return, many battles were fought with the intent to disrupt oil fields and transportation routes. Dealing with this supply challenge led to the entry of the United States into the fray, and it was the lack of a secure oil supply that eventually led Germany to surrender. By October 1918, the situation of Germany with respect to oil was desperate as Germany was anticipating a crisis in the coming winter and spring, and within a month a worn-down Germany surrendered. The Armistice or Peace treaty was signed at 5 AM on Nov 11, 1918, and went into effect 6 hours later, ending the war. The impact of oil in the war is eloquently summed up by Lord Curzon of Britain, “The Allied cause had floated to victory upon a wave of oil,” and by Senator Bérenger of France, “Oil-the blood of the earth was the blood of victory. Germany had boasted too much of its superiority in iron and coal, but it had not taken sufficient account of our superiority in oil. As oil had been the blood of war, so it would be the blood of the peace.”\n\nIt must be noted that while it was the governments who wanted this secure supply, it was the private companies that made it happen. It was a mutually beneficial engagement- the companies had a secure demand, and the government was able to leverage the reach and know-how of the oil giants.\n\nThe supply shortage and high demand resulted in rapid increases in the price of oil. The price changes clearly had no negative effect on the demand as the demand remained strong even with the increasing prices. Thus, the demand for oil had become relatively inelastic, or oil was exhibiting inelastic demand in economic terms.\n\nThe Quest - Chapter 2: The Caspian Derby\n\nFast forward to the end of the Cold War and we see a somewhat similar scenario to pre-WWI. Like the fall of the Ottoman Empire into many smaller new nations looking for a foothold in the world order, the dissolution of the Soviet Union also led to new nations. And like with the Ottoman Empire-derived new countries, the post-Soviet Era countries had a wealth of oil; they only needed to find a way to play in the global marketplace. Hence the Caspian oil region was born, and these new places were now dealing with the likes of Russia, Great Britain, the United States, Turkey, Iran, and at one point China.\n\nThe new opening up of the Caspian region would bring up recurring rivals, most notably Russia and Britain, and continual competition and striving for control and influence. But the situation would take on new characteristics in the 20th Century, revolving around oil transportation. The oil in Baku was essentially landlocked. The advances in tanker technology would do nothing for transporting this oil. It would require a network of pipelines to get the crude from the drill point to the consumer. The many countries surrounding the Baku Oil Region would all want their piece of the pie. Each country would want to negotiate individual terms for oil to travel through a pipeline over their land.\n\nThe Prize\n\nChapter 9 - The Blood of Victory: World War 1\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Taxi Armada\n\nInternal Combustion at War\n\nAnglo Persian Versus Shell\n\nThe Man with the Sledgehammer\n\nMajor Themes to Ponder as You Read:\n\nWhat was one of most transformative impacts to the oil industry?\n\nWhat was new in regard to waging war?\n\nWhat about oil was critical to survival and decisive in World War I?\n\nHow were oil prices different than supply and demand responses?\n\nThe Quest\n\nChapter 2 - The Caspian Derby\n\nSections to Read\n\nThe New Great Game\n\nMajor Themes to Ponder as You Read:\n\nHow did countries perceive the pipeline in regard to revenue?\n\nWhat did the pipelines need?\n\nWho was deemed responsible for monitoring the pipeline?\n\nIn addition to spills and cleanup, what other concerns were there?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 10 Overview\n\nChapter 10 highlights the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, and the entry of what is now Iraq into the world oil market. We also see in this chapter various arrangements such as the Sykes-Picot Agreement. The growing complexity of who was in charge of what required some degree of collaboration and to an extent, “sacrifice” for the greater good. The British, German, and Royal Dutch/Shell common goal was to get as much access as possible to the speculated petroleum. Under the agreement, the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) became the only entity with access to concessions in the area within the Ottoman Empire, and all oil production had to be done jointly as all parties had to agree to the \"self-denying clause.\" This clause required all parties included in the agreement to work together or not at all. The investment would be shared, and the profits would be shared. The only areas of the Ottoman Empire exempted from the clause were Egypt, Kuwait, and territories on the Turco-Persian border.\n\nAmerica, fearing the exhaustion of petroleum under their own land and the return of \"Gasolineless Sundays\" sought access to the brightest prospects – the Middle East. To add to the fears, demand for oil in America increased by 90% from 1911-1918 and the number of registered cars went from 1.8 to 9.2 million from 1914-1920. George Otis Smith, the director of the U.S. Geological Survey, warned that the known American reserves would be gone in exactly nine years and three months-which would have been before 1930. This influenced the price of oil to increase and encouraged the government to support the oil companies in their quest for foreign supplies. Thus, the fear of shortage and competition helped to push American companies to now explore for oil wherever they could find it with support of the US government - and that meant the Middle East.\n\nBritain had much economic and strategic collaboration with the US and was not willing to jeopardize its relationship with America and reconsidered. Besides, they also realized that entry of American capital and technology would accelerate the development, and the presence of America would also improve the political climate and strengthen the position of the companies in any political conflict. In the words of the Permanent Undersecretary of the British Foreign Office, according to the Prize, \"it would be better to have the Americans inside than outside competing and challenging the concessions.\"\n\nIn the ultimate irony when viewed against the early days of trust busting and the downfall of Standard Oil, Herbert Hoover, the Secretary of Commerce, suggested that a syndicate of companies should be formed to operate in Mesopotamia. It felt remarkably like the dragon that had been slain by the Supreme Court was back to life… and Standard Oil of NJ sat at the top! A few years back, the group would have been a target of the government for antitrust and restraint of trade, but now they were being cheered on as the champions for promoting the Open Door policy!\n\nThe US constantly refused to recognize the 1914 granting of concessions to the TPC. Eventually, however, a new concession agreement was signed on March 14, 1925, between the TPC and the Iraqi government that satisfied the Open Door policy after lengthy and contentious negotiations. Despite all the controversy between the oil companies, ethnic groups, and the British appointed king, a joint geological expedition in Iraq started drilling in April 1927. Six months later in October 1927 at Baba Gurgur, six miles northwest of Kirkuk, oil was gushing 50 feet above the derrick into the air. The oil flowed until capped at 95,000 BPD.\n\nWith the availability of oil in the area proved, the final settlement of the negotiations that was to bring the American companies into the TPC had to be completed with urgency. This happened on July 31, 1928, with Royal Dutch/Shell, Anglo-Persian, the CFP (French), and the Near East Development Company (which held the interests of the American companies) each receiving 23.75% with the remaining 5% going to Gulbenkian.\n\nThe \"self-denying\" clause still remained, and at one of the negotiation meetings a red line was drawn around the old Ottoman (Turkish) Empire on a map, and the \"self-denying\" clause became known as the \"Red Line Agreement.\" Within the Red Line that included the entire Middle East, except Kuwait and Persia, the group was bound to operate together. As expected, the Red Line Agreement continued to be a focus of tension and bitter conflicts for many years to come, as it constrained exploration and development by requiring all the partners to work together in all oil production.\n\nNote that the events in this chapter were between the two world wars, when countries had found out in WWI that access to oil was of critical strategic importance to national security and strategies. Also, note that Kuwait and Iran were the only parts of the Middle East not included within the Red Line.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 10 - Opening the Door on the Middle East: The Turkish Petroleum Company\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nMr. Five Percent\n\n\"A First-Class War Aim\"\n\nClemenceau and His Grocer\n\nOil Shortage and the Open Door\n\n\"The Boss\": Walter Teagle\n\nFaisal of Iraq\n\nThe Architect\n\nToward the Red Line\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhere did Britain want to assert its influence?\n\nFrance had claims to what parts of current-day Iraq?\n\nWhat did the Great War make clear about petroleum?\n\nWhat was the issue between Britain and US in the Middle East?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 11 Overview\n\nWith Chapter 11, we enter “The Age of Gasoline”, arguably an age we are still in it to this day. The demand for gasoline increased and still continues to increase. In 1919, the U.S. used 1.03 million barrels per day; ten years later, demand had increased 2.5 times to 2.58 million barrels per day. The demand of oil for light had transferred to the demand for oil used for mobility. The increase in demand was driven primarily by the increase in the number of automobiles. In 1916, the U.S. had 3.4 million registered vehicles, and by the end of the decade, the number had jumped to 23.1 million, with cars being driven farther and farther. By 1929, nearly 80% of the world’s automobiles were in America, and oil’s share of total energy consumption had gone from 10 to 25% in the decade 1919 -1929, with gasoline and fuel oil accounting for 85% of the total oil consumption.\n\nCredit: Miller, John S.. \"The Uncertainty of Forecasts.\" U.S. Dept. of Transportation. Public Roads 68, no. 2 (2004)\n\nAlthough we are so used to it that we hardly notice it, a new culture emerged around gasoline, the emergence of the gasoline station. Before 1920, most gasoline was sold by storekeepers, who kept it dangerously in cans in the store. The Automobile Gasoline Company is credited with the first drive-in gas station in St. Louis in 1907. However, the proliferation of gas stations did not catch on until the 1920s. But selling a commodity such as gasoline is tricky. In general, gasoline is gasoline so why would you buy from one instead of another? Price is one way to ensure market share, however you can only reduce price so far before you are losing money. So the oil companies developed trademarks to distinguish themselves and promote competition. The filling/service stations added features that would help their customers with their vehicles by checking/selling tires, batteries, and accessories. Today, we see gas stations and “convenience stores” that sell gasoline. The appearance of the gas station revolutionized how gasoline was marketed.\n\nChapter 11 discusses the increasing trend we saw in Lesson 3 of oil becoming a key element of national policy and national security. Oil was becoming more of a factor in economic stability and the resilience of the military. As you would expect, with this growing role, also comes controversy and challenges. The Teapot Dome scandal illustrates this aspect in the sense of collusion between private sector companies and government, criminal kickbacks, and political favors. And Teapot Dome itself illustrates another emerging idea, an organized, government-supported reserve to be used for the military. The idea being that the US Navy would have a reliable source of fuel regardless of what was happening geopolitically, and whether imported supplies were threatened.\n\nToday, we are seeing a different challenge associated with such reserves. We have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve created by the government to hold a supply of fuel to be used in times of national emergency. As we will see in this course, when you depend on other countries for oil supply, you tend to be at their mercy in terms of volume, prices, and stability. There has been current controversy around releases from the SPR, including claims that releases are for political reasons- to stabilize fuel prices. Some argue this is not the intended use of the SPR, and is putting national security at risk.\n\nWe remember from prior lessons the idea of “Rule of Capture.” A nice way of saying “grab all you can get as fast as you can”. This mentality compromised the efficiency of oil fields, resulting in lost reserves and price volatility. The industry was realizing that this approach clearly does not work in the long run. Enter the concept of “unitization” where producers work together in developing a field to ensure that it is managed as efficiently as possible. A good analogy is a children’s Easter egg hunt. There are two ways to do it- you let all the children run out in the field and grab as much as they can (Rule of Capture), or you establish some rules such as a maximum number of eggs allowed per child, sperate areas for age groups, and so on (Unitization). As you can imagine, and as the companies learned, unitization makes sense if those involved agree to cooperate.\n\nNew discoveries were few in the years 1917-1920, resulting in pessimism about production and increased prices. For example, Oklahoma crude that sold for $1.20 a barrel in 1916 was selling for $3.36 in 1920. In the 1920s, technology for finding oil improved as geophysicists led the way in developing tools for oil exploration. So, in spite of the shortage fear, the new innovations helped in the discovery of several major fields including the Signal Hill and others which made California the number one oil-producing state in 1923; the Greater Seminole field in Oklahoma in 1926 (flowed at 527,000 barrels per day (BPD) on July 30, 1927) and the Yates field in West Texas and New Mexico.\n\nIn addition to innovations in exploration and production, innovations in crude processing/refining such as cracking enabled more and superior gasoline with better anti-knock properties to be extracted out of a barrel of crude, reducing the demand for more crude. With demand decreasing and the many producers each maximizing their production, the flush production led to oversupply and devastating consequences on the price of oil. With the glut and low prices, the opinion of the oil industry began to lean toward an approach of conservation and production control. This time, not based on shortage but as a means to prevent the flood and its catastrophic effect on pricing. Still, opposition to direct government regulation or involvement was extremely strong.\n\nRestructuring and the Deep Depression\n\nRockefeller actually set the example of confronting imbalances in supply and demand through consolidation and integration within Standard Oil and the oil industry years before. Consolidation – implies the acquisition of competitors and complementary companies, and Integration – implies the fusing of the upstream (exploration and production) and the downstream (refining, transportation, sales, and distribution) under one company working for the same goal.\n\nThe oil industry realized that the strategy of restructuring via consolidation and integration has its advantages and would form the foundation for our modern American oil industry. There were now many big companies and several independents by the 1920s, as by 1927 45% of the refined products were controlled by the various “Standard companies” compared to the 80% two decades earlier.\n\nThe stock market plunged in October 1929 ushering in the Great Depression that led to many people losing their jobs, savings, and standard of living. There was massive unemployment, poverty, and hardship throughout the nation, ending the constant growth in demand for oil. Just when the country was realizing in autumn 1930 that the stock market crash was not a simple correction but a true economic disaster, as luck would have it, the largest oil field in the lower 48 states, the Black Giant in East Texas, was discovered. Now, there would be a flood of available petroleum with a consequent drop in prices.\n\nThe Stock Market Crash, just like the COVID outbreak in recent years are what is call a “Black Swan Event.” Such events are surprises and unexpected, but when viewed in hindsight, should have been expected. The idea is that a black swan is very rare, but genetically it can happen and should be expected to occur at some point. Regardless, Black Swan events are very disruptive to even the best laid plans.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 11 - From Shortage to Surplus: The Age of Gasoline\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nA Century of Travel\n\nThe Magic of Gasoline\n\nThe Tempest in the Teapot\n\nThe Tycoon\n\nThe Rising Tide\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was happening with gasoline in the 1920s?\n\nWhat reduced concern about supplies?\n\nHow is oil different from other commodities?\n\nWhat is the Rule of Capture and unitization?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 14 Overview\n\nDuring that period, industrial rationalization, efficiency and elimination of duplication were the values and objectives promoted by the companies as they explored mergers, collaboration cartels, marketing arrangements, and associations to address the excess supply problem. These and other developments were what contributed to the \"As-Is\" Agreement, also called Pool Association that was agreed to, but not signed. Under the agreement, each company was allocated a quota in various markets, but the agreement excluded the domestic US market to avoid violating US antitrust laws. In addition to the quotas, the companies agreed to drive down costs, share facilities, and be cautious in building new refineries and other facilities. A few months later, the industry leaders agreed to control production as well. Thus, by the agreement, an international oil cartel was in essence being formed!\n\nCartels typically control or fix prices, markets, and production. However, the agreement fell apart as the companies resumed attacking each other's markets. Eventually, 17 American companies formed the Export Petroleum Association, under the Webb-Pomerene Act of 1918 that allowed US companies to do abroad what the antitrust law would not allow them to do in the US. Disagreements on the allocation of output between the American and European companies led to the failure of the attempt to \"cartelize\" US oil exports, further undermining the \"As-Is\" agreement. Besides, there was too much production outside the \"As Is\" framework for it to be effective, and the agreement and the attempt to \"cartelize\" international oil production failed.\n\nThe Big Three (SO of New Jersey, Shell, & Anglo-Persian) tried to reformulate an alliance in 1930 dealing with the European Markets. They attempted to make local arrangements, dividing market shares with \"outsiders.\" Again, the system proved ineffective due to the rising volumes of American, Russian, and Romanian oil. In December 1932, the companies came up with an updated \"As-Is\" understanding: \"The Heads of Agreement for Distribution.\" The initial adherents were Royal Dutch/Shell, Jersey, Anglo-Persian, Socony, Gulf, Atlantic, Texas, and Sinclair. There were, however, many contentious points in the new agreement including chronic cheating and new markets. The companies, being fierce competitors, always plotted new attacks against each other even while they sought cooperation. In addition, there were constant conflicts with implementing agreements or even \"agreeing to what had been agreed to.\"\n\nIn a way, the \"As-Is\" agreement in addition to being a tool to defend against overproduction and the Depression, was also intended to defend against the emergence of political forces in Europe and the producing countries. During the 1930s, political pressure on the oil companies took many forms. Governments imposed import quotas, set prices, and placed restrictions on foreign exchange and also, as a result of the Depression, autocracy and bilateralism were the order of the day. The oil companies sought to insulate and protect themselves from government intervention in the second half of the 1930s after the worst of the Depression was over. Political and economic nationalism had also intensified throughout the world, and, as one oil observer then noted, \"Operations in the oil business are 90% political and 10% Oil.\"\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 14 - \"Friends\" -- and Enemies\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Hand of the British Government\n\n\"The Problem of the Oil Industry\"\n\nDiscord within \"Private Walls\"\n\nNationalism\n\nThe Shah's New Terms\n\nThe Mexican Battle\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat feature of international oil markets formed during this period?\n\nWhat was on the rise during this period?\n\nWhat was happening between producing countries & oil companies?\n\nWhat were companies trying to do in regard to contracts and concessions?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 15 Overview\n\nIn chapter 15 we encounter much wheeling and dealing in Arabia. In today’s global oil market, not only is the Middle East a key player, but it is also actually influential enough to direct prices, supplies, and overall market responses. But it wasn’t always like that, and in the early days, people were not even sure this area had potential. But like many of the other areas we have explored, an intrepid entrepreneur pursues a rumor or a seep, and the rest is history.\n\nFinding oil is as much about science as it is about agreements and politics. The Red Line Agreement we read about before ended up causing headaches for some companies, while it allowed others to take advantage. The contrasting story of Gulf and Socal demonstrates how such agreements can keep someone out of a market. Ironically, Gulf pivoted and moved to an area where they could work, and it turned out to be quite the strategic maneuver. In addition to the complexities introduced by agreements, there is the issue of nations having to deal with other powers. The interaction of American and British interests, and how they were perceived in this newly evolving oil market was the early manifestations of the conflicts that we face still today. That being the conflict of Western and Eastern cultures that play out on the battlefield of today’s oil markets.\n\nIt is interesting that, as we saw in other parts of the world, discoveries of large oil reserves sometimes soften the contempt one country can feel for another, and a greater effort is made to “close the deal.” We see that in this chapter, in regard to how these new oil-rich countries acted with America and Britain, and with each other. Kuwait is a classic example of this, as well as the old adage, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” With economic conditions causing problems, Kuwait needed money, but it was sitting on quite a bit of oil. Playing America and Britain off of each other by way of Gulf and Anglo-Persian proved a useful strategy. Conversely, the two companies teaming up also proved to be strategic and prudent.\n\nHaving a great agreement means nothing if the oil is uneconomic to develop or if demand is low. This means you have to improvise or temporarily adapt. The Texaco and Socal part of the story, and the birth of CalTex illustrates this well. But in the 1930s, oil was discovered in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in commercial quantities, and so began the prominence of this area in the global oil market.\n\nChange was once again coming in the form of another war. And like in World War I, although it wasn’t because of oil that the war started, oil did end up playing a major role.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 15 - The Arabian Concessions: The World the Frank Holmes Made\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nIbn Saud\n\nKuwait\n\nThe Blue Line Agreement\n\nDiscovery\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat happened between the Americans and the British in regard Saudi oil?\n\nHow was the relationship between Saudi Arabia & United States evolving?\n\nWhat was a major influence on agreements and partnerships?\n\nWhat was the “marriage of necessity”?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 16 Overview\n\nIn chapter 16, we return to Asia and learn about Japan’s incentive to engage in a war. Several reasons accounted for this shift in military expansionism: vulnerability due to its lack of natural resources, economic hardship from the Great Depression and the collapse of world trade, dwindling access to international markets, extreme nationalism, moral distress, arrogance, and the mystical belief in the superiority of Japanese culture as well as “The Imperial Way” (Asia under Japanese control).\n\nWhen Prime Minister Osachi Hamaguchi won a large election victory in February 1930 and favored cooperation with Britain and the United States, he was assassinated by a youth, and that killed any spirit of cooperation. Ultra-nationalism took hold thereafter. After being reprimanded for its actions by the League of Nations (United Nations), Japan left the League, rejected liberalism, capitalism, and democracy as engines of weakness, and embarked on its own destructive course. The Emperor sought to establish a “national defense state” in which all resources, especially oil, were targeted for war based on Germany's failure/defeat in WWI from lack of resources (oil).\n\nJapan was a good example of the desperation that comes from lack of energy security and independence. By the late 1930s, Japan produced only 7% of the oil it consumed. It imported the rest, with 80% coming from the U.S., and 10% from the Dutch East Indies. Japan sought to dominate the oil industry to serve its needs. Up to that time, 60% of its internal market was held by two Western companies (Rising Sun & Stanvac). Rising Sun was the Japanese affiliate of Royal Dutch/Shell, and Stanvac was a joint venture between Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York. In other words, even in cases driven by national interests, the global companies are ever-present.\n\nAs with the Middle East experience we saw in Chapter 15, sometimes national feelings toward another country or culture clashes with the reality of dependence, especially with oil. With Japan’s actions, the United States emerged as Japan’s antagonist in the Pacific, as the U.S. had an “open door” policy which was counter to Japan’s strategy. With the U.S. as Japan’s major oil supplier and likely antagonist, the question was where was Japan going to get its oil in case of war? To help address this, the military won passage in 1934 of the Petroleum Industry Law, which gave the government the power to control imports, set quotas, fix prices, and make compulsory purchases. The underlining objectives of the law were to build up refining industry, reduce the role of foreign companies, and prepare for war. The oil companies, U.S., and Britain all recognized and disapproved of the “squeeze and restrictive oil” policies of Japan.\n\nJapan didn’t want any disruption of its oil supply and passed the Synthetic Oil Industry Law which provided a 7-year plan to produce synthetic fuels from coal by 1943. Japan began to establish industrial self-sufficiency and to break its dependence on the U.S. in anticipation of an oil embargo. But in the meantime, it needed to ensure supply and ironically kept buying gasoline from America. This rings of the current paradox we see with Russian oil and the European countries.\n\nWith the increased escalation and tension, an embargo was virtually the only way left, and on July 25, 1941, the U.S. ordered all Japanese financial assets in the U.S. frozen. While it was not an embargo, a lack of assets to buy oil virtually turned it indirectly into an embargo. On July 28, Japan, as expected, invaded Indochina, taking another step towards war. Effectively, by August 1, 1941, there were no more oil exports to Japan from the U.S. Japan’s oil situation was so serious that there were some last-minute diplomatic efforts to avoid the confrontation in addition to intense discussions between the Emperor and his top military generals.\n\nWith the Pearl Harbor attack, even though it was not the only reason for the war, Japan, however, made one grave mistake – not sending a third wave to attack the oil supplies and repair facilities on the island of Oahu. All oil on the island had been transported from the mainland. Thus, the destruction of the oil reserves and tanks holding them at Oahu would have immobilized every ship of the U.S. Pacific Fleet not just those destroyed, accomplishing exactly what the Japanese original intention had been. The sparing of the aircraft carriers, the oil, and repair facilities ended up being the only good fortune of the U.S. on that day. “Oil had been central to Japan’s decision to go to war. Yet the Japanese forgot about oil when it came to planning Operation Hawaii.”\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 16 - Japan's Road to War\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe New Order in Asia\n\nJapanese Advance and American Restrictions - The First Round\n\nYamamoto's Gamble - \"Doubtless I will Die\"\n\nEmbargo\n\nPearl Harbor\n\nThe One Mistake\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was oil’s role in causing the war?\n\nWhat conditions opened the door to despots?\n\nWhat is an example today learned from what we read?\n\nWhy are sea lanes vulnerable to access to oil?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 17 Overview\n\nLet’s move now back to Europe and examine Germany’s motivations. In chapter 17 we again see how necessity drives innovation. Germany was the world leader in chemistry. One of its scientists, Friedrich Bergius, had, in 1913, invented the hydrogenation method to produce high-grade liquid fuel from coal which Farben patented the rights to in 1926. The hydrogenation process involved heating large amounts of hydrogen with coal at high temperatures and pressure in the presence of a catalyst. The competing technology was the Fischer-Tropsch process. It involved steam reforming of coal to produce Syn-gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) that was subsequently converted to synthetic oil, but wasn’t as successful. Hydrogenation could also produce aviation fuel, while the Fischer-Tropsch method could not.\n\nThe argument was that synthetic fuels from coal could cut Germany’s dependence on foreign oil and also reduce the pressures on foreign exchange. The German government commenced in building the Nazi war machine (bombers, fighter planes, tanks, trucks) that all depended on oil. Thus, an independent oil supply was vital, and the synthetic fuels would become an important strategic source.\n\nStandard Oil of New Jersey (SO of NJ), which had unsuccessfully been exploring alternatives to crude oil as early as 1921 and had acquired acres of shale oil in Colorado with the hope of extracting oil out of the shale, showed interest in the technology. SO of NJ saw the technology as a clear threat to its business. They had no need to produce synthetic fuels because of the oversupply of crude oil, but wanted to ensure that each stayed out of the other’s main fields of activity. SO of NJ would also rather use hydrogenation to increase the gasoline yield and boost octane out of crude oil.\n\nWe learn in Chapter 17 that regardless of why one enters war, the access and management of oil can make or break the outcome. Hitler had been convinced that there was absolutely no way Germany could win the war without access to the Russian oil. The grand strategy was to have one attack through southern Russia and another from the southwest via North Africa. The grand strategy failed due to a number of reasons including Allied attacks on German fuel supply lines, the fierce Russian resistance, and Allied code breakers. Clearly, the bitter lesson learned by Rommel is illustrated by his statement, “The bravest men can do nothing without guns, the guns nothing without plenty of ammunition, and neither guns nor ammunition are of much use in mobile warfare unless there are vehicles with sufficient petrol to haul them around.” The Allies, led by General Carl Spaatz, set a new priority target – the German synthetic fuels industry and began bombing oil factories all over Germany. The goal was to deny oil to the enemy armed forces.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 17 - Germany's Formula for War\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Chemical Solution\n\nGirding for War\n\nThe Russian Campaign: \"My Generals Know Nothing About the Economic Aspects of War\"\n\nRommel and the Revenge of the Quartermaster\n\n\"The Primary Strategic Aim\"\n\nThe Battle of the Bulge: Europe's Biggest Gas Station\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was critical regarding oil during this period?\n\nHow were logistics and fuel critical?\n\nWhat was one possible pathway to reduce dependance?\n\nThe Quest, Chapter 7 Overview\n\nThe section from the Quest reviews the reasons behind the war the United States engaged with Iraq post 9-11. This allows us to compare the road to war in Japan and Germany, and in the United States, years apart. Some similarities and some differences, but an undeniable fact is that the oil industry was impacted by both. Some could argue that oil caused both wars, some others could argue that both wars highlighted the value of oil. The actual answer is somewhere in the middle, and that any time war occurred since World War I - oil was included in the consideration.\n\nWorld War II was a delayed reaction to the end of World War I. Similar to how the Iraq War of 2003 could be considered a delayed reaction to the Gulf War of 1991, Japan of WWII underestimated the United States' reaction. Similarly Iraq and Saddam Hussein were only focused on the regional blustering and did not have the United States in focus. The threat of an armed opponent was a guiding fear factor. The attack on 9-11 has been compared to the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, after 9-11, there was not a clear adversary for the United States. Iraq and Afghanistan were ways to prevent war, but was not as clear as when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.\n\nSo, what do these have to do with oil? - WWII, Japan was seeking more oil sources. The United States has a fear of losing oil supplies. But did the individual attacks, Japan on Pearl Harbor and the United States on Iraq, actually increase access to oil? Japan still had to seek out new oil supplies in the East Indies, and the United States had to stabilize and rebuild the oil industry in Iraq. Neither direction increased access to oil quickly, and neither was a stable and secure option.\n\nInstability does not encourage foreign investment. The oil companies wanted to know how the political system would work and impact their investment. They wanted to know about the economic system and contracts. What would guarantee security to their investment? Then and only then would the oil companies invest. But the United States Government could not guarantee any security of the investment or the knowledgeability to build a stable investment environment. Thus, was the war really all focused on the oil industry? The goal of the US Government would be to keep the oil available on the world market in general. The loss of any percentage of oil production is not just a shortage for one country, but a decreased amount of oil available for everyone.\n\nThen, enter the other view that the oil companies were pushing for oil access. Oil companies do have an increased demand for oil resources to fuel the engaged militaries. Would this be a case of application of the “Rule of Capture” - sell as much oil as possible while the war happens? Or would the oil companies have learned from how this principle impacted the industry? Steady gains more profit than quick.\n\nIraq had been operating under a nationalized oil industry. We know the challenges and corruption that comes with the Petro State. Yet, we can also see the citizens from a nationalized industry receiving the profits and being able to ideally receive benefits from the natural resources they live on. Iraq had long term goals in the 1970s for 6 million barrels a day. This long-term goal was stopped by the Iran/Iraq war of the 1980s, then the Gulf War of the 1990s. Their continual participation in wars have hurt the Iraqis' ability to develop and advance their oil industry.\n\nUpon review of the Iraqi oil industry and infrastructure - the country had stopped developing in the industry approximately 50 years earlier. Any technological advances were not from government coordinated production development, but the individual skill and innovation of the Iraqi oil engineers. We remember when the USSR fell, and the state of the Baku oil fields; well, this is much of the same. These countries did not develop or advance their oil industry but instead relied on the consistent Petro income to finance the rest of the government, leaving the state of the industry a shadow of what once was.\n\nWith Saddam removed from power, the focus of the United States military was finally security. This is what the oil companies were focused on from the start, but the military was focused on changing the regime. Look at this way- thinking that the oil companies could speculate the vast income from the Iraq War is like Rockefeller allowing Standard Oil to be split up so he could multiply his wealth, or Japan attacking Pearl Harbor to increase their Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nThe Quest, Chapter 7 - War in Iraq\n\nSections to Read\n\nWhy the War\n\nOil\n\nBeyond Nation Building\n\nThe Oil Industry: \"Dilapidated and Deplorable\"\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nHow did oil and war relate as to which came first?\n\nWhat were some similarities between the wars?\n\nHow did ideology of politics relate to physical control of assets?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 18 Overview\n\nThe high/low rollercoaster relationship Japan had with oil characterizes their fortunes and misfortunes in World War II. Concerns over supply was a big driver to get them into war, but they quickly secured access and quantity and were riding high and feeling victory was imminent. We may not typically think of Asia as an oil source today, but we see how important that region’s reserves were for Japan. And when Japan brought America into the war, the first thing we thought to do was secure our supplies and interrupt theirs.\n\nWith the ever-tightening blockade on Japan by the submarines, “The shortage of liquid fuel was Japan’s Achilles' Heel.” Oil imports that had risen to their peak in the first quarter of 1943 had decreased by about half at the same time in 1944 and had completely disappeared/dried up by the same time in 1945. Desperate, Japan tried many forms of improvisations as the oil situation worsened. Industrial oil was made from soybeans, peanuts, coconuts, and castor beans. Potatoes, sugar, rice, and sake were even converted to alcohol to be used as fuel. By 1944, civilian gasoline consumption was down to 257,000 gallons, just 4% of the 1940 figure. Japan revived its 1937 synthetic fuel attempts, and in 1943, Japan’s synthetic fuel production amounted to 1 million barrels – only 8% of the target amount. Over half of this value was in Manchuria, which was useless in late 1944 and 1945 due to the blockade. Besides, synthetic fuel was a drain on resources, manpower, and management and was more of a liability than an asset.\n\nThe overall consequence of the oil shortage caused the naval strength of the Japanese fleet to be divided when it truly needed to be combined. Part of the fleet was based in Japan waiting for new aircraft and pilots, and the heavy battleships were stationed near Singapore closer to the East Indies supply. The shortage worsened in 1945, and navigation training for flight pilots was eliminated. Unfortunately, another solution for aviation fuel shortage was the introduction of the kamikaze pilots- as they only needed half the fuel of a normal mission!\n\nWhile Japan’s condition continued to worsen, the Americans had an abundant fuel supply in the Pacific with huge floating bases made up of fuel barges, repair ships, tenders, tugs, floating docks, salvage ships, lighters, and store ships that gave the U.S. Navy long legs across the Pacific. This is indeed ironic in that the Pacific is home to Japan but incredibly far away for Americans!\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 18 - Japan's Achilles Heel\n\nSections to Read\n\nThe Battle of the Marus: The War of Attrition\n\n\"No Sense in Saving the Fleet\"\n\nThe End of the Imperial Navy\n\nA Fight to the Finish?\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was a characteristic of the battles in the Pacific?\n\nWhat are some challenges associated with supply lines?\n\nWhat was an ironic aspect of Japan running out of oil?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 19 Overview\n\nIn 1937, before the outbreak of war and in anticipation of war, a special committee was formed to examine the possibility of Britain adopting an “oil from coal” synthetic fuels strategy similar to what Germany had done in WWI. The strategy was rejected, as importing through many ports was deemed less vulnerable than easily bombed hydrogenation plants. Besides, it would have been more costly compared to the cheaper and readily available oil. Also, 85% of Britain’s domestic refining marketing was in the hands of three western/friendly companies, Shell, Anglo-Iranian, and Standard Oil of New Jersey’s (SONJ) British subsidiary, and two of these had their home in Britain. The British government also decided in 1938 that in case of war the entire British oil industry would be run under one organization and not through three separate competing companies.\n\nFears of oil shortage led to rationing being imposed on recreational vehicles in Britain, which led to a big boom in bicycling. Under the threat of German invasion, 17,000 gasoline stations in England were shut down, leaving 2,000 stations that could at least be defended.\n\nThe two critical questions of importance to Britain for war with the Germans were whether oil would be available and if they could pay for it. The United States was responsible for two-thirds of total world production and, therefore, the answer to whether oil would be available was yes. To help Britain overcome the question of payment, on March 1941, the Lend-Lease was instituted. This removed the problem of finance as a constraint on American supply to Britain, since, with the Lend-Lease, American oil could now be lent and repaid later. The neutrality legislation which had placed restrictions on the shipment of supplies was also gradually lifted to help loosen restrictions on shipment of supplies to Britain. Thus, by spring 1941, all the important steps had been taken to ensure an adequate flow of oil from America to Britain.\n\nWe have learned so far this semester that having access to oil reserves is not helpful if you cannot get to it and move it around. Vulnerability of supply lines could result in shortages even if there is plenty of oil. The vulnerability issue became a key element of World War II, and we think of it as the German U-Boat crisis.\n\nAn alternative to tanker shipment came into being when pipeline construction (dubbed Big Inch) from Texas to the East Coast, was initiated in August 1942. Within a year and a half of construction, Big Inch was carrying one-half of all crude moving East through its 1,254 miles by the end of 1943. Little Inch, which was 1,475 miles, was built between April 1943 and March 1944 to carry gasoline and other refined products also from the Southwest to the East Coast. By the end of 1944, about 42% of all oil was transported to the east coast through pipelines, compared to just 4% at the beginning of 1942. We see as history unfolds that pipelines revolutionize the oil industry, even in peacetime.\n\nCoordinating unity among the many competing US forces (Congress, the Administration, the companies, the press, etc.) in the US was very difficult. To address this challenge, an effective government-industry partnership was gradually established and sought antitrust exemption from the Justice Department. Although there were temporary shortages, there was never a serious oil supply crisis in the US. The overall production record in the US was quite good. Meanwhile, between December 1941 and August 1945, the Allies consumed 7 billion barrels of oil, 6 billion of which came from the United States. It is also interesting to note that the wartime oil output was more than 25% of all oil produced in the US from the time of Colonel Drake to 1941!\n\nTo accommodate the war oil output, consumption/rationing was considered. Efforts were made to get industrial users to switch from oil to coal, and President Roosevelt took strong interest in the potential of America’s largely underutilized natural gas resources. However, gasoline was still the focus of contention. America, which had rejected voluntary conservation, now accepted enforced rationing because there was a war.\n\nOil clearly was demonstrated to be essential in WWII as it played a significant role for the Army. Before WWII, the Army did not even keep records of its oil use. While WWI had been a static, more relatively stationary war, WWII was a war of motion, and, at the peaks, the American forces in Europe used one hundred times more gasoline in WWII than in WWI. A number of innovations were also created to facilitate the use and flow of petroleum. A simple innovation that had a profound effect on the conduct of the war was the 5-gallon gasoline can. This was based on an improved design on captured German cans that led to the common nicknames “jerrycan” and “blitz can.” Other innovations included the all-purpose motor fuel and all-purpose diesel fuel and the development of the 100-octane fuel, through catalytic cracking, for better aircraft performance. The 100-octane fuel provided greater bursts of speed, more power, quicker takeoff, longer range, and greater maneuverability.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 19 - The Allies' War\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Oil Czar: The Mobilization of American Supply\n\nTrial by Sea: The Battle of the Atlantic\n\nDomestic Push\n\nInnovation\n\nThe \"Unforgiving Minute\"\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was changing with oil allocation?\n\nWhat was happening for the first time in regard to access to oil?\n\nWhat was becoming a growing concern?\n\nWhat was a critical aspect of the Allies' advance?\n\nWho felt the supply lines were important?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 20 Overview\n\nWe will learn in chapter 20 that the general belief was that the center of gravity of world oil production would shift from the Gulf-Caribbean area to the Middle East. In 1940, for example, the Arabian Peninsula produced less than 5% of world oil, and the U.S. produced 63%. The report coming from a man with great respect in oil exploration clearly predicted the end of oil domination by the US that had produced nearly 90% of the oil of the used by Allies in WWII.\n\nThe British sphere of influence in the Arabian Peninsula was huge relative to the US. However, the US knew there were enormous potential oil reserves in the area, and the American orientation to Saudi Arabia and the Middle East was changing.\n\nAmerica’s entry into the war in 1942 and 1943 caused a whole new outlook to be placed upon Middle Eastern oil. Oil was recognized as a critical strategic commodity that was essential for national power and international predominance. The single resource that shaped military strategy and could cause defeat was oil. The U.S. single-handedly fueled the Allies during WWII, which significantly drained its oil reserves. Fear of shortage began to grow, and the explosive growth with discoveries in the 1920s and 1930s had fallen off sharply, resulting in additions becoming more difficult, expensive, and limited (i.e., the law of diminishing returns was in effect). These assessments led to the conclusion that the U.S. was destined to become a net importer of oil, with potentially grave security implications. This gave rise to the “conservation theory,” which suggested that the U.S. government had to control and develop foreign oil reserves to reduce the drain on domestic supplies and conserve them for the future and guarantee America’s security. And the foreign reserves had to be the Middle East. In essence, American policymakers had arrived at the same standpoint that Britain had held since WWI, the centrality of the Middle East.\n\nThe focus shift to the Middle East introduced a whole new suite of issues, many rooted in the mutual distrust between America and Britain.\n\nSocal & Texaco were the only private companies involved in Saudi Arabia, and they knew the size of the Saudi Arabian oil reserves. They were afraid the British, through the financing of Ibn Saud, would help get them kicked out of the country. Besides, Saudi Arabia was only 20 years old, and they were unsure if the Kingdom and oil concession would survive the King himself. They also realized that it was one thing to throw out private companies and another to take on the most powerful power in the world. Thus, the policy of solidification, or direct involvement by the American government in Saudi Arabia, was an easy argument since it would help reduce the risk of expropriation as happened in Mexico. The implementation of the Lend-Lease approach was a mechanism to assure access.\n\nOnce again, we see the risk of overproduction and price crashes. If the U.S. was not going into the oil business, there was still another avenue to consider: British Partnership in managing the world oil market. Both the British and Americans saw a coming postwar glut from the Middle East and potential for all-out competition. Also, many in the U.S. feared the exhaustion of US reserves and wanted a fundamental transformation in supply arrangements whereby Europe could be supplied primarily from the Middle East and not from the U.S. reserves. The British campaigned hard on negotiations on the Middle East oil. Both sides recognized that after the war, the Middle East countries that depended on the oil royalties were going to put incredible pressure on the companies to increase production to increase their royalty revenue. This, in turn, was going to lead to a glut and intense competition, as failure to meet the demands of the countries would result in vulnerability of the oil concessions. Thus, the U.S. government explored partnerships with Britain to manage the world oil market ahead of the problem.\n\nThe U.S. was soon finding that it could not sustain itself on its production alone, as it was on its way from being a net exporter to being a net importer. Everything that wartime negotiators sought to prevent was soon found to be coming true: competition, chaos, and instability. In the absence of an International Petroleum Agreement, oil companies moved quickly to work out their own salvation in the Middle East for the postwar world.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 20 - Japan's Achilles Heel\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\n\"We're Running out of Oil!\"\n\n\"The Policy of 'Solidification'\"\n\n\"A Wrangle About Oil\"\n\nQuotas and Cartels\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was America’s role in the war in regard to fuel?\n\nWhat region was evolving as a new oil nexus?\n\nWhat did we see during the war that hinted at positioning for post-war order?\n\nWhat happened with America in regard to Saudi Arabia during WWII?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 21 Overview\n\nGasoline rationing was lifted in August 1945 in the U.S. within 24 hours of Japan’s defeat, and the operative phrase for most motorists at the gas station was “Fill ‘er up!” By 1950, oil was meeting more of America’s total energy needs than coal. While demand was increasing, supply was not decreasing as expected, due to new discoveries in the U.S. and even Canada, near Edmonton in the province of Alberta. Eventually, however, there was a shortage of available oil in 1947-48. Consumption rose with unexpected rapidity, and as it took time, money, and materials to redesign refineries to turn out products consumers wanted, supply could not catch up fast enough. But in 1948, imports of crude oil and products together had exceeded exports for the first time, creating an ominous new phrase, “foreign oil.” The figure below shows the stark difference in trends of domestic production and import. This divergence, especially with imports outpacing domestic production, is a red flag for energy independence, security, and flexibility. To this day, we see the challenges of depending on others for our oil needs.\n\nHence, energy security was a big issue for the Western Powers. Oil became the convergence point for foreign policy, international economics, national security, and corporate interests, and both Britain and the U.S. were intent on ensuring access to oil based on the lessons learned from WWII, the growing economic significance of oil, and the magnitude of Middle Eastern resources. Taking into consideration all the risks, Socal realized it would be best to pursue a policy of “solidification” and bring in new partners to gain market access & spread the risk.\n\nHere the delicate dance began for American oil companies to have access to the oil of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia had much oil, but it needed the partnership and agreements to leverage that resource. But it was a very volatile area. Clearly, enlarging the participation to more American companies only furthered the fundamental goals of American strategy to increase Middle East production, ensure that the Saudi concessions remained in U.S. hands, and conserve America’s own resources. Even though it is obvious now, as early as the late 40s, the US saw the strategic importance of the Middle East for oil. All of this led to the setting up of three landmark deals that will change the face of the global oil market for the future. Each of these deals involved a specific Middle East region, and had unique attributes, conditions, and drivers. Not all deals were the same.\n\nThe first of these deals involved Saudi Arabia and the expansion of Aramco. This deal was driven by a desire to have only American participation within Aramco. The second deal involved Kuwait and was driven by a need to get Kuwaiti oil into the European marketplace. The third deal involved Iran and was focused on ensuring stability in Iran and protection from the Soviet Union. With the completion of the three huge deals (Aramco, Gulf-Shell, and the Iranian contract) things (mechanisms, capital, and marketing systems) were in place to move vast quantities of Middle Eastern oil into European markets.\n\nThe US has experienced its share of energy crises. But in the immediate post-war period, it was Europe that was in dire straits. Throughout Europe, destruction and disorganization were everywhere, and food and raw materials were in desperately short supply after the war. Economic disarray from the longest and coldest winter weather in 1947 and the energy crisis increased the shortage of the dollar that also minimized the ability to import goods and caused a chain reaction that crippled the economy throughout Europe.\n\nWe see during the reconstruction period in Europe after the war that although the overall goal was to rebuild the economy, it was rooted in the oil industry. Energy was fundamental to any rebirth. The first issue addressed was the energy crisis. For most of the European countries, oil was the largest single item in their dollar budgets. The Marshall Plan made it possible for the European economy to change from coal-based to one based on imported oil. Without oil, especially Middle East oil, the Marshall plan could not have succeeded. There are periods in\n\nhistory, where fortuitous alignments of conditions act as a catalyst to enact change. Europe’s needs and Middle East oil production around that time made a powerful and timely combination.\n\nIt was also interesting to see how oil markets were so important to some countries, that maintaining that stability forced them to make adjustments contrary to other goals and commitments. As a result, construction of the Tapline continued even during the Arab-Israeli War! So concerned were they to not risk losing the American role in transporting Middle East oil to Europe, that they were against us on one front, but in partnership on another front- at the same time.\n\nBritain’s major sources of oil were Iran, Kuwait, and Iraq, and the U.S. was also becoming an ever more petroleum-based society. Therefore, Soviet expansionism, especially towards the Middle East, brought the area to center stage as the Middle Eastern oil fields had to be preserved and protected on the Western side of the Iron Curtain to assure economic survival of the Western world.\n\nOften, and as we saw in earlier years, crisis breeds innovation. Americans were very much aware of energy dependence on the Middle East and how the security of supplies could be assured in a future conflict, and some argued for importing more oil in peacetime in order to preserve domestic resources for wartime. Many also advocated building a synthetic fuels industry by extracting liquids from the oil shale in the Colorado Mountains and developing natural gas.\n\nWith the expensive synthetic fuel route and offshore development, the issue was whether there was another alternative to imported oil. The answer was found in natural gas that was considered a useless, inconvenient by-product of oil production and was burned off or flared. Although not a big percentage of fossil fuel use, natural gas did take some of the stress off by reducing US oil demand. As we see today, natural gas has “saved the day” time and again.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 21 - The Post-War Petroleum Order\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Great Oil Deals: Aramco and the \"Arabian Risk\"\n\nErasing the Red Line\n\nGulbenkian Again\n\nIran\n\nEurope's Energy Crisis\n\nNo Longer \"Far Afield': The New Dimension of Security\n\nThe End of Energy Independence\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat happened with consumption and production in the Post-War era?\n\nWhat were the three great oil deals?\n\nHow did Middle Eastern oil figures in the recovery of Europe and Japan?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 24 Overview\n\nThe Suez Canal is an interesting story in its own right, but it had and has important oil industry implications. Like the Nord Stream and Alaskan pipelines, sometimes efficiencies in moving oil changes the dynamic. So much so that markets become dependent on any “new and easier” way to get oil, and if it becomes threatened, it causes much angst. The canal’s significance was strategic, as it served as a lifeline of the British Empire. When, in 1948, India became independent, the canal lost its traditional rationale of being critical for the defense of India or the empire. It subsequently became a highway of oil and not of empire, as it cut the 11,000 mile journey of Persian Gulf Oil to Europe around the Cape of Good Hope to 6,500 miles through the canal.\n\nIn this chapter, you will read about the conflict over the canal, and how it nearly brought America, Britain, and France to blows. The Suez crisis taught the Western powers about the volatility of the Middle East and the need to work to achieve long-term peace and prosperity in the area. As a footnote, in 1970, fourteen years after the Suez crisis, at a dinner at 10 Downing Street in honor of Anthony Eden, then Lord Avon, Eden offered a special prayer for the British people to discover “a lake of oil” under the North Sea. Interestingly, that was exactly what they found shortly after. It would have been interesting what the British would have done in 1956 if they had known or even suspected they were sitting on such a lake. This is important because we will learn in later chapters how North Sea oil changed the global market in Europe’s favor. After struggling for so long to get oil from others, Europe would finally have its own treasure.\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis and Syria’s interruption of the oil flow through the Iraq Petroleum Company pipelines showed the vulnerability of oil transportation and opened up discussions on alternatives to the Suez Canal and pipelines. The safer alternative was with supertankers going around the Cape of Good Hope. This provided a lower political risk. The Japanese, with advances in diesel engines, and better steel, started to build supertankers capable of carrying a lot more oil.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 24 - “The Suez Canal”\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Nationalist: The Role Finds Its Hero\n\nCode Word \"de Lesseps\": Nasser Moves\n\n\"We Had No Intention of Being Strangled to Death\"\n\nForce Applied\n\nThe \"Oil Lift\" and the \"Sugar Bowl\": Surmounting the Crisis\n\nThe Future of Security: Pipelines Versus Tankers\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat was happening with the attitude towards nationalism?\n\nWhich countries were in a geo-political struggle in the Middle East for access to oil?\n\nWhat aspect of oil strategy provided HUGE political leverage?\n\nThe Quest, Chapter 13 Overview\n\nAs we step beyond the Suez Crisis, the world that does not produce oil now has a critical need to find ways to guarantee their access to oil. Not only to their citizens, but also guaranteed access for their militaries. If a country was only receiving oil imports from one location, it was vulnerable to disruption. If a country increased supply locations, then if one location was disrupted, that would only disrupt a portion of its supply.\n\nIf countries worked together to coordinate a world trade regulation of the oil supply, then countries would be even less vulnerable to one location disruption. This could be further stretched to include a variety of types of petroleum sources, including unconventional sources also.\n\nNot all disruptions of access to oil revolve around war or country disputes; we know how hurricanes can impact drilling rigs and refineries. In 2005, 2900 oil platforms were in the combined paths of Katrina and Rita Hurricanes according to Interior Secretary Gale Norton. “As a result, 90 percent of crude production and 72 percent of natural gas output is paralyzed,” she stated. This natural disaster regarding the oil access was lessened through the coordination of countries to fill the gap left by the tragic weather.\n\nThe challenges facing operating systems are but one element to consider in regard to energy security. Pipelines are another piece of the overall transportation of oil. They have been in the news through the discussion about the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline. This is not to endorse the use of pipelines, but just consider all the pipelines that the United States has\n\nwithout the controversy. Here are two maps that allow you to visualize the interconnections and vast land coverage.\n\nWhere are pipelines located?:\n\nhttps://pipeline101.org/topic/where-are-liquid-pipelines-located\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/state/maps.cfm\n\nThe Suez Canal also made us more cognizant of the “choke point”. These choke points could be compromised by natural and man-motivated actions. Several points have frequent interactions with pirates, or nonstate actors, trying to seize possession of oil and gain profits from selling it. These points are also no secret; any country could cut off the lanes as a specific way to disrupt the worldwide oil supply. It is in most countries’ best interest to keep these points free from disruption. Several navies add these lanes to their commitment to continual order on the sea.\n\nThe Quest, Chapter 13 - The Security of Energy\n\nSections to Read\n\n​​​​Operating Systems\n\nChoke Points\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat is important towards energy security and stability?\n\nWhat are the the roles of pipelines in regard to energy security?\n\nWhere were the vulnerable choke points in world oil transportation?\n\nConcepts to Consider for the Lesson\n\nLesson 8 pulls together many interesting aspects of the immediate post-war era and the entry into the turbulent 1960s. As we move through history, and we get into more contemporary times, we are starting to see the birth of oil industry aspects we are used to in the present day. This Lesson also introduces us to many cautionary tales which may have fallen on deaf ears, and not learning from them has destined us to be reliving the same issues in today’s world.\n\nFor example, in this lesson, we see how unrest and volatility in oil-producing countries can wreak havoc on those countries that depend on those exports. We also once again see the impacts of wild fluctuations in production, causing cycling between shortages and surpluses. These countries are household names now when it comes to global oil markets, but they were only coming into their own in the time period of lesson 8. These countries include Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. Profoundly oil-rich, but politically unstable, places.\n\nOPEC comes into being in this Lesson, a formidable power in the 70s and beyond, but a bit unsure of itself and ineffective in it early days during the 1950s and 60s. OPEC introduced the idea that oil exporting countries had something to gain by working in collaboration, the same lesson the oil companies had learned so many years before, that they could have significant control over the market if they worked together. But the same Catch-22 that plagued the oil companies now faced the exporting countrie; they were producing more oil but getting less for it.\n\nBut what is probably the most interesting chapter of this lesson, and probable one of the most telling stories of the entire textbook, is Chapter 27, “Hydrocarbon Man”. After one reads how oil underpinned so many societal changes, it is easier to see why turning away from oil will not occur as easily, or as fast, as is being suggested by the renewable energy and climate change positions.\n\nThe reading from The Quest start to introduce us to changes to come, such as the entry of the North Sea oil region and how that impacts the global market. But even before then, Europe and the US domination in the Middle East starts to diminish, and the market is settling into a new profile with shifting influence and new players.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n\nRecall course concepts relating to the Post-war Petroleum Order and Crises\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the role of oil in relation to pivotal events in history\n\nDiscuss the role of oil in business applications, global markets, conflicts, energy security, and various unconventional applications\n\nWhat is due for Lesson 8?\n\nThis lesson will take us one week to complete.

The more we talk about these ideas and share our thoughts, the more we can learn from each other.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 26 Overview\n\nIn chapter 26, we see the further evolution of OPEC and the impact of Russia coming back into the game. Except Russia’s approach was not to restrict oil, but the opposite, flood the market and impact pricing and market share. Russia wanted to create dependency on their oil by making it almost “too easy” to get. More than one expert has stated that the current challenges in Western Europe today are rooted in over-dependency on Russian oil and gas.\n\nIt is an interesting approach, and a characteristic of the oil industry, in that providing too much oil can almost be as destabilizing as restricting it. This is why at time embargoes are put in place, but at other times, it is more about quotas. The quota issue is discussed in the context of Middle East oil vs Canada, Venezuela, and Mexico.\n\nThis chapter discusses the development of OPEC and the ill-fated approach that the oil companies and importing countries took by discounting and ignoring them. In later chapters, we will learn how OPEC single-handedly drove the energy crisis of the 70s. Although the OPEC countries were influential, during this period, Africa also comes into the picture. North Africa, especially Libya, and other countries such as Nigeria and Algeria become major producers.\n\nOn a larger scale, things were surely changing. The powerful consortium of oil companies was losing some of its influence as the exporting countries flexed some muscle. Iran was becoming a force to be reckoned with in its own right, but further compounded by appearances that it may align with Russia. And there was an overall growing dislike and distaste for the West. Ironically, the Persian Gulf area, typically seen as the volatile area, became the “stabilizer” of supply to dampen the effect of problems that were popping up elsewhere.\n\nIn their own way, countries and companies were realizing that the oil market was a complex thing that needed care and innovation to work properly. And simple cutthroat competition drives down profits and hurts everyone. They continued to look for ways to work as an integrated machine, while recognizing the differing priorities, cultures, and drivers between countries and regions. Sometimes, this meant setting quotas, which generally aggravated the impacted producing countries.\n\nThe conflicts in the Middle East and Africa spawned the growing discussion in the US about energy security and making sure we have enough for ourselves, while at the same encouraging and supporting global trade. The idea of a stockpile came up. Unfortunately, even to this day in the 2020s, balancing energy national energy security with participation in global commerce has proven challenging.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 26 - OPEC and the Surge Plot\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\n\"We've Done it!\"\n\nOPEC in the 1960s\n\nThe Libyan Jack-Pot\n\nWalking the Tightrope - Iran Vs Saudi Arabia\n\nNational Security and \"a Nice Balance\"\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Learning:\n\nWhat was happening with supply going into 1960s?\n\nWhat impact did posted price cuts have?\n\nWhat level of influence did OPEC’s market power have?\n\nWhere were the next two elephants discovered?\n\nWhat was happening with American oil imports?\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 27 Overview\n\nThe trend in the rapid increase in the consumption of oil continued in a straight line after WWII. For example, both world and US energy consumption tripled between 1948/49 and 1972. The post-WWII oil use explosion was due to a number of factors including economic and income growth, increased standard of living, huge increases in automobiles, increased use of plastics, decreasing oil prices, and exporting countries demanding more and more production to increase their revenue. Thus, production, reserves, and consumption all pointed in one direction-UP, and the saying “bigger is better” engulfed the consumer and oil industry.\n\nCredit: EIA petroleum consumption of selected nations 1960-2008 by U.S. DOE Energy Information Administration from Wikimedia Commons\n\nYou will see in this chapter how oil is the foundation upon which so many things changed in society. At the surface, you may not think they are related- fast food restaurants, suburbs, motels, drive in movies, the interstate highway system, and more are all are rooted in the growth of the automobile and increased mobility of the average consumer. And this only happened because oil was the catalyst behind the growth of the automobile industry. One can debate the wisdom of this dependency, but the fact is that societies became fully integrated with oil.\n\nThis integration of oil was so prevalent that it actually began to unseat “king coal” which had dominated the energy market for over century before. Oil was cleaner (avoiding the “killer fogs”), easier to process, and more efficient than coal so even in cases where coal may have been cheaper overall, oil still won. But coal eventually even lost the cost advantage. The new lifestyle of society would not work with coal as the dominant source of energy and transition was inevitable. This transition was happening not only in the US, but Europe and Japan as well, although for slightly different reasons. Competition shifted from oil vs coal to oil vs oil, as more companies came into the game. And this led to jockeying for position of who has the “best oil.” Enter the additives and special gasolines. When you go to a gas station, note how many variations there are; and think about the early days when it was simply “gasoline”.\n\nWho would have thought that one of the most popular television programs of the time was about the oil industry? In 1962, the number one TV show was the Beverly Hillbillies, with a theme song:\n\n“Come and listen to a story ‘bout a man named Jed, A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed, Then one day he was shooting at some food, When up from the ground come a ‘bub-a-lin’ crude, − oil that is, black gold, Texas tea. (The Ballad of Jed Clampett)”\n\nAnd it did not end there, as we will see later in the 1980s a number of oil industry -based television shows. One of the most famous of the 70s was “Dallas” with the fictional Ewing Oil company.\n\nBut there were dark clouds on the horizon when conflict broke out in several places, almost at the same time. The Arab-Israeli conflict and conflict in Nigeria threatened to cause major disruption of the global oil market. However, with a little bit more work than during previous energy crises, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) approved a relief plan that involved the deployment of supertankers. Under American and international coordination, petroleum from non-Arab countries was sent to embargoed countries, and Arab oil was sent to non-embargoed countries.\n\nThe system of redistributing supplies by the international oil companies themselves where they were needed worked so well that the emergency joint operations were not even utilized. There was simply plenty of excess production capacity to overcome the oil weapon. Thus, it was clear by then that the embargo had failed, with the major losers being the Arab oil-producing countries, and by September, the embargo on the US, Britain, and Germany had been lifted.\n\nThe two lessons the US drew out of the embargo were the importance of diversifying sources of supply and of maintaining a flexible tanker fleet. The worldwide surge after the six-day war, as expected, caused supplies to exceed, at least in the short term, demand, with no worry of availability. Unfortunately, now that the war had demonstrated the importance of security of supply, the hydrocarbon man took oil for granted again and embarked on his old lifestyle, knowing that oil was abundantly available and cheap. This will prove to be a costly mistake.\n\nThe Prize, Chapter 27 - Hydrocarbon Man\n\nSections to Read\n\nIntroduction\n\nOld King Coal Deposed\n\nThe Conversion of Europe\n\nThe Struggle for Europe\n\nCourting the Consumer\n\nThe New Way of Life: \"Six Sidewalks to the Moon\"\n\nCrisis Again: \"A Recurring Bad Dream\"\n\nQuestions to Guide Your Reading:\n\nWhat impacts did surplus have?\n\nWhat was happening with coal at the time?\n\nWhere in the world was trouble now brewing?\n\nWhat gave a false sense of security?\n\nThe Quest, Chapter 12 Overview\n\nAfter reviewing the origins and early years of OPEC, we see the control and worldwide impact this new organization can bring to the oil industry.
