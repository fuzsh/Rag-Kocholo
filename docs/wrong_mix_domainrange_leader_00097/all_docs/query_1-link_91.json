The study originated in my doctoral dissertation, completed at Stanford University under the guidance of Daniel Okimoto, Aoki Masahiko, and Barry Weingast. I am grateful for their intellectual guidance and moral support while I was a Ph.D. student and in the years since. My heartfelt thanks go to Dan Okimoto, in particular, who ﬁrst suggested that I consider a study on Japan’s Ministry of Finance (MOF), and whose gentle encouragement and conﬁdence in my work provided important motivation over the years. I have been a beneﬁciary as well of very helpful feedback and encouragement from Ron McKinnon and Jean Oi, who served on my oral defense committee. Funding for ﬁeld research in Japan as a doctoral student came from an Ai Isayama Memorial Fellowship (Asia/Paciﬁc Research Center, Stanford University), a Harvey Fellowship (Mustard Seed Foundation), and an O’Bie Shultz Fellowship in International Studies (Institute for International Studies, Stanford University). Research carried out in 1998 included a two-month period as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy (IFMP) within the Ministry of Finance. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity this provided to use ofﬁce space and work from within the ministry. The warm hospitality of Professor Higuchi Yoshio, his wife, Emiko, and their children also facilitated two months of preliminary ﬁeld research in Tokyo in the summer of 1996. My doctoral dissertation also beneﬁted tremendously from interaction with the many visiting fellows and visiting scholars at the Asia/Paciﬁc Research Center and the Hoover Institute. Regular discussions with fellow doctoral students Amy Searight, Takenaka Harukata, Yves Tiberghien, To¯ya Tetsuro¯, and Yoshihara Mariko similarly enriched my understanding of Japanese politics and this study. My thanks also go to Ulrike Schaede for helpful feedback on the dissertation. While my doctoral research focused on explaining the breakdown in Japanese ﬁnancial regulation through 1997, this book extends the time frame of analysis to include the process of institutional transformation that commenced thereafter. From 1998 to 2001, my research focused on this process of institutional change while a post-doctoral fellow (1998– 2000), and then as a research fellow (2000–2001), in the Department of Political and Social Change, Research School of Paciﬁc and Asian Studies, Australian National University (ANU). My time at ANU beneﬁted tremendously from the support and feedback from numerous colleagues.\n\nxviii\n\n• Acknowledgments\n\nIn particular, my thanks go to Hamayotsu Kikue, Natasha HamiltonHart, Gavan McCormack, Gregory Noble, and John Ravenhill for their comments and criticism; to Ben Kerkvliet, my Department Chair, for his patience and encouragement as I progressed—albeit slowly—with the manuscript; and to Beverly Fraser and Allison Ley for their aid in the manuscript preparation. The study further beneﬁted from participation in a 1999 conference and book project sponsored by the Australia-Japan Research Centre at ANU. I am grateful to Peter Drysdale for his invitation to participate and for his support of my work. The chapters that follow also reﬂect comments and feedback received at a number of academic forums. From 1999 to 2001, I was privileged to be a participant in the Heisei Bubble Research Group (Heisei Baburu Kenkyu¯kai) based in Tokyo and sponsored by the National Institute for Research Advancement. The project provided ﬁnancial support to travel to Tokyo on a number of occasions. Additional support from the Department of Political and Social Change at ANU enabled me to extend these visits to carry out ﬁeld research. I am grateful to Muramatsu Michio for the invitation to join the project and to Mabuchi Masaru, Kume Ikuo, and other project members for critical feedback on my work, and for enriching my understanding of the political and economic dynamics of the bubble and post-bubble periods. Participation in a project on Japan’s economic crisis, headed by Daniel Okimoto and sponsored by the U.S.-Japan Foundation, also provided numerous opportunities to receive helpful comments and criticisms. I am thankful, in particular, for feedback received in that context from Isayama Takeshi, Robert Madsen, Ronald McKinnon, Daniel Okimoto, Adam Posen, Hugh Patrick, Harry Rowen, Takenaka Harukata, Yves Tiberghien, Maria Toyoda, and To¯ya Tetsuro¯. Financial support from the Shibusawa Memorial Foundation in 2001–2002 enabled me to carry out a ﬁnal stint of ﬁeld research focusing on the progress of institutional change since 2000. I am grateful as well for feedback received at the 2002 Shibusawa Seminar on Japanese Studies. My sincere thanks go to Kimura Masato for the invitation to participate in the seminar and for his help in arranging interviews with industry actors. Final revisions of the manuscript were carried out while teaching in the Political Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. Heartfelt thanks go to Robin Orlansky, Erin Douglas, Okado Yu¯ko, Katagiri Noriyuki, and Annie Cho, who assisted with ﬁnal manuscript preparation. The book would not have been possible without the cooperation of large numbers of individuals inside and outside of Japan who were willing to share their insights and personal experiences with Japanese politics and ﬁnance. Extensive interviews were carried out over a seven-year period, 1996–2003, in Japan, the U.S., and Australia. These interviews con-\n\nAcknowledgments • xix\n\ntributed to the study in a number of different ways. They aided me, as a non-specialist in the area of ﬁnance, to quickly gain a better understanding of ﬁnance—and banking, in particular. Interviewees also often alerted me to publicly available information sources of which I had previously been unaware. Finally, they provided me with information and narratives that aided in the generation of hypotheses. At times, their accounts also helped in the testing of these hypotheses, although I sought whenever possible to conﬁrm the accuracy of interpretations via alternative and arguably more independent data sources. At times, accounts of interviewees conﬂicted. In such cases, I discuss the range of views in footnotes, commenting on the likely source of divergence in perceptions. When unable to reconcile conﬂicting accounts, I ensure that these accounts comprise a peripheral rather than central component of the book’s argument. I am deeply indebted to many Japanese government ofﬁcials, elected representatives, and industry actors who gave generously of their time to share insights and personal experiences, and introduced me to many others who did the same. Interviewees included numerous current and former ofﬁcials of various ranks from Japan’s Ministry of Finance, Bank of Japan (BOJ), Financial Supervisory/Services Agency (FSA), Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI—formerly the Ministry of International Trade and Industry or MITI), Economic Planning Agency (EPA), and other government agencies and councils; Diet members representing the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Ko¯meito¯, and those with no party afﬁliation; policy secretaries of Diet members; current and former staff of the Japanese Bankers Association (formerly the All Japan Bankers’ Federation); journalists, academics, and banking sector analysts; individuals sent from private and quasi-governmental corporations to work at some point in their careers on temporary assignment at the MOF; and, employees of Japanese and foreign banks and brokerages operating in Japan.

I alone am accountable for any errors in fact or interpretation. A ﬁnal expression of thanks goes to two anonymous reviewers for Princeton University Press for their helpful suggestions for revision and to the many friends and family members whose encouragement was critical to the completion of the manuscript. I am particularly indebted to my father who read the entire manuscript cover-to-cover. It is to my parents, Herbert and Patricia Amyx, that I dedicate this book.\n\nJapan’s Financial Crisis\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990, Japan experienced an asset bubble of unprecedented proportions. The Nikkei Stock Index surged in these ﬁve years from below 7,000 to over 39,000, while the price of other assets—and real estate, in particular—multiplied many times over. During this period, the central bank maintained an extremely loose monetary policy, holding interest rates at postwar lows. Japanese banks engaged in a lending frenzy and, in doing so, helped to fuel the surge in asset prices. They extended many loans for purposes of investment in the stock or real estate markets. They extended many more for the buildup of industrial capacity on a scale that could only be fully utilized if bubble-period consumption trends persisted. From 1990, this bubble began to burst—ﬁrst with a plunge in the Nikkei Stock Index, followed in early 1992 by a tumble in land prices. Both developments had a severe impact on the ability of corporate and individual borrowers to repay loans. The bursting of the bubble thus left banks throughout Japan—both large and small—in ﬁnancial distress, burdened with massive amounts of bad debt.1 This bad debt, in turn, weakened bank capital ratios, sharply raising their likelihood of collapse and severely impairing the capacity of banks to extend credit to new borrowers. History is replete with ﬁnancial crises, however.2 In recent decades, many countries have experienced distress in their banking sectors, in particular.3 Since the 1980s, crisis has struck several major Latin American and African countries, Russia, and numerous countries in East Asia. Even advanced industrial nations with highly advanced ﬁnancial systems and seemingly strong banking regulators such as the United States and the Scandinavian countries have experienced severe crises. So, why a book about Japan’s ﬁnancial crisis? At least two features of the Japanese case stand out as distinctive; both are intimately related and pose important substantive and theoretical puzzles. The ﬁrst feature is the extraordinary delay by Japanese government ofﬁcials before intervening to aggressively address the bad debt problem in the nation’s banking system. The resolution of banking crises typically requires the use of public funds to recapitalize banks, augment the depositor safety net, and establish a temporary agency to take control of failed banks and dispose of their assets. Since an injection of public funds is al-\n\n2 • Introduction\n\nways politically unpopular, governments often delay before mustering the political will to allocate taxpayer money to this end. Nonetheless, mechanisms seem to exist in other countries to spur a more prompt response to ﬁnancial crisis than that seen in Japan. According to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) study, those countries that made the greatest progress in the wake of ﬁnancial crisis took a little less than ten months on average before embarking on systemic bank restructuring while those countries making the slowest progress took, on average, approximately four years.4 In Japan, eight years passed from the onset of severe ﬁnancial distress before the government initiated aggressive measures to tackle the bad debt problem and institute fundamental ﬁnancial system reforms. As a result of this delay, what might have been relatively small costs of clean up in economic terms turned into staggering costs. By the time of this action, the amount of bad debt held by Japanese banks was estimated to total 1 trillion dollars or approximately 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).5 Clearly Japan’s extraordinary delay places the country well outside even the upper bounds of normalcy.6 A second distinctive feature of the Japanese case is the ineffectiveness of the government’s ﬁnancial reform and recovery efforts, once initiated. As of this writing in mid-2003, thirteen years after the bursting of the bubble, Japan’s ﬁnancial sector problems remain unresolved. Indeed, regardless of the metric one chooses to use, ﬁnancial reform outcomes have been abysmal to date. This is the case whether we measure success by the speed and degree to which conﬁdence is restored to the ﬁnancial system, the ﬁscal costs incurred in restructuring the ﬁnancial system, or the length of the crisis recovery period, with recovery measured in such terms as percentage of nonperforming loans in the banking system or health of ﬁnancial institutions as reﬂected in capital ratios or proﬁtability. The elusive outcomes are particularly puzzling on the surface given the seemingly dramatic nature of reforms implemented since late 1998. In October of this year, Japanese legislators at last readied large amounts of public funds for use in recapitalizing the banking sector. At the same time, they established a new legal framework for dealing with ailing banks, enhanced the independence of a newly established Financial Supervisory Agency, set up a commission to oversee ﬁnancial reconstruction, revised the Deposit Insurance Law, and strengthened the functions of the Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC), a newly established government-backed asset management corporation (AMC) to aid in the disposal of bad debt. In the wake of these changes, new norms emerged concerning appropriate relationships between regulators and ﬁnancial ﬁrms, and new expectations about standards of transparency were likewise estab-\n\nIntroduction • 3\n\nlished. The creation since 1998 of numerous councils and committees in the Diet to deal with ﬁnancial sector issues also seems to signal a political commitment to resolving the nonperforming loan (NPL) problem. Nevertheless, by most conventional indicators Japan’s ﬁnancial system looked worse in 2002 and 2003 than it did in any year since the bursting of the bubble. Amounts of nonperforming loans held by Japanese ﬁnancial institutions surpassed amounts recorded in 1998, all of the major banks reported net losses, and these banks remained highly vulnerable to a multitude of “shocks”—such as a stock market downturn, adjustments to deferred tax accounting practices, the failure of ﬁnancial interdependent insurance ﬁrms, or a signiﬁcant rise in the interest rates of their massive holdings of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs). Moreover, Japan’s ﬁnancial sector problems today comprise only one component of a complex array of formidable problems that include prolonged deﬂation, industrial stagnation, and unprecedented levels of government debt. Why can’t Japan get back on track? The answer is of critical importance, for the costs to date of Japan’s elusive ﬁnancial sector recovery have been huge.\n\nCosts of a Delayed Response There is no question that Japan’s banking crisis will be the costliest in history. The government’s delayed response to systemic problems in the banking sector has translated into lost output and enormous ﬁscal outlays. In the period 1992–2001, the nation’s average growth barely exceeded 1 percent. This performance placed Japan last among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in growth over the 1990s. Moreover, the second of the nation’s three economic contractions in this period represented one of the sharpest experienced by a developed country since the American Great Depression. The link between dysfunctional ﬁnancial intermediation and poor economic performance has been particularly close in Japan due to the underdevelopment of capital markets and heavy reliance by most of the nation’s ﬁrms on bank loans as a means of capital procurement. Litan and Posen (2001) assert that even if only half of the $600 billion of nonperforming loans they estimated to exist in 2001 were collected, the Japanese government faces clean-up costs of more than four times the share of GDP that the U.S. spent cleaning up its savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.7 Kashyap (2002), moreover, estimates current Japanese taxpayer liability for losses incurred but not yet recognized in 2002 to total at least 24 percent of Japan’s GDP.8 And, in January 2003, the Deposit\n\n4 • Introduction\n\nInsurance Corporation of Japan (DICJ) announced that it expected to spend a total of 11 trillion yen (approximately $91.7 billion) by the end of ﬁscal year (FY) 2002 to guarantee the repayment of deposits at failed Japanese banks alone. This sum represents approximately 100,000 yen ($847) of taxpayer money for every person in Japan.9 Japan’s ﬁnancial crisis has also had important international and regional spillover effects. Depressed economic output, weak consumer demand, and slowed credit ﬂows from Japan—all by-products of the unresolved banking problems—have profoundly affected other economies. The negative impact was felt in particular by Japan’s regional neighbors in the wake of the 1997– 98 Asian ﬁnancial crisis. Japan accounts for approximately 60 percent of the goods and services produced in Asia, and is an important export market for its regional neighbors. The country’s protracted downturn has left it unable to absorb exports as in the past. The inability to ﬁx the banks—a prerequisite to reviving both domestic demand and sustained growth—has also led the government to support an export-oriented recovery and weak yen, policy choices that tend to generate trade conﬂict and foster resentment of Japan within East Asia. As the second largest economy in the world, producing one-eighth of global GDP, Japan’s ﬁnancial woes and protracted malaise also affect the operation of global capital markets, trade ﬂows, and exchange rates. In 1998, in particular, the conjunction of acute domestic ﬁnancial crisis with crises elsewhere in global markets generated widespread fear that Japan might collapse and take the rest of the world with it. The large-scale withdrawal of most Japanese banks from overseas business since 1998 alleviates some of this concern. Nonetheless, stagnation in Japan is clearly a negative for the global economy—particularly when its problems coincide with economic malaise in the United States.10 The government’s delay in dealing aggressively with the bad debt problem also extended the time required for crisis resolution and severely complicated the task. In August 2001, the State Minister for Financial Services, Yanagisawa Hakuo, estimated that a ﬁnal resolution of bad debt problems would likely take up to seven years, even with aggressive actions.11 In 2002, following a further climb in amounts of bad debt held by Japan’s 129 banks, many ﬁnancial analysts and government ofﬁcials conﬁded that even this estimate was optimistic. The price tag associated with Japan’s ﬁnancial crisis reﬂects more than the costs of government inaction. It also reﬂects the costs of policies pursued in lieu of tackling banking problems head-on in the 1990s. In an attempt to “grow out” of the bad debt problems in this decade, authorities carried out a series of massive ﬁscal stimulus measures. This spending\n\nIntroduction • 5\n\nspree led the government, holding an overall ﬁscal surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 1991, to shoulder by 2002 a deﬁcit unparalleled in the industrial world at 140 percent of GDP. This by-product of institutional inertia now poses new and enormous political impediments to spending the massive amounts required to execute a ﬁnal resolution of the non-performing loan problem. Moreover, in lieu of a publicly funded and politically difﬁcult recapitalization of the banks, the government strongly encouraged other private sector actors to privately recapitalize weak banks. The result was a deep intertwining of the fate of banks with those of other ﬁnancial institutions. Insurance ﬁrms, in particular, deepened their interdependence with banks, and vice versa, by engaging in “double-gearing”—a practice involving the simultaneous issuance of new shares for mutual purchase. As a result, regulators would scramble in 2003 to assemble a scheme aimed to preempt the large-scale collapse of insurers, reeling under the weight of years of lower-than-promised yields, because of the disastrous implications such a development would have on banks. The repercussions of policy delay in ﬁnance extend even to Japan’s foreign affairs and to its security alliance with the United States. The need for increased spending on the bad debt clean-up in the presence of a crisis in public ﬁnance has meant budget cuts in other important policy areas, constraining Japanese diplomatic initiatives. In 2002, Japan was displaced as the top provider of overseas development assistance (ODA) in the world, signaling the weakening of one of the nation’s key foreign policy tools. Likewise, defense spending has emerged as a target of spending cuts at a time when Japan faces unprecedented threats from North Korea and corresponding pressure to boost spending to develop a missile defense system. Japan’s ﬁnancial crisis has also had enormous social consequences. According to Japan’s National Police Agency, the number of suicides rose sharply in Japan over the past decade. Beginning in 1998, in particular— the ﬁrst year following a sharp escalation in the ﬁnancial crisis marked by the collapse of major ﬁnancial institutions in Japan—the number surged to over 300,000 a year. The year 2002 represented the ﬁfth consecutive year in which the number of suicides topped this mark. This ﬁgure represents more than double the number of suicides in 1970 and represents a rate of roughly eighty deaths per day. According to the Police Agency, a major portion of this increase is accounted for by a rise in the number of incidents related to ﬁnancial problems, such as bankruptcy or the inability to repay loans.12 To Japan’s life insurers, the connection appears clear: today insurance ﬁrms require a ﬁnancial proﬁle as part of the screening process of new policyholders.13\n\n6 • Introduction\n\nThe suicide epidemic, as it relates to the country’s ﬁnancial woes, extends beyond middle-aged salary workers facing job losses, small business owners unable to repay loans, or youth facing unprecedented challenges ﬁnding work. At the peak of ﬁnancial crisis in 1998, its reach extended into the once vaunted Finance Ministry, the Bank of Japan, and into the national legislature, claiming the lives of three career bureaucrats, a central banker, and a prominent politician. Social costs of unresolved ﬁnancial crisis are also manifest in the rising number of the homeless—once a rare sight in Japan but now more commonly observed due to the prolonged economic stagnation and postwar high unemployment rates. Financial turmoil has clearly affected the social fabric of the nation.\n\nThe Enigmatic Character of Japan’s Crisis Response Understanding the political dynamics underlying the delayed response by Japan’s ﬁnancial authorities is also vitally important because the government’s delayed response to this crisis challenges the conventional wisdom of Japanese political analysis. While most scholars emphasize the incremental nature of policy change in Japan in regular times, they have tended to evaluate this incrementalism as fairly effectual on balance.14 And, most do see crisis as spurring signiﬁcant policy change.15 Examples of adept Japanese government response to past crises make the mismanagement of the banking sector woes in the 1990s all the more enigmatic. The response to potentially destabilizing problems in the ﬁnancial sector in the mid-1960s was swift and decisive. In this period, a cyclical downturn in the economy combined with a depressed stock market to lead a number of brokerages including Yamaichi Securities to the brink of collapse. The government extended extraordinary assistance to the ﬁnancial industry via the central bank and all of these loans were later repaid in full.16 Similarly, the nation’s response to the oil crises of the 1970s was widely appraised as a success.17 When the oil crisis exposed the deﬁciencies of local energy supplies in 1973, the government and private industry responded in such a way that Japan was a world leader in energy saving technology by the time of the second oil crisis in 1979. Consider that in 1984, OECD went so far as to declare that Japan “weathered the second oil shock and protracted international recession better than any other country.” The OECD noted, moreover, that the nation’s distinctive performance “owed much to the timely and appropriate response of policies . . .” (emphasis added). Yet, when historians review Japanese postwar history in the decades to come, no other event—with the exception of the Allied Occupation—is likely to receive more attention than the government’s inept response to ﬁnancial crisis in the 1990s.\n\nIntroduction • 7\n\nHow do we explain this puzzle of extreme variance in the state’s capacity to manage crisis across time? Japan’s recent economic performance is particularly shocking when viewed in the context of its own past record-breaking performance and extraordinary ﬁnancial sector stability. From the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s, Japan’s ﬁnancial system provided a safe means of payment, encouraged and facilitated real savings, and mobilized and allocated this savings relatively effectively to ﬁnance investment. The Ministry of Finance (MOF)’s regulatory policies, informal industry guidance, and heavy inﬂuence over monetary policy were widely seen as establishing a framework for ﬁnancial system stability and prosperity. Despite a number of recessions and exogenous shocks to the ﬁnancial system, the government responded to emerging problems in a way that maintained ﬁnancial sector stability and facilitated economic recovery. Not a single bank collapsed and the system seemed to work well—so well that the pace of the nation’s postwar economic progress was dubbed “miraculous.” Developing nations across the globe—and particularly in Asia—sought to emulate the Japanese model. While Japan’s economic growth slowed after the oil shocks, the nation continued to record growth rates of more than 3 percent per annum from 1981 to 1991, outpacing those of other large advanced industrial countries. When the asset bubble inﬂated in the latter half of the 1980s, no one predicted the severity of its consequences. On the contrary, many pointed to the size and international presence of major Japanese ﬁnancial institutions at this time as a sign that the nation’s economic model—with its emphasis on bank-centered ﬁnancial intermediation—was in its prime. Some even perceived Japanese ﬁnancial and economic might to be so formidable as to pose a threat to U.S. dominance.18 The crisis of conﬁdence that erupted in the next decade was in stark contrast to the self-assurance that oozed from the Japanese ﬁnancial sector, the business community, and the MOF in the “bubble” era. Once the centerpiece of public adulation and hailed as the most competent bureaucratic organization in the world,19 the Finance Ministry became the target of public fury in the 1990s. Simple regulatory incompetence might have been forgiven but the revelation of numerous scandals accompanied the collapse of major ﬁnancial institutions—including the nation’s tenth largest bank and fourth largest securities ﬁrm. These suggested that sector instability might be attributed at least partially to cozy relations between Finance Ministry ofﬁcials and the institutions they were to regulate. Moves by the national legislature in this period to “dismantle” the ministry would have been unimaginable a decade earlier. How could institutional arrangements for ﬁnancial policymaking and regulation work so well for so long and yet also be guilty of leading the nation into such a deep economic and ﬁnancial abyss?\n\n8 • Introduction\n\nUnderstanding the Japanese Government’s Response to Financial Crisis The chapters that follow try to solve the puzzles outlined above by examining the operations of policy networks in Japanese ﬁnance. During the 1980s, in particular, many argued that Japan was an unusually ﬂexible and efﬁcient “network state” that posed an alternative to the more armslength, rules-based approach to policy favored in the West.20 Since the onset of Japan’s recession in the early 1990s, opinion has become far more critical, emphasizing the restraining and collusive aspects of network operations. By engaging in a systematic analysis of policy networks in postwar Japanese ﬁnance, this book seeks to provide a consistent intellectual framework for understanding the over four decades of apparent success in Japanese ﬁnancial regulation, the large-scale regulatory breakdown in the 1990s, and the nature, process, and limits of change in regulatory arrangements since late 1998. The analysis of policy networks in Japanese ﬁnance produces two main contentions. First, the book argues that the same network variable that helps explain earlier success plays a critical role in the explanation for the unprecedented degree of ﬁnancial regulatory and policy breakdown in Japan over the past two decades. The study identiﬁes two intervening variables that upset the political economic system, bringing about a functional shift in Japan’s ﬁnancial policy networks: heightened ﬂuidity in party politics accompanying a shift from uninterrupted one-party rule to rule by coalition government; and, a dramatic rise in information requirements for effective ﬁnancial regulation. As a result of change in these variables, networks once enhancing policymaking capacity in Japanese ﬁnance were transformed into “paralyzing networks” by the 1990s, with disastrous results. The study exposes why and how these networks perpetuated themselves over time, even when utilitarian calculations would suggest they were dysfunctional. Second, the book argues that the challenge of system transformation varies signiﬁcantly across political economies and that the degree to which institutions are embedded in the larger political economy affects the cost and process of system change. By uncovering ways in which the embeddedness of Japan’s Finance Ministry in the political and ﬁnancial worlds was similar to and different from its counterparts in other countries, the study contributes to a better understanding of why Japan’s ﬁnancial system reform and recovery process has proven so difﬁcult. Speciﬁcally, the analysis reveals that the particular structural and agency characteristics of Japan’s policy networks produced institutional legacies and linkages across policy domains that present particularly high barriers and costs to change.\n\nIntroduction • 9\n\nThe above ﬁndings, it is hoped, shed light on the determinants of Japanese state capacity across time, enhance our understanding of the complex challenges facing Japanese government and business leaders today, and point to the types of further institutional reforms required if Japan is to revive its troubled economy. It is further hoped that this case study of Japan’s ﬁnancial crisis will enhance our understanding more generally of the potential role played by political institutions in mediating market forces, and of why some institutional forms are simply more difﬁcult to change than others.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nNetworks and State Performance\n\nNetworks—the collection of people, organizations, or objects connected to each other in some way—are found everywhere. Sociologists have long emphasized the importance of networks for organizational performance,1 and in recent years, scholars and practitioners in numerous other disciplines have accorded networks an increasing amount of attention. Interconnectedness has become a critical framework for understanding phenomena in such disparate ﬁelds as medicine, physics, marketing, and business strategy.2 The ﬁeld of public policy has been no exception. Numerous political scientists have invoked network metaphors and concepts in their analyses of governance structures and processes.3 This book concentrates on the role of networks in ﬁnancial policymaking and regulation in Japan. While networks are ubiquitous in public policymaking, the degree of their pervasiveness in the policymaking process and the properties of policy networks vary signiﬁcantly across countries. In some countries such as Japan, informal networks have played a prominent role in the policymaking process—a role that has often displaced legally deﬁned relationships or substituted for more formal and arms-length regulatory processes. In other countries such as the United States, informal networks are less central to policy outcomes and tend to supplement more formal processes (or undermine such processes, in the presence of corruption). Network institutions may be further distinguished cross-nationally (and often across issue areas within a single country) according to properties such as degree of permanence and transparency, ease of accessibility, and according to structural and agent characteristics. Variance across such dimensions provides a basis for comparative institutional analysis. By showing how Japanese network institutions were similar to and different from their counterpart institutions in other countries, this book seeks to explain the dramatic reversal in outcomes in Japanese ﬁnance over the postwar period, the distinct nature of the Japanese government’s response to the nation’s ﬁnancial crisis, and why Japanese authorities have encountered extreme difﬁculty in restoring the economy to health even after the initiation of reforms. The study identiﬁes contingencies in the effectiveness of Japan’s ﬁnancial policy networks and exposes the salience of institutional differences for the state’s capacity both to manage policy\n\n12 • Chapter One\n\nchange and to change itself. In the process, the study contends that insufﬁcient attention has been paid to state structures and agent characteristics in our studies of associational systems. The design of state agencies such as Japan’s Ministry of Finance and the personnel systems underlying them help deﬁne agent preferences and critically affect the character of policy networks and their adaptive capacities. The remainder of this chapter elaborates on the study’s rationale for adopting a network lens of analysis. It begins by reviewing the evolution of scholarly thinking about the relationship between networks and state performance before turning to weaknesses in existing approaches to network and institutional analysis. The chapter then provides a basis for thinking comparatively about Japanese network institutions by introducing a set of dimensions along which all network institutions might be assessed and highlighting the range of values associated with each dimension. After locating Japanese ﬁnancial policy networks within this comparative framework, the chapter provides an overview of the study’s research approach and introduces the book’s main arguments. The chapter concludes with a preview of the rest of the book.\n\nExplaining Economic Success with Networks The rise to prominence of networks as an object of analysis by political scientists and economists corresponds largely with the development of research agendas examining the relationship between economic policies and industrial performance. Through the 1980s, the “state versus market” debate occupied the attention of many who sought to uncover the primary determinants of successful economic development. Proponents of laissez faire capitalism pointed to the hazards of state intervention and argued that growth had to be market-led rather than government-led. Japan’s unprecedented levels of economic expansion in the two decades following World War II forced a reassessment of the purported hazards of state intervention more generally. From 1953 to 1973, no other country grew as rapidly as Japan. In this period, the nation’s real annual rates of economic growth averaged 9 percent. While the state did not displace the market, as in the socialist states, it was perceived to play a central role in the nation’s economic success through its guidance of industry and intervention in the market.4 In a pioneering study that featured an in-depth analysis of the role of Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in bringing about the Japanese “miracle,” Johnson (1982) labeled Japan the archetype “developmental state.” The emergence of rapidly growing economies with activist states in the wider Asian region in the 1980s further spurred proponents of free-market models to rethink their interpretative paradigms and focus more on the role of the state.5\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 13\n\nYet, as additional research emerged on the Japanese political economy and on the role played by the Japanese government in shaping the structure of industry, evidence of weaknesses in a state-centric explanatory paradigm began to emerge. By many conventional measures, the Japanese government’s economic role was very small.6 Outcomes across a range of policy sectors also revealed a mixed record of success and failure resulting from government intervention.7 And, even within a particular sector, industrial policy outcomes often varied over time.8 Scholars, moreover, noted the occurrence of state intervention and use of industrial policy even in the so-called free-market economies.9 Analysis focused almost exclusively on the state and therefore failed to provide satisfactory answers to the determinants of economic success. As an increasing number of scholars sought to uncover the secrets of economic success in East Asia, the terms of debate began to shift away from whether states should intervene in the economy to how they should intervene and what types of governance structures facilitate positive economic development.10 Scholars increasingly began to dismiss the idea of the state as an autonomous agent and pay greater attention to the organization and dynamism of the private sector and the private sector’s relational ties to the central government bureaucracy and ruling party. Accordingly, a number of works in the 1980s and 1990s de-emphasized state dominance, emphasizing instead a dynamic of constrained interdependence among actors as a key determinant of the policymaking process.11 The causal link between networks of relational ties and positive policy outcomes now being made contrasted sharply with earlier depictions of patronage networks in developing countries where such ties were most often cited as privileging a few at the expense of many and were thereby associated with collusion, corruption, and inefﬁcient outcomes.12 The more positive depictions of network-based policymaking processes were particularly prominent in studies of the Japanese political economy. The network aspects of societal, business, and government organization seemed ubiquitous in Japan, even in the prewar period when family ownership ties linked together business conglomerates called zaibatsu. When the zaibatsu were dismantled during the Allied Occupation, other networks soon emerged to take their place. Bank-centered corporate groupings (known as horizontal keiretsu) and groupings linking major manufacturers with their subcontractors (known as vertical keiretsu) soon became key forces in the political economy. Similarly, school alumni networks (gakubatsu) that ﬁgured prominently in government-military relations in prewar Japan persisted in importance in the postwar period in government-business interactions, as well as in interactions within and among government agencies. The ﬂow of former bureaucrats into the Diet as elected representatives of the ruling party was another prominent feature of the political landscape, making links between the Diet and the bu-\n\n14 • Chapter One\n\nreaucracy particularly close. This network linking the bureaucracy with the political world was paralleled by an even denser network linking government authorities to the private sector, through the ﬂow of former bureaucrats into plum posts in the private sector. Relational networks that blurred the dividing line between public and private seemed prevalent not only in Japan but throughout Asia. With the rise of the four “Tigers” of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong in the 1980s, followed by rapid growth in the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the early 1990s, the correlation between the pervasiveness of network forms of organization and coordination and the region’s economic success appeared far from coincidental.13 Although each of these states seemed to exercise weak formal regulatory control over business, it was clear that they inﬂuenced the private sector in many subtle ways.14 Trust and persuasion built up over many exchanges, rather than power exercised through raw coercion, seemed to more accurately characterize the mode of governance prevailing in the region. Out of these observations emerged cross-national studies of state-market relations and institution building that linked informal and formal “networks” to enhanced state capacity. Most of these studies viewed institutions as historically rooted and highlighted the degree and nature of a state’s “connectedness” to society as a factor underlying effective institutional performance.15 Relationships in networks were seen as more stable and closed than in a pluralist model, providing continuity and predictability in interest mediation. The biggest puzzle was how state actors could be closely connected but not captured by these interests. In a seminal work, Evans (1995) proposed the answer to be a paradoxical situation of “embedded autonomy” wherein the state retained a forwardlooking core, even while maintaining a deep connectedness to regulatory constituents. In these ways, many scholars seeking to explain the determinants of state power shifted from emphasizing the state’s capacity to coerce actors through the exercise of formal power and authority16 to highlighting the role of networks in exercising a form of “soft,” relationally based power.17 The former approach suggested a metaphor for power derived from quantum physics and of colliding vectors; the latter was more suggestive of the forces found in organic chemistry: power in the network state was embedded in the structure of its relationship to the rest of society.18 Observers increasingly linked effective policymaking to persuasion and the skillful management of informal relationships, rather than to hierarchical power struggles. “Effective policymaking” in countries such as Japan had to be carefully deﬁned, however. The nexus of constrained interdependence clearly pro-\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 15\n\nduced policies advancing national economic growth in some issue areas but sub-optimal policies served as a drag on the economy in others. To explain the coexistence of efﬁcient and internationally traded sectors alongside grossly inefﬁcient and domestically oriented sectors, a number of scholars highlighted the differing structure and nature of relational ties in particular issue areas.19 In the “dual political economy,” policy networks more tightly linked to the bureaucracy characterized the more efﬁcient sectors, while policy networks with particularly dense links to the governing Liberal Democratic Party characterized the less efﬁcient sectors. This was not necessarily a problematic ﬁnding since efﬁciency results are never the only criteria for evaluating institutions of governance; social and political stability are often important institutional objectives as well, and their attainment may require measures deemed as objectively inefﬁcient. Economic success in Japan and elsewhere in East Asia meanwhile spurred those adopting a more explicitly economic approach to political institutions to reconsider the potential merits of non-market forms of organization such as networks. Traditional neoclassical economists regarded markets—characterized by the prevalence of arms-length trading relations and pricing mechanisms—as the most efﬁcient and preferable forms of organization and interaction. Williamson’s 1973 seminal work exposed the fallacy of this view, however, by demonstrating that costs attached to ﬁrm-based transactions could be lower than those carried out via the market. This ﬁnding opened the door to the possibility that other non-market forms of organization might similarly prove more efﬁcient than the market alone.20 Proponents of the “new institutional economics” or “new economics of organizations” approach built on this work, seeking to show how social and political institutions arise as the efﬁcient solution to economic problems. In the view of the latter group of scholars, institutions tend to be generated out of the need to solve economic problems such as asymmetric information or the need to attain competitive advantage within a heavily regulated business environment. Adopting a cost-beneﬁt frame of analysis, proponents of this view highlighted the impact of institutions on transaction and information costs, often uncovering elaborate contracts aligning the incentives of actors and enhancing the performance of institutions. Importantly, these contracts were often implicit rather than explicit, thus lending credibility to the informality of arrangements so often observed in East Asia. Patterned longterm interactions, such as those promoted by informal policy networks, made reputation serve as a potential enforcement mechanism, supplanting formal rules, supporting commitments, and enhancing cooperation. When informal institutions performed well, they were depicted as operating in “self-enforcing equilibrium.”\n\n16 • Chapter One\n\nIn summary, a burgeoning literature touted the gains from network forms of interaction and organization in the 1980s and 1990s, linking networks to improved performance by ﬁrms, organizations, states, and even regional economies.21 Scholars adopting both the historically rooted approach and the neo-utilitarian approach to institutions increasingly highlighted the role of networks in promoting information and resource ﬂows, building trust, and reducing opportunism. In this way, networks were widely seen to provide a value-added that could displace or supplement more conventional forms of organization or governance.\n\nNetwork Institutions and Adaptability of the State Implicit in both the historically rooted approach and the neo-utilitarian approach to networks described above was the assumption that network institutions were relatively adaptable to changes in the policymaking environment. Political scientists have long noted the “stickiness” of institutions—that is, their failure to change in strict accordance with the level of their utility.22 Indeed, institutional frameworks often linger on long after their dysfunctional attributes overshadow any efﬁciency-enhancing aspects, and institutional change is therefore rarely a direct reﬂection of changes in cost-beneﬁt calculations to relevant actors. For the former category of scholars, however, institutionalized consultative processes increased avenues for communication, thereby enhancing the ability of state actors to stay apprised of newly arising demands. Furthermore, informal policy networks—such as those found in Japan and arising “not simply from short-term self-interest but out of the function of long-term, obligatory, and affective ties”—were thought to lend an extraordinary ﬂexibility to the political economy.23 This was because the enduring nature of these ties allowed for longer time horizons in policymaking and business strategies. This capacity for longer-term planning was critical, for example, to national economic reconstruction after World War II. At that time, the development of capital-intensive heavy industry required multi-year plans of government support and huge investments up front to build industrial capacities that would beneﬁt the economy over the longer term. For scholars adopting a more economic approach to institutions, the perceived adaptability of networks derived from the belief that inefﬁcient institutions would fail the test of the marketplace. In other words, suboptimal arrangements would be short-lived because individuals and systems proﬁted when more efﬁcient ones were developed.24 Some cautioned against assuming institutional arrangements were optimal simply because\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 17\n\nthe existence of these institutions correlated with desirable outcomes.25 Nevertheless, Japan was seen as maximizing the efﬁciencies while minimizing the inefﬁciencies.26 Aoki’s model of “bureaupluralism” (Aoki 1988), for example, seemed to explain the ability of the Japanese state to fend off institutional inertia. In Aoki’s depiction, Japan had in place highly rational institutional arrangements wherein relational ties such as the ﬂow of former government bureaucrats into posts in the private or quasi-government sector (amakudari) played a key role in enabling the state to stay on top of changing needs. According to Aoki, the personnel system in the civil service and the relational ties that were an outgrowth of this system were also structured in such a way as to fend off regulatory capture. At the same time, attributes of the institutional set-up made the future reemployment prospects for bureaucrats dependent on their successful promotion of regulatory constituencies. In this way, Aoki portrayed the Japanese state as having a “dual face”: on the one hand, the bureaucracy served to delineate public interests, while on the other hand, it acted as a representative or agent of its regulatory constituency. Relational ties played a critical role in boosting the bureaucracy’s ability to do both. Japan’s Financial Crisis as a Theoretical Puzzle Japan’s inability to grapple effectively with its banking system problems for over a decade and the eruption of the Asian ﬁnancial crisis in 1997– 98 provide evidence that something is wrong with or missing from both the historically rooted and more economic approaches to networks. The Japanese case proves particularly intriguing because the reversal of economic fortunes was so dramatic. If the key to the nation’s outstanding performance in earlier periods was a system of “embedded autonomy,”27 then how do we explain the government’s extraordinary delay in addressing the nation’s banking sector problems? Likewise, if we adopt a costbeneﬁt approach to institutional change or a model of “bureaupluralism,” how do we explain the failure to shift in Japan from a system of informal relations-based regulation to a system of formal rules-based regulation when the former institutional arrangement was clearly dysfunctional? The Japanese case serves as a particularly tough test for theories of institutional adaptation and change because even crisis—when the disparity between private incentives and social welfare is publicly exposed, and when the costs of inaction far exceed the beneﬁts—failed to produce timely institutional change.28 Existing theories cannot explain the length of delayed government response to banking problems, the magnitude of breakdown seen in Japanese ﬁnance, or why Japanese authorities are un-\n\n18 • Chapter One\n\nable to restore the ﬁnancial sector to health even thirteen years after the onset of crisis. The case of Japanese ﬁnancial crisis management proves particularly amenable to comparative institutional analysis because states everywhere, regardless of regime type or form of capitalism, must play a prominent role in the management and resolution of banking crises. Rapid and effective government intervention is critical for minimizing losses of wealth, disruption in the payments system, and shortages in the supply of credit for investment and trade. The eventual resolution of crisis also typically involves large outlays of public funds. Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker notes: In this new world of global ﬁnance, it is popular to argue that governments ought to play a smaller role in the economic system, to be less intrusive. But an interesting byproduct of the crises of the recent period is that world governments have been doing more, not less, in this vital area. In fact, recent banking crises have been managed only through extensive and continuing government intervention.29 (italics added)\n\nThe Japanese government’s ineffective response to the banking crisis raises important questions about the adaptive capacity of the institutions that promoted earlier growth and forces us to scrutinize more closely theories of institutional adaptability and change. After the bursting of the nation’s asset bubble at the beginning of the 1990s, it was clear that the state needed to play a signiﬁcant and central—albeit transformed—role. Why was the government unable to act with greater agility and rapidity? The implications of institutional stickiness on public policy outcomes in Japanese ﬁnance have been huge and underscore the need to better understand the nature and function of Japanese network institutions.\n\nUnpacking the Network Metaphor This study sets out to delineate the nature of Japanese institutional arrangements for ﬁnancial regulation, explicate how they perpetuated themselves across time—even in situations when cost-beneﬁt assessments would suggest they were dysfunctional—and analyze both the eventual triggers for institutional change and the impediments to smoother and more complete system transformation. Because a major objective of this study is to derive generalizations about the adaptive capacity of network institutions from the Japanese case, we turn ﬁrst to unpack the network metaphor by identifying a range of properties that affect the character and roles of networks in public policymaking in general. We then locate Japanese network institutions in this comparative framework.\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 19\n\nDimensions of Network Institutions Table 1.1 presents key dimensions of network institutions. For each dimension, we might consider the characteristics listed in the left- and righthand columns as endpoints along a continuum of potential values. The most fundamental distinction to be made in comparing policy networks is the degree of their pervasiveness in or centrality to the policymaking process. According to most depictions, the informal sector has tended to permeate political, economic, and social relations throughout East Asia and to dominate and overshadow—or at least assume equal standing with—the formal sector. In contrast, formal arrangements have tended to dominate the informal in most Western industrialized countries and go hand-in-hand with more arms-length regulatory processes. A second distinguishing characteristic is network function. On one end of the spectrum, network institutions may substitute for more formal structures, evolving to solve particular problems in the absence of reliable formal structures or legal institutions. At this extreme, networks are not Table 1.1 A Multi-dimensional Spectrum of Network Properties Pervasiveness\n\nAll-encompassing\n\nvs.\n\nPeripheral\n\nFunction\n\nSubstitute for legally deﬁned relationships\n\nvs.\n\nSupplement legally deﬁned relationships/ formal rules\n\nStructural Characteristics\n\nConcentration of connections in small # of “hubs”\n\nvs.\n\nNo particular concentration of connections\n\nBarriers to Access\n\nHigh (exclusive)\n\nCapacity for External Monitoring\n\nLow (Opaque; behavior difﬁcult to observe)\n\nvs.\n\nHigh (Transparent; behavior easily observable)\n\nAgent Characteristics\n\nIndividual private interests embedded in or constrained by organizational interests/norms\n\nvs.\n\nIndividual private interests deﬁned independently of collective interests/ norms\n\nDegree of Permanence\n\nOngoing interactions, enduring beyond immediate context\n\nvs.\n\nAd hoc, ﬂuid and issuespeciﬁc interactions\n\nLow (inclusive)\n\n20 • Chapter One\n\na conscious institutional choice, but rather, the default means of making or implementing policy, in the absence of any alternative arrangement. On the other end of the spectrum, relational networks may play a purely peripheral role, with legal structures taking center stage. In this case, networks may be utilized in rare instances when more legal forms of interaction break down or when efﬁciency or other policy objectives can be enhanced through supplementing formal means of organization with network ties. In between these two extremes on the continuum of network function are networks that displace formal structures. Such networks may be nearly all-encompassing and highly pervasive but their centrality may be due less to necessity and more to other factors. Cultural inclinations, for example, might predispose actors to circumvent more formal or legal institutions. Such institutions might also be established due to a diffusion of global norms or out of the sense that the country in question should have such formal institutions, if only to raise its international image. Alternatively, network forms of organization and interaction that displace more formal arrangements might simply be preferred for their efﬁciency implications. In other words, the use of informal relational ties or modes of organization and regulation might be viewed as more efﬁcient and less costly to use than formal structures. Many studies on the role of informal relational ties in China (guanxi) suggest that such networks are endogenous to the inadequate development or support of formal institutions or rules. In this way, such studies suggest that Chinese network institutions might fall near the left side of the continuum described above. Root (1996), for example, argues that guanxi have ﬂourished in China due to the abuse of formal rules-based decisionmaking and notes how networks with connections to ofﬁceholders nonetheless substitute for formal markets, which remained underdeveloped. Similarly, Nee (1989) shows how emerging entrepreneurs in China are able to gain access to capital, labor, raw materials, technology, and markets by mobilizing social patronage networks. Wang (2000), too, demonstrates how guanxi, when skillfully utilized by foreign investors, foster the inﬂux of large amounts of foreign direct investment into China, even in the absence of the rule of law. In contrast to the Chinese case, institutional arrangements in the U.S. might be located nearer to the right side of the functional continuum due to the existence of well-established legal procedures. The aforementioned degree of pervasiveness and function of networks are those dimensions most commonly highlighted in the literature. Yet, numerous other properties also contribute to the adaptive capacities of network institutions and these often receive insufﬁcient attention. Since networks involve an interactive relationship between structure and agency,\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 21 “Aristocratic” Networks [small # of hubs]\n\n“Egalitarian” Networks [large # of connection pts.]\n\nCommand & Control Political Systems\n\nMarket–like Pluralist Political Systems\n\nFigure 1.1 Continuum of Network Structures\n\nattention to the particular mix of structural and agent characteristics is especially important. How might we distinguish between different types of network structures? Buchanan (2002) classiﬁes networks into two types: “aristocratic” and “egalitarian.” In the former, network connections concentrate in a few hubs. In the latter, connections have no particular concentration. Although networks have often been depicted as an alternative form of governance to hierarchical, command-and-control political systems on the one hand and market-like pluralism on the other, we can utilize Buchanan’s structural distinction to place these “alternative” forms of governance along a common continuum (see ﬁgure 1.1). Here the archetypal hierarchical, command-and-control political system represents the most extreme form of an aristocratic network, consisting of a single hub. Meanwhile, at the opposite end of the spectrum, a market-like pluralistic system represents the extreme egalitarian network with a proliferation of connection points. Other characteristics related to network structure include the degree to which new actors may enter the network or network “accessibility.” On one end of the continuum, networks may be highly exclusive with a ﬁxed number of actors and little, if any, opportunity for entry by new actors. On the other end of the continuum, networks may be inclusive and easily expandable, welcoming the entry of new actors. The degree of transparency in network interactions often relates to the accessibility variable. Those networks that are less accessible also tend to be more opaque. Moreover, behavior within the networks tends to be less easily observed or monitored from outside the network. Similarly, those network institutions that are more accessible tend toward greater transparency, making it easier for outside actors to monitor behavior within the network. The relevance of these distinctions is that opacity, inaccessibility, and the sheltering of behavior within the network from external monitoring tends to decrease information costs to network participants and lead to a distinctively low degree of information asymmetry among network insiders. At\n\n22 • Chapter One\n\nthe same time, such an arrangement leads to a distinctively large information gap between insiders and outsiders. Even among those systems where networks are highly centralized, exclusive, and opaque, agent characteristics may vary in important ways. By agent characteristics, I mean the incentive structures in which actors operate and which inﬂuence the nature of agent interaction. On one end of the spectrum, private actor interests may be embedded in or constrained by more collective interests or norms, such as those associated with an organization (one’s employing ﬁrm, a political party organization, or a government ministry or agency, for example). The embeddedness of individual interests in more collective interests often derives from personnel management strategies of these organizations. On the other end of the spectrum, private actor interests may operate largely independent of more collective or organizational interests. The network permanence variable is intimately related to agent characteristics. When agent interests are well integrated into more collective or organizational interests, the time horizon of network actors tends to lengthen, as relational investments made in one individual are often transferable to his or her successors. Network interactions tend to be enduring, in particular, when continuity or stability characterizes the organization or collectivity in which actor interests are embedded. Japanese Financial Policy Networks Given the framework outlined above, where do we locate Japanese ﬁnancial policy networks? As the chapters that follow make clear, policy and regulatory outcomes in Japanese ﬁnance through 1998 represented the product of bargaining among actors within the context of informal but highly institutionalized network associations intersecting in the Finance Ministry. In this way, network institutions were highly pervasive in this policy domain. In the immediate postwar period, informal networks at times substituted for more formal relationships and legal structures. As time progressed and more formal legal structures evolved, however, networks tended to displace rather than substitute for more formal arrangements. Japanese ﬁnancial policy networks over the postwar period appear to be “aristocratic” or “elite” networks, given the concentration of interaction and exchange into a small number of connection points comprising “hubs” in the MOF’s network structure. Three “hubs” stand out: connections to the political arena, connections to private and quasi-governmental ﬁnancial ﬁrms, and connections to other government agencies and the Bank of Japan. Each served as the intersection point for multiple types of relational ties and the nature of interaction within these three hubs\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 23\n\nhelped to deﬁne the Japanese government’s capacity to meet changing needs. The content and strength of these ties, in turn, were shaped in important ways by the ministry’s expansive breadth of administrative authority—including not only the regulation and supervision of private sector ﬁnance, but also ﬁscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies. A caveat must be made here when labeling Japanese ﬁnancial policy networks as “aristocratic” or “elite,” however, and this caveat is important in understanding the evolution of postwar Japanese policymaking and characteristics of Japanese institutions from a comparative perspective. The term “aristocratic” suggests that access to the networks was restricted. Yet, entrance to the Japanese bureaucracy in the postwar period was always based on meritocratic examinations, with any citizen able to take the examinations. In this respect, the door was wide open at the initial point of entry into the networks.30 Japanese ﬁnancial policy networks had an elite character, however, in that only one chance for entry was offered to all; if that opportunity was missed, one was virtually excluded thereafter. Since Tokyo University supplied the large majority of public servants stafﬁng decisionmaking positions in key ministries, success or failure at gaining entry here determined whether one gained or lost the opportunity to enter not only the Finance Ministry but also one of the major Tokyo-based banks.31 Each relational connection through a hub was formed in one of two ways. First, network links were formed when individuals moved temporarily or permanently from one organization into another. These individuals took with them important contacts, information, knowledge, and operating principles and brought back or relayed many of the same to the MOF. Three types of relationships fell into this category: 1) Amakudari or the reemployment of bureaucrats in private or quasi-governmental corporations or as elected ofﬁcials in the Diet; 2) Ama-agari or the temporary hiring into the bureaucracy of individuals from private or quasigovernmental organizations; and, 3) Shukko¯ or the temporary dispatch of ofﬁcials from one government agency or ofﬁce to another. Second, network ties were formed through regularized interaction between individual MOF ofﬁcials and individuals of other organizations. Most salient in the realm of ﬁnancial regulation was the institutionalized face-to-face interaction between ﬁnancial ﬁrm employees called mofu-tan or “MOF handlers” and ofﬁcials in the MOF’s Banking, Securities, and International Finance Bureaus. Japan’s ﬁnancial policy networks were also highly exclusive, containing a virtually ﬁxed set of organizational actors over the postwar period. A cartel-like arrangement in the banking, securities, and insurance industries was supported by regulations that established high entry and exit restrictions; one-party dominance by the Liberal Democratic Party from\n\n24 • Chapter One\n\n1955 to 1993 precluded the entrance of new political party actors; and, a high degree of organizational continuity characterized the central government ministries and agencies. The informality of interaction in these networks and the inaccessibility of these networks to outsiders moreover meant that behavior within Japanese ﬁnancial networks was extremely difﬁcult to externally monitor. While relational networks in Japanese ﬁnance linked individuals together, these individual relationships were ﬁrmly grounded in the aforementioned organizations rather than being reliant merely on personal bonds between individuals. The networks served as an integral part of personnel management and helped deﬁne the incentive structures of individual actors.32 Because organizations such as the Ministry of Finance, the Liberal Democratic Party, and Japanese banking ﬁrms all had extensive historical legacies, the grounding of Japanese network actors in these organizations and their respective personnel systems translated into a distinctive degree of stability and continuity in Japanese network institutions.33 Long-term employment practices in the ﬁnancial industry and bureaucracy and a seniority-based power system in the ruling LDP further supported the tendency for individual agents to deﬁne their interests in terms of more collective organizational interests. Accordingly, relationships and interactions were ongoing and endured beyond the context of any individual policy issue. The mofu-tan ties, for example, went beyond the simple taking advantage of personal relationships; they were distinct for their enduring nature—extending far beyond immediate contexts, problem solving, or issues. Unspeciﬁed obligations were at the core, in contrast to purely economic exchanges entailing speciﬁed obligations or centering on material considerations.34 The distinctive nature of agent characteristics in Japanese networks and the enduring nature of ties becomes clearer when we contrast Japanese networks with those found in China. Guanxi are characterized as highly volatile and often ad hoc in nature, formed to deal with time-speciﬁc problems.35 Policy networks in many Southeast Asian countries are similarly often characterized as highly volatile, revolving around powerful individuals able to make changes almost at a whim and relatively unconstrained by more collective interests. In contrast to such ﬂuidity, Japanese networks tended toward extraordinary stability in the postwar period, characterized by long-term and highly institutionalized ties.\n\nResearch Strategy Linking the Individual and Organizational Levels of Analysis The preceding observations suggest that a better understanding of the distinctive nature of Japanese network institutions must include a micro-\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 25\n\nlevel analysis showing how individual-level interests relate to those of the organs of the state. This study thus combines a focus on the inner workings of Japan’s MOF with a systematic analysis of the ministry’s “connectedness” to other actors. The study builds on existing work by a number of scholars to do this. Most prominently, it builds on the work by Aoki (1988) which links particular relational ties of central government agencies to the incentive structures of individual bureaucrats, but goes beyond Aoki’s stylized facts about the Japanese bureaucracy to account for the particular organizational features of the Finance Ministry and the distinctive nature of policymaking and regulation in the ﬁnancial sector. The approach also builds on Horne (1985), who relates career patterns in the MOF to time horizons of ministry ofﬁcials and the scope of their reform efforts. By drawing on personnel data unavailable to previous researchers, however, the present study carries out a more comprehensive and systematic analysis of such career patterns. The data source used is the Ministry of Finance Personnel Records ¯ kurasho¯ Jinmeiroku), a compilation of career histories of all MOF of(O ﬁcials reaching the division chief rank or above in the ministry proper and in positions at the Minting Bureau, Printing Bureau, and National Tax Administration between 1945 and 1993.36 The compilation also includes career histories of all heads of local ﬁnance bureaus, local customs bureaus, and regional tax ofﬁces in this period. This document provides micro data on promotion, stafﬁng, and retirement patterns in the ministry. As such, it serves as an important basis for the study’s insights into the incentive structures of individual MOF bureaucrats. Focusing analysis on career histories has a number of advantages. It permits access to the full set of cases of reemployment of MOF ofﬁcials in the private or quasi-private sector (not only postings to banks) and allows you to draw possible connections between career paths in the MOF and posts assumed after leaving the ministry. In addition, it enables a better understanding of patterns of secondment from the ministry and the relationship between these postings outside the ministry to career paths. To aid in interpretation, the analysis of data on personnel ﬂows is supplemented with archival research and extensive interviews of current and former central government bureaucrats, ﬁnancial institution employees, and elected ofﬁcials. This part of the research simultaneously helps shed light on the incentive structures of elected representatives, ﬁnancial sector actors, and bureaucrats employed in other government agencies. The examination of personnel matters in the MOF also offers insight into the ministry’s prevailing values at any point in time and into the way in which policymaking was conducted and self-evaluated. Personnel management is a particularly appropriate indicator of an organization’s policy priorities and principles in the Japanese context, where continuous employment in the same ministry until retirement was the norm. Promotion\n\n26 • Chapter One\n\nwithin the ministry serves as a proxy for individual-level bureaucratic interests because it pools together all of the personal incentives—power, material gain, prestige, job security, and the attainment of policy goals— into one variable. Diachronic Analysis of Entire Network Function A number of scholarly works have examined particular relational ties in Japan in isolation, with most focusing on amakudari, the reemployment of government ofﬁcials in the private sector.37 These studies have deepened our understanding of the function of particular networks at speciﬁc points in time and this study’s analysis of the amakudari link builds on this work. At the same time, the present study attempts to provide a corrective to at least two weaknesses found in many of these existing works. First, most studies extract one type of relational tie, such as amakudari, from the larger network structure or system and analyze this tie without considering it in the context of other ties. This is problematic because the way a network functions in its totality cannot be understood simply by examining a single component of the network. Each of the “hubs” in Japan’s ﬁnancial policy network served as the intersection point for multiple relational ties. Multiple types of connections ran through the network hub linking the MOF and the banks together, for example. These included not only amakudari but also gakubatsu or school ties, ama-agari, and mofu-tan ties, and these ties co-evolved over time. In many cases, relative weakness in one type of tie running through a hub was offset by relative strength in another tie running through the same hub. Consequently, extracting any single dyadic relationship from the larger network leads to an incomplete understanding of the rationale and function of each individual tie, as well as of the functioning of the network as a whole. For a better understanding of network institutions, each institutionalized relationship must be located in the context of the network as a whole. Indeed, one strength of network analysis is its simultaneous attention to variation in the patterns and qualities of relationships between multiple actors across time. Such attention permits the testing of a network-centered hypothesis against alternative explanations—such as those centering on interest group, legislative, or bureaucratic preferences. Second, existing studies tend to focus on the function of relational ties at a single point or period in time. In doing so, these studies provide a static account. To solve the puzzles presented by the Japanese government’s response to ﬁnancial crisis, however, we need a dynamic account. The function and effectiveness of policy networks in Japanese ﬁnance has varied considerably over time, and to understand why these networks seemed to work well in one period but not in another requires analyzing the na-\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 27\n\nture of the network across time. Accordingly, the study engages in a diachronic analysis of each of the ties linking the MOF and MOF ofﬁcials to other actors. This analysis is then related to developments taking place across the larger network as a whole. The book traces the genesis and evolution of these relational ties intersecting in the MOF and identiﬁes their efﬁciency- and strategy-enhancing aspects as well as dysfunctional attributes at various points in time. Attention to both dimensions is important: the identiﬁcation of dysfunctional aspects is an important counter to the almost exclusive focus on the efﬁciency-enhancing characteristics of institutions by those adopting an economic approach to institutions; similarly, the identiﬁcation of efﬁciency-enhancing attributes helps build the case against popularized notions of late that the Japanese system was always plagued by poor institutional arrangements and simply “coasted along” without difﬁculties for so long due to good fortune.\n\nInstitutions as “Endogenous Rules of the Game” In adopting the above research strategy, the study utilizes the conceptualization of institutions as “endogenous rules of the game” put forward by Aoki (2001).38 In daily conversation, institutions are often equated with organizations but in the scholarly literature, institutions are depicted in myriad ways. These depictions may be simpliﬁed into two broad categories. First, institutions may be seen as exogenously given “rules of the game” in a particular domain of activity.39 As such, they function as constraints on actor behavior, encompassing not only legal rules but also organizational forms, routine procedures, norms of behavior, and other mechanisms of monitoring or control that help deﬁne the incentive structures of actors.40 Second, institutions may be seen as “equilibrium outcomes”—that is, as the product of repeated interaction among actors in a given domain. Approaching institutions as “endogenous rules of the game” involves synthesizing the concept of institutions as rules and the concept of institutions as an equilibrium outcome of interaction among actors.41 In this synthesis, institutions have a dual nature, arising through the repeated interaction of actors in a particular domain and the set of stable expectations that emerges surrounding this interaction. At the same time, however, institutions guide and constrain actor behavior. In this way, institutional arrangements are “both a dependent variable at time t and an independent variable at time t 1.”42 This depiction of institutions resonates with insights coming out of the policy network literature. Marsh (1998b) and Marsh and Smith (2000),\n\n28 • Chapter One\n\nfor example, link policy networks to policy outcomes and highlight ways in which outcomes may affect networks. Speciﬁcally, they note that outcomes may alter the composition of or balance of forces within a network by inﬂuencing the resources available to network actors and the nature of interests held by these actors.43 Outcomes may also change the broader context within which networks operate, leading in turn to changed behavior by network agents.44\n\nThe Argument in Brief We turn now to provide an overview of the main arguments that emerge from the study. A Common Regulatory Dilemma In the realm of Japanese ﬁnance, the MOF’s networks evolved through repeated interaction among actors in response to dilemmas faced by banking regulators everywhere. Banks play a critical role as ﬁnancial intermediaries, linking creditors and borrowers, affecting the quantity of money in circulation, and transmitting monetary policy to the real economy. Banks also provide settlement services for ﬁrms, allowing them to make payments and manage liquid assets. In no other sector is the cost of a ﬁrm’s exit as high as it is in the banking sector. This is true not only because of the importance of the banking sector to the economy but also because the failure of one bank, if not effectively managed, can trigger a domino effect: other banks may fail simply due to a sudden loss in depositor conﬁdence that leads to the withdrawal of deposits en masse, resulting in a liquidity crisis for the banks. Given the danger that runs on banks create for a nation as a whole, governments in most countries have identiﬁed the prevention of bank runs as a public good. Since depositors have neither the incentives nor the competence to adequately monitor bank management on their own, most governments institute deposit insurance systems wherein a ﬁxed amount of depositor money is guaranteed, even in the event of bank collapse. In the presence of deposit insurance or a similar government guarantee, however, banks have incentives to hide negative information from regulators in the face of solvency problems and to “gamble for resurrection” through the pursuit of a strategy of high-risk high-return investments. This is because neither bank shareholders nor the management have anything to lose when shareholder equity nears zero or becomes negative. At the same time, ﬁnancial regulators, like regulators everywhere, have incentives to hide negative information from politicians, since the disclosure of regula-\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 29\n\ntory breakdown exposes regulator incompetence and invites criticism of the regulator. These incentives for banks and bank regulators to hide information and the potentially disastrous system-wide effects of regulatory breakdown are well known. Accordingly, mechanisms and institutions have emerged in most nations to mitigate these moral hazards and encourage prudent behavior by banks and regulators alike. Banks tend to be heavily regulated, with the primary concern of regulators the early detection of bank solvency problems. “Police patrol” rather than “ﬁre alarm” oversight by elected ofﬁcials is common in the banking sectors of most industrial countries, presidential and parliamentary systems alike.45 In other words, banking committees in national lawmaking bodies tend to exercise relatively constant and close oversight of the government ﬁnancial regulator, rather than making their intervention contingent on the outbreak of problems. This is the case even in parliamentary systems where bureaucrats are typically given considerable discretion to manage without political intervention from the legislature. A Distinctive Institutional Response Deposit insurance was introduced in Japan in 1971, but both prior to and following its introduction, the government offered an implicit guarantee against bank failure. Thus, Japanese leaders grappled with the same moral hazards noted above. Through 1998, however, institutional arrangements surrounding Japanese ﬁnancial regulation deviated from those noted above. A deﬁning feature of Japan’s system of ﬁnancial regulation was the reliance on informal relational ties linking government regulators and ﬁnancial institutions and the reliance on discretionary rather than rulesbased procedures. Dense networks linked the MOF and private sector ﬁnancial ﬁrms and provided a functional equivalent to more formal and arms-length modes of regulation. By facilitating constant communication between these actors, the networks assisted regulators in the early detection of problems. Japanese banks cooperated in sharing information through informal liaison channels with the Finance Ministry because doing so helped ensure that no ﬁnancial institution fell through the cracks and worked to support the maintenance of a cartel-like industry arrangement beneﬁting all members. At the same time, the very opacity of these networks enabled the government to manage negative information in such a way as to preempt depositor or market panic and facilitate the prompt and orderly resolution of any problems that arose. If a particular ﬁnancial institution revealed solvency problems, the ministry drew on its relational ties with other ﬁnancial institutions to arrange an assisted merger (kyu¯ai gappei) behind\n\n30 • Chapter One\n\nthe scenes and preclude formal failure. For much of the postwar period, this mode of problem resolution was a positive sum game for all involved and effectively lowered incentives for banks to gamble for resurrections through early recapitalization. With an unblemished track record until the 1990s in guaranteeing banks in this way, the MOF’s Banking Bureau faced little pressure from the Diet or public to disclose its knowledge about the ﬁnancial condition of banks. While the LDP as a collectivity was deeply interested in the stability and strength of the ﬁnancial industry, the MOF’s management of a bank cartel on behalf of the LDP reaped large campaign contributions for the party while maintaining ﬁnancial stability for the economy at the same time. And, the structure of the nation’s electoral system and paucity of legislative staff provided individual party members with additional incentives to focus their political resources in times of perceived ﬁnancial system stability on policy areas with more direct connections to re-election efforts. These areas included budget making, taxes, and more locally based niches of the economy such as agriculture, construction, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Accordingly, Japan’s ﬁnancial industry was governed by very few pieces of legislation and the large majority of ﬁnancial governance circumvented the Diet. Ofﬁcials of the MOF in the Banking and Securities Bureaus enjoyed considerable decisionmaking autonomy and discretionary authority in their supervision of private sector ﬁnance. The ﬂow of retired MOF ofﬁcials into lucrative positions in private sector ﬁnancial institutions, however, gave the ministry a stake in regulatory outcomes and suggested that ofﬁcials were likely to exercise their considerable discretion in a way that maintained stability in the sector. Any bank that went under meant one fewer potential depository for ofﬁcials retiring from the ministry. In this way, informal ties of an interdependent nature overshadowed the legally deﬁned and hierarchical relationships that often play a more prominent role as general political constraints in other polities in the banking sector. The web of stable and ongoing relationships in Japanese ﬁnance served as established routes of communication and negotiation between organizations and the distinctive network attributes of exclusivity and opacity had important consequences for the ﬂow of information among actors. The networks were also distinctive for their self-perpetuating nature. Relational ties in Japanese ﬁnance were personal, largely informal, and integrated into the incentive structures of individual MOF ofﬁcials. Yet, they were also entwined with organizational interests in such a way that the focal point of decisionmaking for the individual became the organization and individual bargaining power became enhanced by forming as-\n\nNetworks and State Performance • 31\n\nsociations.46 In this way, the ties both linked individuals to organizations and across organizations. Two Critical Intervening Variables Explaining why the same institutions performed so well over the ﬁrst thirty or forty years of the postwar period and failed only from the 1980s on means identifying intervening variables that affected the effectiveness of Japan’s network state. Two prove particularly key: information requirements for effective regulation; and stability in key network hubs. Variation in the ﬁrst is critical to understanding the process of regulatory breakdown. Variation in the second arises after the collapse of the bubble and is critical to explaining the government’s failure to respond effectively to the ﬁnancial crisis emerging from the regulatory breakdown. information requirements for effective regulation\n\nAt their genesis in the early postwar period, relational ties linking MOF ofﬁcials and bankers had numerous efﬁciency-enhancing attributes. The ties were well suited to the reduction of transaction costs central to development—a process that focused on the mobilization of scarce capital resources into productive investments and prioritized stability over competition. The very attributes of informality, exclusivity, and opacity enabled them to serve as a functional substitute for formal regulation and promoted cooperative government-bank relationships. When problems did arise, banks came to the MOF for assistance. Inefﬁcient characteristics of the networks also existed but were kept in check by the relatively low information requirements for regulation in this period. In the early postwar period, the MOF’s Banking Bureau had little need to monitor the ﬁnancial condition of banks closely due to the emergence of a cooperative system of quasi self-regulation advanced by the so-called main bank system. Another iteration of relational ties in the private sector that linked banks closely to their borrowers as well as to other banks gave industry actors strong incentives to engage in prudent lending and monitor borrower behavior in this period. The scarcity of capital also ensured that loans naturally ﬂowed to the more worthy projects and risks were minimal. The heavily regulated nature of the sector and the way in which it was insulated from international ﬁnancial movements further played a role in minimizing competitive pressures on banks. For two decades, the network mode of governance worked well. The negative characteristics of the network came to the surface in the 1980s, however, in the presence of slowed growth and changes in the preferences of ﬁnancial sector actors and LDP politicians. The supply of capital now\n\n32 • Chapter One\n\nexceeded demand. Liberalization and partial deregulation further raised competitive exigencies. As capital increasingly ﬂowed in and out of Japan and corporations were given the exit option, costs of monitoring large corporate borrowers escalated, undermining the effective functioning of the main bank system. Losing large corporate borrowers, banks increasingly loaned to smaller ﬁrms outside of their traditional network, substituting real estate-backed collateral for relational ties. Because the system of relations-based regulation employed by the Finance Ministry had evolved to complement the information sharing and relational ties linking banks and their borrowers under the main bank system, the same informal modes of monitoring and coordination between the MOF and banks were no longer compatible with bank governance structures by the second half of the 1980s. Now that banks operated within an environment of heightened moral hazard, information requirements for effective regulation and supervision were higher than in the earlier high-growth period. The weakness in internal banking sector controls and regulatory structures made the Japanese ﬁnancial sector increasingly susceptible to crisis. Relational regulation was no longer adequate; a different type of power dynamic between regulator and banks was clearly necessary. At two critical junctures, MOF ofﬁcials attempted to shift away from the implicit government guarantee of banks and toward reliance on more formal mechanisms for monitoring banks. In 1971, the ministry failed to gain the banking industry’s cooperation in its attempt to introduce a credible deposit insurance scheme and in 1981, the ministry failed with a proposal to widen formal disclosure requirements for banks as part of the 1981 Banking Reforms. The LDP’s veto of the latter move and the MOF’s inability to impose these shifts upon the banking sector in the absence of political support narrowed the ministry’s regulatory options thereafter and led the ministry to address heightened information requirements for regulation through the deepening rather than the weakening of informal ties. The very opacity of these ties and the information exchanged within them meant, however, that the Diet and general public were less than fully aware of the extent of dysfunction present as time went on. Accordingly, the nonperforming loan problem failed to occupy a central place on the political agenda until many "
