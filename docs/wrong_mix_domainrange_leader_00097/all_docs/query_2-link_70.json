        "text": "The history of modern Japan began in 1868 when the rule of absolutist government of Tokugawa Shogunate that had reigned over Japan for centuries was broken. Following the restoration of Emperor’s ruling power a new central government established and the country experienced profound social, economic and political change. The political thinkers, intellectuals and statesmen of Meiji “Enlightenment” introduced modern Western concepts including Western knowledge, weaponry, technology, even Western dress to the Japanese audience. In the international world of 19th century which was completely dominated by European nation states the Western ideals were a source of inspiration for many Japanese. At the same time Japan felt an immediate need to protect itself in the hostile and aggressive world of Western empires. Unequal treaties were forced on Japan during 1850s and 1860s following the forced opening of the country by U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry mission in 1853. By virtue of these treaties Japan’s control over its own foreign trade was limited and extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreigners in Japan were imposed. Japanese statesmen regarded Westernization in compatible with Japanese traditions as the only way to counter Western threat and to improve Japan’s international status.\n\nThe structure of the Meiji constitution placed Hirohito at the top of the state with a wider range of authority and influence that made him the most powerful political figure in Japan. He had the authority to enact constitutional amendments, determine administrative organizations, grant pardons, and determine military organization. Chief priest of the nation, he could issue imperial ordinances without legislative check. He could conclude treaties and no parliamentary consent was required. He was able to declare war and make peace, and the Diet was not allowed to intervene. As stated in, Article 11 of the constitution, the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy were under the emperor’s direct control. Articles 11 to 13 took away matters from the civilian government and placed them under the responsibility of the emperor. The military was outside of the authority of the civil government, and consequently before any action or operation by military troops, the emperor was to be advised most notably by the Chief of the General Staff Office of the Army and the Chief of the Naval Staff Board.\n\nAfter the collapse of the long-standing Tokugawa regime (1603–1867), Japan under the Meiji emperor (1867–1912) rapidly implemented the process of modern nation-building by effectively utilizing the venerable institution of the emperor (Tennō) as its new national symbol. Following the imperial restoration, the Meiji government abolished the socioeconomic and political privileges of the samurai class, namely its exclusive right to bear arms, hold office and receive hereditary stipends. By 1900, Japan had already equipped itself with a modern Constitution that defined citizens&#39; rights and obligations, a parliamentary system, an updated judicial system, universal education, a restructured national and local bureaucracy, national standing army, private ownership of land, and a nation-wide taxation system. None of these institutions had existed prior to 1868. All of the developmental innovations listed above were instituted within little more than a quarter century after the collapse ...\n\nOn December 25, 1926, Emperor Taishō died. On November 10, 1928, at twenty-five years old, Hirohito came to the throne. He became officially the 124th emperor of Japan. This marked Japan’s entry into the Shōwa era, meaning “radiant or enlightened peace.” According to the 2,600-year-old tradition, the emperor was regarded as a monarch of divine essence, for whom Article 3 of the constitution of February 11, 1889, enshrined the “sacred and inviolable” character of his person.8 The structure of the Meiji constitution and the de facto divine status inherited by birth placed Hirohito at the top of the state. He was the nation’s highest spiritual authority and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. All branches of government, including the Diet and the cabinet, had to refer to him before making any important decision."
