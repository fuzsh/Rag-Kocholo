        "text": "Koxinga, a half-Japanese, half-Chinese buccaneering general of the mid-17th century, achieved fame as a leader of resistance to the Manchu invasion of China by Ming loyalists. Following the triumph of the Manchu Qing dynasty, he moved his forces to Taiwan, where they defeated the Dutch colonial regime. His family then ruled the island as an independent fiefdom for 20 years until the Qing invaded and incorporated it within their empire. Koxinga has enjoyed a long and varied posthumous career as a deified ancestor figure for Han colonists in Taiwan, a symbol during the colonial period of the island's intimate ties to Japan, and a totem of anti-imperialist defiance for Chinese nationalists. This chapter analyses how his heroic reputation has been reinterpreted or reimagined in contemporary Taiwan, mainland China and Japan, focusing especially on his portrayal in museums and public memorials. It argues that major political and ideological changes in Taiwan and China have been reflected in major shifts in emphasis in the portrayal of Koxinga. Almost universally viewed as a symbol of indissoluble 'Chinese' unity in the 1970s, today interpretations of his significance have diverged. While on the mainland Koxinga still symbolises monolithic ethno-cultural unity of all Chinese people, on Taiwan he has come to symbolise a multicultural Taiwan distinct from China.\n\nWhen Japan joined the late nineteenth-century “scramble for colonies” by annexing Taiwan in 1895, the perceived urgency of “civilizing its natives” prompted questions about the nature of “civilization” itself. How could the Japanese, who had for centuries considered China to be civilization’s very fountainhead, “civilize” an island largely populated by Chinese immigrants and their descendents? The writings of Inō Kanori (1867–1925) can be viewed as an attempt to resolve this dilemma. In his ethnology, Inō adopted the Middle Kingdom view of “civilization” as “conformity to Chinese customs and obedience to the Qing”. In his historical writing, however, Inō regarded the custodians of Chinese civilization, the Qing dynasts, as “backward” for failing to prosecute a “civilizing mission” among the island’s non-Han indigenes. In both historical and ethnological modalities, Inō conceptualized Taiwan Aborigines as losers against the Han Chinese in a centuries-long “struggle for survival”, thereby accusing the Qing of neglect, while portraying the Japanese as guardians and enlighteners of the Aborigines. By invoking an EuroAmerican “civilizing mission” discourse, Inō argued that Japan’s Aborigine policy, by contrast to the Qing’s, confirmed its place among the civilized and modern colonizing powers."
