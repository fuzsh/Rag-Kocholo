        "text": "PROLOGUE\n\nFew events have ever shaken a country, or become part of the national consciousness, in the way that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor affected the United States. Even today, more than seven decades after that fateful Sunday, almost every American knows the date December 7, 1941. Everyone knows what happened on that date – the start of World War II in the Pacific.\n\nIt is common knowledge. It is also wrong.\n\nFor World War II in the Pacific did not begin at 7:55 am local time on December 7, 1941 with the massive surprise attack on the base of the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor: an attack that sank virtually all the fleet’s battleships and left it, in the word of one official message, immobilized and unable to help fight against the Japanese hell that was about to descend on Southeast Asia.\n\nBy 7:55 am on December 7, World War II in the Pacific had been in progress for more than eight hours.\n\nThe first act of the war was not nearly as spectacular as Pearl Harbor, but it was just as dramatic. And deadly. It took place over the South China Sea, off the coast of what is now Cambodia. There, an Australian pilot by the name of Patrick Bedell and his flight crew, operating a British Royal Air Force Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat out of Singapore, was intercepted by Japanese fighters. Shot down in an exploding fireball, Bedell and his flight crew were killed, their bodies never found.\n\nTheir crime? They had gotten too close to the Japanese invasion fleet destined for British Malaya, now called Malaysia.\n\nWhile Pearl Harbor attracted all the headlines, for obvious reasons, the deaths of Patrick Bedell and his crew were actually the more significant incident. For Pearl Harbor was only the means to an end. Bedell and his crew were standing in the way of the ultimate goal: the conquest of tin- and rubber-filled Malaya with its fortress of Singapore and the oil-rich islands around the Java Sea – Borneo, Sumatra, and Java.\n\nIn the time immediately after Pearl Harbor, the war in the Pacific became something of a blur, as the Japanese juggernaut quickly racked up conquest after conquest. Lost in that blur were the efforts of Patrick Bedell and small groups of British, Australians, Americans, and Dutch, whom the attack on Pearl Harbor had left largely isolated in the Far East, to fight the Japanese advance alone.\n\nThe back of their resistance would be broken by their defeat at the hands of the Japanese at the Battle of the Java Sea. But by then the Java Sea Campaign, as the US Navy would later call it, was largely decided. It had long since stopped being a test of arms and had become a test of character.\n\nThese Allied troops were thrown together by circumstances; cut off from reinforcement or in many cases retreat; operating with old, obsolete equipment and dwindling supplies; unable to get any rest, and, perhaps the most daunting feature of this campaign, enduring Japanese air attacks day after day after day. With few notable exceptions, their goal was not to win – that was impossible – but to delay the Japanese. Facing a relentless and thoroughly vicious enemy, these Americans, British, Dutch, and Australians responded not by running or surrendering, but by defiantly holding on, trying to buy weeks, days, hours. They were the modern 300 Spartans of Leonidas, a thin line of defenders sent forward to delay a thoroughly alien invader until a better line of defense – and offense – could be established.\n\nBut the knowledge that they were alone, cut off, outnumbered, outgunned, would take its toll. The certainty that every day with the rising sun would come Japanese bombs falling from the sky would eventually take its toll. This is evident from the titles of some of the relatively few books written about parts of this campaign: The Fleet the Gods Forgot; The Lonely Ships; Every Day a Nightmare; Playing for Time; Another Six Hundred.\n\nThese were the men of the US Asiatic Fleet, the British Eastern Fleet, the Royal Netherlands Navy’s East Indies Squadron and the Royal Australian Navy – and their supporting units like Patrol Wing 10, the Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service, the US Army Air Force’s 17th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional), and submarine crews from all these fine nations.\n\nThis is their story – the story of how they ended up in the Java Sea Campaign, and of how they fought, endured, and suffered, through those first months of the War in the Pacific. This book is for them, to them and to their memory. It aims to preserve their exploits, their sacrifices, and their accomplishments.\n\nMany books have covered various parts of the Java Sea Campaign – commemorating fleets such as the US Asiatic Fleet, Force Z, and the East Indies Squadron, individual ships like the Houston, the Perth, and the Exeter, units such as Patrol Wing 10, the Far East Air Force, and the Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service. But few have covered the naval campaign in its entirety – from the hammer blows of the destruction of the Far East Air Force and Force Z in the first days of the war, which crippled Allied resistance in the Far East, to the attempted escape of the remnants of ABDACOM and its naval forces in the early days of March 1942. This book will attempt to fill that void so that, hopefully, the struggles of our servicemen in the early days of the Pacific War may be better understood and appreciated.\n\nTo preserve the memory of these men and their achievements, this book is written not just for historians and scholars (both amateur and professional), but also to people new to history, looking to explore for the first time our fascinating past and what it can teach us. It therefore tries to simplify. The use of military acronyms is kept to a minimum, time is presented in the civilian, 12-hour format (local unless otherwise noted), and military terms such as crossing the T or line turn are explained in either the text or the notes.\n\nThe reader is encouraged to check out the endnotes. Not only do they form the factual basis for this narrative, but they are also a concerted effort to acknowledge previous histories detailing various elements of the Java Sea Campaign. Those authors and researchers deserve credit for their efforts at preserving the memory of this overlooked World War II campaign.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the reader should be aware of one critical consideration: every word of this book, every conclusion, every praise, every criticism, is written from the perspective of an attorney sitting safe at a desk some seven decades removed from the events described herein, who will hopefully never be subject to the horrors experienced by the subjects of this book, writing not because the job requires it, but out of a love of and fascination with the Java Sea Campaign that has existed since childhood. It is in my capacity as an attorney that I made a shocking discovery. While writing this book, I was asked to provide legal assistance to a veteran of the Pacific War who had served in Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and his wife. After the matter was completed, I discussed the war with the veteran and heard some remarkable stories. I thanked him for his service in the Pacific War, in protecting the freedom of speech that allows the publication of this book. After that, I left.\n\nA half hour later I received a call from his wife. She told me how meaningful my thanks had been to him, because, as he explained it to her, he had never been thanked for his World War II service.\n\nTo me this was both shocking and shameful.\n\nSo, in my own small way, Rising Sun, Falling Skies is an effort to say to these heroes of the Pacific who served in the Java Sea Campaign with little in the way of appreciation or even acknowledgment, and to all of our veterans and our current servicemembers who are deployed around the world protecting the freedoms we enjoy, though we may not fully appreciate them, these two words:\n\nTHANK YOU.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nON THE DAY BEFORE\n\nOn the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Vice Admiral Ozawa Jisaburo stood on the spacious bridge of his flagship, the heavy cruiser Chokai, looking out over the South China Sea, preparing to carry out the invasion of Malaya.¹ Though the marquee event was to take place thousands of miles away at Pearl Harbor, Ozawa was in the real center of the action, the real objective of the Japanese war effort – the conquest of Malaya (now Malaysia) and the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia): Strike South, as the Japanese sometimes referred to this massive operation, or the Centrifugal Offensive, as US military theorists would later call it.\n\nThis was the beginning of World War II in the Pacific, and Admiral Ozawa, as well as everyone on the naval general staff in Tokyo, knew it. It has often been said that World War II was actually a continuation or an extension of World War I. That may have been true in Europe. But not in the Pacific. While World War I did have some effect in East Asia and the Pacific, World War II in the Pacific, or the Pacific War, was essentially unrelated to World War I or, for that matter, World War II in Europe. On the contrary, it has been argued that this Pacific War was a natural (some might say inevitable) outcome of the meteoric rise of Japan.\n\nThe seeds of the Pacific War were indeed many and varied, but probably the most direct route to the war was opened on July 8, 1853, when, propelled by the US annexation of California, the opening of Chinese ports, the shift from sail to steam, and the growth of the American whaling industry, Commodore Matthew Perry from the US Navy sailed into Tokyo Bay with his four ships to re-establish trade and discourse between Japan and the western world, or at least to agree to open certain ports to American trade and to replenish coal and supplies for the US commercial whaling fleet. For America, it was the age of Manifest Destiny, and Japan was needed to help attain that destiny. For Japan, which had isolated itself from most foreigners since 1626, Perry’s arrival and refusal to brook opposition to any aspect of America’s request proved to be as traumatic as the Japanese response was ultimately dynamic – dynamic in a way few countries have ever been able to achieve. On March 31, 1854, Japan signed the Treaty of Kanagawa signaling friendship between the two countries, opening two ports to American ships, agreeing to help American ships and their passengers and crews shipwrecked on the Japanese coast, and allowing American ships to buy supplies, coal, water, and other necessary provisions in Japanese ports.\n\nThis victory for the Americans, after a celebratory feast, ultimately precipitated a national upheaval for Japan, sowing the seeds that would later come to fruition in the Pacific War. In 1867, Japan’s military dictatorship, known as the Tokugawa Shogunate, was removed from power and the archaic, feudal shogunate system for rule by generals was dismantled. Now Japan would be ruled by an emperor.² This was considered a major improvement. Starting in 1868 with the official fall of the Tokugawa, rule by an actual emperor who had real power was restored to Japan. This throne was occupied by a man who, during his lifetime, was known to the West by his given name of Mutsuhito; since according to Japanese tradition, the given name of the emperor was not referenced during his rule. However, like many royal families in Asia, he was given a second name to be used posthumously, especially in Japan. It was by this name that this emperor’s rule would become known to history: Meiji.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration, as this era would eventually become known, would be marked by an amazingly swift change from an isolated, feudal, agricultural society to a modern, industrialized one with ties and influence the world over. Japan began a crash course in modernization that may be unrivaled in all of human history, in terms of both the scale of its effort and its phenomenal success.\n\nThe new powers of the emperor were enshrined in a Constitution of the Empire of Japan, usually called the Meiji Constitution, a rather complicated and somewhat controversial blueprint for the new Japanese government. After the Meiji Constitution came into effect in 1890, Japan became a constitutional monarchy, of a sort. The emperor was constitutionally limited to absolute power. The civilian government was parliamentary in nature, but the national parliament, the Diet, had little real power. Historically, however, the Japanese emperor had not ruled directly. The emperor, who was also the chief priest of Japan’s state religion, Shintoism, was believed to be the descendant of the sun goddess Amateratsu of the southern island of Kyushu so an element of divinity was always attached to the emperor’s image. The emperor was separated from his subjects by concentric circles of advisors, courtiers, generals, ministers, and the imperial bureaucracy. This separation was an extensive and deliberate construct, intended to protect the emperor. It is in this context that the Meiji Constitution with its vague and sometimes contradictory terms must be understood.\n\nUnder Meiji, Japan moved relentlessly forward with modernization, industrialization, and Westernization. Meiji had seen what had happened to neighboring China, with the European powers using the weakness and corruption of the ruling Qing Dynasty to nibble away at its sovereignty – resulting in concessions that gave sovereignty to the French in part of Shanghai, to the British in Hong Kong, to the Germans in Tsingtao, and so forth. He was determined that this would not happen to Japan. And the Japanese, with an admirable determination, modernized within the space of a generation.\n\nBut that modernization, industrialization, and Westernization had a very dark thread running throughout, a subtle thread that went little noticed in the West. Japan had been isolated for more than 200 years as a response to initial visits by aggressive Christian missionaries starting in the 16th century who, the Tokugawa and the emperor felt, threatened Japan’s Shinto religion. In 1626, Christianity was banned in Japan and the country closed its doors to outsiders. To the Japanese, the Americans and Europeans were barbarians – although that particular feeling was mutual – so Perry’s entry into Tokyo Bay and his refusal to accept any compromise was offensive, intolerable, humiliating. It was a loss of face, an always ephemeral concept that remains hugely important in Asia and imperfectly understood in the West.\n\nMeiji and his advisors came up with a solution that would turn Westernization on its head. In essence, they would learn all they could about the Europeans and Americans, copy their industry, modernize the Japanese military, and then drive the barbarians out of the Japanese home islands. Japan would drive outward, conquering its neighbors to create a buffer zone that would prevent the Europeans and Americans from ever setting foot on Japanese soil again.³\n\nSoon enough, Japan was indeed copying those European powers in helping itself to pieces of a corrupt and weakening empire. With a desperate need for resources and space for its exploding population, in 1894 Japan went to war with China for control of Korea, which both countries had been ruling as a co-protectorate. Using the pretext of Korea’s Tonghak Rebellion, which both Japanese and Chinese troops had been sent to quell, the Japanese marched down the strategic Liaotung (Liaodong) Peninsula west of Korea and captured the strategic port of Port Arthur (now the Lüshunkou district of Dalian). China had been considered stronger than Japan up to this point, so Japan’s rapid defeat of Chinese land and naval forces demonstrated to the world that Japan had become a military power to be reckoned with. Under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895, China recognized the independence of Korea, which was now ruled by a Japanese puppet government, and ceded Formosa (Taiwan), the Pescadores Islands, and the Liaotung Peninsula to Japan, including the forced leasehold of Kwantung, an area at the tip of the Liaotung Peninsula that included Port Arthur. Alarmed at the sudden Japanese aggression and expansion, Germany, France, and Russia under the terms of the Triple Intervention agreement – a direct response to the first Sino-Japanese conflict – threatened war with Japan if it did not give up Kwantung. The Japanese were outraged, but they could not very well fight three major powers at once – yet – and they returned Kwantung to China.\n\nHaving possessions on mainland Asia, however, put Tokyo on an imminent collision course with Russia and its eternal search for a warm-water port. In December 1897, the Russian Far East Fleet arrived up to occupy Port Arthur, essentially doing some base-shopping and counting on the guns of the fleet’s battleships to smooth out any negotiations on price. Sure enough, shortly thereafter, having only just regained control of Kwantung, the Chinese agreed to lease it to the Russians for a pittance. The Russians immediately began fortifying the city and building a rail line to link Port Arthur to Mukden in Russian-controlled Manchuria, moving their Far East Fleet to Port Arthur.\n\nThe Japanese government in Tokyo was livid, but was also rapidly learning this game of international power politics. In 1902, Japan agreed to an alliance with Great Britain, its first with a Western power since the Meiji Restoration. It was another sign of the coming of age of Japan, and as such contained emotional significance to its people. From a practical standpoint, though, this alliance was clearly aimed at Russia, who now would have to worry about a two-front war and be unable to bring its full military power against Japan or Britain.\n\nThat nice piece of diplomatic maneuvering completed, what followed was the Russo-Japanese War, a seemingly small affair with large strategic implications. Tokyo declared war on Russia – after the Combined Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy⁴ had found the Russian Far East Fleet off Port Arthur, sunk most of it, and bottled up the rest inside the harbor.⁵ Once again, the Imperial Japanese Army marched down the Liaotung Peninsula and laid siege to Port Arthur. After several months of fighting with extremely heavy casualties, Japanese troops captured the city and destroyed the remnants of the Russian Far East Fleet. Meanwhile, the tsar had sent the Baltic Fleet halfway around the world to relieve Port Arthur. The Japanese destroyed that fleet, too, at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. The United States brokered an end to the war through the Treaty of Portsmouth, which recognized Tokyo’s gain of Kwantung, Port Arthur, and its railway, but, much to Japan’s anger at the United States, failed to grant Japan the indemnity it wanted to pay off its huge war debts. Nevertheless, Japan had emerged from its first major war with a European power victorious.\n\nNow Japan was acknowledged by all as a great power in its own right. Its interests, its wishes, its needs, its actions would have to be seriously considered in any foreign initiative in East Asia and the Pacific. But herein lay seeds of the Pacific War. East Asia was a crowded place (it still is), with Britain ruling Malaya, Singapore, and northwest Borneo; the Netherlands ruling the East Indies; the French ruling Indochina; the United States, through its victory in the 1898 Spanish–American War, holding the Philippines and Guam; China ruling whichever parts of China it had not yet conceded to Europeans; and Russia wanting to expand and control everything within its reach. If Japan’s expansionist appetite continued, it was bound to bump against these other powers in its neighborhood, with unpredictable results.\n\nJapan’s wars with China and Russia, though not without significant cost, had been of immense benefit to the rising empire. Emperor Meiji died in 1912, having presided over the almost total transformation of Japan, at least outwardly.\n\nMeiji was succeeded by his son the Crown Prince Yoshihito, who would eventually become known by his posthumous name as the Emperor Taisho. Taisho was physically weak and sickly and overcome with vanity; moreover, while highly intelligent, he had either no concern or no talent for politics. Meiji doesn’t seem to have had much hope for Taisho, and had been grooming his grandson, Taisho’s son Hirohito, for the throne.\n\nWeak as the new emperor was, however, the eruption of World War I on the other side of the globe would provide Japan with more opportunities to expand its influence throughout the Far East and deep into the Pacific.\n\nOn August 23, 1914, Japan was one of the first countries to declare war on Germany in support of its ally Great Britain. It had offered this support in return for German lands in Asia, and Britain agreed, asking for Japan’s help in destroying German raiders in Chinese waters. Germany held a lease on the Chinese port of Tsingtao (which the Germans called Tsingtau), at the end of the Shantung (Shandong) Peninsula across the Yellow Sea from Port Arthur. The German Navy kept a small fleet here that it used to patrol the German island holdings in the Pacific, which included Saipan and Tinian in the Marianas chain, the Caroline Islands (including a fine harbor at Truk), and the Marshall Islands. These German holdings now became immediate targets for Japanese attack. Germany recalled its warships to Tsingtao, but the Japanese Army moved down the Shantung Peninsula and took the city. Deprived of its principal base in the Far East, Germany had to abandon the Marianas, Carolines, and Marshalls to the Japanese. Quick, simple, and effective.\n\nElsewhere, things did not go as well for Japan, at least not politically. Japanese strategy always called for another Tsushima, or a decisive battle, in which the Imperial Japanese Navy would commit its main battle fleet to destroy the enemy in a single big battle. This theme would later appear time and again in World War II. So when the British requested Japanese assistance in the Mediterranean, the imperial government did not see another Tsushima opportunity developing there – certainly not a situation that would directly benefit Japan. Consequently, Tokyo sent only four destroyers to help the Royal Navy. Unsurprisingly the British were underwhelmed.\n\nUltimately, World War I was officially ended by the Paris Peace Conference, of which the infamous Treaty of Versailles was only a part. Japan was allowed to keep Tsingtao (which it later relinquished), Saipan, Tinian, the Carolines, and the Marshalls. The Japanese thought their effort in the war merited more of a reward; the British, upset at receiving only four Japanese destroyers to help them in the Mediterranean, thought Japan was lucky to be getting that much.\n\nAnd with that, another seed of the Pacific War was sown. Japan was now the only major potential rival to Britain and the United States for power in the Far East. Moreover, it would be able to use those same territorial gains to threaten US-held Guam and had the potential to cut off the Philippines from American support and supply. This new strategic reality was not lost on American and British military analysts. The likelihood of another war increased.\n\nIt would increase further through a series of arms control treaties that, like most arms control treaties, were well-meaning but deeply flawed. One of the causes of World War I had been a naval arms race between Britain and Germany that centered on the construction of the highly effective but expensive dreadnought class of warship. In reality, World War I did not terminate that contest; it just replaced Germany with Japan. The desire to end this expensive arms race was the impetus behind the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Signed by Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan, the intent of the treaty was naval disarmament and limitations on future naval construction. Capital ships (which at this time meant battleships and battlecruisers, the latter of which were essentially battleships without the armor) and aircraft carriers, that new type of fighting ship still in its infancy, were specifically limited in terms of the tonnage a country was allowed to have, as well as the size of each ship. In terms of total tonnage, the accepted ratio for Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy was approximately 5:5:3:1.75:1.75.⁶ No capital ship could have guns larger than 16in. Construction of new capital ships was prohibited. Cruisers were not limited in total tonnage, but could be no larger than 10,000 tons each. Destroyers were limited to 1,500 tons each.⁷ Furthermore, in the Pacific no country was permitted to build new bases or fortify existing bases between Tokyo and Singapore.\n\nThrough the remainder of the roaring 1920s, battleships were scrapped or converted into aircraft carriers (which was allowed, since no one had any carriers yet) in order to comply with the Washington Treaty limitations. So, in terms of getting rid of capital ships, the treaty was a success. But overall, both the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and its successor, the London Naval Treaty of 1930, were failures, inasmuch as, as a practical matter, they encouraged conversion of capital ships to aircraft carriers, which would be the main naval weapons of the next war. Moreover, more generally, they limited weapons only in countries that intended to abide by the treaty, not in those that either did not sign the treaty or else intended to break it. As an added complication, the Japanese were outraged that the treaty limited them to what they believed was a position of inferiority to Britain and the United States. That the United States required a two-ocean navy and Britain a three-ocean navy, whereas Japan needed only a one-ocean navy and could thus maintain superiority in the Pacific, mattered little to the Japanese. In Japan, the treaty was a national outrage, another loss of face, and it was a key factor in the rising nationalism of the Japanese military establishment.\n\nJapan would have other concerns in the immediate aftermath of the Washington Treaty, specifically the devastating 1923 Tokyo Earthquake. The enormous outpouring of support from the United States that followed this event helped reverse the downward trend in US-Japanese relations. However all that improvement was undone the following year by immigration legislation in the US that severely restricted Japanese immigration to the United States. The Japanese found the measure profoundly offensive and racist. The effect on US-Japanese relations was disastrous, and the slow-but-steady deterioration resumed.\n\nThat deterioration would provide the Japanese with yet more motivation to modernize their navy and think creatively in ways that would be detrimental to the long-term security interests of the Western powers. For example, the Imperial Japanese Navy refused to abandon its long-held idea of the decisive battle like Tsushima. But with the Washington Treaty ostensibly forcing Japan into a set disadvantage against its likely rivals in such a battle, Japanese naval strategists looked for ways to gain a decisive edge.\n\nConsidering that, at least in the days before radar, darkness could hide its inferior numbers, the Combined Fleet trained relentlessly (and often ruthlessly) in night combat. It perfected high-quality optics for night spotting and developed illumination rounds, flares, and float lights that were more reliable and burned more brightly than their American counterparts.⁸ It worked tirelessly on developing better torpedoes. It designed and, in 1928, launched the Fubuki class of destroyers, which featured enclosed dual 5in mounts, a steel bridge structure, a top speed of 38 knots, covered torpedo mounts, and one set of torpedo reloads; these were considered revolutionary developments.⁹ Finally, the Imperial Japanese Navy’s Naval Air Force became the world leader in naval aviation, both in its pursuit of carrier aviation – the aircraft carriers Akagi and Kaga, which would take part in the attack on Pearl Harbor, both came online during this period, converted from capital ship hulls due for scrapping under the 1922 treaty – and in its development of seaplanes and seaplane tactics.\n\nThe Washington Naval Treaty was arguably Japan’s last attempt at outwardly restraining its expansionist ambitions in the name of peace. As the treaty was concluded, Emperor Taisho’s health began forcing him to withdraw from power and ultimately left him bedridden. His son, Crown Prince Hirohito, groomed by Meiji to be the next great emperor of Japan, became regent on November 29, 1921. Young Hirohito gained experience at the levers of power as Taisho’s health continued to deteriorate. Finally, on December 25, 1926, Taisho died, and the Crown Prince became Emperor of Japan.\n\nUpon Taisho’s death, the new era of Showa (enlightened peace) was proclaimed. The name Showa would turn out to be ironic, for Hirohito would start two wars in the course of his reign.¹⁰\n\nAnd those wars were not long in coming. As before, China was the first target. Since the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, China had lacked an effective central government. For all intents and purposes, the country was ruled by hundreds of warlords, each with their own little fiefdom.¹¹ Chiang Kai-shek, the recognized leader of China, was less a president than the most powerful of the warlords, less a Napoleon than an Agamemnon. In 1928, the same year that Hirohito was formally enthroned or confirmed as Emperor Showa, the second-most powerful Chinese warlord, Chang Tso-lin, was killed by a bomb planted by members of the Kwantung Army, the Japanese unit protecting the Japanese-held railway in Manchuria.¹² Soon, the Kwantung Army, full of fanatical officers pushing for Japanese militarism and expansionism, would become synonymous with intrigue and trouble. Many believe that their activities were conducted on secret orders of Hirohito and his closest advisors, but often without the permission or even the knowledge of Japan’s civilian government.¹³\n\nIn 1931, Japan took another step towards war. The Kwantung Army was looking to expand Japanese holdings in China from the small area around the railway to all of Manchuria. It needed an excuse to invade. On the evening of September 18, an explosion hit the tracks of the railway near Mukden. That the explosion damaged neither the tracks nor the engine was a good tip off as to who had caused it, but the Kwantung Army blamed nearby Chinese troops for what would become known as the Mukden Incident, or, later, the Manchurian Incident. The Kwantung Army moved up the Liaotung Peninsula to take Mukden itself, and then expanded outward, including making a gratuitous strike at Shanghai, the center of Western investment in China, to coerce the Western powers to push Chiang for a settlement. After about five months of fighting, Japan had complete control over Manchuria.\n\nMeanwhile, the advancement of the Showa agenda continued apace. Tokyo had been a signatory to the London Naval Treaty of 1930, a follow-on to the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, but while the United States and Great Britain had complied with both the Washington and London treaties – much to their detriment in the subsequent Pacific War – the Japanese now had no intention of abiding by the London Treaty’s terms. For instance, under the new treaty, cruisers were again limited to a maximum tonnage of 10,000. The cruiser Mogami, first in its class, was completed in 1935, loaded with armor, torpedo tubes, and five 6in triple turrets. The declared weight was 8,500 tons, though the true design weight was 9,500 and at trials it would displace 11,169 tons. Foreign naval observers saw the Mogami and were suspicious, but could not prove anything.¹⁴ What they could not have even suspected was that the turret base rings for the cruiser were designed so that the 6in triple turrets could be easily replaced with 8in dual turrets, as would be done on the eve of the war.¹⁵ Those 6in triple turrets ended up as secondary armament for another violation of the London Treaty, the gigantic superbattleship Yamato. As is often the case, an arms control treaty had proven to be utterly useless.\n\nThe advancement of Japanese naval aviation continued simultaneously. Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, who would lead the Combined Fleet during the attack on Pearl Harbor, had convinced Hirohito of the utility of attack aircraft launched from aircraft carriers. Yamamoto trained carrier pilots relentlessly to fly and fight in all kinds of weather. The accident rate and the accompanying fatality rate were high, but all this training honed the Japanese Naval Air Force into the best naval aviation force in the world – long before it entered combat.\n\nIt was during this period that the Imperial Japanese Navy developed what was arguably the crown jewel and definitely the most dangerous weapon of its surface fleet – the Type 93 torpedo. By far the finest torpedo of its time, the Type 93 had a diameter of 24in and was unusually long at 29ft, 6in. It carried an explosive charge of 1,080lb, the largest of its kind. But what made the Type 93 so special was its range. At its high-speed setting of 48 knots, it had a range of 20,000m – more than 12 miles. At its slowest speed setting of 36 knots, it could go an incredible 40,000m – more than 24 miles. By comparison, the US Navy’s Mark 15 torpedo, used by destroyers, had a maximum range of 5,500m (just over 3 miles) at its high-speed setting of 45 knots and a range of 13,700m (less than 9 miles) at 26 knots – a speed so slow that it could be outrun by Japanese warships. On top of that, the Mark 15 was powered by steam, which left a trail of bubbles that was easily spotted. The Type 93 was powered by oxygen, which left no bubbles and little visible wake. The Japanese went to great lengths to conceal the Type 93; its devastating power would be a rude shock to the US and Royal Navies in the Pacific.¹⁶ Much later, the torpedo’s extreme effectiveness and unusual length earned from noted historian Samuel Eliot Morison the title by which the Type 93 would become famous – Long Lance.\n\nAs the advances in Japanese naval technology continued, the descent of Japan’s political system into militarism, expansionism, and extreme nationalism continued apace. A provision of the Meiji Constitution by which the ministers representing the army and the navy had to be members of those services became the leverage for the army gradually to take control of the government. Paradoxically, the military dominance of the government came about at a time when the military itself was dominated not by its senior generals but by a cadre of younger, junior officers, many of whom had surreptitious connections to the emperor and the royal family, who were now pushing the government and their senior officers into more and more extreme positions.¹⁷ With their strings allegedly being pulled by the Imperial Palace, these officers would become involved in assassination and murder.\n\nOn November 14, 1930, Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi, who had championed acceptance of the London Treaty and who had rammed through cuts to the navy budget, was wounded by an assassin; Hirohito himself later pardoned the assassin. On May 15, 1932, as part of a larger revolt that became known as the May 15 Incident, a group of young navy officers, supported by army cadets and civilians, attempted a coup that resulted in the death of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, who had demanded cuts to the military budget. The trial of the conspirators descended into a circus. The conspirators proclaimed their loyalty to the emperor while the courts received a petition containing some 350,000 signatures – and some 110,000 letters written in blood – pleading for leniency. Nine youths in Niigata pleaded to be allowed to be executed in place of the accused; to show their good faith, they each sent a severed finger. Unsurprisingly the conspirators received very light sentences.¹⁸\n\nAnd so began the pattern later called government by assassination as civilian control of the military was effectively at an end. Opponents of the position of the emperor, including members of the cabinet, the army, and the navy, had an unfortunate habit of ending up dead. Meanwhile rival factions within the military developed ambitious plans of attack and conquest. A faction of mostly army officers, known as the Strike North faction, wanted to attack what they considered the true enemy of Japan, the Soviet Union. But Emperor Hirohito had been intent since the 1920s on striking south, where British-ruled Malaya and northwest Borneo, and the Netherlands East Indies (which the Japanese called the Southern Resources Area,) could provide the oil, rubber, tin, and arable land that Japan needed for self sufficiency.\n\nOn February 26, 1936, another failed coup made an attempt on the life of yet another prime minister, Okada Keisuke. The coup, called the February 26 Incident, was easily put down, which, given that the mutiny had in reality been encouraged and instigated by the royal family and the emperor’s closest advisors as a pretext for eliminating the Strike North faction, was not surprising.\n\nBut Hirohito realized that the Strike North faction did indeed have a point: the Soviet Union was a threat. A Japan making its long-awaited advance south could easily find a knife in its back courtesy of the malevolent Marxists north of Manchuria. Such was the impetus for Japan entering the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Now, if the Soviets attacked the Japanese in the north, they would have to watch their own backs from their western border.\n\nWith that matter settled, Hirohito proceeded with what had been his plan all along: to conquer China and move south along the coast all the way to Malaya and the East Indies. The phrase hakko ichiu – bringing the eight corners of the world under one roof – now became prominent in imperial propaganda. The phrase has been attributed to the mythical emperor Jimmu enthroned in c. 660 BC, but it had been a part of Japanese foreign policy ever since Meiji, with the aim of bringing all of East Asia under Japanese control. The military buildup now took place openly. Japan had renounced the Washington Naval Treaty in 1934, had withdrawn from the Second London Naval Disarmament Conference begun in December 1935, and was not a signatory to the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.\n\nThe Kwantung Army, always with support from the imperial family, continued to nibble away at northeast China, bringing the Rising Sun to the outskirts of the ancient capital of China, Peking (now called Beijing). On July 7, 1937, elements of the Kwantung Army were on night maneuvers near Tientsin on the opposite side of the Marco Polo Bridge over the Hun River from Chinese forces, when gunfire erupted. Precisely what happened still is not clear. But Tokyo used this so-called Marco Polo Bridge Incident to leverage a full-scale invasion of China. The Japanese were very careful never to publicly acknowledge that what was happening in China was actually a war, preferring to maintain the pretence of this being yet another incident such as had been occurring regularly since 1931.¹⁹\n\nThe emperor had been told by his army advisors that within a month Nanking (Nanjing), the Nationalist capital, would be conquered, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to surrender, reduced to, at best, a puppet ruler. So Hirohito authorized the deployment of the bulk of the army to mainland China. Peking was rapidly occupied. A large amphibious landing was staged in the area of Shanghai to quickly take China’s largest city and port. But the Japanese had not anticipated that Chiang, dependent on the political support of Shanghai and counting on Western intervention, would send his best troops – troops trained by the Germans – into the city to contest the Japanese advance inch by inch. Three months later, when by Japanese projections China itself was to have fallen, they had yet to clear Shanghai.\n\nHowever, with only limited Western support and after suffering massive losses among his best troops, Chiang’s army was forced to retreat towards Nanking, some 70 miles to the west along the Yangtze River. Japanese troops, infuriated by their unexpectedly heavy losses in and around Shanghai, gave chase. In a pattern that would continue in the Pacific War, orders were sent out that the protocols governing the treatment of prisoners of war were not to be observed with Chinese troops.\n\nThe Japanese assumption that once they captured Nanking Chiang would surrender proved a catastrophic miscalculation. With his troops unable to defend his capital, Chiang evacuated his government and his remaining troops westward along the Yangtze, some 800,000 of Nanking’s more than one million residents joining in this headlong flight.²⁰ The Imperial Japanese Army called on the navy to interdict this retreat from the air. One such raid, on December 12, 1937, was directed at fleeing transports moving west upriver from Nanking. A flight of navy bombers under Lieutenant Okumiya Masatake attacked and sank what the army had told them was a Chinese transport, but was actually the US Navy gunboat Panay. Understandably outraged, the United States now had grounds for war with Japan, a war neither country wanted or needed at that point in time. As a result the United States had to accept Tokyo’s apology and some monetary compensation.²¹\n\nBut the massive flight of refugees from the doomed Chinese capital would prove entirely justified. The Japanese, the Chinese government would later charge, killed 390,000 in their advance on Nanking.²² On December 13, 1937, units of the Imperial Japanese Army, led by a division under the command of a notorious sadist named Nakajima Kesago, entered Nanking.²³ No one – at least no one outside the Japanese military establishment – could have predicted what happened next.\n\nAfter earning a reputation for civility in wartime conduct ever since the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the behavior of the Imperial Japanese Army upon its occupation of Nanking reached the lowest depths of the worst, most depraved, most barbaric conduct of the 20th century. It would become known as the Rape of Nanking, which indeed it was. Some 20,000 women were raped, most repeatedly, many in front of husbands, fathers, or children who were murdered when they attempted to intervene.²⁴ Iris Chang, the prominent scholar on the Rape of Nanking, would comment that using numbers killed alone, the Rape of Nanking surpasses much of the worst barbarism of the ages, including the Roman destruction of Carthage and Tamerlane’s sacks of New Delhi and Syria.²⁵ By some accounts, the massacre continued for six weeks, leaving some 260,000 dead, more than a third of the city in charred ruins, and everything of value shipped off to Japan.²⁶ The conduct of the troops was so ghastly that even local observers from Nazi Germany were horrified – calling the Imperial Japanese Army bestial machinery – and tried to take measures (that were ultimately ineffectual) to try to protect some of the Chinese population.²⁷\n\nWorld opinion increasingly turned against Japan as a result of the Rape of Nanking. Worse, Chiang Kai-shek refused to surrender, merely retreating to Chunking (Chonqing), far inland in the mountains of the upper Yangtze. Chinese public opinion hardened still more against their uninvited Japanese guests. Chinese in Japanese-occupied areas boycotted Japanese products, further fueling Japanese anger. So the terror continued, but Chiang refused to come out for decisive battle. When the Japanese struck, Chiang simply moved his army somewhere else. Tokyo kept committing more and more troops and materiel to the China Incident, but no end was in sight. It was the proverbial quagmire; Japan had committed 1.5 million troops to China and suffered 600,000 casualties.²⁸ Yet Japan could not seem to win the war, nor could it pull out without losing face and ending its self-styled leadership of the Asian peoples and the imperial policy of hakko ichiu entirely, which was inconceivable.\n\nOn December 22, 1938, Japan’s prime minister, Prince Konoye Fuminaro, gave a speech in which he proclaimed a New Order in East Asia with the Japanese united in a struggle to help the people of Asia – under Japanese leadership, of course – drive out the Western imperialists.²⁹ Two years later, Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke would turn the New Order into the infamous Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The rallying cry became Asia for the Asians. The critical caveat, So long as those Asians are Japanese, somehow did not become a part of imperial propaganda.\n\nWhile the Soviet Union had been supplying Chinese communists with weapons during the course of the Chinese Civil War, the piecemeal support that the West had offered to Chinese Nationalist forces increased, motivated by growing international sympathy for the Chinese and rising anger at Japan’s brutality. Japan countered by taking control of Chinese ports of entry for this material support, such as Canton (Guangzhou), Tsingtao, Fainan, and the Spratly Islands; and cutting off the British colony of Hong Kong and the Portuguese colony of Macau. The Western countries responded by going through British-ruled Burma and French Indochina. Claire Lee Chennault, a former US Army officer now serving as an air advisor for Chiang, would coordinate some air support from the United States and would, eventually, lead American volunteers in a squadron of Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters, famously emblazoned with shark mouths on their engine cowlings, to help the overmatched Chinese Air Force. But soon enough, Chennault’s pilots would be just as overmatched as the Chinese they were helping, as the Japanese unleashed what became one of their most fearsome weapons of the war.\n\nOn June 29, 1940, a dozen new, rather strange-looking monoplane aircraft appeared at the airfield at Yokosuka Naval Air Station, some 70 miles south of Tokyo. Lieutenant Shimokawa Manbei briefed the 12 pilots before him on this new aircraft. Called the shi experimental carrier fighter, the plane was still in the test stage without a pilot’s manual or anything else that explained how to handle it. Nevertheless, it was to be made operational as quickly as possible.³⁰\n\nAny troubling thoughts the pilots may have had as to Japanese procurement practices were lost when they actually tested the fighter. It was a dream to fly. It had a top speed of 330 miles per hour; an incredible rate of climb; unheard-of maneuverability; powerful 20mm cannons in the wings and two backup 7.7mm machine guns in the nose. It also had no armored cockpit – very little armor at all, in fact – and no self-sealing fuel tanks. But pilot protection had never been a concern for the Japanese.³¹\n\nAnd so the new carrier fighter was made ready. Its official name became the Mitsubishi A6M Type 00 (Reisen) Carrier Fighter, Model 11. In designating the aircraft in reports, the Allies would eventually dispense with the confusing Japanese naming system and instead use people’s names – females for bombers (Nell, Betty, etc.), males for fighters (Claude, Oscar, etc.). This fighter would ultimately have an official Allied reporting name of Zeke, but few actually used that. Mitsubishi’s Type 00 designation gave the new fighter the name by which it would become famous across the globe: the Zero.³²\n\nThe Zero literally chased Chiang Kai-shek’s already overmatched air force out of the skies over China. On one occasion, September 13, 1940, the Zeros feigned retreat and doubled back, surprising the 27 Chinese fighters who had returned. The result was 27 Chinese fighters – the entire Chinese force – shot down; for no Japanese losses in return.³³ Okumiya Masatake would later admit that with all of Japan’s early success in the Pacific War, we could not possibly have achieved our sea, land, and air victories with a fighter plane of lesser performance than the Zero. Our entire strategy depended on the success of this aircraft.³⁴ Chennault observed the Zero’s performance with awe. He had never seen, had never even heard of anything like it. He dutifully sent reports of his observations about the Zero’s performance to Washington and London; his reports were deemed not credible and ignored.\n\nBut even the Zero could not tip the war in China decisively in Japan’s favor. Japan had already conquered everything worth conquering in China – its ports, its industrial areas, the majority of its arable land, most of its navigable rivers. It meant nothing. Chiang would not surrender, could not be made to surrender. The China Incident kept eating more and more resources – $5 million a day, a staggering sum for that time – while the continuing Japanese atrocities were alienating the very countries on whom Japan depended for import of those resources, such as the United States. Only 10 percent of the oil Japan used was produced in the home islands. Another 10 percent came from the Netherlands East Indies. The remainder, 80 percent, came from the United States. And that flow of oil was in danger of being cut off. In 1939, the United States announced it was withdrawing from a 1911 trade agreement with Japan. In July 1940, the United States prohibited export of high-grade aviation fuel and steel scrap to Japan, crippling Japan’s steel industry.³⁵ It was not so much that the Americans were tired of seeing their exports to Japan being turned against the Chinese, although they were, but that they strongly suspected that their exports to Japan were about to be turned back on themselves.\n\nThus, the deterioration of relations between Japan and the West continued as World War II in Europe began. In June 1940, a month after President Roosevelt had moved the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, the US Congress authorized the Two-Ocean Navy Act, providing for a massive expansion of the US Navy. In a few years, the US Navy would achieve quantitative superiority to the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Pacific, and any chance of the Japanese assembling the East Asian hegemony that had been the goal of Meiji and now Hirohito – hakko ichiu – would be gone unless immediate action was taken.³⁶ Tokyo did its calculations. Based on the Two-Ocean Navy Act and Japan’s own naval expansion, Japan’s naval strength relative to the US would peak in late 1941.³⁷\n\nThe next downgrade in relations came when Japan became a signatory with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to the Tripartite Pact on September 27, 1940. Theoretically, the pact was a supplement to the earlier Anti-Comintern Pact directed at the Soviet Union, but the purpose of this supplement was different – to discourage the United States from entering the war in Europe or from taking up arms against Japan, or, as Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka put it, to prevent the United States from encircling us.³⁸\n\nIn many respects things were falling into place much better than Emperor Hirohito could have hoped. The Wehrmacht’s success in Europe would be Japan’s opportunity. With France under Hitler’s rule, Indochina was ready to fall into Japanese hands. Britain could barely defend itself against Hitler, so how could it defend Singapore, Malaya, and Burma? The Dutch government had fled the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and set itself up in London as a government-in-exile, but it could do little to support the defense of the East Indies. And the Imperial Japanese Navy had the quantitative advantage over the US Pacific Fleet and the British and Dutch naval forces in the Pacific combined. A policy paper from the Imperial Japanese Army declared, Never in our history has there been a time like the present, while a former army minister said that Japan must seize this golden opportunity! Don’t let anything stand in the way!³⁹ The naval general staff had been planning this operation for a long time and now Admiral Yamamoto, although an opponent of the war, fine-tuned those plans. In summer 1940, after the fall of France, Hirohito had approved the move to Strike South. After a series of clashes with Red Army troops in Mongolia in 1939, Japan reached a peace agreement with the Soviet Union in fall of 1940, thereby securing its northern flank and cutting off the flow of Russian weapons to China. Slowly, quietly, personnel reserves were called up and the chess pieces were moved into place.\n\nTokyo requested that Vichy France invite Japanese troops into the northern part of Indochina. Some initial reluctance on the Vichy government’s part was easily quelled by Nazi Germany. Japanese troops quickly occupied Hanoi. Privately Hirohito would call his Indochina policy looting a store during a fire.⁴⁰ Its action brought protest, but not much else. The Allies rationalized that Japan was simply trying to cut Chiang’s supply line through Indochina and did not suspect that a full-scale invasion of their Far East interests was in the offing. However, in July 1941, again at the invitation of Vichy France, Japan occupied Saigon with the 22nd Air Flotilla, part of Japan’s 11th Air Fleet established at the Saigon air complex.\n\nThe Japanese now effectively surrounded the Philippines, with Saigon to the west; Formosa, where the 21st and 23rd Air Flotillas, also of the 11th Air Fleet, were based, to the north; and the Marshall Islands to the east. Saigon was in range of British Malaya and all-important Singapore, as well as northwest Borneo, which could serve as a gateway into the East Indies. Their intention was clear. The response from Washington was outrage – and, on August 1, 1941, Japanese assets were frozen and a total trade embargo on Japan put in place. The British and the Dutch quickly followed suit.\n\nEmperor Hirohito and his advisors apparently had not anticipated such a strong response from the United States and its allies to the occupation of Saigon. The trade embargo meant that Japan would have to make do with only 10 percent of its normal oil supplies. Although there had been some buildup of Japanese domestic oil reserves in preparation for this day, it had not proceeded as quickly as they had hoped. By the most optimistic projections, without the United States, Japan had only enough oil for approximately one year of war.⁴¹\n\nJapan and the United States were now at an impasse. Washington would not lift the trade embargo until Japan had withdrawn from both Indochina and China. Japan would not withdraw from China; in the eyes of Emperor Hirohito and his advisors, to do so would mean a loss of face, the end of hakko ichiu and Japanese ambitions in East Asia, and Japan’s reduction to a second-rate power. On this, the army and the navy, who generally despised each other, agreed. General Tojo Hideki, who became prime minister in October 1941, predicted, America may be enraged for a while, but later she will come to understand [why we did what we did.] To Tojo, like most of the other senior Japanese leaders, risking war with the United States was better than being ground down without doing anything.⁴²\n\nSo the long-term plan of Emperor Hirohito and of the Japanese military, to seize the resources of Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies, was now a national imperative. Becoming self-sufficient through the seizure of Southeast Asia was now more than philosophical; it was essential for national survival. Now Japan would finally drive the Europeans and the Americans out of East Asia.⁴³\n\nThat said, while the oil fields of Borneo, Sumatra, and Java were Japan’s primary objective, there was some disagreement as to how its forces would get there. The major issue was the Philippines. The Japanese did not really need the archipelago during this phase, but their advance to the so-called Southern Resources Area would be threatened by the US forces centered on the Clark airbase complex north of Manila and the Cavite Navy Yard on Manila Bay, pointing like a dagger at the Japanese supply lines back to the home islands. Even if the United States remained neutral, their presence was still a major danger. Only by seizing control of the Philippines could Japan eliminate that threat. But, as Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku of the navy’s Combined Fleet successfully argued, that danger would be eliminated only at the expense of adding a bigger one – a sortie of the US Pacific Fleet out of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to relieve the US forces in the Philippines. So the concept of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was born, out of the mind of Yamamoto Isoroku, who had lived in the United States, understood it, even liked it. Better than anyone around Emperor Hirohito and his political circle, Yamamoto knew what going to war with the United States would most likely mean – a catastrophic defeat for Japan.⁴⁴ As Yamamoto had famously told Prime Minister Konoye in August 1940, In the first six to twelve months of war with the United States and Great Britain I will run wild and win victory upon victory. But then, if the war continues after that, I have no expectation of success.⁴⁵\n\nWhile the Japanese would have the advantage in the short term, they knew they could not match America’s industrial and military might in the long term. What they were hoping for was a continuing manifestation of the American political weakness and isolationism that had kept it out of the war so far. Admiral Yamamoto’s projection of six months was key. The Japanese hoped they could build up their East Asian empire during that timeframe – adding the Philippines, Malaya, the East Indies, Thailand (already an ally), and Burma, and building up a defensive web of islands including Guam and the Marianas, the Carolines, the Marshalls, the Gilberts, Wake, and New Guinea.⁴⁶ By the time the United States was mobilized, Japan hoped its new defensive network would make the American public question whether retaking far-away East Asia was worth the cost in lives and in materiel, opening the door to a political settlement that could allow Japan to keep its territorial gains. Yet that strategy relied on doing nothing to so outrage the American people that they would refuse to listen to any settlement short of an unconditional surrender.\n\nAnd so plans that Admiral Yamamoto and the Japanese had developed were put into motion. Slowly, quietly, in ones and twos, the aircraft carriers whose names would become infamous – Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, Soryu, Shokaku, Zuikaku – made their way to a rendezvous in a remote, isolated bay on Etorofu in the Kurile Islands north of Hokkaido variously called Hitokappu or Tankan Bay. The carriers, officially called the 1st Air Fleet, would be joined by a sizable escorting force: Hiei and Kirishima, two fast battleships that had been converted from battlecruisers; Tone and Chikuma, two bizarre-looking heavy cruisers capable of carrying an increased number of seaplanes; and the light cruiser Abukuma, leading a squadron of eight destroyers. Referred to as the Japanese Carrier Striking Force in US Navy circles, it was and is more commonly known by the informal name of Kido Butai – Striking Force.\n\nOn November 26, Kido Butai departed Hitokappu Bay for its date with Pearl Harbor and history. Less well known are the other elements of the Japanese plan, or, as US military analysts would later call it, the Centrifugal Offensive: simultaneous strikes designed to leave the Americans, British, Australians, and Dutch completely off-balance, all peripheral objectives but necessary to achieve Japan’s overall strategic goal: final victory in China. The biggest strike, tasked with conquering the all-important Southern Resources Area, would be led by the appropriately named Southern Expeditionary Force.\n\nAs it moved southward, the Southern Expeditionary Force and its component parts would have a bewildering series of temporary titles, titles like Malaya Force, Kuching Force, Davao Force, Invasion Force, Escort Force, Support Force, Distant Support Force, all of which would change depending on the objectives. This in itself was typical of Imperial Japanese Navy doctrine. It could not put a force of ships together and just send it towards the objective; it always had to divide it up into parts.⁴⁷"
