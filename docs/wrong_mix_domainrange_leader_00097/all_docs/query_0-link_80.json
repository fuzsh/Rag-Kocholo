        "text": "This book is dedicated to:\n\nMy mom and dad, wherever they may be. I am sure not everything I do pleases them, but I hope I am at least amusing them.\n\nMy stepmum, Bri, who was dad’s loving companion after mum died, and the Australian family that loves them both.\n\nMy fellow dragon and brother, Richard. He has always been the hardworking one in the family. I’ll always be his kid brother. He will always be, ‘Kor’.\n\nMy sis in Christ, Winnie. She has been at times a mother figure (from personality and not from age), at other times, a confidant, from whom God often reveals his ways.\n\nTheir two children, Oliver and Adeline, and one hopes one has been a halfway decent uncle to them.\n\nMy oldest friend Donald, friends since kindergarten (I shit you not), brought back together after a hiatus by the power of social media. He, like my brother, was coerced into reading an early draft of this book. And they actually liked it.\n\nTo all those who touched my life over the past half century; friends, family, teachers, mentors, colleagues, lovers, enemies. Part of what I am is because of you. Thank you. Don’t be a stranger. Except the enemies.\n\nAnd last but not least, you the reader. Especially if you actually bought this book. If you didn’t buy it, it’s never too late.\n\nWhy April?\n\nApril is a very interesting month. In fact, I’d say it’s as least as interesting as the other eleven, perhaps more so. An awful lot of history happened in April. Possibly even more than one twelfth of it. There’s also a lot of history that has been just plain wrong, and so much that people have forgotten and shouldn’t. So ... here’s my take on kinda the history of the world as seen through the month of April. And no, this is not an April Fool’s Day joke and have you filed your taxes yet?\n\nBut why April, I hear you ask. Why not June, or August? Well, it’s personal. I was born in April. As a result, I kinda noticed more things about April than I would other months. I long knew that Hitler was born in April – just a few days from my own birthday as a matter of fact. I was staggered to discover that all three founders of the three German empires were born in April (Angela Merkel isn’t; but Helmut Kohl is … see April 3, 1930). The sinking of the Titanic also took place in April. As did the start and end of the American Civil War and the assassination of Lincoln. I pretty much needed one more serendipitous encounter with an April event, and that happened when I was invited to the Queen’s birthday celebration, which is on ... 26th April! That’s it, I decided. I gotta write this book and share the quirky coincidences of April with you!\n\nAnd I reckon there is a history equivalent of Moore’s Law (see April 19, 1965), which in a nutshell states that computing power doubles every 18 months, which has amazingly held true for the past 50 years. Data accumulates at I reckon, close to the same rate. We have much more data on what happened last year than 10 years’ ago, and more again that what happened 100 years’ ago. So there is a bias in this book for events that happened, say, in the last few hundred years; about two thirds of the entries in this book date from the 1800s.\n\nIn addition, while I am for example certain that the Great Wall of China, the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and indeed, all the wonders of the ancient world, as well as the invention of the wheel and first use of fire, were all in April, I cannot prove it. But neither can anyone prove they were not. The current Gregorian calendar (see April 10, 1585 for Pope Gregory XIII) used today in most (far from all; take that, Common Era advocates!) parts of the world, is a fairly recent invention. Only since 1582, and it took a long time for countries to switch over – which is why, for example, the 1917 October Revolution in Russia actually happened in November.\n\nThe calendar it replaces, the Julian calendar, also had an April in it and was introduced a bit earlier; in around 45 BC; the month itself dates back unknown centuries, and is traditionally associated with the arrival of spring in the Northern hemisphere. Which also means, in all of recorded history, we are fairly certain of what happened and when, in only about the last 3,000 years. The further back you go, the more the margin of error.\n\nConversely, the nearer to the present you get, the more you encounter ... me. Like The Outer Limits, I decide what to include and what not to, and hence what you read. Apologies, there is a Western bias (better at record keeping and at PR?). There is also lots of popular culture and technology. Hey, in a world that has known peace for so long (well, more or less since 1945), the action of great kings and the outcome of great battles no longer factor as much as before; it is the actions of great engineers, scientists and well, actors, that matter more. And that’s far from a bad thing.\n\nYou may ask, just where did I get all this stuff? About a third came from Wikipedia. Another third came from today in history and biography websites (thanks Adi, for finding some of these). The remainder came from just a lot of books. I have been reading daily since I was a kid; interested as I put it, in the past, present and future – history, current affairs, and science fiction. You’ll be amazed at what you can pick up in the strangest places. Like learning about the Trent Affair (see April 3, 1798 for Charles Wilkes) in an alternate history novel.\n\nLastly, a word on how the entries are organized. They are arranged chronologically according the date in April I feel is the most significant for that entry; some entries have a few Aprils in them! This date is shown in bold face, as well as other April dates, as is the entry summary, for example, the inventor of the doodad, John Milhous Doe, was born in 2064. Some entries will be cross referenced like so – (see April 31, 2064); and every entry is only one paragraph long, between just 100-125 words, for easy digestion by today’s attention deficient generation.\n\nIt is my hope that you, the reader, might be at least mildly entertained and will come to appreciate history and realize it’s not so much about events in the past, but how those events shape our present; and how our actions today – tomorrow’s history – will shape our future. Let’s shape a good one.\n\nThat’s it, folks. On to strange and wonderful April!\n\nAddendum 2015\n\nWelcome to the new, expanded, updated and improved 2015 version!\n\nAfter publishing this book last year, I discovered a lot of people and events I had missed the first time around. The version you are holding is around 20% more than the first edition. So yes, 1,001 Things You Didn’t Know Happened in April is false advertising. Over 1,600 entries actually, not 1,001. The first edition was already more than you bargained for at about 1,200. But hey, 1,001 is way catchier than 1,688 Things You Didn’t Know Happened in April. BTW, the working title for this book was The April of History. Nah. 1,001 works better. And this tome now weighs in at over 200,000 words!\n\nSo, some of the additions to this … edition, are:\n\nA lot of entertainers of all sorts, especially actors.\n\nSeveral historical figures and events that I missed the first time around.\n\nEvents in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSadly, a whole lot of air crashes. April is not a good month for air travel. About as bad as the other eleven.\n\nUpdates on several entries, formatting changes which I think makes it easier to follow, new linkages between entries.\n\nSpeaking of air disasters, a note on my selection criteria across the board. There are still many air disasters and other events or personalities that I have left out, simply because I could not find enough to make a pithy entry of not less than 100 words. I feel that to do justice to you, dear reader, I feel that to do justice to you, dear reader, I need to keep to no less than 100 and no more than 125. I’m happy to need to be concise; I rather don’t like to stretch a fabric too thin; you will see occasionally that I combine two related events.\n\nThis year, in updating this book, I faced two additional distractions; both are linked to my dear sis in law and in Christ, Winnie. Through her and others, I have been brought closer to God, and have been spending much more time in church activities; time used wisely. Through her as well, thanks to the gift of a tablet, I have been happily reading a lot of digital comics! Time used less wisely, but joyfully as well!\n\nHappy reading!\n\nApril 1\n\nFlavius Julius Valerius Majorianus Augustus became Emperor of the Roman Empire in 457. At the time, the empire amounted to just modern day Italy and parts of France and the Balkans – since Diocletian (see April 30, 311), the empire to the east was under a separate emperor; in the west, a lot had been lost. He was one of the last emperors to try and get the empire back. To do so, he allowed vast numbers of barbarians to join the legions. He decisively defeated various tribes and won back territories in Spain. He also instituted various financial and administrative reforms. All in just four years, before he was deposed and executed in August 461. Rome would fall for good just 15 years’ later.\n\n*\n\nBorn 482, he became associate Emperor of the Byzantine Empire in 527, becoming full emperor four months’ later. Justinian I, also ‘the Great’, tried to win back the lands of the fallen Western Roman Empire, and restore the empire to greatness, coming close to succeeding, essentially all but parts of Spain, France and Germany. As importantly, he codified Roman law, which still forms the basis for the legal system in many countries. Under his long reign, Byzantine culture, arts and learning blossomed, and the beautiful Hagia Sophia was built. The economy was reformed and he filled the treasury. But it was too good to last. The bubonic plague struck, 541-543, stripping him of farmers and soldiers, and the barbarians came back. The Empire would go into decline for the next seven centuries. Justinian died November 565.\n\n*\n\nBorn 1056, Alexios I Komnenos was the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire whose appeals for help kicked off the Crusades. He helped depose the previous emperor and ascended the throne in 1081, but faced 37 years of near constant war. He dealt with barbarians and numerous revolts, but the biggest threat was the Seljug Turks, with whom Byzantine would be at war with for three centuries. Realizing he no longer had the strength to contain them, he turned to the Pope, hoping for mercenaries. Imagine his surprise and fear when an army appeared instead, in 1095. The troubling relationship Byzantine would have with the Crusaders had begun. Alexios did manage to stabilize the ailing empire for the next century and died in August 1118.\n\n*\n\nBorn in May 1048, Emperor Shenzong of China was the sixth in the Song dynasty. He appointed the famed economist of his time, Wang Anshi, and implemented various reforms for the peasants and for the unemployed, considered by some to be the forerunner of the welfare state. He had some success militarily against the rival state of Western Xia (today northwestern China and parts of Mongolia), but never quite crushed them and they would continue to spar with the Song. During his reign, a minister called Sīmǎ Guāng wrote A Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government, an influential work of history. An important military text, the Seven Military Classics, was also completed during his reign. Shenzong died in 1085.\n\n*\n\nOne of the most powerful and wealthy of women in her day, Eleanor of Aquitaine became queen of France by marrying Louis VII, then dumping him for Henry II, becoming queen of England. She took part personally in the Second Crusade, and ruled over England when her son, the famed Richard the Lionheart (see April 6, 1199) went off for the Third. When her oldest son, Henry, rose in revolt against Henry Senior, she was imprisoned for 16 years. When her favorite son Richard died, her youngest son John (see April 6, 1199), became king. Until her death in 1204, she was still involved in the intricate dynastic struggles that marked Europe of this era.\n\n*\n\nBorn in 1145, Aimery (also Almaric) of Lusignan became King of Cyprus 1194 and King of Jerusalem in 1197. He was the older brother of the more flamboyant Guy of Lusignan, and Guy became King of Jerusalem first, promptly leading the crusader army into the disastrous Battle of Hattin in July 1187. Guy then went on to the throne of Cyprus and Aimery took over upon his death. Like Guy, Aimery married well to become King of Jerusalem, and did better as king, holding the peace with the Muslims until his death in 1205, possibly of food poisoning or … poisoned food. Given that two of his sons and his wife also died in 1205, I’m kinda leaning towards dirty politics as the cause of death.\n\n*\n\nAfter the death of Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire broke up into smaller principalities called khanates. One of these was the Ilkhanate, which stretched from Turkey to Pakistan. Born in February 1234, Abaqa Khan became the second il-khan (ruler) in June 1285. His reign was marked by an ongoing civil war against other khanates, in particular the Golden Horde (based in Mongolia and China). He also fought the Mamluk Empire (in Egypt) for control of Syria and even assisted the Christians during the Crusades, culminating in the Second Battle of the Homs in October 1281. Imagine that; 50,000 Mongols and 30,000 Crusaders in battle together against the Mamluks. Unfortunately for the Crusaders, Abaqa died in 1282, and his successor opted to ally with the Mamluks.\n\n*\n\nBorn in 1282, Louis IV was King of the Romans, King of Italy, and Holy Roman Emperor. Although crowned in October 1314, it took until September 1322 for Louis to defeat his rivals and against the pope’s wishes, to become undisputed King of the Romans. Next was the kingship of Italy in May 1327, against the pope, whom he had replaced. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in January 1328. He supported the English against the French under Philip VI (see below, 1328) and against Pope Benedict XII (see April 25, 1342). He protected the Teutonic Knights (see April 10, 1525) and fostered the economies of the cities in his empire. He died suddenly of a stroke in October 1347, just as his enemies were gathering once again.\n\n*\n\nAlthough called Philip the Fortunate, I reckon Philip VI, who became King of France in 1328, was anything but. The other claimant to the throne was Edward II of England, and eventually the two hated each other, and war began in May 1337. This was the start of the Hundred Years’ War that would ravage France. For Philip, the low point may have been the devastating French defeat of the Battle of Crécy, August 1346. Yet to make matters worse, in 1348, the Black Death struck, which would kill one third of the population and plunge the kingdom into financial chaos. By the time of his death in August 1350, France was not exactly in good shape. And he was called, the Fortunate?\n\n*\n\nNo one really knows when the first day of April became known as April Fools’ Day. The first known mention is in The Canterbury Tales (see April 17), making 1397 a good a year as any. The practice of playing a practical joke on this day became fairly common in Europe since the Middle Ages, and became somewhat a regular occurance from the 19th Century. Since at least the 1950s, newspapers and radio and TV stations have been playing tricks on their audiences. Since the 1990s, the Internet has become the hotbed of April trickery. Just take everything you see or hear on 1st April which a huge pinch of skepticism.\n\n*\n\nBorn in 1338, he claimed descent from Sverker II (see April 10 for Eric X, 1216) and in 1363, with the help of Swedish nobles and German troops, defeated incumbent Magnus IV, becoming Albert, King of Sweden in 1364. However, this led to eight years of civil war. Magnus IV obtained help from Denmark and Norway, and Albert was able to hold them off with the help of Swedish nobility. Magnus IV was allowed to leave for Norway and Albert was forced to cede concessions to the nobles. In 1389, he tried to rein in the power of the nobles, who promptly turned to Denmark for help. The Danes defeated Albert in the Battle of Åsle. Deposed and imprisoned, Albert died soon after in 1412.\n\n*\n\nBorn January 1467, he became Sigismund I, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in January 1507. Under the reign of the previous king, his brother, a new law was enacted, preventing the king from coming up with new laws without the consent of the sejm (parliament). Working around this limitation, Sigismund was still able to raise a conscript army, build a bureaucracy, and formalized the system of serfdom. He succeeded in annexing a Polish duchy but lost the city of Smolensk to Moscovite forces. He also ended the war with the Teutonic Knights in 1525 (see April 10), and became Duke of Prussia. Also called Sigismund the Old, he died in 1458.\n\n*\n\nTaking over from Sigismund I (see above) as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1458, was his son, Sigismund II Augustus. Augustus married three times, against the wishes of his sejm (parliament), and had affairs with other women, all to no avail as he produced no heir. Nonetheless, his powers of diplomacy brought the Catholics and Protestants in Poland together, and he succeeded in July 1569, in merging Poland and Lithuania into one union that also included Prussian cities. He died in July 1572. His Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, renowned for its religious tolerance, would remain a force on the European stage until the late 18th Century.\n\n*\n\nThe silver that helped fuel the growth of the Spanish Empire, spark the Renaissance in Europe, and also real pirates of the Carribbean hoping to capture a ship or two, came mostly from the mines of Potosí in today’s Bolivia. By the time the mines were played out, 41,000 tons of silver had been extracted. The city of Potosí was founded in 1545. In its heyday, it was considered one of the richest cities in the world, and the largest in the Americas, and is mentioned in de Cervantes’ (see April 22, 1616) Don Quixote as a land of extraordinary riches. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, the city of a quarter million still mines for silver.\n\n*\n\nHey, so that’s how blood works. William Harvey was born in 1578. Graduating as a doctor from the University of Padua on 25th April 1602, he was quite a successful one, becoming the physician for no less than King James I of England (see April 6) as well as King Charles I. In 1628, he wrote a book, De Motu Cordis, or On the Motion of the Heart and Blood, and was the first to fully explain how blood circulates within the body and the role of the heart as a pump. What a shocking concept at the time. From this simple beginning, the healthcare system and the medical science we rely on today would be based. He died in June 1657.\n\n*\n\nIn 1748, a Spanish military engineer stumbled upon the ruins of a town near the city of Naples. He had rediscovered the lost ruins of Pompeii. For centuries Pompeii, a bustling Roman town of some 20,000, had been buried and forgotten. In 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius blew up and buried Pompeii, in four to six metres of ash. As more of the ruins were excavated, more surprises were in store. Eventually, a nearly intact municipality, preserved by the ash down to the raunchy frescoes, emerged, providing us a unique view in to the past. Today a UNESCO World Heritage Site, some 2.5 million tourists go to gawk every year at the splendor that was once ancient Rome.\n\n*\n\nBorn in 1776, the chaos of the French Revolution forced her to stay indoors, where Marie-Sophie Germain developed a passion for math. Math not being a proper field of study at the time for a lady, Germain was never formally schooled, but through brilliance, hard work, and correspondence with other mathematicians of the day, she made advances in elasticity theory, number theory and differential geometry. Her greatest contribution is considered her work on Fermat’s Last Theorem. She died June 1831. Six years’ later, the University of Göttingen honored her work by conferring upon her a degree. In 1876, the Paris Academy of Sciences established a prize in her honor.\n\n*\n\nIn 1792, the second deadliest volcanic eruption in history occurred, second only to Tambora (see April 5, 1815). Mount Unzen in Nagasaki, Japan, blew up. About a month after lava stopped erupting from the volcano, part of the dome collapsed, creating a landslide that swept through nearby Shimabara City and into the sea, creating in turn a tsunami. The death toll from the landslide and tsunami is estimated at more than 15,000. The mountain range remains Japan’s more active volcano region; between 1991 and 1994, Unzen generated over 10,000 small lava flows. Another eruption in June 1991 killed 43. Unzen is one of 16 Decade Volcanoes, recognized for their high activity.\n\n*\n\nHe said that the issues of the day would be decided by iron and blood. Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, born 1815, in large part due to his adroit diplomacy and military leadership (along with Helmut von Moltke the Elder, see April 24, 1891), unified the numerous German states into a German Empire in January 1871. In the process, he also built the world’s first welfare state, and set Germany on the road to greatness. This would be the second reich (1871-1918), with the Holy Roman Empire (962-1806) considered the first reich. The Third Reich (1933-1945), of course, is the most infamous. In his waning years, regrettably the new Kaiser, Wilhelm II, chose to overturn Bismarck’s careful policies and set Germany on the path that would lead to the First World War.\n\n*\n\nSimon Bolivar Buckner was born in 1823. He served honorably during the Mexican American War (1846-1848), then in federal and militia postings until the American Civil War. He twice refused a generalship in the Union army, and joined the Confederates instead to defend his native Kentucky. He served honorably again, rising to the rank of lieutenant general. A respected figure, after the war he became Governor of Kentucky (1887-1891) and was nominated by his party for the US vice presidency. He died in January 1914. His legacy continued with his son, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., who also rose to become a lieutenant general. Killed at Okinawa (see below, 1945), he was the highest ranking US soldier to be killed in the Second World War.\n\n*\n\nOne of the key inventions of the modern world was patented in 1826. The internal combustion engine. You know, that noisy, usually either gas or diesel guzzling thingie usually found in the front of your car, and also widely used in industry, on ships, and still on many aircraft. The inventor was Samuel Morey, born October 1762. In his early days he invented various components to improve the steamboat. The engine that Sam built had two cylinders, a carburetor and valves and cams a mechanic would recognize today. Morey also developed various components we still use, 20 patents in all. Unfortunately for Morey, no one was interested. Morey died relatively unknown, and also in April; on the 17th, in 1843.\n\n*\n\nBorn August 1782, Vicente Ramón Guerrero Saldaña fought in the Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821), and rose rapidly, becoming effectively the second banana. He fell out with the leadership of the new nation, becoming President of Mexico in 1829. He pushed for support for the poor, public schools, land reform, economic development, defeated a Spanish invasion in July, and abolished slavery in September. A busy few months; he was himself deposed in a rebellion by his vice president, captured and executed December 1829. Loyalists later deposed his vice president in turn! The state of Guerrero was named in his honor and he remains a national hero in Mexico.\n\n*\n\nValentín Gómez Farías played tag with Santa Anna (see April 20, 1853), swapping the role of President of Mexico with him five times, his first term starting in 1833. Born February 1781, he was the real prez most of the time as Santa Anna was busy losing wars. Farías, well aware of the power of the Church and especially the military, worked hard to reduce the privileges of both. On the Church, he secularized education, abolished mandatory tithing and seized Church property. As for the military, he reduced its size and made its members accountable to civilian law. He finally went too far and Santa Anna removed him in May 1847. He died July 1858.\n\n*\n\nMongkut or Rama IV, took over from his half brother Rama III (see April 2, 1851) as King of Siam in 1851. Among the most revered of kings among his people, to the world he is the king in the movie and play, The King and I. He spent 27 years as a Buddhist monk to avoid palace intrigues, along the way he instituted religious reforms and learned about Western sciences. As a result, when he became king, he was kinda Thailand’s Emperor Meiji – recognizing the threat posed by the West, he introduced a wide range of modernizing reforms, in science as well as societal. The Bowring Treaty (18th April 1855) with the United Kingdom opened up the economy. Mongkut died in October 1868.\n\n*\n\nAt the start of the Reform War in Mexico (1857-1861), the rebels in the Mexican state of Sonora invited a wealthy American ex-Senator, Henry A. Crabb, to settle in the state. This Crabb Expedition numbered about 100. The rebels then decided they no longer needed American help and on this day, an eight day running battle ensued in which 25 were killed, and possibly 200 Mexicans. Another 58 that were captured were executed, including Crabb. This, the Crabb Massacre, did not end there; in subsequent border incursions, another 20 Americans were executed. Why this did not result in a return to hostilities (the Mexican American War was from 1846 to 1848), I have no idea.\n\n*\n\nThe Battle of Five Forks in 1865 was the last major battle of the American Civil War. Called the Waterloo of the Confederate Army, prior to the battle, the South was already under siege at Petersburg and its capital, Richmond. The battle at Five Forks was not bloody by civil war standards; less than 4,000 dead and wounded on both sides, but it cut the last railway supplying the Confederate army, forcing Confederate commander Robert E. Lee to give up his position at Petersburg. Two days’ later, Union forces captured both cities. On the run, Lee had no option but to surrender (see April 8 for Appomattox).\n\n*\n\nIn 1867, Singapore became a British crown colony. Up until that time, Singapore was part of one of the largest commercial concerns in history, the British East India Company. Singapore, along with Britain’s other possessions in Asia, was ruled from Calcutta, India. Eventually the British government seized control of the EIC and Singapore, along with territories such as Penang and Malacca, would now be ruled directly by the Colonial Office. On the same day in 1946, the Malayan Union was formed, a step forward for independence for the British colonies of Malaya and Singapore. On 11th April 1956, the British agreed to self government for Singapore, paving the way for Marshall (see April 6, 1955), then Lee Kuan Yew (see April 2, 1955), to run the country.\n\n*\n\nBorn in 1870, Osachi Hamaguchi held various posts before becoming Prime Minister of Japan in July 1929 after Tanaka Giichi (see April 20, 1927). Japan was in bad shape after the First World War, the September 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake and the Great Depression, and he instituted strict austerity measures. These did not work well and he was perceived as being too conciliatory to foreign powers, resulting in an assassination attempt in November 1930, ending his first premiership. His second premiership tried to introduce women’s suffrage, but was mired in political conflict with the ultranationalists and he resigned on 14th April 1931. Hamaguchi died just four months’ later. It was not easy going against the ultranationalists in 1930s Japan.\n\n*\n\nThe White Star Line was rather ill fated. Not only did it lose the Titanic (see April 15, 1912), it lost the RMS Atlantic as well in 1873. The Atlantic was the second ship of the firm, was also a passenger liner. Off the coast of Nova Scotia, the crew went off course in bad weather, failed to check depths, missed seeing a lighthouse, and ran into rocks at 3.15am. The lifeboats were smashed or washed away. Fishing boats came to rescue the survivors and picked up 371. 535 perished, the worst maritime disaster of its time. In the North Atlantic, the White Star Line also lost two other ships, the SS Naronic in March 1893, and the RMS Republic in January 1909.\n\n*\n\nSergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff is one of the finest pianists in the 20th Century. Born in 1873, Rachmaninoff came from a long line of soldiers and musicians. He nearly worked with Pyotr Tchaikovsky; his death affecting Rachmaninoff’s music. That plus the poor reception of his first symphony put him in a three year depression. He got married on 29th April 1902 and started writing again. Like his friend Prokofiev (see April 23, 1891), he left his homeland after the 1917 Russian Revolution, moving to the US and became a citizen before dying in March 1943. He gave to the world 13 orchestras, ten pieces of chamber music, six piano concertos, six operas, eleven choral works, and 49 other piano pieces.\n\n*\n\nOfficially the William Wrigley Jr. Company, it’s more often simply the Wrigley Company. Founded in 1891, it is headquartered in Chicago. The founder (see April 12, 1977 for his son) was rather innovative. Initially selling soap, he offered baking powder as a freebie. Baking powder proved more popular, so he offered chewing gum as a freebie. Chewing gum proved really popular, and the flavors are still with us today – Juicy Fruit, Spearmint and Double Mint. A few more flavors now, and in a lot more countries – 180, with Singapore as a notable exception, banning chew gum on 1st April 1992. On 28th April 2008, Mars Incorporated announced the purchase of the famous company – for US$23 billion. That’s … a lot of chewing gum!\n\n*\n\nIs there anyone who has not heard of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs? Have you achieved self actualization? Abraham Harold Maslow was born in 1908 and is probably the most famous psychologist. A professor at a number of institutions, he developed his own take on psychology, believing that people are driven by positive impulses. He called this humanistic psychology, which eventually became the Journal of Humanistic Psychology in 1961. To Maslow, once our basic needs are met, we can concentrate on higher goals, hence a hierarchy. Less well known though often quoted, is Maslow’s hammer: If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. He died in June 1970.\n\n*\n\nCalled the King of Ragtime, Scott Joplin wrote some 44 ragtime pieces, one ballet and one opera, Treemonisha (finally produced in 1972). He was workin’ on the railroad, he played the piano wherever he could, often in brothels. His break came at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, and ragtime music became a national craze. His most famous piece is Maple Leaf Rag, first published in 1899, making him famous and a modest fortune. He died in 1916, age only 49, with a lot more music still in him. His death saw ragtime eventually morph into jazz. In the 1960s and ‘70s, there was a revived interest in his music, with The Sting (1973) featuring a lot of his music, and earning him a posthumous Pulitzer in 1976.\n\n*\n\nBritain’s Royal Air Force was established in 1918, the world’s first independent air force, and at the time, also the world’s largest air fleet. Prior to the RAF, aircraft were seen as a supporting arm of the army or navy, a significant role some air units still play, such as operating from aircraft carriers (the first true carrier was the HMS Argus, commissioned September 1918). After the Second World War and the decisive role played by air power, not least by the RAF, every country would want a strong and independent air force. The RAF remains one of the world’s largest and best air forces. The predecessors to the RAF were the army’s Royal Flying Corps (formed 13th April 1912) and the Royal Naval Air Service.\n\n*\n\nBorn in 1920, Toshiro Mifune started out as a photographer and assistant cameraman before becoming an actor in 1947. He would go on to act in 170 films, most notably in collaboration with legendary director, Akira Kurosawa. Movies like Rashomon (1950), Seven Samurai (1954) and Yojimbo (1961), made him the most famous Japanese actor of his generation, and probably the only one known outside Japan. Another well known role was in the TV series, Shogun (1980). His screen persona influenced other actors, such as Clint Eastwood. Most of his roles were as samurai; he also acted as yakuza. Before his death in December 1997, he received several honors from Japan.\n\n*\n\nThis day in 1922 is a black day for Northern Ireland and their police force. Although largely Catholic Ireland had gained its independence in July 1921, the new Irish government continued to support the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the predominantly Protestant north, which remained under British rule. On this day, an officer of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) was killed by a sniper. Ten RIC officers went on a rampage in Catholic neighborhoods, in particular, Arnon Street. They broke into homes, smashed property, robbed, and killed six civilians, wounding one. The perpetrators were never caught and may have been responsible for other acts against Catholics. It is estimated that in 1920-1922, 465 people were killed and 1,091 wounded in Belfast alone.\n\n*\n\nCharles I of Austria should perhaps be called Charles the Last. He is the last rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the last emperor of Austria, and the last king of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia, and of Galicia and Lodomeria, and the last of the Habsburgs. Born in August 1887, he took the throne in November 1916. Not a good time as the empire was breaking apart under the pressure of the First World War. In October 1918, he gave the Poles independence, and autonomy to other nationalities. It was too late. He effectively stepped down on 11th November, and parts of the empire started declaring their independence. On 3rd April 1919, the new Austrian parliament actually banned him from the country, and he died in 1922.\n\n*\n\nWilliam Raymond Manchester was born in 1922. He served during the Second World War as a Marine, which became the basis for one of his books, Goodbye Darkness (1980). He became a journalist and wrote his first book on his colleague, H.L. Mencken, Disturber of the Peace (1951), and eventually became a professor of history. His magnus opus is considered to be American Caesar (1978). Other best sellers include The Death of a President (1967), A World Lit Only By Fire (1992), and The Last Lion, a three volume work on Winston Churchill (see April 7, 1953). In all he wrote 22 books, mostly excellent works of history. He died in June 2004.\n\n*\n\nYes, that inkblot looks like a butterfly. That inkblot is a Rorschach, named for Herman Rorschach, born November 1884. As a child his nickname was klecks, or inkblot, as he loved making them! While studying as a medical student in Berlin, he was intrigued by how people saw different things in the same inkblot, and started recording the responses of schoolchildren. Upon his return to Switzerland in 1914, he became Associate Director of Psychiatry at Herisau Hospital and published Pyschodiagnostik in 1921. He died in 1922. Today, the Rorschach inkblot test of 10 cards is supposed to reveal personality and is considered a pseudoscience – though probably more respected than most pseudosciences. What do you see?\n\n*\n\nShe was the first woman to win a Hugo and a Nebula award. Born in 1926, Anne Inez McCaffrey wrote the acclaimed Dragonriders of Pern (1967-2011) series; her books tended to straddle the genres of science fiction and fantasy. In all, she wrote over a hundred books, while most are sci fi / fantasy, she also wrote six romance novels, four children’s books, two cook books, and one non-fiction – about dragons. Among all her works, her own favorite is The Ship Who Sang (1969), partly an elegy to her father. McCaffrey was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in June 2006 and died in November 2011.\n\n*\n\nBorn Mary Francis Reynolds in 1932, Debbie Reynolds was one of the leading actresses and singers of the 1950s and ‘60s. Her breakout was the movie Singin’ in the Rain (1952). Her other famous movies include The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964) and The Singing Nun (1966). She has since continued to appear on stage, TV and movies, garnering many award nominations, but so far no Emmys, Oscars or Tonys. At one stage, she was also famous for her huge collection of movie memorabilia. She is also known as the mother of actress Carrie Fisher. For six decades, she has also been involved in the Thalians Club, a charity for the mentally disabled.\n\n*\n\nThe Admiral Scheer was a ‘pocket battleship’; the speed and size of a cruiser, but the armaments of a battleship. Launched in 1933, its design was determined by the limitations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. She served during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), and gained great fame during the Second World War. Used as a commerce raider, she sank 113,223 tons of shipping, the most successful surface raider of the war. She was also part of the famous attack on convoy PQ 17 in July 1942, and the attack on the Russian navy in August-October 1942. She served the rest of the war as a training ship and supporting operations in the Baltic Sea. On 9th April 1945, the mighty ship was sunk by British bombers.\n\n*\n\nThe movie Love Story made Elizabeth Alice ‘Ali’ MacGraw famous, along with co-star, Ryan O’Neal (see April 20, 1941). Born in 1939, she was a photographic assistant, model, interior designer, did commercials, before getting her break with Goodbye, Columbus (1969). A year later, Love Story got her an Oscar nom and a Golden Globe award. Other roles include the TV series, The Winds of War (1983) and Dynasty (1984-85), and movies, The Getaway (1972) and Convoy (1978). Her video on yoga helped spark interest in the US in the 2000s. Like O’Neal, she still has time to win that Oscar – and in her case, a Tony as well since she has been on Broadway since 2006.\n\n*\n\nAfter some half a million dead, the Spanish Civil War officially came to an end in 1939. Most folks, if they remember this war, would think of town and painting, Guernica (see April 26, 1937). The war began with a revolt of the Spanish military in July 1936. Calling themselves the Nationalists, Francisco Franco became their leader, and with the help of Germany and Italy, they won and would rule Spain for the next 35 years. Despite the help given by fellow Fascists, the good news is that Franco kept Spain out of the Second World War. The bad news is that being a Fascist state, Spain was the only west European country not to benefit from the Marshall Plan (see April 3, 1948) and the economic boom that followed.\n\n*\n\nThe most famous Japanese aircraft of the Second World War was the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. It first flew in 1939. It entered service in July 1940, called the Zero because it was year 2,600 by the Japanese calendar. When first encountered by western air forces, the Zero was a shock, outperforming its enemies, achieving a kill ratio of twelve for every Zero shot down. From mid-1943, better and more numerous American aircraft flown by more experienced pilots crushed the Zero. Codenamed the Zeke by the Americans, 10,939 were built, more than any other Japanese aircraft, used both as carrier and land based fighters. Small numbers of captured Zeros were also used by China, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\n*\n\nHere’s a woman that should be better remembered. Wangari Muta Maathai was born in 1940. She was the first woman to obtain a doctorate and a teaching position in the University of Nairobi. She was a champion for the environment, founding the pan-African Green Belt Movement, and for women’s rights. Opposing one party rule in her native Kenya, she won a parliamentary seat in 2002. For her efforts in these fields, she became the first African woman and first environmentalist to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. She died in September 2011. A year later, an environmental award was created in her honor.\n\n*\n\nThe British invaded Iraq long before the Americans did. In 1941, nationalist Rashid Ali al-Gaylani staged a coup against the pro-British regent, Crown Prince Abd al-Ilāh, who had been regent since 3rd April 1939. The plotters thought not unreasonably that with Britain on the ropes during the Second World War, now was the time to strike for Iraqi independence. Nope. The British invaded to ensure oil supplies and would stay there until October 1947. al-Gaylani would later become Prime Minister of Iraq three times, and would try unsuccessfully to strike a deal with the Germans. The pro-British monarchy would remain in power until July 1958, when another coup would eventually lead to a chap called Saddam Hussein (see April 28, 1937) taking over.\n\n*\n\nBombing was rather an imprecise science during the Second World War. In 1944, the US accidentally bombed the wrong city in the wrong country – Schaffhausen in neutral Switzerland. 38 bombers missed their target of Ludwigshafen in Germany by 190km. 35 Swiss were killed, 280 injured. The US apologized for their mistake and paid a million dollars in compensation. This was the deadliest of some 15 US bombing attacks on Switzerland, most notoriously the bombing of Zurich and Basel in March 1945. These attacks were blamed on navigational errors. Some however believe the attacks were meant to pressure the Swiss to stop supplying the Germans with raw materials and precision parts – the factories hit at Schaffhausen produced aircraft parts, shells and ball bearings for Germany.\n\n*\n\nDuring the Second World War, the greatest air-land-sea battle in history began in 1945, over a little speck of land in the Pacific called Okinawa. For 82 days, the Americans and Japanese fought bitterly over the island; 107,000 soldiers were killed and possibly as many as 150,000 civilians also died. The American commander, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., was also killed (son of Simon Bolivar Buckner, see above, 1823). 95 ships and over 3,700 aircraft were also lost. The horrific number of casualties contributed to the decision to use the atomic bomb as an alternative to the invasion of the Japanese home islands. No surprise, the Americans took until 1972 to return the island to Japan and continue to maintain their biggest bases in Japan on the island.\n\n*\n\nAn earthquake and tsunami struck the Pacific Ocean – in 1946. An 8.1 magnitude earthquake hit the Aleutian Islands, the resulting tsunami reached a height of 42m and killed five in Alaska. The west coast of the US was hit by smaller waves, reaching 4m, killing one man in Santa Cruz. Worse was to come; nearly five hours later, the tsunami, as high as 22m, reached Hawaii, striking mainly the town of Hilo, killing 159 people. Coasts as far as French Polynesia and Chile were also hit. Scientists remain puzzled at the size of the tsunami, far larger than what could have been expected from the earthquake alone. The event led to the formation of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in 1949.\n\n*\n\nThe British had ruled the Malay states for over a century under a complex and diverse system of direct and indirect control. Then came the Japanese in December 1941 and destroyed their cosy setup. After the war, it was obvious things could not go back to as they were. In 1946, the Malayan Union was formed. The Malays hated it since it gave citizenship to the other races, and stripped their traditional rulers of their powers. The United Malays National Organisation, UMNO, was formed to resist the union. The union did not last long; in January 1948 it was replaced by the Federation of Malaya. And UMNO has since been the key part of the ruling coalition of Malaysia.\n\n*\n\nBorn July 1890, he served in his country’s wars and went into exile with his father, Constantine I, until he became George II, King of Greece, in September 1922. The new Greek Republic deposed him in March 1924 and he went into his second exile. After a decade of political chaos, a plebiscite voted the monarchy back in November 1935. The chaos did not end until Ioannis Metaxas (see April 12, 1871) became dictator. On 23rd April 1940 he went into exile for a third time following the German invasion (see April 6, 1941). During the war, the Greeks were deeply divided between pro and anti-monarchist forces. Another plebiscite voted for the monarchy and George returned to Greece in September 1946. He died soon after in 1947.\n\n*\n\nSucceeding George II (see above) as King of Greece in 1947 was his brother, Paul. He joined his brother in exile three times; 1917-1920, 1923-1935, and 1941-1946. His early reign was tough, during the Greek Civil War, which ended October 1949. He was active in the 1950s, with numerous visits across Europe, building diplomatic and economic ties. However, Cyprus, which wanted to join Greece, damaged relations with the UK, who controlled Cyprus, and the Turks, who wanted to. Cyprus became independent in August 1960 and was subsequently divided following the July 1974 Turkish invasion. Paul did not live to see this, dying in March 1964.\n\n*\n\nIf you ever needed a blood transfusion, one person to thank is Charles Richard Drew. Born June 1904, he was a brilliant doctor who focused on blood related issues. He became the first African-American to obtain a doctorate from Columbia University, for his work on reconstituting blood plasma. He helped set up a blood bank for Britain in 1940, from blood collected, tested and shipped from the US. He also helped set up the American Red Cross blood bank, and fell out with the US military who insisted on a blood bank segregated by race. Nonetheless, his efforts saved thousands of lives. Tragically, in 1950, he died following an auto accident. He remains a much respected figure, with several medical institutions and schools named after him.\n\n*\n\nThanks, Barry Sonnenfeld! Born in 1953, Barry actually started in porno movies, before getting breaks as director of photography and working with others on movies like Throw Momma from the Train (1987), Big (1988), When Harry Met Sally (1989) and Misery (1990). His directorial debut was The Addams Family (1991). Some of his best work include Get Shorty (1995), Men in Black (1997) and its two sequels, he and picked up an Emmy as producer for Enchanted (2007). He’s also produced and directed Pushing Daisies (2007) for TV. Whatever he’s up to next, it’s bound to be stamped with his quirky brand of humor!\n\n*\n\nHer pilots love her. With its unique elliptical wings, many consider it the most beautiful plane ever. It first entered service in August 1938, just in time. It’s the Supermarine Spitfire, the symbol of the Battle of Britain (July-October 1940), the first wholly air battle in history. Through the Second World War, the plane would do battle with Axis aircraft on every front. The versatile (24 versions were developed!) plane also operated off carriers in the Pacific War. In 1954, the last operational flight of the Spitfire by the RAF was made from Seletar Airbase, Singapore, during the Malayan Emergency (1948-1060). In all, 20,351 were built, seeing service in 32 air forces.\n\n*\n\nThe United States Air Force Academy was established in 1954. Took a while; air power advocates had been pushing for one since 1918, and also for an independent air force, which came into being in September 1947. The academy today has a staff of 550, teaching 4,400 cadets to be air force officers and gentlemen (and women from October 1975). The academy is also one of the top tourist attractions in Colorado, drawing some three million visitors a year. Like the four other US service academies, the academy operates as an accredited university as well as a military outfit; cadets graduate with a bachelor of science degree and a commission in the US Air Force.\n\n*\n\nHe was born August 1895, a prince with little powers in British-ruled Malaya. He served in the civil service, as a volunteer soldier, and as a magistrate, before becoming Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan in August 1933. During the Second World War, he made speeches under duress in favour of the Japanese conquerors. As British Malaya became the Malayan Union (see April 1, 1946), he opposed it and when the country became independent Malaysia, the country adopted an elective royal system, and Abdul Rahman became the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong (High King) of Malaysia in August 1957. He died in 1960.\n\n*\n\nA TV series debuted today in 1963 that would make history. General Hospital is the longest running American soap opera and it’s still on the air. On 17th April 2002, the 10,000th episode aired. It’s about the 13,000th episode now. From 1979 to 1988, it was the no 1 rated show in the country. In its day, General Hospital set new standards for production quality and story telling. Among the actors who got their start on the show are Demi Moore and Rick Springfield. The list of awards and accolades would fill a book by themselves, including ten Emmys for Best Daytime Drama.\n\n*\n\nBorn March 1918, João Belchior Marques Goulart was elected into the Chamber of Deputies (federal lower house of parliament) in 1950. Appointed Minister of Labor in 1953 to deal with industrial unrest, he improved social security, set a new minimum wage, and introduced housing financing. He was elected Vice President in 1956 and 1960, and became President of Brazil in September 1961 when the incumbent resigned. He tried to institute a wide range of reforms in education, taxation, land ownership and to extend voting rights to the poor, all policies that at the time, were considered too leftwing and he was deposed in a military coup in 1964. He died December 1976. He is now well regarded in Brazil.\n\n*\n\nBorn December 1870, when she died in 1965, Helena Rubinstein was one of the richest women in the world. Polish born Chaya Rubinstein migrated to Australia in 1902, where her milky white skin drew attention to her beauty creams. Australia provided a ready source of her secret ingredient – lanolin, an oil from sheep. She opened her first salon in Melbourne, and even then was a master of marketing, offering the science of beauty. She opened in London in 1908 and New York in 1915. Although frugal in many ways, she loved clothes and the arts, becoming a philanthropist. She of course founded Helena Rubinstein Incorporated in 1902, and also the Helena Rubinstein Foundation in 1953, a children’s charity.\n\n*\n\nBorn November 1913, Lon Nol rose to armed forces chief, Defense Minister, then Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia under Norodom Sihanouk (see April 25, 1941), then premier twice. After the March 1970 coup against Sihanouk, Lon Nol became President of Cambodia, and struggled against communist insurgents and North Vietnamese troops in the country, becoming a dictator in the process, appointing himself Marshal and running military operations himself. The 1970 coup, in removing the neutralist Sihanouk, paved the way for the Cambodian Campaign (see April 29, 1970) by the US and South Vietnam. All to no avail; the communist Khmer Rouge would win the war. Lon Nol resigned in 1975 and fled into exile as Pol Pot (see April 15, 1998) took over, and died in November 1985.\n\n*\n\nToday’s the day Apple Inc came into existence in 1976. It’s probably the most innovative technology company there is, led by the iconic and mercurial Steve Jobs. The Apple (launched 11th April 1976) and Apple II (launched on 16th April 1977) would sweep the world, to be followed by the Macintosh. Include also the iPod, iTunes (launched 28th April 2003), iPhone and iPad (launched on 3rd April 2010), and you have to wonder, what’s NeXT .... Unfortunately, on 9th April 2009, ailing founder Jobs underwent a liver transplant. He never fully regained his health and died two years’ later. On 10th April 2012, Apple’s market capitalization reached US$600 billion, making it at the time, the largest company in the world.\n\n*\n\nFor Iran, today’s an important day. It’s the day Iran shed its shah and became an Islamic republic in 1979. The Iranian Revolution, fueled by Islamic fundamentalism and an increasing autocratic shah, led to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini becoming the country’s spiritual leader, with the day to day running left to pliant politicians. The troubles did not end – the Iranian Hostage Crisis (see April 24, 1984), the long and bitter Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), and widespread street protests in 2009-2010. And of course, with the demise of Saddam’s Iraq (see April 9, 2003), Iran is back in the West’s crosshairs. It’s too early to say how this will play out.\n\n*\n\nIn 1998, Time magazine named her Dancer of the Century. Arguably the best known dancer and dance choreographer of the 20th Century, Martha Graham was born May 1894. She established the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance (the first dance company in the US) and on 18th April 1926, she debuted her first concert. She performed Chronicle in 1936, considered her best work. Clytemenstra (1958) was her most ambitious, in all 97 works. She was honored in 1976 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and became a US cultural ambassador. She continued to dance until 1970 – when she was 76. She continued to choreograph until her death in 1991.\n\n*\n\nOur first of many entries for Yugoslavia. The good times ended for Slobodan Milošević in 2001, when he surrendered to face war crimes. Born August 1941, he ruled his roost from May 1989 to October 2000, in various Yugoslav republics. It is believed that his plan to create a greater Serbia at the expense of the other ethnic groups resulted in the Yugoslav Wars and introduced the world to a new term for genocide: ethnic cleansing. Let’s not go there; the various wars get real complicated. His trial lasted five years without a verdict, with ‘Sloba’ dying of a heart attack in prison in March 2006. Sometimes – indeed all too often – justice is not served.\n\n*\n\nThe top ace for the American-made F-14 Tomcat aircraft is … an Iranian. The pilot is Jalil Zandi, born May 1951. He became a pilot when it was the Imperial Iranian Air Force and when Iran of course, was a US ally. Unlike some of his colleagues, he opted to continue after the Shah’s ouster and the formation of the Islamic Iranian Republic Air Force. Clashing with his more Islamic-minded commanders, he was sentenced to ten years’ prison and nearly executed. He was saved by the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). He served through the war, downing 11 aircraft, making him the top ace of the war. Brigadier General Zandi died in 2001.\n\n*\n\nIn 2001, between China’s Hainan Island and the disputed Paracel Islands, a US Navy EP-3 survelliance aircraft collided with a People’s Liberation Army J-8 intercepter fighter. Yes, the Americans were spying in what they held to be international waters; the Chinese view the area as part of their economic zone. Two J-8s were sent to intercept, the collision caused the death of one of the Chinese pilots and the damaged EP-3 was forced to land on Hainan. The resulting incident was defused by diplomatic sidestepping – the Chinese said the Americans apologized, the Americans said they expressed regret. Hainan remains a major PLA base; the Americans continue to snoop.\n\n*\n\nThe greatest sniper of all time is the relatively unknown Simo Häyhä. Born December 1905, he joined the Finnish army in 1925 and served during the Winter War (1939-1940) against the Soviet Union. He amassed an amazing 505 confirmed kills in just 100 days – and another 200 with a submachine gun. If he wasn’t badly wounded he might have accounted for more. Like Roza Shanina (see April 3, 1924) and Zhang Taofang (see April 29, 2007), he used a version of the Mosin-Nagant rifle. Promoted from corporal to second lieutenant, he took no further part in war, took years to heal from his wounds, and returned to the simple life of a hunter. He died in 2002. When asked the secret of his success, he answered simply, Practice.\n\n*\n\nBorn September 1922, In Tam rose to hold various positions in the Cambodian government under Sihanouk (see April 25, 1941). He however was a key figure in the March 1970 coup that ousted Sihanouk and it was he who proclaimed the formation of the Khmer Republic. He fell out with coup leader, Lon Nol (see above), served briefly as prime minister in 1973, and fled when the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (see April 15, 1998) took over in 1975. When the Khmer Rouge collapsed, he was again aligned with Sihanouk, holding a number of offices. He died in 2006.\n\n*\n\nJacob Lincoln Freund was born Janary 1918. The world knows him as John Forsythe. After bit parts and serving in the Second World War, he gained fame on TV as the Bachelor Father (1957-1962), as the boss in Charlie’s Angels (1976-1981; a role reprised in the first two movies), and as the patriach in Dynasty (1981-1989; the only actor to appear in all 220 episodes). For a time, the highest paid actor on TV, and winning two Golden Globes, he was less well known for his movies. He also owned thoroughbred horses, for which he was well known in racing circles, and an art gallery. Forsythe died in 2010.\n\n*"
