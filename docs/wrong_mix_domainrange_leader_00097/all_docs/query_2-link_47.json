        "meta_description": "To the outside world, Hirohito was the emperor and thus, by\ndefinition, the dictatorial leader of Japan. However, there were\nmany political groups in Japan vying for power, especially after\n1930. The war with China created a huge split in the Japanese\npolitical structure. The army wanted to keep fighting in China.\nThey demanded more and more resources be devoted to this campaign.\nThe army had captured much of north and coastal China by 1935. This\narea was organized by the Japanese to supply much of the Japanese\narmy, so that the campaign became self supporting to some extent.\nMeanwhile, the leadership in Japan proper, mainly industrialists\nand trading interests, desired more secure raw material sources and\nmarkets in which to sell finished goods. Since these areas were\nmainly in Java, Malaysia, Burma, Formosa and similar areas, this\ngroup desired a powerful navy. Naval proponents thus saw, not\nChina, but the USA, Britain, France and the Netherlands as their\nprimary enemies, since these nations controlled the extensive\ncolonies in the areas Japan coveted. This situation was never\nresolved in Japan. The Chinese war went on. The navy got larger and\nultimately confronted the various colonial powers noted above. The\narmy never gave the navy the troops necessary to properly fight the\nwar with the west. The Japanese homeland never gave the China based\narmies the resources necessary to finish the land war (and possibly\nenable it to confront the land based Soviet forces in Siberia).\nLikely the split in the Japanese system also created a delay in\ntheir ability to negotiate an end to fighting. Since Japan had lost\nits fleet, was isolated, starving and without oil or other\nresources - all by late 1944 - many leaders wanted to seek terms\nand surrender. However the China based army was still unbeaten and\nquite strong. They wanted the war to continue and could not\nsympathize with their Japan based comrades. Thus the war drug on\nfor nearly another year - a year which saw many Japanese cities\nbombed and burned and nearly a million Japanese civilian killed.\nGiven the obstacles it faced, this fractured Japanese system\nachieved remarkable results and conquered a vast empire. However it\nwas inevitable that this empire would falter once the western\npowers organized their resources and tried to retake their lost\nempires.",
