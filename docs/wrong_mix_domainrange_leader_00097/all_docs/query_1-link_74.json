        "text": "Ó Buachalla, Liam (b. 1899, Dublin, Ireland - d. Oct. 16, 1970, Drogheda, Ireland), chairman of the Seanad Éireann (1951-54, 1957-69).\n\nÓ Cuív, Éamon (b. June 1, 1950, Dublin, Ireland), minister of community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs (2002-10), social and family affairs (2010-11), defence (2011), and environment, heritage and local government (2011) of Ireland; grandson of Eamon de Valera.\n\nÓ Dálaigh\n\nÓ Dálaigh, Cearbhall (Irish), English Carroll O'Daly (b. Feb. 12, 1911, Bray, near Dublin, Ireland - d. March 21, 1978, Sneem, County Kerry, Ireland), president of Ireland (1974-76). While still in his early 20s, he became a protégé and devoted admirer of Eamon de Valera. He worked on de Valera's newspaper and stood unsuccessfully for parliament as a candidate of de Valera's party, Fianna Fáil. The special affinity between the two lay in their passionate enthusiasm for Irish language and culture; Ó Dálaigh never used the English form of his name. He became Ireland's youngest attorney general in 1945, serving at that post until 1948 and again in 1951-53. He became a judge on the Supreme Court in 1953 and was elevated to chief justice in 1961. In 1973 he became a judge of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg. He was the agreed candidate of the major political parties to take over as president following the death of Erskine H. Childers in 1974. He continued Childers's efforts to carve out a significant role for the essentially ceremonial presidency. In September 1976, he referred to the Supreme Court for a verdict on the constitutionality of a bill that would have lengthened the time during which police could detain suspected terrorists without making formal charges. The Supreme Court upheld the emergency legislation, albeit with reservations that justified Ó Dálaigh's action. But his action rankled with members of the government, and Defense Minister Patrick S. Donegan described him in a speech after an army luncheon as \"a thundering disgrace.\" When the prime minister, Liam Cosgrave, declined to make any meaningful gesture of amends and refused to accept the resignation of Donegan (who had apologized), Ó Dálaigh resigned.\n\nO Jin U, also spelled Oh Jin Wu (b. 1917, Jilin province, China - d. Feb. 25, 1995), North Korean politician. He was defense minister (1976-95), commander of the army, and an influential member of the Communist party.\n\nOates, Sir Thomas (b. Nov. 5, 1917 - d. June 28, 2015, St. Minver, Cornwall, England), governor of St. Helena (1971-76); knighted 1972.\n\nOates, William C(alvin) (b. Dec. 1, 1835, Pike [in present Bullock] county, Ala. - d. Sept. 9, 1910, Montgomery, Ala.), governor of Alabama (1894-96).\n\nOba, Pierre (b. July 17, 1953, Ollembé, Middle Congo [now Congo (Brazzaville)]), interior and security minister of Congo (Brazzaville) (1997-2002). He has also been minister of security and police (2002-05), mines and mineral industries (2005- ), and hydrocarbons (2009).\n\nObaldía (y Orejuela), José (Arsenio Vicente del Carmen) de (b. July 19, 1806, Panama City, Colombia [now in Panama] - d. Dec. 28, 1889, David, Colombia [now in Panama]), governor of Panamá (1845, 1849-50, 1858-60) and vice president (1851-55) and acting president (1854-55) of New Granada.\n\nObaldía (Gallegos), José Domingo de (b. Jan. 30, 1845, David, Colombia [now in Panama] - d. March 1, 1910, Panama City, Panama), first vice president (1904-08) and president (1908-10) of Panama; son of José de Obaldía. He was also the last governor of the Colombian province of Panamá (1903) and minister to the United States (1904-07).\n\nB. Obama\n\nObama, Barack (Hussein)1 (b. Aug. 4, 1961, Honolulu, Hawaii), president of the United States (2009-17). He was the son of a Kenyan father and a white American mother who met and married when they were students at the University of Hawaii but who separated when he was two and later divorced. His mother subsequently married an Indonesian, and the young Barack lived in Jakarta for some years before returning to the United States. He served in the Illinois state legislature from 1997 until he was elected a U.S. senator from Illinois in 2004 - only the fifth black senator in U.S. history. In February 2007 he announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. He was widely seen as the first African-American with a realistic chance of winning the presidency. In January 2008 he won the Iowa caucus and the South Carolina primary; in February he confirmed his position as one of the two frontrunners, as he and Sen. Hillary Clinton won a similar number of delegates on \"Super Tuesday.\" He campaigned on a message of \"change\" and uniting the nation, reaching out to independents and even Republicans. Like Clinton, he vowed to withdraw from Iraq, making the point that he opposed the war from the start, unlike Clinton who voted for the 2002 congressional resolution authorizing the use of military force. After a long duel with Clinton he finally clinched the nomination on June 3, the day of the last primaries. At the convention in August he officially became the first black presidential nominee of a major party. With reduced levels of violence there, Iraq was not the dominant issue in the campaign; instead, a major financial crisis meant that, like in 1992, it was \"the economy, stupid,\" which worked against the incumbent party and helped propel Obama to a historic victory in November, when he defeated Republican John McCain 53%-46%. After less than 9 months in office, he was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for \"his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" In 2012 he was reelected over Republican Mitt Romney, 51%-47%. While he officially ended the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in 2011 and 2014 respectively, the emergence of the \"Islamic State\" in Iraq and Syria led him to ask Congress for a new war authorization in 2015. Domestically, his main accomplishment was the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") passed in 2010; after suffering what he called a \"shellacking\" in the midterm election later that year, he was hamstrung by extreme Republican obstructionism.\n\n1 His full name is given on his birth certificate as \"Barack Hussein Obama II,\" but he does not use this form; e.g., at his swearing in (where traditionally the full name is used) he just said \"Barack Hussein Obama.\"\n\nF.P. Obama\n\nR.M. Obama\n\nObama Asue, Francisco Pascual (Eyegue), prime minister of Equatorial Guinea (2016-23). He was also minister of youth and sports (1996-98) and public works and urban affairs (1998-99).\n\nObama Nfubea, Ricardo Mangue (b. 1961?), prime minister of Equatorial Guinea (2006-08). He was also second deputy prime minister (2004-06).\n\nObame, Alexis André Paul (b. Dec. 27, 1927, Lambaréné, Gabon), Gabonese diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1973-75).\n\nObame-Nguema\n\nObame-Nguema, Paulin (b. Dec. 28, 1934, Libreville, Gabon - d. Dec. 11, 2023, Libreville), prime minister of Gabon (1994-99). He was also minister of public health and population (1999) and social affairs (1999).\n\nObando (Salazar), Antonio (b. Jan. 15, 1788, Simacota, Santander, New Granada [now in Colombia] - d. Dec. 30, 1849, Tocaima, Cundinamarca, New Granada [now Colombia]), war and navy minister of New Granada (1831-32, 1832, 1833-37).\n\nObando (y del Campo), José María (Ramón) (name after adoption at age 2), original name José María Ramón Mosquera (b. Aug. 8, 1795, Güengüé, Cauca, New Granada [now in Colombia] - d. April 29, 1861, El Rosal, Cundinamarca, Granadine Confederation [now in Colombia]), president of New Granada (1853-54). He fought for the Spanish crown during most of the Latin American war for independence, but finally (1822) joined the revolutionary forces under Simón Bolívar. In the turbulent new republic of Gran Colombia (including present Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador), he opposed Bolívar's centralist government. A key event in the struggle for power was the assassination of Bolívar's lieutenant Marshal Antonio de Sucre in 1830, a deed for which many persons have held Obando responsible. Sucre's death helped clear the way for Obando's rise to the vice presidency (and acting presidency, 1831-32) and ministry of war in the newly independent State of New Granada, as Colombia was then called. In 1838-40 Obando led an unsuccessful rebellion against the Conservative Party government of Pres. José Ignacio de Márquez, and fled to Peru after his defeat. He returned to New Granada after the election victory of the Liberal Party in 1849, became a member of Congress, and in 1853 was elected president. His regime was marked by the adoption of the liberal constitution of 1853. It provided for popular election of provincial governors, and most of those elected were adverse to the executive. Obando's friends then staged a coup in 1854 in an attempt to save the party, but in the end the Conservatives gained control. Obando joined the civil war that began in 1860 on the side of Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera and was killed by government forces in 1861.\n\nO'Bannon\n\nO'Bannon, Frank (Lewis) (b. Jan. 30, 1930, Louisville, Ky. - d. Sept. 13, 2003, Chicago, Ill.), governor of Indiana (1997-2003). He succeeded his father in the state Senate in 1970 and held the seat until becoming lieutenant governor in 1989. His 1996 victory over Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith capped the costliest gubernatorial campaign in Indiana history, with the two spending a total of $15 million. Goldsmith championed competition in government, a practice he used while running the state's largest city. O'Bannon urged voters to keep Indiana on the course of economic progress established by two-term governor Evan Bayh, a Democrat who could not by law run again. O'Bannon dropped out of the gubernatorial race eight years before, becoming Bayh's running mate instead. O'Bannon's win meant Democrats won the statehouse for a third straight time, something the party had not done in 56 years. The last time Democrats won three consecutive governor elections in Indiana was in 1932, 1936, and 1940. O'Bannon's tenure began brightly with the economic boom of the late 1990s. Indiana built a record $2 billion surplus, and he cut taxes by $1.5 billion, put 500 more police officers on the streets, and won increasing funding for schools and universities. He coasted to reelection in 2000 over former U.S. Rep. David McIntosh. Shortly into his second term, the economic good times soured into a recession. Indiana lost 120,000 jobs, and tax revenues slowed to a trickle, forcing tax increases and spending cuts. Taking some conservative positions, he wanted to place a 7-foot stone monument with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol until the courts said no, and he allowed seven executions to occur without delay. He died in office.\n\nObarrio (Vallarino), Henrique de (b. May 8, 1898, La Libertad, El Salvador - d. Feb. 24, 1978, Panama City, Panama), president of Panama in rebellion (1948). He was also comptroller-general of the republic (1945-48) and director-general of the National Bank of Panama (1954-60).\n\nObasanjo\n\nObasanjo, (Matthew Fajinmi Okikiolakan Aremu) Olusegun (b. March 5, 1937, Abeokuta, Nigeria), president of Nigeria (1976-79, 1999-2007). He joined the army in 1958, rising quickly through the ranks, and during the civil war of 1967-70 (the Biafra secession) he headed a commando unit that was instrumental in ending the fighting. Brig.Gen. Murtala Mohammed seized power in a 1975 coup but soon declared that civilian rule would be restored by 1979. In 1976, Mohammed was assassinated, and his deputy, Obasanjo, reluctantly took over the leadership. Although Obasanjo's presidency was not without its controversies, he maintained Mohammed's plan of a return to civilian rule. In 1979 he called the extremely close election (in which he chose not to run) in favour of a candidate from the northern, predominantly Muslim region, thereby angering his fellow Yoruba but gaining the respect of the Hausa-Fulani leaders in the north. Obasanjo became the first military leader in Africa to hand over power to civilian rule. Throughout the next several years, he worked as a diplomat, holding various positions through the UN and other organizations. In 1995 he was imprisoned for allegedly organizing a coup against Gen. Sani Abacha. He was given a death sentence, later commuted to a 15-year jail term. Following Abacha's death in 1998, he was released. Subsequently he joined the dominant People's Democratic Party and announced his candidacy for president. He won about 63% of the vote in the 1999 election. His stated goal of establishing a democratic, transparent, corruption-free Nigeria drew the support of Western leaders. He was reelected in 2003 with about 62% of the vote. In 2004-06 he was chairman of the African Union. A bid to remain in office beyond 2007 was killed in May 2006 when the Senate unanimously rejected the necessary constitutional amendment.\n\nObaseki, Godwin (Nogheghase) (b. 1957, Benin City, Nigeria), governor of Edo (2016- ).\n\nObbov, Aleksandur (Hristov) (b. 1887 - d. 1975), interior minister of Bulgaria (1923).

July 19, 1961, Onitsha [now in Anambra state], Nigeria), governor of Anambra (2006, 2007, 2007-14).\n\nObiang Mangue, Teodoro Nguema, byname Teodorín (b. June 25?, 1969), second vice president (2012-16) and first vice president (2016- ) of Equatorial Guinea; son of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.\n\nObiang Ndong, Dámaso (b. 1947 - d. Oct. 10, 2008, Malabo, Equatorial Guinea), Equatorial Guinean diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations and ambassador to the United States (1988-94).\n\nT. Obiang\n\nObiang Nguema Mbasogo, Teodoro (b. June 5, 1942, Akoakam, Mongomo district, Spanish Guinea [now Equatorial Guinea]), president of Equatorial Guinea (1979- ). He joined the army which in 1963 awarded him a scholarship to a military academy in Zaragoza, Spain, the then colonial power. He returned home in 1965, and in 1969, one year after independence, he was put in charge of troops in the capital Malabo. Described as cunning - he was known in the local Fang language as \"Ze Bere Ekum\" which translates roughly as \"the most watchful panther\" - he rose quickly through the ranks. In 1977 he became deputy defense minister and a very powerful figure in the regime. He toppled his uncle, dictator Francisco Macías Nguema, in 1979. He was elected president in 1989 as sole candidate and again overwhelmingly in 1996, 2002, and 2009; opposition candidates complained of irregularities and in some cases withdrew from the elections. To keep all opposition at bay he brandished the spectre of \"internal and external enemies.\" He was often accused of corruption and human rights abuses. In an attempt to whitewash his image he signed up prominent Western public relations companies. In 2009 he tried to float an international scientific prize under the auspices of the UN cultural body UNESCO, offering to allocate $3 million for five years to reward \"research in life sciences.\" Non-government organizations, academics, and even Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu spoke out in indignation at the idea of a UN prize bearing Obiang's name, and in the end the project was shelved. In 2011-12 he was chairman of the African Union.\n\nObiang Nsogo, Rafael (b. 1935?), justice minister of Equatorial Guinea (1969). He was also minister of health (1969-71, 1976-78) and industry and mines (1971-76).\n\nObiano, Willie (Maduabuchi) (b.

Sept. 21, 1933, Dresden, Germany), Russian official; nephew of Knyaz Mikhail Obolensky; grandson of Knyaz Aleksandr (Petrovich) Obolensky. He was chief procurator of the Holy Synod (1905-06).\n\nObolensky, Knyaz (Prince) Aleksey (Vasilyevich) (b. June 3 [May 22, O.S.], 1819 - d.

June 19, 1963, Osubi [now in Delta state], Nigeria), governor of Delta (2023- ).\n\nObote\n\nObote, (Apolo) Milton1 (Opeto), Apolo also spelled Apollo (b. Dec. 28, 1924 [other sources say 1925], Akokoro village, Lango district [now in Apac district], Uganda - d. Oct. 10, 2005, Johannesburg, South Africa), prime minister (1962-66), president (1966-71, 1980-85), and finance minister (1980-85) of Uganda; cousin of Yekosofati Engur. He became a member of the Uganda National Congress party in 1957 and was elected to the Legislative Council in 1958. When the National Congress split, he formed the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) in 1960. Drawing its support mainly from the northern Acholi and Lango peoples, the UPC was opposed to the southern kingdom of Buganda under King Mutesa II. However, he allied his party with Buganda's Kabaka Yekka party in order to win legislative elections in 1962. Becoming prime minister, he accepted a constitution granting federal status within independent Uganda to five traditional kingdoms, including Buganda; in 1963 Mutesa took up the (largely ceremonial) post of president. In 1966, however, Obote sent troops led by Idi Amin to attack Mutesa's palace, and Mutesa fled to Britain. Obote assumed the presidency and introduced a new constitution that abolished the kingdoms and conferred broad powers on the president. In 1971 he was overthrown in a coup led by Amin. He settled in neighbouring Tanzania, where he maintained a small émigré army led by Tito Okello, which aided Tanzanian forces in deposing Amin in 1979. Obote returned in May 1980 and was elected president in December. He did not prevent Acholi and Lango soldiers from conducting a campaign of murder and pillage in the south and in Amin's home district. In 1985 he was ousted by Okello. He eventually settled in Zambia. In 2005 he planned to return, but this was delayed after government officials observed that he would have to answer for the atrocities committed during his regime. In August he announced his retirement from the presidency of the UPC.\n\n1 He adopted the name Milton in his early years out of admiration for John Milton, author of Paradise Lost.\n\nObradovic, Bosko (b. Aug. 23, 1976, Vranici, near Cacak, Serbia), Serbian politician. He was a minor presidential candidate (2017, 2022).\n\nObradovic, Vuk (b. April 11, 1947, Kondzelj, Serbia - d. Feb. 13, 2008, Belgrade, Serbia), a deputy prime minister of Serbia (2001). He was a minor presidential candidate in 2002.\n\nObrecht, Hermann (b. March 26, 1882, Grenchen, Solothurn, Switzerland - d. Aug. 21, 1940, Bern, Switzerland), Landammann of Solothurn (1913, 1917) and economy minister of Switzerland (1935-40).\n\nObregón\n\nObregón (Salido), Álvaro (b. Feb. 19, 1880, Álamos, Sonora, Mexico - d. July 17, 1928, San Ángel [now Álvaro Obregón] delegación, Mexico City, Mexico), president of Mexico (1920-24). He did not take part in the 1910-11 revolution that overthrew dictator Porfirio Díaz, but in 1912 he supported Pres. Francisco Madero against the rebel Pascual Orozco. When Madero was overthrown by Victoriano Huerta in February 1913, Obregón joined Venustiano Carranza against Huerta and consistently defeated the enemy armies; he occupied Mexico City on Aug. 15, 1914. Obregón remained allied with Carranza against the rebel leaders Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. During the campaign against Villa, he decreed anti-clerical policies and labour regulations in the areas he conquered. At the constitutional convention of 1917, he was largely responsible for the revolutionary emphasis of the document. For a period in 1917 he served in Carranza's cabinet, but ideological differences induced him to resign. In 1920, Carranza's attempt to retain power by having his own candidate elected president brought about a rebellion in which Obregón played a leading role. Carranza was soon overthrown and Obregón was elected president. He effected relative peace in the country that had seen 10 years of savage civil war, and instituted widespread social and economic reforms. Because of some of these reforms, the United States refused to recognize his government until 1923, when he promised not to expropriate Mexican holdings of American oil companies. He defeated an army rebellion in 1923-24 before retiring at the end of his term. He was again elected to the presidency in 1928, but shortly afterward he was shot and killed by José de León Toral, who held Obregón responsible for persecutions of Catholics.\n\nObregón Cano, Ricardo (Armando) (b. April 4, 1917, Río Cuarto, Córdoba, Argentina - d. June 19, 2016, Buenos Aires, Argentina), governor of Córdoba (1973-74).\n\nObregón Tapia, Álvaro (b. Dec. 18, 1916 - d.

He was also a minor presidential candidate (1962) and ambassador to Spain (1982-84), the Vatican (1983-84), Switzerland (1987-88), and the Soviet Union (1988-90).\n\nObrezkov, Aleksandr (Mikhailovich) (b. 1789 - d. Aug. 26, 1885, St. Petersburg, Russia), Russian diplomat; grandson of Aleksey Obrezkov. He was minister to Württemberg (1829-31) and Sardinia (1833-38).\n\nObrezkov, Aleksey (Mikhailovich) (b. 1718 - d. 1787), Russian diplomat.

Dec. 13, 1859 - d. Nov. 29, 1935), governor of the Seychelles (1912-18) and Barbados (1918-25); knighted 1920.\n\nO'Brien, (Donal) Conor (David Dermot Donat) Cruise, pen name Donat O'Donnell (b. Nov. 3, 1917, Dublin, Ireland - d. Dec. 18, 2008, Howth, Ireland), Irish politician; son-in-law of Sean MacEntee. A major Irish intellectual figure, he was UN special representative in Congo (Léopoldville) (1961) and minister of posts and telegraphs (1973-77).\n\nO'Brien, Sir George Thomas Michael (b. Nov. 5, 1844 - d. April 12, 1906), governor of Fiji (1897-1901); knighted 1894.\n\nO'Brien, Sir John Terence Nicolls (b. April 23, 1830, Guernsey - d. Feb. 28, 1903, London, England), governor of Heligoland (1881-88) and Newfoundland (1889-95); knighted 1887.\n\nO'Brien, Joseph Leonard (b. Nov. 6, 1895, South Nelson, N.B. - d. June 18, 1973, Montreal, Que.), lieutenant governor of New Brunswick (1958-65).\n\nO'Brien, (Ionatana) Kolouei (b. July 15, 1939, Fakaofo, Union Group [now Tokelau] - d. May 11, 2015, Fakaofo), Ulu of Tokelau (2000-01, 2003-04, 2006-07). He was faipule of Fakaofo in 1999-2008 and 2014-15.\n\nO'Brien, Larry (b. July 19, 1949, Ottawa, Ont.), mayor of Ottawa (2006-10).\n\nO'Brien, Laurence (b. 1792, Clashmore, County Waterford, Ireland - d. April 28, 1870, near St. John's, Newfoundland), acting governor of Newfoundland (1863-64).\n\nO'Brien, Lawrence F(rancis, Jr.) (b. July 7, 1917, Springfield, Mass. - d. Sept. 28, 1990, New York City), chairman of the Democratic National Committee (1968-69, 1970-72). He was a congressional aide before being persuaded in 1952 to serve as John F. Kennedy's campaign manager in his quest to win the Senate seat of the firmly entrenched Republican Henry Cabot Lodge. A brilliant strategist, O'Brien marshaled 340 \"Kennedy secretaries,\" who learned the importance of telephone and door-to-door canvasing, grass-roots voter-registration drives, and political teas. He handled Kennedy's 1958 reelection and was drafted to help in his presidential campaign. After Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960, O'Brien was named (1961) the special assistant to the president for congressional relations, a post he was asked to retain after Kennedy's 1963 assassination. In this capacity O'Brien was instrumental in helping Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson win approval for legislation introduced by the White House, including the bills that created the Peace Corps, Medicare, the Model Cities program, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and a nuclear test ban treaty. When he attempted to leave government service, Johnson appointed him postmaster general (1965). He left this post in 1968 to handle the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy, but when the latter was assassinated in June of that year, O'Brien became campaign director for Hubert Humphrey. When he was Democratic national chairman, it was his office that men working for the reelection of Nixon broke into in 1972; the ensuing Watergate scandal forced Nixon's resignation. In 1975 O'Brien surprised colleagues when he became commissioner of the National Basketball Association, a post he held until 1984.\n\nO'Brien, Terence (Christopher) (b. Jan. 6, 1936, England - d. Dec. 30, 2022, Wellington, N.Z.), New Zealand representative in the Cook Islands (1976-78). He was also ambassador to Belgium (1983-86) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1990-93).\n\nObuca, Aida (b. July 9, 1975, Gorazde, Bosnia and Herzegovina), premier of Bosnian Podrinje-Gorazde (2019-22).\n\nObuchi\n\nObuchi, Keizo (b. June 25, 1937, Nakanojo, Gunma prefecture, Japan - d. May 14, 2000, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1998-2000). The son of a politician, he resolved to become a politician himself after the death of his father in 1958. In 1963, at age 26, he was elected to the seat his father had held in the lower house of the Diet. Retaining his seat in 11 subsequent elections, he built a reputation as a congenial party functionary adept at forging behind-the-scenes compromises between competing political factions. He fought his way to the top against formidable local rivals such as prime ministers Takeo Fukuda and Yasuhiro Nakasone. He was deputy director-general in the prime minister's office in 1973 and in 1987 was named chief cabinet secretary. He also was secretary-general of the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) in April-October 1991. In 1992 he became head of the largest LDP faction. Ryutaro Hashimoto appointed him foreign minister in 1997. In 1998, the Diet named him prime minister, replacing Hashimoto, who was forced to resign following stunning losses for the LDP in elections to the upper house. Obuchi, whom pundits had called \"about as exciting as cold pizza,\" moved quickly to win the confidence of Japanese citizens. Aside from getting Japan's stagnant economy back on its feet after its worst recession in over 50 years, he put through several measures dear to conservatives, including making official the national anthem and flag. But the honeymoon came to an end late in 1999 with a controversial decision to include a Buddhist-backed party in the government, a series of police scandals, and allegations of insider trading involving a close aide. Obuchi was replaced after suffering a coma-inducing stroke on April 2, 2000, triggered in part by his grueling work schedule.\n\nObure, Chris(topher Mogere) (b. Sept. 29, 1943, Gucha district, Nyanza province, Kenya), foreign minister (2001) and finance minister (2001-03) of Kenya. He also served as minister of industrial development (1999), cooperatives development (1999), agriculture (1999-2001), public works (2008-13), and acting minister of roads (2008-09).\n\nObzina, Jaromír (b. May 22, 1929 - d. Jan. 24, 2003, Prague, Czech Republic), interior minister of Czechoslovakia (1973-83). He was also a deputy premier (1983-89). He was charged with abuse of power in 2001 for his role in an operation aimed to crush political dissent between 1978 and 1984. The operation code-named Asanace (\"Sanitation\") focused on some 50 dissidents, signatories of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto, resorting to threats and harsh interrogations to intimidate them and force them to leave the country. Fear for their life forced some 20 dissidents to officially ask Communist authorities to send them into exile after stripping them of citizenship, in what was meant to keep them from ever returning to their homeland. Prosecution of Obzina was suspended in 2002 after a judge ordered an investigation into whether he should enjoy immunity as a former legislator. He served in the Czechoslovak parliament between 1973 and 1989.\n\nÖcalan\n\nÖcalan, Abdullah, byname Apo (b. April 14, 1949, Ömerli, Sanliurfa province, Turkey), Kurdish rebel leader. He founded the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in 1978. It sought greater cultural rights for Turkey's Kurd minority, including the use of Kurdish language in education and broadcasting. The movement turned to guerrilla warfare in 1984. He drew supporters driven by Kurdish nationalism, poverty, and anger over the feudal system still prevalent in rural areas of the southeast. He recruited thousands of young Kurdish men and women and trained them with an iron fist. The guerrillas lived on rice and water in snow-covered mountains. Öcalan trained them in camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon and in northern Iraq. He ordered his rebels to kill Turkish teachers so that Kurds in the southeast would not have to learn Turkish. But Öcalan himself reportedly knew little Kurdish and spoke Turkish. He also was never in the Turkish battlefield, hiding out mostly in Syria, until that country expelled him in 1998 under Turkish pressure. He arrived in Rome, Italy, on Nov. 12, 1998, seeking political asylum. He was arrested, prompting thousands of devoted followers to take to the streets of Rome and capitals across Europe to oppose his extradition to Turkey. They marched by the thousands, launched hunger strikes by the hundreds, set themselves on fire, and blew themselves up in suicide-bombings. Turkey was trying him in absentia on capital crimes, a fact that blocked his return by Italy. Italian law forbade extraditing suspects to a country where they faced the death penalty. In January 1999 he was allowed to leave Italy, but on February 15 Turkish security forces captured him in Kenya and brought him to Turkey, where he was sentenced to death on June 29. In 2002 Turkey abolished the death penalty, and his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nO'Callaghan\n\nO'Callaghan, Mike, byname of Donal Neil O'Callaghan (b. Sept. 10, 1929, La Crosse, Wis. - d. March 5, 2004, Las Vegas, Nev.), governor of Nevada (1971-79). Adopting the first name Mike as a young boxer, he served in the Korean War where he lost his left leg below the knee. He became Nevada's first health and welfare director and a regional director in the federal Office of Emergency Preparedness before turning to politics. A Democrat, he narrowly won his first term as governor but was overwhelmingly reelected to a second term. He concerned himself with issues including the welfare of disadvantaged children, the preservation of Lake Tahoe, and affordable housing. He also advocated for prisoners' rights, arguing that companies should hire them and give them a chance to turn their lives around. Although the latter philosophy drew criticism with some labeling him as too liberal, he noted he was governor when the death penalty was reinstated in Nevada. Later he was executive editor and chairman of the Las Vegas Sun for 25 years.\n\nOcampo (Gaviria), José Antonio (b.

He began his career in government as an adviser at the Ministry of Industry in 1966. In 1972 he was appointed deputy minister of fuel and power industry and geology, and in 1976 he was promoted to the rank of minister. In January 1985 he became chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, and then in December 1987, following a reorganization of ministries, he was named minister of foreign economic relations and supply. In this position he was responsible for all of Mongolia's foreign trade operations. His political career was continuously linked with the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), which he joined in 1965. He was first elected to the MPRP's Central Committee in the late 1970s and was reelected in April 1990 at the party's 19th congress. In March 1990 the MPRP's constitutional \"leading role\" in government was abolished and Ochirbat became chairman of the Presidium of the People's Great Khural (national assembly). After the country's first-ever multiparty elections in July, in which he won a large majority in his Darhan City constituency, the first session of the new People's Great Khural elected him president of Mongolia for a five-year term. As president, he gave up the seat as a deputy in the national assembly that he had held since 1975. Mongolia adopted a new constitution in 1992 which provided for direct presidential elections. The first such election was held in June 1993, and Ochirbat, supported by the opposition parties after being dumped by the then-ruling MPRP, won against MPRP candidate Lodongiyn Tudev. In 1997, however, he lost against the MPRP's Natsagiyn Bagabandi.\n\n1 He is the son of Gendenjav and Punsalmaa; his father died when he was 5 years old, and at age 9 he replaced the patronym Gendenjavyn by the metronym Punsalmaagiyn.\n\nOchoa, Paquito, Jr., in full Paquito Navarro Ochoa, byname Jojo Ochoa (b.

Born in France and growing up in Hamburg, Ochs went with his parents in 1769 to Basel, where he entered politics, becoming Ratsschreiber (1782), Stadtschreiber (1790), and Oberstzunftmeister (1796). Adhering to the ideas of the Enlightenment, he became an opponent of the \"decayed Confederation\" and, with the outbreak of the French Revolution, joined the partisans of revolutionary change in Switzerland. He championed French intervention and urged acceptance of the French Directory's demands for curtailing traditional rights of asylum and expelling émigrés. In Paris (1796-97) he plotted with Napoléon Bonaparte the establishment of a Swiss revolutionary government and produced a draft for a constitution for a unitary Switzerland, modeled closely upon the French constitution of 1795. With few emendations, his document was accepted, and the Helvetic Republic was established April 12, 1798. In the new regime, Ochs became president of the Senate and president of the state executive organ, the Directory, but he was deposed by the party of Frédéric César de La Harpe (June 1799) and thereafter played a diminishing role in national politics. After participating in the Consulta of 1802-03, which prepared a new constitution restoring the sovereignty of the cantons, he withdrew to cantonal politics in Basel, where he achieved local prominence for his part in devising new governmental and penal codes (1813, 1821) and reorganizing the city university.\n\nOchsenbein, (Johann) Ulrich (b. Nov. 24, 1811, Schwarzenegg, Bern, Switzerland - d. Nov. 3, 1890, Bellmund, Bern, Switzerland), president of the Diet (1847, 1847-48) and defense minister (1848-54) of Switzerland.\n\nOciepka, Wieslaw (b. Feb. 16, 1922, Sosnowiec, Poland - d. [plane crash] Feb. 28, 1973, near Szczecin, Poland), interior minister of Poland (1971-73).\n\nOcón, Gonzalo, interior minister of Nicaragua (1933-36).\n\nO'Connell, Daniel, byname The Liberator (b. Aug. 6, 1775, near Cahirciveen, County Kerry, Ireland - d. May 15, 1847, Genoa, Kingdom of Sardinia [now in Italy]), Irish political leader. In 1823 he formed the Catholic Association which successfully fought elections against the landlords. Elected MP for County Clare in 1828, he was prevented as a Catholic from taking his seat, but won another election in 1829, the Catholic emancipation bill having been passed in the meantime. He sat for County Waterford (1830-31), County Kerry (1831-32), Dublin City (1832-35, 1837-41), Kilkenny City (1836-37), and County Cork (1841-47). At the general election of 1832 he nominated about half of the candidates returned, creating a significant bloc - his famous \"tail\" - of MPs who were pledged to support repeal of the 1800 Act of Union. By Feargus O'Connor, the Freeman's Journal, and his more ardent followers he was forced to raise the Repeal issue prematurely in Parliament; a motion for inquiry was defeated 523-38. By the \"Lichfield House Compact,\" he supported the Whig government in 1835-40, promising a period of calm in Ireland in exchange for reforms. In April 1840 he founded his famous Repeal Association. Yet the agitation languished until the appearance of the Nation in 1842 brought him the aid of John Blake Dillon, Charles Gavan Duffy, T.O. Davis, James Clarence Mangan, and O'Neill Daunt. In 1841-42 he was lord mayor of Dublin. In 1843 he brought up Repeal in the Dublin corporation, and carried it 41-15. But the Young Ireland party began to grow impatient of his tactics, and O'Connell allowed himself to outrun his better judgment. A meeting planned for Clontarf and expected to draw a million supporters was prohibited. In 1844 he was imprisoned for seditious conspiracy; the House of Lords set aside the verdict after 14 weeks. It soon came to an open split between him and Young Ireland (1846). In failing health, he left Ireland for the last time in January 1847, and died in Genoa on his way to Rome. After Irish independence the major street of Dublin, with his large-scale statue and plinth, was named O'Connell Street.\n\nO'Connell, Sir Maurice Charles (b. Jan. 13, 1812, Sydney, New South Wales - d. March 23, 1879, Brisbane, Queensland), acting governor of Queensland (1868, 1871, 1874-75, 1877); knighted 1868.\n\nO'Connor, Bob, byname of Robert E.

Jan. 17, 1948, Reykjavík, Iceland), prime minister (1991-2004) and foreign minister (2004-05) of Iceland. He served three terms as mayor of Reykjavík from 1982 to 1991, earning a reputation as a strong but popular leader. In 1991, even though he was not a member of parliament, he challenged the sitting head of the Independence Party, wresting control from him and leading the party to victory in the election that year, forming a coalition with the Social Democrats. After the 1995 election he dumped the Social Democrats and formed a coalition with Halldór Ásgrímsson's Progressive Party. The colourful Oddsson once again showed his dominance of Iceland's politics in 1999, as voters applauded his centre-right coalition's handling of the booming economy. The Independence Party, already the dominant force in Iceland's parliament, increased its strength in the Althing. Oddsson had an easy campaign, benefiting from three years of growth of 5% or more, which boosted purchasing power, slashed unemployment, and filled the government coffers without reigniting inflation. He was able to see off opposition parties, ridiculing their claims that prosperity had left many people in poverty, dismissing their calls for heavy increases in welfare spending, and sidestepping criticism of the management of Iceland's key fisheries industry. In May 2003 the coalition was reelected, but in order to prevent the Progressive Party from defecting and forming a government with the opposition, Oddsson had to make a deal agreeing to step down in favour of Ásgrímsson in September 2004. He then took on Ásgrímsson's post as foreign minister. He resigned from the government in 2005 to become chairman of the Board of Governors of the Icelandic Central Bank. Widely blamed for a banking system collapse that wreaked havoc on the economy, he was removed from that post in 2009 and then became co-editor of Morgunbladid. He was a presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nO'Dea, Fabian (Aloysius) (b. Jan. 20, 1918, St. John's, Newfoundland - d.

October 1911?, Sakwa, Central Nyanza, East African Protectorate [now in Kenya] - d. Jan. 20, 1994, Kisumu, Kenya), Kenyan politician. Entering politics in 1947, he was an associate of Jomo Kenyatta in the campaign for Kenya's independence from Britain. As a member of Kenya's second largest ethnic group, the Luo, he was active in recruiting Luo support for the movement, and was president of the Luo Union, a political and social organization, in 1952-57. In 1957 he was elected to the Legislative Council. A founder member of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) in 1960, he became its first vice president. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1963, and after Kenya became independent in December that year, he became minister for home affairs (1963-64) and vice president (1964-66). Considering many of Kenyatta's policies too moderate, he broke away from KANU in 1966 to form a left-wing opposition party, the Kenya People's Union, which failed to gain nationwide support. It was outlawed by Kenyatta in 1969, and some of its members, including Odinga, were detained. After his release in 1971, he rejoined KANU, but he was effectively blocked by Kenyatta and his followers from participating actively in politics. When Daniel arap Moi became president in 1978, Odinga was only temporarily brought out of the cold. In 1982 he was expelled from KANU and imprisoned for several months. He kept up his criticism of government corruption and pressed for a multiparty political system. In August 1991 he helped found the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD). In December Moi legalized opposition parties, but subsequently FORD split into two with Kenneth Matiba leading FORD-Asili and Odinga heading the FORD-Kenya group. In multiparty presidential elections held in 1992, Odinga came fourth.\n\nR. Odinga\n\nOdinga, Raila (Amolo) (b. Jan. 7, 1945, Maseno, Nyanza province, Kenya), prime minister of Kenya (2008-13); son of Oginga Odinga. In 1982 he was accused of plotting against Pres. Daniel arap Moi; he was imprisoned without trial for six years. After his release, he was twice arrested for campaigning against one-party rule, and in 1991 he sought refuge in Norway. He returned to Kenya in 1992, however, and was elected to parliament that year. In 1997 he first unsuccessfully ran for president. Odinga, of Nilotic Luo descent, then gave his support to Moi and the ruling Kikuyu-dominated Kenya African National Union (KANU), becoming energy minister in 2001. His hope of succeeding Moi as KANU's candidate for the presidency in 2002 was shattered when Moi supported Uhuru Kenyatta. Quitting KANU, Odinga formed the National Rainbow Coalition of Kenya, which, after a series of mergers, linked up with another coalition group under the leadership of former vice president Mwai Kibaki, himself a Kikuyu. Odinga played a significant role in securing the election of Kibaki as president and became minister of roads and public works (2003-05) and housing (2003-04). When Odinga successfully led a campaign against a proposed new constitution that would have further strengthened the powers of the president, Kibaki dismissed the cabinet. Odinga then formed the Orange Democratic Movement, which won a resounding majority in the December 2007 parliamentary elections. A delay in the announcement of the result of the presidential election, which Odinga also believed he had won, led him to accuse the government of electoral malpractice. Official results dubiously gave Kibaki the victory. Riots followed in western Kenya and parts of Nairobi, resulting in the death of hundreds of Kikuyu, with thousands more driven from their homes; the Kikuyu responded in areas where they were in the majority, and it was weeks before order was restored. In February 2008 former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan brokered an agreement that led to Odinga's being sworn in to the newly created post of prime minister under Kibaki's presidency and with a power-sharing cabinet. He was again a presidential candidate in 2013 and 2017, losing to Kenyatta; the result in 2017 was again contentious and a repeat election was held but boycotted by Odinga. In 2022 he lost to William Ruto.\n\nOdingar (Mbailao), Noël Milarew (b. May 5, 1932, Dowalé, Chad - d.

He served as permanent secretary in the ministry of trade, industry, and tourism from 1961 to 1964, and from 1964 to 1967 as an economist in the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. Between 1967 and 1971, he was the executive secretary in the Council of Ministers of the West Indies Associated States. For eight years, from 1971 to 1979, he gave yeoman service as president of the Farmers and Farm Workers Union. He became a member of government in 1979, and between 1979 and 1981, he was the deputy prime minister and minister for trade, industry, tourism, and foreign affairs. In 1994, he was posted to the St. Lucia mission to the United Nations, where he served as permanent representative, a post which he held with distinction until February 1996. In 1997 he was elected to parliament as Labour Party candidate for Castries North East and again became foreign minister. A longtime leftist activist, he had often challenged party leaders in a stormy career. He resigned in 2001 in a dispute over the government's direction, and then unsuccessfully sought to regain power in an alliance with a rival party.\n\nOdobescu\n\nOdobescu, Luminita (Teodora) (b.

Feb. 18, 1974, Lima, Peru), chairman of the military junta (1948-50) and president (1950-56) of Peru. A grandson of Manuel Odría, a 19th-century war hero, he entered military school in 1915, was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1919, and in 1930 graduated from the War College, to which he later returned as director. In 1946 he was promoted to brigadier general and was made army chief of staff. Pres. José Luis Bustamante y Rivero appointed him minister of the interior in January 1947. In October 1948, heading an army junta, he deposed Bustamante in a bloodless coup, to protect his country from the radical APRA party. He dissolved the legislature, declared military rule, and took measures to restore the economy and political stability. He resigned temporarily on June 1, 1950, to run unopposed for election and was inaugurated as president July 28. He used harsh repressive measures to eliminate opposition and maintain order. Economic controls were ended, foreign investment was encouraged, and some improvements were made in social security and education. The economy expanded initially, helped also by U.S. aid and higher prices for exports during the Korean War, but by the end of his term there was a mounting trade deficit and rapid inflation, as well as labour unrest and public protests against the regime. He permitted a free election in 1956, in which he did not run, then went into a self-imposed exile, spending much time in the United States. In 1962 and 1963 he ran again for president, both times coming third.

In 1966 he first won his party's presidential nomination but was narrowly defeated by the moderate conservative José Joaquín Trejos. Oduber became president of the PLN in 1970 and served as president of the Legislative Assembly in 1972-73. Elected president in 1974, he took measures to reduce inflation, improve the balance of trade, expand social-welfare programs, institute a land-reform policy, and protect the environment. He restored legal status to the Communist Party in 1975 and reopened diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1977. In 1977 he was accused of having won his 1974 campaign with contributions from the fugitive American financier Robert Vesco. He said the money was in the form of loans which had been repaid. A brilliant orator and astute negotiator, he exercised almost absolute control over the PLN until 1984, when his leadership was challenged by Óscar Arias Sánchez. He was also a vice president of the Socialist International. In 1989 a parliamentary commission investigating drug trafficking urged him to retire from public life, and in April 1990 his party barred him from politics for one year in connection with a 1985 campaign donation he took from American Lionel Casey, later accused of drug trafficking.\n\nOduoye, Simeon (Olasunkanmi) (b. 1945, Ikirun [now in Osun state], Nigeria - d.

He entered the cabinet in 1987 as minister for transport, energy, and communications, and became defense minister in 1995. He twice held the largely ceremonial post of president - a position which rotates on a yearly basis among the seven members of the cabinet. In October 2000 he announced that he would step down at the end of the year. The announcement followed weeks of intense speculation about Ogi's future. Ogi told a news conference in Bern that, like a sportsman, he was stepping down at the \"high point\" of his career. Ogi represented the more liberal, Bern-based wing of the People's Party and had found himself in recent years under political pessure from the more right-wing, Zürich-based section of the party. In 2001 UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan named Ogi, who served as director of the Swiss Ski Federation for 12 years beginning in 1969, to be his special adviser on \"sport for development and peace.\"\n\nOgi, Chikage, also spelled Oogi, stage name of Hiroko Hayashi, née Kimura (b.

Dec. 22, 1696, London, England - d. July 1, 1785, Cranham Hall, Essex, England), founder of the British colony of Georgia in America. He joined the Austrian army of Prince Eugène of Savoy in 1714, serving in the campaign against the Turks in 1716-17 and being present at the siege and storming of Belgrade. Back in England, he became member of Parliament for Haslemere in 1722. In 1729 he was chairman of a committee that brought about some much needed prison reforms. His work in behalf of insolvent debtors gave him the idea of founding a new colony in North America where the poor could start afresh and also as an asylum for persecuted Protestant sects. In 1732 he and 19 others secured a charter for such a colony in what became Georgia. In January 1733 he arrived at Charleston with 120 colonists; in the same year he founded Savannah. On the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain in 1739, he conducted a vigorous defense of the colony. Though his force proved inadequate to capture the Spanish town of St. Augustine, Florida, he was able to repel an attack on Fort Frederica, Georgia (1742), displaying great personal courage and leadership in the engagement. His popularity with all classes of the population helped to assure the safety of the colony, which continued to grow and prosper after the war. He returned to England in 1743. In 1745, now a major general, he took part in the campaign against the Jacobites; for his slackness in pursuit of the retreating rebels he was tried by court-martial but acquitted. He then saw no further active military service. With his fellow trustees of Georgia, he surrendered the charter in 1752. He served in Parliament until he lost his seat in 1754. In 1765 he was promoted to full general.\n\nOgnjanovic, Vuk (b. Oct. 29, 1939), finance minister of Yugoslavia (1993-94).

Oct. 24, 1842, Lima, Peru), supreme director of Chile (1818-23); illegitimate son of Ambrosio O'Higgins, marqués de Osorno. He was early influenced by Francisco de Miranda and others involved in the struggle for Latin American independence. In 1806 he became a member of the town council of Chillán. In 1810 a national junta composed of local leaders replaced the Spanish governor of Chile, and by 1811 Chile had its own congress, of which O'Higgins was a member. When the viceroy of Peru sponsored an expedition to reestablish royal authority in 1814, O'Higgins quickly rose from the rank of colonel of militia to general in chief of the independentist forces. Soon he was also appointed governor of the province of Concepción. But the nationalist forces were defeated at Rancagua. Several thousand Chileans, including O'Higgins, crossed the Andes into Argentina in flight from the royalists. In 1817 he returned to Chile with the Argentine general José de San Martín and a combined army consisting of Argentine troops and Chilean exiles. They decisively defeated the Spanish at Chacabuco, and O'Higgins was elected interim supreme director. Independence was declared on the first anniversary of the battle, and he became the first leader of the new state. He created a working governmental organization, built a national navy, and mounted a major military expedition against Peru to fight the royalists. However, his reforms antagonized the church, the aristocracy, and the business community; growing Chilean nationalism also made his Argentinian connections a liability, and he was deposed and exiled in 1823. He remained in Peru for the rest of his life, refusing invitations to engage in counterrevolution.\n\nO'Higgins, Kevin (Christopher), Irish Caoimhghín Ó hUigín (b.

March 12, 1910, Toyohama, Kagawa prefecture, Shikoku, Japan - d. June 12, 1980, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1978-80). He pursued a career in the finance ministry and came under the eye of Hayato Ikeda, who, when he became finance minister, made Ohira his private secretary in 1949. In 1952 Ohira was first elected to the House of Representatives, holding his seat for 10 terms. Well known for his negotiating abilities, he became Prime Minister Ikeda's chief cabinet secretary in 1960 and was credited with suggesting the healing \"low posture\" policies toward the leftist opposition, which restored the nation to stability after the anti-American confusion of the late 1950s. As minister of foreign affairs (1962-64) in the second Ikeda cabinet, he prepared the way for restoration of relations with South Korea. In 1968-70 he served as minister of international trade and industry. In 1971 he became the leader of the Kochi-Kai faction of the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP). As Kakuei Tanaka's foreign minister (1972-74), Ohira was the co-architect of normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China. He was finance minister in 1974-76 and secretary-general of the LDP in 1976-78. In 1978 he won the presidency of the LDP, defeating incumbent Takeo Fukuda, and as a result was elected prime minister. \"I have no grand plans,\" he said, \"I just want the Japanese people to live in happy families in green cities.\" His main aim was to create middle-sized garden cities as refuges from the noise, pollution, and overcrowding of the Tokyo-Osaka megalopolis. In May 1980, he decided to call new elections rather than resign following his party's surprise defeat in a no-confidence vote.

Nov. 4, 1933, Zungeru, northern Nigeria - d. Nov. 26, 2011, Reading, England), president of Biafra (1967-70). He joined the Nigerian army in 1957. He served with the Nigerian force in the UN Congo operations in 1961 and was named governor of the mainly Ibo-speaking Eastern Region of Nigeria after the coup of January 1966 by eastern officers that toppled the civilian administration. However, in July 1966 military officers from the northern and western reaches of the country staged another coup that killed Ibo general Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi and installed Col. Yakubu Gowon as head of state. Ojukwu cooperated with the new regime until September 1966, when there was a general massacre of easterners living in the north. The ensuing mass of refugees crowded into the eastern region, severely taxing Ojukwu's ability to feed and house them. Great resentment then arose against the federal government, and calls for secession arose. Ojukwu and Gowon met briefly at Aburi, Ghana, in January 1967, to forestall the onset of violence, but the impasse remained. Feeling a threat of genocide against his people, Ojukwu reluctantly proclaimed the Eastern Region the independent Republic of Biafra in May 1967, thus precipitating the Biafran War, and for three years acted as head of state and supreme commander. Deaths in the war are estimated in the millions. When his forces were finally defeated in 1970, he fled to Ivory Coast. He returned to Nigeria under a general amnesty in 1982 and attempted to return to politics, joining the National Party of Nigeria, but his Senate bid was unsuccessful and the new military coup of December 1983 led to his imprisonment. He was released two years later but was banned from standing for president in the 1993 elections. In 1998 he founded his own party, the People's Democratic Congress.

After the Somaliland campaign he underwent further military training in Kenya. Promoted to the rank of sergeant, he went to Burma at the close of the war. He finally returned to Uganda in 1955 and was given officer's rank when the country became independent seven years later. After independence he enjoyed rapid promotion and became army chief of staff in 1970. When Idi Amin seized power in 1971, Okello immediately went into exile in Tanzania and, with Milton Obote, played a major role in keeping alive the opposition to Amin's rule. In 1979 he led the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA), which, with the support of the Tanzanian military, succeeded in ending Amin's rule. He was made commander of the Ugandan armed forces. Though well past retirement age and no longer physically fit, Okello was retained in his post by Obote because of his past loyalty, his army seniority, and the fact of his being from the Acholi tribe, which made up at least half of the army's strength. Okello was one of the very last men whom Obote would have suggested of being disloyal to him. However, after the Acholi soldiers - dissatisfied over recent army promotions - decided to mutiny under the leadership of Brig. Basilio Okello (no relation), Tito Okello was invited to take over the country's leadership (July 1985). Six months later, he was overthrown by Yoweri Museveni, who had waged a 5-year bush war against Obote. Okello fled to southern Sudan with the remnants of his army.
