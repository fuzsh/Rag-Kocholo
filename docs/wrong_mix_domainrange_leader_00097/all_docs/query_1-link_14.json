        "text": "Representative of the voters to a parliament\n\nA member of parliament (MP) is the representative in parliament of the people who live in their electoral district. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this term refers only to members of the lower house since upper house members often have a different title. The terms congressman/congresswoman or deputy are equivalent terms used in other jurisdictions. The term parliamentarian is also sometimes used for members of parliament, but this may also be used to refer to unelected government officials with specific roles in a parliament and other expert advisers on parliamentary procedure such as the Senate parliamentarian in the United States. The term is also used to the characteristic of performing the duties of a member of a legislature, for example: \"The two party leaders often disagreed on issues, but both were excellent parliamentarians and cooperated to get many good things done.\"\n\nMembers of parliament typically form parliamentary groups, sometimes called caucuses, with members of the same political party.\n\nMain article: Westminster system\n\nThe Westminster system is a democratic parliamentary system of government modelled after the politics of the United Kingdom. This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the Commonwealth level, a \"member of parliament\" is a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Commonwealth (federal) parliament. Members may use the postnominal \"MP\" after their names. \"MHR\" (\"Member of the House of Representatives\") was not used, which was affirmed by cabinet in 1901 and reaffirmed in 1951 and 1965.[1] However, the prohibition of \"MHR\" does not appear to have been strictly enforced, as it was used most recently by Tony Abbott when he was in the parliament (1994–2019).[2][3] A member of the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, is known as a \"Senator\".[4]\n\nIn the Australian states and territories, \"MP\" is commonly used. In bicameral legislatures, members of the lower house (legislative assembly or house of assembly) also use the post-nominals \"MLA\" or \"MHA\" and members of the upper house (legislative council) use \"MLC\".\n\nMLCs are informally refer to as upper house MPs.\n\nThe Parliament of the Bahamas is the bicameral national parliament of Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The parliament is formally made up by the monarch (represented by the governor-general), an appointed Senate, and an elected House of Assembly. It currently sits at Nassau, the national capital.\n\nThe structure, functions, and procedures of the parliament are based on the Westminster system.\n\nMain articles: Member of Parliament (Bangladesh) and Jatiya Sangsad\n\nIn Bangladesh, a member of parliament is an individual who serves in the unicameral Jatiya Sangsad or House of the Nation. Members of the Jatiya Sangsad are elected at a general election, usually held once every five years unless Parliament is dissolved sooner by the president on the advice of the prime minister. Under the Constitution of Bangladesh, an individual is required to be a citizen of Bangladesh and must have attained the age of 25 years in order to qualify for election to Parliament.\n\nThe Parliament consists of 300 directly elected members from general seats elected by use of first past the post who represent single-constituencies, while 50 seats are reserved exclusively for women and are allocated on a proportional basis. After an election, the Election Commission allocates reserved seats to parties based on the number of general seats they won. A party then presents a list of candidates, each requiring a presenter and a seconder. If the number of candidates presented and seats allocated is equal, then there is no election and the reserved seats are filled in accordance with the candidate lists prepared by parties. In the event there are more candidates than seat allocations, the 300 MPs elected from general seats vote through use of the single transferable vote system to determine the reserved seats. In reality, there has never been an election for reserved seats as parties have never nominated more candidates than they have been allocated.[5] In order to form a Government, a political party or alliance usually requires a simple majority in Parliament. Since Bangladesh's independence, the prime minister has concurrently held the position of Leader of the House.\n\nMain article: Parliament of Barbados\n\nThe Parliament of Barbados is the legislative branch of the government of Barbados. It is a bicameral body, composed of an appointed Senate and an elected House of Assembly. The Senate (upper house), the direct successor of a pre-Independence body known as the \"Legislative Council\"—comprises 21 senators appointed by the president. The President appoints 12 Senators on the advice of the Prime Minister and two on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition.The remaining seven Senators are nominated by the President at their discretion (that is, the President is not bound by other political leaders' advice in these appointments) to represent various religious, social, economic, or other interests in Barbados.\n\nIn the absence of an opposition leader in parliament (i.e. in the case of a landslide victory where one party takes all 30 seats in the House of Assembly, as occurred in 2018 and 2022) the president will then appoint the remaining two senators in the opposition's stead allowing for 9 independents instead.\n\nThe House of Assembly (lower house) is made up of 30 members of Parliament, elected to five-year terms on a first-past-the-post basis in single-seat constituencies.[6]\n\nMain article: Member of Parliament (Canada)\n\nThe Parliament of Canada consists of the monarch, the Senate and the House of Commons. Only members of the House of Commons are referred to as members of Parliament (French: député); members of the Senate are called Senators (French: sénateur).[7] There are currently 105 seats in the Senate and 338 in the House of Commons.[8] Members of Parliament are elected, while senators are appointed by the governor general on behalf of the sovereign at the direction of the prime minister. Retirement is mandatory for senators upon reaching the age of 75 years.\n\nEach province (and territory) has its own legislature, with each member usually known as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). In certain provinces, legislators carry other titles: Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in Ontario, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) in Quebec (French: député) and Member of the House of Assembly (MHA) in Newfoundland and Labrador. The provincial upper houses were eliminated between 1876 (Manitoba) and 1968 (Quebec).\n\nMain articles: Gibraltar Parliament and Elections in Gibraltar\n\nIn Gibraltar, members of parliament serve in the unicameral Gibraltar Parliament. There are 17 seats in the Parliament, to which candidates are elected by block voting. Each candidate represents the whole of Gibraltar as their constituency.\n\nA member of Parliament is a member of either of the two houses of the Indian Parliament: Lok Sabha (lower house) and Rajya Sabha (upper house). Lok Sabha has 543 seats, all of whom are directly elected by the citizens of India from each parliamentary constituency of states and union territories via first-past-the-post voting. Rajya Sabha can have 245 members, of which 238 members are indirectly elected. Of these 238 members, 229 belong to the state legislatures and 9 belongs to the union territories of Delhi, Puducherry, and Jammu and Kashmir, and are elected by using the single transferable vote method of proportional representation. The remaining 12 members are nominated by the president for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Each state has a fixed number of representatives allocated in each chamber, in order of their respective populations. The state of Uttar Pradesh has the greatest number of representatives in both houses. The person which secures the support of more than half the seats in the Lok Sabha forms the Government. To form the government, parties may form a coalition.\n\nThe term of a member of the Rajya Sabha is six years, while Lok Sabha members are elected for a term of five years, unless the house is dissolved sooner. Rajya Sabha is a permanent house that is not subject to dissolution, and one third of the members retire every two years. Vacancies in both houses, whether because of death or resignation of a member, must be filled by using a bypoll within six months of the vacancy; the newly elected member then only serves the remainder of the term of the seat to which they are elected. The number of seats in both houses is regulated by the Constitution and parliamentary statutes.\n\nMain article: Teachta Dála\n\nSince the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922 and subsequently in the Republic of Ireland, the legislature of Ireland is known as the Oireachtas, and consists of the president; the upper house, Seanad Éireann (or Senate); and lower house, Dáil Éireann (Assembly, or House of Representatives). They are functionally similar to other bicameral parliaments, with the lower house being significantly more influential and having more power over the creation of legislation. Elections to Dáil Éireann are held at least every five years using the single transferable vote; while elections to Seanad Éireann are restricted to members of both houses, elected members of local authorities, and alumni of National University of Ireland colleges. Eleven senators are nominated directly by the Taoiseach.\n\nA Member of Dáil Éireann is known as a Teachta Dála (TD) or \"Deputy to the Dáil\", and addressed as \"Teachta\" (Deputy), while a Member of the Seanad is known and addressed as Seanadóir (Senator). These titles are used much more commonly in English than the official Irish.\n\nA member of Parliament was the term used to refer to a member of the pre-1801 Irish House of Commons of the Parliament of Ireland. Irish members elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland were also called members of Parliament from 1801 to 1922. Northern Ireland continues to elect MPs to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nMain article: Parliament of Jamaica\n\nThe Parliament of Jamaica is the legislative branch of the government of Jamaica. It is a bicameral body, composed of an appointed Senate and an elected House of Representatives. The Senate (upper house), the direct successor of a pre-Independence body known as the \"Legislative Council\"—comprises 21 senators appointed by the governor-general: thirteen on the advice of the prime minister and eight on the advice of the leader of the opposition.\n\nThe House of Representatives, the lower house, is made up of 63 (previously 60) members of Parliament, elected to five-year terms on a first-past-the-post basis in single-seat constituencies.\n\nThe National Assembly of Kenya has a total of 349 seats; 205 members are elected from the constituencies, 47 women are elected from the counties and 12 members are nominated representatives.

In Malay, a member of Parliament is called Ahli Parlimen, or less formally wakil rakyat (people's representative).[9]\n\nMembers of Parliament are elected from population-based single-seat constituencies using first-past-the-post voting. The prime minister must be a member of Parliament.\n\nMembers of Parliament are styled Yang Berhormat (\"Honourable\") with the initials Y.B. appended prenominally.

When appointed from outside the House, the speaker is also considered a member of the Parliament. The Constitution lists the qualifications and disqualifications from serving as a member of Parliament.[10]\n\nPrivileges of members of Parliament and their Code of Ethics are laid out in the House of Representatives (Privileges and Powers) Ordinance.[11]\n\nThe Parliament of Nauru consists of 18 seats. Members of Parliament are entitled to use the prefix The Honourable.\n\nThe New Zealand Parliament is made up of the monarch and the unicameral House of Representatives.

There are 72 electorate MPs, of which seven are elected only by Māori who have chosen to be registered on a separate Māori electoral roll. The remaining members are elected by proportional representation from published party lists.[12]\n\nSince 1907, members of the House of Representatives have been referred to as 'Member of Parliament', abbreviated MP. From the 1860s until 1907 they were designated as 'Member of the House of Representatives', abbreviated 'MHR'. Between the first general election, in 1853, and the 1860s, the designation was \"Member of the General Assembly\", abbreviated MGA.[13] Before 1951, New Zealand had an upper house, the Legislative Council, whose members were appointed.\n\nA member of Parliament is a member of either of the two houses of the Pakistani Parliament: the National Assembly of Pakistan and Senate of Pakistan. The National Assembly of Pakistan has a total of 342 members, of whom 272 are directly elected, and 70 seats are reserved for women and minorities.

(Between 1921 and 1973, Northern Ireland was governed by the bicameral Parliament of Northern Ireland. Members of its lower house, the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, were known as Member of Parliament.)\n\nthe Senedd (Welsh Parliament), with 60 elected members called Member of the Senedd (English - MS); Welsh: Aelod o'r Senedd, AS)[14]\n\nthe London Assembly, with 25 members elected under the additional member system every four years, called Members of the London Assembly (AM)\n\nMPs are elected in general elections and by-elections to represent constituencies, and may remain MPs until Parliament is dissolved. \"If it has not been dissolved earlier, a Parliament dissolves at the beginning of the day that is the fifth anniversary of the day on which it first met.\" (Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022).\n\nA candidate to become an MP must be a British or Irish or Commonwealth citizen, be at least 18 years of age (reduced from 21 in 2006), and not be a public official or officeholder, as set out in the schedule to the Electoral Administration Act 2006.[15]\n\nTechnically, MPs have no right to resign their seats (though they may refuse to seek re-election). However a legal fiction allows voluntary resignation between elections; as MPs are forbidden from holding an \"office of profit under the Crown\", an MP wishing to resign will apply for the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Stewardship of the Manor of Northstead which are nominally such paid offices and thus result in the MP vacating their seat. (Accepting a salaried ministerial office does not amount to a paid office under the Crown for these purposes.)\n\nThe House of Lords is a legislative chamber that is part of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Although they are part of the parliament, its members are referred to as peers, more formally as Lords of Parliament, not MPs. Lords Temporal sit for life, Lords Spiritual while they occupy their ecclesiastical positions. Hereditary peers may no longer pass on a seat in the House of Lords to their heir automatically. The 92 who remain have been elected from among their own number, following the House of Lords Act 1999 and are the only elected members of the Lords.[16]\n\nMembers of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, are styled \"members of Parliament\", while members of the Senate, the upper house, are referred to as \"senators\".\n\nMember of Parliament can be the term (often a translation) for representatives in parliamentary democracies that do not follow the Westminster system and who are usually referred to in a different fashion, such as deputé in France, deputato in Italy, deputat in Bulgaria, parlamentario or diputado in Spain and Spanish-speaking Latin America, deputado in Portugal and Brazil, and Mitglied des Bundestages (MdB) in Germany. However, better translations are often possible.\n\nPrior to the takeover of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in August 2021, a member of parliament (MP) was a member of the lower house of the bicameral National Assembly of Afghanistan: a member of the Wolesi Jirga (House of People) held one of the in total 250 seats in the lower house.

'delegate', i.e. of a certain electorate) is also common (abbreviated Abg., never follows the name but precedes it).\n\nIn accordance with article 38 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which is the German constitution, \"[m]embers of the German Bundestag shall be elected in general, direct, free, equal, and secret elections. They shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience.\" An important though not constitutionally required feature of German parliamentarianism is a slightly modified proportional representation.\n\nThe 16 federal states of Germany (Länder) are represented by the Bundesrat at the former Prussian House of Lords, whose members are representatives of the respective Länder's governments and not directly elected by the people.\n\nMembers of the Hellenic Parliament are known as vouleftés (βουλευτής, \"councillors\") in Greek, which is rendered into English as \"members of parliament\".

DPR), known in Indonesian as Anggota DPR (member of the DPR). Members of the upper Regional Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah, abbr. DPD) are referred to as senator,[18] although the term Anggota DPD (member of the DPD) is also widely used. These titles are not used in formal naming convention following a member's name unlike the Westminster system.\n\nCurrently, there are 575 and 136 members in the DPR and the DPD respectively, both elected for a renewable five-year term. Members of the DPR are required to be a member of a registered political party, whereas members of the DPD are independent.\n\nSee also: Knesset\n\nA member of the Knesset (Hebrew: חבר הכנסת) is one of the 120 members of the Knesset.

The two houses of parliament together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately.\n\nMain article: Member of Parliament (Japan)\n\nIn Japan, both houses of today's national parliament, the National Diet (Kokkai), are directly elected, and although the two chambers differ in legislative and political authority, term length and age restriction of eligibility, the members of both houses are generally equal in personal status (financial compensation, immunity, etc.). There are currently 710 members of the National Diet (Kokkai giin, 国会議員): 465 members of the House of Representatives (Shūgiin giin, 衆議院議員) and 245 members of the House of Councillors (Sangiin giin, 参議院議員). The former are elected in general/by-/repeat elections of members of the House of Representatives (Shūgiin giin sō-/hoketsu-/sai-senkyo), the latter in regular/by-/repeat elections of members of the House of Councillors (Sangiin giin tsūjō-/hoketsu-/sai-senkyo). Under the postwar constitution, the prime minister is elected by the National Diet and must be a member of the National Diet, as must the majority of other ministers; by practice, all prime ministers since 1947 have been members of the House of Representatives so far.\n\nUnder the constitution of the Empire of Japan, the Imperial Diet (Teikoku-gikai) was a bicameral legislature of two houses, generally equal in legislative authority, and while the members of both houses received the same financial compensation - from 1920 and 1947, ¥7500 for the two presidents, ¥4500 for the two vice-presidents, ¥3000 for all other members of both houses, except Imperial princes, dukes and marquesses—their status was different by definition: The upper house consisted mainly of hereditary nobles and lifetime-appointed peers, the lower house of elected commoners. In the First Imperial Diet in 1890, there were initially 551 members of the Imperial Diet (Teikoku-gikai giin, 帝国議会議員, or in contemporaneous script 帝國議會議員): 251 members of the House of Peers (Kizokuin giin, 貴族院議員) and 300 members of the House of Representatives (Shūgiin giin); of the House of Peers members, 10 were members of the Imperial family, 31 were hereditary members from the two upper nobility ranks, 104 were members elected in mutual elections from the three lower nobility ranks, 61 were lifetime-appointed members (many of these from the bureaucracy) and 45 were members elected by the 15 top taxpayers in each of the 45 prefectures. The number of noble and appointed members of the House of Peers was not fixed and varied gradually over time as members died or new peerages were granted; the number of elected top taxpayer seats, Imperial Academy seats (introduced in 1925), members appointed from the colonies Chōsen/Korea and Taiwan/Formosa (introduced in 1945), and the size of the House of Representatives was fixed by law, but was also changed several times over the decades. The last, 92nd Imperial Diet of 1946–1947 had 839 members - 466 members of the House of Representatives and 373 members of the House of Peers.[20] As the regulations establishing the cabinet (naikaku) and the cabinet's prime minister (naikaku sōri-daijin) were decreed before the Imperial constitution, the prime minister did not have to be a member of the Imperial Diet, but after the establishment of the Imperial Diet in 1890, many prime ministers were appointed from the House of Peers; very few were members of the House of Representatives, viz. Takashi Hara, Osachi Hamaguchi, and Tsuyoshi Inukai.\n\nAccording to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the term deputy (Kazakh: депутат, romanized: deputat) is the main and widely used word to describe a member of parliament (Kazakh: парламент депутаты, romanized: parlament deputaty) as a whole, encompassing both the lower house Mäjilis and the upper house Senate.

It is bicameral, divided into two kamers (English: chambers). The Senate is known in Dutch as the Eerste Kamer (First Chamber) and its members as senatoren, senators. The House of Representatives, known in Dutch as the Tweede Kamer (Second Chamber), is the most important one. The important debates take place here. Also, the Second Chamber can amend proposed laws and can propose laws itself. The Senate does not have these capabilities. Its function is a more technical reviewing of laws. It can only pass a law or reject it. Both chambers are in The Hague, which is the seat of parliament but not the official capital of the Netherlands, which is Amsterdam.\n\nThe 150 members of the House of Representatives are elected by general elections every four years (or earlier if the government falls). The 75 members of the Senate are elected indirectly. The members of the twelve provincial parliaments and the councils of the three Caribbean special municipalities elect the senators. The value of a vote of a member of a provincial parliament is weighted by the population of the province. Provincial parliaments, the States Provincial, are elected by general elections every four years; a new Senate is elected three months after the provincial elections.\n\nMain article: Assembly of North Macedonia\n\nIn the Republic of North Macedonia there are 120 members of parliament (Macedonian: Sobranie) called Pratenici (singular Pratenik).\n\nA member of parliament is an elected member of the Stortinget.
