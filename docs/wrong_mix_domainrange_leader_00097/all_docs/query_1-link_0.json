        "text": "Hamaguchi Osachi (born May 1, 1870, Kōchi, Tosa province, Japan—died Aug. 26, 1931, Tokyo) was a Japanese politician and prime minister (1929–30) at the outset of the Great Depression.\n\nHe was adopted into the Hamaguchi family at an early age. After his graduation from the Tokyo Imperial University in 1895, he joined the government in the Finance Ministry. Rising rapidly through the ranks, he entered politics and in 1914 was elected to the Diet (parliament). In 1924 he became finance minister in the government of Katō Takaaki and then minister of home affairs. Soon he was elected president of the liberal Minseitō (Democratic Party), and in July 1929 he was made prime minister."
