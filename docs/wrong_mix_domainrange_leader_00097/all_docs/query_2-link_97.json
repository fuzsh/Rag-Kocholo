        "text": "5. Disappointing Victory​\n\nA blind child\n\nGuided by his mother,\n\nAdmires the cherry blossoms.\n\n-Kikaku\n\nI\n\nAugust of 1918 saw the Tokugawa Cabinet enter its third year, while the European War entered its fourth. Neither anniversary was met with any enthusiasm. But while for Europe the horrors of the war and feelings of dread were very much immediate, the trenches to which an entire generation had been sacrificed standing only a few miles north of Paris, for Japan the senselessness of the war and the burden that it meant were made much worse by the insurmountable distance, as if the war and the country stood on opposite edges of the world.\n\nTo answer the simple question of “Why we fight?” had been troublesome enough in 1914, when politicians and diplomats boasted of the need to honor Japan’s alliances and help her friends, and the supposed advantages it would mean for the Empire in terms of status and gains. Yet, after four years of war in which thousands upon thousands of soldiers had been sent to fight and die in faraway lands for reasons that no man could truly discern anymore, the question had become impossible to answer. Opposition to the war had existed since its inception, but it was only after the Somme that the anti-war movement in Japan began to truly coalesce. Unprepared for the unrelenting harshness and cruelty of the war that the returning soldiers and chroniclers brought home from the trenches and the fields of death, neither the government nor the public knew exactly how to react to a war that was proving as horrid and bleak as it was remote and senseless. Even when the government was successful in censoring or obscuring the facts, it could not in any way hope to hide the everyday sacrifices the people had to endure, the inexistence of any real victory, any concrete achievement, any obtainable goal or an end in sight.\n\nThe three years of war took a heavy toll on both the country and the Prince Tokugawa’s Government. Drained by the need to keep the war effort, the Prince’s Cabinet faced an uphill battle dealing with the needs of Japan’s European allies, a weary public and a conflictive Diet in which the Constitutional Parties bid their time while extorting demands in exchange of support. Thus, what had in the beginning appeared to Prime Minister Tokugawa Iesato a dream come true, the opportunity to restore his family’s reputation and good standing, slowly turned into a nightmare as the need to curb spending, balance the budget and fund the Expeditionary Force in Europe consumed much of his energy and undermined his domestic programs, designed to make up for the effects of the war and the unfulfilled promise of the Yamamoto-Seiyūkai Alliance. The victory of Hara Takashi’s Seiyūkai over the government-backed candidates in the elections of 1916, resulting in an enlarged majority for the former, was in part a result of the government’s commitment to the war over the country, many would conclude.\n\nAnd yet, the war was less of a war than an abstract concept, a distant shadow: the Somme, Jutland, Bullencourt and other names appeared in every newspaper and every government report, but they meant little except that more men would not be returning, and that another million yen would have to be spent in uniforms and munition rather than in roads and schools. As small as Japan’s contribution was to the overall effort of the Allied Powers, it was an onerous burden for a nation that had no real stake in what was ultimately a meaningless squabble between the European nations over petty revenges and Imperialist rivalries.\n\nWhat was more, throughout the war, there was always a stark contrast between those who benefited and those who suffered: while ambitious officers returned with accolades, experience and new knowledge on the arts of war, soldiers could hope only to return to their homes alive; while the politicians exalted the patriotic virtues of the army and its struggle against nebulous enemies that Japan had little reason to hate, it was the common families that had to send their sons and fathers and brothers to die in the trenches of Europe; and while the disappearance of European (and later American) products from Asian and African trade opened new extensive markets to Japanese products, resulting in a boom for Japan’s industries, it was not the common people that enjoyed those benefits, all the while the Labor movement still struggled in the face of strong opposition from the Government and the financial-industrial interests behind it.\n\nUltimately, the Tokugawa Cabinet –as well as the country´s stability- rested on uneasy foundations, and its inability to confront the mounting social inequalities or properly discern and respond to the consequences of the war would be best seen in the second half of 1918, during the Rice crisis.\n\nII\n\nCould the Rice Riots of 1918 have been avoided had Japan not entered the war? Perhaps, but in truth its roots preceded the Great War and its causes were mostly independent: erratic growing seasons between 1914 and 1920 had created a volatile rice market which saw constant speculation by rice merchants becoming the norm; tight European grain markets, the government buying up existing stocks to supply the troops in Europe and poor harvests in 1917 and 1918, in turn depleted the Japanese domestic stocks,(1) and if we add an inefficient distribution system it comes as no surprise that the prices of rice more than doubled in just two years. The result was extreme economic hardship throughout Japan, which affected rural areas –where rice was the main staple of life-, in particular. The difference between the low prices farmers received due to government regulation and the high market prices resulted in tremendous hostility in the countryside against rice merchants and government officials who had allowed the consumer price to spiral out of control. In July, the powder keg was finally lit.\n\nA painting depicting the Rice Riots.​\n\nThe riots began in the fishing villages on the coast and soon spread across the country as protesters burned the houses of rice merchants and demanded government action to halt the rises in rice prices. Wracking the country with enormous yet poorly organized demonstrations, riots and strikes that were aimed at the rich and the police swept the nation. Apolitical and improvised, the riots saw the involvement of up to 700,000 people -including laborers, fishermen, farmers, cartmen, roustabouts, factory workers and the middle class-, and would last from July to September of 1918. What had started with the wives of fishermen petitioning the local authorities had in a mere few weeks turned into an unprecedented national crisis that the government was barely able to meet, sending both the Cabinet and the Genrō into a panic. Workers going on strike, coal-miners attacking company property,(2) police stations being attacked with incendiary bombs, all while looting and rioting continued unabated seemed less like a peasant food riot of old and more like a prelude to bloody revolution. With events in Russia and Europe going as they were, the authorities could take no chances: the army was mobilized and sent to reinforce the police, suppressing the riots and resulting in the arrest of over 25,000 people.(3) Amongst those arrested were the leaders of the Socialist Party, men like Ōsugi Sakae, Arahata Kanson and Yamakawa Hitoshi, who had played no part in the disturbances but were suspect due to their “subversive and dangerous ideology”, as well as a disproportionate number of Burakumin, who were made scapegoats. (4)\n\nFurther violence was prevented by donations of millions of yen from the Government, the Imperial Household and industrial conglomerates such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, used to purchase sacks of rice that were to be distributed amongst the protesters. Cheap rice was also imported from overseas, as had been done during the 1890 Food crisis –using Japan’s colonies this time-, keeping prices low through the early 1920s, albeit with the unintended effect of depressing the income of Japanese farmers for decades to come.\n\nThe crisis was nevertheless over, as was the Tokugawa Cabinet. On September 30th of 1918, Prince Tokugawa Iesato and his cabinet tendered their resignations.\n\nIII\n\nWhat followed the downfall of the Tokugawa Cabinet was the usual political dance between the Grand Old Men of the Empire, the autocratic Yamagata on one side and the liberal Saionji on the other. Except that this time was different: with the death of three of their members in the past few years –Inoue Kaoru, Katsura Tarō and Ōyama Iwao -, and the precipitous collapse of the Prince Tokugawa’s Transcendental Cabinet, meant to gather all the talents and virtue of the time and forestall the invasion of the new bureaucrats, the constitutional parties and the dreaded “Party Cabinet”, the remaining elders felt that their time was coming to an end and that the inevitable had finally come. They could no longer hide behind the nobility and the army, and were thus forced to summon the constitutional parties, and their commoner leaders.\n\nHara Takashi was, at the age of 62, a man of many firsts. Charged with forming a government by his old mentor, Prince Saionji Kinmochi, Hara was Japan’s first commoner Prime Minister, as well as the first Prime Minister to be an elected Member of Parliament rather than a grandee, a bureaucrat or a soldier, leading the country’s first party cabinet. (5) That he was both Prime Minister and leading the largest party in the legislature as part of said body was also a rarity in those times. Befitting its status as a watershed moment in Japanese history, the advent of the Hara Cabinet would bring about a great deal of changes and innovations, the foundations of a New Japan, and preside over some of Japan’s most critical moments.\n\nIV\n\nExhausted and broken, Germany surrendered on November, a mere month after the fall of the Tokugawa Cabinet. The mighty Empire that had served as an inspiration for the elites of Japan and even the Meiji Constitution of 1890, was no more, its armies retreating, its people revolting, its Kaiser in exile. The blow, such as it was, was softened by the “victory” celebrations with which the government greeted the returning heroes, and the need to face the more immediate problems caused by the war. Chiefly amongst them was Russia, savaged by the forces of bloody revolution and a bloodier Civil War.\n\nFor Japan, the collapse of the Russian Empire meant far more than that of Germany, as it opened up more immediate venues to exploit and the possibility of correcting the mistakes of Portsmouth,(6) finally allowing for the creation of a proper sphere of influence in the former Russian Far East. The main hurdle was, uncharacteristically enough, the government’s slow response to unfolding events, and its inability to properly judge the circumstances. Marred by the malaise of a never-ending war and fiercely committed to maintain the war effort in Europe, the Japanese had lost an opportunity that was nevertheless quickly seized by the Chinese. While the Japanese remained steadfast and committed more men and resources to the European front, the Chinese quietly disengaged and repatriated their soldiers, only for them to be redeployed along the Amur River. By March of 1918, just as the Japanese Expeditionary Force suffered the first advances of the German Spring Offensive, the Chinese Imperial Army entered Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk. (7)\n\nThe decision to send the first contingent to Vladivostok, already under Chinese occupation, as part of a multinational effort to intervene in the Russian Civil War on behalf of the White Forces, was the subject of much debate in the Diet and in the Government in general. While the Army Ministry and the General Staff seemed eager for an intervention, which they saw as a perfect chance to both increase their own influence and get rid of the Russian threat in one fell swoop, the public was generally opposed to the idea of yet another costly military adventure just as they were still in the midst of suffering through one. The Tokugawa Cabinet was, on the other hand, bitterly divided, as was the Diet, but in the end the Prime Minister was overcome by the need to both honor Japan’s alliances and protect her interests, as well as her “rightful place in the world.” A contingent of troops from the 13th Division, the “Mirror Division”, under General Nishikawa Torajirō, was deployed on July 21st, just as the Rice Riots were beginning in earnest. By the end of the operation, up to 12,000 Japanese soldiers would be deployed to Siberia.\n\nA propaganda lithograph depicting Japanese troops in Vladivostok.​\n\nThe Tokugawa Cabinet’s replacement with that of Hara Takashi didn’t mark a departure regarding the policies involving Siberia, despite Hara’s reluctance to send troops to the place, but it did mean a change of pace and focus. Unwilling to embark on a ground war with nearly 50,000 troops still in Europe and the smoke of the Rice Riots still hovering in the air, the Prime Minister instead chose a path down with what would become the cornerstone of Japan’s foreign policy in the 1920s, the spirit of International Cooperation.\n\nOn March of 1919, Hara Takashi met with Tang Shaoyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Liang Qichaos’ government. The Chinese, having taken a leading role in the Russian war over the past year, had begun considering the option of setting up a puppet state in Eastern Siberia, under the rule of the man they had installed as leader of the White Forces in Siberia, a faithful servant of the Qian Dynasty.(8) But for the project to succeed, tacit approval was required from Japan, which also had strategic interests in the region. The Tang-Hara Agreement of 1919, the first and most influential example of the Sino-Japanese Cooperation that would come to characterize the relations between the two empires in the 1920s, effectively carved the region to the liking of Japan and China: in exchange of Japanese approval of the scheme, the Chinese offered recognition of Japan’s sovereignty over the entirety of Sakhalin —at that point divided between Russian and Japanese zones at the 50° parallel—, as well as Japanese privileges over the exploitation of Kamchatka’s resources. The right to create an extraterritorial settlement in Petropavlovsk was also demanded and obtained. (9)\n\nThe success of the Tang-Hara Agreement would not only save Japan the trouble of investing itself in a new war and expand Tokyo’s sphere of influence, but it would also shape the nature of Sino-Japanese Relations, and Japanese foreign policy in general, for decades to come. Furthermore, it would offer some interesting contrasts to the results of Japan’s other diplomatic campaign in Paris.\n\nV\n\nThe duty of representing the Empire of Japan at the Paris Peace Conference, where delegates of 27 nations met to decide upon the shape of the post-war world, befell upon the former Prime Minister and statesman -as well as Hara Takashi’s mentor-, the Prince Saionji Kinmochi, who was chosen as head of the delegation. Prince Saionji’s role was, however, mostly symbolic and limited by his ill health and age. The Baron Makino Nobuaki, a former Foreign Minister himself, acted as actual head of the delegation during the negotiations and was accompanied by the Viscount Chinda Sutemi –Ambassador to London-, Matsui Keishirō –Ambassador to Paris- and Ijuin Hikokichi –Ambassador to Rome-, amongst others, for a total of 64 delegates.\n\nThe relatively large size of the delega\n\n6. New Trends ​\n\nWhen on the Magpies' Bridge I see\n\nThe Hoar-frost King has cast\n\nHis sparkling mantle, well I know\n\nThe night is nearly past,\n\nDaylight approaches fast.\n\n-Chū-Nagon Yakamochi\n\nThe Great War had brought Japan economic prosperity and a new standing amongst the nations of the world, but it had also brought many uncertainties and unexpected challenges that needed addressing. The new international order created by the end of the Great War and the treaty of Versailles had given the Japanese a place amongst the Big Six, recognition as a great power in the form of a permanent seat at the council of the League of Nations and the German possessions of the northern Pacific, but it had also revealed the limits of Japan’s relations with the western powers and had left Japanese society wary of further military adventures. Instead, demands for reform and better government became the norm, thus truly beginning what might later be known as the Taishō Democracy. (1)\n\nFor Hara Takashi, who had waited in the sidelines for years for the opportunity to present itself, there was no time to waste: armed with an absolute majority in the Diet’s lower house –and an alliance with the biggest faction in the House of Peers, the Kenkyukai (2)-, blessed with the trust of the surviving Genrō and a good part of the citizenry, the newly appointed Prime Minister sought to implement the long awaited reform program that the Rikken Seiyūkai had avowed for years. The program, embodied in four major policies –the “Fulfilment of National Defense”, the extension of education, the encouragement of industry, the expansion of communications-, represented the Seiyūkai’s “Positive Policy”, aimed at fostering growth and prosperity through large investments in key areas of the economy. Hara Kei’s program of vigorous spending included the construction and expansion of railroads, bridges, highways and port facilities (3), new and expanded educational facilities, heavy investments in the national industry through the Bank of Japan (4), subsidies for the reclamation and improvement of arable land and projects such as the Rice Law of 1921, which created a 200 million yen fund to purchase and sell rice, stabilizing prices and allowing the government to appease both the urban and rural populations, as well as helping the agricultural cooperatives.\n\nThe scope of Hara’s ambitious new path for Japan were not limited to domestic improvements, however: the Hara Cabinet’s “Positive Policy” at home was accompanied by a similarly robust foreign policy, aimed at fostering a new place for Japan in the new international order, a mission that for the Commoner Prime Minister meant rapprochement with Qian China. While the Chinese Revolution and the War had transformed the relation between the two Asian powers from an asymmetrical struggle between great power and an ailing empire into a more conventional competition between two resurgent nations (5), Versailles and the changing winds of the post-war world had convinced many in Tokyo and Nanjing that their interests would be best served working together. Hara Kei’s “New China Policy” was, while divisive and ultimately short-lived, an audacious step, conceived in direct opposition to the idea that Japan’s interests could only be served through the depredation of China in lockstep with the Western Powers. (6) It should be noted, though, that even within the ranks of the Japanese establishment that supported the New China Policy, there were different positions around the matter: while some were ardent Pan-Asianists, such as the Home Minister Gotō Shimpei, aimed at the formation of stronger economic, political and cultural bonds with Qian China based on a racial conception of international relations(7), others were more cynical and hoped to use Japan’s stronger financial position to better influence the young new regime in Nanjing, doing through banks and investments what could not be achieved through the force of arms.\n\nThus, while what many historians have given to calling the “Zenith of Sino-Japanese Relations” is often pointed to have begun at the Paris Peace Conference, during the debate over the Racial Equality Clause, which saw the Chinese and Japanese delegations cooperate towards a mutually beneficial goal with no real coordination or common policy before the conference itself, it would be more accurate to point to the years of the Hara Cabinet as the true beginning of this new relation, which saw the Tang-Hara Agreement of 1919 and the birth of the Asian Development Bank, perhaps the most long-lasting legacy of this brief oasis of cooperation and peace between the two nations.\n\nFirst submitted during the war by the Count Gotō Shinpei during his first tenure as Home Minister under Prince Tokugawa, the proposal revolved around the funding of a new bank meant to channel 100 million yen to Nanjing, the collateral to which would come from the Chinese government monopoly on Opium. Although quietly dismissed when first introduced as the Tokugawa Cabinet found itself more preoccupied with the war effort, the economic boom brought by the very same war had finally given Japan the capacity to compete in the world of international finance. For Gotō Shinpei, a man who had risen through echelons of the Japanese establishment and had become a voice of authority of sorts in the question of the empire, his vision of a close Sino-Japanese economic cooperation was both a genuine cry for an alliance by a man who honestly believed in a world divided between the “Yellow and White races”, and a political ploy meant to reestablish him as a leading voice regarding the “China Question”. And the proposal might have remained that, had it not been for Versailles, the League of Nations, Hara Takashi and the country’s sincere turn to a foreign policy based not on aggression or adventurism, but on the principle of International Cooperation.\n\nReturned to the Home Ministry under Hara, Gotō’s vision had evolved from the mere bank to one of a Sino-Japanese economic alliance that could stand in opposition to the Western Powers. Capitalized by a Japanese investment of 200 yen, the bank would be headed by a Chinese chairman and a Japanese vice-chairman, the Asian Development Bank of 1922 was radically different from its post-war successor, its role as an instrument of Sino-Japanese cooperation ultimately becoming secondary to its role as an instrument of Japanese economic interests, too dependent on political developments in Tokyo and unable to escape its political and fundamentally bilateral nature. Yet, in spite of the first Bank’s eventual problems in the wake of the breakdown of relations between Tokyo and Nanjing in the late 1920s, its creation could still be considered to be the most transcendental policy implemented by Hara Kei and the first major step in the path towards the economic integration of East Asia. The high hopes of both nation was perhaps best illustrated by the men picked to first lead such an institution: Liang Shiyi and Inoue Junnosuke, both men of extensive experience and influence in their respective countries, and at the time agreed as talented officials with still promising careers.\n\nElsewhere, Japan’s interests in East Asia evolved in different ways.\n\nFor the people of Korea, under Japanese occupation for nearly a decade, the end of the war had brought upon new calls for an to the repressive colonial government; January of 1919, in particular, would see two big catalysts for the Korean Independence Movement: the death of the former Emperor Gojong, overthrown and imprisoned by the Japanese since 1907, and the proclamation of Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points and the principle of National self-determination at the Paris Peace Conference. On March 1st of 1919, 33 activists gathered at the Taehwagwan Restaurant in Seoul to read the Korean Declaration of Independence, crafted by one of the movement’s founders, historian Choe Nam-seon. Following the arrest and subsequent manifestations, the whole of the peninsula soon found itself engulfed by what would be the March 1st Movement, also known as the Samil movement. Hundreds of thousands (8) of people were soon on the streets, resulting in an unprecedented crisis for Japan, only comparable to the Rice Riots of the year before. The suppression of the riots, swift and brutal, ended with the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people, and a trail of destruction and resentment.\n\nFaced with such a crisis, Prime Minister Hara was forced to implement a conciliatory policy towards Korea. To accomplish this task, a moderate Navy Admiral, Saitō Makoto, was appointed as Governor-General in replacement of Field Marshal Hasegawa Yoshimichi, the man responsible for the brutal repression of the Korean protests. Amongst the measures implemented, there was a liberalization of the laws of censorship and ownership of newspapers, allowing for some amount of freedom of the press; the replacement of the military police by a civilian force; more leniency in regards to the law was allowed and minor offences were no longer punished by whippings; Japanese teachers and civil officials no longer wearing uniforms nor carrying swords, the abolition or modification of laws regulating burials, slaughtering of animals and peasant markets that interfered with traditional customs; wage increases for Korean government workers, so as to match those of their Japanese counterparts; the elimination of trade barriers between Korea and Japan, the Korean market in turn being open for Japanese investment and trade; and the creation of an advisory council with provincial Korean representation, along with Korean representation in city, country and provincial councils.\n\nThe rapprochement between Japan and Korea was finally consolidated in the marriage of the Korean Crown Prince Euimin with Princess Masako Nashimoto (henceforth known as Yi Bangja, Crown Princess Uimin of Korea), an act that symbolically merged the two royal houses and was followed by a general amnesty for thousands of political prisoners. This was in turn accompanied by the implementation of a “New Cultural Policy”, allowing for a more tolerant and open policy towards Korean cultural activities, which in turn meant the end of the ban on Korean newspapers and publishing (resulting in a boom, with hundreds of popular magazines and specialized papers appearing, as well as Korea's two leading newspapers being established that year: The Choson Ilbo and the Tongo Ilbo) and later the formation of many youth, farmer, intellectual, labor and educational organizations on a local and countrywide level. At the same time, Korea saw investments in infrastructure and the immense growth of the civilian police grew immensely under Saitō and his two main collaborators: Mizuno Rentarō, who had oversaw the suppression of the Rice Riots, and the Director of Police Affairs in Korea, Maruyama Tsurukichi. (9)\n\nJapan’s carrot and stick policy towards Korea was not without its limits, however, and it was ultimately unable to truly root out and put an end to the nascent Korean Independence Movement. The most damaging failure of the new Korean policy was perhaps the Crown Prince Incident of 1919, in which the Provisional Government of Korea was able to orchestrate the escape of Yi Kang, the Prince Imperial Uihwa, to Shanghai, bringing about a political embarrassment for both Japan and China, nearly putting an end to their attempts of détente. (10)\n\nBut while Korea underwent a political and cultural reprieve of sorts, and the always favored “model colony” of Formosa continued to be assimilated, Japan’s new possessions to the north, awarded by a gentlemen’s agreement with China, existed in a different plane altogether: underpopulated and distant from the central government in Tokyo, Kamchatka and Karafuto stood in stark contrast from Japan’s other recent acquisitions in the Pacific, the warmer and more strategically placed islands grouped under the South Pacific Mandate. What the southern islands lacked in terms of population, markets and resources they made up with its strategic value and location dominating vital sea lanes across the Pacific Ocean, becoming the home of several Imperial Navy bases.\n\nPetropavlovsk in 1920.​\n\nKarafuto and Kamchatka’s value, on the other hand, was in their natural resources and possibilities for industry: while the first allowed for fishing, forestry, agriculture and the extraction of coal and oil, while boasting a well-developed paper and charcoal production industries, the later would prove to be a bountiful source of natural resources including coal, gold, mica, pyrites, and natural gas. Enticed by the possibilities that the new northern territories offered, the imperial government worked fast to integrate them economically and politically: in 1920, Karafuto was officially recognized an external territory of Japan, whereas the protectorate over Kamchatka –officially limited to the enclave at Petropavlovsk and its environs - was declared a “Special Administrative Region”, both being placed under the aegis of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Investments soon came in the form of infrastructure, the construction and expansion of roads, ports and railway lines and the first programs encouraging migration to the new territories.\n\nYet, while abroad Japan seemed to grow, at home the reform program espoused by the Seiyūkai government was beginning to lose steam and show its shortcomings. The post-war inflation and growing debt incurred during the first years of the Hara Cabinet had taken their toll on the economy, whereas accusations of corruption, bribery and cronyism regarding the public works program and infrastructure spending undertaken by the government had slowly eroded the people’s confidence in the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The biggest source of controversy for Hara was, however, the constant and ever-growing calls for Universal Male Suffrage. Standing against Hara were the student and labor organizations, traditional enemies of the conservative Prime Minister, this time aided by the opposition parties and major newspapers.\n\nFor Hara Kei, who depended on the support of the conservative and reactionary elements in the House of Peers, the Genrō and the Armed Forces to govern and was personally opposed to granting the country Universal Suffrage, the issue threatened to engulf him and his government. Whereas his 1919 revision of the electoral system had allowed him to expand the suffrage in a way that allowed the Seiyūkai’s conservative rural base to expand while denying such privilege to the cities, seen as bastions of the opposition parties and the labor movement (11), Hara knew that allowing for Universal Suffrage would seriously damper his party’s electoral base and ability to rule, while strengthening the opposition parties, such as the Kenseikai. This cynical use of the electoral law, as well as gerrymandering of districts and use of public works projects to benefit certain districts over others for political gain would later prompt a historian to famously note that while Hara’s predecessor as party leader, Hoshi Tōru had bribed individual members of the diet, Hara bribed the electoral system itself.\"\n\nThe final crisis would come in the winter of 1921-1922, in the form of the Washington Naval Conference and subsequent Treaty, signed on February of 1922. One of the triumphs of the policy of International Cooperation and the Disarmament Movement for many, to others it was a betrayal: to accept the conditions imposed by the West and limit the construction of ships and size of the Imperial Navy was not only an unnecessary, humiliating submission to the West, but it also endangered Japan in the long term, leaving the country weakened and exposed. The construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers was to be limited, the tonnage and power of the ships limited as well, and ultimately an arms race was averted. Ultimately, the Hara Government’s commitment to the principles of international peace and cooperation, as well as the reduction of military spending in peacetime, came with the price of fracture: the Washington Treaty proved divisive for the public, for the government and for the Imperial Navy. (12)\n\nUnder attack from both the left and the right, the parties and the labor movements, the ultranationalists and archconservatives and radical militarists, it became doubtful that the Hara Cabinet could see the next summer. Just to what degree dissensions within the Imperial Navy and the ruling Rikken Seiyūkai threatened the actual stability of the government remains a mystery, although those opposing the Washington Naval Treaty always remained a, albeit very vocal and vigorous, minority. Similarly, it has never been proven that the more conservative elements threatened to withdraw their support in the fear that that pragmatic Hara would cave in and join the Universal Suffrage Movement. The most accepted and persuasive theory remains that Hara chose to resign acting upon the advice of his old colleague, the statesman Ozaki Yukio. On June 2nd of 1922, came to an end the government of the first Commoner Prime Minister.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Others will nevertheless point to the Election Law of 1925 as the “true” beginnings of Taishō Democracy.\n\n2. The Kenkyukai, or Study Association, was the dominant faction in the House of Peers, which could not officially be affiliated with any political party.\n\n3. Especially in key districts where a Seiyūkai victory would be helpful in expanding the Parliamentary majority\n\n4. During this period, the government was known to actively interfere in the economy through the flow of capital and protectionist policies. When the Silk-reeling industry formed the Imperial Silk Filature Company as a cartel to buy up and freeze surplus raw silk, so as to support silk prices, the government provided huge loans. There were also cases of large companies borrowing low-interest funds indirectly from the Bank of Japan at times of crisis.\n\n5. By the beginning of the war, China’s textile industries had begun to overtake Japan’s in its domestic markets, which represented a large percentage of Japan’s exports, and by the end of the war the two were in direct competition over various foreign markets.\n\n6. Or in detriment of them.\n\n7. This conception of a world divided between White and Yellow Races was not uncommon amongst many in the higher echelons of government, it being a component in the decision-making process behind the country’s policy towards Europe, the Great War and China.\n\n8. Numbers vary. According to Japanese police reports, 587,641 people participated in the mobilizations between March 1st and May 1st, with 26,713 arrested, 553 killed and 1,409 injured. Korean sources put the estimates around 2 million participants in 1,500 demonstrations, with 7,509 people killed, 15,849 wounded, and 46,303 arrested.\n\n9. The roles of Mizuno Rentarō and Maruyama Tsurukichi cannot be overstated, as they played a vital part in the reorganization of the security apparatus in Korea, part that they would later play at a larger scale in Japan.\n\n10. The Prince’s exile in the Shanghai International Settlement between 1919 and 1935 nevertheless became a point of contention between Nanjing, Tokyo and the various western powers on occasion, and even when the Qian government moved closer to the Korean Provisional Government in the late 1920s, they refused to allow the Korean Crown Prince entrance into Chinese soil.\n\n11. When the electoral system was revised in 1919, enfranchising those who paid a minimum of three yen in direct national taxes, the proportional increase in voters was much greater in the rural areas than in the cities,\n\n12. The division between the Treaty Faction, which supported the government and the ratification of the Washington Treaty, and the Fleet Faction, which opposed it, would come to define the inner struggle of the Imperial Navy and its relation with the civilian authorities for the rest of the 1920s.\n\nUpdate time!\n\n7. When the Rain of Grief Comes…​\n\nSoon after\n\nI wonder now, when was it?\n\na great shake\n\nshook the earth.\n\nThis too was\n\nA terrible event\n\nMountains fell\n\nAnd filled the rivers.\n\nThe seas heaved\n\nAnd flooded the land.\n\nThe earth itself split\n\nAnd water gushed out.\n\nGiants rocks cracked\n\nAnd rolled down\n\nIn the valleys\n\nBoats along the shore\n\nWere helpless in the waves\n\nHorses on the street\n\nStumbled as they walked\n\nAround the capital\n\nNo temple or pagoda\n\nRemained intact.\n\n-Kamo no Chōmei\n\nFew things in early 20th century Japan could counter or prevail over the word of the Genrō, that unofficial and unelected council of elder statesmen that served as advisors to the emperor and represented the last remnant of the old Meiji Oligarchy. Their influence had been many a time the decisive factor behind the greatest changes that had befallen Japan for the past three decades, and the presence of a sickly, meek monarch such as the Emperor Taishō might have made them the ultimate authority in the Empire had it not been for the unkindness of time: by the spring of 1922, several deaths had robbed them of their most outspoken and influential members (1), leaving only two of the grand old men behind: the Prince Matsukata Masayoshi, who had briefly served as Prime Minister and 15 years as Finance Minister, and the Prince Saionji Kinmochi, leader of the Liberal faction within the government and one of the founders of the Rikken Seiyūkai. (2)\n\nFor Saionji, who had been a long-time proponent of party cabinets and civilian rule over that of the military and the aristocracy, his protégé’s resignation had come as a blow, albeit one that did not prevent him from finding a successor in Baron Den Kenjirō, an able administrator and old associate of Field Marshal Yamagata, currently serving as Governor-General of Taiwan. Given the difficult mission of presiding over a new government in the face of growing public discontent and a remaining Seiyūkai majority in the House of Representatives, the new Prime Minister chose not to return to his old party –even after being offered the position of party leader- and instead hope to appeal to all parties in the Diet and society at large through a non-partisan “Transcendental Cabinet”.\n\nAlthough often forgotten, and despite facing many mounting problems at the time, the Den Cabinet was able to rebuild the government’s image in the minds of the public by presenting the face of a clean, efficient administration (3), and was able to pass some much-needed reforms, including the introduction of a jury system in the trial for serious offenses, an innovation that the Seiyūkai had advocated since 1910, and the creation of a committee to study the question of Universal Suffrage in late 1922. (4) These little accomplishments would ultimately be forgotten however, paling in comparison to the greatest natural disaster to strike Japan in the 20th century.\n\nThe Great Kantō Earthquake, as it is known to history, the deadliest and most destructive earthquake in Japan’s history, struck the Kantō Plain at 11:58 a.m. on Saturday, September 1st of 1923. For nearly four minutes the Tokyo-Yokohama region felt the strength of one of the most powerful tremors in Japanese history (5), a force that did not only devastate the capital and the port of Yokohama, but also the prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka and causing widespread damage throughout the Kantō region. Unparalleled in its horror, the disaster struck with the power of the four elements: the quake itself was soon followed by large fires that turned to firestorms (6) which engulfed large parts of Tokyo; in turn, a typhoon struck the coast north of Tokyo, further spreading the fires and destruction (7); landslides also followed, burying and killing many, and finally, a tsunami struck the coast of Sagami Bay and the Bōsō Peninsula. Altogether, nearly 140,000 people had died as a result of the quake, 40,000 had gone missing and more than half a million homes were destroyed, leaving nearly two million people homeless. (8)\n\nAftermath of the Kanto earthquake.​\n\nMaking matter worse, the Earthquake was followed by riots and repressive actions in which the local Chinese and Korean communities were targeted, as were Labor unions, Socialist, Anarchists and Communists, with a great number of arrest and some dead, caused by the security apparatus and self-appointed vigilante groups. Martial Law had to be implemented by the Home Ministry and the Imperial Army was brought to the Capital and the surrounding areas in order to restore order and help with the relief efforts.\n\nSpearheaded by the Home Minister, Gotō Shinpei, and the Prime Minister himself, the reconstruction of Tokyo became not only Den Kenjirō’s priority, but also his most lasting legacy: seven years, 82 million yen and the hard work of tens of thousands under the decisive leadership of these two men (9) meant that not only the Imperial Capital would remain where it stood (10), but also that it would stand stronger and safer.\n\nYet, in spite of his many successes and commendable handling of the Earthquake crisis, Den Kenjirō’s Transcendental Cabinet was in the end short-lived: intra-party rivalries in the Diet’s lower house over budgetary concerns and the financing of the reconstruction program threatened to destabilize the government. While previously the Seiyūkai, which had always promoted a “positive policy” aimed at development and progress through massive spending- and the Kenseikai -which argued for a balanced budget and more conservative spending-, had been able to cooperate and support the “Earthquake Cabinet”, the balance of power between the constitutional parties had shifted in the aftermath of the General Elections held in January of 1924, which saw the Seiyūkai majority reduced and its rival’s numbers improved. The worst of the crisis having already passed and not wishing to hamper the reconstruction projects, Den Kenjirō resigned on February 20th.\n\nAs a replacement, Prince Saionji picked Uchida Kōsai, who had been serving as Foreign Minister under Hara and Den, with the hopes that the Transcendental Cabinet could be maintained and the petty squabbles between the constitutional parties could be overcome. Unfortunately, both Hara Kei’s Seiyūkai and Katō Kōmei’s Kenseikai were incensed by Uchida’s ministerial candidates, drawn exclusively from political independents and the House of Peers, and thus saw an opportunity to refuse any collaboration with the new “Cabinet of Peers.”\n\nOn August of 1924, a third man was given the responsibility of forming a government: Admiral Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, who had previously held the post between 1913 and 1915. Still a respected and well-regarded figure at the age of 72, Admiral Yamamoto was able to draw some measure of support from the Diet by appealing to the Seiyūkai leadership, with which he still maintained good relations from his previous tenure as Prime Minister –despite its ultimate downfall-, and by bringing Inukai Tsuyoshi, leader of the minority Reform Club, to the Cabinet, the only of the three major party leaders to accept his invitation. (11)\n\nAdmiral Yamamoto’s Transcendental Cabinet, the third 1924 had seen, was inherently weak and essentially a hostage to the whims of the three constitutional parties, but was able to function well as long as the three major parties in the Diet remained disunited and fractious. Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, though, the situation could only continue for so long, and ultimately the Yamamoto Cabinet was broken by the same problem that had help bring down Hara and Uchida: the question of Universal Suffrage. While his cabinet included the prominent liberal reformist Inukai Tsuyoshi and could officially count with the support of his party, Yamamoto’s hesitance and seeming reluctance to deliver on a more progressive program finally pushed Inukai to resign on February of 1925 and join the other party leaders in the House of Representatives, Hara and Katō, in agitating against the Transcendental Cabinet and in favor of Universal Manhood Suffrage.\n\nTogether, Hara’s Seiyūkai, Katō’s Kenseikai and Inukai’s Kakushin (Reform) Club controlled 303 seats out of 464 in the Diet’s lower house, more than enough to force the Yamamoto’s hand, or that of any other Prime Minister appointed by Imperial Command. Soon the Alliance of the Three Constitutional Parties, brought together by a combination of circumstance, necessity and a certain degree of cynicism, moved to gather support outside the walls of the Diet, mobilizing both sympathizers and the general public through calls for more democratic reforms and Universal Suffrage. The days and weeks between February and May of 1925 thus saw tens of thousands protesting the Yamamoto Cabinet, their numbers swallowing further as the press, as well as the labor and student movements, flocked to the democratic movement. Surrounded and exhausted, Yamamoto Gonnohyōe finally retired for good on May 4th of 1925, less than a year after having returned to his old office.\n\nFinally, it seemed, the era of Transcendental and Aristocratic Cabinets had ended, and a more democratic Japan could be born, but a question remained for the victorious three parties: who could lead the government that was to lead the way into this new era? At first, a compromise between the Three Parties guaranteed their support for a coalition cabinet led by Inukai Tsuyoshi, who as an elderly and highly regarded statesman, -as well as leader of the smallest party in the alliance (12)-, would lead a transitional government that could implement the new suffrage laws and then call for new elections. This compromise was nevertheless met with strong resistance from the Imperial Court and House of Peers, along with many within the business community and the national press: Japan was in a need of stable, steady and lasting leadership, it was argued, and boasting six Prime Ministers in less than three years was needlessly destabilizing and dangerous. Facing mounting pressure from opposite directions and having only limited time, a new consensus was reached: Hara Takashi, whose Seiyūkai Party was the largest party within the coalition and who was –for the Genrō and the Imperial Court, at any rate- the least objectionable of the three main party leaders, was to return to the Premiership and lead a Grand Coalition. Thus was born the Goken Sampa Naikaku, the “Cabinet supported by the Three Constitutional Parties.”\n\nThus, 18 months of political and economic uncertainty came to an end.\n\nHara Kei’s second administration was, despite the unruly and fractious nature of the coalition upon which it was built, still able to pass several pieces of landmark legislation, including the much awaited General Election Law of 1925, which finally delivered on the promise of Universal Manhood Suffrage by extending the right to vote to all males aged 25 and over, and the controversial Peace Preservation Law. (13) Enacted just days before its companion piece, the Peace Preservation Law of 1925 was crafted with a very clear intent in mind: the suppression of all potentially subversive actions against the state, especially those related to the threats of socialism, communism or anarchism.\n\n\"Anyone who has formed an association with altering the kokutai, or the system of private property, and anyone who has joined such an association with full knowledge of its object, shall be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding ten years.\"\n\nThe vague language and the use of the term Kokutai (national body/structure), a similarly vague and highly subjective word, meant not only that the government was given ample freedom to interpret the law and even ampler powers to implement it, but also that the Law’s effects would be far more important and wide-ranging than even Hara could have anticipated. For the time being, though, the law was used to great effect in monitoring the activities of labor and student organizations, suppressing alleged radical organizations and justifying the imprisonment of thousands of political dissidents, all in the name of peace.\n\nThe Hara Cabinet’s efforts to stamp out all dissent and yet try and deliver upon its promises of reform and efficient government nevertheless keep the government’s attention from another brewing storm: the Taishō Financial Crisis of 1927.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The Prince Ōyama Iwao and the Marquis Inoue Kaoru had died in 1915 and 1916 respectively, whereas Field Marshal Prince Yamagata Aritomo, leader of the reactionary faction within the nobility and the armed forces, passed away in February of 1922, just months before Hara’s resignation;\n\n2. The Rikken Seiyūkai had been founded by another of the Genrō, Ito Hirobumi, who had been Saionji’s mentor much as Saionji was Hara’s.\n\n3. Den Kenjirō’s fiscal policy, while less expansionist than Hara’s, still invested heavily in areas such as ports and water control, albeit with less cynical methods and purposes than those of his predecessor.\n\n4. Den Kenjirō is also credited with continuing with Hara Takashi’s policy of liberalizing reforms in Korea and Taiwan, as well as the continued cooperation with China and the fostering of economic and infrastructural development in Kamchatka and Karafuto.\n\n5. The Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923 had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Moment magnitude scale (Mw), surpassing the 7.0 of the 1855 Edo Earthquake.\n\n6. As the Earthquake struck near lunchtime, when many people were cooking meals for lunch over fire, creating perfect conditions for such an occurrence.\n\n7. The respected meteorologist C.F. Brooks theorized at the time that the Great Kantō Quake may have been triggered by the Typhoon itself. The Typhoon, Brooks speculated, might have brought with it unusually low atmospheric pressure, thus allowing a bulge of water to form where the pressure was lowest, adding a net 7 tons of pressure to the sea floor below, perhaps pushing an already stressed fault line to a breaking point, trigging the earthquake.\n\n8. Anti-Korean sentiment ran high at the time, and many either saw the opportunity to vent old frustrations towards the immigrant communities or were swayed by widespread rumors about Korean and Chinese sabotage and vandalism. Hundreds of Koreans and Chinese, amongst other ethnic minorities, were targeted in race riots and killed, thousands being placed under military custody in an attempt to prevent further violence.\n\n9. The reconstruction effort was largely done under the Imperial Capital Reconstruction Agency, created directly under the cabinet and headed by Gotō himself, who also secured the passing of a Special City Planning Act and a reconstruction budget of 46.8 million yen; the main projects undertaken by the agency involved land readjustments that provided roads, bridges, parks and neatly designed blocs and lots on the destroyed land.\n\n10. In the aftermath of the quake, the need for a “New Capital” was seriously discussed, but quickly died down due to opposition from the cabinet, mainly from Home Minister Gotō Shinpei, who would declare that “The seat of the Emperor should not be moved from Tokyo.”\n\n11. The other two leaders, Hara Takashi of the Seiyūkai and Kato Kōmei of the Kenseikai, remained committed to their strategy of lending official support to any non-party cabinet, despite supporting the occasional law or measure.\n\n12. At the time, Inukai’s Reform Club only held 31 seats in the House of Representatives, opposed to the Seiyūkai’s 152 and the Kenseikai’s 120.\n\n13. These two laws, voted with only a few days between each other, were passed as a compromise between the two largest parties in the ruling coalition, the Kenseikai, the biggest proponent of Universal Suffrage for the past decade, and the Seiyūkai, which under Hara strongly opposed organized labor and hoped to use expand the power of the state to suppress all dissent.\n\n8. The End of Summer​\n\nAfter the storm\n\nOn Mount Mimuro,\n\nThe colored leaves\n\nFloat like brocade\n\nOn the river Tatsuta\n\n-Monk Noin\n\nThe myth of the 1920s as a decade of peace and prosperity took many names and forms across the world: Golden twenties, Roaring twenties, the happy twenties. For Japan those happy years would with time be known as those of the Taishō Democracy, a name that, as it happened with the Weimar Republic, would in turn come to evoke the image of an idealistic but fragile democratic experiment and, an unfortunately short-lived interlude between autocracies. Unlike the Weimar Republic’s dramatic birth in the aftermath of a bloody revolution and an even bloodier war, the democratic reforms of the Taishō reign were only attained slowly and gradually, after much struggle against the old establishment and autocratic elements within Japan’s government and society. And yet, there was still another trait shared between the two countries: the systemic fragility of their institutions, and their economy.\n\nAs early as 1920, when a sudden collapse of share prices in the Tokyo Stock Exchange resulting in a drastic fall of commodity prices and a full-blown financial crisis wiped out the profits earned during the Great War (1), it had become clear that the foundations of Japan’s economy and its financial institutions rested on shaky ground. As a side-effect of the wartime boon, unsound businesses supported by second and third-rate banking houses proliferated, creating a highly speculative investment boom that would ultimately result in the Taishō Financial Crisis of 1927. The Panic of 1920 had allowed the government and people of Japan to take a glimpse at the economy’s weakness and the threat that speculation entailed, but instead of taking heed of the omen, the government saved the failing businesses and banks through rescue lending, averting a disaster but unwittingly planting the seeds for a bigger one to come.\n\nAs the Japanese industry failed to rationalize as fast as that of Europe and the competitiveness of Japanese firms decreased, competition with China mounted and the speculative bubble grew. The Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923 contributed to the slow burning fire by destroying hundreds of banking offices in the Tokyo area, destroying much of the Imperial capital and causing a small depression. First by issuing a moratorium allowing for the deferment for one month of repayment of borrowed money, and then by allowing the Bank of Japan and the national government to issue special emergency loans to the banks in face of their inability to settle any bill discounted before the earthquake, (2) the Den Cabinet’s response followed the precedent of 1920 in staving off the worst effects of the crisis but in the end only postponing the final crisis. Finally, when in the spring 1927 the Goken Sanpa Naikaku Cabinet under Hara Kei attempted to facilitate the final disposition of the bad debts by issuing bonds to the overextended banks that could be exchanged with the Earthquake Casualty Bills, rumors spread regarding the banks holding the bonds would go bankrupt, setting off a financial panic. The bank run that followed resulted in the closing of 25 banks in less than two months, and directly threatened the Bank of Taiwan and the Bank of Japan. (3)\n\nThe Hara Cabinet, finding itself in dire straits, appealed to desperate measures: decreeing a three-week bank holiday and the issuance of emergency loans to save the Bank of Taiwan in the wake of impending collapse. Even as smaller financial and industrial firms such as the Suzuki Shoten went under, the coalition government managed to save the most important financial institutions. It was nevertheless too late to prevent the crisis from having its toll on Japan’s economy. Despite his efforts to contain the worst of the crisis, Hara Takashi, as head of a government whose reckless spending practices had created much of the conditions that led to the crisis and a fractious cabinet bitterly divided over economic policy, was forced to resign in order to keep the Three-Party Coalition in place. Thus, Prime Minister Hara resigned on May 3rd, to be replaced by the Count Katō Takaaki –also known as Katō Kōmei-, leader of the Kenseikai and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet of the Three Parties.\n\nKatō Kōmei, given the dual tasks of guiding the nation through a severe economic crisis and keeping a divided cabinet of strong and independent personalities such as Hara and Inukai afloat, performed to the best of his capabilities, immediately resorting to drastic reforms of the financial system and committing to what had been a long-standing goal of his party, the Kenseikai: to reduce and rationalize government spending, and to create a balanced budget. The Katō Cabinet -in contrast to its predecessor, guided by the Seiyūkai belief of “Positive Spending”-, pursued a policy of financial retrenchment, particularly when it came to military expenditures. The measures, primarily undertaken through the efforts of Finance Minister Hamaguchi Osachi, promoted the curtailing of military expenditures,(4) the rationalization of industry and most controversially, the amalgamation of banks, which would through the following years led to a concentration of power in five zaibatsu banks: Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumimoto, Yasuda and Daiichi. (5) The closeness between the national government and the financial interests was perhaps best illustrated in the rise of Katō Kōmei himself to the premiership, as the man was known for his ties with the Mitsubishi zaibatsu, a relation that many credit as the reason behind his long tenure as leader of the Rikken Kenseikai. The creation of a banking oligopoly throughout the late half of the 1920s and the early 1930s was in turn mirrored by a similar phenomenon in other industries, as the zaibatsu came to monopolize financial, industrial and even political power in Japan.\n\nThe reforms of the Katō Cabinet were in turn followed by an equivalent effort on the domestic front, resulting in further clashes with the entrenched interests of both its political partners and rivals: an electoral law replacing the small constituencies created by the first Hara Cabinet in 1919 with medium-sized electoral districts of three, four or five representatives each caused some friction with the majority factions of the Seiyūkai party, but was nevertheless passed with support of Inukai Tsuyoshi and a minority faction of Hara’s party, which would soon afterwards become the True Seiyū Party. Even more problematic was the decision to downsize the Imperial Army, which entailed the elimination of 4 out of its 21 divisions and the retirement of about 2,000 officers –some of whom, nevertheless, would find employment in the military training programs which were being instituted in schools and universities-, born out of commitment to the principles of asserting civilian influence over the military and cutting expenditure. The aggressive campaign to cut such expenditure was largely seen as a sign of the decline of the army’s power and status. The government’s commitment to disarmament and cutting military expenditure in general, as well as its continuance of a policy of “cooperative diplomacy” that had been the norm for the Japanese foreign policy, and its China policy in particular,(6) led to widespread discontent amongst certain circles within the Armed Forces and Japanese Society. Foreign Minister Shidehara’s conciliatory policy towards China and the Soviet Union, were specially seen as renunciations of Japan’s rightful place in the international stage as a great power, and in China’s case, an unnecessary appeasement to a country that was usurping Japan’s station. (7)\n\nThus, the second half of the 1920s would see a resurgence of Ultra-Nationalism and Militarism, as Far-Right politicians, disgruntled Army and Navy officers, Buddhist extremists, Fascist sympathizers, Imperialists and Nationalist ideologues began to coalesce into secret societies, military cliques (8) and far-right leagues. Figures such as General Araki Sadao, fascist ideologue and author Kita Ikki and radical Buddhist priest Inoue Nisshō gained national prominence and increasing influence, advocating many of the ideas and banners that the old reactionary establishment had upheld in the twilight years of the Meiji Era and were now spreading through Europe: the elimination of democracy and its agents, the corrupt and decadent political parties and its financial backers, the establishment of a strong government (the “European Solution”, as it would come to be termed) that could uphold the national values and spirit of Japan, the expansion of the Armed Forces and the Empire.\n\nWithin the Imperial Japanese Army, the consequences of such a radicalization had especially dire consequences, namely, the division of the officer corps between followers of Araki Sadao and his protégé, General Masaki Jinzaburō, both popular and revered figures amongst the junior officers, which came to be known as the “Imperial Way Faction” (Kōdōha), and those who would be termed the “Control Faction” (Tōseiha).(9) At the core, the rivalry between the two factions was not only political, but philosophical: Araki Sadao’s firm belief in the code of Bushido and its idealization of the “old ways”, those of the pre-industrialized, pre-westernized Japan, were linked to the idea that Japan’s place in the world, stuck between great powers that ultimately surpassed her materially and demographically several times over, meant that no war against them could be won through material means, no matter how careful and thorough the planning or how advanced the technology, and that instead Japan could only prevail through the force of esprit de corps and spiritual training. Thus, while proponents of industrialization and mechanization argued for the need to build a strong centralized state apparatus that could guarantee the acquisition of resources, the foundation of a heavily industrialized economy and the development of new technologies and sophisticated weaponry, the adherent of the “Imperial Way” cried for a return to traditions, for the restoration of the Emperor’s direct rule, for the salvation of Japan’s spirituality, for the purge of the forces corrupting the national spirit, from greedy capitalists to opportunistic politicians.\n\nBut while discontent with the government quietly festered amongst the right, the left had been all but lost for many years: apart from token reforms allowing the labor unions to send delegates to the International Labor Organization –thus implicitly giving them recognition- and repealing an article of the 1900 Peace Law that made conspiracy to strike a criminal offense, the Katō Cabinet’s reformist drive was somewhat less accommodating for the left parties and the organized labor movement than it was to the average citizen. Furthermore, by continuing with the policies established in the Peace Preservation Law of 1925, the Kenseikai government had taken a few steps away from liberal democracy: penalties of up to ten years were in place for those found guilty of conspiring against the Kokutai (“National Body”) or the system of private property, making it possible to punish Communists, Anarchists or other subversives all the more harshly, while also establishing a dangerous precedent by bringing a loaded term formerly relegated to constitutional theory (Kokutai), thus giving currency to a concept which was susceptible of being used not just against its intended victims, but also progressives in general. In the meantime, crackdowns on socialists and communists were being routinely carried by the government, of which the most notorious took place on the April 11th Incident of 1928, in which hundreds of communist and socialist sympathizers were arrested and eventually tried.\n\nThe suppression of elements perceived as dangerous on the left was, almost as in a seesaw effect, accompanied by a multiplication of ultranationalist secret societies and cliques within Japanese society in general and the armed forces in particular. The Kwantung Army and the Imperial Army units stationed in Korea were especially prone to be breeding ground for malcontents, a tendency that became apparent during the brief tenure of General Araki as Commander of the War College in the last years of the decade –and later as Minister of War-.\n\nFurther aiding the perceived notion that Japan was in a dire need for radical change was the death of the emperor Yoshihito on February of 1928, whose posthumous name is also the name of the era coinciding with this reign: Taishō. (10) Unlike the death of the Meiji Emperor in 1912, the demise of the Taishō emperor did not bring about political upheaval and threats of revolution, as the late monarch’s sickly and eccentric nature had meant he always exercised limited political power –often open to the manipulations of the Genrō, the Keeper of the Privy Seal or the Imperial Household Minister-, and by 1922 his deteriorated condition had forced him to abdicate most of his responsibilities in the Crown Prince Hirohito, who thereafter served as regent for his father. Nevertheless, it seemed meaningful that both the beginning and the end of the Taishō period were turbulent times, marked by difficult economic conditions and a growing political crisis. (11)\n\nBeginning in 1927, government officials and zaibatsu businessmen became targets for assassination for both political camps, as the activities of far-left Anarchist or Communist groups, as well as Korean Nationalists –which rumors and nationalist publications spread were in fact founded and controlled by the Chinese intelligence services-, also proved to be a threat during this period. Most prominent was the quick end of Katō Kōmei´s tour to China in the autumn of 1927, cut short after a Korean student tried to take a shot at him in Nanjing. Two weeks later, Korean nationalists were caught trying to plant a bomb in a strategic railway in Japan’s Kwantung Concession. As a result, Anti-Korean and Anti-Chinese sentiment spread like wildfire, but within the Imperial Army and society at large.\n\nMore spectacularly, on September of 1927 radical Buddhist preacher Inoue Nisshō led his Ketsumeidan secret society –infamously known as The League of Blood-, in an assassination plot that targeted liberal politicians and wealthy businessmen in the imperial capital. Twenty victims were chosen, of which only one was killed: Ichiki Otohiko, governor of the Bank of Japan. The failure of the League of Blood Incident as it came to be known to the press and history, nevertheless gave the conspirators a platform and a chance to spout their ideas, taking advantage of the much publicized trial. Just a month later, an officer involved with the Ketsumeidan tried to assassinate Home Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō.\n\nMembers of the Cherry Blossom Society.​\n\nOn May of 1928, Colonel Hashimoto Kingorō and his Sakurakai (Cherry Blossom Society) launched a coup d’état against Katō Kōmei’s government, an event known as the May Incident, involving 120 members of the Sakurakai, ten companies of troops from the Imperial Guards and ten bomber aircraft from the Imperial Japanese Navy. The coup attempt, the most ambitious at the time, was nevertheless caught early due to the doubts of the younger subordinates and Araki Sadao’s own intervention, who despite being a source of inspiration that often lent token ideological support, did not hesitate to disband the group and move the conspirators to different posts. In spite of the much publicized failures, the lenient punishment received in the wake of the May Incident and the attention generated by the League of Blood only came to exacerbate tensions within Japanese society.\n\nBy the end of the year, though, it seemed as if things have returned to normalcy, just in time for one final controversy the 1929 budget. Once again, the Kenseikai argued for restrain and cuts while the Seiyūkai fought for increased spending. Sensing an opportunity after more than 18 months in the shadows, Hara Takashi finally decided to step forwards and retake the reins of government: to undermine Katō, two of the coalition’s Seiyūkai Ministers refused to accept minister Hamaguchi’s new budget, their resignation effectively ending the Three-Factions Coalition. And yet, the ultimate result was that the Kenseikai was the one strengthened by the crisis, as Prince Saionji Kinmochi, last of the Genrō and the man with the Emperor’s ear, took a step that nobody could have expected: by siding with the Prime Minister over his own former protégé, Hara, the minority cabinet was able to stand and both the Seiyūkai and its leaders were gravely undermined.\n\nThe elections were held in February of 1929 and won outright by the Kenseikai and their Seiyū allies, the Seiyū Hontō or True Seiyū Party. After the election, the political scenario was further changed as the Seiyū Hontō defectors of 1928 merged with the Kenseikai to form the Rikken Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) along with other minor constitutional groups in the Diet, whereas across the aisle, Inukai Tsuyoshi decided to disband his own Reform Club and take his faction to the Seiyūkai, where he would maintain his position as senior member.\n\nUltimately, the triumph was short-lived. Just a few months after the elections, on May 9th of 1929, Prime Minister Katō Kōmei was assassinated in Tokyo by an Araki follower, a cadet part of the Young Officers Movement who claimed revenge for the army’s honor. Just a month before, Prince Saionji Kinmochi, the last surviving Genrō and one of the most influential statesmen of the Japanese body politic, as well as one of the last moderate voices close to the Emperor, died of a stroke at the age of 80. Three months later, on August of 1929, Hara Takashi would die at his home at the age of 73. An era in the history of Japan was closing, and a new one was beginning.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. While the average share price fell for more than 50% in three months, commodities were especially affected, silk yarn falling by 75% and cotton yarn by 66%. Soon exports of silk yarn to the United States decreased and credit unrest spread, resulting in runs over 170 banking offices, 21 of which were closed. A Yokohama silk-trading company and its main bank went under, and the whole industry, from silk-yarn merchants to farmers engaged in sericulture, was badly hit.\n\n2. The Bank of Japan extended special emergency loans to banks in the affected Kantō Region in the form of rediscounting earthquake bills. Earthquake bills (commercial bills originating in the designated area affected by the earthquake) would be first taken to banks for \"discounting\" (banks buy the bills from firms and pay cash after subtracting interest between now and the maturity date), allowing for companies to receive immediate liquidity. The banks would in turn take these Earthquake Bills to the Bank of Japan for \"rediscounting\" –the Bank would buy the bills for cash-, and thus banks could get liquidity as well. Using this method, the Bank of Japan tried to inject liquidity and sustain economic activity after the earthquake, and even if many firms failed to settle commercial debt because of earthquake damage, the financial system would not collapse.\n\nDespite being able to temporarily protect the financial market, the Bank of Japan’s policy of indiscriminately rediscounting commercial bills originating in the Kantō region became a way for firms and banks saddled with bad debts –with no relation to the earthquake- to get rid of them at the expense of the Bank and its liquid assets. After two years, only about half of the amount was settled by the issuing company, the rest being the bad debt that, being unrelated to the earthquake, was unredeemable.\n\n3. 35 Banks would ultimately close as a direct result of the Taishō Financial Crisis.\n\n4. Cuts to spending were, nevertheless, never as drastic as those advocated by the Finance Minister, as the Cabinet needed to maintain its coalition with Hara Takashi’s Rikken Seiyūkai, still the biggest party in the House of Representatives, and to avoid overt controversies with the Imperial Armed Forces and their allies in the House of Peers and Privy Council.\n\n5. The number of banks would fall from 1,420 in 1926 to 1,029 in 1928, 782 in 1930 and 538 in 1932.\n\n6. In this regard, nationalist circles in fact misjudged the Katō Cabinet, as in spite of the policy of diplomatic and economic cooperation with China that had been the basis of Sino-Japanese relations for the better part of the last decade, the Prime Minister himself was never particularly friendly towards the Qian government and was rather known (and even criticized by the moderate elements of the government and the press) for his aggressive defense of Japanese economic interests in China and the continent, particularly regarding threats of boycotts and special tariffs that could be perceived as hurting Japan’s firms and exports.\n\n7. Amongst the press and the intellectual classes, a rift was born between those who supported the government’s policy of “Cooperative Diplomacy” and the underlying ideals of Pan-Asianism upon which it was built, and those who severely criticized Tokyo’s China Policy and began to espouse increasingly radical nationalist positions, arguing that China was not an ally, but rather a dangerous rival and even an existential threat, meaning that Japan’s place in the world could only be maintained and expanded at the expense of Qian China. The crisis further exacerbated such feeling, and the belief that the solution to Japan’s economic woes lied in the vast resources of China (Manchuria in particular) and Yakutia and in the elimination of Nanjing as a potential commercial rival, became popular amongst certain circles.\n\n8. Although officially banned by law, secret societies with various but similar agendas and purposes proliferated within the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1920, of which the most prominent were the Futabakai (Double-Leaf Society), which gathered mid-level officers, mostly colonels and majors who had graduated from the Japanese Army Academy between 1907 and 1916 and included Nagata Tetsuzan, Tojo Hideki, and Okabe Naosaburo, and the Issekikai (One Evening Society), which included the likes of Yamahista Tomoyuki, Doihara Kenji and Itagaki Seishirō. Other similar associations included the Mumeikai (Nameless Society), the Mokuyōkai (Thursday Club) and the Gokoku Dōshi Kai (Association of Comrades to Defend the Fatherland).\n\n9. Both the names Kōdōha and Tōseiha were coined by Kōdōha officers, the first to describe themselves, the second to mock their rivals. Tōseiha’s very existence as a rival faction to the Kōdōha clique could also be seen as an invention by the ideologues of the Imperial Way Faction, as the so-called Control Faction didn’t exist as a proper group and never had any sort of centralized leadership beyond unifying figures such as Nagata Tetsuzan, but instead was mostly an informal grouping of officers tenuously linked by common goals and ideology, as well as their opposition to the Kōdōha.\n\n10. By the “One Reign, One Era Name System” instituted during the Meiji Restoration, era names would change only upon imperial succession, whereas before an emperor could reign over many different “eras”.\n\n11. Following the death of the Taishō Emperor, the Shōwa Era was proclaimed, the name meaning “Enlightened Peace.” (Although it could also be read as “period of Japanese glory”)"
