Career highlights:

- 2006 World Championships: Pau Gasol took his National Team Spain to the top of the basketball world. He was the MVP of the tournament and led his team on the way to the first medal of its history.

- Feb. 2008: the Memphis Grizzlies wanted to get rid of Gasol's big contract and the Lakers won the lottery giving in exchange the rustic center Kwame Brown and his expiring contract, a rookie guard Javaris Crittenton and the draft rights of Pau's brother Marc. This way Gasol finally goes out of the shadows of a mediocre NBA team to jump into the bright lights of Los Angeles where his talent can be more appreciated. He also becomes the main reason for Kobe Bryant to stay in Hollywood.

- June 2008: With the addition of Gasol, the Lakers became an instant title candidate, arrived to Finals and despite being demolished by the Celtics, show they have a bright future ahead of them.
