        "text": "Disaster in perú\n\nDisaster in perúMarta Martín\n\nThe document summarizes a major earthquake and tsunami that struck Lima, Peru in 1746. It describes how the earthquake lasted 3-4 minutes and destroyed the city, leaving only 25 houses standing. It is estimated that half of the city's 60,000 inhabitants died in the disaster. The document also provides information about the endangered Andean Mountain Cat, a small wild cat native to the high Andes of Peru. It is classified as endangered with fewer than 2,500 individuals remaining in the wild. Threats to the cat include hunting and loss of habitat.\n\nMan made dissaster and endangered animal ibai unamuno\n\nMan made dissaster and endangered animal ibai unamunoMarta Martín\n\nThe document summarizes information about an oil tanker disaster called the Prestige and an endangered lizard species called the El Hierro Giant Lizard. The Prestige oil tanker split in half off the coast of Spain in 2000, spilling over 76,000 cubic meters of oil. The captain was accused of not cooperating with salvage efforts. The El Hierro Giant Lizard is a wall lizard found on the Canary Island of El Hierro, but is now confined to a few small cliff areas due to habitat loss. Reintroduction efforts have taken place to help the vulnerable species.\n\nMarocco\n\nTan-Tan is an annual gathering in southwest Morocco that brings together over thirty tribes from southern Morocco and northwest Africa. The event was first held in 1963 and celebrates the legacy of Saharawi leader Mohamed Laghdaf, who fought against French and Spanish colonizers for decades and was buried near Tan-Tan after his death in 1960. The gathering is a sporting event that celebrates the nomadic cultures and tribes of the Sahara region.\n\nFamous siblings moreanu tina monica\n\nFamous siblings moreanu tina monicaMarta Martín\n\nGiuliano and Claudiu Stroe are famous siblings who are both gymnasts and compete in bodybuilding competitions.

He was raised in Kenya and South Africa but has British parents and has been a cyclist since 2008.\n\nDisasters anemartin\n\nThe document discusses an earthquake that occurred in Lorca, Spain, killing 9 people including a minor, and an endangered animal, the Iberian lynx. The Iberian lynx lives primarily in Spain and Portugal and feeds mainly on rabbits. It is in danger of extinction due to decreased rabbit populations, destruction of its habitat, and poaching. The earthquake in Lorca registered a magnitude of 5.1 and was preceded by a 4.5 quake, causing damage within 10 km of the city.\n\nAntoine griezmann\n\nTheo Griezmann is Antoine Griezmann's younger brother who is one of Atletico Madrid striker Antoine's most unconditional fans.

Antoine's brother Theo is his number one fan and admires his brother greatly, also liking football and wanting to be like his brother.\n\nIngles project\n\nThe Eurasian lynx is a medium-sized cat native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is the largest lynx species, ranging from 80 to 130 cm long and weighing 18 to 30 kg for males and 8 to 21 kg for females. The main threats to the Eurasian lynx are excessive hunting for its fur and to prevent predation on livestock, as well as the destruction of its natural habitat. The lynx is endangered in parts of Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia, having disappeared from many areas.\n\nNatural disaster in spain\n\nNatural disaster in spainMarta Martín\n\nAn earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 hit Lorca, Spain on May 11, 2011. The shallow quake caused significant damage, killing 9 people and injuring 324. Thousands were left homeless due to the poor condition of their homes after the quake. As of the time of writing, 400 families had not yet returned to their houses. The Cantabrian brown bear population in Spain is endangered, with only around 250 remaining in the country. Listed as endangered since 1973, the bears face threats from hunting and habitat loss. Measuring 1.6-2 meters long, the timid bears mainly live in the Cantabrian Mountains, with 25 residing in the Pyrenees as well.\n\nPau Gasol\n\nPau Gasolteresateacher\n\nPau Gasol is a Catalan basketball player born in Barcelona in 1980.

An organization called The Ocean Cleanup was founded in 2013 to develop extraction technologies to remove plastic already in the oceans and intercept more at rivers, having received over $31.5 million in donations to address this issue threatening wildlife such as the whale found with over 125 plastic items in its body.\n\nIngles\n\nThe document discusses four paintings by three different artists - a self portrait by Picasso from 1901, Munch's 1895 painting \"Pubertad\" depicting a naked girl, and van Gogh's 1888 painting \"Noche estrellada sobre el rodano\" showing two people with the sea and sky in the background. Brief explanations are given for why each painting was chosen, focusing on interests in self portraits, being in puberty, and a preference for sea paintings.\n\nAurkezpen izengabea\n\nThe document provides information on 4 paintings each by Picasso, Munch, and Van Gogh, including the painting name, year, and brief description. For Picasso, one painting from 1934 depicts a girl receiving a lesson and another expressionist work from 1932 shows a female face in repose. Munch's paintings include \"Starry Night\" from 1893 depicting a nighttime view and \"Ashes\" from 1894 telling a story through images. Van Gogh's paintings summarized are \"The Starry Night Over the Rhone\" from 1888 showing a night landscape reflected in water and \"Ballroom in Arles\" from 1888 depicting a crowded ballroom interior.\n\nPaintings\n\nThe document summarizes 3 paintings: 1) La Mujer Que Llora by Picasso from 1937 depicts Dora Maar in rough shapes and colors, expressing suffering before the Spanish civil war. 2) The Dance of Life by Munch from 1899-1900 shows the arc of life through different stages, from youth to old age, and was important for his Frieze of Life project.

Computer Science students affiliated with Alagappa University. This document covers fundamental principles and advanced topics in RDBMS, offering a structured approach to understanding databases in the context of modern computing. PDF content is prepared from the text book Learn Oracle 8I by JOSE A RAMALHO. Key Topics Covered: Main Topic : USERS, Roles and Privileges In Oracle databases, users are individuals or applications that interact with the database. Each user is assigned specific roles, which are collections of privileges that define their access levels and capabilities. Privileges are permissions granted to users or roles, allowing actions like creating tables, executing procedures, or querying data. Properly managing users, roles, and privileges is essential for maintaining security and ensuring that users have appropriate access to database resources, thus supporting effective data management and integrity within the Oracle environment. Sub-Topic : Definition of User, User Creation Commands, Grant Command, Deleting a user, Privileges, System privileges and object privileges, Grant Object Privileges, Viewing a users, Revoke Object Privileges, Creation of Role, Granting privileges and roles to role, View the roles of a user , Deleting a role Target Audience: Final year B.Sc. Computer Science students at Alagappa University seeking a solid foundation in RDBMS principles for academic and practical applications.
