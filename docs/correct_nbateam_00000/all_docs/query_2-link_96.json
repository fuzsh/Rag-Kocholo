        "text": "With a career full of great stories and achievements, Pau Gasol is one of the most important international basketball players. His influence spans the four lines of the court and, no doubt, he will continue to do so for years to come.\n\nPau started playing basketball as a child, with a family that always had the sport very present in their daily lives. Quite influenced by the European style of play, the athlete began to participate in school championships and, despite being a tall player, always sought to guard and be behind the three-point shot line, a fact that made him developa diversified array of skills when compared to traditional centers.\n\nHis first game as a professional took place while he was in high school, right when he signed with CB Cornellà and, soon after, at the age of 16, with FC Barcelona, ​​where he took off! Pau won European championships as a junior and soon moved up the ladder to the main team, sporting great statistics of 12 points and 5 rebounds in just 24 minutes in his final year, becoming one of the youngest stars of the ACB thus fully prepared for a long journey in the NBA.\n\nIn the United States, Pau was picked in 3rd place in the 2001 draft by the Atlanta Hawks and soon after traded to a team that was very interested in him, the Memphis Grizzlies. Newly arrived, he debuted well and won the ROY, which is given to the best rookie of the year, he even became the first non-American athlete to earn such award.\n\nAfter a few years in the team and already with a certain dominance in the league, Pau Gasol was then traded to the the Los Angeles Lakers to team up with Kobe Bryant himself. The duo's relationship has always been very good, willingness and hard work have always been present, leading them to two consecutive titles in the NBA.\n\nPau still had great passages by the Spanish national team, earning two silver medals and one bronze in the Olympics and also the 1st place in the 2006 Basketball World Cup, becoming the MVP of the tournament.\n\nIn his post-Lakers ear, at 34 years of age, he enjoyed good performances during his two seasons in the Chicago Bulls, and also some years in the San Antonio Spurs and others with less expressive statistics in the Milwaukee Bucks and Portland Trail Blazers when his function became more focused as a mentor of young talents."
