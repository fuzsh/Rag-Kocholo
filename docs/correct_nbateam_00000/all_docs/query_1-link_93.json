        "text": "Memphis Grizzlies, American professional basketball team based in Memphis, Tennessee, that plays in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nThe Grizzlies played their first game in 1995 and were originally based in Vancouver as one of the two Canadian expansion franchises (alongside the Toronto Raptors) to join the NBA that year. They were immediately one of the worst teams in the league, winning no more than 19 games in each of their first four seasons and finishing at the bottom of their divisional standings in five of the six years they spent in Vancouver. This prolonged futility took its toll on the Grizzlies’ attendance numbers and profitability, and the team’s ownership moved the franchise to Memphis in 2001 in a bid to increase revenue.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nIn the newly relocated team’s first draft, it added Spanish forward Pau Gasol, who would go on become the Grizzlies’ first all-star player. The team hired basketball icon Jerry West to serve as general manager in 2002. West quickly turned the team’s fortunes around, and in 2003–04 Memphis won 50 games (a 22-win improvement from the previous season) to earn the first play-off berth in franchise history. The Grizzlies lost in their opening postseason series that year and experienced the same fate in both 2004–05 and 2005–06. Memphis’s successful run was short-lived, and the team fell to a last-place finish in 2006–07. West left the Grizzlies in 2007, and Gasol was traded in 2008 as the team began a rebuilding effort."
