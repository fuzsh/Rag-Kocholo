        "text": "The crowd at Memphis’ FedEx Forum was never this lively in any of the games played this season. A year full of devastating and season-ending injuries killed the excitement in Memphis, but do not worry, Marc Gasol is here to cheer the entire city up again. The 13th-seed Grizzlies matched up with the Philadelphia 76ers today, and the seats were filled, only for Marc Gasol, who got his jersey number ’33’ retired after the game. The Spanish center last represented the Grizzlies back in 2019. 5 years later now, he has managed to bring that old spark again. If you are wondering how he pulled this off, here is his brother Paul Gasol to explain the connection.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers great Pau Gasol shared during the press conference, “I think his(Marc) DNA connected really well with the city’s identity. Hard worker. You know, he would give his all to to the team, in every game he competed. I just think he resonated really well with his blue-collar city, and it’s something that I have heard Mike Conley say a lot. I think having two years of high school also connected him more with the city and then because of the trade and his rights kind of being sent to Memphis. He had a great opportunity to be the start of an incredible core.”\n\nMarc Gasol was a part of the Memphis Grizzlies for 11 seasons, out of the 14 seasons he played in the NBA. That’s enough time to create a connection with the people of the city, but there are things beyond time that help in creating a bond. Pau Gasol highlighted it in the above lines.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAlso, this would be the perfect time to showcase the memorable Gasol brothers trade, which helped Marc create a legacy in Memphis.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHow did a trade to the Grizzlies change the Gasol brothers’ NBA careers?\n\nPau Gasol was with the Memphis Grizzlies right before Marc entered the NBA. The young Gasol’s entry into the league not only changed his future but also his older brother’s. After Marc finished his studies in Lausanne Collegiate School, the Los Angeles Lakers drafted him as the 48th pick in the 2007 NBA draft. However, destiny had a different plan. On February 1, 2008, a young Marc’s draft rights were traded by the Lakers to the Grizzlies.\n\nRead more: Marc Gasol Drops Retirement Plan After Lakers Release For Exciting New Venture\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNotably, Pau Gasol was a part of this trade package, which landed him with the Lakers, alongside Kobe Bryant. Well, we all know what happened after this! Pau Gasol won back-to-back championships with the Black Mamba, while Marc Gasol had an impressive start in the NBA with the Grizzlies. More than a decade later now, the Gasol brothers have left a long-lasting impact on the league, and this is an example of how just one trade can change the lives of two people."
