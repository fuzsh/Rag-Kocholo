        "text": "Jim Mone/Associated Press\n\nAll-Star forward Pau Gasol could be on the move prior to Feb. 18's NBA trade deadline, as the Chicago Bulls are reportedly aggressively shopping him.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nKings Reportedly Targeting Gasol\n\nThursday, Feb. 18\n\nMarc Stein of ESPN reported the Kings are still pursuing Gasol as the trade deadline looms.\n\nDavid Aldridge of NBA.com reported that rumors linking Gasol to the Kings are \"being shot down posthaste,\" adding that it \"sounds like they're coming from one direction.\" Earlier in the day, Sam Amick of USA Today reported \"skepticism from [the] Bulls side that a deal will materialize\" with the Sacramento Kings.\n\nOn Wednesday, Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical passed along what he was hearing regarding talks between the two sides:\n\nThe Bulls have discussed deals with multiple NBA teams on Gasol, but one discussion lingered on Wednesday, league sources told The Verticalâ€™s Wojnarowski and Chris Mannix: Gasol and Tony Snell to the Sacramento Kings for Kosta Koufos, Ben McLemore and a lowering of the lottery protections on the 2016 first-round pick that Sacramento owes the Bulls.\n\nLatest on Gasol's Deadline Availability\n\nWednesday, Feb. 17\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the Bulls are interested in moving the 35-year-old Spaniard since he is expected to decline his player option this offseason and become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nHowever, Wojnarowski later reported that Gasol has \"strongly resisted\" the idea of being traded somewhere as a two-month rental, preferring instead to sign an extension with the Bulls.\n\nESPN.com's Brian Windhorst reported that the Bulls are not actively shopping Gasol despite taking some calls regarding his availability.\n\nGasol Tempting Trade Target for Slumping Bulls\n\nGasol is averaging 17 points, 10.9 rebounds and two blocks per game for the Bulls, but the team has fallen off significantly as of late, as a four-game losing streak has it at just 27-25 and in seventh place in the Eastern Conference.\n\nWith Chicago's chances of contending starting to fade, dealing Gasol prior to the deadline rather than potentially losing him for nothing may be the franchise's best course of action.\n\nIn addition to that, trading the six-time All Star and two-time NBA champion could help the Bulls get below the luxury tax, which they are currently $4.5 million over, per K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune.\n\nIt is unclear where Gasol may ultimately land if Chicago decides to deal him, but there promises to be plenty of interest in the former Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Lakers star.\n\nTim Reynolds of the Associated Press believes the Miami Heat could be a potential candidate in acquiring Gasol's services:\n\nDepending on what the Bulls get in return for Gasol in a possible deal, trading him would essentially be an admission that a trip to the NBA Finals in 2016 isn't realistic despite the presence of stars Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose on the roster.\n\nThat would be a tough pill for Bulls fans to swallow considering the team was near the top of the Eastern Conference for much of the early portion of the season.\n\nIf the organization's higher-ups truly don't see a deep playoff run in the Bulls' immediate future, though, trading Gasol to add assets to a talented core is the smartest move for the team moving forward."
