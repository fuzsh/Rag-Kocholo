        "text": "Los Angeles Lakers legend Pau Gasol is having quite the 2023. On March 7th, he is set to have his iconic No. 16 Lakers jersey retired in a ceremony at Crypto.com Arena. And now, the Basketball Hall of Fame has announced that Gasol is a finalist for inclusion into this year's class.\n\nGasol was a six-time All-Star and four-time All-NBA Team honoree during a 21-year pro career, that included 18 NBA seasons. He was traded by the Memphis Grizzlies to your Lakers at the 2008 deadline by then-LA GM Mitch Kupchak. Linking up with All-Star shooting guard Kobe Bryant, and star big men Andrew Bynum and Lamar Odom, Gasol's addition instantly transformed the Lakers into legitimate title contenders. The team finished with a 57-25 record and made it all the way to the 2008 NBA Finals, falling in six to the star-studded Boston Celtics. Bryant was named the 2008 MVP.\n\nLA subsequently went on to appear in two more consecutive NBA Finals series from 2009-2010, winning both. Gasol lingered with Los Angeles through the 2013-14 season, before hopping off to join the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe seven-footer out of Spain holds career averages of 17 points on .507/.368/.753, 9.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.6 blocks per regular season game, and is generally considered to be one of the best international players in the history of the league."
