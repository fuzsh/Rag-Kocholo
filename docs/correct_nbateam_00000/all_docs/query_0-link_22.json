        "text": "Maxwell Ogden@ MaxwellOgdenCorrespondent III\n\nPau Gasol vs. Marc Gasol: Comparing the Brothers' First 4 NBA Seasons\n\n0 of 12\n\nIt's been a long four years since the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in what was once considered the most lopsided trade in recent history. Well, before Chris Paul went to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nFour years later, however, it's clear that the Memphis Grizzlies weren't too dumb after all. Considering only one player from the infamous Gasol swap made the All-Star team in 2012, they actually look pretty damn smart.\n\nThat's because it was Marc, not Pau, who was invited to Orlando.\n\nIt's far too early to debate who the better player is, as Marc's four years of experience pale in comparison to Pau's 11.\n\nWhat can be done, however, is compare the first four years of each Gasol's career.\n\nYear 1: King Pau\n\n1 of 12\n\nIn the first year of Pau's illustrious career, 2001's third overall draft choice outplayed both players taken before him and every player taken after him, winning the Rookie of the Year award behind a surprisingly dominant 17.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game.\n\nWhat may have been most impressive about Gasol's game wasn't a statistic, though—it was his poise.\n\nDespite being traded on draft day and walking into Memphis as the face of a new franchise, Gasol was never fazed.\n\nNot bad for a 20-year-old from Spain.\n\nYear 1: Making His Marc\n\n2 of 12\n\nUnlike brother Pau, who was a Top-5 draft pick, Marc Gasol didn't hear his name come off of the board until the 18th pick...of the second round.\n\nDespite facing expectations of failure, Marc actually outdid his Rookie of the Year brother by shooting a franchise-record 53 percent from the field—breaking Pau's original record.\n\nThat impressive mark was accompanied by 11.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game.\n\nYear 1: Older Brother Knows Best\n\n3 of 12\n\nWhile Marc broke Pau's shooting record, Pau took home the hardware.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's what truly matters when both play for teams who aren't winning.\n\nYear 1 goes to Pau.\n\nYear 2: Pau-Erful Improvements\n\n4 of 12\n\nPau continued to amaze in Year 2, posting averages of 19.0 points a night to go with 8.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.8 blocks.\n\nHe also played in all 82 games, avoiding injury.\n\nUnfortunately, Pau was unable to take the Grizzlies to the playoffs.\n\nDespite an improvement of five wins from the year prior, the Grizzlies finished a dismal 28-54.\n\nYear 2: Major Strides\n\n5 of 12\n\nIn Year 2 of Marc Gasol's career, the improvements were astonishing.\n\nAfter setting the franchise record for shooting percentage as a rookie, he shattered his own mark by shooting 58.1 percent.\n\nHe upped the rest of his numbers across the board, as well, with 14.6 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.0 steals.\n\nHis play was a major reason that the Grizzlies went from 24-58 in 2009 to 40-42 in 2010.\n\nWhile that wasn't good enough to make the playoffs, it was a marginal improvement that was heavily on Gasol's broad shoulders.\n\nYear 2: Don't Forget About Me\n\n6 of 12\n\nWhile Pau Gasol's statistics looked better, it was younger brother Marc who not only improved as an individual, but improved his team as well.\n\nWith improvements across the board, including better rebounding numbers than Pau, Marc takes home the gold for Year 2.\n\nYear 3: Making the Jump\n\n7 of 12\n\nPau Gasol did the unthinkable in his third year, leading the Grizzlies to their first playoff berth in franchise history.\n\nWhile the result was a disappointing 4-0 series loss to the San Antonio Spurs, Pau was the unquestioned leader of that Grizzlies team.\n\nHis individual averages saw a slight decline to 17.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 1.7 blocks, but his overall impact saw a major improvement.\n\nHe will forever live as the first player to lead the Grizzlies to a playoff berth.\n\nYear 3: Winning or Losing?\n\n8 of 12\n\nSo how the hell could Marc Gasol top that?\n\nBrother Pau took the Grizzlies to their first-ever playoff appearance and helped Huby Brown win Coach of the Year.\n\nSo how does Marc top it?\n\nHow's winning the franchise's first-ever playoff series?\n\nThe younger Gasol saw a major decline in individual production, scoring only 11.7 points and grabbing 7.0 rebounds. What he did improve, however, were his assist and block numbers.\n\nHis passing, defensive prowess and ability to step up with Zach Randolph out was invaluable.\n\nGasol will forever live in glory as one of the driving forces in the Grizzlies' first-ever playoff series victory.\n\nYear 4: Pau's Turmoil\n\n9 of 12\n\nAs great as Pau Gasol played in his fourth season, the fact that he missed 26 games due to an injury sure cut the celebration short.\n\nNevertheless, it's worth noting that Gasol improved his ability to score efficiently, going from 48 percent in Year 3 to 51 percent in Year 4.\n\nHe also set a personal record by shooting 77 percent from the line.\n\nUnfortunately, his injury hurt his season drastically.\n\nYear 4: Marc Makes History\n\n10 of 12\n\nYear 4: An All-Star Is Born\n\n11 of 12\n\nWith an All-Star bid and his team competing for consecutive playoff appearances, there's no question about this one.\n\nAll that's left to do is pray for good health and consistency.\n\n4-Year Review: Out with the Old, in with the New\n\n12 of 12\n\nWith three victories for Marc and just one for Pau, Marc Gasol has pulled off the upset and won the early battle of the Gasols!\n\nTo be able to continue those victories, however, Marc still has a long way to go.\n\nMore specifically, he has two championship rings to go...\n\nX"
