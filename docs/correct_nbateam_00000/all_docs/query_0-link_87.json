        "text": "On Monday, January 29, 2024 as the Memphis Grizzlies played the Sacramento Kings, I Produced and or Directed my 4,500 LIVE Sporting Event. As you can see from the pictures, I started my career as a basketball player [the game was really slow because you had to get the ball out of the basket]! It actually started with ABC Sports [thank you Terry O'Neil and Penn State Cross Country and Track and Field Coach Harry Groves - I was not very fast and got cut my sophomore year] and continued through Total Communication Systems, TCS/Metrosports, NEP and on to the World of being a Freelancer working for every major Network. I've travelled the World covering Olympics, Super Bowls, NBA Finals, International and MLS Soccer, NCAA Basketball and Football Championships and have received several of those lovely ladies, Emmys! Thank you to all of my fabulous crews and executives who to this days still think I do a pretty good job! Special thanks to my family! Making a living on the Road is not easy for them especially my fantastic wife Cheryl who has always kept me grounded and is the best preacher of \"Common Sense\" I know. Many more productions to come! I've never worked a day in my life!\n\nHard to believe that these two friends and colleagues represent over 100 years of television production expertise! Always a pleasure to relive the history of sports television! We can actually say that we’ve “seen it all”! Our wish is to pass it on to the next generation. The legend, Doug Freeman along side TV Huet. Never sat on the front row with any better professional, TD, Director or just all around great person! By the way, we both had amazing heads of hair back in the day! LOL!"
