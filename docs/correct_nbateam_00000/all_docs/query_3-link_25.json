        "text": "FC Barcelona\n\nWhen he was 16, Pau Gasol was recruited by the Junior team of FC Barcelona, the club’s training ground for future basketball players, where he was on the Spanish Junior Championship team.\n\nPau quickly became a young star and led FC Barcelona to the European Junior Championship two years later.\n\nDuring the 2000 season, Pau moved up to the first team and starting then he never looked back.\n\nIn the 2001 King’s Cup, and under the attentive gaze of more than 40 NBA talent scouts, Pau turned in a stellar performance. He was MVP of the tournament and led Barcelona to win the Spanish championship (ACB League).\n\nJust six months after securing that starting position with FC Barcelona, and after scoring an average 11.3 points and 5.2 rebounds per game, Pau was selected in the NBA draft. He was the first Spaniard to achieve this at such a young age, and to have done so after such a short time with his club’s senior team.\n\nIn 2021, after 18 seasons in the NBA, Pau returned to Barcelona, the city where he was born and where he began to play professional basketball. In February of 2021 he joined Barça under coach Saras Jasikevicius, who had been a teammate during his first stage with the club. It won the League that year and played in the final of the Euroleague. That same year he announced his retirement from professional basketball.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nPau was selected on the third round of the 2001 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks, who ceded him to the Memphis Grizzlies, where he played six and a half seasons. Pau thus became the first non-US player to be chosen in such an early round of the draft at the time. He still wasn’t yet 21 years old.\n\nHis brilliant first season earned him the NBA 2002 Rookie of the Year award. At the time, he was the only non-American player to do so.\n\nIn 2006, he would be selected for the All-Star Game, the first Spaniard ever to be chosen. In his last season at Memphis, he averaged 20.8 points per game, his highest mark.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nIn February of 2008 he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he formed a great combination with Kobe Bryant, who would later say that Pau was one of the three players he most enjoyed working with in his whole career. At Los Angeles, Pau helped the Lakers to three consecutive NBA finals (2008-10), of which they won two NBA Championships (2009 y 2010). He became the first Spaniard to win an NBA ring, which was immediately followed by a second one.\n\nDuring his stay in Los Angeles, Pau was called to play in three more All-Star Games.\n\nIn 2012, Pau received the NBA’s J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Prize for his support of different charitable works."
