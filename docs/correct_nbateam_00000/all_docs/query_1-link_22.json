        "text": "Pau Gasol recalled one of his first moments after arriving in Memphis to play for the Grizzlies.\n\n\"Wow, a pyramid,\" he said during his induction speech Saturday night at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. \"I guess all NBA teams play in pyramids here.\"\n\nGasol's first moments in Memphis included playing at The Pyramid before moving to FedExForum. Now he is the first former Grizzlies All-Star to be enshrined in the Hall of Fame, a member of the Class of 2023 that includes former Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade and former Dallas Mavericks power forward Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nGasol recapped his entire basketball journey, which started when he was 7. That quest included the stop in Memphis.\n\n\"I'm proud of my years in Memphis,\" he said. \"The work that we did, we set the foundation for what the Grizzlies have become.\"\n\nGasol played his first six-plus years in the NBA with the Grizzlies before being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2007-08 season. He averaged 18.8 points and 8.6 rebounds and was named an All-Star while with the Grizzlies.\n\nHe won two championships with the Lakers and was a three-time All-Star there. He put together two more All-Star seasons with the Chicago Bulls before playing his final game in 2019.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks made Gasol the third overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft, but the-then Vancouver Grizzlies traded Shareef Abdur-Rahim for Gasol.\n\nDuring that same draft, the Grizzlies selected Shane Battier with the sixth overall pick. Battier, who played five seasons as Gasol's teammate, was at the ceremony.\n\nGasol did not know much English at the time and relied on Battier in their introductory news conference.\n\n\"I quickly recognized that (Battier) was very smart, so I just had to follow what he said,\" Gasol said.\n\nGasol thanked former Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, general manager Jerry West, Battier and former teammates Jason Williams, Stromile Swift and the late Lorenzen Wright, among others."
