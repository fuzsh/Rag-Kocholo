        "text": "MEMPHIS — Pau Gasol was hoping Saturday night would be more than nostalgic, that his homecoming of sorts would turn into an epic celebration on Beale Street for his beloved little brother and the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers forward hadn't been back to the FedExForum like this, sitting in a suite among the passionate thousands of fans while his old team entered new territory, and Marc Gasol — Defensive Player of the Year Marc Gasol, that is — was as big a reason for this historic run as any. Pau was his one-of-a-kind self, the 32-year-old who remains the franchise's all-time scoring leader, shaking hands with those who knew him as a much younger man during his six-plus seasons with the team.\n\nHe called people by name, asked how they had been and apologized for not getting out of his seat to greet other well-wishers because, well, he's not moving so well after having both of his knees surgically treated for tendinitis this month. The Grizzlies loss that put the San Antonio Spurs up 3-0 in the Western Conference finals dampened the local mood in what is the franchise's first trip to the conference finals, but it did nothing to dim the pride he feels for his 28-year-old brother, whose talent was so widely dismissed when they were traded for each other in 2008.\n\n\"It's emotional, but of course I'm happy,\" Pau Gasol told USA TODAY Sports during the game. \"I'm enjoying seeing him play so well and the team do so well. It's a good feeling as a big brother.\n\n\"It's weird, though. It's a little awkward, but it's the development of life. I'm in a different situation. It was a few years ago when I was here, and I spent a lot of moments of my career here. Most of it. It's a little awkward, but at the same time it's really rewarding to be here, to see the franchise doing so well. My brother is a key piece, so I'm just happy I was able to come here and be here to see this and experience it.\"\n\nTo review: Marc Gasol (or his NBA rights, to be more specific) was part of the deal that also brought Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, and two first-round picks to Memphis in exchange for then-Grizzlies big man Pau Gasol. But as Pau was quick to remind the masses, two key points are often lost when the controversial trade is so often recanted: Marc, while certainly heftier and not the player he is today, had recently been named MVP of Spain's ACB League before joining the Grizzlies and was thus the farthest thing from a throw-in player; and, of course, big brother had wanted to add little brother to the Grizzlies long before it happened at his expense.\n\n\"He was dominating the (ACB) league, and that was right after he got drafted (48th overall) by the Lakers,\" Pau Gasol said. \"So I was telling the Grizzlies to please try to get him, try to get him over, get the rights from the Lakers somehow. I remember at the time, before the season started, the rights were up for grabs and (the Lakers) were asking for money, cash. And my brother played really well, I kept insisting with the Grizzlies to get him, to get him. So I tried to get him, and in the end they got him — through me.\n\n\"It was kind of ironic. But I'm happy that things worked out so well for both of us.\"\n\nPau Gasol — whose Grizzlies made three playoff appearances and lost in the first round every time — went on to win two titles with the Lakers and will forever go down as a champion as a result. But while Marc seems set as a core piece of a team that should contend for years to come, the future is beyond murky in Laker Land for Pau, and the continued uncertainty surrounding free-agent-to-be Dwight Howard isn't helping matters.\n\nWhile Pau is aware that he may be traded, the problematic part for all involved is that Howard is taking his time with the decision. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said at end-of-season interviews that he was hoping Howard would make up his mind sooner rather than later, as there's a very real ripple effect on his ability to make key offseason decisions like, say, whether or not to trade Pau Gasol.\n\n\"Dwight is looking at his options, and there's nothing wrong with that, I guess,\" Pau said. \"I'm not him. I'm not in his position, but I guess it all starts with his decision and I'm sure the franchise is waiting to see whether he decides to sign (with the Lakers) or sign with somebody else, I guess.\"\n\nWhile it had been widely assumed that the Lakers would not bring Howard and Gasol back because of the monumental hit they would take with the league's increased luxury tax, Kupchak said at the end-of-season session that scenarios remained in play in which they could both return. Despite the fact that the Lakers barely made the playoffs and were swept in the first round by San Antonio, the Lakers' Kobe Bryant even lobbied for the team to stay together for one more year. Pau Gasol's contract, which will pay him $19.2 million next season, has just one year remaining.\n\n\"Obviously from the team's standpoint, the sooner Dwight makes his decision the better,\" Pau said. \"And as players and teammates too (it's better), because in a way I don't know — there's certain things that depend on his decision, right? Probably. I don't know what percentage (it factors in), or to what extent, but to some extent yes.\"\n\nThose were questions to be answered another day, though. The third quarter was about to start, and the tension was high in the room as the Grizzlies' 18-point, first-quarter lead was down to four at the break. And this night, win or lose for Memphis, was about remembering his cherished past and embracing his brother's present.\n\n\"I think it's great that we both had our different paths,\" Pau said. \"I had an amazing time, and moments and years and championships with the Lakers thanks to that trade. Now Marc is going through a great experience, and let's see how far they can get.\""
