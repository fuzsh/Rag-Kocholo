        "text": "Another “record” is set to join Zach Randolph’s 50 in the rafters of FedEx Form. Sixteen years to the date the Grizzlies acquired Marc Gasol (aka Big Spain, aka Wendigo) the franchise announced he will have his 33 retired on Saturday April 6th immediately following a clash with the Philadelphia 76ers. Gasol, who spent 11 season on Beale Street, is one of the most decorated players in franchise history and guided the “Core 4” teams to 7 consecutive playoff births.\n\nAcquired in the now famous trade that sent his brother Pau to the Lakers, Marc joined the Grizzlies at a pivotal moment in franchise history. Memphis, just 2 years removed from back-to-back-to-back playoff appearances, was a team looking like they were losing grip on the momentum Pau Gasol had brought to the team. Marc would join fellow 2007 draft classmate Mike Conley and forge one of the most formidable duos in the NBA. Eventually adding Zach Randolph and Tony Allen to form the now infamous Core 4, the franchise found unparalleled success under Marc Gasol’s watch in the paint.\n\nThe Barcelona, Spain native had already found success oversees in the FIBA league before joining Memphis. However, Memphis would become his home and the place where he would redefine his basketball lore. Coming in as an overlooked draft pick, the 48th pick in the 2007 draft, the 7’1″ center had a lot to prove by joining Memphis. What would transpire is something of legend and the beginning of a hall of fame career. No longer was he the chubby, lumbering child that played at Lausanne Colliegiate School in Memphis. No, he became something of mythical proportions, akin to the Wendingo of Native America lore.\n\nBold and crafty, strong and dominating, Gasol would go on to be the first Grizzlies to start an NBA All-Star game, in 2015 against brother Pau, along with 2 other All-Star selections. Marc was also the first European-born player to earn the NBA Defensive Player of the Year following the 2012-13 season. Marc lead the team to the first postseason series win in 2011 and a trip to the Western Conference finals in 2013. He is the Grizzlies all-time leader in minutes played (25,917), games started (762), field goals made (4,341), free throws made (2,701), defensive rebounds (4,624), total rebounds (2,639), and blocks (1,135). To say Gasol has earned this is an understatement.\n\nFor me as a fan, I will always appreciate his aggressive defensive style and how he paved the way for Jaren Jackson, Jr to earn his own DPOY award. Gasol had so many clutch shots, improbable banked in threes, and game winners that will be etched in Grizzlies’ ethos for all time. I remember a triple overtime game against the Spurs, we ultimately lost, that he hit a mid court 3 to send to the first overtime. I was half asleep watching but suddenly wide awake rooting on the Grizz. He did the same thing against them in the playoffs to propel us to victory. I always watched in awe at what the nimble big man would do next. Marc could take over a game like no one else. Dominating both offensively and defensively in the paint, he could change games and swing momentum with one swipe of his big paw. Often spawning out of no where, Marc would appear and deny a would be lay up to set up a fast break for Conely. He won playoff games single handedly and who could forget the Connor McGregor strut popular on Grizz Twitter to this date. Marc truly was a legend on the court.\n\nIf you have the chance, grab tickets to the game. Bring old friends and new fans to come watch one the pillars of the franchise have his number placed among legends. More will come, some we may not even know yet, but there will never be another Big Spain. Marc Gasol is a legend not just in Memphis, but in Toronto for bringing a championship there in 2019. He is adored in his homeland for many FIBA honors and championships. However, he is Memphis. Marc loved Memphis and still calls it home. Now it is our turn to show him love one more time, on the court where we witness the making of a legend.\n\nGracias Marc por todo lo que hiciste por nosotros. Grit and Grind forever.\n\nSee y’all April 6th."
