        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — In theory, everyone came to retire a player’s number.\n\nIn reality, they came just as much to retire an era.\n\nNo, the Memphis Grizzlies’ Grit N Grind Era didn’t produce a championship, but in the rings-or-bust environment in which 29 teams finish the season unhappy, it’s important to note that it still yielded something tangible and appreciated. That team not only delivered Memphis’ first true moment as a pro sports city, but it was a team whose style was almost uniquely in sync with the locality it represented.\n\nSo, when Marc Gasol’s No. 33 went up into the FedExForum rafters on Saturday night, joining Zach Randolph’s No. 50 as the only retired jerseys in franchise history, it became more than a night about one player. That could be felt even in the build-up to the event, including an outstanding 100-minute documentary by Mike Blevins that mostly doubled as a recap of virtually the entire Grit N Grind era, warts and all. (Full disclosure: I was the Grizzlies’ vice president of basketball operations from 2012 to 2019.)\n\n“It’s a blue-collar town, and we were a bunch of blue-collar players,” said Randolph, repeating an oft-remembered line of his to huge applause.\n\nThus, when Memphis’ “Core Four” — Gasol, Randolph, Mike Conley and Tony Allen — showed up together for the first time since trash-bag day in the spring of 2017, a huge ovation roared from the crowd. Nearly all those fans had stayed in their seats following the undercard of an overmatched eight-man roster’s inevitable 20-point loss to the Philadelphia 76ers because the real event was afterward.\n\nThe timing couldn’t have been better, with the Grizzlies in the midst of a lost, forgettable “gap year” season that effectively ended with Ja Morant’s shoulder injury in early January. With all due respect to Taylor Jenkins and the leftover Grizzlies players still competing, nobody is all that locked into the present. And with five years under the bridge since the 2019 trades of Gasol and Conley closed the curtain on the Grit ‘N’ Grind Era, it was a perfect time for closure.\n\nSeveral other mainstays of that Memphis era rolled in as well, including Rudy Gay, Tayshaun Prince, Quincy Pondexter, Darrell Arthur, Mike Miller, Beno Udrih and Jon Leuer. Marc’s brother and former Grizzlies All-Star Pau Gasol was here, too, as well as former coach Dave Joerger. Also, Marc’s former Toronto coach Nick Nurse and teammate Kyle Lowry — now both employed by the Sixers and thus in the building anyway — stuck around rather than immediately zip to the next city for a back-to-back.\n\n(Added Nurse about Gasol, in a moment of levity before the game: “Incredible parade experience by him.” I can assure you the after-party this time was more tame.)\n\nEventually, Conley’s No. 11 and Tony Allen’s No. 9 will join Gasol’s and Randolph’s in the FedExForum ceiling, with Allen likely on deck given that Conley is still chugging along in Minnesota. Team owner Robert Pera put out statements to that effect when they left the Grizzlies.\n\nBut back to Saturday night. Marc Gasol is arguably the most significant player of that era, ranking either first or second on the Grizzlies’ all-time leaderboards in virtually every category and being the only player in franchise history to make first team All-NBA (in 2015). Additionally, his story is rare because of his local origin story, coming here as Pau’s pudgy kid brother before re-emerging from his cocoon in 2008 — after being traded for his brother! — as a full-fledged NBA center. Notably, the Grizzlies theme for the night was “Marc Gasol, Memphis Made.”\n\nThe Gasol brothers and their families didn’t just dip into town for a night, either. They live in Spain now, with Marc trying to build a basketball team of his own in Girona, but that didn’t stop the whole gang from spending a week in Memphis reminiscing and seeing old landmarks, showing Marc’s children (now 9 and 7) sights they might barely remember.\n\n“A lot of feelings from when we were here,” Pau Gasol said. “We gotta make this a yearly thing because this city was a big part of our careers and our lives.”\n\nConsumed by winning and holding strong ideas about how the game should be played, Marc held himself (and others) to a high standard in achieving it. As he noted in that documentary, that sometimes made him grumpy, and he was totally incapable of masking it, often saying things to himself in Spanish and Catalan that you definitely didn’t want translated. Marc had many skills, but disguising his feelings behind a smiley face wasn’t one of them, as his mates on the stage on Saturday were quick to joke about.\n\n“I’m sorry; sometimes I know I can be a pain in the ass,” Gasol said when it was his turn at the mic. “I just care so much about winning and playing the right way, so thank you for putting up with me.”\n\nWhile he was serious and sometimes brooding, Gasol had a fun side that popped out too … whether via his incurable zeal to attempt to bank a shot in off the shot clock during any break in practice (something Conley now honors in his pregame ritual in Minnesota) or the levity of dressing up as Cousin It from “The Addams Family” at a team Halloween party.\n\nSomehow, something with Gasol and those three players and this city clicked. None were superstars, but together, they were more than the sum of their parts. In the frontcourt, Randolph and Gasol were the “brothers from another mother,” with a particular connection on high-low sets.\n\n“Marc is such an unselfish player, the type of person he is,” Randolph said. “He’d rather everybody scored before himself. He wanted to get other guys shots.”\n\nAs a group, from the time Allen arrived in 2010 until he and Randolph left in free agency in 2017, the Core Four spent seven seasons together, won 29 playoff games and four series, made the 2013 Western Conference finals and never had a losing record. Along the way, the four knocked Chris Paul, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard out of the postseason, among others. Three of them made All-Defense, three of them became All-Stars, and Gasol and Randolph made All-NBA teams. By 2017, they were far and away the longest-tenured quartet in the league.\n\nGasol and his good friend (and team plane seatmate) Conley actually were together even longer than that, starting in 2008 until Gasol’s trade to Toronto in 2019. The guard and the center, pick-and-roll partners, also balanced each other perfectly emotionally, with Conley’s steady calm the yin to Gasol’s yang. They were the league’s longest-tenured teammates at the time Gasol was dealt to Toronto.\n\nThat’s what made Conley’s arrival for this so special, as he’s the only one of the four still playing. Still, he zipped in between Timberwolves games in Phoenix and Los Angeles, arriving in Memphis in time for the festivities and leaving just afterward to catch a four-hour flight back to L.A. for a Sunday morning shootaround. In total, he spent over seven hours in the sky for roughly three hours at FedExForum.\n\n“Trying to win that Twyman-Stokes Award” Conley joked, referencing the league’s Teammate of the Year honor, before adding, “I wouldn’t have missed this for the world.”\n\nIn the end, Gasol’s pairing with Memphis was an unlikely but undeniable connection between player and city that sparked an era. Gasol felt that enough to have “Grit N Grind” inscribed on the inside of the NBA championship ring he won in Toronto in 2019, something he shared again with the crowd in Memphis on Saturday.\n\n“His DNA kinda connected really well with the city’s identity,” Pau Gasol said pregame. “Hard worker, would give his all to the team, every game he competed. I think it just resonated really well with a blue-collar city. And I think having those two years of high school also connected him more.”\n\n“I had a very unique perspective because I came as 16-year-old,” Marc Gasol said. “I had the perspective of a fan, of what is expected from the team in Memphis, and then followed the team in Spain. When I came back as a Grizzlies player, I carried that with me, and I carried that kind of pride. And I hope everyone enjoyed what they saw for so many years.”\n\n(Photo of Marc Gasol: Chris Day / The Commercial Appeal / USA Today Network)"
