        "text": "Spanish basketball legend Pau Gasol has formally announced his retirement. In career spanning more than two decades, 19 NBA seasons, the elder Gasol won two championship with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010. He moved to Chicago before spending his “twilight” in San Antonio.\n\nGasol joined the Spurs in 2016 and played in 168 games with the team, averaging 10.0 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 2.6 assists.\n\nGasol joined the Milwaukee Bucks after being bought out of his Spurs contract in 2019 in hopes of making one more title run. Gasol did not play the following season. He signed with the Portland Trail Blazers before being waived. Gasol returned to Spain, where he played for the FB Barcelona club.\n\nSpurs head coach Gregg Popovich referred to Gasol as an “exceptional individual and the ultimate professional. We are grateful for his contributions on the court, in the locker room and in our community.”\n\nGasol retires as one of ten players to record 20,000+ points, 10,000+ rebounds, and 1,000+ blocks since 1980, according to Basketball-Reference. Gasol joins fellow Spurs Tim Duncan and David Robinson on that list.\n\nWelcome to the Thread. Join in the conversation, start your own discussion, and share your thoughts. This is the Spurs community, your Spurs community. Thanks for being here."
