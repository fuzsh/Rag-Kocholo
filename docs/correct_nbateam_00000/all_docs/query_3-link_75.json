        "text": "Pau Gasol, a two-time NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers, will be watching intently in the early hours of Friday morning - from 3:00am CET - as his brother, Marc, could win an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Raptors are currently 3-2 ahead in the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, the champions for the last two years, and they will travel to Oracle as they look to close out the series.\n\n\"I'm preparing for tonight with excitement, eager [for Marc] to do well and close out the series and [win] the championship,\" Gasol said.\n\n\"They could not do it in Game 5 [as they lost by one point at home].\n\n\"I would have liked to be able to attend, although I couldn't [due to other commitments].\n\n\"I will be following the game [from Barcelona], experiencing it in a special way.\"\n\nShould Marc and the Raptors win, either in Game 6 or Game 7, the Gasol brothers would be the first siblings to both have an NBA ring.\n\n\"I hope so, [but] first it has to happen,\" he noted.\n\n\"It's looking good. Marc and I have had a lot of luck in our lives, achieving things that neither of us could have dreamt of as children.\n\n\"It is a very special pride as a family, and I hope that this possibility of becoming the first brothers to have won a ring in history is fulfilled.\"\n\nDespite Pau's vast experience, and the fact he has won two championships, he has not offered advice to his younger brother.\n\n\"We try not to talk about basketball,\" he said.\n\n\"He has played this sport for many years and he's been hoping to have the opportunity that he's having now.\n\n\"He had the good fortune of being traded to Toronto and he's very close to winning it [the NBA championship].\n\n\"He's prepared to continue sacrificing and doing what his team needs in order to have the best chance of winning.\"\n\nThe only advice Pau would offer is for the Raptors as a collective.\n\n\"They must be aggressive and push for the title,\" Gasol stated.\n\nThe 38-year-old suffered a foot injury which meant that he was unable to feature in the playoffs for the Milwaukee Bucks, but his focus is now on recuperating.\n\n\"I hope to recuperate well from the foot [injury] and contribute to the team where I will play,\" added Gasol.\n\n\"It has been a very difficult season due to injury. I haven't been able to have continuity. I've never had a season like this in my career.\n\n\"My only focus is on recovering and being ready for next season.\"\n\nDue to his injury, Gasol will miss the World Cup in China this summer after he underwent surgery in May, but he is still confident that Spain will succeed.\n\n\"We have great players and a very special cohesion,\" said Pau.\n\n\"The group spirit is there.\"\n\nThe centre is hoping that he will be able to make the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo."
