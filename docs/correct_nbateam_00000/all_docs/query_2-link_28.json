        "text": "Marc Gasol’s life in Memphis can be best broken into three chapters.\n\nHe came to Memphis as a chubby high school basketball player known as the little brother of former top-three pick Pau Gasol. Later, Marc Gasol carved out his own legacy by helping usher the best run in Memphis Grizzlies history. While playing from 2008-2019 in Memphis, Gasol became a three-time all star and the back line of the defense that helped launch the franchise to its greatest heights during the \"Grit and Grind\" era.\n\nNow that he’s retired, Gasol’s third chapter will take center stage on Saturday when his No. 33 goes into the rafters at FedExForum following the Grizzlies' game against the Philadelphia 76ers (7 p.m., Bally Sports Southeast). He’ll join his former teammate Zach Randolph as the only two retired numbers in the arena.\n\n“It’s going to be a real emotional moment when they drag that 33 in the air,” former Grizzlies teammate Tony Allen said. “I put a lot of grit and grind moments in the game with him.”\n\nMarc Gasol makes Memphis his second home\n\nBefore he became known as “Big Spain,” Gasol was a big joker. His looseness around his Lausanne teammates stood out, particularly since he was the younger brother of the Grizzlies' star when he arrived at the school in 2001. He fit in with Memphians from all walks of life almost immediately.\n\n“I know the person behind the player, and he is as genuine, sincere and caring as an individual as you can be,” said Jason Peters, Gasol’s high school coach at Lausanne. “He would joke around with the 15th man on the roster as much as he would with the first man on the roster.”\n\nPeters, who plans on attending Saturday’s game, laughs when he recalls all of the stories and memories of Gasol. One stands out in particular, though.\n\nGasol stayed with Peters for a few weeks during his last year of high school after his parents went back to Spain. When Gasol moved in, Peters was concerned about the 6-foot-11 center hitting his head on the ceiling fan. He would often remind Gasol when his head was close.\n\n“No, no, coach, I’m fine. I’m used to it,” Peters recalls Gasol saying.\n\nGasol and Peters were preparing to go to the airport to drop off Gasol to go back to Spain. Gasol told Peters that he left something in the house and went back inside. Then, Peters heard a loud noise and saw Gasol hit his head on the garage. When he went over to check on Gasol in a state of panic, the teenager had pranked Peters by smearing red ketchup on his forehead to mimic bruising.\n\n“He got me,” Peters said.\n\nMarc Gasol’s impact on Grizzlies teammates\n\nGasol’s unselfishness is the one area that is often highlighted by his former teammates. On and off the court, Gasol is remembered as a team-first player.\n\nHe would often garner criticism when he passed up shots, but he’d also receive praise when those moments led to strong results. He averaged 15.2 points per game and 7.7 rebounds with Memphis.\n\nThat mentality meant he often wasn't the most discussed member of the Core Four, alongside Mike Conley, Randolph and Allen. But with three all-star appearances and a Defensive Player of the Year award, Gasol is the most decorated Grizzlies player of that era.\n\n“That's my brother, man. I feel like it was an honor to play with him,” Allen said. “It was definitely one of those situations where he made me better every day. His work ethic, his poise, his locker room leadership, I just like him for the fact that he instilled winning into all of us. It was a collective spirit that he just had. Just willing to give himself up. Not a selfish guy. A guy with that type of skill and a guy with that type of leadership, how could you not want to be around him?”\n\nAWARDS WATCH: Memphis Grizzlies' Jaren Jackson Jr. plays 65th game, eligible for NBA postseason honors\n\nLasting legacy in Memphis\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. is the lone current Grizzlies player who played in Memphis with Gasol. Jackson has often talked about what he learned from Gasol as a rookie, especially on the defensive end.\n\nGasol was the first Grizzlies player to win the Defensive Player of the Year award. Jackson joined him last season when he achieved the honor. He credits Gasol for being a major assist in teaching him professional habits and the art of defensive positioning. Gasol wasn’t the best athlete, but he was one of the smartest.\n\n“I’m excited,” Jackson said of the jersey retirement. “So happy. He did a lot when he was here. I can’t wait to see all that on the video and see everyone’s reaction.”\n\nGasol’s impact goes beyond those who shared the locker room with him, and his presence lives on today through the relationship he forged with Memphis.\n\n“Even though I didn’t get the fortune to coach him, you just hear so much about what he means to this community,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. “I know guys that are in Grizzlies uniforms now understand the history that all these guys paved before. Marc’s definitely at the top of that.”"
