        "text": "On Monday, Memphis Grizzlies fired David Fizdale after a poor start to the season and rumored friction between himself and Marc Gasol.\n\nDuring a recent game, Marc was inexplicably benched during the game which led to some negative feelings from the Grizzlies' star and it stirred the pot that maybe Marc has a hand in Fizdale's firing.\n\nHis brother, San Antonio Spurs' Pau Gasol, touched on his brother's situation in Memphis and says Marc likely had nothing to do with Fizdale's firing.\n\nVia :\n\n\"He was upset about the game last night. Marc is a competitor and he wants to play. For him not to go back in that fourth quarter, was not OK.\n\nâ€œIt's weird the timing of it. I don't think Marc had anything to do with the decision.\n\nMemphis lost eight straight and the team is not putting themselves in any place to compete to win games. Growing frustrations among the franchise also doesn't help.\n\nKeep in mind this is the same franchise that let go of Lionel Hollins and Dave Joerger despite their success in Memphis, guiding them to the playoffs.\n\nThe team lost Zach Randolph, Tony Allen, and Vince Carter over the summer - core players that made Memphis tough to play against each and every game - and Mike Conley is injured and it shouldn't come to a shock that Memphis is struggling.\n\nIn the end, this wasn't cause to fire Fizdale and whatever relationship he had with Marc shouldn't be a deciding factor in how things went down so early in the season. It goes back to ownership and management and what they see as what is needed for the franchise.\n\nYou hope everything works out for the Memphis Grizzlies, especially because my brother is there, and I want him to do well.\""
