        "text": "Before the San Antonio Spurs faced off with the Memphis Grizzlies recently, Pau Gasol spoke with the media and came to the defense of his brother, Grizzlies center Marc Gasol, on the direction of the franchise and how he should be upset.\n\nVia :\n\n“Of course, he’s upset. He should be upset,” Pau, a forward with the San Antonio Spurs, said on the eve of their game Monday night at AT&T Center. “Any player who competes and cares would be upset. That’s a good sign from a player who cares and is a leader. He’s putting his body on the line and not quitting.”\n\nMemphis has been going through a transition period starting in the offseason when Zach Randolph was sent packing. Many were to believe that was when the franchise started veering the opposite direction.\n\nMarc has become vocal during the time of losses, and frustration undoubtedly is starting to settle in. With Mike Conley out for the season, it only leaves Marc as the lone veteran on the team. He is used to seeing his Grizzlies team grind it out against the NBA’s top teams and now, they are almost a welcoming mat.\n\nBut big brother Pau gave more advice to his brother, despite what is going on within the franchise.\n\n“What I told him is, ‘Do your best. Keep competing.’ That’s the only thing you can control,” Pau said. “You can’t control that one of your best players, Mike Conley, is out for the year. You can’t control that (Chandler) Parsons, one of your biggest signings, has an (injury) issue and so forth. All you can control is your effort, your work ethic, your mindset going into games.”\n\nPau and the Spurs defeat the Grizzlies, 100-98 in the team's final meeting of the regular-season.\n\nAt this point, Memphis can only plan for the future and cash in on a very high draft pick in the upcoming 2018 NBA Draft."
