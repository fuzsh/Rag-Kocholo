        "text": "It was sixteen years ago today.\n\nOne of the more memorable days in Grizzlies franchise history.\n\nPerhaps not has significant as the day the Grizzlies beat the Spurs for their first playoff victory, or the day they traded for Zach Randolph, or the day they drafted Ja Morant (for better) or Hasheem Thabeet (or worse).\n\nBut it could be the singular day in Grizzlies franchise history that time has transformed from one of the worst moments into one of the best.\n\nIt was a day that made headlines around the league, and not for positive reasons. Headlines that made many question what exactly the Grizzlies were up too in Memphis, including some very notable names:\n\nIt was the day that the Grizzlies traded Pau Gasol to the Los Angeles Lakers for a trade package that did not seem anywhere close to reflecting the value that the elder Gasol brother provided as a player. But in that trade return package was the rights to the younger Gasol brother, Marc. And for the next decade, the younger Gasol brother created plenty of memories and provided more than enough value in Memphis that turned the day he was traded for his brother into a lasting positive for the Grizzlies.\n\nWhile Pau may individually be on a higher level than Marc in terms of career production, the younger Gasol brother turning into an All-NBA talent after being drafted 48th in the 2007 draft is very impressive. And the fact that he achieved that with the Grizzlies is truly historic. Over the next few years after the infamous brother for brother trade, Marc Gasol would join Mike Conley (his fellow 2007 draft class member), Zach Randolph, and Tony Allen to create one of the best homegrown eras and brands of basketball in recent NBA history.\n\nAnd as Grit N Grind grew in popularity and success, so did the impact of Marc Gasol.\n\nIf Zach Randolph is the perfect embodiment of Memphis itself in NBA terms, Marc Gasol is the perfect example of making the most of embracing Memphis as home. And that is exactly what Gasol did over his 10+ years with the Grizzlies, and in the process, he became the most accomplished player in franchise history. No one has played more minutes or made more shots in a Grizzlies uniform than Marc Gasol. From many analytical perspectives, his performance as a Grizzlies player made more positive impact than any other player in franchise history. And in terms of accolades and accomplishments, Gasol currently stands as the most “decorated” player in franchise history as well:\n\nGasol anchored an era and brand that was defined by defense. As the NBA was evolving into more of an offensive game focused on production from the perimeter, Gasol, Randolph, and others thrived producing and defending the paint. And while Memphis may have never truly been a contender during this time, it did sustain consistent success. Over the span in which the Grizzlies made the playoffs for seven straight years, Memphis had the fifth best Defensive Rating and seventh highest win total in the NBA. It was the best era of basketball in franchise history, thanks to making the most of a “Core 4” that loved playing together and loved where they played.\n\nAnd yet, the significance of Marc Gasol goes beyond his production and accolades. He was a true maker of moments, with several game winning shots that are among the best highlights in the history of the Grizzlies:\n\nFrom his memorable “McGregor Walk” celebration to several big shots hit vs the Spurs, the stage was never too big for Gasol. And in terms of the NBA has a whole, one of the best moments of Gasol’s career was taking center stage with his brother at the 2015 All-Star game, as they became the first pair of brothers to be All-Star Starters in the same year. Though they had shared the court many times before, that may have been the most special of all.\n\nWhile Pau Gasol helped establish a winning franchise in Memphis, Marc Gasol helped to show that success can be sustainable in the Bluff City. The younger Gasol’s emergence from a 24-year old late second round pick into an All-NBA talent proved that the Grizzlies could develop significant talent that could impact winning. And when Gasol, with others, maintained loyalty to Memphis as their success grew, it showed that the Grizzlies franchise and Memphis could be a winner in the NBA.\n\nAnd that is what stands out the most about Marc Gasol. His loyalty not only extends to the Grizzlies, but the city of Memphis itself. Sure, Gasol went on to win an NBA title with Toronto and will likely be a Hall of Famer one day due to his success in the NBA and his home country of Spain. But much of the evolution of the player and person that so many in the game of basketball love happened in Memphis. And for that reason, the love that Gasol has and will show for Memphis will always be giving back on the same level.\n\nAnd so, as Gasol’s professional basketball journey ended on the day before the sixteenth anniversary of him arriving where his NBA career began, there are many reasons to celebrate a tremendous basketball career. This extends from the impact he made on the court during his career to the lasting impact he made even after he left, including the influence he had on current Grizzlies star Jaren Jackson Jr. But even more importantly, it is also a reminder to cherish one of the best individuals to ever play the game. Because as good of a player as a Gasol was on the court, he was a better person off of it.\n\nSo in time, Gasol will deserve to have his number retired by the Grizzlies and eventually become a member of the Hall of Fame. And while others may surpass Gasol in terms of his production and accolades with the franchise, he will maintain a legacy as one of the “Greatest Grizzlies”.\n\nBecause while Marc Gasol made his mark and the most of his time in Memphis, the most important thing of all is that he proudly made it his home."
