        "text": "After a high-profile and fraught exit from Star Trek, Terry Farrell says she is ready to return.\n\nTerry Farrell ready for Jadzia Dax to live again\n\nAfter six seasons playing the joined Trill Jadzia Dax on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Terry Farrell left the series before the seventh and final season. The resulting decision by the producers to kill off her character in the season six finale remains controversial. In the past, Farrell has said her “heart was broken” by the whole experience, but it appears she is ready for it to mend. During a recent GalaxyCon panel of DS9 actors, a fan asked the group if they would like to return to any of the current Paramount+ Star Trek shows as a guest star, and Farrell replied in the affirmative, along with making a joke about her departure:\n\nSure, Yeah. Just to be alive again would be fun. [laughs]\n\nCo-star Armin Shimerman joined in on the light moment suggesting, “Your best work may be after you’re dead,” to which Farrell replied, “You never know.”\n\nWhile able to make light of it now, leaving Star Trek in 1997 was very difficult for Farrell. She had attempted to negotiate to get more flexibility including doing fewer episodes, however, she revealed in the 2016 book The Fifty-Year Mission executive producer Rick Berman tried to “bully” her, telling the actress “If you weren’t here, you know you’d be working at Kmart.” In the 2019 documentary What We Left Behind, Farrell spoke emotionally about being given a “take-it-or-leave-it offer” and the acrimonious nature of the negotiation was the “last straw” for the actress who reluctantly chose to leave, tearfully revealing in the documentary, “I didn’t want to die. But there was a point where I was like, You know what, don’t dismiss me. Talk to me.”\n\nNone of the executives involved with those negotiations are involved with the new Paramount+ Star Trek shows, so it appears Farrell is ready to return if asked. As for seeing Jadzia alive again, in the world of Star Trek and sci-fi, there are many ways that could be done, including some specific to the Trill. Deep Space Nine showed examples of Trill interacting with former hosts, something also seen recently in season three of Star Trek: Discovery.\n\nNicole de Boer, who took on the role of Ezri Dax for season seven, was part of the same panel and she also indicated she would be happy to return for one of the new Paramount+ Trek shows, saying “any of them would be great.” So, in theory, you could have two Dax hosts show up.\n\nShimerman wants to get animated\n\nThe other actors on the panel nodded along indicating their interest in being guest stars on new Trek, with Andrew Robinson (Garak) exclaiming, “Hire me!” Armin Shimerman (Quark) was open to the idea of appearing on any of the shows, but had a preference, saying:\n\nThe animated show would be great because there’s no lines to memorize, no makeup to put on, no blocking to worry about. Animation is absolutely the way I would like to go.\n\nWith Star Trek: Lower Decks set only a few years after the finale of Deep Space Nine, that seems like a great opportunity to bring back Quark. The station itself already appeared briefly in a flashback during season one.\n\nWatch the full panel"
