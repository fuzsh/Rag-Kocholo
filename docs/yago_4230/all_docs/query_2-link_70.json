        "text": "After eighteen months of modeling, Terry Farrell studied acting with Kate McGregor Stewart, while still modeling on the side. Her first major roles were in the short-lived 1983 television series Paper Dolls playing a model and the feature film Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield. In the spring of 1989, she began studying acting with Stella Adler and appeared in a number of guest-starring roles in series like Quantum Leap and The Cosby Show. In 1992, she played The Cat in a second pilot for a US version of Red Dwarf, which was not picked up (it is rumoured Farrell was not paid for this role, which is why she refuses to discuss the project). A year later she was offered a lead role in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nFarrell starred as Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax, Deep Space 9's Starfleet Science Officer, a character who is host to a 300-year old symbiont and can draw upon the memories and knowledge of the symbiont's six previous hosts. Although she played the character for the series' first six years, Farrell decided to leave the show and not renew for the final (seventh) year with the other cast members.\n\nAfter leaving Deep Space Nine, Farrell won the role of the local diner owner Reggie in Becker. She appeared in Becker for four years, until the producers decided to replace her with Nancy Travis.\n\nFarrell lives in Pennsylvania, with her husband, Sprint Corporation spokesman Brian Baker (a.k.a. the Face and the Voice), their child and their dog. She enjoys cooking and deep sea fishing.\n\nThe asteroid 26734 Terryfarrell, discovered in 2001, was named in her honor by its discoverer, William Kwong Yu Yeung.\n\nFarrell also provided the voice for a character named Six of One for an independent production by the name of Tripping the Rift which was signed to Comedy Central for 13 episodes, though Farrell did not voice the character in any but the original clip."
