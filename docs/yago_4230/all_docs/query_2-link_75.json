        "text": "Michael Dorn should go full Worf to the ceremony and object to the union. Kidding. But...best. prank. ever?\n\nYes, but only if he is dressed as Worf. Well that is until he realizes he is a grown man at a wedding, dressed like a Klingon, objecting over his tv fictional wife from over 20 years ago. At this point he has to slink out and hope nobody has a phone to post pictures or video on the internet.\n\nJason\n\nLet's see: she was cast to play the Spock-like character of DS9; she claims she had a crush on Leonard Nimoy when she was young; her character lusted after Spock, and a past host had an affair with McCoy. Now she's dating Nimoy's son, who makes all the Trek docs. Technically not incestuous, but still strange.\n\nNonetheless, all the luck in the world to them.\n\nI wonder if they ever talk about Star trek when they are together?\n\nI'm sure that's all they talk about during sex.\n\nI wonder if they ever talk about Star trek when they are together?\n\nJason\n\nIt's probably built in to their vows that Star Trek can only be mentioned so many times a day, and never in the bedroom.\n\nmazel tov! I bet Leonard is smiling down on them. I had no idea that Adam was divorced. I am very happy for both of them\n\nI think he was divorced from his first wife, because his second wife died. I think she had a brain tumor? They talk about it in For the Love of Spock. Really heartbreaking. I'm glad he found companionship again.\n\nMichael Dorn should go full Worf to the ceremony and object to the union. Kidding. But...best. prank. ever?\n\nO, what a Trill that would be\n\nAnd a million fan fictions are born . . . .\n\n\"Jadzia, I'd like you to meet Ambassador Spock's son.\"\n\nIs that Ambassador Spock's son from his marriage or his pon farr incident with Saavik? Or is it his son from Zarabeth in \"Yesterday's Son\"?\n\nAnd a million fan fictions are born . . . .\n\n\"Jadzia, I'd like you to meet Ambassador Spock's son.\"\n\nYes!\n\nAdd to that my theory that Jadzia never died which I presented in a post above and it will get even more interesting!\n\nI already have a page on the Kes Website called \"Voyager Mysteries-and how to solve them\"where I present theories about certain odd things in the Voyager series. Maybe I have to start one about DS9 too.\n\nIt could be \"Quarks's Questions\" or \"Garak's Gossip\", maybe as some part of a website about one of my favorite DS9 charaters, Quark or Garak."
