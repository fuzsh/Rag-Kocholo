        "text": "Emmy voters are paying attention. The Television Academy announced nominations for the 76th Emmys on Wednesday morning, and the announcement was filled with historic-making choices and several critically acclaimed names and titles that had been overdue for recognition.\n\nLeading the charge was FX’s “Shogun,” which scored a stunning 25 nominations (including limited series) and scored first-time acting nominations for stars Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai. It was an amazing morning for FX, which landed 93 noms all together — helped also by the record-breaking 23 nominations (the most in Emmy history) for its comedy series “The Bear.”\n\n“The Bear” was already an Emmy superstar, having landed 10 wins in 2023 — making it the most Emmys won by a series in its first season. This time, “The Bear” stars Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Lionel Boyce and Liza Colón-Zayas all received acting nods.\n\nFX’s surge made it the second-most nominated network this year, behind only Netflix (107). And that put it above HBO and Max (91), which wasn’t one of the top two networks for the first time in multiple decades. (This is a bit of a “bye” year for HBO, as a number of its top contenders either ended their runs or didn’t air last season due to production delays.)\n\n“This one really caught us by surprise and in the best possible way.,” said FX chief John Landgraf. “You just feel this overwhelming sense of pride for the artists for the nominees.”\n\nBesides “Shogun” and “The Bear,” FX pulled off a comedy series nomination for “Reservation Dogs,” something that fans and TV critics had been pushing for years. But “Rez Dogs” wasn’t the only previous snub finally rectified: In its third season, “Only Murders in the Building” finally landed an acting nomination for star Selena Gomez.\n\nThe most-nominated limited/anthology series this year was HBO’s “True Detective: Night Country,” with 19. NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” was the most-recognized broadcast entry, with 17 nods. Other outlets having a landmark year included Apple TV+, which scored 70 nominations — thanks to a surging “The Morning Show” (16 nominations), comedy newcomer “Palm Royale” (11) and limited entry “Lessons in Chemistry” (10). (Apple TV+ likes to include two commercials it produced in order to bring that number to 72 — but those ads didn’t air on Apple TV+. And this is a tally of where programs were telecast, not a studio tally.)\n\nNetflix’s haul included “The Crown,” its top nominee (18), as well as “Ripley” (13) and “Baby Reindeer” (11).\n\nTony Hale (“Veep”) and Sheryl Lee Ralph (“Abbott Elementary”) announced the 2024 Emmy nominations Wednesday morning, along with new Television Academy chair Cris Abrego.\n\nWait, didn’t the 2024 Emmys already happen, back in January? Not quite. The Hollywood strikes forced the Television Academy to push the 2023 telecast to January of this year — right in the middle of Oscar season. And now, as Abrego alluded to in his opening, just nine months later we’re doing it again for the June 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024, timeframe.\n\nWith voting ending on June 24 and the 76th Emmy nominations announced Wednesday, now comes Emmy campaign Phase 2. And unlike last year, when the strikes led to months of uncertainty and a lack of talent participation, this time the nominees are primed and ready to hit the campaign trail once again.\n\nThe TV Academy’s approximately 22,000 members made their choices from a pool of 229 total series submitted in the key drama, comedy and limited/anthology series categories in 2024 — down 33% from last year’s 309. And with fewer submissions, the org’s sliding scale has led to fewer nominations in several categories (dropping to five in the lead comedy and limited/anthology/TV movie acting fields).\n\nSome of that decrease is due to a decline in production volume, as networks and streamers pull back on original series. But last year’s strikes also delayed many productions — including series that didn’t make the cut this year but will be back in the running in 2025, like HBO’s “House of the Dragon” (and likely “The Last of Us”), Prime Video’s “The Boys” and Netflix’s “Bridgerton.”\n\nMeanwhile, there were only a handful of major Emmy rules changes this year. Perhaps most notable was a last-minute methodology change in the scripted variety field. With so few submissions, the category was turned into a “juried” competition, with peer group members screening the entries and the top two receiving 70% approval earning a nod.\n\nParty because of its lengthy delay, the most recent Emmys in January posted record-low ratings for the kudocast. The event faced an NFL playoff game, which didn’t help, as it delivered just 4.3 million viewers. But ironically, that little-watched telecast earned some of the strongest critical raves in years for an awards show — Emmys or otherwise. The January event, hosted by Anthony Anderson and produced by Jesse Collins Entertainment, scored high marks for its nostalgic tribute to TV hits of the past 75 years, reuniting casts of series like “Cheers” and “Martin” while paying tribute to classics by re-creating moments from shows like “I Love Lucy” and “All in the Family.” That’s why Jesse Collins Ent. is back to helm this September’s telecast as well.\n\nThe 76th Emmy Awards will be broadcast live from downtown Los Angeles’ LA Live Peacock Theatre on Sunday, Sept. 15, from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET/5 p.m. to 8 p.m. PT on ABC. The broadcast will then be available to be streamed the next day on Hulu. A host has not yet been named.\n\nSee the full list of Emmy nominees below.\n\nDrama Series\n\n“The Crown” (Netflix)\n\n“Fallout” (Prime Video)\n\n“The Gilded Age” (Max)\n\n“The Morning Show” (Apple TV+)\n\n“Mr. and Mrs. Smith” (Prime Video)\n\n“Shōgun” (FX)\n\n“Slow Horses” (Apple TV+)\n\n“3 Body Problem” (Netflix)\n\nComedy Series\n\n“Abbott Elementary” (ABC)\n\n“The Bear” (FX)\n\n“Curb Your Enthusiasm” (Max)\n\n“Hacks” (Max)\n\n“Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)\n\n“Palm Royale” (Apple TV+)\n\n“Reservation Dogs” (FX)\n\n“What We Do in the Shadows” (FX)\n\nLimited or Anthology Series\n\n“Baby Reindeer” (Netflix)\n\n“Fargo” (FX)\n\n“Lessons in Chemistry” (Apple TV+)\n\n“Ripley” (Netflix)\n\n“True Detective: Night Country” (Max)\n\nOutstanding Talk Series\n\n“The Daily Show”\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n\n“Late Night With Seth Meyers”\n\n“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”\n\nReality Competition Program\n\n“The Amazing Race”\n\n“RuPaul’s Drag Race”\n\n“Top Chef”\n\n“The Traitors”\n\n“The Voice”\n\nLead Actor in a Drama Series\n\nIdris Elba (“Hijack”)\n\nDonald Glover (“Mr. & Mrs. Smith”)\n\nWalton Goggins (“Fallout”)\n\nGary Oldman (“Slow Horses”)\n\nHiroyuki Sanada (“Shōgun”)\n\nDominic West (“The Crown”)\n\nLead Actress in a Drama Series\n\nJennifer Aniston (“The Morning Show”)\n\nCarrie Coon (“The Gilded Age”)\n\nMaya Erskine (“Mr. and Mrs. Smith”)\n\nAnna Sawai (“Shōgun”)\n\nImelda Staunton (“The Crown”)\n\nReese Witherspoon (“The Morning Show”)\n\nLead Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nMatt Berry (“What We Do in the Shadows”)\n\nLarry David (“Curb Your Enthusiasm”)\n\nSteve Martin (“Only Murders in the Building”)\n\nMartin Short (“Only Murders in the Building”)\n\nJeremy Allen White (“The Bear”)\n\nD’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai (“Reservation Dogs”)\n\nLead Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nQuinta Brunson (“Abbott Elementary”)\n\nAyo Edebiri (“The Bear”)\n\nSelena Gomez (“Only Murders in the Building”)\n\nMaya Rudolph (“Loot”)\n\nJean Smart (“Hacks”)\n\nKristen Wiig (“Palm Royale”)\n\nLead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series\n\nMatt Bomer (“Fellow Travelers”)\n\nRichard Gadd (“Baby Reindeer”)\n\nJon Hamm (“Fargo”)\n\nTom Hollander (“Feud: Capote vs. the Swans”)\n\nAndrew Scott (“Ripley”)\n\nLead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series\n\nJodie Foster (“True Detective: Night Country”)\n\nBrie Larson (“Lessons in Chemistry”)\n\nJuno Temple (“Fargo”)\n\nSofia Vergara (“Griselda”)\n\nNaomi Watts (“Feud: Capote vs. the Swans”)\n\nSupporting Actress in a Drama Series\n\nChristine Baranski (“The Gilded Age”)\n\nNicole Beharie (“The Morning Show”)\n\nElizabeth Debicki (“The Crown Netflix”)\n\nGreta Lee (“The Morning Show”)\n\nLesley Manville (“The Crown”)\n\nKaren Pittman (“The Morning Show”)\n\nHolland Taylor (“The Morning Show”)\n\nSupporting Actor in a Drama Series\n\nTadanobu Asano (“Shōgun”)\n\nBilly Crudup (“The Morning Show”)\n\nMark Duplass (“The Morning Show”)\n\nJon Hamm (“The Morning Show”)\n\nTakehiro Hira (“Shōgun”)\n\nJack Lowden (“Slow Horses”)\n\nJonathan Pryce (“The Crown”)\n\nSupporting Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nCarol Burnett (“Palm Royale”)\n\nLiza Colón-Zayas (“The Bear”)\n\nHannah Einbinder (“Hacks”)\n\nJanelle James (“Abbott Elementary”)\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph (“Abbott Elementary”)\n\nMeryl Streep (“Only Murders In The Building”)\n\nSupporting Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nLionel Boyce (“The Bear”)\n\nPaul W.
