        "text": "“Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” actress Terry Farrell and Leonard Nimoy’s son, Adam, tied the knot Monday, on what would have been the late Spock actor’s 87th birthday.\n\nFarrell, who played Jadzia on the 1990s sci-fi series, shared the news in a tweet signed “Mrs. Adam Nimoy.”\n\n“Freakin AWESOME day!!!!!!! Love ya all!,” she wrote in the post, accompanied by a photo of the couple on their wedding day from film critic Scott Mantz.\n\nFirst engaged last summer, Farrell and Nimoy were wed in a ceremony at the San Francisco City Hall.\n\nLeonard Nimoy, who originated the role of Spock in the first “Star Trek” TV series, died in 2015 after a bout with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
