        "text": "Biography\n\nTheresa Lee “Terry” Farrell is an American actress and fashion model. She played the role of Jadzia Dax in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and appeared in the comedy series Becker as Regina “Reggie” Kostas.\n\nFarrell was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the daughter of Kay Carol Christine (née Bendickson) and Edwin Francis Farrell, Jr. Later, her mother married David W. Grussendorf, who adopted Terry and her sister, Christine.\n\nIn her junior year of high school, the almost six-foot tall Farrell submitted her image to the Elite modeling agency in New York City. Shortly after, at the age of 16, she was invited to New York City and, within two days of arriving, had an exclusive contract with Mademoiselle. She went on to appear on the covers of the Italian and German editions of Vogue and was also featured in numerous editorials for American Vogue.\n\nIn August 2017, it was reported that she was in a relationship with Adam Nimoy and Farrell confirmed on Twitter that they were engaged. Farrell and Nimoy were married in San Francisco on March 26, 2018, on what would have been Leonard Nimoy’s eighty-seventh birthday."
