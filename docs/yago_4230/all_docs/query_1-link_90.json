        "text": "Well, I should have put a question mark after not getting along- as that should be a question, not a statement- sorry about that!\n\nOn YouTube there's a video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nBQVCwMLIA) about the DS9 relaunch...\n\nIn the comments, someone said that it was \"well known\" that the cast didn't really all get along, and for that reason, some of them would have never agreed to do a DS9 movie. The commenter also mentions you can tell this from the interviews, as well as knowing people who worked on the show.\n\nSo, is there any truth to this? Like Infern0 on this post , i left ds9 at some point originally, and just recently came back- to enjoy it even more now.\n\nBut I have never read anything about the cast not getting along, though I did read somewhere about two cast members getting 'together' (not Siddig and Visitor)... so what's the scoop?\n\nWho didn't get along with whom? Which interviews supposedly indicate this? Everything I've ever read indicates the opposite, and when you see them at conventions, they seem very friendly and happy to see each other (no, I haven't been at conventions, but I've read lots of reports and seen videos). The only time I've ever heard anything about someone not getting along was a few months ago when someone here on the forum said that Michael Dorn allegedly thought Avery Brooks was \"too serious\". But other cast members have said that Brooks was very nice and gracious to everyone on the set. I know that Rene and Nana were/are very good friends; Rene and Armin seem to be very good friends and have great fun at conventions; Siddig has said he was good friends with Colm Meaney and Andy Robinson (who was also, according to IMDB, godfather to Sid and Nana's son Django); Alaimo, Combs and Biggs seem to be quite close; Aron Eisenberg said that Cirroc Lofton didn't realize Aron was quite older than him until he saw him without makeup but by that time they were already good friends... It's a big cast, they can't all be close to each other, but generally, it seems that most of the actors were the closest with people they worked with the most, which makes sense. Yes, most of them have drifted apart, but it usually happens when people go on to do other stuff, move to other cities or even countries/continents... It's happened to me even with close friends or relatives, physical proximity is quite an important factor in staying in touch. I know that Alaimo and Combs are neighbors in addition to being good friends, but in some other cases, people live far apart and are busy doing other stuff... Yet they all, or most of them, seem very friendly to each other at conventions and have great fun. Unless it's just a great act?\n\nDidn't Visitor recently say they were like family and she'd love to do a DS9 relaunch?\n\nShe's said that in several interviews.\n\nhttp://nanavision.com/?p=79#more-79\n\nNana Visitor wouldn’t change a thing. Even if she could re-imagine her life and career in an alternate universe, she wouldn’t pull the trigger on making it a reality. And, more specifically, even if she could, she’d not dare change a thing about her experiences on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\n“I wouldn’t,” says Visitor who spent seven seasons on the show as Major Kira Nerys, the formidable Bajoran first officer aboard the wormhole-protecting space station DS9. “That show, that character really was one of the things that defined the rest of my life. Not just because I was part of this television show that people still follow, but because of Siddig, us having a child, and the people that I met 15 years ago that I still keep up with, that I still hear from all the time. It’s kind of like what college is for a lot of people. You form friendships that last the rest of your lives. Star Trek is the only acting experience I have had where this many friendships have formed and this many have stayed.\n\nhttp://dvd.ign.com/articles/387/387069p3.html\n\nIGN: We always hear about how with the Next Gen cast, it was a great family. Was it like that on the DS9 set, were you guys a family at the end? Especially with DS9, how there were so many reoccurring characters, was it a larger extended family? Was it really hard to say goodbye at the end?\n\nNana Visitor: Oh my god. The last day, I cried. I cried through the whole day. It was very hard. We were a band, a pack. (laughing) One director described us as a pack of wild dogs, as hard to control as a pack of wild dogs. He said it because when we'd see each other, we were just so thrilled we couldn't get down to working. It would be such fun just to catch up and talk and mess around, and we were such strong personalities all of us. We were a tribe, including the crew. We were definitely a tribe.\n\nConsidering two of the co-stars actually had a kid and got married (although it did end in divorce), some of those people had to like each other.\n\nWhich two was that? First I heard of this..... though I can't say I followed the DS9 cast beyond the show like I did with TNG (Though DS9 is still slightly more my fav over TNG)\n\nAlexander Siddig (Bashir) and Nana Visitor (Kira) became romantically involved and had a child together. Visitor got pregnant, so they essentially had to write in the whole surrogacy for the O'Briens thing. They later made it official by getting married, although they are now divorced. That's the only on-set romance that I know of on Deep Space Nine.\n\nWell, IMDB bio of Terry Farrell claims that she dated Michael Dorn, but I don't know if it's true since I've never seen a source for that. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000395/bio\n\nAnd it is a known fact that Max Grodenchick was engaged to Lolita Fatjo, but that's not a romance between two cast members.\n\nI think whoever said that thing about the cast not getting along was, frankly, talking out of their ass.\n\nProbably.\n\nAt worst, maybe one or two cast members weren't too keen on some other cast member, but a) it's a huge cast, not everyone is going to be everyone's best friend, and b) I doubt that anyone hates anyone else as much to let that get in the way of their professional work.\n\nPeople just love the gossip about actors from TV shows hating each other, and many will try to make up some such scandal even when there is none."
