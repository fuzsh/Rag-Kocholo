The actress, best known for her role as Jadzia Dax in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, confirmed the engagement via Twitter this week after film critic Scott Mantz made the initial announcement.\n\n“RT BREAKING NEWS!! How’s THIS for #StarTrek ROYALTY?” Mantz wrote. “TERRY FARRELL & ADAM NIMOY are ENGAGED!! May their love & union LLAP!!”\n\nIt didn’t take long for fans to react to the news. “Serious? Not fake news? Baby will be 1/16 Vulcan,” a skeptical Trekkie wrote. “Lol nope Not Fake news!” Farrell, 53, reassured followers. She later tweeted: “Thank you all for you amazingly sweet well wishes and support! May you all LLAP!!!”\n\nFarrell and her fiance have kept their relationship largely private. The Becker star retired in 2003 to focus on her family. She has one son from a previous marriage to actor Brian Baker.\n\nNimoy, 61, who has two children, is the only son of beloved icon Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock in the wildly popular franchise.\n\nRelated Articles"
