        "text": "Born on February 7, 1978, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Christopher Ashton Kutcher is an American actor and entrepreneur known for his versatility both on and off the screen. Raised in a humble family environment, he experienced a challenging upbringing which included his parents' divorce and his brother's cerebral palsy diagnosis. Despite these hardships, Kutcher's resilient spirit propelled him from sweeping cereal dust at a General Mills factory to becoming a recognizable face in Hollywood. Ashton Kutcher's acting career began as a model before landing a breakout role in the hit TV series That '70s Show. His portrayal of Michael Kelso quickly made him a household name. His success in television paved the way for a flourishing film career, where he starred in a variety of roles ranging from romantic comedies like No Strings Attached to psychological thrillers such as The Butterfly Effect. His talent was further showcased when he replaced Charlie Sheen in the successful sitcom Two and a Half Men, demonstrating his ability to step into established roles with ease. However, Kutcher's accomplishments extend beyond acting. He is also a savvy businessman and philanthropist. Co-founding the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments, he has invested in several high-profile technology startups, including Spotify, Airbnb, and Uber. Moreover, his commitment to making a difference is evident through his co-creation of the DNA Foundation, later renamed Thorn, which aims to combat child sexual exploitation. In summary, Ashton Kutcher's journey from a humble Midwestern upbringing to Hollywood fame and entrepreneurial success is a testament to his resilience, versatility, and tenacity.\n\nRobert Cletus Driscoll (March 3, 1937 â€“ March 30, 1968) was an American child actor and artist known for a large body of cinema and TV performances from 1943 to 1960. He starred in some of the Walt Disney Studios' most popular live-action pictures of that period, such as Song of the South (1946), So Dear to My Heart (1949), and Treasure Island (1950). He served as animation model and provided the voice for the title role in Peter Pan (1953). In 1950, he received an Academy Juvenile Award for outstanding performance in feature films of 1949, for his roles in So Dear to My Heart and The Window, both released in 1949. In the mid 1950s, Driscoll's acting career began to decline, and he turned primarily to guest appearances on anthology TV series. He became addicted to narcotics and was sentenced to prison for illicit drug use. After his release, he focused his attention on the avant-garde art scene. In ill health due to his substance abuse, and with his funds depleted, he died in 1968 in an abandoned building, shortly after his 31st birthday."
