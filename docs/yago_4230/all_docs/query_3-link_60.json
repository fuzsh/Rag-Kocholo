        "text": "Terry Farrell started in TV as one of two young models exploited by their grasping mothers and by a talent agency in the short-lived primetime soap \"Paper Dolls\" (1984). Farrell was also victimized as a prostitute in the TV-movie \"Beverly Hills Madam\" and in the miniseries about serial killer Ted Bundy, \"The Deliberate Stranger\" (both 1986). She coasted for a time doing series pilots, TV guest spots, and a couple of features before she was cast as Dax on the syndicated sequel series, \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" (1993-98).\n\nAlthough Farrell's alien character, featuring speckles on her face and neck and acting as bodily host to another being, was not as prominent as several others on the show, she nonetheless brought a likably placid grace to the role. One of Farrell's most visible feature roles was in Clive Barker's rollicking sequel thriller, \"Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth\" (1992). After five years, she departed the \"Star Trek\" franchise and reinvented herself as a comic actor landing the female lead opposite Ted Danson in the CBS sitcom \"Becker\" (1998-04)."
