        "text": "In Robert Cremer’s 1976 publication “Lugosi: The Man Behind the Cape” (Henry Regnery Company, Chicago), Lugosi’s son Bela Lugosi, Jr., writes in his introduction: ‘It is difficult for me to believe that Dad has been gone for twenty years. My memory is still very clear of the sound of his voice, the look of his eyes, his long stride when he was walking, his interest in me, and the magnitude of his feelings—of elation, depression, joy, and sorrow. People even recognized him walking in a dark street just by the sound of his voice.’\n\nThe father—and acting legend—he refers to, is Béla Ferenc Dezsõ Blaskó, a.k.a. Bela Lugosi (1882-1956), formerly a stage actor who first appeared before the camera in his native Austria-Hungary exactly one hundred years ago and who, a decade after his arrival in the US 1920), made film history when playing the title role in Universal’s groundbreaking screen classic “Dracula” (1931), directed by Todd Browning.\n\nThe film launched the studio’s series of horror films in February 1931, and when later that year “Frankenstein” starring Boris Karloff was released, Universal with then 22-year-old studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr., put itself further on the map, as the ‘Universal Monsters’ with Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney, Jr., became both a trademark and a landmark in the early sound cinematic landscape of the 1930s.\n\n“Dracula” (1931, trailer)\n\nBela Lugosi worked as a stage and screen actor in his native country (where he worked with director Mihály Kertése who later became Michael Curtiz), before moving to Berlin and finally making his way to America to work as an actor on stage and screen on the East Coast. A decade later he played Count Dracula before the camera, a role he would always be identified with.\n\nI met his son Bela Lugosi, Jr. (b. 1938) for an interview at his downtown LA office near Pershing Square about nine years ago. Then a 70-year-old lawyer—a reserved, very kind and highly intelligent gentleman—he generously took the time to talk about his father and about growing up as the son of a celebrity in the film community.\n\nMr. Lugosi, how do you look back to your father’s career and achievements ?\n\nMy father had a very long career before he came to America and a very lengthy career after he made “Dracula.” The difference is that his roles were very versatile the first half of his life—before “Dracula”—and were complying to the horror genre in later years, probably because he gave such a marvellous performance as Dracula, first on stage in 1927, and later on in the motion picture. When he was cast by Universal to appear in the screen version, the film marked the beginning of Universal’s horror movie success and it brought my dad a lot of attention. As a result he was cast in other horror pictures, also made at other studios, but he was never able to make the transition to other genres. I know he would have liked to have achieved success by playing a variety of roles, but he has become an icon because of his role as Count Dracula and he would have been so surprised and proud of his great popularity still today.\n\nThat’s right. Yet, after “Dracula,” he played mostly doctors, professors or counts, often referring to his portrayal as Count Dracula.\n\nYes, but it’s also because his performance of Dracula is so iconic. Had he not made that motion picture, he would probably not be remembered by so many people, so to that extent it was a blessing. Somehow it was also a curse because of the typecasting, but it did keep him employed and who knows what his fate would have been had he not made “Dracula.” He was a wonderful actor, probably he would have benefited of quite a few years of wonderful roles, had he done such a good job in a non-horror genre film.\n\nDid you ever see him at work on the set of a movie?\n\nI did watch him prepare for motion picture roles. He would study the script, go over the lines over and over again till he perfected them. By the time he got to the studio, and it was time for his scenes, he could do it in one take while the other actors in the same scene would need multiple takes. He was a viragous reader, he studied current events and a variety of subjects, and prepared his movie roles the same way he prepared his mind on a lot of different subjects. He was 56 when I was born, so he was way in his sixties when I first realized how he prepared for his work, and by the time I started observing him, he had a world of experience. That accounts for his ability to be prepared for a character or a scene. I remember when I was about ten years old, I was on the set of “Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein” [1948], and then I realized how unusual it all was. During their coffee break time, there I was sitting with Glenn Strange, who played the Monster, and Lon Chaney, Jr., who played the Wolf Man. That was a pretty remarkable experience. And when I look at his old movies now, I am still very interested to see how he mastered his craft.\n\nYou were born right here in Los Angeles. Did you also spend your childhood in LA?\n\nI lived in Los Angeles up until I was six years old. I remember playing with some local neighbors. When I was six, I was transferred to a military school where I also lived. So that was from the first grade till the sixth grade, and then I went to public school in the same community. When my parents would visit me on Sundays, the attention of the whole school was on their arrival. Later, when my mom took my friends and me to see dad’s movies, they would be scared, but to me, it was just my dad on the screen. When I moved back to Los Angeles, I was in the middle of the ninth grade. So I was pretty much a Los Angeles resident from the time I was fourteen, fifteen years old. While I was in high school, I didn’t want so much attention; I’d rather keep a low profile. But you have to know that when my father died in 1956, he wasn’t as popular as he is today. Now there’s this whole new generation that knows who he is, but he didn’t have this iconic status back then. My parents were also very much involved with the Hungarian community in Los Angeles, so we spent a lot of weekends at the clubhouse. Looking back, I can tell you that I had a very normal life as a child, and I have great memories of playing in our Los Angeles home.\n\nWhat was your father’s circle of friends like?\n\nThey were primarily artists, dancers, musicians—that type of crowd—and not the typical actor-director-producer crowd. He’d have parties in his house; they’d smoke cigars, drink fine wine, dance, but not any names of Hollywood actors and stars. And a lot of his friends were Hungarians that he stayed in touch with. He lived in Los Angeles from 1930.\n\nBut the name Lugosi will always ring a bell?\n\nI think so. Every day somebody comments about my name. He is so remembered. The fan mail that I get comes from various generations, people who have somehow been exposed to his films. I also have my own website [click here]. My father was very urbane and cultured, and he always tried to teach me something. He was a good father, very personable with people. He was not a boogie man at home; he did not bring his roles home. But it’s very unfortunate that a lot of people only remember him as he was in his later years, which were not the best years of his life. They focus on negative aspects of his life as they tend to overlook his glorious, early years when he was extremely successful. People think he was an addict, but he became addicted to morphine due to leg pains that he had resulting from an injury. Late in his life, he turned himself in to be cured, and when he left the hospital, he was completely cured. That was a very heroic effort, and I am very proud of how he took control of his life again.\n\nYour father made several films with Boris Karloff, who also became one of Universal’s legendary horror stars [“Frankensten”]. Was there ever any rivalry between the two of them?\n\nNo, none whatsoever. This was only created by the media, which made it interesting to sell tickets for their films.\n\nDid you ever consider acting?\n\nNo, I never did. I chose an entirely different profession. I am practicing law; I still do, every day [laughs]. I’m seventy now; it keeps me mentally focused.\n\nDo people still ask you about Tim Burton’s “Ed Wood” [1994] with Martin Landau portraying your father?\n\nAll the time. I liked Martin Landau’s performance, but as I told you, it is disappointing to me that people often focus on the end of his life. That’s why “Ed Wood” doesn’t do justice to my dad as he really was. Unlike the character in this film, my dad was a gentleman, he was brave, and he held on to his work ethics until he passed away in 1956.\n\nLos Angeles,\n\nMarch 27, 1998\n\nFILMS\n\nNÁSZDAL, a.k.a.
