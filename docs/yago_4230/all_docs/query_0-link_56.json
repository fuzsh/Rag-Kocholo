        "text": "Terry Farrell is an American actress and fashion model who is perhaps best known for her portrayal of Jadzia Dax in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Terry Farrell was born Theresa Lee Farrell on November 19, 1963, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. At the age of sixteen, Farrell, who was nearly six feet tall, submitted her image to the Elite Modeling Agency in New York City. She was invited to New York and had an exclusive contract with the popular women’s magazine Mademoiselle within days of her arrival. She modeled for eighteen months, appearing on the covers of the Italian and German editions of Vogue; she was also featured in several editorials of the American edition of the same magazine. In 1989, Terry studied acting with the American actress and acting teacher Stella Adler. She also appeared on television in Quantum Leap and The Cosby Show.\n\nAfter appearing on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine for six seasons, Terry co-starred in the television comedy series Becker, starring Ted Danson. Terry Farrell has been married twice, first, in 2002, to fellow actor Brian Baker; they divorced in 2015. Terry’s second marriage, to Adam Nimoy, took place in San Francisco in March of 2018. Adam is the son of deceased actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock in the Star Wars franchise."
