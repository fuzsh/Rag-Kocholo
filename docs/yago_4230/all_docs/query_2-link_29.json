        "text": "[ Ratings ] [ Terry Farrell ] [ Becker In The News ] [ Ted Danson ] [ Episode Guide ] [ Alex Desert ] [ Links Page ] [ Hattie Winston ] [ Becker Chat Room ] [ Shawnee Smith ] [ Paramount Studios Becker Site - Mirror ] [ Poll Page ] [ FAQ ] [ Australian Mirror ]\n\nMarc Wade:\n\nYour host for tonight's chat is Guy Vardaman, Producer/Product Manager for STAR TREK: CONTINUUM.\n\nMarc Wade:\n\nOn behalf of STAR TREK: CONTINUUM, we'd like to welcome Terry Farrell to our chat tonight. Ms. Farrell plays Jadzia Dax on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nWebster- asks:\n\nWhat is your philosophy of life? I know that Star Trek can tend to be a very socially oriented show (a definite plus).\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI'm only 33 so I reserve the right to change my mind. :)\n\nI believe that each experience that we have in life is a lesson. No matter what the experience is, if we shell up and we don't anticipate the results, then we will learn the lesson life is trying to teach us. So in fact, every experience is good opportunity to learn something new about ourselves.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDavid Evans asks:\n\nHere's a question: Terry, what did you do before Star Trek? I ask because I'm sure there is quite a difference in your life since then. Or is there? What is the difference?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I moved to New York when I was 17. I was a\n\nmodel in New York for 3 years, and I got my first TV series, called \"Paper Dolls,\" in 1984. I met Jonathan Frakes for the first time on the set while I was walking by.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDybsca wonders:\n\nDid you ever audition for a \"Star Trek\" part before Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nNo I only read for Dax. Nana (Kira Nerys) was already cast by the time I read for Dax.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nWARGIRL wants to know:\n\nHow has being a Trekkie icon changed your life?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nWow! Thanks for the compliment. The opportunity to work with a group of people that I think are extraordinarily talented has been one of the most enlightening experiences of my life.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nCASEYWIZZBANG asks:\n\nTerry, I am wondering do you think that Dax can keep a relationship with Worf,\n\nwhat is your favorite actor to work with, and do you know of future Dax shows on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI don't know if Worf can handle Dax on a long term basis. Although I adore working with Michael Dorn. It's up to the writers what happens to the relationship. It's a surprise every time I get a script. I apologize for not having the inside information.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nEveryone is my favorite when working with them.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nlenzs wonders:\n\nWhat do you feel has been the most significant change in your character, Jadzia Dax?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI think she changed most when the writers decided that they wanted me to be more physical in the middle of the second season, and I was very happy about the change.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nWARGIRL inquires:\n\nTell us a little bit about your family. Any cute little Trills around?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nYes, and they're only my nieces.\n\nI'm not married, not involved with anybody. My sister Chris is my best friend.\n\nI see my nieces like my daughters.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDybsca wonders:\n\nHave you had any martial arts training in preparation for the fighting scenes?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nNo, none. I constantly wing it and fortunately nobody gets hurt.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nlenzs asks:\n\nWhat would you like to see more of in the upcoming episodes of DS9?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI'd actually like to go to a planet or be off on a mission and have my own personal conflict. I very rarely am the source of a conflict, rather part of the solution to a conflict that has nothing to do with me personally.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDid you enjoy doing the Tribbles Episode? It appeared that you did.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nYes, I did. I thought it was amazing and it was very exciting to come work\n\neveryday.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\n:)\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nThat episode was the single most fun we had, as a group, filming an episode, and I loved being the instigator and having Sisko constantly reminding me that I was on the mission. (LOL) I loved the Bee-hive hairdo, and the go-go boots, I'm not sure about the mini skirt. I liked flirting with Kirk. I hope it becomes one of the fans' favorite episodes.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nBen and Sylvia Frier who recently were married right here in the Starfleet Lounge would like to know since a lot of Star Trek actors have crossed over to other series or big screen movies (such as the recent inclusion of The Doctor and Neelix in First Contact), is there any possibility that your character will ever do the same?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI asked Rick Bermen to put me in the film to fly the Defiant but the writers had a problem with what to do with me after the Defiant was disabled. But I would love to be a part of the film. I think it is hard for us to cross to Voyager simply because they are lost.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nWebster says:\n\nI've always been impressed with the Dax character because of her understanding\n\nof different cultures (after all she has lived many different lives). What are some of\n\nyour feelings on that great understanding she has?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nWhen I first started playing Dax I read some books on Taoism, and for me the understanding is really more of an acceptance of each creature's law of nature, if you will.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nTo strive, to always be non judgmental of any human being and to try as hard as you can to realize that you can't always understand because people may not understand where you're coming from.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDybsca asks:\n\nHow do you pass the time when you're sitting in the make up chair for so long? Does it tickle when Michael Westmore airsprays those spots on your neck?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nNo, there not airbrushed. They are hand painted. The time goes quickly because Michael and I are very good friends. We chat, swap recipes and gossip.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDybsca asks:\n\nDo you surf the net at all? Have you seen the web site called the Terry Farrell Internet Fan Club? There are a lot of other sites devoted you and Dax; must be good for one's ego?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI'm very embarrassed to say, that although Dax is a science officer, computer genius, among other things, Terry Farrell is not.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDavid Winchell asks:\n\nWould you like to do an episode with Q in the future, as you and he seem to be\n\nthe most favorite characters on Star Trek right now?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nThank you very much for the compliment!\n\nI would love to work with John de Lancie. I think he is an amazingly talented actor, and I would love to work with him.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nMickeySun wonders:\n\nDid Dax and McCoy ever have a relationship?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI don't kiss and tell.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nRyan Lenz wants to know:\n\nDid you enjoy the movie First Contact?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nLoved it! Loved it! Loved it!\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nHawkeyes4 wonders:\n\nTerry, what is your daily schedule on a day of filming Star Trek: DS9?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nIf I'm heavy in an episode, (if the episode is about Dax) it's generally a 14 to 16\n\nhour day. Fortunately, as you know, there are several episodes that I am considerably lighter in, so that I can catch up on my sleep.\n\nRegularly I work from Monday, I get up by 4 AM, to Friday 'til 2 AM.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nBrie Burnham:\n\nI really want you to know that you are my favorite character on DS9,[because she\n\nis exactly like me],and how did you ever get through having a crush on some boy who doesn't even known you're alive?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI don't believe unrequited love is healthy. So introduce yourself to him! Ask him out to the movies. Or look to have a crush on somebody that you know little bit better. And good\n\nluck!\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nworkoutqueen wonders:\n\nHow did you get started as an actor?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI started modeling and acting classes at the same time. I studied in both NY and LA.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nMickeySun questions:\n\nDo you think Dax should be treated less as of a sex object and instead the brilliant intellect he/she truly is?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI don't see Dax as being perceived as a sex object.\n\nAlthough I hate learning the techno babble monologue, I do miss having my\n\nscience office, and dealing with the more technical aspects of being a science officer.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nRatcliffJeffM:\n\nA lot of Star Trek fans imagine what it would be like to be an actor on a Star Trek show. What surprised you most about being a part of DS9? How was it different than you imagined?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI think the style of Star Trek and the technical language, combined with our schedules is much more difficult than I imagined. It's been a great reward to get better at it over the years because it was so difficult to begin with.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nTrent_Diamond asks if you cared about kissing another girl on the show?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI believe that story was important one to tell. The kiss was the consequence of the love story. I think it helps bring reality and depth to that relationship. I didn't find it easy but necessary.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nenterprise10 wants to know if you enjoyed doing the Hellraiser sequel?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nYeah!\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nenterprise10 wants to know if you have had any desire to direct?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nNot right now, I'd like to acquire a little more wisdom before I embark on such a large adventure.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nCraigD asks:\n\nHave you ever encountered problems with getting roles because of your height?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nYes, very often.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nWebster-:\n\nWhat are some of your future plans or hopes for a family in the future?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI would love to have a family, but first fall in love with the right guy.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nScott Eamer asks:\n\nWhat is your personal favorite episode of Star Trek, (from any of the series)?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nTrials and Tribble-ations.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDid you have to watch the old episode before you did this? Did you want to or did you\n\nnot?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nIt was on TV Saturday afternoon before we started the filming it. It was my favorite episode from my childhood as I remember. In fact, my grandmother made me a tribble.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nEHavre wonders:\n\nWhere do you hope to be 10 years from now?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI hope 10 years from now I'm still doing what I love to do...smarter and even more centered than now. Hope to spend more time with my family.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nAndrew Harbert asks:\n\nWhat was it like at the 30th anniversary special being together with almost every actor from all the series?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nIt was very exciting! One of the very few moments that made me feel like I was a part of something so big and so exciting.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nMickeySun asks:\n\nAny good practical jokes pulled at the set of DS9?\n\nLike putting super-glue on Worf's makeup?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nSometimes the suspension of disbelief is so hard that, we can't help look at each other during scenes because we make each other laugh so hard! We literally cry!\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nPatFordyce asks:\n\nWould you ever like to perform on Broadway?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nSure you got one?!!!\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nEHavre queries:\n\nIf you were trapped on an desert island and you could only bring three things with you, what would they be?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nLifetime supply of water.\n\nA man, though I can't tell you who might that be.\n\nMatches.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nPatFordyce asks:\n\nIs this what you wanted to do when you were a little girl, be an actress or did you have other aspirations?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nTo be a rock singer!\n\nI can't sing so I became an actress. I use to do a really good Stevie Nicks! :)\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDybsca says:\n\nHey, you've made it big time. You have action figures and a doll out, which by the way, don't do you justice. Do you own any? I read somewhere that you weren't being paid for products with your likeness as specified in your contract. Has that been resolved?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nWe're trying to resolve that as we speak. I have 3 dolls and have seen them.\n\nI don't like how the spots don't go into my hair, and that's not my nose.\n\nI love 'em though, so I can always play with myself.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nChronon asks:\n\nWould you rather be acting on stage, TV or in film?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI have never had the opportunity for stage, although I would love to try it.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nTV and Film, the project is more important than the medium, I love them both.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nScott Eamer asks:\n\nDo you date men shorter than you?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nYes!\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nCraigD asks:\n\nDo you ever want to go back to Modeling?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nIf it was that right job and money.\n\nBecause it was kinda fun. Rather be a Cover Girl again. It was a lot of fun.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nEHavre wonders:\n\nDo you read all fan mail people send you? Do you send autographs to people if they write to you?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI hired a fan mail company. Please, don't be offended. But it's too much mail for me to answer on my own. If you send a letter, you get a 5X7 picture. SASE-I will sign it and return it to you.\n\nMarc Wade:\n\nSend your request to: Terry Farrell, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Paramount Pictures, 5555 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90038.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nMickeySun:\n\nHave you received any marriage proposals from people you don't know??? If not, will you marry me???\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nYes and no thank you, I don't think we know each other well enough.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nCaptnerys asks:\n\nWho have you learned the most from (within the Star Trek family)?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nLeVar Burton has taught me a lot! Not only about acting but spirituality. Avery Brooks, as a friend, has helped me to grow a lot as a person.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\n(LeVar has directed several DS9 Episodes)\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nSOLOMONSMITH says:\n\nAll I want to know is, do you have a favorite tea?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nCelestial Seasoning: Bengal Spice\n\nWith honey and milk.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nMiki Nishihata asks:\n\nWhat was the most times you had to redo a scene?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nThe episode with the female Ferengi \"Pel\" who was disguised as a male. A scene I had with her took 32 to 35 takes and she was very ill.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nEHavre wonders:\n\nWho is your favorite actor/actress?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nVanessa Redgrave\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nCM asks:\n\nWould you ever date a Nuclear Engineer?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nDo you destroy things?\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nSilverfish asks:\n\nDo you value your private life more now that you have fame?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI've always valued my private life. When I did Paper Dolls I lost my anonymity so I tend to become very reclusive.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nDavid Winchell asks:\n\nWill you be in very many conventions in 1997? Will you be coming to Washington state soon?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI don't have one scheduled in Washington, however I did visit Seattle and I think you have a wonderful state.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nEHavre asks:\n\nIf there was one word to describe you, what would it be?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI'm speechless...Avery always asks, \"How many people are in there\" referring to how many personalities are in me. So if he can't think of one, I don't know how\n\nI can.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nSilverfish asks:\n\nDo you regret your affiliation with Star Trek at all because of possible typecasting?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI think actors are worried about typecasting.\n\nThey would never be able to work if they were so worried. If I'm typecast as a strong, intelligent, dynamic and wild person that is as unpredictable as Dax, I'm fine with that.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nHawkeyes4 wants to know:\n\nWho was your role model when growing up?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nMy mother and grandmother.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nJared Harris was wondering about your views on the future of Deep Space Nine; how much longer the series is going to last or if you and the crew are going to appear in any upcoming films?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nOnly six seasons in our contract. Only time will tell.\n\nI don't know about any films.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nMickeySun asks:\n\nWill you be involved in anything other projects besides Star Trek?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nI did a CD ROM game called Treasure Quest.\n\nIt has a million dollar prize that hasn't been solved yet.\n\nAnd this summer, I did a USA movie called \"Reasons of the Heart\".\n\nI will be looking for a project this hiatus as well.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nsmackin_north wants to know:\n\nAre you close friends with Nana Visitor and is the birth of baby O'Brien going to be a major plot point in an upcoming episode?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nThe birth is featured in an episode.\n\nYes I consider Nana Visitor a close friend of mine. We've been through a lot together.\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nPatti Schmidt wants to ask you if you think Dax will ever have a love interest?\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nIf you don't know about Worf, I think he might be upset to find that you think I need a love interest.\n\nMarc Wade:\n\nWe'd like to thank Terry Farrell for joining us here tonight.\n\nTerry Farrell:\n\nHappy Hanukkah!\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nI appreciate your support and I wish you all happiness, good health and fulfillment in whatever you pursue.\n\nOnward and upward-\n\nTerry Farrell\n\nGuy Vardaman:\n\nWe've had a great time with Terry, Hopefully she'll join us again in the Future! Thanks Again.\n\nMarc Wade:\n\nThank you very much for participating in tonight's Special Event.
