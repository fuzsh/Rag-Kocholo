        "text": "What a strange, deep and ultimately very moving episode.\n\nFor reasons that have nothing to do with Deep Space Nine, I am coming to each weekly episode with a high degree or reluctance. It’s getting to feel like an imposition rather than an enthusiasm. But almost every week, I’m drawn into the story despite myself, and end up grateful for having watched, despite sometimes being resistant to the ideas inside the story.\n\n‘Sons of Mogh’ began with Worf and Dax in combat in the holosuite, arguing over the merits of different Klingon weapons. It’s pretty much one part battle, one part flirtation, with Dax providing most of the latter. This is something I’m finding myself less and less in sympathy with, having come to see this kind of flirtation as game playing, more akin to maintaining a power advantage than developing a potentially intimate relationship, especially when Worf is completely outmatched on that score, but let that pass by.\n\nThis scene is interrupted by Odo, calling Worf to the airlock to handle a drunken Klingon demanding to speak to him. This is Kurn (Tony Todd again, under heavy make-up), Worf’s younger brother, and he is here for Mauk-to’Vor.\n\nThis is a specifically Klingon ritual. Worf’s defiance of Gowron has cost his family, the House of Mogh, severely. It has been razed to the ground, stripped of lands, possessions, it’s seat on the Council, it’s honour. Worf has his life with and in the Federation, the softness of which Kurn mocks bitterly, but only he can restore Kurn’s honour, by giving him a ritual death, by sending him to Sto-vo-kar, the Klingon heaven, from which he can move forward to his next life, with honour renewed.\n\nWorf is Klingon enough to recognise the duty and the necessity of that. He prepares the ritual and plunges the dagger into Kurn’s chest. But Dax, having realised what is going on, intervenes, and by beaming Kurn to the infirmary, saves his life.\n\nSisko is furious with Worf, and Dax, and threatens to have him sent away. Cultural diversity is one thing, and he will stretch as far as he can, but Sisko cannot see further than the human viewpoint, that this is nothing but murder and completely unjustifiable.\n\nThis was another point at which I diverged from the episode. The evident seriousness of the Sons of Mogh, the words that accompanied the ritual, and Kurn’s obvious pain in a world in which the one thing he needed in order to be whole was the one thing impossible for him, impressed itself upon me, and made the purported death more than murder. Sisko’s outburst, containing as it did a degree of human self-righteousness, came over as being cultural imperialism, of exactly the kind that put me off The Original Series all those many years ago.\n\nBut having done Mauk-to’Var once, Worf found himself incapable of repeating it, and needed to find a purpose for his younger brother. Getting Odo to take him on in security seemed a possibility, but when Kurn allowed himself to be shot, still seeking death, that option was rapidly closed off.\n\nAt this point, the storyline merged with the rather scanty B story (trust DS9, the week after I praised its confidence in dispensing with these, to revive the idea!). Major Kira, doing a lot of very elegant lounging around, rocking that one-piece uniform, and the Chief come across a strange explosion in space and a highly-defensive Klingon warbird, from which it’s extrapolated that the Klingons are sowing the Bajoran space border with cloaked mines, preparing to cut it, and DS9, off once war comes.\n\nIn order to explode (literally) the plot, the team needs the armament codes, so Worf and Kurn teleport aboard a damaged ship and steal these. Acting against his own people only shames and depresses Kurn even more, but it is Worf who is more deeply shocked by the experience. Kurn had saved his life by killing a Klingon officer who Worf believed was standing down. Worf has changed, irrevocably, thanks to his life in the Federation. He has lost his Klingon instincts, the ability to sense when someone has decided to kill you by looking in their eyes.\n\nThe discovery is devastating. He has long kidded himself that he could straddle the line, could walk either side of it, but now he realises that this is a fantasy. He has lost too much of what it is to be Klingon. He can never return there, can never revive the House of Mogh.\n\nThe realisation makes him understand even more acutely what Kurn feels. Worf has the Federation: Kurn has nothing, literally nothing. Without Mauk-to’Var, there is only one outcome for Kurn, and after a final conversation, in which Worf prevents his brother from the dishonour of a drunken suicide, Bashir eradicates all Kurn’s memories of his old life.\n\nWhen he wakes, amnesiac, Noggra, and old friend of Mogh, is waiting to claim him as his son, Rodek. He will teach ‘Rodek’ all his ‘lost memories’ as a son of the House of Noggra. As ‘Rodek’ leaves, he passes Worf, and asks him if he is part of Rodek’s family. Worf replies, “I have no family.” It’s a moment of unutterable sadness. Kurn has back everything he wanted, everything he had lost, his honour. Worf has cut his last ties, against his own will, but for the sake of his brother. The camera pans with him as he walks down the Promenade, surrounded by crowds.\n\nQuite simply, an excellent episode.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis time it was more me: I’m having a bit of difficulty summoning up enthusiasm at present, so I wasn’t best receptive to an episode that I thought was better than last week’s Quark-focused bore-fest, though apparently ‘The Sword of Kahless’ wasn’t well-received by its audience at the time.\n\nThis is the first Worf-focused episode since Michael Dorn joined DS9, and in light of what is to follow, it’s interesting to see that the only other cast member prominently featured was Jardzia Dax. That probably wasn’t part of some deep-laid, long-term plan, but rather that the third player in this three-hander was her old blood-brother, the Klingon Kor (another splendidly rumbustious performance from Jon Colicos).\n\nKor is on the trail of the legendary, and quasi-mystical Sword of Kahless, an ancient bat’leth used to overthrow a tyrant, lost for at least 1,400 years, and whose return is prophesied to herald a new era of glory for the Klingon Empire. Jardzia, who confirms that Kor’s lead may well be genuine, introduces him to Worf, whom Kor befriends – any enemy of Gowron is a friend of mine – and agrees to take along.\n\nThe bat’leth is found surprisingly easily and somewhat early in the episode, but that was my preconceptions at play, since the intent was not to make an ‘Indiana Jones’ movie out of this (though the influence is clearly present) but to focus upon the effect the artefact has on both Kor and Worf.\n\nTemporarily imprisoned on this distant planet, prevented by jamming from teleporting back to their runabout by a small band of Klingons looking to steal the glory of discovery from them, the two Klingons both find themselves laying claim to the Sword: not to bring it to the Emperor but to wield it themselves, to take over the Empire and lead it to glory.\n\nThegrowing tension, squabbling and rivalry between the pair only increased Dax’s irritation until, like a mother with toddlers, she takes the toy away so neither of them can have it. I realise that that’s not the comparison the show was aiming for, but that’s how it came over. Most of the second half of the episode consists of increasingly irascible conversations as the trio work up and down a limited number of already familiar cave-sets, supposedly a complex natural underground labyrinth. The sets restrict the field of vision, restrict the room for action, making things very talky, and were apparently a bugger to film in a limited time (several scenes from the original script had to be edited out because they would have taken too long to set up: these might have made it a bit more complex an episode).\n\nUltimately, the trio escape, and more importantly the Klingon pair escape their madness. In an unfortunately perfunctory manner, which can only be attributed in-episode to Dax losing her rag and phasering the idiot pair, they agree that the Sword is too damned dangerous to discover right now: if it can cause two such fine and upstanding characters to fight like angry cats, what will it do to the Empire?\n\nSo Dax teleports the bloody thing into space to float around, awaiting discovery again, and Worf sententiously prophecies that this will be when the Sword knows it is needed, and that’s your lot for another week.\n\nThe episode didn’t go down well at the time, though its critical reputation has risen since. It was the first Worf-centred episode supposedly because it was the first to be written after Michael Dorn signed up to the series, a proposition I can’t entirely accept, given that he’s essential to the season premiere. It also features a hard-ass, fighting machine Dax, encouraged by Director LeVar Burton to let it rip, in a style that Dorn and Colicos delightedly dubbed “Action Barbie.”\n\nBut, as I said upfront, something I struggled through rather than enjoyed, but an episode that, despite its clear flaws, deserved a bit better than it had from me.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’m no Star Trek expert but this latest DS9 episode struck me as curiously old-fashioned. It was a plain, little-adorned hard-SF story, more suited, I thought, to old-style conceptions of SF as spaceships and hardware, and after the succession of recent stories, I’m afraid I found it a little hollow.\n\nThe MacGuffin was that the Defiant, with everyone on board except Odo, was in the Gamma Quadrant for a secret trade negotiation with the Karemma, in the person of Minister Hanok. In order to avoid the Dominion wrath, the Karemma trade via Farengi intermediaries, i.e., Quark, whose skimming and scamming is slowly bankrupting them.\n\nThat’s the set-up. The meeting is interrupted by two Jem’Hadar ships trying to destroy the Karemma vessel, the Defiant tries to protect it and everyone ends up in the turbulent, high-velocity wind, radiation-heavy upper atmosphere of a gas giant planet. Instrumentation and electronics are badly disrupted, the Defiant crippled, and the two sides engage in a careful, slow-motion battle to see who wins.\n\nWithin the story, the cast break down into pairs, with the story cruising betwen one set and the other. On the dead Bridge, Sisko is concussed and Major Kira is trying to keep him awake by talking to him. Doctor Bashir and Jardzia Dax are sealed into a turbolift and cuddling up together to delay freezing to death. Quark and Hanok debate trade, morality and gambling in the Mess Hall before defusing an unexploded torpedo sticking through the hull. And Worf runs the ship’s defence from the Engine Room, with a little learning from Chief O’Brien about the difference between Bridge crew and Engineers.\n\nThe latter part was the only really significant part of the episode since it showed part of the process of Worf adjusting to the difference between a Starship and a Space Station (ironically whilst being on a Spaceship).\n\nBut in the end it didn’t seem to amount to much, with most of the character-beats being predictable and rather flat: Julian used to chase Jardzia but doesn’t any more (really? well I never!) Nor did much come out of Nerys’s discomfort around Sisko, over his being the Emissary, although in her disheveled, stressed state, she looked gorgeous, and the many close-ups on her face were not at all a hardship.\n\nOne real criticism I do have to make concerned Sarah Mornell, as Bridge Ensign Carson. The Ensign has quite a speaking role in the first half of the episode, until the Bridge is damaged by Jem’Hadar attack about halfway through, and Sisko is hurt. She goes to find medical assistance for him, and just vanishes from the episode without explanation, but for one, line-less appearance in the background after it’s all over.. It’s very sloppy writing, given how much screen-time she’s had so far for a traditional Star Trek red-shirt and a black mark for the story.\n\nI don’t rate episodes, but if I did, ‘Starship Down’ would be something between a C+ and a B-, as neither having any long-term significance nor any great weight of itself. Which makes for a pretty perfunctory review, I’m sorry to say.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nGiven that the title, ‘Rejoined’, clearly indicated that this would be a Jardzia Dax episode, and given my previous comments about the acting skills of Terry Farrell, I did not approach this episode with great expectations. But I was wrong to doubt, as this was another high-quality episode, with a strong, if muted message (without a B-story, please note), and Farrell was, against my expectations, better than up to the task of the emotions her part called for.\n\nThe open tried to make something of a mystery about what was to come. A Trill science team are coming to DS9 to try to create the Universe’s first artificial wormhole and Sisko is warning Dax of it, and offering her the chance to scoot off on leave for a month or two, because the project is headed by Dr Lenara Khan.\n\nThe inference is supposed to be that there is some hostility between Dax and Khan, and when they first meet (Susannah Thompson, looking very austere but fetching), the stiffness is apparent in how they don’t greet one another. But, given a lifetime of watching American television and understanding how they deploy their tricks, not to mention eighteen months of DS9, I got there ahead of the sting: Khan is Dax’s ex-wife.\n\nThe episode and the relationship was intended as an allegory for homosexuality and the ‘taboo’ against that, though I confess that that aspect went straight over my head. Given that I’m watching twenty years after the fact, in an era in which attitudes are far more relaxed (for however much longer), that may have been more than just insensitivity on my part, because given the force of the taboo imposed by trill society, my thoughts were directed to the Incest taboo. Especially given that the punishment for Reassociation, as the Trills saw it, was exile,and refusal of transplant for the symbionts – the imposition of a death sentence by a society built upon the needs of the symbionts, against their Trill hosts – was so severe, far more than any imposition on homosexuality even in the mid-Nineties.\n\nAnd I was also defected from the intended allegory by the way that no-one seemed to think there was anything remotely wrong about two women falling for one another, which I thought advanced for American network TV of the era but appropriate for the future in which Star Trek occurs.\n\nThe story was put together to provide a firm basis for emotions that threatened to override so severe a taboo. Needless to say, neither Jardzia nor Lenara had any prior connection, but their symbionts had previously been married, but that Nilani Khan, Lenara’s immediate predecessor, had been married to Torias Dax, and that the marriage had ended with Torias’ death on a test flight his wife had warned him against undertaking.\n\nSo it had been a prematurely disrupted love, broken off at its heights, leaving considerable residual feelings that slowly but surely drew Jardzia and Lenara towards each other: unfinished business, the most painful and powerful.\n\nThompson was superb, and Farrell not half bad at showing two people with an immense attraction towards each other slowly relaxing more and more into first enjoyment and then an increasing dependency upon each other’s presence. The attraction is primarily emotional but, as if this were itself a taboo the show was hesitant in showing (which it was), it spilled over into the physical, with the actresses sharing sharing a long (closed mouth) kiss that I frankly didn’t expect. It was, apparently, one of the earliest lesbian kisses on American TV, though it came as part of a wave of gay themes and kisses (women only), and was the most controversial aspect of the episode.\n\nBut we always knew that it couldn’t last, that the relationship would have to end. After almost losing Khan in a project accident, from which Dax had to risk her own life to save her love, Jardzia was ready to abandon everything, to pay the penalty to be with Lenara. But Lenara wasn’t. Quite apart from the serial status quo that had to be restored, it was too soon, far too soon, to have two characters living together without punishment or pain in a lesbian relationship. She left. Dax stayed, looking on silently, being brave and heart-broken, an image that Terry Farrell sold beautifully.\n\n‘Rejoined’ has been praised for the courage it took to do this at all, for the message of acceptance of a same-sex relationship that it presented, and criticised for its failure to go further. From twenty years on, I can sympathise with those who criticise the half-heartedness ‘Rejoined’ embodies, and maybe it could have been a little bolder, but in the context of the times, of American network television, it’s difficult to see it going much further.\n\nAnd in reading up about this episode, the contrast is drawn with future events: when Farrell left DS9 after season 6, by which time she was in a relationship with Worf, it was suggested that Dax be joined to a male host, partly in order to re-explore this same question from the other side, but this was rejected. It was ever thus: female homosexuality, which always carried with it a frisson of titillation for a male audience, is far more acceptable than even the thought of two hairy, sweaty men…\n\nAgain, an excellent episode. I am really enjoying Deep Space Nine Tuesday at the moment.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAnd without a pause we roll on into season 4 of the great DS9 rewatch, the midpoint of the show’s run, and it’s all change. Captain Sisko’s shaved his head, there’s a new and slightly fussier credit sequence, Siddig el Fadil is now going by the name Alexander Siddig, which puts him back in the credits so he’s now next to Nana Visitor, his missus (aww!). And, oh yes, enter as Strategic Operations Officer: Lieutenant Commander Worf, played again by Michael Dorn, after a year of inactivity since the end of Next Generation. All change. And a pretty bloody good double-episode of high seriousness, drama and consequence to kick us off with a perfect demonstration of what Deep Space Nine should be like, week-in, week-out.\n\nThe open started with what I initially thought was a flashback to last season’s final episode and the station-wide hunt for the Changeling, though the object of the hunt turned out to be Odo, and the whole thing a training exercise. It was an effective re-orientation for viewers after a summer off, but had no relation to the story which suddenly developed. A Klingon ship decloaks off the station, and its Commander, General Martok, requests shore leave for his crew. The Captain readily agrees. Then the rest of the Klingon Fleet decloaks…\n\nThere’s something going on. Sisko doesn’t really believe Martok’s claim that they’re only here to defend the Alpha Quadrant against the Dominion, there’s no discernible evidence of any activity at present. Martok’s hiding something so Sisko decides to seek outside help. Enter Worf.\n\nThis season was set after the Star Trek: Generations film (the only one I saw in the cinema, and the request of an old friend who didn’t want to go on her own), in which the TNG Enterprise had been destroyed. Worf has been on retreat until summoned to duty: he is seriously considering resigning his commission, in conflict between his natural Klingon beliefs and temperament and his duties – and his honour – as a Starfleet officer.\n\nThis is a very Worf-oriented episode, as was only to be expected. The heavily serious, yet uncharacteristically doubting Klingon is the fulcrum through which almost everything moves, with the lighter scenes being used as relief from the wholly serious plot. Into this category comes a scene in which Dax tries to get Kira into a holosuite programme with toyboy Trills giving great massages (I bet they do, I bet they do! Say no more!) which is mainly notable for getting both ladies out of uniform and flashing a bit of flesh: shoulders mainly, and some leg.\n\nFor once though, the balance is well-maintained, and even the Quark bits are decently portrayed, and at least in character.\n\nBut we are starting off the season with a major geo-political shift that will direct the overall flow of the show throughout the next twenty-six episodes and beyond: the downfall of the Obsidian Order on Cardassia (in s03 e21) has led to the overthrow of the Central Command and the establishment of a Civilian Government (with Gul Dukat as Chief Military Advisor, naturally), and rumours of civil war and uprising.\n\nThe Klingon Empire cannot believe that a civil uprising can, on its own, overthrow a military government. It is obvious, to them, that this is a move by the Dominion, that the civil government is led by Changelings. Their plan is simple: to invade, and take over the Cardassian Empire.\n\nThe Federation intends, at first, to stand by and not get involved, and that extends to DS9. Sisko cannot stand by: he takes the Defiant, including Worf on its bridge, to rescue Dukat and the Civilian Council. This involves battle with a number of Klingon vessels.\n\nIt also involves the threat of war. Martok’s fleet, joined by Chancellor Gowron, demands the Council be handed over. Sisko refuses. In the past year, DS9 has upgraded its defences immensely. There’s a brilliant sequence of preparation for attack, full of the calm black humour of those facing a deadly situation. Worf has burned his bridges with his people, but he has retained his Honour. The battle is intense, including hand-to-hand combat on the Bridge.\n\nIt is all what the Dominion wants. Three of the powers of the Alpha Quadrant turning on each other, weakening each other, making the path to conquest so much easier for the Founders (we can leave the Vulcans and the Romulans out of this, apparently).\n\nIn the end, DS9’s resilience, and the imminent arrival of their reinforcement first, forces Gowron to withdraw. But the damage is done. Though they remain mutual enemies to the Dominion, the peace between the Federation and the Klingons is broken. And the Klingons are retaining several of the Cardassian colonies they overran. Like it or not, they are now a factor in the vicinity of the Wormhole.\n\nAs for Worf, he still plans to resign, until Sisko’s empathy over the fundamental reasons – the loss of the Enterprise and that crew – persuades him otherwise. Worf transfers from a gold shirt to a red, sets his foot upon the path of command, reorients the dynamic of the cast.\n\nI’m looking forward to season 4.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWith the season’s end almost upon us, a lightweight, character-oriented episode prior to the big finish, and any potential cliffhanger, was to be expected, and we got this in a Jardzia-centric episode in which everyone’s favourite Trill goes through a ritual that enables her to meet and talk with, in chronological succession, each of the previous hosts of the symbiont, Dax.\n\nIt was an interesting notion but one that, for me personally, never quite came together.\n\nThere were several reasons for this, but the primary one is the same old reason, that Terry Farrell simply isn’t a good enough actress. Her range is not wide enough, her emotional depth is not deep enough. This is all but three full seasons in and she hasn’t developed enough to play roles that require more that competent functioning.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, there was the imbalance of parts. Dax has had seven previous hosts. The technical process by which Jardzia ‘meets’ them is by having a Guardian extract each host’s memories and superimpose them on a willing host, for which Jardzia chose the seven people closest to her, i.e., the main cast, except for Jake Sisko, in whose place we got, improbably, the dabo girl, Leeta.\n\nShe got to contribute a pretty face and a supple body to the unnamed host who was a gymnist (that’s what she said, people not gymnast). The rest – the Major, the Chief, the Doctor, Quark – just did quick pantomime turns, enjoying the Mirror-Universe-esque chance to play against type for the sake of it.\n\nBut also these turns went by so fast and so briefly that it rather undermined the point, so that by the time we got to the heavier stuff, for which the episode had really been written, the active mind was detached from the storyline, and wasn’t being tempted back.\n\nThe first to get anything more than a sideshow was Juran Dax, accepted by Commander Sisko: Juran was a deranged murderer who tries to kill Jardzia. But this is just a prelude to the one Jardzia really is afraid of meeting, her immediate predecessor, Curzon, Sisko’s old buddy.\n\nWith good reason. Curzon originally failed the young Jardzia as a potential host but, when she determinedly reapplied, did not oppose her, making her the only Trill ever to be readmitted to the joining programme. Jardzia doesn’t know why, and is afraid of finding out the reason. Supposedly, she feels inferior to her predecessors (though the underwritten previous scenes make you wonder what she’s got to feel inferior to about the gymnist and the mother, not to meention the psycho!)\n\nReally, it’s Curzon who’s the problem, and we can see a little of why that is when he ‘joins’ with Odo, who promptly turns Trill, with spots, and discernible features, and goes all roguish and rakish, eating, drinking, gambling, avoiding Jardzia’s questions, and ultimately deciding (with Odo’s agreement) to stay where he is.\n\nThis forces Jardzia to confront CurzonOdo and demand her memories back, at which point the air is cleared and the secret is out: Curzon fell in love with the young and beautiful Jardzia, still is in love. He chucked her out because it was inappropriate, allowed her back because he felt guilty, tells her she’s remarkable (not that she is, shes just a pretty woman with limited acting skills). The explanation did not convince at all.\n\nI’ll pass over the close, with a deeply embarrassed Odo talking to a serene Jardzia and just mention the understory, which was once again slight, especially in terms of the time it was given, but which was more substantial in concept. This was about Nog taking, and failing, his preliminary exams for acceptance into Spacefleet Academy, except he only failed because Quark gimmicked the programme against him, leading to a long overdue furious confrontation with Rom, threatening to burn the bar down if Quark ever screwed around with Nog’s future like that again. Nog passed with the proper programme, of course.\n\nSo to the season climax, next week. I know nothing of it thus far except it’s title, ‘The Adversary’, from which I am expecting something very strong. Don’t correct me if I’m wrong.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI had hoped for an excellent two-part story in ‘Past Tense’, and maybe a one-episode telling would have tightened things up and enabled the story to do more with the sense of tension that was for the most part missing. Instead, I thought the story was loose and baggy, and entirely too predictable in its beats and conclusion.\n\nPutting it very simply (though the first part made time to explain in a very scientific bit of gubbins how it happened), Sisko, Dax and Bashir beam down to Earth for a conference at Spacefleet HQ in San Francisco but arrive in the City in 2024 instead.\n\nThe trio are quickly separated, Sisko and Bashir hauled off by the Police into a ghetto-like Sanctuary District, where the poor, jobless, homeless and mentally ill are kept out of the way. Dax, on the other hand, is taken in hand by a suspiciously friendly and helpful tech billionaire who, for no reason whatsoever (I mean, he dresses Dax up in a very short mini-skirt and doesn’t even make the least move towards lifting it any further) who aids here to find her friends.\n\nSisko and Bashir are in a version of Hell, a useless, wasteful existence of subsistence, rivalry and near-fascist rule. But Sisko, who has conveniently studied every era of human history, recognises the period as being mere days before the highly-significant Bell Riots. These were named after Gabriel Bell, who led a rising in Sanctuary District A, who saved hostages’ lives at the cost of his own, and started the historical movement towards a better, fairer society that led to the Federation.\n\nInteresting times, eh? And all Sisko and Bashir have to do is lay low, not get involved and not, repeat NOT change the future.\n\nOf course, you know what’s coming. There’s no need even to have read Terry Pratchett’s Night Watch, there isn’t a story without this happening, and didn’t Kirk and Spock go through something similar over Joan Collins getting run down by a car in Harlan Ellison’s justly (in)famous ‘City on the Edge of Forever’ in TOS? (Which is apparently referenced in part 1 via a poster for a boxing match also seen in 1967).\n\nSo: Sisko and Bashir get attacked by thugs, a guy wades in to help them but is stabbed to death. He’s Gabriel Bell so Sisko takes over his name, his place in history and his eventual fate (oo-er).\n\nMeanwhile, back in the correct century, Kira, O’Brien and Odo, who are trying to a) find out where their colleagues have gone and b) how to get them back, suddenly lose the Federation, thanks to the change in history. Which doesn’t affect them because of the same scientific gubbins that started this whole thing off.\n\nNeedless to say, they have x number of options and y number of time jumps (y being a smaller number than x) and hit the right time on the last shot of course. Not that they have anything to do with the finale: the National Guard storms the Sanctuary, freeing the hostages and killing all the leaders, except ‘Bell’, who is improbably spared by the polieman Vin, a deeply bitter and cynical guy, contemptuous of everyone lower than him, stubborn in his beliefs, who undergoes a Damascene conversion when the story most needs a deus ex machina.\n\nAnd Vin swaps ‘Bell’s tags for a dead man, so that everybody will think he died, and history can snap back into place with no change except for ‘Bell’s face in historical records.\n\nThe show ends with Bashir asking the honest question of how the US Government allowed this situation to develop in the first place, and Sisko, with his best despairing/philosophical voice on, fudging the story in the best fudging style by saying, ‘I wish I knew’.\n\nWhat I found interesting, when the pattern of US society in 2024 was first demonstrated, was that when this episode was first broadcast, the setting was thirty years into the future. Now, September 2024 is only eight years away. If Donald Trump were to be elected next month as President, the events of this story would take place in the final year of his second term. I, for one, would look no further.\n\nBut no, an interesting premise awkwardly handled and unable to come up with anything but the easy route down Cliche Boulevard. A shame.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAfter last week’s dramatic and dynamic episode, this week we got a silly, inconsequential story that probably needed to be anchored to concrete pilings to keep from being wafted away by the breezes. Though it overused the silly brush a bit too much, the whole thing was generally good fun to watch, without ever pretending to a dramatic element.\n\nIt was all there in in the open, which was a round robin slice of life giving no clues as to the direction of the eventual story and relying upon a sting ending when Ambassador Lwaxana Troi (Majel Barratt, gleefully chewing the scenery as ever) arrived on the station.\n\nIt’s the day of the Bajoran Festival of Gratitude on DS9, Major Kira presiding. Jake’s miserable because his dabo-girl girlfriend, Marta, has gone off to college 300 light years away. Kira is eagerly awaiting the arrival of Vedek Bariel, who she plans to spend every minute she’s not presiding by shagging him into a husk. Chief O’Brien has similar plans for the two day break that Keiko is back from her botanical project on Bajor (his unexpended energy is being displaced into so many racketball games that Doctor Bashir’s arm is practically falling off, and you can keep that lewd thought in your head, please). Odo is starting to get all wistful over the Major. Oh yes, love – or certainly lust – is in the air. Enter Mrs Troi.\n\nThe Ambassador is here to see Odo, ostensibly to help him through the discovery that his people are the Dominion, but in reality because she has feelings for him. Unfortunately, she also has Xanthi fever, a disease that affects mature Betazoids and causes them to project their emotions onto others, overriding their true feelings.\n\nThus, every time Mrs Troi winces at a headache pain, the nearest person to her gets a brief jabbing pain above the eye and immediately sets off in hot pursuit of the nearest love object.\n\nSo the 16 year old Jake decides that the problem with Marta was that she was too young and gets the hots for Kira Nerys (this need not have had anything to do with Xanthi fever, especially as Nana Visitor spent most of the episode out of uniform), Bariel starts panting after Jardzia Dax (who gets to deck him with a single punch), whilst the Trill (with leopard spots going all the way down to her neckline) starts making google-eyes at a clearly embarrassed Sisko.\n\nAs for Nerys and Julian, played by a future married pair of actors, they get a mutual dose and get to snog and grope each other something rotten. No tongues, though.\n\nEven Quark gets in on the act, flapping his ears at Keiko O’Brien, who was wearing the red dress Miles wanted her to wear and demonstrating clearly why he wanted her to wear it, though that only serves to give the game away.\n\nYes, the O’Briens were an interesting component of this episode. As I said, they were reunited after two months apart, for only two days before another four months separation and the reunion did not start at all as the eager Chief wanted to. Keiko was tired, and also troubled about how to break it to her hubby that the dig might be extended by another two to three months. Miles, thrown off balance by the way Keiko was nothing like as pleased to see him as he was her, didn’t know how to handle this and pretty much flew off the handle.\n\nI could sympathize with him: I went through something similar pretty much thirty years ago, and the bafflement and heartbreak weren’t hard to empathize with. With all the lust sloshing round, the prospect of the episode’s one genuine couple going down the tubes was a necessary corrective. Eventually, O’Brien resolved it the only way you can resolve it, by putting the other one first and trusting in their love. Which is why Keiko wore the red dress, leading many of us to regret that she doesn’t do that more often.\n\nLike I said, inconsequential. The episode is said to be based very loosely on A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and I can see the point of contact once it’s pointed out to me, but it’s a far looser fit than anything Happy Mondays ever sang about. Typically, it ended on a serious note that managed to be poignant. Mrs Troi’s projected amours were directed at Odo, who was unable and, giving his hidden feelings for Kira, unwilling to respond. Majel Barratt dialled it down beautifully in recognising that her feelings were not reciprocated, like those of Odo, and admitted that she would wait and hope for second best. She surprised him with a kiss, which Odo received awkwardly, but afterwards found surprisingly tender, one more moment that resonated with me.\n\nReset and resume next week.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThough I initially found myself enjoying this latest episode of DS9, long before the end I had come to find it tiresome, and well below the standards of season 3 thus far.\n\nFor this episode, the team reverted to the old trick of parallel plots, completely unrelated to each other, which immediately suggests that neither is really strong enough to stand up on their own. Unfortunately, the two tales were so far apart in tone, approach and physical space, they were unable to lean on each other. It was a bit like that old sketch on the BBC Radio comedy Hallo Cheeky, where the gag was that due to timing running late, three completely disparate programmes would be broadcast simultaneously, the mike cutting between the three performers to create wonderfully idiotic double entendres.\n\nThis one wasn’t funny, though.\n\nThe sub-plot certainly wasn’t, although that was supposed to be the comic story, and was led-off in the open. Tiron (the first of multiple appearances in differing roles by Jeffrey Cmbs), an alien ‘colleague’ of Quark’s, fancies himself a great deal, but he also fancies Major Kira more than somewhat, so she resorts to pretending Odo is her lover to throw him off. Thwarted, Tiron – a study in self-regarding petulance from his alien make-up onwards – demands a custom holosuite programme from Quark, starring the Major.\n\nMuch hilarity (hem-hem) ensues as Quark tries to get a holo-profile of our favourite redhead, but by the time he succeeds, Odo and Kira know enough of what’s going on to blow the deal by tinkering with the programme to give Tiron the legs of the Major (at least, I hope that was Nana Visitor) but the head of… Quark. Boom boom.\n\nIn the main, and serio-tragic part of the story, the rest of the cast is in the Defiant, exploring the Gamma Quadrant when a planet, Meridian, literally pops into existence before their very eyes. Meridian alternates between dimensions, one the corporeal universe of the Gamma Quadrant, the other a non-corporeal dimension where the diminished population, even the planet, exists as purely consciousness.\n\nUnfortunately, something is out of balance. Meridian has been incorporeal for sixty years, but its physical state will last only twelve days before it shifts back for another sixty years. Needless to say, if you’ve only got a body for twelve days every half century, it makes things like conception, pregnancy and birth a bit dodgy, which is why the Meridianites are down to only 30, and not much of a gene pool.\n\nOne of those thirty is Teril, a widower. Teril is strong, handsome, virile and played by a young Brett Cullen, with whom I’m much more familiar for his recurring role as Nathan in Person of Interest. Teril quite clearly fancies the knickers off Jardzia, and she’s not entirely disinterested in his underthings either. But, wait, this is not merely lust at first sight (how could it be in a prime-time series from 1994?), it’s real, genuine, actual love.\n\nTeril decides to leave to be with Jardzia, but his conscience troubles him over his people, his home, his friends. So she decides to stay with him, take leave of absence from Starfleet for sixty years. It’s a tremendous, loving sacrifice, but the problem with this story, with all such stories, is that this is part of an ongoing, prime-time TV series and it’s impossible to vest a moment’s emotion in the course of the story, because you know she’s never going to leave with him, and what’s more, this love-of-eight-lifetimes will be forgotten by as early as the next episode.\n\nThe dramatic tension is negligible.\n\nIn the end, Meridian starts to shift into phase but Jardzia doesn’t. Indeed, she’s acting like an anchor, holding the planet back and threatening to destroy it until she’s teleported out. End of story, except for Jardzia’s heartbreak. I just need time, she tells Sisko, adding sotto voce ‘sixty years’, which would be moving if it even got as much as sixty seconds before the credit roles.\n\nThis half of the story was well-made and well-formed and could have been good if it had been possible to develop any kind of investment in the possibility of Dax going with Teril. Since that was zilch, so too was the episode. There’s always next week.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere was nothing in the least bit significant about this week’s episode of DS9, either in terms of the larger background of the Dominion threat, any sociological or political attitude, or even the standalone storyline itself. It was purely and simply a ‘bottle episode’, confined to the station itself, with no guests beyond two recurring Cardassians, Gul Dukat and Garak. Which made it an entertaining, unpretentious little delight.\n\nThe story began with Chief O’Brien and Jake Sisko working in one of the lower level processing units, attempting to reclaim it, and in the meantime wiping all the now-redundant Cardassian programmes from its computer. One programme refused to be deleted: in fact, the attempt to remove it triggered it, and it was a doozy.\n\nBecause this programme was an automated defence programme, complete with pre-recorded messages from the then-Commander, Gul Dukat, warning the ‘Bajoran workers’ who have attempted to seize control that their revolt will not be allowed to succeed.\n\nAnd it escalated from there. The Chief, Jake and Sisko himself found themselves trapped down there, and having to bust out to avoid a fatal dose of neurosene gas, which triggers further fail-safes affecting the Bridge, and trapping Major Kira, Jardzia and Doctor Bashir behind similar force-fields.\n\nNot to mention trapping Odo in his office, along with his suspicious and most unwelcome visitor, Quark.\n\nThat gave us three groups operating in isolation from one another, with the tension ratchetting up every few minutes as yet another attempt to beat the system being interpreted as further success by the mythical Bajoran workers (the Major must have been so proud) requiring yet more escalated response. All the way up initiating the self-destruct of DS9 itself.\n\nNo-one’s going anywhere, no-one’s getting anywhere, and the odds are getting slimmer all the time. Garak’s personal codes let him wander through the force-fields at will, but his attempts to beat a system keyed to Dukat’s personal codes and no other’s only accelerate the process.\n\nThen, look what happens! A cocksure Gul Dukat teleports onto a phaser-strewn Bridge in response to a distress signal from himself, near to laughing his head off with delight at just how fucked up everything is for the Federation (and Garak). Sure, he’ll use his codes to shut everything down, in return for a minor concession or two, like official permission to instal a garrison of 2,000 Cardassian troops on board.\n\nOf course, that’s an utter no-no. Dukat thinks he has the upper hand even though Kira is fully-prepared to let everyone on board be killed by the Defence programme rather than let the Cardassians back. He’ll just teleport back to his ship, put his feet up, wait for her to change her mind when there’s, say, five minutes to go. Except that, in a gloriously and hilariously ingenious twist, the programme interprets the attempted teleportation as an act of inglorious cowardice by Station Commander Dukat, trying to flee his post, and blocks not only the teleport but all Dukat’s codes, rendering him as helpless – and doomed – as everyone else.\n\nIn the end, it’s Sisko who saves the day (you mean, you really thought the station would buy it? There’s another nineteen episodes left in this series alone) restoring everything to normal, after forty-five minutes of harmless, inconsequential fun.\n\nIt’s a text book example on how to bring in an entertaining episode of a series at absolutely minimal cost, which is what ‘bottle episodes’ are about. A splendid time was had by all. I enjoyed it.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
