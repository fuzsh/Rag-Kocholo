        "text": "[quote] I like the Progressive commercial how not to become your parents.\n\nWhat's there to like, R1?\n\nI hope that campaign backfires in Progressive's face as its middle-aged and older clients transfer their insurance policies to more inclusive brokers in reward for the latter not stooping to generational derision and division in advertising at this critical stage of our Democracy. Younger people, too, should reconsider purchasing 'Progressive;' the firm is anything but.\n\n\"The medium is the massage\"\n\n[quote] So not only do Our Eldergays remember minute details of TV shows that aired 35 years ago, they remember the commercials that ran on them too,\n\nIt’s memorable because it was genuinely clever, so it stood out in a dead of dross.\n\n[quote] think it is fascinating that so many older gay men have such complete memories of TV from 30, 40 or even 50 years ago.\n\n[quote] There was a thread on Mad Men, which I watched religiously at the time and found had to google many of the plot points--and that was less than 10 years ago.\n\nI grew up in Detroit in the seventies. There were three network channels, plus PBS (which no one watched), plus a number of independent channels consisting mostly of reruns, and low-cost local programming, like a host for late-night horror movies.\n\nThat Wendy’s commercial ran as cable opened up more channels, but even that including lots of documentaries, or stuff like MTV, which was nothing but videos (yes, MTV once ran music videos!). Chances are, anything you saw, millions more also saw, and it would be repeated and discussed.\n\nBy ten years ago, there was a lot more original content, which the three networks already being the lowest-tier in quality. There’s a lot more to watch now. My phone plan just gave me HBOMax, to go alongside the Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Disney+ services I already have. We’re drowning in content theses days, so it’s harder to remember any one thing.\n\nThank you for attending my Ted Talk!"
