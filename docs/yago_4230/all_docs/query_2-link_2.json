        "text": "Terry Farrell was born on November 19, 1963 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. At age 15, she became a foreign exchange student to Mexico, and, from that experience, she decided she would like to live a more adventurous life in the big city. She sent several photos to a modeling agency and then, at age 17, dropped out of high school and became a model in New York. She is most famously known for her role as Jadzia Dax in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), but she did have some acting experience before that. In 1992, she had the starring role in the horror movie Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth (1992). She appeared in several television and straight-to-video movies, and also dated actors Michael Dorn and Mickey Rourke while on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993). Afterward, Paramount decided to move her to the sitcom Becker (1998), where she played the character Reggie Kostas, but, after four seasons, she was replaced by Nancy Travis. In September 2002, she married Brian Baker, better known as the cell-phone company Sprint's spokesperson, and retired soon after. They divorced in 2015."
