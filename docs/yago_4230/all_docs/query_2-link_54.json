Though maybe that doesn't fall under the heading of romance.\n\nDidn't Patrick Stewart marry one of the producers briefly?\n\nPatrick Stewart dated Jennifer Hetrick (Vash) during the 3rd and 4th seasons of TNG (I'm not sure when they broke up). There are references online to the two of them even being engaged during the filming of the 4th season episode \"Qpid.\" Stewart was married to TNG producer Wendy Neuss from 2000 to 2003.\n\nWarmest Wishes,\n\nWhoa Nellie\n\nPatrick Stewart dated Jennifer Hetrick (Vash) during the 3rd and 4th seasons of TNG (I'm not sure when they broke up). ]\n\nSee, I knew you'd come and tell us all about this. I couldn't recall if I'd dreamed their real life romance after one too many Whoa Nellie stories."
