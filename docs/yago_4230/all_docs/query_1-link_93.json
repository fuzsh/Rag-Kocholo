Cmdr. Jadzia Dax in the controversial Trek spin-off series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, which Adam has recently filmed a documentary about.\n\nTalking about keeping it in the Trek family.\n\nThe news was broken by film and TV critic Scott Mantz on Twitter, before being confirmed by Farrell herself in a series of excited tweets.\n\nNimoy has yet to comment on his own Twitter account.\n\nLeonard Nimoy played Mr Spock in Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation for over 20 years, and even featured in the first Star Trek revival film and its sequel Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nThe actor sadly passed away in 2015 before production on the upcoming TV series Star Trek: Discovery could begin.\n\nHis son, Adam Nimoy is director of the upcoming Deep Space Nine documentary, What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek Deep, which explores the changing legacy of Star Trek's Deep Space Nine.\n\nHe has two children, Madeline and Jonah, from a previous relationship.\n\nHe also appeared in a Spock tribute episode of The Big Bang Theory and is the director of For The Love of Spock, a documentary in memory of his late father."
