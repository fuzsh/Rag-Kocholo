        "text": "Heading into the Prolific Trek, I knew that, of all of Star Trek’s 30 seasons, the ending of Season 6 of DS9 would hit me the hardest. Losing Jadzia Dax, one of my all time favorite characters, is absolutely devastating. I knew I wouldn’t be up for writing much of a season review post after the conclusion of the season, but, as they say, the show must go on.\n\nI’ve been meaning to write a post discussing the Jadzia/Worf relationship for some time now. What better time to do so than while lamenting Jadzia’s death?\n\nStar Trek has never been about the romantic relationships between its characters. That is, Star Trek is not Grey’s Anatomy where the entire show is unilaterally focused on whether Meredith and McDreamy will finally get together. However, throughout the course of the multiple series, the shows do place their main characters into romantic relationships. Some of them are fantastic and well-developed (B’Elanna/Tom, Kira/Odo) others are, perhaps, less so (Miles/Keiko, Tripp/T’Pol). With all due respect to Troi/Riker, my favorite romantic relationship on all of Star Trek is almost certainly Worf and Jadzia.\n\nTerry Farrell and Michael Dorn showing they have just as much chemistry in April 2016 as they did when their show was on the air in the 90s.\n\nLooking back, a relationship between Worf and Jadzia seems inevitable. As the host of the Dax Symbiont, Jadzia has significant influences from Curzon, and there probably hasn’t been a non-Klingon in all of Federation history more steeped in Klingon culture and lore than Curzon Dax. By the time Worf comes onto the Station, the audience has also seen that Jadzia, too, respects and understands Klingon culture and traditions. In fact, in Worf’s first episode, Jadzia greets him by speaking in Klingon (telling him that she is better looking than Curzon), and then, Worf finds Jadzia’s Skeletor/Klingon workout program:\n\nJadzia: So, how did you like the program?\n\nWorf: I found it adequate. Although I was surprised to find a Klingon exercise program on the holo-suite.\n\nJadzia: It’s mine.\n\nWorf: You mean Curzon’s.\n\nJadzia: No, I mean it’s mine. Computer, Bat’leth. I thought you might be tired of fighting holograms.\n\nWorf: It would not be a fair match.\n\nJadzia: I’ll go easy on you.\n\nWorf: Very well. Defend yourself.\n\n[They begin fighting]\n\nJadzia: I hope you’re not holding back because I’m a woman. If it makes things any better, think of me as a man. I’ve been one several times.\n\n–Deep Space Nine, The Way of the Warrior\n\nJadzia is, in many ways, a Klingon with Klingon abilities and strength, but she is, admittedly, unconventional. She is a Trill, and she is in Starfleet. She’s like Worf in that sense, as Jadzia observes when they are discussing Klingon opera:\n\nWorf: It is the power of his voice, the strength of his intonation that makes Barak-Kadan a great singer. There are none like him.\n\nJadzia: None as boring anyway. He never varies his performance… Not even a half-tone.\n\nWorf: I prefer traditional opera performed in the traditional manner.\n\nJadzia: You know, for a Klingon who was raised by humans, wears a Starfleet uniform, and drinks prune juice, you’re pretty attached to tradition. But that’s okay, I like a man riddled with contradictions.\n\n–Deep Space Nine, Looking for Par’Mach in all the Wrong Places\n\nJadzia and Worf are a both riddled with contradictions. They reflect each other in this aspect. Worf clings to tradition because he is a Klingon who was raised to be an outsider. Jadzia has come to tradition because one of her previous hosts respected and learned Klingon traditions, but as Sisko does eventually remind her, she isn’t Curzon.\n\nI love that the writers created these two as near mirror images of each other: outsiders who want to fit in. But I also love how they develop the relationship. Long before we see the two characters developing a romantic relationship, there is a friendship between the two. At one point, Worf and Jadzia join the Klingon Kor on a search for the legendary Sword of Kahless, and then later we see that they spend time training together in the Holo-suite and debating the various merits of different Klingon weapons:\n\nJadzia: So you think I was overconfident?\n\nWorf: You were overconfident. You thought distracting me with your outfit would gain an advantage.\n\nJadzia: My outfit?\n\nWorf: Um, I thought that. I mean… I only assumed that…\n\nJadzia: You thought I wore this for you? Talk about overconfidence…. Worf? Gotcha…\n\nWorf: Movek.\n\nJadzia: But in my defense, you do try your own tactics of distraction, what with all that shouting and growling you do.\n\n–Deep Space Nine, Sons of Mogh\n\nThis is one of my favorite moments in their entire relationship. It isn’t anything special, and it certainly isn’t remarkable as far as their overall storyline. In fact, I find the episode Sons of Mogh to generally be pretty forgettable outside of that singular moment. That said, this moment is nice because it really lends credence to the friendship that the two developed before becoming romantically involved. Although it is clear that Jadzia is interested in more of a relationship from Worf by the time Looking for Par’Mach comes around, there is no unrequited love like the Odo and Kira relationship.\n\nInstead, they are equals. They challenge each other, and they can both tease each other. It’s also a relationship where each is secure enough in himself/herself that they can tease each other about personality quirks and even Become a bit exasperated by the stubbornness of the other:\n\nWorf: I have a sense of humour. On the Enterprise, I was considered to be quite amusing.\n\nJadzia: That must’ve been one dull ship.\n\nWorf: That is a joke. I get it. It is not funny, but I get it.\n\nJadzia: I don’t know if I can get used to the new you. It’s kind of eerie.\n\nWorf: Your problem is you cannot accept change.\n\nJadzia: I can’t accept change?\n\nWorf: That is correct.\n\nJadzia: Oh, you’ve got to be kidding. I’ve changed bodies six times, Worf.\n\nWorf: Yes, but you are still very set in your ways.\n\nJadzia: And look who’s talking.\n\nWorf: Well, I do not have to sleep on the same side of the bed every night, or brush my hair exactly fifty strokes every night, or eat the same thing for breakfast every day, or read the last page of a book before the beginning, or lift up the\n\nJadzia: I get the point. I don’t know how you can live with someone so monotonous.\n\nWorf: It is not easy. That was a joke.\n\nJadzia: This is going to be a very, very long trip.\n\n–Deep Space Nine, Change of Heart\n\nBut it’s not teasing and good-natured ribbing. Being with Jadzia changes Worf. When he is with his Par’Mach’kai, bravery means something different. When he is on a mission that is vital for the Federation’s success in the Dominion War, Worf chooses to put his wife’s life ahead of his duty as a federation officer:\n\nSisko: Could you have made the rendezvous?\n\nWorf: Yes.\n\nSisko: Yet you turned back to save Jadzia?\n\nWorf: Yes.\n\nSisko: Were you aware that the information that man had could have saved millions of lives?\n\nWorf: Yes.\n\nSisko: So what happened?\n\nWorf: You may not understand.\n\nSisko: Try me.\n\nWorf: You were at my wedding. You heard the story of the first two Klingon hearts and how nothing could stand against them, and how they even destroyed the gods that created them. I have heard that story since I was a boy but I never understood it, I mean really understood it, until I was standing in the jungle with my heart pounding in my chest and I found that even I could not stand against my own heart. I had to go back and it did not matter what Starfleet thought or what the consequences were. She was my wife and I could not leave her.\n\n–Deep Space Nine, Change of Heart\n\nThe Worf who first stood on the bridge of the Enterprise in TNG’s pilot episode would not have sacrificed his duty to the Federation for anything, but our favorite Klingon has finally learned what it means to love wholly and completely. This is a huge step for someone as duty bound as Worf. Thus, it is clear what Jadzia means to him.\n\nLooking back on moments like these are what make Jadzia’s ultimate death seem all the more pointless. I could go on and on about what this relationship has meant to Star Trek and how the writers managed to develop it. Instead, I’ll just leave it with Jadzia’s final words that show the potential we lost:\n\n“Our baby would have been so beautiful.”\n\n–Jadzia Dax, Deep Space Nine, Tears of the Prophets\n\nThe Good:\n\nSacrifice of Angels\n\nYou Are Cordially Invited\n\nChange of Heart\n\nIn The Pale Moonlight\n\nThe Sound of Her Voice\n\nThe Bad:\n\nResurrection\n\nStatistical Probabilities\n\nValiant\n\nTears of the Prophets\n\nThe Characters:\n\nMan. Talk about a punch in the gut. Of all the character deaths on Star Trek (admittedly, there aren’t many), Jadzia’s is the cheapest and most infuriating. She doesn’t even get to go out in a blaze of glory worthy of her bravery and intelligence. It’s an insult to the wonderful character that they developed over six seasons that she’s dropped senselessly in the Bajoran temple because Rick Berman got irritated.\n\nThat being said, Season 6 is once again a triumph of character development. In my Season 5 review, I made the case that Sisko is a Slytherin because he’ll probably do more to achieve his ends than any character on the show, and he’ll certainly do more than any of the Captains. We see this in full force in In the Pale Moonlight when Sisko metaphorically gets into bed with Garak in order to get the Romulans on the side of the Federation in the Dominion War. It’s a powerful character moment, and ultimately Sisko did the right thing for the entire Alpha Quadrant. But man, he sure as hell didn’t do it the right way. If you haven’t seen In the Pale Moonlight but have any passing familiarity with Star Trek, I highly recommend that episode above most others.\n\nIn addition to the marriage of Worf and Jadzia, Kira and Odo finally consummate their relationship. When I was at the Chicago convention, Nana Visitor and Rene Auberjonois took some time to discuss the development of that relationship. Nana was pretty opposed to the relationship at the time, and she was certainly opposed when it was originally proposed way back in the early seasons. Nana wanted Odo and Kira to remain just friends in order to show that:\n\n“There can be deep and loving friendships between men and women that don’t go the romantic route.”\n\n–Nana Visitor on her initial opposition to the Odo and Kira relationship\n\nAs an actress, Nana clearly thought that they could show something more than a romantic relationship. However, Nana is currently binge watching DS9 with her husband who has never seen the show, and she admitted that, as a viewer, she realizes that the writers really had no choice. The chemistry between Nana and Rene was so obvious and fantastic that you can’t help but root for the characters to get together. It’s a good reminder of how our perspective on certain things is shaped on our experiences.\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\nJadzia: A traditional Klingon wedding with all the trimmings is something Worf’s been thinking about since he was a boy. It probably has something to do with being raised by human parents. In any case, when it comes to Klingon tradition, Worf is very sentimental.\n\nKira: Worf?\n\nJadzia: All men are sentimental. They just cover it up with scowls and clenched jaws.\n\n–Deep Space Nine, You Are Cordially Invited\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nIt really sucks that Season 6 ends with a cheap and unnecessary death because its 6.77 rating doesn’t do its brilliance justice. By season 6, DS9 has become very serialized, and I submit that this is probably some of the best writing in all of television. The development of The Dominion War is always intriguing, but the show manages to include character development and lighter moments at well. In many ways, it doesn’t feel very “Star Trek” (a fact that has been highlighted as I’ve begun Voyager), but I enjoy the storytelling overall.\n\n#LLAP\n\n(Featured/Header image from You Are Cordially Invited, credit to startrek.com)\n\nWell, if you’re reading this post, then I probably didn’t scare you off with my crazy ramblings about my experiences about Thursday and Friday of the Star Trek convention in Dallas. So, thanks for coming back.\n\nThey don’t release the schedule for the convention until nearly the day before. So, I can’t say that Saturday was the day I was most looking forward to heading into the convention, but once I got a chance to view the schedule, Saturday became the one I was most looking forward to. It contained panels of all the actors I so desperately wanted to meet, and the day was going to finish with a karaoke party.\n\nThe Rat Pack performance on Friday night got over a little late, and I was afraid I was going to be dragging in the morning. But it turns out that putting Terry Farrell as the first panel in the morning will get me out of bed no problem.\n\nIt seems that at every convention with Star Trek actors, some sort of “prank” occurs during a panel. Maybe an actor will sit in the audience of a panel and heckle or may come out and join a panel halfway through just for the heck of it. There weren’t many of these pranks this weekend, but the best one was when, instead of Terry Farrell walking out onto stage when she was announced for her panel, Michael Dorn came out to thunderous applause.\n\nThe grin on Dorn’s face still makes me smile. These guys really know how to have a good time.\n\nDorn and Terry giving us a little Worf/Jadzia fan service.\n\nDorn played Worf on TNG and DS9, and his character had amazing chemistry with Jadzia. They are certainly one of the most iconic couples in all of Star Trek. So, it’s a lot of fun to see them play up that relationship. It’s also nice that they still seem to get along so well. Plus, Terry affectionately refers to Dorn as “tall, dark, and chocolate.” How can you not love that?\n\nTerry’s panel was wonderful (not that I’m biased or anything), and I loved hearing her grasp on Jadzia. I have to imagine that one of the most difficult species to play would be a Joined Trill. At the start of the show, Jadzia was a 28 year old science officer, but she was also host to a symbiont that was on its 8th host. Terry explained that she had no idea what to do with Jadzia but neither did the writers. So, in Terry’s words, “we kind of found [the character] together.”\n\nTerry also lamented the way the writers depicted her relationship with Major Kira Nerys. It was an interesting point that Kira and Jadzia’s relationship often tended toward nothing more than gossipy females, and Terry recognized it could be so much more.\n\n“She’s a terrorist, and I’m an old man.”\n\n–Terry Farrell on the Kira/Jadzia friendship\n\nOf course these panels were full of questions from audience members, and Terry was very kind during these. It was terribly sweet when someone with an obvious disability came down to ask a question, and Terry went to them to help and give one-on-one attention. She has a kind and generous heart.\n\nOn her funniest scene: besides hitting Worf’s Mom, Terry liked the time when she bit Michael Dorn’s lip. On the best part of being on set: Avery Brooks (Captain Sisko) when “he’s all singing and shit.”\n\nTerry’s panel was truly one of my favorites. I loved that she had given such thought and consideration to her character. Again, like listening to the actors who spoke on Fruday, she really made me want to go watch her episodes and see Jadzia in a new light.\n\nI must confess that I skipped a few panels after Terry’s. Not that James Darren (Vic Fontaine) and Chase Masterson (Leeta) would have been interesting, but one of my goals from the weekend was to get the autographs from all the TNG crew on the limited edition artwork from Trektacular. So, since they would all be on stage in the afternoon, I figured slipping to the vendors room was a safe bet.\n\nIn a weekend full of highlights and adrenaline rushes, one of the best times was just standing in line for the chance to get a few precious seconds with the TNG actors. I grew up watching these guys on TV and just getting to say hello to them is amazingly surreal.\n\nMost of my interactions with them were pretty short, but I loved my conversation with Marina Sirtis (Troi). It was just a few quick moments, but she was very kind. During autograph signing sessions, the conversations can feel very rote and you just get pushed through without much more than two or three words. But Marina was great. She offered to personalize my picture, which no one else did, and she even chastised the others for failing to do so. It was a nice moment, and I genuinely appreciate Marina reaching out a bit.\n\nGetting to speak with Jonathan Frakes was similarly surreal. I was wearing my Parisses Squares (a physical and dangerous sport in the Star Trek universe), and he loved it. He wanted to read the whole thing, and he assured me that, while he has “seen a lot of Star Trek shirts,” he had never seen the one I was wearing. It’s a pretty cool experience to have a celebrity you idolize love the shirt you’re wearing. It also further solidified how well some of these actors know Star Trek. For him to know what Parisses Squares is and to recognize it on a shirt requires more than a passing knowledge of his own scenes on the show.\n\nMy interaction with Frakes led me to purchase a photo op with him. While I’ll always have the memories (and blog posts) of these moments, I really enjoy getting photo ops to really solidify the time. And what better opportunity to get a photo with Jonathan Frakes than after he gushed about my shirt? When I went to the photo op some several hours after our interaction, he recognized me and my shirt immediately. He even made the comment that he had seen my tweet about liking my shirt. That’s just one of those surreal moments of connecting with someone I grew up watching on TV.\n\nI had to laugh when I finally got my copy of this photo. My smile is so big. It’s very representative of how much taking this picture meant to me and how much fun I was having.\n\nAfter getting my autographs, I attended the Star Trek costume contest. I didn’t enter, but I definitely wanted to be there. Man. Trekkies can do some really creative costumes. There literally wasn’t a person who looked amazing, but the ones that really stood out to me were: a woman dressed as Kai Winn from DS9 acting perfectly in character; Amanda (Spock’s mom) with a remote control Horta; two Pakleds; some Klingons; a girl dressed as Kirk from The Trouble With Tribbles complete with a hoop skirt completely covered with Tribbles; and an absolutely perfect Captain Pike inside a moving wheel chair. The Tribble-Kirk and Captain Pike were my favorites.\n\nHe looks exactly like Captain Pike did in The Menagerie.\n\nThe costume contest was a lot of fun, and as it was running long, Max Grodenchik (Rom) and Aron Eisenberg (Nog) in full Ferengi dressed ended up crashing the contest because their panel was after the contest. Speaking of Rom and Nog in full costume, that’s one of the cool things I had previously read about Creation Entertainment doing at their conventions. Quite often, they’ll have guest stars who played significant Klingons or Ferengi and have them come out onto stage in full makeup. Max and Aron certainly took their task to heart and came out on stage (after the costume contest) doing a cornily-written skit about the two Ferengi having landed in Dallas, Texas in the 21st century. It was a true sign of how much fun Star Trek actors can be.\n\nRom and Nog in full costume.\n\nOne of the coolest things about the Ferengi panel for me was that Max and Aron told the audience that we could ask questions of them, but they said the questions could be addressed to either Max and Aron or Rom and Nog. It definitely takes a pretty deep understanding of the characters and the show to be able to answer questions generally in character.\n\nIn addition to being a very funny and amusing panel, Max and Aron also took some time to be very serious, and Aron gave some of the most emotional moments of the entire convention. He legitimately teared up discussing his favorite moment in all of DS9. He referenced one of the episodes in early DS9 where Captain Sisko is mad that his son is spending time with the “bad influence” Nog, but when Sisko finally catches Jake and Nog together, he sees that Nog is learning to read from Jake. This moment isn’t one I think of when considering the greatest moments of DS9, but after listening to Aron describe the moment from his perspective, it was easy to see why it would be so moving. His discussion of prejudice and not judging people by their appearance was truly impactful. I definitely teared up just listening to him talk about it.\n\nAron, who received a kidney transplant at the end of 2015, also gave the perfect reminder of why Trekkies are so amazing. His girlfriend had started some sort of a gofundme page to raise money to help with their living expenses during the kidney transplant, and many Trekkies donated. Aron gave truly heartfelt thanks to the crowd. He was truly so emotional he could barely get the words out, and he pretty much acknowledged that he owes his life to Star Trek. As I’ve mentioned quite a bit lately, I think Trekkies are some of the greatest people on the planet, and it’s wonderful to see how the meaningful ideals the show has espoused have really paid off in real life.\n\nLater in the day, the first three TNG panels occurred. Michael Dorn and Marina Sirtis; Gates McFadden; and Jonathan Frakes all had panels. I’ve seen Marina and Dorn (or as she calls him, “Dornie”) do a panel together before, but I still enjoyed watching them, too. Now that I had an idea of how abrasive and opinionated Marina can be when she’s on stage, I was able to truly enjoy their panel without being shocked by her nature. They didn’t have a whole lot new to say, but they did spend a few minutes talking about one of my favorite TNG episodes: Parallels. It was great to get to see what they had to say about that, and I’ll have a few little moments to watch for when I get there in a few seasons.\n\nMarina and Dornie. These two play off of each other very well. It’s easy to tell that they’re friends outside of their work.\n\nGates came out dancing for her panel, which was kind of fun to see. She was similarly very interesting, and I really loved that one of the audience members asked her about her experiences choreographing the movie Labyrinth. Gates also spent a significant amount of time discussing the personality conflicts that she encountered during season 1 of TNG, and she also discussed what it meant for her to come back. This was particularly interesting for me. I’m currently slogging through Dr. Pulaski during season 2 of TNG, and it was certainly timely to get some more information on what led Crusher to leave the show temporarily. Gates also lamented that the Dr. Crusher of season 1 was nowhere to be found when she came back for season 3. She noted that the relationship with Picard had essentially been written out of the show, and so many other strong aspects of her character had been watered down. I’ll be interested to see if her claim that the writers didn’t really find Beverly Crusher again until nearing the seventh season. Gates has long been one of my favorite actresses on TNG, and my experiences meeting her for the first time at Trektacular are probably a lot of why I find cons so fulfilling.\n\nI wish I’d gotten a better picture, but here’s the “Dancing Doctor.”\n\nI’ve already written pretty extensively about Frakes in this post, so I won’t belabor much of his panel. He was, predictably, wonderful. The one thing that stood out to me about Frakes was that, every time an audience member came up to ask a question, he would walk to the end of the stage and sit on the edge. This brought him nearly face to face with the audience member, and I thought that was a nice personal touch that really made him feel more human.\n\nMe with Connor and Dominic before karaoke. These two guys had pretty obviously started partying ahead of karaoke, and they were having a wonderful time with this photo op.\n\nThe night ended with a karaoke party hosted by Dominic Keating and Connir Trineer. Those who were at the convention might not believe this, but I’m not one for karaoke. I mean, I love singing songs, but karaoke isn’t my thing. I’m a bit of an introvert. One of my goals at this convention was to be a little more outgoing and reach out to people. Apparently, it’s really easy to make friends at a Star Trek convention. The rush of adrenaline and shared interests makes forming fast friendships easy. I was also blessed with wonderful people who I had assigned seats next to, and we all really enjoyed ourselves. As part of this goal to be more outgoing, I’d kind of psyched myself up to do the karaoke.\n\nSo, aided by some liquid courage, I got up on stage with a group called “Texas Trekkies” and sang Dead or Alive. Sherri, one of the girls who had seats in front of me for the entire convention, and I then got up on stage and sang Sweet Caroline with Connor Trineer. Let me tell you, there is nothing so surreal as singing karaoke with a celebrity in front of a huge group of people. That’ll be a moment that always sticks with me, and I’m glad I was there for it.\n\nEveryone had a good time at karaoke.\n\nSunday was the final day of the convention, and I couldn’t help but enter it with an air of disappointment. By the time Sunday came around, I’d already had the greatest vacation I could imagine. Thus, Sunday could only mean one thing: the end. Despite my disappointment at my vacation finally coming to an end, Sunday was still another wonderful day at the Con.\n\nSunday kicked off with the final TNG panel: Levar Burton who plays Geordi. Frankly, this panel was probably the disappointment of all of the panels. I really enjoy the character of Geordi, and I do like Levar. But it felt like he came out with a chip on his shoulder and an axe to grind, and he wasn’t terribly interested in talking about Star Trek. It’s nice to hear him talk about Reading Rainbow and Roots, but I came to hear about Star Trek. He certainly had some really deep thoughts regarding racism and slavery that gave me a little more perspective. But it was perhaps a little heavy and preachy for a panel. Levar did, however, make one of my favorite quips of the weekend. Apparently, Brent Spiner (Data) served as Levar’s best man at his wedding. Jonathan Frakes, Patrick Stewart, and Michael Dorn served as groomsmen. According to Levar:\n\n“My wedding photo kicks the hell out of your wedding photo.”\n\n–Levar Burton\n\nYes it does, Levar. Yes it does.\n\nFor the next panel, JG Hertzler and Robert O’Reilly came out onto stage dressed as their characters Martok and Gowron. Except, they really didn’t “come out on stage” instead, while the band played Born to Be Wild, they ran through the audience like rock stars, acting like crazy Klingons, and singing along. They are two great character actors, and it wouldn’t be difficult to believe actual Klingons were going through their motions.\n\nThe Klingon panel was extremely high energy. They spent a lot of time doing a variety of bits including dueling Shakespeare and their “cock fighting” joke. These two have a very physical brand of entertainment, and they ran across the stage and were extremely loud and boisterous. It was kind of a nice break from some of the more serious moments of a lot of the panels. I spent 90% of it laughing so hard I thought I was going to pee my pants.\n\nConnor Trinneer and Dominic Keating had the next panel. After my experiences with these guys on the day before, I was more excited than ever to see their panel. They didn’t disappoint. While neither seems to have a huge connection to Star Trek (which, I suppose, isn’t surprising given the show they were on), they were engaging and funny. Dominic had a running gag throughout the majority of the panel where his answer to any question was that he would have “killed Trip [Connor’s character] sooner.” As if it hadn’t been obvious from the day before, these two are clearly very good friends, and they have an extremely good rapport. Enterprise has always been my least favorite of the Star Trek series, but I can honestly say that, after meeting Connor and Dominic, I’m really looking forward to getting there on the Prolific Trek.\n\nI don’t really know what to say about the next panel. It was a huge score to get Walter Koenig (Chekov) to come to this convention, and I was genuinely excited to see him. If all goes according to plan, I will have met all of the living TOS actors by the end of the year. As we’ve lost so many recently, that’s an accomplishment I’ll be happy to finish. But, honestly, watching Koenig’s panel was the hardest part of the entire weekend.\n\nKoenig is now 79 years old, and he’s really struggling to get around. It’s extremely jarring to watch someone I associate as a kid with a haircut straight out of The Monkees to have aged that much. By the end of the panel, Walter had perked up a little bit, and he was able to do a very minimal dance for the audience. I’m so glad Walter came to this convention, but it’s kind of tough to watch someone like that get older.\n\nThe entire convention finished with Shatner’s panel. I’ve written before about my experiences seeing Shatner’s one-man-show, and so, I wasn’t just terribly eager to get to see him again. However, Shatner is, if nothing else, quite an entertainer. At 85, he’s sharp as a tack and appears to be in relatively good shape physically. He’s an extremely engaging and fun guy to watch.\n\nThe Man. The Myth. The Shat.\n\nShatner also got very serious with the audience for part of his panel. I don’t specifically remember what the question was that had him talking about it, but he really started to discuss the importance of only doing things he wants to do. Basically, his advice was to not waste your life not being completely present and doing things that fulfill you. I got chills when he said, of sitting on stage at a convention, “I am exactly where I want to be right now.”\n\nShatner has a bit of a checkered past with Star Trek. I know for some time he resented being on the show, but he’s really started to embrace fans and his experiences as Captain Kirk. He’s never going to be my favorite captain, but there’s no Star Trek without Captain Kirk. And seeing him finally be at peace with that role was extremely moving.\n\nI also think the death of Nimoy has impacted Shatner in ways we’ll never understand. He took some time to defend Leonard’s publishing the infamous I Am Not Spock book. According to Shatner, Nimoy never hated the role of Spock. Instead, he struggled with the fact that people only saw him as Spock when Leonard was an amazing artist, photographer, director, and person. And, you know what? I get that. If your life has been drilled down to the point where the entire universe only sees you as one microscopic aspect of your life, that has to be hard.\n\nFinishing the day with Shatner was the way to go. The convention ended with the beginning of Star Trek, and it’s amazing to think this thing has been going on for 50 years. And we are still here today going to conventions and worshipping William Shatner and all of the characters that followed.\n\nAfter Shatner had finished his panel, we had the opportunity to get autographs from Shatner and the Klingons as part of our ticket package. We then went upstairs to grab food from the hotel bar. As we were sitting there, JG Hertzler and Bob O’Reilly sat down at the table next to us. And then, as I tried desperately not to stare, I overheard part of their conversation. They were talking about Star Trek. Not just about the convention. They were having an honest to goodness conversation about TNG and DS9.\n\nStars: They’re just like us.\n\nAnyways, I had intended to include a wrap-up and reflection on my weekend at the end of this blogpost, but I’ve far exceeded the number of words I like a blog post to be. So, I’ll be back in a few days with a much shorter post about my feelings on the weekend. I’ve also finished Season 2 of TNG. So I’m due to write a blog post about that, too. Guess it’s better to have too many posts than too few, right?\n\n#LLAP\n\nI may have just experienced the best weekend of my life. I don’t take that phrase lightly, and if this wasn’t the best weekend, it is certainly the most memorable.\n\nI’ve been to a handful of Comicons, and I’ve blogged about my experiences of two of them. I’ve met Star Trek actors and blogged about those experiences, too. Until this weekend, I had never been to a Star Trek Convention. All other events I have been to pale in comparison to Creation Entertainment’s Star Trek Convention in Dallas (also called “The 50 Year Mission: Dallas”) from this weekend.\n\nThis blog is about my goal of watching all of Star Trek over the course of a year, but it’s also about my experiences in Star Trek fandom and addressing what Star Trek means to me. So I’m going to take some time to post a few blogs about my weekend. This is also a perfect way for me to document and preserve my experience so that I remember it later.\n\n(The words “wonderful,” “surreal,” “amazing,” and “genuine” will likely be overused to the point that they lose all meaning by the time I’m done with this series of blog posts. I’d apologize for my limited vocabulary, but these words so perfectly sum up the weekend. My experience was wonderful, surreal, and amazing. And the people who spoke and I had the opportunity to meet were so genuine. There may be better words in the English language for my experience, but I’m at a loss for coming up with any. So, bear with me)\n\nArriving in Dallas around 5:30 or so to check into our hotel before the “pre-registration” for the Gold Weekend pass holders on Thursday night, my friends and I had a little uncertainty about the weekend. We’d gone to Trektacular together two years ago, and we all pretty much agreed that was the perfect weekend. We met the Star Trek actors we’d idolized, we learned a lot about Star Trek, and we were introduced to the geek culture of cons in a way that you don’t get until you’ve experienced it. When we’d gone to Comicon last year, we’d left disappointed. Without the unique joy that had been Trektacular, Comicon was kind of a letdown.\n\nSo, here we were in a city seven hours away, prepared to spend our entire weekend in a single hotel at a convention. What if it wasn’t as good as Trektacular? What were we supposed to do for entertainment? We all just promised ourselves that we would keep our expectations low and just enjoy the experience.\n\nThen we got to the vendors room. The Vendors room at Planet Comicon is in a huge room at a convention center that probably holds upwards of one hundred booths. It’s crazy. There are so many things to buy. Without some self control, it wouldn’t be hard to spend an amount equivalent to a small car on memorabilia and other nerdy things. At this convention? It was a relatively small room with booths surrounding the outside. If I’m remembering correctly, there were 10 vendors. The actors who signed in the vendors room had tables in the middle. There were probably about 10 of them. That was it.\n\nTo say my heart sank at seeing the vendors room would be an understatement. I’d been looking forward to this Convention as an opportunity to collect some new Star Trek stuff. I wanted some T-shirts, maybe some bobble heads to add to my collection at my office, and I so desperately wanted canvas artwork of the Enterprise E to hang on my wall at work. From my first glance at the vendors room, I was so disappointed. One of the most fun parts of a Con is spending hours getting lost in the vendors room and trying to scope out all of your purchases and joking about the things you’d buy if you had thousands of dollars in disposable income. That certainly wasn’t going to happen at this convention.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I enjoyed having the vendors room almost to ourselves the first night. I was able to score a pretty cool TNG command briefcase and two sets of bobble heads (see: below) and perhaps a few other goodies, but it was generally kind of a disappointment. I left the vendors room afraid of what the weekend would bring.\n\nData and Geordi as Sherlock and Watson.\n\nAll 5 Captains: Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway, and Archer.\n\nThe night picked up a little bit when we decided to go to the hotel bar to wind down for a while and grab a little bit to eat before heading to bed. As I was sitting in the lobby, I look up and see a mildly familiar man walking out of the bar. It took me a few seconds, but I soon recognized him as Casey Biggs. Casey played Damar on DS9. He’s certainly not a character I ever paid too much attention to, but he had a pretty big recurring role throughout most of that series. It’s surreal to be sitting around minding your own business and have a Star Trek actor walk past you.\n\nSo, of course I took a picture.\n\nYeah, that’s Casey Biggs walking 10 feet from me. This was a harbinger of things to come, and I should have known the weekend was going to be amazing at this point. But I don’t think it had quite sunk in.\n\nI got made fun of for being a paparazzi and taking this picture. My only response was that my friends should be glad that Terry Farrell hadn’t walked through the lobby. My reaction in that case would have been much more embarrassing than trying to subtly snap a picture. (I’m also told that my photo snapping skills aren’t really subtle, but I don’t really care :-)…)\n\nAnyways, we headed on into the bar and there were Star Trek actors there, too. Vaughn Armstrong who played Admiral Forrest on Enterprise (and a dozen other characters), Max Grodenchik who played Rom on DS9, and Jeffrey Combs who played Shran from Enterprise and Brunt and Weyoun from DS9 were sitting at one of the high top tables right next to the only empty table in the place. So, for about 5 minutes, I sat at a table next to some pretty iconic characters from Star Trek. In the immortal words of Hugh Grant from Notting Hill, it was “Surreal but nice.”\n\nThey all left for a while, presumably to go rehearse for their performance the next evening, but maybe an hour later we spotted Vaughn and Jeffrey Combs sitting at the bar and having an animated conversation. I pretty much just sat and stared at them. These guys are real celebrities to me, and to be sitting in a bar with my friends while Star Trek actors are just feet away is totally surreal.\n\nLooking back now, I find it actually quite amusing to look back on my reactions and fears on the first night. I’ve never had as much fun as I did at this convention, and I am convinced that Trekkies are the best fans out there. Every penny I spent to attend this convention was worth it, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. But maybe it was good that I was afraid of what I was going to experience on my first night, it allowed every single expectation I had to be exceeded in an unprecedented fashion.\n\nThe vendors room opened up early on Friday morning, the first “official” day of the Con, and I wanted to get there to grab a few T-shirts I had my eye on and to see if the vendors room had improved any.\n\nAfter donning my costume… Janeway, complete with a cup of coffee for part of the morning, I headed down to the vendors room. The room was a little more full on Friday morning, the vendors had unpacked more of their things and there were certainly more people there. But Trekkies really are great people. I lost count of the number of smiles and laughs that I got from folks as I walked through the vendors room. The atmosphere was just so wonderful. The only real stars in the room were Nicole DeBoer (Ezri Dax from DS9), Connor Trineer (Trip from Enterprise), and Dominic Keating (Malcom Reed from Enterprise), but the atmosphere was still wonderful. And somehow I made the impulse purchase of getting a duo photo op with Connor and Dominic. This was a strange choice for me because I’m not much of an Enterprise fan. But after my interactions with those two this weekend, it’s certainly changed my perspective.\n\nFrom top to bottom: A vendors table with great artwork; A table with the best swag and where I got my briefcase and bobble heads; Dominic Keating and James Darren just hanging out in the vendors room; more vendors room; Connor Trineer at his table; and a final look at the vendors room.\n\nPicking up some nerdy T-shirts always improves my mood. Marian, from my writer’s group, described The Trouble With Tribbles as the most T-shirt worthy Star Trek episode. So I had to pick up such a shirt when I had the opportunity.\n\nAfter my trip to the vendors room, I headed out to the main convention area (outside the theatre) where there was a concession stand for the convention-goers. They were selling Vulcan Ale! Of course I tried one.\n\nThey were selling “Vulcan Ale,” a red IPA that honestly wasn’t very good. But it was Star Trek beer! I had to try one!\n\nAs I was sitting down eating my lunch before the Convention officially started, I got a taste of just how awesome Trekkies can be. I sat down in the general vicinity of people I don’t know and started talking to them. After a while, someone approached me about sitting there. She and I struck up an easy conversation. She was from Canada and is a bit of a Convention pro, but we had so much in common. She’s also a crazy cat lady, and she absolutely loves Doctor Crusher. It was amazing how easy it was to strike up a conversation with a total stranger and have it result in a quick friendship. Trekkies are great like that.\n\nThe first panel of the day was Ethan Phillips (Neelix from Voyager). I love Voyager, but Neelix is probably my second-least favorite character from the series. I was excited there was a Voyager actor at the Con, but prior to attending the panel, I had really been wishing they had found someone else. Ethan was a pretty great panel, though. I don’t know that he said anythin particularly meaningful or insightful, but he is hilarious and performs wonderful stand up comedy. He had the entire crowd in stitches, and his surprisingly dirty joke about a penguin getting his car fixed was great. (No way I’m putting it here, but I’ll tell you if you ask)\n\nEthan Phillips\n\nThe next panel was the highlight of my weekend and the one I was looking forward to the least. Casey Biggs and Vaughn Armstrong both play side characters in their respective series. Prior to this weekend, I didn’t have strong feelings about their characters either way. I was pretty much of the opinion that the characters of Damar and Admiral Forest add to the world of Star Trek by placing interesting characters at all levels and by progressing the story, but that was pretty much it. I mean, this is a franchise that spans hundreds of episodes over many series, there are only so many characters you can get invested in. So, it’s always cool to see a Star Trek actor speak about their experiences on the show, but I was kind of blah heading into this panel.\n\nBoy was I wrong. Casey and Vaughn are two of the most entertaining people on the planet. They are funny and genuine. After listening to their panel, I had to force myself to stay in my seat. All I wanted to do was run up to my hotel room and turn on every single episode that Damar is in. Casey gave such wonderful insight into his audition process and the process that he underwent in developing his character and the Cardassian race that I am unbelievably anxious to finally get to DS9 in The Prolific Trek. I have so much to watch for.\n\nCasey Biggs; Vaughn Armstrong; the Enterprise Blues Band.\n\nCasey and Vaughn finished their panel by playing some music from the Enterprise Blues Band. The EBB is essentially a blues band consisting of the two of them, and they sing songs that are pretty much just parodies of Star Trek. I still have the song Bat’leth Baby stuck in my head. These guys are wonderful performers and great musicians. Getting to listen to them sing and play their instruments was an absolute treat.\n\nThe next panel was a lovely tribute to Leonard Nimoy. Two men who knew Leonard discussed his life and provided a slideshow for us to watch and to give us more insight into this wonderful man. It was a great thing to get to see. Spock was clearly one of the most influential characters in all of Star Trek, and Leonard, the man behind that character, was so important and wonderful. It really saddens me that I’ll never get to meet him or watch him speak in person.\n\nThe next panel of the day was Terry Farrell and Nicole DeBoer. Terry and Nicole played two versions of the same character on DS9. Terry originated the role with Jadzia Dax, and Nicole finished season 7 as Ezri Dax. This is not the time or the place to get into Trill physiology or the stories behind that, but think like a Time Lord but not.\n\nJadzia Dax is one of my all time favorite characters. It’s been a while since I’ve watched DS9, so I’m not sure I can put into words exactly what it was about her character that captured me, but Jadzia is my favorite non-TNG character (i.e. I obviously love Captain Picard more). Ezri, who replaced Jadzia after Terry was let go for the final season, is unequivocally my least favorite character from DS9. Obviously, a lot of my opinions about Ezri are clouded by the fact that she’s a poor man’s Jadzia, but nonetheless, I don’t like her character at all.\n\nI was still looking forward to this panel. Terry Farrel is one of the actors I was most looking forward to meeting and seeing for obvious reasons. She crafted a character I feel so fondly about that I wanted desperately to see the actress behind her character. I’ve been told I giggled like a fan girl and sat on the edge of my seat during the entire panel. I’d deny this, but it’s probably 100% true. Terry just fascinates me.\n\nTheir panel was great. Unfortunately, I didn’t take good enough notes to remember many specifics. Although, it was clear that Nicole has a great sense of humor, and she and Terry have a great respect for each other. It was fun to get to see the two of them play off of each other. I also appreciated their discussion of the aspects of Dax that they each enjoyed playing the most. Terry talked about loving the Klingon aspect of the Dax symbiont and how she loved all of the physical things she got to do, but Nicole mentioned that she always found it a little strange because she’s such a small woman to be pulling off these bad ass stunts. I’m going to have to watch for the difference between the two characters during my DS9 rewatch.\n\nA few pics from Terry and Nicole’s panel. Terry is the tall one with the striped sweater, and Nicole is the one in the tanktop.\n\nThe only quote I have in my note from this panel is “Now I’m a freakin’ star.” I have no idea what this quote means, but it was obviously very funny. Shame on me for not taking better notes… I’m going to blame it on my distraction by actually getting to see Terry Farrell for the first time in my life.\n\nThe final panel of the day was Jeffrey Combs. Jeffrey, or Jeff as I like to call him now, is the answer to many Star Trek trivia questions: he’s one of only 4 actors to have played seven or more characters on Star Trek. So, obviously, he’s played a variety of characters and alien races over a variety of series. Jeff is a funny guy and an extremely talented actor. He has the skill of becoming a chameleon and slipping into a variety of roles such that it’s easy to forget he’s played someone else. His portrayal of Wyoun, a Vorta on DS9, is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying. Brunt, a Ferengi on DS9, is funny and a perfect foil to Quark. Shran, an Andorian on Enterprise, is simply delightful and makes me want to use the phrase “pink-skin” more often every time I watch him.\n\nJeff is never the star, but the man can steal a scene like no one else. I think it’s impossible not to be amused by the amazing characters he portrays. It was particularly enlightening to listen to him explain his experiences with playing each of the characters and how he chose to portray them. Jeff played the first Vorta to ever appear on Star Trek. So, he was essentially tasked with creating this race (interestingly enough, he didn’t know he would get to come back as Weyoun 2 after Weyoun 1’s death at the end of his inaugural appearance). Jeff described his portrayal of Weyoun as a supervisor from corporate who has come to inspect your office. He’s sickly sweet and tells you how wonderful of a job you’re doing, and then bam, two days later you’re fired. It was an amusing comparison, and thinking back on the Vorta, and Weyoun in particular, I can definitely see how that was his inspiration for the character.\n\nOne of the great things about these panels is how you can get so much more insight into characters and storylines simply by listening to the actors speak. Hearing Terry and Nicole discuss the differences in the character they share was enlightening. And Casey Biggs had an amazing grasp on exactly what Damar was. Jeff also had very clear ideas for the characters he played and their various differences. I know as I continue through my rewatch that these insights will change the way I watch the show.\n\nThe rest of my evening included getting a photo op with Terry Farrel, probably the thing I had been looking forward to the most at this convention; getting autographs from a handful of the guest stars which were included with my ticket packages; and the highlight of the evening, the “Rat Pack” performance.\n\nMe with Terry Farrell. She’s so tall and so wonderful!\n\nWhen I saw the Rat Pack performance on the Convention schedule, I wasn’t sure what to expect. A bunch of Star Trek actors in tuxedos unleashing their inner Dean Martins and Frank Sinatras? It seems like an idea that could go horribly wrong, but it most definitely did not. Max Grodenchik writes a wonderful and entertaining show with great music, riffing off of all sorts of Star Trek concepts, and Vaughn Armstrong, Casey Biggs, Jeffrey Combs, and Ethan Phillips were hilarious. The entire performance was completely worth watching, and it was the perfect way to wind down the first official day of the convention.\n\nJeff Combs on guitar with his backup singers at the Rat Pack performance.\n\nSo, I wasn’t really intending this blog to be a blow-by-blow of Thursday and Friday of the convention. I intended just to give my reflections and provide a few highlights, but everything this weekend was a highlight for me. I’m sure as I continue these posts to document the rest of the convention, I’ll get even more reflective. But I cannot say enough how much fun I had at this convention. Star Trek is a show so close to my heart, and I fully embrace the Rodenberry-ideal that our future will be so much better. I tend to think that the sort of people who are drawn to Star Trek and become Trekkies are almost universally good people. They embrace IDIC and want the world to be a better place. This weekend proved so much of that.\n\nI’ll be back in a bit to document my Saturday and Sunday at the Convention. Highlights of those days included Jonathan Frakes liking my shirt, me doing karaoke with Connor Trineer in front of the entire convention, and finally getting to see Walter Koenig in person.\n\nIn the meantime, I am desperately trying to get back on track with The Prolific Trek. I watched Measure of a Man tonight, and you can bet I’ll eventually be doing a blog post on that masterpiece.\n\n#LLAP"
