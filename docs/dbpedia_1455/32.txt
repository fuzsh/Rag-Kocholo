Former Massachusetts Senate President Stan Rosenberg is wading back into the public arena with a local access cable program in his hometown of Amherst.

Rosenberg resigned from the Legislature in May after a scathing ethics report concluded that he failed to protect the Senate from his husband, Bryon Hefner, who is charged with sexual misconduct.

The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports that the former lawmaker will be hosting a weekly program called "Byline with Stan Rosenberg" in conjunction with the League of Women Voters of Amherst and Amherst Media. The show will include interviews with local and state officials.

The first episode is slated for Friday.

Rosenberg represented Amherst for more than 25 years on Beacon Hill.

Hefner has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault and other charges involving four men.
