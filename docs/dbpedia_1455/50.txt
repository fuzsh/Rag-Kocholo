Former Massachusetts Senate President Stan Rosenberg, whose husband is accused of sexual misconduct, said Thursday that he will resign from the chamber.

In a letter to Senate President Harriette Chandler, Rosenberg said he will resign at 5 p.m. Friday. Rosenberg represents the Hampshire, Franklin and Worcester District.

A ethics report released Wednesday found Rosenberg "failed to protect the Senate" from his husband, Bryon Hefner, prompting calls for the lawmaker to resign.

The report prepared by independent investigators hired by the Senate Ethics Committee said that while Rosenberg did not violate any formal Senate rules, he showed a lack of judgment and violated the chamber's information technology policies by giving Hefner "unfettered access" to Rosenberg's Senate email account.

In a statement, Rosenberg said the findings of the investigation made it clear he would not be able to refocus attention on his work in the Senate as he hoped.

"In light, however, of the disciplinary measures recommended by the Ethics Committee, it would not be fair to my constituents to have a representative in the Senate who lacked the authority to represents their interests fully," Rosenberg said.

Rosenberg was a lawmaker for more than 30 years and served as the Senate leader for almost three years before stepping aside in December amid the allegations against Hefner.

. He was released on personal recognizance.
