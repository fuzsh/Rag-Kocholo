From 1995 to 2001 she was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Prior to serving in the Massachusetts legislature, she was a member of the Worcester school committee from 1991 to 1994.

Prior to this she was the Senate Majority Leader. She was also the Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Redistricting and Co-Chair of the Special Senate Committee on Citizen Engagement. She was recently Vice-Chair of the Special Senate Committee on Housing and member of the Senate Committee on Ethics, Senate Committee on Rules, and Joint Committee on Housing. She previously served as Senate Assistant Majority Leader [4] and the Vice-Chair of the Senate Steering and Policy Committee.[7][8] She was the second woman in Massachusetts history to serve as Assistant Majority Leader and is also the second woman in Massachusetts history to serve as Majority Leader. Chandler also served as the Senate Majority Whip, Assistant Majority Whip, Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on Public Health, Assistant Vice-Chair of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on Federal Stimulus Oversight, and the Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs.\n\nDuring her last two terms in the House, she was the Chair of the Joint Committee on Health Care.[4]\n\nCaucuses and organizations\n\n[edit]\n\nChandler serves as the Co-Chair of the Prevention for Health Caucus and the Legislature's Oral Health Caucus.

Higgins Sr., her opponent in the November 2010 election. She claimed Higgins knowingly made false statements about her during the campaign that went well beyond reasonable political campaign statements.[10] The lawsuit, and counterclaims from Higgins, were dropped in June 2011 after Higgins admitted his allegations were not true.[11]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSenator Chandler earned degrees from Wellesley College (B.A.), Simmons College (M.B.A.), and Clark University (Ph.D.).
