Established on June 24, 1811, it was named in honor of American statesman and writer, Benjamin Franklin. Franklin County is one of 14 counties in Massachusetts, and its county seat is the town of Greenfield.\n\nThe region has a diverse cultural history dating back to its early Native American inhabitants, specifically the Pocumtuck and Mohawk tribes. European settlers began arriving in the area in the 17th century, and over time, the region developed as an important center for agriculture, trade, and industry.\n\nThroughout its history, Franklin County has been home to numerous small mills and factories, particularly during the industrial revolution of the 19th century. The area was known for producing goods such as textiles, tools, and cutlery. The Connecticut River, which runs through the county, provided an essential source of power and transportation for goods.\n\nAnother significant aspect of the county's history is its role in the Revolutionary War. It was home to several towns where important events occurred during the course of the war. The county's proximity to Vermont and New Hampshire also made it a strategic location for the movement of troops and supplies between various battles in the region.\n\nA fun fact about Franklin County is that it houses one of the longest operational suspension bridges in the United States, the Turners Falls-Gill Bridge. Built in 1877 and originally called the Riverside Bridge, it was renamed in honor of Benjamin Turner and Joshua Frost Gill who initiated the construction of the bridge. The county is also known for its picturesque landscapes and recreational opportunities, with the Mohawk Trail, a famous scenic highway, winding through the region, attracting tourists from around the country.\n\nFeatured Cities of Massachusetts"
