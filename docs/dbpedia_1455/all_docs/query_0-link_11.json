        "text": "Rosenberg’s decision came a day after the Senate Ethics Commission, in a scathing report, condemned his husband’s rampant interference in Senate affairs and Rosenberg’s inability to curb Bryon Hefner’s “destructive” meddling and alleged sexual harassment of Senate employees.\n\nWhen Merrigan and Rosenberg spoke again Thursday, the senator told him in a subdued conversation that he would resign. The decision became public shortly afterward.\n\n“I don’t think he had a choice,” Merrigan said. “You couldn’t say ‘How are you?’ because you knew the answer.”\n\nRosenberg’s resignation, effective Friday, prompted a mixture of muted approval and sadness in Western Massachusetts, which he served as senator since 1991 and as state representative for five years before.\n\n“I’m shattered on a number of levels because I have enormous respect and regard for Stan Rosenberg,” said William Dwight, a Northampton councilor at large. “What has transpired is the very definition of a tragedy.”\n\nDwight said that Rosenberg made mistakes but that his long fight for progressive causes will be missed.\n\nGiven Rosenberg’s enormous popularity in the district, he probably would have won reelection this fall despite the scandal, Dwight said.\n\n“Per usual, Stan was thinking of the district he represented first and of the institution of the Senate,” Dwight said. “He made human mistakes, but he did make mistakes.”\n\nChelsea Sunday Kline, a Northampton Democrat who now is running unopposed for Rosenberg’s seat, thanked the former Senate president “for making the right decision for survivors, for the Senate, and for the district in stepping down.”\n\n“Senator Rosenberg leaves an impressive progressive legacy that has improved lives throughout Massachusetts,” she said.\n\nState Representative Solomon Goldstein-Rose, a first-term lawmaker from Amherst, called Rosenberg a first-rate legislator.\n\n“While he made mistakes, I’m sorry for our community, which is losing an effective and beloved servant,” Goldstein-Rose said.\n\nBonnie MacCracken, a Democratic activist from Amherst, said she did not see the resignation coming.\n\nOn Monday night, she stood outside Town Meeting collecting two pages of signatures to help qualify Rosenberg for the ballot this fall.\n\nJust before learning that he had resigned, MacCracken said she was telling a friend that Rosenberg needed to hit the campaign trail, given that he was facing his first Democratic primary challenger in 27 years.\n\n“I am just devastated,” MacCracken said. “I don’t even know what to say because the emotions are so raw.”\n\nNorthampton Mayor David J. Narkewicz called Rosenberg a “tireless advocate” and commended the senator “for accepting responsibility for the serious lapses in judgment outlined by the Ethics Committee report and apologizing to those whose lives have been deeply affected by them.”\n\nThe drama on Beacon Hill also has practical repercussions that have upended the political scene in the Pioneer Valley.\n\nThe statewide filing deadline for candidates in this fall’s election passed Tuesday, which means that only Kline’s name will appear on the ballot. No Republicans or independents filed signatures to run.\n\nNarkewicz called Thursday for a two-week extension of the filing deadline for Rosenberg’s seat “so that we can have a full and robust debate about the needs and future of [the district’s] 24 cities and towns.”\n\nOtherwise, Narkewicz noted, Northampton will not have any representation in the Legislature until January. The city’s longtime state representative, Peter Kocot, died in February and has not been replaced.\n\nMerrigan, whose Greenfield home is in Rosenberg’s sprawling district, said the senator “did the right thing for himself at the end. He has been pained by this for months and months.”\n\nAlthough “mistakes were made,” Merrigan said, what should not be lost is the positive impact Rosenberg had on the district he represented.\n\n“He’s helped thousands of people navigate the abyss of state government. He was second to none,” Merrigan said. “He didn’t turn his back if things went south.”"
