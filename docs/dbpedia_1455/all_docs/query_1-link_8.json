        "text": "County in Massachusetts, United States\n\nNot to be confused with Franklin, Massachusetts.\n\nCounty in Massachusetts\n\nFranklin County is a nongovernmental county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. As of the 2020 census, the population was 71,029,[1] which makes it the least-populous county on the Massachusetts mainland, and the third-least populous county in the state. Its traditional county seat and most populous city is Greenfield. Its largest town by area is New Salem.[2] Franklin County comprises the Greenfield Town, MA Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Springfield-Greenfield Town, MA Combined Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFranklin County was created on June 24, 1811, from the northern third of Hampshire County. It was named for Benjamin Franklin.[3] Franklin County's government was abolished by the state government in 1997, at the county's request.[4]\n\nLaw and government\n\n[edit]\n\nLike several other Massachusetts counties, Franklin County exists today only as a geographic region and has no county government. The Franklin County Commission voted itself out of existence, and all former state-mandated county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1997. The sheriff and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region. Counties in Massachusetts and New England generally are historically weak governmental structures.[5] The primary subdivision of the Commonwealth is the municipal town. Communities are permitted to form regional compacts for sharing services. The municipalities of Franklin County have formed the Franklin Regional Council of Governments.[6] The regional council provides various services on a regional basis, and a majority of the county's towns are members of the Franklin County Solid Waste Management District, which provides municipal waste disposal and recycling services to its members. Public transportation throughout the county and in the North Quabbin area of northwestern Worcester County is provided by the Franklin Regional Transit Authority.\n\nSee also: New England town\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Franklin County, Massachusetts[7] Year Republican Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 11,201 26.38% 30,030 70.73% 1,227 2.89% 2016 10,364 26.70% 24,478 63.05% 3,979 10.25% 2012 9,344 24.75% 27,072 71.70% 1,342 3.55% 2008 9,545 24.77% 27,919 72.46% 1,065 2.76% 2004 11,058 29.58% 25,550 68.35% 773 2.07% 2000 10,176 30.50% 17,945 53.78% 5,245 15.72% 1996 8,055 24.60% 19,728 60.25% 4,959 15.15% 1992 8,691 24.26% 17,246 48.14% 9,890 27.60% 1988 13,475 40.68% 19,310 58.30% 338 1.02% 1984 15,883 50.37% 15,502 49.16% 148 0.47% 1980 12,528 41.59% 11,830 39.27% 5,764 19.14% 1976 14,837 47.58% 14,985 48.06% 1,359 4.36% 1972 16,088 56.93% 11,968 42.35% 202 0.71% 1968 12,345 48.63% 12,072 47.55% 969 3.82% 1964 8,344 32.56% 17,106 66.76% 174 0.68% 1960 15,682 55.99% 12,282 43.85% 47 0.17% 1956 19,779 72.09% 7,574 27.61% 83 0.30% 1952 19,489 68.94% 8,729 30.88% 50 0.18% 1948 14,919 61.21% 9,231 37.87% 223 0.91% 1944 13,252 58.37% 9,400 41.40% 51 0.22% 1940 14,137 59.58% 9,472 39.92% 119 0.50% 1936 13,756 57.99% 9,324 39.31% 641 2.70% 1932 13,040 66.03% 6,248 31.64% 460 2.33% 1928 14,333 70.52% 5,842 28.74% 149 0.73% 1924 11,350 77.12% 2,089 14.19% 1,278 8.68% 1920 9,931 77.85% 2,542 19.93% 284 2.23% 1916 4,353 56.93% 3,054 39.94% 239 3.13% 1912 2,636 36.08% 2,046 28.00% 2,624 35.92% 1908 4,824 67.87% 1,637 23.03% 647 9.10% 1904 5,034 71.40% 1,672 23.72% 344 4.88% 1900 4,937 70.47% 1,874 26.75% 195 2.78% 1896 5,671 80.17% 1,110 15.69% 293 4.14% 1892 4,510 58.50% 2,886 37.44% 313 4.06% 1888 4,100 55.90% 2,852 38.88% 383 5.22% 1884 3,676 53.34% 2,577 37.39% 639 9.27% 1880 4,023 64.39% 2,097 33.56% 128 2.05% 1876 4,072 64.34% 2,257 35.66% 0 0.00% 1872 4,335 80.80% 1,030 19.20% 0 0.00% 1868 4,580 83.33% 916 16.67% 0 0.00% 1864 4,376 77.25% 1,289 22.75% 0 0.00% 1860 3,994 74.28% 917 17.05% 466 8.67% 1856 4,445 74.44% 1,266 21.20% 260 4.35% 1852 2,552 46.42% 1,727 31.41% 1,219 22.17% 1848 2,133 40.09% 1,542 28.98% 1,645 30.92% 1844 2,725 52.45% 2,047 39.40% 423 8.14% 1840 3,461 61.20% 2,137 37.79% 57 1.01% 1836 2,405 69.59% 1,051 30.41% 0 0.00%\n\nVoter registration\n\n[edit]\n\nVoter registration and party enrollment as of February 2024[8] Unenrolled 37,116 66.01% Democratic 14,576 25.92% Republican 3,871 6.88% Libertarian 192 0.34% Other parties 473 0.84% Total 56,228 100%\n\nGeography and climate\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 724.57 square miles (1,876.6 km2), of which 699 square miles (1,810 km2) is land, 25 square miles (65 km2) and (3.5%) is water.[9] Central and southern Franklin County is dominated by the northern end of the Pioneer Valley, with steep hills rising on either side of the Connecticut River.\n\nThe high point of Franklin County is Crum Hill, 2,841 feet (866 m), located in the town of Monroe.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate in Franklin County is typically cool temperate.
