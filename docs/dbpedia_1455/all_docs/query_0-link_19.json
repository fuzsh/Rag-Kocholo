        "text": "GREENFIELD -- While the state Legislature ponders the idea of eliminating county government, folks in rural Franklin County have already quietly voted to do so.\n\nBut ending form of government that dates back to Massachusetts' beginnings is not as easy as turning out the lights and changing the letterhead.\n\n\"There will still be a Franklin County,\" said Shelburne Selectman Stanley Gawle. \"But the government will no longer exist.\"\n\nIn other words the maps and the services provided won't change. The jail, the courthouses and the county offices will remain. But the names on the doors -- Franklin Regional Council of Governments or Commonwealth of Massachusetts -- will be a bit longer. And decisions on how to raise they money for the services will be made a little differently.\n\n\"They are the trailblazers,\" said state Sen. Stephen Brewer, D-Barre, Senate chairman of the Committee on Counties, who is convinced the Legislature has to act quickly to revamp its financially strapped county government system.\n\n\"The irony is that Franklin County was a government that worked well,\" Sen. Brewer said.\n\nYet even in the state's most rural county, with 70,000 people spread over 703 square miles, a well-established network of regional services, no long-term debt, and a single well-defined market and government center in the town of Greenfield, it took years and three tries before voters and the Legislature could agree on a new system.\n\n\"It was a lot of work and compromise,\" said Mr. Gawle, whose town cast the deciding vote last week that gave the new government approval of a majority of the 26 towns in the county.\n\nUnder the revamped regional government, drawn up by a commission Mr. Gawle headed, the state will take over operation of high-cost items such as the jail and courthouse, plus the money-making registry of deeds, July 1. The sheriff and registrar will continue to be elected by voters within the 26 towns, which range in size from Hawley and Rowe -- populations barely 300 people each -- to Greenfield, with 18,000 residents.\n\nThe county, which relies heavily on agriculture and tourism for jobs, already shares a district attorney with neighboring Hampshire County.\n\nAll 26 towns, whether or not they vote to join the regional council, also still will be responsible for the pensions of retired county workers.\n\nAll who join will pay a base assessment for planning and other general services. However, they will be able to pick and choose among other regional services, such as purchasing, engineering and human service programs, and buy only what they want through population-based fees.\n\nThe three elected county commissioners are being supplanted by a six-member executive council with three members elected by voters, two members appointed by a Regional Council composed of representatives from each town board, and one member appointed by the regional Planning Board.\n\nGreenfield, which will pick up about 20 percent of the cost of the new government, and the other larger towns have already voted to join the council. But with town meeting votes continuing through June, the extent of the services it will be able to provide will depend on how many more towns join, Mr. Gawle said.\n\nAnd how many stay.\n\nAfter the initial three-year setup period, communities can leave the federation on a year's notice. Outside communities can also join on approval of their voters and the council.\n\n\"So far, no town has voted against joining and many of the town meeting votes have being unanimous,\" Mr. Gawle said. \"But if we don't get the money we need, we won't be able to do as much. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThe state Legislature could also send the new government's finances into a tailspin even before it is formally launched.\n\nUnder a tentative budget, assuming all 26 towns join and the state assumes the entire cost of running the jail, the new regional government would cost county property owners about $72,000 less than the $511,548 they paid this year.\n\nHowever, the House version of the state budget calls for Franklin County towns to contribute $295,000 toward the jail's $5.5 million operational budget. The state Senate has yet to act on the budget and Senate Ways and Means Chairman Stanley Rosenberg, D-Amherst, opposes the charge.\n\n\"It won't make it through the Senate and the governor,\" Mr. Gawle predicted. \"But the House broke its word to us.\"\n\nOne of the reasons the county's 26 towns have to maintain some form of regional organization, he contended, is to have the lobbying clout with the Legislature to head off just such moves.\n\n\"We just want to keep those regional operations we need and get rid of the state-type functions that were costing us money,\" Mr. Gawle said."
