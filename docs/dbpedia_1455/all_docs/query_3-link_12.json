        "text": "Fourteen communities with a city structure still refer to themselves as a town.\n\nThese places are sometimes described as “the city known as the town of X.”\n\nThey use the term “Town Council” for their legislative body.\n\nDecisions about which form of government to adopt — including whether to be a city or a town — are made by local voters. Under the Massachusetts Constitution, a municipality must have at least 12,000 people to adopt a city form of government, but there’s no upper limit on the size of a town.\n\nSelect Boards are the chief executive body in a town. Their formal, legal responsibilities are spread throughout hundreds of state laws, as well as the town’s bylaws, its home rule charter, and special acts enacted by the Legislature for a particular town.\n\nWhile selectmen are the principal administrative officers of the town, other boards, including the school committee, the planning board, and the board of health, may wield at least as much authority over certain aspects of town government.\n\nApart from strict legal responsibilities, the Select Board sets policy and strategic direction, coordinates the activities of other boards, and hears appeals and resolves problems that have not been settled at lower levels.\n\nPosition Particulars\n\n3 or 5 Members (more populous towns generally have 5)*\n\nElected at-large (not by district)\n\nElections each spring for staggered, three-year terms**\n\nTypically meet weekly or biweekly (sometimes less in July and August)\n\nMust have posted public meetings with a majority of the board present in order to have legal authority\n\nNearly 1,200 Select Board members serve in 292 towns in Mass.\n\nVolunteer position (though may receive a small stipend for their work)\n\nExceptions:\n\n*Wakefield has a seven-member “Town Council,” but its duties are essentially the same as those of a Select Board.\n\n**In Saugus, Select Board members are elected biennially, in the fall (of odd-numbered years), for two-year terms.\n\nSelect Board ≠ City Council\n\nWhile Select Boards and City Councils are the highest-level elected boards in their communities, their roles and responsibilities are not at all similar.\n\nSelect Boards are the chief executive in a town, while Councils are the legislative body in a city.\n\nTheir similarity ends with the fact that they are elected by local voters in a municipal election.\n\nThe word “Town Meeting” can refer to both the event and the legislative body. As an event, one might say, “The spring Town Meeting will begin next Tuesday”; and as a body, “The budget must be approved by a vote of the Town Meeting.”\n\nBelieved to be the oldest form of democracy in the United States, Town Meetings predate the American Revolution by more than a century. It is a rare continuing form of direct democracy in the U.S., found only in New England states.\n\nState law requires every town to have an annual Town Meeting.\n\nProcedural Particulars\n\nArticles (proposals) are placed on the Warrant (agenda) by the Select Board.\n\nArticles can be placed at the request of town departments or by a petition signed by at least 10 registered voters of the town.\n\nAll towns hold an Annual Town Meeting, in the spring. Many towns also hold one or more Special Town Meetings* at other times of the year.\n\n260 towns have an Open Town Meeting, meaning any registered voter may attend and vote.\n\n32 towns have a Representative Town Meeting.\n\nA town must have at least 6,000 residents to have a Representative Town Meeting.\n\nRepresentatives for Representative Town Meetings are elected typically by precinct, for three-year terms.\n\nMost Representative Town Meetings in Massachusetts range from 50 to 429 members, with an average size of 214.\n\nThe Town Moderator and Town Clerk must attend the Town Meeting.\n\n* Some towns hold these on an as-needed basis, while others hold them as a matter of routine. Special Town Meetings typically have a much shorter agenda than the annual ones. There is no limit on the number of Special Town Meetings a town can hold in any given year, though in most cases it’s just one.\n\nCity Councils act as the legislative branch in communities with a city form of government, as well as the policymaking body. Whereas Town Meeting is a form of direct democracy, the City Council is a representative body, somewhat like a local version of Congress.\n\nPosition Particulars\n\nRoughly 600 councillors serve in 59 communities in Massachusetts\n\nTwo-year terms*\n\nMost councils have combination of at-large seats and district, ward or precinct seats\n\nOdd number of members, typically between nine and 13 **\n\nIn “continuous session,” typically meeting weekly or biweekly (though sometimes less frequently in July and August)\n\nNote: 14 Massachusetts communities with a city form of government still refer to themselves as a town, and thus have a Town Council, but the distinction is in name only.\n\n*except in Barnstable and Winthrop, where they have four-year terms\n\n**except Newton’s Council, which has 24 members\n\nPowers and Responsibilities\n\nThe powers, duties, and responsibilities of a town management position are determined and defined locally, by a special act approved by the Legislature or the town charter.\n\nMost Town Managers have delegated appointment authority, authority for the direction of the budget and capital plan process, responsibility for coordinating financial operations, and other duties as assigned by the Select Board.\n\nWith very rare exceptions, municipal elections are held separately from statewide and federal elections.\n\nInteresting note: Saugus is the only town in Massachusetts that follows a city election schedule."
