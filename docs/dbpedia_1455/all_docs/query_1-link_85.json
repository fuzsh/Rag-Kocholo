        "text": "In my 20-year career in housing in Massachusetts, one of the most common frustrations is from those in need of housing who cannot find it. Either they cannot afford it, or they do not know where to go to apply for housing, and/or they have to complete applications at multiple places and sometimes complete multiple applications at one stop, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThese frustrations have been particularly concerning here in Franklin County, where the rural landscape presents unique challenges for residents with limited means. Greenfield faces even greater challenges, serving as the resource-rich county seat to so many small communities.\n\nThese small communities often lack core infrastructure, staff, and transportation to address housing needs. We need to plan for what makes the most sense for Franklin County residents, and we are sitting on an opportunity to strengthen infrastructure and make housing more accessible to those searching for it right now.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to work as the executive director of the Franklin County Regional Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) since July 2019, an organization that is dynamic in its mission and offerings. In addition to managing public housing, which was our charter, we expanded over the years to offer housing counseling, education, home rehab loans, assistance to municipalities with community development block grant applications and homelessness prevention services; and through our nonprofit affiliate Rural Development Inc. (RDI), real estate development services.\n\nSince starting in this role, I have traded emails and calls, and participated in some meetings with the folks at the Greenfield Housing Authority (GHA). We share some of the same programs, clients, and even tenants. Most of our clients do not understand why we are two separate entities, and though we work together in some ways now, there are ways that this could be more seamless for our clients and residents.\n\nIn 2018, there were operational issues so severe at GHA that its board of commissioners authorized a study that resulted in what has now become five years of transitional leadership. In that same amount of time, I have increased revenue, housing voucher utilization, and even reserves at HRA.\n\nThrough RDI, we have added to the housing stock in Franklin County with 33 new units of senior housing in Sunderland. We are looking at the county’s needs and have assembled resources and talent that can help alleviate the regional housing crisis.\n\nGHA has resources that are currently underutilized. In 2019, both of our organizations were issued about a dozen new housing choice vouchers from HUD. GHA has not been able to issue any of these in five years. At HRA, we have issued them all to residents in need. By working together, the GHA and HRA could increase direct support to our residents by reducing duplicative administrative tasks that do not serve the public.\n\nI also have been able to work with the commonwealth’s Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC) to forge the first-ever merger between two local housing authorities. In late 2022, then-Gov. Charlie Baker signed into law the merger of the Shelburne Housing Authority with the HRA, resulting in a revised board structure and greater resources to serve our residents.\n\nSeeing this success, EOHLC Secretary Ed Augustus saw fit to include a key policy change in the Affordable Homes Act that would eliminate the need for legislation and allow local housing authorities to merge. This change puts the power to decide with the local boards, who could work together to decide how to move forward.\n\nMy hope is that the GHA board will enter into discussions with the HRA board to explore a collaborative solution to the county’s dire housing needs. The HRA is ready to work with the GHA to bring the best of both of our organizations to the community. We would have a planning process involving all residents, staff, and stakeholders to design the best housing authority for this region.\n\nA merger could bring much-needed benefits to Greenfield residents, starting with less confusion over how and where to find housing, and possibly to developing even more housing. We know that our region needs to change the fractured way we approach housing: from the application process to the policies that serve our smaller municipalities as well as our county seat.\n\nHRA is ready to address these challenges and would welcome the opportunity to discuss leading the GHA forward.\n\nGina Govoni of Turners Falls is executive director of the Franklin County Regional Housing and Redevelopment Authority."
