        "text": "BOSTON (CBS) -- Massachusetts Senate President Stan Rosenberg came out publicly to say he was disappointed with Hampshire College in Amherst after they briefly decided to ban the American flag on campus following recent protests at the school.\n\nRosenberg sat down with WBZ political analyst Jon Keller last week to talk about issues before the Senate, but Jon first asked him about the flag controversy, as Hampshire is in his district.\n\n\"I think there are many ways that you can express dissent in our society, but I don't think the flag should become the focus or a target in matters of dissent,\" said Rosenberg.\n\n\"The flag represents to people--particularly veterans and their families, and you think about gold star families and mothers who've lost family members--the flag just is not the right target when you're protesting things of the government,\" he continued. \"The flag did nothing, and there are so many other ways that the young people could have expressed themselves.\"\n\nJon said he wasn't surprised that a bunch of college kids \"getting excited,\" but that he was surprised with the college's president saying he was pressured by public response about the flag issues.\n\nRosenberg said he was scheduled to talk with President Lash about the flag troubles, and relay his feelings.\n\nHe said his message would be that \"I was disappointed, but I'm glad that the flag is up.\"\n\nKeller and Rosenberg also talked about legalized marijuana, and the state of gambling in Massachusetts."
