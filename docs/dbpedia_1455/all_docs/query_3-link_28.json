        "text": "Food access can be a concern in many communities working to become Age- and Dementia Friendly, but the Massachusetts Food Trust Program reached a milestone in funding its first projects, which will address and improve how people across the state get their hands on healthy eating options.\n\nThe Massachusetts Food Trust Program is a public/private partnership overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources and administered by the Local Enterprise Assistance Fund and Franklin County Community Development Corporation. Officially launched October 30, 2018, the program administrators announced the first awards made by the Program worth $760,000, which include seven projects serving six Massachusetts counties.\n\nThe initial funding awards include both loans and grants to support seven healthy food projects representing the following six Massachusetts counties: Berkshire, Bristol, Franklin, Hampden, Plymouth, and Suffolk. The projects range in scope and size and include support for two grocery store expansions, a food co-op, a greenhouse, an urban farm stand, a youth apprentice program, and a project aimed at increasing produce distribution networks for corner stores.\n\nThe Massachusetts Food Trust Program (MFTP) was established in law in 2014 and given a $6 million capital authorization in the 2016 economic development bond bill. The Baker-Polito Administration released $1 million in seed funding for the program in the FY19 capital budget.\n\nThe initial public investment released in the FY19 capital budget has leveraged significant private and federal investment. More than $4 million in both private and federal funds have been leveraged to the state’s $1 million in seed funding.\n\n“The Baker-Polito Administration was proud to invest in the Massachusetts Food Trust Program, which is working to both support local business owners and increase access to healthy, affordable food in nutritionally underserved communities throughout the Commonwealth,” said Department of Agricultural Resources Commissioner John Lebeaux.\n\n“This first round of loans and grants will help meet the financing needs of healthy food retailers and distributors that plan to operate in underserved communities, strengthening the local food system while also increasing economic development.”\n\n“Since the launch of this program, I’ve had the opportunity, as part of an aggressive community outreach, to speak with many small business owners and grocers around the state. The MFTP is providing a funding solution to a number of these businesses who are in need of upgrades and expansions that will increase their fresh produce offerings to better serve their community. We could not be more excited to make these initial awards to seven deserving projects,” said Gerardo Espinoza, Local Enterprise Assistance Fund.\n\n“The volume and geographic diversity of applications since the launch of this program has been overwhelmingly exciting. There is a high demand for these funds and I’m glad we are able to partner with LEAF to ensure the food businesses in the western part of our state are able to receive the funding and technical assistance they need to succeed. These first seven awards are just the start of the kind of impact the MFTP will have in low-income, underserved areas,” said John Waite, Franklin County Community Development Corporation.\n\nThe capital funds released by the state to the MFTP offer local food businesses a “friendly capital” option for financing. The subordinated and below market rate loans provide the flexibility to adapt financing to the needs of the borrower and provide a starting point that draws traditional capital lenders to the project. Grants provided through this program supplement loan financing and support projects that will require loan financing in the future. This lessens the risk for borrowers and incentivizes other funders to come to the table. The MFTP also provides pre-and-post loan business assistance, in order to ensure that entrepreneurs are getting access to the resources they need to be successful and sustainable.\n\n“After years of advocacy work alongside local partners to get this program off the ground, we could not be more pleased with the results. The two program administrators of the MFTP developed a structure with a powerful focus on equity. The program gives preference to projects that build wealth within communities most affected by lack of healthy food access, and that enhance racial, gender, and economic equity. This is exactly the type of investment our communities need,” said Carlene Pavlos, Massachusetts Public Health Association.\n\nApplications for MFTP funding are accepted on a rolling basis.
