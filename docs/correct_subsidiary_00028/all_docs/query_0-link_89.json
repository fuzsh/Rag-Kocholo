        "text": "Terrific. Thanks, Matt. Well, good afternoon everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review Manhattan Associates’ 2019 fourth quarter and full year results. So, Manhattan reported another strong quarter to wrap up what has been a record year, kind of a year of firsts, if you will. We reported all-time record revenue as expected, record cloud revenue; all-time record software revenue, cloud plus license; and all-time record services revenue.\n\nAdditionally, since our IPO in 1998, 2019 marked our fifth best year for adjusted operating profit and second highest year for operating cash flow. And furthermore, we’ve continued the disciplined management by our share buyback program by investing $116 million to repurchase 1.64 million shares in calendar year 2019. We’re pleased with this performance when you consider that we’re about 2.5 years into a major five-year business transformation, investing in advance of growth and growing headcount rapidly to meet market demand. And as Dennis will detail later, our 2020 guidance calls for another record revenue year.\n\nTurning back to the fourth quarter for a moment, we reported total revenue of $153 million, adjusted operating margins of 21.8%, and adjusted EPS of $0.40. Year-over-year, fourth quarter 2019 total revenue grew 6% with adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS exceeding our expectations by 280 basis points and $0.09 respectively. Cloud, maintenance, and services revenue all exceeded their Q4 targets, giving us the positive momentum as we exit 2019 and focus on delivering in 2020 and beyond.\n\nSo just going a little further into the financial details of the quarter, we recognized 9 million in license revenue in the quarter. And going forward, we expect our license revenue to continue to decline as customer demand for true cloud is increasing more rapidly than we anticipated when we announced our transition to becoming a cloud-first company.\n\nNow turning to Cloud, our Q4 revenue totaled nearly $16 million, growing 131% over prior year and 103% for the full year. We continue to receive strong inbound interest in subscription models for our supply chain management solutions, including WMS, scale, transportation, omni-channel, and inventory, which we view as a strong indicator of pent-up market demand and sources of future growth for our company. Cloud deal activity was solid in Q4, but we did have a few deals slip into January.\n\nTotal software revenue of $25 million in the quarter marking a strong end to the year. And for the first time ever in a quarter, cloud revenue surpassed license revenue. And we expect this to be a permanent trend as our cloud pipeline is growing more rapidly than license, reflecting that market demand I mentioned. And as we’ve discussed in the past, we remain focused on the following key growth pillars to drive further operational and financial performance of our company. First, market-leading product innovation. We invested $81 million in R&D in 2019, which is about 20% higher than prior year.\n\nAnd in 2020, we expect to invest about $88 million in R&D as our commitment to innovation continues to manifest itself through the delivery of new and innovative solutions that differentiate us as the leading provider of supply chain inventory and omni-channel commerce solutions. And this consistent focus on innovation allows us to deliver market-leading solutions to drive customer revenue growth and lower the total cost of ownership while reducing time to market, positioning our customers for success in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving business landscape. And in turn, we plan to leverage these innovative offerings and have record of customer success to expand our global pipeline and increase the size of our total addressable market, which is a great segue into our second pillar, pipeline growth.\n\nOur global pipeline continues to remain strong for cloud and services. And regarding license pipeline, while solid we are seeing the market shift to cloud preference for WMS, which we factored into our license guidance. And while still early, cloud WMS deal activity, bookings and strength and pipeline activity indicates increasing market demand for WMS in the cloud. We continue to be very encouraged by our new customer signings and by the concentration of potential new customers in the global pipeline with over 50% of our deal opportunities representing net new logos.\n\nOur third pillar, our services business. Our global consulting teams continue to operate at or near capacity with ongoing demand for services across our market-leading Manhattan active omni channel, inventory and supply chain solutions. Our services business delivered 86 million in revenue in Q4’19, growing 2% versus a strong 2018 comp, and due to strengthening global demand from new product sales and system upgrades, we increased that capacity 12% in 2019, and continued to recruit aggressively to meet the demands while ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\nAnd a final and fourth pillar, sales and marketing. In 2019, competitive win rates remained strong at nearly 70% against head to head competition with approximately 30% of licensing cloud sales coming from new customers, and verticals driving more than 50% of our licensing cloud revenues for the quarter were retail, consumer goods, and food and beverage. Investments in sales and marketing were up 9% in 2019 as we focused on driving further brand recognition, product awareness, and account coverage globally.\n\nI'd like to provide you a few brief updates on product innovation across the Manhattan product suite and provide a couple of comments on how they performed during the recent peak holiday season. So, let’s start with point of sale. We continue to make solid progress on building market awareness around our cloud native, point-of-sale offering. At this year’s NRF event, we found great enthusiasm for the solution and that's because word really continues to grow throughout the retail industry about a highly differentiated and market leading technology with the market agreeing with us that only true omni-channel approach to point of sale will work for the challenging retail landscape.\n\nOur recent highly successful go lives and project initiations of several high-profile retail chains are serving to further validate our vision for point of sale. Now, speaking of applications that support today's digital native shoppers, we're seeing an influx of interest in our recently released digital self service capabilities. These capabilities provide digital native shoppers the ability to drive many aspects of the post purchase experience themselves. And today's leading omni channel brands are placing an increasing emphasis on the post purchase portion of the buyers’ journey. And because of that depth of capability in OMS, we think we're uniquely positioned to provide best-in-class, end consumer experiences in this area.\n\nAnd on a related note, I'm happy to share that the recent peak holiday period was our most successful ever. That was measured by the performance of our order management and warehouse management systems. Given the direct consumer portions of our customers’ businesses were up pretty much across the board, most with increases well into the double digit percentages.\n\nManhattan Active Omni was able to smoothly handle some pretty dramatic spikes in volume. In fact one of our customers processed 28 times their average daily volume on Cyber Monday, and another shared with us that our fulfillment solution allowed them to ship nearly 50% of their direct-to-consumer orders from their source. And we believe that only Manhattan Active Omni can provide both the leading functional capability and advanced application architecture to generate these types of outcomes for our customers.\n\nAnd as for WMS, I'm happy to report a similar outcome. Shipment volumes were an all time highs as customers generated record levels of productivity using Manhattan WMS. In particular, customers employing our new order streaming capabilities saw particularly strong results with higher picking productivity and dramatically lower click-to-ship duration. The outcomes generated by order streaming strongly support I believe that wave less processing is indeed the future for warehouse operations.\n\nAnd I'll close my product-centric comments by noting that Q4 is another positive quarter for our TMS business. Many of the market factors that I've noted in prior calls continue to help us close additional TMS businesses past quarter. And while we closed some very nice deals here in the Americas, of particular note was the addition of a large European grocer to our TMS community. And I’ve shared with you on prior calls that expansion of our TMS business into Western Europe is one of the strategic objectives. So it's particularly heartening to be selected by a TMS customer who has no pre-existing relationship with Manhattan Associates.\n\nSo that covers the broad business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and discuss our 2020 full year guidance in quite a bit more detail, and then I'll close out prepared remarks with a brief summary. So Dennis?\n\nThanks Eddie. Fourth quarter total revenue was $152.9 million with 6% organic growth over the prior year. Full year total revenue was $617.9 million, 11% organic growth over 2018. Excluding the impacts of FX, total revenue was up 12% on the year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.40, GAAP earnings per share was $0.26 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS.\n\nLicense revenue was $9.2 million in the quarter, which is down year-over-year and sequentially as we've discussed previously. From 2017 to 2019, our license is attributed 32% on increasing demand for WMS in the cloud. We expect attrition to continue as market demand for WNS and the cloud continues to grow, with a full year 2020 estimated license range of $26 million to $30 million, down about 43% at the midpoint.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2020, we are targeting approximately $7 million to $8 million in license revenue. For cloud revenue, cloud revenue was up $15.7 million, up 131% year-over-year, driven by robust customer demand for our cloud solutions. For full year 2020, we estimate cloud revenue range of $77 million to $80 million growing about 68% at the midpoint. Just for some context, it took us 18 years to grow our license revenue to $70 million run rate versus our cloud business, which is on pace to generate nearly $80 million in only 3.5 years. For the first quarter of 2020, we are estimating cloud revenue to be approximately $16 million to $16.5 million roughly double the prior year.\n\nFor full year 2020, we estimate our total software performance to be $103 million to $110 million, which will be another record year while absorbing $21 million decline in license revenue over 2019. Our cloud to license software mix in 2019 was 49% cloud, license 51%. In 2020, we expect our mix to dramatically shift to be about 75% cloud and 25% license.\n\nRegarding bookings, as we've discussed remaining performance obligation or RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud bookings performance, and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed, otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. Our RPO for the quarter totaled to $172 million, up 123% over prior year and 13% sequentially. For 2020, we are estimating a year end RPO range totaling $265 million to $275 million, up 55% to 60% over 2019. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than one year. Contracts with non-cancelable term of one year or less are excluded from the reported amount.\n\nOne last point on licensing cloud. As you know, our performance continues to depend on the number and relative value of large deals we closes in any quarter. While large license deals historically have been important, our markets continue to shift towards subscription models. While this is positive, deal sizes may be slightly smaller as subscription revenue is recognized overtime.\n\nFurther, some customers have longer implementation cycles associated with large distribution footprints, requiring a ramp subscription model, which can impact sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. We also retain appropriate caution around slow decision making by some clients and prospects, particularly retailers and potential global macro and geopolitical events that could impact business investment cycles.\n\nSo shifting to maintenance, revenue for the quarter totaled $38 million or 4% versus the prior year on strong cash collections. Retention rates remain strong at greater than 95%. For 2020, we believe our maintenance revenue will begin to gradually decline over 2019 on the combination of lower license revenue and more importantly, as demand from our WMS install based against to convert to cloud subscription. We expect our maintenance revenue to be down slightly versus 2019 to be about $146 million for the year. For Q1 2020, we estimate maintenance revenue to be approximately $34 million to $35 million.\n\nTurning to services. Consulting revenue for the quarter totaled $86.3 million, up 2%. Excluding the large government agency managed services contract conversion to cloud in Q3, our Q4 services apples-to-apples growth was 5% over 2018.\n\nAs expected and discussed on our Q3 call, services revenue was down 6% sequentially due to retail peak seasonality as customers idled implementation work in order to focus on the holiday selling season. We are targeting Q1 2020 services revenue of approximately $91 million to $92 million representing growth of approximately 3% to 4% over the prior year, so factoring in our Q3 2019 large government contract conversion, apples-to-apples Q1 growth of 7% to 8%.\n\nFor 2020 full year, we are estimating services revenue to be about $383 million, within a range of $381 million to $385 million, with growth of 6% to 7% and apples-to-apples growth of 7% to 8%. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 50.9%, largely driven by increased headcount and cloud and consulting services. We expect Q1 2020 subscription, maintenance and services margin to be about 49% due to these ongoing investments.\n\nTurning to operating income and margin, Q4 adjusted operating income totaled $33.4 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 21.8%. For full-year 2020, we are estimating an operating income range of $130 million to $136 million, with a midpoint of $133 million. For Q1 2020, we are estimating adjusted operating income of $27 million to $28 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.7% to 18%.\n\nOur sequential decline in margin from Q4 2019 is driven by our license forecast for Q1 2020, combined with continued growth investments across our business in people and facilities, including R&D, sales and marketing, cloud ops, consulting services and annual compensation increases and FICA taxes reset. We expect our Q4 adjusted effective income tax rate in Q4, pardon me, was 21%, and our full-year rate at 23.7%. We expect our Q1 2020 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. Regarding our capital structure, as Eddie mentioned, in Q4 2019, we repurchased approximately 445,000 shares worth $35 million.\n\nAnd for the full year, we repurchased 1.6 million shares worth $116 million. And last week, our board approved replenishing our repurchase authority limit to a total of $50 million. For 2020, we are estimating 64.7 million diluted shares outstanding and 64.5 million in the first quarter of diluted shares outstanding, which assumes no share buybacks.\n\nTurning to cash. We closed the quarter with cash and investments of $111 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $94 million, up 15% from December 31, 2018, on maintenance and cloud billings. Q4 cash flow from operations totaled $35 million, with full-year operating cash flow totaling $147 million, up 7% over prior year. Full-year capital expenditures totaled $15.2 million, reflecting significant facilities investment to accommodate our business growth. For 2020, we estimate CapEx investment to be about $10 million to $12 million.\n\nNow I'll wrap up with our updated full-year 2020 guidance and then turn it back to Eddie for his closing remarks. For revenue, our 2020 total revenue guidance range is $644 million to $656 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4% to 6%. As we head into 2020, at the midpoint of our license revenue, we estimate a $21 million decline over 2019, which is masking our underlying growth success by about 5 percentage points.\n\nAs such, excluding license, we are targeting 2020 year-over-year growth of approximately 9% to 10% for total revenue. First-half, second-half total revenue splits are 49% to 51%. And for Q1 2020, we estimate our total revenue range to be $151 million to $155 million, with $153 million midpoint, up 3% over Q1 2019. Excluding license decline impact, underlying growth was 7%.\n\nFor operating margin, we expect full-year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 20% to 20.5%, which we continue to view 20% as the trough for our business as we progress in our business transition, subject to the timing of business investment. For earnings per share, we expect that our adjusted EPS guidance range will be $1.53 to $1.60 per share with a 46%, 54%, first-half, second-half split. So it's 46% of EPS in the first half and 54% in the second half. Our GAAP EPS range is estimated to be $1.12 to $1.19.\n\nAnd for Q1 2020, we expect our adjusted EPS range to be $0.32 to $0.34. Lastly, as many of you know, we are two and a half years into a major business transformation and is helpful to provide some context as to how we're performing relative to those aspirational goals we outlined in late 2017. First, our total revenue growth is definitely exceeding our expectations. Barring any major macro events, we would expect this to continue, a very strong affirmation of our decision to pivot to cloud.\n\nThis is even in light of accelerated license declines which have been much faster than originally assumed. From a cloud revenue perspective, we are on target for our growth goal of 72% to 82% CAGR. If you reference our RPO growth and RPO dollar value, we're very comfortable with how our cloud business is progressing. As a result of the accelerated declines in our license business, combining with the timing of investments to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth, our operating margins are behind our aspirational target in 2022.\n\nWe fully expect continued and incremental operating leverage in the business moving forward, but the pace of such increases will be slightly lower than initially modeled. Our free cash flow targets remain very strong, and we would expect these to progress favorably going forward, enabling us to continue to self-fund our growth and innovation. In summary, we are guiding to another record year of total revenue, while continuing to aggressively invest in our business to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. We remain focused on delivering on our goals, while growing revenue and delivering top quartile operating margins as we progress in our cloud transition.\n\nWe remain very positive on the opportunities to grow and expand our business globally with the discipline and rigor that our shareholders continue to expect. So thank you very much. That covers the financial update. Back to Eddie for some closing comments."
