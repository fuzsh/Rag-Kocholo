        "text": "Manhattan Associates fuels supply chain and omnichannel commerce technology that helps power the world’s best companies.\n\nObjective: Momentum, Manhattan’s user conference, brings together more than 1,100 users, partners, and stakeholders. Its President’s Club rewards top salespeople and Peer Winners, employees from across the globe recognized for their exceptional contributions.\n\nSolution:\n\nFor Momentum, our team manages site selection, registration, and hosts a customer appreciation event. The standout feature is the partner pavilion and Discovery Center, featuring more than 75 demo stations. To keep Manhattan’s loyal user group coming back, we introduced an experiential “Arrival Lounge” theme at registration, treating attendees to luxe airport lounge amenities: from snacks-to-go to massage chairs and more.\n\nOur President’s Club approach taps local culture to execute unique attendee experiences, such as allowing attendees to blend their own Mexican tequila – topping each bottle with engraved red wax seals embossed with their sales achievement numbers."
