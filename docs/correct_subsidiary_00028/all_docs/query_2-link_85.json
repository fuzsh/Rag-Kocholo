        "text": " Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $297.1 million, an increase of 20%, compared to $246.7 million for 2009. License revenue increased 57% to $54.5 million from $34.7 million in 2009 and services revenue increased 13% to $213.8 million;  Operating income was $41.9 million for full year 2010, which includes $1.2 million of recoveries of previously expensed sales tax associated with expiring sales tax audit statutes, compared to $21.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, which includes restructuring charges of $3.9 million associated with the workforce reduction executed in the second quarter of 2009.  Operating margins for 2010 were 14.1%, up 550 basis points compared to operating margins of 8.6% in 2009;  Diluted earnings per share were $1.25 compared to $0.73 in 2009;  Cash flow from operations totaled $50.0 million compared to $58.3 million in 2009;  Cash and investments on hand at December 31, 2010 was $126.9 million compared to $123.0 million at December 31, 2009;  The Company repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock during the year totaling $76.5 million at an average price of $28.15 under its publicly-announced buy-back program; and  In January 2011, the Board of Directors approved raising the Companys remaining share repurchase authority from $4.0 million to $50.0 million of Manhattan Associates outstanding common stock.\n\n(1) The restructuring charge of $3.9 million and $4.7 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, mainly represents employee severance and outplacement services resulting from the workforce reduction initiatives executed in the respective year. (2) The impairment charge for 2008 includes a $1.7 million charge for writing down the remaining balance of a $2.0 million investment in a RFID technology company we made in July 2003. We recorded the additional impairment due to a down round of financing (i.e., a round of financing that was dilutive to our investment) in which our preferred share ownership was converted into common stock, eliminating our preference rights associated with liquidation, thereby substantially impairing our ability to recoup our investment. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.5 million on an investment in an auction rate security. We reduced the carrying value to zero due to credit downgrades of the underlying issuer and the bond insurer as well as increasing publicly reported exposure to bankruptcy risk by the issuer.\n\nExhibit Number Description 2.1\n\nAgreement and Plan of Merger, by and among the Registrant, Madison Acquisition Corp., Evant, Inc. and Ted Schlein, as Shareholder Representative, dated
